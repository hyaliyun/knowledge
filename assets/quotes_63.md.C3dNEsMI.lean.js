Their school colors are turquoise and chrome. Their school slogan is, \\"STEM out of Ten.\\" Its predecessor was Central-Hower High School which served the city of Akron from 1970 until its closure at the end of the 2005-06 school year. History The National Inventors Hall of Fame STEM High School was created in 2012 as a special high school with emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Its predecessor, Central- Hower High School was created in 1970 when Akron Public Schools combined Central High School with Hower Vocational School into a new building on the site of the Central location. The original Central building on Forge Street opened in 1886 and was initially named Akron High School. It was renamed Central High School in 1911 when the Akron Board of Education opened South High School. Hower Vocational School was named after M. Otis Hower (1858‚Äì1916), an Akron manufacturing leader who was an officer of the American Cereal Co. and multiple other enterprises. The school began in Perkins Elementary in 1927 and phased out the younger kids before becoming accredited in August 1935 as a vocational school.http://www.howervocational.org/HowerHistory.html Central and Hower both graduated their last classes in 1970. The combined student bodies were housed in Hower while the Central building was demolished and the new one was built. Central-Hower was constructed in 1973 and opened in September 1975. The Hower building was demolished in 1978. Central-Hower closed at the end of the 2005‚Äì06 school year and was serving as the temporary facility for the East Community Learning Center until their building was renovated. After that was completed, Central-Hower housed the students from Buchtel High School while their building was renovated. Currently, the building now houses the National Inventor's Hall of Fame STEM High School. Athletics Prior to the merger, the Central Wildcats and Hower Buccaneers competed in the Akron City Series. After the merger, the Central‚ÄìHower Eagles also competed in the Akron City Series. Currently, the National Inventors Hall of Fame STEM High School does not have any athletic teams.

Background Marshall was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to Lorna Marshall and Laurence Kennedy Marshall and raised in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Peterborough, New Hampshire. His sister, Elizabeth Marshall Thomas, is a writer. Marshall had one daughter, Sonya. He married Dr. Alexandra Eliot, who had two sons from a previous marriage, Frederick and Christopher Eliot. Marshall held a B.A. and M.A. in Anthropology from Harvard University. Marshall died of lung cancer in April, 2005. Career Marshall first traveled to the Kalahari Desert and met the Ju/'hoansi of the Nyae Nyae area in 1950 on a trip initiated by his father to search for the \\"Lost World of the Kalahari.\\" DER founder and filmmaker, John K. Marshall, der.org. Retrieved 1 Aug 2008. Before his second trip to the Kalahari, one year later, Marshall received a 16mm Kodak camera and advice from his father, \\"Don't direct, John, don't try to be artistic, just film what you see people doing naturally.\\" Marshall employed this advice during the 1950s, his films anticipated the cinema verite movement of the 1960s. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s members of the Marshall family - John Marshall, his sister Elizabeth Marshall Thomas, Lorna Marshall, and Laurence Marshall - returned to the Kalahari Desert numerous times to conduct an ethnographic study of the Ju/'hoansi and document one of the last remaining hunter gatherer cultures. From 1950-1958 Marshall filmed the hunting and gathering life of the Ju/'hoansi. His first edited film, The Hunters, was released in 1957. \\"The Hunters\\" told the story of a Ju/'hoansi giraffe hunt. Marshall later realized he had unintentionally romanticized Ju/'hoan life. \\"The Hunters,\\" portrayed the Ju/'hoansi as if they continued to live as they always had, where their main conflict was a struggle with nature. But when Marshall filmed them, they were actually suffering from having collided with the modern world and were subsisting primarily on gathered food and struggling to find enough to eat. Recognizing this discrepancy between reality and the portrayal of Ju/'hoansi life in \\"The Hunters,\\" Marshall was determined to produce more objective, and less mediated films about the Ju/'hoansi. He produced a series of short films designed to educate without exoticizing or \\"imposing western narrative structures on the subjects.\\" During the 1960s and most of the 1970s, Marshall, and nearly all anthropologists and filmmakers were banned from visiting the Ju/'hoansi by a government that saw them as \\"a threat to the status quo.\\" So during this period, Marshall produced many short films about the Ju/'hoansi of Nyae Nyae from the footage he had collected in the 1950s and pursued other film projects in the United States. He was the cinematographer for Fred Wiseman's first documentary film, Titicut Follies. Marshall also shot and produced a series of short films about police work in Pittsburgh, PA. In 1968, Marshall and Tim Asch founded Documentary Educational Resources, a non-profit organization dedicated to facilitating the use of cross-cultural documentaries in the classroom.About. der.org. Retrieved 1 Aug 2008. Marshall became involved in grassroots organizing and development in Nyae Nyae in the 1980s, forming a foundation that would become the Nyae Nyae Development Foundation of Namibia and devoting himself to advocating on behalf of the Ju/'hoansi. In 2003, the Society for Visual Anthropology bestowed on Marshall a lifetime achievement award for his 50 years of work among the hunter gatherer society. Two million feet of Marshall's 16mm documentary footage along with thousands of hours of video footage as well as edited films and videos of Ju/'hoansi are held at the Human Studies Film Archives, Smithsonian Institution. Known officially as the John Marshall Ju/'hoan Bushman Film and Video Collection, 1950‚Äì2000, the collection was added to UNESCO's Memory of the World Register for documentary heritage of world importance in July 2009. Cynthia Close, former Executive Director of Documentary Educational Resources, called the collection, \\"unparalleled in the history of film and in the history of documenting humanity\\". Evolution of reality filmmaking John Marshall produced realistic films that combined documentary media and ethnographic film. His work offers an evolving, original and unique view on what was technically possible and stylistic in documentary through his more than fifty years as a filmmaker. Marshall was a pioneer in the cinema verite style. He is quoted as saying, \\"I began shooting events from angles and distances that approximated the perspectives of the people I was filming, I tried to film as a member of the group rather than shoot standing outside as an observer.\\" He began thinking about his position vis-√†-vis the people he was filming, asking, \\"Am I someone in the group? Who? Why am I looking at the other person? Am I an outside observer? If I am an observer who am I? Is there anyone else observing from this angle and distance? What are they seeing and thinking?\\" Marshall‚Äôs shooting style evolved to reflect his position within the society he was filming, that of participant more than outside observer. As similar as this approach sounds to cinema verite, Marshall employed sit down interviews in many of his films such as \\"N!ai, the Story of a !Kung Woman\\" and cinema verite does not use sit down interviews. In his early films, and indeed, most of his films about the Ju/'hoansi, Marshall presents realistic views of the changing life of the once hunter-gatherer culture, but he himself is never a central character in those films. However, in his 2002 6-episode film \\"A Kalahari Family,\\" the curtain is pulled and John Marshall, as well as his family, who have been involved in both ethnographic and then political efforts with the Ju/'hoansi since the early 1950s, are revealed. This may be the ultimate in reality filmmaking, as the Marshalls have been intimately involved in the Ju/'hoansi culture, making both positive and negative impacts, and finally in \\"A Kalahari Family,\\" their impact is explored.

Biography Rosenberg grew up in a Conservative Jewish non-observant family in Saint Paul, Minnesota, where his parents operated a beauty supply company. According to his family's history, his great-great-grandfather was an important figure in Chabad-Lubavitch. Rosenberg was active in Jewish student politics at the University of Minnesota and served several years as an executive of the North American World Union of Jewish Students. He became a baal teshuva and joined the Chabad movement as an ultra-orthodox Hasidic Jew dedicated to study, community and rigorous observance, abandoning his former ambitions, one of which was to become a songwriter. He was an observant Hasidic Jew for the next 20 years. Rosenberg became disenchanted with the Chabad movement in 2004 after discovering an unsigned and unsent letter addressed to him by Menachem Mendel Schneerson responding to his request for Chabad aid in the effort to rescue the Jews of Ethiopia. This resulted in the creation of his blog, FailedMessiah.com. FailedMessiah blog Rosenberg's writing career began with his personal blog, FailedMessiah, referring to the belief among Lubavitcher Hassidim that their late rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson, is the messiah. FailedMessiah served as a news outlet with the motto Covering Orthodox Judaism since 2004. Rosenberg reports as a journalistic watchdog and whistleblower in ‚Äúa combination of muckraking reporting and personal grudge into a must-read digest of the actual and alleged misdeeds of the ultra-Orthodox world. He has broken news about sexual misconduct, smear campaigns and dubious business practices conducted by or on behalf of stringently religious Jews.‚Äù Chabad- Lubavitch leaders claim that he has exaggerated the degree of messianism in the movement and that he is driven to settle scores.

Provident Bank was the last largest independent commercial bank still headquartered in Maryland by the early 2000s, after the previous decade's wave of mergers which reduced the names and independent operations of most Baltimore banks to branch offices of larger, more affluent financial corporations and holding companies. Provident at the end with more than $6.4 billion in assets had also grown in its domestic home-grown reputation. Provident grew over the previous century, operating in total 143 branches in the Middle Atlantic states of Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington, D.C. Upon entering the Washington, D.C. and Virginia markets, the bank began to operate as \\"Provident Bank\\". Provident Bank was now a subsidiary of the bank holding operation of Provident Bankshares Corporation. The bank was founded as the Provident Savings Bank of Baltimore in 1886. Provident was one of the first banks to operate in-store small bank branches that are located within grocery stores, operated by the locally based Rite Aid (Read's) drug store chain that branched into food retail supermarkets in the 1970s. In 2007, Provident Bank made a $500,000 gift to Villa Julie College in north suburban Baltimore County in the county seat of western Towson. In the next few years, the formerly female, small business and secretarial college, began greatly expanding its curriculum and campus, changing its name to Stevenson College, for the name of the area and old road in its vicinity. After almost going under in 1983, Provident brought in two men who were willing to risk their careers to help revitalize the old savings bank; Carl Stearn and Peter M. Martin. Making a name for itself in the city's financial and civic community by creating a downtown landmark headquarters building like most of the other traditional powerhouse banks, Provident purchased and did a very good historic preservation/restoration project of the former Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond's Baltimore Branch building at the northwest corner of North Calvert and East Lexington Streets across from the city's iconic symbol, the Battle Monument in the mid-1980s. Ten years following, at Martin's 2001 retirement, he had reverted the path of the bank, making it the largest regional bank of the area, and earning himself the position of Chairman of the Maryland Bankers Association. His successor's errors, however, plunged the bank into the worst of the 2008-2009 \\"Great Recession\\" crisis. On October 15, 2008, Provident announced the acquisition of seven Chevy Chase Bank (originally Chevy Chase Savings and Loan Association, founded 1892 from Chevy Chase, Maryland in the Washington, D.C. northern suburbs of Montgomery County) branch deposits. The deposit base, totalling more than $40 million, was from branches located in Giant grocery stores (Landover, Maryland chain, founded in Washington, D.C.) in the Baltimore area. The acquisition included over 8000 commercial and retail customers. Provident paid a 3% net deposit to Chevy Chase Bank.https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS195127+15-Oct-2008+PRN20081015 \\"Provident Bankshares Announces Acquisition of Chevy Chase Bank Deposits at Seven Giant Food In-Store Branches in Baltimore\\", Reuters, October 15, 2008.

Animation (though it used a Hanna-Barbera logo at the end of the movie). It was dedicated to Paulette Oates, who helped resurrect Warner Bros. Animation in the late 1980s. All the main voice actors of Mystery, Inc. reprise their roles. The DVD was released on September 23, 2008. This is the first Scooby cartoon produced entirely without either one of the original creators, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. Unlike the previous seven movies, this film is similar to Zombie Island, Witch's Ghost (which previously featured Tim Curry), Alien Invaders and Cyber Chase, by making all the fantastical elements of the story real. Plot The Mystery, Inc. gang go to the Coolsville Halloween carnival on Halloween night. They encounter the resident magician \\"The Amazing Krudsky\\" (voiced by Wayne Knight) who refuses to allow Scooby to see his show, so he and Shaggy retaliate by exposing Krudsky as a fraud during one of his acts, causing his audience to walk out and Krudsky to swear revenge. The gang gets thrown out of the carnival and decide to go trick-or-treating. In his tent, Krudsky reveals his desire to become a real magician. The Fairy Princess Willow (voiced by Hayden Panettiere) enters Krudsky's tent and causes Krudsky to notice an entry about the Goblin Scepter in a spell book, which can be combined with fairy magic to control Halloween. Krudsky then gets an idea to obtain the scepter and rule the world with it. Willow decides to toy with him, but knocks herself out; Krudsky sees that she is a fairy and absorbs her magical powers, thus becoming a real magician. Meanwhile, Shaggy's and Scooby's last stop trick-or-treating is a spooky looking house which claims to be a \\"genuine magic shoppe\\". Once inside, a thunderstorm begins, frightening them. The proprietor of the magic shop Mr. Gibbles (voiced by Wallace Shawn) reveals to the duo that magic really does exist and sings a song. Krudksy enters the shop chasing Willow, captures her, and then turns Gibbles into a rabbit and steals the magic equipment before leaving. Mr. Gibbles explains Krudsky's plan to Shaggy and Scooby and shows them a vision of Krudsky turning their friends into monsters, horrifying the two. Gibbles gets them to board the Grim Reaper Railway which will fly them to the spirit world, warning them that they have to return home before sunrise or else they will be trapped in the spirit world forever. Before they depart, Shaggy and Scooby are magically disguised with the use of temporary magic cards into monster-like versions of themselves. Meanwhile, while looking for Shaggy and Scooby, the rest of the gang see Krudsky conversing with the Goblin King (voiced by Tim Curry) through a mirror who reluctantly agrees to exchange his scepter for Princess Willow at midnight. Seeing all the magic causes Velma to fall unconscious; Fred and Daphne leave Velma to rest in the mystery machine while they set a trap for both the Goblin King and Krudsky. In the magic world, Shaggy and Scooby's disguises disappear as they encounter a werewolf. In order to get past him, they convince him that they are collectively a werewolf. During the song \\"Bump in the Night\\", Shaggy adds in the lyric on how to get to the Goblin King's castle causing all of the monsters to run out of the bar. The Goblin King's two bumbling goblin henchmen, Glob and Glum (voiced by James Belushi and Larry Joe Campbell), attempt to capture Scooby and Shaggy, but are stopped by Jack O'Lantern (voiced by Jay Leno). The trio then encounter the Headless Horseman who is trying to rejoin with Jack. They escape the Horseman and arrive at the Witches' Hut where they meet the Grand Witch (voiced by Lauren Bacall) and her two fellow witches (voiced by Grey DeLisle and Russi Taylor). The witches send Shaggy and Scooby on a ride on their flying broomstick towards the Goblin King's castle, but they are shot down by Glob and Glum by a goblin cannon. Crash-landing in a small fairy village, Shaggy and Scooby find three fairies named Sparkplug, Honeybee and Tiddlywink, who help them to the Goblin King's castle entrance. Using a potion from the witches (made from someone called \\"Scratch\\"), Shaggy and Scooby disguise themselves as Daphne and Velma in order to get inside the castle. Only a few minutes away from midnight, Shaggy and Scooby try to steal the scepter from the Goblin King, but are captured when their disguises wear off and sent to the tower dungeon. Back in the mortal world, Krudsky and the Goblin King are almost through with their trade when Fred and Daphne release a trap, only managing to catch the Goblin King. Krudsky takes the scepter, turning himself into the new Goblin King before turning the Goblin King into a goose. Krudsky and his new goblin army set off to take over the world. He turns the Mystery Machine into a living monster vehicle called the \\"Monstrous Machine\\" to chase Fred, Daphne, Velma, and Willow. The goblins capture the three and Krudsky uses his newfound powers to turn Fred into a vampire, Daphne into a witch, and Velma into a werewolf (the terrifying vision that Scooby and Shaggy were shown by Mr. Gibbles earlier). At that moment, Scooby, Shaggy and Jack O'Lantern arrive having been saved from the dungeon before sunrise by the fairies and Broomy. Jack sacrifices himself, making Krudsky drop the staff. Scooby uses the staff to break Krudsky's spells before returning it to the Goblin King, who is revealed to be Princess Willow's father. The Goblin King holds his daughter responsible for all the trouble caused and grounds her for a year as punishment, but expresses relief that she's safe and sound. Mr. Gibbles brings Jack back to life with the Goblin King's help, who then takes Krudsky prisoner for his crimes. He, the goblin army, Willow, Jack, Broomy and Mr. Gibbles all leave and return to the magical world.

The range of the Rup dialects includes the southern part of Thrace, i.e. Strandzha, the region of Haskovo, the Rhodopes and the eastern half of Pirin Macedonia. Overview Before the Balkan wars and World War I, the Rup dialects covered a much larger territory, including vast areas of Eastern Thrace, Western Thrace and the eastern part of Greek Macedonia. Following the wars, most of the Bulgarian population in these areas fled or resettled to Bulgaria and nowadays, the Rup dialects outside Bulgaria are spoken only by the Muslim Bulgarians (Pomaks) in Western Thrace in Greece. Unlike the Northwestern or the Balkan dialects, the dialects included in the Rup group are not uniform and have vastly different phonological characteristics. What brings them together is the vast array of reflexes of Old Church Slavonic —£ (yat). Whereas the Western Bulgarian dialects have only for yat in all positions and the Balkan dialects have or , depending on the character of the following syllable, the Rup dialects feature a number of different reflexes, none of which is similar to the ones in the Western Bulgarian or the Balkan dialects. These reflexes include: in all positions, broad –µ () in all positions, before a hard syllable and broad e () before a soft syllable, broad e () in a stressed syllable and normal e in an unstressed syllable, etc. etc. Phonological and morphological characteristics The following phonological and morphological characteristics apply to all Rup dialects: * —â/–∂–¥ (/) for Proto-Slavic / (as in Standard Bulgarian) - –ª–µ—â–∞, –º–µ–∂–¥—É (lentils, between) * A large number of palatal consonants in all possible positions of the word: –∫–∏—Ç–∫–∏ vs. formal Bulgarian –∫–∏—Ç–∫–∏ (wrists) * Soft (palatal) –∂ , —à , —á : –∂–∞–±–∞ vs. formal Bulgarian –∂–∞–±–∞ (frog). The Rup dialects are very archaic with regard to this as in all other Bulgarian dialects, these consonants have become hard and are now part of the hard consonants * Preserved consonant —Ö (') in all positions: —Ö–æ–¥–∏ (walks) * Widespread labialisation of ' into ': –π—É–º–µ vs. formal Bulgarian –∏–º–µ (name) * Transition of the consonant group -–¥–Ω into -–Ω–Ω: –≥–ª–∞–Ω–Ω–∞ vs. formal Bulgarian –≥–ª–∞–¥–Ω–∞ (hungry) (cf. Subbalkan dialect) Division of the Rup dialects The Rup dialects can furthermore be divided into two large groups, \\"true\\" Rup dialects (further divided into western and eastern Rup dialects based on geographical grounds) and Rhodopean dialects. The two groups are sometimes treated as separate dialectal groups. The \\"true\\" Rup dialects include the Strandzha dialect, the Thracian dialect, the Serres- Nevrokop dialect and, with some reservations, the Babyak and Razlog dialects. The Rhodopean dialects comprise the Smolyan, Hvoyna, Paulician and Chepino dialect, whereas the Zlatograd dialect is transitional between the two groups. The Babyak and Razlog dialect are usually classified as Rup dialects on account of the reflexes of Old Church Slavonic —£ (yat). However, most of their other phonological properties are similar or identical to the ones of the Southwestern Bulgarian dialects, and especially to the Samokov and Ihtiman dialect, and that's why they are often considered to be transitional between the two groups. Phonological and morphological characteristics of the \\"true\\" Rup dialects * The reflex of Old Church Slavonic yat is usually before a hard syllable and broad e () before a soft syllable: –±—è–ª/–±–ª–∏ instead of formal Bulgarian –±—è–ª/–±–µ–ª–∏ (white) * Vowel reduction of unstressed , and which is weaker than the reduction in the Balkan dialects, yet stronger than the one accepted in the formal language * Transition of a into or broad e () after a soft (palatal) consonant and before a soft syllable: –∂–∞–±–∞-–∂–µ–±–∏/–∂–±–∏ (frog- frogs), —á–∞—à–∞-—á–µ—à–∏/—á—à–∏ (cup-cups), –ø–∏—è–Ω-–ø–∏–π–µ–Ω–∏/–ø–∏–π–Ω–∏ (drunk sing. - drunk pl.), which is similar to the one in the Central Balkan dialect. This is not accepted in Standard Bulgarian, which has instead adopted Western Bulgarian –∂–∞–±–∞-–∂–∞–±–∏, —á–∞—à–∞-—á–∞—à–∏, –ø–∏—è–Ω-–ø–∏—è–Ω–∏ * —ä () for Old Church Slavonic —´ (yus) and —ä () (as in Standard Bulgarian) ‚Äì –º—ä—à, —Å—ä–Ω (man, sleep) * ' for both Old Church Slavonic little yus (—ß) and —å (Standard Bulgarian has for the little yus and for the small jer) * Suffix -—Ü–∫–∏ instead of -—Å–∫–∏ for qualitative adjectives: –∂–µ–Ω—Ü–∫–∏ instead of formal Bulgarian –∂–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∏ (female) Phonological and morphological characteristics of the Rhodopean dialects Yat border in the Bulgarian language The Rhodopean dialects occupy the middle part of the Rup dialects, i.e. the central and western Rhodopes. Due to the mountainous terrain and the relative isolation the speakers which lasted well into the beginning of the 20th century, the Rhodopean dialects are both very well preserved and extremely idiosyncratic with regard to the other Bulgarian dialects. The Rhodopean dialects have the following common phonological and morphological properties: * Broad e (') for Old Church Slavonic yat in all positions and regardless of the word stress and the character of the following syllable: –±–ª/–±–ª–∏ vs. formal Bulgarian –±—è–ª/–±–µ–ª–∏ (white), –≥–æ–ª–º/–≥–æ–ª–º–∏ vs. formal Bulgarian –≥–æ–ª—è–º/–≥–æ–ª–µ–º–∏ (big). This makes the Rhodopean dialects extremely archaic as the broad e is considered to be the original pronunciation of Old Church Slavonic yat * Full transition of a into broad e (') after a soft (palatal) consonant: –∂–±a (frog), —á—àa (cup) * Merger of Old Church Slavonic big yus —´, little yus —ß, —å and —ä into one vowel which is different, depending on the individual dialect * Lack of consonants –¥–∂ and –¥–∑ - –∂ and –∑ are pronounced instead: –∂–∞–º vs. Standard Bulgarian –¥–∂–∞–º (windowpane) Sources –°—Ç–æ–π–∫–æ–≤, –°—Ç–æ–π–∫–æ: –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∞ –¥–∏–∞–ª–µ–∫—Ç–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—è, –ê–∫–∞–¥. –∏–∑–¥. \\"–ü—Ä–æ—Ñ. –ú–∞—Ä–∏–Ω –î—Ä–∏–Ω–æ–≤\\", 2006 Category:Dialects of the Bulgarian language ","title":"Rup dialects"},{"id":"18685571","text":"Frasier syndrome is a urogenital anomaly associated with the WT1 (Wilms tumor 1 gene) gene. It was first characterized in 1964. Presentation Frasier syndrome presents at birth with male pseudohermaphroditism (the external genitalia have a female appearance despite an XY genotype), streak gonads and progressive glomerulonephropathy (focal segmental glomerulosclerosis). Patients are also at increased risk of genito-urinary tumors (usually gonadoblastoma). The glomerulonephropathy presents later than in Denys-Drash syndrome, and the tumour risk phenotype is different; whilst Denys-Drash syndrome is associated with Wilms' tumour, Frasier syndrome is associated with gonadoblastoma. Differentiating between the two syndromes can be challenging.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/136680 Genetics The WT1 gene exists on chromosome 11 (at 11p13), and codes for a four zinc finger transcription factor. Its role as a transcription factor is related to proper kidney and gonadal development. The link between kidney and gonadal development and WT1 was highlighted in past studies looking at the related Denys-Drash syndrome. Results of various investigations identified the loss of function of WT1 to be a prerequisite of Wilms' tumour development, and also a key trait of individuals with genital abnormalities. Mutations responsible for Frasier syndrome predominantly occur in intron 9 of the WT1 gene, specifically nucleotide substitutions that influence an intron splice site. Mutations in this region proved for the absence of three amino acids‚ÄîKTS‚Äîbetween the third and fourth WT1 zinc fingers. Referring to the autosomal dominant expressive nature of this disease, it is only necessary for an individual to have one complement of the mutated intronic sequence to appear affected. Differing from the similar Denys-Drash syndrome, where a mutated form of the WT1 protein exists, Frasier syndrome expression works solely on the existence of a changed ratio of KTS isoforms: normal WT1 proteins including the KTS site (+KTS), and mutated, shortened proteins lacking the KTS site (‚ÄìKTS). Through alternative splicing, a specific ratio of the two isoforms normally exists, though the mutation in the intron 9 splice site severely lowers levels of the +KTS isoform; this leads to Frasier syndrome. Inheritance pattern Frasier syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, indicating the need for only one mutated allele in a cell to lead to expression of the disease. Mutations predominantly occur de novo, allowing for expression in an individual that has no family history of it. The mutations occur during gamete formation or early in embryogenesis.

Sutherland: Language and Lewis Carroll, The Hague, Mouton 1970. Arthur B. Frost added illustrations when the series was printed in book form. The stories, or Knots as Carroll calls them, present mathematical problems. In a later issue, Carroll gives the solution to a Knot and discusses readers' answers. The mathematical interpretations of the Knots are not always straightforward. The ribbing of readers answering wrongly ‚Äì giving their names ‚Äì was not always well received (see Knot VI below). In the December 1885 book preface Carroll writes: :The writer's intention was to embody in each Knot (like medicine so dexterously, but ineffectually, concealed in the jam of our early childhood) one or more mathematical questions ‚Äì in Arithmetic, Algebra, or Geometry, as the case might be ‚Äì for the amusement, and possible edification, of the fair readers of that magazine. Describing why he was ending the series, Carroll writes to his readers that the Knots were \\"but a lame attempt\\". Others were more receptive: In 1888 Stuart Dodgson Collingwood wrote \\"With some people, this is the most popular of all his books; it is certainly the most successful attempt he ever made to combine mathematics and humour.\\"Stuart Dodgson Collingwood The Life and Letters Of Lewis Carroll, Kessinger Publishing 2004.

The older knight obscurely explains the mathematical problem. :Carroll's Solution: As with most of the Knots, the solution includes: a simplified restatement of the problem, a method to arrive at the solution, the solution, a discussion of readers' solutions, then readers' grades. In his discussion, Carroll relates that one reader accuses the senior knight of untruthfulness (this is rebutted by Carroll, using the knight's tone). Another reader answers the problem by extending the story (this is quoted). The poem of two readers answering the problem is also quoted. Knot II, Eligible Apartments. Professor Balbus, named after a hero with \\"anecdotes whose vagueness in detail was more than compensated by their sensational brilliance\\", is given a problem by students. The number of guests for a party is described in puzzling terms. He in turn creates a mathematical problem for them: two answers are required of readers. :Solution: The mathematical problem is solved with the aid of a diagram. Those employing \\"guesswork\\" are given partial credit. One reader suggests the genealogical problem can be solved by \\"intermarriages\\", to which Carroll replies, \\"Wind of the western sea, you have had a very narrow escape! Be thankful to appear in the Class-list at all!\\" Knot III, Mad Mathesis. Overbearing aunt Mad Mathesis bets her niece that she can select a train from London that will pass more trains than her niece's does. The niece loses, but thinks she has found a solution to win, a second time. Knot IV, The Dead Reckoning. The two knights of Knot I, in a modern guise, are party to a dispute about the weight of passengers' bags lost overboard from a ship. Knot V, Oughts and Crosses. The aunt and niece from Knot III are in an art museum. Trading snipes as before, the aunt evades her niece's logical problem: the niece's preceptress had told her girls \\"The more noise you make the less jam you will have, and vice versa.\\" The niece wants to know if this means that if they are silent, they will have infinite jam. Instead, her aunt responds with her own logical problem. Knot VI, Her Radiancy. Two travellers appear in Kgovjni, a land referenced in earlier Knots. The ruler places them in \\"the best dungeon, and abundantly fed on the best bread and water\\" until they resolve a logical problem. :Solution: Two problems are posed, the first of which is resolved by word-play. Much later, after the solutions to Knot VII, Carroll returns to Knot VI, to describe the second problem in detail, and to rebut criticisms of readers (who were identified by name) that they were duped. Knot VII, Petty Cash. The aunt and niece encounter \\"by a remarkable coincidence\\" others who are travelling not only on the same train, but at the same station, on the same day, at the same hour. Lunch bills are muddled due to the aunt's reluctance in writing down numbers that could \\"easily\\" be memorised. :Solution: Carroll gives a solution which \\"universally\\" produces an answer, then gives detailed critiques of several other approaches that only \\"accidentally\\" give a solution. Knot VIII, De Omnibus Rebus. The travellers of Knot VI are leaving Kgovjni with relief, when a mathematical problem occurs to one of them. Knot IX, A Serpent with Corners. The characters of Knot II, Balbus and his two students, return to give three problems loosely connected by a narrative. Knot X, Chelsea Buns. Mad Mathesis and her niece return, as well as Balbus and his two students. :Solution note: The puzzle called The Change of Day is never answered, as Carroll is \\"waiting for statistics\\" and is himself \\"so entirely puzzled by it\\". The answer to this puzzle is the International Date Line, which was created contemporaneously with A Tangled Tale. Changes after magazine publication Changes were made when the stories were published in book form. In the solution to Knot III reader AYR is dropped entirely from discussion. The change causes a comparison with same number of readers getting a perfect score on a previous Knot to be dropped: :(there is something uncanny about this coincidence: let us hope it will prove to be the beginning of a genuine ghost story). Other examples of changes in Knot III are \\"Mad Mathesis dragged her off\\" to \\"Mad Mathesis hurried her on\\", and Clair saying \\"If I may go the same way round, as I did last time\\" to \\"If I may choose my train\\".

The Genesis version was also produced by Sunsoft. The game is more faithful to the film's plot than the NES version and features levels in which the player controls Batman's vehicles. Similarities and differences from the NES version Unlike the NES version, this version stays closer to the plot of the film, and features the Batmobile and Batwing in the form of horizontal shooting levels. While the NES version allows three unique weapons and unlimited continues, the Genesis version only has the Batarang as a special weapon with limited continues. The grappling hook is an additional item. The game also deviates from the film plot because, in the film, Batman attempts to save Napier from falling into the chemicals, but fails. However, in the game, Batman actually knocks Napier into the vat. This game has several cutscenes, with the player advancing to the next destination after defeating a boss character. Like the NES version, the music was also composed by Naoki Kodaka. Reception IGN gave the game a review score of 6/10 saying that \\"Sunsoft's Batman accurately recreates the movie and it was certainly a welcome treat after seeing the import featured in early gaming rags. Unfortunately, the game is too short and not especially challenging.\\" The game holds an aggregate score of 70% on GameRankings.

He holds a B.A from Harvard (1963) and an M.D. (1971) and a Ph.D. (1972) from the University of Pennsylvania.Jonathan Shay, Clinical Psychiatrist / Classicist He is best known for his publications comparing the experiences of Vietnam veterans with the descriptions of war and homecoming in Homer's Iliad and Odyssey. Work with Vietnam veterans Shay's early medical work was laboratory research on how central nervous system cells are affected by strokes, but after suffering a stroke himself, he went to work for the United States Department of Veterans' Affairs outpatient clinic in Boston.Joseph Shapiro, \\"Psychiatrist Who Counsels Vets Wins Genius Grant,\\" NPR, September 25, 2007. While working there, in his words, \\"The veterans simply kidnapped me,\\"Moral Wounds of War: Jonathan Shay Part 1 Dec 20, 2010 and his work with them \\"utterly redirected my life.\\" In 1987, Shay shifted from neuropathology to the study of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and published a short article linking the combat histories of patients at the VA with the experience of war described in Homer's Iliad. He was then approached by classics professor Gregory Nagy who suggested that the topic might be expanded into a full-length book on the nature and treatment of PTSD. He has written two books, Achilles in Vietnam: Combat Trauma and the Undoing of CharacterShay, Jonathan. Achilles in Vietnam: Combat trauma and the undoing of character. Simon and Schuster, 2010. and Odysseus in America: Combat Trauma and the Trials of Homecoming,Shay, J. (2002). Odysseus in America: Combat Trauma and the Trials of Homecoming. New York: Scribner. which discuss PTSD by reference to the experiences of American veterans of the Vietnam War, and the experiences depicted in the Iliad and the Odyssey. Shay's research uncovered what may be the earliest historical reference to PTSD, in Lady Percy's soliloquy in Henry IV, Part 1 (act 2, scene 3, lines 40-62). Written around 1597, it represents an unusually accurate description of the symptom constellation of PTSD. Shay has also done research on the use of Prozac in treating PTSD in Vietnam veterans. Views on PTSD Shay writes, \\"For years I have agitated against the diagnostic jargon 'Posttraumatic stress disorder' because transparently we are dealing with an injury, not an illness, malady, disease, sickness, or disorder.\\" Shay argues that PTSD is not an illness but the persistence of adaptive behaviors needed to survive in a stressful environment. For example, emotional numbing is useful in a disaster situation and maladaptive in a family setting, and loss of trust enhances survival in a prison but not in a community setting. Like Derek Summerfield, he also argues against labeling and patronizing treatment. Shay recommends that we resocialize trauma survivors as a means of promoting socially acceptable behavior patterns.Jonathan Shay, quoted from transcript of his interview in the documentary film Voices in Wartime (2005). Written and directed by Rick King. He cites classical Greek theater and the collective mourning described in the Iliad as possible precedents. In Odysseus in America he writes of \\"the circle of communalization of trauma\\": \\"When trauma survivors hear that enough of the truth of their experience has been understood, remembered and retold with enough fidelity to carry some of this truth ... then the circle of communalization is complete.\\" Prevention of PTSD Shay is a passionate advocate of improved mental health treatment for soldiers and of more vigorous efforts to prevent PTSD, in addition to structural reform of the ways the U.S. armed forces are organized, trained, and counseled. He has collaborated with General James Jones, the past commandant of the Marines, and Major General James Mattis of the Marines.The Salem Award for Human Rights and Social Justice: Dr. Jonathan Shay: Advocating for Veterans. He has promoted the concept of preventative psychiatry in support of military cohesion, leadership and training: > Prevention of psychological and moral injury in military service has three > axes: cohesion, leadership, and training. First is keep people together. > Train them together, send them into danger together, bring them home > together, and give them time together to digest what they've just been > through ... The second axis is expert, ethical, and properly supported > leadership ... The third axis of prevention is prolonged, progressive, > realistic training for what the troops have to do and face.Jonathan Shay, > \\"Achilles and Odysseus Today: What Homer Can Tell Us About Military > Leadership.\\" Concept of moral injury Shay introduced the concept of \\"Moral injury\\" and recommended treatment strategies for it in his two books. Moral injury is a distinct syndrome from (but often co-morbid with) PTSD and is one of the primary themes for the veterans described in his books, often leading to personality changes and obstructing successful treatment.Shay, J., Munroe, J. \\"Group and Milieu Therapy for Veterans with Complex posttraumatic stress disorder,\\" in posttraumatic stress disorder: A Comprehensive Text, Edited by Saigh, Philip A. and Bremner, J. Douglas. Boston: Allyn & Bacon, 1998. Pp. 391-413 Shay writes that his \\"current most precise (and narrow) definition of moral injury has three parts. Moral injury is present when (1) there has been a betrayal of what is morally correct; (2) by someone who holds legitimate authority; and (3) in a high-stakes situation.\\" Factor (2) is an instance of Shay's concept of \\"leadership malpractice\\". Other authors have alternative definitions where (2) is by the individual.\\"Moral Injury\\" Video of Dr. Jonathan Shay at the Narrative Medicine VA Workshop, March 9, 2012. Columbia University Medical Center. Career recognition Shay is respected in military circles, having conducted the Commandant of the Marine Corps Trust Study (1999-2000); serving as Visiting Scholar-at-Large at the U.S. Naval War College (2001); Chair of Ethics, Leadership, and Personnel Policy in the Office of the U.S. Army Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel; and was Omar Bradley Chair of Strategic Leadership at the US Army War College and Dickinson College (2008-2009).Dickinson College, Awards to Members of the Faculty In 2007 he received a MacArthur \\"Genius Grant\\" fellowship. In 2010 he was awarded the Salem Award for Human Rights and Social Justice for \\"building public awareness and acceptance of post-traumatic stress disorder as a serious and bona fide war injury.\\" In 2018, Volunteers of America established The Shay Moral Injury Center, named in his honor and dedicated to deepening understanding about moral injury in the many populations who experience it.

The U.S. Navy purchased her on 10 August 1917 from Howard Gould of New York, New York, and converted her into an armed patrol yacht. She was commissioned in the Tebo's Yacht Basin, Brooklyn, New York, on 16 April 1918, Commander E. B. Larimer in command. World War I Service Niagara departed New York on 21 May 1918 as escort for a merchant convoy bound for Bermuda and the Azores. She arrived at Ponta Delgada, Azores, on 12 August 1918 and departed on 22 August 1918 to join the American Patrol Detachment at Grassy Bay, Bermuda. On 5 September 1918 she stood out of Grassy Bay to rescue and tow in the merchant sloop Gauntlet, which was adrift after her sails had been carried away in a storm. On 14 September 1918 Niagara sailed for Martinique in the West Indies to escort the French cable ship Pouyer Quertier, arriving at Fort-de-France on 19 September 1918. The two ships operated in the West Indies, visiting Trinidad, Barbados, Martinique, and Puerto Rico, until Niagara stood out from Port of Spain, Trinidad, on 13 December 1918 for Charleston, South Carolina. Postwar Service Niagara entered the New York Navy Yard on 13 May 1919 for repairs before training out of New London, Connecticut, and New York. She departed New York on 25 September 1919 for Key West, Florida, then cruised off the coast of Mexico and between ports in Texas, Louisiana, and Florida. Other missions took her off Honduras, Guatemala, and Cuba. Reclassified PY-9 on 17 July 1920, she continued patrols in the Caribbean Sea as a unit of the special service squadron until decommissioning at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 21 April 1922. Niagara recommissioned on 24 June 1924, Commander Paul P. Blackburn in command. She sailed on 3 November 1924 to survey in the Caribbean under the direction of the Navy Hydrographic Office. She operated most of the next eight years charting the Gulf of Venezuela and the coast of Central America. Her last survey cruise ended when she returned to Philadelphia on 17 October 1930.

The United States Third Fleet's attacks on Kure Naval Arsenal and nearby ports on 24, 25, and 28 July sank an aircraft carrier, three battleships, five cruisers, and several smaller warships. During the same period the British Pacific Fleet attacked other targets in the Inland Sea region and sank two escort ships and several smaller vessels as well as damaging an escort carrier. Prelude In July 1945 the IJN's remaining large warships were concentrated near the major naval base of Kure. The ships were immobilized by fuel shortages and were being used only as stationary anti-aircraft batteries. Admiral John S. McCain, Sr., the commander of the Fast Carrier Task Force, strongly opposed attacking Kure as he and his staff believed that the ships only posed a minor threat. In his memoirs Admiral Halsey gave four reasons for why he attacked Kure despite McCain's objections. First, he believed that the attack would boost US morale and retaliate for the Attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Second, it would ensure that the Japanese could not disrupt the planned Soviet invasion of Hokkaido. Third, it would prevent Japan from using its fleet as a bargaining point to secure better peace terms. Finally, he had been ordered to conduct the attack by his superior officer, Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. Despite operating as a task group of the US Third Fleet, the British Pacific Fleet was excluded from the attack on Kure because the Americans did not want Britain to claim a part in destroying the Japanese fleet. The BPF was instead used to attack airfields and the port of Osaka. Kure had been subjected to several major attacks prior to July 1945. On 19 March 1945, 321 US Navy aircraft attacked Japanese warships in and around the city. This attack was unsuccessful, with no Japanese ships being sunk, though an escort carrier and a light cruiser were badly damaged. On 5 May B-29 Superfortress bombers of the United States Army Air Forces successfully bombed the Hiro Naval Aircraft Factory. B-29s laid naval mines in the approaches to the port on 30 March and 5 May, and 40 percent of the city was destroyed in a major air raid conducted by Superfortresses on 1 July. Participating in the attacks were Task Force 38 for the Americans and Task Force 37 for the British. Task Force 37 included the carriers HMS , , and . Battle Tone under attack on 24 July The Third Fleet's attack against Kure began on 24 July. US carrier aircraft flew 1,747 sorties on this day against Japanese targets. The attacks sank the aircraft carrier and the cruiser , which was acting as the Combined Fleet's flagship. The battleships , , and , the heavy cruisers and , and the outdated armored training cruisers and were all heavily damaged and settled in shallow water. The shallow anchorage precluded the use of torpedoes. The US aircraft attempted to reduce their losses from the large number of anti-aircraft guns in the area by the use of variable time-fused bombs. The British Pacific Fleet's attacks against Osaka and targets in the Inland Sea damaged escort carrier and sank the escort ships No. 4 and No. 30 for the loss of four aircraft. US strikes against Kure resumed on 28 July, damaging the battleships Ise and Haruna and the heavy cruiser Aoba. The aircraft carrier which had largely escaped attack in the earlier raid, and the unserviceable light aircraft carrier were attacked, with Katsuragi suffering heavy damage. These air strikes were among the largest conducted by the US Navy during the war, and were the most destructive of shipping. On 28 July, the USAAF attacked Kure ships with 79 B-24 Liberators from Okinawa. Four bomb hits were made upon the beached cruiser Aoba, breaking off her stern. Two B-24s were shot down and 14 others damaged. Allied losses included 102 aircrew and 133 planes lost in combat or accidents during the attacks. These losses were higher than those suffered by the Third Fleet in most of its operations, and were the result of the heavy anti-aircraft defences around Kure. Aftermath The Allied attacks on Kure and the inland sea left at Yokosuka as the only remaining capital ship in Japan's inventory. The destruction of the battleships and heavy cruisers at Kure was seen by British official historian Stephen Roskill as avenging the losses suffered by the United States at Pearl Harbor. The attacks allowed the Soviet Pacific Fleet to operate in the Sea of Japan without fear of attack by Japanese ships.

Active in opposition to the Vietnam War, he made national headlines in 1970 when, as acting governor, he ordered Vermont flags lowered to half staff after the killing of four students at Kent State University by National Guard troops. In response Governor Deane Davis returned to Vermont from a conference and countermanded Hayes's directive. Hayes ran unsuccessfully against Davis for governor in the 1970 Republican primary. He later became a Democrat, and resided in Burlington. He served as Legal Counsel to Governor Thomas P. Salmon, was chairman of the Vermont State Board of Education, and was appointed a Judge of the Superior Court. While on the Superior Court, he served as chief administrative judge. In 1985, Hayes was appointed a Justice of the Vermont Supreme Court, succeeding Wynn Underwood; Hayes served in this position until his death. He was an advocate of attorneys paying greater attention to state constitutions generally, and the Vermont constitution in particular, and suggested that too much deference was paid to \\"buzzwords\\" from federal court decisions. In Vermont v. Jewett, Hayes argued that state constitutions should serve as consistent protection for the rights and liberties of a state's citizens, no matter how the decisions of the federal courts ebbed and flowed as membership and political outlook changed over time. At the time of his death he faced Judicial Conduct Board charges for alleged misconduct along with fellow justices William C. Hill and Ernest W. Gibson III. Hill retired, and Vermont Judicial Conduct Board charges against Gibson were dropped in August, 1987. (Wheel was later convicted on charges arising from the case; Hill was found to have violated rules regarding judicial conduct.) Hayes died in Boston, Massachusetts on May 5, 1987 while being treated for lung cancer. He was buried at Saint Marys Cemetery in Fair Haven. He was married to Jennie Christy. They had three children, two sons and a daughter.

The inflorescences are composed of a large number of small white flower heads, each with 5 disc florets but no ray florets. Plants can be highly variable due to hybridization. Image:Eupatorium_rotundifolium_NRCS-2.jpgDetail of stem and leaves. (Photo by Robert H. Mohlenbrock) Taxonomy Three varieties of Eupatorium rotundifolium are recognized. They are: *Eupatorium rotundifolium var. ovatum (Bigelow) Torr. *Eupatorium rotundifolium var. rotundifolium *Eupatorium rotundifolium var. scabridum (Elliott) A.Gray The plants known as Eupatorium rotundifolium var. saundersii have often been treated as a variety of E. rotundifolium. They can be distinguished based on morphology, and molecular evidence also suggests that these plants may be different enough from E. rotundifolium to recognize them as a species, Eupatorium pilosum. Hybridization As is common in Eupatorium, E. rotundifolium can form hybrids with other species in the genus. In particular, Eupatorium godfreyanum is a hybrid of E. rotundifolium and Eupatorium sessilifolium. Chemical constituents Eupatorium rotundifolium contains sesquiterpene lactones of the guaianolide type including euparotin acetate and eupachlorin acetate, both of which inhibit tumor growth in vitro when isolated from the plant.

It tells the story of the French Jesuit missionaries in Canada, then New France, starting from their arrival in 1632. The book was re-published in 1912 by Little, Brown and Company, Boston. It was republished in 1983, along with the other six volumes, in a two-volume unabridged version with notes by David Levin (Library of America). The Little, Brown edition was reprinted by Bison Books, Lincoln, Nebraska in 1997 with a new introduction by Conrad Heidenriech and Jos√© Ant√≥nio Brand√£o.  Composition and Sources  The book is largely sourced from the writings of Fran√ßois Le Mercier a principal member of the Jesuit mission to New France and held the title of Rector at the Jesuit college in Quebec and the General Superior of the missions in New France from 1653 to 1656 and again from 1665 to 1671 when he was appointed procurator and primary of the Jesuit college in Quebec which he held for a year before returning to France. Le Mercier left a large amount of records, most included in the series Relations of the Jesuits. They consist of letters or extracts of letters, as well as short stories or parts of stories from his hand. Other sources and background information is drawn from a range of French letters and articles from the era as well as historical documents. It refers often to the writings of French explorer Samuel de Champlain who was the first to explore New France and encounter the Huron people.

The mall opened in 1979 with anchor stores Goldblatt's and Montgomery Ward. Competitive and economic factors sent the mall into steady decline and national retail chains left throughout the 1990s until the mall was ultimately sold for redevelopment in 2001 then closed and largely demolished in 2002. The mall's interior stores also suffered following Montgomery Ward's remodeling. Montgomery Ward removed their mall entrance and told customers that no stores remained, when in reality close to a dozen stores were still open. A strip mall development named Century Plaza now occupies the land and some of the former anchor store buildings.  History  The mall was originally proposed in 1977 as Broadway Mall. It was to have featured 90 stores on two levels, but plans were reduced to just a one-level mall. Original anchors were Montgomery Ward () and Goldblatt's. Between its 1979 opening and 1982, it was only 70 percent leased. Simon Property Group bought the mall in August 1982, a day before Goldblatt's filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and closed its store there. Simon then split the Goldblatt building among Burlington Coat Factory and Service Merchandise. The company also converted the mall to an off-price and discount-oriented concept, similar to what it had done at Eastgate Mall in Indianapolis, Indiana and Arborland Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan. A small food court was located near the south side of the mall, located near the long corridor leading to Service Merchandise and Burlington Coat Factory. The food court contained many small local restaurants, but also included a Schoop's Hamburgers and a Subway. The mall at one time housed R-Way, a drug store located on the north side, just outside Montgomery Ward. Outlot buildings include (or included at one time) White Castle, Shakey's Pizza, Checkers Drive-in and a Shell gas station. In 1990, in cooperation with the Northwest Indiana Walkers, Century Mall opened the interior of the mall to accommodate mall walkers. Despite the initial success of the off-price format, the mall continued its economic decline. Service Merchandise relocated in 1995 to a new store roughly half a mile away at the Crossings at Hobart shopping center. Burlington Coat Factory then expanded into the former Service Merchandise space. The Montgomery Ward anchor store closed in March 2001 when the entire chain filed for bankruptcy. Century Mall and the surrounding land were purchased by Tri-Land Properties in February 2001 with the intent to convert the space to a power center. Century Plaza Under mall's new ownership, all of the then-current tenants relocated with the exception of Burlington Coat Factory. The central enclosed portion of the mall was demolished leaving only the Burlington Coat Factory and former Montgomery Wards stores standing. In June 2002, the shopping center was renamed Century Plaza to reflect the new configuration of the retail space. Developed as a strip mall with a series of big box retailers, Century Plaza now includes a small variety of national chain shops and eateries, with Old Time Pottery in the former Montgomery Ward. In March 2008, a Staples office supply store opened. In September 2010, Burlington Coat Factory moved to the nearby Crossings at Hobart and the anchor remains vacant.

Biography in The Canadian Encyclopedia Early life and education Brott was born in Montreal, into a family of professional musicians; he is the son of the violinist and composer Alexander Brott, cellist Lotte Brott and younger brother of conductor Boris Brott. He studied cello with Walter Joachim at the Conservatoire de musique du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al from 1959 to 1967. From 1964 to 1968 he studied with Leonard Rose at The Juilliard School in New York. From 1968 to 1971 he continued his training with Janos Starker at the Indiana University in Bloomington, after which he studied with Gregor Piatigorsky at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, until 1975, acting as Piatigorsky's assistant for part of his four years there. Career As a young man Brott performed as a cellist; in 1973 he won second Prize in the Munich International Cello Competition. In 1975 he became a Professor of Cello and Chamber Music at the North Carolina School of the Arts. In 1978 he became a professor at the Interlochen Arts Academy in Michigan, where he taught until 1980, when he joined the University of Toronto Faculty of Music, serving there until 1989. In 1985, Brott played a pivotal role in the creation of the Canada Council for the Arts Musical Instrument Bank which collects fine, rare string instruments to lend to Canadian musicians. In recognition of his efforts, the Instrument Bank loaned him a 1706 David Tecchler cello for his lifetime use.\\"Stradivarius on Stage\\". La Scena Musicale, by Jean-S√©bastien Gascon / June 5, 2004 Since 1989 he has been Professor of Cello and Chamber Music at the Conservatoire de musique du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al. His concert tours have taken him to four continents and he has performed at many festivals, including Marlboro, Sitka, Santa Barbara, Banff, and Toronto. He was artistic director of Festival of the Sound in 1991. Brott taught at the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara, California from 1992 until 2001. During that time he served as an international jurist at the Evian International String Quartet Competition in 1993, the Munich International ARD String Quartet Competition in 1996 and 2008, the CBC Radio National Competition for Young Performers in 1997, and the Munich International ARD Cello Competition in 1998. Brott performed for eight years with the Orford String Quartet \\"Orford String Quartet\\". The Canadian Encyclopedia, by Susan Spier, Robin Elliott, Barry J. Edwards, March 25, 2013 during which time he recorded 25 chamber music discs. In 1986 the quartet was named Ensemble of the Year by the Canadian Music Council, and their recordings of the complete string quartets of Beethoven won the Grand Prix du Disque Award in 1998 and two Juno Awards (1985, 1987) for Best Chamber Ensemble Classical Recording. Brott appeared as a guestmusician with the Emerson, Tokyo and St. Lawrence String Quartets. Brott also recorded as a solo artist; the best known of these recordings is the three Brahms Sonatas for cello and piano and Homage to Piatigorsky. The Board of Trade of Metropolitan Montreal selected Brott as one of four Great Montrealers in 2004, presenting him with the Award for Culture.Award article at the Great Montrealers website Brott held the cello chair at the Musicorda Chamber Music Institute and Festival in 2005. A recent project involves bringing music classes to Montreal area high schools, mixing classical music with rap and break dancing. Montreal Chamber Music Festival In 1990, Brott moved back to Montreal, with plans to make classical music more accessible to the public by developing an international chamber music festival. His idea gain the approval of then mayor of Montreal, Pierre Bourque. It was decided to hold the festival at The Chalet situated atop Mont Royal, half of which had been made into a park in 1876. In 1995, the first Montreal Chamber Music Festival was held at The Chalet, with Brott as the festival's artistic director. The festival organizers sought out historic locations for the performances, and planned a program of performances by internationally known chamber music artists and chamber music ensembles. The aim was to allow promising young chamber music artists to interact with established musicians and to acquire experience essential to the development of their careers, and to promote exchanges between Canadian and foreign chamber music artists, and meanwhile enhance the stature of Montreal as a centre for cultural and artistic activities. In 2006, the Festival organized a rejuvenation project in downtown Montreal, known as the \\"Quartier des festivals\\". At that time, the Festival moved to the historic St. James United Church, which had become an acoustically desirable venue after the installation of specially designed panels. In 2012 Brott performed in Orange County, California with pianist Kevin Kwan Loucks.\\"Pianist, cellist perform at Orange County Great Park\\".

This is the most common cause of greenish discharge. Mammary duct ectasia can mimic breast cancer. It is a disorder of peri- or post-menopausal age. Duct ectasia syndrome is a synonym for nonpuerperal mastitis, but the term has also been occasionally used to describe special cases of fibrocystic diseases or mastalgia or as a wastebasket definition of benign breast disease. Correlation of duct widening with the \\"classical\\" symptoms of duct ectasia syndrome is unclear. However, duct widening was recently very strongly correlated with noncyclic breast pain. Duct diameter is naturally variable, subject to hormonal interactions. Duct ectasia syndrome in the classical meaning is associated with additional histological changes. Symptoms Signs of duct ectasia can include nipple retraction, inversion, pain, and classic green-brown discharge.  Causes  Breasts are made up of fibrous connective tissues, which are made up of cells, fibers and a gel-like substance. Pathogenesis The duct widening is commonly believed to be a result of secretory stasis, including stagnant colostrum, which also causes periductal inflammation and fibrosis. However, because nonspecific duct widening is common it might be also coincidental finding in many processes. Smokers seem more often affected by duct ectasia syndrome although the reported results are not entirely consistent. The correlation with smoking status appears weaker than for subareolar abscess. Correlation with the actual duct widening is not known. Both duct widening and duct ectasia syndrome are frequently bilateral, hence systemic causes are likely involved. Diagnosis Detail of a mammography showing liponecrosis (round/oval calcifications) and plasma cell mastitis with typical rod-like calcifications Noninvasive methods to determine duct diameter in live patients are available only recently and it is not clear how the results should be compared with older results from biopsies. Histologically, dilation of the large duct is prominent. Duct widening with associated periductal fibrosis is frequently included in the wastebasket definition of fibrocystic disease. In plasma cell rich lesions diagnosed on core biopsies, steroid-responsive IgG4-related mastitis can be identified by IgG/IgG4 immunostaining. Duct Ectasia Syndrome The term duct ectasia syndrome has been used to describe symptoms of nonpuerperal mastitis, possibly associated with nipple inversion and nipple discharge. In some contexts, it was used to describe a particular form of nonpuerperal mastitis coincident with fibrocystic disease, frequently involving pasty (coloured) nipple discharge, nipple retraction, retroareolar abscess and blue dome cysts. Abscessation is not very frequent but by some definitions recurrent subareolar abscess is merely a variant of duct ectasia syndrome - abscessation would be obviously more frequent with this definition. Duct ectasia syndrome has been associated with histopathological findings that are distinct from a simple duct widening. In addition to nonspecific duct widening the myoepithelial cell layer is atrophic, missing or replaced by fibrous tissue. The original cuboidal epithelial layer may be also severely impaired or missing. Characteristic calcifications are often visible on mammographic images. Periductal mastitis, comedo mastitis, secretory disease of the breast, plasma cell mastitis and mastitis obliterans are sometimes considered special cases or synonyms of duct ectasia syndrome. Prognosis The condition is usually self-limiting, and thus not indicated for surgery. Terminology The term has several meanings on histological and symptomatic levels and on both levels usage overlaps with mastalgia, fibrocystic disease and specific sub- or superclasses of nonpuerperal mastitis. While this is not ideal for a definition it results from actual usage in international literature. Because research literature regarding duct ectasia is anything but abundant it is probably easiest to determine the exact meaning(s) intended by the respective authors on a case by case basis and this section can offer only a few hints. Typical usage in North America is a synonym of nonpuerperal mastitis, including the special cases of granulomatous mastitis, comedo mastitis, subareolar abscess with or without squamous metaplasia of lactiferous ducts and fistulation. Simple duct widening should be carefully distinguished from more complex histological changes.

Though Ling-Ai was a co-producer and sponsor of the film, she was credited as a \\"technical advisor\\" in its credits. The film, originally subtitled The Secret of Unconquerable China, was distributed in 16mm by Adventure Films and given an Honorary Academy Award at the 14th Academy Awards. United Artists acquired the film for broader distribution in April 1942 and renamed it KUKAN: The Battle Cry of China before releasing it in 35mm in August of the same year. Considered lost for many years, a print was located and partially restored at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Robin Lung produced a documentary about Li Ling-Ai, named Finding Kukan (2016)., the homepage of the documentary about Li Ling-Ai. The entire film is currently available as an extra on the DVD for Finding Kukan. Production background Scott, a St. Louis native and foreign correspondent for London's Daily Telegraph, took a handheld 16mm camera and color film to war-torn China, where he traveled from Hong Kong to the wartime capital Chongqing, and then along the Burma Road to Lanzhou. From there, he ventured to Tibet, then back to Chongqing. Throughout the film, Scott narrated his journey and detailed various ethnic groups that make up the Chinese population, including the Miao people from the mountains of Guizhou, the Muslim population of Lanzhou, the Buddhist population in Tibet, the nomads from the Gobi Desert and the Han and Manchu populations.Time Magazine review The final 20 minutes of Kukan consists of an aerial attack by Japanese bombers against the defenseless city of Chongqing from August 19‚Äì20, 1940. The bombing took up the film's final 20 minutes and showed some of the 200 tons of bombs dropped on the city. Scott captured his footage from a vantage point on the roof of the U.S. Embassy, which was near the center of the attack. Bosley Crowther, reviewing the film for The New York Times, called the sequence \\"one of the most awesome bits of motion picture yet seen in this day of frightful news events...somehow this wanton violence appears even more horrible than the scenes we have witnessed of London's destruction.\\"New York Times review The film was theatrically released in 1942. Kukan received the attention of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who saw the film at a public White House screening.Kukan on The Oscar Site Scott received an Honorary Academy Award for Kukan.

She was purchased by the Navy on 16 October 1940 from Mrs. Hiram Edward Manville of New York City. Converted to a coastal minelayer at the New York Navy Yard, and designated CMc-2 on 31 October 1940, the ship was renamed Niagara, on 12 November 1940, and reclassified as a patrol gunboat, PG-52 on 15 November 1940. She commissioned at New York on 20 January 1941, Lt. Edwin W. Herron in command. Service history=Caribbean Niagara got underway from New York on 4 February 1941 to tend units of Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron 2 operating between Miami and Key West, Florida, and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. She departed Key West on 20 March 1941 for repairs at New York and operations at the Naval Torpedo Station, Newport, Rhode Island during the summer. Pacific Niagara stood out from New York on 30 August 1941 en route to Hawaii, via Guantanamo Bay, the Panama Canal, and San Diego, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 9 October to patrol on the Hawaiian Sea Frontier. On 29 November she departed as a unit of the escort of a convoy bound to the Fiji Islands. She was at sea with the convoy when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. The gunboat returned to that port on 15 December, serving as tender to units of Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron 1 until 1 April 1942. She then escorted a convoy to San Diego en route Coco Solo, Panama Canal Zone, where she tended torpedo boats and helped to guard the approaches to the Panama Canal. During overhaul in the New York Navy Yard in the summer, she fitted out to serve at Newport, Rhode Island, as a school ship for a training squadron of motor torpedo boats. She headed for the Southwest Pacific on 27 November via the Panama Canal and the Society Islands. En route, on 13 January 1943 Niagara was reclassified as the Navy's first motor torpedo boat tender and redesignated AGP‚Äì1. Niagara arrived at Noum√©a, New Caledonia on 17 January 1943 and began tending Motor Torpedo Boat Division 23, Squadron 8. She sailed with the division on the 27th and reached her base at Tulagi, Solomon Islands on 17 February. In ensuing months, she tended the motor torpedo boats running security patrols off Guadalcanal. Attacked at Tulagi On 7 April the Japanese raided the Guadalcanal-Tulagi area with 177 planes, of which about 25 were shot down. Two bombs sank the New Zealand corvette . Niagara, in the thick of the fight, was north of the harbor, moored to the west bank of the Maliali River, heading downstream with minesweeper tied up outboard well aft. Nine enemy planes came up the river, none of them over 150 feet above the water. Niagara and Rail took them all under fire. The first plane, already aflame, crashed into trees about 1,000 yards astern of Niagara. The next two planes escaped, but the fourth rapidly lost altitude in a stream of white smoke to explode behind the hills to the north. The following two raiders passed within 150 yards and attempted to strafe the ship, but their firing was erratic and they wobbled uncertainly as they passed through Niagara's heavy fire before crashing into the woods off her port quarter The next two planes sheared up and to the right when taken under fire. One trailed light brown smoke as it disappeared close over the hilltops abaft Niagara's port beam. The other passed to starboard and crashed in the hills on her starboard quarter. Sinking of Niagara Niagara sinking on 23 May 1943. On 22 May Niagara, with Motor Torpedo Boat Division 23, departed Tulagi headed towards New Guinea. The following morning a high-flying Japanese twin- engined monoplane attacked with four bombs. The ship made a tight starboard turn at maximum speed until the bombs were released, then swung ship hard to port. Three near-misses to starboard and one to port damaged Niagara's sound gear and the training mechanism of one 3 inch gun and knocked out steering control temporarily. Half an hour later, when steering control had been regained, six more highflying twin-engine planes dropped a pattern of over a dozen bombs. One hit directly on Niagara's forecastle and several were damaging near-misses. Water rushing through a 14-inch hole 6 feet below her waterline flooded two storerooms, a passageway, and her engine room. All power and lighting failed, and her main engines stopped. Fire below decks forward was out of control, and Niagara listed rapidly to port. Her main engine and steering control were restored 7 minutes after the attack. But her increasing list and imminent danger of explosion of her gasoline storage tanks necessitated the order to \\"abandon ship.\\" and came alongside her stern to take off some of Niagara's crew. Others went over her side into rafts and boats to be picked up by other motor torpedo boats. Niagara was then ablaze from bow to bridge. Flames were spreading aft, and ammunition was exploding on deck. Yet, despite her damage, not one of Niagara's 136 officers and men was killed or seriously wounded. PT‚Äì147 launched a torpedo which struck Niagara in the gasoline tanks. She exploded with a sheet of flame 300 feet high, and went down in less than a minute. The motor torpedo boats landed her crew at Tulagi early the next morning. Awards Niagara received one battle star for World War II service.

After attending school for a few years he worked as an apprentice to a baker and developed a strong interest in natural history, also becoming skilled in taxidermy. He saw war service in Tyrol in 1866 during the Third Italian War of Independence and also served as a gamekeeper and guide before working as a taxidermist in Vienna. He married Adelheid Hawlicek on 5 May 1875.Phillipps, William John. ‚ÄúREISCHEK, Andreas‚Äù, from An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand, edited by A. H. McLintock, originally published in 1966. Te Ara - The Encyclopedia of New Zealand, updated 18-Sep-2007.Dictionary of New Zealand Biography: Andreas Reischek New Zealand Studio portrait of Andreas Reischek in expedition outfit, c. 1880 In 1877 Reischek was chosen by Ferdinand von Hochstetter to travel to New Zealand for two years to help set up displays at the Canterbury Museum in Christchurch, then under the directorship of Julius von Haast. Much of Reischek's early work in New Zealand centred on the museums in Christchurch, Auckland and Wanganui but, after his initial two-year contract was completed, he made several extended collecting expeditions over the next ten years, covering most of New Zealand and its sub-Antarctic islands, collecting biological and ethnographical specimens, including MƒÅori skulls and mummified cadavers robbed from burial sites. On his expeditions he was constantly accompanied by his dog \\"Caesar\\", who saved his life on more than one occasion.Brookes, Walter. (1958). Austria and the Maori people. Te Ao Hou 24: 38-39. Reischek collected not only for museums and private collectors, but also, and primarily, for himself. His ornithological collecting has been subsequently criticised for such reckless actions as shooting 150 specimens of the rare stitchbird on Little Barrier Island at a time when it had become extinct everywhere else.Wilson, Kerry-Jayne. (2004). Flight of the Huia. Canterbury University Press: Christchurch. He was strong, physically fit and a good linguist, becoming fluent in both English and MƒÅori. In 1885 he was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society of London. Later years When Reischek returned to Austria in 1889 he took with him a huge personal collection of over 14,000 items. Ornithological specimens alone numbered over 3000, including many of now extinct species such as the huia, and is one of the most complete in existence of New Zealand's birds. The collection was eventually bought by friends of Reischek and presented to the Imperial Natural History Museum in Vienna. Two years after his return his wife gave birth to a son, Andreas. In 1892 he was asked to superintend the establishment of the Francis-Caroline Museum in Linz, the town of his birth, where he died in 1902. He is commemorated in the name of Reischek's parakeet, endemic to New Zealand's Antipodes Islands. Bibliography Reischek's book about his travels in New Zealand, \\"Yesterdays in Maoriland\\", was compiled posthumously by his son from his diaries. It was first published in German in 1924 and was not available in an English translation until 1930.

Written by several former Confederate army officers, it featured tales of many of exploits never before told by the men of the Southern army. Along with the Southern Historical Society Papers, it helped to mold the beginnings of the \\"Lost Cause\\" philosophical movement. Matthews p.248 History Southern Bivouac traces its origins to February 7, 1879, the date on which the Southern Historical Society's Kentucky chapter was created by forty-eight former Confederate officers, most prominently General Basil W. Duke. So many individuals wanted to submit papers and speeches during their monthly meetings that by 1882 it was impossible to use them all. In order to make best use of the accumulated material, it was decided in August 1882 to found a magazine, the first issue of which was proposed for publication in September 1882. Unlike previous Southern magazines, which routinely vilified the hated Yankees, the Southern Bivouac was more \\"conciliatory\\", although it still praised the valour of the Confederate soldier and the righteousness of the Southern cause. In its first year of publication, 80% of the material was based on the Western Theater of the War, underlining its Kentucky heritage. The Southern Bivouac also tried to discredit some Northern writers. This was best seen in the efforts to discredit biographers of John Brown. Reflecting its time, the magazine also argued that blacks had no self-respect, but would eventually produce their own poets and artists.Russo, Peggy Terrible Swift Sword (Ohio University Press, 2005) pg.102Weaver, Richard. The Southern Tradition at Bay (Arlington House, 1968) pg.170,173 By January 1885, the Southern Bivouac faced financial troubles. The publishers of Home and Farm, B. F. Avery and Sons, purchased it in May 1885 and gave operational control of the magazine to Basil W. Duke and Richard W. Knott. The magazine's next issue stressed that the publication would broaden its scope to include the Southern literary tradition rather than just Southern military history. Critics praised the new direction and subscribers rose to 7,500 by the end of 1885. It also became more political, reflecting Knott's input. However, while still being a proponent of the Lost Cause, it was sometimes accused of failing to support those Southern patriots who criticized Reconstruction.Matthews pg.250 By 1887, the magazine had gained 15,000 readers, but Knott calculated it would need another 10,000 to become profitable. Thus, he sold the magazine to the Century Company, with the last issue being that of May 1887.

History Sweet Leaf Tea was founded in 1998 in Beaumont, TX by Clayton Christopher, using $10,000 and his grandmother's recipe for home-brewed iced tea made with cane sugar. Christopher was inspired to create the business after returning from a road trip throughout Alabama and Mississippi, where he saw the abundance of homemade iced tea that all the local \\"mom and pop\\" restaurants served. He could not find bottled tea on the market that tasted like homemade iced tea and thus decided to make a bottled tea as tasty as the one his grandmother Mimi used to make. In 1999, Christopher's childhood friend David Smith joined him at the company. Early production consisted of brewing tea in crawfish pots in Hen's kitchen, using pillow cases as \\"tea bags\\" and; then using garden hoses to transport the tea to plastic bottles.

He has been described as the most important psychoanalytic theorist of homosexuality in the 1950s. Biography Edmund Bergler was born in Kolomyia in 1899 into a Jewish family. Bergler fled Nazi Austria in 1937‚Äì38 and settled in New York City, where he worked as a psychoanalyst. Bergler wrote 25 psychology books along with 273 articles that were published in leading professional journals. He also had unfinished manuscripts of dozens of more titles in the possession of the Edmund and Marianne Bergler Psychiatric Foundation. He has been referred to as \\"one of the few original minds among the followers of Freud\\".Review of The Battle of the Conscience, in The Nervous Child, 1948, 7(4):449. Delos Smith, science editor of United Press International, said Bergler was \\"among the most prolific Freudian theoreticians after Freud himself\\". Summarizing his work, Bergler said that people were heavily defended against realization of the darkest aspects of human nature, meaning the individual's emotional addiction to unresolved negative emotions. He wrote in 1958, \\"I can only reiterate my opinion that the superego is the real master of the personality, that psychic masochism constitutes the most dangerous countermeasure of the unconscious ego against the superego's tyranny, that psychic masochism is 'the life-blood of neurosis' and is in fact the basic neurosis. I still subscribe to my dictum, 'Man's inhumanity to man is equaled only by man's inhumanity to himself.'\\" Bergler was the most important psychoanalytic theorist of homosexuality in the 1950s. According to Kenneth Lewes, \\"...Bergler frequently distanced himself from the central, psychoanalytical tradition, while at the same time claiming a position of importance within it. He thought of himself as a revolutionary who would transform the movement.\\" Near the end of his life, Bergler became an embarrassment to many other analysts: \\"His views at conferences and symposia were reported without remark, or they were softened and their offensive edge blunted.\\" Bergler was highly critical of sex researcher Alfred C. Kinsey, and rejected the Kinsey scale, deeming it to be based on flawed assumptions. He is noted for his insistence on the universality of unconscious masochism. He is remembered for his theories about both homosexuality and writer's block ‚Äì a term he coined in 1947. Bergler, who did more work on the subject than any other psychoanalyst, argued that all gamblers gamble because of \\"psychic masochism\\". Legacy Novelist Louis Auchincloss named his book The Injustice Collectors (1950) after Bergler's description of the unconscious masochist of that type. Bergler's Homosexuality: Disease or Way of Life? (1956) was cited in Irving Bieber et al.‚Ä≤s Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals (1962). Bieber et al. mention Bergler briefly, noting that like Melanie Klein, he regarded the oral phase as the most determining factor in the development of homosexuality. The philosopher Gilles Deleuze cited Bergler's The Basic Neurosis (1949) in his Masochism: Coldness and Cruelty (1967), writing that, \\"Bergler's general thesis is entirely sound: the specific element of masochism is the oral mother, the ideal of coldness, solicitude and death, between the uterine mother and the Oedipal mother.\\" Arnold M. Cooper, former Professor of Psychiatry at Cornell University Medical College and a past president of the American Psychoanalytic Association, said of Bergler's work: \\"I have adapted my model for understanding masochism from the work of Bergler, who regarded masochism as the basic neurosis from which all other neurotic behaviors derive. As long ago as 1949 . . . he felt, and I agree, [that the mechanism of orality] is paradigmatic for the masochistic character. Freud critic Max Scharnberg has given Bergler's writings as an example of what he sees as the transparent absurdity of much psychoanalytic work in his The Non-Authentic Nature of Freud's Observations (1993), writing that few present-day psychoanalysts would defend Bergler. Scharnberg disapprovingly notes Bergler's claim that all homosexuals \\"are subservient when confronted with a stronger person, merciless when in power, unscrupulous about trampling on a weaker person.\\" Bergler's theories, with their assumption that the preservation of infantile megalomania or infantile omnipotence is of prime importance in the reduction of anxiety, have been seen as anticipating Heinz Kohut's self psychology. Psychotherapist Mike Bundrant has based much of his work on Bergler‚Äôs early theory of psychic masochism, although Bundrant has distanced himself from Bergler‚Äôs views on homosexuality, claiming Bergler was victim to his own prejudice in this area, or simply mistaken. Bundrant discusses inner masochism in the form of ‚Äúpsychological attachments‚Äù that fit consistent patterns over time. Written works * Bergler, Edmund. (1934).

After starting his coaching career in his hometown of Warrnambool, Gleeson had his first stint in the NBL between 1997 and 2000 as an assistant coach with the Brisbane Bullets. Between 2000 and 2004, Gleeson coached in the Continental Basketball Association in the United States. After two years in South Korea, he returned to Australia in 2006 to coach the Townsville Crocodiles. Five seasons in North Queensland brought significant success, guiding the team to five consecutive post-season appearances and winning the NBL Coach of the Year Award in 2011. He then spent a season with the Melbourne Tigers and then worked with AFL clubs North Melbourne and Hawthorn before the opportunity to join the Perth Wildcats arose in 2013. Additionally, between 2014 and 2016, he served as an assistant coach for the Australian Boomers. Since joining the Wildcats, Gleeson has become the club's most successful coach, making the finals in every season and claiming five championships in 2014, 2016, 2017, 2019 and 2020. He is the only Wildcats coach to win multiple championships at the club, and in December 2019, he became the eighth coach in NBL history to reach 400 games. Early life and career Gleeson grew up in Warrnambool, Victoria, as a member of a sports-mad family with four older siblings. Gleeson played football and basketball as a youth, with the latter leading to a third-place finish at the Australian championships with Warrnambool's under 14 team. In 1985, he graduated from Warrnambool's Emmanuel College. His life change as an 18-year-old after a hydraulic door crushed his back in an industrial accident. He subsequently spent six weeks in hospital with the thought of his sporting career over. That accident was the coaching catalyst for Gleeson. In 1990, Gleeson was appointed head coach of the Warrnambool Mermaids and guided the team to the championship in the Country Victorian Invitational Basketball League (CVIBL). In 1992, he made the switch to Warrnambool's men's side, the Seahawks, where he was head coach for two years. In 1993, he earned the role of head coach of the Victorian Basketball All Star Team. In the mid-1990s, Gleeson moved to the Gold Coast to continue his studies and coach the Griffith University men's basketball program. Professional coaching career=Early years (1997‚Äì2006) While based in Queensland, Gleeson received his first opportunity in the National Basketball League (NBL), joining the coaching staff of the Brisbane Bullets as a development coach. After three years with the Bullets between 1997 and 2000, the entire coaching staff was sacked and, on a whim, Gleeson flew to Los Angeles, not knowing anyone. Working as many summer basketball camps as he could, Gleeson connected with coaches such as former NBA player Bob Thornton. It was Thornton who invited Gleeson to join him at the CBA's Quad City Thunder. After one season as an assistant coach with Quad City, Gleeson spent the 2001/02 season as an assistant coach with the Sioux Falls Skyforce. He parted ways with Sioux Falls following the season, but in January 2003, he returned to the Skyforce and took over as head coach for the remainder of the 2002/03 season. He continued on as head coach of the Skyforce for the 2003/04 season. For the 2004/05 season, Gleeson moved to South Korea to serve as an assistant coach with the Seoul Samsung Thunders of the Korean Basketball League. The 2005/06 season was then spent as an assistant with the Jeonju KCC Egis. Townsville Crocodiles (2006‚Äì2011) In 2006, Gleeson returned to Australia and was appointed head coach of the Townsville Crocodiles. The Crocodiles finished fifth on the regular season standings in each of his first three seasons, leading to quarter-final losses in 2007 and 2008, and then a semi-final appearance in 2009. The following two seasons saw the Crocodiles rise to a third-place finish in 2009/10 and then a second-place finish in 2010/11; however, both seasons ended in semi-final defeats. Gleeson's efforts in the 2010/11 season saw him earn the NBL Coach of the Year Award. Melbourne Tigers (2011‚Äì2012) For the 2011/12 season, Gleeson moved south and returned to his home state, joining the Melbourne Tigers as head coach. The three-year deal worth about $150,000 a season was a dream move for Gleeson, but the circumstances of his exit from the Crocodiles were related to a personal matter. Gleeson's wife Dawn was battling breast cancer at the time and Gleeson decided to return to home to Victoria for family support, with the Crocodiles giving their blessing to go for the Tigers job. Gleeson assembled a capable squad at the Tigers in 2011, acquiring Patty Mills due to the NBA lockout and signing former Cairns Taipans trio Daniel Dillon, Ron Dorsey and Ayinde Ubaka. While the Tigers started the season with a 5‚Äì1 record, they went on to miss the post-season with an 11‚Äì17 record. The season was derailed by Mills' defection to China early in the campaign and the sacking of Ubaka by owner Seamus McPeake in January while Gleeson was conducting a post-match press conference. In June 2012, Gleeson was sacked by the Tigers after weeks of speculation and a club review. New club owner and chief executive Larry Kestelman and new director of basketball Chris Anstey triggered an \\"investigation\\" into Gleeson's tenure, with the review revealing nothing other than Gleeson's \\"style\\" did not suit them. Stint in the AFL After parting ways with the Tigers, Gleeson remained in Melbourne and began working with Australian Football League (AFL) clubs North Melbourne and Hawthorn as a skills coach. His time at Hawthorn was the beginning of the club's golden era of success between 2012 and 2015, with Gleeson learning many coaching philosophies from future three-time premiership coach Alastair Clarkson. He learnt the importance of core sporting-team principles such as empowering players to lead a team's culture and standards. Perth Wildcats (2013‚Äìpresent)First Championship (2013‚Äì14)= In June 2013, Gleeson made his comeback to basketball after signing a three-year deal to be the head coach of the Perth Wildcats ‚Äì the NBL's most successful franchise with five championships. In the months prior to joining the Wildcats, Gleeson was close to turning his back on basketball for good. Feeling refreshed after his AFL stint, but unsure of his coaching future long term, the chance to join the Wildcats in 2013 came at just the right time. For his first season at the Wildcats, Gleeson recruited two athletic American imports in Jermaine Beal and James Ennis. After winning the NBL's preseason tournament, the Wildcats started the 2013/14 regular season with an 8‚Äì0 record. Gleeson went on to guide the Wildcats to the minor premiership with a 21‚Äì7 record, before guiding them through to the NBL Grand Final series, where they defeated the Adelaide 36ers in three games to win the championship. =Second Championship (2015‚Äì16)= After an injury-riddled season in 2014/15 saw the Wildcats earn a semi-final defeat, Gleeson was confident heading into the 2015/16 season that he had assembled the right blend of players, after conceding his side struggled with chemistry issues in 2014/15. A banged-up Perth was swept out of the playoffs in 2015 following a fourth-place finish which marked an underwhelming follow-up to its title-winning campaign in 2014. Gleeson made a conscious effort to ensure chemistry was right during the 2015 off-season. Following a large player turnover, the Wildcats were confident high-profile recruits Casey Prather and Nate Jawai ‚Äì as well as back-up guard Jarrod Kenny ‚Äì would be strong fits among the group dynamic. The Wildcats were relatively injury-free in 2015/16 and finished the regular season in second place with an 18‚Äì10 record. Gleeson went on to guide the Wildcats back to the NBL Grand Final series, where they defeated the New Zealand Breakers in three games to win his second championship in three years. He subsequently became the first two-time championship-winning Wildcats coach. =Third Championship (2016‚Äì17)= Gleeson in March 2017, after winning his third NBL championship The 2016 off-season saw Gleeson re-sign with the Wildcats on a three-year deal, while the team parted ways with Jawai, Tom Jervis and Beal. To replace them, Gleeson brought in Angus Brandt, Jameel McKay and Jaron Johnson, and headed into the 2016/17 season attempting to secure the club's first back-to- back championships since 1991. The Wildcats started the season with a 4‚Äì1 record before slumping to the bottom of the ladder in December with seven wins and nine losses. The injury toll was a key factor, as was the chemistry balance. The club's recruiting was put under the spotlight when they axed import Jaron Johnson in December for a second time‚ÄîJohnson was first axed just three games into the season in order to bring in three-point specialist Andre Ingram, who lasted only a week. Johnson was reinstated, but was then shown the door again in December as the Wildcats turned their attention to a new point guard. The Wildcats were under siege at the Christmas break, but saw a resurgence starting with a must-win game against the Illawarra Hawks on New Year's Eve. Amid the turmoil, the club assured Gleeson his job was safe, with some calling for Gleeson to be sacked himself. Then, against the odds, the Wildcats beat the Hawks, signed Bryce Cotton and their season changed. Behind import duo Cotton and Prather, and with Gleeson's vision realised, the Wildcats won eight of their remaining twelve regular season games, including two must-win encounters in the final round to squeeze into the post-season. From there, the Wildcats rolled through the finals undefeated, sweeping the Cairns Taipans in the semi-finals and then sweeping the Illawarra Hawks in the grand final series. The Wildcats went back-to-back for the first time since 1990/1991, while Gleeson became the first coach to guide the Wildcats to back- to-back championships‚ÄîCal Bruton was coach in 1990, while Murray Arnold was coach in 1991. =2017‚Äì18 season= The Wildcats started the 2017/18 season with a 10‚Äì3 record before dropping to 13‚Äì8 on 19 January 2018 with a loss to the Sydney Kings at home. The game marked Gleeson's 150th game as coach of the Wildcats. The loss to the Kings continued Perth's inconsistency, having not won consecutive games since mid-December and having lost three straight at home‚Äîthat had not happened since 2008. On 2 February, the Wildcats improved to 15‚Äì9 with a 111‚Äì90 win over the Adelaide 36ers. The win was Gleeson's 200th of his career. The Wildcats finished the regular season in third place with a 16‚Äì12 record before losing to Adelaide in straight sets in the semi-finals. =Fourth championship (2018‚Äì19)= A 130‚Äì72 loss to the NBA's Utah Jazz in the pre-season was labeled an embarrassment, with Gleeson taking the loss to heart and ensured it was used as a learning experience. It enabled Gleeson to lay the foundations to what eventually became a title-winning season. The Wildcats started the 2018/19 season with a 10‚Äì1 record before dropping to 12‚Äì9 by mid-January. The Wildcats went on to win six straight games to lock up the minor premiership before losing the regular-season finale in overtime to Melbourne United, thus finishing with an 18‚Äì10 record. Gleeson coached the team to the top of the table despite enormous adversity. Captain Damian Martin (calf), starting centre Angus Brandt (ankle) and back-up guard Mitch Norton (calf) missed large chunks of the season, while imports Bryce Cotton (thumb/hamstring) and Terrico White (hamstring/wrist) also missed games. The Wildcats were under intense external pressure to make changes to their roster, including signing a third import, after going through a slump where they lost eight out of 10 games, but Gleeson refused to budge and the players responded. He guided the Wildcats to a 2‚Äì0 win over the Brisbane Bullets in the semi- finals before a 3‚Äì1 victory over Melbourne United in the grand final series saw the Wildcats win their ninth championship, with Gleeson winning his fourth title and making history by becoming the first coach in NBL history to win four championships with one team. =Fifth championship (2019‚Äì20)= On 22 March 2019, Gleeson re-signed with the Wildcats for three more seasons. In July 2019, he joined the Indiana Pacers coaching staff for the NBA Summer League. The Wildcats dropped to an 8‚Äì5 record at the conclusion of round 9 of the 2019/20 season following a poor display against the Adelaide 36ers at home. The loss followed a dramatic drop off in the final quarter against Cairns the previous week when Perth gave up a 12-point lead to lose by seven points. The Taipans also belted them by 23 points in Perth earlier in the season, while Sydney beat the Wildcats by 19 points in November also. Gleeson subsequently admitted he was at a loss to explain why there was such a massive gap between his team's best and worst performances. Gleeson and the Wildcats responded with two big wins in round 10, first thrashing the top-of-the-table Sydney Kings at home and then defeating the South East Melbourne Phoenix in Melbourne. In December 2019, Gleeson coached his 400th NBL game, becoming just the eighth coach in NBL history to reach the milestone. After losing back-to- back games to start January 2020, Gleeson and the Wildcats decided to release import Dario Hunt and replace him with seven-year NBA veteran Miles Plumlee. The team went on to win six of the final seven games of the season to finish in second place with a 19‚Äì9 record. It marked the Wildcats' best regular season record since the 21‚Äì7 campaign in 2013/14. After defeating the Taipans 2‚Äì1 in the semi-finals, the Wildcats faced the Kings in the NBL Grand Final. In the grand final series, the Wildcats took Game 1 in Sydney before the Kings levelled the series with a win in Perth. The Wildcats went on to take a 2‚Äì1 series lead with a win in Game 3 in Sydney. Due to the coronavirus outbreak, it was decided that Games 2‚Äì5 would take place behind closed doors. Following Game 3 however, the Kings refused to take part in the final two games of the series, withdrawing citing health and safety concerns. As a result of a series cancellation and with Perth up 2‚Äì1, the NBL declared the Wildcats the champions for the 2019‚Äì20 season, with Gleeson thus claiming his fifth NBL championship. National team duties 350x350px In June 2014, Gleeson was called-up to the Australian Boomers coaching staff for the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup. He served as an assistant alongside head coach Andrej Lemanis. He continued on as Lemanis' assistant in 2015 and 2016, as he was a part of the Boomers' 2015 FIBA Oceania Championship triumph as well as their Rio Olympics campaign. Personal Gleeson and his wife Dawn have two children, son Taj and daughter Shae. Gleeson met his wife while in the United States coaching the Sioux Falls Skyforce. While living in Townsville, Gleeson urged Dawn to see a doctor after she discovered an unusual lump. A diagnosis of breast cancer followed. Dawn was cancer free for six years until in 2017 she was informed that her breast cancer had recurred. The experience not only inspired Gleeson to become an advocate for women's health, but also a Western Australian Ambassador for the Mother's Day Classic‚Äîan annual fun run and walk raising funds and awareness for breast cancer research. In 2017, Gleeson and the Wildcats launched what became an annual \\"Pink Game\\", where the team wears pink uniforms in one regular-season game to raise awareness and funds for Breast Cancer Care WA. In May 2016, Gleeson lost his brother in tragic circumstances during a family holiday.

The highest recorded maximum temperature in Tasmania is at Scamander on 30 January 2009, during the 2009 southeastern Australia heat wave. Tasmania's lowest recorded minimum temperature is on 7 August 2020, at Central Plateau. Rainfall in Tasmania is highly differentiated for a relatively compact island. It follows a complicated pattern rather analogous to that found on large continents at the same latitude in the northern hemisphere. Rainfall increases from around at Ouse in the centre to at Cradle Valley in the northwestern highlands. Sunshine is also highly differentiated, with average quotients ranging from around 4 hours a day (under 1500 hours a year) in the South West of the island, up to around 7 hours daily (2550 hours annually) in the North East around the Launceston area. It shares a similar climate to places like the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, and Canada. Climate dataRainfall Annual average rainfall for Tasmania (1961-1990) In southern Australia (which includes Tasmania), most rain falls during the winter months and is normally associated with frontal systems. Elevation also has an important influence on rainfall, with the mountain areas of western Tasmania receiving higher rainfall totals. The wettest part of the State is the west coast, where there is a strong winter maximum in rainfall: January and February typically averages only one-third the rainfall of July and August, though even in the driest months rain usually falls on every second day and the number of rainy days per year is much greater than on any part of the Australian mainland. Further east in the Lake Country, annual rainfall declines to around , whilst in the Midlands (i.e. further east again), annual rainfall is as low as at Ross and generally below . The eastern part of Tasmania has rainfall more evenly distributed throughout the year than in the west, and most months receive very similar averages. The densely populated northern coast is much drier than the western side, with annual rainfall ranging from in Launceston to in Burnie in the north west and in Scottsdale located further to the east. Most rain falls in winter, and in summer the average can be as low as per month in Launceston. The east coast is wetter than the Midlands, with an average annual rainfall ranging from in St. Helens to around in Swansea. Here the rainfall is evenly distributed over the year but can be very erratic as heavy rainfalls from the warm Tasman Sea are quite frequent. Whereas a three-day fall of occurs only once every fifty years on the north coast, it occurs on average once every four or five years around Swansea and Bicheno. On 7‚Äì8 June 1954, there were many falls as large as in two days in that area. The east coast is sometimes called the \\"sun coast\\" because of its sunny climate. In the south-east, including Hobart, Spring receives slightly more rainfall than Winter, and Spring also has slightly more rainy days than Winter. Summer Summer is from December to February when the average maximum sea temperature is . On land, maximum temperatures average to along the coast and in the lowlands, such as around Launceston. The hottest areas of the state are in the valleys west of Hobart, where summer temperatures regularly rise above . During heatwaves, temperatures in this region can rise above . The Tasmanian highlands are much cooler, with Liawenee, located on the Central Plateau, one of the coldest places in Australia with temperatures in February ranging between to . Winter Snow at Mount Wellington. The winter months are June, July, and August, and are generally the wettest and coolest months in the state, with most elevated areas receiving considerable snowfall. Winter maximums range from along the coast, to on the Central Plateau, thanks to frequent cold fronts from the Southern Ocean. Minimum temperatures however are warmer than mainland Australia, most of coastal Tasmania rarely drops below freezing and daily temperature variation is often very narrow. Elevated, inland areas can however drop below during clear nights between fronts, while during snowy weather the maximum temperature may not rise above . Spring The Spring months are September, October, and November. It is a season of frequent changes, as winter weather patterns begin to take the shape of summer patterns, although snowfall is still common in mountainous areas until October. Spring is the windiest time of the year with afternoon sea breezes starting to take effect on the coast.  Autumn  Autumn is from March to May and is a season of transition, as summer weather patterns gradually take on the shape of winter patterns. The beginning of Autumn ( March until mid-April) tend to be warmer and sunnier than Spring, particularly in Northern Tasmania. Locations=Hobart Hobart has a mild temperate oceanic climate (Cfb in the K√∂ppen climate classification), with four distinct seasons. The highest temperature recorded was 41.8 ¬∞C on 4 January 2013 and the lowest was ‚àí2.8 ¬∞C on 25 June 1972. Compared to other major Australia cities Hobart has the second least daily average hours of sunshine, with 5.9 hours. (Melbourne has the least)http://www.bom.gov.au The city rarely receives snow in winter; however, the adjacent Mount Wellington is often seen with a covering in winter, and it has received unseasonal snowfalls in all seasons, including summer. Though snow is unusual in general at sea level in Australia, Hobart has most probably had the most sea level snowfalls out of any State Capital.  Launceston  Launceston has a mild, temperate climate, with four distinct seasons ( Oceanic climate (Cfb) with some Mediterranean climate (Csb) tendencies. The city is located in the Tamar Valley and is surrounded by many large hills and mountains. With this type of topography, Launceston's weather patterns can change in a short period of time. Ouse Due to its inland location, Ouse has relatively warm summers and cool winters with a high diurnal range and low precipitation throughout the months. Frost is common in the winter. Burnie The average temperature in summer ranges from 12.5 to 21 ¬∞C with drier non-sea breeze days as warm as 27 ¬∞C, with around 16 hours of sunshine per day. In winter, temperature ranges from 6 to 13 ¬∞C, and only 8 hours of sunshine. Relative humidity averages over 60% for the year in the afternoon. Burnie averages 994 mm of rainfall per year. Most of the rain is in the second half of the year from July to December. Queenstown Queenstown has a very wet climate, and is one of the wettest locations in Tasmania with an annual average rainfall of 2408.2 mm (94.8 in), spread throughout the year. Liawenee Owing to its high altitude location on the Central Plateau of Tasmania, Liawenee is one of the few places in Australia with a subpolar oceanic climate (K√∂ppen Cfc).

Mauritania, officially the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, is an Arab Maghreb country in West Africa. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean in the west, by Western Sahara in the north, by Algeria in the northeast, by Mali in the east and southeast, and by Senegal in the southwest. It is named after the ancient Berber Kingdom of Mauretania, which later became a province of the Roman Empire, even though the modern Mauritania covers a territory far to the south of the old Berber kingdom that had no relation with it. Independence and civilian rule The political crisis in France that saw the birth of the French Fifth Republic in 1958 necessitated a new French constitution. Also adopted by the people of Mauritania in a referendum in September 1958, this new constitution provided for a French Community whose members would be autonomous republics. But status as an autonomous member of the French Community quickly lost its appeal as Mauritania witnessed the wave of nationalism sweeping the African continent. As soon as the Islamic Republic of Mauritania was proclaimed in October 1958, the Territorial Assembly changed its name to the Constituent Assembly and immediately initiated work to draft a national constitution; the document was unanimously adopted by the Constituent Assembly in March 1959 in place of the French constitution, and on November 28, 1960, Mauritania declared its independence.Warner, Rachel. \\"Independence and civilian rule\\". In Handloff. The molding of a new political entity was a challenge in a country in which the gradual breakdown of a well-entrenched tribal hierarchy and its authority was still under way. Also, Mauritania's predominantly nomadic society did not lend itself to the establishment of administrative agencies; consequently, numerous political parties formed around those leaders who already exercised tribal authority. Most of the population, who observed democratic nomadic traditions‚Äîin which influence did not always pass directly from father to son, land was not owned by individuals, and material wealth was widely distributed rather than concentrated in a few hands‚Äîeventually accepted a centralized government. With the advent of independence, party leaders recognized the need to consolidate to ensure the establishment of a strong and independent government that also represented Mauritania's regional and ethnic diversity. Consequently, there was a tendency on the part of some to try to put aside their differences. President Moktar Ould Daddah was able gradually to gain the support of numerous opposition parties because of his demonstrated willingness to include in his government those who previously had opposed him. Thus, even after Daddah charged the Mauritanian National Renaissance Party (Nahda) with corruption, banned the party from participation in the elections to Mauritania's first National Assembly in May 1959, declared the party illegal, and placed five of its leaders under arrest, Nahda still responded to Daddah's urgent appeal to preserve unity and independence. In a new election, held in accordance with provisions of the new constitution in August 1961, Nahda campaigned for Daddah, who won the election with the additional support of the black party, the Mauritanian National Union. The new government formed in September 1961 included representatives of both Nahda and the Mauritanian National Union in important ministries. This electoral, then governmental, coalition was formalized in October 1961 with the consolidation of the Mauritanian Regroupment Party, Nahda, the Mauritanian National Union, and the Mauritanian Muslim Socialist Union into the Mauritanian People's Party (Parti du Peuple Mauritanienne, PPM). On December 25, 1961, the PPM was constituted as the sole legal party. Its policies included a foreign policy of nonalignment and opposition to ties with France. In accordance with the new government's objective of acquiring support from blacks, Daddah included two blacks in his cabinet. Also, the National Assembly, headed by a black, comprised ten blacks and twenty Maures. As a final development in the emergence of a dominant single party, Daddah, the party's secretary general, further concentrated power in his hands. The PPM proclaimed Mauritania a one- party state in 1964, and the National Assembly passed a constitutional amendment in 1965 that institutionalized the PPM as the single legal party in the state. Organized opposition was henceforth restricted to channels within the party. Emerging tensions Tight control of political life by the PPM reinforced the highly centralized system. The imposition of single-party rule over a highly diverse population caused underlying tensions to emerge, especially among the southern black population, who feared Arab domination. Their fears were exacerbated by the 1966 decision to make the study of Hassaniya Arabic compulsory in secondary schools and the decision in 1968 to make Hassaniya Arabic, as well as French, an official language. Differences over linguistic and racial issues subsequently caused strikes and demonstrations by students and trade unionists in 1968, 1969, and 1971; all demonstrations were harshly repressed by the government, which in 1966 had banned discussion of racial problems. Other tensions existed among black Maures, who were still considered members of a slave class even though slavery had been outlawed under the French and by the Mauritanian Constitution. (See also Slavery in Mauritania.)Warner, Rachel. \\"Emerging tensions\\". In Handloff. Political divisions within the trade union movement also erupted, causing the movement to split in 1969 into two factions, one favoring integration into the PPM and the other lobbying for an independent form of trade unionism. The PPM, ignoring the latter faction, integrated the trade unions in 1972. Their action followed a series of strikes in late 1971, including a two-month shutdown of the iron mine operated by the Mauritanian Iron Mines Company (Soci√©t√© Anonyme des Mines de Fer de Mauritanie, MIFERMA). Soon after the integration of the trade unions, an unofficial trade union movement was formed, and in 1973 a clandestine leftist political party, the Mauritanian Kadihine Party, was created. Another clandestine group, the Party of Mauritanian Justice, was formed in 1974 and called for more political freedom. Radicalization In 1969 following Morocco's official recognition of Mauritania, the government pursued a more radical political agenda to reduce its economic dependence on France. The first major step toward this aim was taken in 1972, when the government announced that it would review the agreements signed with France at independence and would sign new, more stringent agreements on cultural, technical, and economic cooperation in 1973. New agreements on military and monetary cooperation were pointedly eliminated, and Mauritania soon declared its intention of leaving the West Africa Monetary Union and its Franc Zone and introducing its own currency, the ouguiya, with the backing of Algeria and other Arab countries. In 1974, MIFERMA, which was controlled by French interests and provided 80 percent of national exports, was nationalized and the name changed to National Mining and Industrial Company (Soci√©t√© Nationale Industrielle et Mini√®re, SNIM). Also in 1974, Mauritania joined the League of Arab States (Arab League). Finally, during the August 1975 congress of the PPM, Daddah presented a charter calling for an Islamic, national, centralist, and socialist democracy. The charter was so popular that both the Mauritanian Kadihine Party and the Party of Mauritanian Justice withdrew their opposition to the Daddah government.Warner, Rachel. \\"Radicalization\\". In Handloff. In the early 1970s, the Daddah government made some progress toward achieving national unity and economic independence. These gains, however, were more than offset by the economic hardship caused by a Sahelian drought that lasted from 1969 to 1974. Thousands of nomads migrated to shantytowns outside the cities, increasing urban population from 8 percent of the total population to 25 percent between 1962 and 1975. But other problems forced Mauritania's leaders to shift their focus from internal to external events: the decolonization of the neighboring Western Sahara at the end of 1975; the subsequent occupation of that former Spanish territory by Morocco and Mauritania; and the liberation struggle of the indigenous people of the Western Sahara, which embroiled Mauritania in a long and costly war. Conflict in the Western Sahara Until the late nineteenth century, the Western Sahara, a land inhabited by the nomadic Sahrawi people, had remained largely free of any central authority. But when competing European colonial powers embarked on their division of Africa, Spain claimed the Western Sahara. Spain historically had had an interest in the territory, primarily because it lay near the Spanish-owned Canary Islands. In 1884 Spain occupied the Western Sahara and remained until 1976.Warner, Rachel. \\"Conflict in the Western Sahara\\". In Handloff. For the first fifty years after the occupation, intermittent Sahrawi resistance to Spanish rule in what was then called the Spanish Sahara effectively forced the Spanish occupiers to limit their presence to several coastal enclaves. It was not until the 1950s, following the discovery of vast phosphate deposits at Bu Craa, that Sahrawi nationalism developed. For the first time, the Spanish Sahara appeared valuable to the indigenous population as well as to the governments of Morocco, Algeria, and Mauritania. The discovery of the deposits also renewed the historic rivalry between Algeria and Morocco, both of which encouraged Sahrawi aggression against the Spanish occupiers. In 1973 a number of indigenous Spanish Sahara groups formed an organization called the Polisario, the purpose of which was to secure independence from Spain. By the mid-1970s, the government of Spain appeared willing to relinquish the territory, which was becoming more costly to administer. In addition, the sudden collapse of Portugal's empire in Africa and the ensuing liberation of Mozambique and Angola had strengthened the determination of the Polisario to shake off Spanish colonial rule, and attacks on Spanish settlements and forts had become more intense. Morocco, Mauritania, and Algeria also orchestrated international opposition in the United Nations to continued Spanish occupation. The Spanish government finally terminated its claim to the Spanish Sahara in February 1976 and bequeathed the territory‚Äîrenamed the Western Sahara‚Äîjointly to Morocco and Mauritania, both of which consented to allow Spain to exploit the Bu Craa phosphates. Spain excluded Algeria from the withdrawal agreement, largely because Algeria intended to prevent Spain from exploiting the Bu Craa deposits, a decision which contributed considerably to the growing discord in an already troubled area. Background to Mauritanian policyThe Moroccan factor= Mauritania's role in the Western Sahara conflict was heavily influenced by perceived and real threats of Moroccan expansionism. In the 1950s, Morocco advanced its concept of Greater Morocco, which included all Mauritanian territory, based on a historic (if currently moribund) allegiance to the Moroccan sultan as a political and religious leader. To make matters worse, most of the Arab League states, the Soviet Union, several progressive African states, and groups within Mauritania, as well, supported that position. For example, Mauritanian Entente leader Horma Ould Babana had claimed that a union with Morocco would protect the rights of the Maures from encroachments by the black population.Warner, Rachel. \\"The Moroccan Factor\\". In Handloff. Even after Morocco finally had recognized Mauritanian independence in 1969‚Äînine years after it had been granted by France‚Äîand had withdrawn its claim to Mauritanian territory, the Daddah government remained suspicious of Moroccan intentions. Thus, Mauritania favored using the Western Sahara as a buffer between it and Morocco, either by controlling all or part of the Western Sahara or by creating an independent state. =Internal factors= From independence until the mid-1970s, Mauritania's policy on the Western Sahara vacillated as the government sought to balance its own interests against those of a more powerful Morocco. Until 1974 the Daddah government supported self-determination for the Western Sahara, to be exercised by means of a referendum, under the assumption that the Sahrawis would choose to join with Mauritania. This assumption was reasonable: there were close ethnic ties between the Sahrawis and the Maures; a large number of Sahrawi nomads had migrated into Mauritania; and many Maures were living in the Western Sahara. During the period from 1974 to 1975, however, after Morocco had made clear its intention of occupying the Western Sahara, Mauritania pursued policies fraught with contradictions. To please the international community, on which Mauritania depended for economic aid, Daddah continued to support policy of self-determination for the Sahrawi population. But to please the dominant Maures of Mauritania, the government reintroduced the concept of Greater Mauritania, asserting the country's rights over all of the Western Sahara. A third policy, acknowledging the reality of Moroccan power, called for a partition of the Western Sahara, which led Mauritania into a long and costly guerrilla war with the Polisario.Warner, Rachel. \\"Internal factors\\". In Handloff. The Mauritanian campaign to annex Tiris al Gharbiyya (the southern province of the Western Sahara) did not have much support within Mauritania. Some Mauritanians favored instead the full integration of the Western Sahara, while others, who identified themselves as Sahrawi refugees, supported independence. Adamantly opposing absorption was Mauritania's southern black population, which viewed the resultant increase in the number of Maures as a threat. To the blacks, the Western Sahara conflict was an Arab war. =Madrid Agreements= In early 1975, both Morocco and Mauritania agreed to abide by the decision of the International Court of Justice on the status of the Spanish Sahara, but when the court ruled in October 1975 that neither country was entitled to claim sovereignty over the territory, both governments chose to ignore the decision. In November 1975, they concluded the Madrid Agreements with Spain under which Morocco acquired the northern two- thirds of the territory, while Mauritania acquired the southern third. The agreement also included the proviso that Spain would retain shares in the Bu Craa mining enterprise. Mauritania acquiesced to the agreements under the assumption, probably correct, that Morocco, with its superior military power, would otherwise have absorbed the entire territory.Warner, Rachel. \\"Madrid agreements\\". In Handloff. Fighting the Desert War In 1976, when Mauritanian troops occupied the Western Sahara province of Tiris al Gharbiyya, as per terms of the Madrid Agreements, they were immediately challenged in fierce fighting with Polisario guerrillas. The fighting would drag on for two years, draining an already improvised economy, provoking ethnic conflict, and causing large numbers of casualties. The direct cost of Mauritania's colonial venture proved exorbitant. Mauritania rapidly increased its armed forces from only 3,000 at the beginning of 1976 to about 12,000 at the beginning of 1977; by mid-1978 the Mauritanian armed forces numbered between 15,000 and 17,000. Between 1975 and 1977, the government's expenditures increased by 64 percent, most of which was allotted for defense. This military buildup placed a heavy burden on the weak economy and diverted funds badly needed for development projects. Further alienating the population was a special defense tax, which the government levied against the entire population; despite the tax, the country was on the verge of bankruptcy by late 1977. Moreover, as the war progressed, the power of the Mauritanian military grew, contributing to internal disunity and a weak civilian government unable to solve the problems of nation building.Warner, Rachel. \\"Fighting the Desert War\\". In Handloff. Having more than 6,400 kilometers of undefended borders with Mali and Algeria, Mauritania was highly vulnerable to attacks by Polisario guerrillas, who were armed and supported by Algeria. The government's inability to protect Mauritania's major towns, even Nouakchott, which was attacked in June 1976, raised fears that Moroccan troops would move into Mauritania, ostensibly to interdict the guerrillas but also as an expansionist vanguard. There was also fear of a possible plan on the part of Morocco's enemy, Algeria, to replace the Daddah government with a puppet regime. =Involvement of foreign countries= For their part, Polisario strategists sought first to remove Mauritania from the conflict and then to direct their efforts against the far stronger Moroccan forces. In mid-1977 the Polisario launched a general offensive against Mauritania to cripple its economy and incite internal opposition to the war, hoping thereby that the government either would withdraw from the conflict or would be overthrown by one more sympathetic to the Polisario cause. In May Polisario guerrillas attacked the SNIM operations at Zou√Ær√¢t, killing two French technicians and capturing another six. The remaining expatriates at Zou√Ær√¢t immediately left, and Mauritania promptly requested aid from Morocco. In June 1977, Morocco's military command merged with Mauritania's in the Supreme Defense Council, and 600 Moroccan troops arrived to protect Zou√Ær√¢t. Following further attacks against the railroad linking the SNIM iron ore mines with the port at Nouadhibou, the Mauritanian government reversed an earlier position and requested‚Äîand received‚Äîmilitary aid from France. In December 1977, French aircraft, in their first action, attacked Polisario guerrillas returning from raids into Mauritania.Warner, Rachel. \\"Involvement of foreign countries\\". In Handloff. Several wealthy Arab oil-producing states, such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Abu Dhabi, also provided Mauritania with significant aid to contain the revolutionary fervor advocated by the Polisario. Between 1976 and 1978, Saudi Arabia, in particular, provided funds amounting to twice Mauritania's annual budget. In spite of the military aid it received, Mauritania was not able to prevent the Polisario from bombarding Nouakchott for a second time, in July 1977. The rocket attack against the capital stunned Daddah, who immediately reorganized both the army and the government, appointing for the first time a military officer to the post of minister of defense. Daddah previously had resisted bringing the military into his civilian government for fear of a military takeover. By the end of 1977, Daddah faced growing opposition to the war and to his administration. In the military, black recruits from the south, who had joined the army because they lacked other employment opportunities and who formed a majority of the ground troops, had little interest in fighting Polisario guerrillas in the north. Moreover, black civilians resented having to pay a tax to support a war between Arabs. In addition, many Maure soldiers sympathized with the objectives of the Polisario, with whom they shared ethnic ties. Finally, anti-Moroccan nationalists within the PPM opposed the war on the grounds that it afforded Morocco opportunities to expand its influence. =Overthrow of the Ould Daddah regime= Economic hardship also weighed heavily on the Daddah regime. During 1977, defense expenditures increased as international demand for iron ore (Mauritania's major source of foreign exchange, see Mining in Mauritania) fell. Drought conditions that devastated crops and herds further strained the economy. Mauritania survived only with the help of grants and loans from Saudi Arabia, France, Morocco, and Libya.Warner, Rachel. \\"Overthrow of the Ould Daddah regime\\". In Handloff. In January 1978, during a special congress of the PPM, Daddah unsuccessfully tried to seek a path out of the Western Sahara war; however, the increasingly isolated leader proved unable to undertake any diplomatic or political initiatives. In addition, relations between Daddah and senior army officers were strained because the president constantly shifted senior officers from posting to posting to guard against a possible coup. In February 1978, in a desperate move, Daddah appointed Colonel Mustapha Ould Salek to be army commander. In the late 1960s, Daddah had relegated Salek, who was suspected of pro-French leanings, to the reserve corps. (Salek had reentered active duty only in 1977, when he was made commander of the Third Military Region, at Atar, and relations between Daddah and Salek were still strained.) On July 10, 1978, the newly appointed army commander led a group of junior officers in the bloodless overthrow of the eighteen-year-old Daddah government.

It was dissolved in 1998 as part of the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. The Tobacco Institute's headquarters were kept secret from everyone except its most senior members, hence there are no references to their location in this article. Founding The Tobacco Institute was founded in 1958 as a trade association by cigarette manufacturers, who funded it proportionally to each company's sales. It was initially to supplement the work of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee (TIRC), which later became the Council for Tobacco Research. The TIRC work had been limited to attacking scientific studies that put tobacco in a bad light, and the Tobacco Institute had a broader mission to put out good news about tobacco, especially economic news. It also attacked scientific studies, although more by casting doubt on them rather than by rebutting them directly. It also lobbied Congress, although initially at a low level. Robert Hockett (first scientific director of Sugar Research Foundation, a sugar-equivalent of TIRC) became TIRCs associate scientific director. Activities=Lobbying and policy work The Tobacco Institute collected intelligence on attitudes toward smoking, developed strategies, and lobbied legislators. Allan M. Brandt wrote, \\"The Tobacco Institute, on behalf of the companies, assembled an impressive record of derailing attempts to bring tobacco under any regulatory mandates whatsoever\\". By 1978 the Tobacco Institute had 70 lobbyists, and Senator Ted Kennedy said in 1979, \\"Dollar for dollar they're probably the most effective lobby on Capitol Hill\\". The Tobacco Institute hired the Roper Organization in 1978 to survey public attitudes on environmental tobacco smoke. Among its findings were \\"Nearly six out of ten believe that smoking is hazardous to the non-smoker's health, up sharply over the last four years. More than two-thirds of non-smokers believe it, nearly half of all smokers believe it. This we see as the most dangerous development to the viability of the tobacco industry that has yet occurred.\\" A 1985 meeting of the Executive Committee of the Tobacco Institute outlined plans to broaden the indoor air quality issue. In December 1987 the Tobacco Institute's Executive Committee discussed creating an industry-based Center for Indoor Air Research, intended to broaden the question of indoor air pollution beyond tobacco smoke. The CIAR was created in March 1988 by Philip Morris, R. J. Reynolds, and Lorillard. In 1990 the Tobacco Institute opposed federal regulations banning smoking on domestic airline flights. Advertising The Tobacco Institute ran advertisements and issued pamphlets for general readers. One advertisement consisted of facing two-page advertisements titled \\"A word to smokers (about nonsmokers and anti-smokers)\\" and \\"A word to nonsmokers (about smokers).\\" The ad encourages tolerance of smokers by depicting smoking as a \\"personal choice\\" and a \\"small ritual\\". There was no mention of any health effects. An example pamphlet is Answers to the Most Asked Questions about Cigarettes. The institute also published newsletters aimed at physicians and dentists such as Tobacco and Health () and a newsletter Tobacco Observer () that seems to have been aimed at a general audience. Richard Kluger characterized Tobacco Observer as \\"attack literature.\\" White papers The Tobacco Institute published a large number of lengthy \\"white papers\\". Scanned copies of many of these are available in the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library. Many of these papers rebutted scientific reports critical of tobacco. The Tobacco Institute's response to such a report was rapid: a rebuttal was published to the 1979 Surgeon General's report on \\"Smoking and Health\\" one day before that report was issued. Another rebuttal was issued to James Repace and Alfred Lowrey's report \\"A Quantitative Estimate of Nonsmokers' Lung Cancer Risk.\\" A press release from the Tobacco Institute attacked the 1986 Surgeon General's report on second-hand smoke, saying that the Surgeon General had distorted the evidence and that Health and Human Services was suppressing contrary scientific viewpoints. There was also a longer rebuttal paper. The Tobacco Institute criticized the United States Environmental Protection Agency's 1993 report declaring tobacco smoke to be a Class A human carcinogen. Stealthy techniques In at least one case the Tobacco Institute paid for an article to be written and placed in a major national magazine while keeping their involvement secret. The article, \\"To Smoke or Not to Smoke‚ÄîThat is still the Question\\" by Stanley Frank was published in the January 1968 issue of True magazine. Frank was paid $500 by Brown & Williamson to write the article, and the Tobacco Institute paid $500,000 to Rosser Reeves to publicize the article and distribute one million copies of it. The story of the Tobacco Institute's involvement was uncovered and published by Consumer Reports. Demise By the 1990s the Tobacco Institute had lost its preeminent role in tobacco lobbying to the market leader, Philip Morris, but continued to gather intelligence on anti-smoking sentiment and legislative actions. In 1998, as part of the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, the Tobacco Institute, the Center for Indoor Air Research, and the Council for Tobacco Research were dissolved. In popular culture * Tobacco Institute was depicted in Christopher Buckley's 1994 novel Thank You For Smoking (and in the 2005 movie made from it) as the Academy of Tobacco Studies. *Dave Barry made several jokes about the Tobacco Institute in columns, mainly proposing that its scientists participate in dangerous activities.For instance, Tobacco Seems To Be A Non-ethics Area, Dave Barry, June 19, 1988, Chicago Tribune ReferencesExternal links * The Roper proposal (PDF) by Fred Panzer (Tobacco Institute vice-president) (1972-05-01) Category:Organizations disestablished in 1998 Category:Trade associations based in the United States Category:Organizations established in 1958 Category:Tobacco in the United States Category:1998 disestablishments in the United States Category:Smoking in the United States Category:Tobacco industry associations Category:1958 establishments in the United States ","title":"Tobacco Institute"},{"id":"18686736","text":"Conspirateurs starts on an empty board with a centre \\"secret meeting place\\" and 39 perimeter sanctuaries. Conspirateurs (or the English spelling Conspirators) is a two- or four-player strategy board game probably invented in 18th-century France. It perhaps dates after 1789 from the French Revolutionary Wars, \\"a period of feverish political activity with factions conspiring against each other\\" . Conspirateurs resembles Halma, Ugolki, Chinese Checkers, and Salta in that pieces jump without capturing over friendly or enemy pieces to help race to their destinations. Equipment The gameboard comprises 17√ó17 gridded lines. At the centre is a specially marked or coloured area comprising 5√ó9 intersection points representing a \\"secret meeting place\\". On the board perimeter, 39 points are specially marked or coloured to identify sanctuaries. The game pieces (men) are always placed on the points, using either marbles or pegs in holes, or flat-bottom pieces. In two-player games, each side has 20 men; in four-player games, each side has 10 men. The sets of men are distinctively coloured. Rules Play begins with an empty board. Players choose colour, with Black having the first turn. Players alternate turns. The game proceeds in two phases: # Drop phase. Players place one man per turn on any vacant point on the special 5√ó9 centre area of the board. Players may not move a man until all their men have been placed. # Move phase. Players move one man per turn to a vacant point one step in any direction orthogonally or diagonally. Or players may leap over an adjacent man (friend or foe) and land on the vacant point immediately beyond. Multiple leaps are allowed in a single turn: a man may continue to leap in any direction as long as there are jumps to be made, and may stop jumping at any point (leaps are not compulsory). A jumped man is not captured (there is no capturing in Conspirateurs). After the drop phase is completed, one of the players shouts a warning that they have been discovered, and the conspirateurs scatter to hide in sanctuaries. A sanctuary may hold at most one man. The first to bring all his men to sanctuary wins the game.

The subdued staffel scheme of black and white stripes and chevrons can be seen on the fuselage and tailplanes of most machines, which are otherwise in factory finish. An Albatros DIII wreck Flanders 1917 A Jagdstaffel (plural Jagdstaffeln, abbreviated to Jasta) was a fighter Staffel (squadron) of the German Imperial Luftstreitkr√§fte during World War I. Background Before April 1916, Die Fliegertruppen des deutschen Kaiserreiches, which had been established in 1912 as the aviation service of the Imperial German Army, was largely organised in small general purpose units (Feldfliegerabteilungen, FFA Field Flyer Detachments). The first specialist bombing and close support units began forming during 1915. The FFA were subordinate to the Army command to which they were attached.Gray & Thetford, p.ix By the end of the spring of 1915, the first German fighter aircraft were being issued in small numbers to the FFA. At this period their function was seen almost entirely as \\"protection\\" for the reconnaissance missions which were the primary duty of the Fliegertruppe. Pilots like Kurt Wintgens, Max Immelmann and Oswald Boelcke pioneered the aggressive use of the early Fokker Eindecker fighters but it was to be almost a year before the first specialist fighter units joined the Luftstreitkr√§fte. In February 1916, the first step towards fighter-only units began, with the establishment by Inspektor-Major Friedrich Stempel of units described variously as Fokkerstaffeln or Kampfeinsitzer Kommando (KEK, single- seat battle unit) formations. Fighter aircraft already in service and their pilots were detached from the general-purpose FFA units and brought together in pairs and quartets at important locations. Such units were formed at Vaux, Avillers, Jametz, Cunel and other places along the Western Front as Luftwachtdienst (aerial guard service) units, consisting only of fighters.Guttman, 2009, p. 9 This process was by no means universally welcomed, nor did it bring immediate success. By April 1916, the air superiority established by the Eindecker pilots in the Fokker Scourge had long gone and the Eindeckers were giving way to the Fokker and Halberstadt D-series biplane fighters. History In the aftermath of the Battle of Verdun, during which the German side lost the air superiority built up over the Western Front during the so-called Fokker Scourge and as a result of the superior performance of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and the French A√©ronautique Militaire during the Battle of the Somme, the German flying service was reorganised, greatly expanded and renamed the Deutschen Luftstreitkr√§fte (German Air Service) reflecting a far greater degree of autonomy, although it remained an integral part of the army and acquired a far greater number and variety of specialist units, including Jagdstaffeln (hunting squadrons), the first German single-seater fighter units.Cheesman, p.12 A target was set to establish 37 new squadrons in the next 12 months, equipped with up-to-date single-seat fighters and manned by specially selected and trained pilots, to counter the successes of the Allied fighter squadrons operated by the RFC and the French A√©ronautique Militaire. Boelcke, the leading fighter pilot of the day, was called on to organise the manning, equipment and training of Jasta 2 which was to become the model for these new squadrons. Initially Jasta 2 was equipped with a motley collection of fighters, including early Fokker and Halberstadt \\"D\\" types. In September, the squadron began to receive the first Albatros D.I fighters, that created the German air superiority of the first half of 1917. Boelcke was killed in an aerial collision on 28 October but his tactics, especially formation flying and a combination of aggression and prudence known as the Dicta Boelcke, remained the core of Jagdstaffel practice in the Luftstreitkr√§fte fighter arm for the rest of the war. Several pilots of Jasta 2 trained by Boelcke, became fighter leaders, notably Manfred von Richthofen.Gray & Thetford, pp. xxviii‚Äìxxix By April 1917, the Jagdstaffeln had established air superiority on the Western Front (known since as Bloody April and still regarded as the most disastrous period in the history of British military aviation). This ascendancy was not to last, as new allied fighters (most famously, the S.E.5a, the Sopwith Camel and the SPAD S.XIII) were already starting to come into service, all of which more than matched the last of the Albatros fighters to see squadron service, the disappointing D.V/D.Va.Gray & Thetford, p. xxx The Jagdstaffeln concentrated on hindering the work of the Allied two-seater corps reconnaissance and bombing squadrons. Offensive incursions by fighters any distance behind Allied lines were avoided, as were mass confrontations with large allied fighter formations, on the grounds that such operations risked attrition that the Luftstreitkr√§fte could ill-afford.Shores, p. 14 Publicity for successful German fighter pilots and the cult of the Air ace rapidly established the status of their squadrons as elite units, which became associated with the kingdoms of the German Empire. Most Jagdstaffeln (eventually about 67 of them) were considered to be Prussian while other such units were associated with Bavaria, Saxony and W√ºrttemberg. The Bavarian Jagdstaffeln in particular were associated for organisational and supply purposes with the (theoretically independent) Bavarian army, which did not add to overall efficiency in these departments. Shacklady & Treadwell, 2002, p.97 To obtain a local and temporary air superiority, larger fighter units were established, composed of several Jagdstaffeln, known as Jagdgeschwader and Jagdgruppen (Fighter Wing and Fighter Group). These units were moved from one section of the front to another as the tactical situation demanded. The most famous of these units was Jagdgeschwader 1 composed of Jagdstaffeln 4, 6, 10 and 11, commanded by Richthofen until he was killed, many of which flew the supremely manoeuvrable Fokker Dr.I triplane from the autumn of 1917.Gray & Thetford, p.xxx By March 1918, there were 80 Jagdstaffeln in the Luftstreitkr√§fte, most of them equipped with Albatros D.Vs. A long overdue re-equipment with new types began, most notably the Fokker D.VII, which for the first time since mid-1917, gave the Jagdstaffeln equipment that matched their opponents'. Personal colour schemes German aircraft left the factory in a standard finish, although this differed from one manufacturer to another. Clear varnish on fabric and wooden surfaces had changed by 1916 to various camouflage schemes. In the Jagdstaffeln this gave way to a riot of colour, as pilots repainted their machines as they pleased. In January 1917, when he took over Jasta 11, Richthofen celebrated by painting his Albatros red and the squadron followed suit, painting at least part of their machines red. Other Jagdstaffeln soon adopted the fashion until few fighters flew in the manufacturers' finish, their fuselages in particular at least sporting the pilot's monogram or perhaps his favourite colour(s), even if the wings (as was often the case) remained in camouflage. A squadron theme was sometimes followed, with machines decorated in similar colours or with similar motifs but generally personal preference seems to have been prevalent.Robertson pp.61‚Äì62 More than one pilot (on both sides) recorded that the contrast with the plain khaki of RFC fighters was helpful in rapidly distinguishing friend from foe in the hurly- burly of a dogfight and might have aided the accreditation of air victories claimed by individual German pilots.

It tells the story of a father bear trying to repair the roof of his house. The second entry in a three-cartoon series, it was preceded in 1939 by Goldilocks and the Three Bears and was followed by Papa Gets the Bird in 1940. Plot Mother Bear is singing happily as she cleans the house. Upon entering a room she notices light coming in through a hole in the roof. Annoyed that it has not yet been fixed, she calls to Father bear, disturbing him from his nap in a hammock. As he insists that it isn't going to rain that day the sky suddenly clouds over and a thunder storm rapidly approaches. He reluctantly goes inside to inspect the hole, plugging it with his finger to demonstrate that water wouldn't come in through such a small opening. Waiting until his wife has left, Father tries to remove his finger, only to find that it has become stuck. He manages to release it whilst also bringing down a section of the roof on his head, leaving a now massive hole. His attempts to set to work are hampered by a series of clumsy mishaps which infuriate him further. Poking her head into the room, Mother tells Father to relax and count to 10, an exercise which ends with him covered in red paint from a paint can that he furiously kicked. Downstairs in the kitchen, Mother tells their son, Wilbur, to fetch Father a drink of water from the well, as Father struggles to get out onto the roof without damaging it further. The storm finally hits and he is caught in a deluge of rain, as well as struggling with lightning and fierce winds that blow the roof tiles into massive ‚Äòwaves‚Äô. He falls through the roof into a bedroom that is now completely filled with water. Hearing his son's offers of more water and his wife's incessant singing drift up through the house Father climbs into an underwater bed and, despondent, pulls a blanket over his head as the cartoon ends.

Mauritania, officially the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, is an Arab Maghreb country in West Africa. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean in the west, by Western Sahara in the north, by Algeria in the northeast, by Mali in the east and southeast, and by Senegal in the southwest. It is named after the ancient Berber Kingdom of Mauretania, which later became a province of the Roman Empire, even though the modern Mauritania covers a territory far to the south of the old Berber kingdom that had no relation with it. Military withdrawal from the Western Sahara Under Mustapha Ould Salek, a twenty-man junta calling itself the Military Committee for National Recovery (Comit√© Militaire de Redressement National, CMRN) assumed power. The CMRN was a centrist, moderate, pro-French and pro-Moroccan regime, whose first mandate was to bring peace to Mauritania. The Polisario, which believed Mauritania would withdrew from the war if given the opportunity, declared a unilateral cease-fire, which the CMRN accepted at once.Warner, Rachel. \\"Military withdrawal from the Western Sahara\\". In Handloff. Salek and the CMRN then directed its collective diplomatic attention to Morocco, whose troops were still thought necessary to protect the operations of the National Mining and Industrial Company (Soci√©t√© Nationale Industrielle et Mini√®re, SNIM) and thus enable the Mauritanian economy to recover. Following Morocco's lead, the CMRN opposed the creation of a new, independent state in the Western Sahara, although Salek did not rule out the possibility of a federated state with limited autonomy. In the meantime, while Polisario guerrillas and Moroccan troops continued to fight, the Mauritanian Army withdrew from active participation in the war, although the CMRN was constrained from signing a peace treaty in order to placate Morocco. Within a short time, however, Polisario leaders had become increasingly impatient with Mauritania's inability to make a conclusive commitment to peace, and in April 1979 they demanded the evacuation of Mauritanian troops from Tiris al Gharbiyya as a precondition for further talks. Downfall of Ould Salek The difficulties facing the Salek government multiplied and soon proved to be insurmountable. His regime failed to overcome Morocco's resistance to any settlement of the Western Sahara conflict. The death of Algerian president Houari Boumediene in December 1978 further heightened tensions. Also, Senegalese president L√©opold S√©dar Senghor, who was displeased with Salek's ties with Morocco, instigated a press campaign that highlighted racial problems in Mauritania. Salek did little to ease the racial problem when, in March 1979, he named eighty-one Maures and only seventeen blacks to his new national advisory committee. Finally, the French government lost confidence in Salek's ability to extricate Mauritania from both the Western Sahara war and Moroccan influence. Isolated and weak, Salek's government was overthrown on April 6, 1979, by Colonel Ahmed Ould Bouceif and Colonel Mohamed Khouna Haidalla, who formed the Military Committee for National Salvation (Comit√© Militaire de Salut National, CMSN). Salek, however, was permitted to remain in the government as a figurehead president. In late May, Bouceif was killed in an airplane crash; Haidalla was designated prime minister, and Colonel Mohamed Louly was named president.Warner, Rachel. \\"Downfall of Ould Salek\\". In Handloff. The Haidalla regime Like its predecessor, the CMSN sought first to negotiate peace with the Polisario without sacrificing its friendly ties with Morocco and France. In its domestic policies, the Maure-dominated CMSN embittered both black and Maure civilians because it refused to share power with either group. In addition, the government insisted on using Arabic exclusively in the secondary schools, provoking a wave of student protests in April 1979.Warner, Rachel. \\"The Haidalla regime\\". In Handloff. In July 1979, its patience exhausted, the Polisario ended its cease-fire. Confronted with endless warfare and total economic collapse, the CMSN on August 5 signed a peace treaty in Algeria with the Polisario, according to which Mauritania renounced all territorial and other claims over the Western Sahara. The Polisario, in return, renounced all claims regarding Mauritania. Most significant, Mauritania recognized the Polisario as the sole legitimate representative of the people of the Western Sahara, although in an effort to convince Morocco of its neutrality in the conflict, it did not recognize the Polisario's governing arm, the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). The CMSN government also agreed to withdraw from Tiris al Gharbiyya. However, just a few days after the signing of the peace treaty, Morocco occupied Tiris al Gharbiyya, rendering the issue moot and threatening the peace. Consolidation of power In Mauritania, Haidalla was faced with the daunting task of consolidating power. To his credit, in January 1980 he proclaimed Mauritanian neutrality in the Western Sahara conflict and convinced Morocco to evacuate all its troops from Mauritanian soil. From the beginning of his regime, however, Haidalla was viewed with hostility by the southern black population; a native of the Western Sahara, he was perceived by the blacks as an Arab and a northerner. He was also mistrusted by pro-Moroccan political groups because he had signed the peace treaty with the Polisario. To ensure strict Mauritanian neutrality in the ongoing conflict, he reshuffled the top echelons of the government, removing both pro-Moroccan and staunchly pro-Polisario factions. He also assumed the title of president and removed Louly and CMSN vice president Ahmed Salem Ould Sidi from office, thereby eliminating all serious political competitors.Warner, Rachel. \\"Consolidation of Power\\". In Handloff. Haidalla initiated several important policy changes to broaden his base of support. In 1980, to further strengthen his position with Mauritania's blacks and to undercut black opposition groups in Senegal, he officially abolished slavery. In December 1980, in the face of growing apprehension among CMSN members, he formed a civilian government, naming Sid Ahmed Ould Bneijara prime minister. He also initiated steps to draft a constitution establishing a multiparty, democratic state. Among Mauritanians both inside and outside the country, however, political opposition to Haidalla grew. In May 1980, following Haidalla's dismissal of Louly and Sidi, a number of foreign-based opposition movements joined together in France to form an opposition group called the Alliance for a Democratic Mauritania (Alliance pour une Mauritanie D√©mocratique, AMD). The AMD wanted to restore civilian rule and introduce a multiparty democracy in Mauritania. Its principal political supporter was former President Moktar Ould Daddah, who as a result of French pressure had been released from prison in August 1979. Also joining the AMD was former Vice President Sidi. The AMD received financial support from those Arab states of the Persian Gulf that opposed Haidalla's anti-Moroccan leanings‚Äîhe had moved to eliminate pro-Moroccan members of the CMSN‚Äîand his support of self- determination for the radical SADR. The same Arab states also reduced their aid to Mauritania, which only encouraged Haidalla to strengthen ties to more radical Arab countries like Libya and Iraq. Meanwhile, relations with Morocco continued to deteriorate. Discord between the two countries had been mounting since early 1981, when Morocco accused Mauritania of sympathizing with the Polisario and harboring its fighters. Morocco was also responsible for rumors suggesting that Libya was shipping arms to the guerrillas via a landing strip at Chegga in northeastern Mauritania. On March 18, 1981, pro-Moroccan members of the AMD led by Sidi and former air force commander Mohamed Abdelkader attempted to topple the government. The coup failed, and both were subsequently executed. In April, following the attempt, Haidalla and the CMSN decided to abandon civilian rule and replaced the fledgling constitutional government with a six-member military government headed by Colonel Maaouiya Ould Sid Ahmed Ould Taya. As Mauritania's relations with Morocco worsened, its ties with Algeria improved. Algeria cultivated a friendship with Haidalla and supplied him with sophisticated military equipment, ostensibly to deter invasion from Morocco. In June 1981, in an effort to restore diplomatic relations with Morocco, Haidalla agreed to a summit meeting to be arranged and hosted by Saudi Arabia, one of Mauritania's largest aid donors. At the summit, Morocco's King Hassan II and Haidalla signed an agreement restoring diplomatic relations and prohibiting the transit through either country of forces hostile to the other. This last provision alluded to both the Polisario and the Moroccan branch of the AMD. The reconciliation, however, was short lived. On the one hand, Morocco refused to expel AMD members, and on the other hand King Hassan accused Mauritania of allowing Polisario guerrillas to launch attacks against Morocco from Mauritanian base camps. Subsequently, Moroccan aircraft bombed the Mauritanian city of Bir Aidiat near the border with the Western Sahara, where Polisario guerrillas had taken refuge, and threatened further reprisals against Mauritania. In February 1982, former CMSN president Salek and former Prime Minister Bneijara, among others, tried unsuccessfully to oust Haidalla. Having survived a second coup attempt, Haidalla relied on his forceful personality, self-discipline, and integrity to gain the respect of many of his countrymen. The eleven-month period between February 1982 and January 1983 gave the regime the opportunity to politicize the population. Haidalla hoped that by establishing a working foundation of civilian politics he could abolish the military regime and be elected to office as a civilian. Accordingly, in 1982 the government organized what were labeled Structures for Educating the Masses (Structures pour l'Education des Masses‚ÄîSEM), which acted on a range of public issues through elected delegates. Haidalla also pursued his goal of national reconciliation by releasing some of the political prisoners incarcerated since the overthrow of the Daddah regime. Domestic peace was shattered briefly in January 1983, first when Haidalla discovered a coup plot supported by Libya and, later, when a Moroccan gunboat attacked a Mauritanian garrison near La Guera, the only Western Sahara territory still occupied by Mauritania. Although neither incident caused any casualties or serious diplomatic repercussions, the Moroccan attack demonstrated Mauritania's continuing vulnerability. Haidalla responded to these incidents by strengthening relations with France; the latter had already been instrumental in reestablishing communication between the Mauritanian and Moroccan governments following their 1981 break. The more significant diplomatic movement, however, saw Haidalla develop warmer relations with Algeria and the SADR. During the June 1983 summit meeting of the Organization of African Unity in Ethiopia, Haidalla joined Senegalese president Abdou Diouf and Ethiopian leader Mengistu Haile Mariam in drafting a resolution calling for a cease-fire and peace negotiations in the Western Sahara. Morocco failed to comply with the resolution by the end of the year, and Haidalla recognized the SADR in February 1984. The January 1983 Libyan-supported coup plot had soured relations between Mauritania and Libya; however, Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi, a strong supporter of the Polisario, took advantage of Mauritania's break with Morocco and began a new campaign to reestablish cordial ties with Haidalla. Haidalla's warming relations with Libya, Algeria, and the Polisario, however, alienated the conservative Arab countries on which Mauritania depended for most of its economic aid and also factions in his own government, which favored ties to Morocco, and those who opposed the existence of the SADR. Moreover, Haidalla angered many CMSN members by his decision to recognize the SADR without consulting them. More ominous was Morocco's movement of troops toward Mauritania's northern border in the aftermath of Mauritania's recognition of the SADR. The presence of thousands of Moroccan soldiers on the Mauritanian border, only four kilometers from Mauritania's key economic center at Nouadhibou, again raised the possibility of another Moroccan attack on La Guera. In addition, Morocco had begun to construct a berm near the Mauritanian border that would restrict Polisario guerrillas to Mauritanian territory for their rear bases, thus providing Morocco with justification for attacking northern Mauritania. Political disintegration By 1984 the Haidalla regime was under siege not only for its regional policies but also for corruption and mismanagement, especially within the SEMs, which were viewed by the population as vehicles for advancing the president's own interests. Furthermore, upheavals in the military compromised the loyalty of key officers, particularly at a time when the army was being asked to perform the impossible task of protecting Mauritania's vast northern regions from Morocco's attacks across the border. A severe drought compounded the regime's difficulties, forcing much of the population into the country's few urban areas and increasing Mauritania's dependence on foreign economic aid.Warner, Rachel. \\"Political disintegration\\". In Handloff. In the third ministerial purge in six months, Haidalla named himself prime minister in March 1984 and took over the defense portfolio. Taya, who had held both positions, was demoted to chief of staff of the armed forces. The move infuriated Taya's allies on the CMSN. As chairman of the CMSN, Haidalla was supposed to represent a collective body. Instead, he attempted to amass considerable personal power and alienated many in the top echelons of government. On December 12, 1984, while Haidalla was out of the country, Taya, in a quiet and bloodless coup d'√©tat, became Mauritania's president. 1985-1991 In April 1986, the Manifesto of the Oppressed Black Mauritanian (Manifeste du n√©gro-mauritanien opprim√©), which documented discrimination against Mauritania's black populations in every sector of public life, was published by the African Liberation Forces of Mauritania (FLAM; Force pour la Liberation Africaine de Mauritanie). In response, in September 1986, 30 to 40 black intellectuals suspected of involvement in the publication of the Manifesto were arrested and subjected to brutal interrogations. They were not allowed visitors until November 1987. In the meantime, the authorities cracked down on black communities, often using mass arrests as a form of intimidation.Mauritania‚Äôs campaign of terror In October 1987, the government allegedly uncovered a tentative coup d'√âtat by a group of black army officers, backed, according to the authorities, by Senegal.Mauritanie 1945‚Äì1990 ou l'√âtat face √† la Nation, Pierre Robert Baduel, Revue du monde musulman et de la M√©diterran√©e, 1989, Volume 54, pp. 11‚Äì52. Fifty one officers were arrested and subjected to interrogation and torture.Mahamadou Sy, L'enfer d'Inal. Mauritanie l'horreur des camps, ed. L'Harmattan, Paris, 2000 The torture consisted of ‚Äúbeatings, burns, electric shocks applied to the genitals, stripping prisoners naked and pouring cold water over them, burying prisoners in sand to their necks, and subjecting prisoners to jaguar, which consists of tying a victim‚Äôs hands and feet, suspending him upside down from a bar, and beating him particularly on the soles of the feet‚Äù.Human Rights Watch World Report 1992: Mauritania They were accused of ‚Äúendangering the security of the State by participating in a conspiracy to overthrow the government and to provoke killing and devastation among the inhabitants of the country‚Äù and tried following a special summary procedure. Three of the officers arrested in October were sentenced to death; eighteen were sentenced to life imprisonment (including two who died in detention in 1988); nine were sentenced to twenty years; five were sentenced to ten years; three were given five years; six were given five-year suspended sentences with heavy fines; and seven were acquitted. None of those convicted were permitted to appeal. The discord between conflicting visions of Mauritanian society as either black or Arab, again rose to the surface during the intercommunal violence that broke out in April 1989 (the \\"1989 Events\\"), when a Mauritania-Senegal border dispute escalated into violence between the two communities. In villages of the South, blacks were indiscriminately expelled by security forces, who forced them to cross the Senegalese River to Senegal, taking their identity card and their belongings. Those who resisted or who tried to flee with their belongings were arrested, imprisoned and sometimes executed. In the larger towns and cities, the authorities targeted black civil servants, employees of private institutions, trade unionists, former political prisoners and, in some instances, the wives of political prisoners.Amnesty International, Mauritania: Human rights violations in the Senegal river valley, 2 October 1990 Tens of thousands of black Mauritanians fled or were expelled from the country, and many remain in Senegal as refugees. This is also where the black Mauritanian movement FLAM is based. Although tension has since subsided, the Arab-African racial tension remains an important feature of the political dialogue today. The country continues to experience ethnic tensions between its black minority population and the dominant Mauri (Arab-Berber) populace. A significant number from both groups, however, seek a more diverse, pluralistic society. References=NotesWorks cited *Handloff, Robert E., editor. Mauritania: A Country Study.

The area is east of the municipality of Saint-Dominique-du-Rosaire, north of La Morandi√®re, Rochebaucourt and the parish municipality of Senneterre, and west of the city of Senneterre.GeoSearch 2006 The eponymous Lake Despinassy is the territory's largest lake and is named after the geographic township of Despinassy. This name was already assigned to the area in 1911 and comes from Louis-Auguste- Victor Despinassy, a lieutenant of the Royal Artillery and Engineers Corps in General Montcalm's army. The township is swampy, mostly forested, and flat, not exceeding above sea level. The Hurault and Lavigne Creeks, as well as the Despinassy and Laflamme Rivers, flow through the territory, while the Bell River forms its eastern boundary. A few kilometres west from Lake Despinassy along Route 397 is the hamlet of Despinassy (), the territory's only population centre.

Because of the unique and varied architecture in the Drake Park neighborhood and its close association with the early development of the city of Bend, the area was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Location The Drake Park Neighborhood Historic District is located in Bend, Oregon. It includes 17 city blocks with 83 individual residential lots. The streets that constitute the boundaries of the district are Riverside Boulevard on the north and west next to Drake Park; Tumalo Avenue on the south; Broadway Street on the southeast; and Franklin Avenue on the northeast corner.\\"Verbal Boundary\\" , Drakes Park Neighborhood Historic District, National Register of Historic Places, National Park Service, United States Department of Interior, Deschutes County, Oregon, 22 March 2005. The district is above sea level. The area is relatively flat, sloping gently to the west towards the Deschutes River which runs through Drake Park. Large Ponderosa Pine trees are scattered throughout the district. Many retaining walls and other landscape elements in the neighborhood are made of local basalt fieldstone.\\"Drakes Park Neighborhood Historic District Narrative Description\\", National Register of Historic Places, National Park Service, United States Department of Interior, Deschutes County, Oregon, 22 March 2005. History In 1910, Alexander M. Drake, owner of the Pilot Butte Development Company, subdivided the land that is now Drake Park Neighborhood Historic District into residential lots. The area was laid out south of a curving boulevard that followed the Deschutes River. Lots in the subdivision originally sold for $100 to $250, equivalent to $ to $ today. In 1921, along the river, adjacent to the subdivision, were sold to the city of Bend to create Drake Park.\\"History and Context\\", Drakes Park Neighborhood Historic District, National Register of Historic Places, National Park Service, United States Department of Interior, Deschutes County, Oregon, 22 March 2005. That same year, State Street was the third street in Bend to be paved. The spacious lots were considered highly desirable because they were close to Drake Park, which runs along the east side of the Deschutes River. In addition, many home sites had choice views of the Cascade Mountain peaks. The area was only a block away from Bend's downtown business district so the city hall, public library, and local Catholic, Methodist, and Episcopalian churches were within easy walking distance. The district was also within walking distance of the Brooks-Scanlon and Shevlin-Hixon lumber mills. As a result, the Drake Park district quickly became the preferred neighborhood for the city's most prominent businessmen. Mirror Pond from Drake Park along the Deschutes River.Over the years, residents of the district included many prominent business and civic leaders who contributed to the development of the city of Bend and helped make it the commercial hub of central Oregon. The residents included owners and managers of the city's large lumber mills; owners of downtown businesses, hotels, and other enterprises; and professional men and women. In addition, many of the city's mayors, city council members, and Deschutes County commissioners lived in the neighborhood. With the exception of three houses, all the homes in the historic district were built between 1910 and 1954. The homes in the Drake Park Neighborhood Historic District are unique, and the area's development parallels the growth of Bend as the city grew from 536 people in 1910 to over 11,000 in 1950. As a result, the Drake Park neighborhood was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.\\"Drake Park Neighborhood Historic District\\", National Register of Historic Places, www.nationalregisterofhistoricalplaces.com, 31 July 2008. Architecture There are 110 contributing structures on 83 residential lots within the boundary of the Drake Park Neighborhood Historic District. The district has an unusually high concentration of diverse architecture with unique cultural value. The neighborhood also has maintained its architectural integrity with eighty-one percent of the homes and sixty-five percent of the non-residential structures contributing to its historic value. Most of the houses built between 1910 and 1919 are American Craftsman style homes. In the early 1920s, a number of American Colonial style homes were built in the neighborhood; however, Craftsman-style homes continued to be popular as well. Beginning around 1925, other architectural styles were introduced to the neighborhood, including Tudor, English Cottage, Cape Cod, Dutch Colonial, and Colonial Revival Style architectureSpanish Villa designs. During the 1930s very few homes were built, but those that were reflected a variety of tastes. In the 1940s, the residents tended to favor more modern designs. The last two historic homes, both built in the 1950s, are a California Ranch style design and a post-war modern tract house. Since 1954, the neighborhood has remained relatively stable and has retained its architectural integrity. A total of fourteen architectural styles are represented in the district. Four houses within the district were previously listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

He had two younger siblings: a brother called Gaius Julius Alexander Berenicianus and a sister called Julia Iotapa. Surviving inscriptions on his family reveal that his family were related to important members of Asian, non- Jewish and Jewish aristocracy. He was of Jewish, Nabataean, Edomite, Greek, Armenian, Medes and Persian origins. His paternal grandparents were King Tigranes VI of Armenia and his wife Opgalli. Through Tigranes, he was a descendant of King Archelaus of Cappadocia, King of Judea Herod the Great and his wife Mariamne. Agrippa along with his family and paternal relatives were among the last known descendants of the Herodian Dynasty. He was an apostate to Judaism. It is unlikely that Agrippa attempted to exert influence on Judean Politics. His name indicates that the family connections from the Herodian Dynasty were not wholly broken. His maternal grandparents were King Antiochus IV of Commagene and Queen Julia Iotapa. The Kingdom of Cetis was a small client state in the Roman Empire. Cetis was a small region in Cilicia that was previously ruled by his Cappadocian royal ancestors and Antiochus IV. The city in Cilicia Elaiussa Sebaste was a part of the Kingdom. When his parents married in Rome in 58, then Roman Emperor Nero crowned his parents as monarchs and gave them that region to rule. He was born, raised and educated in Cetis. There is an honorific inscription dedicated to him as a ‚Äòson of King Alexander‚Äô. In 94, Agrippa along with his brother Berenicianus entered the Roman Senate. Surviving inscriptions also reveal the career of Agrippa. Agrippa became and served as a Quaestor for the Roman Province of Asia. Before 109, Agrippa served as a Praetorian Guard, before his father reached and served as a consul or suffect consul. Agrippa married a Roman woman who belonged or was related to the Fabia (gens). From this marriage Agrippa had two sons, a younger Gaius Julius Agrippa and Lucius Julius Gainius Fabius Agrippa. A possible descendant from his family was the usurper of the 3rd century Jotapianus.

They were signed to Forefront Records / EMI CMG until Spring 2010. Their debut album, Attention, was released on August 25, 2009. They released two independent EPs before breaking up in August 2012. History Philmont was formed by Scott Taube, Josiah Prince, Abe Hege, and Matthew Arcaini in Summer of 2005. They recorded their independent debut EP Take Cover in December of that year. One year later, Philmont traveled to Eudora, Kansas to record their Photosynthetic EP at Black Lodge Studios with Ed Rose.iChannel Bio Matthew Arcaini, who left the band after Take Cover, produced a track on the Photosynthetic EP as well. The band has also recorded some demos in 2005. Philmont released Photosynthetic independently on March 6, 2007 at Tremont Music Hall in Charlotte. That July, after adding Justin Sams on bass, the band performed at the 2007 Cornerstone Festival in Bushnell, Illinois, where they were discovered by representatives of EMI-CMG. Philmont showcased for the label group that Fall, and were soon offered a recording contract with Forefront Records.http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/news/North_Carolina_Punks/31229/p1/ Cross Rhythms Article Hege unexpectedly left the band just before the signing was to take place. Todd Davis had played in a band with Josiah prior to Philmont, and was recruited on short notice. Philmont signed the deal a few days before Christmas 2007. After signing with Forefront, the band spent several months writing songs in preparation for recording their first full- length album. They spent April and May 2008 recording twelve songs in Nashville, Tennessee with producer Rob Hawkins. The five-song Oh Snap EP was digitally released on August 19, 2008, and physically released on April 21, 2009. Their first single \\"I Can't Stand to Fall\\" was released to CHR and Christian Rock Radio in July 2008. Philmont released their debut full-length Attention on August 25, 2009. In September 2008, a music video for EP song \\"The Difference\\" was released to YouTube. The band filmed and directed the entire video themselves, as documented in a \\"behind-the-scenes\\" video, also available on YouTube. The music video has gained exposure on TV programming such as Steelroots, JCTV, The Merge, and Gospel Music Channel; it was included in the Spring 2009 video playlist for American Eagle stores nationwide, and was also featured on the X 2009 CD/DVD compilation. Four other self-made music videos have been released since then, for the songs \\"I Can't Stand to Fall\\", \\"Back Down\\", \\"Another Name\\", and \\"My Hippocratic Oath\\". All the music videos can be seen on YouTube, and are included with the purchase of Attention on iTunes. Philmont has toured internationally in support of Attention with many bands including Family Force 5, Fireflight, Pillar, This Beautiful Republic, Eleventyseven, Addison Road, Wavorly, and Capital Lights. Philmont added Josh Guion as a touring bassist in late 2009, moving Justin to rhythm guitar and Scott to vocals-only. In a post on the official Philmont blog, March 3, 2010, Todd Davis announced his departure from the band, describing the events of his final show with his bandmates. After Todd's departure, Philmont recruited Nashville drummer, Scott Sellers as a brief fill-in before announcing permanent drummer Jeremi Hough, as well as the promotion of Josh Guion to band member. On August 11, 2010 the band put out a new single, \\"You Will Remain\\", on iTunes independently, after their departure from Forefront Records. Philmont started an online fundraiser through Kickstarter in September to help finish The Transition EP, as mixing and mastering still needed completion and the band lacked funding. People who donated through the website received various Philmont rewards based on how much they donated. The Transition EP was released on October 19. On March 11, 2011 they released the music video for \\"Closer\\". On July 28, 2011 Jeremi Hough left to get married and to move on. On October 5, 2011 the lead singer of Philmont said on a blog that they would release videos of some NEW demos. On November 12, 2011 Philmont said that they finished vocals for a demo titled \\"Good Morning Sunrise\\". In a blog on December 14, 2011, Justin Sams wrote that he is leaving the band to become an art designer and tattoo artist. Philmont has released a new, acoustic EP, Rearranged and Unplugged, on February 8, 2012. On May 29, 2012, founding member Josiah Prince announced he was leaving the band. On July 13, 2012, the band announced that they were going to break-up. The lead singer said in a blog that he, his wife and Josh would be writing on a new project. Philmont's last concert was August 31, 2012, at Lifelight Festival in Worthing, South Dakota.

All facilities suffered from a lack of equipment, supplies, and trained personnel. The ratio of people to hospital beds was 2,610 to one. The ratio of people to physicians was 13,350 to one. This ratio represented an improvement over the 1965 figure of 36,580 to one and was better than that of some of Mauritania's neighbors.Berry, LaVerne. \\"Medical Care\\". In Mauritania: A Country Study (Robert E. Handloff, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (June 1988). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. In 1987 Mauritania's largest medical facility was the 500-bed government-run hospital in Nouakchott. Staffed by Mauritanian and expatriate doctors, it lacked supplies and properly maintained equipment. Other facilities included the National Health Center, built in 1977 for the study of disease prevention and methods of public health care education, and the National School of Nurses and Midwives, founded in 1966 to train nurses, midwives, and paramedical personnel. In general, health standards were quite low, and many infectious diseases were endemic. Contagious diseases (such as measles and tuberculosis) and respiratory disorders were more prevalent in northern arid regions, whereas malaria, guinea worm infection, and schistosomiasis were more common in the Senegal River Valley. The desert tended to be a healthier environment than the more tropical south, but several major diseases were common to all areas of the country. Typhoid, poliomyelitis, hepatitis, and a variety of parasitic illnesses also affected the population. In late 1987, the World Health Organization issued warnings about cholera, and outbreaks of both yellow fever and Rift Valley fever were reported in the extreme southern part of Trarza Region around Rosso. Contagious and infectious diseases were rampant in the k√©b√©s surrounding major towns, cities, and villages. In the mid-1980s, a mass vaccination campaign for children under five years of age was under way. The program, aimed at reducing infection from poliomyelitis, diphtheria, pertussis, and several other diseases, was reportedly meeting with some success. Malnutrition remained widespread, especially in children. The long- term drought and the consequent drop in food production exacerbated this problem during the early 1980s. According to a 1987 report by the United States Agency for International Development, between 40 percent and 70 percent of children under the age of five had experienced moderate to severe malnutrition. The degree of malnutrition varied according to the success or failure of local crops, and some slight improvement was noted in early 1987. Maternal and child healthcare The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Mauritania is 550. This is compared with 712.2 in 2008 and 1295.4 in 1990. The under 5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births is 118 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5's mortality is 35. In Mauritania the number of midwives per 1,000 live births is 3 and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women 1 in 41.

Bruzenak's lettering and logowork was integral to the comic's futuristic, trademark- littered ambiance. During the course of his career, Bruzenak has been closely associated with both Chaykin and Jim Steranko. Biography=Early life and career Bruzenak grew up in Pennsylvania as a huge comic book fan. At age 17, he attended the Detroit Triple Fan Fair convention, where he met his hero Jim Steranko, and also crossed paths with Chaykin for the first time.Cooke, Jon B. Interview with Ken Bruzenak, Comic Book Artist (Feb. 4, 2000). Steranko After meeting Steranko a second time, Bruzenak took a job renovating Steranko's house in Reading, Pennsylvania. He stayed and worked at the house, along with another Steranko disciple, future comics artist Greg Theakston. Theakston was ostensibly there to assist Steranko on The Steranko History of Comics, volume two; Bruzenak was there to do construction. After about two years, Theakston left the project and Bruzenak took over as Steranko's primary assistant. During this period, Steranko formed Supergraphics, his own publishing company, where among other things he published the magazine Comixscene (later retitled Mediascene, and finally Prevue). Bruzenak assisted Steranko on the first fifty issues of Comixscene/Prevue, as well as other concurrent projects, such as Marvel's official fan magazine, FOOM (Bruzenak was the associate editor); the illustrated novel Chandler: Red Tide, the comic book adaptation of the film Outland; and various paperback covers and posters. Bruzenak's duties during this time were varied, basically comprising all aspects of publishing, from research, editing, copy-editing, and proof-reading; to lettering, paste-up, operating a stat camera, and other production skills. (Steranko's 1981 Outland adaptation, in fact, constituted Bruzenak's first professional lettering job.) In the end, Bruzenak worked for Steranko for almost thirteen years. Chaykin Bruzenak eventually left Steranko's employ to embark on a freelance lettering career. Artist Dan Adkins introduced Bruzenak to editors at DC and then Marvel, which at first didn't lead to anything. Bruzenak then lettered a couple of issues of Frank Brunner's Warp for First Comics, before landing the letterer job with Chaykin's American Flagg! in 1983. Bruzenak's work on that title was more typography than simple lettering. The comic featured signage, multiple typefaces, robot type, and a mixture of formal type with balloon type for special effects. Bruzenak's lettering was so integral to the book, it virtually became a character of its own. Readers took notice ‚Äî as did editors for other companies ‚Äî and Bruzenak soon became the industry's first \\"celebrity letterer,\\" getting more offers for jobs than he was able to take on ‚Äî even with his famous non-stop work ethic. In the years since both men left American Flagg! in 1986, Bruzenak has gone on to letter much of Chaykin's later work, including Time2 (1986), Blackhawk (1987), Black Kiss (1988), the short-lived second volume of American Flagg! (1988‚Äì1989), Wolverine/Nick Fury: The Scorpio Connection (1989), Twilight (1990‚Äì1991), Power and Glory (1994), and American Century (2001). Post-Chaykin Besides working on Chaykin's comics in the 1980s, Bruzenak stayed busy lettering a number of other First Comics titles, including E-Man, Jon Sable, and Nexus, as well as titles published by Marvel and DC. In the 90s, Bruzenak worked steadily, often pairing with Michael T. Gilbert on his Mr. Monster comics, but his work was never as much in demand as it was during his mid-80s heyday. From 1995 to 2002, Bruzenak lettered DC's Azrael series. In the 2000s, Bruzenak has lettered much of Michael Avon Oeming's Powers series. He was commissioned to provide lettering for Jack Kirby's \\"Street Code\\" when it was republished in 2000's Streetwise, published by TwoMorrows Publishing. Influences Bruzenak cites long-time DC and Marvel letterer John Costanza as a major influence. Awards Bruzenak won the coveted Harvey Award for Best Letterer three consecutive years, from 1988‚Äì1990, for his work on American Flagg!, Mr. Monster, and Black Kiss. NotesReferences * Cooke, Jon B.

At the time of the independence referendum in 1958, Mauritania's representatives on the Grand Council of the AOF remained neutral, while all other AOF members divided between the African Democratic Rally (Rassemblement D√©mocratique Africain‚ÄîRDA) and the African Regroupment Party (Parti du R√©groupement Africain‚ÄîPRA). Until Mauritania became independent and Morocco threatened its security, Mauritania did not participate in AOF intraterritorial political, labor, or cultural movements. Only when Mauritania's existence as a state became problematic did it seek international recognition and support.Handloff, Robert E. \\"Foreign policy\\". In Mauritania: A Country Study (Robert E. Handloff, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (June 1988). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Throughout the 1960s, Mauritania's main foreign policy objective was preserving its independence in the face of Moroccan irredentism. (Morocco finally recognized Mauritanian independence in 1969.) To that end, the Daddah government insisted on maintaining close ties with France, an effort that included allowing France to station troops on Mauritanian soil. In Africa, Mauritania established ties with the more conservative francophone countries because all the Arab League states (except Tunisia) and the African members of the Casablanca Group (Ghana, Guinea, and Mali) supported Morocco's irredentist claims. Mauritania applied for admission to the UN in 1960, sponsored by France, but its membership was vetoed by the Soviet Union, which supported the Arab League. For the most part, black Africa and the West favored Mauritania's admission, and the Soviet Union dropped its opposition in 1961 in exchange for a favorable vote on Mongolia's admission. In a final effort to block Mauritania's admission, Morocco brought the issue to the General Assembly, which supported Mauritania's application by a vote of sixty-eight to thirteen, with twenty abstentions. Mauritania was admitted to the UN on October 27, 1961. Mali, Guinea, and most Arab states supported Morocco in the debate. In January 1962 Mauritania edged away from its previously conservative, pro- French position by extending recognition to the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic and refusing to attend meetings of the French-backed Common Saharan States Organization. These tentative displays of independence increased Mauritania's credibility with its more progressive African neighbors and emphasized the country's role as a bridge between Arab North Africa and black Sub-Saharan Africa. Mauritania and Mali subsequently achieved a rapprochement with the signing of the Treaty of Kayes in February 1963. Relations with Algeria improved when Mauritania supported Algeria in its dispute with Morocco. Egypt, known at the time as the United Arab Republic (UAR) and the acknowledged leader of the Arab world, also sided with Algeria, and on October 21, 1964, the UAR officially extended recognition to Mauritania. That action encouraged Daddah to undertake an even bolder foreign policy. In 1963 Mauritania joined the OAU, whereupon Morocco resigned in protest. In 1964 Daddah became the first president of the recently formed Afro-Malagasy Union for Economic Cooperation (Union Africaine et Malagache de Coop√©ration Economique‚ÄîUAMCE), a loose grouping of francophone African countries pledging technical and cultural cooperation. When the organization was subsequently upgraded to become a political organization in defiance of the OAU charter, Mauritania withdrew from all but the technical committees. Through the early 1970s, Mauritania continued to play the role of bridge between the Maghrib and sub-Saharan Africa. Mauritania also maintained its commitment to nonalignment while opening relations with Eastern Europe and the radical states of Africa. In support of Arab League and OAU positions, Mauritania did not seek ties with Israel, South Africa, or Portugal. Mauritania finally established diplomatic relations with Morocco in 1969. Close relations with France, on whom Mauritania continued to rely for much of its development aid, remained the cornerstone of Mauritanian foreign policy through the late 1980s. Spain's withdrawal from the Spanish Sahara and the latter's partition and annexation by Mauritania and Morocco in 1976 inaugurated an eight-year period of conflict and fighting against Polisario Front guerrillas of the SADR, resulting in military setbacks and stagnating diplomacy for Mauritania. Upon annexation, Mauritania's former ally Algeria severed its ties with the Daddah government in support of the SADR. From 1976 to 1979, Polisario guerrillas increased pressure on Mauritania and launched commando attacks against Fd√©rik, Zouerat, Bir Moghrein and Nouakchott. As a consequence of the economic and political costs of the fighting, the military successors to Daddah attempted to disengage Mauritania from the conflict; nevertheless, Polisario forces penetrated Mauritania's defenses, often with impunity, to infiltrate fighters into the Western Sahara. On August 10, 1979, Mauritania signs the Alger Accord with the Polisario, recognizing the right of self-determination of the Sahrawis & abandoning any claim on Western Sahara. Subsequently, relations with Morocco again deteriorated and then finally ruptured in 1981 when Mauritania accused Morocco of backing a coup attempt in Nouakchott. Conversely, relations with the Polisario and Algeria improved. In December 1983, Algeria, Tunisia, and Mauritania signed the Treaty of Peace and Friendship. The following year Haidalla extended diplomatic recognition and support to the SADR, an action that ultimately led to the downfall of his government. President Taya maintained ties with the SADR, but the link was at best correct and represented little more than Taya's attempt to appease his more formidable neighbors. Mauritania's principal foreign policy objective in the mid-1980s has been to ensure its own territorial integrity. Translated into diplomacy, this has meant pursuing a policy of strict neutrality in the Western Sahara dispute, improving relations with Morocco and Algeria, and seeking guarantees of support from France should ties with Mauritania's northern neighbors seriously deteriorate. Taya's efforts in that area have had mixed results. Although Taya insisted that Mauritania would remain neutral in the conflict over the Western Sahara, Mauritania faced a mounting threat of greater involvement because the combatants themselves continued to encroach on Mauritanian territory. As the Moroccans pushed southward in the Western Sahara behind their highly effective network of sand walls (berms) to within a few kilometers of the Mauritanian border, Mauritanian armed forces were placed in the position of confronting either well-equipped Moroccan troops pursuing Polisario guerrillas, or Polisario commando teams crossing into and perhaps attacking the berms from Mauritanian territory. In either case, Mauritania would probably be the loser. Taya has also sought to improve ties with other countries to secure trading partners or find new investors. Mauritania's principal benefactors have been Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and France. The list of donors also includes Japan, Iraq, Italy, the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany), Romania, the United States, the Persian Gulf states, and China.

The relations date back to the colonial era when Mauritania was part of French West Africa.  History  Most of Mauritania's developmental assistance in the 1980s was provided by France, which was also the major supplier of private direct investment. Bilateral accords signed with France in 1961 provided for economic, financial, technical, cultural, and military cooperation and aid. Although Mauritania opposed France on Algerian independence, nuclear testing in the Sahara, and French arms sales to South Africa, ties remained cordial through the Daddah term. French citizens worked in Mauritania as technical assistants in the government, administrators, teachers, and judges. Daddah frequently traveled to France, and French development aid flowed to Mauritania. The level of French involvement rose markedly following the outbreak of hostilities in the Western Sahara. Between 1976 and 1979, when Mauritania unilaterally declared peace and withdrew from combat, French aircraft provided air support for Mauritanian troops fighting Polisario forces, and French paratroops were stationed at Nouadhibou.Handloff, Robert E. \\"Relations with France\\".

Activity by Mauritanian dissidents in France, together with Mauritania's gradual policy shift toward the Polisario, resulted in a growing coolness toward Paris. In May 1979, Mauritania asked France to remove its troops from Nouadhibou. France continued to provide a high level of financial aid, although less than requested by the Haidalla government, and this curtailment further strained ties. Following alleged accusations of Moroccan support of a coup attempt in March 1981, Haidalla again turned to France to obtain guarantees of Mauritania's territorial integrity. French president Fran√ßois Mitterrand and Haidalla concluded an accord in 1981, as Morocco threatened to carry the struggle against Polisario guerrillas into Mauritanian territory. As Morocco's advancing sand walls increasingly obligated Polisario guerrillas to use Mauritania as a staging area, President Haidalla and, later, President Taya sought and received guarantees of French support in August 1984 and June 1987.

The two countries border each other since 1975, when Spain abandoned the Western Sahara most of which is now de facto under Moroccan control. The sovereignty of this territory remains disputed. History Moroccan claims, especially within the Istiqlal party, of Greater Morocco, which would include the entirety of Mauritania were quickly shelved. But the looming question of Western Saharan independence has been the major subject in the relationship of these two countries. Prior to the December 1984 coup that brought Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya to power, the Mauritanian-Moroccan cooperation agency stated that relations between the two countries were on the mend in spite of alleged Moroccan complicity in a 1981 coup attempt and Mauritania's subsequent turn toward Algeria. Representatives from both sides initiated a series of low-level contacts that led to a resumption of diplomatic ties in April 1985. For Mauritania, the d√©tente with Morocco promised to end the threat of Moroccan incursions, and it also removed the threat of Moroccan support for opposition groups formed during the Haidalla presidency. Through the agreement with Mauritania, Morocco sought to tighten its control over the Western Sahara by denying the Polisario one more avenue for infiltrating guerrillas into the disputed territory.Handloff, Robert E. \\"Relations with France\\". In Mauritania: A Country Study (Robert E. Handloff, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (June 1988). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Relations between Morocco and Mauritania continued to improve through 1986, reflecting President Taya's pragmatic, if unstated, view that only a Moroccan victory over the Polisario would end the guerrilla war in the Western Sahara. Taya made his first visit to Morocco in October 1985 (prior to visits to Algeria and Tunisia) in the wake of Moroccan claims that Polisario guerrillas were again traversing Mauritanian territory. The completion of a sixth berm just north of Mauritania's crucial rail link along the border with the Western Sahara, between Nouadhibou and the iron ore mines, complicated relations between Mauritania and Morocco. Polisario guerrillas in mid-1987 had to traverse Mauritanian territory to enter the Western Sahara, a situation that invited Morocco's accusations of Mauritanian complicity. Moreover, any engagements near the sixth berm would threaten to spill over into Mauritania and jeopardize the rail link.  Economic relations  The economic ties between the two countries are solid, as reported by the Moroccan newspaper Liberation. Mauritania, with a population of 2.5 million, is currently receiving $1.5 billion annually from international development agencies. In the last year, commercial exchange with Morocco grew by 41 percent, totaling 25 million euros. The vast majority of this commerce flowed from Morocco to Mauritania. Moroccan corporations are also investing heavily in Mauritania, such as Ittisalat al-Maghrib (Maroc T√©l√©com), which in 2001 acquired a controlling share in the Mauritanian telephone company, Mauritel, at a price of $84 million. The Moroccan Office for Mineral Research and Exploitation owns 2.35 percent of Mauritania's chief economic powerhouse, the National Industrial and Mining Corporation, which extracts iron ore and supports more than 5,000 Mauritanian households. Another Moroccan company, DRAPOR, a subsidiary of the Moroccan Office of Port Development, has contracted to dredge the port of Nouakchott. There is also a newly created partnership between Moroccan and Mauritanian companies for the distribution of fuel and the building of a refinery. Morocco is also participating in internationally financed Mauritanian development projects, like the planned Nouakchott- Nouadhibou road. The total cost of this road is estimated at $70 million. The principal financing comes from the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, which is supplying $51.6 million. The African Development Bank and the Islamic Development Bank are supplying $10 million, while the Mauritanian government is contributing $9 million. Four Moroccan companies contracted to produce the initial studies and plans for the road at a cost of over $39 million, and the Moroccan government is bankrolling the construction of nearly of the road at a cost of $2.6 million.

In Mauritania: A Country Study (Robert E. Handloff, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (June 1988). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. The growing split between blacks and Maures in Mauritania has, however, affected ties with Senegal, which sees itself as championing the rights of Mauritania's black minority. Under Taya, relations between the two countries were correct, even though each accused the other of harboring exiled dissidents. In May 1987, Senegal extradited Captain Moulaye Asham Ould Ashen, a former black member of the Haidalla government accused of corruption, but only after veiled threats from Nouakchott that failure to do so would result in Mauritania's allowing Senegalese dissidents a platform from which to speak out against the government of President Abdou Diouf. At the same time, Senegal and Mauritania have cooperated successfully with Mali under the Senegal River Development Office (Organisation pour la Mise en Valeur du Fleuve S√©n√©gal‚ÄîOMVS), which was formed in 1972 as a flood control, irrigation, and agricultural development project.

They are located in the suburb of Soldiers Hill on Creswick Road, and occupy 5.5 hectares of land beside the junction of the Mildura and Serviceton railway lines. History The workshops were opened in April 1917 by the main rail operator in Victoria, the Victorian Railways. They were opened in response to political pressures from provincial groups for decentralisation, with the Victorian Railways preferring the cheaper option of expanding the existing Newport Workshops in suburban Melbourne. The main work carried out was repairs and maintenance of existing wagons and locomotives, but from 1919-22 thirteen new steam locomotives were also built - eight DD class (1038 - 1042, 1050 - 1052) and five A2 class (1073 - 1077) steam locomotives were also built. By the 1960s goods wagons were also being built, and by the 1980s work was also being carried out on Melbourne suburban electric multiple units. The 1980s were also a time of restructuring, with run down facilities replaced and modernised, but a large number of the 540 employees were made redundant.Electrical Trade Union (April 2005). \\"ETU News. page 24.

It was established in 1972 by Edgar S. Cahn and Jean Camper Cahn, longtime champions of the legal rights of low-income and minority persons. The school now operates as the University of the District of Columbia David A. Clarke School of Law (UDC-DCSL). History The Cahns were also instrumental in establishing the federal Legal Services Corporation during the administration of President Lyndon Johnson. They served as the first deans of the school, and envisioned a law school focused on training highly skilled attorneys dedicated to public interest advocacy. The school was fully ABA accredited for the class of 1977 (who entered in 1974), and operated until 1988. The school pioneered a comprehensive law clinic education model espoused by Edmond Can, a law professor at Columbia University and Edgar's father in the 1930s. His concept was to train lawyers like doctors in a clinical model, as opposed to the pure Landell Case method use by Harvard and most other law schools, and to use those lawyers in training to provide legal services to those unable to afford lawyers. Edgar and Jean brought his ideas to life in Antioch's teaching law firm, a combination Legal Services office and law school. Since then, clinical legal education has now been acknowledged by the American Bar Association and the Association of American Law Schools as being an essential part of a complete legal education, and has been incorporated to some degree into the curriculum of virtually every law school in the United States. The school, in fact, was envisioned as more than a law school - it was to be a public interest law firm with teacher-lawyers and student-advocates providing pro bono legal services to the poor and others who were unable to obtain representation. The intent was to create an intense combination of learning and practice. New students also spent their first eight weeks, later reduced to two weeks at the school living with families in Washington's slums to get an understanding of the legal needs and institutional barriers of the people whom the students would soon be representing. This was part of the school's effort to inculcate in its students the passion to eradicate injustice in society. From the beginning, Antioch's approach to admissions was far less test-score oriented than most other law schools. The Cahns said they wanted \\"good\\" students as well as \\"bright\\" ones. They sought students who were more mature and had life experience which demonstrated competency and capacity to initiate and complete tasks in support of social justice. The class gender balance in the incoming class of 1974 was 50/50 men to women, (average female law school admissions at the time was less than 10%) and about 35 percent persons of color and other minorities, with an average age in the late 20s with many students who had successful pre-law school careers. They recognized that not only do those who lack a conventional cultural or educational background have the potential to become good lawyers, they often, uniquely, have the motivation and life experiences to become great advocates for change and social justice. Antioch provided many students an opportunity to attend law school that they probably would not have been afforded otherwise. In addition to its professional degree program, which led to the Juris Doctor degree, permitting graduates to seek licensure as attorneys in all American jurisdictions, the school also offered an advanced degree program leading to the Masters of Laws (LL.M.) in trial advocacy, which was designed to produce highly skilled trial practitioners. In addition, Antioch School of Law offered an M.A. in Legal Studies, one of the first law schools to do so in the 1980s. The law school was run under the auspices of Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, long a pioneer in educational innovation, which, at various points in its history, operated as many as 32 separate entities in several states, as well as abroad as part of the Antioch Network. By the early 1980s, however, faced with growing financial challenges, and a diminished federal funding commitment to in its educational approach, Antioch was forced to scale back its operations, and, in 1986, made the difficult decision to close the law school. In the winter of 2009, the Chancellor of Antioch University set as a priority the exploration of reopening the Antioch School of Law. In 1986, after the announcement of the law school's closing, Antioch Law students and alumni mounted a spirited grassroots campaign and ultimately succeeded in convincing the Council of the District of Columbia to establish the District of Columbia School of Law (DCSL). Though it had no formal connection to Antioch, the DCSL specifically adopted Antioch's mission and curriculum, including the clinical legal education components, employed many of its faculty, and afforded Antioch School of Law alumni full rights as alumni of the new law school. In 1996, the DCSL was absorbed by the University of the District of Columbia, a traditionally black public institution. Renamed in 1998, what had constituted the professional degree curriculum of Antioch School of Law now operates as the University of the District of Columbia David A. Clarke School of Law, a fully accredited institution with several hundred students, and with one of the nation's most highly regarded clinical legal education programs. Initially, the LL.M. in trial advocacy program was adopted as it existed by George Washington University Law School, and operated under that school's aegis. In the ensuing years, however, the program was gradually diminished, and now exists only in truncated form as a three-credit, six-day offering known as the College of Trial Advocacy, and in various other courses in advanced advocacy skills and dispute resolution, at George Washington. Antioch School of Law was located on 16th Street, NW and its law library a block away on Crescent Place, Northwest, in the Adams-Morgan neighborhood of Washington, D.C., near Meridian Hill Park.

Both are found in deep shaded forests, primarily in the coastal counties of the western United States from central California to northern Oregon. The name \\"Scoliopus\\" derives from the Greek words skolios and pous, meaning curved foot, a reference to the shape of the pedicel. Taxonomists believe that Scoliopus is closely related to Calochortus, Prosartes, Streptopus and Tricyrtis, which all have creeping rhizomes as well as styles that divide at the tip. Description Scoliopus has two mottled leaves at its base and a long pedicel that, over time, bends and twists so that the fruit touches the ground. The flowers, which bloom in the late winter and early spring, are pale green or yellow when fresh, lined with narrow purple or dark brown veins, with wide, spreading sepals and narrower petals, three stamens, and a three-angled ovary. The flower's nectaries induce insects to enter and crawl around, with pollen generally deposited on the insect's back. Fungus gnats (Sciaridae and Mycetophilidae) are the principle pollinators of Scoliopus bigelovii.Michael Mesler, James D. Ackerman, Karen L. Lu. 1980. The Effectiveness of Fungus Gnats as Pollinators. American Journal of Botany, 67(4): 564-567. Botanist John Thomas Howell described S. bigelovii as thrusting \\"ill-scented flowers\\" from two tightly rolled leaves as soon as they sprout. By the time the leaves develop, \\"the first fruits are already well formed at the ends of elongate sprawling twisting pedicels.\\" Species Two characteristics separating the species are the shade of the flower and the regions where they grow. S. bigelovii flowers are greenish; S. hallii flowers are grayish-yellow. S. bigelovii grows in California from San Luis Obispo County to Humboldt County. S. hallii grows in Oregon, often along streams, on the western slopes of the Cascades and in the state's coastal mountains, ranging from near Oregon's southern border to Tillamook County.

During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Whitney submitted articles from the front in Cuba. At the Battle of Las Guasimas, he accompanied General Young's 1st and 10th (Regular) Cavalry. His published map of the battle is considered the most accurate of that action published at that time. His depiction of the fighting on the right is made from personal observation. His depiction of the left where the Rough Riders fought was based on post-battle interviews. From 1900, he was an owner and editor-in-chief of the monthly Outing magazine, which promoted the outdoors and sporting pursuits, as well as a good deal of adventure fiction; authors included Jack London and Clarence E. Mulford. He was a founding member of The Explorers Club (1904) after expeditions in North and South America. He later edited Outdoor America. He declared bankruptcy in 1910. As a sports journalist he was an advocate of athletic amateurism and was a member of the International Olympic Committee (1900‚Äì1905) and the American Olympic Committee (President 1906‚Äì1910). He wrote on a wide range of subjects including big-game hunting, inter collegiate sporting contests (especially football and baseball), amateur versus professional contests, and the Olympic games.J.A.Lucas, Journal of Olympic History May 2000 In the early 1900s, he edited \\"The American Sportsman's Library,\\" a quality series of 16 volumes.

Biography Todd Robbins was born in Long Beach, California, the son of a soap executive and a schoolteacher. At the age of 10, Robbins was introduced to magic, enrolling in magic lessons at the B&H; School of Magic every Saturday afternoon. His regular interaction with these seasoned magicians and \\"carnies\\" led to an interest learning the secrets of Sideshow Arts. He became the first Junior Member of the Famous Magic Castle school of magic. Soon after, Todd joined the Long Beach Mystics, a troupe run by the students and hosting professional magicians and variety acts, including an up- and-coming young juggler/magician named Steve Martin. With a new interest in performance, Robbins attended the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco where he earned his degree in Theatre Arts. It is here that Todd met scene partner and friend Annette Bening, and in 1980 he moved to New York City to pursue a career in theatre. He went on a myriad of auditions and landed some small, low-paying roles. \\"I found it all very dubious. I did a few readings, a couple of small shows in basement spaces, which was all kind of fun but it wasn‚Äôt paying the rent.\\" It was around this time that the new vaudeville movement made a comeback with the likes of Penn and Teller and Bill Irwin gaining in popularity. This gave Robbins the incentive he needed to make a change, thus resurrecting his interest in magic and carnivals. He began working at Coney Island in an amusement park sideshow swallowing swords, eating fire, hammering nails in his nose, doing all those great, classic old- timer acts. Robbins inherited the sideshow tradition almost literally, from Melvin Burkhart, one of the pioneers in the field. Born in 1907, Burkhart worked venues from Ringling Brothers to Ripley's Believe It or Not, making a name for himself as the father of the Human Blockhead act‚Äîhammering a nail into one's nostril. Burkhart's last performance took place on October 8, 2001 at Robbins's wedding to Krista Brown. About a month after the performance, Burkhart died, leaving his props to Robbins; his costume and signature enormous nail arrived in the mail. His cremated remains were also left to Robbins, who subsequently sprinkled the ashes at Coney Island. from \\"Monday Night Magic\\" Career Robbins is known for a variety of sideshow acts such as sword swallowing, Human Blockhead, and glass eating, including wine glasses and light bulbs. Robbins estimates he has eaten more than 5,000 light bulbs throughout his career, sometimes consuming up to 21 per week. Robbins has been featured on more than 100 television shows, which include multiple appearances on David Letterman, Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien; Masters of Illusion; and the NBC special Extreme Variety. He was a featured guest on Criss Angel Mindfreak and is also the main subject of the 2005 documentary American Carny: True Tales From The Circus Sideshow directed by Nick Basile. Robbins is one of five partners in the longest running off-Broadway show, Monday Night Magic. He starred in an off-Broadway show Carnival Knowledge which ran from 2002 to 2004 and featured Robbins eating light bulbs and swallowing swords. It was also nominated for a Drama Desk Award.

This Grand Guignol revivalism hearkens back to the early days of the 1940s spook shows when gruesome surprises awaited an unsuspecting audience. A theme of blind faith runs throughout, and gives Robbins and Teller the opportunity to use and then reveal the illusions put forth by mediums, calling them out for the criminals they truly are. In his \\"Meet the Skeptics\\" interview from TAM 2013, Robbins admits to having a \\"fascination for people... who are frauds [con artists and spiritualists],\\" who claim to have supernatural powers which are, in reality, proven sideshow techniques Robbins performs himself.

Estimates for the decline in global diversity over these events range from 50% of marine genera up to 80%. Among the organisms affected by this event were the small shelly fossils, archaeocyathids (an extinct group of sponges), trilobites, brachiopods, hyoliths, and mollusks. Causes There are several hypotheses for the causes of these extinctions. There is evidence that major changes in the carbon cycle and sea level occurred during this time. Evidence also exists for the development of anoxia (a loss of oxygen) in some environments in the oceans. One hypothesis that unifies this evidence links these environmental changes to widespread volcanic eruptions caused by the emplacement of the Kalkarindji Large Igneous Province or LIP. These widespread eruptions would have injected large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere causing warming of the climate and subsequent acidification and loss of oxygen in the oceans. However the precise timing between the eruptions and the extinction events remain unresolved.

Over 30 years they built 352 locomotives for the Victorian Railways, of 38 different designs. History AA class locomotive of 1900 The Phoenix Foundry was established in 1854 to build mining machinery and was incorporated as the Phoenix Foundry Co. Ltd. in 1870. The company was established by iron-founder William Shaw, moulder Robert Holden, and engine-smiths Richard Carter and George Threlfall. The business prospered, and by November 1861 it employed 96 men, producing a wide range of products. From around 1858 the employees were working an eight-hour day while doing as much work as English workers did in ten hours. In 1871 Phoenix completed the locomotive named Governor Weld which was the first steam locomotive to operate in Western Australia. Also in August 1871 the foundry successfully tendered for the first Victorian Government railway locomotive contracts, with the first locomotive being delivered on 27 February 1873, and by 1884 over 350 men were employed. Modernisation of the works was carried out after Shaw visited Britain in 1871 and 1885, with the workshops becoming the most advanced in the southern hemisphere. The hundredth locomotive was completed in April 1883 and the two hundredth by October 1887. The majority of locomotives built were duplicates of imported 'pattern engines' designed and built overseas by other companies. Problems arose in 1889 when Shaw attempted enforce a non-union shop, which resulted in conflict with the employees. Further trouble arose regarding the foundry's relationships with the Victorian Railways (VR), with a tender war erupting between Phoenix and the VR Newport Workshops for the construction of Dd class 4-6-0 light-line locomotives. A Royal Commission was appointed in October 1904 to resolve the question of the 'real costs' of production. The Commission found in favour of Newport, which could produce a locomotive for ¬£3,364 - some ¬£497 cheaper than Phoenix's cost, and noted that Phoenix was making a 23 percent profit on each locomotive. Phoenix received no further orders from the VR beyond the seven members of the Dd class which were delivered in 1904. The works lasted another year until the directors entered voluntary liquidation.

In the coinage of the North Indian and Central Asian Kushan Empire (approximately 30‚Äì375 CE) the main coins issued were gold, weighing 7.9 grams, and base metal issues of various weights between 12 g and 1.5 g. Little silver coinage was issued, but in later periods the gold used was debased with silver.http://www.onsnumis.org/articles/kshaharata.shtml Accessed The coin designs usually broadly follow the styles of the preceding Greco-Bactrian rulers in using Hellenistic styles of image, with a deity on one side and the king on the other. Kings may be shown as a profile head, a standing figure, typically officiating at a fire altar in Zoroastrian style, or mounted on a horse. The artistry of the dies is generally lower than the exceptionally high standards of the best coins of Greco-Bactrian rulers. Continuing influence from Roman coins can be seen in designs of the late 1st and 2nd century CE, and also in mint practices evidenced on the coins, as well as a gradual reduction in the value of the metal in base metal coins, so that they become virtual tokens. Iranian influence, especially in the royal figures and the pantheon of deities used, is even stronger.MacDowell, \\"Mithra\\" Under Kanishka the royal title of \\"King of kings\\" changed from the Greek \\"ŒíŒëŒ£ŒôŒõŒïŒ•Œ£ ŒíŒëŒ£ŒôŒõŒïŒ©Œù\\" to the Persian form \\"œ∑AONANOœ∑AO\\" (Shah of Shahs).MacDowell, \\"Mithra\\", 308-309 Much of what little information we have of Kushan political history derives from coins. The language of inscriptions is typically the Bactrian language, written in a script derived from Greek. Many coins show the tamga symbols (see table) as a kind of monogram for the ruler. There were several regional mints, and the evidence from coins suggests that much of the empire was semi- independent. Kushan deities Skanda and Visakha Gold coin of Kanishka I, with a depiction of the Buddha, with the legend \\"Boddo\\" in Greek script;Ahin Posh The Kushan religious pantheon is extremely varied, as revealed by their coins and their seals, on which more than 30 different gods appear, belonging to the Hellenistic, the Iranian, and to a lesser extent the Indian world. Greek deities, with Greek names are represented on early coins. During Kanishka's reign, the language of the coinage changes to Bactrian (though it remained in Greek script for all kings). After Huvishka, only two divinities appear on the coins: Ardoxsho and Oesho (see details below). Representation of entities from Greek mythology and Hellenistic syncretism are: * ŒóŒªŒπŒøœÇ (Helios), ŒóœÜŒ±Œ∑œÉœÑŒøœÇ (Hephaistos), Œ£Œ±ŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒ∑ (Selene), ŒëŒΩŒ∑ŒºŒøœÇ (Anemos). Further, the coins of Huvishka also portray the demi-god erakilo Heracles, and the Egyptian god sarapo Sarapis.

This is typically a depiction of Rudra, but in the case of these two coins is generally assumed to represent Shiva. Base metal issues MacDowell (1968) identified three regional copper issues of Kajula Kadphises and Vima Taktu of separate coinage in their first issue, which would correspond to the three previous realms making up the Kushan empire. The northern area, Bactria which had the largest sized coins of 12 g (tetradrachms) and 1.5 g, Gandhara whose coinage weighed 9‚Äì10 g for large and 2 g for small, and the Indian area, where coins are 4 g each. MacDowell (1960) proposed a gradual reduction of all three issues starting with Huvishka, while Chattopadhyay (1967) proposes a rapid devaluation of the issue by Kanishka. It seems that there were two reductions based on the coinage of the rulers just named.http://www.kushan.org/coins/huvishka/devaluation.htm Accessed 25 March 2007 Later issues were unified into a central coinage system of weights.

Towards the end of Kushan rule, the first coinage of the Gupta Empire was also derived from the coinage of the Kushan Empire, adopting its weight standard, techniques and designs, following the conquests of Samudragupta in the northwest.Gupta inscriptions using the term \\"Dinara\\" for money: No 5-9, 62, 64 in The imagery on Gupta coins then became more Indian in both style and subject matter compared to earlier dynasties, where Greco-Roman and Persian styles were mostly followed.Pal, 78 The standard coin type of Samudragupta, the first Gupta ruler to issue coins, is highly similar to the coinage of the later Kushan rulers, including the sacrificial scene over an altar, the depiction of a halo, while differences include the headdress of the ruler (a close-fitting cap instead of the Kushan pointed hat), the Garuda standard instead of the trident, and Samudragupta's jewelry, which is Indian.

It is a hunt game, and specifically a tiger hunt game (or tiger game) since it uses an expanded Alquerque board. The one tiger is being hunted by 24 men. The tiger attempts to eat the men, and the men attempt to trap the tiger. An interesting feature in this game is that the tiger can capture a line of men in a single leap. There must be an odd number of men in the line, and they must be adjacent to one another. In most hunt games, the tiger, leopard, or fox is only able to capture one prey in a leap. Rimau in Malay means \\"tiger\\". The men are called orang-orang. Orang-orang is the plural of orang which means \\"man\\". Rimau is the single tiger version of the game Rimau-rimau which has two tigers. Both games have very similar rules. As mentioned earlier, Rimau is specifically part of the tiger hunt game (or tiger game) family as it uses an expanded Alquerque board. This family includes games like Rimau-rimau, Bagha- Chall, and Main Tapal Empat. In contrast, Leopard games are also hunt games, but use a more triangular board and not an Alquerque-based board. Similarly, Fox games are also hunt games, but use more of a cross patterned board. Goal The men win if they block and immobilize the tiger's movements. The tiger wins if they capture all the men, or capture enough men so that the men cannot effectively block and immobilize its movements. This usually happens when there are only 10 or 11 men left on the board. Equipment The game uses an expanded Alquerque board. There are two mountains (called \\"gunung\\" in Malay) attached on two opposite sides of the Alquerque board. The mountains are triangular boards. There is 1 black piece called a tiger, and 24 white pieces called men. Game play and rules 1\\\\. In the beginning the tiger is placed at the vertex of one of the two mountains that connects to the Alquerque board. Nine men are initially placed on the nine intersection points of the central square of the Alquerque board. 2\\\\. The tiger player moves first and removes any 3 men from the board. Then the tiger player may also pick up the tiger, and place it on any empty intersection point on the board, or the tiger player can simply leave the tiger where it is already. 3\\\\. The man player moves next, and must drop his or her remaining 15 pieces on any vacant intersection point on the board one piece per turn before he or she can begin to move any of them. This will take 15 turns. Players alternate their turns throughout the game. The tigers can move and capture from the beginning. 4\\\\. After the 15 men have been dropped, they can then move. Only one man may be moved per turn. The man can be moved (in any available direction) along a line to a vacant adjacent intersection point. 5\\\\. Similarly, the tiger can move (in any available direction) along a line to a vacant adjacent intersection point in a turn. However, the tiger, alternatively, can capture. The men cannot capture. 6\\\\. The tiger can capture an odd number of men (e.g. 1, 3, 5, or 7). If more than one man is captured (i.e. 3, 5, or 7), the men must be in a line. The tiger must be adjacent to the man or line of men, and leap over them onto a vacant intersection point immediately beyond. The leaped pieces are removed. The tiger must leap over them in a straight line that follows the pattern on the board. Moreover, when capturing a line of men, the men must be lined up right next to each other with no vacant points in between them. Once a man or a line of men are leaped over and captured, the tiger can no longer capture further or move. Captures are not compulsory. 7\\\\. If the men are reduced to 10 or 11 pieces, the men will usually resign as there is not enough of them to effectively immobilize the two tigers. Asymmetry Like all hunt games, Rimau is an asymmetric game in that the pieces controlled by one player are different from the pieces controlled by the other player. A tiger can capture whereas men can only simply block the tigers. Furthermore, the number of pieces is different for each player. The tiger player controls one tiger piece, and the man player controls the 24 man pieces. Lastly, the goals of each player are different. The goal of the tiger is to eliminate as many men as possible which would prevent the men from blocking its movements. However, the goal of the men is to block the movement of the tiger.

He then attended Boston College and began his sportscasting experience on WZBC, the school's 1000-watt FM radio station broadcasting to the Greater Boston area. Classmates and fellow broadcasters at WZBC included Joe Tessitore and Jon Sciambi, both of whom also went on to become successful sports announcers. After graduating from B.C. in 1993, Wischusen went to work in sports radio at WQAM in Miami. After leaving the station he settled in New York, where he has worked since. WFAN and WABC Originally, Wischusen worked for WFAN as a reporter and update host for the stations sports news flashes that air every twenty minutes. During his time at WFAN he began working on the station's Jets coverage, hosting the pregame, halftime, and postgame shows. When WFAN lost the rights to the Jets after the 1998 season, Wischusen followed the coverage to WABC. In 2002, he became the play-by-play voice for the Jets on the station after Howard David departed the team for a job in Miami. During his time with the Jets he's worked with Dave Jennings and Marty Lyons as his color commentators. ESPN Wischusen began working for ESPN in 2006 as a secondary commentator for college football and basketball, usually calling games from mid-major conferences such as the MAC or WAC. As of 2009, Wischusen has been calling ACC college football regional action on ABC at 3:30(ET) with Brian Griese. For the 2010 college football season, Wischusen was paired with Brian Griese, calling games for the Noon(ET) ESPN2 broadcast. Wischusen is currently calling with Dan Orlovsky. Other duties In addition to those duties, Wischusen is a substitute announcer for WEPN and MSG's coverage of the Knicks and New York Rangers, when announcers Kenny Albert and Mike Breen are unavailable due to other commitments. Wischusen also announced for the New York Dragons AFL team during its first season alongside former Jet Greg Buttle with whom he currently calls games for the New York Jets Wischusen also served as a field reporter for NBC's coverage of Game 1 of the 2000 American League Division Series between the New York Yankees and Oakland Athletics.

He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2006 he was described as a \\"major force in the field of inorganic photochemistry and photophysics\\". Time magazine included him in its 2009 list of the 100 most influential people. Nocera has opened up new areas of basic research into the mechanisms of energy conversion in biology and chemistry, including the study of multielectron excited states and proton coupled electron transfer (PCET). He works on research applications in artificial photosynthesis and solar fuels, including an \\"artificial leaf\\" that mimics photosynthesis in plants. In 2009, Nocera formed Sun Catalytix, a startup for development of the artificial leaf. The company was bought by Lockheed Martin in 2014.  Early life and education  Daniel George Nocera was born July 3, 1957 in Medford, Massachusetts.. He graduated from Bergenfield High School, Bergenfield, NJ, in 1975. Nocera attended Rutgers University, where he worked with Lester R. Morss and Joseph Potenza. Nocera received a B.S. degree in Chemistry from Rutgers University in 1979. He then attended the California Institute of Technology, where he received a PhD in Chemistry in 1984 for his work with Professor Harry B. Gray on the Spectroscopy, electrochemistry, and photochemistry of polynuclear metal-metal bonded complexes. His work with Gray included the first experimental examination of electron transfer in ruthenium- modified proteins, since considered \\"a hallmark of research on protein electron transfer\\".  Career and research  Nocera joined the faculty of Michigan State University in 1984 as assistant professor, and became a full professor at MSU in 1990. He moved to Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a professor of chemistry in 1997, serving as the W. M. Keck Professor of Energy (2002‚Äì2007) and the Henry Dreyfus Professor of Energy (2007‚Äì2013). He was director of the Solar Revolution Project at MIT, founded in 2008. He became a co-director of the Eni Solar Frontiers Center at MIT when it was created on July 7, 2008. In February 2012, Nocera agreed to move his research group to the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University in Cambridge, MA, where he became the Patterson Rockwood Professor of Energy. Nocera's major areas of interest are in biological and chemical energy conversion, focusing on mechanisms at the molecular level and the photogeneration of hydrogen and oxygen. His work on artificial photosynthesis grows out of his basic research into mechanisms of energy conversion in biology and chemistry, particularly those involving multielectron excited states and proton coupled electron transfer (PCET). Nocera argues that a better understanding of the photosynthesis process is essential to the development of energy strategies, because solar energy has the potential to scale up to meet long-term energy demands. He emphasizes that scientists must consider the economics of the materials they propose to use for energy sources and for storage technologies, if they are to develop viable energy alternatives.  Multielectron excited states  Nocera's early work on two- electron bonds and multielectron exited states is considered to have established new paradigms in excited-state chemistry. The idea behind two- electron mixed-valency is that single-electron mixed-valence compounds and two-electron mixed-valence compounds may be analogous: single-electron mixed- valence compounds may react in one-electron steps, while two-electron mixed- valence compounds may react in two-electron steps. Further, a two-electron bond can be predicted to give rise to four multielectronic states. Nocera and his lab have extensively studied the excited states of metal complexes and clusters. Two Photon Excitation Spectrum of a Twisted Quadruple Bond Metal‚àíMetal Complex completed the description of the four requisite states for the prototypical quadruple bond of a transition metal complex. Building on the ideas of two-electron mixed-valency, Heyduk and Nocera developed a light- driven molecular photocatalyst. The absorption of light caused the two RhII-X bonds of a dirhodium compound to break, resulting in an active rhodium catalyst which was able to react with hydrohalic acids. Their 2001 report on the generation of H2 from halohalic acid using a molecular photocatalyst is considered to have \\"opened the door\\" to photocatalytic production of fuels.  The artificial leaf  In 2008, Nocera and postdoctoral fellow Matthew Kanan were believed to have taken an important step towards artificial photosynthesis, when they created an anode electrocatalyst for the oxidation of water, capable of splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen gases. Their catalyst used cobalt and phosphate, relatively inexpensive and easily obtainable materials. The catalyst was able to split water into oxygen and protons using sunlight, and could potentially be coupled to a hydrogen gas producing catalyst such as platinum. Although the catalyst broke down during catalysis, it could repair itself. In 2009, Nocera formed Sun Catalytix, a startup to develop a prototype design for a system to convert sunlight into storable hydrogen which could be used to produce electricity. Such a system would require both technological and commercial breakthroughs to create economically viable components for hydrogen storage, solar panels, and fuel cells. In October 2010, Nocera signed with the Tata Group of India to further support research and development. The ideal was to create a stand-alone miniature plant capable of providing enough \\"personalized energy\\" to power a small home. Such a device could provide power to homes in isolated areas that are currently inaccessible. In 2011, Nocera and his research team announced the creation of the first practical \\"artificial leaf\\": an advanced solar cell the size of a playing card, capable of splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen with ten times the efficiency of natural photosynthesis. The silicon solar cell was coated with a thin film of cobalt catalyst on one side, over a protective membrane to prevent the silicon from oxidizing, and a nickel-based catalyst on the other side, to split hydrogen from water. The artificial leaf was featured in Time magazine's list of the top 50 inventions of 2011. However, in May 2012, Sun Catalytix stated that it would not be scaling up the prototype. The predominant determiner of its cost, the construction of the photovoltaic infrastructure, was still considered too expensive to displace existing energy sources. Nocera was reportedly \\"daunted by the challenges of bringing the technology to market.\\" Nonetheless, researchers at Harvard and elsewhere continue to investigate the possibilities of the artificial leaf, looking for ways to reduce costs and increase efficiency.  Low-cost flow battery  In hopes of developing a product that could be more rapidly brought to market, Sun Catalytix refocused its business model on developing a low-cost rechargeable flow battery for use in grid-scale and commercial-scale storage. In 2014, Sun Catalytix was acquired by Lockheed Martin, because it was interested in using the flow battery in its microgrid.  Proton-coupled electron transfer  The other area in which Nocera is considered a pioneer is proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET). While he did not originate the idea that electron transfer and proton transfer could be studied as coupled processes, he published one of the foundational papers demonstrating a model for such study in 1992. Using Zn porphyrin as a donor and 3,4- dinitrobenzoic acid as an acceptor, his team demonstrated photoexcitation of the Zn porphyrin and an electron transfer process utilizing a hydrogen bond. This also illustrated the viability of the approach as a model for studying biological energy conversion. PCET has become an important technique for studying energy conversion in biological processes at the molecular level.  Other research  Other contributions include synthesis of an S = 1/2 kagome lattice, of interest to the study of spin-frustrated systems and conduction mechanisms in superconductors; development of microfluidic optical chemosensors for use on the microscale and nanoscale; and molecular tagging velocimetry (MTV) techniques. Nocera has published over 225 papers. He is a co-editor of Photochemistry and Radiation Chemistry (1998). He has served on scientific advisory boards and editorial boards of several large corporations. He was the inaugural editor of Inorganic Chemistry Communications, and was the inaugural chair of the editorial board for ChemSusChem.  Awards and honors  Nocera has received a number of awards and honors, including the following: * Eni- Italgas Prize for Energy & the Environment (2005) * Member, American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2005) * Inter-American Photochemistry Award in Photochemistry (2006) * first recipient of the Burghausen Chemistry Award (2007) * Harrison Howe Award from the Rochester Section of the ACS (2008) * Member, National Academy of Sciences (2009) * American Chemical Society Award in Inorganic Chemistry (2009) * American Crystallographic Association‚Äôs Elizabeth A.

It was founded in 1868, and is the second-oldest humane society in the United States.\\"About the MSPCA-Angell\\", MSPCA-Angell, accessed August 13, 2014. \\"MSPCA-Angell\\" was adopted as the society's identity in 2003, and indicates the names of its two closely related predecessor organizations: Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and Angell Animal Medical Center (formerly known as Angell Memorial Animal Hospital). The organization provides direct care to thousands of homeless, injured, and abused animals each year, and provides animal adoption, a veterinary hospital, advocacy, and humane law enforcement. History Boston Brahmin lawyer George Thorndike Angell began a high-profile protest of animal cruelty in 1868, after reading about two horses being raced to death by carrying two riders each over forty miles of rough roads.\\"History\\", MSPCA-Angell, accessed August 13, 2014. He joined with Emily Appleton, a Boston socialite and animal lover who provided financial support, The Humane Society of the United States and they and 1,200 others formed the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (MSPCA). Among distinguished locals on the first board of directors were John Quincy Adams II, Henry Saltonstall, and William Gordon Weld. Also in 1868, they began publication of Our Dumb Animals, a magazine \\"to speak for those who cannot speak for themselves\\". (\\"Dumb\\" refers to the fact that animals cannot speak.) The Boston Police Department helped distribute their first press run of 200,000 copies. Influenced by the activities of this organization, the Massachusetts General Court passed the first anti-animal-cruelty act in Massachusetts the following year. Nevins Farm before Harriet Nevins donated it to the MSPCA In 1886, the society's first official headquarters were dedicated at 19 Milk Street in Downtown Crossing. The first MSPCA branch was established in Springfield, Massachusetts in 1914. It closed in 2009 due to economic factors. In 1915, a veterinary clinic known as the Angell Memorial Animal Hospital was established on Boston's Longwood Avenue. In 1917, the MSPCA established a permanent animal shelter at Nevins Farm in Methuen, Massachusetts to care for retired police horses and other working animals. It is still the only open-door horse and farm animal rescue center in New England. Shelter for small animals was added to the Methuen facility in 1924. Francis H. Rowley succeeded George T. Angell as President in 1910.The National Cyclop√¶dia of American Biography, Volume 43. (1961). New York: James T. White & Company. pp. 206-207 He held this position until his retirement in 1945. In 1927, the society formed the American Fondouk Maintenance Committee in Fez, Morocco and opened a center there two years later. In 1929, an animal hospital joined the MSPCA's Springfield location, but closed in 2007 due to economic circumstances. In 1935, the Cape Cod Animal Shelter was opened in Centerville, Massachusetts, now part of MSPCA-Angell. The following year, an MSPCA animal shelter opened in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, now known as Berkshire Humane Society. The Angell Memorial Animal Hospital launched the first veterinary intern training program in 1940. In 1943, Angell was first to apply techniques of aseptic surgery to small animal medicine and surgery. The MSPCA assumed control of the Foote Memorial Animal Shelter on Martha's Vineyard in 1945 until 2009, when ownership of the shelter was transferred to a local animal shelter. Also in 1945, Angell became the first veterinary hospital to institute 24-hour nursing and veterinary care. In 1950, the MSPCA opened an animal shelter and hospital on Nantucket, which was operated by the MSPCA until 2012, when Nantucket veterinarians purchased the hospital and opened it as the ‚ÄúOffshore Animal Hospital of Nantucket.‚Äù Also in 1950, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) in Great Britain joined with the MSPCA to create the International Society for the Protection of Animals (now the World Animal Protection). In 1959, MSPCA President Dr. Eric Hansen was elected first president of the ISPA. Angell Memorial Animal Hospital built a veterinary intensive care unit in 1959 that was the first of its kind. In 1962, the MSPCA and ISPA began work to improve inhumane slaughterhouses in Latin America. In 1964, the MSPCA launched \\"Operation Gwamba\\" in Surinam which saved 9,737 animals from hydroelectric dam flooding and was the largest such project in history. MSPCA logo, 1921 The MSPCA and Angell Memorial Animal Hospital moved into a shared facility at 350 South Huntington Avenue in 1976, which was the most extensive animal service center ever created by a humane society. An adoption center was established at this location as well. The MSPCA assisted law enforcement officers in animal rescue after eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1979. Conditions at Boston's Franklin Park Zoo were improved through the direct involvement of the MSPCA, starting in 1982. In 1986, MSPCA-Angell launched the statewide subsidized Spay/Neuter Assistance Program (SNAP) for low income pet owners who qualify. The MSPCA formed the Center for Laboratory Animal Welfare (CLAW) in 1992 and, in the following year, established the Animal Disaster Relief Fund to aid in animal protection and rescue globally. In 1994, a new MSPCA facility was opened in Brockton, Massachusetts, and Nevins Farm in Methuen launched the Equine Ambulance Program to offer emergency rescue and transport of disabled horses in New England and ambulance services events involving horses worldwide. In 1994, the society established Phinney's Friends, the first program run by a humane society to assist people with HIV/AIDS and their pets. The Shalit- Glazer Clinic was formed in 1996 to provide spay-neuter surgery for pets of low-income families. In 1997, Angell established the Cancer Care Center to provide on-site radiation therapy for animals. The same year, the MSPCA Archives Library was dedicated. In 2013, advocacy efforts led to the passage of the Animal Control Law ‚Äì the most significant animal-related legislation in decades. Also that year, a unified Animal Behavior Program began with the Adoption Centers and Angell Animal Medical Center. In 2014, the first canine total elbow replacement surgery was performed at Angell by Dr. Nick Trout and Sun Valley Animal Center‚Äôs Dr. Randy Acker, who designed and developed the TATE Elbow system. Services As of 2012, the MSPCA-Angell operates three Animal Care and Adoption Centers: Boston, Nevins Farm and Equine Center (Methuen), and Cape Cod. It also operates Angell Animal Medical Center in Boston and, since 2014, MSPCA-Angell West in Waltham, both 24/7 emergency facilities. Together these facilities employ nearly 80 full-time veterinarians including board-certified specialists in fields such as 24/7 emergency and critical care, avian and exotic medicine, anesthesiology, behavior, cardiology, dentistry, dermatology, diagnostic imaging and nuclear medicine, internal medicine, I-131 treatment for hyperthyroid cats, neurology, nutrition, oncology, ophthalmology, pain medicine, pathology, surgery, and preventative medicine. Angell Animal Medical Center has magnetic resonance imaging equipment, with a state-of-the-art, high-speed updated machine installed in November 2014 to replace the original Angell MRI. The original Angell MRI was the first MRI located within a veterinary hospital in New England and the second available in the United States. This equipment was part of a $28 million building campaign to improve the Boston facility. The renovation was completed in 2005. The refurnished Boston facility also includes the Helen Schmidt Stanton Clinical Care Center and the Copeland Animal Care and Adoption Center. Also among Angell's equipment is a high speed CT unit offering multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT, or multi-slice CT). This highly sophisticated machine enables 3-D reconstructions of images for accurate diagnoses and better treatment. Each year, more than 50,000 animals receive outstanding routine, emergency, and specialty care at the MSPCA- Angell's premier veterinary hospital, Angell Animal Medical Center in Boston. Angell also provides 24 x 7 emergency service and specialty care in Waltham, MA. The MSPCA has a Law Enforcement Department and organizes the annual Walk for Animals on Boston Common. Statements of belief MSPCA-Angell takes a strong stand on a number of animal-related issues and is influential in creating animal-related legislation in Massachusetts. Among the areas in which MSPCA-Angell takes a position are: *Animal Control: a comprehensive category of concern which includes advocacy for the prevention of animal overpopulation, proper leashing and humane confinement of animals, responsible standards for animal adoption, and humane euthanasia of animals when appropriate MSPCA-Angell Animal Control *Animal Fighting: the society is \\"unequivocally opposed\\" to setting one animal against a person or other animal as is done in dogfighting, cockfighting, bullbaiting, and bullfighting MSPCA- Angell Animal Fighting *Assistance Animals: the society advocates that it is critical that the needs both the animals and the people they assist are met MSPCA-Angell Assistance Animal *Classroom Animals: the society believe that animals should only be kept as classroom pets \\"if they are acquired for the purpose of educating students about the sentience of animals and the need for responsible, humane care\\" MSPCA-Angell Classroom Animals *Cosmetic Surgery in Animals: the society opposes ear cropping and tail docking in dogs, tail myotomy in horses and any \\"surgery done on animals solely for cosmetic reasons or to disguise an imperfection\\" MSPCA-Angell Cosmetic Surgery in Animals *Dangerous Dog Laws: the society opposes breed-specific legislation and believes that these laws are not an effective way to control dangerous dogs MSPCA-Angell Dangerous Dog Laws *Declawing Cats: the society states that onychectomy is neither a minor procedure nor a painless one and therefore opposes it being done for non-medical reasons MSPCA-Angell Declawing Cats *Devocalization of Animals: likewise, the society opposes debarking of dogs and laryngectomy of animals in general MSPCA-Angell Devocalization of Animals *Euthanasia of Shelter Animals: recognizing that the number of animals in shelter exceeds the number of responsible people available to adopt them, the society condones euthanasia but condemns the use of high-altitude decompression chambers, electrocution, injectable paralytic agents, unfiltered and uncooled carbon monoxide, and drowning for this purpose MSPCA-Angell Euthanasia of Shelter Animals *Factory Farming (Intensive Husbandry Practices): believing \\"that farm animals are creatures of intrinsic value, complexity and dignity\\" and that \\"the billions of animals raised each year in the United States for food, clothing, and other products are entitled to live their lives free of unnecessary pain, suffering and stress, as well as to a humane death\\", the society condemns many practices associated with factory farming while accepting the responsible and appropriate use of electric fencing to contain livestock, selective breeding for desirable characteristics, and ear tags, tattoos, microchips, and freeze branding (but not hot branding) for animal identification MSPCA-Angell Factory Farming *Furs: the society is against fur farming, fur trapping, and the use of fur in general saying \\"no valid justification exists for killing animals for their fur, since fur items are generally marketed and purchased solely as symbols of status and wealth and are unnecessary for meeting human needs\\" MSPCA-Angell Furs Other areas in which MSPCA-Angell has a position are genetic engineering and animal patenting, MSPCA-Angell Genetic Engineering/Animal Patenting the training of guard dogs to increase their aggression, MSPCA-Angell Guard Dogs hunting for sport or as a tool for wildlife management, MSPCA-Angell Hunting the capture of wild animals as pets and attempts at their domestication, MSPCA-Angell Native and Exotic Wildlife as Pets the commercialization of animal breed by pet stores, MSPCA-Angell Retail Sale of Pets and the use of animals in rodeos.

Roshan's amateur football experience began at the age of 11 when his father encouraged him to attend trials MILO National Soccer School was hosting. This school was established in 1974 as a means of grooming teenage sporting talent through its youth development programs. Impressed by his potential, the scout at the trial proceeded to select the left footer to represent the 'West' zone. Roshan played for this division for 2 years before advancing to Clementi Khalsa FC (Under-14). He was also concurrently playing for his school's (Anglo-Chinese School ‚Äì Barker) soccer team. Unbeknownst to this young flair, a scout was present at one of these games and approached his school's coach. A chance to play for Home United stemmed out of this fortuity. Roshan nabbed this opportunity and represented Home United for the next 3‚Äì4 years. National service soon beckoned and he took a much required half-time from football. In 2007, while pursuing his 2-year degree in Mass Communication, he played professionally for Balestier Khalsa FC. In 2010, he joined Singapore Armed Forces.

History Opened by the Caledonian Railway, the station was not advertised in the public timetables and was intended solely for the use of workmen, probably those employed by the company in the sidings constructed south-east of the junction at the end of the 19th century. These sidings were used for marshalling and weighing wagons of coal from the several collieries in the Douglas and Coalburn areas. The Caledonian Railway became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923. This company then closed the station after roads were improved and more convenient local bus services became available.

It is a shell of a medieval church, dating back at least as far as 1178, and was altered in the 17th century for Protestant worship. It has been a ruin since the 19th century. History The church was part of the old village of Dalgety, and the ruins are the only surviving feature of it. It was in existence by at least 11 March 1178 when Pope Alexander III issued a papal bull, calling for the founding of the \\"Church at Dalgetty with its appurtenances\\". The church was later appropriated by the nearby Inchcolm Abbey, and in 1244 it was consecrated by David de Bernham, Bishop of St. Andrews. In 1641, the Rev. Andrew Donaldson became minister at St Bridget's, and oversaw the building of a school. He opposed the imposition of the Episcopalianism of Charles I, and was deposed from the parish for his Presbyterianism. He refused to leave and had to be forcibly removed from the church by soldiers despatched by Archbishop James Sharp. Donaldson was subsequently imprisoned, but due to the shifting political situation, was eventually allowed to return to the parish and resume his duties. St Bridget's was substantially altered in the seventeenth century, but by the early nineteenth century, had become unsafe. The roof was lost in 1830, and a new church was built half a mile inland. The Church today The ruins are maintained by Historic Scotland. The loft can still be accessed, and the church's piscina survives in good condition. The church has three distinct aisles adjacent to the main room: the large Dunfermline Aisle to the west, built around 1610, contains a burial vault for the Earls of DunfermlineFife Attractions, and Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline is buried here. The Fordell Aisle to the north is a late 16th-century addition, and the small Inglis Aisle next to it dates from the early 17th century. An open-air service is held at the church every year in June. Several carved gravestones remain in the old churchyard, some from as early as 1665. A 'keep' is built into the churchyard wall, providing a place from which the church beadles could guard against body-snatchers.

A SEAL platoon from SEAL Team 3, including several of their Desert Patrol Vehicles, accompanied by a German KSK element and a Norwegian SOF team spent some nine days conducting an extensive site exploitation, clearing an estimated 70 caves and 60 structures in the area, recovering a huge amount of both intelligence and munitions, but they did not encounter any al-Qaeda fighters. In March 2002, ODAs from 3rd SFG took part in Operation Anaconda, teams from TF-K Bar and Task Force 64 (1 squadron Australian SAS Regiment) were inserted into a valley in the area of operations and were tasked with establishing their own observation posts which \\"had to be tenable, afford good reconnaissance and cover the identified escape routes or 'rat lines' into Pakistan\\" according to one of the US planners.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.49-50, p.54 In total, K-Bar ran 42 reconnaissance and surveillance missions, and an unreported number of combat missions that resulted in the capture of 107 Afghans and the deaths of at least 115.

Biography  Raboni was born in Milan, the second son of Giuseppe, a clerk at Milan commune, and Matilde Sommariva. In October 1942, after the first bombings of Milan, the family moved to Sant'Ambrogio Olona, near Varese, where Raboni concluded his primary and intermediate school. His father's love for French and Russian classics made him read and appreciate Proust, Dickens, Dostoevskij and when his cousin Giandomenico Guarino, knowledgeable about contemporary literature and poetry, found shelter in Sant'Ambrogio too after 8 September 1943 armistice, Raboni met the works by Piovene, Buzzati, Ungaretti, Quasimodo, Cardarelli, and Montale about whom he said: I know I owe much to Montale, I realise this upon rereading him, even if I did not love him as much as Eliot and Sereni, but he affected me a lot... especially his expression of the limits, of the fact that we cannot demand too much in 20th century of poetry as a source of truth.So di dover molto a Montale, me ne accorgo quando lo rileggo, anche se non √® stato un autore da me amato quanto Eliot e Sereni, ma ha agito eccome... soprattutto l'espressione dei limiti, il fatto che non si possono avere troppe pretese nel Novecento per la poesia come fonte di verit√†, in G. Fantato e L. Cannillo, in La biblioteca delle voci, Joket, Novi Ligure, 2006 Having completed law studies, he was a lawyer for some years, but at the end of the 1950s he felt more attracted to literature and poetry. He met in Milan Vittorio Sereni, Antonio Porta, Giovanni Testori, Giorgio Strehler and began working for periodical and newspapers, at first in the editorial staff of Aut aut, a magazine edited by Enzo Paci, then writing for Piergiorgio Bellocchio's Quaderni Piacentini and Roberto Longhi's Paragone and finally for Corriere della Sera for which worked several years. Raboni became was appreciated as both a literary critic and a translator of classic works: he translated in Italian some works by Gustave Flaubert, and by Guillaume Apollinaire, Les Fleurs du mal by Charles Baudelaire for Einaudi publishing house, Jean Racine and Proust's In Search of Lost Time in Mondadori's \\"I Meridiani\\" collection. In 1961 he published two short poetry collections, Il catalogo √® questo and L'insalubrit√† dell'aria, followed by Le case della Vetra in 1966, Cadenza d'inganno in 1975, Nel grave sogno in 1982 and, in 1988, the anthology A tanto caro sangue. In the 1970s he began editing the poetry series \\"I quaderni della Fenice\\" for Guanda publishing house, acting as a kind of talent-scout for new poets. Milan (especially the memory of the old city, before the recent town plannings) is in the heart of his matters: In June 1971 he was one of the 800 intellectuals who signed, in L'Espresso magazine, a manifesto against Luigi Calabresi, a police officer falsely suspected of having killed the anarchist Giuseppe Pinelli. In October he was among those who signed a \\"self- denunciation\\", to express solidarity with some journalists of Lotta Continua newspaper, defending their strong anti-government positions.\\"I falsi profeti del Sessantotto\\" di Michele Brambilla\\"Caso Calabresi\\" di Antonio Socci Among his literary critic essays are Poesia degli anni sessanta (Poetry of the 1960s) published in 1968, Quaderno in prosa in 1981. La fossa di Cherubino (1980) collects his proses. Raboni was interested in theater too: was in the directorial committee of Piccolo Teatro di Milano and wrote several plays, such as Alcesti o la recita dell'esilio and Rappresentazione della croce (2000). His activity as a poet went on with Canzonette mortali (1987), Versi guerrieri e amorosi (1990), Ogni terzo pensiero (1993, with which he won the Viareggio Prize for poetryArchivio storico Corriere della Sera, 25 giugno 1994), Quare tristis (1998), and Barlumi di Storia (2002). Raboni's grave at the Monumental Cemetery of Milan Giovanni Raboni died of a heart attack in Parma in 2004. He is buried at the Monumental Cemetery of Milan. His wife, poet Patrizia Valduga, wrote the afterword to his last poetry collection Ultimi versi, published posthumously in 2006; one of his last poems is \\"Canzone del danno e della beffa\\" (Song of the harm and the hoax), also published posthumous on Corriere della Sera in 2004.Annali d'italianistica, Volume 24 University of Notre Dame.

He won 16 caps for Wales. Boots was seen as a consistent player with a superb positional sense who would tackle hard and smother the loose ball; his passing skill was strong as was his catching and dribbling. Boots was not a flair player but was a good 'spoiler' and could turn defence into attack, giving backs, such as Nicholls and Lloyd, a platform to run in tries. Boots had an exceptionally long rugby career, in spite of being on his death bed in 1908 with acute pleurisy. Rugby career=Club career Boots rugby career started with club side Pill Harriers the tough Newport Docks club that produced fellow Wales internationals Tommy Vile and George Travers. Boots had one of the longest careers in top-flight Welsh rugby, he joined Newport in 1895 and he played his last match for them in 1922. This was his 365th Newport game and at the age of 47 he is the oldest player to have represented the club in an official game. International career Boots made his international debut in a Welsh victory against Ireland on 19 March 1898 . In 16 matches he scored a single try for Wales in a game against Scotland in 1901. One of Boots' finest moments in a Welsh jersey was in the 1903 game against Ireland at the Cardiff Arms Park. In the first half of the game he provided excellent tackling to provide a solid ground for the backs to attack, even though he broke his collar bone during one of the exchanges. Through pain Boots continued tackling during the first half but retired in the interval, but by then the damage was done and Wales dominated Ireland to win 18-0.Parry-Jones (1999), pg 103.

The main hall enshrines Hondawake-no-Mikoto (Emperor Ojin), Tarashinakatsuhiko-no-Mikoto (Emperor Chuai) and Okinagatarashihime-no-Mikoto (Emperor Jingu).

In 1585, its treasure house and other buildings were burnt down during the war caused by Toyotomi clan. It went through tough times until Asano Yukinaga took over Kishu in 1600 and made an offer to expand its land and additional property tax (10 koku).

The nearest town is Kheri Naudh Singh, 1 km east to the village. Dholewal falls under the Jurisdiction of the Khamanon City Tehsil, home to the Senior Superintendent of Police and Magistrate of the area. The largest city near the village is Khanna, approximately 10 km west to the village. History The history of Dholewal can be traced back to the 1890s. Most village residents migrated from other parts of Punjab. Those with the surname Maan, which is more than 20 families, are thought to have originated from a village named Dhanola. Fifteen Maangat families migrated from Chandran, seventeen Kharaud families migrated from Sakhrali, and twenty families of Kanda migrated from Moga. The richest families of this region are the Maan and the Kharoud families. They make up the biggest landowners. The village comes under the Fatehgarh Sahib District. Many residents have left the village for economic reasons. The majority of them have moved to large cities for better income and a higher standard of living. Demographics Dholewal has a population of 748 (as of the 2001 censusCensus) - 53% male and 47% female. 16% percent of the village population is under 10 years old. The literacy rate of the village is 58%. People from different castes reside in the village. The majority of the population belongs to the Jatt Sikh community. Dalits are a visible minority in the village. Education Dholewal has an elementary school situated on the Dholewal- Hargana road. Students from middle-income families go to private schools, but low-income children go to public schools due to lower tuition fees. Many of the young people in the village have a high school education, and a small number of students pursue a bachelor's degree. Income inequality within the village plays a major role in educational attainment, as more than half of the poor families do not have access to education. Religion Dholewal is demographically diverse, but the majority are Jatt Sikhs with a visible minority of Dalits and Chammars. The largest religion in the village is Sikhism. There are three gurudwaras (religious temples) in the village. There is a small community of Hindu people in the village who belong to the Khatri caste. Sports and leisure activities Football and volleyball are the two most popular sports in Dholewal. There were some competitions in the past between this village and other villages. A village playground is located at the elementary school. The volleyball ground is located at the Gurudwara site. Many older people do not play any physical sports but enjoy playing cards. The village panchayat (assembly) is considering investing in sports activities over the next two years, with the village volleyball ground scheduled to be upgraded in 2011. Contributions to community projects remain limited by the diaspora from the community, worsened by the 2008 recession. Daljinder Singh Kharaud D.P.E was a national champion in 1983 at Calcutta in races (100 m). And in 2011, S. Daljinder Singh Kharaud participated in an international veteran's athletic meet in Pune and placed sixth in the 100 meter race. At that time, many new players from Dholewal did well at the national and international levels. One is Naminderdeep Singh Maangat who won a silver medal in North India Boxing Championship in 2013 and is also a three-time Punjab champion. Naminderdeep Singh Maangat also participated three times in All India University. He won three gold, one silver, and nine bronze medals for his village, Naminderdeep Singh Maangat is also the president of Youth Sports Welfare Club Dholewal. Foreign families  Approximately 20 households have family members settled abroad in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Australasia. Remittances are a major source of income for those families. Economy Agriculture is the primary source of income in Dholewal. Approximately 75% of the village population earn their living from farming. Ten percent are employed in the public and private service sectors. Ten percent are self-employed, and 5% are unemployed. The main agricultural products of Dholewal are wheat, rice, sugarcane, sunflower, and various vegetables. Agriculture is not industrialized. Income distribution in the village is unequal; the landlord families of Dholewal earn 50% of the gross product while 15% of residents live below the poverty line. Dalit and Chammar families earn less than 100 rupees ($2 USD) a day. In 2006‚Äì07, the Gross Domestic Product of Dholewal was 2.6 crore rupees, and the median income for households was 50,000 rupees, which is well above the state and national average. Politics Dholewal has a rich history in political affairs. Voters in the village are divided into two main political parties, the Indian National Congress Party and the Shiromani Akali Dal. Dholewal village is under the jurisdiction of the legislative assembly seat at Khanna City. Former MLA (Member of Legislative Assembly) of Khanna City Sh. Shamsher Singh Dullo visited the village during his tenure. In recent elections, the majority of village voters favor the Akali Dal Party, which is the current governing party of the State of Punjab. Internal issues The main public issues are the village's playground, sewerage system and lack of good educational institutions. Many low-income families are unable to send their children to school as a result of the unavailability of public education. The village's strikingly low sex ratio (877/1000) is another matter of concern. The village sex ratio is consistent with the state. This issue remains to be the most challenging to address.

Technical description Q-Flex vessels are propelled by two slow speed diesel engines, which are claimed to be more efficient and environmentally friendly than traditional steam turbines. Q-Flex carriers are equipped with an on-board re-liquefaction system to handle the boil-off gas, liquefy it and return the LNG to the cargo tanks. The on-board re-liquefaction system reduces LNG losses, which produces economic and environmental benefits. Overall, it is estimated that Q-Flex carriers have about 40% lower energy requirements and carbon emissions than conventional LNG carriers. The capacity of a Q-Flex vessel is between 165,000 m3 and 216,000 m3. Until the entry into service of the Q-Max-type carrier, it was the world's largest LNG carrier type with a capacity of 1.5 times that of conventional LNG carriers. Contractors The first Q-Flex LNG carrier was delivered by Hyundai Heavy Industries in late 2007. The installed re-liquefaction system is developed and delivered by Hamworthy and approved and certified by DNV. Q-Flex LNG carriers are built also by Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Company and Samsung Heavy Industries.

Allan Jones Energy and climate change  Jones attended Sheerwater secondary modern, Woking; Guildford College of Technology and the Central London Polytechnic. During his early career he spent 18 years with Greater London Council and Inner London Education Authority, working on major development and regeneration projects but is known for his energy and climate change work, particularly decentralised energy in Woking, London and Sydney. In 1999, Jones was awarded an MBE in the New Year‚Äôs honours list for services to energy and water efficiency. Greater London Council/Inner London Education Authority From 1971 to 1989 Jones worked for the Greater London Council (1971 to 1986) and the Inner London Education Authority (1986 to 1989) on major development and regeneration projects both as an engineer and senior manager, including London housing projects, Andover Town Development, County Hall projects, Burgess Park new lake and park, the first networked Building Energy Management System in the UK and various school and college projects. Jones was a member of the Department of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Management Board from 1983 to 1986 and a member of the Department of Building and Property Services Management Board from 1986 to 1989. Woking Borough Council From 1989 to 2004 Jones worked for Woking Borough Council, initially as building services manager and then as energy services manager. He was instrumental in establishing the Council‚Äôs energy and environmental services company Thameswey Ltd of which he was a director (1999 to 2004) and its public/private joint venture company Thameswey Energy Ltd which developed and implemented decentralised energy projects in both the public and private sectors. During his time at Woking, Jones reduced CO2 emissions by 77.5% from 1990 levels to 2004, improved the energy efficiency of the existing housing stock within its area by 30% from 1996 to 2004 and undertook groundbreaking work on energy and water efficiency, private wire CHP cogeneration and trigeneration decentralised energy systems, environmentally friendly waste recycling/recovery and energy from waste technologies, alternative fuels for transport, renewable energy and fuel cells. Under Jones, Woking installed 81 private wire decentralised energy systems, nearly 10% of the UK‚Äôs total installed solar energy photovoltaics and the first fuel cell CHP in the UK. Woking was able to implement private wire networks under the UK‚Äôs exempt licensing regime . In 2001, Jones was instrumental in Woking being awarded a Queens Award for Enterprise: Sustainable Development for his work in the development of local sustainable community energy systems, the only local authority ever to receive a Queens Award for Enterprise. London Climate Change Agency In 2004, the then Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone recruited Jones to head up his new climate change agency for London as chief executive officer (2004 to 2008) of the London Climate Change Agency Ltd (LCCA), a municipal company that developed and implemented projects in the sectors that impact on climate change, especially in the energy, water, waste and transport sectors. In addition to being chief executive officer of the LCCA, Jones was also the LCCA‚Äôs executive director of the London ESCO Ltd and the LCCA‚Äôs director of the Better Buildings Partnership Ltd, a company limited by guarantee between the LCCA and major landlords in London to reduce CO2 emissions from major commercial and public buildings. During his time in London Jones set up and ran the LCCA, developed the energy and climate change elements of the London Plan, Mayor‚Äôs Climate Change Action Plan and the new Mayoral Climate Change Statutory Duty as well as developing and implementing decentralised energy and renewable energy projects in London. One of the key projects that Jones implemented was the procurement and establishment of the London ESCO, a public/private joint venture Energy Services Company between the LCCA Ltd and EDF Energy plc, which designs, finances, builds and operates decentralised energy systems for both new and existing development. Jones is credited with the removal of the regulatory barriers to decentralised energy in the UK with the high level advocacy and lobbying that led to the creation of a separate electricity supply licence for decentralised energy or distributed generation to supply electricity over the local distribution network, otherwise known as the ‚Äòvirtual private wire‚Äô over public wires principle. The UK Energy Regulator ‚Äì the Office of Electricity and Gas Markets enacted the new licence in March 2009 . On 22 May 2008, Jones appeared in an interview, shot in London and Woking, as part of the Australian ABC‚Äôs Catalyst programme (2008 Episode 14). The story featured Jones past work in Woking and the LCCA‚Äôs plans for implementing decentralised energy systems in London. This led to Jones being invited to visit Sydney as a guest of the City of Sydney and the New South Wales state government. A public talk ‚ÄòCity Talk: Green Transformers, revolutionising energy generation for a Sustainable Sydney‚Äô was held on Tuesday 22 July 2008 at the Theatre Royal, MLC Centre, King St, Sydney. The visit also included media coverage, like that on ABC Radio National‚Äôs Saturday Extra programme. Sustainable Environment Foundation From 2007 to 2009 Jones was a director-trustee of the Sustainable Environment Foundation, a foundation that promotes for the benefit and advances the education of the public the conservation, protection and improvement of the physical and natural environment. Allan Jones Energy and climate change From 2008 to 2009 Jones worked as an energy and climate change consultant both in the UK and overseas, including working for the City of Sydney on a number of energy and climate change projects and advising on the delivery of the climate change targets in Sustainable Sydney 2030, in particular on trigeneration and other green infrastructure. City of Sydney In 2009, Jones was appointed as chief development officer, energy and climate change by the City of Sydney to provide leadership, strategic direction and high level advocacy to promote the changes which support the development and delivery of green infrastructure within the City as set out in Sustainable Sydney 2030. Sydney has an ambitious target to reduce CO2 emissions by 70% by 2030 from 2006 levels which will require at least 330 MWe of combined cooling, heat and power (CCHP) or trigeneration to deliver 70% of the city‚Äôs electricity requirements by 2030 with the remainder coming from local renewable energy. To deliver these targets Jones developed a green infrastructure plan for the city, which is being put into action at two levels: for the city as a whole and by the City of Sydney leading the way and installing local generation and green infrastructure projects in its own operations. This \\"show by doing\\" principle had been previously adopted in Woking and London to demonstrate that if the public sector leads, others will follow. At the first level, decentralised energy master plans, trigeneration, renewable energy and Advanced Waste Treatment, Decentralised Water and Automated Waste Master Plans are being developed to create a citywide green infrastructure plan which will be embedded into the City‚Äôs master plan and operations. At the second level, the city is implementing a range of projects to reduce its own CO2 emissions by 48% from 2009 to 2012 as a first step towards the city‚Äôs own 70% reduction in CO2 emissions target for its own buildings and operations. This has led to a series of building energy efficiency retrofit and renewable energy projects which have already seen an 18% reduction in CO2 emissions in the first year of the project. At the second level, the city has already reduced greenhouse gas emissions in its buildings by 18% from 2009 to 2011 by building energy efficiency retrofits and has let a further building energy and water efficiency retrofit contract to reduce emissions by a further 24%, increasing the total emission reductions to 42% by the end of 2012. The city has also let contracts to replace all city-owned street lighting with LEDs over the next three years which will reduce emissions in city-owned street lighting by 51% and to install 1.25 MWp of precinct scale solar photovoltaics on more than 30 of the city‚Äôs buildings over the next two years. Following completion of the two-year-long procurement process Cogent Energy (owned by Origin Energy) was appointed by Sydney as the energy services provider to design, finance, build, operate and maintain the citywide trigeneration network. Heads of agreement were signed in April 2012 and the development agreement was executed in August 2012.

This species is also known as the Empress of Brazil because of its origin in South America. It grows in very extreme and moist environments, and is commonly found near waterfalls in rich soil situated on granite rocks (which is why it is sometimes considered to be a lithophyte) and sunny places. However, it can be difficult to cultivate. It has plenty of needs, though it can exhibit great hardiness. It also has many ornamental traits. The plant has a large bulb that produces a high stem with green recurved leaves. Worsleya produces spectacular and beautiful blooms. They are large, lilac to blue, with small freckles on them. The seeds are black and semicircular, and (when cultivated) are usually sown in pumice or sometimes Sphagnum, although with Sphagnum the threat of decay is higher.Lemaire, (Antoine) Charles. 1864.

Developed by Honeywell, it is suitable for backpack deployment and single-person operation. Development The Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) program was launched by DARPA. Following a $40 million technology demonstration contract to Honeywell Defense and Space Electronic Systems in 2003, the MAV project was transferred to United States Army's Future Combat System (FCS) program to fulfill the need for Class I platoon- level drone. In May 2006, Honeywell was awarded a $61 million contract to develop an advanced MAV with extended endurance and heavy-fuel engine. In 2007, the United States Navy awarded Honeywell a $7.5 million contract for 20 G-MAVs (denoting the use of a gasoline engine) for deployment to Iraq with the U.S. Multi-Service Explosive Ordnance Disposal Group. The hovering feature of MAV has been critical for U.S. forces in Iraq that search for roadside bombs. Military convoys have been using MAVs to fly ahead and scan the roads. A MAV's benefit is its ability to inspect a target ‚Äî a suspicious vehicle, structure, or disturbed earth ‚Äî from close range, covering ground much more quickly than an unmanned ground vehicle and without putting people at risk. RQ-16 in use on the field The Iraq trials were so successful that the U.S. Navy placed a surprise order for 372 MAVs, designated RQ-16A T-Hawk, in January 2008 for Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) teams. The 186 MAV systems each consist of two air vehicles and one ground station. In January 2009, the United Kingdom was reported to have ordered five complete T-Hawk systems for delivery by 2010. In April 2010, Honeywell conducted demonstrations of the T-Hawk's at the Counter Terrorism and Jungle Warfare College, Kanker, Chhattisgarh. As a result, Indian security forces are set to conduct user trials. Design The gasoline engine powered RQ-16 is reported to weigh , have an endurance of around 40 minutes, ceiling and an operating radius of about . Forward speeds up to have been achieved, but the G-MAV is operationally restricted to by software. VTOL operation is subject to a maximum wind speed of . Sensors include one forward and one downward looking daylight or IR cameras. U.S. Army service Designated XM156 (or Class I) by the United States Army, the aircraft was intended to provide the dismounted soldier with Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RSTA) and laser designation. Total system weight, which includes the air vehicle, a control device, and ground support equipment is less than and is back-packable in two custom MOLLE-type carriers. Portable in two backpacks This micro air vehicle operates in open, rolling, complex and urban terrains with a vertical take-off and landing capability. It was interoperable with select ground and air platforms and controlled by mounted or dismounted soldiers. The Class I used autonomous flight and navigation, but it would interact with the network and soldier to dynamically update routes and target information. It provided dedicated reconnaissance support and early warning to the smallest echelons of the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) in environments not suited to larger assets. The Class I system provided a hover and stare capability that was not available in the Army UAV inventory for urban and route surveillance. The Class I system also filled known gaps that existed in force operations, such as: Protect Force in Counterinsurgency (COIN) Operations, Soldier Protection in COIN environment, Ability to Conduct Joint Urban Operations, Enhanced ISR/RSTA Capabilities, Hover and Stare operations. The Class I UAV was part of Spin Out 1 and entered evaluation by Soldiers at the Army Evaluation Task Force (AETF). It was to be fielded to Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT) starting in 2011. However, the Army issued Honeywell a stop-work order on January 6, 2011, with formal termination on February 3 the following month. Its role has gone to the Puma AE. Continued service T-hawk of Britain's Talisman counter-IED force, 2012 On September 19, 2012, Honeywell was awarded a support contract for the RQ-16B Block II T-Hawk. Despite the Class I UAV program being cancelled, RQ-16s are still being used in the field in Afghanistan. As of 25 October 2013, the British Army has 18 T-Hawks in service as part of its Talisman suite of counter-IED tools. 15 Field Support Squadron of 21 Engineer Regiment were the first troops to use Talisman operationally, in Afghanistan in 2010. Civilian application at disaster site On Friday, April 15, 2011, a T-hawk drone was used to conduct surveillance of the damaged Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power station. This nuclear plant suffered severe damage as a result of a devastating earthquake and tsunami which struck the east coast of Japan one month earlier. The damage resulted in several of the reactors at the facility undergoing partial meltdown, releasing radioactivity into the local area. The radiation was thousands of times above the safe limit for exposure, making the area unsafe for human habitation. The radiation was intense enough to make even short-term exposure hazardous, preventing people from going in to assess the damage. The T-hawk drone took numerous photographs of the damaged reactor housings, turbine buildings, spent nuclear fuel rod containment pools, and associated facilities damaged by the earthquake, tsunami, and subsequent hydrogen gas explosions at the facility. This allowed Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) to better determine where the releases of radioactivity were coming from and how to best deal with them. On Friday, June 24, 2011, a T-Hawk apparently crash-landed on the roof of the number 2 reactor building at Fukushima.

The confraternity was originally intended for members of the secular clergy only; but as far back as 1898 the admission of members of religious orders was authorized; and by a concession of the superior general of the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament dated 2 November 1902, seminarists in the United States became eligible for admission even before receiving the subdiaconate. History It was established in Paris by Pierre-Julien Eymard, founder of the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament. Already in 1857 he had wanted to adaphis work of Eucharistic adoration as would attract the clergy. to a more intimate and constant intercourse with the sacramental Lord. It was not until 1867 that the plan of a distinct confraternity was matured. The association assumed its mature form in 1879, received the approval of Pope Leo XIII on 25 January 1881, and six years later, on 16 January 1887, was definitively approved and canonically erected by Cardinal Parocchi, cardinal vicar, in the church of S. Claudio in Rome. To this church was attached the Archconfraternity of the Most Holy Sacrament, and it was the canonical centre of the Priests' Eucharistic League; but the office of the central administration of the league was at the house of the fathers of the Congregation of the Most Holy Sacrament, Brussels. Works of the association The specified works of the association were the following: * (1) to spend each week one full and continuous hour of adoration before the Blessed Sacrament exposed on the altar or veiled in the tabernacle; * (2) to report monthly to the local director on a prescribed schedule (libellus) the performance of the above undertaking; * (3) to apply once a month the indulgences attached to the hour of adoration for the benefit of the souls of members who may have died during the previous month; * (4) to offer the Holy Sacrifice once a year for all deceased members of the association.

It is a hunt game where one player plays the deers (which is \\"buga\\" in the Tuva language). There are two deers usually represented as the black pieces. The boars are also referred black in the referenced article \\"Buga-shadara a folk game from Tuva\\". The other player has 24 white pieces with dogs associated to them. The board consist of an Alquerque board flanked on two of its opposite sides by a square patterned board (referred to as \\"side-houses\\" in the referenced article). Because the board is in part an Alquerque board, this makes Buga-shadara a tiger hunt game (or tiger game). What makes Buga-shadara unique among tiger games are the expansion boards on the two opposite sides of the Alquerque board. They are square, whereas most are triangle-like. The word \\"shadara\\" resembles the word \\"shahdara\\". The \\"shah\\" part \\"is a title given to the emperors/kings and lords of Iran (historically also known as Persia).\\". There is a place called Shahdara Bagh in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan, and it's thought that the word \\"Shahdara can be translated as \\"the way of kings\\". Shah translates as \\"king\\" and dara translates as the way of kings.\\" The referenced article associates the boars (the two black pieces) as kings. Perhaps the boars or deers are kings, and have to find a way or have a way with the white pieces or dogs. A variant of the game allows for White to move one of its pieces immediately after it drops a piece in the beginning portion of the game. Buga-shadara is similar to Rimau-rimau especially Version B where the eight men are placed initially around the eight points of the central square, leaving the middle point vacant. Other than having slightly different board designs, there are 22 men in Version B of Rimau-rimau as opposed to 24 men in Buga-shadara. The opening play is also different. There seems to be no additional opening procedures for Buga-shadara, whereas, in Rimau-rimau, the tigers are allowed to initially remove one man from the board, and reallocate one of its tigers onto any vacant point. Furthermore, in Rimau-rimau the tiger can capture an odd number of enemy pieces. Buga-shadara board  Equipment  The board is an Alquerque board flanked on two opposite sides by two square patterned boards. There are 2 Deers represented as 2 black pieces, and 24 Dogs represented white pieces for the other player.  Objective  The Dogs (White) wins if it can block the movement of the two deer pieces (Black). The Deers (Black) win if they capture enough dog pieces (White) so that the Dogs can never effectively accomplish their goal. If the Dogs (White) are reduced to about 10 pieces, the Deers win.  Game Play and Rules  1\\\\. The two deers are initially placed on the vertex connecting the two square expansion boards onto the Alquerque board. Eight dogs are placed on the eight points on the central square surrounding the central point which is left vacant. 2\\\\. Players decide what animals (or colors) to play (Deer/Black or Dog/White). Deers to start first. Players alternate their turns. 3\\\\. The Dogs (White) must first drop the remaining 16 dogs onto any vacant point on the board before he or she can move any of them. This will take 16 turns. The Deers (Black), however, can begin to move and capture from the beginning. 4\\\\. A dog piece (white piece) may move along a line segment onto a vacant adjacent point in a turn. Only one dog piece may be moved per turn. 5\\\\. The deer (black) pieces can move along a line segment onto a vacant adjacent point following the pattern on the board. Only one deer (black piece) may be moved (or used to capture as in the case of the deers) per turn. Only the deers can capture. The dogs cannot capture. 6\\\\. The Deers can capture a Dog piece by the short leap as in draughts. The deer piece must be adjacent to the dog piece, and leap over it onto a vacant adjacent point behind the leaped piece. The leap must be in a straight line and follow the pattern on the board. Only one dog can be captured per turn. Captures are not compulsory.  Analysis  With perfect play, White wins in 40 to 50 moves.

It is located on the shores of Ambarchik Bay, part of the East Siberian Sea in the Arctic Ocean. The Kolyma River empties into the bay.

However, there used to be a few barns and other buildings present in the middle of the eighteenth century when Dmitry Laptev stayed in the village when scouting the coastline from the mouth of the Lena River to Cape Bolshoy Baranov. The importance of the settlement changed in the 1930s when it became a site of a Soviet forced labor camp. As part of Dalstroy the settlement acted as a transit camp for political and criminal exiles before they were moved to various camps along the Kolyma region. The remnants of this system can still be seen in the surrounds of the settlement where the ruins of warehouses, barracks, and cells are to be found along with hundreds of yards of barbed wire surrounding the area. The prisoners awaiting dispersal here built the current port infrastructure, starting in 1932. As well as being a transit camp for the Gulag system, when construction began on the facilities for processing and transporting exiles, a polar research and meteorological station was also constructed in the village, beginning in 1935. The village would then play a supporting role in the Russian exploration of the Arctic. Ambarchik came under fire during World War II when it was attacked by German forces as part of Operation Wunderland. The local population only just had time to arm themselves as German troops attempted to disembark from a submarine, the shallow waters surrounding the port preventing enemy vessels approaching too closely. Formerly the main port on the East Siberian Sea, it was navigable only during August and September. As a result of the shallow waters mentioned above, the usefulness of the settlement as a port was limited and shipping was gradually transferred to Chersky in the lower reaches of the Kolyma to accommodate larger vessels. As a result of this economic transfer, the port and settlement has been all but abandoned. Alleged 1933‚Äì34 incident In an account by David Dallin and Boris Nicolaevsky in their 1947 book Forced Labor in Soviet Russia, it was suggested that in the winter of 1933‚Äì34 the SS Dzhurma, ferrying 12,000 prisoners to Ambarchik, got trapped in the Arctic ice and was unable to move on until the spring.Bollinger, p. 65ff. The story alleged that all prisoners died from frost and starvation with later versions indicating that surviving crew members may have resorted to cannibalism to survive. The story was propagated and widely accepted.Tolstoy, p. 16.Rossi, p. 103., February 3, 2003] access date January 24, 2009 If true, this would have been among the worst ship disasters of all time. In his book Stalin's Slave Ships, Bollinger examined the evidence and found that the Dzhurma did not enter service in the Dalstroi until 1935 and was not big enough to hold 12,000 prisoners. Bollinger estimated that the ship, if overcrowded, would be able to hold up to 6,500 prisoners. In addition, there are no accounts that this ship, which was not strengthened for Arctic travel, made the journey north through the Bering Strait to Ambarchik. Thus the alleged event has been proven not to be true. He suggested this could possibly be the case of a mistaken identity involving the cargo ship Khabarovsk that, if it had been carrying passengers had already had opportunity to deposit them at Ambarchik, and was trapped by ice when returning from Ambarchik in the 1933‚Äì34 winter.

On 4 October 2006 McIndoe was named on the wing in a 40 Year Panthers Legends Team. The same year he was named on the wing in the Illawarra Steelers' \\"Team of Steel\\". Playing career Coming from Emerald, Queensland, McIndoe started playing first grade football for Illawarra in 1983. He made his debut for Queensland in the 1988 State of Origin series, scoring a try in game 1 and playing in all three matches. That year he also represented Australia against a 'Rest of the World' team. The following season McIndoe moved to Penrith and also played in all three matches of the 1989 State of Origin series, scoring in games 1 and 2. In the 1990 season he was, for the third consecutive year, selected for Queensland in all three games of the State of Origin before playing for the Panthers in their Grand Final loss to Canberra. He returned to Illawarra in the 1991 NSWRL season and that year took the club record for most tries in a match with 5 against the Gold Coast and went on to be the League's top try-scorer with 19. McIndoe played his final season with the Steelers in 1993. In 2020, McIndoe spoke to NRL.com about his final year at Illawarra saying \\"I love Illawarra - it will always be my second home but we had a disagreement in my final season in 1993. I got into financial planning and one of my teammates was Dale Fritz. We sat down and he told me how much money he was on ... he was a good player and I told him he could do better and to put feelers out. Another coach found out - and told the Steelers and the shit hit the fan. They wanted to sack me straight away. In the end, they stripped me of the club captaincy, which hurt. But we resolved it and I left on good terms. I had two years as captain-coach of Tumut and then gave it away\\".

Establishment  Throughout Europe, unofficial groups had been operating to selectively breed dogs with profound qualities. While distinct breeds were being established they often differed dramatically, both in appearance and utility, across localities. As a result, in 1891 the Phylax Society (Phylax being Greek for \\"guardsman\\") was formed with the intention of creating a standardised German dog breed by hand-picking, from sheep dogs belonging to local German shepherds, those that displayed superior qualities than those of other dogs.  Disestablishment  The official existence of the Phylax Society was short lived. Early in the group's history there was constant bickering regarding the desired traits of what would become the German Shepherd Dog. Some of the members felt aesthetics were not important in a dog breed, instead desiring that the dog be useful as a working breed, rather than having a pleasing look. Other members preferred that the dog be bred more for beauty with less of a focus on having a working breed. This argument was never settled and after numerous attempts to breed the German Shepherd dog failed by producing dogs with little to no utility, many of the members left; resulting in the Phylax Society disbanding in 1894, only four years after its establishment.  Post-Phylax Society  Although the Phylax Society had disbanded, many former members continued in attempts to breed a dog with superior qualities. It was due to the original formation of the Phylax Society that Max von Stephanitz was inspired to form the Verein f√ºr Deutsche Sch√§ferhunde (Society for the German Shepherd Dog) in 1899, which ultimately lead to the creation of the modern German Shepherd Dog breed.

Rodwell; British Plant Communities: Woodlands and Scrub Cambridge University Press, 1990 Description Ranunculus fluitans has no floating leaves, instead it has long and narrow, tassel-like segments. Reaching up to 30 cm (12 in) long. The long slender stems can have up to two flower stems. The white flowers are held above the water level, they are around 2‚Äì3 cm across. They are daisy-like, with 6‚Äì8 overlapping petals around a central yellow area. It blooms in June, then the rounded seed heads become hairless fruits. It is similar in form to Ranunculus trichophyllus (thread-leaved water-crowfoot), apart from flower petal number, thread-leaved has on 5 petals and shorter leaves, as thread- leaved prefers slower flowing waters. Taxonomy It was formerly described by the French naturalist and botanist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in his book 'Flore fran√ßoise' Vol.3 on page 184 in 1779. The species epithet fluitans is Latin for floating.Archibald William Smith Distribution It is endemic to western Europe. Range It can be found in North Macedonia, Ireland, the United Kingdom, southern Sweden, France, Germany, Poland, Switzerland, Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Slovakia, Hungary and Italy. It grows in fast flowing waters of the UK, within England, Scotland and Wales.

It has an area of 386.6 km ¬≤ and is located in the southwestern Mexican state. In 2010, the municipality had a total population of 26,573. In 2010, the town of Mazat√°n had a population of 6,838. Other than the town of Mazat√°n, the municipality had 177 localities, the largest of which (with 2010 populations in parentheses) were: Buenos Aires (4,260), classified as urban, and Marte R. G√≥mez (1,263) and Aquiles Serd√°n (1,135), classified as rural. A very long archaeological history, going back to 2500 BC, has been documented for this area. Situation Archaeological sites in Mazatan area The name of this town comes from the union of two words in N√°wat. It comes from the Toltec variety of the N√°hua language. Evidence oldest known human presence in Mazat√°n are called traces chanchutos (fossil grain corn, pottery, house), which is credited with a history of more than 5000 years.3 Throughout history, the territory has had several Mazatec sedentary communities engaged in agriculture and fishing. At the time of the conquest Mazat√°n was in charge under Tuxtla Chico, after spending time as an annex of the municipality of Tapachula and appears under the patronage of the Virgin Margarita Concepcion. In independent Mexico Mazat√°n only a colony and became a municipality in Chiapas in 1942. Compared to the rest of the municipalities of Chiapas, Mazat√°n presents less favorable socioeconomic indicators. Although, even neighbor second largest economy of the state of Chiapas, this is the main factor influencing the development of the municipality. The agricultural industry is more than other types of urban services and a significant number of people have that moved to another municipalities to meet their personal and professional needs. Infrastructure and urban services are less developed or are deficient, particularly in the case of drinking water distribution and drainage, which is one of the most important challenges for local governments. Overall, the township has a medium human development, but there are many contrasts inside. The marginalization of the neighborhoods in the outskirts of urban areas is much lower compared to the colonies in the municipal seat. Like most border towns and border state of Chiapas, Mazat√°n received waves of immigration from Central America, mainly from Guatemala and El Salvador. This situation means that in crop fields display a higher number of undocumented workers of Mexican workers. Toponymy The name Mazat√°n comes from pre-Hispanic origin derived from the Nahuatl <<-Toltec and means place of many deer >> Mazat \\"deer\\" as \\"earth\\" or \\"place\\"). Its origin dates from the arrival of the Olmec fishermen. But previously, the area was inhabited by the Mokaya people. Later, the Mam Mayan people populated this area. The nature of the terrain, such as regular flooding, allowed them to carry out their agricultural activities without any problems.  History  During the Preclassic period, Mesoamerican ceremonial centers were established by the Mokaya peoples. Pre-Olmec civilization evolved around 2000 BC with early importation (from Amazon) and development of cacao and Castilla elastica by the Mokaya people with construction of mounds and platforms. (Clark & Pye) Paso de la Amada was an important early ceremonial center in Soconusco area. San Carlos was another center in the area at the same time. Canton Corralito After the decline of Paso de la Amada, Canton Corralito became prominent. Canton Corralito was inhabited previously by the Mokaya people. The site has a long history of occupation beginning in the Late Archaic period (ca. 2500-2000 bc), and then continuing into the Early Formative Barra, Locona, Oc√≥s, Cherla, and Cuadros phases (ca. 1600-1000 bc). During the latter phase, Cant√≥n Corralito was completely destroyed by river floodwaters and covered by a thick layer of sand and alluvium.David Cheetham, The Americas' First Colony? A possible Olmec outpost in southern Mexico. Archaeology Magazine, Volume 59 Number 1, January/February 2006 Also, during the Cuadros phase, this area came in contact with the Olmecs. It was thus described as \\"the Americas' First Colony\\". > What makes Cant√≥n Corralito so intriguing is the incredible quantity and > quality of foreign \\"Olmec-style\\" objects and its location in the center of a > territory occupied for centuries by the Mokaya people, a culture with its > own distinctive traditions and styles.David Cheetham, The Americas' First > Colony? A possible Olmec outpost in southern Mexico. Archaeology Magazine, > Volume 59 Number 1, January/February 2006 Over 5,000 objects produced in the early Olmec style were found here. In fact, many more Initial Olmec (1250-1150 bc) and Early Olmec (1150-1000 bc) type objects were found at Canton Corralito than in the San Lorenzo Veracruz area, the largest and best documented Early Olmec horizon site in the Gulf Coast region. Also, a significant proportion of Canton Corralito objects were determined to have originated in the vicinity of San Lorenzo Veracruz. At the same time, none of the San Lorenzo objects examined so far were found to be imports from any other area.David Cheetham, Cant√≥n Corralito: Objects from a Possible Gulf Olmec Colony.

His Guantanamo Internment Serial Number was 931. Joint Task Force Guantanamo estimate that he was born in 1940 in Logar, Afghanistan. Kuchi is a senior tribal leader within Afghanistan's Kuchis ethnic group. During former President Burhanuddin Rabbani's government (1992‚Äì1996), Niam Kuchi became Deputy Minister for Tribal Affairs. He also became the governor of Bamiyan province during Taliban's regime. The Edmonton Sun described him as the Kuchis' \\"best known leader.\\" Release According to medical records published on March 15, 2007, Kuchi's \\"in-process date\\" was March 23, 2003. Records show that Kuchi was 69 inches tall and his weight ranged from 175 pounds when he arrive to 185 pounds. Nine weights were recorded, his weight upon his arrival in March 2003, and a monthly weigh-in from January to August 2004. Kuchi was repatriated on September 18, 2004, seven weeks after the Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants began convening Combatant Status Review Tribunal, but no CSR Tribunal was convened to review his status. Dawd Gul, one of the other nine Afghan captives repatriated that day, had had a CSR Tribunal prior to his repatriation. McClatchy interview On June 15, 2008, the McClatchy News Service published articles based on interviews with 66 former Guantanamo captives. McClatchy reporters interviewed Niam Kuchi. He declined‚Äîtwice‚Äîto be interviewed by McClatchy reporters. When reporters showed up at his house, without invitation, he told reporters that he got depressed after speaking about Guantanamo. He also told them he suffered from headaches and hypertension arising from the conditions of his detention. The McClatchy report states that other sources told them that Kuchi was a senior leader in the Ahmadzai tribe, which is known as the biggest Pashtun tribe. Thus, many Afghans consider him as the most influential and legitimate Afghan leader. Since his repatriation, Kuchi has worked with national peace and reconciliation efforts. The McClatchy report states that when Americans apprehended him on January 1, 2003, hundreds of members of his tribe came to Kabul to protest. The USA has offered no explanation for his apprehension.

A member of the Navico family of brands, Simrad Yachting develops, manufactures and distributes navigation systems, autopilots, marine VHF radios, chartplotters, echosounders, radars, fishfinders and a wide range of other marine technology.  History  The Simrad name has been in existence for over sixty years. The brand was established in 1947 by Willy Christian Simonsen, who set up his own wireless company called Simonsen Radio. Initially he focused on the production of radio communications for fishing vessels but a few years later coined the name Simrad to encompass a wider range of activities ‚Äì namely the design and manufacture of navigation, communication, auto-steering and fish-finding technologies. In 1996 the Simrad Group was purchased by the Kongsberg Group which, following a decision to focus on the industrial market, sold on the Simrad recreational product range to Altor Equity Partners in 2005, creating Simrad Yachting. Simrad Group and Simrad Yachting are therefore now entirely independent of each other, with separate owners and distinct product specialisations. It was the merger of Simrad Yachting and Lowrance Inc in 2006 that went on to create the Navico Group, now the largest leisure marine electronics manufacturer in the world.  Product range  Simrad Yachting produces a range of navigation instruments designed to withstand challenging conditions and provide navigation solutions for both leisure boaters (via the Simrad Yachting range) and coastal mariners (via the Simrad Professional range). In 2008 the company absorbed MX Marine ‚Äì acquired as a result of the takeover by Navico of the marine electronics division of Brunswick New Technologies Inc in 2007 ‚Äì into its Simrad Professional line-up, further extending its position in the commercial GPS and DGPS sector.

It is located north of Lake Constance and south of the Danube valley. Geography The region is bounded by the shore of Lake Constance on the south, the Hegau region on the west, the Rhine-Danube watershed on the north, and the Schussen valley on the east. It reaches west as far as √úberlingen and north as far as Pfullendorf. The highest peak is Mt. H√∂chsten with a height of . While the lower parts on the lakeshore are part of the Bodenseekreis district, the upper lands belong to Sigmaringen district. Beside Pfullendorf and √úberlingen, the region comprises the town of Markdorf, Meersburg, the municipality of Salem and several smaller communities. History The name derives from a Celtic name Lentia for what is now known as the Linzer Aach river. Prehistoric times The best-known remains of prehistoric human habitation in the region are the Neolithic and Bronze Age pile dwellings on the shores of Lake Constance, of which some examples are reconstructed at Unteruhldingen. Similar Neolithic structures have also been found in a peat bog near Ruhestetten in the municipality of Wald. From the late Hallstatt culture on, the population can be regarded as Celts. Burial mounds have been discovered at H√∂dingen, Salem, and Stetten. Roman times From the first century BC to the third century AD, the area was part of the Roman Empire. Roman settlements existed at Bambergen, Meersburg, and Mettenbuch in the municipality of Ostrach. After the Roman withdrawal beyond the Rhine, Germanic tribes settled in the area. The original Celtic name of the stream gave its name to an Alamannic tribe, the Lentienses mentioned in the fourth century AD by the Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus. Middle Ages As part of Alemannia, Linzgau was acquired by the Frankish Empire in the 6th century, becoming part of the Duchy of Swabia in the 10th. In 1135, the counts of Heiligenberg received the county of Linzgau. From them, it passed to the Count of Werdenberg in 1277, and later to the Count of F√ºrstenberg in 1535. The area was then mostly called the County of Heiligenberg. Modern times In the early 19th century, under the rule of Napoleon, the Linzgau was assigned to the Grand Duchy of Baden, so the name became synonymous with the district of √úberlingen. Today, the area encompasses the districts of Bodensee and Sigmaringen. Linzgau today Today, the only official use for the term Linzgau is the Catholic deanery. However, it is regaining popularity, as shown by the naming of the new shopping center in Pfullendorf the Linzgau-Center or the slogan of Markdorf: Heart of the Linzgau. The regional tourist association also calls itself Bodensee-Linzgau Tourismus e.V. Landscape The southern part of the Linzgau lies on the banks of Lake Constance and has a milder climate, which lends itself to fruit orchards and vineyards. The landscape is rolling, but fairly flat, with occasional drumlins caused by deposits from the retreating Rhine Glacier in the last ice age. The northern part (or upper Linzgau) has a more rugged climate and rises to as high as 833 m. It is characterized by glacial moraines, with occasional swamps and small lakes, especially in the northeast. Agriculture is largely dedicated to grain. Most of the Linzgau is still rural, with the most heavily populated areas along the shores of Lake Constance. The largest cities are √úberlingen, Pfullendorf, and Markdorf. Transport The national highways 31 and 33, which run from east to west along Lake Constance are the only major highways through the region. A car ferry runs from Meersburg across the arm of Lake Constance called the √úberlinger See to connect with Constance. References Based on the article in the German Wikipedia.

M. Poonacha was Chief Minister of Coorg, Minister in Mysore State, Member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha), Union Railway Minister of India and Governor of Madhya Pradesh and Governor of Orissa. Freedom Movement C. M. Poonacha was a descendant of the Coorg Dewans. During the Freedom Movement he was sentenced to imprisonment twice during the Salt Satyagraha in 1932 and 1933. He was again imprisoned in 1940‚Äì41. and in 1942‚Äì44. He became a member of All-India Congress Committee in 1938. Also, in 1938 he was elected to Coorg District Board, became its President in 1941 and in 1945 he was elected to Coorg Legislative Council. From 1945 to 1951 he was leader of the Congress Legislative Party in the Council. He hence became a prominent member of the Indian National Congress party in Coorg. Politics In 1947 Coorg was a separate state in South India until 1956. The other states of South India at that time were Bombay Presidency, Madras Presidency, Mysore kingdom, Travancore kingdom, Cochin kingdom and Hyderabad kingdom. The Coorg State Assembly had a strength of 24 members and the Cabinet consisted of just two members. Constituent Assembly Member (Constitution of India) C M Poonacha represented the Coorg state as a member of the Constituent Assembly. Chief Minister (Coorg) Two parties fought the 1952 state elections: the Takkadi ('Scales of Justice') party under veteran Gandhian Pandyanda Belliappa, who was a dominant political force and voice of Coorg with its anti-merger plank, and the Congress under C.M. Poonacha in Coorg. Poonacha was elected Chief Minister of Coorg State (1952‚Äì56) in the first general elections. Coorg had two MPs in the Union Parliament then, besides having a state legislative body. In 1956 the State Reorganisation Act was passed. Coorg was merged with Mysore and the legislative body at Mercara dissolved. While the Chief Minister was C.M. Poonacha, (who also held the finance portfolio), the only other Minister was Home Minister, Kittur Mallappa. C.M. Poonacha had won the Beriathnad seat while K. Mallappa won the second seat from Sanivarasante. The Congress won 15 seats and Independents (opposing merger), represented by the Takkadi party, won nine seats. Under various circumstances Coorg was merged with the then Mysore in 1956. This election was widely controversial as it was believed that many people from nearby districts of Hunsur, Mysore and Mandya were brought to Kodagu to vote as the government of Karnataka (Congress) believed people of Kodagu will vote overwhelmingly in opposition of the merger. State Minister (Mysore) After the formation of the new Mysore State Poonacha was Minister for Home and Industries under its Chief Minister S. Nijalingappa. He was also Chairman, State Trading Corporation of India from 1959 to 1963. He led the Government of India Trade delegation to some East European countries in 1960 and was the leader of the State Trading Corporation delegation to Japan in 1961. Central Minister Poonacha was elected to the Rajya Sabha in April 1964. Later Poonacha was made Union Minister without portfolio in Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru's cabinet. From 1 to 24 January 1966, he was Minister of State in the Ministry of Finance and from 25 January 1966 to 12 March 1967 Minister of State in the Ministry of Transport, Aviation, Shipping and Tourism. He contested and won the Lok Sabha seat for the Mangalore constituency in 1969. He contested again in 1971 as a candidate of NCO party, but lost. Union Railway Minister After some time he became Union Minister for Railways from 1967 to 1969 (at first interim and then final) and Minister for Steel and Heavy Engineering in 1969. At that time he was the Member of Parliament representing Mangalore Lok Sabha constituency to which Coorg then belonged.http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/uploads/directorate/finance_budget/Previous%20Budget%20Speeches/1967-68_interim.pdfhttp://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/uploads/directorate/finance_budget/Previous%20Budget%20Speeches/1968-69.pdf Retirement=Governor After his retirement from active politics, he served two terms as governor, once as Governor of Madhya Pradesh (Governors of Madhya Pradesh) taking charge on 17 August 1978 and later as Governor of Orissa on 30 April 1980 (Governors of Odisha).

In the name Q-Max, \\"Q\\" stands for Qatar and \\"Max\\" for the maximum size of ship able to dock at the LNG terminals in Qatar. Ships of this type are the largest LNG carriers in the world. Technical description bounding box of Q-max with some other ship sizes in isometric view. A ship of Q-Max size is long and measures wide and high, with a draft of approximately . It has an LNG capacity of , equal to of natural gas. It is propelled by two slow speed diesel engines burning HFO, which are claimed to be more efficient and environmentally friendly than traditional steam turbines. In case of engine failure, the failed engine can be de-coupled allowing the ship to maintain a speed of 14 knots. Q-Max vessels are equipped with an on-board re-liquefaction system to handle the boil-off gas, liquefy it and return the LNG to the cargo tanks. The on-board re-liquefaction system allows a reduction of LNG losses, which produces economic and environmental benefits. Overall, it is estimated that Q-Max carriers have about 40% lower energy requirements and carbon emissions than conventional LNG carriers. The quoted estimates do however ignore the additional fuel used to re-liquify boil off gas rather than burn the gas for fuel. The ships run on Heavy fuel oil (HFO), but the Rasheeda was retrofitted with gas-burning ability in 2015. Contractors Q-Max LNG carriers were ordered in 2005. They are built by Samsung Heavy Industries and Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering.

Known before its naming ceremony as Hull 1675, the ship was named Mozah by Her Highness Sheikha Mozah Nasser al-Misnad. Mozah was delivered on 29 September 2008. It is classed by Lloyd's Register. The first trip by a Q-Max tanker was completed by Mozah itself on 11 January 2009, when the tanker delivered 266,000 cubic metres of LNG to the Port of Bilbao BBG Terminal. Days before, the vessel had transited the Suez Canal for the first time.

Life and career Sucher was born in New York City. He grew up in a large family of Jewish immigrants from the town of Horodenka in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His father Moses, a tailor, died when he was six. His mother sold cigarettes and candy on the Lower East Side. He graduated from the High School of Commerce, where his classmates included Lou Gehrig. He graduated from the City College of New York and was in the first class of graduates from St. John's University School of Law. He was admitted to the New York State bar in 1929, and practiced law for five years. As a side activity, Leonard Sucher began a weekly column for the English- language page of the Jewish Daily Forward, called \\"East of Broadway\\". He applied for a post as a Broadway columnist with the New York Post, and won the job. The editor of the Post gave Sucher an alternative last name, Lyons, for professional use, and thus he became \\"Leonard Lyons\\", an alliterative name reminiscent of Walter Winchell, another noted newspaper columnist of the day. Lyons' first column appeared May 20, 1934, under the banner of \\"The Lyons Den\\", a name devised by Walter Winchell. Lyons worked on \\"The Lyons Den\\" 6 days per week, producing as many columns per week, covering theater, movies, politics and art, a total of approximately 12,000 columns. Carl Sandburg once said of Lyons: > Imagine how much richer American history would have been had there been a > Leonard Lyons in Lincoln's time ... He travelled the world and sent back daily columns, sometimes giving his column to New York-bound travelers with a request they contact the paper upon arrival. He avoided writing about scandal in his column, and thus earned the trust of the many figures he met. One characterisation of his column was as follows: > Lyons ... .never breaks a confidence, and except for a few personal feuds, > notably with Walter Winchell and Bennett Cerf, never spits venom in his > column. The column became a New York institution, and was syndicated nationally first by King Features Syndicate. In 1941, the McNaught Syndicate took over syndication of the column. Lyons received an honorary degree from Wilberforce University and was a Pulitzer Prize nominee. By 1974, the circulation of \\"The Lyons Den\\" had diminished to 18 columns, and Lyons retired with his last column on the exact 40th anniversary of the column, 20 May 1974. New York Mayor John V. Lindsay invited him to City Hall and presented him with a medal and a proclamation honoring him. On the 100th anniversary of his birth, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg issued another proclamation in his name. Lyons and his wife Sylvia were married in November 1934. Their marriage lasted until Lyons' death, and produced four sons: George, a stock broker, Warren, a theatrical producer and singing coach, Jeffrey, a film and theatre critic, and Douglas, a criminal defense attorney. Leonard Lyons' grandson and Jeffrey Lyons' son is the television personality Ben Lyons. Both Jeffrey Lyons and Ben Lyons have continued to use the name \\"The Lyons Den\\" in their respective media outlets for their work. Lyons died in New York City.

Mr. Welsh of Ayr, who after providing several written warnings, prophesied the downfall of the house of Busbie, because the laird refused to suppress the custom of inviting guests to his house on the Sabbath day, and profaning the sabbath by playing football and other games. The prophecy was visibly fulfilled; for although the laird was very wealthy at the time, misfortune was heaped upon misfortune until he was forced to sell his estate, and when he was giving it over to the purchaser, he said with tears in his eyes, in front of his wife and children, \\"Now Mr. Welsh is a true prophet.\\" This laird was the father of the Rev.

The Barony of Robertoun  This barony, once part of the Barony of Kilmaurs, ran from Kilmaurs south to the River Irvine. It had no manor house and belonged to the Eglinton family latterly.

These lands were part of the Lands and Barony of Ardrossan; the following properties were part of the barony: parts of Kilmaurs, Knockentiber, Craig, Gatehead, Woodhills, Greenhill, Altonhill, Plann, Hayside, Thorntoun, Rash-hill Park, Milton, Windyedge, Fardelhill, Muirfields, Corsehouse.  Busbie Mill  The present Busbie farm is marked on the older maps, e.g. 1860, as a mill, with a clear millrace or lade and a sluice. The water was taken from the Carmel somewhere in the vicinity of a dwelling marked as Busbie Holm, rejoining the burn just beyond the mill. It is not clear as to when the mill ceased to operate. It is likely that the mill was associated with the castle and the Lairds of Busbie. A Robertown mill is known to have existed, named from the title of the Barony.

These characters appear in many early Kipling stories.For example, his second collection is called Soldiers Three (1888) \\"The Three Musketeers\\" was first published in the Civil and Military Gazette on 11 March 1887. It appeared in book form in Plain Tales from the Hills (1888). Narrated by the three privates‚Äîmostly Mulvaney, the loquacious Irishman, and Ortheris ‚ÄîThe Three Musketeers tells the story of how the three contrive not only to 'protest' (like the junior officers) against a proposed special parade requested by a visiting grandee, Lord Benira Trigg, but to have it cancelled and humiliate the Lord and receive a five-pound note apiece from him, for being \\"a honour to the British Harmy\\". Trigg is a distinguished tourist, a peer on a 'fact-finding mission' (as we might now say) to write a book. \\"His particular vice‚Äîbecause he was a Radical, men said - was having garrisons turned out for his inspection ... He turned out troops once too often\\"‚Äîhe asked for an inspection \\"On - a - Thursday\\" (the horror is that Thursday is understood to be the troops 'make and mend' day, or half day holiday). Learoyd raises a subscription from the troops to have it cancelled, which is spent on suborning an ekka driver to take Trigg to Padsahi jhil, a large swampy tract of flooded land, about two miles off. They improve the operation by paying Buldoo, a \\"knowin' little divil\\" attached to the Artillery, to take the place of the ekka driver, and to mount a simulated abduction. Once the ekka is capsized into the jhil and Buldoo's three accomplices are banging sticks all over it, Learoyd, Mulvaney and Ortheris 'rescue' the Lord from \\"about forty\\" dacoits\\". He has to recover the next day in hospital, so the parade is cancelled. Trigg is grateful to The Three Musketeers (to the tune of three fivers), and the Colonel of the regiment is suspicious: but Mulvaney believes he would not have charged them with it had he known, as the cancellation of the Parade is welcome to all members of the regiment.The quotations in this article have been taken from the Uniform Edition of Plain Tales from the Hills published by Macmillan & Co. in 1899.

The SSSI encompasses Headon Warren, a heather clad down to the north, the chalk downs of West High Down and Tennyson Down to the south, and the Needles, The Needles Batteries and Alum Bay to the west. The site was notified in 1951 by the Nature Conservancy Council (NCC), for both its biological and geological features, and that designation is now maintained by Natural England as successor body to the NCC. Most of the land within the SSSI is owned and managed by the National Trust. The SSSI Headon Warren is an example of a lowland acid heath and West High Down and Tennyson Down are chalk ridges with a rich calcareous grassland community; the close proximity of these two different plant communities in a maritime setting is of scientific interest. The vegetation on the warren is dominated by heather, bell heather, gorse and dwarf gorse. There is a ground cover of heathland plants, and the Dartford warbler breeds here. There are also areas of scrubland, and the cliffs of The Needles, The Needles Batteries and Alum Bay are included in the site. The chalk downland has a typical flora of calcareous maritime grassland, with nine species of orchids and large populations of such rare plants as early gentian and tufted centaury. On the cliffs, the rare plants hoary stock and rock samphire grow. Breeding birds on the cliffs include herring gull, fulmar, kittiwake, cormorant and shag, with smaller populations of razorbill, puffin and guillemot, and the peregrine falcon also breeds here. The coast between Alum Bay and Totland Bay is of interest geologically, providing a complete sequence of the sedimentary rocks from the Chalk Group to the Bembridge Limestone.

However, it provides a Year 9 date from his reign. At Kawa, a second stelaLondon BM 1777 was also found dated to Year 24 of a king whose name is destroyed. On stylistical grounds, it has been assumed that this stela also belongs to Aryamani who, therefore, must have reigned in Nubia for at least 23 years. The main stela, now in Copenhagen, shows the king at the top in front of Amun-Re, Mut and Khons. In the lower part there is the text, partly destroyed and therefore increasing the problems of understanding the poor Egyptian. The text starts with the year 3 and the partly lost titulary of the king. It follows a prayer to Amun-Re and in the remaining lines donations of the king to the god seems to be listed. They are arranged in an annal style, year 8 and year 9 of the king are also preserved. Furthermore, there appears a year 21 but it remains doubtful whether it relates to Aryamani. The two fragments of the second stela relate to similar donations between year 9 and 23 of an unknown king. A year 24 can be reconstructed but its meaning or context is now lost. The text might be the follow-up of the first stela.translations T√∂r√∂k, in: Fontes Historiae Nubiorum, Vol. II, 522-532 Date of reign The position and dating of the king is highly problematic. The style of Aryamani's stela, his throne and Horus names show Ramesside influences. Therefore, he was placed at the beginning of the third century BC when there were also Ramesside influences visible in Ptolemaic EgyptPtolemy I had for example the throne name Setepenre-Meryamun and when Nubian kings, such as Aktisanes also copied Ramesside patterns. The poor Egyptian language seems to place him around or after Nastasen.Full discussion, see: T√∂r√∂k, in: Fontes Historiae Nubiorum, Vol. II, 521-22 Laszlo T√∂r√∂k maintains that :\\"the Ramessid-style names and the monuments of Aryamani and some other [Nubian] rulers with similar names (Aktisanes, Irike-Piye-qo, Sabrakamani) are to be dated to the end of the 4th and the first half of the 3rd century BC.\\"Laszlo T√∂r√∂k, The Image of the Ordered World in Ancient Nubian Art: The Construction of the Kushite Mind (800BC - 300 AD), Brill, 2001. p.142 Other researchers, such as Robert Morkot regard the Ramesside style as an indication that the king ruled shortly after the Ramesside period.

The three soldiers of the title are Learoyd, Mulvaney and Ortheris, who had also appeared previously in the collection Plain Tales from the Hills. The current version, dating from 1899 and more fully titled Soldiers Three and other stories, consists of three sections which each had previously received separate publication in 1888; Learoyd, Mulvaney and Ortheris appear only in the first section, which is also titled Soldiers Three. The books reveal a side of the British Tommy in Afghanistan rarely seen in the Twilight of the British Empire. The soldiers comment on their betters, act the fool, but cut straight to the rawness of war in the mid-east as the British began to loosen their Imperial hold. Publication history First publication The first publication of a collection of seven stories called Soldiers Three was as No 1 of A.H. Wheeler & Co.‚Äôs Indian Railway Library, a slim volume of 97 pages printed at the ‚ÄúPioneer‚Äù Press, Allahabad in 1888 called Soldiers Three: a collection of stories setting forth certain passages in the lives and adventures of Privates Terence Mulvaney, Stanley Ortheris and John Learoyd, done into type and edited by Rudyard Kipling. In 1899, it became part of the book Soldiers Three and Other Stories, known to most people by the simpler title Soldiers Three. It is this collection whose contents are listed here. To the original Soldiers Three were added nos 2 and 3 of the Indian Railway Library, The Story of the Gadsbys, which is written in dramatic form, and In Black and White, looking more at the native Indians than the British. Both of these were also published in 1888. (The phrase 'Soldiers Three' may be used in writings about Kipling to group the three heroes of this collection: see Learoyd, Mulvaney and Ortheris.) Soldiers Three (in the Indian Railway Library edition) became the second collection of short stories by Rudyard Kipling to be published, after Plain Tales from the Hills (in which the 'Three Soldiers' also appear). Like it, it was collected from some of the fiction he had published in journals; but while Plain Tales was mostly collected from the Civil and Military Gazette, this was \\"Reprinted in chief from the Week‚Äôs news\\", an Allahabad paper.

It was successful in the 1921 Battle of Annaberg and became the core of the Sturmabteilung (SA) in Bavaria while several members later turned against the Nazis. The Freikorps was founded in April 1919 by Rudolf von Sebottendorf, president of Thule Society. The cabinet of Johannes Hoffmann (SPD) flew from Bavarian Soviet Republic to Bamberg. The military control overtook Major Albert Ritter von Beckh (1870‚Äì1958). Most of the volunteers came from Bavaria, and therefore the symbol of the Edelwei√ü was chosen. Direct percursor was the ‚ÄûKampfbund‚Äú within Thule Society, who also was against the Bavarian Soviet republic. In May 1919 the Freikorps fought against the Bavarian Soviet Republic. Parts of the Freikorps were together with Freikorps Epp Franz Ritter von Epp taken to the Reichswehr brigade 21; they fought in 1920 in the Occupation of the Ruhr. The Freikorps itself was dissolved on 21 October 1919. However, all members went to Organization Escherich (Georg Escherich). Therefore, in the Silesian Uprisings 1921 the Freikorps was quickly ready and participated in the conquest of the eponymic hill in Annaberg in Upper Silesia. In Upper Silesia the Freikorps also had a propaganda unit. It is supposed they gave the order to carry out the Feme murders in the Weimar Republic and kidnappings.Ulrike Claudia Hofman: Verr√§ter verfallen der Feme!

B√∂hlau, K√∂ln 2000, S. 118 f.. Separation In summer 1922 the Bund became separated because of the question whether Bund Oberland should be integrated into Bund Bayern und Reich. The civil wing formed Bund Treu Oberland, later Bl√ºcherbund. The military wing was led by veterinarian Friedrich Weber. In 1922 the Bund Oberland had a few hundred members. Until November 1923 in Bavaria were around 2000 members. Amongst them were many students, employees, members of free professions, and also some workers. Most of the military leaders were young former officers, who studied meanwhile. Most of the members were between 20 and 30 years old and had the experience of fighting either in the World War I or in the fights in Bavaria, Ruhr area or in Upper Silesia. They had enough weapons, however many weapons of the Bund were stored and maintained by the Reichswehr. Maybe the Bund was supported by the father-in-law of Friedrich Weber, national publisher Julius Friedrich Lehmann.Harold J. Gordon jr.: Hitlerputsch 1923. Machtkampf in Bayern 1923‚Äì1924. Bernard & Graefe, Frankfurt/M. 1971, S. 94‚Äì96. Under the guidance of Weber Bund Oberland approached continuously to the radical people under Adolf Hitler and Ernst R√∂hm. Together with the \\"Wehrverband Reichsflagge\\" and the SA the Bund formed in January 1923 the \\"Arbeitsgemeinschaft vaterl√§ndischer Kampfverb√§nde\\". In September 1923 they joined together with the Nazi Party and more national organizations the \\"Deutscher Kampfbund\\". From 25 September 1923, the Kampfbund was guided by Adolf Hitler. Beer Hall Putsch On 8 November 1923 the Bund activated many members and participated actively in the Hitlerputsch. Members of the Bund, led by Ludwig Oestreicher took Jewish people as hostages. Because of his participation in the coup attempt the Bund Oberland e.

By act of Gustav Ritter von Kahr the Bund Oberland was dissolved on 9 November 1923.

Licensed to Van Wert, Ohio, United States, the station serves Van Wert primarily but is considered part of the Lima market. The station is currently owned by First Family Broadcasting and broadcasts from its studios on the Lincoln Highway (County Highway 418) just east of Van Wert. History From its first day of broadcasting on Thanksgiving Day in November 1958, WERT/1220, then owned by its local founder The Van Wert Broadcasting Company, has traditionally been a middle of the road formatted music station. WERT's original design engineer was also instrumental in the founding of WMVR in Sidney in 1963. The original owners also built and launched WERT-FM/98.9 in 1962, giving Van Wert its own FM service. WERT AM and FM were then sold to a California company in 1967 for $160,000, according to an article in that year's Van Wert Times Bulletin newspaper. The west coast firm would absentee own and operate the stations for the next four years. Ray Livesay, from Matoon, Il. then purchased the local AM/FM combo in 1971 and operated it throughout much of the 1970s and 80s, boosting the power of WERT- FM to 50,000 watts in 1984. 1988 saw another change in ownership when Atlantic Resources, based in Cincinnati, Ohio bought the stations for a reported $1 million with intentions to move the high power WERT-FM to Ft. Wayne, Indiana, where it remains today as 98.9 The Bear. WERT was then paired with a new FM station licensed to Paulding, Ohio at 99.7 MHz and sold to Community Broadcasting of Van Wert in 1991. In 1994 Chris Roberts (previously with WOWO in Fort Wayne) purchased the local stations after forming First Family Broadcasting, Inc. Programming WERT broadcasts a mix of adult standards from the '40s through today from its studios along historic Lincoln Highway. It is the heritage station serving the Van Wert area, and is co-owned with oldies/sports radio station WKSD 99.7 FM in Paulding (formerly WERT-FM; the original WERT-FM/98.9, is now WBYR serving the Fort Wayne market, and is no longer co-owned with WERT). For many years WERT aired programming from ABC Radio's (now Citadel Media) \\"Timeless Favorites\\" format. After \\"Timeless Favorites\\" was discontinued in February 2010, the station opted to return to locally originating programming. A powerful windstorm powered by the remnants of Hurricane Ike caused damage to its transmitting tower on Sunday September 14, 2008. According to a WLIO-TV news story dated September 15, 2008, engineers from the Fort Wayne area along with Chief Engineer Chris Roberts, also the principal owner, worked feverishly to bring the station back on the air. In the interim, WERT continued to operate with reduced power by means of a temporary antenna and an internet audiostream until Friday September 19, 2008 when the new tower was finished. The station returned to full power late in the afternoon on that day as reported by the Van Wert Independent newspaper.

Antecedents  At the beginning of the 19th century, agitation grew in the American territories dominated by the Spanish crown. The previous century was dominated by the growing support of ideas of individual freedom, which characterized the Enlightenment that took place in Europe and the Americas. Most influential was the American Revolution, with the resulting liberation of the British North American colonies, and the French Revolution, which seeded the restlessness and search for freedom in the Spanish American territories under dominion of the Spaniards. In the Intendancy of San Salvador (covering roughly the same territory as today's El Salvador), many Creoles and other settlers wanted to separate control of the colony from the Guatemalan Captaincy General. This was largely due to economic and political reasons. Greater administrative autonomy or outright independence for San Salvador would reduce the high level of taxes paid to Spain and Guatemala and would raise finances for the colony. Napole√≥n Bonaparte's invasion of Spain in 1808 and the removal of Ferdinand VII from the Spanish throne created an atmosphere of unrest in San Salvador.  Revolt in San Salvador  The insurrectionists organized themselves along with prominent middle-class supporters of the cause of independence such as doctors and priests who took part in the event. These included doctors such as Santiago Jos√© Celis, the brothers (Nicholas, Vicente and Manuel Aguilar) and the priest Jos√© Mat√≠as Delgado. Others included Manuel Jos√© Arce, Juan Manuel Rodr√≠guez and Pedro Pablo Castillo. St. Dominic Church. On November 5 the revolt began in San Salvador. According to tradition, the rebels waited for a signal from the bell tower of the Church of La Merced, but this did not occur on the scheduled time. The rebels later assembled on the town square outside the church where Manuel Jos√© Arce proclaimed in front of the public: \\"There is no King, nor Intendant, nor Captain General. We only must obey our alcaldes,\\" meaning that since Ferdinand VII had been deposed, all other officials appointed by him no longer legitimately held power. A tumult in the square grew to the point that the intendant, Antonio Gutierrez y Ulloa, asked that the gathered name somebody to formally receive their demands. Manuel Jos√© Arce himself was chosen and selected as the leader by the crowd. Despite this, the insurrectionists took arms and proclaimed the total independence of San Salvador from the Spanish crown, but were later subdued. In the following days, the independence movement extended to the cities of Santiago Nonualco, Usulut√°n, Chalatenango, Santa Ana, Tejutla and Cojutepeque. The two other notable revolts occurred on November 24 in the city of Metap√°n and on December 20 in Sensuntepeque. Suppression and aftermath Despite the efforts of the insurrectionists, the cause of independence was not shared by the city councils of the Intendancy . Neither San Miguel, nor San Vicente nor Santa Ana joined them. Unable to amass support, the rebels decided to negotiate with a delegation sent in from the Guatemalan capital to take control. The new Intendant Colonel Jose de Aycinena, arrived on December 8 with Guatemalan troops and priests to force them to swear obedience to the crown and reclaimed the city. The new government was well received by the majority of the population due to Aycinena's policy of understanding and nonconfrontation. However, several days later, unrest broke out in the neighboring Intendancy of Nicaragua, where uprisings broke out in Le√≥n on December 13 and later in Granada on December 22. Nevertheless, both were soon suppressed. Many of those involved in the events in El Salvador and Nicaragua were incarcerated, but Jos√© Mat√≠as Delgado was taken back with the delegation to Guatemala City. Despite his past activities, or perhaps because of them, Delgado was elected in 1813 as a representative on the Provincial Deputation of Guatemala created by the Spanish Constitution of 1812. He also became director of the Tridentino Seminary in the capital city, therefore, he was not in El Salvador at the time of the second insurrection in 1814, and so did not take part in it. He was once again elected provincial deputy in 1820 when the Spanish Constitution was restored, and on September 15, 1821, he was among those who signed the Act of Independence of Central America in Guatemala City. On November 28, 1821, he became political chief (jefe p√≥litico civil) of the Province of San Salvador, and as its executive officer, he led its separation from Guatemala to prevent the former intendancy from becoming part of First Mexican Empire. Arce later became president of the Federal Republic of Central America from 1825 to 1829, once full independence from both Spain and Mexico became a reality. In El Salvador the independence movement and 1811 Revolt is officially commemorated every year on November 5 and recognized as the \\"First Shout for the Independence of Central America\\".

In 1265, Godberd was outlawed for fighting against King Henry III in the Battle of Evesham.http://home.att.net/~sylveastan/mayday/indextimeline.htm Nearly two centuries later, in about 1446, Walter Bower claimed that Robin Hood also became an outlaw as a result of this battle. In October 1267, Godberd settled in Sherwood Forest. He lived there for four years defying the authorities. He could call upon a hundred men, but was eventually caught in 1272. Reginald de Grey was the Sheriff of Nottingham at this time. Godberd was captured in the grounds of Rufford Abbey, and from there taken to Nottingham Castle, but managed to escape. A prominent local knight named Richard Foliot helped Godberd and his fellow fugitives, and protected them from the Sheriff. In 1270, Foliot's Castle Fenwick was besieged by royal troops under the command of Reginald de Grey, who intended to capture Godberd and his companions, but the outlaws managed to flee before the Sheriff's arrival. In 1272, Foliot was accused for his protection of Godberd, and had to surrender Fenwick. This knight resembles the figure of Richard at the Lee in the ballads of the Robin Hood story. Godberd was eventually captured and sent to jail. He was kept in three different prisons over three years while awaiting his trial, which took place at the Tower of London and at which he was pardoned upon the return of Edward I from the Ninth Crusade. He returned to his farm, and lived there until his death.Nottinghamshire legends: Robin Hood However, according to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Godberd died in Newgate Prison in 1276.

Ramachandran Nair, directed by Madhupal and written by Babu Janardhanan. The film sympathetically portrays the social and political issues of the Naxalite era of the 1970s in Kerala. The film's cast includes Prithviraj, Lal, Atul Kulkarni, Rohini, and Dhanya Mary Varghese. Produced by actor Mohan under the Civic Cinema banner and distributed by Lal's Lal Release, Thalappavu marks actor-cum-writer Madhupal‚Äôs directorial debut. The film released on 12 September 2008 (Onam) to critical acclaim. However, in the box-office it failed to recover the cost of production. The film got Kerala State Film Awards for Best Actor (Lal) and Best Debut Director (Madhupal), Kerala Film Critics Awards for Best Film, Best Director, Best Script writer, Amateur Little Theatre Award for Best Debutant Director, Sohan Antony Memorial Film Award for Best Director. The film was screened at the 13th International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK) 2008 and Indian Habitat Film Festival 2009.  Plot  The movie is based on a real- life confession of a police constable (P. Ramachandran Nair) about gunning down a Naxalite (Arikkad Varghese) in a fake encounter as per the order of his superiors in 1970. The screenplay by Babu Janardhanan uses the stream of consciousness flow to show the mental state of the constable who feels deranged after the incident. Lal plays constable Raveendran Pillai whose family life is ruined after the killing of Joseph (Prithviraj Sukumaran), a revolutionary leader fighting for the rights of the hapless farmers of Wayanad. Raveendran Pillai is a misfit in the police force as he is not courageous or cruel as the others of his ilk. He is a family man to the hilt and dotes on his children. He befriends Joseph on the way while on duty. Joseph introduces him to the revolutionary ideas. Raveendran Pillai takes instant liking for Joseph and roams in the forests with Joseph during his free time. * P. Ramachandran Nair's confession was in Nov. 1998 to a magazine, whereas in the film the it takes place in the late 2000s to a television channel.  Cast  * Lal as constable S. Raveendran Pillai (P.

Raveendran Pilla's daughter * Renjusha Menon * Santha Devi as trader women  Production  His dream project Thalappavu was always there at the back of his mind, says Madhupal. \\"I was moved by the story of Varghese, a man who lived for others. More than his politics or his background, what attracted me was his willingness to help the most oppressed sections in society.\\" Babu Janardhanan who wrote the script said he had carried out extensive research on the life of Naxal Arikkad Varghese before capturing it on paper. \\"The spark for the script came from the revelation made by Ramachandran Nair (the police constable) through television channels that he was forced to kill Varghese,‚Äù said Janardhanan. \\"The revelation struck me and I started to think about the mental agony he had to endure by suppressing the fact for nearly 30 years,\\" he said. Janardhanan, the script writer, and Madhupal sketched the whole film, shot by shot. Madhupal says his stint with Rajiv Anchal in Hollywood, Los Angeles helped him polish the quality of the sound track of Thalappavu. \\"For them, natural sound is of utmost importance. They also use it as transitions. Sound will appear before the cut to lead you to the next scene. We have also used sound to enhance cuts and dissolves. Travelling sound also contributed in smoothening the transitions.\\" Parts of the film were shot in Alappuzha, Changanassery and in the rubber plantations near Kothamangalam. Paucity of funds did bog the production of the film and it was released on 12 September 2008. The film was praised for its script (Babu Janardhanan), flawless treatment, acting (Lal) and cinematography (Azhagappan). That Thalappavu was Madhupal‚Äôs crowning glory became clear when veterans like M. Mukundan and R. Sukumaran (Paadha Mudra and Rajashilpi) gave the film their stamp of approval. Litterateur M. T. Vasudevan Nair also expressed a desire to watch his film. However, Madhupal denied allegations that the film set against the backdrop of the Naxalite movement reflected his sympathies for the political ideology. \\"The film is not an attempt to show my sympathy or political views. It is a reminder to a society that has forgotten how to respond to the problems faced by human beings,\\" he said. His new role of a director in Malayalam film industry has made Madhupal a much sought-after star, something that eluded him in his roles as actor, assistant director and scenarist. \\"While walking into a restaurant the other day, I overheard a few taxi drivers saying: \\"See, Madhupal, director of Thalappavu.\\" Till then I had always been referred to as the serial actor Madhupal, villain Madhupal and so on‚Ä¶I am still getting used to this new avatar,\\" says the actor-turned-director.

On 9 May 2016, Faymann resigned from both positions amid widening criticism within his party. Early life and education Werner Faymann was born in Vienna and also attended grammar school there. After graduating from grammar school he enrolled at the University of Vienna (jurisprudence, political science, and history of art). Career In 1981, Faymann became provincial chairman of the Socialist Youth Vienna (Sozialistische Jugend Wien). From 1985 to 1988 Faymann was a consultant to the bank Zentralsparkasse der Gemeinde Wien (now UniCredit Bank Austria AG). The bank at the time was closely linked to the municipal government dominated by the Social Democrats. He left the bank to become director and provincial chairman of the Viennese Tenants' counselling. Subsequently, Faymann became a member of the Viennese state parliament and municipal council, where he held various positions concerning housing construction and urban renewal. Minister of Transport, 2007‚Äì08 Faymann was Minister for Transport, Innovation and Technology in the Cabinet of Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer. Moreover, Gusenbauer appointed him as coalition co-ordinator.Eric Frey (21 November 2008), Werner Faymann: Public promoter of popular ideas Financial Times. Soon Faymann was seen as the likely successor of Gusenbauer. He never challenged Gusenbauer openly, but the chancellor faced an internal party rebellion in June 2008 and voluntarily relinquished the party leadership. On 16 June 2008 Faymann succeeded Gusenbauer as chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SP√ñ) and led the party in the snap legislative elections, held on 28 September 2008. The election was famously preceded by Faymann and Gusenbauer announcing a shift in the party's position towards the signing of new EU treaties, which they did by writing an open letter to Hans Dichand, the editor of the yellow press medium Kronen Zeitung. At the time, the Kronen Zeitung was the largest newspaper in the country. The letter caused a scandal within the party, as no party committee had been involved in deciding the shift. The pro-EU Austrian People's Party (√ñVP) cancelled the existing coalition, thus causing new elections. Faymann was known for his good relationship to Dichand, who would also support him in the following election campaign. Although the SP√ñ lost 11 seats, and had a 6% swing against it (in fact, their worst result since World War II), they came out ahead of their main rivals Austrian People's Party in regard to seats (57 to 51) as well as to share of the vote (29.26% to 25.98%). Afterwards, Faymann renewed the coalition with the Austrian People's Party, as he had announced before the election. Chancellor of Austria, 2008‚Äì2016 Faymann meets German Chancellor Angela Merkel, 11 December 2008 As head of the largest party in the National Council of Austria, Faymann was asked by Federal President Heinz Fischer on 8 October 2008 to form a new government. A coalition between the SP√ñ and the √ñVP was agreed upon on 23 November 2008 and was sworn in on 2 December 2008. In 2012, Austria's government curbed the remit of a parliamentary investigation into high-level corruption and ensured Faymann was not called to testify.Michael Shields (20 September 2012), Austria curbs sleaze panel remit, opposition protests Reuters. In 2013, public prosecutors were looking into whether Faymann and a top aide, Josef Ostermayer, had swayed the √ñBB state railways and ASFiNAG motorway agency to place advertisements promoting him in newspapers during his tenure as infrastructure minister. Both had repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in the breach of trust case, which the opposition Freedom Party (FP√ñ) had asked prosecutors to investigate. By November 2013, Austrian authorities dropped their investigation.Michael Shields (5 November 2013), Prosecutors drop advertising probe into Austrian leader Reuters. On 9 May 2016, Faymann resigned as chancellor and party leader, after losing confidence from a considerable number of party members, despite retaining confidence from a majority of them. His party's candidate and the candidate from its coalition partner, the People's Party, were both historically eliminated in the first round of the presidential elections held on 24 April 2016, resulting in a run-off between Norbert Hofer of the right- wing populist Freedom Party of Austria and Alexander Van der Bellen, an independent endorsed by The Greens. Hofer announced that as president he could dissolve the National Council in order to hold elections, which would at the time probably have led to a win of the populists and thereby forced Faymann to resign. Political positions During his tenure, Faymann is said to have moved his once solidly pro-European party toward a more eurosceptic course, but he kept his distance from the far-right parties. In domestic affairs, Faymann's administration was notable in enacting a wide range of reforms in areas such as education and social security. Initially, Faymann sided with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in supporting the thousands of refugees fleeing wars in countries such as Syria and seeking asylum in Europe.Ralph Atkins and Mark Odell (9 May 2016), Austrian chancellor Werner Faymann resigns after far-right surge Financial Times. Austria took in around 90,000 asylum- seekers in 2015, then more than 1 percent of its population.Francois Murphy, Shadia Nasralla and Kirsti Knolle (9 May 2016), Austrian chancellor Faymann quits after party revolt Reuters. However, support for his policies fell, and the country's institutions struggled to cope with hundreds of thousands of arrivals in Austria,Ralph Atkins (22 April 2016), In a postwar first, Austria's mainstream parties face shutout Financial Times. and he later criticized what he called Merkel's \\"wait-and-see\\" approach to tackling Europe's economic problems and demanded a more aggressive push to combat unemployment in Europe.Michael Shields (8 February 2015), Austrian chancellor says Merkel's economic policy too timid - Kurier Reuters.

It debuted in 1st Issue Special #1 (April 1975), and was created by Jack Kirby. Publication history The first Golden Age version of a character named Atlas in DC Comics appeared in Action Comics #121 (June 1948). The second appearance of an Atlas was in Action Comics #320 (January 1965). The third was in Action Comics #353 (August 1967). The Jack Kirby Atlas' first and only appearance prior to Superman #677 was in 1st Issue Special #1.As seen in 1st Issue Special #1 (April 1975) James Robinson brought Atlas back in Superman #678. According to Robinson, Atlas is going to save humanity: \\"The way I like to look at him is like in the Marvel Universe, Namor is a hero but he really skates the fine line between being a hero and a villain, but he stays on the side of the hero. Atlas, skates that line between hero and villain but he ultimately always falls on the villain side\\". He continued to say that Atlas will become a major player in the Superman mythos moving forward and there will be some real twists to the character. One of the earlier characters named Atlas re-appeared in Grant Morrison's All-Star Superman, where a version of Atlas appears in issue 3. This Atlas is more closely based on the mythological figure of Atlas and competes with Superman and Samson to \\"win\\" Lois Lane, similar to the story in Action Comics #320 from January 1965. Fictional character biography The Jack Kirby Atlas' family and people were slain by the raiders of Hyssa the Lizard King. Atlas was raised by a wise and mysterious traveller named Chagra. Because of an alien crystal carried by Atlas, Chagra theorized that Atlas was one of the people of the Crystal Mountain. Chagra agrees to help Atlas achieve his revenge, but only if Atlas leads him to the Crystal Mountain. Atlas grew up to become a protector of the innocent, but once King Hyssa was defeated, his petulance and darker nature came to the forefront. Atlas returns in Superman #677 as part of The Coming of Atlas storyline and his origin is retold in issue #678 where he is seen saving citizens of Metropolis he himself had endangered. He is currently working with a secret government project that intends to kill Superman. Atlas wants to defeat Superman and replace him as Metropolis' champion on his way to conquer the modern world. He fights the Science Police and Superman.Superman (vol. 1) #677-679 (August‚ÄìOctober 2008) He holds the upper hand on Superman for most of the battle, but is interfered with by his dog Krypto, who seems to be powered by magic. Atlas eventually defeats Krypto and prepares to kill him only for Superman to re-enter the fight and defeat him with some magical enhancement from Zachary Zatara. Atlas' return and fight with Superman was described as part of a ruse intended to test Project 7734, a governmental project that utilizes magic in an effort to kill Superman, who is vulnerable to magic. Atlas continues to work for this project.Superman: Secret Files 2009 #1 (October 2009) Atlas is later kidnapped and brainwashed into fighting the Justice League by an unknown party. After being defeated by the team, Atlas explains to Batman that he has no idea who captured him in the first place.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #42 (April 2010) Other versions=Kingdom Come * A character resembling Atlas appeared in Kingdom Come #2 (May 1996).

Tamdhu comes from Gaelic for little dark hill. The distillery was founded in 1896 by a group of assemblers, wishing to engage in the production of their own whisky. The first malt whisky was distilled and casked in 1897. It quickly passed on into the hands of Highland Distillers. The history of the distillery was fairly quiet, without changing owners, but still marked by a long dormancy between 1927 and 1947. Its production capacity was tripled between 1972 and 1975. The distillery has now 3 wash stills and 3 spirit stills. Its annual production of pure alcohol is 4 million gallons. Unlike its neighbours, the Tamdhu distillery has no roof-shaped pagoda above its malt furnaces. This is one of the last distilleries to malt all of its barley on the spot by a mechanical saladin. It was announced that as of April 2010, the Tamdhu Distillery, belonging to the Highland Distillers subsidiary of the Edrington Group, was being closed and the plant shuttered. It was then sold to Ian MacLeod Distillers in June 2011, who recommenced production of single malt in May 2013. The Tamdhu whisky is almost completely used for the production of blended whiskies, such as The Famous Grouse, J & B and Cutty Sark. Under current owners, Ian MacLeod, Tamdhu's bottlings include a 10 year-old, 100% sherry-matured standard bottling and a non-age-statement (NAS) 100% sherry matured \\"Batch Strength\\". The \\"Batch Strength\\" is in its second edition as of early 2017. Ian MacLeod initially released a \\"Limited Edition\\" bottling of 1000 bottles to commemorate the rebirth of the distillery. These were aged in first-fill sherry casks.http://www.tamdhu.com Previous owners, Highland Distillers, bottlings of Tamdhu included a 10-year-old, 18-year-old and a no- age-statement bottling. Other bottlings are sold by independent bottlers. In 2017 Ian MacLeod released Tamdhu 50. It is a 50 year old bottling from a first-fill European oak sherry butt (cask 4678). It was distilled on 2 November 1963 and bottled March 2017.

In 1735 his father was ousted by his nephew Ali I Pasha, who in 1735 named Muhammad as governor of Sousse. With the help of the dey of Algiers, in 1756 Muhammad attacked Tunis and overthrew Ali. The division of the booty caused however strife between Muhammad and the Algerian commander, the dey of Constantine. Muhammad fled to the fortified city of Bardo, while brother Ali went to Sfax to raise troops. In the meantime the Turkish garrison of Tunis, with the support of the Algerians, set up a revolutionary government, establishing a terror regime which lasted for several weeks. The rebellers, backed by Algerian troops, besieged him, but were defeated by Ali's disciplined and better organized forces. The Algerians were convinced to return to their homeland after the payment of a large indemnity and of a yearly tribute. Thenceforth Muhammad and Ali reigned jointly, the latter succeeding to the throne after Muhammad's death in 1759.

Biography He was a grandson of Ali Turki, governor of Kef, and the nephew of Husayn I Bey. After the latter came to power in 1705, he was appointed governor of Sousse and then named heir apparent (1706). In 1724 he obtained the title of pasha from the Ottoman sultan. Two years later, Husayn replaced him as heir with his son Muhammad; Ali therefore revolted, and, with the help of the dey of Algiers, defeated Husayn in 1735. Soon after his entrance in Tunis, however, he was forced to pay a large indemnity to the Algerian troops camped under the city's walls, amounting to the load of 35 mules in silver, and to promise a yearly tribute of 50,000 rials to the dey. Husayn fled to Kairouan and tried to continue governing in Sousse and the Tunisian Sahel. Ali ordered his son Younes to besiege him. Husayn was captured and executed in 1740, but the latter's sons, Muhammad and Ali, fled and continued the civil war, one from Constantine and the other from Algiers. In 1741 Ali conquered the island of Tabarka from the Republic of Genoa, deporting 1,500 Christians to Tunis. In the same year he sent an expedition against the French Cap N√®gre, which was captured by his son Younes. Madrasa El Bachia In his later years Ali had to face two rebellions. The first one was that led by Younes himself, who was able to seize Tunis, having the local authorities proclaim him bey. Ali besieged him in the citadel and forced him to flee to Algiers. The second came from the sons of Husayn, who were able to gain support from the dey of Algiers and invaded Tunisia with an army led by the dey of Constantine. The army reached Tunis, whose walls Ali had restored and strengthened with a ditch in the meantime. However, this did not prevent the Algerians from storming the city on 31 August 1756. Ali was deposed on 2 September and brought in chains to Algiers, where he was stripped naked and strangled twenty days later by partisans of his successor Muhammad I ar-Rashid.

Luis von Ahn first proposed the idea of \\"human algorithm games\\", or games with a purpose (GWAPs), in order to harness human time and energy for addressing problems that computers cannot yet tackle on their own. He believes that human intellect is an important resource and contribution to the enhancement of computer processing and human computer interaction. He argues that games constitute a general mechanism for using brainpower to solve open computational problems. In this technique, human brains are compared to processors in a distributed system, each performing a small task of a massive computation. However, humans require an incentive to become part of a collective computation. Online games are used as a means to encourage participation in the process. The tasks presented in these games are usually trivial for humans, but difficult for computers. These tasks include labeling images, transcribing ancient texts, common sense or human experience based activities, and more. Human-based computation games motivate people through entertainment rather than an interest in solving computation problems. This makes GWAPs more appealing to a larger audience. GWAPs can be used to help build the semantic web, annotate and classify collected data, crowdsource general knowledge, and improving other general computer processes. GWAPs have a vast range of applications in variety of areas such as security, computer vision, Internet accessibility, adult content filtering, and Internet search. In applications such as these, games with a purpose have lowered the cost of annotating data and increased the level of human participation. History The first human-based computation game or games with a purpose was created in 2004 by Luis von Ahn. The idea was that ESP would use human power to help label images. The game is a two player agreement game and relied on players to come up with labels for images and attempt to guess what labels a partner was coming up with. ESP used microtasks, simple tasks that can be solved quickly without the need of any credentials.Von Ahn, L., & Dabbish, L. (2004, April). Labeling images with a computer game. In Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems (pp. 319-326). ACM. Game Design Principles=Output Agreement Game Games with a purpose categorized as output agreement games are microtask games where players are matched into pairs and randomly assigned partners attempt to match output with each other given a shared visible input. ESP is an example of an output agreement game. Inversion Problem Games Given an image, the ESP Game can be used to determine what objects are in the image, but cannot be used to determine the location of the object in the image. Location information is necessary for training and testing computer vision algorithms, so the data collected by the ESP Game is not sufficient. Thus, to deal with this problem, a new type of microtask game known as inversion problem games were introduced by creator of ESP, von Ahn in 2006. Peekaboom extended upon ESP and had players associate labels with a specific region of an image. In inversion problem games, two players are randomly paired together. One is assigned as the describer and the other is the guesser. The describer is given an input, which the guesser must reproduce given hints from the describer. In Peekaboom, for example, the describer slowly reveals small sections of an image until the guesser correctly guesses the label provided to the describer.Von Ahn, L., Liu, R., & Blum, M. (2006, April). Peekaboom: a game for locating objects in images. In Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human Factors in computing systems (pp. 55-64). ACM. Input Agreement Games In input-agreement games two randomly paired players are each given an input that is hidden from the other player. Player inputs will either match or be different. The goal of these games is for players to tag their input such that the other player can determine whether or not the two inputs match. In 2008, Edith L. M. Law created the input-agreement game called TagATune. In this game, players label sound clips. In TagATune, players describe sound clips and guess if their partner's sound clip is the same as their own given their partner's tags.Law, E. L., Von Ahn, L., Dannenberg, R. B., & Crawford, M. (2007, September). TagATune: A Game for Music and Sound Annotation. In ISMIR (Vol. 3, p. 2). Macrotask Games Macrotask games, unlike microtask games, contain complex problems that are usually left to experts to solve. In 2008, a macrotask game called Foldit was created by Seth Cooper. The idea was that players would attempt to fold a three-dimensional representation of a protein. This task was a hard problem for computers to automate completely. Locating the biologically relevant native conformation of a protein is a difficult computational challenge given the very large size of the search space. By gamification and implementation of user friendly versions of algorithms, players are able to perform this complex task without much knowledge of biology.Khatib, F., Cooper, S., Tyka, M. D., Xu, K., Makedon, I., Popoviƒá, Z., ... & Players, F. (2011). Algorithm discovery by protein folding game players.

Players' choices are used to model better color metrics. The Apetopia game, which was launched by University of Berlin, is designed to help scientists understand perceived color differences. This game is intended to provide data on how the shades of color are perceived by people in order to model the best color parameters.

From 2008 through 2013, Artigo has collected over 7 million of tags (mostly in German), 180,000 players (about a tenth of whom are registered), and in average 150 players per day. Artigo is a joint research endeavor of art historians and computer scientists aiming at both, developing an art work search engine and data analysis in art history. ESP game The first example was the ESP game, an effort in human computation originally conceived by Luis von Ahn of Carnegie Mellon University, which labels images. To make it an entertaining effort for humans, two players attempt to assign the same labels to an image. The game records the results of matches as image labels and the players enjoy the encounter because of the competitive and timed nature of it. To ensure that people do their best to accurately label the images, the game requires two people (chosen at random and unknown to each other), who have only the image in common, to choose the same word as an image label. This discourages vandalism because it would be self-defeating as a strategy. The ESP game is a human-based computation game developed to address the problem of creating difficult metadata. The idea behind the game is to use the computational power of humans to perform a task that computers cannot (originally, image recognition) by packaging the task as a game. It was originally conceived by Luis von Ahn of Carnegie Mellon University. Google bought a licence to create its own version of the game (Google Image Labeler) in 2006 in order to return better search results for its online images.\\"Solving the web's image problem\\". bbc. 2008-05-14. Retrieved 2008-12-14. The license of the data acquired by Ahn's ESP Game, or the Google version, is not clear. Google's version was shut down on 16 September 2011 as part of the Google Labs closure in September 2011. PeekaBoom PeekaBoom is a web-based game that helps computers locate objects in images by using human gameplay to collect valuable metadata. Humans understand and are able to analyze everyday images with minimal effort (what objects are in the image, their location, as well as background and foreground information), while computers have trouble with these basic visual tasks.. Barnard, K., and Forsyth, D. A. Learning the Semantics of Words and Pictures. International Conference of Computer Vision, 2001 Peekaboom has two main components: \\"Peek\\" and \\"Boom\\". Two random players from the Web participate by taking different roles in the game. When one player is Peek, the other is Boom. Peek starts out with a blank screen, while Boom starts with an image and a word related to it. The goal of the game is for Boom to reveal parts of the image to Peek. In the meantime, Peek can guess associated words with the revealed parts of the image. When Peek guesses words that are closer to the image, Boom can indicate whether Peek's guesses are hot or cold. When Peek correctly, the players gets points and then switch roles. EteRNA EteRNA is a game in which players attempt to design RNA sequences that fold into a given configuration. The widely varied solutions from players, often non- biologists, are evaluated to improve computer models predicting RNA folding. Some designs are actually synthesized to evaluate the actual folding dynamics and directly compare with the computer models. Eyewire Eyewire is a game for finding the connectome of the retina.http://eyewire.org Foldit Crowdsourcing has been gamified in games like Foldit, a game designed by the University of Washington, in which players compete to manipulate proteins into more efficient structures. A 2010 paper in science journal Nature credited Foldit's 57,000 players with providing useful results that matched or outperformed algorithmically computed solutions. Foldit, while also a GWAP, has a different type of method for tapping the collective human brain. This game challenges players to use their human intuition of 3-dimensional space to help with protein folding algorithms. Unlike the ESP game, which focuses on the results that humans are able to provide, Foldit is trying to understand how humans approach complicated 3 dimensional objects. By 'watching' how humans play the game, researchers hope to be able to improve their own computer programs. Instead of simply performing tasks that computers cannot do, this GWAP is asking humans to help make current machine algorithms better. Guess the Correlation Guess the Correlation is a game with a purpose challenging players to guess the true Pearson correlation coefficient in scatter plots. The collected data is used to study what features in scatter plots skew human perception of the true correlation. The game was developed by Omar Wagih at the European Bioinformatics Institute. JeuxDeMots ' is a game aiming to build a large semantic network. People are asked to associate terms according to some instructions that are provided for a given word. The French version of the produced network contains so far more than 160 million relations between 2 million lexical items (October 2017). The project was developed by academics of the Laboratoire d'Informatique, de Robotique et de Micro√©lectronique de Montpellier/Montpellier 2 University. Nanocrafter Nanocrafter is a game about assembling pieces of DNA into structures with functional properties, such as logic circuits, to solve problems. Like Foldit, it is developed at the University of Washington. OnToGalaxy OnToGalaxy is a game in which players help to acquire common sense knowledge about words. As implemented as a space shooter, OnToGalaxy in its design quite different from other human computation games. The game was developed by Markus Krause at the University of Bremen. Phrase Detectives Phrase Detectives is an \\"annotation game\\" geared towards lovers of literature, grammar and language. It lets users indicate relationships between words and phrases to create a resource that is rich in linguistic information. Players are awarded with points for their contributions and are featured on a leader board. It was developed by academics Jon Chamberlain, Massimo Poesio and Udo Kruschwitz at the University of Essex. Phylo The Phylo allows gamers to contribute to the greater good by trying to decode the code for genetic diseases. While playing the game and aligning the colored squares, one is helping the scientific community get a step closer to solving the age-old problem of multiple sequence alignment. The problem of multiple sequence alignment is too big for computers to handle. The goal is to understand how and where the function of an organism is encoded in the DNA. The game explains that \\"a sequence alignment is a way of arranging the sequences of DNA, RNA or protein to identify regions of similarity\\". Play to Cure: Genes in Space Play to Cure‚Ñ¢: Genes in Space is a mobile game that uses the collective force of players to analyse real genetic data to help with cancer research. Quantum Moves Quantum Moves is a dexterity and spatial problem solving game, where players move slippery particles across quantum space. Players' solutions on various levels are used to program and fine tune a real quantum computer at Aarhus University. The game was first developed as a graphical interface for quantum simulation and education in 2012. In 2013 it was released to the public in a user-friendly form, and has been continually updated throughout 2014. Reverse The Odds Reverse The Odds is a mobile based game which helps researchers learn about analyzing cancers. By incorporating data analysis into Reverse The Odds, researchers can get thousands of players to help them learn more about different cancers including head and neck, lung, and bladder cancer.http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/support-us/citizen-science- apps-and-games-from-cancer-research-uk/reverse-the-odds Sea Hero Quest Sea Hero Quest is an IOx and Android based game that helps advancing the research in the field of dementia .http://www.seaheroquest.com/site/en  Smorball  In the browser-based game Smorball,http://smorballgame.org players are asked to type the words they see as quickly and accurately as possible to help their team to victory in the fictional sport of Smorball. The game presents players with phrases from scanned pages in the Biodiversity Heritage Library. After verification, the words players type are sent to the libraries that store the corresponding pages, allowing those pages to be searched and data mined and ultimately making historic literature more usable for institutions, scholars, educators, and the public. The game was developed by Tiltfactor Lab. Train Robots Train Robots is an annotation game similar to Phrase Detectives. Players are shown pairs of before/after images of a robot arm and blocks on a board, and asked to enter commands to instruct the robot to move from the first configuration to the second. The game collects natural language data for training linguistic and robotic processing systems. Wikidata Game The Wikidata Game represents a gamification approach to let users help resolve questions regarding persons, images etc. and thus automatically edit the corresponding data items in Wikidata, the structured knowledge repository supporting Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons, the other Wikimedia projects, and more. ZombiLingo ZombiLingo is a French game where players are asked to find the right head (a word or expression) to gain brains and become a more and more degraded zombie. While playing, they in fact annotate syntactic relations in French corpora.http://www.inria.fr/centre/nancy/actualites/zombilingo-le-jeu-de- zombie-qui-aide-la-recherche-en-informatique It was designed and developed by researchers from LORIA and Universit√© Paris- Sorbonne.https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00969157/file/4-Fort.pdf TagATune While there are many games with a purpose that deal with visual data, there are few that attempt to label audio data. Annotating audio data can be used to search and index music and audio databases as well as generate training data for machine learning. However, currently manually labeling data is costly. Thus, one way to lessen the cost is to create a game with a purpose with the intention of labeling audio data.E. Wold, T. Blum, and D. Keislar. Content- based classification, search and retrieval of audio. IEEE Multimedia, 3:27‚Äì36, 1996. TagATune is an audio based online game that has human players tag and label descriptions of sounds and music. TagATune is played by randomly paired partners. The partners are given three minutes to come up with agreed descriptions for as many sounds as possible. In each round, a sound is randomly selected from the database and presented to the partners. The description then becomes a tag that can be used for search when it is agreed upon by enough people. After the first round, the comparison round presents a tune and asks players to compare it to one of two other tunes of the same type. MajorMiner MajorMiner is an online game in which players listen to 10 seconds of randomly selected sound and then describe the sound with tags. If one of the tags the players choose matches that of another players, each player gains one point. If that was the first time that tag was used for that specific sound, the player gains two points. http://majorminer.org/info/intro The goal is to use player input to research automatic music labelling and recommendation based on the audio itself.

Ryan lived during a decisive moment in the development of Catholic social teaching within the United States. The largest influx of immigrants in America's history, the emancipation of American slaves, and the industrial revolution had produced a new social climate in the early twentieth century, and the Catholic Church faced increasing pressure to take a stance on questions of social reform. Ryan saw the social reform debate of the early twentieth century as essentially an argument between libertarian individualists and collectivists concerned with equality, and thus contended that an emphasis on human welfare framed in natural law theory provided the most promising means to combine conflicting concerns over individual and social welfare. Ryan's influential response was the development of a Catholic critique of the American capitalist system that emphasized the existence of absolute natural human rights. While Ryan identified himself primarily as a moral theologian, he also made important contributions to American political life and economic thought. He supported a number of social reforms that were eventually incorporated into the New Deal, and have become elemental to the modern welfare state. Ryan's most well-known contribution to American economic thought was his argument for a minimum wage presented in A Living Wage, a reformulation of his doctoral dissertation. Ryan recognized the importance of a \\"synergistic relation among scholarship, moral teaching, and political activism,\\" which led to his vigorous application of moral thinking to the political arena. Early life Ryan was born on May 25, 1869, in Vermillion, Minnesota, to William Ryan and Maria[h] Luby. Raised in the Populist tradition on a farm homesteaded by his Irish Catholic parents alongside his ten younger siblings, Ryan's childhood experience with the challenges faced by farmers informed his early investment in economic justice and the role of the Catholic Church in promoting social change. Ryan's interest in moral reflection on contemporary economic issues and empathy for the poor was further cultivated in his early teenage years when Ryan read Henry George's Progress and Poverty. While Ryan later confessed to not fully understanding the book at the time, he cites his first reading of George's work as the beginning of a lifelong commitment to questions of social justice. Education and academic life Ryan attended secondary school at the Christian Brothers School in 1887, and continued his studies at the St. Thomas Aquinas Seminary in Saint Paul, Minnesota, now named the University of St. Thomas. He graduated valedictorian of his class in 1892. Ryan was a member of the inaugural class at the St. Paul Seminary, now the Saint Paul Seminary School of Divinity, in 1894. Graduating in 1898, Ryan received his holy orders from Archbishop John Ireland of the Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis. With Ireland's permission, he then moved to Washington, DC, to pursue graduate studies at the Catholic University of America the same year. At the Catholic University of America, Ryan received his licentiate in literature in 1900 and his Doctorate of Sacred Theology in 1906. Ryan saw his own vocation as the teaching of moral theology and economic justice to the American electorate, emphasizing in particular his influence on Catholic voters and politicians. While much of his instruction emerged from the numerous articles and pamphlets he wrote throughout his lifetime, Ryan also held official professorships. He taught moral theology at the St. Paul Seminary from 1902 to 1915, and then returned to Washington where he served as a professor at the Catholic University of America from 1915 until 1939, teaching graduate-level courses in moral theology, industrial ethics, and sociology. During his tenure at the Catholic University of America, Ryan also taught economics and social ethics at Trinity College in Washington, now known as Trinity Washington University. Economic thought Ryan viewed the separation of economic thought from religious and ethical rules as the root of practical economic problems faced by Americans in the early half of the twentieth century. While at St. Paul Seminary in 1894, Ryan read Pope Leo XIII's encyclical Rerum novarum in which he found Leo's statement that all laborers had a right to adequate worldly goods in order to live in frugal comfort, and the state was obliged to guarantee that right. In 1902, American Catholic Quarterly Review published Ryan's essay, \\"The Morality of the Aims and Methods of Labor Unions\\", a piece supportive of unions. Ryan's licentiate dissertation, Some Ethical Aspects of Speculation, investigated the morality of speculation. His Doctor of Sacred Theology dissertation was an influential early economic and moral argument for minimum wage legislation. It was published as A Living Wage in 1906. Ryan insisted in the text that all men had a right to a living wage, adequate to support himself and his family. Always grounding his political thought in moral theology, Ryan argued that Rerum novarum converted the living wage \\"from an implicit to an explicit principle of Catholic ethics\\". Published in 1916, Ryan's second major scholarly work was the book Distributive Justice: The Right and Wrong of Our Present Distribution of Wealth, in which he provided an examination of rent from land, interest on capital, profits from enterprise, and wages for labor in relation to moral principles. As with A Living Wage, Ryan drew on both ethical and economic reasoning; he claimed that all four agents of production ‚Äì the worker, entrepreneur, capitalist, and landowner ‚Äì had a claim to the finished product because each contributed an indispensable element to its production. Ryan further objected at a practical and moral level to both the Puritan industrial ethic and the \\"gospel of consumption\\" that encouraged increased consumption through the production of new forms of demand, such as luxury goods and services. Ryan again saw both these flawed economic views as the outcome of a historic separation between ethics and economic life. Ryan based his own vision of economic progress in America on equitable wealth distribution, decreased working hours, and a guaranteed minimum wage. Clear in Ryan's economic thought was a disciplined commitment to both ethical and practical analysis of his country's economic problems. While A Living Wage has achieved a higher degree of recognition, Ryan stated in his autobiography, \\"Distributive Justice is unquestionably the most important book I have written.\\" In these early publications Ryan staked out an economic position that maintained the primacy of private property but spurned overly acquisitive and unregulated free-market capitalism as economically unhealthy and morally bankrupt. He would argue this economic philosophy for his entire life. Public life Just as Ryan's economic thought was guided by a commitment to moral theology, his political action was inextricably connected to his religious beliefs. Though Ryan was primarily an intellectual and moral theologian, his deep conviction that the church had a proper role to play in public affairs led him to maintain a consistent engagement in American politics throughout his lifetime. Ryan avoided political labels such as liberal or conservative, but eventually settled on \\"papalist\\" to describe his public position, meaning \\"an orthodox commitment to the Holy See.\\" Ryan viewed the proper role of the state as the active promotion of the common good only to the extent that it cannot be realized through the family or voluntary associations. Ryan was among the earliest advocates of minimum wage laws in the United States. Program for social reconstruction Aside from his influential texts A Living Wage and Distributive Justice, and a number of other political and economic pamphlets, Ryan authored the \\"Program for Social Reconstruction\\" in 1919, a text that was adopted by the Administrative Committee of the National Catholic War Council as a statement of their social and economic objectives and became the Bishops' Program of Social Reconstruction. A number of authors have cited the text as a blueprint for the New Deal legislation, though others have also stated that such connections have been exaggerated. However direct Ryan's influence was on the New Deal, the text offered liberal social reforms that emphasized an active role for the state in promoting social justice, many of which were enacted during President Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration. Yet, the text also involved a number of less successful reforms that defy popular interpretations of Ryan as a strictly liberal political thinker, such as a federal ban on the dissemination of information on birth control and rigid support for abortion laws. What is most evident in the \\"Program for Social Reconstruction\\" is Ryan's systematic application of Catholic ethics to social reconstruction. Political activities Beyond authoring political texts, Ryan also took a number of decisively political actions. While teaching at St. Paul Seminary, Ryan took an active interest in trade unions, promoting their cause to outside groups, addressing union gatherings, and helping to author and promote social legislation. In 1923, Ryan initiated the Catholic Conference on Industrial Problems. After teaching at the Catholic University of America, Ryan became head of the Social Action Department of the National Catholic Welfare Conference, a position that allowed him substantial opportunities to influence politicians in Washington. He was a noted supporter of the failed Child Labor Amendment to the US Constitution, despite opposition from the influential Archbishop of Boston, Cardinal William Henry O'Connell. Ryan also worked actively with the National Consumers' League, which attempted to encourage consumers to push for decent working conditions. In 1927, Ryan founded the Catholic Association for International Peace. Ryan was such a fervent supporter of the New Deal that he was nicknamed \\"Monsignor New Deal\\". 1n 1931, Ryan urged the federal government to develop a $5-billion public works campaign. In 1933, the Roosevelt administration enlisted Ryan's assistance in mustering support among Catholic clerics for its NRA codes. In 1934, Ryan was elected to the three-person Industrial Appeals Board of the National Recovery Administration. One of Ryan's most controversial ventures into American politics was his national radio endorsement of Democratic Party candidate Franklin D. Roosevelt when he ran for re-election as President in 1936. When the \\"Radio Priest\\", Charles Coughlin, turned vehemently against Roosevelt and the New Deal during the 1936 presidential campaign, and encouraged his listeners to vote instead for William Lemke of Coughlin's new Union Party,See . Ryan countered with an overtly partisan political speech (\\"Roosevelt Safeguards America\\") broadcast on national radio on October 8, 1936, urging Catholics to repudiate Coughlin and support the New Deal and Roosevelt. Wary of the potential controversy his speech could arouse, he began the endorsement by stating, \\"I am making tonight what is liable to be called a political speech. It is not that. It is mainly a discussion of certain political events in the light of moral law.\\" Nevertheless, the endorsement led Ryan into open conflict with Coughlin, who gave Ryan the sarcastic sobriquet \\"The Right Reverend New Dealer\\". The speech also cost Ryan the confidence of Archbishop Michael J. Curley of Baltimore. On January 20, 1945, he gave the benediction at the inauguration of President Franklin Roosevelt's fourth term. Reception During his lifetime, Ryan met fierce criticism for his economic and political thought. He was at times labeled a socialist for his endorsement of policies such as public housing, social security, medical insurance, unemployment insurance, and women's rights in the work place as well as for his critique of unregulated free-market capitalism. Refusing to prescribe to either a liberal or conservative political doctrine but instead choosing to support policies based on his theological beliefs, Ryan displeased both liberal and conservative politicians at times. Ryan's overtly political acts also earned him disapproval within the Catholic Church. Yet Ryan was also a deeply respected moral theologian throughout his lifetime. With his position with the National Catholic Welfare Conference, he was authorized by the bishops as their principal Catholic spokesman for social reform within the United States, and became the first Catholic priest to deliver the benediction at a presidential inauguration in 1937. Death and legacy After a short illness, Ryan died on September 16, 1945, in his home state of Minnesota. He is remembered today as an early and essential advocate for social reform in the first half of the twentieth century. He maintains a unique role in the history of the American Catholic tradition as a pioneer in the application of Catholic theology to questions of social justice in industrial society. The John A. Ryan Institute for Catholic Social Thought at University of St. Thomas explores the relationship between the Catholic social tradition and business theory and practice by fostering a deeper integration of faith and work.

History  Since the mid 17th century, an inn has stood near to the locality's green. The site is now occupied by The Bladebone Inn. In the 18th century, Chapel Row became known for its revels, which were held on the Monday following the feast of Saint Anne. The revels featured events such as backswording (described by Joseph Addison in The Spectator as \\"a ring of cudgel players who broke one another's heads in order to make some impression on their mistresses' hearts\\"). The sport was not featured in a number of later fayres as at least one contender was reported to have been killed.

In the 19th century, the Grand Duchy of Hesse consisted of three provinces. Between the rivers Rhine, Main and Neckar the province of Starkenburg embraced the Odenwald and the Hessian Ried. It also included the ducal residence of Darmstadt. West of the Rhine, was the province of Rhenish Hesse (Rheinhessen) with the towns of Mainz, Worms and Bingen. The province of Upper Hesse (Oberhessen), which included the Vogelsberg and the Wetterau was not directly linked by land to the others. As a result of its lack of territorial integrity, the state did not initially build its own state railway. Rather it took part in joint state railway projects with its neighbouring states: These were the: * Main-Neckar Railway with Frankfurt and Baden * Main‚ÄìWeser Railway with Frankfurt and Kurhessen * Frankfurt-Offenbach Local Railway with the Free City of Frankfurt As for the rest, a large number of projects by the private Hessian Ludwig Railway Company was encouraged. Not until 1876 did the Grand Duchy of Hesse found its own state railway. Its basis was the acquisition of the Upper Hessian Railway Company. This opened and operated the Vogelsberg and Lahn-Kinzig lines from Giessen between 1869 and 1871. In 1880, of a total of of route, lay in Hessen- Darmstadt and in Prussia. After its transition into state ownership, the network was expanded in accordance with a statute of 29 May 1884, by three branch lines, that fed into the Giessen - Gelnhausen line in the Vogelsberg region: * Nidda‚ÄìSchotten railway from 26 May 1888 * Stockheim‚ÄìGedern railway from 1 October 1888 * Hungen‚ÄìLaubach railway from 1 June 1890 Another state branch line, the Eberstadt‚ÄìPfungstadt railway was opened on 20 December 1886.

The school traces its history back to at least 1828. It operated independently until its merger with Firth College and Sheffield Technical School in 1897, and is now an integral part of Sheffield's Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health. The medical school consists of four academic and research departments, which are Academic Unit of Medical Education; Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease; Neuroscience; and Oncology and Metabolism, and is active in three fields of medicine: teaching, researching and practising. Sheffield was ranked 12th in the UK in clinical, pre-clinical and health in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2020. As of 2020, its five-year MBChB programme admits 273 home students and a further 18 overseas students per year. It is a founding member of the UCAT consortium and one of 32 bodies entitled by the General Medical Council to award medical degrees in the UK. History=First medical school in Sheffield Engraving of Surrey Street in Sheffield in . The Sheffield Medical Institution is on the right of the image. Surgeon apothecary Hall Overend started medical teaching in Sheffield as early as 1811. Medical training was then unstructured due to apprenticeship until the Apothecaries Act 1815 came into force. The act empowered the Society of Apothecaries in London to regulate medical profession throughout England and Wales, as well as to award licence to practise, the Licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries (LSA). Although Overend was never registered with the Society of Apothecaries as a lecturer, he began to develop his own School of Practical Anatomy and Medicine in Sheffield, which became the oldest higher education establishment in the city, and one of the earliest English medical schools outside London. The school received external recognition in 1828, when its teachers were formally registered with the society. Overend taught with examples illustrating natural history, anatomy, pathology and chemistry. He also conducted demonstrations of dissection at his Church Street home, in an anatomy museum that was converted from a malt house. The cadavers used for teaching human anatomy in his school were illegally provided by resurrectionists, which was common in the 19th century. Overend presented his apprentices for the LSA since 1815 and seven of them had successfully passed the examination between 1816 and 1826. Hall Overend's son, Wilson Overend, also qualified as a lecturer with the Society of Apothecaries in 1828. In the late 1820s, physicians and surgeons of the Sheffield General Infirmary, the first hospital in the city, stated that a medical school connected with a public hospital would have greater eligibility for recognition by the Society of Apothecaries, compared with one that run by private individuals. Arnold James Knight, a physician at the infirmary, made a motion to found a public medical school in Sheffield in 1828, which was seconded by Hall Overend. Wilson Overend took over ownership of his father's medical school at the beginning of 1829, since his father transferred his support to the new school. Wilson continued his school as Sheffield School of Anatomy and Medicine at the corner house between Eyre Street and Charles Street, until was burnt down in 1835 following a riot; the wife of the caretaker of the premises shouted out \\"murder\\" when the alleged drunk caretaker and his friend proceeded to beat her. The crowd misinterpreted the noise as the men were attempting to murder or burke the woman, broke into the building and set fire. Independent medical school Sir Arnold Knight founded the Sheffield Medical Institution in 1829. The new medical school was formally opened as the Sheffield Medical Institution on 2 July 1829 at the end of Surrey Street. Knight laid the foundation stone in 1829 and gave an opening lecture describing the systematic programme of medical education. Operated in a similar way to Hall Overend's school, the Sheffield Medical Institution was however corporately owned and provided facilities for doctors who were already in practice. It had a lecture room with 100 seats, a dissecting room and a museum with library. The teachers for the institution were unpaid and were drawn from the consultants at the General Infirmary, as well as at the Public Dispensary (founded in 1832 also by Knight). The Sheffield Medical Institution was renamed Sheffield Medical School in 1865, and in 1868 the Sheffield School of Medicine. Mariano Alejo Martin de Bartolom√© was President of the Medical School for 22 years since 1866. Throughout the 19th century, the medical school collaborated with the Sheffield Children's Hospital and Jessop Hospital for Women to provide all the medical teaching. The school struggled to survive and was near to closure twice in 1865 and 1882. This was caused by the resignation of the lecturers and the difficulty of recruiting new ones. There was also competition for public funds between the school and other local hospitals (including the specialist Lodge Moor Hospital and newly-founded Northern General and Nether Edge hospitals). Firth College, established in 1879 by Mark Firth, saved the medical school from collapse by taking over the teaching of all preliminary science subjects to medical students. The two local institutions hence became intertwined. In 1883, the Mayor of Sheffield and the Master Cutler (an ambassador of industry in Sheffield) appealed to the public for funds to build a new medical school building to replace the original one in Surrey Street, leading to the relocation of the Sheffield School of Medicine in 1888 from Surrey Street to a new premises on Leopold Street, opposite Firth College. The new building contained classrooms, a tiered lecture theatre, a dissecting room, a library and a museum. In late 19th century, Principal of Firth College William Mitchinson Hicks had an ideal to bring into Sheffield a university. The first stage to accomplishing this was the union the city's higher education institutions (the medical school, Firth College and the Sheffield Technical School) into one university college. In 1897, the merger of the three institutions resulted in the University College of Sheffield. The medical school became one of its departments. Medical School at the university The Royal Hallamshire Hospital and the B Road entrance to the Medical School. In 1905, the university college received its royal charter to become the University of Sheffield. Medicine was a founding faculty at the university, along with Arts, Pure Science and Applied Science. The Medical Faculty was moved from Leopold Street to the North Wing of Firth Court, which was adjacent to Back Lane where bodies could be discreetly delivered to the dissecting room. The Medical School chose red as the colour of its academic hoods in 1908. Lydia Manley Henry, enrolled in 1909, was one of the first female students admitted to the Medical School. She graduated MBChB in 1916 and was awarded an MD later in 1920. The Medical School moved in 1973 to its current building on Beech Hill Road, adjacent to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital. Overend is now regarded as the father of medical education in Sheffield. The School of Medicine was renamed the Medical School and in 2001 School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, offering medicine MBChB and orthoptics BMedSci degree courses. The school changed its name back to the Medical School in 2011, and later the orthoptics course moved to the Health Sciences School of the university. Departments=Academic Unit of Medical Education The Academic Unit of Medical Education is an academic department of the medical school. It includes the Clinical Skills Centre, Medical Teaching Unit and the Academic Unit of Primary Medical Care. Clinical Skills Centre, based at the Northern General Hospital, contains facility for healthcare training including mock clinical wards, resuscitation suites and high-fidelity simulation theatres. The Medical Teaching Unit (MTU) is located on the Western Bank Campus of the university, providing anatomical learning through human dissection. It has two dissection spaces and 14 teaching bays, over 2,500 pathology specimens, and a large number of pre-dissected anatomical material. The MTU also has its own plastination unit for the long-term preservation of human body parts. Whole body cadaveric dissection is offered to MbCHb Medical and BSc Biomedical Science students at Sheffield. The Academic Unit of Primary Medical Care focuses on general practice and primary care, which combines undergraduate teaching and medical research. Postgraduate and research departments The Medical School provides postgraduate taught (MSc and MRes) and research (MD and PhD) programmes, which are available through three departments. The Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease is a research centre for immunology, cardiology and imaging. The Department of Neuroscience focuses on neurodegenerative diseases, including motor neuron disease, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. The Department of Oncology and Metabolism organises education and research in the field of oncology, endocrinology and reproduction. Campus Sheffield Medical School is located on Beech Hill Road attaching to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital's main Tower Blocks. The Medical School building contains 3 lecture theatres, 8 seminar rooms and group meeting spaces with a total of 110 seats. Sheffield Biorepository, a storage facility for human tissues approved under the Human Tissue Act 2004, is housed in the building. The Samuel Fox House at the Northern General Hospital is home to the school's Clinical Skills Centre and Academic Unit of Primary Medical Care. It has 3 simulated wards containing 5 bed spaces per room, simulated home for occupational therapy practice, multi-functional rooms for skills training and lecture rooms of a total of 85 seats. Libraries The school maintains two libraries collectively known as the Health Sciences Library. It was first opened at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in 1978, and a branch was created at the Northern General Hospital in 1979, which was relocated to its current location in Samuel Fox House in 1998. The Health Sciences Library at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital has collections cover medicine, dentistry, nursing and midwifery, with 85 study spaces. The library at the Northern General Hospital also houses material for medicine and nursing.

Academics=Teaching The standard undergraduate Medicine course is a five-year programme leading to an MBChB (Medicinae Baccalaureus Chirurgiae Baccalaureus) degree. The course is divided into four phases. The structure of Phase 1 (first year) follows the General Medical Council's guidelines and focuses on the structure and function of the human body. Phase 2a (second year) starts with a six-week research project followed by training in procedural clinical skills in simulation. In Phase 2b (first half of third year), students undertake a three-week introduction to basic clinical skills and a 12-week longitudinal integrated clinical placement in one of the Sheffield's teaching hospitals. Phase 3 (second half of third year and fourth year) is clinically based. Phase 4 (final year) consists of a series of lectures and two longitudinal integrated placements in a different hospital and clinical area from Phase 2b. The school also runs a four-year graduate entry Medicine MBChB programme for graduates with a life sciences degree. Students on this course bypass Phase 1 of the five-year programme. Research The Medical School has currently 18 research themes, which are: bone and joint; cancer; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular disease; dementia; endocrinology; enhancing the potential of learners; functional neurology and epilepsy; genomic medicine and bioinformatics; imaging; immunity; infection; motor neuron disorders; Parkinson's disease; primary medical care; reproduction; social accountability; and translational neuropsychology. The school has been associated with a number of notable medical discoveries. In the 1920s, Edward Mellanby's studies on rickets established that cod liver oil prevented the disease, which helped lead to its eradication. In the 1930s, Cecil Payne became the first to use Penicillin to effect a cure. Also in the 1930s, Sir Hans Krebs made significant advancements in the study of cellular energy, codifying his observations in the Krebs Cycle, for which work he received a Nobel Prize in 1953. Motto and coat of arms Crest of the school on the Medical School building The motto of the Sheffield Medical School is Ars longa vita brevis, a Latin translation of an aphorism from Aphorismi by Greek physician Hippocrates. It translates in English as \\"Art is long, life is short\\", referring to the difficulty in acquiring and practising the art of medicine. A stone carving bearing the motto was displayed on the Sheffield Medical Institution building on Surrey Street, from 1829 until the demolition of the building in 1965. The original stone is now situated close to the entrance of the medical school on Beech Hill Road. The coat of arms of the Sheffield Faculty of Medicine was granted by the College of Arms on 12 December 2003. It features elements from the coat of arms of the University of Sheffield: the Crown of Success, two sheaves of arrows and the open books, as well as the azure background colour. The rod of Asclepius is centred on the shield. It can be seen throughout the Medical School on its buildings. A variation of the crest is used by various Sheffield Medical Society sports teams. Student life Representing over 2000 medical students on campus, Sheffield Medical Society (MedSoc) is the largest society at the University of Sheffield Students' Union. The MedSoc has 33 academic and non-academic sub-societies as well as its own sports teams.

Early life and education  Giay attended junior high school in Tiom (Paniai) from 1960 to 1967. In 1971 he went to a teacher training school also in Tiom. He started his studies in social work at the Cenderawasih University (UNCEN) in Jayapura, Papua, Indonesia in 1974. From 1980 to 1983, he studied for a Master of Divinity degree at the Asian Theological Seminary, in Manila, the Philippines. He was ordained as a pastor in the Kemah Injil Church (KINGMI) (Gospel Tabernacle Church), which was founded by the Christian and Missionary Alliance. In 1983, he was appointed lecturer at the Jaffray Theological College in Makassar, South Sulawesi and for three years he also taught courses for pastors in Kalimantan. In 1987, Giay returned to Papua to work as a pastor. He took the initiative of establishing the Walter Post Theological College there, so that students would not have to go all the way to Makassar if they wanted to study for the ministry. From 1990 to 1995, he did his doctoral studies in social anthropology at the Free University in Amsterdam. He did field work in Paniai, Papua, from June 1991 to March 1992. He graduated in 1995 with a thesis on the Wege Bage, a new religious movement led by Zakheus Pakage in his home district of Paniai.  Academic work  The research of Benny Giay is focused on the role of religion and the Christian faith in Papuan society. He did research on new religious movements, in particular on cargo cults in the Papuan context. This term can be considered derogatory, as it assumes that Papuans are primitive people who have an unrealistic and irrational way to acquire material goods; it also assumes that their religious feelings and expressions can be reduced to this attitude. Giay describes these new movements with sympathy and often from an insider's perspective. His doctoral thesis was a study of the Wege Bage Movement in his home regency (Paniai), a movement that had been initiated by Zakheus Pakage. Several of Giay's relatives had joined the movement. Giay sees the movement as a legitimate way to reconcile traditional culture and Christianity, though as a member of the evangelical KINGMI Papua Church, he is also critical of it. Giay calls on followers of the Wege Bage Movement not to close themselves off from a discussion on the Christian truth with other churches, and he also appeals to his own church not to condemn the movement, but to initiate a dialogue. In later publications Giay advocates a church that is active in the human rights movement, and which is a spokesperson for Papuans, who are victims of repression by the Indonesian security forces. He advocates a theology that is inspired by liberation theologians and by Frantz Fanon. He pleads for the recognition of the right of Papuans to their own cultural and ethnic identity. Papuans, in his view, are Melanesians, with a black skin and frizzy hair, and they can never become Indonesians with amber-coloured skin and straight hair. He wrote an article on the origins of the Papuan political movement called Papua Zone Damai and Papua Tanah Damai ‚Äî the Papua Peace Zone and the Papua Land of Peace project. This a non-violent spiritual movement of Papuans fighting for their rights. It is supported by churches and by several NGOs. At the Second Papua Congress of May‚ÄìJune 2000, the Papua Council (Dewan Papua) gave Giay the task of initiating a debate on rectifying Papuan history (meluruskan sejarah). The purpose of the project is to give Papuans their own history back, to demand recognition for Papuan heroes and to honour the many Papuan victims of Indonesian repression since 1962. In the context of this project he has written several studies, like the biographies of Theys Eluay, Rev Herman Saud and of John Rumbiak. He also wrote a local church history of the Nduga Regency of Papua (see also list of publications below).  The Papuan Struggle  On returning to Papua in 1995 after his studies in the Netherlands, Giay became a lecturer in Church and Society and Contextual Theology at the Walter Post Theological College where he established a Postgraduate Program Church and Society. He has also been active in the Papua movement. In July 1998, he took the initiative to establish the Forum for the Reconciliation of Irian Jaya Society (FORERI).\\"Forum for the Reconciliation of Irian Jaya Society (FORERI),\\" July 24, 1998. Signed by the Reverend Herman Saud, MTh, chair of the Christian Evangelical Church (GKI) in Irian Jaya; Dr. Leo Laba Ladjar OFM, Bishop of Jayapura; The Rev. Dr. Benny Giay, on behalf of the regional chair of the Christian Missionary Alliance (GKII); Theys Eluay and Tom Beanal, traditional leaders; Selviana Sanggenafa SH and Yusan Yeblo, Women's Group; Gerson Abrauw, Maria Korano, and Martinus Werimon, students It aimed at a discussion on ways in which Papuans could have \\"an opportunity to handle their own affairs\\" whether through full independence, through wide- ranging autonomy within the Indonesian unitary state, or through the formation of a federal system in which the province of Irian Jaya (now the provinces of Papua and West-Papua) would enjoy substantial autonomy. FORERI helped to set up the national dialogue in Papua, initiated by President B. J. Habibie. This resulted in 100 Papuans, representing the various districts, unanimously demanding independence from Habibie in February 1999.https://www.hrw.org/reports/2000/papua/Pap004-03.htm#P154_38609 Benny Giay was elected by the Second Papua Congress in Jayapura in June 2000 to be a member of the Presidium of the Papua Council (Presidium Dewan Papua or PDP). This Congress, with representatives from all the regions of West Papua, debated the political future of Papua. He was charged with the \\"straightening of Papua history\\"(meluruskan sejarah Papua). To help the discussion he published a pamphlet Towards a New Papua, providing resource material to help Papuans discuss their future. He also later supported the initiative to turn the Papua struggle into a peaceful, non-violent struggle with the establishment of Zones of Peace and Papua as a Land of Peace (Tanah Damai). In July 2002 the local organisation for the defence of human rights ELSHAM, the churches and the PDP set up a Peace Task force, with Benny Giay as its head. Its primary objective is to pursue reconciliation among Papuans through peaceful dialogue. Giay's book Peristiwa penculikan dan pembunuhan Theys H Eluay 10 November 2001 (The Abduction and Assassination of Theys H Eluay on November 10, 2001)\\" was banned by the local authorities in West Papua. The book was considered dangerous to national unity. At the Synod Conference of the Gereja Kemah Injil (KINGMI) Papua Church in 2010 Benny Giay was elected chairman of the Synod.See: http://voiceofkingmipapua.blogspot.com/2011/02/autokritik-menjadi-gereja- penyembuh.html In December 2011 he was in that capacity a member of a team of four Papuan church leaders that met President Susilo Bandang Yudhoyono to argue in favor of a dialogue between the Indonesian Government and the Papua people in the presence of a neutral observer. Honours In 2003 Benny Giay received the Tanenbaum Peace Makers Award.

He played cricket for the RMA side during 1917 and 1918, but left the academy without graduating in September 1918, the school register noting that he had \\"dipped below standard\\".Quoted in Lewis Op. cit., p.172.

Early years=The Jackie Fountains Hans W√§rmling was the guitar player in a rhythm and blues band called The Jackie Fountains, that formed in 1964 and played in the Gnesta area of Sweden until 1967.

In this band he was known by the nickname of 'Hasse'.The Jackie Fountains, a history by Peter W√§rmling Retrieved: 2 August 2008 Johnny Sox In 1972, a young Hugh Cornwell had travelled to Lund in Sweden and took up a position in the local university hospital whilst studying for a PhD in biochemistry.Cornwell 2004, p. 40. Cornwell became friends with Hans W√§rmling who happened to be working as a nurse at the same hospital. W√§rmling suggested that Hugh Cornwell could provide English lyrics to some of the 500 songs that he had recorded on a reel to reel tape recorder and they quickly became close friends.Cornwell 2004, p. 46 Other musicians (Jan Knutsson, Gyrth Godwin and 'Chicago Mike') were recruited to form the band 'Johnny Sox'. In 1973, Cornwell decided to end his academic studies in Sweden and moved back to London, persuading the other members of 'Johnny Sox' to move with him although W√§rmling chose to remain in his home country. 'Johnny Sox' continued to play in London pubs and clubs until mid-1974Cornwell 2004, p. 63 with Jet Black joining the band to replace the original drummer 'Chicago Mike'.

Sime Silverman first hired Green as a reporter in 1918, and Green's byline first appeared on May 30, 1919. Biography Born in New York, Green attended Stuyvesant High School, but was a college drop-out. The first time his signature appeared in \\"Variety\\" was in the May 30, 1919 issue, when he reviewed a film called \\"Playthings of Passion\\", signing it \\"Abel\\". By 1925 he penned a column in the music section headed \\"Abel's Comment\\". Later, in 1928 he wrote a weekly column in \\"Variety\\" called \\"Around New York\\" and one called \\"Radio Rambles\\". Green was responsible for the creation of much of Variety's characteristic jargon, including the 1935 headline \\"Sticks Nix Hick Pix\\"; in his obituary, TIME said that if Variety was the Bible of show business, then Green \\"was its King James\\". In 1951, Green collaborated with Joe Laurie, Jr. on Show Biz: From Vaude to Video, a history of show business. Green appeared in the 1947 film Copacabana.

Due to insufficient recruits, an appeal was made for volunteers from the Cavalry of the Line, and 1,005 troopers eventually were added to the regimental rolls. Although half of the √âclaireurs were armed with 2.75m long lances issued in 1812 to the line regiments, and the rest with carbines, the regiments were rarely employed as lancers in battle,Where in theory the first rank would be lance-armed, p.12, Pawly more usually acting as scouts for the Army as a whole. The lances had crimson over white pennons although none were initially intended for issue, and many troopers were lacking these also. The rest of the weapons equipping the √âclaireurs were the standard Chasseur a Cheval model Year XIII cavalry pistols and model Year IX light cavalry sabre. Due to general lack of equipment only the 3rd regiment was able to obtain shabraques, with only officers being so equipped in the 1st and 2nd regiments.p.9, Pawly The regiments, owing to their scouting role, were not issued Eagles. 1st Regiment of √âclaireurs The 1st Regiment of which was attached to the Horse Grenadiers,p.46, Funcken & Funcken and was thus sometimes called the regiment of √âclaireurs-grenadiers, as counterparts to the Cossacks. They arrived in the theatre of operations late in the Napoleonic Wars, joining the army on 1 January 1814 just in time to participate in the Six Days Campaign (fighting at Brienne, La Rothi√®re, Champaubert, Montmirail, Montereau, Craonne and Arcis-sur-Aube) then to be dissolved on the Bourbon Restoration. The 1st Regiment's first commander was Claude Testot-Ferry, transferred from his command of the Empress' Dragoons, and most of the Regiment's officers were directly recruited from within the Guard including a large number from the Gardes d'Honneur, including Pierre (an old soldier from Testot-Ferry's old regiment of the 10e r√©giment de chasseurs √† cheval), Delavillane, Lepot (from the Horse Grenadiers of the Guard) and Kister. The first of these squadrons had uniforms largely in the Hussar style, based on those of the Gardes d'Honneur (a green dolman and a pelisse with white lace and black fur for officers), and were attached to the Old Guard. The other 3 squadrons were uniformed in the style of Chasseurs de la Ligne (a short dark green habit-veste, also known as a \\"Kinski\\") and attached to the Young Guard. The jackets of trumpeters were sky-blue. The first detachment of the regiment left for the field army in late January 1814, but by mid March the entire regiment was reduced to 200 sabres.p.13, Pawly The regiment was eventually renamed as the 2nd Regiment of Chasseurs a Cheval of the Guard in 1815. The 1st √âclaireurs fought on many engagements during the 1814 campaign in France : Six Days Campaign, Battle of Brienne, Battle of Champaubert, Battle of Montmirail, Battle of Ch√¢teau-Thierry, Battle of Vauchamps, Battle of Montereau, Battle of Craonne, Battle of Arcis-sur-Aube, Battle of Saint- Dizier and Battle of Paris. NOTE: This regt was not formed until 1814, and therefore cannot claim the battle honours before this date 2nd Regiment of √âclaireurs Sketch of an √âclaireur-Dragon The second regiment was attached to the Dragoons of the Guard, and because of this also referred to as √âclaireurs- Dragons, had scarlet regimental distinctions. For its formation the regiment was allocated officers and NCOs from the 20th Dragons of Line, 3rd and 7th Lancers of the Line while the troopers came from postilions of the Empire, the horse team drivers employed by the Government.p.8, Pawly The horses were primarily purchased from the Camarguais regional breed, and the remount depot was established there.small horses not exceeding 14 hands (1.40m) at the shoulder, Verwicht The regiment participated in the French Campaign of 1814, including Battle of Brienne, Battle of Champaubert, Battle of Montmirail, Battle of Ch√¢teau-Thierry, Battle of Vauchamps, Battle of Montereau, Battle of Rheims, Battle of Craonne, Battle of Arcis-sur-Aube and Battle of Saint- Dizier. Unlike the first regiment, the second was distinguished by the shako which all the modern works indicate to have been cylindrical, and was decorated by a surmounted rosette of a ganse cord and of a half-spherical pompom. The cord was tied in front of and behind the neck for the officers, the troopers carrying it in the usual way. The shako issued to the regiment is therefore same as that worn by the hussars at the time. The spherical pompom was the colour of the squadron. 3rd Regiment of √âclaireurs The third regiment was recruited from Polish cavalry line regiments serving with the French Army, and was attached to the 1st Lancers of the Guard, also a Polish regiment. In 1814 all three regiments were transferred to the line cavalry, and disbanded following Napoleon's abdication.

It was created in 1932New Barnes Building Opens, Why People are Upset at the request of Albert C. Barnes after he met Matisse in the United States. Barnes was an art enthusiast and long-time collector of Matisse's works, and agreed to pay Matisse a total of $30,000 for the mural, which was expected to take a year.Flam, Jack, Matisse: The Dance, National Gallery of Art, Washington, 1993. The mural was to be placed above three arches spanning the windows of the main hall of Barnes' gallery. In Nice, France, Matisse executed the mural on canvas provided by Barnes, as opposed to working on site. This was an unusual approach for such a work, but the patron had offered him complete artistic freedom, and working onsite would in any event have been impractical. For Matisse, the project proved to be beset with difficulties, and would end up taking him two years, leaving him physically and emotionally drained. He was also profoundly disappointed to be told on installation that Barnes had no intention of exhibiting the work to the public.Spurling, Hilary, Matisse the Master, Penguin Books, London, 2006 at 337 Nevertheless, Matisse was delighted with the work itself. In a 1933 letter to his son, Matisse wrote about the installation at the Barnes Foundation: \\"It has a splendour that one can't imagine unless one sees it -- because both the whole ceiling and its arched vaults come alive through radiation and the main effect continues right down to the floor...I am profoundly tired but very pleased. When I saw the canvas put in place, it was detached from me and became part of the building.\\" Some commentators consider that The Dance II mural was pivotal in enabling Matisse to return to the most essential sources of his art.Bois, Y-A, ‚ÄúThe Shift‚Äù, in Turner and Benjamin, eds, Matisse, Brisbane: QAG 1995 at 98 For Matisse, the work highlighted aspects such as simplicity, flattening, the emphasis on colour and the use of paper cut-outs which would all go on to play an important role in his later artistic development.\\"Strange encounters\\", in www.artinsociety.com Damage during world tour During a 1993 hearing in the Montgomery County, Pennsylvania Orphan's Court art conservator Paul R.

Along with his wife Cleophea Lutz he had a single child, his daughter Angelika Kauffmann (*1741), is also remembered as a painter.  Life  He was born in Schwarzenberg, Austria, and is described as a relatively poor man with painting skills. The original family home was a small village in the Austrian alps called Schwarzenberg in the Vorarlberg area. In the years 1740 to 1742 he was in duty of the prince-bishop from Chur/Switzerland. In 1755 the family moved to Milan until in 1757 the mother died and father with daughter returned to Schwarzenberg. There they helped in painting the interiors of the recently heavily fire damaged local church house. The father concentrated on the general interior whilst his daughter worked on the apostle images. At a later time she donated the high altar piece in form of paintings from her own hand. View of Tettnang, J.J.Kauffmann, about 1757 In the same period the church painting took place the family was traveling the nearby northern lakeside of Lake Constance doing works for the Tettnang seated Montfort counts in form of castle depictions and similar, and going further to Meersburg and even Konstanz. In 1760 they left for Italy again in order to do studies on classical and Renaissance art there. Whilst the travels they earned money by portraying locals along their path. Up to 1766 they went to Rome with intermediate halts in Milan, Modena, Parma and Florence. On 5 October 1762 the daughter received honorable membership of the Accademia di Bologna. In 1764 this got topped by joining the Accademia di San Luca in Rome on a similar base. The traveling Englishman and actor David Garrick gave the daughter the chance to portrait her which in turn went into her master piece making her finally famous. On recommendation of Lady Wentworth both moved to London and stayed there starting 1766. He was the person who taught his daughter painting at the age of 11 that helped her much in her later career all across Europe including England and Italy up to being a foundation member of the Royal Society of Arts. Even in later years some travels along with or for meeting with his daughter have obviously taken place. A strong relation to Italy was further there as he successfully recommended his daughter to marry the venetian painter Antonio Zucchi for her second partner. The marriage took place in Juli 1781. As a result, father and the couple travelled south visiting Flandern, Schwarzenberg, Verona and Padua. In October of the same year they arrived in Venice, where Kauffmann died in the following January.

Some electronic devices, such as cell phones, will automatically shut down when the cut-off voltage has been reached. Batteries In batteries, the cut-off (final) voltage is the prescribed lower-limit voltage at which battery discharge is considered complete. The cut-off voltage is usually chosen so that the maximum useful capacity of the battery is achieved. The cut-off voltage is different from one battery to the other and it is highly dependent on the type of battery and the kind of service in which the battery is used. When testing the capacity of a NiMH or NiCd battery a cut-off voltage of 1.0 V per cell is normally used, whereas 0.9 V is normally used as the cut-off voltage of an alkaline cell. Devices that have too high cut-off voltages may stop operating while the battery still has significant capacity remaining. Voltage cut-off in portable electronics Some portable equipment does not fully use the low-end voltage spectrum of a battery. The power to the equipment cuts off before a relatively large portion of the battery life has been used. A high cut-off voltage is more widespread than perhaps assumed. For example, a certain brand of mobile phone that is powered with a single-cell Lithium-ion battery cuts off at 3.3V. The Li‚Äëion can be discharged to 3V and lower; however, with a discharge to 3.3V (at room temperature), about 92‚Äì98% of the capacity is used.http://www.ibt- power.com/Battery_packs/Li_Ion/Lithium_ion_tech.html Importantly, particularly in the case of lithium ion batteries which are used in the vast majority of portable electronics today, a voltage cut-off below 3.2V can lead to chemical instability in the cell, with the result being a reduced battery lifetime. For this reason, electronics manufacturers tend to use higher cut-off voltages, removing the need for consumers to buy battery replacements before other failure mechanisms in a device take effect .

After its second nationalisation in 1890 up to the merger of the L√§nderbahnen into the Deutsche Reichsbahn in 1920 it was under the direction of the Grand Duchy's Executive Railway Board (Gro√üherzoglichen General-Eisenbahndirection or GGED) in Schwerin. Context The former duchies of Meckenburg 1866-1934 Mecklenburg is a region in northern Germany comprising the western and larger part of the present day state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Its largest cities are Rostock, Schwerin, and Neubrandenburg. In 1815, the two Mecklenburg duchies - Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz - were raised to Grand Duchies, and subsequently existed separately in Germany until the end of World War I. The earlier private railways were nationalised by 1890 into the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway.  En Route to a state railway = First railways in Mecklenburg  The first railway route in Mecklenburg was the Prussian Berlin‚ÄìHamburg line, which opened in 1846. As a result, stations appeared in Ludwigslust and Hagenow and other places. On 10 March 1846 the Mecklenburg Railway Company was given the concession to build a route from Hagenow to Schwerin and on to Wismar, and via B√ºtzow to Rostock with a branch to G√ºstrow. On 13 May 1850 the line was finished.  The Friedrich-Franz railway  Although the Mecklenburg Railway Company had completed the line, it lacked an east‚Äìwest link that would also connect to the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Because there were no financially influential backers, the route G√ºstrow - Teterow ‚Äì Malchin ‚Äì Neubrandenburg was built on the initiative of the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin under sovereign ownership. The route was opened on 11 November 1864 at Teterow station in the presence of both the Mecklenburg grand dukes. This was followed in 1867 by a railway connexion over the Prussian border to Strasburg (Uckermark). The railway division established its headquarters in Malchin. To continue the route as far as L√ºbeck the L√ºbeck-Kleinen Railway Company was founded and it was given the concession on 20 December 1865 to build the line. After 1868 its construction had to be discontinued due to a lack of funding; the state took over the line on 24 April 1870 and began operations on 1 July 1870 between Kleinen and L√ºbeck. In L√ºbeck the Friedrich-Franz line built its own goods station, called the L√ºbeck Mecklenburg marshalling station. For passenger services it shared the L√ºbeck-B√ºchen railway's station.  First nationalisation  The desire for state control over the construction and operation of railways led in 1873 to the nationalisation of the railways in Mecklenburg. The Mecklenburg government also wanted to preempt the purchase of the railways by the Reich railways planned by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. The operating profits of the Mecklenburg Railway Company were another reason for the takeover. On 20 April 1873 the state government bought the Mecklenburg Railway Company and merged it with the Friedrich-Franz Railway into the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway. The headquarters of the company was moved from Malchin to the state capital, Schwerin.  Reprivatisation  In 1875, the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway was reprivatised. The reason was a dispute between the former railway shareholders and the government, because the latter could not pay back the circa 10 million thalers (30 million marks) from the railway purchase. The outcome of the dispute was the formation of the Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway Company (Mecklenburgischen Friedrich-Franz-Eisenbahngesellschaft or M.F.F.E.) as a limited company on 2 April 1875. This private railway company existed until the second nationalisation on 1 February 1890. Under the M.F.F.E. a railway line was built between Waren und Malchin. Between 1875 and 1890 a multitude of new railway routes emerged, built by private railway concerns. * The Parchim- Ludwigslust Railway constructed a line between the towns of the same name. * The G√ºstrow-Plau Railway built a route from Plaaz via G√ºstrow as far as Meyenburg on the Prussian border. * The Wismar-Rostock Railway put in the direct connexion between the two harbour towns. * The Gnoien-Teterow Railway linked the town of Gnoien to the network. * The Mecklenburg Southern Railway succeeded in building the connexion between Parchim, L√ºbz, Waren (M√ºritz), Penzlin and Neubrandenburg. * The Lloyd Railway built a connexion from Neustrelitz via Waren to Rostock and Warnem√ºnde. * The Wismar-Karow Railway made a link to the railway junction at Karow, where the Southern Railway and G√ºstrow-Plau Railway crossed. * Finally the construction of the narrow gauge Doberan-Heiligendamm Railway was completed.  Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway  Railway network in Mecklenburg, based on a 1905 map On the second nationalisation in 1889/1890 the management of the state railway was transferred to the GGED (see above). The railway was known from then on as the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway (Gro√üherzoglich Mecklenburgische Friedrich-Franz-Eisenbahn, M.F.F.E.) In 1889/1890 all existing nine private railways were purchased by the state, the acquisition of the larger, more profitable companies taking a little longer. The 'Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway built a number of new routes in order to provide better rail transport services for the country: * TessinRostock‚Äì(Bad)S√ºlze‚ÄìTribsees (with a connexion to the Franzburg Southern Railway and the Tribsees‚ÄìGrimmen‚ÄìGreifswald route (1895) * Schwerin‚ÄìRehna (1897) * Grevesm√ºhlen‚ÄìKl√ºtz (1905) * Sch√∂nberg‚ÄìDassow (1905) * Malchin‚ÄìDargun (1907) * Heiligendamm‚ÄìArendsee (today the Baltic Sea spa K√ºhlungsborn- West)(1910).  Mecklenburg railway ferries on the Baltic Sea  In 1903 the post steamer link from Warnem√ºnde to Nyk√∏bing/Falster, which had existed since 1886, was replaced by a railway ferry from Warnem√ºnde to Gedser. The M.F.F.E. built a new station for it in Warnem√ºnde and a harbour with two ferry berths. For the ferry traffic, two ferries were purchased: the \\"Friedrich-Franz IV\\" and the \\"Mecklenburg\\". The ferry line was operated jointly with the Danish State Railways. The ferry line enabled direct, through trains possible from Berlin to Copenhagen.  War, November Revolution, Deutsche Reichsbahn  The onset of the First World War started the last chapter for the M.F.F.E. Railway traffic was reprioritised to support the war. Railway officials were called to war to an unprecedented extent. Railway materiel had to be given to other railways and railway operations were coordinated under the direction of the military across state and railway administration boundaries. After the November Revolution and the abdication of the Grand Duke on 13 November 1918 the railways were renamed the Mecklenburg State Railway (Mecklenburgische Landeseisenbahn) and transferred to the Reich Railways (Deutsche Reichsbahn) in accordance with the requirements of the Weimar Reich Constitution. The management authority for the Reichseisenbahnen in Mecklenburg was the Reichsbahn division of Schwerin.  Locomotives in Mecklenburg  Mecklenburg centred its procurement of locomotives on its largest neighbour, Prussia. As far as possible, Prussian designs were used. One genuine Mecklenburg engine was the T 4, a tank locomotive for branch line operations. In contrast to other German railway administrations the M.F.F.E. ordered no express train locomotives. The transportation of international express trains from Berlin via Warnem√ºnde and Gedser to Copenhagen and the fast trains from Rostock to Hamburg were handled by Prussian P 8s, that with a top speed of 100 km/h had sufficiently high speeds for those services. An overview of the engines used by the M.F.F.E. is given in the List of Mecklenburg locomotives.  Memories of the M.F.F.E. today  Only a few signs of Mecklenburg' former railway are left today. In Schwerin the building of the Grand Duchy's Executive Railway Board (Gro√üherzoglichen General-Eisenbahndirection), which housed the Reichsbahn division of Schwerin until its disbandment, still stands. On the routes there are a few incline markers with the characteristic M.F.F.E. in the centre and the functional, yet attractive, old station buildings from the early days of the railway, for example in Teterow, Malchin and Stavenhagen. Other memorabilia from the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway are housed by the Molli Museum at K√ºhlungsborn-West station on the so-called Molli's Spa Railway (B√§derbahn Molli).

Guzman, El Salvador Hist√≥rico, retrieved 01/16/16 In 1844 his father, then vice president, deposed Francisco Malespin, who had led the country to war against Guatemala. Much of the populace in the capital supported Guzman, who served out the remainder of the presidential term into 1845. The younger Guzman earned a Bachelor of Philosophy from the University of San Carlos of Guatemala. During his university studies, he adopted the principles of European liberalism. In 1862, he travelled to Europe, and in 1869 he received the rank of Doctor of Medicine in Paris. Career In 1870 Guzman returned to El Salvador. The following year he was chosen to represent the Constituent National Assembly, summoned by the then president Santiago Gonz√°lez. His service in the Constituent Assembly in the capital was a short one. He soon returned to San Miguel, where he dedicated himself to scientific research. He initiated a series of geological investigations. In addition, he undertook the botanical studies of classifying the flora and the fauna of the north of San Miguel and Chalatenango. In 1872, Guzm√°n served under the cabinet of President Gonz√°lez, as an Undersecretary of Public Instruction and Outer Relations. In 1874 he helped establish the Escuela de Artes y Oficios de San Salvador (School of Arts and Careers) in San Salvador. That same year, when treating the epidemic of smallpox in some areas of the country, Guzm√°n headed the state campaign of vaccination. In 1875, Guzm√°n and Dar√≠o Gonz√°lez organized an expedition of geological investigation into residues of the Los Frailes River, southwest of Ilobasco. During this exploration, they discovered fossils of mastodon. Between 1881 and 1887, Guzm√°n worked as a university professor of medicine and botany at the University of El Salvador. On October 9, 1883, on the initiative of Guzm√°n, president Rafael Zald√≠var opened the National Museum of El Salvador, to display the national collections related to archaeology, history and fine arts. Being responsible for its establishment and much of its content, Guzm√°n became the first director of the museum. He donated collections of Olmec and Maya art and artifacts. In 1886 Guzm√°n returned to politics, elected deputy to the Constituent National Assembly summoned by Francisco Men√©ndez. In the Constituent Assembly, Guzm√°n promoted passage of legislation supporting the liberal principles adopted during his early European travels and studies. In 1891, Guzm√°n travelled to Costa Rica to head a scientific expedition. Between 1896 and 1898, he resided in Nicaragua. In 1916, Guzm√°n won a literary contest, summoned by the state under president Carlos Melendez, to create an Oration to the Salvadoran Flag. During his life, Guzm√°n wrote journalistic poetry and articles that were compiled in various volumes. Most notably, his Chosen Works (Obras Escogidas) were published after his death.

Megohmmeter or insulation resistance tester is a special type of ohmmeter used to measure the electrical resistance of insulators. Insulating components, for example cable jackets, must be tested for their insulation strength at the time of commissioning and as part of maintenance of high voltage electrical equipment and installations. For this purpose, megohmmeters, which can provide high DC voltages (typically in ranges from 500 V to 5 kV, some are up to 15 kV) at specified current capacity, are used. Acceptable insulator resistance values are typically 1 to 10 megohms, depending on the standards referenced. Operation Resistance to be measured is connected across the terminals i.e. connected in series with the deflecting coil and across the generator. When the current is supplied to the coils then they have torque in opposite directions. If resistance to be measured is high, no current will flow through the deflecting coil, the controlling coil, will, therefore, set itself perpendicular to the magnetic axis and hence set the pointer to the infinity. If the resistance to be measured is small, high current flow through the deflecting coil and the resulting torque sets the pointer to zero. For the intermediate value of resistance, depending upon the torque production, the pointer is set at a point between zero and infinity. The hand-driven generator is of the permanent magnet type and it is designed to generate from 500 to 2500 volts. Testing voltage is produced by the rotation of the crank in a hand-operated megger, or by the battery in the case of an electronic-type megger. For testing a range up to 440V, equipment requires 550V DC is sufficient. The current coil or deflecting coil is series- connected and allows the electric current to flow through the circuit being tested. Control and deflecting coil has a current limiting resistor connected in series so as to protect the external circuit in case of damages caused due to very low resistance. Testing voltage is produced by electromagnetic induction in case of hand-operated megger and by a battery in case of electronic type megger. The deflection of pointer increases with the increases in voltage in the external circuit and also decreases with the increase in current. That is, resultant torque is inversely related to current and directly related to voltage. While the electrical circuit that is being tested is open, the resultant torque caused due to voltage coil is maximum and the deflection pointer shows the value of ‚Äòinfinity‚Äô which means the circuit does not have any shorting present and resistance is the maximum within the circuit being tested. In the case of a short circuit, the deflection pointer shows ‚Äòzero‚Äô which indicates ‚Äòno‚Äô resistance in the circuit being tested. A Megger consists of an e.m.f. source and voltmeter. The scale of the voltmeter is calibrated in ohms (kilo-ohms or megohms, as the case may be). In measurements, the e.m.f. of the self-contained source must be equal to that of the source used in calibration.

The station survived a further 23 years before itself closing in 1933.  History  The route of the Gravesend West branch through Gravesend adjoined the famous Rosherville Pleasure Gardens which had opened in 1839 on land leased by the Rosher family who gave their name to the popular attraction. Although the Gardens were already served by steamer, the London, Chatham and Dover Railway decided to open a station in the hope of attracting some of their custom. It was an initially successful venture with 14,000 people visiting Rosherville Gardens on Whit Sunday in 1886, many of whom arrived by rail. However, the steamers were not going to give up their passengers without a fight and began to undercut the fares charged by the railway company. In the event, the popularity of Rosherville Gardens was on the wane and it eventually closed in 1910. Dwindling traffic led to the station being downgraded to an unstaffed halt in 1928, before eventually closing in 1933. As with Southfleet and Longfield stations, Rosherville Halt was situated in a cutting near a road overbridge from which a footbridge led down to a single island platform. Rosherville lay just to the west of a bridge carrying the A226 Dartford - Gravesend road over the line. The covered footbridge complete with two generously wide staircases to accommodate the expected traffic to Rosherville Gardens led from the station buildings at ground level to the platform. Two wooden canopy sections were installed on the platform, and a signal box was installed in a recess in the brick retaining wall on the down side of the station. A stationmaster's house was sited some distance from the main station buildings, overlooking the cutting.  Post-closure  The signal box was removed following closure and the ground level buildings were subsequently converted into domestic use.Pallant, N., op. cit. p. 23-24. The platform buildings remained intact until the mid-1960s.Kent Rail, \\"Rosherville\\". The line through the station was closed in 1968 when freight traffic ceased at Gravesend West. What remained was swept away when the trackbed of the Gravesend Branch from Vale Road as far as Gravesend West was converted into the A2260 Thames Way. The cutting was deepened and widened requiring the demolition of the dilapidated stationmaster's house. Only the former railway tunnel to the north-east of the station, now part of the A2260, remains as the surviving remnant of the railway which once served Rosherville.Subterranea Britannica, \\"Rosherville Halt\\".

It began publishing as a four-page tabloid on 4 August 1852. Until it ceased publication in 1989, it was the oldest daily newspaper in the country. History= Early  The newspaper was founded by William Collins and Garland William Woon, who hired William Morgan Crompton as its first editor. It began as a weekly paper, moved to twice-weekly publication in 1867 and began appearing daily in 1877. Crompton was replaced as editor in 1854 by Richard Pheney, who quit in November 1856 when he opposed the newspaper owner's support for George Cutfield over Charles Brown as Taranaki Superintendent. In May 1857 Pheney was appointed as the first editor of a rival newspaper, the Taranaki News, which changed its name to the Taranaki Daily News when it began daily publication three years later. Woon, who took over as editor following Pheney's departure, became renowned for his reporting of conflicts between imperial forces and local MƒÅori in the First Taranaki War, with his paper being sold by subscription throughout Europe. In May 1860 he was accused by military authorities of writing material that could give \\"information to the enemy\\" after criticising the defence of the town and he ran an issue with one offending paragraph removed, the white space being filled with fullpoints. It remained the one and only time the Herald was censored. In late 1867 the paper was sold to Henry Weston and his family retained strong links with the paper for the next 111 years. Weston was sole proprietor until 1920; his nephew Walter C. Weston took over until 1930 when it was registered as a private company. Weston remained as chairman and managing director and his wife, Lillian Weston, was a director until her death in 1978. Merger and end of publication In 1962, the Taranaki Herald and Taranaki Daily News, both of which were struggling with rising costs and the need for updated equipment, were amalgamated as Taranaki Newspapers Ltd, a subsidiary of NZ News Ltd, which owned the Auckland Star and Christchurch Star. Publication was merged at the Herald building in Currie St, New Plymouth, which it had occupied since 1900, and while the administration and publishing activity was combined, the editorial departments were kept separate and stayed fiercely competitive. Taranaki Newspapers was bought by Independent Newspapers Ltd (INL) in 1989, which closed the Herald because of falling circulation and advertising volumes. Other newspapers by same publisher Other newspapers published by the Herald included the Budget and the Taranaki Weekly Herald (1877-1932), the Sports Herald (1926‚Äì30, 1946-1972) and during World War II a special weekly Overseas News Sheet for servicemen. Editors and journalists Editors included: William Seffern (1868-1895), Walter J. Penn (1895-1932), G. H. Dolby (1932-1937), A. B.

It belongs to the genus Cortinarius, a group collectively known as webcaps. It is found growing in conifer plantations, and has recently been given the fanciful common name of surprise webcap. In the past it has been called the red-gilled webcap. Taxonomy This mushroom is placed by some authorities in the genus Dermocybe. Most mycologists retain Dermocybe as merely a subgenus of Cortinarius. The group contains almost 30 species. The species name semisanguineus means 'half blood- red', a reference to the gill colour, as compared with Cortinarius sanguineus which is wholly blood-red. Description The cap is campanulate (bell- shaped), and later flattens, but retains a broad umbo (shield-like central boss). It is usually between across, brownish ochre, or umber and with a darker centre. It is covered in fine fibrils, and is dry. The stipe is usually the same colour as the cap or paler, and is smooth, or finely fibrillose like the cap. It is long, slim, and cylindrical. Cortinal remnants often left on the stem in this species can be quite fleeting. The gills are adnate, markedly sinuate, and fairly crowded. They are initially blood-red, but turn cinnamon- brown on aging, giving a spore print of the same colour. The flesh is said to smell of radishes, and it is ochre in the stem, but more olive in the cap. A similar species, Cortinarius phoeniceus has a redder cap, and more distinct red cortinal remnants around the stem. Distribution and habitat Cortinarius semisanguineus appears in conifer, or mixed conifer, and birch woods in autumn (fall). It is occasional in Britain, Europe, Scandinavia, and parts of North America. It has a mycorrhizal relationship with birch trees (Betula), and other coniferous softwood trees. It is often abundant under young spruce in plantations on acid soil, appearing from August to November. Edibility Cortinarius semisanguineus cannot be recommended for the table as it is suspected of being toxic; it may contain similar poisonous compounds to those found in deadly Cortinarius, such as C. orellanus and its close relatives. Other uses Cortinarius semisanguineus can be used as a dye for textile yarns.

Thomson is credited with helping to expand the farming of exotic fruits in California ‚Äì everything from cherimoyas to longans to pitahayas. Early life Paul Thomson was born on June 29, 1916, in India to parents, Clinton and Bertha Mangon Thomson. His mother was a doctor who ran a local Indian hospital while his father was a minister. Tragedy struck the family when Thomson was hunting with his father when he was 11 years old. His father had shot two ducks for the family's Christmas dinner, but drowned while trying to retrieve them from a lake. Thomson, his mother and his four younger sisters returned to the United States following his father's death. The family settled in his parents' native Nebraska, where his mother set up a medical practice. Thomson raised chickens, churned butter and grew potatoes during the Great Depression to earn money for his family. Thomson graduated from high school in 1934 and enrolled in Nebraska Wesleyan University for two years, but dropped out in 1937 due to unaffordable tuition costs. Following his departure from NWU, he briefly worked as an installer of telegraph lines for Western Union and early railroad-signal control systems in Colorado. He also worked as a wheat and turkey farmer for a short period of time. Thomson enlisted in the United States Marines in 1938, a year after dropping out of college. He served as a chemical warfare instructor during World War II. He later ran a U.S. military sawmill to produce lumber for military operations in Korea during the Korean War. Another of his assignments in Korea was to monitor horticultural operations, which would lead to a lifelong interest in plants. The Marines stationed him at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego during the 1950s, which brought Thomson to Southern California. One of his duties in San Diego was working in the base's nursery. California Rare Fruit Growers Thomson operated the only longan orchard in the United States at the time. Thomson began experimenting with rare fruits during the early 1950s after being stationed in San Diego. He and his wife, Helen, purchased five acres (2 ha) of land in Bonsall, California, in 1952. The couple initially lived in a trailer on the land while they were building their home. He began experimenting with tropical fruits and fruit trees that were usually found in climates warmer than that part of Southern California. Thomson initially planted papayas, lychees, mangoes, longans and other tropical species on his new farm. However, most of his attempts to grow these fruits were a failure due to freezing temperatures during the winters. For example, mangoes could not survive the winter climate in Bonsall. Thomson decided to make another attempt at growing tropical fruits with a second farm in a different location. In 1962, Thomson purchased another small farm in Vista, California, and called it Edgehill. His newest farm and orchard was only five miles (8 km) from his other property in Bonsall, but it had a much milder climate, especially during the winter. This made Edgehill more conducive to growing tropical, exotic fuits that had not been previously grown in California. He was able to finally grow successful harvests of mangoes, cherimoyas, lychees and other fruits. The Los Angeles Times reported in 1971 that Thomson was able to grow 96 separate types of fruit between his two orchards in Bonsall and Edgehill. Most of these fruits had not been widely grown in the United States before Thomson planted them on his properties. Thomson grew the first successful Mammee apple crop, also known as the South American apricot or the mamey, of note in California. He also ran the only longan orchard in the United States at the time. A friend of Thomson, Jim Neitzel, said that his Edgehill farm soon attracted the attention of other botanists and tropical fruit enthusiasts. \\"His Edgehill property was the biggest feather in his cap. People would come from all over the state to check it out.\\" However, lack of demand for Thomson's fruits in the marketplace at the time forced him to close the Edgehill property in 1972. In a 1989 interview with the San Diego Union-Tribune Thomson told the newspaper that, \\"I was 20 years ahead of my time...I never made enough to pay the water bill, let alone make any money.\\" Thomson, an organic farmer, continued to earn his living by budding and grafting fruit trees for grove owners and nurseries throughout California. He also continued to grow cherimoyas and mangoes to be sold throughout Southern California. In particular, Thomson devoted much of his time to propagating tropical and subtropical fruits that would grow in San Diego's North County. California Rare Fruit Growers Association Thomson and John Riley, a Lockheed engineer from Santa Clara, California, and fellow fruit enthusiast, began working together to publish a newsletter beginning in 1960. Riley and Thomson published the early newsletters for years using a mimeograph machine. The newsletter lead to the foundation of the California Rare Fruit Growers Association (CRFG) in 1968, as an organization and clearinghouse for rare exotic fruit enthusiasts, hobbyists and amateur horticulturists. Today the California Rare Fruit Growers publishes a glossy, bimonthly magazine, The Fruit Gardener, an outgrowth of the early, mimeographed newsletters. The California Rare Fruit Growers Association currently has over 3,000 members in approximately 35 countries worldwide. The CRFG claims to be the largest amateur fruit-growing organization in the world. The association rapidly grew in California during the late 1960s, in part because many newcomers were moving to the state \\"without prejudice to what could not be grown\\" in California. Thomson's organization became a driving force behind the growing availability of exotic fruits throughout California's supermarkets and farmers markets. Dudleya Researcher, Grower and Publisher Paul appears to have become interested in the Crassulaceaen succulents of the genus Dudleya. The Dudleya closely resemble the more commonly cultivated Echeverias. Early publications actually listed the Dudleya under either the Echeveria or Cotyledon genera. This genus is primarily native to chaparral habitats in California and Baja California state (Mexico), and consists of approximately 60 named species. Limited literature and a passion to learn more on the plants that had piqued his interest, Paul set forth on gathering specimens, assembling descriptions, drawing habitat location maps and taking photographs which all culminated in his privately publishing the Dudleya and Hassenthaus Handbook in 1993. Of note are his SEM photographs of the flowers. It is still the only book dedicated to the genus and contains numerous photographs of specimens in the wild and his own collection. Paul shared his plants freely and supporters provided specimens from their respective collecting trips. Paul shared his insights into their hybridization with avid enthusiasts and his findings were later confirmed as naturally occurring, as he had suspected. Most of his collection was lost during a severe freeze but his legacy lives on. His contributions to the knowledge of the genus Dudleya is overshadowed by his work on the rare fruits. Death Paul Thomson died on May 31, 2008, at the age of 91, of complications related to old age, at a retirement home in Fallbrook, California. He was survived by his four younger sisters, Margaret Greiber, Catharine Kingsolver, Alice Hasenyager, and Ellen Hanly. His wife, Helen, died in 2007. They had been married for 65 years.

The new bridge also links to a new road that bypasses Temerloh and Mentakab townships, causing the former Temerloh-Mentakab section to be re-gazetted as the Federal Route 87.

Huis ter Nieuwburg or Huis ter Nieuburch (\\"House at New Borough\\") was a palace in Rijswijk, Holland, Dutch Republic. The symmetrical French Classicist building was probably designed by the Dutch architect Jacob van Campen together with Constantin Huygens and the prince himself. According to Slothouwer the designs were carried out by Arent van's Gravesande who was replaced by the French architect Simon de la Vall√©e in 1634.T.O. Nordberg Les De la Vall√©e: Vie d'une famille d'architectes en France, Hollande et Su√®de Stockholm 1970, p. 85-87 The palace was built between 1630 and 1636 for stadtholder Prince Frederick Henry. The palace with gardens was the country house of the Princes of Orange for years, and it was used for the peace negotiations resulting in the Treaty of Ryswick in 1697. After the death of Prince William III in 1702, the palace was inherited by the Kings of Prussia, until it was given back to the Princes of Orange by King Frederick II. The gardens of the palace were formal French Renaissance gardens constructed in 1636. In front of the palace were trees and parterres enclosed by walls. Behind the palace was a larger garden with four rectangular ponds. The building was demolished in 1790 after years of neglect. At present, the area is woodland known as the Rijswijkse Bos. The only reminders of the palace are two of the ponds and an obelisk, the Needle of Rijswijk, commemorating the peace treaty. Building In 1630, stadtholder Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange bought the old Huis ter Nieuwburg from Philibert Vernatti for ∆í30,000 (‚Ç¨13,613). The house was located in the Plaspolder, a polder in the village Rijswijk, in between the cities The Hague and Delft. At that time, The Hague was the political center of the Dutch Republic where the States-General assembled, and Delft was the city where Prince Frederick Henry was born and where his father William the Silent had his residence and was assassinated and buried in 1584. Between 1630 and 1632, the Prince of Orange bought more land and two houses in the area surrounding the house in order to build a new country house on the location of Vernatti's old house. The project of the new Huis ter Nieuwburg was tendered in 1630. The first pavilions of the palace were finished in 1632 and its roof was completed in 1636. During his life, Prince Frederick Henry had built large houses in the latest styles in architecture and by the best available architects. It is probable that the French architect Simon de la Vall√©e had helped to carry out designs of this palace and its interiors. The symmetrical building was designed in the architectural style of French Classicism. The plan of the large building also reflects the new ideas from the villa buildings of Andrea Palladio who influenced architects like van Jacob van Campen, Pieter Post and Pilip Vingboons. The corps de logis with the main chambers of the palace was positioned on the axis of symmetry.Illustration by Jan van Vianen from 1697. At the back of the corps de logis was a lodge looking out on the Nieuwe Kerk in Delft through a corridor along the axis in the garden. In this church is the mausoleum of his father William the Silent and the crypt where Prince Frederick Henry's parents, brother, and two daughters were buried at the time the palace was built. Both on the east and the west side of the corps de logis is a wing, perpendicular to the axis, with a pavilion at the end. The symmetrical palace was finished in 1636; front view by Petrus Schenck Gardens The geometric Late Renaissance gardens and ponds were constructed by 1636. They were carried out by Andr√© Mollet, son of the famous French garden architect Claude Mollet who served the French kings Henry IV and Louis XIII. They were illustrated as they had become fully developed and matured in Jan van Vianen's engraving after Petrus Schenck, which records the grand diplomatic gathering that led to the Treaty of Ryswick, signed in the house. The entire garden was surrounded by a rectangle of canals that drained the ground and formed the equivalent of a moat;Outhouses overhanging the moat, into one of which a figure is hastening, appear in P. Schenck's detailed view. around its inner banks all√©es of trees isolated the pleasure grounds from the featureless agricultural landscape outside.This is unlike the French ideal of a formal garden cut out of surrounding forest. Entry was across one of three bridges and through a formal woodland or bocage, through which three drives were pierced: the central one led through a free-standing Doric portal‚Äîguarded by sentry-boxes on this occasion‚Äîthat was centred on a pedimented central gate in the mock-battlemented wall that enclosed the paved and cobbled forecourt.The cobbles have been misleadingly tinted green in the modern watercoloring applied to this engraving; the movements of coaches in the forecourt of both engravings show that it could not have been turfed. Right and left of this axial entrance, reserved during the treaty negotiations for the Mediator, were matching unemphasised entrances‚Äîperhaps opened in the walling for the occasionThey do not appear in the engraving of 1665 (illustration).‚Äîdestined, as the engraving's legend specifies, for the French representatives on the right and for those of the Allies on the left; clearly, this will have avoided tense protocol confrontations over which coach would enter the cour d'honneur first. The north front of the Huis with its paired corner pavilions was separated from the forecourt by a low balustraded terrace that created a privileged zone that protected the parade rooms from the immediate clatter of the courtyard and the inconvenient leavings of horses. For the duration of the negotiations, temporary brick walls had been erected to divide the entrance court from its flanking parterre gardens; in ordinary times, openings in the terrace balustrade and a few steps gave direct access to these gardens, where fruit trees were espaliered against the brick walls.The engraving shows how the temporary walls ran up to the central pier of the four-bay pavilions, dividing them abruptly in half, and leaving the opening in the terrace balustrade to one side, hard against the partition. The palace and gardens during the negotiations of the Treaty of Ryswick in 1697, engraved by Jan van Vianen after P. Schenck The central axis continued through the central rooms of the corps de logis and was extended as a wide gravelled walk down the axis of the pleasure grounds, which it divided symmetrically on either side; at the far end, the enclosing narrow band of trees drew back in a semi-circular exedra that parted at the center to afford a view of the church steeple of Delft on the horizon, centred on the garden axis.The 1697 engraving emphasises this distant end-point of the garden axis by centering both axis and steeple in the bird's-eye view. The grounds thus enclosed and divided featured a symmetrical suite of six parterres that were planted‚Äîrather than with the clipped patterns relieved with colored gravel of Le N√¥tre's Garden √† la fran√ßaise manner‚Äîas formal bosquets of trees laid out quincunx-fashion and separated by wide gravelled walks. In the four outer corners of the grounds that were articulated by these shady sections were four rectangular ponds, the vijvers of which two survive today. At the outside front corners were a pair of mock fortifications with corner bastions all in tightly-clipped evergreens, entered by arched doorways.Perhaps since there were two, absolutely equal, they had been run up as green-painted trelliswork covered with vines, specifically for the treaty negotiations, whose distinctly galante social character is indicated by the staffage of the van Vianen engraving, of groups of fashionable ladies, gentlemen saluting passing coaches with courtly bows, running footmen, pages, dogs and the occasional beggar rewarded with a coin. One of two ponds from the gardens of the palace in the Rijswijkse Bos Two separate gardens enclosed by brick walls extended east and west of the end pavilions. The eastward one was planted with evergreens surrounding a circular central rockwork fountain, from which is derived its name De Rots, \\"The Rockery\\". The westward one was the De Meloen Tuin, the melon garden. Owners and tenants The palace was built as a country house and used by the Princes of Orange, the stadtholders of six of the seven provinces of the Dutch Republic, and the de facto rulers of the country. In 1697, the palace was used for the negotiations that lead to the Treaty of Ryswick. The treaty settled the Nine Years' War between France and the Grand Alliance of England, Spain, the Holy Roman Empire and the Dutch Republic. The Needle of Rijswijk, commemorating the Treaty of Ryswick of 1697 After the death of King William III of England, who was also the Prince of Orange, the house was under the supervision of the Nassause Domeinraad (English: \\"Domain Council of Nassau\\") from 1702 to 1732. After the inheritance of King William III was settled, the palace became the property of King Frederick William I of Prussia in 1732. His successor, King Frederick II of Prussia, gave the palace back to the Princes of Orange, to Prince William IV, as an act of friendship. In 1753, the palace was rented to Count Golofkin, ambassador for Tsarina Anna of Russia. Demolition In 1789, the architect P.W. Schonk advised Prince William V to demolish the palace, because it had been neglected for years. Also he advised that the money raised by selling properties and real estate be used for a monument for the Treaty of Ryswick. Following this advice, the palace was demolished in 1790 and the stables and the coach-house were sold in 1793. The Needle of Rijswijk was built in 1792 to 1794 to commemorate the peace treaty. At present, the area around the obelisk is woodland known as the Rijswijkse Bos, which is open to the public. The only other reminders of Huis ter Nieuwburg are two rectangular ponds from the French gardens, now enclosed in woodland. Rijswijk Museum has engravings, medals, and books relating to the Treaty of Ryswick and paintings of the palace in its collection.

It was originally published as a novella in 1999 in Al Sarrantonio's 999: New Stories of Horror and Suspense anthology. Elsewhere is studied in the 2008 publication American Exorcist: Critical Essays on William Peter Blatty. The story follows a group of people who visit a supposedly haunted house. When other secrets appear, the group tries to find out what else the house has that is secret. Plot Joan Freeboard, a realtor, has been assigned to sell Elsewhere, a house notorious for being haunted. She brings along her friend Terrence Dare, a writer, and psychic Anna Trawley to help investigate. When they arrive at the house, they met up with paranormal investigator Gabriel Case. It is suggested that something is wrong with Gabriel Case; he acts as if he has met the group before, saying, \\"here you all are again\\", even though this is supposedly his first time meeting the group. Gabriel Case then tells them that a doctor who once lived at Elsewhere killed his young wife and himself, both becoming the ghosts of the house. Gabriel also introduces his servant. It is evident that something is going on between the two because, after an argument between Terrence and Joan, Gabriel Case tells the servant, \\"See she forgives him.\\" As the group stays at Elsewhere, things get even stranger. Terrence opens a door to find a family and two priests who throw holy water at him, burning him. When Anna and Joan go for a walk, they notice they can no longer see any lights coming from the city even though it is just across from the island. The group then holds a seance where strange paranormal events occur. Terrence sees a dog even though there are no dogs at Elsewhere, and a spirit spells out words for them on a Ouija board. Terrance also has trouble remembering if he brought his dogs along with him, and the other members of the group get strangely confused when he asks them. In the story's climax, a paranormal entity attacks Joan and Terrence while they're in a room together, banging on the door furiously as it tries to get inside. When Anna and Gabriel return from a stroll on the beach, Joan and Terrence tell them what happened and Gabriel suggest they watch the video tapes from the cameras to see what happened. There are no paranormal events on the cameras and one of the group members then notices the dates on the camera are wrong. When they go back downstairs they are all killed by an invisible entity‚Äîexcept for Gabriel who watches them get killed with a rather calm look on his face. The book then skips back to the beginning, only this time the characters realize events are repeating themselves. Gabriel then explains that the three died on their way to Elsewhere and that in refusing to go on they haunted the place, living in an endless cycle. Gabriel was then tasked to watch over them until they became aware of this cycle. The family and priests Terrence saw were the current owners of the house who had hired the priests to get rid of the ghosts. Gabriel then tells them that they are now able to go on and Joan and Terrence walk on to the afterlife where Terrence is reunited with his dogs. Anna Trawley eventually allows herself to be led by Gabriel to the afterlife. When she asks why he lied about the whole thing he tells her \\"ghost lie\\". Meanwhile, back at the house, the current owners are happy the ghosts are gone. It is revealed that Gabriel and the Servant were actually the doctor and his wife who had haunted the house before Joan, Terrence, and Anna showed up. One of the priests notices a painting on the wall of the house that looks a lot like his partner. While walking down the beach, the priests begin talking and one of them turns to the other, \\"but there was nobody there\\". Characters Joan Freeboard- a Realtor assigned to sell Elsewhere, it is her that gathers the group together. She is very stubborn and has a no nonsense personality but is also described by Terrence as being vulnerable. Due to her stubborn personality she is the last to accept the haunting of Elsewhere. Terrence Dare- A writer, and one of Joan's best friends, he was brought along to write an article about the haunting of Elsewhere. Out of the entire group it is him that reacts the strongest to the paranormal events that go on at Elsewhere. A catholic that has renounced his faith, Gabriel suggest this is why Terrence was the one who saw the priests at Elsewhere. Anna Trawley- A psychic that gained her powers in a car accident that killed her daughter, she is very much aware of the haunting of Elsewhere. While there she keeps a journal of the events that go on there, and many of the events are ones the others are not aware of. Gabriel Case- Although he passes himself off as a paranormal investigator for much of the book, he is actually the ghost of the doctor that murdered his wife and haunted Elsewhere. He was tasked with watching over the group until they became aware they were trapped in a seemingly endless cycle.

It is also projected to become a part of an international export route, carrying Russian gas to East Asian countries, such as the People's Republic of China, South Korea and Japan. The pipeline is owned and operated by Gazprom. It was opened on 8 September 2011.  History  The project was announced in September 2007, when the Russian Federation's Industry and Energy Ministry approved the gas Development Program for Eastern Siberia and the Far East. It was aimed at reducing utility prices in the Russian Far East by replacing more expensive coal and petroleum at the regional power and heating plants with cheaper natural gas. The pipeline project was approved by Gazprom's board of directors on 23 July 2008. At the same meeting, Gazprom's board of directors agreed to purchase the Komsomolsk‚ÄìKhabarovsk pipeline, commissioned in November 2006 by Daltransgaz, a former subsidiary of Rosneft. Design and exploration work was completed in November 2008 and working documentation was prepared by April 2009. Construction began on 31 July 2009 in Khabarovsk with a ceremony, which was attended by the Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. The pipeline was opened on 8 September 2011. The opening ceremony on Russky Island was again attended by Prime Minister Putin. The first gas consumer in the Primorsky Krai was Vladivostok Combined Heat and Power Plant 2 (CHPP-2), tasked with converting from coal to natural gas. In early 2012, CHPP-1 and the heating plant in Severnaya will be converted to natural gas. Route The Sakhalin‚ÄìKhabarovsk‚ÄìVladivostok gas transport system consists of three sections. The Khabarovsk‚ÄìVladivostok section together with the first phase of the Sakhalin‚ÄìKomsomolsk section, which supplies gas from the Gazprom's Far East northern part's gas fields, will create a pipeline system. The third section - the Komsomolsk‚ÄìHabarovsk pipeline, commissioned in 2006- would then be connected to the proposed Yakutia‚ÄìKhabarovsk‚ÄìVladivostok pipeline. The pipeline will supply gas to China and Japan and there is a planned link to South Korea. From Vladvivostok, a Chinese pipeline under construction since 2015 by China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau will extend across China, reaching Shanghai. The pipeline also will feed a planned LNG plant in Primorsky Krai, producing liquefied natural gas for export to Japan, and a proposed petrochemical complex. There are also plans to supply gas from Vladivostok to Japan and South Korea by subsea pipelines. An alternative route to South Korea would be via an overland pipeline through North Korea. According to Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, this proposed pipeline would help strengthen security in East Asia by meeting North Korea's energy needs and providing it with transit revenue. The project was also discussed during the visit of Kim Jong Il to Russia in August 2011. Technical description The capacity of the pipeline is of natural gas per year during the first stage, rising to by 2020, of which would be supplied from Sakhalin. It is expected to cost US$21‚Äì24 billion. The diameter of the Sakhalin‚ÄìKomsomolsk and Khabarovsk‚ÄìVladivostok pipelines is , with a working pressure of . The diameter of the Komsomolsk‚ÄìKhabarovsk pipeline is . In addition to the three pipelines, the Sakhalin‚ÄìKhabarovsk‚ÄìVladivostok system consists of the Sakhalin main compressor station, a gas distribution station in Vladivostok, a power supply, telemechanics, communications systems and access roads. Supply source The pipeline is fed from the Sakhalin-III project with additional gas provided from the Sakhalin-II project. The main supply source is the Gazprom- owned Kirinskoye field. Owner The pipeline project was developed by Gazprom Invest Vostok, a subsidiary of Gazprom. The pipeline is operated by Gazprom.
