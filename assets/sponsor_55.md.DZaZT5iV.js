The district includes 57 contributing buildings as well as a historic water tower and sign. Centralia's business district developed around the Illinois Central Railroad tracks, as the town was established by and named for the railroad. The earliest buildings in the district date from the 1850s, as the city was platted in 1853. Centralia's first commercial buildings were mainly designed in the Italianate style, which was predominant until the end of the 19th century; the Romanesque Revival style also gained popularity in the 1880s. Around the turn of the century, the Commercial style became the most popular style in the district. The Renaissance Revival and Classical Revival styles can also be seen in buildings from this era, and by the 1930s Art Deco and Modernist architecture became popular. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 7, 2012. Two buildings within the district, the Egyptian Revival Sentinel Building and the Classical Revival Elks Lodge, are individually listed in the National Register.

Griffiths now has no permanent inhabitants, but is connected to the mainland by a causeway and is accessible on foot. It forms part of the Port Fairy and Belfast Coastline Protection Reserve and, as well as being a tourist attraction, is an important site in the context of the history of European settlement of western Victoria. It is managed by the Moyne Shire Council. History There is little surviving evidence of Aboriginal use of the island, though it was visited by the local Gunditjmara people, who knew it as Moleen. Following commercial investigation of the western Victorian coast, it was named after John Griffiths, an entrepreneur and merchant from Launceston in northern Tasmania, who figures prominently in the early history of the area. From the mid-1830s until 1843 the island served as a base for a bay whaling station for southern right whales, until the supply of whales was exhausted and the industry went into terminal decline. Some shipbuilding also took place during the 1840s. The abandoned whaling station buildings were later used until 1854 by Flora Dunlop, widow of Victorian politician Alexander Dunlop, as a 'mission' for young Aborigines. Because of its historic and archaeological significance, the island has been listed on the Victorian Heritage Register (H1659). Lighthouse Griffiths Island Lighthouse was built in 1859 as a navigation aid at a time when Port Fairy was becoming an important trading port for western Victoria. Extensive harbour works undertaken then and subsequently, mainly to improve the navigability of the Moyne River and its approaches, have affected the shape and boundaries of the island. The lighthouse is operated by the Victorian Channels Authority, part of the Port of Melbourne Corporation. It was constructed on what was then Rabbit Island, at the eastern end of Griffiths, from local bluestone by Scottish stonemasons. The stairway was constructed with each step being inserted in the next course of stone in the outer wall. The lighthouse was initially manned by two keepers. The last keeper to live on the island was there from 1929 to 1954, when the light was automated; the two stone keepers‚Äô cottages were subsequently demolished in about 1956. Description The low- lying island is about long and wide at its widest point, with an area of about . It is bordered on its northern side by the Moyne River, which has been channeled between stone 'training walls' and provides easy access by sea to the port of Port Fairy. Originally a cluster of three separate islands ‚Äì Goat, Rabbit and Griffiths ‚Äì harbour works and coastal accretion have consolidated them into a single island which protects the mouth of the Moyne and shelters Port Fairy Bay. Geology Griffiths is an isolated outcrop of basaltic reefs and boulders on a substrate of early Pleistocene limestone, with overlying calcareous sand. It was formed by lava flows from Mount Rouse, a volcano near Penshurst, that reached the coast some 3‚Äì400,000 years ago. It is bounded in part by collapsed lava tunnels, such as the South West Passage across which the causeway was constructed. More recent limestone, about 100,000 years old, occurs on the southern coast of the island. Holocene dunes which cover parts of the island are about 6000 years old. Flora Griffiths Island lies in the Warrnambool Plain Bioregion. The original vegetation would have been similar to that of nearby areas, consisting of coastal shrubland, grassland and woodland. It has been heavily modified by the various human activities the island has been subject to. Predominant native plant species include bower spinach, small leaved clematis, seaberry saltbush, coast beard-heath, cushion bush, karkalla, common boobialla, knobby club- sedge, coast spear-grass, coast sword-sedge, kangaroo apple, coast daisy bush, coast tussock-grass, hairy spinifex and bidgee-widgee. marram grass was extensively planted in the past in an attempt to mitigate erosion. Fauna The island is home to a large colony of short-tailed shearwaters Some 80‚Äì90 bird species have been recorded from the island, especially seabirds and waders. There is a large breeding colony of short-tailed shearwaters, locally known as 'muttonbirds', with an estimated 100,000 burrows (of which probably fewer than half are occupied during the September‚ÄìApril breeding season). The shearwater colony is a tourist attraction in spring and summer, with a viewing platform constructed to facilitate watching the birds as they return in a swarm to their burrows at dusk. Other animals resident on the island include swamp wallabies, short-beaked echidnas, blue-tongued lizards and tiger snakes.

An ice dam is an ice build-up on the eaves of sloped roofs of heated buildings that results from melting snow under a snow pack reaching the eave and freezing there. Freezing at the eave impedes the drainage of meltwater, which adds to the ice dam and causes backup of the meltwater, which may cause water leakage into the roof and consequent damage to the building and its contents if the water leaks through the roof. Mechanism The ice on the wall is from water leaking through the roof due to an ice dam. Ice dams occur on heated buildings with sloping roofs in cold climates with deep snow accumulation. Ice dams on roofs form when accumulated snow forms an insulating layer under cold conditions that would cause the freezing point to be within the snow layer, if it were not subject to melting. Instead, building heat coming through the roof's surface melts the snow resting on it. This causes meltwater to flow down the roof, until it reaches below a place on the roof's surface that is below freezing‚Äîtypically at the eaves where there is no building heat. When the meltwater reaches the frozen surface, ice accumulates, growing a barrier that impedes further passage of meltwater off the roof. Ice dams may result in leaks through the roofing material, possibly resulting in damaged ceilings, walls, roof structure and insulation, damage or injury when the ice dam falls off or from attempts to remove ice dams.Paul Fisette, \\"Preventing Ice Dams\\", Roofing, flashing & waterproofing. Newtown, CT: Taunton Press, 2005. 54. The melting of roof snow comes from the combination of three basic causes: #Air temperatures well below freezing. #A thick layer of dry snow, which has good insulating capabilities. #Heat from the building coming through the roof. If any of these factors is absent, ice dams cannot form. Above freezing air does not promote ice dams, nor does granulated spring snow on a roof, which has poor insulating capabilities, nor does a roof that doesn't warm to above freezing at its surface. Ice dams may occur when the under-roof temperature is above and the outdoor air temperature is below . Mitigation Ice dams on sloped roofs can be mitigated in several ways:Hansen, Erik. Snow engineering: recent advances and developments: proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Snow Engineering: Trondheim, Norway, 19‚Äì21 June 2000. Rotterdam: A.A. Balkema, 2000. 219. *Assuring sufficient insulation in the roof to prevent freezing at the roof surface under a deep snow pack. *Providing ventilation under the roofing material that carries escaping building heat elsewhere and assures a cold roof surface. Attic/roof temperatures can be controlled by installing sufficient insulation and providing natural or mechanical ventilation to produce a \\"cold roof\\" to keep the roof temperature below . *Providing heat tape or cables that create channels for meltwater to escape through any ice dam at the eaves. Heat tapes incur energy expense, may cause long-term damage to asphalt shingles, and may present a risk of fire. Some insurance companies do not allow the use of heat tapes due to the fire danger.Gordon Bock, \\"Frost in the Rafters, Ice on the Eaves: How to Deal With Winter Moisture\\". Old-House Journal. vol. XXI no. 6. November‚ÄìDecember 1993. 32-34. Ice dams can also form just above the heat tape. *Constructing a roof with a slippery surface that is steep enough for snow to slide off, before it can melt. An ice belt‚Äîa band of metal roofing‚Äîinstalled at the eaves helps prevent the formation of ices dams by placing a low-friction surface where ice dams are likely to form. If an ice dam does form, the ice belt may reduce the penetration of standing water. Metal roofs with adequate roof pitch and minimal valleys are effective at shedding snow. Removal When an ice dam occurs there are some maintenance options to remove it: * Removal of snow from a roof with a special tool called a roof rake. To be successful, the entire roof must be shoveled. Shoveling part way up a roof will cause an ice dam to form at the location where the snow was left, because the meltwater will freeze when it hits the freezing air. * Removal of ice buildup on a roof can be completed by trained professionals that use special steam equipment to ensure quick and safe removal without causing damage to the roof. Mechanical removal with a hammer, chisel or other tools is likely to damage the integrity of the roof. * Ice melt socks: A manufactured, permeable material (the sock) filled with ice melt placed on the ice dam will lower the freezing point of the ice, thus causing it to melt. Leak prevention Assuring integrity of the roof's waterproofing prevents leaks and consequent damage. * A roofing membrane, required by building codes in the United States, installed under the roofing material helps prevent leakage from ice damming, but has no effect on the formation of ice dams.

After her accident, she was fitted with a prosthetic leg, and placed second in the school 100 metres event. She competed for South Africa at the Paralympic Youth Games in 2009, and narrowly missed qualifying for the Australian athletics team for the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London. Australian Paralympic snowboarding coach Peter Higgins identified Badenhorst as a likely snowboarder after the London Games, and she commenced training in this sport. In taking up snowboarding, she needed a new custom-made leg. Badenhorst said: \\"I need a special leg that has to be engineered differently to accommodate the different pressures and angles of snowboarding\\". In the lead-up to the 2014 Sochi Games, Badenhorst competed and trained in the Netherlands, Austria, and the United States. By February 2014, she was ranked eighth in the world.

He is one of the founding members of the arts collective Smugglers Records. Since self releasing his debut album Advert Soundtracks in 2011 he has toured extensively across the world as a headline act and opened for the likes of Billy Bragg, Valerie June, Frank Turner and The Proclaimers. He has headlined venues including Union Chapel and Shepherd's Bush Empire. His fifth studio album The Spirit of Minnie was released in 2018. History Will Varley began playing open mic nights in London in the early 2000s, setting up his own nights in the Grey Horse, Kingston with friends Tom Farrer and Nick Marks. He was a regular at numerous venues including The Half Moon, Putney and the 12 Bar Club and would often play different open mics seven nights a week. During this time he shared stages with acts including Jamie T, Bastille and The Vaccines. In 2010 he moved to Kent and set up Smugglers Records with the band Cocos Lovers. He released his debut album Advert Soundtracks through his own label in 2011 and toured the album on foot. In September 2013 his second album As The Crow Flies was released and garnered positive reviews & was described as \\"Excellent\\" by Q magazine. The album received airplay on BBC Radio 3, Radio 6 & XFM. In an interview on BBC Introducing in March 2014, Varley announced he would be embarking on another walking tour in May, this time travelling the entire south coast of England. The Rambling Tour saw Varley walk almost 500 miles with a guitar on his back, playing 24 shows along the way. During an interview with Steve Lamacq on BBC6 Varley said he was working on new material and was aiming to release a third album in early 2015. On 29 March 2015 Varley signed a record deal with Xtra Mile Recordings while backstage at The Royal Albert Hall shortly before taking to the stage to open for Frank Turner. A new digital only EP Will Varley Live at The Lighthouse was released in May 2015 to coincide with Varley's spring tour of the UK. The EP reached number 19 in the iTunes singer/songwriter chart and national radio play from XFM's John Kennedy. Soon after the record was released it was announced that Varley would be supporting The Proclaimers on thirteen dates across the UK. Varley's third album Postcards from Ursa Minor was released on Xtra Mile Recordings on 30 October 2015. The Independent described it as a \\"gem of a record\\". The album reached number 11 in the Official Independent Album Breakers Chart. The album's lead single, \\"Seize the Night\\", was played on BBC Radio 1. The song has since been streamed almost 5 million times on Spotify. Following the album release, Varley toured the UK and Germany with Frank Turner and shortly afterwards began his own headline tour of the UK, finishing with a sell-out show at London's Scala. A week later he began a tour of North America supporting Skinny Lister. The tour began with a show on the Salty Dog Cruise from Miami to The Bahamas organised by Flogging Molly. \\"Seize the Night\\", the third single from Postcards from Ursa Minor, was included on NPR's Austin 100 list for the annual SXSW festival. In April 2016, Varley announced he would be doing a further twenty-five shows with The Proclaimers over the summer, and three shows opening for Billy Bragg. He also appeared at numerous UK festivals including Bestival, Cambridge Folk Festival and Glastonbury Festival. In September it was announced that Kingsdown Sundown, Varley's 4th studio album, would be released on 4 November 2016. The album reached number 26 in the Official Independent Album Charts. Over the Autumn Varley embarked on further tours of North America, Ireland, Germany and the UK including a sold-out show at Union Chapel, Islington. Throughout the Spring of 2017 Varley toured Europe opening for Valerie June and the US extensively opening for Frank Turner, William Elliott Whitmore and Lincoln Durham. While on stage at Glastonbury Festival 2017, Varley played two brand new songs and said he was working on new material for an album. On 4 July during an interview with Huw Stevens on BBC Radio 1 the head of Xtra Mile Recordings, Charlie Caplowe, stated that the label were planning on releasing a new Varley album in Autumn 2017. On 9 February 2018 The Spirit of Minnie was released on Xtra Mile Recordings, reaching number two in the iTunes Singer Songwriter charts in the UK, number three in Germany and making the top 30 in the US. The album was produced by legendary record producer Cameron McVey and mastered by Frank Arkwright at Abbey Road Studios, London. It differs from previous Varley albums as it was recorded with a full band. The UK leg of the album tour culminated with a show at London's 2000 capacity Shepherd's Bush Empire. The album's lead single \\"Seven Days\\" was featured on Channel 4's Sunday Brunch. The album was reviewed favourably, with The Times describing Varley as being at his \\"Lyrical Best\\" and Clash Magazine saying the album \\"Evokes the likes of Bright Eyes, Springsteen and Dylan effortlessly.\\" A week later Varley began a three-week tour of the US opening for label mates Skinny Lister, before returning to Europe in April for a headline tour, selling out shows across Germany and The Netherlands. May 2018 saw Varley and his band in residence with John Kennedy at Radio X, recording live tracks at Radio X Studios, London which were broadcast nationally over the following week. In July 2018 Varley was invited to perform at Fairport Convention‚Äôs Cropredy festival by members of the original band. This marked his biggest show to date, performing in front of some 10,000 festival attendees. That summer he also made appearances at Bearded Theory Festival, Green Man, and his own Smugglers Festival, amongst others. In Autumn 2018 Varley self released his first live album Live at Shepherds Bush Empire. The album was well received and has been streamed on Spotify over 350,000 times since its release. Autumn also saw Varley opening for The Proclaimers again in the UK and touring the UK and Europe as a headline act, selling out numerous shows across the UK, Germany, Netherlands, Denmark, Switzerland and Austria. During this tour Varley also played his first ever shows in Poland, Italy and France. In March 2019 during his showcase at Stephen F's Hotel in Austin, TX Varley announced he had parted ways with Xtra Mile Recordings. In June 2019 Varley embarked on his first headline tour of the US, playing 11 shows across the Midwest and the East Coast. In September 2019 Varley said on social media that he had been working on new material and would be playing new songs at an intimate show at the 200 capacity London venue, The Lexington in November. The show sold out in 90 minutes. Discography * Advert Soundtracks (June 2011) ** 1. The Sound of the Markets Crashing ** 2. King for a King ** 3. Advert Soundtrack ** 4. Newborn ** 5.

He won the Australian Speedcar Championship in 1965. Career Peter Cunneen raced during a golden age for speedway at the Sydney Showground ‚Äì a time when crowds regularly exceeded 30,000 people ‚Äì and competed in an incredible 247 feature races at the famous arena, more than any other driver in history. Known for his skilful driving and consistency, Cunneen amassed 18 wins, 23 seconds and 29 thirds at the Showground during his career. Cunneen began his speedway career in the mid-1950s and quickly established himself as one of the country's elite drivers. In 1957, he took 4th place in the NSW Championship, 7th in the Australian Championship and 2nd place in the World Derby. Higher honours did not elude him for long as he claimed both the NSW and QLD Speedcar Championships in 1958. In 1961, Cunneen competed in the World Derby amongst a host of the era's biggest stars, including state champions, Jack O'Dea (Victoria) and Bruce Rickard (South Australia), and international drivers, Bob Tattersall (USA) and Leroy Warriner (USA). Starting from near the back of the field, Cunneen fought his way through the star-studded line-up to establish a commanding lead. He appeared certain to snare the title when, entering the final lap, a pin sheared in his steering box, sending him careening into the wall of the arena and resulting in one of the most spectacular crashes in Australian Speedway history. Cunneen was thrown from his car, but remained attached to the somersaulting vehicle by his lap belt. Remarkably, he was not seriously injured. In 1965, at the height of his powers, Cunneen edged out Lew Marshall to become the inaugural winner of the Craven Filter Australian Speedcar Championship. This was the first championship that required drivers to compete across the country and, subsequently, it is considered by some to be the first 'true' Australian Speedcar Championship. In the same year, Cunneen was named as Australian Motorsports Driver of the Year. Cunneen retired from speedway racing in 1969.

In the middle of the 19th century, the local researcher, folklorist, and graphic artist Christian Peter Hansen (1803-1879) portrayed Ekke Nekkepenn as a merman who lives with his wife Rahn at the bottom of the North Sea and plays mischievous tricks on seafarers and residents of the North Frisian Islands. In Theodor Storm‚Äôs 1866 published fairy tale ‚ÄúThe Rain Maiden‚Äù, a little man of fire with the name Eckeneckenpen appears and casts evil spells to make the fields wither.  C. P. Hansen‚Äôs Meerman Ekke Nekkepenn  Today's well-known depiction of Ekke Nekkepenn goes back to Christian Peter Hansen, who retold various legends from the island of Sylt in his 1858 book Frisian Tales And Legends. One of the stories is titled ‚ÄúThe Merman Ekkehard Nekkepenn.‚Äù The story begins when Ekke Nekkepenn asks the captain, whose England-bound ship runs into a storm, to help with the birth of his child. The beautiful and helpful wife of the captain is led by the merman to his home at the bottom of the North Sea, where his wife Rahn was. After a successful birth, she is returned to the surface of the sea, bringing gold and silver. The captain and his wife continue their journey and later, arrive safe and sound to their home of Rantum on Sylt. Several years later, Ekke Nekkepenn remembered this incident and decides ‚Äì now that Rahn has become ‚Äúold and wrinkly‚Äù ‚Äì to take the captain's wife as his own. When he sees the Rantumer Captain's ship one day, he persuades Rahn, who's sitting on the seabed, to grind salt, and the resulting powerful vortex pulls down the Sylt ship along with its crew. On the way to the captain's wife, Ekke Nekkepenn, who has turned into a handsome sailor, meets their young daughter Inge at Rantum's beach. Against her will, he places a gold ring on each of her fingers, hangs a gold chain around her neck, and declares her his bride. When the girl tearfully asks him to release her, he replies that he could do this only if she could tell him his name the next night. But no one on the island knows the stranger. As Inge walks along the beach in despair the next evening, she hears at the southern time at H√∂rnum a voice from the mountain, who sings: :Today I want to brew; :Tomorrow I will bake; :The day after tomorrow the wedding I‚Äôll make. :My name‚Äôs Ekke Nekkepenn, :My bride is Inge Rantum, :And no one knows when I‚Äôm alone. In Styl Fresian: : : : : : : Then she returns to the arranged meeting place and calls the arriving stranger: ‚ÄúYour name is Ekke Nekkepenn and I remain Inge from Rantum.‚Äù Because of this, the foolhardy merman cherishes a rage against the residents at Styl and lets loose whenever he feels like it.  Ekke Nekkepenn and Nordic Mythology  C.P. Hansen already dealt in the context of his work on The History of the Friesian Uthlande (1856) with Nordic mythology and reached his own conclusions in Leipzig in 1847 from the published work The Nordic Myth Book After a Series of Lectures from Carsten Hauch (1790-1872). In his 1850, published ‚ÄúMaterials on a Frisian Mythology‚Äù Hansen wrote: ‚ÄúThe god of the sea was called by the Germans √ñgis, by the Danes Eiger, by the Frisians Eie or Eia, also Ekke or Nekke‚Ä¶ His wife was the goddess Ran, who blessed the beach, pulled castaways in her nets, and is perhaps where the dun village of Rantum gets its name. ‚ÄòRane‚Äô means incidentally in Nordic as much as ‚Äòto rob.‚Äô According to one Frisian legend Ekke tried to marry a Rantum woman named Inge but got a refusal.‚Äù In fact, all of these references produced by Hansen were demonstrated convincingly by Willy Krogmann in his afterword to a Volume of Sylt Legends 1966 to be errors. Neither can the place name Rantum be traced to the Old Norse word Ran, nor is there evidence of an etymological connection between the name of the Norse sea god √Ügir and the word ‚ÄúEkke.‚Äù Therefore, Krogmann refers to the character Ekke Nekkepenn as Hansen's invention. Among the produced references from Hansen to an old-Nordic goes Ran Krogmann clarified: ‚ÄúJust like the sea god Ekke Nekkepenn, Hansen also invented the sea goddess Raan, or as he writes, Raand.‚Äù  Regarding the Genesis Story: Hansen‚Äôs Depiction  Hansen's \\"The Meerman Ekke Nekkepenn\\" is based on two different legends between which there was no original connection. The first part of the story is based on a legend of a water man (Krogmann, Sylt Legends, Nr. 36, p. 17), while the second part is a North Friesian variant on the well-known Rumpelstiltsken fairy tale (Krogmann, Nr. 27, p. 13). The original water man saga resembles in many features Hansen's depiction, but ends with the safe return of the captain's wife on board their ship. Hansen linked the tales together by making the original dwarf the ‚Äúmerman‚Äù Ekke Nekkepenn. Assuming that the name of the character goes back to the same period as the Rumpelstiltskin tale, it may be that the relationship of name component Nekke is connected to the old high German , , or , old English , and old Nordic . These mean ‚Äúwater spirit‚Äù or ‚Äúwater monster‚Äù and are also Niss, Neck, or N√∂ck and are known in their female form as Nixe, who in turn are not related to the Rumpelstiltskin tale. The name would then play on the onomatopoeia of Ekke. Thus it is likely that Hansen was inspired by the harmony in melding the two tales. Eckeneckepenn as Fire Man in Storm's Tale ‚ÄúThe Rain Maiden.‚Äù Only eight years after the publication of Hansen's legends and stories, Theodor Storm used the substance of the Rumpelstiltskin dwarf in his fairy tale ‚ÄúThe Rain Maiden‚Äù and depicted him as a malicious goblin. While Hansen's is a merman Storm makes Eckeneckepenn a fire man, who makes fields wither with his magic spells.

Release The album was self-produced and assembled by Thes One and Double K, and it was handed out at a small number of live shows during their 2000-2001 world tour in support of Question in the Form of an Answer.

Eventually, hauling the extra weight in merchandise (including the American Men Vol. 1 CDs) became too difficult, so midway through the tour, Thes One and Double K were forced to unload them in bulk on a middle-man who sold them to various stores in the United Kingdom.

The park is notable for its views and for its ecological conservation features. \\"Muscota\\" comes from a Lenape word meaning \\"place of rushes\\" or \\"place in the reeds\\". Muscota Marsh is unusual for having both a freshwater marsh and a salt marsh in such a tiny area. Besides attracting plant and animal life, these wetlands are intended to help filter rainwater runoff and thereby improve the water quality of the river. Other facilities include a dock for kayaks and canoes, benches, and walking paths. A wooden deck overlooking the river provides views of Inwood Hill Park, the Henry Hudson Bridge, and the New Jersey Palisades. Opened to the public in January 2014, the park was constructed by Columbia University as part of a deal to construct the new Campbell Sports Center within its adjacent athletics complex. It was designed by James Corner Field Operations, which also worked on Manhattan's High Line. It is cooperatively administered by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation and Columbia, with the university providing maintenance and security.

The work had been written to soothe his grief after the death of his daughter, Tullia, which had occurred in February of the same year. Not much is known about the work, although it seems to have been inspired by the Greek philosopher Crantor's ancient work De Luctu (\\"On Grief\\"), and its structure was probably similar to a series of letter correspondences between Servius Sulpicius Rufus and Cicero. Fragments of the work survive, having been quoted by Lactantius, and Jerome makes note of the work in a consolatory letter to Heliodorus of Altino. A popular piece of writing until its loss, the Consolatio is widely accepted as the distinct work that transmitted the earlier consolatio literary tradition to the Romans of the late Republic. In 1583, Italian scholar Carlo Sigonio claimed to have discovered a non- fragmentary version of the Consolatio, although most scholars now agree that this work was a fake, with modern stylometric methods backing this up. Background Marcus Tullius Cicero (January 3, 106 BC ‚Äì December 7, 43 BC) was an Ancient Roman philosopher and politician, famous for his oratory skills. He came from a wealthy municipal family of the Roman equestrian order, and is widely considered one of Rome's greatest orators, and one of the premier prose stylists during the Golden Age of Latin.Rawson (1975), p. 303.Haskell (1964), pp. 300‚Äì301.Forsyth et al. (1999), pp. 375‚Äì400. Tullia (August 5, 79 BC or 78 BC ‚Äì February 45 BC), Cicero's daughter, died in the winter of 45 BC after giving birth to her second son; this caused Cicero to go into a period of deep mourning.Treggiari (2007), p. 13.Cole (2014), p. 1. Cicero decided to stay with his friend Titus Pomponius Atticus for a time, during which he perused Atticus's library, reading any and all books that dealt with overcoming grief.MacKendrick (1989), p. 106. Unsatisfied with what he found, he relocated to his villa at Astura, where he composed the Consolatio. (It was during this time that he also wrote the famed‚Äîand now lost‚Äîdialogue Hortensius.)Taylor (1963), p. 488. Cicero later opined that the Consolatio was written in an attempt not only to heal himself emotionally, but also to benefit others who are mourning or experiencing sadness.Baraz (2012), p. 94.Cicero, De Divinatione 2.3. Contents Pliny the Elder quotes Cicero in the preface to his Naturalis Historia as saying, \\"I follow [the Greek philosopher] Crantor in my Consolatio\\" (in consolatione filiae Crantorem ... sequor).Pliny the Elder, Naturalis Historia, \\"Preface\\" 22. Centuries later, the Christian theologian Jerome, in a consolation letter to Heliodorus of Altino concerning the death of St. Nepotian, makes a similar reference, writing that the Consolatio was heavily based on Crantor's ancient work De Luctu (\\"On Grief\\"). Some have suggested that Cicero \\"followed Crantor exclusively or even principally\\" when composing the Consolatio, but David Scourfield repudiates this view, arguing it was more likely that Cicero's Consolatio simply agreed with Crantor rather than slavishly duplicated his work. Paul MacKendrick argues that the general outline for the Consolatio can be deduced based both on the structure used by Servius Sulpicius Rufus in a consolation letter sent to Cicero following Tullia's death, as well as the structure of Cicero's reply.MacKendrick (1989), p. 107. From the snippets that remain of the work, it would appear that the piece was addressed to Cicero himself. A novel part of the Consolatio seems to be Cicero's idea that Tullia deserves to be deified as a god. Cicero notes that, in order for his plan to work, her deification must both be approved of by the gods, as well as the Roman public. In order to win over the public, he writes that he will build Tullia a memorial in a well-known location.Cole (2014), pp. 1‚Äì3. Cicero also lists a number of famous individuals who have been deified to justify his proposed apotheosis of Tullia. The only extant pieces of the Consolatio are fragments, one of which was preserved by Cicero himself in his Tusculanae Disputationes.MacKendrick (1989), p. 108. Seven other fragments were preserved by the early Christian author Lactantius in his work Institutiones Divinae (The Divine Institutes). Lactantius used the excerpts from the Consolatio both to point out the futility of paganism, as well as to argue that pagans actually accept some tenets of Christianity without them even realizing it. Lactantius criticized what Cicero wrote, but he also applauded Cicero at times for parallelingalbeit coincidentallywhat the Bible says.MacKendrick (1989), pp. 10607. However, the lines preserved by Lactantius have been criticized due to their lack of context. MacKendrick notes that Lactantius was using \\"partial quotation[s]\\" in order to frame what Cicero wrote so that Lactantius could more easily refute his ideas. Another important reference to the work can be found in the aforementioned letter by Jerome addressed to Heliodorus; Jerome noted that the Consolatio contained references to \\"men who showed equal fortitude in sorrow and war\\", namely: Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, Cato the Elder, Quintus Gallius, Gaius Calpurnius Piso, Lucius Junius Brutus, Quintus Mucius Scaevola Augur, Scaurus, Quintus Marcius Rex, Publius Licinius Crassus, and Gnaeus Aufidius Orestes, as well as members of the Metellus and Marcellus families.MacKendrick (1989), pp. 10809. Legacy The Consolatio was of major importance, and Scourfield argues that it is the distinct work that introduced the Greek consolatio tradition to the Romans of the late Republic.Scourfield (1993), pp. 19‚Äì22. The work may have survived well into the 15th century; St. Ambrose Traversari claimed in his Hodoeporicon to have discovered \\"a short work about consolation\\" (opusculum de Consolatione) at Perugia, Italy in 1432 AD.Robinson (1893), p. 197. Forgery Now considered a forgery, the Pseudo-Ciceronian Consolatio was discovered by Carlo Sigonio in 1582. In 1583, Italian scholar Carlo Sigonio claimed to have discovered a non-fragmentary version of the Consolatio. While this news was met with excitement at first, scholars‚Äîafter reading the work‚Äîbegan to argue that the manuscript was a fraud, with humanist Antonio Riccoboni being among the most vocal.Forsyth et al. (1999), p. 376. However, Sigonio continued to defend the work until his death, even mentioning in two different orations his belief in the truthfulness of the text. The scholar Latino Latini, however, later claimed in a letter that Sigonio had admitted to the forgery on his deathbed, although the truth of this statement is unknown. By and large, the academic community concluded that the version of the Consolatio discovered was not genuine, and the document is now known as the Pseudo-Ciceronian Consolatio.Sage (1910), pp. 7‚Äì9, 25‚Äì46. Despite the gradual condemnation of the work and the accusation that Sigonio had created it himself, there were some holdouts. Robinson Ellis, in 1893, argued that the Pseudo-Ciceronian Consolatio, while probably not a genuine work of Cicero's, was not a forgery by Sigonio. He reasoned that, because St. Ambrose Traversari had claimed to find a copy of the work so close to its rediscovery by Sigonio in 1583, it was possible that Sigonio had simply found the Perugian text. He then considered the hypothesis (also discussed by Evan Taylor Sage)Sage (1910), p. 26. that, because the Pseudo-Ciceronian Consolatio contained all of the extant fragments of Cicero that are to be found in Lactantius's work, the actual Consolatio had been lost in the distant past and quietly replaced at some point by an imitation. This falsely-attributed work, Ellis wrote, could have then been read by those late antiquity authors who quoted Cicero, such as Lactantius, Augustine, and Jerome. It was this false Consolatio, so the hypothesis goes, that was rediscovered by Sigonio, who also unwittingly believed it also to be genuine. Finally, Ellis argued that, because Sigonio was a man of \\"high character\\" who had spent much of his life editing the fragments of Cicero, for Sigonio to stoop to forgery would have been completely out of character. In 1999, Richard Forsyth, David Holmes, and Emily Tse used linguistic techniques to test the origin of the Pseudo-Ciceronian Consolatio. Forsyth, Holmes, and Tse focused their research on two types of Latin: Cicero's writing and \\"Ciceronianism\\" (a style of New Latin popular in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries that sought to emulate the style of Cicero). The three scholars argued that if the Pseudo-Ciceronian Consolatio were devoid of \\"Ciceronianism\\"that is to say New Latinthen it could be accepted as a genuine work of Cicero. Forsyth, Holmes, and Tse collected six Classical Latin authors (viz. Cicero, Julius Caesar, Cornelius Nepos, Gaius Sallustius Crispus, Lucius Annaeus Seneca, and Publius Cornelius Tacitus), and five New Latin authors (viz. Sigonio, Piero Vettori, Marc-Antoine Muret, Bernadino di Loredan, and Riccoboni) and compared them using stylometric methods. The three concluded that the text of the Pseudo-Ciceronian Consolatio is \\"extremely uncharacteristic of Cicero, and indeed that the text is much more likely to have been written during the Renaissance than in classical times.\\"Forsyth et al. (1999), p. 376. The study also provided evidence that the Pseudo- Ciceronian Consolatio matched more closely with Sigonio's, rather than any of the other New Latin writers, suggestingalthough not provingthat he penned the document.Forsyth et al. (1999), p. 39495.

Beginnings The paper was founded as the Spirit of the Age by J. Heron Foster, J. McMillin and J. B. Kennedy on 19 April 1843, with Foster as editor. Both daily and weekly editions were published. R. White Middleton bought the young paper in mid-1844 and edited it for less than a year until \\"sickness, poverty and oppression\\" drove him to quit. Foster retook the editorship for a short time before moving on and founding the Pittsburgh Dispatch. Riddle era In the middle of 1845, the daily title changed under new ownership to Daily Commercial Journal and Spirit of the Age, in: the latter half of which was eventually dropped. The name change signified that the paper would cater more than before to the interests of \\"the Manufacturer, the Farmer, and Merchant.\\" New editor Robert M. Riddle, formerly postmaster of Pittsburgh and editor of the Advocate, promised to replace the paper's previous political neutrality with a \\"thorough going Whig\\" slant in accordance with his own party affiliation. In 1853 Riddle was elected with Whig backing as mayor of Pittsburgh, which post he filled a single one- year term, at the same time continuing to manage the newspaper. As the Whig Party fell apart soon afterward, Riddle and the Journal shifted support to the ephemeral American Party before aligning with the up-and-coming Republican organization, all the while maintaining an anti-slavery, pro-Northern stance. Pittsburgh newspaper consolidation timeline The abolitionist weekly Saturday Visiter [sic], founded by editor Jane Swisshelm in 1847, was published from the Commercial Journal office. In 1854 it merged into the Journal's weekly edition, at the time called Family Journal, to form the Family Journal and Saturday Visiter. Swisshelm edited a \\"Visiter Department\\" within the merged edition. From this platform she promoted the causes of anti-slavery, temperance, and women's rights. Riddle conducted the Journal until 1858, when failing health prompted him to sell his interest to Thomas J. Bigham, who assumed editorial charge. Bigham was an abolitionist Republican who purportedly used his house as a refuge on the Underground Railroad. Consolidation The Commercial Journal merged into Pittsburgh's oldest paper, the Gazette, at the dawn of the Civil War in 1861. The consequently titled Daily Pittsburgh Gazette and Commercial Journal explained that \\"Both papers have long advocated essentially the same political principles and labored in the same cause, so that their separate publication was not essential to any public or political interest, while to advertisers the union will be one of great advantage.\\" References Category:Defunct newspapers published in Pittsburgh Category:Defunct daily newspapers Category:Publications established in 1843 Category:Publications disestablished in 1861 Category:1843 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:1861 disestablishments in Pennsylvania ","title":"Commercial Journal"},{"id":"41897778","text":"The Seekers is a 1979 American made-for-television drama film based on the historical novel The Seekers written by John Jakes, originally published in 1975.

Its editors are Betsy Reed, Glenn Greenwald, and Jeremy Scahill. It also publishes four podcasts: Intercepted, hosted by Scahil as well as Deconstructed. Murderville GA and Somebody. The Intercept has published in English since its founding, and in Portuguese since the 2016 launch of the Brazilian edition staffed by a local team of Brazilian journalists. History The Intercept was launched in February 2014, by First Look Media, which is funded by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. The publication initially reported on documents released by Edward Snowden. Awards In February 2016, The Intercept won a National Magazine Award for columns and commentary by the writer Barrett Brown, and it was a finalist in the public interest category for a series by Sharon Lerner called the Teflon Toxin, which exposed how DuPont harmed the public and its workers with toxic chemicals. In April 2016, The Intercept won the People's Voice award for best news website at the twentieth annual Webby Awards. In May 2016, The Intercept won three awards at the New York Press Club Awards For Journalism. The site was awarded in the \\"special event reporting\\" category for its investigative reporting on the U.S. drone program, the \\"humor\\" category for a series of columns by the writer Barrett Brown, and the \\"documentary\\" category for a short film called, \\"The Surrender\\"‚Äîabout the former U.S. intelligence analyst Stephen Jin-Woo Kim‚Äîproduced by Stephen Maing, Laura Poitras, and Peter Maass. At the September 2016 Online News Awards, The Intercept won the University of Florida Award in Investigative Data Journalism for its Drone Papers series, an investigation of secret documents detailing a covert U.S. military overseas assassination program. At the 2017 Online News Awards, The Intercept won two awards: the first for a feature story about the FBI's efforts to infiltrate the Bundy family, and the second, an investigative data journalism award for \\"Trial and Terror\\", a project documenting the people prosecuted in the U.S. for terrorism since 9/11. The same year, The Intercept won a Hillman Prize for Web Journalism for an investigative series by Jamie Kalven exposing criminality within the Chicago Police Department. The news organization also won a 2017 award for \\"Outstanding Feature Story\\" at the sixteenth annual Awards for Reporting on The Environment. Judges of the environmental award praised author Sharon Lerner for her piece \\"The Strange Case of Tennie White\\", which they described as a \\"finely written and disturbing investigation of contamination and injustice near a chemical plant in Mississippi\\". U.S. government reaction On August 15, 2014, U.S. National Counterintelligence Executive (NCE) William Evanina confirmed that the FBI is moving forward with a probe into how classified documents were leaked to The Intercept for its article revealing details about a database of terrorism suspects, which linked some people to terrorism even if they had no known association with any terrorism group. \\"It's a criminal act that has us very concerned,\\" said Evanina, a former FBI special agent with a counter-terrorism specialty who was appointed NCE by Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper in May 2014. In August 2014, it was reported that members of the U.S. military had been banned from reading The Intercept. Controversies Erik Wemple, writing for The Washington Post, noted the conspicuous refusal of The Intercept to use the term \\"targeted killings\\" to refer to the U.S. drone program, instead referring to the drone strikes as \\"assassinations\\". Wemple included Greenwald's explanation that assassination is \\"the accurate term rather than the euphemistic term that the government wants us to use\\"; Greenwald further noted that \\"anyone who is murdered deliberately away from a battlefield for political purposes is being assassinated\\". TechCrunch referred to the story as clear evidence of \\"unabashed opposition to security hawks\\". Jewish Telegraph Agency wrote that The Intercepts founder \\"has relentlessly criticized Israel and its political leadership, and at times has invoked tropes of dual loyalty in attacking the pro-Israel community\\". The site also published a podcast titled \\"The case against AIPAC\\". Politico described the website as \\"the loudest voice attacking Democrats from the left\\". Juan M. Thompson scandal In February 2016, the site appended lengthy corrections to five stories by reporter Juan M. Thompson and retracted a sixth, about Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof, written over the previous year, focused on the African-American community. Shortly afterward, a note from editor Betsy Reed indicated that Thompson had been fired recently after his editors discovered \\"a pattern of deception\\" in his reporting. According to Reed, he had \\"fabricated several quotes in his stories and created fake email accounts that he used to impersonate people, one of which was a Gmail account in my name\\". Reed apologized to readers and to those misquoted. She noted that some of Thompson's work, most of it using public sources, was verifiable. Editors alerted any downstream users of the affected stories, and promised to take similar action if further fabrication came to light. Thompson suggested that the greater problem was racism in the media field. He had made up pseudonyms for some of his sources, whom he described as \\"poor black people who didn't want their names in the public given the situations\\" and would not have spoken with a reporter otherwise. \\"[T]he journalism that covers the experiences of poor black folk and the journalism others, such as you and First Look, are used to differs drastically,\\" he argued. He also claimed he had felt a need to \\"exaggerate my personal shit in order to prove my worth\\" at The Intercept given incidents of racial bias he said he had witnessed there. When Gawker published his email, Reed said those allegations had not been in the version he sent her. He was fired by The Intercept in early 2016 and, according to Reed, did not cooperate with the investigation into his actions. Exposure and arrest of a confidential source In early June 2017, The Intercept published a National Security Agency document that asserts Russian intelligence successfully hacked an American voter registration and poll software company, and used information culled to phish state election officials. The document was mailed from a source inside NSA, who did not reveal their identity to Intercept writers. One hour after publication, Reality Winner, a 25-year old NSA contract employee, was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and charged under the Espionage Act of 1917. The article bolstered public suspicion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. It also drew attention for being at odds with views held by editor Glenn Greenwald who had publicly ridiculed or dismissed allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, calling them \\"radical conspiracy theories\\". Greenwald alleged in a Democracy Now! interview that the Democratic party hyperbolized the evidence supporting collusion complaints about Trump, in order to shift the blame for Trump's election as president away from the Democratic Party. The document explains that Russian intelligence attempted to crack the log-in information of the employees of a vendor providing voter registration software and databases for states to use with their election systems. It alleged that the Russians were successful enough that they were able to email 122 election officials, by posing as employees of the vendor. According to David Folkenflik of National Public Radio, \\"[a]n Intercept reporter shared a photo of the papers with a source, a government contractor whom he trusted, seeking to validate it. The printout included a postmark of Augusta, Ga., and microdots, a kind of computerized fingerprint. The contractor told his bosses, who informed the FBI.\\" NSA quickly identified the leaker of the documents. Verifying the legitimacy of leaked documents is common journalism practice, as is protecting third parties who may be harmed incidentally by the leak being published. However, professional media outlets who receive documents or recordings from confidential sources do not, as a practice, share the unfiltered primary evidence with a federal agency for review or verification, as it is known that metadata and unique identifiers may be revealed that were not obvious to the journalist, and the source exposed. According to the FBI, the evidence chain led to the arrest of Winner, a young Air Force veteran who was working in Georgia for Pluribus International Corporation, an NSA contractor, when the document was mailed to The Intercept. The Intercept has been criticized for unprofessional handling of the document, and indifference to the source's safety. Following the arrest of Winner, The Intercept released a statement saying it had \\"no knowledge of the identity of the person who provided us with the document\\". Allegations from the FBI about Winner, it added, were \\"unproven assertions and speculation designed to serve the government's agenda and as such warrant skepticism\\". NSA whistleblower John Kiriakou and Guantanamo Bay detention camp whistleblower Joseph Hickman have both accused the same reporter accused of revealing Winner's identity, Matthew Cole, of playing a role in their exposure, which, in Kiriakou's case, led to his imprisonment. On July 11, 2017, The Intercept announced that its parent company, First Look Media, through its Press Freedom Defense Fund, would provide $50,000 in matching funds to Stand with Reality, a crowd-funding campaign to support Winner's legal defense, plus a separate grant to engage a second law firm to assist Winner's principal attorneys, Augusta-based Bell & Brigham. Additionally, wrote editor-in-chief Betsy Reed, \\"First Look's counsel Baruch Weiss of the firm Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer may support the defense efforts while continuing to represent First Look's interests.\\" On August 23, 2018, at a federal court in Georgia, Winner was sentenced to the agreed-upon five years and three months in prison for violating the Espionage Act. Prosecutors said her sentence was the longest ever imposed in federal court for an unauthorized release of government information to the media. Winner is being held at the Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP)'s Federal Medical Center, Carswell in Fort Worth, Texas, in order to receive treatment for bulimia and be close to her family.

The present castle dates from the 16th century and stands by the Corse Burn, around north-west of Lumphanan. Corse was a property of the Forbes family. In the 16th century the original house on the site was destroyed by bandits in a raid. The laird of the day, Sir William Forbes, is reputed to have said of his projected new castle \\"Please God I will build me such a house as thieves will need to knock at ere they enter.\\"Deborah Howard, Scottish architecture: Reformation to Restoration, 1560-1660 (1995), p. 50 He went on to erect the present castle, which bears his initials, with the date 1581. William Forbes had seven sons, of whom the eldest, Patrick (1564‚Äì1635), was born at the castle before the rebuilding. In 1618 he was appointed Bishop of Aberdeen, serving until his death. The second son, William, a merchant, bought and completed nearby Craigievar Castle in the 1620s. The third son, John Forbes (c.1565‚Äì1634) also entered the church. The sixth son, Arthur, settled in Ireland and was created a baronet.Sprott & MacDonald (2004) Patrick's second son, the theologian John Forbes (1593‚Äì1648), inherited Corse in 1635 and died there in 1648, having opposed the National Covenant and been exiled for three years.Mullan, 2004 The Corse estate then went to John Forbes's son George and then his grandson, but due to a lack of further heirs it reverted to the Forbeses of Craigievar, descended from his brother William.John Bernard Burke, A Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage (1865), p. 449 In 1869 the castle was occupied by James Ochoncar Forbes (1837‚Äî1900), second son of the late Sir John Forbes, 7th Baronet of Craigievar, by his marriage to Charlotte Elizabeth, a daughter of James Ochoncar Forbes, 17th Lord Forbes.\\"FORBES, James Ochoncar, Esq., of Corse\\" in Edward Walford, The County Families of the United Kingdom (1869), p. 370 His older brother, William Forbes-Sempill, 17th Lord Sempill, had inherited Craigievar Castle and a peerage from a cousin. In The Castellated and Domestic Architecture of Scotland (1887), David MacGibbon and Thomas Ross say: The castle thus became redundant in the mid 19th century, when it was replaced by a new house. On the death of James Ochoncar Forbes in 1900, the estate was inherited by his son John Walter Forbes, who died unmarried in 1912, and then by his younger son Lieutenant Colonel James Ochoncar Forbes (1867‚Äî1945), who was a Deputy Lieutenant for Aberdeenshire. His son Lieutenant Colonel Patrick Walter Forbes (1914‚Äî1979) also lived on the estate and likewise became a Deputy Lieutenant.Burke's Peerage, volume 1 (2003), page 1456 Ground floor plan of Corse Castle The castle is described by Historic Scotland as \\"a remarkable survival of the compact 16th century, Scottish Z-plan castle\\", although W. D. Simpson described it as \\"an unusual combination of L and Z plans.\\" It has been designated a scheduled ancient monument.

He served as the fourth Prime Minister of Cambodia from December 1946 to July 1947. He was the first to be elected prime minister.  Biography  Sisowath Youtevong was born in 1913 in Udong, Cambodia, as the son of Prince Chamraengvongs (1870‚Äì1916) and Princess Sisowath Yubhiphan (1877‚Äì1967). He studied at a science university in France and received a certificate of mathematics in 1941. He was also a member of the French Section of the Workers' International, the predecessor to the present- day Socialist Party. He would later go on to be elected as President of the newly founded Democratic Party of Cambodia in April 1946. Youtevong was the principal author of the constitution at that time, which was put to use on 6 May 1947. He led the Democratic Party to victory in the elections on 1 September 1946 and was sworn in as Prime Minister on 15 December 1946.

Centered on the intersection of Cushman Road and Shutesbury Road in the southeastern portion of the rural town, it includes predominantly residential buildings that were built during the height of the area's industrial activity in the first four decades of the 19th century. The architecture is mainly Federal and Greek Revival in style. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. Description and history The town of Leverett was separated from neighboring Sunderland in 1774. The area that is now East Leverett was acquired by Sunderland in 1729 as a \\"Two-Mile Addition\\" to increase the area of its arable land. The village of East Leverett is located in the southeastern part of Leverett, at a point that has had a bridge across Roaring Brook since at least 1794. Cushman Road approaches the bridge from the southwest, joining Still Corner Road, which arrives from the south. Cemetery Road runs eastward south of Cushman Street, eventually intersecting Still Corner Road. On the north side of the bridge, Shutesbury Road runs north and east. Portions of these roads formed a part of a major east-west road joining Sunderland to points in Worcester County to the east. The area upstream from the bridge was a site of small-scale industrial development from late 18th century to the mid-19th century, and contributed to its growth as a center. The area's development began in a substantive way after 1794, when land sales and house construction began to occur on a noticeable scale. The earliest surviving buildings in the district date to this period, with one of the oldest being the Federal style house at 21 Still Corner Rd, built c. 1806 by the Nutting brothers, who also owned some of the mill properties. The house at 173 Shutesbury Road, built c. 1800, may have served in part as a mill structure, as it stands on a property sloping down to Roaring Brook. Development continued through the first half of the 19th century, when a number of Greek Revival houses were built, as was the East Leverett School, built c. 1835 to meet the growing population's needs. In the second half of the 19th century, the inefficiency of the smaller mill operations in the village led to an economic decline. The mill buildings themselves have long been lost, but foundational remnants survive, including mill raceways and other stonework. Because of the economic decline, the population also shrank, and there was relatively little new construction. There is only one surviving house that was built between 1870 and 1910; it is also the district's largest, a Queen Anne Victorian at 167 Shutesbury Road.

He rose to worldwide notice during the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul for his role in detecting Ben Johnson's steroid use. He was later the head of South Korea's Food and Drug Administration (now the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety) under President Kim Dae-jung from March 1998 until January 1999, and founded protein microarray development start-up Lab Frontier in 2002. Early career A graduate of Seoul University's Department of Chemistry, Park moved to the United States for higher studies in 1966, where he attended graduate school at the University of Rochester and did postdoctoral research at Georgetown University before joining the faculty of Johns Hopkins University. He later naturalised as a U.S. citizen and worked for the government of Maryland's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Park moved back to South Korea in 1986, where he served as head of the Korea Institute of Science and Technology's Applied Sciences Division. He resumed his original South Korean citizenship and relinquished U.S. citizenship in 1996 before joining the Food and Drug Administration, as South Korea did not permit dual citizenship at the time. In his capacity at KIST, Park was involved with drug testing at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul as head of the Olympic Doping Control Center. There, he was responsible for the detection of stanozolol in urine and blood samples from Ben Johnson which resulted in the latter being stripped of his gold medal. Park took great care in performing the urinalysis, and even repeated the test procedure from scratch to be entirely sure of his results before reporting the sample to International Olympic Committee officials; he did not find out to whom the sample belonged until days later, as the samples were not labelled by name per standard procedure. ABC World News named him \\"Person of the Week\\" on 30 September 1998 for his role in bringing the scandal to light. He also detected marijuana usage by three athletes, though no action was taken against them as marijuana was not a banned performance-enhancing substance. Park clashed with Olympics officials over other aspects of how he did his job, and made angry comments to the Washington Post about false samples with trace amounts of banned substances which had been planted among genuine samples in his lab. His work at the Olympic Doping Control Center earned him the Scientist of the Year Award by the Korea Science Journalists Association. As head of the Food and Drug Administration Park was appointed head of the Food and Drug Administration in March 1998. His appointment came as a surprise to observers, as he was a scientist in what was typically viewed as a political position. In his new capacity, he conducted a shake-up of the administration, replacing seven long-serving officers and recruiting more than 40 new scientists from South Korea and overseas. Park's disregard for earlier seniority-based promotion procedures elicited opposition from the bureaucracy, and the Chosun Ilbo reported that some disgruntled anti-reformists in the administration had made anonymous denunciations to prosecutors about Park's alleged receipt of bribes, resulting in an investigation of him just months after he was appointed to his new position. In January 1999, Park was arrested on bribery charges, with prosecutors stating that for several years beginning in 1992, a local pharmaceutical company executive had paid him ‚Ç©185 million in bribes for his aid in getting the company's drugs approved. Park's arrest was part of President Kim Dae-jung's crackdown on corruption in the medical industry, and was followed in February by the arrest of Park's director- general of pharmaceutical safety Kim Yon-pan. Park was convicted on the charges and sentenced to three years in prison and five years of probation. He served roughly two years of his sentence, and was released in 2000. Later career In 2002, Park founded Lab Frontier, a biotechnology start-up which collaborated with Ewha Womans University on protein microarray development. He also later became president of the Bio Venture Association. In November 2007, he was arrested on fraud charges relating to alleged falsification of pharmaceuticals trial reports used to get regulatory approval for pharmaceuticals, on the basis of a tip from a paid informant which led to indictments of 22 other researchers.

Origins  The Union of the Baltic Cities was founded in Gda≈Ñsk, Poland in September 1991, by 32 cities, with the aim of developing cooperation and exchange between its member cities. Inspired in part by the historic example of the Hanseatic LeagueLeif Beck Fallesen, \\"Urban Ambassadors\\", The WorldPaper, July 22, 1998 . and supported by the European Union's Interreg programs to stimulate regional cooperation within the EU, it was one of the first formal institutions established to bolster the Baltic as a cohesive region within Europe.

He is also remembered for one of the first major English translations of Ain-i-Akbari, the 16th-century Persian language chronicle of Mughal emperor Akbar, published in 1873. Early life and background Born at Dresden on 8 January 1838, he was the son of Ernest Ehrenfried Blochmann, printer, and nephew of Karl Justus Blochmann. He was educated at the Kreuzschule and the University of Leipzig (1855), where he studied oriental languages under Heinrich Leberecht Fleischer, and then (1857) was in Paris. Career In 1858 Blochmann came to England, intent on visiting India, and enlisted in the British Indian Army in 1858 as a private soldier. Soon after his arrival in Calcutta he was set to do office-work in Fort William, and gave lessons in Persian. After about a year he obtained his army discharge, and for a time entered the service of the Peninsular and Oriental Company as an interpreter. He was befriended by William Nassau Lees, the principal of the Calcutta Madrasa (now Aliah University), and Blochmann obtained, at the age of 22, his first government appointment (1860) as assistant professor of Arabic and Persian there. In 1861 he graduated M.A. and LL.D. at the University of Calcutta, choosing Hebrew for the subject of his examination. In the following year he left the Madrasa to become pro-rector and professor of mathematics, at Doveton College; but returning to the Madrasa in 1865, he remained there for the rest of his life, and was principal when he died. Blochmann made arch√¶ological tours in India and British Burma, but generally resided in Calcutta. In 1868 he became philological secretary to the Asiatic Society of Bengal. He died on 13 July 1878, and was buried in the Circular Road cemetery, Calcutta. Works Blochmann's major work was his translation of the Ain-i-Akbari of Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak; the earlier version of Francis Gladwin was more in the way of a summary. Blochmann did not live to do more than translate the first volume (Calcutta, 1873), and the work was completed by Henry Sullivan Jarrett. Blochmann's notes dealt with the Emperor Akbar and his court, and the administration of the Mughal Empire; and prefixed to the translation was a life of Abul-Fazl. This translation was revised, from 1927, by Douglas Craven Phillott and Jagunath Sarkar. Another significant work was The Prosody of the Persians, Calcutta, 1872. For the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Blochmann wrote in the Journal and Proceedings. These papers included his series of Contributions to the History and Geography of Bengal. Family Blochmann married an Irish woman, who survived him, and left three children.

The statue was commissioned by the city's citizens when the town was raised to the status of a municipal borough in 1899 but the base stood empty until the following year as the result of a strike. Statue Seated on his horse with one of its hoofs raised, Christian IX is positioned gazing over the harbour from the centre of the square. The bronze statue was created by Ludvig Brandstrup (1861‚Äì1935) who designed a similar work which stands in Slagelse.

Jacob in 1981. The first issue was created, using pressed Letraset on paper, as a birthday gift to the artist Steven Durland, and modeled on Durland's satirical mini-magazine Tacit. Each of the first four post-card sized issues of PostHype was printed using an original rubber stamp by Jacob, hand carved from photographs made using the photo-booth machine at the Times Square arcade known as Playland, which recorded the visits of other mail artists to New York City. Later issues expanded to document various mail art projects organized by Jacob. left In 1983, PostHype 2(5) documented Jacob's project \\"The Catalogue of Ideas.\\" Having found a trove of discarded, unmarked bank envelopes in a dumpster, Jacob stamped them with the words \\"Life,\\" \\"Time,\\" \\"Death,\\" and \\"Hunger,\\" wrapped each group of four with a paper band, and asked recipients to transform and return the envelopes to him. \\"Words,\\" Jacob wrote in the invitation to participate, \\"are the translation of ideas, made specific and personal by the specific persons who use them.\\" Recipients were asked to respond to the words \\"in any manner, using the generic form (the small envelopes) as the point of origination.\\" Rather grandiloquently, in the documentation Jacob declared \\"Consider this 'Catalogue of Ideas,'[...] as Lascaux condensed.\\" Eighty-five artists from twenty-six nations returned envelopes to Jacob, a selection of which were reproduced in the periodical along with a complete list of participants enclosed in a bank envelope marked \\"Artists.\\" Included among the usual suspects were Ray Johnson, Richard Kostelanetz, and Carl Andre (who proclaimed the project absurd). In 1984, as a participant in the two-day Artists Talk on Art panels related to the exhibition \\"Mail Art: Then and Now\\" at the Franklin Furnace, New York, Jacob transcribed and published the contentious exchanges between colleagues in Posthype 3(1), \\"Mail Art: A Partial Anatomy.\\" Increasingly interested in issues related to censorship, and working with artists in the Soviet Bloc countries of then Eastern Europe, the final issue of PostHype (4(1)) documented a mail and telephone art project entitled \\"East/West: Mail Art & Censorship.\\" PostHype was discontinued in 1985. A promised new periodical, to be titled Occasional Correspondence, never materialized. In 1987, in a self- proclaimed withdrawal from the mail art community, Jacob self-published The Coffee Table Book of Mail Art: The Intimate Letters of J.P. Jacob. With an advertisement declaring \\"Each copy contains a valuable original artwork by a famous mailartist!!\\" Jacob gave away original works from his mail art collection to all recipients of the publication, until both he and it were exhausted. In an undated article entitled \\"(mis)reading m@ilart,\\" author Matt Ferranto describes PostHype in relation to other mail art zines of the period. \\"The new availability of quick, inexpensive xerographic printing machines,\\" according to Ferranto, \\"coupled with the circulation of thousands of names and addresses in such mail art-oriented publications as DOC(K)S in France, Arte Postale in Italy, and Posthype in the United States led many new mail artists to mass mail printed matter to as many individuals as possible. In a situation reminiscent of the potlatch that so fascinated Bataille, these artists engaged in a competition of giving that introduced rivalry and antagonism into the mail art network. Attempting to gain prestige by demonstrating their ability to absorb great expenditures, they also took a perverse approach towards the idea of gift exchange.[...] Many experienced mail artists complained of an 'explosion of junk mail and self-serving egotism.'\\" Citing Fluxus historian Ken Friedman, Ferranto argues that many such projects were originated by \\"artists unaware of history and community tr[ying] to become the leading figure in the network,\\" whose aggressive actions spoiled their own nest. The paradoxical issue of mail art fame was already noted by Chuck Welch, in 1986, in his book Networking Currents. Indeed, this was one among the many complaints made by Jacob, the editor as petulant chief despoiler, in a series of essays disclosing his gradual alienation from the mail art community. Mail artist and historian G√©za Perneczky, on the other hand, lists PostHype as among the major sources of information pertinent to the mail art activities of the 1980s. A complete run of PostHype, self-published under the imprint of Jacob's Riding Beggar Press, was acquired by the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1987.

Sir Hussey Vivian (shortly to become Lord Swansea) was elected in Tyrdennau and his brother Arthur was elected in Margam. The Earl of Dunraven was elected in Bridgend. The first meeting of the Council was held at the Gwyn Hall in Neath and Sir Hussey Vivian MP elected to the chair. The Liberal group did agree on a list of aldermen beforehand, but they were not as cohesive as in other counties in using a block vote. One of the main debates related to the venue for meetings, with the claims of Neath and Pontypridd being most prominent. The Bridgend Local Board of Health had petitioned Lord Dunraven to lobby for that town to be considered. The matter was resolved for the time being at the first statutory meeting, held at Pontypridd on 1 April where it was decided that the meetings be held alternately at Pontypridd and Neath, with the claims of Cardiff being rejected. At this meeting also, the chairman of the Council, Sir Hussey Vivian, paid tribute to the magistrates for their past conduct of county business. Although not a representative body, he stated, they had conducted their work honourably and he hoped that the Council 'would be able in future to conduct the business of the county in as complete and perfect a manner as it had been conducted hitherto by the magistrates.' The 1890s In contrast to the first Council which included no working men, a number were elected to the second council. Lord Swansea died in 1894. The Liberal group were divided on a successor as chairman of the Council and J. Blandy Jenkins defeated Arthur Pendarves Vivian by 31 votes to 30. He was repeatedly re- elected for the next fifteen years. County Hall, Cardiff The county council considered a number of locations for a single county headquarters, including Bridgend, Llandaff, Merthyr Tydfil, Neath and Pontypridd. Cardiff offered a site in the centre of the city and the county council launched a competition in July 1908 inviting designs for a new building. County Hall was built on Edward VII Avenue, Cathays Park, completed in 1911 and opened in 1912.

II, p. 508. Retrieved 11 February 2014. Early life Frances was the younger daughter of the judge and privy councillor Sir Edward Coke and his second wife Lady Elizabeth Hatton. She was born at Hatton House in London, and baptised on 2 September 1602 in the parish church of St Andrew Holborn.Johanna Luthman, Love, Madness, and Scandal: The Life of Frances Coke Villiers, Viscountess Purbeck (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2017), p. 8. Forced marriage In 1617, her father betrothed Frances (at age fifteen) to Sir John Villiers, 1st Viscount Purbeck, the elder brother of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, the favourite of King James VI and I. The match was an apparent bid by Sir Edward Coke to win back royal favour, following his dismissal as Lord Chief Justice and from the Privy Council. Both Frances and her mother opposed the marriage. Lady Hatton sent Frances away from Hatton House on 10 July, without informing her father. Lady Hatton's plans involved a rented house and her extended family of cousins. She placed her daughter first with Lady Withipole; she was the former Frances Cornwallis, daughter of Sir William Cornwallis of Brome.Vivian Salmon, The Other Elizabeth Drury: a Tragic Marriage in the Family of John Donne's Patron, Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology 29, pp. 198‚Äì207(1963) (PDF), at p. 201 The next step would be a pre-emptive betrothal to Henry de Vere, 18th Earl of Oxford. Sir Edward Coke discovered his daughter Frances, by chance, at a house near Oatlands, rented by Sir Edmond Withipole from the Earl of Argyll, and took her away. By legal means he had her kept at the house of Sir Henry Yelverton, the Attorney-General; and then at the house of Thomas Knyvet, 1st Baron Knyvet, who owned Staines. It was rumoured that Frances was \\"tyed to the Bed-Poste and severely whipped into consent\\".Thomas Longueville, The Curious Case of Lady Purbeck: A Scandal of the XVIIth Century (London, 1909), p. 54. Retrieved 11 February 2014. In September 1617, she was married to Viscount Purbeck at Hampton Court in the presence of the King and Prince Charles. The congregation noticed her crying when they joined hands.HMC Downshire, vol. 6 (London, 1995), pp. 299-300. Aftermath of marriage The marriage was an unhappy one. Viscount Purbeck was said to suffer from bouts of \\"insanity\\" (today believed to have probably been due to bipolar disorder). In 1621 the pair separated. In October 1624, Frances gave birth to a son who was baptised as Robert Wright. Rumours began that the child's father was Sir Robert Howard, a son of the Earl of Suffolk. In January 1625, King James signed a warrant for the trial for adultery of the couple in the ecclesiastical Court of High Commission. However, as her first biographer points out, \\"The prosecution of Lady Purbeck was pretty clearly at the instigation of Buckingham and not of Purbeck.\\"The Curious Case of Lady Purbeck, p. 87. In fact, the Duke seems to have become obsessed with his sister-in-law's behaviour and appears to have accused her not only of adultery but also of witchcraft. In February 1625, he urged the Lord Chief Justice to imprison both her and Sir Robert Howard. Howard was confined in the Fleet Prison and Frances put under house arrest at the home of a London alderman. In March 1625, Howard was publicly excommunicated after he refused to answer to the charge against him and the proceedings were suspended. The trial resumed in November 1627 under Bishop George Montaigne and Frances was convicted of \\"incontinency\\", or adultery. Among her twenty commissioner-judges (only one of whom, Sir Charles Caesar, dissented from the judgment by excusing himself) was the poet John Donne, who was then Dean of St Paul's Cathedral.R. C. Bald, John Donne: A Life (Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1970), pp. 420‚Äì422. Later life and death Frances failed to perform her penance of standing barefoot in a white sheet in church and was again put under house arrest. She escaped by disguising herself as a page-boy and fled from London to France where she lived in exile in Paris for several years with her son. She converted to Roman Catholicism and lodged for a time in a convent although she did not become a nun. In 1640, Frances petitioned the House of Lords for the return of her ¬£10,000 marriage payment which had been appropriated by the Villiers family although she seems to have been unsuccessful.Laura Norsworthy, The Lady of Bleeding Heart Yard: Lady Elizabeth Hatton 1578‚Äì1646 (London, John Murray, 1935), Appendix III, pp. 279‚Äì282. Eventually she returned to England, at the time of the English Civil War, where she died of illness during the second siege of Oxford in May 1645 at the age of 42. She is buried in the University Church of St Mary the Virgin. In literature and art In the dramatist Ben Jonson's masque The Gypsies Metamorphosed (1621), the Second Gypsy addresses Lady Purbeck (who was among the original audience) as follows: > Help me wonder; here's a Book Where I would for ever look; Never yet did > Gypsy trace Smoother lines in Hand or Face; Venus here doth Saturn move That > you should be Queen of Love ‚Ä¶ You shall turn all hearts to tinder, And shall > make the world one cinder.The Works of Ben Jonson, ed. W. Gifford (9 vols, > London, 1816), vol. 7, Masques at Court, p. 390. Retrieved 11 February 2014. During her exile in Paris, Sir Kenelm Digby wrote of her: \\"I have not seen more prudence, sweetnesse, goodnesse, honor and bravery shewed by any woman that I know, than this unfortunate lady sheweth she hath a rich stock of. Besides her natural endowments, doubtless her afflictions add much; or rather have polished, refined and heightened what nature gave her.\\"The Curious Case of Lady Purbeck, p. 141. Arthur Wilson, the early historian of the reign of King James I, wrote in 1653 that she was \\"a Lady of transcending beauty, but accused for wantonness\\".Arthur Wilson, The History of Great Britain, being the Life and Reign of King James the First (London, 1653), p. 147. The first biography of Lady Purbeck was published by an Edwardian gentleman-scholar, Thomas Longueville, in 1909. However, it omits important facts since Longueville was unaware of legal documents in the Public Record Office discovered later by the author Laura Norsworthy and published in her biography of Frances' mother Lady Hatton, The Lady of Bleeding Heart Yard (1935). The well-known British author Antonia Fraser devotes part of a chapter of her The Weaker Vessel (1984) to a modern summary of Frances' life. A new biography by American historian Johanna Luthman, Love, Madness, and Scandal: The Life of Frances Coke Villiers, Viscountess Purbeck, was published by Oxford University Press in 2017. The only known portrait of Lady Purbeck, painted by the Dutch artist Michiel Jansz. van Mierevelt of Delft and dated 1623, is on view to the public as part of the guided stairway tour at Ashdown House, Oxfordshire, a National Trust property.

It is based on the 2005 novel of the same name by Dmitry Safonov.  Plot  In Moscow Metro, in the tunnel's station Park Kultury, built in 1935, is starting to fail. One tunnel night crawler, Sergeitch (Sergey Sosnowski), sees a leak in the tunnel where it runs under the Moscow River and informs the assistant station master (Michael Fateev), who mocks the old man for worrying about it, saying it's only groundwater. Meanwhile, Irina Garina (Svetlana Hodchenkova) is torn between her lover, businessman Vlad Konstantinov (Anatoly Bely), and her husband, surgeon Andrei Garin (Sergei Puskepalis). Konstantinov tries to persuade Irina to divorce Andrei. Arriving from a trip abroad, Irina spends the night with Konstantinov rather than going home. Andrei has to take their daughter Ksenya (Anfisa Wistinghausen) to school but by chance, they take the \\"Garden\\" metro station. Simultaneously, Konstantinov arrives, hurrying to work and forced to park his car because of traffic jams. Meanwhile Sergeitch, drinking with casual acquaintance Galina (Elena Panova) next to the \\"Garden\\", recalls that the water leaking into the tunnel smelled of slime, which means that it can not be groundwater. They are detained by the police for drinking alcohol in a public place but Galina manages to escape, and flees into the subway. In custody Sergeitch asks for a phone to tell the dispatcher everything, but the police turn a deaf ear to his pleas. In the tunnel the water breaches the ceiling. The driver of the train (Konstantin Ovseannicov) that by coincidence contains Garin, Konstantinov and Galina activates the emergency brake. The train derails and crashes into the water and rubble. Some of the passengers are killed. Konstantinov, instead of going along the rails, climbs onto the roof of the car. Crawling along, he sees Garin, who is trying to find Ksjushu in a pile of bodies, and helps Garin. Garin is going to follow the others but Konstantinov stops him, pointing out that the contact rail is still electrified. The water rises, a short circuit occurs, and all who did not escape the flooded area of the tunnel die from shock. Garin, Konstantinov and Galina, courier Michael (Stanislav Duzhkinov) and a couple, Denis (Alex Bardukov) and Alisa (Katerina Shpitsa), finally can seek to escape. All except Michael hurriedly make their way into a passage leading to a maintenance shaft. Michael, being very frightened, refuses to enter the passage and dies when the car rolls over. From the passage the protagonists fall into a small bunker, built during the construction of underground. Above it, the vertical maintenance shaft ends in a sewer grate. However, they cannot reach the grate, which is too high, nor can they use their mobile phones underground. The water level in the tunnel and in the well begins to rise rapidly. Tension between Konstantinov and Garin rises, as the latter cannot understand why Konstantinov feels an interest in his daughter. When the water level raises them to the level of the grate, Garin and Konstantinov manage to phone Irina but only have time to tell her that they are in the bunker. They try to attract attention through the bars, but to no avail. Irina is hysterically trying to inform the rescue team that people are in the bunker. But at this time the pressure of the water rips off the train head and the water level in the shaft falls sharply, pulling the characters back into the tunnel. The rescuers descend into the bunker, but seeing the wet walls, assume that all who were there most likely drowned. The protagonists get to the ghost station \\"Borodino\\" (close to the \\"Garden\\") and climb onto the platform to rest. Garin makes some indirect hints to Konstantinov that show that he realizes that Konstantinov and Irina are lovers. Konstantinov and Garin fight and Konstantinov nearly drowns in the water. In the tunnel where the train is stuck the overhead arch collapses and waters fill the tunnel. The leaders of the rescue operation manage to shut off the water. The protagonists get to the bunker and finally get out through the bars on the street. Alisa and Dennis together leave the hospital. Garin and Irina tensely meet in a scene where Garin silently deflects all her pleas. The film ends with a scene where Konstantinov is driving around in different directions following the ambulance containing Garin.

The Australian Workers Union, Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, Electrical Trades Union, Health Services Union and the Transport Workers Union were named in the terms of reference. The Royal Commission inquired into the activities relating to slush funds and other similar funds and entities established by, or related to, the affairs of these organisations. The Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced the Royal Commission on 10 February 2014 and nominated that the Commission be overseen by a sole Royal Commissioner, The Honourable Dyson Heydon, , a former High Court judge. Letters Patent were issued on 13 March 2014. The Commissioner submitted an Interim Report in December 2014, which found cases of \\"wilful defiance of the law\\" and recommended criminal charges against certain unionists. Allegations of illegality against nine unions had been uncovered, with over 50 potential breaches of criminal and civil law identified. Following an extension, the Commissioner presented his final report to the Governor-General in December 2015, finding \\"widespread and deep-seated\\" misconduct by union officials in Australia. More than 40 people and organisations were referred to authorities, including police, Directors of Public Prosecutions, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Fair Work Commission, and a recommendation for the establishment of an independent body to investigate union records and finances was made. As of March 2016, only one conviction has been attained, while five other union officials have either had their charges dropped, or were found not guilty. Establishment of the Commission=Background In 2013 the Fair Work Commission commenced initial inquiries into allegations of improper union financial conduct, and the Opposition Liberal-National Coalition promised a judicial inquiry into the AWU affair, which involved allegations of misappropriation of funds by officials of the Australian Workers Union. Craig Thomson, a Federal Labor MP, and Michael Williamson, a former President of the Labor Party, were facing fraud allegations in relation to their financial dealings as officials of the Health Services Union (both men were later convicted of fraud). In December 2013, the Fairfax press reported that the newly elected Abbott Government would call a Royal Commission into trade union slush funds, \\"less than a fortnight after a Fairfax Media investigation uncovered millions of dollars in a string of secret union slush funds. The series of Fairfax reports revealed the involvement of the NSW Right‚Äôs powerful Transport Workers Union in a $500,000 takeover of its own Queensland branch with the backing of the disgraced former HSU leader Michael Williamson. It also reported the possible unlawful misuse of union and parliamentary staff by senior union officials and Labor figures.\\" Letters Patent The Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption was established on 13 March 2014 by the former Governor-General, Dame Quentin Bryce. The Governor-General issued Letters Patent which formally appointed the Royal Commissioner, John Dyson Heydon, and outlined the Terms of Reference for the inquiry. The Letters Patent called for an investigation and recommendations with particular regard for the financial management of relevant entities and the adequacy of existing laws relating to the financial management of those entities and the accountability of their officers. It was also to investigate whether relevant entities are used for unlawful purpose; as well as the use of funds solicited in the name relevant entities. The Australian Workers Union; Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union; Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia; the Health Services Union; and the Transport Workers Union were nominated for investigation, but the Letters Patent permitted other entities facing \\"credible allegations\\" to be investigated. On 30 October 2014, Governor-General Cosgrove amended the Letters Patent to include an additional term of reference, and the reporting date was revised from 31 December 2014 to 31 December 2015. Dyson Heydon told the Royal Commission in April, 2015, that \\"A reading of the Interim Report will reveal that the progress of the Commission's investigations in 2014 was impeded by false testimony, delays in document production, document destruction or removal and reluctance to cooperate even on the part of persons hostile to alleged misconduct\\" and said that some witnesses feared for their safety. Commissioner Heydon Justice Dyson Heydon served as a judge of the NSW Court of Appeal from 2000, and was appointed as a judge of the High Court of Australia in February 2003. He was appointed a Companion in the General Division of the Order of Australia in 2004. Justice Heydon is a former Rhodes Scholar, and holds a Master of Arts and Bachelor of Civil Law from Oxford University. He was admitted to the New South Wales Bar in 1973 and appointed Queen's Counsel in 1987. Aged 34, he was elected dean of the University of Sydney Law School and practised at the Bar from 1979 until his appointment to the Court of Appeal. Heydon has written a number of legal texts, including Cross on Evidence and The Restraint of Trade Doctrine (1971). =Bill Shorten appearance= In July 2015, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten of the Australian Labor Party, a former official of the AWU, was called to give evidence at the Royal Commission. Over two days of questioning, Counsel Assisting asked Shorten several times if he had had a conflict of interest in accepting, and not disclosing, large donations from employers while negotiating for the union on behalf of employees. Shorten said there was no conflict of interest. Shorten admitted to the commission that he had failed to declare a political donation of around $40,000 from a labour hire company in the lead up to the 2007 election campaign, and that invoices regarding the payments for services were not truthful. Shorten denied knowledge of alleged false invoicing, totalling more than $300,000, which had been sent to construction company Thiess John Holland. During cross examination, Counsel Assisting said that Shorten was being \\"evasive\\". Heydon intervened to tell Shorten that some of his answers were \\"non-responsive\\", adding \\"If I can be frank about it, you have been criticised in the newspapers in the last few weeks and I think it‚Äôs generally believed that you have come here in the hope you will be able to rebut that criticism or a lot of it. I‚Äôm not very troubled about that, though I can understand that you are, and it‚Äôs legitimate for you to use this occasion to achieve your ends in that regard. What I‚Äôm concerned about more is your credibility as a witness ‚Ä¶ and perhaps your self-interest as a witness as well. It is in your interest to curb these, to some extent, extraneous answers.\\" Following the hearing, Labor frontbencher Brendan O'Connor, brother of CFMEU national secretary Michael O'Connor, criticised Heydon's comments as \\"a remarkable interjection\\" and called the commission \\"a witch hunt.\\" =Recusal application= During his term as Royal Commissioner, Heydon was invited to deliver the 6th Sir Garfield Barwick Address, a fundraising event organised by a Lawyers Branch and the Legal Policy Branch of the Liberal Party,https://media.crikey.com.au/wp- content/uploads/2015/08/heydon1.png on the assumption that the commission would have completed its inquiries. Heydon confirmed his availability to give the address. The Abbott government extended the term of the Royal Commission in October 2014, and when Heydon was reminded of the address in March 2015, he confirmed his ongoing interest. Heydon later declared that he had \\"overlooked\\" the fact that the event was organised by the Liberal Party, and that he had been asked to give the address only if the Royal Commission had finished. Heydon said \\"I overlooked the connection between the person or persons organising the event and the Liberal Party which had been stated in the email of 10 April of 2014,\\" and said \\"I also overlooked the fact my agreement to speak at that time had been conditional on the work of the commission being completed before that time.\\" On 14 April 2015, the NSW Bar Association announced that Heydon would deliver the 6th Annual Sir Garfield Barwick Address. Heydon was sent information about the event on 12 June 2015, with attachments declaring the event a Liberal Party fundraiser. Heydon stated that he did not read the attachments. It was later agreed that the Liberal Party would not be mentioned on advertisements in public Bar Association publications. On 13 August, journalists obtained flyers for the event, announcing that it was a Liberal Party fundraiser. Heydon's assistant confirmed on 13 August at 9:23 am that Heydon would attend, saying \\"He does not wish to answer any questions after his address. If there is any possibility that the event could be described as a Liberal Party event he will be unable to give the address, at least whilst he is in the position of the Royal Commissioner.\\" Fairfax Media reported that they contacted the commissioner's office at 9:35 am. A spokesman for Heydon said that he made a decision not to attend the fundraiser, but this was before being contacted by the media about the Liberal Party flyers. Heydon adjourned the royal commission when the invitation came to public light, saying \\"Another problem has arisen that I need to attend to.\\" There were calls later that day from Labor parliamentarians for Heydon to withdraw from the Royal Commissioner role on the ground of an appearance of bias, reiterating earlier allegations of the political intent of the commission, while Prime Minister Tony Abbott defended Heydon's role and the justification for the Royal Commission. Abbott said that \\"Someone who knows [Heydon] very well and who's no great friend of this government Julian Burnside QC, has said this morning that he's a man of honour\\". Burnside said: \\"Heydon is an honourable man. I give him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he is honourable enough to step down.\\" On 17 August 2015, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that Heydon was on the panel that awarded Tony Abbott his Rhodes scholarship. On 19 August, it was reported that Heydon had said in a June 2013 panel discussion at the Centre for Independent Studies that Kevin Rudd's government had a tendency to \\"do non- substantive things\\". Former Labor Minister Graham Richardson wrote in The Australian that the comments were \\"partisan\\". In a press release, the Law Council criticised public attacks on Heydon, stating: \\"The public attacks on the commissioner being played out through the media are unacceptable and damage the basis on which tribunals and courts operate... In this case, Mr John Dyson Heydon AC QC is a highly regarded former judicial officer.\\" On 21 August, the ACTU, AWU and CFMEU all made applications in the Commission for Heydon to step down on the ground of \\"apprehended bias\\". On 31 August, Heydon dismissed the applications for him to stand down, publishing his reasons on the royal commission's website. In a 209-paragraph ruling, Heydon rejected all of the contentions in detail. As to the suggestion that anything in his acceptance of the invitation to deliver the Sir Garfield Barwick Lecture gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias, he said (para. 87): \\"The mere fact that a person agrees to deliver a speech at a particular forum does not rationally establish that the person is sympathetic to, or endorses the views of, the organiser of that forum.\\" Counsel assisting Senior counsel assisting the commission are: Jeremy Stoljar SC, whose areas of practice include commercial law, corporations law (including corporate governance), property and building and construction; Sarah McNaughton SC, whose areas of practice include criminal law (including complex tax fraud and corporate fraud), disciplinary proceedings and inquests. Other counsel assisting the commission are: Richard Scruby, who practices in a variety of jurisdictions, with the main areas of practice including equity and commercial law, corporations law, mining law and building and construction; Michael Elliott, whose practice areas include commercial, corporate officers' duties and liabilities, building and construction, insurance and professional negligence and has appeared as counsel at various commissions; and Thomas Prince, who was admitted to the New South Wales Bar in 2012. Powers The powers of Royal Commissions in Australia are set out in the enabling legislation, the . Royal Commissions, appointed pursuant to the Royal Commissions Act or otherwise, have powers to issue a summons to a person to appear before the Commission at a hearing to give evidence or to produce documents specified in the summons; require witnesses to take an oath or give an affirmation; and require a person to deliver documents to the Commission at a specified place and time. A person served with a summons or a notice to produce documents must comply with that requirement, or face prosecution for an offence. The penalty for conviction upon such an offence is a fine of or six months imprisonment. A Royal Commission may authorise the Australian Federal Police to execute search warrants. Procedures and methods=Hearings Commissioner Heydon heard opening statements at the Royal Commission on 7 July 2014. By year's end, the Trade Union Royal Commission held more than 70 public and private hearings, which involved 239 witnesses. The hearings were conducted in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Brisbane. 687 Notices to Produce and releasing Issues Papers on governance and protections were issued. The Royal Commission continues its Public Hearings in 2015. Reports ; Interim Report Commissioner Heydon handed his Interim Report to Governor General Sir Peter Cosgrove on 15 December, and it was tabled in Parliament on 19 December 2014. Commissioner Heydon's 1817 page Report found that the Construction Union acts in \\"wilful defiance of the law\\", and he recommended criminal charges of blackmail be considered against John Setka, the state secretary of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU), along with his assistant Shaun Reardon and a number of other senior CFMEU officials. Activities cited by CFMEU officials included death threats, extortion, gross neglect, and other \\"serious criminal matters\\". Upon release of the Interim Report, The Age reported that: \\"Justice Heydon identified key concerns about the use and operation of union election slush funds. They include that they operate largely in secret, have deficient or non-existent record-keeping and that candidates commonly plead ignorance on how money is raised and spent. The report also recommended fraud charges be considered against former Australian Workers Union officials Bruce Wilson and Ralph Blewitt for their use of a secret slush fund in the 1990s. Mr Wilson was the ex-boyfriend of former prime minister Julia Gillard. Justice Heydon said there were no grounds for prosecuting Ms Gillard, but agreed with counsel assisting Jeremy Stoljar's submission, that her conduct as a solicitor had been \\"questionable\\". Ms Gillard had done legal work setting up the slush fund for Mr Wilson and Mr Blewitt. The report recommended seven past and present Health Services Union officials should be considered for charges for their role in an alleged right of entry scam... . Results of hearings and recommendations In August 2015, The Australian reported that 30 individuals had been referred to 11 agencies for possible charges, and that 11 people had been referred to Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and ten people to state DPPs. Four arrests had already been made by police, and allegations of illegality against nine unions had been uncovered, with over 50 potential breaches of criminal and civil law identified. Following July/August 2015 hearings in Canberra, it was reported that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) began investigating allegations emerging from the Royal Commission that union actions resulted in price fixing in the concrete and formwork trades. The media reported that \\"Allegations of intimidation, blackmail, standover tactics and threats\\" were uncovered and two arrests of union officials for alleged blackmail offences were made following their testimony. As of March 2016, only one conviction has been attained, while five other union officials have either had their charges dropped, or were found not guilty. Final Report Commissioner Heydon found that corruption was widespread and deep-seated, and recommended a new national regulator with the same powers as the Australian Securities and Investments Commission be established to combat corruption in the trade union movement. The Report highlighted insufficient record keeping (including false invoicing and destruction of documents); \\"rubber stamp\\" committees which failed to enforce rules; payment of large sums by employers to unions; and influence peddling by means of the inflation of union membership figures. The Report recommended a toughening of financial disclosure rules, new civil penalties to bind workers and officials on financial disclosure provisions; a new criminal offence. Frank Bongiorno, Professor of History at the Australian National University, has described this report as having \\"all the impact of last year‚Äôs telephone book being dumped in a wheelie-bin.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Terms of Reference Trade union governance and corruption Category:2014 establishments in Australia Category:Corruption in Australia Trade union governance and corruption Category:Australian labour movement Category:2015 disestablishments in Australia ","title":"Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption"},{"id":"41899031","text":"Cristian Raducanu (born Cristian RƒÉducanu, names now also spelled Christian and Radacanu; born 2 September 1967) is a retired international rugby union player who represented Romania before his defection to the United Kingdom in 1989. He started seven international matches for the Romanian national team as well as being a replacement in four other of their internationals. Raducanu was described by Bill McLaren as a \\"world-class lineout exponent\\".  Early life and Romanian career  Cristian Raducanu was born on 2 October 1967 in Bucharest, Romania. He grew to be tall, weighing , and played rugby as a and Number 8. He played club rugby for Dynamo Bucharest and at his international debut for Romania on 7 December 1985 against Italy at L'Aquila, he became the youngest player ever to have played for the country. He was one of the youngest players to have started a match in the Rugby World Cup, competing at Number 8 against Zimbabwe at the age of 19 years 233 days in Auckland on 23 May 1987. , he still held the record as the youngest Number 8 to have started a Rugby World Cup match. His last international was in the 32-0 defeat to Scotland at Murrayfield Stadium, Edinburgh on 9 December 1989, at the tail-end of a brief shining for Romanian rugby. He later said that  Defection  Raducanu defected from Romania at the age of 22 while in Edinburgh, on the same day he played his last international. He says that he made a \\"spur-of- the-moment\\" decision, asking a passing policeman for political asylum after dodging team security to walk out of a post-match banquet. The policeman thought that he was drunk. His move came soon after that of his compatriot Nadia ComƒÉneci, and less than a fortnight before the overthrow of Nicolae Ceau»ôescu in his home country. He soon obtained his release from the Romanian Rugby Federation (RRF), allowing him to play in competitions organised by the Scottish Rugby Union. RRF officials also announced around that time that they would not object to him playing again for his country, while Raducanu had lined up an opportunity to play for the Scottish Boroughmuir club. Later accounts of Raducanu's defection suggested a more sensational sequence of events, for which the Glasgow Herald journalist Alaisdair Reid provided an analogy According to these accounts, Raducanu's father was possibly a high- ranking member of the Romanian military who was aware of the imminent revolution and concerned about his son's safety in any turmoil that might result. He advised his son, then employed as a fire-fighter, to take advantage of the trip to Scotland. The accounts claim that British security services were aware of this plan. Rather than leaving the party at the banquet, the accounts say that the players of both countries had moved from there to the Tron Tavern, a nearby bar that was run by Norrie Rowan, himself then a Scottish international and Boroughmuir player. This was a customary change of venue and it was from the bar that Raducanu sought to evade members of the Securitate, who were guarding the entrances and exits. The bar was connected to the Edinburgh Vaults and with Rowan's assistance Raducanu was able to surface on the streets several hundred yards away from the premises and then find a policeman. Some of Raducanu's fellow players certainly did die during the revolution, including Florica Murariu and Radu Durbac.  Career in Britain  Advised by the Refugee Council, Raducanu initially kept a low profile in Scotland and was upset by reports that he had abandoned his wife and baby daughter in Romania, making it known that he was telephoning them daily. Rowan gave him work on a construction site, and he made his Boroughmuir debut on 20 January 1990, although it was unclear at that point whether he intended to stay in Scotland on a permanent basis. His wife and daughter were able to escape Romania soon after. Raducanu later played rugby in England. He made four 1st XV appearances for Leeds in the 1998-1999 season and also played for Bradford & Bingley and Sale before moving to Sedgley Park in Manchester, where he was captain and held a club record, scoring tries in six consecutive matches. He also played in the County Championship-winning Yorkshire team. He wound down his career from around the age of 35 after having had at least 14 operations on a troublesome knee, although he was still playing occasionally for Sedgley's 1st XV and for their 2nd XV as a 40-year-old in 2007. The Scotsman described him in 2002 as being \\"known universally as one of the most amiable and popular men in the sport\\".  Later life  Since 1996, Raducanu has owned a business importing, manufacturing and selling solid-wood furniture. That business involves dealings with his homeland and, in 2007, he worked with Whitgift School and the Romanian Embassy in London to arrange a scholarship for a promising young rugby player from his home country.

Biography Takashi Niigaki was born in Tokyo. He is a Japanese composer and music teacher who served as the orchestrator and ghostwriter for Mamoru Samuragochi for 18 years, composing musical works that included the soundtracks for Resident Evil: Director's Cut Dual Shock Ver. and Onimusha: Warlords. He also composed \\"Hiroshima Symphony No 1\\", previously credited to Samuragochi until February 2014, when Niigaki publicly revealed that he was the real composer. Ghostwriting On 5 February 2014, Niigaki publicly revealed that he was the ghostwriter behind most of the music previously attributed to Mamoru Samuragochi since 1996. Niigaki went to the press because one of Samuragochi's claimed compositions would be used by Japanese figure skater Daisuke Takahashi, at the then upcoming 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Hiroshima Symphony No. 1 was an adaption of little-known works from earlier composers including Gustav Mahler, as observed by the composer Takeo Noguchi when it was performed on tour by a full orchestra; doubting Samuragochi's claims- sourced entirely by his record label- Noguchi wrote an article on the subject, which was turned down by musical publications sponsored by Samuragochi's record label. The article was instead published in the November 2013 issue of the newsweekly Shincho 45, as ; after the ghostwriting was revealed, Noguchi's article was awarded the Editors' Choice Magazine Journalism Award. Classical music critics have stated- albeit 'mainly in hindsight' and as part of the 'musings and self-chastisements in Japan and overseas' that occurred following the revelation of Samuragochi's deceit- that the music is 'subpar, weak imitations of Mahler and Brahms, and shouldn't have been celebrated in the first place' and 'basically an amateurish Mahler pastiche'. Subsequent career In the wake of the scandal, Niigaki received support from friends in the music world, including composer Kenichi Nishizawa, who organized a petition to ask the institution at which Niigaki taught to be lenient; nevertheless Niigaki elected to resign his position. A concert, 'Takashi Niigaki Collection with Friends' took place on 7 June 2014, organized by his supporters. He subsequently appeared on television, cultivating 'a reputation as a comical character on top of being recognized for his musical talent'. In February 2015, Shigeru Kudo, leader of the Higashihiroshima Symphony Orchestra, in 2013, the first amateur ensemble to perform the Hiroshima Symphony, commissioned Niigaki to compose a new symphony. On 15 August 2016, Niigaki's Symphony No. 2, 'Litany', was performed for the first time, at Hiroshima. Niigaki also gave a solo performance of his piano concerto, 'Shinsei' ('New Birth'). The second performance was at Tokyo on 23 August 2016. In producing this symphony, Niigaki was inspired by 'a form of prayer in Christianity... a back and forth between clergy and congregation', this giving the work its name. In 2018, he formed the band Genie High with Enon Kawatani, Ikumi Nakajima, television personality Kunihiro \\"Kukki!\\" Kawashima and comedian Kazutoyo Koyabu. Works The works below were formerly credited to Mamoru Samuragochi, but were later identified as having been composed by Niigaki. * No. 1 symphony \\"Hiroshima\\" (2003) * Sonatina for Violin Completed in 2003, \\"Hiroshima\\" was first played at a concert held to commemorate the meeting of the Group of Eight leaders in Hiroshima in 2008.

Life=Early life She was the daughter of the Brazilian diplomat and noble Domingos Borges de Barros, visconde de Pedra Branca, and Maria do Carmo Gouveia Portugal. She spent her upbringing divided between France and Brazil. She married the Brazilian count Eug√®ne de Barral. Life at court After her wedding, she was introduced to the Imperial Brazilian court and became the lady-in-waiting of Princess Francisca of Brazil. She was given this task after the empress dowager Am√©lie of Leuchtenberg declined to take responsibility for her stepdaughters. In 1855, after the wedding of the emperor to Teresa Cristina of the Two Sicilies, she was appointed lady-in-waiting to the empress. She was described as a dominant and forceful personality, who became one of the leading figures of Brazilian court life. Although she was a liberal, she was also a fervent Catholic of an intellectual nature and gathered a circle of intellectuals and artists around her. Her intellectual qualities made her liked by the emperor, who saw these same qualities in the stepmother he was devoted to, and he became one of her intimate friends and enjoyed the atmosphere in her circle of artistic friends. The relationship between the Countess of Barral and Pedro II of Brazil has been assumed to be sexual, even among many of their contemporaries, and their relationship allegedly caused discord between her and the empress. However, there is no confirmation that their relationship was physical.

This program proposed, in addition to the expansion at Naval Air Station and Lakehurst, the construction of new stations. The original contract was for steel hangars, long, wide and high, helium storage and service, barracks for 228 men, a power plant, landing mat, and a mobile mooring mast. The Second Deficiency Appropriation Bill for 1941 passed in July 1941, changing the authorization to the construction of eight facilities to accommodate a total of 48 airships (as requested in 1940). Some of these new hangars were built at Lakehurst, Moffett, Weymouth and Weeksville; bases which already had metal hangars. Airship expansion At the time of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 which brought the United States into World War II, the US had 10 nonrigid airships: *Combat & Patrol Ships ** 2 TC-class blimps: older patrol ships built in 1933 for the US Army's airship operations. The US Navy had acquired TC-13 and TC-14 from the United States Army in 1938. ** 4 K-class blimps: K-2, K-3, K-4 and K-5 designed as patrol ships and built from 1938. *Training Ships''' ** 3 L-class blimps: L-1, L-2 and L-3, produced as small training ships from 1938. ** 1 G-class blimp: built in 1936 for training. The TC and K class blimps were quickly pressed into service against Japanese and German submarines which were then sinking American shipping within visual range of the American coast. On 2 January 1942 the US Navy formed the ZP-12 patrol unit based in Lakehurst from the four K airships. A month later, the ZP-32 patrol unit was formed at Naval Air Station Moffett Field in Sunnyvale, California from two TC and two L airships. An airship training base was also created at Moffett Field. The US Navy command, remembering the airship anti-submarine success from World War I, immediately requested new modern anti-submarine airships. Plans for standardized wooden hangars were drawn up by the Navy Department Bureau of Yards and Docks with Arsham Amirikian acting as principal engineer. These were long, wide and high. Seventeen of these wooden hangars were completed by the Navy Department Bureau of Yards and Docks in 1943.

During the war some 532 ships without airship escort were sunk near the US coast by enemy submarines. However; only one ship, the tanker Persephone, of the 89,000 ships or so protected in convoys escorted by blimps was sunk by the enemy.Vaeth, J. Gordon, Blimps & U-Boats, Annapolis, Maryland US Naval Institute Press, 1992, pp. 20‚Äì21, Airships engaged submarines with depth charges and, less frequently, with other on-board weapons. Airships were excellent at driving submarines down, where their limited speed and range prevented them from attacking convoys. The weapons available to airships were so limited that until the advent of the homing torpedo they had little chance of sinking a submarine.Vaeth, J. Gordon, Blimps & U-Boats, Annapolis, Maryland, US Naval Institute Press, 1992, Only one airship, a K-class airship from ZP-21, was destroyed by U-boat. On the night of 18/19 July 1943 K-74 was patrolling the coastline near Florida. Using radar, the airship located a surfaced German submarine. K-74 made her attack run but the U-boat opened fire first. K-74s depth charges did not release as she crossed the U-boat and K-74 received serious damage, losing gas pressure and an engine but landing in the water without loss of life. The crew was rescued by patrol boats in the morning, but one crewman, Aviation Machinist's Mate Second Class Isadore Stessel, died from a shark attack.

Kearney was born on 27 June 1874 in Cincinnati, Ohio. He enrolled in the University of Tennessee in 1889, and began working for the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1894, where he would work for the next 50 years. Kearney published a revision of North American Calamagrostis in 1898, describing 23 new species or varieties. From 1898 to 1900 Kearney participated in the Harriman Alaska Expedition. In the early 1900s Kearney traveled throughout North Africa to study crops such as dates and cotton in arid and alkali soils, and began a decades-long period of cotton-breeding research in Arizona. Kearney served as President of the Botanical Society of Washington in 1917. From 1920 to 1944 he also studied the taxonomy and distributions of plants of Arizona. A major collaborator during this period was Robert Hibbs Peebles, Kearney's junior colleague at the Department, with whom Kearney published many papers on cotton genetics and plant taxonomy. The contributions of Kearney and Peebles to the science of cotton growing have been recognized as \\"among the most outstanding of all time.\\" The rare, endangered Arizona plant Amsonia kearneyana (commonly known as Kearney's bluestar), was named after Kearney in 1928. The genus Kearnemalvastrum (Malvaceae), containing two species in Latin America, was posthumously named in honor of Kearney. Kearney retired from the Department of Agriculture in 1944, after which he moved to San Francisco, California, and became a research associate at the California Academy of Sciences, where he continued his taxonomic studies and collaborations with Peebles.

Hangar One (built 1931/2) is based on a structure of steel girders, while Hangars Two and Three (built 1941/2) are of wood. They are among the world's largest freestanding structures.  Hangar One  Hangar One was originally built in the 1930s to house US Navy rigid airships, the USS Macon (ZRS-5) in particular. It is tall and covers .  Hangars Two and Three  Moffett Field's Hangars Two and Three were built at the beginning of World War II for a program of coastal defense. They are still among the world's largest freestanding unsupported wood structures.  1940  In 1940, the US Navy proposed to the US Congress the development of a lighter-than-air station program for anti-submarine patrolling of the coast and harbours. This program proposed the construction of new stations in addition to the expansion at Naval Air Stations (NAS) M and Lakehurst. The original contract was for steel hangars rather than wooden ones, long, wide and high. Included at each site were helium storage and service, barracks for 228 men, power plant, landing apron, and a mobile mooring mast. Wooden hangars= 1941  The Second Deficiency Appropriation Bill for 1941, passed on 3 July 1941, introduced strict control of strategic materials like steel causing a change in construction material to wood. Standardized plans were drawn up by the Navy Department Bureau of Yards and Docks, with Arsham Amirikian acting as principal engineer.  1942  Hangars Two and Three at Moffett Field are long, wide and high, with an extruded parabolic form that reflected the profile of the airship vessels to be accommodated. A total of 51 Douglas Fir heavy-timber trusses resting on concrete bent frames contain the two-story shop and office areas. Two concrete and wood post and lintel structures support high multi-track rolling doors at either end.  1943  A total of 17 wooden hangars were commissioned by the Navy Department Bureau of Yards and Docks in 1943, including those at Naval Air Station Lakehurst (2), Naval Air Station Moffett Field (2), Naval Air Station South Weymouth (1), Naval Air Station Weeksville (1), Naval Air Station Glynco (2), Naval Lighter Than Air Station Richmond (3), Naval Air Station Houma (1), Naval Air Station Hitchcock (1), Naval Lighter-Than-Air Station Santa Ana (2) and Naval Air Station Tillamook (2), with each hangar accommodating six airships.  Present day  Seven of the original seventeen wooden hangars still exist in the U.S.: Moffett Field (2), Tustin, California (2), Tillamook, Oregon (1), and Lakehurst, New Jersey(2). These hangars have a monumental presence, and the Moffett Field pair, set within a paved expanse of the airfield, are a familiar landmark in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Popular culture  An episode of the Discovery Channel TV show MythBusters used one these hangars to disprove the myth that it is not possible to fold a sheet of paper in half more than seven times. The sheet of paper covered nearly the full width of the airship hangar. Other episodes of Mythbusters have utilized the hangar to test myths such as \\"Inflating a football with helium allows longer kick distances\\" and \\"Airworthy aircraft can be constructed of concrete.\\"  References  Category:Aircraft hangars in the United States Category:Buildings and structures in Mountain View, California Category:Military facilities in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Buildings of the United States Navy Category:Transportation buildings and structures in Santa Clara County, California Category:Moffett Field ","title":"Moffett Field airship hangars"},{"id":"41899464","text":"Zharkhan () is the name of several rural localities in the Sakha Republic, Russia. *Zharkhan, Nyurbinsky District, Sakha Republic, a selo in Zharkhansky Rural Okrug of Nyurbinsky District *Zharkhan, Olyokminsky District, Sakha Republic, a selo in Zharkhansky Rural Okrug of Olyokminsky District See also *Arylakh (Zharkhan), a selo in Zharkhansky Rural Okrug of Suntarsky District of the Sakha Republic ","title":"Zharkhan"},{"id":"41899482","text":"Rubin () is a Serbian alcoholic beverages company headquartered in Kru≈°evac.

She wrote and illustrated several books of wild flowers and became internationally recognised for her botanical art. She continued painting and publishing until she was over a hundred years old, becoming recognised as the oldest working artist in Britain. Early life Mary Margaret McMurtrie (n√©e Mitchell), daughter of George and Jeannie Mitchell, was born in Skene in rural Aberdeenshire where her father was the headmaster of the local school. She was educated at Albyn School for Girls in Aberdeen. From early childhood she sketched animals in the fields near her home. She proved herself adept at art so she went to Gray's School of Art where she was one of the first female students. She came first in her year when she graduated and so would have won the prize of a study visit to Italy. However, because this was not considered appropriate for a girl (who it was assumed would only go on to become a housewife), the prize was instead awarded to the boy who came second. She then took a course at the College of Domestic Science in Aberdeen. Horticulture She married Rev John McMurtrie (son of Rev John McMurtrie and grandson of Very Rev John McMurtrie), the minister of Skene, in 1924 and the couple had four children. In her book Where the Apple Ripens, Jessie Kesson recalled her childhood memory of the exotic Himalayan cowslips in the McMurtries' manse garden at the time when they befriended the girl from the nearby orphanage. McMurtrie's husband died in 1949 and so she had to bring up her two youngest children on her own. As well as painting flowers, she had a love of horticulture so she moved from Skene to Aberdeen to set up a horticultural nursery in her garden where it became a thriving business. She wrote the description of Skene parish in the Third Statistical Account of Scotland and published articles of local interest in the Scots Magazine and the Deeside Field. In 1960 she bought 16th-century Balbithan House near Kintore, Aberdeenshire, a country mansion which she completely restored. She transformed the gardens there into a leading North East Scotland nursery, specialising in alpines, rock plants and old garden flowers. In particular, she cultivated roses, violas, pinks, primulas and other native wild flowers. She, along with such gardeners as Margery Fish and Gladys Emma Peto, were the only people who kept some old varieties of garden flowers. Botanical art With her detailed knowledge of wild flowers she developed her watercolour flower painting beyond a hobby. She always painted directly from life. She did a lot of painting when holidaying in the Algarve, and in Kenya where her daughter lived. McMurtrie exhibited her paintings in local art galleries and eventually became internationally recognised as one of Britain's leading botanical painters. The University of Lisbon commissioned her to illustrate The Flowers of the Algarve, a series of six booklets published between 1973 and 1998. At the request of the author, she painted the illustrations for Roy Genders' 1975 book Growing Old-fashioned Flowers. McMurtrie retired from running the nursery and moved back to Aberdeen where she did the illustrations and text for her first book of flowers, Wild Flowers of Scotland, published when she was 80. Scots Roses of Hedgerows and Wild Gardens was published in 1998 and Scottish Wild Flowers in 2001. reproducing Mary McMurtrie completed the illustrations for Old Cottage Pinks shortly before her death on 1 November 2003 at the age of 101. She had continued to paint until the last few weeks of her life and had just completed proof reading her latest book. Peter McEwan, author of the Dictionary of Scottish Art, said \\"She was one of the outstanding - and possibly the outstanding - botanical flower painters in Scotland of her era. She had exhibitions of her work in France, in Portugal, in Kenya, at the Royal Horticultural Society in London, and, of course, here in Scotland\\". The UK charity for the elderly Counsel and Care had recognised her as the oldest active artist in Britain.

His first prospectus, issued in 1825, failed, but a new committee established in February 1830, including Andrew Spottiswoode, MP for Saltash, sculptor Robert William Sievier, banker Sir John Dean Paul, Charles Broughton Bowman (first committee secretary),Kensal Green Founders Accessed 10 February 2014 and architects Thomas Willson (who had previously proposed an ambitious Metropolitan Sepulchre project) and Augustus Charles Pugin, gained more financial, political and public support to fund the 'General Cemetery Company'. Public meetings were held in June and July 1830 at the Freemasons' Tavern, and Carden was elected treasurer. On 11 July 1832, the Act of Parliament establishing a 'General Cemetery Company for the interment of the Dead in the Neighbourhood of the Metropolis' gained Royal Assent. Dismissal from company Paul was a partner in the London banking firm of Strahan, Paul, Paul and Bates. He found and conditionally purchased the 54 acres of land at Kensal Green for ¬£9,500. The Act incorporating the General Cemetery Company authorised it to raise up to ¬£45,000 in shares, buy up to 80 acres of land and build a cemetery and a Church of England chapel. However, Paul and Carden were already embroiled in a dispute regarding the design of the cemetery, where Paul favoured the Grecian style and Carden the Gothic style. A succession of architects were contemplated, including Benjamin Wyatt (who declined), Charles Fowler (proposal not taken up), Francis Goodwin, Willson, and a Mr Lidell, a pupil of John Nash, before an architectural competition was launched in November 1831. This attracted 46 entrants, and in March 1832 the premium was awarded, despite some opposition, for a Gothic Revival design by Henry Edward Kendall; this decision was, however, eventually overturned as the Company directors (appointed after the Bill received Royal Assent) asserted their control and preference for a different style. One of the competition judges and a company shareholder, John William Griffith, who had previously produced working drawings for a boundary wall, ultimately designed the cemetery's two chapels and the main gateway.'Kensal Green', Survey of London: volume 37: Northern Kensington (1973), pp. 333-339.

Once a busy port on the Mississippi River, Princeton today is covered by forest and a portion of the Mississippi Levee. Nothing remains of the settlement. History Princeton was named for William Berry Prince, who settled on nearby Lake Jackson with his wife Sarah S. Jefferies in the early 1820s. Princeton was one of the first towns in the Mississippi Delta. In 1830, Princeton became Washington County's second county seat after the first county seat, New Mexico, caved into the Mississippi River. The Mississippi River flowed directly west of Princeton, and Princeton Landing was the town's port. Across the river in Arkansas was the now-extinct town of Grand Lake. The Mississippi Legislature incorporated the Lake Washington and Deer Creek Railroad and Banking Company in 1836. Based in Princeton, the railroad began constructing a line east from the town to Lake Washington and Deer Creek. The intent was to move cotton by railroad to Princeton, where it could be shipped by boat along the Mississippi River. Only a portion of the railroad bed was completed before the company's charter was repealed in 1839. In 1838, the steamer Oronoko was anchored in the port at Princeton when a boiler blew, killing between 100 and 150 on board. Most of the passengers were recent immigrants traveling north from New Orleans. After a second explosion on the Ohio River that same week killed 150, the U.S. government passed its first legislation requiring steamboat owners to take measures to protect those on board. An early settler to Washington County was Junius Richard Ward, who amassed a fortune in hemp, cotton, and mercantile and shipping interests. Ward built a mansion near Lake Washington, and also owned Ward Hall in Kentucky. Ward erected a 40-room mansion--against the advice of friends--overlooking the Mississippi River north of Princeton. At its peak, Princeton had 600 residents, 12 stores, an inn, a bank, a private school, and a livery stable. The county seat was moved to Greenville in 1844. By 1850, most of the town had caved into the river. The last remaining merchant, S.B. Lawson, sold the townsite and remaining buildings to a former slave for $125. In 1858, Ward's mansion washed away in a flood. The Mississippi River has since changed its course several miles west, and the former townsite is now located next to Carolina Chute, an oxbow lake.

The dealers felt cut off from their main sales channel and thus deprived them the opportunity to use online platforms like Amazon, eBay or Rakuten in a competitive market for the benefit of their customers. Sales of all products and services traded online in Europe in 2012 counted 311.6 billion Euros. Through online trading in Europe is estimated that up to two million jobs were created.Ecommerce Europe Report 2013 The initiative later received support from other industry stakeholders including German BVOH (Bundesverband Onlinehandel) and CCIA (Computer and Communications Industry Association).

In 2013, she was appointed Deputy Chairperson of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania whilst simultaneously teaching economics at the Vilnius University Institute of International Relations and Political Science, as well as public finance at ISM University of Management and Economics. On 31 October 2016, she was elected as the MP for the Antakalnis constituency in the 2016 Lithuanian parliamentary election. After Simonyte announced she is running for a president on 4 November 2018, she won the nomination from the Homeland Union party for the presidential candidacy. ≈†imonytƒó was the leading candidate in Lithuania's 2019 presidential election after winning 31.31% of the vote in the primary round ahead of second-placed opponent, Gitanas Nausƒóda. However, she has lost the final elections with only 32.86% of the votes against Gitanas Nausƒóda, who has won the elections with 65.86%. In addition to her native Lithuanian, ≈†imonytƒó speaks English, Polish and Russian as well as basic-level Swedish.http://www.lrs.lt/sip/portal.show?p_r=8801&p;_k=1&p;_a=498&p;_asm_id=56180&pt;=sn:3 Early life Born in Vilnius, ≈†imonytƒó moved to the Antakalnis district with her parents in 1984 where she spent most of her childhood and formative years. In 1992, ≈†imonytƒó finished school at the Vilnius ≈Ωirm≈´nai Gymnasium, where she was recognised and awarded for her academic skills in mathematics. Academic Achievements The same year, she entered Vilnius University‚Äôs Faculty of Economics, where she graduated in 1996 with a degree in Business Administration. Two years later, ≈†imonytƒó went on to earn a master's degree in Economics from the same institution. Career as an Economist and Public Servant 1997 marked the start of ≈†imonytƒó's career as an economist and as a public servant. She was made the Chief of The Tax Division ‚Äì a department which falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Lithuania. Between 1998 and 2001, she served as an economist at the Ministry of Finance before being promoted to head of the ministry's Indirect Taxation Division, where she remained until 2004. ≈†imonytƒó remained with the Tax Department until 2009 where she stepped down from her position as Chancellor of the Ministry before taking up the position of Minister of Finance in the government of Lithuania's former Prime Minister, Andrius Kubilius. Here she presided over a number of successful austerity measures to ensure Lithuania quickly recovered from the global economic crisis, and set the course for Lithuania's current rate of positive economic growth. ≈†imonytƒó served as Minister of Finance until 2012, before taking up the role as the first ever female Deputy Chair of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania during the following year. Career as an Academic In 2013 ≈†imonytƒó further advanced her career after taking up a lecturing role at Vilnius University's Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science. She also undertook a similar position at the university as a lecturer in International Relations and Political Science. Career as a member of parliament During the 2016 Lithuanian parliamentary election, ≈†imonytƒó was elected as the Member of Parliament for the Antakalnis constituency in Vilnius. Although she ran on an independent ticket, she received backing from the TS-LKD. In accordance with Lithuanian electoral law, she had to step down from her parliamentary position after announcing her run for the presidency in 2018. Presidential Election 2019 On 24 September 2018, ≈†imonytƒó announced she would run in Lithuania's 2019 presidential election as an independent candidate ‚Äì once again with backing from the TS-LKD. 4 November saw her beat European Union‚Äôs former ambassador to Russia, Vygaudas U≈°ackas, in the run-offs to become the TS-LKD- backed candidate. ≈†imonytƒó took 79% of the vote compared to U≈°ackas‚Äô 21%. 12 May 2019 saw ≈†imonytƒó advance to the second and final round of the 2019 Lithuanian presidential election after taking victory with 31.31% of the entire vote. She marginally won after edging out her nearest challenger, Gitanas Nausƒóda, who trailed the former Finance Minister on 30.94%. In the final round on 26 May 2019 she had fewer people voting for her, than in the first round. Political stances=Foreign policy In October 2018, ≈†imonytƒó stated that if elected president, she would increase the amount that Lithuania spends on defence from its budget. She also cited Russia as a \\"state that has broken all international agreements\\" and as a threat to European security. ≈†imonytƒó is in favour of improving strategic relations between Lithuania and neighbouring Poland, and called U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement a \\"mistake\\". Domestic policy ≈†imonytƒó has openly stated that she is not against same-sex civil unions. With regard to abortion, she has not made an official comment on the issue. However, she has said that she would not condemn women who choose to do so.

Lord was engaged in banking; founded the Manhattan insurance company, and served as its president 1821-34; was the first president of the Erie Railroad company; was a prominent friend of the New York university, and assisted in founding theological seminaries at East Windsor, Connecticut, and Auburn, New York.\\"LORD, Eleazar\\", in: Library of Universal Knowledge: A Reprint of the Last (1880) Edinburgh and London Edition of Chambers's Encyclopaedia, with Copious Additions by American Authors, Volume 9. p. 169 His principal works are Principles of currency; Geological Cosmogony: and an edition of Lempriere's Biographical Dictionary, with numerous additions.  Biography = Youth  Eleazar Lord was born September 9, 1788, at Franklin, Connecticut. His early boyhood was spent among the quiet scenes of that even-tenored rural vicinage, where his elementary education was obtained in the district schools. At the age of sixteen, in 1804, he left home and began life as a clerk in a store at Norwich. Title page of \\"A compendious history of the principal Protestant missions to the heathen,\\" 1813. In 1808 he returned home to prepare himself for college, under the direction of the Rev. Dr. Lee, of Lisbon, of whose church (Presbyterian) he became a member in 1809. After two years of preparatory study, he entered Andover Seminary, and remained there three and a half years. While there he time deeply interested in the subject of Foreign Missions, an interest that remained active with him all his life. He wrote the first pretentious work in the literature of that department of the church ever published in this country : \\"A History of the Principal Protestant Missions to the Heathen.\\" It was published in 1813 at Boston.  From Salem N. H. and Princeton College to New York City  In September, 1812, he was licensed to preach by the Haverhill Association at Salem, New Hampshire. He had no regular charge, but preached acceptably at various places for a year. He entered Princeton College, where for some months he attended the lectures and recitations of that celebrated institution. A serious affection of the eyes compelled him to give up his cherished position in life to devote himself to secular concerns, the exactions of which would not demand the sacrifice of his sight. He engaged actively in commercial and financial affairs, and while giving to them necessarily a large part of his time, his inclinations for religious work and its advancement were not permitted to languish in the slightest degree. In 1815 he personally called a public meeting of the citizens of New York City to consider the subject of Sunday-schools, then an untried branch of church work. He organized the New York Sunday-school Union Society, and became its corresponding secretary. He spent much time in organizing Sunday-schools, and in editing and superintending the publication of Sunday-school literature. In 1816 he was a member of the convention in New York City that organized the American Bible Society. In March, 1817, his eyes again warning him, he spent nearly a year and a half travelling in Europe. While abroad he met and established cordial relations with all the prominent reformers of the day, philanthropical, evangelical, and political, among them William Wilberforce, George Canning, Rowland Hill, Thomas Chalmers, Macaulay the elder, Sir Thomas Baring, and hosts of others. He returned to New York in 1818.  Businessman in New York City  In 1819 Lord was selected by the leading merchants of New York City to go to Washington in their interest as an advocate for the adoption by Congress of a protective tariff, which, they held, would be for the general good of the country. The measures he prepared were passed in 1820, but the businessmen of the Fast insisted that the tariff was not yet protective enough, and in 1823-24 Lord was sent to Washington to advocate still further tariff revision. His views were opposed by Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun, and all the Southern and some of the Western statesmen. His arguments were such, however, that Clay finally acquiesced in them, and used them in his subsequent speeches in and out of Congress, whence came Clay's fame as the \\"Father of the American System.\\" Merrill D. Peterson (1987) The Great Triumvirate : Webster, Clay, and Calhoun: Webster. p. 68 In 1821 Eleazar Lord obtained the charter for and organized the Manhattan Fire Insurance Company of New York, of which he was president twelve-years. During the management of Lord the Manhattan Company paid annually dividends of nine per cent. In 1826, Lord was instrumental in the formation of the American Home Mission Society, of which he was the first corresponding secretary. He wrote the first annual report of this society. Early in 1827 Dartmouth College and Williams College each conferred the degree of Master of Arts on Eleazar Lord. In that year the banking system then in operation in New York State had shown its utter inefficiency by the deplorable condition into which the banks had fallen, and Lord turned his attention toward placing it on a sounder basis. In 1828-29 he wrote and published a book entitled, \\"Credit, Currency and Banking,\\" in which he recommended a system that he claimed would remedy the defects of the one prevailing. His recommendations became the foundation of what was known as the Free Banking System, and from the 1830s until it was replaced by the national banking law, it remained in force in New York State, and was adopted by others. When, during the emergency that came with the Civil War, the Committee on Ways and Means in Congress was devising a method to best sustain the finances of the country, Lord was summoned by it to give the benefit of his knowledge of and experience in practical finance. In response, he formulated the plan, and made the original draft of the bill authorizing its adoption, on which the present national banking system was established.  First President of Erie Railroad  Map of the proposed route of New York & Erie Railroad, 1834. Eleazar Lord was one of the originators of the New York and Erie Railroad Company, and had been instrumental in the chartering of the New York & Erie Railroad (NY&E;) by the New York state legislature on April 24, 1832. He was elected its first president August 9, 1833. Lord's plan for the construction of the road through the Susquehanna Valley, and the work he did under that plan, may well be wondered at now, as it was then, but that his motives were honest, sincere, and intended for the promotion of the best interests of the Company and the hastening of the enterprise to successful issue, not one of his most hitter detractors, if any are living today, would undertake to deny. His insistence on the six-foot gauge was also an unfortunate error in judgment. In spite of these, however, the fad remains that Eleazar Lord tided the New York and Erie Railroad Company over some of its darkest days.See also: Edward Harold Mott (1899) Chapters \\"Administrations of Eleazar Lord - First, Second, and Third\\" - pages 20-31, 48-51, and 74-85. Lord started living at Piermont, on the Hudson just north of the New Jersey state line. The village's name, in earlier years known as Tappan Landing, was given by Lord. Later in 1847 the cemetery of Sparkill, New York was created by Eleazar Lord. Lord's busiest years were doubtless those of the Erie Railroad period, yet from 1831 to 1844 he wrote and published five books on scientific and religious subjects, besides numerous papers for magazines on similar subjects. From that time until 1866 he added to his literary work many volumes, having for their subjects finance, general and doctrinal theology, history and science, besides innumerable reviews for magazines and periodicals. During the same time he was in constant correspondence with most of the leading men in this and foreign countries. In 1866 the degree of Doctor of Laws was conferred upon him by the University of New York. In 1855 he published his \\" Historical Review of the Xew York and Erie Railroad.\\"  Family  Lord married, July 12, 1824, Elizabeth Pierson, only daughter of Hon. Jeremiah H. Pierson, of Ramapo, N. Y. She died May 3, 1833. December 31, 1835, he married Ruth Thompson, daughter of Deacon Eben Thompson, of East Windsor, Conn. Seven children were born to him by his first wife. None survive but Sarah Pierson Lord Whiton, wife of W. H. Whiton, Esq. This daughter and her husband occupy the Lord homestead at Piermont-on-the-Hudson, where Eleazar Lord died, June 3, 1871, aged 83 years.

It dates to the 17th century and has since inspired many variations; well known examples include Any Drink Called For, The Bar Act, Satan's Barman, and Think-a-Drink. During the temperance movement it became The Obliging Tea Kettle, and the modern Magic Tea Kettle remains a common prop available at most magic stores. A slight variation is the Magic Funnel. Today the trick is normally performed for children, although some stand-up shows retain a variation. Effect The magician produces a bottle or kettle and asks the audience to name any sort of drink: water, beer, tea, or any other liquid. The magician tips the bottle and pours out a glass of that drink. He then asks for another example, and another, with the bottle producing the drinks on demand, seemingly forever. At the end of the performance the bottle is broken open to reveal various objects. Kettles generally reveal a number of colored handkerchiefs inside, which are said to give the kettle its magical powers. History The earliest known example of the \\"Inexhaustible Bottle\\", described in 1635. The trick has been dated to 1635, when it appeared in Hocus Pocus Junior: The Anatomie of Legerdemain in London. In this version, a barrel can produce three different drinks on command. Hocus Pocus Junior is a collection work, so the trick must be even older, but no earlier references are known. Harry Houdini found another early mention from 1707, and another in 1712 when part of the \\"famous water-works of the late ingenious Mr. Henry Winstanly\\" were demonstrated by his wife. By the late-18th century the trick was so well known that in 1780, John Theophilus Desaguliers used the trick to demonstrate hydrostatics. It remained a standard demonstration for the next century at least. The barrel changed to a bottle in the early-19th century, when \\"Herr Schmidt\\" introduced \\"The Bottle of Sobriety and Inebriety\\" around 1821. The trick was next seen in London in 1835 by \\"Falck of Koenigsberg\\"'s \\"Infernal Bottle\\". Phillippe used a variety of this trick between 1836 and 1838. Phillippe's assistant, Macallister, claimed to have invented it. Similar acts were performed by many, including the well-known Ludwig Leopold D√∂bler, who is seen performing it on a poster in 1842. When Jean Eug√®ne Robert-Houdin of Paris arrived in London to perform, he found that almost all of his r√©pertoire was being performed by Compars Herrmann at the Th√©√¢tre Royal. Nevertheless, Robert-Houdin continued to use the trick at his opening show on 1 December 1847, and heavily promoted himself as the trick's inventor. Henri Robin, a Dutch magician, took to the same act as well, performing Robert- Houdin's r√©pertoire and likewise claiming that he had invented the inexhaustible bottle. Robert-Houdin's popular autobiography tipped the balance in his favour; physicists using the bottle to demonstrate hydrostatics were soon referring to it as the \\"Robert-Houdin bottle\\". Anderson demonstrates the Inexhaustible Bottle trick on the playbill for an 1843 performance. John Henry Anderson, the \\"Wizard of the North\\", had begun using the act while performing in Europe. A variation appears on advertising for a performance at the Victoria Rooms in Hull in April 1838. In 1849 he toured North America, where it was quickly copied. It spread so rapidly that it was soon available in toy shops across the country. The December 1880 issue of Scribner's Monthly mentions the trick dismissively. Magicians looking to re-invigorate what was then a widely performed and well understood trick started to make modifications. Scribner's describes one version by \\"Senior Patrizio\\" where the performer is able to pour beer for everyone in the hall, along with a failed attempt by another would-be magician who changed this to champagne and ended up drenched head to toe. A more common modification was introduced by English magician David Devant as \\"The Obliging Tea Kettle\\", at the suggestion of his wife. Kettles became a common variety of the act, and are widely used today. Devant explained the trick in detail in Secrets of My Magic.David Devant, \\"Secrets of My Magic\\", Hutchinson, 1936, p. 119. Charles Hoffman, known as \\"Think-a-Drink Hoffman\\", performed one of the best known examples as a vaudeville act. His show used a small bar and a series of cocktail shakers which he used to produce any drink the audience asked for, up to eighty different drinks according to his own press materials. During Prohibition, he would produce alcoholic drinks at private shows, and became known as \\"The Highest Paid Bartender in the World\\".Frank Cullen, \\"Vaudeville, Old & New\\", Psychology Press, 2006, p. 51. By the late-1930s the same act had been copied by a wide variety of magicians, and in 1943 Hoffman sued a number of them, proceeding with a suit against Maurice Glazer. In a landmark 1943 ruling, the Supreme Court of Florida agreed that Hoffman held the trademark rights to the name \\"Think-a-Drink\\", but that the act itself was not entitled to protection. This has been used as a standard piece of precedent when discussing intellectual rights to magic methods.\\"Glazer v. Hoffman\\", 153 Fla. 809 (1943) Method The concept includes two different tricks, the original \\"any drink\\" where a single container can pour multiple drinks, and the \\"endless pour\\" in which a seemingly large or continuous amount of liquid is poured from a container that is too small to hold it. Any drink Privat-Deschanel's \\"Elementary treatise on natural philosophy\\" explains the use of the Inexhaustible Bottle as a way to cleverly demonstrate the basic principles of hydrostatics. The Magic Funnel variation. The original method from Hocus Pocus Junior was a single large barrel that is modified with internal baffles to create three sections. A single spigot on one of the flat ends of the barrel is extended with three pipes, one leading into each of the different partitions. The flow is controlled through a bunghole on the top that is likewise modified to run to three hoses, one into each partition. By turning the stopper in the bunghole to uncover one of the pipes, air can flow into the selected partition. When the spigot is opened, only the liquid from the selected partition can flow out, the partial vacuum in the other chambers prevents the flow. The original \\"any drink\\" methods using bottles were similar to Hocus Pocus, simply on a smaller scale. Most variations used what appeared to be a bottle but was actually a tin container japanned (lacquered) green to appear like glass. The internal area is divided into sections and each one empties into a tube that ends just short of the neck. Very small holes drilled into the bottle allow them to be selected in the same fashion as Hocus Pocus, with the magician's hand holding the bottle so their fingers cover the holes; lifting one starts the pour. The tea kettle varieties simply moved the holes to the handle. A slight variation on the theme is the Magic Funnel, which uses a two-walled funnel holding liquid between the walls. The magician pours a small amount of liquid through the funnel as normal, but it continues to pour when they lift their finger from a hole on the handle. A very different variation on the any drink method uses small packets of dried flavouring or color that can be dropped into the cups before the pour begins. \\"Think-a- Drink\\" used this at least for some performances, and prior to one show the seemingly dirty cups were polished by a stage hand and had to be re-prepared. In spite of Hoffman's attempts to protect the act, or perhaps because of it, this is now the basis for the simplest version, the Magic Tea Kettle. This version uses small beads of colouring that are dropped into the cup, preferably during the pour, and the container itself holds water.In the \\"Magic tea kettle trick\\" demonstration, the color beads can just be made out in the translucent cups. Most versions contain water only in the bottom of the kettle, the upper portion is a separate container that can be used for a reveal.\\"Tea Kettle + BONUS\\", an example with silks Other versions may use various simple chemistry to produce the colors. These variations are simple to distinguish because the fluid coming out of the bottle is always the same color (normally clear), while the original method actually has different fluids inside. Endless pour The seemingly inexhaustible amount of liquid is even simpler; it relies on special \\"essence glasses\\" which appear about the size of an aperitif glass, but are mostly glass with little open space for the liquid. This not only helped the illusion (until lifted to the lips) but also reduced the cost of performing the act if the glasses were handed out. For very large audiences, sleight of hand can be used to switch bottles during the act; Modern Magic suggests doing this while calling for more glasses to be brought onstage. Scribner's describes a very different method in which a beer barrel was placed under the stage and piped to a hole in the floor where it ended in some sort of coupling. The performer would walk to the hole and press their shoe onto the coupling to connect to rubber hosing running through his clothes to a bottle, where he would begin to pour. Many acts added two flourishes. One was to rinse the bottle with water at the start of the act, which is accomplished simply by covering all of the holes and pouring water into the mouth. Unable to travel up the tubes into the bladders, it falls into the space between them and can be emptied back out the same way. Most acts also included an ending where the bottle was broken open. This was actually a cut line along the bottom of the \\"bottle\\" which could be pulled apart by applying a little effort. Physics The inexhaustible bottle is a simple demonstration of hydrostatics, specifically Pascal's law. Pascal's law states that any pressure applied at any point in a continuous fluid is applied equally throughout the fluid. For example, if you squeeze the top of a disposable water bottle, the entire bottle inflates evenly. A corollary of Pascal's law is that a negative pressure is also equally distributed throughout the fluid, meaning that if one applies a partial vacuum at any point, the entire surface sees the same drop in pressure. In the case of the inexhaustible barrel, the container has a very large surface area in comparison to the relatively small tube leading from the bunghole. When the tube is sealed and the pouring cock at the bottom opened, a tiny amount of fluid will drain out until a vacuum is produced in the tube. At that point the entire surface of the fluid is also under vacuum. The difference in pressure from ambient atmospheric at the spigot to the partial vacuum at the top of the liquid counteracts the force of gravity and the flow stops. To start the flow, the hole at the top is uncovered to allow air into the chamber, equalizing the pressure on the top and bottom. The inexhaustible bottle works identically in physical terms, and simply removes the spigot and uses the physical inversion of the bottle to allow flow when the finger holes are uncovered. Modern magic tea kettle variations may or may not have a similar apparatus to control flow. Because the trick in this case takes place in the cups, not the kettle, there is no real need to control the flow. Nevertheless, most variations do include a similar finger hole to allow the magician to control the flow and create various pouring effects like streams of water that start and stop mid-pour.

He was not even being considered for the Sochi Olympics until late January when he placed second at the Quebec world qualifying event. He was the first alternate on the U.S. Ski Team in a World Cup event in Val Saint-C√¥me, Quebec, and was called up to the event when a teammate was injured and could no longer compete. He was told he needed to be on a plane the next morning, and at one in the morning he booked his flight for 9 a.m. At the World Cup event Mac placed second, which put him in the running for Sochi. He was sitting in AP English class when he received word that he made the team. Mac was the only men's freestyle aerials competitor for the United States. On February 17, 2014, at Rosa Khutor Extreme Park, in the men's freestyle aerials fourth-round qualifying finals Mac placed 5th with a score of 113.72, missing the medal round by one spot. Personal life Mac began skiing before he reached the age of two years at Bromley Mountain in Vermont. Both his parents, Libby and David, as well as his older siblings, Lexi and Cody, were avid skiers. Originally from Madison, Connecticut, at age thirteen Mac moved to Lake Placid, New York, in 2008 to pursue his dream of becoming an Olympic skier. Two years later he moved across the country to Park City, Utah. He attended middle school in Connecticut and then did high school classes through an online program. His parents remained in Madison, so Mac moved to the Olympic Training Center by himself.

He became renowned as a Baal Shem () for performing miracles, commanding demons and authoring Kabalistic amulets. Background Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn (1880‚Äì1950) writes in his memoirs that Yoel‚Äôs father was Yisrael Yosef, a disciple of Rabbi Mordecai Yoffe. Sometime after the latter‚Äôs passing in 1612 he moved to Zamosc. A year after his arrival to Zamosc he had a son and named him Yoel. Yoel learned for 5 years in the Yeshiva of Rabbi Joel Sirkis (Hebrew: ◊ô◊ï◊ê◊ú ◊°◊ô◊®◊ß◊ô◊©) (possibly in Liuboml) who was a Halachist and adherent of Kabbalah. Yoel married before the age of 20 and started learning Kabbalah. Upon a dream, Yisrael Yosef sent his son Yoel to Prague to learn kabbalah from Rabbi Eliyahu Baal Shem. Yoel became one of the closest students of Rabbi Eliyahu Baal Shem who confided all his special teaching to him. Yoel returned to Zamosc and opened a Yeshiva there which became renowned for teaching both niglah and nistar. Reb Yoel had a son Uri who learned in the Yeshiva of Rabbi David HaLevi Segal (author of the Turei Zahav) in Ostroh (; , ). After the latters passing, he went to learn for another six years under Rabbi Avraham Gombiner (Hebrew: ◊ê◊ë◊®◊î◊ù ◊ê◊ë◊ú◊ô ◊î◊ú◊ï◊ô ◊í◊ï◊û◊ë◊ô◊†◊®) (author of Magen Avraham) in Kalisz. Upon Uri‚Äôs marriage, Rabbi Yoel appointed him as Rosh yeshiva for Nigla studies, whilst he remained Rosh Yeshiva for Nistar. He was Rosh yeshiva for some 50 years. Teachings and Legacy Rabbi Yoel Baal Shem (I) was the teacher of Rabbi Adam Baal Shem of Ropczyce () who instructed Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov in Kabbalah. Stories and teachings of Rabbi Yoel Baal Shem (I) can be found in various kabbalistic sefarim, especially in two sefarim, Mifalos Elokim and Toldos Adam which earned the imprimatur of his grandson, Rabbi Yoel Baal Shem (II), the son of Uri.

Hans \\"Hasse\\" Persson (20 January 1929 ‚Äì 29 July 2001), often called HP, was a Swedish football forward who in his time was immensely popular in the football club Landskrona BoIS. Biography Hasse \\"HP\\" Persson started his football career in his hometown Klippan before the age of twenty, and in 1949 he took the step to Helsingborgs IF and Allsvenskan. There, he soon blossomed into his role as left inner and got his debut in the Swedish national team. His first game for Sweden was in September 1952 in Helsinki in an international match against Finland and he made a hat trick in an 8-1 triumph. The next international against Norway that same autumn he made the decisive 2-1 goal, and he also scored in his international game number three, against Italy. In this match, however, he injured his neck and had to leave the game in half time. The injury came to be fatal, and as a result of it he had to say no to test games with Italian side AC Milan. Hasse Persson was something of a bohemian. Many are the stories of a willful and exuberant gentleman who often went his own ways. After a turbulent time, he left Helsingborgs IF. In 1955, HP wrote a contract with Helsingborgs IF arch rivals, Landskrona BoIS. In Landskrona, he soon became a big star in the city and it is said that he alone brought big crowds to Landskrona IP. There are many citizens in Landskrona who believes that the club never had a better player than Persson. Many of those who experienced the 1950s and 1960s have their special Hasse Persson-memories. This is almost always about goals from impossible distances, rocket shots, phenomenal assists or various other technical showpieces. Even during the years in Landskrona professional clubs were interested in contracting him, for example Italian side Udinese Calcio. During Hasse Persson time in BoIS the club played qualification games to Allsvenskan no less than three times: in 1958, 1959 and 1962. Landskrona BoIS failed, however, to take the step up in all occasions. In the qualifying game in 1959 against Degerfors IF a new attendance record for Landskrona IP with 18 535 spectators was created, a record that still stands today. Hasse Persson winded down in his home club Klippan in 1966. He continued to be a welcome guest at Landskrona IP even after his career ended. He died in 2001.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Wallasey, the archdeaconry of Chester and the diocese of Chester. Its benefice is united with that of Emmanuel, New Brighton. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History The church was built between 1854 and 1856 to a design by George Gilbert Scott. The foundation stone was laid on 16 February 1854 by the Rt Revd John Graham, Bishop of Chester, and the church was consecrated on 10 July 1856. The total cost of the church and parsonage was ¬£12,523. A south vestry designed by A. R. Keighley was added in 1924. Architecture=Exterior St James' is constructed in stone with a slate roof, and has a cruciform plan. The plan consists of a four-bay nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles under lean-to roofs, north and south transepts, a chancel with a canted east end, a south chapel and vestry, north and south porches, and a steeple at the northeast corner. The windows along the sides of the aisles are paired between buttresses, and in the clerestory are triangular windows. At the west end of the church are gabled buttresses, between which is a doorway. Above the doorway are three lancet windows and a circular window. The transepts also have gabled buttresses and triple lancets, and a rose window on the north and south sides. In the chancel are two-light windows in each of the three sides of the canted east end, and there are two-light windows in the chapel. The tower has angle buttresses and is in four stages. In the bottom stage is an entrance on the east side and blind arcading on the north side. The second stage contains traceried lancets, the third stage has pairs of trefoil-headed windows, and in the top stage are two-light louvred bell openings and a cornice decorated with ballflowers. On top of the tower is a broach spire with lucarnes and a niche above each broach. Interior Inside the church are five-bay arcades with round columns. The chancel arch also has round columns, these having foliate capitals. There is a low iron chancel screen, and a two- bay arcade with a parclose screen between the chancel and the chapel. The timber pulpit is octagonal and decorated with figures. The reredos of 1897 is by A. O. Hemming, who also executed paintings on the chancel walls and ceiling in 1899. The original pipe organ was made in 1891 by Hele and Company, and was repaired by the same company in 1910 following damage caused by a gas explosion. This organ was replaced in 2006 by one moved here by David Wells from St John's Church, Egremont.

The broadly perforate, translucent, glossy shell has a depressed- turbinate shape. Its colour is variable, either uniform buff, uniform white, or with brown spirals on a white ground. The 4¬Ω whorls are rounded on the base, angled at the periphery, flattened above and impressed at the suture. The sculpture of the protoconch is smooth, the next whorl shows a couple of spiral keels, which by intercalation multiply in number, but decrease in relative importance as the whorls advance. The body whorl carries close fine spiral threads, of which every fourth or fifth predominates. The radials are confined to faint growth lines. The aperture is slightly descending, oblique, angled above, rounded below. The outer lip is simple. The columella is expanded, and a little reflected above. A substantial callus unites the lips. The deep umbilicus is narrow, spiral, externally funicular, exempt from the spiral sculpture.

The south of England saw heavy rainfalls associated with these storms which caused widespread flooding, power cuts and major disruptions to transport. Economically, the worst affected areas were Somerset, Devon, Dorset and Cornwall in the south west and the Thames Valley in the south east. The Met Office reported the storms produced the wettest 1 December to 31 January since 1876; a local authority report states the winter as a whole, from the beginning of December until the end of February, was the wettest recorded in the UK since records began in 1766. Parts of South East England received almost two and a half times the amount of rainfall that they would normally expect. The flood phenomena ranged from coastal flooding, pluvial flooding, fluvial flooding to groundwater flooding. The flooding took over most of the Somerset Levels and saw the main railway line to Cornwall and West Devon at Dawlish severed for several weeks. Meteorological history A series of low pressure areas developed or formed over North America explosively deepening over the Atlantic/gulf stream before reaching the European coast.

Impact=Coastal flooding The period began on 5 December 2013 when a deep low pressure area moved from the Atlantic over Scotland and the North Sea inducing a storm surge in the Irish Sea and North Sea coasts of the United Kingdom. In the North Sea some of the highest level tides were recorded in the Humber and Thames estuaries, exceeding levels which occurred during the disastrous North Sea flood of 1953. Flooding occurred in Tyneside, Teesside, along the Yorkshire coast, around the Humber and the Wash, where in particular the town of Boston, Lincolnshire was badly affected by when the high tide overtopped defences. Breached seawall and railway at Dawlish, Devon Coastal flooding particularly affected the south and west of the UK, with severe damage reported Wales, Cornwall, Devon and Dorset. A particularly notable event occurred on 5 February when the seawall and railway line were breached at Dawlish. =The Riviera Line and transport disruption= The only railway that runs south- west of Exeter was severed on 3 February when a 165 ft (50 m) section of the Riviera Line track was damaged at Dawlish. Network Rail said it had pulled all repair staff away from working on washed away track on 4 February. A section of the town's sea wall was later reported to have washed away among with the track. A Network Rail spokesman estimated \\"hundreds of tonnes\\" of ballast had been dislodged from under tracks after they had \\"taken a real pounding from the sea\\". In a press release, First Great Western had initially said the line would only be closed until Wednesday as a result of the \\"poor weather conditions\\", but this was extended the until the end of the week. Wave damage caused 3 January at Llanaber railway station High tides lashed Plymouth's Hoe seafront and the nearby Barbican. Near Exeter, firefighters rescued a man from a vehicle stuck in floodwater. Sea defences, walls and footpaths were damaged, including at Newlyn Green on 4 February. The Tamar Bridge between Plymouth in Devon and Saltash in Cornwall was closed to all traffic for a period after wind speeds surpassed . It was reckoned that the storms had caused more than ¬£4m worth of damage across Cornwall in a month. David Cameron chaired his first COBRA meeting of the year and announced an extra ¬£100m for flood works on 5 February. Meanwhile, powerful waves continued to thrash the exposed coastline railway line at Dawlish and slightly damaged Dawlish station itself. A wave measuring more than was recorded off the coast of Penzance. A flood buoy nearby triggered a reading of at 3 am. A Department for Transport source said that the \\"most pressing issue\\" was to get the line up and running as soon as possible, \\"but equally it is clear it is important we look at the long term as well.\\" Lib Dem MP for Torbay, Adrian Sanders, said the loss of the main line was \\"a disaster\\" and called on the Transport Secretary to intervene. A landslip on the West of England Main Line at Crewkerne, Somerset cut off Exeter's railways (apart from the Tarka Line to Barnstaple in its county) on 8 February. Repairs were initially expected to take a week, but an inspection found the track was safe for slow moving trains. The line re-opened and a limited service was restored on 9 February after signalling problems were resolved. The alternative route along the Bristol to Exeter line was flooded on the Somerset Levels for longer. Inland flooding The number of properties flooded was less than in the 2007 United Kingdom floods and was akin to the Autumn 2000 western Europe floods. During this flood more than 200,000 sandbags were used. Flood protection in Upton-upon-Severn =Severn catchment= Flooding on the middle and lower reaches of the River Severn were similar in magnitude to those experienced during the 2007 United Kingdom floods. =Somerset Levels= The 2012 Great Britain and Ireland floods had brought severe flooding to the Somerset Levels. During December 2013 and January 2014 heavy rainfall led to extensive flooding on the Somerset Levels with over 600 houses and of agricultural land, including North Moor, Curry and Hay Moors and Greylake, affected. The village of Thorney was abandoned and Muchelney cut off. Northmoor Green, which is more commonly known as Moorland was also severely affected. It was said that the government had not been quick enough to react and provide assistance to flooded communities. Flood relief activities included the use of rescue boats and the army. High volume pumps were brought in from the Netherlands and installed at several points to try to relieve the flooding. Prince Charles and several senior politicians visited the area. Controversy arose about the role of the Environment Agency, with claims that the need for ongoing dredging of the main rivers had been neglected. However, Professor of Water Management at Cardiff University,http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/364367-falconer-roger Roger Falconer and other hydrologists made clear that dredging does not offer a useful solution to flooding on the Levels.January 29, 2014. Expert reaction to Somerset flooding. https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to- somerset-flooding/ =Mid Surrey to Mid Kent= Flooding on the River Darent Eynsford, Kent 26 December 2013 A stormy period from the 23‚Äì27 December 2013 brought heavy rainfall to southern England, especially in a swathe from Dorset through Hampshire, Surrey and Kent. The first storm brought travel disruptions, especially as the flooding affecting Yalding and the electrical substations at Gatwick Airport leaving the northern terminal without power on Christmas Eve. After Cyclone Dirk on Christmas Day, saturated ground led to localised flooding in southern England, as the storm brought up to 60mm of rain to the UK. A major incident was declared including parts of Leatherhead and Dorking; Fire Brigade unions calling off a planned strike for the counties. An Environment Agency spokesman said flooding in Kent and Sussex was the worst since Autumn 2000. Surrey County Council produced statutory investigation reports, documenting responsibilities, actions, next steps and the estimation of homes internally flooded, in total, across its other parts (eight districts) less acutely affected than its Thames Valley three districts.https://www.surreycc.gov.uk/people-and-community/emergency-planning- and-community-safety/flooding-advice/more-about-flooding/surrey-s19-flood- investigations =Thames Valley= Flooded gardens Chertsey January 2014 Heavy flooding at Maidenhead Bridge, January 2014 The flooding in the three north-west Boroughs of Surrey was predominately due to the Thames. It was caused by unprecedented rainfall during the winter 2013/14 period (275% in Surrey compared with an average winter). There were approximately 1170 incidents of internal property flooding in Runnymede during winter 2013/14;S19 Flood Investigation Report: Runnymede at page 7.

Many residents in Wraysbury and Datchet berated the bank-damaging flows admitted into the Jubilee River, an anabranch for Windsor and Maidenhead. They blamed this sluice-controlled flow for augmenting the Thames which caused them flooding. A Surrey County Council investigation report states the winter as a whole, from the beginning of December until the end of February, was the wettest recorded in the UK since records began in 1766. Parts of South East England received almost two and a half times the amount of rainfall that they would normally expect. Complex incident For two days in February, the River Ash flooded at least 80 homes, their grounds, garages and/or outbuildings in Staines-upon-Thames. Slow flow into the swollen Thames created flooding pinchpoints of two Colne distributaries into the Staines Aqueduct owned by Thames Water which briefly burst its banks. The latter said it had been following an existing three-party protocol. The EA replaced its inadequate sluice quickly. The Council's resultant section 19 Report was published on 20 April 2015. It states \\"the primary source of flooding that contributed to this flooding incident was fluvial in nature; the Environment Agency is the lead on managing fluvial flood risk...The EA owns and operates a sluice gate which controls flow from River Colne to the River Ash. This...is designed to ensure there is always a base flow in the River Ash to maintain the ecosystem of the river.S19 Flood Investigation Report: River Ash pages 9-10. Surrey County Council. 20 April 2015. https://www.surreycc.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/50827/S19-Report- River-Ash-Area.pdf This sluice gate adjusts automatically to send flow into the River Ash as needed. In the February event the EA overrode the automatic settings on this gate to control flooding. On 9 February (morning), EA reported that the Hythe End intake gates to the Aqueduct were fully closed. And that from this point, the Aqueduct was being fed solely with floodwater originating from the County Ditch and Wraysbury River. Thames Water increased the pumping rate from 270 million litres-a-day to 350 million litres-a-day from its Birch Green pumping station in an attempt to control flood levels. On 9 February, according to the EA, they asked Thames Water to close the Moor Lane sluice gate, which is located on the Aqueduct. Thames Water claimed to have no record of receiving that request and as a consequence, the gate was not closed... ...the Aqueduct had partially collapsed while causing significant damage. LLFA Surrey County Council had no direct flood risk management functions during the event.S19 Flood Investigation Report: River Ash Pages 4 and 13 Surrey County Council. 20 April 2015 https://www.surreycc.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/50827/S19-Report- River-Ash-Area.pdf [M]odelling work due...by the EA...will inform more robust water management measures in the future. The army dispensed free sandbags to Wraysbury victims. In Datchet, Princes William and Harry helped with defences at a road including a school which then closed for months.

France has 150 member clubs offering holiday accommodations, 50 holiday centers, official naturist beaches, unofficial beaches, and many homes where naturist swimming and sunbathing is normal. Naturism employs more than 3000 people, and is estimated to be worth ‚Ç¨250 million to the French economy. France is represented on the International Naturist Federation (INF) by the F√©d√©ration fran√ßaise de naturisme (FFN). History Sign on the beach at Cap d'Agde In 1903 S. Gay created a naturist community at Bois-Fourgon. In 1907, supported by his superiors, Abb√© Legr√©e encouraged the students at his catholic college to bathe nude on the rocky beaches near Marseille. A report on German naturism was published in la Revue des deux mondes. Marcel Kienn√© de Mongeot, who came from a noble family and who was an aviator in the Great War, is credited with starting naturism in France in 1920. By then he was a journalist who wrote a defense of the dancer, Malkowski, in the journal Vouloir. His family had suffered from tuberculosis, and he saw naturism as a cure and a continuation of the traditions of the ancient Greeks. In 1926, he started the magazine Vivre int√©gralement (later called Vivre) and the first French naturist club, Sparta Club at Garambouville, near Evreux. Others quickly followed as did local opposition. His victory in court established that nudism was legal on private property that was fenced and screened.Vivre Nu: Psychosociologie du Naturisme, Marc-Alain Descamps, Edition Trism√©giste, 1987, Drs. Andr√© and Gaston Durville opened a naturist health centre, edited the La vie sage (1924) and bought a 70 hectare site on the √éle du Levant on which they established the H√©liopolis. The village was open to the public. Dr Fran√ßois Fougerat de David de Lastours, who was gassed in the Great War and was saved by exposure to the sun, in 1925 wrote a thesis on heliotherapy and in that year opened the Club gymnique de France. Jacque de Marquette wrote on naturism and vegetarianism. In 1936, government minister L√©o Lagrange recognised the naturist movement. Randonue in Les Concluses, Gard, 2008 Facilities Albert and Christine Lecocq were active members of many of these clubs, but after disagreements left and in 1944 founded their own travel club Club du Soleil. It was popular and had members in 84 cities, becoming the world's largest naturist club. In 1948 they founded the FFN. In 1949 they started a magazine, Vie au Soleil and in 1950 they opened the CHM Montalivet at Montalivet, the world's first naturist holiday centre. In 1951 they assisted in the formation of the INF. The Quartier Naturiste at Cap d'Agde opened offering a different form of social nudity. In 1975, Euronat, the largest holiday centre (335ha) opened 10 km north of Montalivet which was running at capacity. In 1983 the FFN was accepted as an official tourist and youth movement. SOCNAT provided the management and financial stability to the movement and runs 5 centres in France and one in Spain.French wikipedia Holiday centres started to form cooperative marketing groups and aim for 5 star status. Publicity material was of a quality indistinguishable from textile holiday companies. In this benign climate, Randonue, an unauthorised form of naturisme sauvage has become popular, and areas traditionally known for discreet sunbathing have been revisited. Naturism is accepted and can even be practised on many popular textilist beaches. As of 2007, France has 150 member clubs offering holiday accommodation, 50 holiday centers, official naturist beaches, unofficial beaches, and many homes where naturist swimming and sunbathing is normal. Naturism employs more than 3000 people, and is estimated to be worth million to the French economy. France is represented on the INF by the FFN.

History ELE was founded in 1998 by American Stephen Lapeyrouse ‚Äì author, essayist, editor, private English language tutor. In the first three seasons, 1998‚Äì2000, the forum was called ‚ÄúEnglish Language Discussion Club‚Äù ‚Äì ELDC. Stephen Lapeyrouse remained a permanent ELE host and moderator for 17 years. In 2015 he stepped back and devolved this position on John Harrison, editor of the magazine Moscow Expat Life, artist, radio program host of ‚ÄúBrave New World‚Äù. John Harrison has retired as a host of ELE II at the end of the 20th season (2017/2018). Now the hosts of ELE III are Oksana Danchevskaya, a Cultural Studies specialist and an associate professor at Moscow State Pedagogical University, and Oksana Konstantinova, a translator, an English teacher and an avid traveller to English-speaking countries. By its 21st season (2018/2019) ELE had hosted more than 300 meetings with more than 230 different speakers from some 12 different countries: from astronauts to adventurers; from ambassadors to attaches of various embassies; visiting and resident professors; Fulbright scholars; writers and poets; well-known Moscow journalists (from e.g. The Moscow Times, The Moscow News, Russian Journal) and international TV and radio correspondents (from the BBC, VOA, Sky News, RT, et al.); social activists; heads of institutions (AmCham, Carnegie Moscow Center, Amnesty International, et al.) and just interesting individuals, on a very wide variety of lecture topics. The list of ELE speakers includes Australian poet and artist David Wansbrough, American diplomat and scholar David Firestein, journalist and blogger John Helmer, philosopher William Lane Craig, US diplomat James Warlick, journalist and editor Lynn Berry, American scholar of public diplomacy John H. Brown, Irish ambassador Justin Harman, US diplomat Tobias Bradford, New Zealand diplomat Rowena Hume, NASA astronaut Benjamin Alvin Drew, Australian ambassador Margaret Twomey, American writer Jeff Parker, Hollywood producer Bob Van Ronkel, humanitarian aid worker Carl Wilkens, British historian Geoffrey Roberts, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn‚Äôs son Yermolai Solzhenitsyn, American writer Deidre Dare and many others. The well- advertised forum is attended both by English-speaking Russians and the members of Moscow‚Äôs permanent and changing expat community. Purposes The purpose of ELE is to provide intelligent, interesting evenings in Moscow in English of ideas, stories and people, in an informal, friendly atmosphere, where the speakers and the public audience are able to interact over a wide variety of topics, allowing for personal contacts and relations between the mostly expat speakers and Russians in Moscow. In the context of Moscow, ELE is a distant descendant of the Lyceum movement started in 19th century America, and a direct relative to the ‚ÄúPenny University‚Äù in Santa Cruz, California, founded in 1974 by American historian Page Smith, artist and art historian Mary Holmes, Dr Paul Lee, philosopher and author, and others, and is still ongoing. The host of ELE participated in the Penny University for many years. Organization Meetings are usually held on Fridays twice a month from September to late May at the Chekhov Cultural Center (Strastnoy Boulevard, 6/2, near Pushkin Square) with lectures by (mostly) native English speakers giving lectures on topics of their own choice. Lectures usually start at 19:00, followed by questions and answers, discussion and comments, ending about 21:00. Since the 21st season (2018/2019) ELE is absolutely free due to new library rules. For many years the attendance fee was only 200 rubles (~$3), as the host tried to limit the influence of money on ELE topics, attendance, attitudes, atmosphere. A modest honorarium was offered to speakers, though some had donated theirs to more than a dozen Russian charities over the years (e.g. Russian Orphan Opportunity Fund, Action for Russia's Children, Moscow Animals, Big Brothers, Big Sisters, Nastenka, Sofia Foundation, United Way).

(1992) is a short documentary directed by Johan Grimonprez that deals with the history of a remote village in the highlands of New Guinea. The videotape assembles archival footage and oral histories depicting the first encounter between the Irian Jaya people and the scientific crew, including anthropologists, of the Dutch Star Mountains Expedition. The confrontation with the crew and their helicopter caused a shock that threw the worldview of the villagers upside down. The event even entered their Sibil-tongue language; literally translated, weng means language, whilst kobar airplane. Kobarweng's title is an ironic reference to a question first posed to Grimonprez by a local man named Kaiang Tapor, who, upon Grimonprez's arrival in the village of Pepera after a three-day hike, asked him where his helicopter was. The footage in the film is traversed by a running band of script, reporting observations and remarks culled from anthropologists' interviews, eye-witness reports, and the reminiscences of those highlanders who recall those moments of 'first contact' between the white intruders (missionaries, prospectors, anthropologists, adventurers) and the local inhabitants: \\"We never tell everything, we always keep something for the next anthropologist\\" they are candid enough to admit to Margaret Mead, while another wit remarks: \\"We called the whites 'people of soap', but their shit smelled the same as ours.\\" Switching the roles of observer and observed, the relation implied in the anthropological representation is reversed: the desire of the observing anthropologist itself becomes ‚Äúother‚Äù, ‚Äúexotic‚Äù, an object of curiosity destabilised by the villagers' questions. According to Grimonprez: \\"Kobarweng critically considers the myth of objectivity, the pretence of an epistemic and scientific detachment maintained not just by the anthropologist, but throughout the discourse of western science, where the observer finds himself caught in an alienated position of transcendence over his/her subject.\\"  It Will Be All Right If You Come Again, Only Next Time Don't Bring Any Gear, Except a Tea Kettle...  In 1994, Grimonprez showcased a five-channel installation entitled It Will Be All Right If You Come Again, Only Next Time Don't Bring Any Gear, Except a Tea Kettle..., which expanded upon the themes of Kobarweng. The encounter between the different groups in 1939 up to the current problems caused by neocolonialism. Papua New Guinea is one of the most heterogeneous countries in the world and has long been a favorite among anthropologists, with its more than 7000 years of agriculture, its hundreds of tribes and languages, some of whom have still not been \\"discovered\\". Beside a cultural-rich area, West Papua is also an area with considerable reserves of gold, copper, uranium, nickel, oil and natural gas which causes environmental degradation and ongoing series of human abuses. The whole province is occupied by the Indonesian military and an estimated 100.000 people have died in West Papua since Indonesia took control. According to a Yale university law school report \\"there can be little doubt that the Indonesian government has engaged in a systematic pattern of acts that has resulted in harm to a substantial part of the indigenous population of West Papua.\\" Amnesty International found that there were no effective means for people of the public could complain against the police acting in violation of international law and standards.  Critical reception  The film was acquired by the museum collections housed at the Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne, Centre Georges Pompidou; the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, and Tate Modern. The film was awarded the Grand Prix de VIlle de Gen√®ve - First Price at the SIV Video Biennale Saint-Gervais Gen√®ve in 1993; the First prize for the best international video creation at the Cadiz International Video Festival 1994; as well as winner for the category 'experimental documentary' at the Baltimore Film forum 1992.  Director  Johan Grimonprez is a Belgian multimedia artist, filmmaker, and curator. He is well known for his films dial H-I-S-T-O- R-Y (1997) and Double Take (2009). As of 2014, Grimonprez's upcoming projects include the feature films How to Rewind Your Dog (2014) and Shadow World: Inside the Global Arms Trade (2015), based on the book by Andrew Feinstein and was awarded a production grant from the Sundance Institute. In 2011 Hatje Cantz published a reader on his work titled Johan Grimonprez: \\"It's a Poor Sort of Memory that Only Works Backwards\\", with contributions by Jodi Dean, Thomas Elsaesser, Tom McCarthy (novelist), Hans Ulrich Obrist, and Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek. The filmproject Kobarweng or Where is Your Helicopter? (1992), was completed during Johan Grimonprez's study at the School of Visual Arts (New York), while attending the Independent study program at the Whitney Museum.

Bed Peace was written by Aiko herself, along with her frequent collaborators Mac Robinson and Brian Warfield while the latter two handled the song's production under their production name Fisticuffs. During the writing and recording of Bed Peace Aiko purposely left a verse free, as she felt a feature was necessary. When looking for a feature she had the idea to find her \\"John Lennon\\" and began to send out requests to other artists, but a lot of the musicians were busy or had overlapping schedules. During an interview Aiko commented on the song's recording process and the choice to include Gambino; > \\"What ended up happening was, I was performing with Big Sean on Jimmy Kimmel > and my publisher took me out to eat afterward. Childish Gambino came because > he‚Äôs friends with one of my brother‚Äôs friends. That‚Äôs where we met, and we > just talked and clicked.

The two artists are dressed in all-white pajamas, as they lay in the bed of a high-rise Los Angeles apartment performing their respective parts of the song. The song breaks multiple times in the video as Aiko answers questions from a reporter who is interviewing her.

Built around 1790, it is the best-preserved property associated with the Thayer family, who were prominent landowners and one of the first Pilgrim families. Benjamin Thayer and his descendants lived and farmed here until about 1920, when the property, much reduced in size, was sold out of the family. The house and its surrounding of surviving farmland was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. Description and history The Thayer House is located in a rural area of northeastern Blackstone, on the southwest side of Farm Street, historically one of the main roads joining Woonsocket, Rhode Island and Mendon, Massachusetts (of which Blackstone was a part until the 19th century). The house is set back from the road, the street lined by a low retaining wall, with period stepping stones leading to the front entrance. The house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof, large off-center chimney, clapboard siding, and a stone foundation. The main facade is symmetrical, with a center entrance, flanked by pilasters and topped by a transom window and entablature. A single-story gable-roofed wing extends to one side. The interior of the house has a typical Georgian center-chimney layout, with a vestibule area housing a winding staircase to the second floor, parlor chambers to its left and right, and a long kitchen in the rear with small rooms at either end. The interior retains a significant number of original fixtures and finishes, including doors and door hardware, wainscoting, and plaster. The first Thayer to settle in Mendon's South Parish, which later became Blackstone, was Ferdinando Thayer, who probably arrived in the area in the 1670s. This house was built about 1790 by Benjamin Thayer, who purchased the land it stands on in that year. His farm of more than was divided by his widow among his heirs, the property including the house going to their son-in- law, Alanson Adams. Adamses and Thayers owned the property throughout the 19th century, and it was finally sold out of the family in 1920, portions of the farmland having been progressively removed from the holding. Only two other families held the property during the 20th century.

Its aim is to increase the supply of credit to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as well as providing business advice services. It is structured as a public limited company and is owned by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS, formerly known as the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills or BIS). The bank has its headquarters in Sheffield.  History  The intention to create a business bank was first announced by the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, Vince Cable, in September 2012 with an initial ¬£1 billion of government funding. The aim was to bring a number of government financial schemes, advice services and expertise together, creating a one stop shop for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to go to. From 1 October 2013, Capital for Enterprise Limited (CfEL), BIS SME policy teams and private sector expertise were brought together within BIS to start the British Business Bank programme. On 2 December 2013 the Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, announced that the bank would be based in Sheffield, as well confirming an extra ¬£250 million of government funding. On 15 October 2014, the bank was granted state aid clearance from the EU Commission and the programme was subsequently transferred from BIS to British Business Bank plc on 1 November 2014. In 2018 the National Security Strategic Investment Fund (NSSIF) was created to provide long-term equity in advanced technologies relevant to national security, partly modeled on In-Q-Tel in the U.S. The UK intelligence and security agencies, led by the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), will provide guidance to the investments. The kind of technologies previously developed within government have now often been commoditised and are produced in the private sector.  Operations  The bank has taken on all financial schemes previously controlled by Capital for Enterprise Limited (CfEL), such as Enterprise Capital Funds, the Enterprise Finance Guarantee, Business Angel Co- investment Funds and the Small Firms Loan Guarantee. In addition, the bank ran the assessment process to select Bizfitech, Funding Xchange and Funding Options as designated finance platforms for the bank referral scheme. The business bank mainly targets its assistance to companies with a turnover of up to ¬£25 million. The bank does not lend to SMEs directly, but instead works with other financial institutions to increase access to funding, such as by providing part-guarantees for loans. After the January 2018 liquidation of Carillion threatened thousands of suppliers, particularly SMEs, ¬£100 million of lending was offered by the British Business Bank, alongside a fund established by HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Bank. In 2020 the NSSIF was involved in the British Government decision to invest ¬£400 million for a 45% stake in OneWeb, a struggling low earth orbit satellite communications business. It was reported that the UK would repurpose the satellites for the United Kingdom Global Navigation Satellite System. Future The business bank came under criticism from rebuildingsociety.com for its execution of the Funding for Lending scheme, where it has created unfair competition in the UK peer-to-peer lending industry by concentrating financial support via the largest platforms. Under her manifesto for the 2017 general election, Prime Minister Theresa May announced that the bank would take over from the European Investment Bank, after Brexit, receiving the UK funds hitherto earmarked for the European Investment Fund. The British Business Bank would open new offices in Edinburgh, Manchester, Birmingham, Cambridge, Newport, and Bristol. The manifestos of other parties have not announced any changes (in any policy area) as a result of Brexit.

Kohler (; born 1935 in Karlsruhe) is one of the leading German phoneticians. After leaving school in 1954, Klaus Kohler studied English, French, German, and Phonetics at the universities of Heidelberg, Besan√ßon/France, and Edinburgh/Scotland, obtaining degrees at the universities of Heidelberg and Edinburgh. His 1964 PhD thesis was entitled Aspects of the History of English Pronunciation in Scotland. He was lecturer at the university of Edinburgh from 1961 to 1966 and taught at the university of Bonn from 1966 to 1971. In 1971 followed his appointment to the newly created Chair of Phonetics in the Faculty of Arts of the University of Kiel, and to the directorship of an independent Department of Phonetics, subsequently founded in the same year. Kohler was Director of this Department until 2002. Between 1971 and 2006, he carried out a large number of German Research Council (DFG) funded projects into segmental and prosodic sound structures of High and Low German, English, and French. From 1973 to 2005 he was the Editor of the Institute Work-in-Progress series Arbeitsberichte des Instituts f√ºr Phonetik der Universit√§t Kiel (AIPUK). One of the international convention he organized was a 1989 meeting of the International Phonetic Association (IPA) to revise the international phonetic alphabet (known as the \\"Kiel Convention\\"). Kohler's research areas comprise prosody and intonation of German, development of the Kiel Intonation Model (KIM) and of prosodic labelling (PROLAB) on the basis of this model, as well as the implementation of this model in German text-to- speech synthesis.

The building, now home to a TD Bank branch, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. Description and history The Safety Fund National Bank is located in downtown Fitchburg, on the south side of Main Street between Oliver and Prichard Streets. It is a five-story structure, with a steel frame originally clad in yellow brick with brownstone trim. Its bottom two floors have been refinished with granite facing and limestone trime, with a glass-covered projecting marquee at the main entrance. The upper levels retain Renaissance Revival styling, including rounded arches above the fourth-floor window bays. Original interior features include a bank vault in the bank offices on the ground floor. The building was one of many Fitchburg commercial buildings designed by architect H. M. Francis and was completed in 1895. It is the only one of three Francis-designed bank buildings to survive in the city. It underwent major remodelings in 1934 and 1963. The Safety Fund National Bank (which through mergers and acquisitions became part of BankBoston) was established in 1874, and this was its first permanent home. In 2000, it became part of TD Bank, which continues to operate a bank branch in the building. The upper levels have been converted into residential space.

The company focuses on educational materials for the K‚Äì12 market, including language arts, math, science, social studies, critical thinking, team building, movement and music, and test preparation. Its parent company, The Lorenz Corporation, has been in the publishing industry since 1890. History Lorenz Educational Press was founded in 2008, bringing The Lorenz Corporation into the general education market. Within its first year, the company acquired two established companies in the educational market: Milliken Publishing and the Teaching & Learning Company. In 2011, Lorenz Educational Press began distributing Show What You Know Publishing materials. Imprints As of February 2014, Lorenz Educational Press has five imprints. Lorenz Educational Press The Lorenz Educational Press imprint focuses on supplementary materials that are outside of the core curriculum but can be integrated into those classes. This includes critical thinking, music and movement, team building, and cross-curricular learning. Milliken Publishing When the Milliken Publishing Company was purchased by Lorenz Educational Press in May 2008, it had been producing supplementary educational products for over 45 years. The operation, originally based in St. Louis, Missouri, was moved to Dayton, Ohio after the acquisition. The materials under this imprint are intended for pre-kindergarten through high school students and cover core curriculum areas, including language arts, math, science, and social studies. Teaching & Learning Company The Teaching & Learning Company was originally based in Carthage, Illinois, but it was moved to Dayton, Ohio when Lorenz Educational Press purchased the company. The Teaching & Learning Company had been in business for almost 15 years before it was acquired in November 2008. This imprint includes supplementary materials for preschool through high school. In 1999, Judith S. Gould and Evan Jay Gould developed the Four Square Writing Method. A series of books based on this method, and written by Judith and Evan Gould and Mary F. Burke, is published by the Teaching & Learning Company. Show What You Know Publishing Show What You Know Publishing (SWYK) was originally maintained by Englefield & Associates and based in Columbus, Ohio. In 2011, Lorenz Educational Press became the exclusive distributor for Show What You Know Publishing, moving the headquarters to its office in Dayton, Ohio.

Inspired by Italian architecture, its main gable has a rose window flanked by spires. Background As in the rest of western Jutland, Denmark's Inner Mission founded in 1861 received strong support. The movement was influential in temperance work, collective initiatives in rural communities, and efforts to reinforce the Lutheran tradition. Many poor people found in the movement a community where they could be on equal terms with more wealthy members of society, as it stressed the creation of Christian fellowship through a variety of group activities. The organisation's mission houses were used for Bible study groups, meetings and other activities for children, families, adults and the elderly. Architecture Designed by Christian Hjerrild Clausen (1866-1941) in the Neo-Gothic style and completed in 1906, it was inspired by Italian religious architecture. Clausen wished to give the building added importance by employing a style normally used for churches. The main gable features a rosette window flanked by two spires. Materials used include brick and sandstone. The building was originally designed to house an auditorium, a library and a chapel. Since 1989, it has been a listed building.

It tells the story of a small-town woman, Hester Linden, and her cult-like influence on a small band of followers, leaving them virtually lifeless. The novel was partly based on the sometimes manipulative influence that Zona Gale had on Latimer. Linden's physical appearance is closely modelled on Gale's. Latimer died a few years after the novel was published, and her works essentially disappeared. She was rediscovered in the 1980s, and her works have received some critical attention, however, the novel has not been republished. Plot summary The novel consists of three parts, each named after a character. The first two parts are from the viewpoint of a follower of Linden, who remains in the background. In the third part, Linden becomes central. Stephen Mitchell Mitchell is a boarder at the Fry house, consisting of Rex and Myrtle, their young children, Gloria and Deva, and Myrtle's unmarried sister, Dora Weck, who has been something of a financial burden on the Frys since the death of Mrs. Weck. Mitchell barely eats, and stays out late, to Myrtle's annoyance. In general, Myrtle finds fault with everything, and the others try to ignore her. Mitchell is a former follower of Linden (from ten years previouslyWAI, p. 253), and Weck is a current follower. Weck has just gotten engaged to Joe Teeter, who has been sweet on her since high school. Myrtle approves, since he works at his family's creamery and does well. A celebration of sorts follows, with Weck uninterested at first. Mitchell, Weck, and Mark Johns, another former follower of Linden, pay a visit to Amy Hemingway, also a former follower who has returned from living in Paris. Mitchell and Weck head back to the Frys' along a route that will pass by Linden's house. When Weck questions the choice of route, Mitchell finds himself succumbing to thoughts of Linden, and he lies down in the wet grass. Dora Weck Weck sleeps in, and meditates on how she actually desires Mitchell, not Teeter. Teeter comes over, but Weck says she's busy. Mitchell tries to convince Weck to give up on Linden. Myrtle is encouraging Weck to set a date for her wedding. Weck and Mitchell go on a picnic together. A kiss is broken up by mosquitoes, flies, and gnats. They flee. Weck tells Mitchell that she loves him. He says there is no such thing. While babysitting the Fry children together, Mitchell tells Weck his only interest in her is to liberate her from Linden. Myrtle comes home early, highly upset because she has all but proven that Rex is having an affair with his stenographer. Rex sleeps downstairs that night. That evening, Teeter and Weck are together. Teeter has made arrangements to have a house ready for the two, but he alternates between worshipping Weck and wondering whether she really has any interest in him at all. Upon returning home, Weck tries to sleep, but can't, and hears the arguments when Rex comes home. Next morning Deva is sick. Weck proves almost useless at being helpful, unable to remember how to make coffee even. Mitchell again tries to interest Weck in deprogramming. Teeter again comes by in the morning, this time with news that his parents will give them a new Buick as a wedding present, and that their marriage license will be ready in five days, to appear in that evening's newspaper. Weck and Mitchell talk again. Mitchell gets Weck to promise to never return to Linden's, and Weck admits that she will never marry Teeter. Their conversation is interrupted by screaming from upstairs: Deva has died. The next morning, during the planning of the funeral, there is a phone call for Weck. It is from Linden, and Weck leaves to talk to her in person. Hester Linden Linden wants Weck to repudiate her upcoming marriage to Teeter. Weck is uncertain. Linden berates her maid Agda for wearing glasses, and takes them away. Linden delivers a short feminist speech in the context of a woman running for mayor of their town. Mitchell shows up, but Linden can hardly remember him. She is suspicious that he and Weck may be interested in each other. They talk, with Mitchell accusing Linden of destroying her followers, and Linden defending her philosophy. Their confrontation ends with Linden letting Weck and Mitchell leave. The next morning the two are found dead in Linden's garden, \\"forever young, now forever beautiful.\\" Reception Initial reviews were mixed, mostly favorable, with some reservations.

The oldest portion of this rambling wood frame structure (now a private residence) is a modest \\"A frame\\" structure built c. 1782 by Joshua Tucker as a tavern on the main road between Templeton and Gardner (in which town part of the property lies). The tavern was a major local landmark, sited on a turnpike, until it was sidelined by the advent of the railroads in the mid-19th century. The building, reduced in size after it closed, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Description and history The former Whitney Tavern stands on the north side of Patriots Road east of the village center of East Templeton, on a large parcel that extends north to Gardner Road. Now largely exhibiting Greek Revival features, the rambling structure has had a long history of alteration. After its construction c. 1782, in 1790 a full Federal-style house was added onto the west side, onto which another ell was added in 1835. In 1848 the westernmost portion of the house was separated and moved down the street. The tavern changed hands from the Tucker family to Jonathan Greenwood Sr. William Whitney wed Greenwood's daughter, Sybil, in 1814 and they took over running the tavern. Sybil died in 1817, and the property was deeded to William Whitney, whose family continued to operate the tavern until the 1850s. Lucas Baker (b 1828) married Sibbel Georgianna \\"Georgie\\" Whitney (b 1823, William Whitney's daughter from his second marriage, to Dulcenah Turner) in 1857. In the 20th century the property was in the possession of their son, Lucas Lee Baker (b 1859), who periodically permitted traveling gypsy shows to use the property as a campground. The property remains in the hands of Whitney-Baker descendants to this day. The property includes the archaeological remnants of hop kilns used in the manufacture of beer for the tavern.

He was a New Territories indigenous inhabitant and Chairman of the powerful Heung Yee Kuk, and was dubbed the \\"King of the New Territories\\". Early life Chan was born in 1917 in the small village of So Kwun Wat near Tuen Mun. His father ran medicine shops and a restaurant while his mother looked after the family fields. In 1940, he worked for colonial government as a food investigator for Tuen Mun and outlying islands. This job was part of an effort to gauge food supplies during the Battle of Hong Kong. Chan fled to Mainland during the Japanese occupation. After the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War, the Kuomintang authorities on Taiwan were anxious to influence rising leaders in Hong Kong. Chan went to Taiwan in 1952 and reportedly studied politics. He had close links with Kuomintang figures in Hong Kong. Career=Rural politics He entered local politics and when he became the Chairman of the Tuen Mun Rural Committee in 1954. By 1962, he was elected Chairman of the Heung Yee Kuk. He stepped down as Chairman in 1964 but was again elected in 1968 which he held the post until 1978 when he declared his retirement from politics. By then the Kuk had gained the ear and confidence of the government. Chan helped deliver the backing of rural clansmen during the Hong Kong 1967 Leftist riots when the colonial government was seeking public support. He was given a licence to carry a revolver for protection as the Leftist rioters labeled him as anti- China traitor. Chan was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire afterwards and regained the Chairmanship of the Kuk. As Chairman of the Kuk, Chan took an interest in Lau Wong-fat who was a talented young man from the Tuen Mun area who showed an aptitude for politics. Lau was subsequently elected Chairman of the Kuk in 1980 and still retained that post until 2015. Tsing Shan Estate, the first public housing estate in Tuen Mun, was renamed San Fat Estate after him and Lau Wong-fat. Handover period After Chan stepped down from active politics in 1978, he kept a close eye on current affairs. During the Sino-British negotiations and the Sino-British Joint Declaration, he was concerned with securing the rights and privileges of indigenous villagers after the transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong to China. He was invited by the Chinese government to the Hong Kong Basic Law Consultative Committee and became a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. In the 1991 Legislative Council elections after the Tiananmen massacre, he saw the rise of the pro-democracy camp. To counter the liberal movement and assure stability over the handover period, Chan founded the political group Federation for the Stability of Hong Kong and elected as the Chairman at the age of 74. In 1993, he was member of the Preliminary Working Committee of the Hong Kong SAR. Chan died at St Teresa's Hospital on 27 July 2007 at the age of 90. Personal life Besides politics, Chan Yat- sen was also a businessman and investor. He lived in a mansion in Kowloon Tong and was driven from there to the Kowloon Tong Club in a Rolls-Royce. He played mahjong several times a week. He owned at least six other properties in Kowloon Tong valued at more than HK$700 million.

Early years The Rohault family originated in Abbeville. Jean-Baptiste Louis Rohault, a cloth and silk merchant, established himself in Paris on the rue Saint-Honor√© in the middle of the 18th century. He married into the nobility. His son, Hubert Jean-Baptiste Rohault de Fleury, born in 1750, was an advocate of the Parliament of Paris and keeper of the records of the Company of the Indies. Charles Hubert Rohault de Fleury was one of his two sons, born on 2 July 1777. His brother, Baron Hubert Rohault de Fleury, had a distinguished military career. Charles Hubert Rohault de Fleury entered the √âcole polytechnique in October 1794, where he elected to study architecture. He was among the first group of students at the institute, which had just been established by the Convention. He was taught by Jean-Louis-Nicolas Durand, a theoretician who had great influence on several generations of architects through his teaching and writings. Durand was the author of Pr√©cis des le√ßons. Rohault de Fleury later wrote that Durand had drummed into him that beauty in architecture came from economy combined with convenience. In 1800 Rohault de Fleury won a grand prize in architecture from the Institute of Sciences and Arts, and in 1802 won the first grand prize, the Prix de Rome, which let him travel to Rome. His prize was awarded for the design of a fairground on the banks of a river in a city. While functional, the design drew on classical elements of the Doric and Corinthian orders. He studied in Rome between 1803 and 1806, at the same time as Auguste-Victor Grandjean de Montigny and Auguste Famin, and developed a pronounced taste for Italian architecture. Career On his return from Italy in 1806 Rohault de Fleury was named inspector of works of the Arc de Triomphe in the Place de l'√âtoile. In 1812 he was named commissioner of roads at the prefecture of police, holding this position until 1840, when he became inspector general of this service. In 1819 Rohault de Fleury was named an honorary member of the council of civil buildings. He began the Code de la voire (street regulations), which was completed by his son, Charles. In 1821 and 1822 the council of civil buildings proposed, based on Hubert's report, regulations that did not limit the width of streets but that required that they be in proportion to the height of the buildings. Hubert Rohault de Fleury was an architect of hospices in Paris from 1817 to 1833. In 1821 he was made responsible for the gendarmerie and fire brigade barracks, and for the halls and markets of the city. In this position he designed the fish and butter markets in 1821, the fire brigade barracks in the rue de la Paix (1823), conversion of the old hotel of the Marshall d'Ancre into a gendarmerie barracks (1823) and the barracks of the Republican Guard on rue Mouffetard (1824). This last was completed by his son Charles Rohault de Fleury, who was also an architect. The barracks on rue Mouffetard are his best-known work, and show his love of Italian architecture. In 1824 Rohault de Fleury was named inspector general of civil buildings in the departments, and became a member of the council of civil buildings. In the late 1820s he restored the chapel of the Orphelins. He was made a knight of the Legion of Honour in 1828. In 1828 he was made inspector general of the first division of civil buildings of Paris and also placed in charge of the barracks of the municipal guard and the fire brigade, holding this position until 1837. In 1832 he was named architect for the city's markets. Hubert Rohault de Fleury died in 1846. The drawings he brought back from Italy fascinated his grandson Georges Rohault de Fleury, who became a distinguished writer on Italian monuments.

It has a history dating to the 18th century, and includes one Holden's oldest brick houses. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Description and history The Brown-Davis-Frost Farm is located in a rural area of western Holden. The property includes pasture and woodland. The farm complex is on the west side of Whitney Street, a short way north of its junction with Princeton Street. The focal point is the farmhouse, a 2-1/2 story brick structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof, four end chimneys, and a granite foundation. The complex also includes a barn, workshop, and garage, the latter now converted into a kennel, as well as a few smaller structures. The house's main facade is nearly symmetrical, with paired bays on the outside set off from the slightly off- enter central bay, where the entrance is located. There is no significant ornamentation or trim around any of the exterior elements. The farmhouse is difficult to date because of its vernacular appearance. Local historians believe it may have been built as early as 1763 by Isaiah Brown, and as late as 1795, by Ethan Davis, making it one of the town's few 18th-century brick houses. Brown, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War, sold property to Davis in 1799 that may have included this house, and Davis later sold it to Dana Frost. The farm was, at the time of its listing on the National Register, believed by the then-owner to be the oldest operating farm in Holden.

Construction of the line began in 1852, and by the start of the Civil War, of track had been laid west from Eunice. The railroad was completed after the war, but was abandoned in 1875 after flooding on the Mississippi River damaged the railbed and bridges. Arkansas Highway 208 between Eunice and Halley was built on top of the abandoned railbed. Civil War On June 14, 1863, Confederate rebels at Eunice fired artillery onto the Union gunboat USS Marmora. The Marmora returned fire, and then anchored at Eunice. The next morning, the union gunboat Nebraska was fired upon as it approached Eunice. Both the Marmora and Nebraska bombarded the town with artillery, and then sent a party ashore. The soldiers set fire to stores, houses, and the railroad depot, destroying the town. The commander of the Marmora reported: \\"not a single vestige of the town of Eunice remains\\". No rebels were found. Today The Yellow Bend Port--a modern industrial port, harbor and turning basin--is located on the original townsite. Nothing remains of Eunice.

Description and history The house is set on the west side of Manning Street, in the northeastern part of the rural town of Holden. The main house is a 1-1/2 story wood-frame structure, four bays wide, with a side gable roof, central chimney, and stone foundation. Modern additions extend the house to the right and rear. The main entrance, in the bay second from left, is flanked by sidelight windows, with otherwise simple framing topped by a cornice. The interior of the main block has retained much original detail, including its fireplaces, wide wainscoting, and wide pine flooring in the kitchen. The floor plan is a central hall plan modified because the house is not a typical five bays wide, with a larger parlor and a smaller hall space on either side of the chimney, and the kitchen behind. Modern facilities have been built into the ells. The house was built c. 1790 by Captain Israel Manning, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War. Manning's son sold a portion of his father's original tract, with this house, to Josiah Ball, who had married his sister. The house remained in the hands of Ball descendants until 1947. At some point in the 20th century it was converted into a two-family, but has since been restored to single-family use. The house is unusual in Holden as a four-bay Cape, and is well-preserved for its age.

Henke is an American geochemist and former instructor at the University of Kentucky's department of Geology. He currently works as a senior research scientist at the University of Kentucky's Center for Applied Energy Research. He is well known for his criticism of young earth creationism and the scientific arguments they make for a young earth. In particular, he has been critical of the RATE project's results, which claim to show that zircons contain too much helium to be billions of years old, and has argued that Russell Humphreys, a young-earth creationist who was involved in the project, has made errors in his research. These flaws include that, according to Henke, \\"The vast majority of Humphreys et al.'s critical a, b, and Q/Q0 values that are used in these \\"dating\\" equations are either missing, poorly defined, improperly measured or inaccurate.\\" Henke has also accused Humphreys of misidentifying his specimens, fudging his data, and not considering the possibility of helium contamination in this research. He has also criticized John Woodmorappe for arguing that radiometric dating is unreliable. On one occasion, Henke called Kent Hovind on the phone regarding Hovind's $250,000 challenge to \\"prove\\" evolution. Hovind told Henke that in order to win the money he would have to recreate the Big Bang in a laboratory. Henke responded by proposing several alternative \\"proofs\\" that pertained to geology (his field of expertise), but Hovind refused, saying that the project must be chosen by him and it must not pertain to the area in which Henke has scientific expertise. Hovind therefore required Henke to prove that dogs and bananas had a common ancestor, and lowered the award to only $2,000 should he succeed. Henke accepted the challenge, and later drafted a contract, which was then posted on Talk.origins. However, one of Henke's requirements was that the judges be unbiased, and Hovind rejected the challenge for this reason, insisting that he should be the only one who can choose the judges.

Early life and education Christopher Grant La Farge was born in New York City, the son of the architect Christopher Grant LaFarge and Florence Bayard Lockwood LaFarge, granddaughter of James A. Bayard Jr., a U.S. Senator from Delaware. His paternal grandfather was the painter and stained-glass artist John La Farge and his younger brother Oliver Hazard Perry also became a novelist. He grew up in New York City and in Saunderstown, Rhode Island, and later moved to the family farm (named The River Farm) near Saunderstown, which was given to him by his father. He attended St. Bernard's School (New York) and Groton School (Massachusetts). La Farge, known as \\"Kipper\\" to friends and family, enrolled in Harvard College in 1915, but his college career was interrupted by World War I. After reserve officer training in Plattsburgh, NY, in 1916 and in 1918, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the cavalry. Discharged after four months in France, he returned to college. While at Harvard, he was an editor for the Harvard Advocate literary magazine. He graduated from Harvard with a B.A. in 1920 and went on to complete a B.S. from the School of Architecture at the University of Pennsylvania in 1923. In June 1923, he married Louisa Ruth Hoar (1898‚Äì1945), daughter of Congressman Rockwood Hoar of Massachusetts and stepdaughter of Congressman Frederick H. Gillett. President and Mrs. Warren G. Harding attended the wedding.\\"The President and Mrs. Harding Attend Miss Hoar's Wedding\\". Chicago Daily Tribune, June 19, 1923, p. 23. They had two children: the cardiologist Christopher Grant Champlin La Farge (born 1928) and the writer William Ellis Rice ‚ÄúWER‚Äù La Farge (1930‚Äì1994). Louisa died of cancer in 1945, and in 1946 La Farge married Violet Amory Loomis (1918‚Äì2009), with whom he had a son, the writer Thomas Sargeant La Farge, born in 1947. With this marriage, he also gained two stepchildren, biologist and University of California, San Diego, professor William Farnsworth Loomis (1940‚Äì2016) and Joan Loomis. Architectural career From 1924 to 1931, La Farge worked as a designer for the New York architectural firm of McKim, Mead & White. During this period, he also exhibited his watercolors at such New York art galleries as Ferargil (1930) and Wildenstein (1931). Following the success of his brother Oliver‚Äôs novel about Navajo Indian life, Laughing Boy, La Farge worked with his father on exhibits of Native American arts at the Brooklyn Museum. In 1931, he left McKim, Mead & White to join his father‚Äôs architectural firm of La Farge, Warren, and Clark (later renamed La Farge and Son). In 1933, he designed a monument to the Jesuit missionary Andrew White in Maryland near St. Mary's City.La Farge, John, S.J. The Manner Is Ordinary. New York: Harcourt Brace, 1954, pp. 217-18. However, the Great Depression drove the firm out of business, and La Farge abandoned architecture as a career. Writing career In 1932, La Farge moved his family to Kent, England, where he wrote his first novel, Hoxsie Sells His Acres (1934), a verse chronicle about a Rhode Island landowner who decides to sell his farmland for development. La Farge‚Äôs goal in writing his novel in verse was to \\"make this a comprehensible form as interesting as the novel in prose and more moving.\\"\\"Christopher Grant La Farge.\\" Dictionary of American Biography, Supplement 6: 1956‚Äì1960. American Council of Learned Societies, 1980. In 1934, he moved back to the United States, where he split his time between Rhode Island and New York. Several of his subsequent books were also set in Rhode Island, and he became known as a skillful observer of this region. He also began contributing stories and poems to magazines like the New Yorker, The American, Harper's, and the Saturday Review of Literature. His second novel, Each to the Other (1939), was also written in verse. Its plot revolved around the domestic difficulties of a father and a son, and at least one reviewer saw in it reflections of La Farge‚Äôs own life. It was a Book-of-the-Month-Club selection and won the Benson Silver medal of the London Royal Society of Literature. La Farge's third novel, The Sudden Guest (1946, written in prose), was likewise a Book-of-the- Month-Club selection. Set in Rhode Island, its central character is an unpleasant old woman who reminisces about the great New England Hurricane of 1938 as she prepares for the arrival of another hurricane. With its acutely observed protagonist‚Äîself-righteous, rigid, and anti-Semitic‚Äîthe story forms a parable intended to remind Americans of the cost of isolationism. It was LaFarge‚Äôs most successful book, selling more than half a million copies. His last verse novel, Beauty for Ashes (1953), was a novel of relationships revolving around a beautiful young woman and three men in rural Rhode Island. During World War II, La Farge was an active member of the Authors' League of America and the Writers' War Board.Laskin, Franklin T. \\"All Rights Reserved: The Author's Lost Property in Publishing and Entertainment.\\" Copyright L. Symp. Vol. 7. 1956. In 1943, Harper's magazine sent him to the South Pacific as a war correspondent. \\"His intention,\\" wrote Newsweek, \\"was to report the war not with named and dated facts, but deliberately in the form of fiction.\\" The stories he wrote on this assignment were later published together under the title East by Southwest (1944). La Farge published two other volumes of short stories, many of which had previously appeared in the New Yorker. In 1941, he collected ten stories he had written about a single family under the title The Wilsons; his first work in prose, it was described as a \\"wicked and graceful...study of American snobbism.\\" And in 1949, he reprinted seventeen of his favorite stories, with prefatory comments, as All Sorts and Kinds (1949). La Farge‚Äôs one published play, Mesa Verde (1945), was originally conceived as an opera libretto and is notable for including Navajo speech and phraseology. Coward-McCann, his publisher, printed a collection of his poetry, Poems and Portraits, in 1940. La Farge wrote occasional book reviews and articles, as well, such as a 1954 analysis of the reactionary elements in Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer novels.Whiting, Frederick. \\"Bodies of Evidence: Post-War Detective Fiction and the Monstrous Origins of the Sexual Psychopath.\\" Yale Journal of Criticism 18:1 (2005), pp. 149-178. La Farge was one of a group of high- profile writers including Pearl Buck, Clifton Fadiman, Upton Sinclair, and John Dos Passos who came together in 1945 to found a new, cooperative, ad-free magazine that would be owned and controlled by writers and artists. The first issue of this short-lived publication came out in 1947 under the title '47, the Magazine of the Year.Ellison, Jerome. \\"When Howells' Pipedream Came True.\\" The New England Quarterly, 42:2 (1969), pp. 253-260. La Farge died suddenly of a stroke in Providence, Rhode Island, having just started another novel in verse. Many of his letters and manuscripts are held in the collections of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, New York Public Library, University of Buffalo, University of Chicago, and Yale and Harvard universities. His diaries are housed at the Houghton Library, Harvard University. In 2017 he was inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame.\\"Latest News\\".

He attended Boston College High School and in 1911 entered the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) teaching at Regis High School (New York City). He then studied in Spain and completed his theology studies in Valkenburg, South Holland, the Netherlands, where he was ordained a priest on August 27, 1925. He worked in administration at Boston College and as rector of the Jesuit novitiate in Massachusetts. In the fall of 1931, at the behest of Pope Pius XI, the New York Province Jesuits opened a secondary school in Baghdad, Iraq, and Rice was given charge of the project as Jesuit Superior.Baghdad College He was a scholarly priest and fluent in several languages.

On April 16, 1939, he was consecrated in Boston by Bishop Thomas Emmet, S.J., the Vicar Apostolic of Jamaica. The principal co-consecrators were Bishop Thomas O'Leary of Springfield in Massachusetts and Archbishop Francis Spellman of New York. Rice arrived in Belize on June 18, 1939, at the age of 47. His predecessor Bishop Joseph Anthony Murphy bequeathed to him a mission field with 24 priests (all but 2 were Jesuits) and 4 Jesuit brothers, greatly assisted by religious sisters: 36 Sisters of Mercy, 7 Sisters of the Holy Family, and 53 Pallottines.Woods, Charles M.

The six parish churches had more than fifty outlying missions. Rice's home parish would be Holy Redeemer in Belize City. Work as bishop left The Bishop leaned toward the intellectual and artistic side. He promoted Gregorian chant, strove to develop good choirs at the cathedral, and encouraged the congregation to participate through singing, personally leading the children in hymn practice. It was also during Rice's term that the pioneering work of Marion M. Ganey, initiator of credit unions and cooperatives in Belize, the Fiji Islands, and South Pacific, began. These proved instrumental in the economic development of the peoples of these areas.

Early life and education  Born in 1928, Tilson served in the Royal Air Force (1946‚Äì49), after which he studied in London at St Martin's School of Art (1949‚Äì52) and the Royal College of Art (1952‚Äì55), where he received the Rome Prize, which took him to Italy for a year in 1955. He returned to London in 1957, and from 1958 to 1963 he taught at St Martin's School of Art, and subsequently taught at the Slade School of Fine Art, University College London and The School of Visual Arts, New York and the Hochschule fur Bildende Kunste, Hamburg. In 1961 he exhibited at the Paris Biennale.  Career  During the 1960s Tilson became one of the leading figures associated with the British Pop Art movement. Making use of his previous experience as a carpenter and joiner, Tilson produced wooden reliefs and constructions as well as prints and paintings. As a student at the RCA Tilson associated with Frank Auerbach, Leon Kossoff, R. B. Kitaj, Peter Blake, Allen Jones, Patrick Caulfield and David Hockney. His first one-man show was held at the Marlborough Gallery, London in 1962. In 1977 he joined the Waddington Galleries and also exhibited at the Alan Cristea Gallery and the Gi√≤ Marconi Galleries in Milan. Tilson's work gained an international reputation when shown at the XXXII Venice Biennale in 1964, which led to a retrospective at the Boyman's Museum, Rotterdam in 1964. Further retrospective exhibitions followed at the Vancouver Art Gallery in 1979 and the Arnolfini Gallery, Bristol in 1984. Growing disillusionment with the consumer society led to a change in Tilson work in the 1970s. After moving to Wiltshire in 1972, Tilson began to use a wider variety of materials, including stone, straw and rope in an effort to transcend time and culture by drawing on the motifs of pre-Classical mythology. This body of work was called Alchera. Tilson's work has been exhibited regularly in solo shows throughout the world: Cortona Centro Culturale Fontanella Borghese, Rome (1990), Plymouth City Museum (1991), Palazzo Pubblico, Siena (1995), Mestna Gallery, Ljubljana (1996) and Galleria Comunale d'Arte, Cesena (2000). Recently a major retrospective was held at the Royal Academy of Arts, London (2002). Among Tilson's awards are the Gulbenkian Foundation Prize (1960) and the Grand Prix d'Honneur, Biennale of Ljubljana (1996). He is a Royal Academician and his career was celebrated with a retrospective exhibition in 2002 at the Royal Academy 'Joe Tilson: Pop to Present' (Sackler Galleries) from April 2002. He was also invited to paint the banner for the \\"Palio\\", Siena in 1996. In 2019, he was commissioned make an installation for the Swatch Pavilion at the Venice Biennial inspired by his 'Stones of Venice' works. He also designed a limited edition watch as part of the project.https://www.wallpaper.com/watches-and-jewellery/swatch-joe-tilson- venice-biennale He is represented by Marlborough Fine Art, London and Alan Cristea Gallery, London.

A later source (Illinois Supreme Court website) gives March 3, 1843. ‚Äì February 6, 1913) was an American attorney and politician from Kentucky, United States. He spent most of his life in Quincy, Illinois, where he was a partner in a successful law practice. Carter was elected to two terms in the Illinois House of Representatives starting in 1878. He was elected to the Supreme Court of Illinois in 1894, serving one nine-year term. Biography Joseph Newton Carter was born in Hardin County, Kentucky on March 12, 1843. He attended public schools and assisted on the family farm. In 1857, his family moved with him to Charleston, Illinois, then to Douglas County the following year. Upon graduating from school, he taught at another school. He served a three-month stint with the 70th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment in the Civil War. In 1863, he was accepted at Illinois College in Jacksonville, Illinois, graduating there years later. He then studied law at the University of Michigan Law School in Ann Arbor, Michigan, graduating in 1868. Carter returned to Illinois in July 1869, settling in Quincy. There, he was admitted to the bar and established a law practice with William H. Govert. In 1878, he was elected as a Republican to the Illinois House of Representatives for the 37th district. He was re-elected in 1880 to another two-year term. In 1882, he ran on the Republican ticket for election to the Illinois Senate, but lost in a close election to Maurice Kelly. He was, however, elected to serve a special session that redistricted the state congressional and senatorial districts. Carter was the Republican candidate for Lieutenant Governor of Illinois under Joseph W. Fifer in 1892, but the Democratic ticket of John Peter Altgeld and Joseph B. Gill was successful instead.

Camden Town Brewery is a Camden, London-based brewery founded in 2010, and owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev since 2015. History The brewery was founded by Jasper Cuppaidge (born 1975), the grandson of Laurie McLaughlin, who ran McLaughlin‚Äôs Brewery in Rockhampton, Australia from 1910-1960, along with an estate of 60 pubs. During the mid-1990s, Cuppaidge missed his flight back home to Australia and consequently remained in England, collecting glasses in a London pub. Ten years later, he purchased a dilapidated Hampstead pub and reopened it in 2006 as The Horseshoe, serving food, wine, and beer. Cuppaidge brewed his first batch of beer, named Mac's Beer in honour of his grandfather, at The Horseshoe in 2007 as a birthday present for his mother, Patricia. Based on one of McLaughlin's old recipes, the beer proved successful with the pub's customers, and Cuppaidge began to sell it to his pub-owner friends. In 2009, he began to pursue a full-time business in brewing lager, but discovered that the name Mac's was already in use by another brewing company. Inspired by the borough in which he lived, he typed www.camdentownbrewery.com into a search engine, noticed the domain name was available, and bought it on the spot. Shortly after, Cuppaidge rented five Victorian railway arches underneath Kentish Town West Station. By Spring 2010, Camden Town Brewery officially started brewing. Hells Lager, a cross between Helles and Pilsner brewed with malt and hops sourced from Germany, debuted in Autumn 2010, and is now brewed and sold alongside a collection of core beers and occasional releases. In December 2015, it was announced that Camden Town Brewery was being bought by the world's largest brewer, Anheuser-Busch InBev, for about ¬£85 million. The Guardian noted that \\"Cuppaidge, his family and three best friends own 95% of the company‚Äôs equity, suggesting that they have shared a combined payout of more than ¬£80m.\\" James Watt, the founder of the BrewDog craft beer company, said that they would cease selling Camden Town products in its bars, \\"because it does not sell drinks made by AB InBev\\". Camden Town Brewery built a new brewery in Enfield by the banks of the River Lee, 12 miles north of their Kentish Town brewery. Completed in Spring 2017, the new brewery will allow production to move to Enfield while the current branch at Wilkin Street Mews is renovated into a pilot brewery.

He was particularly known for his trees of life sculptures and received various awards for his work, including the Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes in 1996. He taught the craft to his wife and five children who continue to create pieces in his style in the family workshop. The artisan Castillo Orta was born in Iz√∫car de Matamoros, Puebla, which has been a pottery center for many generations. It is one of two centers for ceramic sculptures called Trees of Life, along with Metepec, State of Mexico. Originally these depicted the story of Adam and Eve and were created as wedding gifts. View of a display area in the family home and workshop in Izucar de Matamoros Castillo Orta was a fourth generation potter, he learned to craft from his mother and grandfather, helping his mother at the family workshop when he was twelve. Along with his siblings, he began making utilitarian pieces along with candle holders and incense burners. However over his more than 40-year career, he experimented with more decorative pieces, refining his techniques to create his own unique style. He became particularly noted for his inventive trees of life, diversifying themes to include mole, other religious stories and festivals such as Day of the Dead . Castillo Orta became the center of popular art in Iz√∫car de Matamoros, leading the other artisans and making the town's polychromatic pottery known internationally. The artisan's work has been exhibited in venues in Mexico, such as the Amparo Museum and in various other countries, especially in the United States where he had exhibitions in Chicago, Dallas, New York, Washington, San Diego, Philadelphia and other cities starting in 1988, as well as Germany, Austria and Spain. His work can be found in collections of the London Museum, the Kunsthaus in Munich and the royal family of Spain along with collections in Germany, Japan, Venezuela and Italy. One of his most notable pieces is Homage to Mole, which is featured in the Grandes Maestros book of the Fomento Cultural Banamex. It is four feet high in Baroque style and dedicated to one of Mexico's signature dishes. This piece took six months. Castillo Orta's work received numerous awards and recognitions, including the Premio Nacional de Artesan√≠as ‚ÄúLas Manos de M√©xico‚Äù of FONART in 1993 and the Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes directly from President Ernesto Zedillo in 1996. (abetran) Other awards include first place at the Consurso Diciembre en la Tradici√≥n Popular of the Secretar√≠a de Educaci√≥n P√∫blica in 1985, first place at the Gran Premio de Arte Popular in 1992 and 1994, an honorable mention at the Candelero Traditional competition of UNESCO in Havana in 1995, and the title of ‚Äúgrand master‚Äù by the Fomento Cultural Banamex in 2001. The family Castillo Orta is survived by his wife, Marta Hern√°ndez B√°ez and five children Veronica, Alfonso, Marco Antonio, Martha Angelica and Patricia as well as various grandchildren. He taught his wife the craft after they married and they in turn taught their children. Today, the family continues Alfonso's work in the family home at Callejon del Partidor #3 in the San Mart√≠n Huaquechula neighborhood of Iz√∫car de Matamoros keeping to the style the Alfonso originated. The family home serves as a workshop (in the central courtyard) as well as a gallery and museum, open to visitors. Most of the work found here is either for display only, such as a tree of life dedicated to Frida Kahlo or those destined for pre-existing orders. The pieces are made from local clay, with firing done in a wood kiln. After firing, they are coated in a white paint that served as the background then decorative elements are added with tempura paints using natural pigments such as indigo for blue and cochineal for red. The family is still best known for trees of life with elements ranging from Catrinas, angels, demons, warriors, skeletons, musicians and more. In addition, they made skeletal figures for Day of the Dead, incense holders and other ceremonial pieces, and figures of farm workers and carpenters, reflecting the family's occupations before they became full-time potters. The pieces are capricious and with a sense of irony, reflecting influence from Jos√© Guadalupe Posada . The family still has pieces exhibited abroad with the largest piece created being a 3.7-meter tree of life, made in nine sections so that it could be transported to the buyer.

Under the guillotine clause, if only one treaty or contract is either not accepted by an involved party or canceled later, all treaties or contracts are then deemed not accepted or terminated. That prevents a party from cherry-picking the treaties of the contract package that it supports if the other party considers it to be essential for all of the contract package to be enforced. The guillotine clause in treaties of the European Union with other countries is the most notable case of its use. Switzerland An example of the guillotine clause is found in the body of bilateral treaties between the European Union to Switzerland. The treaties give Switzerland access to the internal market if Switzerland follow its rules. The clause states that if any of the seven treaties are to be terminated, all of the treaties are automatically terminated. Also, later changes in the underlying EU directives must be accepted by Switzerland. One reason for the creation of this clause is that the more cumbersome decision-making processes of the European Union would make it difficult for it to respond to the termination of other contracts if Switzerland terminated them. In 2009, Switzerland accepted a change to one of the treaties, the treaty on free movement, by extending it to the new EU countries. That was relatively controversial in Switzerland, but it was passed in a referendum and so the guillotine clause was not invoked. After the success of the 2014 Swiss referendum to limit EU immigration through quotas, the invocation of guillotine clause has been suggested to terminate all the other agreements signed since 1999. The EU has claimed that the bilateral treaties already give Switzerland more cherry-picking in its relation to the EU than any other country of which Switzerland should be allowed no more than now.Council of the European Union, 8 Jan 2013: Council conclusions on EU relations with EFTA countries Switzerland has a deadline in 2017 to achieve a negotiated solution.https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/19/eu-deal- switzerland-immigration-uk-eurosceptics European Economic Area EU also has guillotine clauses in the EEA agreements with Norway (2001), Iceland (2001), and Liechtenstein (2008), which must directly accept both existing and added EU directives within several fields relating to trade (except food) free movement and the internal market. Refusing such directives would give the EU the right to terminate the entire EEA agreement and so the EEA countries have avoided doing so.

Drunk driving arrest Youngblood was arrested on May 20, 2018 at a sobriety checkpoint under suspicion of driving under the influence. According to police, Youngblood smelled of alcohol and her speech was slurred. She was placed under arrest after performing poorly on field sobriety tests and refusing to take a breathalyzer test. Youngblood made several statements regarding her position as a legislator to the arresting officers. She was recorded on tape telling police, \\"I literally fight for you guys.\\" According to the New Mexico Governmental Conduct Act, it is a criminal offense for public officials to use their offices to obtain personal benefits. The state attorney general, Hector Balderas, announced that his office would investigate whether Youngblood illegally used her official position in an attempt to influence police during her arrest. As a legislator, she had been a vocal supporter of harsher DUI penalties. She also introduced legislation to bring Lyft and Uber to New Mexico, due to the drunk driving problem in the state. Youngblood maintained her innocence and requested a jury trial, which was denied by the judge. After a bench trial which lasted nearly four hours, she was found guilty of aggravated drunken driving. She was represented in court by Paul Kennedy, a former justice of the New Mexico Supreme Court. She was sentenced to the mandatory minimum of 48 hours in jail (with credit for one day served), in addition to mandatory use of an ignition interlock for one year, attendance at DUI school, completion of 24 hours of community service and payment of court costs and fees.

It would allow small companies to choose a tick size of $0.05 or $0.10 instead of the standard $0.01. To participate, companies would need to have stock prices of over $1.00 and revenues of less than $750 million. It was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background left In financial markets, a tick size is the smallest increment (tick) by which the price of stocks, futures contracts or other exchange-traded instrument can move. Current rules from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates the stock market, set the tick at $0.01 increments. This change was made in 2000 with the goal of increasing trading in large company stocks, but it had the side effect of reducing the trading on small company stocks. This pilot program would enable smaller companies to choose larger tick sizes that would \\"increase the liquidity and capital availability necessary for emerging... companies to be successful on the public market.\\" Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Small Cap Liquidity Reform Act of 2013 would amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to establish a liquidity pilot program for securities of emerging growth companies (EGC) with total annual gross revenues of less than $750 million, under which those securities shall be quoted using either: (1) a minimum increment of $0.05, (2) a minimum increment of $0.10, or (3) the increment at which the securities would be quoted without regard to such minimum increments. The bill would repeal the requirement for a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) study examining the transition to trading and quoting securities in one penny increments, known as decimalization. The bill would require EGC securities quoted at a minimum increment of $0.05 or $0.10 to be traded at either such minimum increment or at one permitted by SEC regulations. The bill would prescribe procedures for an EGC board of directors to elect either to opt out or to change the minimum increment. The bill would prescribe pricing and trading procedures governing securities trading below $1.00. The bill would direct the SEC to require an EGC under this Act to submit additional reports and disclosures. The bill would shield an issuer from liability for losses caused solely by the quoting or trading of its securities at a minimum increment of $0.05, $0.10, or another SEC-authorized increment. The bill would direct the SEC to report biannually to Congress on: (1) the quoting and trading of securities in increments permitted by this Act, and (2) the extent to which such quoting and trading increases liquidity and active trading by incentivizing capital commitment, research coverage, and brokerage support. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Financial Services on November 13, 2013. This is a public domain source. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 3448 would have an insignificant effect on gross spending by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to establish a pilot program that would change the minimum increment that the price of a stock could change (the tick size) for certain securities. Pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply to this legislation because it would not affect direct spending or revenues. H.R. 3448 would establish a five-year program that would allow the price of securities issued by smaller companies to change in increments of 5 or 10 cents, rather than the penny increments that are currently the standard for most stocks traded on U.S. stock exchanges. Under the pilot program the SEC would set the tick size for certain small companies at 5 cents; however, those companies would have the option to select a 10-cent increment. Further, the program would allow a one-time option to change the tick size from 5 cents to 10 cents or vice versa. H.R. 3448 also would require the SEC to submit biannual reports to the Congress showing the extent to which different tick sizes are affecting liquidity and trading activity. CBO expects that changes in the workload of the SEC to implement the pilot program would not be significant because the agency has already begun efforts to develop such a program. H.R. 3448 would impose intergovernmental and private-sector mandates, as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA), by providing liability protection to issuers of securities of companies participating in the pilot program. Such issuers would not be liable for any losses caused by the quoting or trading of their securities at increments established under the program. Providing such protection would impose a mandate on both public and private investors that would otherwise be able to sue the issuers to recover losses related to tick size. The protection also would impose an intergovernmental mandate by preempting state and local liability laws. The cost of the mandate would be the forgone value of awards and settlements in such claims. Because the securities of companies covered by the liability protection are more risky than other securities, few public entities invest in them, and those that do limit the size of such investments. Consequently, CBO estimates that any potential losses tied to the mandate would be small. In addition, the costs, if any, of the preemption would be small because it would impose no duty that would result in additional spending or a loss of revenues. Therefore, CBO estimates the cost to public entities of complying with the mandates in the bill would fall below the annual threshold for intergovernmental mandates established in UMRA ($76 million in 2014, adjusted annually for inflation). Because of uncertainty about both the value of awards in such cases and the number of claims that would be filed in the absence of this provision, CBO cannot estimate the level of potential awards or settlements that would otherwise accrue to private investors. Therefore, CBO cannot determine whether the cost of the mandate would exceed the annual threshold established in UMRA for private-sector mandates ($152 million in 2014, adjusted annually for inflation). In addition to those mandates, the bill would impose a private- sector mandate on companies in the pilot program established in the bill by requiring them to notify the SEC if they elect to not participate. Based on information from the SEC, CBO estimates that the cost to comply with that mandate would be minimal. Procedural history The Small Cap Liquidity Reform Act of 2013 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on November 12, 2013 by Rep. Sean P. Duffy (R, WI-7). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Financial Services, which held a consideration and markup session on November 14, 2013. The committee ordered the bill reported (amended) with a vote of 57-0 on November 14, 2013. The bill was reported alongside House Report 113-342 on February 5, 2014. On February 7, 2014, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that H.R. 3448 would be on the House schedule for February 11 or 12th, 2014, to be considered under a suspension of the rules. Debate and discussion The Biotechnology Industry Organization spoke out in favor of the bill, with President Jim Greenwood saying that \\"the current one-size-fits-all tick size does not reflect the realities of the market and subjects smaller issuers to the same trading framework as large, multinational companies with exponentially higher trading volumes and market caps.\\" Greenwood went on to say that \\"BIO supports the Small Cap Liquidity Reform Act because it takes into account the unique nature of the trading environment that small companies face as well as the high capital burden of biotech R&D.;\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress Notes/ReferencesExternal links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 3448 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 3448 *GovTrack.us H.R. 3448 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 3448 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 3448 *House Report 113-342 on h.R. 3448 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress ","title":"Small Cap Liquidity Reform Act of 2013"},{"id":"41902310","text":"Members of the Azerbaijani Special Forces during a military parade in Baku 2011 The Special Forces of Azerbaijan is a military unit of the Republic of Azerbaijan.

The film is an unofficial remake of the 1962 American film Carnival of Souls. Yella premiered at the 57th Berlin International Film Festival where Hoss won the Silver Bear for Best Actress award. Plot Following a separation from her husband, Yella Fichte (Nina Hoss) plans to leave Wittenberge for a new accountancy job in Hannover. Her husband, Ben (Hinnerk Sch√∂nemann), insists on giving her a ride to the train station. She reluctantly agrees. When she refuses to return to him, he becomes abusive and won't let her out of the car. He drives through a bridge siding into a river. They both escape the crash, but Yella leaves him unconscious on the shoreline and catches her train. On her arrival, she is approached by Philipp (Devid Striesow), a businessman, about becoming his assistant. She doesn't give him a firm answer. The next day, she discovers that the man who hired her no longer works for the company. The man convinces her to steal a portfolio from the office for him but rewards her by making a crude pass that she rebuffs. She plans to return to Wittenberge the next day and falls asleep with her door open. Philipp walks in, awakens her and renews his offer. She accepts. He involves her in a series of unethical moneymaking schemes using evidence of malfeasance to scam money out of competitors. Philipp tests her loyalty by asking her to make various deposits totaling ‚Ç¨75,000, but actually gives her ‚Ç¨100,000. She plans to keep the difference to bribe Ben to stay away, but Philipp catches her. She explains her situation and he forgives her. On separate occasions, Ben attempts to kidnap her and tries to bargain with her to return to him. Instead, his abusive gestures drive her into Philipp's arms. Philipp loses his job due to his unethical practices. He tells Yella that their scams were intended to raise money to begin a new enterprise, but he's short ‚Ç¨200,000. Yella blackmails one of his previous victims for the additional funds. As they wait for the man to deliver the money to them, Yella has a strange vision of him. When he doesn't arrive as expected, she is compelled to look for him. At the man's home, his wife helps Yella. They find him face down in a backyard pond. Philipp arrives and helps pull the body out of the water. He believes that Yella's threats drove him to suicide. The police are involved and Yella is arrested. As she is carted to jail, she finds herself back in Ben's car, going off the bridge. Wittenberge police pull Ben's car from the water and find Yella and Ben's bodies inside.

It's consensus reads, \\"Chilly and haunting, Yella's atmosphere gets under the skin.\\" Roger Ebert praised the film awarding it 3.5 out of 4 stars stating, \\"The writer-director, Christian Petzold, uses a spare, straightforward visual style for the most part, except for those cutaways to trees blowing in the wind whenever we heard the harsh bird cry. He trusts his story and characters. And he trusts us to follow the business deals and become engrossed in the intrigue.

Stephen Holden from The New York Times gave the film a positive review, praising the film's symbolism, atmosphere, and Hoss' performance; writing, \\"Yella is the kind of movie that tantalizes the mind with possibilities without solving the puzzle.\\" Time Out awarded the film four out of five stars, calling it \\"an expertly crafted thriller which offers a pessimistic, though deeply rewarding, glimpse of a society being haunted by its own past.\\" Walter Addiego of the San Francisco Chronicle praised the film's atmosphere, Petzold's direction, and Hoss' performance. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian rated the film four out of five stars, calling it \\"exquisitely frigid, menacing, disquieting, with a storyline that keeps you off-balance, marred only by a slightly hackneyed d√©nouement\\".

He is known for his studies of archaeology and monuments associated with the Christian Mass. Youth Georges Rohault de Fleury was born in Paris, France, on 23 November 1835. His father was Charles Rohault de Fleury (1801‚Äì1875) and his grandfather Hubert Rohault de Fleury (1777-1846), both architects. As a child he was fascinated by the architectural drawings his grandfather had brought back from his stay in Italy. His elder brother Hubert (1828‚Äì1910) became a painter, and was known for sponsoring the Basilica of Sacr√©-C≈ìur, Paris. Georges Rohault de Fleury traveled to Belgium in 1848, to London in 1851 to see The Great Exhibition and to Switzerland in 1852. Georges Rohault de Fleury was admitted to the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in 1855.

She gave cookery demonstrations both in England and further afield, and in September 2013 she opened her first restaurant, Romy's Kitchen. Style of cooking Gill's style of Indian cooking is very different from that found at the majority of Indian restaurants in the UK. She avoids the use of unnatural food colourings, and is a fan of combining Indian and British cuisine. She combines spices and flavours that she grew up with in India with ingredients that she was only introduced to when she moved to the UK, creating dishes such as gurnard cooked in coconut milk, tomatoes, tomato puree, ginger, garlic and her own spice blend; and monkfish marinated in turmeric and lemon juice, then cooked with onions, ginger, garlic, mustard seeds, 5 spice mix paste and her own spices. Restaurant Gill opened her first restaurant, Romy's Kitchen, in Thornbury, South Gloucestershire in September 2013. In order to open her restaurant, Gill applied to a number of banks for a loan, but was turned down by every one apart from NatWest, providing her with the business loan that she needed to get her restaurant underway, leading her to be featured on the BBC News in a segment about the struggles that entrepreneurs face when trying to raise the necessary funds to start a new, local business. The restaurant closed in August 2019.

Bindoff (ed.), The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1509-1558 (from Boydell and Brewer 1982), History of Parliament Online. Life Waldegrave was born into a prosperous Suffolk family, the eldest son of Sir George Waldegrave of Smallbridge Hall, Bures St Mary, Suffolk and Anne Drury, the daughter of Sir Robert Drury of Hawstead, Suffolk. He was brought up at his maternal grandfather's house. The deaths within the space of 14 months of his paternal grandfather, Sir William Waldegrave, and his own father left him heir to a large estate and fortune at the age of 20. While on his deathbed, his father secured for Waldegrave an advantageous marriage to a Suffolk heiress. After inheriting the family estate, Waldegrave combined local administration with attendance at court and military service. He was knighted by Henry VIII at the coronation of Anne Boleyn, and headed the commission to take the Oath of Succession in Suffolk. He was known for his loyalty to the Crown and in the autumn of 1536 he was one of a group of men whom Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk believed would quell any rising in Suffolk. In 1542, Waldegrave served under the Duke of Norfolk's command in the war against Scotland, and two years later he captained 60 of his own men in the French campaign. His election to the Parliament of 1545 reflected this recent military experience as much as his own standing in Suffolk and may have been promoted by his uncle, Sir William Drury, as Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk. Although he was not to be re-elected, early in January 1553 the Council considered him for nomination with Sir William Drury as Knights of the Shire for Suffolk in the forthcoming Parliament, but in the event nominated Sir Henry Bedingfeld with Drury. Following Edward VI's death in the summer, William Cecil listed Waldegrave among potential supporters of Lady Jane Grey, but on being summoned to Kenninghall, Norfolk by Mary on 8 July 1553 he joined her in her successful bid for the throne. Later he heard the indictments in Suffolk against Jane's adherents. Family Waldegrave married Juliana, the daughter of Sir John Raysnford of Essex, with whom he had four children: *Dorothy Waldegrave, married Sir John Spring of Lavenham *Margaret Waldegrave *Mary Waldegrave *Sir William Waldegrave, married firstly Elizabeth (d.1581), daughter of Thomas Mildmay and secondly Grizelda, daughter of William Paget, 1st Baron Paget While on a visit to Calais late in 1554, perhaps in connection with the arrival of Cardinal Pole, Waldegrave fell sick. He died there on the following 12 December.For notes on the Waldegrave tombs at Bures, see E.A. Martin, 'Excursions: 19th June 2013. Bures St Mary Church', in C Paine (ed.), 'Excursions 2013.

The principal co-consecrators were Bishops Edward A. Fitzgerald of Winona and John J. McEleney, S.J., of Kingston in Jamaica. Hodapp was the sixth bishop to serve in Belize and the second since it became a diocese.

The leaves are trifoliate and grow up to 6.3 cm (2.5 inches) long. The leaflets are rounded with a blunt tip. The flowers are white to pink with a few white spots near the center. The seed pods are broken into sections called loments, where the outer layer of the fruit is constricted between the seeds so that when the pod is ripe it can break easily into individual segments. These are covered with hooked hairs so that they can easily become attached to fur or to clothing and be carried some distance before falling to the ground and germinating.Gray, Asa.

With no political or religious affiliations, The Forgiveness Project's independent and inclusive approach ensures its core message ‚Äì that everyone has the potential to change their perspective and break the cycle of vengeance ‚Äì resonates across all cultures.  Aims  The charity's goals are centred on: * Awareness: Raise the debate about forgiveness by collecting and sharing personal stories. * Education: Encourage and empower people to explore the nature of forgiveness and alternatives to conflict and revenge. * Transformation: Engage civil society, as well as transform hearts and minds, help individuals cope with their trauma.  History  The charity was founded in 2004 by Marina Cantacuzino, a journalist who in the build up to the Iraq War began to gather personal stories from people whose lives had been affected by violence and terrorism but who had learned to forgive and move on. Cantacuzino spent all of 2003 collecting stories of reconciliation and forgiveness for an exhibition of words and images which she created with the photographer Brian Moody. These stories subsequently formed the basis of The Forgiveness Project's The F Word exhibition.  Concept of rehabilitative storytelling  Central to their work is the sharing of personal accounts about people's transformative journeys. Having collected over 130 personal stories on their website, this is also done through its exhibition, The F Word, and via the award-winning programmes it runs within prisons, schools, community groups and companies. In providing tools that can facilitate conflict resolution and reconciliation, The Forgiveness Project encourages behavioural change and improves people's lives, whatever their story. These story-led initiatives operate at a local, national and international level and encourage individuals to reflect on their current perspective and their future life path. Rather than give advice or tell people what to think, The Forgiveness Project works by inviting those involved to see whether they can relate to the stories they hear and to take steps in trying to see a different perspective on their circumstances.  Themes  Stories collected by The Forgiveness Project follow multiple themes that the Project states \\"provide a framework to these forgiveness stories, adding a dimension to the narrative of hate, hurt, and healing.\\" These themes are feeling pain and anger, being curious, forgiving yourself, developing empathy, seeking revenge, transforming hate, and making meaning. The Forgiveness Project believes that analyzing the themes \\"shows that while forgiveness is not a linear process, and seldom a one-off event, nevertheless certain qualities and values feature in most of the stories.\\" * feeling pain and anger * being curious * forgiving yourself * developing empathy * seeking revenge * transforming hate * making meaning  Projects and programmes =The F Word exhibition This collection of thought-provoking narratives document personal tales of forgiveness and reconciliation around the world. The exhibition can be hired in a range of formats and regularly tours Germany, the UK and the USA. There are also permanent exhibitions in France, Kenya, South Africa and Sweden. The F Word exhibition has been displayed in more than 500 venues across 13 countries to an audience of over 60,000 people since being launched in London's Oxo Gallery in January 2004. The exhibition was described by the charity's founding patron, Anita Roddick Anita Roddick, as ‚Äútruly an education of the human spirit‚Äù. The Exhibition is made up of Storytellers, who engage others and share their traumas in order to help others heal. The Forgiveness Project: Stories for a Vengeful Age (book) An updated collection of some of the charity's stories which examine the charity's core themes of forgiveness, reconciliation and conflict transformation have been brought together into an illustrated 240-page book. Released in hardback by Jessica Kingsley Publishers on 26 March 2015, the book was written by founder Marina Cantacuzino and includes forewords from patron Desmond Tutu and Alexander McCall Smith. It has also been received endorsements from actress Emma Thompson, journalist and news presenter Jon Snow, historian and TV presenter Dan Snow, cultural thinker and founding faculty member of The School of Life in London, Roman Krznaric, Cambridge University professor Simon Baron- Cohen, humanitarian and former hostage Terry Waite and journalist Bel Mooney. Speaker‚Äôs Bureau The charity believes that hearing someone speak first- hand and being able to ask questions is the most powerful form of story- telling so over 30 of those who share their stories with The Forgiveness Project are also part of the charity's Speaker's Bureau. This facility allows schools, prisons, conferences and organisations hiring the F Word exhibition to have one of the featured storytellers on hand to share their experience of forgiveness. Annual lecture In addition to regular talks, The Forgiveness Project has also hosted five annual lectures to date. * 2010: The first annual lecture was delivered by Desmond Tutu in May 2010 at St John's, Smith Square. Tutu was joined by Mary Blewitt who lost 50 members of her family in the Rwandan genocide; Jo Berry whose father was killed in the 1984 Brighton hotel bombing; and Patrick Magee, the former IRA activist who planted the bomb. The event was chaired by BBC broadcaster Edward Stourton. * 2011: Clare Short delivered the second annual lecture on ‚ÄòNo Forgiveness Without Justice‚Äô on 6 October 2011 at Union Chapel, Islington. Chaired by Yasmin Alibhai-Brown of The Independent, Clare Short's lecture was preceded by Colin Parry, who lost his son in the IRA Warrington bomb in 1993, Elizabeth Turner, whose husband was killed while at a business meeting in the World Trade Centre on 11 September 2001, and Bassam Aramin, a Palestinian whose 10-year-old daughter was killed by an Israeli soldier and who is a founding member of Combatants for Peace. * 2012: Dr Gwen Adshead, forensic psychiatrist at Broadmoor High Security Hospital, who delivered the 2012 lecture at the Royal Geographical Society, supported on stage by Marian Partington whose sister was murdered by Fred and Rosemary West, Erwin James, the Guardian columnist and former prisoner who has served a life sentence for murder; and Kemal Pervanic, survivor of the notorious Ormaska concentration camp in Bosnia. * 2013: Professor Simon Baron-Cohen delivered the keynote speech on ‚ÄòZero degrees of empathy: exploring explanations of human cruelty and kindness‚Äô at the Royal Geographical Society. The lecture, chaired by Simon Fanshawe, was followed by a panel discussion with Marina Cantacuzino, Mary Foley, whose 15-year-old daughter Charlotte was murdered during a birthday party in East London in 2005, and Peter Woolf, a reformed career criminal. * 2017: 7th Annual lecture delivered by Richard Holloway October 11, 2017 at The Royal Geographical Society, chaired by Shani Chakrabarti. The Lecture \\"The Politics of Forgiveness\\" was about the complexity of Forgiveness. RESTORE programme RESTORE is the charity's intensive, group-based victim empathy programme for offenders that encourages the sharing of experiences within a framework influenced by Restorative Justice principles. The project has delivered over 160 programmes in custodial and non-custodial settings in England and Wales since 2007. Over nine years in the judicial system: The Restore Programme has helped over 3,ooo people including 180 Prison Officers. Co-facilitated by trained victims of crime and ex-offenders, the workshop leaders use their personal testimonies to encourage prisoners to take responsibility for their actions and change how they think and feel about their offending behaviour. =Link between RESTORE and restorative justice= Whilst Restorative Justice (RJ) traditionally focuses on bringing a victim and offender into communication, this process can be stalled if both parties aren‚Äôt at the same life stage. The Forgiveness Project's approach is to help offenders unravel their own stories and develop empathy by understanding the effect their actions have on others. This enables them to start the restorative process without being entirely dependent on their victim's willingness or availability to participate. In many cases, having encouraged behavioural change, the programme may result in the offender having the confidence, motivation and support to meet their victims as part of future RJ conferencing. RESTORE assists in victims‚Äô recovery by enabling them to play a role in the criminal justice system.  Recognition =Awards and commendations The organization has won recognition such as: * Longford Prize: In 2007, the charity received a ‚ÄòSpecial Commendation‚Äô from the Longford Prize judges, awarded for its ‚Äòremarkable work‚Äô in exploring and encouraging notions of forgiveness through grassroots projects, including in prisons. * Robin Corbett Award: In February 2014, the charity was highly commended by the Robin Corbett Award for Prisoner Rehabilitation 2014 for its involvement of trained former offenders, victims of crime and prison staff in the delivery of its group- based RESTORE programme. The runner-up prize of ¬£1,000 was presented by Lady Corbett and Lord Ramsbotham at the House of Lords in Westminster. Cantacuzino received a 2013 Winston Churchill Memorial Trust Travelling Fellowship which enabled her to spend five weeks visiting and learning from other restorative justice programmes in custodial and community settings in the US and Canada. Research and evaluation Independent evaluation was commissioned on the work of RESTORE within prisons and the effect that it has had on young offenders and adult prisoners who had participated in the programme. * 2009: In 2009, Lois Edmund, Ph.D., C.Psych., Associate Professor of Conflict Resolution Studies, University of Winnipeg, conducted a qualitative assessment based on the first 18 months of The Forgiveness Project's operations in prison. The report concluded that RESTORE ‚Äòresults in dramatic insight for many participants‚Äô, but ‚Äòfurther work is needed to evaluate the long-term learnings of the participants‚Äô. * 2012: To back up The Forgiveness Project's assertion that its work consistently demonstrates a shift in offenders‚Äô motivation to change the charity commissioned an independent evaluation of RESTORE from the Forensic Psychological Services at Middlesex University. The evaluation concluded that the intervention reduces recidivism and that those who completed the programme had improved general attitudes to offending, were less likely to anticipate re-offending, and less likely to evaluate crime as worthwhile. * 2013: The Forgiveness Project carried out extensive work at Ashfield Young Offenders Institute in Bristol where, with funding from the Home Office's Communities Against Gangs, Guns and Knives Fund, it was able to embed its RESTORE work into the fabric of the prison. In a report of this programme by cultural scientist Christian Straub, a member of the prison staff described RESTORE as ‚Äúvery powerful‚Äù because it ‚Äúdelivered a strong message gently‚Äù. Patrons and supporters Since Dame Anita Roddick first lent her support in advance of the inaugural The F Word exhibition in 2004, The Forgiveness Project has attracted endorsements and ongoing support from a number of high-profile organisations and individuals. The charity's patrons include Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Rt Hon the Lord Woolf, philanthropist Lady Edwina Grosvenor, actress Emma Thompson and comedian Shappi Khorsandi whilst supporters include Tony Benn, clothes designer Katharine Hamnett, actors Dame Helen Mirren and Linus Roache plus Terry Waite.

It is named for the tamarack tree, which inhabits the wetland. Numerous other species of plants and animals also inhabit the wetland. The total area of the wetland is 4000 acres. The Tamarack Swamp Natural Area is located in the wetland. Location and description Tamarack Swamp is located in northern Clinton County, Pennsylvania. It is northeast of the community of Tamarack and north of the borough of Renovo and close to Pennsylvania Route 144, which is near the western edge of the wetland. The wetland has a total area of 4000 acres. Its elevation is above sea level. Tamarack Swamp serves as the headwaters of Drury Run. Kettle Creek is located to the north of the wetland. Biology Tamarack Swamp is home to the tamarack tree, which is the only deciduous conifer in Pennsylvania. Most of the trees in it are boreal conifers, though black spruce, and balsam fir are also species of trees that live in the wetland. Plants living in the wetland include Hooker's orchid, soft-leaved sedge and small floating manna grass. Hemlock, Sphagnum mosses, and some Canadian fauna were also found in Tamarack Swamp in the early 1900s, with hemlocks being found as late as 1940. Tamarack Swamp is considered an Important Bird Area by Audubon Pennsylvania. Bird species in the wetland include Aegolius acadicus, Buteo platypterus, Coccyzus erythropthalmus, Empidonax alnorum, Melospiza georgiana, Myiarchus crinitus, Parkesia noveboracensis, Rallus limicola, and Vermivora chrysoptera. Five rare species of dragonfly are found in the area. Black bears live in Tamarack Swamp, as well as red-spotted newts and wood frogs. Meadows of sedge and the stumps of white pine trees occupy the southern part of Tamarack Swamp. There are also cattails and alders in the southern part of the wetland. The northern borders of the wetland are home to a population of red and white oaks. The carnivorous sundew plant is also found in the wetland. History In around 1827, Alexander Kelly, Montgomery Kelly, George Kelly, and Samuel Kelly settled on the western side of Tamarack Swamp. In approximately 1865, James Hennessy discovered several moose antlers buried in the wetland, indicating that moose once lived there. In a 1925 book by Francis R. Cope, Tamarack Swamp was mentioned. Cope referred to the wetland as \\"a little oasis in the desert...\\". In the 1990s, the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy added over 9400 acres to Sproul State Forest. This land includes Tamarack Swamp. In the early 1900s, parts of Tamarack Swamp, such as the southern part have been affected by logging and development. Logging was done as late as the 1940s, when Hicks Jennings cut down the only remaining virgin spruce in Tamarack Swamp. By 1947, the tamarack and black spruce trees in the wetland were significantly less healthy than they had been around 1900. The bird species olive-sided flycatcher, brown creeper, and winter wren have become extinct in the wetland since 1925. A report from the late 1940s mentioned that pitcher plants in the wetland. Uses There are plans to develop the Tamarack Swamp area. There are also plans to drill for oil and natural gas in the wetland. Natural gas pipelines have been laid in the swamp. The land that Tamarack Swamp is situated on has multiple owners. A total of 267 acres of the wetland forms the Tamarack Swamp Natural Area. A Natural Heritage Inventory in 2000 called Tamarack Swap \\"one of the most unique natural features in the county [Clinton County]\\". The United States Forest Service has designated one-third of the wetland as the Tamarack Swamp Natural Area DA.

The system was developed, from a concept drawn up by Danny Scroggins and Luke Cartey.  Founding and development  The HOPS Project began early in August 2009 in the rostering office of the signalling department at the Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway ‚Äì who embraced the use of the technology. Beta testing began in January 2010 with a small group of volunteers, the group being enlarged later that year. After this bedding-in period, the system was made more widely available to other UK heritage railways in January 2011. The purpose of the system is to provide administration tools associated with operating functions on heritage railways, such as staff rostering, timetabling and competence management, document control, etc. The system assists railways in meeting the requirements of government legislation such as the Railways and Other Guided Transport Systems (Safety) Regulations 2006 (ROGS) which were introduced in Great Britain to put the 2004 European Railway Safety Directive into practice. The system assists with competency management (as a requirement of the Safety Management System). The ethos of the development of the system has been that in the majority of cases, producing large-scale data-handling and storage facilities, with the appropriate level of security, access, backups, etc., would not be economical for an individual railway. A single program, in use by many railway companies, however, would make the investment economical. The system has grown significantly in the five years it has been in development, mainly in response to feedback from users and demands of the industry, and promises to continue to develop on the same lines in the future.

He is known for discovering a number of important lost artworks by Old Master artists, including Sir Peter Paul Rubens, Claude Lorrain and Peter Brueghel the Younger. As a dealer he specialised in Old Masters, with a particular interest in Anthony van Dyck. During 2011‚Äì2016, he carried out specialist research for, and appeared in, the BBC1 art programme, Fake or Fortune? He now presents the BBC4 series Britain's Lost Masterpieces, with Emma Dabiri (Jacky Klein in Series 1), which began in 2016, and is now filming its fifth series. Life and work Grosvenor was educated at Harrow School, Pembroke College, Cambridge and the University of East Anglia where he completed his PhD entitled \\"The Politics of Foreign Policy: Lord Derby and the Eastern Crisis, 1875-8\\". Before becoming an art historian he worked in politics, first as an adviser to the Labour MP Tony Banks, Lord Stratford, and then to the Conservative MP Hugo Swire. His first major art discovery was a mis-catalogued portrait by Sir Thomas Lawrence in 2003 that was being sold at a London auction as a work by Lawrence's pupil, George Henry Harlow. From 2005 until 2014, he worked for Philip Mould Ltd, where he made a number of significant art historical discoveries, including lost works by artists such as Sir Joshua Reynolds, Thomas Gainsborough, and Sir Anthony Van Dyck, on whom he is an acknowledged specialist. In 2016 he sold a newly identified portrait by Joan Carlile, the first professional British female artist, to the Tate gallery. In 2017, he discovered the \\"lost portrait\\" of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham at Pollok House, Glasgow, Scotland. The painting was thought to be a copy of a painting by Flemish artist Peter Paul Rubens that had been lost for nearly 400 years, but after restoration was found to be the original by Rubens. Grosvenor has been a member of the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Council on National Records and Archives, and the Lord Chancellor's Forum for Historical Manuscripts and Academic Research. He also works as a journalist and writer, and presents programmes for BBC2's The Culture Show. Jacobite portraiture Grosvenor has made a special study of Jacobite portraiture. In 2009 he proved that the Scottish National Portrait Gallery's iconic portrait of Charles Edward Stuart by Maurice Quentin de La Tour was in fact a portrait of Charles' brother, Henry Benedict Stuart, Cardinal Duke of York. In 2013 he discovered the lost portrait of Charles Edward Stuart by Scottish artist Allan Ramsay at Gosford House, the home of the Earl of Wemyss near Edinburgh. This portrait is now on display at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, and has taken the place of the La Tour pastel as the definitive portrait of Charles. Ancestry The name Bendor is derived from the Grosvenor family's medieval heraldic shield, a bend or, a golden bend (diagonal stripe), which they used until 1389 when it was claimed instead by the Scrope family, in the case Scrope v Grosvenor. The 2nd Duke of Westminster was nicknamed \\"Bendor\\". Grosvenor is the grandson of The 5th Baron Ebury, and a distant relative to The Duke of Westminster. He is also of Swiss heritage.

The archipelago was intensely Hellenized beginning in the 3rd century BC, a process which intertwined with the Christianization of Malta after the 1st century AD. The Byzantine presence was overturned by the Arab conquest of 870, and the surviving Greek community was Islamified. Maltese Christianity of the Byzantine Rite was only preserved in some parts of the country, being especially important in Gozo. These groups formed the basis for a local branch of the Orthodox Church, revived following Norman conquest in the 1120s. Although marginalized by Catholicism, which became the dominant faith, a Greek-speaking Orthodox community survived into the 15th century. Greek immigration was resumed in the 1520s, shortly before the establishment of Hospitaller Malta. It comprised mainly refugees from the Ottoman Empire, hundreds or thousands of whom escaped from Rhodes. They reestablished the Orthodox colony, presumed to have been placed under the Archbishopric of Ohrid, but also included in their ranks Greek-speaking Latin- and Byzantine- Rite Catholics. Within fifty years, with the onset of Counter-Reformation, the former community was pressured into merging with the latter two. By 1600, the Orthodox Greeks had formally abjured, but in various documented cases continued to practice their older rites. In tandem, the consolidated community of Catholic Greeks discarded its traditional center in Birgu and moved its base to Valletta, after which it became prone to assimilation into the ethnic mainstream. In the 17th century, the Orthodox presence was also reinforced by Ottoman Greeks taken as slaves by the Maltese privateers, some of whom were themselves ethnic Greeks; there were also new waves of Maniots and Aetolians. Though small in numbers, the resulting community participated in the propagation of Greek nationalism and of the \\"Greek Plan\\". Many local Greeks also supported the French occupation of Malta, which closely preceded a Franco‚ÄìOttoman war. During the period of British colonization, the Maltese Greek community leader Ioannis Papafis was a sponsor of the Greek War of Independence. Greeks affiliated with either Catholicism or Orthodoxy remained present over the following centuries, though the latter community continued to be informally marginalized throughout the 19th century, and are now a small minority. Early presence Various archeological finds may suggest some connections between the old Maltese civilization and the Minoan civilization, followed by Mycenaean Greece. In the 1920s, biological anthropologist L. H. Dudley Buxton proposed that the original inhabitants of Malta Island and Gozo were Cretan immigrants. However, the Ancient Greeks appear not to have included either island in their colonization of the Mediterranean, perhaps owing to their lack of natural resources. They used Malta for commerce, but the archipelago was taken over and colonized by Phoenicians, then by Carthage. Gozo is perhaps the mythical island of Ogygia, described in the Odyssey, which may attest that groups of Mycenians once settled there. The main island was known in Greece under the name Melite (); one theory is that the name \\"Malta\\" is a derivative of the Greek word for \\"honey\\" (). A Phoenician derivation has also been proposed. Despite being under Carthaginian rule, Malta was culturally integrated by the Hellenistic world in the 3rd century BC, when it built strong commercial links with Magna Graecia. Focusing on the finds at Tas-Silƒ°, scholar Antonio Tempio proposes that the archipelago was regularly visited by traders from Pitheko≈´sai, which had a mixed Carthaginian‚ÄìGreek populace. Greek influence was only reinforced after the First Punic War, when Malta was annexed to the Roman Republic, later becoming part of the Roman Empire alongside Roman Greece. This was especially the case in Gozo, where archeological finds document the extensive circulation of Ancient Greek coinage. While Punic was still spoken locally into the 1st century AD and perhaps even later, it faced competition from both Latin and Greek (see Cippi of Melqart). The Greek-speaking Byzantine Empire held Malta from the 6th century AD, and, beginning in the 8th century, Maltese Christianity was organized under the Byzantine Rite. Scant archeological evidence may suggest that local communities were under the command of tourmarchoi representing the Sicilian Theme, but this remains disputed. In circa 870, following the islands' capture and annexation by the Emirate of Sicily, some 3,000 men were reportedly killed, while 3,600 women and 5,000 children fell victim the Arab slave trade. The remaining Greek community was persecuted, its bishop enslaved, and its church destroyed. Local Greeks were largely converted to Islam, but continued to speak their original language. The period of Islamic conversion also witnessed the birth of Maltese, which developed largely from Maghrebi and Siculo-Arabic. Medieval Greek left \\"remarkably few\\" or \\"absolutely no traces\\" on this linguistic development. There is however evidence that a Christian church, probably Byzantine, still survived on Gozo, though it was cut off from contacts with other parts of Europe. An historical account originating with Zakariya al-Qazwini suggests that in the 11th century the Catepanate of Italy tried to restore Christian Byzantine rule over Malta. This attempt was thwarted when the Arabs agreed to emancipate their slaves, who joined the resistance. Nevertheless, the ethnic origin of these men remains unclear. Norman-Byzantine and Rhodian diasporas Attributed portrait of Iacob Heraclid (Basilicus Melitensis), displayed at Birgu Following the Norman conquest of the 1120s, Malta was integrated with the County, then the Kingdom of Sicily, and as such included within the Norman‚ÄìByzantine cultural sphere. The new rulers released and sent back to their homes those Christian slaves still present on the islands, but also brought with them a number of Greeks, who were disproportionately represented in the Norman‚ÄìSicilian navy. During the brief existence of a Norman kingdom in Africa, Greek administrators participated in repressing Arab piracy. A poem by a Greek exile to Malta, probably authored ca. 1150, laments that the population was still mostly Muslim, and commends the Normans for their efforts to convert them. Upon the end of that campaign, which can be reliably dated to the 13th century, Maltese Arabs and Greek Muslims were generally converted to Catholicism. There is however evidence that at least some Maltese Greeks opted for the Eastern Orthodox Church (see East‚ÄìWest Schism). Some clandestine sanctuaries might be indicators that Basilian monks, perhaps affiliated with Eastern Orthodoxy, were active in Malta. An obituary discovered in 2012 mentions a Nic√≥laos Protopap√†s M√°ltes (died 1230). His Greek surname, which can be read as \\"Protopope\\", could suggest that Orthodoxy had maintained an ecclesiastical structure. In the 1260s, Sicily and Malta became part of a personal empire built by Charles I of Anjou. According to anthropologist Stefan Goodwin, at his stage \\"faltering religious pluralism still existed in the sense that Orthodox Christians, Jews, and Muslims still constituted a substantial minority of the population.\\" Malta's native Greek Orthodoxy probably died out in the mid 15th century. Other groups of Greeks appeared in that context. In July 1401, the Crown of Aragon (which included Sicily and Malta from 1409) banned the release of Greek, Circassian, Albanian, Ruthenian, Bulgarian and Vlach slaves. From the 16th century on, most Greeks who arrived in Malta did so as a result of displacement by the Ottoman Empire (see Ottoman wars in Europe). Following a siege in 1522, the Knights Hospitaller were chased out Rhodes and granted possession of Malta. Rhodian Greeks followed them there, numbering in the hundreds or as many as 3,000 to 5,000 individuals (up to 20% of the total population). Overall, most migrants were initially Orthodox‚Äîhowever, Rhodians most likely included Latin- and Byzantine-Rite Catholics. Orthodox and Catholic Greeks from Hospitaller Malta and Maltese- occupied Tripoli were granted the privilege of trading with Muslim states, and integrated commercially with the larger Greek diaspora. In tandem, Greek seafarers contributed to the birth of Maltese privateering. Already in the 1530s, the archipelago was home to prosperous Greek Maltese merchants Sydero Metax√≠ and Stammato Galanti. Orthodox Rhodians settled in Malta-proper included priest Angelo Metax√≠ and the prosperous Fundomali family of Birgu. Among the Catholic descendants of this Rhodian diaspora was the adventurer Iacob Heraclid. Born at Birkirkara in 1527, he claimed the thrones of Samos and Chios, and would eventually serve as Prince of Moldavia in the 1560s. Propagated and partly distorted by the Hospitallers, accounts of Heraclid's career have left traces in Maltese literature and historiography. Damascena Church, originally a center of the Byzantine Rite community With four parish churches mentioned in early records, Birgu remained the center of Greek Rhodian immigration. In 1565, during the Great Siege of Malta, Greeks from that town joined a militia company mainly staffed by Maltese locals. Following the Hospitaller relocation from Birgu to Valletta, Greek converts were invited to the latter city, and were granted the Church of St Nicholas. Despite being a Catholic state, Hospitaller Malta remained somewhat tolerant of the Orthodox presence and, by 1621, the Greek Orthodox community in the archipelago had established direct contacts with the Patriarchate of Constantinople. It is likely that Malta and Gozo answered to the Archbishopric of Ohrid, through a suffragan located at Agrigento. Inquisition and assimilation During the Counter-Reformation era, efforts to absorb this congregation into Catholicism became more systematic. Greeks who were still Orthodox made repeated pledges of union with Catholicism, as a Byzantine-Rite community, but these remained formal. In the 1570s, Cardinal Giulio Antonio Santoro and the Roman Inquisition made a note that the Greek \\"heretics\\" were resisting such attempts, taking their chrism exclusively from their \\"Oriental prelate\\". In 1575 Birgu, there were 74 Greek Catholics. Their parish priest, Emmanuel Metax√≠, angered Catholic supervisors by omitting references to Filioque and ignoring the Gregorian calendar. Other Byzantine-Rite Greeks were prosecuted for similar offenses involving the calendar, prompting priest Constantin Sguro to ask advice from the Holy See. In one other case, the five daughters of a Greek priest were formally investigated by the Inquisition after accusations that they practiced witchcraft using his leftover chrism. In 1600, Metax√≠ bequeathed Damascena Church to monks from the Church of Sinai; unusually, this transfer was countersigned by the Catholic Archbishop, Tom√°s Gargallo. The monks, who also catered to the needs of Greeks in Cospicua, were presumed to be Catholic converts, but later found to be omitting the Filioque. The presence of Greeks was temporarily reinforced by other factors. By 1580, Hospitaller Malta was organizing privateer raids on Ottoman Tripolitania and the Levant, attracting some Catholic Greek volunteers‚Äîperhaps as many as 5% of the total privateers. This trend was still observable in the 1630s, when Greeks made up a sizable portion of the Maltese seafaring community, itself estimated at 20% of the active population. During the Golden Age of Piracy, Malta developed as a slave-trading hub, primarily supplied with Muslim captives. Between 1550 and 1600, some 20% of the captives were Christians, many of them Greeks; the policy was to release most non-Muslims, but in practice some Greeks were still kept as slaves, in perpetuity. In the 17th and 18th centuries, sailors under the Maltese cross were regularly attacking ships manned by sailors from Ottoman Greece, since these were generally Orthodox (and therefore \\"schismatic\\"). In various cases, Greek captives began declaring themselves Catholic to obtain release. In 1674, the Holy See gave its permission for the sale of Orthodox slaves, provided they were Ottoman subjects. Also in the 1670s, some hundreds of Maniots are believed to have settled in the Maltese archipelago. According to Buxton, Maniot \\"racial\\" influence was especially striking in and around ≈ªurrieq. Meanwhile, Birgu's Catholic Greek community declined even more, and became small enough to be served by the priests of Borgo. The Catholic Greek parishioners of Valletta are not mentioned in the 1680s census (or Status Animarum) for unclear reasons, but probably had a more thriving community. However, this group became especially prone to assimilation, by adopting the Latin Rite and, with time, Maltese identity. Already before 1670, Maltese graduates of the Pontifical Greek College frequently opted for priesthood into the Latin Rite. By 1708, there were only nine Byzantine-Rite Catholics of young age registered in Valletta; Latinized Greeks of that age included Gioacchino Loretta, a noted Baroque painter. According to historian Katerina Papakonstantinou, before 1723 \\"captains from Messolonghi formed the only Greek presence on the island [of Malta]\\", by which time \\"the flag of Malta was often flown by Greek ships, especially those from Messolonghi, in order to provide them easy access to Western European ports.\\" Later in the 18th century, Malta became the destination of sailors from throughout the Aegean Islands. The temporary presence of a Greek colony in southwest Mdina during that age has given its name to the neighboring \\"Greeks Gate\\". The lush area outside Rabat is traditionally known as Wied ir-Rum, translated by Giovanni Francesco Abela as Valle de' Christiani Greci (\\"Valley of the Greek Christians\\"; see R√ªm). Napoleonic era Portrait of Ioannis Papafis Beginning in the 1760s, Hospitaller Malta became interesting to the Russian Empire, which increased its presence in the Mediterranean and even attempted to impose its rule. A Greek-Russian envoy, Antonio Psaro, negotiated an understanding between the Order and the Russians, integrating Malta with the \\"Greek Plan\\" before 1789. Such maneuvers enhanced the rift between the Hospitallers and the French Republic. In June 1798, a French occupation of Malta ended Hospitaller rule. Maltese Greeks were reportedly enthusiastic about this development, believing it a prelude to the liberation of Greece. On Napoleon's orders, the 2,000 slaves still present in Malta were all manumitted. In his proclamations, he thanked the Greeks for their loyalty, and banned Latin-Rite priests from ever officiating in \\"Greek Churches\\". However, an explicit order was given to execute Greeks who maintained relations with the Russian Empire. While the French engaged the Ottomans in battle, an attempt to revive the Hospitallers as an Orthodox-and-Catholic order was made by Paul I of Russia (see Russian tradition of the Knights Hospitaller). Participating in this reconciliation, Jean-Baptiste Antoine de Flachslanden proposed to create a Hospitallers' Langue for Greek expatriates. However, his project also called for moving the Order's headquarters to Austrian Dalmatia. 500 Greeks and some \\"disloyal Maltese\\" still assisted the beleaguered French Revolutionary Army during the uprising of September 1798. There followed an occupation by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, which imposed a Malta Protectorate (nominally under the Kingdom of Naples). During this time, Ottoman Greeks were among the soldiers of fortune taken to serve at Fort Ricasoli; they were then participants in the Froberg mutiny of April 1807. The revolt was violently suppressed, but not before attempts at mediation involving local Greek priests. With the establishment of the Crown Colony of Malta within the British Empire, Orthodox Greeks again had a noted presence in the islands. In 1816, they founded Saint George Church of Valletta, re-purposing a regular 17th-century building. The Church Mission Society noted that, between 1810 and 1819, the number of Greek Orthodox \\"foreigners\\" in Malta had declined from 12,000 (the largest minority, ahead of 7,000 Jews), to a \\"very small number\\". The Catholic parishioners who identified as Greeks were a similarly minor presence. In 1806, only 76 individuals registered with Byzantine Catholic churches anywhere in the archipelago. With the end of the Napoleonic Wars came a regeneration of the Black Sea wheat trade, and Greek-run enterprises became its major players, setting up representations in Maltese ports. Greek community life experienced a small revival during the Greek War of Independence, when events such as the Chios massacre pushed some, including the shipowner and political conspirator Alexandros Kontostavlos, to seek refuge on the Maltese islands. The newly proclaimed Hellenic Republic managed to set up a consulate in Malta, but it remained largely inactive. In that context, one particularly important Greek migrant was the broker Ioannis Papafis, originally from Thessaloniki, who had moved to Malta in 1818. Until his death in 1886, Papafis contributed significantly to the local society; he also provided financial aid for the Hellenic Republic, and later for the Kingdom of Greece. Modern communities Greeks in Malta in 1846; calotype by Calvert Jones British rule introduced toleration for Greek Orthodox customs, but Catholicism was preserved as the privileged religion. A controversy erupted in the 1840s, when Greek Orthodox priests began wearing their vestments outside church, testing an older customary prohibition. Greece intervened to protect that right, but the First Russell ministry sided with Maltese Catholics. The Catholic Greeks, meanwhile, no longer ordained local priests, relying on envoys from the Italo-Albanian Catholic Church. Their two churches in Valletta, St Nicholas and the new Damascene Church, had by then been reassigned to Latin confraternities. Some Greeks joined other spiritual communities: in 1831, American Congregationalist records noted the existence in Malta of at least one family of Greek affiliates, one of whom helped direct the effort to establish missions in Greece. By the 1880s, Greeks from the islands had joined in the Maltese migration to the Khedivate of Egypt. British reports of the period claim that Greek Maltese settlers in Alexandria were often engaged in criminal activities. When the ‚ÄòUrabi revolt reached the city in June 1882, Maltese Greeks were among its earliest victims (see Bombardment of Alexandria). There were various instances of Greek migration to Malta, including, in the 1880s, the Orthodox Giovanni Dacoutros of Santorini. He founded a successful business which relied on imported Greek wine, while other families of immigrants (Colombos, Grech, Marich, Sorottos, etc.) dealt mainly in tobacco. The British census of 1911 recorded 36 males and 39 female Greek nationals among the recent immigrants to the Colony. In 1915, scholar Raymond Janin still noted the existence of \\"small colony\\" of Byzantine-Rite Catholic Greeks in Malta. He counted this group alongside similar communities of Grikos and Arb√´resh√´ in the Italian Peninsula, Carg√®se, and French North Africa, estimating the total number at 25,000. The Damascene church was returned to them in 1934, but was then heavily damaged during the bombing raids on Malta. Orthodox Greeks still maintained a chapel in the 1950s, but it reportedly had no attending priest. According to the Catholic cleric Giorgio Schir√≤, this issue prompted many more Orthodox to join his Byzantine-Rite community. The present-day non-assimilated Greek presence in Malta remains small. An informal estimate for 2012 placed the total number of Greeks in Malta at 20 families or less. The Orthodox community, comprising some 50 people in 2010, was allocated to the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Italy and Malta. Catholic Byzantine-Rite Greeks are mainly parishioners of the Damascene Church. In 2012, this was served by a non-Greek priest, George Mifsud Montanaro, and affiliated with the Melkite Greek Catholic Church (Diocese of Galilee). In July 2015, members of the communities and temporary migrants from Greece protested alongside Moviment Graffitti in Valletta, showing support for the anti-austerity movement in Greece.

She was a member of the National Association for Women's Suffrage in 1902‚Äì1921, and a speaker of the left wing within the movement.  Life and career  Ruth Gustafson was born to care taker Fredrik Teodor Pettersson and Anna Lovisa Johansson in Stockholm. She married editor and parliamentarian Hjalmar Albin Gustafson (1883‚Äì1961) in 1912 and divorced him in 1934. She was a board member of the Women's Union in 1903‚Äì1906, Working Comity of the Social Democratic Women in 1907‚Äì1910 and 1917‚Äì1920, Chairperson of the Working Comity of the Social Democratic Women in 1908‚Äì1910, board member of the Social Democratic Women in 1920‚Äì1932 and 1936‚Äì1948. Gustafson was raised in an intellectual working-class home with parents interested in socialism and worker's rights and a father engaged in union work, and she became active in the social democratic movement through its youth clubs in Stockholm in the 1890s. She became a formal member of the Social Democratic party in 1902, and was thereafter active as a speaker for the party, citing Kata Dalstr√∂m and Anna Sterky as her role models. She was known for her radical views in favor to abolish the church, in favor of civil marriage, to give legal rights to couple living together without being married (as she herself did with her spouse for six years before she married him), and to protect children from being used as work force. Ruth Gustafson was a leading figure of the women's rights movement within the social democratic party and the Swedish working class movement, were the women normally did not wish to become a part of the women's rights organisations as they were considered to consist mainly of upper class ladies. Working-class women at this point spoke for their rights through the trade unions for women, and Gustafsson was an important speaker for them within the social democratic party, were the rights of workers were given priority over women's rights and women's participation in politics, though frequent, was not yet uncontroversial.
