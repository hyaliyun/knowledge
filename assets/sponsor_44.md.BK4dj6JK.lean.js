It is unusual being a complex with five nitrate groups, and being a nitrate complex of a light element with nitrate. Such a complex with five nitrate groups is called a pentanitratometallate. Related complexes There is a pentanitrato complex with cerium (PPh3Et)2[Ce(NO3)5]. Tetranitratoaluminate and hexanitratoaluminate are related anions with aluminium at their core. Properties There are two different arrangements for the coordination of nitrate with aluminium in the complex. One nitrate is bonded with two oxygens to the aluminium (bidentate), and the other five oxygen atoms only link via one oxygen (monodentate). The bidentate nitrate has an O‚ÄìAl length of 1.98 √Ö. Another two Al‚ÄìO bonds roughly in the same plane have a length of 1.89 √Ö. The other two Al‚ÄìO bonds complete a distorted octahedral arrangement and pop out the top and bottom of the aluminium with a length of 1.93 √Ö. The bidentate connected nitrate group is distorted so that the uncoordinated terminal oxygen bond is shorter than the coordinated oxygen‚Äìnitrogen distance (1.22 versus 1.31 √Ö). The angles are also warped, with coordinated oxygen angle subtended on the nitrogen of 109¬∞, and angle of these oxygen atoms with the terminal atom of 126¬∞. The whole nitrate is still planar along with the aluminium. Examples An example salt is caesium pentanitratoaluminate Cs2[Al(NO3)5]. caesium pentanitratoaluminate crystallises in the trigonal form with Œ± = 11.16 √Ö, c = 10.02 √Ö, formula mass 602.85, with three molecules per unit cell. The unit cell volume is 1080 √Ö3, measured density 2.69 g/cm3. The space group is P3121. It is a crystalline substance. Caesium pentanitratoaluminate has been formed by treating a mixture of caesium chloride and caesium tetracloroaluminate with dinitrogen tetroxide and methyl nitrate, and pumping off the NOCl gas produced. If only caesium tetracloroaluminate is used, omitting the CsCl, then the result contains solid Al(NO3)3¬∑CH3CN as well. Tetramethylammonium pentanitratoaluminate has been made by recrystallising tetramethyl ammonium tetranitratoaluminate in acetonitrile over several weeks. It forms a waxy substance.

He was the president of the Ghana Football Association (GFA) from 30 December 2005 until 7 June 2018. Nyantakyi officially resigned a day later. However, four hours to the release of his resignation letter FIFA had issued a statement announcing his ban from all football related activities for a period of 90 days pending investigations. Circumstances surrounding his resignation include a video released by investigative journalist Anas Aremeyaw Anas in which Nyantakyi was found taking a bribe and purporting to have the ability to \\"take over the whole country\\". In an interview with Super Sports South Africa a few days after the video of the investigation was slated to go public, Nyantakyi denied any wrongdoing regarding match fixing. On 30 October 2018 FIFA officially issued a statement that officially bans Kwesi Nantakyi from football related activities for life. In October 2020, the ban was reduced to 15 years after a reconsideration by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Early life Born to a Waala mother, and an Akan father from Kwaso in the Ashanti Region, Nyantakyi grew up in Wa where he had his early education. A practicing Muslim, Nyantakyi was born Christian but reverted to Islam from the age of 47, after his mother remarried a Muslim man years back in the seventies. Nyantakyi has a wife, Christine-Marie Nyantakyi . He has two children with his wife Christine. President of GFA Nyantakyi became the president of the Ghana Football Association (GFA) on 30 December 2005. Nyantakyi defeated two other candidates, Ade Coker and Kojo Bonsu. Under his presidency, Ghana qualified for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the first for the country. Ghana again qualified for the subsequent 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa and the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. The Ghana U-20 football team also won Africa's first and only U-20 World Cup also during his stewardship in 2009. He has currently resigned from this position. President of WAFU In 2011, when West African Football Union (WAFU) president, Amos Adamu, was suspended by FIFA, Kwesi Nyantakyi was given the nod to be the interim president of WAFU until elections were conducted. When the union conducted its elections on 31 May 2011, Mr. Nyantakyi was elected president for a two-year term. He stood unopposed in the November 2013 elections and was re-appointed for another two-year term as president. Nyantakyi resigned as WAFU president on the 11th of June 2018. International Football Appointments Nyantakyi has held several international positions in football. His appointments cut across sub regional, regional and international levels including: *President of West African Football Union Zone B. *Football organizer at the 2012 London Olympics *Member of FIFA Associations Committee * Member of the FIFA Council * Vice President of the Confederation of African Football Awards Nyantakyi has endeared himself very much to most Ghanaians due to several achievements as a football administrator. In 2012, he was named the thirty-second most influential Ghanaian.  Controversies  An undercover investigation led by The Telegraph and Channel 4 accused Nyantakyi and other officials of the Ghana Football Association of match-fixing. According to this investigation, the accusations 'involved just international friendlies; World Cup matches would not be affected by the suspicions' Nyantakyi denied the match fixing allegations by saying that \\"the report of the newspaper or the media house is entirely not accurate\\" because \\"there is really no cause for alarm as far as I am concerned because nothing untoward has happened involving me or the Federation.\\" In May 2018, the President of Ghana, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo ordered the arrest of Nyantakyi following an expos√© by Ghanaian investigative journalist Anas Aremeyaw Anas in which Nyantakyi was apparently engaged in some fraudulent activity using the name of the President. Deputy Chief of Staff, Samuel Abu Jinapor in an interview with Dan Kweku Yeboah on Peace FM confirmed the president's order for Nyantakyi's arrest, indicating that the GFA President engaged in influence peddling using the name of the president. \\"The footage indicated that Kwesi Nyantakyi used the name of the President to defraud some people; constituting defrauding by false pretenses...\\" Jinapor indicated. According to Jinapor, after the President finished watching the video he could not help but direct the Criminal Investigative Department (CID) of the Ghana Police Service to issue an arrest warrant for Kwesi Nyantakyi.\\" He ordered the CID to arrest him to assist in investigations and then the next step will be taken. The president is the custodian of the law and he‚Äôs not biased. No matter who you are, once you are wrong, he will hand you over to the law. He has demonstrated that his determination to fight corruption and crime is unquestionable\\" Jinapor noted. He was asked if the President was on the right course since the GFA is deemed autonomous. In response he said: \\"GFA is not an island when it comes to the criminal laws of Ghana and so an action can be taken and that is what has been done. Nobody will be allowed to go scot free if found guilty.\\" The allegations and controversies also led to Nyantakyi's resignation on June 8, 2018 as the president of the Ghana Football Association. The unfortunate incident was reported after an Executive Committee meeting of the Ghana Football Association. The resignation is believed to have resulted from a provisional ban placed on Nyantakyi for a period of 90 days by the chairperson of the adjudicatory chamber of the Ethics Committee of FIFA. The ban is expected to restrict Nyantakyi's involvement in any football activities at both national and international levels.  Top 5 scandals of Kwesi Nyantakyi as GFA president  Allegations of match-fixing In 2014, British newspaper, The Telegraph and Channel 4 did an investigation where the Telegraph‚Äôs reporters posed as match fixers and engaged Nyantakyi about the possibility of organising friendlies and influencing referees to determine the outcome of those games.The case ended up at FIFA, Nyantakyi was later cleared of any wrong doing by the Ethics Committee. Co-efficient payments The ‚Äúco-efficient theory‚Äù became popular among Ghanaians following Nyantakyi's appearance before the 2014 Commission of Inquiry. The GFA boss alluded to the fact that he shared an amount of $557,000 among seven management committee members of the GFA which included his former vice, Jordan Anagblah, who was deceased even before the World Cup in Brazil started. Nyantakyi later said he calculated the shared amount using the co-efficient of seven. Double friendly payments scandal The Dzamefe Commission also uncovered that the GFA, led by Nyantakyi, took double payments in organizing preparation matches ahead of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The association took money from government to organize friendlies for the Black Stars, before again turning back to take another money from sponsors GNPC for the same purpose. The Commission, therefore, ordered him to refund a sum of $1 million to the state following the revelations. Mid Sea brouhaha Another big controversy of Kwesi Nyantakyi's tenure as GFA boss was his handling of the Glo sponsorship deal which signed a $15million deal with the GFA to sponsor that Ghana Premier League, but not without a third party payment. Mid sea, the brokers of the deal, stood to gain 15% of the total amount, however, it was later found that the agency could not be traced, leaving many to wonder who the 15% payment had been made to. The Economic and Organised Crime Office (EOCO) took up the matter, but could not prosecute anyone despite storming the offices of the GFA. Inconsistencies in GNPC deal Again, following the signing of a sponsorship between the Black Stars and state-owned GNPC, the GFA listed West Head as the company that brokered the deal. However, it was later revealed that then GNPC boss Ato Ahwoi that no third party was involved in the deal, exposing the FA in the process.

After merging with the Carnegie College of Physical Education in 1968 it was renamed the City of Leeds and Carnegie College. History The Grange at Beckett Park The City of Leeds Training College grew out of the Leeds Pupil Teacher College founded in 1901 to train teachers centrally in the city rather than in individual schools. The college in the city centre was founded in 1907 and moved to Beckett Park in 1912. The site selected was a 35 acre site around Kirkstall Grange. The mansion house was already rented by Leeds Council to house teacher training students. After some opposition, the property was bought for ¬£48,000 from Lord Grimthorpe. A competition for Leeds architects to design a main building and seven halls of residence or hostels, two for men and five for women, resulted in 27 submissions. Building started in 1911 and the college was ready for occupation by September 1912. The mansion was used as a men's hostel named Grange. The other hostels were named after prominent Yorkshire people, Cavendish, Fairfax, Bront√´, Caedmon, Macaulay, Leighton and Priestley. The college had accommodation for 300 women students and 180 men in eight hostels each housing 60 students. By September 1913 the college was filled to capacity with students from all over England. At the outbreak of First World War the college was about to admit 421 students when the building was requisitioned by the War Office to create the 2nd Northern General Hospital, a facility for the Royal Army Medical Corps to treat military casualties. Local schools were used for teaching and several large houses in Headingley were used to house students. In 1916 the War Office took over the whole college for the hospital which remained open until 1924. The college trained men and women but was not co- educational as men and women were taught separately. Out of 170 teacher training colleges it was one of only five that was mixed. From 1918 to 1933, the principal of the college was the mathematician John Robinson Airey. The Carnegie College of Physical Education was formed in 1933 as the result of an initiative between the government and the Carnegie Trust to provide training for male physical education teachers. The Director of Education for Leeds, James Graham, was instrumental in attracting the college to Leeds and building its premises on the Beckett Park campus. The Carnegie Trust provided ¬£30,000 to provide a gymnasium and a hostel for 60 male students. The college premises were again used as a military hospital in the Second World War and the students were moved out of the city to Scarborough, returning to Beckett Park at the end of 1945. Name changes The City of Leeds College changed its name to the City of Leeds College of Education in 1964. It merged with the physical education college in 1968 to form the City of Leeds and Carnegie College and in 1976 merged into Leeds Polytechnic which in 1992 became Leeds Metropolitan University. Leeds Metropolitan University was renamed Leeds Beckett University in September 2014. Its chancellor, Sir Bob Murray, said \\"We will be very proud to adopt a new name for our University which is so closely linked to the location and birthplace of two of our major founding colleges.\\" Architecture Cavendish Hall at Beckett Park The college's original three- storey halls of residence and teaching and administration building built around a green lawn known as the Acre were designed by G. W. Atkinson and completed in 1912 in a Wrenaissance style in red brick with ashlar gritstone dressings. All are now Grade II listed buildings.

Bird's doctoral work on non-proportional hazards in breast cancer found application in organ transplantation where beneficial matching was the basis for UK's allocation of cadaveric kidneys for a decade. Bird led the Medical Research Council (MRC) Biostatistical Initiative in support of AIDS/HIV studies in Scotland, as part of which Dr A. Graham Bird and she pioneered Willing Anonymous HIV Surveillance (WASH) studies in prisons. Her work with Cooper on UK dietary bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) exposure revealed that the 1940‚Äì69 birth cohort was the most exposed and implied age-dependency in susceptibility to clinical vCJD progression from dietary BSE exposure since most vCJD cases were younger, born in 1970‚Äì89. Bird also designed the European Union's robust surveillance for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in sheep which revolutionised the understanding of scrapie. Record linkage studies in Scotland were central to Bird's work (with others) on the late sequelae of Hepatitis C virus infection and on the morbidity and mortality of opioid addiction. Her team first quantified the very high risk of drugs-related death in the fortnight after prison-release, in response to which Bird and Hutchinson proposed a prison-based randomized controlled trial of naloxone, the opioid antagonist, for prisoners-on-release who had a history of heroin injection. Bird introduced the Royal Statistical Society‚Äôs statistical seminars for journalists and awards for statistical excellence in journalism. She is the first female statistician to have been awarded four medals by the Royal Statistical Society (Guy bronze, 1989; Austin Bradford Hill, 2000; Chambers, 2010, Howard, 2015).  Early life and education  Bird was born in Inverness, Scotland on 18 May 1952 to Isabella Agnes Gordon (n√©e Macdonald) and Herbert Gore. She was educated at Elgin Academy in Scotland, where the mathematics master, Lewis Grant, introduced her to statistics. She graduated with a joint-honours in mathematics and statistics from the University of Aberdeen. From 1974-1976 she was a research assistant in medical statistics at the University of Edinburgh where she, Jones and Rytter quantified the misuse of statistics in the BMJ. In his editorial, Stephen Lock \\"took on the chin\\" their 1977 paper and championed statistical guidelines for contributors to medical journals. Doctoral work followed, begun at the University of Edinburgh and supervised by Stuart Pocock, on the analysis of survival in breast cancer which Bird undertook part-time during a lectureship in statistics at the University of Aberdeen (1976‚Äì80) before joining the Medical Research Council's Biostatistics Unit in Cambridge in 1980.  Career  Bird works for the Medical Research Council (MRC), as Programme Leader at their Biostatistics Unit in Cambridge. Publication of Bird's 23 articles on ‚ÄòStatistics in Question‚Äô in the BMJ led to her running World Health Organization (WHO) workshops on research methods in diarrhoeal diseases for Third World paediatricians, through which she and Dilip Mahalanabis designed and piloted a clinical record-form which was subsequently adopted for all WHO-funded randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of oral rehydration solutions (ORS). The common record facilitated a subsequent exploratory analysis of individual patient data by Bird and Fontaine. This suggested benefit from lower osmolarity solutions, which was then formally tested in a series of RCTs with global change to low osmolarity ORS adopted in 2001. Back in Cambridge, Bird worked with paediatrician Dr Colin Morley on the British Randomised Evaluation of ALEC Therapy (BREATHE), the first RCT to demonstrate a one-third reduced mortality in premature babies by administration at birth of artificial surfactant. ALEC (artificial lung expanding compound) was named for Alec Bangham FRS, who developed it. Non-Cambridge neonatologists‚Äô prior belief was elicited by ‚Äòtrial roulette‚Äô and had centred on a one quarter-reduction, the effect-size that BREATHE was powered to detect. Work on transplantation statistics in the 1980s with Gilks and Bradley led to beneficial matching being adopted as the basis of UK's exchange of cadaveric donor kidneys. To estimate the potential for cadaveric solid organ donation from brainstem-dead donors, Bird designed UK's first confidential audit of all deaths in intensive care units which revealed that relatives‚Äô refusal ‚Äìrate (then 30%, since risen to 40%), not doctors‚Äô failure to ask, was the fundamental problem. Bird led the MRC Biostatistical Initiative in support of AIDS/HIV studies in Scotland (1990‚Äì1995), which included projection of Scotland's cases of severe immunodeficiency (so-called CD200 cases) and HIV epidemiological studies in prisons, both with co-investigator, clinical immunologist Dr A. Graham Bird. Bird's work at the interface of public health and other jurisdictions continued. A series of record-linkage studies in Scotland on the late sequelae of Hepatitis C virus infection (with Hutchinson and Goldberg) and on the high risk of drugs-related death soon after prison-release (or after hospital- discharge for drug-treatment clients) followed. With Cooper, she estimated UK's dietary exposure to BSE by birth-cohort and they deduced lower susceptibility to vCJD-progression from dietary BSE exposure at older ages. Bird also designed the European Union's robust surveillance at abattoirs for late-stage transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in sheep. Bird served on four working parties of the Royal Statistical Society (RSS): Counting with Confidence, Statistics and Statisticians in Drug Regulation, Performance Monitoring in the Public Services (as chair) and Statistical Issues in First- in-Man Studies. As RSS's vice-president for external affairs (2005‚Äì09), Bird introduced statistical seminars for journalists and the RSS's awards for statistical excellence in journalism; and supported Straight Statistics by contributing over 100 articles, many on H1N1 pandemic influenza, others based on her 20-weekly reporting with Colonel Clive Fairweather on military fatality-rates in Afghanistan by nationality and cause. Bird led the RSS's campaign for legislation to end the late registration of inquest deaths in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Honours and awards  As Sheila M. Gore, she won the Guy Medal in Bronze in 1989.Royal Statistical Society Guy Medal in Bronze, MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive Bird was appointed OBE in 2011 for services to social statistics. She was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 2012. In 2018, she received an honorary doctorate from the University of Edinburgh.  Personal life  In September 1999 she and Bird married. Six weeks after their marriage he was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme and died in January 2000. Up until his death she published under her maiden name, Gore, however since she has published under her married name of Bird, in her husband's honour.

It was built and used worldwide. Design and development The first glider to be named the Hols der Teufel was the influential Dj√§valer Anamma, designed by Alexander Lippisch in 1923. The name was associated with the cursing of two Swedish students in the Wasserkuppe workshops whose favourite phrase it was. It translates into German as Hols der Teufel. Its key structural feature was an A-frame which carried wire braced wings and linked to a flat girder rear fuselage. It later evolved through the Schneider Grunau 9 into the very popular Z√∂gling, which avoided the controversial \\"skullsplitter\\" forward member of the A-frame with a vertical strut behind the pilot, and was related to the secondary RRG Pr√ºfling glider that replaced wire bracing with rigid lift struts. The next machine to be named Hols der Teufel was designed by Lippisch and Hans Jacobs in 1928, possibly with the assistance of Alexander Schleicher. It had the Z√∂gling girder frame and the strut braced wings, making it very different from its previous namesake. It was built (and named) by Alexander Schleicher in his factory in the valley below the Wasserkuppe. Detailed plans of it for amateur use were included in a book on glider building published by Jacobs in 1932 and led to its widespread construction. The complete Schleicher version differed somewhat from the plans in several details, for example more rounded wing tips and span, different girder frame cross bracing and a wire, rather than strut braced tailplane. The Jacobs plans show the Hols der Teufel had a simple, constant chord wing much like that of the Z√∂gling though of greater span, built around two spars and fabric covered except at the leading edge which was plywood skinned. Its broad, constant chord ailerons were longer than those of the Z√∂gling and its round cornered, tapered tips were less angular. As before, the wing was supported by the forward members of its girder fuselage; a vertical strut near the leading edge and an inverted V-strut behind. As the wing was strut rather than wire braced there was no longer a need to extend these struts above the wing into a pylon. The two faired, parallel lift struts on each side ran from the lower forward fuselage to the wing at about mid- span. Like some Z√∂glings, the Hols der Teufel had a light nacelle, ending under the wing at a forward leaning vertical knife edge around the aft central wing strut, enclosing both the pilot's seat and the other supporting struts. Aft, the cross braced girder had a horizontal upper beam onto which the tailplane was mounted, strut braced from below. Its leading edge was straight and strongly swept; the cropped, parallel chord elevators had a central cut out for rudder movement. The fin was under the tailplane, formed by fabric covering between the last two vertical fuselage fames. Its upright, near rectangular rudder was hinged on the extended, final vertical frame member. The Hols der Teufel landed on a rubber sprung skid which ran from the nose to a little beyond the aft lift struts. Operational history The ready availability of detailed plans and the fact that with its low wing loading the Hols der Teufel was one of only a few training gliders with the soaring capability to take a pilot to a C-badge resulted in widespread amateur construction worldwide, though overall numbers are hard to establish, not least in Germany. Twelve were registered in Hungary, one imported in 1929 and the rest locally built between 1931 and 1938. Seven appear in the UK on the BGA register, including one at least that flew with the London Gliding Club for several years. During World War II some served with the ATC. Two were built by a Swiss immigrant in Brazil, one of which is on display in the Museu Aeroespacial in Rio de Janeiro, the only recorded surviving original example One was built in the 1950s in Australia. In 1990 a reproduction Hols der Teufel, built from Jacobs' plans was flown from Dunstable; it is now in the Gliding Museum on the Wasserkuppe. The Slingsby Kadet was the result of a conscious \\"crossing\\" of the low wing loading soaring performance of the Hols der Teufel with the better handling of the Pr√ºfling, particularly by improving the former's poor lateral control with better ailerons.

The term is an amalgamation of the words 'advertising' and 'concept', indicating its role as a halfway stage between a concept idea and an advertising execution. Traditionally, adcepts have been used to check early creative work, typically with advertising agency clients or in market research focus groups. An alternative to concept statements Traditionally, qualitative market research has used concept statements and mood boards to test ideas with target consumers. However, Richard Woods (Journal of Consumer Behaviour, Vol.3, 4 388-403) argues that concept boards are unfamiliar and lack emotional appeal. They also attempt to pull apart the rational and the emotional, which goes against how the human mind evaluates ideas. Because advertising is the popular language of brands, he claims, adcepts are easier for consumers to relate to, and to evaluate. Formats Adcepts can be highly finished and closely resemble final advertising or they can be made to be deliberately conceptual. When used as research stimulus, Richard Woods argues that this rougher, conceptual format is needed. Showing very polished adcepts to focus group participants leads them to pass judgment on the specific execution rather than examining the core idea being explored. Applications At their most basic level, adcepts are useful for testing advertising ideas that are works in progress. However, when used in place of concept boards, they are ideally suited to isolating what a brand could stand for, and exploring the areas it could expand into in the future.

Fighting for Freedom portrays the complex illegal immigration crisis to meet the Salazar family and the Dobbe family that employs them. Plot Oscar and Maria Salazar, trapped in Mexico, are denied work visas to return to the U.S. Their plight is further complicated by the birth of a child, Angelina; their other two children, born at Love Orchard, are U.S. citizens. Oscar decides to enter the U.S. illegally. He and Maria, carrying Angelina, skirt death crossing the Arizona desert. Their journey is juxtaposed alongside that of Dobbe daughter Karen, a rising star in an arch-conservative law firm. The Salazar family arrives safely, until the authorities raid Love Orchard and order a deportation hearing for the now three-year-old Angelina. The case is taken to Washington by Karen, who, by opting to defend Angelina, befuddles her boss, makes up with her estranged father, and converts her conservative counterpart into her relatively liberal lover.

But they are soon discovered by their enemies, and a frantic chase sends Kate a hundred years into the past, where the various non-human sapients (Dwarves, Elves, Giants, Dragons, Trolls, etc.) are in preparation to create a parallel reality in which to hide from the Industrial Revolution. While searching for a way back to her brother and sister, she befriends 'Rafe', the innocent younger edition of the supreme antagonist 'Dire Magnus. Meanwhile, Michael and Emma set off to find the second of the Books of Beginning (the eponymous 'Fire Chronicle', which enables its user either to revive the dead, or to restore an individual's sense of purpose) which they ultimately win from the Dire Magnus' subordinates with the help of an Elvish colony. Meanwhile, as Kate spends time with Rafe, she gradually falls in love with him, and ultimately dies to save him despite knowing that he is going to be the next version of the Dire Magnus. The Dire Magnus then offers Rafe the chance to save Kate's life in return that he take his place as the new Dire Magnus, which Rafe accepts. He gives himself to the Dire Magnus in order for her to be saved and in doing so helped by sending her to the future (or the present) for her to be saved by her brother.

He was arrested by the police, brought to the tsar, and forced to recite the poem out loud in the presence of the emperor, after which the emperor said, \\"I give you the means of rehabilitating yourself by military service.

Polezhayev continued to write satires (describing the Russian Tsar as 'a hangman' and 'an Emperor corporal') and in the early 1830s became close to the radicals, one of whom, Alexander Hertzen, later remembered him with great warmth in his book of memoirs My Past and Thoughts. A volatile and rebellious character prone to heavy drinking, Polezhayev got involved in a series of incidents, the last of which resulted in his being punished by flogging so severe, fragments of twigs had to be extracted surgically form his back.

These forks are a common feature of tree crowns. The wood grain orientation at the top of a tree fork is such that the wood's grain pattern most often interlocks to provide sufficient mechanical support. A common \\"malformation\\" of a tree fork is where bark has formed within the join, often caused by natural bracing occurring higher up in the crown of the tree, and these bark-included junctions often have a heightened risk of failure, especially when bracing branches are pruned out or are shaded out from the tree's crown. Typical wood grain pattern at a mature tree fork, Slater et al.2014Slater, D. Bradley, R, Withers, P. and Ennos, A. R.

T. (2003) Does included bark reduce the strength of co-dominant stems?; Journal of Arboriculture 29(2) pp. 104-106 Co-dominant stems are where the two or more arising branches emerging from the junction are of near equal diameter and this type of junction in a tree is often referred to in layman's terms as 'a tree fork'.Harris, R.W. Clark, J. R. and Matheny, N. P. (1999) Arboriculture: Integrated Management of Landscape Trees, Shrubs and Vines; 3rd Ed.; Prentice HallLonsdale, D.(2000) Hazards from Trees: A general guide; Forestry Commission Practice Guide; TSO There is actually no hard botanical division between these two forms of tree junction: they are topologically equivalent, and from their external appearance it is only a matter of the diameter ratio between the branches that are conjoined that separates a tree fork from being a branch-to-stem junction.Slater, D. and Harbinson, C. J. (2010) Towards a new model for branch attachment; Arboricultural Journal 33 (2) 95-105 However, when a small branch joins to a tree trunk there is a knot that can be found to be embedded into the trunk of the tree, which was the initial base of the smaller branch. This is not the case in tree forks, as each branch is roughly equal in size and no substantial tissues from either branch is embedded into the other, so there is no reinforcing knot to supply the mechanical strength to the junction that will be needed to hold the branches aloft.Slater, D. and Harbinson, C. J. (2010) Towards a new model for branch attachment; Arboricultural Journal 33 (2) 95-105 Wood grain pattern of a fork of Fraxinus excelsior (Common ash), as found by stripping off the outer and inner bark layers Anatomy and morphology Research has shown that a unique wood grain pattern at the apex of forks in hazel trees (Corylus avellana L.) acts to hold together the branches in this species, and this is probably the case in most other woody plants and trees.Slater, D. and Ennos, A. R. (2013) Determining the mechanical properties of hazel forks by testing their component parts, Trees 27 (6) 1515-1524Slater, D. Bradley, R, Withers, P. and Ennos, A. R.

(2015) Interlocking wood grain patterns provide improved wood strength in forks of hazel (Corylus avellana L.), Arboricultural Journal 37 (1) 1-12 This is an example of 'trade-off' in xylem, where mechanical strength to the tree's junction is gained at the expense of efficiency in tree sap conductance by the production of this specialised wood, known as 'axillary wood'.Domec J.C. & Gartner B.L. (2001) Cavitation and water storage capacity in bole xylem segments of mature and young Douglas-fir trees. Trees 15, 204‚Äì214 The complex interlocking wood grain patterns developed in axillary wood present a great opportunity for biomimicry (the mimicking of natural biological structures in man-made materials) in fibrous materials, where the production of a Y-shaped or T-shaped component is needed:Burns L.A., Mouritz A.P., Pook D. and Feih, S. (2012) Bio-inspired design of aerospace composite joints for improved damage tolerance; Composite Structures 94 995‚Äì1004 particularly in such components that may need to act as a conduit for liquids as well as being mechanically strong. Tree fork morphology has been shown to alter with the angle of inclination of the fork from the vertical axis.Buckley, G. Slater, D. and Ennos, A. R. (2015) Angle of inclination affects the morphology and strength of bifurcations in hazel (Corylus avellana L.), Arboricultural Journal 37 (2) 99-112 As the fork becomes more tilted from the vertical, the branches become more elliptical in cross-section, to adapt to the additional lateral loading upon them, and Buckley, Slater and Ennos (2015) showed that this adaption resulted in stronger tree forks when the fork was more inclined away from the vertical. Bark inclusions and fork strength Where a junction forms in a tree and bark is incorporated into the join, this is referred to as an 'included bark junction' or 'bark inclusion'. A common cause of bark being incorporated into the junction is that the junction is braced by the touching of branches or stems set above that junction (in arboriculture, these branch interactions are termed 'natural braces'). Such included bark junctions can be substantially weaker in strength than normal tree forks, and can become a significant hazard in a tree, particularly when the bracing branches are shaded out or pruned out of the tree.Lonsdale, D. (1999) Principles of Tree Hazard Assessment and Management, TSO: LondonSmiley, E. T. (2003) Does included bark reduce the strength of co-dominant stems? Journal of Arboriculture 29 (2): 104-106 Research has shown that in hazel trees, the more the included bark is occluded within new wood growth, the stronger that junction will be, with the weakest forks being those with a large amount of unoccluded bark at their apex.Slater, D. and Ennos, A. R. (2015) The level of occlusion of included bark affects the strength of bifurcations in hazel (Corylus avellana L.) Journal of Arboriculture and Urban Forestry 41 (4): 194-207 Common tree care practices are to prune out such bark-included forks at an early stage of the tree's development, to brace the two arising branches above such a junction so that they can not split apart (using a flexible brace) or to reduce the length of the smaller arising branch, so that it is subordinated to the larger branch.Gilman E. F. (2012) Illustrated guide to pruning; third edition; Delmar publishers, Albany, NY. Care should be taken not to prune out 'natural braces' set above weak tree forks in mature trees unless that is absolutely necessary.Slater D.(2016) Assessment of Tree Forks; Arboricultural Association, Stroud, UK. An included bark junction formed in a wild cherry tree (Prunus avium) The strength of a normally-formed tree fork can be assessed by its shape and the presence and location of axillary wood: those that are more U-shaped are typically considerably stronger than those that are V-shaped at their apex.Turner, S., Slater, D. and Ennos, A. R. (2012) Failure of forks in clonal varieties of Platanus x acerifolia; Arboricultural Journal 34 179-189 This characteristic, and the presence of bark included in a tree fork, are important attributes for tree surveyors and tree contractors to note in order to assess whether the tree fork is a defect in the structure of a tree.Lonsdale, D.(2000) Hazards from Trees: A general guide; Forestry Commission Practice Guide; TSO A junction with included bark that failed in storm conditions, growing on a hazel tree (Corylus avellana) Tree fork, rejoining together again  See also  * Arboriculture * Biomimicry * Branch attachment * Branch collar * da Vinci branching rule  References  External links  * * International Society of Arboriculture * Arboricultural Association, U.K. * Hazards from Trees, Forestry Commission, U.K. Category:Trees Category:Forest management Category:Plant morphology Category:Plant anatomy ","title":"Tree fork"},{"id":"41838296","title":"List of members of the European United Left‚ÄìNordic Green Left, 2009‚Äì14"},{"id":"41838299","text":"Joseph de Joannis (6 June 1864 La Meignanne, Maine-et-Loire, Pays de la Loire ‚Äì 27 October 1932 Paris) was a French clergyman and amateur entomologist.

History The museum is located in the oldest still existing town house in the old town of Charlottenburg. It was originally constructed in 1712 following plans drawn by Eosander von G√∂the, the royal architect of Frederick I of Prussia. The Senate of Berlin placed the dilapidated building on its list of significant cultural heritage in 1981. On 24 December 1983 the owner illegally tried to demolish the house but was prevented by public outcry. The building was taken over by the district and renovated by the architect Ulli B√∂hme using 18th century construction materials and methods. The renovation with a classical facade was publicly funded. Exhibitions and collection Exhibitions are organized by the Association of Friends of the Berlin Ceramics Museum, which leases the building from the district Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf. The collection consists mainly of 19th and 20th century objects, including works by Peter Behrens, Charles Crodel, Margarete Heymann, Max Laeuger, Otto Lindig, Hedwig Marquardt and Henry van de Velde.

He was born in Vugrovec. He received a degree in philosophy and law in 1831 in Zagreb. From 1831 he was employed at the Tabula Banalis and in a law clerk office. He was an associate of Ljudevit Gaj and an editor of the Novine horvatske (1835-1842). Together with Ljudevit Vukotinoviƒá and Stanko Vraz he founded and edited magazine Kolo in 1842. Since 1841 he served as a secretary of the Economic Society and an editor of several of its publications. He also edited Koledar za puk (1847-1850). He founded the magazine Gospodarki list and edited it in 1841-1850. He became the first curator of the National Museum in 1846. In his youth Rakovac wrote, translated and adapted works in the Kajkavian dialect (Theodor K√∂rner and others). His adaptation of a monodrama by August von Kotzebue Stari mlado≈æenja i ko≈°arice was published in 1832. The only preserved original dramatic work of his is a dramatic poem Duh (\\"Spirit\\", 1832), while the play Veronika od Desenic, started in 1831, is today is only known by its title. His first work in the ≈†tokavian dialect was published in 1835 in the first issue of Danica ilirska, where he continued to publish Illyrian patriotic and later love poetry (Sila ljubavi, 1837 and others), foreshadowing romantic Neopetrarchism. According to a Slovakian template he wrote a poem Duh slavjanski (\\"The Slavic Spirit\\"), from which three stanzas became the anthem of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Hey, Slavs). Together with Ljudevit Vukotinoviƒá he published the first Croatian anthology of patriotic poetry: Pjesmarica: pjesme domorodne in 1842. In his political essay Mali katekizam za velike ljude (\\"A small catechism for great people\\", 1842) he defends the dignity of the Croatian language and the right to defend the Croatian national identity against the Hungarian encroachments. His memoirs Dnevnik (1922) were published posthumously, and represent an important historical account of the Illyrian movement. He died in Zagreb.

The establishment of the commission followed the death of four workers (aged from 16 to 25 years) who died in separate incidents that may have been attributed to the failure to identify and manage the workplace health and safety and other risks associated with the implementation and management of the Program. The Royal Commission inquired into and reported on the deaths, serious injuries and impacts on longstanding home insulation businesses alleged to have arisen from the Program. The Royal Commission commenced on 12 December 2013 and was overseen by a sole Royal Commissioner, Ian Hanger, , a barrister. The Commissioner was asked to submit his report to the Governor-General by 30 June 2014. The report was tabled to parliament on 1 September 2014. Background A measure, known as the \\"Energy Efficient Homes Package\\", was announced by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd on 3 February 2009. A component of that Package was the \\"Homeowner Insulation Program\\", which was replaced on 1 July 2009 by the \\"Home Insulation Program\\" (both of which form the Program). The Home Insulation Program was administered by the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts. The Package and Program were established in the context of the First Rudd Government's use of expansionary fiscal policies at their discretion to counter the effects of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. The Energy Efficient Homes Package was a part of the 42 billion Nation Building ‚Äì Economic Stimulus Plan. Pursuant to the Administrative Arrangement Orders of 3 December 2007, Peter Garrett was appointed as the Minister for the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts, and Penny Wong became the Minister for Climate Change and Water. In a reshuffle of the ministry in March 2010, the responsibility for the Package was transferred from Garrett to Wong. David Borthwick was appointed as departmental secretary on 3 December 2007, serving until 2009; with Robyn Kruk serving during 2009 and 2010. Deaths and inquest recommendations As the program was delivered into communities, four males (aged 16 to 25 years) who worked as home insulation installers, died in four separate incidents between October 2009 and February 2010. Two workers died as a result of electrocution installing foil lined insulation; one worker was electrocuted installing fibreglass \\"pink batts\\" (all three in Queensland); and one worker died from hyperthermia, also installing \\"pink batts\\" (in New South Wales). On 9 February 2010, four days afters the fourth death, the Commonwealth Government suspended the use of foil insulation; and the entire Home Insulation Program was discontinued on 19 February 2010. Coronial inquests were held in both New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland (Qld) into the death(s) in each jurisdiction. Magistrate Hugh Dillon, the Deputy State Coroner of NSW, made nine recommendations that related to: # \\"...improving publicity campaigns emphasising the risks of heat stress..., and the importance of regular consumption of water ... as a primary means of preventing heat stress or heat stroke;\\" # \\"...the Australian Construction Training Service (\\"ACTS\\") conducting random audits of registered ... training organisations ... to assess the appropriateness and effectiveness of the training;\\" # \\"...the ACTS requiring registered ... training organisations to certify that courses they conduct have included a practical component and assessment ... with an appropriate standard set by the ACTS;\\" # \\"...the ACTS consider requiring that ... registered ... training organisations certify [the trainees] have either passed or not passed the practical component and assessment;\\" # \\"...the ACTS amend its insulation industry training materials to include a specific reference to the topic of heat exhaustion and heat stroke and the need for regular hydration with water;\\" # \\"...the ACTS consider having its insulation industry materials reviewed by a specialist adult educationist to ensure that they meet \\"best practice\\" educational standards ....;\\" # \\"...ComSec Global Training (\\"ComSec\\") modifying its insulation industry training materials to include a specific reference to the topic of heat exhaustion ... and the need for regular hydration with water;\\" # \\"...Standards Australia amending the [relevant standard] to include a reference to managing hot conditions; and # \\"...the Minister for Finance [ensure] that guidelines for Australian Government programs include a standard reference to the requirement for compliance with State and Federal occupational health and safety legislation...\\" The State Coroner of Queensland, Michael Barnes, made five recommendations, namely that: # \\"...the Office of Fair and Safe Work Queensland undertakes a review of state-based workplace safety agencies [that] failed to proactively respond to [the] increased risk of harm...;\\" # \\"...the Office of Fair and Safe Work Queensland undertake a public awareness campaign giving guidance as to how home occupiers and relevant tradespeople can minimise their exposure to the risk of electrical shock inherent in entering a residential roof space...;\\" # \\"...the State Government [of Queensland] assess the competing policy considerations with expert advice from the Electrical Safety Office about the various options for the extension of the requirement for the mandatory fitting residual current devices in ... residential premises;\\" # \\"...the Director of Public Prosecution consider whether charges of perjury should be laid against a witness at the inquest;\\" and # \\"...the [Queensland] Department of Justice and the Attorney-General ... consider ... whether ... prosecution[s] should occur alleging breaches of the ... Workplace Health and Safety Act... [and] the Electrical Safety Act;\\" Operational matters and inquiries Allegations of fraud under the program were made, with three cases forwarded to the Australian Federal Police for investigation. In March 2010 the Federal Government announced a proposal to remove foil insulation or make it safe from houses and undertake another inspections. In March 2011, 35 search warrants were executed targeting alleged fraud by businesses and individuals in New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria. Climate Change and Energy Efficiency Minister, Greg Combet, stated that the Government would pursue those alleged unscrupulous operators who had fraudulently abused this program. The Auditor- General, Ian McPhee, identified shortcomings in the way the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts handled the program's implementation as it faced pressure from to establish the program during the height of the global financial crisis. The report stated that the department requested the program be rolled out over five years but that this request was denied because of the desire to stimulate the economy and create jobs. McPhee also reported the department underestimated the level of risk involved in an unregulated industry which used inexperienced workers to install insulation in ceiling spaces. At its peak, demand for the program more than doubled original expectations. In his report, McPhee stated that as problems mounted, the then minister, Garrett, did not have his requests for information answered promptly and then, when it was provided, it was \\"overly optimistic\\" and contained factual errors. The Auditor-General did not make any recommendations because the program was closed by the time he reported. Appointment of Commissioner On 12 December 2013, the Governor-General Quentin Bryce, issued Commonwealth Letters Patent pursuant to \\"the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia\\", the and other enabling powers\\" appointing Ian Hanger, as the sole Commissioner and the commission's terms of reference. The commissioner was directed \\"...to inquire into the matters that may have arisen from the development and implementation of the [Home Insulation] Program, and related matters...\\" Terms of Reference The Commissioner was appointed to investigate \\"...into the matters that may have arisen from the development and implementation of the [Home Insulation] Program, and related matters...\\" Those matters were defined in the Letters Patent as follows: :a. the processes by which the Australian Government made decisions about the establishment and implementation of the Program, and the bases of those decisions, including how workplace health and safety and other risks relating to the Program were identified, assessed and managed; :b. whether the Australian Government was given, or sought, any advice, warnings or recommendations by or from industry representatives, regulatory authorities or other agencies of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory during the establishment and implementation of the Program, and what action the Australian Government took in response to any such advice, warnings or recommendations; :c. whether, in establishing or implementing the Program, the Australian Government: ::i. failed to have sufficient regard to workplace health and safety or other risks relating to the Program; or ::ii. failed to have sufficient regard to advice, warnings or recommendations mentioned in paragraph (b); or ::iii. failed to deal adequately with the risks, advice, warnings or recommendations; and, if so, why sufficient regard was not had to the risks, advice, warnings or recommendations, or why they were not dealt with adequately; :d. whether the death of: ::i.

Powers The powers of Royal Commissions in Australia are set out in the enabling legislation, the . Royal Commissions, appointed pursuant to the Royal Commissions Act or otherwise, have powers to issue a summons to a person to appear before the Commission at a hearing to give evidence or to produce documents specified in the summons; require witnesses to take an oath or give an affirmation; and require a person to deliver documents to the Commission at a specified place and time. A person served with a summons or a notice to produce documents must comply with that requirement, or face prosecution for an offence. The penalty for conviction upon such an offence is a fine of or six months imprisonment. A Royal Commission may authorise the Australian Federal Police to execute search warrants. Procedures and methods The Royal Commission served over 125 summonses to produce documents and received over relevant documents in response; and its first few months involved the collection and examination of information about the former Home Insulation Program. The Commission also held discussions with 120 potential witnesses to clarify the assistance they may be willing to provide to the Royal Commission. Sitting over 37 days of public hearings, in excess of 50 witnesses testified in the period from December 2013 until May 2014. The purpose of the public hearings was to hear evidence about: * the process by which the Australian Government made decisions about the establishment and implementation of the Program * the process by which the Australian Government identified, assessed and managed workplace health and safety and other risks relating to the Program * whether the Australian Government had sufficient regard for risks and whether the Australian Government dealt with warnings or information about risks adequately * whether the deaths of Fuller, Barnes, Sweeney and Wilson could have been avoided if the Australian Government had taken a different approach to identifying, assessing or managing workplace health and safety risks * the effects of the Program on the families of Fuller, Barnes, Sweeney and Wilson, and * the effects of the Program on pre- existing home insulation businesses. Leave to appear before the Commission was granted to Kevin Rudd, Mark Arbib, Mike Mrdak, Peter Garrett, the State of Queensland, the Australian Government, and representatives of the Fuller, Barnes, Sweeney and Wilson families. Former Prime Minister Julia Gillard was also summonsed to appear and ministers were served notice that they should surrender any documents in their possession relating to the Home Insulation Program. Hearings During March and May 2014, a science and engineering expert who was employed as a technical adviser for the Home Insulation Program on performance and safety issues testified before the Royal Commission that he was verbally threatened when he raised safety concerns about the program. He gave verbal and written evidence before the Royal Commission that two senior Environment Department officials told him safety was not a concern and that the Program had been poorly costed. After raising his concerns with a senior public servant, twenty minutes later his contact was terminated. Appearing before the Royal Commission on 13 and 14 May 2014, Mark Abib testified that it was up to public servants to tell him and other politicians of the potentially lethal problems in the program. Peter Garrett appeared before the Royal Commission on 13 and 14 May. He testified that he bore \\"ultimate responsibility\\" for the home insulation program. Kevin Rudd appeared before the Royal Commission on 14 and 15 May; the first time an Australian Prime Minister had been called before a Royal Commission. Much of Rudd's statement to the inquiry was redacted by the Australian Government Solicitor, claiming Cabinet secrecy reasons. Rudd's counsel, Bret Walker said his client could not tell his side of the story while being met with a \\"devastating truncation of the truth\\". The Royal Commissioner dismissed the redaction and in a subsequent appearance before the Royal Commission, released from long-standing Cabinet secrecy rules, Rudd testified that if Cabinet had been warned of safety risks, the program's rollout in 2009 would have been delayed. He also gave evidence that the stimulus package had a colour-coding system: \\"green for 'on track'; amber for maintaining 'close watch'; and red for 'in difficulty'.\\" Of the eight reports during 2009-10, all recorded the HIP as \\"on track\\" until March 2010. By then, the four young men had died and the program had shut down. On 16 May, Greg Combet appeared before the Royal Commission and testified that the program had problems from the start, claiming \\"flaws in the design of it\\" and that the risks were ongoing. He stated, \\"When I was given the job of remediating all the problems I tried to be as fair as I could to industry and help as much as I could but ultimately the damage was done by the program itself and the operation of a lot of unscrupulous operators.\\" The same day, representatives of the Fuller and Barnes' families gave written and oral statements. Kevin Fuller, the father of Matthew Fuller, testified before the Royal Commission that his son was employed as an insulation installer by a bankrupt telemarketing company. He testified that Matthew's employer was clearly \\"dodgy\\" and did not provide the adequate training but only got a two- year good behaviour bond and a fine for a few thousand dollars; and that he considered \\"(Kevin) Rudd to be one of the main people responsible for Matthew's death and the deaths of three others.\\" Ruben Barnes' sister, Sunny gave evidence that as the result of her brother's death, the formerly close- knit family had broken down. Reports The federal government requested a final report from the Royal Commission not later than 30 June 2014. In May 2014 the Governor-General agreed to an extension of the reporting period, not later than 31 August 2014. The report was tabled in parliament on 1 September 2014. According to Prime Minister Tony Abbott, the findings of the commission found seven major failings that led to the deaths.

The Ems-Leine-Express is notable for crossing the state border between Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) three times at the following locations: *between Ibbenb√ºren-Laggenbeck and Osnabr√ºck Altstadt *between Melle and B√ºnde *between Minden and B√ºckeburg.  History and future  In 1998, the service began in Bad Bentheim and went via Osnabr√ºck to Hanover. In 2000, the section west of Rheine was withdrawn and services were extended to Brunswick (Braunschweig). The Bad Bentheim‚ÄìRheine route is now served only by the Wiehengebirgs-Bahn. The Ems-Leine-Express services were initially operated by DB Regio Nord. New procedures for procuring future operations of the services were introduced In 2012. It is now operated by WestfalenBahn for 15 years from 2015. The service is designated as RE 60 only in North Rhine-Westphalia. The service was named the Ems-Leine-Express with the introduction of the integrated regular-interval timetable in the whole of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW-Takt) in 1998.  Rail services  The service runs every two hours. Together with the service designated as the Weser-Leine Express in NRW, which also runs every two hours to Bielefeld, an hourly service is provided between Braunschweig and L√∂hne. The Wiehengebirgs-Bahn runs every hour between Kirchlengern and Rheine. These services connect with the Weser-Leine-Express in Herford. In addition, the total route is served by Intercity services. The service is operated with trains of five double-deck coaches hauled mostly by class 111, or occasionally class 146, locomotives. Since the line is operated with a double-deck driving trailer‚Äìpushed towards Rheine‚Äìthe locomotive does not have to be switched around at the terminus. A dining service with a minibar is provided between Osnabr√ºck and Hanover.  Fares  The Ems-Leine-Express passes through the territory of four regional transport associations with different fare systems: *between Rheine and Osnabr√ºck, the M√ºnsterlandtarif (M√ºnsterland tariff) of the Verkehrsgemeinschaft M√ºnsterland (transport community of M√ºnsterland) applies; *between B√ºnde and Minden, the Der Sechser (‚Äúthe six) fare of the Verkehrsverbund OstWestfalenLippe (transport association of OstWestfalenLippe) applies; *between Haste and H√§melerwald the fares of the Gro√üraum-Verkehr Hannover (transport association of greater Hannover, GVH) apply; *between H√§melerwald and Brunswick the fares of the Verbundtarif Region Braunschweig (Brunswick fare alliance, VRB) apply. Fares for the entire state of Lower Saxony (e.g. the Niedersachsen-Ticket) also apply to the North Rhine- Westphalian sections (B√ºckeburg‚ÄìMelle and Osnabr√ºck‚ÄìRheine). However, these tickets cannot be used for connections via Herford (for trains towards NRW the fare limit is L√∂hne or Kirchlengern). The NRW-Tarif (fare) applies between Rheine and Minden for all locations except Melle, while NRW holiday tickets apply to the whole route. The Osnabr√ºck‚ÄìB√ºnde section does not belong to the zones of any local fare system and so ordinary Deutsche Bahn fares apply. GVH fares apply for season tickets from B√ºckeburg.  Railways  Ems-Leine- Express hauled by class 111 locomotive towards Braunschweig in B√ºnde station Sign in B√ºnde ‚Äì Die Zigarrenstadt (\\"B√ºnde ‚Äì the cigar city\\") From west to east the Ems-Leine-Express uses the following lines: *the L√∂hne‚ÄìRheine railway (124 km between Rheine and L√∂hne, part of timetable route 375) *the Hamm‚ÄìMinden railway (21 km between L√∂hne and Minden, part of timetable route 370) * the Hanover‚ÄìMinden railway (64.4 km between Minden and Hanover, part of timetable route 370) *the Hanover‚ÄìBrunswick railway (61 km between Hanover and Brunswick, part of timetable route 310). Overall, the service between Rheine and Brunswick covers a distance of 270.4 kilometres. The scheduled time (including intermediate stops) between Rheine and Braunschweig is 3:03, resulting in an average cruising speed of about 90 km/h. Four train sets consisting of locomotive, double-deck carriages and driving trailers are used for the service.

Spanner's designs included dining and lounge chairs, tables, and modular storage units.

His furniture lines were sold and distributed at department store chains and independent merchants. \\"The Ruspan Originals line was boxy and geometric, but most of all it was simple, functional and modern, all qualities that appealed to young post-war couples buying furniture for their new houses or apartments.\\" Spanner's designs utilized innovative manufacturing techniques such as curved plywood and non-upholstered, woven-web seating. Many of the designs reused components and shared consistent proportions, which gave his work a characteristic aesthetic. Among his three residential furniture lines (Ruspan Originals, Catalina, and Pasadena) the Lounge Chair with Arms has been described as the \\"best-known and most desirable\\" design.

It connects the Beyoƒülu and Fatih districts on the European side of Istanbul, and is located between the Galata Bridge and Atat√ºrk Bridge, approximately east of the latter. It is the fourth bridge across the Golden Horn and entered service on February 15, 2014. The bridge enables a direct connection between the Hacƒ±osman metro station in the Sarƒ±yer district (at the northern end of the M2 line), with the Yenikapƒ± transport hub in the Fatih district (at the southern end of the M2 line.) Project Golden Horn Metro Bridge under construction in February 2013, with the Atat√ºrk Bridge in the background. The appearance of the bridge project in the general agenda goes back to 1952. After the approval of the metro line by the city's Monument Protection Board and the completion of the tunnels relating to the metro line, a construction bid for the metro bridge spanning the Golden Horn was published by the Metropolitan Municipality. By 2005, a total of 21 proposals were submitted to the Monument Protection Board; however, none were found to be sufficiently in harmony with the city's skyline. A successful design, by architect Hakan Kƒ±ran, was controversial from the very beginning. In November 2009, the tower height was reduced from the initially projected to because the original height threatened the removal of Istanbul from the UNESCO list of World Heritage sites. The top level of cables was changed from , and later in July 2011, it was further lowered to . This revised design was approved in February 2012. The bridge's conceptual design was carried out by French engineer and bridge specialist Michel Virlogeux, who also designed the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge (Third Bosphorus Bridge) at the Bosphorus strait in Istanbul. Turkish architect Hakan Kƒ±ran was responsible for the architectural design and the construction supervision. Wiecon Consulting Engineers & Architects did the structural engineering work for the bridge. It was built by a consortium of the Italian Astaldi SpA and the Turkish G√ºlermak Aƒüƒ±r Sanayi ƒ∞n≈üaat ve Taahh√ºt A.≈û. Construction began on January 2, 2009, and was initially planned to be completed within 600 days. The construction time was extended, and the bridge was completed on January 9, 2013. Test runs of the metro line on the bridge began the next day, and the bridge went into service on 15 February 2014.http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/golden-horn-metro- bridge-opens.html Budgeted cost of the construction was 146.7 million. Due to the historical character of the surroundings, the project underwent revisions relating to the alignment of the metro line. The discovery of a Byzantine-era vault on the Unkapanƒ± bank during excavation works for pier foundations forced a redesign of the project. The design of the swing bridge operator's command building had to be revised when the wall of a Byzantine-era basilica and a graveyard on the same bank came to light. Architecture The bridge connects the Beyoƒülu and Fatih districts on the northern and southern shores of the Golden Horn. S√ºleymaniye Mosque and Beyazƒ±t Tower are seen in the background. The cable-stayed bridge has an overall length of between Azapkapƒ± (Beyoƒülu) and Unkapanƒ± (Fatih), and a span of over water. The longest span between the two towers is . It is flanked by viaducts at both sides, which connect the bridge with the metro tunnels on the opposite banks of the Golden Horn. Nine cables are connected to each side of the two towers in harp-design starting at a height of . To restrain the soft bedrock, dozens of steel pipe piles with diameters of and , supplied from Europe, were driven using a hydraulic hammer more than deep into ground. The two steel supporting towers are high, Each resting on a nine-pile group while for the side supports four-pile or five- pile groups are built. The bridge carries two metro railway tracks in the middle and a sidewalk in each direction at a height of above sea level. The deck is a box girder. On the Unkapanƒ± side, a swing bridge, essentially a cantilever structure, is to allow passage for large ships. It has and spans, which rest on a central pier. Controlled from a room on a platform between the bridge and the shoreline, the swing bridge turns in right angle about the vertical axis after lifting, and provides about free clearance within four to six minutes. It is planned that the swing bridge will be open once a week between the early hours of 1:00 and 5:00 in the summer time, and twice a week during these hours in the winter months. The gray color of the bridge was determined after extensive photographic studies of the surroundings. The south tower of bridge and S√ºleymaniye Mosque in the background A metro station with platform, suitable for holding an 8-car train, is situated in the middle of the bridge. The station extends across the full length of the main span, and is capped with a canopy. The color of the metro station on the bridge is light brown. It is expected that the metro line over the bridge will transport around one million passengers daily. Controversy Hali√ß metro station of the M2 line on the bridge. The construction of the Golden Horn Metro Bridge faced some opposition over its design. Chambers of architects and city planners, as well as many citizens criticized that the original plans approved by UNESCO were changed without permission. The design and the number of the bridge trestles have been altered; these lead to disturbance of the skyline of the city's historical area. The piers are much higher than approved. The metro station is in the middle of the bridge, and is argued to be without any logical function as it would be unusual for anyone to get off a train while in the middle of a bridge, but it has exits to both banks and thus can serve the respective areas.

Despite being dubbed into Telugu, the film was remade into Telugu as Khaidi No. 150, starring Chiranjeevi.  Plot  In Kolkata, prisoner Kathiresan, a petty criminal, helps the police capture an escaping prisoner Vivek Banerjee but escapes afterwards. He goes to Chennai in order to escape to Bangkok with his friend and fellow-criminal Ravi. However, he drops this plan after meeting and falling in love with Ankitha, who dupes him into believing that she wants to marry him after realising that he is having a crush on her. Later, Kathir and Ravi notice a doppelg√§nger of Kathir named Jeevanandam being shot by a group of thugs. They admit him to a hospital, and Kathir decides to impersonate the injured Jeeva to escape from the police. Under the name of Jeeva, Kathir and Ravi enter an old-age home run by Jeeva with the aim of collecting 25 lakhs (meant for the inmates of the old-age home) for their Bangkok trip, until he learns about his doppelg√§nger's mission. Jeeva is a communist ideologue and post-graduate in hydrology from the arid village of Thanoothu in Tirunelveli district who had discovered groundwater under some lands of the village which could be used as an irrigation source not only for the village, but for the entire Tirunelveli district and the neighbouring Thoothukudi district. However, a greedy MNC owner Chirag cheated the villagers into giving their lands for the construction of a factory. Jeeva gets arrested by the police, and six villagers commit suicide to bring this news to the media forefront and release Jeeva from prison. On learning of the plight of Jeeva and the villagers, Kathir decides to fight for their cause while still under the name of Jeeva. The people of the old home and Kathir go to the jury and try to convince him to go in favour of them, but Kathir starts stating rules and scares the main jury person (whom Chirag had bribed). Kathir then sends a person (disguised as a hairdresser) to Chirag and makes him lay a fingerprint on Chirag's neck. After that, Chirag sends 50 men to kill Kathir, but he soon defeats them. Meanwhile, the real Jeeva gains consciousness and finds himself in the Kolkata prison where Kathir was locked up. With the help of Vivek, who has heard his story and has plans to kill Kathir in revenge for getting him caught and thrown back into prison, he escapes with Vivek's henchmen. Unaware that Jeeva and Vivek's henchmen are headed for Chennai, Kathir makes efforts to convince the media to bring the plight of the villagers to national consciousness, but the media is not interested as they feel it is not a sensational news. A few days later, at the Madras High Court, the judge declares the verdict in favour of Jeeva and the villagers, but adds that Chirag has claimed that certain villagers who are working abroad have shown their support for the factory. If they cannot prove that their support was faked by Chirag within the next five days, the verdict will go in favour of Chirag, and the villagers will lose their lands. Since the villagers, who have denied supporting the factory, are abroad and cannot come to Chennai within five days to rebut Chirag's claims as their passports are held by their contractors, and the verdict is to be decided within five days, Kathir decides to take drastic measures to sensationalise the issue. He, Ankitha, Ravi, and the inmates of the old-age home block water supply to Chennai by sitting on the pipelines which carry water to Chennai from five lakes. With the plight of the Chennaites due to no water supply having gained national attention, Kathir comes out of the pipeline after a few days and highlights the villagers' plight in an emotionally charged speech to the media, which is telecast nationwide and moves many people. By now, Kathir has discovered that Jeeva has escaped and is searching for him. Meanwhile, Jeeva and Vivek's henchmen reach Chennai, but Jeeva is kidnapped by Chirag's henchmen. While in Chirag's custody, he sees Kathir's speech on television and is moved by the efforts made by his doppelg√§nger to help the villagers. On the night before the verdict, Kathir's bluff is exposed, but Kathir promises the villagers that he will surely help them and tells that Jeeva is alive, and he will rescue Jeeva from Chirag and hand him back over to the villagers with the assurance of a positive verdict. Kathir goes to Chirag's office, where Jeeva is being held. He rescues Jeeva and kills Chirag. The next day, the verdict is declared in favour of Jeeva and the villagers. Kathir, despite his efforts to thwart Chirag and the MNC, does not take part in the ensuing celebrations over the verdict and instead surrenders to the police and returns to the Kolkata prison, but not before promising Ankitha, who has now fallen in love with him, that he will marry her once he is released.

Murugadoss confirmed the same on his Twitter page. According to sources, the film was not a sequel to Thuppakki. Ayngaran International and Lyca Productions were confirmed to be the producers and distributors of the film. Murugadoss replaced his usual music director Harris Jayaraj with Anirudh Ravichander and signed George C. Williams as the cinematographer, who had filmed Raja Rani, (2013) which was produced by Murugadoss himself. Art director Lalgudi N. Ilayaraja, who had won the National Film Award for Best Production Design in Vishwaroopam (2013), was selected to handle the art direction for the film. The film was earlier rumoured to be titled as Dheeran. Another potential title for the film was Vaal. In March 2014, Murugadoss confirmed that the film would be titled Kaththi and that it was scheduled to be released on Deepavali.  Casting  In September 2013, Samantha Ruth Prabhu was selected as the lead female lead. Bengali actor Tota Roy Chowdhury was signed for portraying the antagonist role, an international gangster named Vivek Banerjee. In March 2014, Bollywood actor Neil Nitin Mukesh was selected to be a part of his project, thereby making his d√©but in Tamil cinema through the film. Murugadoss also stated that Vijay would play a dual role. Sathish was chosen to play a supporting role. Sayaji Shinde and Subbu Panchu were selected to play pivotal roles in the film. Neil was inspired by his look in his d√©but film, Johnny Gaddaar (2007). He described his character as one who does not \\"fight the hero with physical power, but with intelligence\\". He learned Tamil for his role, as he did not want to speak his dialogues without understanding their meaning. Neil had lost weight for the role and modelled his looks to be along the lines of Brad Pitt and David Beckham.  Filming  The film was launched in Kolkata on 3 February 2014 by its producers Ayngaran International with a pooja ceremony in front of the Kalighat Kali Temple, after which principal photography began. The first schedule of filming was done on Kolkata and Hyderabad. In between, Murugadoss, took a break to promote his then upcoming Bollywood film, Holiday: A Soldier Is Never Off Duty (2014), the Hindi remake of Thuppakki (2012). The film was then shot in Pushpa gardens in Chennai, where a huge set which costed around was erected and most of the indoor scenes were completed in this set. Shooting continued for a 40-day-long schedule in and around the city. By July 2014, 60% of the shooting had been completed and the team shot a few scenes in Kadapa. The final leg of the film began on 1 August 2014 at Chennai. In late August 2014, 15 days of filming, including patch-work and a few fight sequences, remained. Filming moved back to Hyderabad, where the rest of the fight sequences were canned. On 1 September 2014, the second half of the film was nearly completed. Additional filming took place at the Chennai Central railway station. On 4 September 2014, Neil Nitin Mukesh dubbed in Tamil himself for his role and completed his dubbing portions for the first half of the film. The climax sequences were shot in Nellore on 23 September 2014. The song \\"Selfie Pulla\\" was shot in Mumbai. About 100 dancers participated in the song sequence. Filming of the song was completed on 30 September 2014, with the filming of the entire film also being completed as a result.  Themes and influences  As Thuppakki (2012), the actor-director's previous collaboration, is based on stopping terrorism by tracking down, destroying and deactivating the sleeper cells. This film deals with farmers whom are against with corporate encroachment. The film portrays incidents, like the 2G spectrum corruption case, and encroachment of Pepsi company in the banks of river Thamirabharani. A petition was filed against the film, for the 2G dialogue, however the issue has not been considered. The character Jeevanantham, played by Vijay in the film, is inspired from a real-life social activist.  Music  The soundtrack album and background score were composed by Anirudh Ravichander, in his first collaboration with Vijay and A. R. Murugadoss. The soundtrack album consists of seven tracks, with lyrics written by Madhan Karky, Yugabharathi, Pa. Vijay and Hiphop Tamizha. On 22 June 2014, coinciding with actor Vijay's birthday, a theme music which was accompanied with the motion poster was released on YouTube. The album songs, in its entirety was released on 24 September 2014, at the audio launch event held at The Leela Palace Hotel in Chennai. The songs as well as the film score was widely appreciated; On 28 January 2015, the crew released the film's original background score in a jukebox format on YouTube, to coincide with the film's 100-day celebration.Kaththi  BGM Jukebox  100 Days Celebration  Anirudh. YouTube (28 January 2015). Retrieved on 27 September 2016.  Release  Kaththi was released on 22 October 2014, coinciding with the Diwali festival. The film was released in more than 1300 screens worldwide. The film released in 400 screens in Tamilnadu, 350 screens in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, and 200 screens in Kerala, setting a record at screen count. In overseas, the film was released in USA in 96 screens, which stands next to Kochadaiiyaan (2014), which was released in 104 screens, and in Canada, the film released on 21 screens. The film released in United Kingdom on 70 screens, and in France on 24 screens. The film released in Srilanka, on 28 screens, and in Australia on 16 screens. The film was released in Malaysia on 120 screens, which is highest for a Tamil film at that time.  Distribution  The satellite rights of the film were sold to Jaya TV. T. Shibu of Thameens Films promoted and distributed the film in Kerala. The theatrical rights in Tiruchirappalli and Thanjavur were sold to T. Siva. Producer Tagore Madhu bought the film's Telugu dubbing rights. MM Media, previously known as GK Media, acquired the film's theatrical rights in the USA. The film released worldwide on 22 October 2014. It has been dubbed in Hindi as Khaki Aur Khiladi.  Marketing  The first look motion poster was released on 22 June 2014, coinciding with Vijay's birthday. It features a creative design of prominent places in Chennai, and the entire city itself recreated and draped in the form of news headlines. The official teaser of the film was released on 24 September 2014, at the audio launch event. The trailer of the film was unveiled on 15 October 2014, a week ahead of the film's release, and got positive response from viewers.  Controversies = Plagiarism allegations  The 41-second first-look motion poster drew comparisons with the popular minute-long advertisement campaign run by a Turkish newspaper, Sabah, to announce their distribution of the New York Times as a supplement. The original advertisement features iconic images of the cities of New York City and Istanbul, designed using news articles and headlines from the newspaper to show the two cities in the form of newspaper clippings. The motion poster of the film showed prominent places in Chennai and the entire city itself in the form of newspaper clippings and headlines, just like the advertisement campaign, without an acknowledgement to the makers of the original. Minjur Gopi Nayinar filed a case against Murugadoss, claiming that the plot of the film was copied from his novel Mootha Kudi. Responding to the issue, Murugadoss said that he was neither aware of Minjur nor that his story was a copy, further citing the allegation as a tactic by the plaintiff to garner free publicity. He, in turn, requested the court to dismiss the petition. In late September 2014, the court declared the case in Murugadoss's favour, citing lack of proper evidence found against him.  Business link allegations  Subaskaran Allirajah, chairman of Lyca Mobiles, whose company Lyca Productions co-produced the film along with Ayngaran International, was claimed to have had business links with the President of Sri Lanka, Mahinda Rajapaksa. Murugadoss and Karunamoorthy of Ayngaran International met pro- Eelam leaders ‚Äì Pazha Nedumaran, director Seeman and Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi's (VCK) Thol. Thirumavalavan ‚Äî to explain their position regarding the allegation, but the talks proved to be inconclusive at that time. A collective of four student bodies ‚Äì Maatram Maanavar Ilaiyor Iyakkam, Free Tamil Eelam Students Organisation, Tamil Youth and Students Association, and Progressive Students Front ‚Äì in Tamil Nadu called for a ban on the film, stating that the film promoted the economic and political interests of Sri Lanka. The students were willing to reconsider their position on the film if Lyca Productions formally withdrew as producer. In August 2014, directors Seeman and Vikraman showed support for the film. Despite clarifications, as many as 65 Tamil groups came together to oppose the film, leading to speculations regarding Lyca stepping down as producer and handing the reins to another production group. Karunamoorthy, however, again denied that Allirajah had business links with either Mahinda Rajapaksa or his family in any way, further saying that a press meet would be held where all doubts and suspicions regarding Lyca Productions would be clarified and that the film would be released under the Lyca Productions banner. As per Karunamoorthy's statement, a press meet was held on 16 September 2014, where the vice-chairman of Lyca Productions, Premananthan Sivasamy, Subaskaran and Karunamoorthy were present. A statement with a detailed clarification was shown in which it was mentioned that Lyca did not have any business links with Rajapaksa or anyone else related to him, thereby confirming the planned release of the film on Deepavali.

With features of North-German Gothic architecture including an arcade, it was built in 1927 by the prosperous coffee merchant Ludwig Roselius as part of his development of B√∂ttcherstra√üe. Today its newly refurbished dining rooms are part of the Atlantic Grand Hotel. Since 1973, St Petrus House has been a listed building., Retrieved 3 February 2014. History and architecture In 1924, Ludwig Roselius acquired a lease for a period of 60 years on the land on B√∂ttcherstrasse covering No. 15-19 and later also obtained permission to develop the old packhouses at No. 4-5. He persuaded the authorities to let him build a small colony of shops, studios and apartments there, drawing on North German architectural styles. Roselius commissioned the architects Eduard Scotland and Alfred Runge who achieved the required historic Gothic style by making use of dormers, stepped gables and arcades. The complex was first known as Haus HAG (after Roselius' company: Handels-Aktien-Gesellschaft) but the part south of the stepped gable later came to be known as Haus St. Petrus. The building was divided into several sections: the storehouse with a projecting arched entrance, a club house with rooms for members of the Bremen Association of 1914, and a restaurant area. Recent developments For some 30 years, St Petrus House was home to the Bremen casino until it moved to the Schlachte in 2010. Over the years, the building had also been used as a venue for wedding receptions, confirmation parties and anniversaries. In 2011, the Atlantic Grand Hotel undertook substantial refurbishment, combining modernization with the building's history. The white-panelled Scotland Hall was extended to the balcony overlooking the inner courtyard facing the Chamber of Commerce while the other rooms were fitted out for presentations, business meetings and celebrations, with an overall seating capacity of 500. The smallest room the Zelt (tent)‚Äîwith a canopy hanging from the ceiling and red chairs matching the first floor lobby‚Äîhas tables for up to 16 guests. Once known for its roulette tables, the Golden Hall extending over , now has a parquet floor, walls with dark-brown panels topped with gold-tinted wallpaper, and golden chandeliers. Since 1999, the building has also housed the Weinkontor St. Petrus restaurant.

The reason behind this campaign was simple - the environment was a key cause of concern for young people in Azerbaijan as it is in the region and the world. The concern was real. Yet, the path which young people could take to find a way to get engaged in conservation and environmental projects, to network with others, and to mobilize for action was far from clear. Today IDEA is all about working with young people to put environmental awareness and action at the heart of family, community and national life in order to solve serious environmental challenges, from endangered species to industrial pollution. Today IDEA is a key partner of UNEP for promoting environmental projects in Azerbaijan. About International Dialogue for Environmental Action or IDEA is based on the principles of dialogue, action, leadership and education. These are all essential ingredients for equipping a generation to create positive and sustainable environmental change. * Dialogue: Exchange of ideas through regular forum events and local groups ‚Äì both in Azerbaijan and internationally * Action: Participation in youth camps, events and specific environmental projects around the region * Leadership: Encouraging and recognizing young leaders, who can effectively spread the word and lead others in our environmental endeavors * Education: Providing resources to schools, groups and communities, to empower them to protect their environment better IDEA aims at holding a number of environmental actions to draw attention of young people to the necessity of protecting our fragile planet, to focus on the conservation of oceans and coasts, forests, and freshwater ecosystems. Among other issues, it is also concerned with endangered species, pollution and climate change. Publications IDEA regularly publishes reports, fact sheets and other documents on issues related to its work, in order to raise awareness among youth. Global initiatives Actions, such as organizing seminars in the regions, distribution literature, and supporting local environmentalists were taken in order to raise awareness on environmental issues. One of the initiatives - planting of three million trees - corresponded to three million young people living today in Azerbaijan. This was an excellent way to bring Azerbaijani people together and focus on environmental issues. Another IDEA initiative, \\"Reintroduction of gazelles to their historical habitat areas in the Caucasus\\" - aimed at increasing the population of gazelles, including relocation to the areas they before inhabited, from which they disappeared for various reasons. ƒ∞DEA on stamps File:Stamps of Azerbaijan, 2014-1156-souvenir sheet.jpgStamps of Azerbaijan, 2014 File:Stamps of Azerbaijan, 2014-1151-1155.jpgStamps of Azerbaijan, 2014 ReferencesExternal links *Official website Category:Environmental organizations based in Azerbaijan Category:Organizations based in Baku ","title":"International Dialogue for Environmental Action"},{"id":"41839101","text":"Aleksander Veingold (born 10 October 1953, in Tapa, Estonia) is an Estonian chess player, who won the Estonian Chess Championship.

Born into a family of artists based in the city of Birgu (Vittoriosa), she was the daughter of a goldsmith and appraiser for the Knights of Malta. Two of her brothers, Raimondo de Dominici and Francesco de Dominici, were painters. Raimondo's son Bernardo would write a contemporary art history book that included references to Maria. Biography During her teens, de Dominici studied under the painter and sculptor Mattia Preti, who was painting and sculpting the interior of St. John's Co-Cathedral in Valletta at the time. She is believed to have contributed, and is specifically recorded as assisting Preti on his best known work, a series of paintings depicting the life and martyrdom of St John the Baptist (1661‚Äì1666), which decorates the vaults of the co-Cathedral. She was a strong-minded and versatile person; characteristics clearly seen in the two wills she drafted. Giovannantonio Ciantar's Malta Illustrata (1772) paints a picture of a person who knew what she wanted to do with her life from a young age: \\"[Maria showed a] repugnance to apply her energies to female duties and was thus often rebuked by her parents ... She would do nothing other than draw figures and other things according to her whim and natural talents. At last her parents, seeing her so inclined and disposed to painting, provided an art master to teach her design.\\" Being a Carmelite tertiary nun, she was free to live outside the convent walls and away from the constraints of family ties. It appears that she was a quick study who flourished under Preti's tutelage. Giovannantonio Ciantar observes that \\"under his [Preti's] direction she worked well and as he was painting the ceiling of the Church of St John he allowed her to paint some of the female figures; in doing this she succeeded almost more felicitously than the master.\\" This is further corroborated by Giuseppe Maria de Piro's account in Squarci di Storia (1839): \\"[She] superseded any other of his pupils, so much so that the celebrated master chose her to collaborate with him in painting the great vault of the Church of St John, in which the female figures were, to a great extent, executed by her.\\" In 1682, de Dominici left Malta, probably with the entourage of the Grand Master's nephew and his wife Isabella d'Avalos d'Aquino d'Aragona, who, together with her master Preti, encouraged the artist to spread her wings abroad. She eventually had her own studio in Rome, where she began to receive sculpture and painting commissions thanks to letters of introduction from the Grand Master. In Rome, she lived with a woman companion at her studio near San Giovanni dei Fiorentini. Works While in Malta, Maria de Dominici made a number of portable cult figures which were used during local religious festivities and street processions. Several works are attributed to her name, though not all are easily accessible for viewing. The most accessible of de Dominici's works in Malta include: The Visitation, in the ≈ªebbuƒ° parish church; Beato Franco in the Carmelite church of Valletta and Annunciation in the Cathedral Museum of Valletta. Tribute Her profile is included in the two-volume Dictionary of Women Artists, edited by Delia Gaze. In 2010, a crater on Mercury was named after her. It was the inclusion of Delia Gaze's dictionary in the Mercury name bank that led to Dominici's name being applied to the crater lettered 'D' after the second fly-by of the NASA-MESSENGER. As Susanna Hoe remarks in her introduction to Malta: Women, History, Books and Places: \\"Exciting or not as an explanation, the thought of a crater on Mercury named after a neglected Maltese woman artist is delightful, inspiring even, particularly when you come across Maria's crater on the internet, a lovely sight!\\".

The largest Russian-American communities in New York City are located in Brighton Beach and Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn. Brighton Beach has been nicknamed Little Odessa due to its population of Russian-speaking immigrants from Ukraine and Russia. History The first Russian immigrants to the United States arrived during the late 1800s. During the Russian Revolution of 1917, the \\"First Wave\\" of Russians made their way to New York City, most of them moving to Hamilton Heights, Manhattan, and other sections of New York City. The so-called \\"Third Wave\\" of Russians were mostly Russian (Soviet) Jews, who migrated during the 1970s to Brighton Beach. Then after this third wave of Russian immigrants, largely Russian Jews, throughout the 1970s Brighton Beach had a re-growth, after being a neglected area of Brooklyn. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, is the \\"Fourth Wave\\" of Russians, with an increase of various ethnic Russians and Russian Christians who immigrated to the United States with the largest number going to the New York metropolitan area. Majority of the Russian Americans who considered Brighton Beach their home, began to migrate out to Suburbia tri state area during the 1990s. Demographics Russian Orthodox Cathedral of the Transfiguration of Our Lord, Williamsburg, Brooklyn The New York Tri-State area has a population of 1.6 million Russian-Americans and 600,000 of them live in New York City. There are over 220,000 Russian-speaking Jews living in New York City. Approximately 100,000 Russian Americans in the New York metropolitan area were born in Russia. New York City also has a large population of immigrants born in Central Asia, Ukraine, Belarus, and other ex- Soviet states. Most of the Central Asian immigrants are from Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, and due to their Soviet influence, most of them speak the Russian language.Larson, Michael, Bingling Liao, Ariel Stulberg and Anna Kordunsky. \\"Changing Face of Brighton Beach Central Asians Join Russian Jews in Brooklyn Neighborhood.\\" The Jewish Daily Forward. September 17, 2012. Retrieved on February 4, 2014. The New York metropolitan area continues to be by far the leading metropolitan gateway for Russian immigrants into the United States. In 2013, 1,974 individuals immigrated to the New York‚ÄìNorthern New Jersey‚ÄìLong Island statistical area from Russia alone, not including immigrants from other previous Soviet bloc countries; in 2012, this number was 2,286; 1,435 in 2011; and 1,283 in 2010. These numbers do not include the remainder of the New York-Newark-Bridgeport, NY-NJ-CT-PA Combined Statistical Area. Brighton Beach, Brooklyn continues to be the most important demographic and cultural center for the Russian American experience. However, as Russian Americans have climbed in socioeconomic status, the diaspora from Russia and other former Soviet-bloc states has moved toward more affluent parts of the New York metropolitan area, notably Bergen County, New Jersey. Within Bergen County, the increasing size of the Russian immigrant presence in its hub of Fair Lawn prompted a 2014 April Fool's satire titled, \\"Putin Moves Against Fair Lawn\\".

Background His father, Jesse C. Deen, was a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from 1972 to 1988. Deen was born shortly after his parents moved to Bossier Parish. His mother, the former Evelyn Young (born 1930), is a daughter of the late Casper Callaway Young, a Bossier Parish native, and the former Cardille Jones, originally from Simsboro in Lincoln Parish. His father is a native of Grant Parish, a retired educator at the Rocky Mount School in Bossier Parish, a former member of the Bossier Parish Police Jury, and a four-term state legislator. Service as sheriff In 1987, Deen resigned as a deputy sheriff to run against his former boss and fellow Democrat, Sheriff Vol Dooley of Bossier City. Deen unseated Dooley, who was seeking a third full term in the office, 17,113 (62 percent) to 7,973 (28.9 percent). Bill Gray, a third Democratic candidate, held the remaining 2,518 votes (9.1 percent). In 1991, Deen won his second term with 89 percent of the vote over another Democrat, Lillian L. Lewter of Bossier City. Deen was thereafter unopposed in the elections of 1995, 1999, 2003, and 2007. From 1996 to 2001, Deen was the president of the Northwest Division of the Louisiana Commission on Law Enforcement, an agency created under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to direct federal funds to local and state law enforcement entities with the goal of making them more effective in protecting the citizenry. In the aftermath of September 11, 2001, Sheriff Deen provided security for a visit by U.S. President George W. Bush to Barksdale Air Force Base, from which Bush addressed the nation on the terrorist threat. Deen's department, along with some one hundred other patrol cars, barricaded entry to Barksdale to protect Bush from threat that did not materialize. The Bush visit and the terrorist threat subsequently propelled Deen to launch the program \\"Operation Exodus\\", which is designed to preserve vital resources in event of a catastrophe. The program depends heavily on services from retired law-enforcement personnel. In December 2003, Deen was stopped for speeding in East Texas while returning to Bossier Parish from a personal trip to Longview. An altercation with the trooper who stopped him was aired some eight months later on KTBS-TV, the ABC affiliate in Shreveport, adjacent to Bossier Parish. Deen paid an $86 ticket for driving 84 m.p.h., fourteen miles above the limit. He also issued a public apology in which he expressed \\"embarrassment that anything I have done caused any negative shadow to be cast on the parish.\\" In 2008, Governor Bobby Jindal appointed Deen and his Caddo Parish counterpart, Sheriff Steve Prator, to the 27-member Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice, a multi-agency program. In the 2011 nonpartisan blanket primary, Republican Julian Curtis Whittington (born January 1959), a former chief criminal deputy under Deen, won the right to succeed Deen, who decided to retire. Whittington polled more than 68 percent of the vote. Whittingon's closest rival, Mike McConnell, a former deputy sheriff under Deen and also a Republican, received 20 percent of the ballots cast. Prior to the 2011 primary, Deen had endorsed Whittington over McConnell. Deen later changed his voter registration to Republican; so did Vol Dooley. Deen today Deen and his wife, the former Bobbie Joe Williamson (also born 1948), reside in the parish seat of Benton. Their son, Heath Calloway Deen (born 1974), resides in Austin, Texas. In 2014, Deen and Clinton E. Blakey and Clifton D. Blakey, the owners of Blakey Auto Plex, were indicted in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana on one count of federal program theft, conspiracy to commit federal program theft, and failure to file Internal Revenue Service Tax Form 8300. The three are accused of having undervalued a vehicle at $21,375 when it was traded in to Blakey Auto Plex by the Bossier Parish Sheriff's Office in May 2012, a few weeks before Deen's retirement from the position. On October 16, 2014, Deen through his attorney entered a not guilty plea to the charges of federal program theft and conspiracy to commit such theft. He is allowed to remain free while he awaits trial but had to surrender his passport. The Blakeys also pleaded not guilty to the same charges along with the failure to file IRS Tax Form 8300; they two must surrender their passports as they await trial. In November 2016, former Sheriff Deen was issued a summons for simple battery after a dispute at a Benton tire store with Don Martin Whittington (1935-2017), a former Benton town council member and Bossier Parish police juror and the father of Deen's successor as sheriff, Julian Whittington. The argument between the two men allegedly surfaced in regard to Julian Whittington's involvement in a since dismissed federal corruption case which closed after a major witness died under questionable circumstances. Deen is accused of having approached the senior Whittington from the rear and grabbing him. The case could result in a restraining order against Deen which would forbid him from coming in contact with the Whittington family.

History Watchet, then a relatively isolated farming community with a major port on the Bristol Channel since Roman times, had a population with a need for income over the winter months. With access to ample supplies of wood in the Quantock Hills, the earliest records of paper making in the community date back to 1652. In the 15th century, a flour mill had been established in the town near the mouth of the Washford River, by the Fulford and Hadley families. Taken over by Sir John Wyndham in 1616, he was keen to develop further milling facilities on his lands in the town. By 1587 the Wyndham estate had established a fulling and grist mill to the south west, on a farm called Snailholt (the site of today's paper mill factory), which was leased to Silvester Bickham. By 1652, the mill had started to produce some paper, which had been sold to John Saffyn of Cullompton, Devon. By 1727 the tenant of the mill was John Wood, the first of four generations of that family to work the mill until 1834. His son William Wood developed the first paper mill factory on the site from the 1750s. Converting an old apple-fruit press originally used for making cider, paper was initially produced by hand using the locally developed St Decumans process which utilisd a vat, to produce one cart of paper product per week. In 1846 business partners James Date, William Peach and John Wansbrough bought the business from Wood's estate, and introduced mechanised-production via a water wheel powered pulley system. But from the 1860s, the factory started the process of converting to steam power. As the installed Lancashire boilers had initial draughting problems being located in a shelter valley, in 1865 a square-shaped chimney was built of local red bricks from Wellington Brickworks. Its four-sections were each marked by a double-course of buff brick from Ebbw Vale, and further bound by iron-bands. Originally in height, two further sections were added totalling to provide additional up-draught. The chimney survived until 2011, when it was replaced by a new stainless-steel structure and demolished. Having started producing paper bags from 1866, by 1869 Wansbrough's son A.C. Wansbrough was the sole owner. In the same year he introduced the factories first papermaking machine, and by 1871, 26 men, 23 women and 10 boys were employed at the mill. A devout Methodist, Wansbrough built a chapel within the factory grounds and insisted that his employee's worship there at least weekly. By this time the factory employed 120, with a workforce mainly made up of widows, who: took less pay; didn't join unions and hence didn't strike; and reduced the poor relief on parish rates. Most of the mill was destroyed by fire in 1889, but less than ten years later five paper machines were operating, and the mill had become the largest manufacturer of paper bags in the UK. In 1896, the business became a limited liability company as the Wansbrough Paper Company Ltd., hence its modern name. GWR 2-8-0 No.3850 heading a passenger train towards on the preserved West Somerset Railway, passes over a viaduct over both the Wansbrough Paper Mill (behind trees), and the old mineral railway from the Brendon iron ore mines to Watchet harbour. Railway access to the mills private sidings was on the far side of the viaduct. March 2007 On 31 March 1862, the West Somerset Railway was opened from to its terminus at . But it was not until 16 July 1874 that the Minehead Railway Company in extending the line also connected the mill to the railway. Both lines were operated by the Bristol and Exeter Railway, which became part of the Great Western Railway (GWR) in 1876. The Minehead Railway was taken over by the Great Western in 1897, but the West Somerset Railway remained an independent company until 1922 when it too was absorbed by the Great Western. The company was bought by W.H. Reed in 1901 to avoid bankruptcy, at which time it employed 350 people. In 1910 the factory purchased its own Clyde puffer steamboat SS Rushlight, which transported coal from the South Wales Coalfield to power the companies static steam engines, and on the return journey distributed paper products. The port also allowed for importation of additional supplies of wood fibre, plus esparto grass from Spain and rags from France for pulping, as well as international product distribution. A second ship, also a Clyde Puffer named SS Arran Monarch was added in 1953. Staying within the ownership of the Reed family from 1901, from 1974 it was part of the family-controlled public company Reed Smith Holdings. In 1977, employing 500 people, the company and mill were bought by the St Regis Paper Company of New York City. In 1979, the work force of 280 was producing 1,500 tonnes of product a week form mainly recycled pulp, including brown paper for use by the cardboard box industry, plus glazed and wet strength papers for bags, envelopes, wallpapers, and wrappings. DS Smith and closure After St Regis merged with Champion International Paper in 1983, in 1986 DS Smith plc, now the UK's largest producer of paper from recycled materials, acquired the UK and European assets of the St Regis Paper Company for ¬£83million. With an annual capacity of 180,000 tonnes of product and employing 174 people, the mill was the UK's largest manufacturer of coreboard, whilst also producing testliner, recycled envelope, bag and kraft papers. The mill also backed up its sister-plant Kemsley Paper Mill in plasterboard liner production. In August 2015 it was announced that the mill would close by the end of the year. No definitive reason was given as orders still remained on the companies books. The DS Smith group took a ¬£30M write down to its books on closing the mill.http://www.ft.com/fastft/2015/12/03/ds-smith-profits-slip-after-paper- mill-closure/ ReferencesExternal links *Wansbrough Mill at DS Smith *Social history of Watchet Category:1587 establishments in England Category:Pulp and paper mills Category:Companies based in Somerset Category:Buildings and structures in West Somerset Category:Watchet ","title":"Wansbrough Paper Mill"},{"id":"41839387","text":"Hammock Park is a natural area with trails, boardwalks, butterfly garden, disc golf course, picnic area and playground in Dunedin, Florida.

Unlike banks or other classic lending institutions, the funds that community banks lend to borrowers are gathered by the local community itself. This tends to mean that the individuals in a neighborhood or group have more control over who is receiving the capital and how that capital is being spent. This practice has existed in some form for centuries; in ancient Egypt, for example, when grain was often used as currency, local granaries would store and distribute the community‚Äôs food supply. Since that time, a variety of community banking models have evolved. Overview Community banking is a form of empowerment- based economics which falls under the larger umbrella of micro-finance. Micro- finance as a whole is focused on the entrepreneurship of individuals, generally with a goal of lifting low-income or disadvantaged groups out of poverty and providing the means for them to prosper. A very successful example of micro-finance can be seen in the Grameen Bank. Although there are many different models of community banking, the goal is always located in the socio-economic growth of communities through the sharing of resources. While this can include the participation of banks or other traditional money-lending institutions, this is not necessarily the case. The specific framework and practices of the community bank depend largely on its location in the world and the culture that has shaped it. It is thus important to recognize the paramount power of the community in this process to make decisions and control the allocation of funds. Community banking is closely linked to tenets of both social work in general and community organizing in particular, wherein each person is regarded with dignity and seen as a force for change. It is generally initiated and organized by the collective rather than an outside institution (as is the case in more traditional models), and thus reflects the power of individuals in creating social change. However, the sovereignty of the community requires that as professionals enter, they do so from a place of cultural humility. The philosophical foundation of community banking is that the collective knows best, and imposing the views of an outsider onto this system would dismantle the nature of the work. Models by country Community banking looks very different in individual settings or within unique groups. United States In the United States, community banks are a common institution. The US tends to follow a more traditional money-lending model in this way, but still incorporates collective ideals in that the community banks are locally owned. They remain specific to individual neighborhoods, and are thus more able to respond to community needs. India In India, community banking looks very different. Self-Help Groups (SHG) are often instituted in which members of the local community join together and pool capital resources for the purpose of lending to members. Sometimes, the Self-Help Group is backed by a non-profit organization or even a government-backed bank, but this is not always the case. Self-Help Groups are small, with homogeneous membership, and high attendance rates. They value transparency in their practices and utilizing their savings for the purposes of lending. Because the borrowers are members of the SHG, they tend to experience lower interest rates, greater understanding should they have trouble repaying the loan, and greater flexibility overall. This model is closely linked to tenets of both social work in general and community organizing in particular, wherein each person is regarded with dignity and seen as a force for change. Community banking, in this model, is initiated and organized by the collective rather than an outside institution (as is the case in more traditional models), and thus reflects the power of individuals in creating social change. Nigeria Another community banking model in Nigeria is the Credit Development Division. The need for a community banking model arose out of the desire to lessen the gap of credit accessibility in rural areas and to stimulate the economy. Employees in the Division are given the responsibility of planning and implementing credit programs to customers, coordinating alongside community members and other local bodies in order to distribute lines of credit and offering savings opportunities, develop credit tools focusing on security, down-payments, loan repayment periods, and interest and fees. A key component of this approach is that the target customers of the community banks were farmers. Ultimately the goal was to increase productivity and establish a better market for their products. In this model, the bank invests directly into a project without the use of a middle man or negotiator. Tanzania The Tanzanian government in collaboration with SEDIT (Social and Economic Development Initiative of Tanzania) implemented a tool called Village Community Banks, or VICOBA. Development of this model included four key elements: group formation, governance, bank operations, and capacity building. Residents in several pre-selected villages voluntarily joined a group consisting of 30 members and then determined the rules and regulations of how the community bank would function. Once members completed the training sessions they could begin to take out loans predetermined projects. During the first few months members can take out short term loans and once they have developed entrepreneurship skills, they can take out longer term loans of up to six months. Lastly, SEDIT provided technical skills to participants over a period of fourteen to sixteen months. Training focused on the forming and regulating of a VICOBA group, how to create group guidelines and resolve conflicts, regulations on running savings and credit transactions in addition to entrepreneurial skills. Ecuador This information was gathered from the Freedom From Hunger Research Report (Proano, Fleischer, Gash, and Kuklewicz). In 1999, Peace Corps Ecuador piloted the community banking program Programa de Ahorro y Cr√©dito (PAC), which was adapted from a similar program in Niger called Mata Masu Dubara (Women Moving Ahead). A study of the program was conducted in 2010 from the nonprofit Freedom from Hunger, which evaluated two community banking programs in Ecuador. Participants in the banks were surveyed to determine the effectiveness of the local banking approach. Results showed the most common uses for loan funds were related to health care, investments in business and agricultural enterprises, as well as expenses for home improvements and school. The study found that half of community banks stored their money in a cashbox and nearly a third put the funds in a bank account in the name of one group member (See Fig. 1). Criticisms Although community banking aims to empower and encourage economic development within communities, there is criticism that this is not always the case. In Indian models, for example, some argue that the lending process is encouraging households into much greater levels of debt than they can handle. As a result, income insecurity is actually rising and class polarization increases. Similar arguments are being made in Bangladesh, where women are bearing the brunt of the increased micro-financed debt . \\"Empowerment\\" is not as simple as providing monetary resources, as it fails to consider the many facets of life that community banking may have on individual families and cultures (for instance, how will the increase in capital change family dynamics, women's workload, etc.). To be truly effective, many argue that a more transformative model would have to take place in order to have a lasting impact on the daily lives of community members. Issues encountered in the Tanzanian community banks related to culture, infrastructure, and lack of available funds. Women were often unable to participate in the banks due to their husbands prohibiting them from becoming members; this was especially common in rural parts of the country. In some cases participants did not see the advantages of community banks as well as having misconceptions about the program. Some of the communities were located in remote areas that were difficult to reach by facilitators and agencies such as SEDIT. Lastly, inadequate funding limited participation because of the inability to collect sufficient start up funds. The Nigerian model was criticized as being ineffective because bank operators rarely gave out loans. A study of the community banks found that only 23.3% of deposits were given back to the community as loans. Based on the Freedom from Hunger study, several recommendations were made to Peace Corps Ecuador so as to make the community banking model more efficient. Many of these focused on creating a standard of how to start a community bank including providing training to participants on accounting and group facilitation skills. Another recommendation was to develop a training module to be given to youth so as to increase skills in financial responsibility and prioritizing.

Her role as a writer of the Romantic period was overshadowed by her brother Ludwig and her first husband. She was only really appreciated as an important writer when her letters were published in the 1960s. A plot twist in her brother's story Eckbert the Blond is an unattributed invention by Sophie Tieck. Life Tieck was born in Berlin in 1775 to Ludwig and Ann Sophie Tieck. Her father was a rope maker. She was the middle child of three and, unlike her two brothers, she was educated at home by her mother. Her elder brother was Ludwig Tieck, also a notable writer, whilst her younger brother Friedrich was a successful sculptor.Sophie Tieck, FemBio.org, retrieved 4 February 2014 Sophie and Ludwig worked closely together particularly in the period 1795‚Äì96, when they worked on stories for Friedrich Nicholai's Ostrich Feathers. Ludwig submitted sixteen stories but eight (or nine) of these were from the pen of Sophie. It has been said that their relationship was \\"too close\\" and may have been incestuous. They wrote and performed plays, translated Shakespeare and read the works of the Enlightenment. When the Shakespeare translations were published it was Ludwig who took the credit. This was not an oversight, as when Ludwig's daughter Dorothea Tieck also translated Shakespeare's other works her father forgot to credit her too. In 1799 Sophie married a fellow writer and translator, August Ferdinand Bernhardi, who had taught her brother. Bernhardi also published stories and he collaborated with Sophie. He continued Ludwig's habit and did not credit his wife. He published a three-volume work, the last volume of which is thought to have been written almost entirely by Sophie, although she was not acknowledged. The marriage was not happy and she had an affair with the poet and translator August Wilhelm Schlegel. Sophie left with her two children. There was a legal fight over the custody of the children whilst the divorce in 1807 caused a stir. Sophie went travelling with her brother Ludwig to Rome where she met the Baltic German Karl Gregor von Knorring from Reval, Estonia. The three of them went on a grand tour of Munich, Prague and Vienna, before the Sophie and von Knorring set up house together in Munich. Sophie Tieck Tieck married von Knorring in 1810 and converted to Catholicism on account of him, provoking considerable comment.Sophie Bernhardi , Epoch-Napoleon.net, retrieved 4 February 2014 They moved in 1812 to his estate in Erwita and von Knorring supported his wife well. They lived in Heidelberg in 1820 and then in Estonia until she died in 1833 in Reval (Tallinn),Sophie Tieck, utlib.ee, retrieved 4 February 2014 where she was buried in the now-destroyed Kopli Cemetery. Legacy Her novel was not published until 1836, three years after her death. Her son William also published three volumes of his parents' stories in 1847; in these it is clear which parent wrote which story.Ostrich feathers and other stories, retrieved February 2014 Her letters were not available until the 1960s but she is now well regarded as a result. Her works are confused with those of her brother and her first husband.

He is known for the reconstruction of a Mediterranean waterfront chateau on the French Riviera a few miles west of Cannes, known as the Ch√¢teau de la Napoule, which today is operated by a trust and is open to the public. Together with his American wife, Elsie Whelan Goelet Clews, Clews began rebuilding the medieval fortress in 1918; the couple continued the fantasy-themed construction for the rest of their lives. The main building included an artist's studio for Henry and an adjacent seaside castle tower enclosing a lover's tomb where both Henry and Marie are laid to rest in side-by-side stone caskets. Early life Clews was born on April 23, 1876, in New York City to a reputable New York family that was well-connected in Newport society. He was a son of the English-born Henry Clews, a well-known and wealthy Wall Street investment banker, and Lucy Madison (n√©e Worthington) Clews, a relative of U.S. President James Madison, and a direct descendant of American Revolutionary War brigadier general Andrew Lewis.\\"Once upon a Time at LA Napoule: The Memoirs of Marie Clews\\" M. Clews, Publisher: Memoirs Unlimited; 1st edition (April 1998), , His maternal grandfather, William H. Worthington, was a Union Army officer who died during the Civil War. One of Clews' aunts was married into the Vanderbilt family and another into the Astor family. Clews' older sister, Dr. Elsie Clews Parsons (who married U.S. Representative Herbert Parsons), became a renowned anthropologist, author and activist, with three university degrees, including a Masters and a Doctorate from Columbia University. During the same period of time when his one-year older sister was achieving academic success, Clews himself failed at three successive universities by the time he was 20 years old, having been expelled from Amherst College, dropping out of philosophy at Columbia and then thrown out of Leibniz University Hannover in Germany. Career Clews then joined the family financial firm under the tutelage of his father, but that business held no long-term future for his artistic sensibilities. Clews decided to become an artist and studied sculpture under Auguste Rodin. His preferred mediums were oil paint and sculpture with smaller sculptural pieces were often rendered in limestone or porphyry while the larger sculptural pieces were commonly rendered in bronze or marble. His early art in America was not exhibited widely. There are records of at least two exhibitions in New York during 1909, both at the Fifth Avenue gallery of M. Knoedler & Company. The first exhibition was in March for two portraits and the second in November was for ten sculptures. His later art was exhibited primarily in France. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York also has some records of an exhibition from May to August in 1939 after his death. The Louvre museum in Paris records a number of Clews' works in the La Fayette database of American art in France. Clews' best-recognized work is the bronze and marble sculpture entitled \\"God of Humormystics\\", the original of which is on display in the garden at Chateau de la Napoule. The American Art News of 12 February 1916 refers to this sculpture being on display in the galleries of Jacques Seligman & Co. at 750 Fifth Avenue in New York City. There is an unconfirmed report of a copy of the \\"God of Humormystics\\" being on public display somewhere in the State of Virginia, so if the report is true, the copy is likely the same one that was on display in New York in 1916.\\"Chateau de la Napoule\\", December 2013 guided public tour information The sculpture itself was described by a critic and reviewer in 1916 as > A strange artistic production, full of odd imagery.... From a basic column > of colored marble, about whose base disport three bronze amorini, one with > wings and drunk, and another uplifting a wreath, rises an emaciated and > strongly modelled bronze figure of an aged man, crowned with a bird's nest > at whose edge two doves bill and coo. He stands on a base, bearing a woman's > head and hand and a colossal frog. He holds in one hand a rose and in the > other nothing. About the round base circle 18 heads, including those of the > Saviour and the Virgin, and others, crowned and uncrowned, but nearly all > grotesquely ugly. Inspired by the early art of the Chinese the work is a > bitter satire on life, sardonic and rather horrible, if somewhat > fascinating. Another sculpture of a solitary male figure entitled \\"The Thinker\\" has been on public display in the Brookgreen Gardens in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina for nearly 80 years. Brookgreen also holds and displays several other smaller works by Clews, consistent with its mission \\"To collect, conserve and exhibit figurative sculpture by American artists.\\" Clews' art has been referenced by contemporary artists, including John Olsen in photography and Sigmund Abeles in sculpture. Abeles credits the Brookgreen Gardens display of Clews' work as being a seminal influence on choosing art and sculpture as his own life's work. A joint exhibition of both Abeles' and Clews' art entitled \\"Creative Encounters\\" ran from July to October 2012 at the Wentworth-Coolidge Commission in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.  Personal life  Louise Morris Gebhard In 1901, Clews was married to a New York socialite Louise Hollingsworth (n√©e Morris) Gebhard (1877‚Äì1936). Louise, the daughter of John Boucher Morris and Louise Kittera (n√©e Van Dyke) Morris, was recently divorced from Frederick Gebhard. Before Henry and Louise divorced, they were the parents of: * Henry Clews III (1903‚Äì1983) * Louise Hollingsworth Morris Clews (1904‚Äì1970), who first married Hon. Andrew Nicholas Armstrong Vanneck (1890‚Äì1965) in 1930. They divorced in 1933 and she married Ian Campbell, 11th Duke of Argyll in 1935 and became the Duchess of Argyll. They divorced in 1951 and she remarried for the third time to Robert Clermont Livingston Timpson (1908‚Äì1988), an American investment banker, in 1954. Timpson was the grandson of John Henry Livingston of the prominent Livingston family. They moved into Grasmere, a mansion in Rhinebeck, which she later opened to the public. Henry met his second wife, Elsie \\"Marie\\" (n√©e Whelan) Goelet (1880‚Äì1959), at a New York social function and they married in 1914. Clews' second wife had been recently divorced from Robert Wilson Goelet, a wealthy Newport businessman from a prominent family. His sister was Mary Innes-Ker, Duchess of Roxburghe.Gilded: How Newport Became America's Richest Resort; Deborah Davis, page 132, , Shortly after their marriage, the couple moved to Paris. They were the parents of one child: * Mancha Madison Clews (1915‚Äì2006), who became an electrical engineer. After the outbreak of World War I, they moved with their young son to the Ch√¢teau de la Napoule, a medieval chateau along the French Riviera. During their two decades together in residence at the chateau, in addition to the reconstruction and the creation of art, they also hosted elaborate parties for European society and American expatriates. The local villagers were not forgotten by the Clews, who built a fisherman's beach with harbour and arranged for religious services and other events on the chateau grounds for people in the town. When Henry died in 1937 the funeral procession included virtually the entire village.  Posthumous art preservation  Alabaster bust of Marie Elsie Whelen Clews by Henry Clews Jr., 1917. After Henry's death Marie struggled to stay on at the chateau during the Second World War years when Axis forces took over the grounds. Marie lived in the gatehouse and managed to preserve much of Henry's art along with chateau relics by burying them in the expansive gardens. When the Allied forces liberated the village Marie was surprised to see that the troops were led by one of her cousins, an American officer. After the war Henry's art was re-displayed at the chateau and in 1993 the facility became designated as a historic monument administered under the French Ministry of Culture. Today it is one of the leading attractions in the region and the art of Henry Clews Jr. is on continuous public exhibition.  In print  There are few surviving literary references to Clews' life and art. The most notable exception is the memoir of Marie Clews \\"Once Upon a Time at La Napoule\\" which was published post-humously in 1998 with the production efforts of Mancha Madison Clews (1915-2006), the only son of Henry and Marie. Author Lanie Goodman has written two articles about Clews. In the 2007 journal \\"Siennese Shredder\\", Clews is the subject of an article describing his \\"quirky, quixotic kingdom\\" and is characterized as a \\"reclusive misanthropic sculptor\\". In a later travel article for the Wall Street Journal, Goodman writes that \\"...Clews was one of many eccentric expatriates welcomed on the Riviera in the freewheeling 1920s.\\" The French author and academician Andr√© Maurois wrote a contemporary account entitled \\"The Strange World of Henry Clews\\", which is said to have a preface written by painter Jean-Gabriel Domergue, but the volume is rare. A brief volume entitled \\"Henry Clews Jr., Sculptor\\" was published by the University of Michigan in 1953 and digitized in 2006. Clews himself is reported to have authored an unpublished autobiographical manuscript of 1023 pages in the form of a play entitled \\"Dinkelspieliana\\". One of the few items that does exist in print is a note authored by Clews on 15 March 1909 addressed to \\"Dear MacCameron\\", a reprinted copy of which accompanies the exhibition notes to the \\"Two Portraits\\" exhibition at Knoedler & Co. in New York that year. In that note, Clews opines > The artist - the poet - is a constant problem; a perplexity. He can never be > satisfactorily catalogued.... The artist never really finds himself, nor > does he seek to find himself.... In his earliest day dreams he instinctively > knows that he has chosen the steepest, the most solitary and the most > dangerous path; a path which differs from all others in that it is without > resting place, guide, or goal; and that his only compensation can be found > in his pangs and joys of creation. Other men may be judged by their ability, > and success in skillfully penetrating a difficult or an easy close. But the > artist aims at an ever receding goal, and if he be judged at all, it must be > by his poetical effort of approach to the unattainable.\\"  Legacy  The Clews Centre for the Arts operates through the La Napoule Art Foundation, an organisation founded and maintained in part by Clews' descendants. In addition to maintaining the Chateau as a museum, the foundation also offers annual residencies to artists and operates an active program of artistic classes and events. Henry and Marie Clews' \\"artistic and eccentric\\" early 20th-century lifestyle on the French Riviera is hinted at on the inside of the main entrance door to the Chateau where the estate motto is carved into the lintel: \\"Mirth, Myth and Mystery\\". On the outside of the same entrance door, greeting visitors, is the inscription in stone \\"Once Upon a Time‚Ä¶\\".

The mission launched on 17 October 2016 at 23:45:36 UTC. Orbital Sciences and NASA jointly developed a new space transportation system to provide commercial cargo resupply services to the International Space Station (ISS). Under the Commercial Orbital Transportation System (COTS) program, Orbital designed and built Antares, a medium-class launch vehicle; Cygnus, an advanced maneuvering spacecraft; and a Pressurized Cargo Module which is provided by Orbital's industrial partner Thales Alenia Space. The Cygnus spacecraft for this mission is named the S.S. Alan Poindexter in honor to astronaut Alan G. Poindexter, a deceased Space Shuttle commander. Poindexter was selected in the 1998 NASA Group (G17) and went into orbit aboard Space Shuttle missions STS-122 and STS-131.  History  Launch of the OA-5 mission on 17 October 2016. The COTS demonstration mission was successfully conducted in September 2013, and Orbital commenced operational ISS cargo missions under the Commercial Resupply Service (CRS) program with two missions in 2014. Regrettably, the third operational mission, Orb CRS-3, was not successful due to spectacular Antares failure during launch. The company decided to discontinue the Antares 100 series and accelerate the introduction of a new propulsion system. The Antares system is being upgraded with newly built RD-181 first stage engines to provide greater payload performance and increased reliability. In late 2014, Orbital Sciences contracted United Launch Alliance for an Atlas V launch of Orb OA-4 in late 2015 from Cape Canaveral, Florida, and with a second Atlas V launch of Cygnus in 2016. The company plans three Cygnus missions in 2016, in the first (CRS OA-6), third (Cygnus CRS OA-5) and fourth quarters (CRS OA-7) of 2016. The Cygnus OA-5 and OA-7 will fly on the new Antares 230 and OA-6 will fly on second Atlas V in first quarter of 2016. These three missions enable Orbital ATK to fulfill their CRS contracted payload obligation. This particular mission is known as OA-5. Production and integration of Cygnus spacecraft is performed in Dulles, Virginia. The Cygnus service module is mated with the pressurized cargo module at the launch site, and mission operations are conducted from control centers in Dulles, Virginia and Houston, Texas.  Spacecraft  This was the sixth of ten flights by Orbital ATK under the Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) contract with NASA. This was the third flight of the Enhanced sized Cygnus PCM. The mission successfully launched on 17 October 2016, 23:45 UTC. In keeping with an Orbital ATK tradition, this Cygnus spacecraft is named the S.S. Alan Poindexter after the NASA astronaut who flew aboard the Space Shuttle twice (2008 and 2010).  Manifest  Total cargo mass on ascent: * Pressurized cargo with packaging: ** Science investigations: ** Crew supplies: ** Vehicle hardware: ** Spacewalk equipment: ** Computer resources: ** Russian hardware: * Unpressurized cargo (CubeSats): * Total cargo on descent (destructive):  Other OA projects  NASA had planned the next Cygnus flight, OA-7, for 30 December 2016. However, in October 2016, it was announced that OA-7 was being delayed until March 2017 and switched from the Antares launch vehicle to a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket to provide additional cargo up mass for NASA.https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2016/11/oa-7-atlas-v-high-praise-antares- rtf/ In 2015, under the NASA CRS-1 contract, Orbital Sciences was awarded three extension flights for 2017 and 2018. The OA-8E flight has tentatively been scheduled for 12 June 2017, followed by OA-9E later that year and OA-10E in 2018. Cargo vehicle scheduling is dynamic with the ISS partners. The schedule will be influenced by the first USA crewed commercial flights (SpaceX, Boeing) to ISS since Space Shuttle retirement in 2011.  Cubesat release  On 25 November 2016, after leaving the ISS, the spacecraft raised its orbit to 500 kilometers and released four Lemur-2 cubesats for Spire Global.

Together with its related appeals on preliminary and subsequent issues, it has defined the scope of the remedy, as well as what equitable relief may be available. The case came before the Privy Council on no less than six separate occasions. The case has been called \\"the British Virgin Islands equivalent of Jarndyce v Jarndyce\\". Background=Introduction of the appropriation remedy Before 2003, English law provided that, other than the rules relating to self-dealing, there was no rule in equity which precluded a lender from stipulating for any collateral advantage, provided that the stipulation was not: #unfair or unconscionable, #in the nature of a penalty clogging the equity of redemption, or #inconsistent with or repugnant to the right to redeem., citing As a result, for both legal and practical reasons, the use of foreclosure as a remedy has fallen into disuse. Even where a mortgagee seeks an order for foreclosure from the courts, the courts will frequently order judicial sale of the property instead. In 2002, in an effort to standardize the rules relating to financial collateral arrangements and to \\"[provide] for rapid and non-formalistic enforcement procedures in order to safeguard financial stability and limit contagion effects in case of a default of a party to a financial collateral arrangement\\",Directive 2002/47/EC, Recital 17 the European Union adopted Directive 2002/47/EC, which provided for a remedy of appropriation (already available in the civil law).Directive 2002/47/EC, art. 4 It also stated that those countries that did not allow such a remedy (i.e., the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland) on the Directive's adoption were not obliged to recognize it.Directive 2002/47/EC, art. 4(3) All 25 EU member states advised that they would implement the provision, as it was seen as a significant component of the EU's Lisbon Strategy. The Directive called for mandatory application to agreements between parties that were public sector bodies, supervised financial institutions, central counterparties, settlements and clearing houses. Member states were allowed to extend it to persons other than natural persons, provided that the other party to such agreements were one of the mandatory parties already covered.Directive 2002/47/EC, art. 1(2) In its implementating Regulations, the United Kingdom opted to extend this remedy to all companies, provided that the arrangement in question allowed for the use of such remedy.FCAR 2003; s. 3 (definition of \\"non-natural person\\"), ss. 1618 Facts of the case In September 2005, √áukurova Holding AS, a large Turkish company, through its subsidiary Cukurova Finance International Ltd (\\"CFI\\"), borrowed US$1.352 billion from Alfa Telecom Turkey Ltd (\\"ATT\\", part of the Russian Alfa Group). The debt was secured in part by an equitable mortgage, governed by English law, over CFI's 51% interest in a British Virgin Islands company that indirectly held a controlling interest in Turkcell, the leading cellular network in Turkey. The facility agreement for the debt provided for appropriation to be an available remedy in the event of default. In April 2007, ATT advised CFI that, in its view, there had been events of default under the agreement, and it demanded immediate repayment in full of the outstanding amount of the loan. CFI did not repay the full amount by the specified date, and ATT sent a letter to CFi stating that it had appropriated the pledged shares of the BVI company. CFI then gave five days' notice that it wished to pay the remaining amount owing under the agreement, which was accordingly tendered. ATT rejected the tender, CFI placed the funds in an escrow account, and litigation was commenced in the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court. Preliminary issues A Turkcell mobile base station. Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court The defendants raised a preliminary issue as to how a party validly exercised a right of appropriation in law. This preliminary issue would eventually be appealed all the way to the Privy Council, and was the first ever hearing in relation to how one exercised the right. Cukurova alleged that because the companies never updated their share registers to record a change of title to the shares, then no valid appropriation could have taken place. In November 2007, after hearing opposing expert evidence on English law (which, in the BVI courts, is treated as foreign law) from Lord Millett and Professor Ross Cranston the BVI court held that Alfa had not in law validly appropriated the shares.BVIHC (COM) 72 of 2007 The Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeal allowed Alfa's appeal in April 2008, concluding that it had lawfully appropriated the shares.[2008] EWHC 2567, par. 14 Cukurova received permission to appeal the decision to the Privy Council. At the Privy Council (2009) In May 2009, the Board dismissed the appeal and ruled that, as a matter of English law: #Appropriation is much closer to sale than it is to foreclosure. It is in effect a sale by the collateral-taker to himself, at a price determined by an agreed valuation process.[2009] UKPC 19, par. 27 #It is not necessary, for a valid appropriation, for the collateral- taker to become a registered holder of the shares.[2009] UKPC 19, par. 34 #Commercial practicalities require that there should be an overt act evincing the intention to exercise a power of appropriation, communicated to the collateral-provider.[2009] UKPC 19, par. 35 Administrative Court (England and Wales) Separately, Cukurova applied to the English Administrative Court to seek permission to impugn the 2003 Regulations on the grounds that they were ultra vires the authority granted under the European Communities Act 1972, as they extended the Directive's application beyond its contemplated purpose.[2008] EWHC 2567, par. 16 Permission was denied, as the Court held that there was little chance that the application would succeed: It was not possible for Cukurova to separately challenge the validity of the Regulations in the legal proceedings before the BVI courts because of the principle of the conflict of laws that the courts of one jurisdiction will not rule on the validity of laws in another jurisdiction under the act of state doctrine. Main judgment=Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court Following the 2009 ruling, the matter where was returned to the British Virgin Islands commercial court where it came up for hearing before Justice Bannister QC, who held that no event of default had in fact occurred to justify the exercise by ATT of its remedies as secured creditor. That decision was appealed and the Court of Appeal proceeded to consider the main appeal of the original trial judgment, with regard to: :* whether events of default had taken place, and :* whether any dealings had been done in bad faith.HCVAP 2010/018, 2010/024' par. 7 It held that: :* an event of default had taken place, and it was enforced by a valid appropriation of shares,HCVAP 2010/018, 2010/024' par. 17 :* ATT was not guilty of any bad faith relating to the facility agreement.HCVAP 2010/018, 2010/024' par. 19 Cukurova appealed the decision of the Court of Appeal, contending that:[2013] UKPC 2, par. 40 #they were wrong to decide that ATT had established any event of default, but, if they were right, then #ATT's acceleration of the loan and/or its appropriation of the charged shares was vitiated by bad faith or improper purpose, and, if that argument fails, #Cukurova should be accorded relief from forfeiture. At the Privy Council (January 2013) In its main ruling, the Board held: #One event of default was made out,[2013] UKPC 2, par. 62 and it was unnecessary to consider any of the others.[2013] UKPC 2, par. 67 #The trial judge's findings afforded no basis for treating the appropriation of the charged shares as ineffective,[2013] UKPC 2, par. 73 and that was enough to decide this particular issue.[2013] UKPC 2, par. 78 #\\"[R]elief from forfeiture is available in principle where what is in question is forfeiture of proprietary or possessory rights, as opposed to merely contractual rights, regardless of the type of property concerned.\\"[2013] UKPC 2, par. 94 #While \\"the present case involves a combination of unusual features which are most unlikely to be repeated,\\"[2013] UKPC 2, par. 125 nothing in the Regulations precludes the availability of relief against forfeiture. In principle it remains available following the appropriation by ATT of the charged shares.[2013] UKPC 2, par. 115 Before issuing a final order, it called for a further hearing to determine in what conditions such relief may be given.[2013] UKPC 2, par. 126 and Annex Subsequent rulings=Nature in which relief may be given (9 July 2013) The Board ordered that payment amounting to about US$1.565 billion be made by Cukurova to ATT within 60 days of its ruling, consisting of principal, related interest and costs, less dividends earned by ATT during the period of litigation. They divided, however, by 3-2 as to the nature of the principles involved. Lord Mance, joined by Lord Kerr and Lord Clarke, considered the extent to which equity could provide a remedy in this case: He identified nine areas where it could:[2013] UKPC 20, par. 1643 #There is a distinction in practice between a situation where an extension of time to redeem is being sought while a loan remains outstanding and a situation like the present where the loan has been discharged at law by appropriation. #In origin, equity's intervention in aid of mortgagors after forfeiture appears to have been based on general considerations of equitable conscience, rather than the (later) rationalisation that time was not to be treated as of the essence. #There are close similarities between the equitable relief available in respect of mortgages and leases. #The object of the court when granting relief is to put the lessor (as well as the lessee) back in the position in which he would have been if there had been no forfeiture. #The Board cannot accept that equity must ignore such matters, and is trapped within a conceptual framework which requires it to be assumed that the loan has remained continuously outstanding until the date of court ordered relief, whatever and however exceptional the circumstances of and after the appropriation. #The tender is directly relevant to the running of interest. #It is of some interest to look at equity's response to tenders or offers of repayment which are refused or do not, for other reasons involving the lender's fault, lead to actual repayment. In a number of such cases, the court has held, on equitable rather than legal grounds, that the mortgagor was as a result relieved of any obligation to pay interest. #Where there is a contractual right to the costs, the discretion should ordinarily be exercised so as to reflect that contractual right. The power of the court to disallow a mortgagee's costs sought to be added to the mortgage security is a not a statutory power, but from the power of courts of equity to fix the terms on which redemption will be allowed. #The importance of certainty is not confined to common law contexts, but extends to equitable contexts. In summary, he stated: Lord Neuberger and Lord Sumption disagreed with the majority view that \\"the question what the borrower must pay to get relief from forfeiture cannot depend only on the contract.\\"[2013] UKPC 20, par. 178 They held that equity relieves on the ground that: #the forfeiture of the borrower's property for what may be a trivial and rectifiable breach is penal, #the true intention of the parties is that the property should stand as a security only, and #the borrower is in principle entitled to redeem the charge over his property even after the security has been enforced. Accordingly, \\"What equity does not do, in the minority's opinion, is relieve from the other terms of the contract which are not penal. It follows that those terms of the contract determine what the debtor must do if he is to be relieved from the forfeiture.\\"[2013] UKPC 20, par. 179 Variation of order (29 July 2013) As a result of proceedings arising in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Cukurova applied to the Privy Council, in a fourth hearing before the Board, to have the final order varied to provide for: :* an extension of time in order to comply with the requirement to pay the Redemption Sum; :* a determination in relation to the sum identified in paragraph 4 as to whether interest is payable during that period, and if so at what rate; :* other variations of certain terms, so as to avoid any problem arising from the injunctions granted by the New York Court. The Board was not impressed with ATT's contentions that relief should not be given, observing: Accordingly, it ruled that:[2013] UKPC 25, par. 3537 #justice would be best served by time being extended generally without a cut- off date, on terms that both parties have liberty to apply. #the running of interest at the rate of 8% p.a. over Libor should be suspended as from the end of 29 July 2013 (that is, 19 days after the Order in Council) on the ground that CH and CFI are currently being prevented from redeeming within the 60-day period envisaged by the Order in Council due to the positive actions of ATT, or taken by ATT in the name of Sonera and in its own interests. #because the precise nature of any order, if that indication does not come to fruition, is difficult to formulate at this stage, the Board will simply give liberty to apply as to machinery. Extension of time (5 February 2014) ATT later applied for a cut-off date for the payment. In February 2014, the Board decided that the current suspension of the payment deadline should be continued until such time as the New York Court reaches its decision on the case before it. Further hearing (18 June 2014) Further proceedings occurred with respect to a proposed new charge by a new lender to Cukurova. While agreeing that several conditions proposed to Alfa appeared sensible (subject to certain modifications), the Board gave both sides until the end of July to take instructions, and allowed interest to continue to run during that time. Both sides subsequently reached an agreement on the matter, which was approved by the Board in July 2014. The agreement meant that Cukurova would be able to recover its investment in Turkcell. Impact The entire litigation history in this case has been described as being similar to \\"a low-budget horror film\\" that \\"has given the legal world plenty to think about.\\" There was agreement that the case would continue to make new law. There has been doubt as to the Board's suggestion that the facts arising in Cukurova were \\"unusual features,\\" and its intervention may have been motivated by the fact that the facility agreement in question did not give rise to a commercially fair valuation. It remains to be seen whether the courts will take a robust approach in limiting Cukurova to its own facts, as appropriation provisions have become increasingly common in financial documents. In its main judgment, the Board noted that in determining whether a material adverse change had arisen under the relevant clause in the facility agreement, \\"an event need not objectively have such an adverse effect: all that is required is that ATT believes that it has such an effect.\\"[2013] UKPC 2, par. 45 A more restrictive approach has since been adopted by the Commercial Court of England and Wales., noted in Aftermath The complex and turbulent dispute with regard to the control of Turkcell has been supplemented by moves of the Turkish government in August 2013 to appoint directors to its board, which had lacked a quorum since 2010. This is seen as a move to keep Turkcell in Turkish hands, possibly through sale to a local investor. The 2003 Regulations were amended in 2010 to extend the appropriation remedy to credit claims in addition to cash and financial instruments, and it will apply to all forms of security financial collateral arrangements. This effectively means that all charges, and not just mortgages, are covered. However, it is argued that the s. 17(2) framework for the remedy remains conceptually unsound and is unworkable with respect to situations involving chained holding of book-entry securities. In November 2015, the Supreme Court of New Zealand granted leave to appeal a ruling of the New Zealand Court of Appeal, in a case involving possessory interests in resource consents granted under the Resource Management Act 1991, in which it held that relief against forfeiture was available in such circumstances but it declined to exercise its discretion to grant it in that case., discussing In February 2016, it was announced that the appeal was being abandoned, and was therefore deemed to be dismissed.

Intelligent street lighting, also referred to as adaptive street lighting, dims when no activity is detected, but brightens when movement is detected. This type of lighting is different from traditional, stationary illumination, or dimmable street lighting that dims at pre-determined times. Tarn=Europe The first patent requests for intelligent street lighting stem from the late 1990s. But it wasn‚Äôt until April 7, 2006, that Europe experienced the first large scale implementation of a control network in a street lighting application. The implementation took place in Oslo (Norway) and it was expected to reduce energy usage by 50 percent, improve roadway safety, and minimize maintenance costs. The Oslo project triggered interest from other cities in Europe, and formed the basis for other sustainability initiatives, such as the E-Street initiative. This research group focused on ways to reduce energy usage in outdoor lighting systems in the European Union (EU). The E-Street group strongly influenced EU standards and legislation for intelligent outdoor lighting systems. Features Street lights can be made intelligent by placing cameras or other sensors on them, which enables them to detect movement (e.g. Sensity's Light Sensory Network, GE's \\"Currents\\", Tvilight's CitySense).https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53d2cdffe4b069e965155fc8/t/5693fc26dc5cb4e20e40b151/1452538926885/20160111_NetSense- Cities.pdf Additional technology enables the street lights to communicate with one another. Different companies have different variations to this technology. When a passer-by is detected by a camera or sensor, it will communicate this to neighboring street lights, which will brighten so that people are always surrounded by a safe circle of light. The SmartLighting technology of the Anhalt University of Applied Sciences does this as well, and has been installed in Bernburg-Strenzfeld in Germany. Street lights illuminate at a longer distance ahead of the pedestrian than behind the pedestrian in the SmartLighting concept. Control Some companies also offer software with which the street lights can be monitored and managed wirelessly. Clients, or other companies, can access the software from a computer, or even a tablet. From this software, they can gather data, pre-set levels of brightness and dimming time; receive warning signals when a light defects. Guidelines The U.S. Federal Highway Administration has issued guidelines to provide a process by which a governmental agency or a lighting designer can select the required lighting level for a road or street and implement adaptive lighting for a lighting installation or lighting retrofit.Guidelines for the Implementation of Reduced Lighting on Roadways.

Bill Tuition Fairness Act of 2013 () is a bill that would require colleges to charge veterans the in-state tuition rates regardless of whether they meet the residency requirement. The bill also makes several other changes related to veterans benefits, such as extending the time period during which veterans are eligible for job training. The bill passed the House of Representatives on February 4, 2014 during the 113th United States Congress. Background Since World War II, the United States has provided benefits for veterans explained in the G.I. Bill and its subsequent amendments. One of those benefits is college tuition. Education benefits for people who served in the military after 9/11 were expanded in the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008. 1.5 million veterans have used this law to pay for college since then. The bill covers the cost of in-state tuition, but not the cost of out-of-state tuition, forcing veterans to pay the difference or spend a lot of time (up to a year) waiting to meet the residency requirement of that state. Average in-state tuition in the United States is around $9,000, while average out-of-state tuition is close to $22,000. In November 2013, there were 20 U.S. states that already had laws offering veterans in-state tuition regardless of their residency status, and 9 more states considering it. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The GI Bill Tuition Fairness Act of 2013 would direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA), for purposes of the educational assistance programs administered by the Secretary, to disapprove courses of education provided by a public educational institution that does not charge tuition and fees for veterans at the same rate that is charged for in-state residents, regardless of the veteran's state of residence. It would provide for the treatment of veterans enrolled in courses at such institutions before July 1, 2015. Section 4 would extend through FY2018 the authorization of appropriations for: (1) a monthly assistance allowance to disabled veterans training or competing for the Paralympic Team; and (2) grants to U.S. Paralympics, Inc. Section 6 would make eligible under VA homeless veterans reintegration program those homeless veterans who are: (1) participating in the VA supported housing program for which rental assistance is provided under the United States Housing Act of 1937, and (2) veterans who are transitioning from being incarcerated. Section 7 would extend from 12 to 17 years after discharge or release from active-duty service the authorized period for veterans with service-connected disabilities to enroll in certain VA vocational training and rehabilitation programs. Section 8 would reauthorize through June 30, 2018 (under current law, the authorization expires as of June 30, 2013) certain qualifying work-study activities for individuals receiving educational assistance through the VA. Section 9 would set forth the responsibilities of each Director and Assistant Director of Veterans' Employment and Training (assigned to each state by the Secretary from among personnel within the Veterans' Employment and Training Service), including: (1) monitoring the performance of veterans' training and employment programs, with special emphasis on services to disabled veterans; (2) addressing program performance deficiencies and establishing higher performance goals; and (3) reviewing program funding and assisting with funding requests. Section 10 would amend provisions concerning the Transition Assistance Program of the United States Department of Defense (DOD) (employment and job training assistance and related services for members of the Armed Forces being separated from active duty and their spouses) to require such Program to include: (1) information about disability-related employment and education protections, (2) instruction in the use of educational assistance entitlements, (3) testing to determine academic readiness for post-secondary education and appropriate courses, (4) instruction on the financing of post-secondary education, and (5) information on benefits provided under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) and in other subjects determined by the Secretary concerned. It would also require the VA Secretary to submit to the congressional veterans committees the results of a study to determine the feasibility of providing veterans' benefits instruction at all overseas locations where such instruction is provided through a joint contract with the Secretary of Labor. Section 11 would amend the VOW to Hire Heroes Act of 2011 to extend through June 30, 2014, the veterans retraining assistance program. Directs the Secretary to submit to Congress an interim report on the retraining assistance provided under such program. Section 12 would amend the Secretary to increase, as of December 1, 2013, the rates of veterans' disability compensation, additional compensation for dependents, the clothing allowance for certain disabled veterans, and dependency and indemnity compensation for surviving spouses and children. Requires each such increase to be the same percentage as the increase in benefits provided under title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act, on the same effective date. Section 13 would prohibit the Secretary from paying any performance award to a VA Senior Executive Service employee during FY2014-FY2018. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Veterans‚Äô Affairs on May 8, 2013. This is a public domain source. H.R. 357 would: modify the monthly rates payable to veterans, their dependents, and survivors for disability compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation; amend the approval criteria for educational institutions at which veterans may use their education benefits; and make other changes to programs administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Department of Defense (DoD), and the United States Department of Labor (DOL). If enacted, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that, on net, the bill would decrease direct spending by $139 million over the 2014-2018 period and by $347 million over the 2014-2023 period. Because the bill would affect direct spending, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. Enacting H.R. 357 would not affect revenues. In addition, the CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 357 would have a discretionary cost of $132 million over the 2014-2018 period, assuming appropriation of the estimated amounts. H.R. 357 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). Procedural history The GI Bill Tuition Fairness Act of 2013 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on January 23, 2013 by Rep. Jeff Miller (R, FL-1). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Veterans' Affairs. It was reported out of committee alongside House Report 113-94. On February 3, 2014, the House voted in Roll Call Vote 33 to pass the bill 390-0. It was received in the United States Senate and referred to the United States Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs on February 4, 2014. Debate and discussion Rep. Jeff Miller supported the bill, saying that GI education benefits should reflect the fact that \\"the men and women who served this nation did not just defend the citizens of their home states, but the citizens of all 50 states.\\" Supporters of allowing veterans to have in-state tuition argue that such a move will benefit the schools as well as the veterans. The schools would benefit by \\"having the kind of leadership and the kind of character in the classroom that a veteran will bring\\" according to Heather Fitzenhagen, a state representative in Florida working on a state level bill on this issue. The group Student Veterans of America supports the bill, arguing that \\"having that across-the-board ease with all 50 states and the District of Columbia will make it easier for student veterans to figure out how much they will be paying for their college education.\\" The Military Officers Association of America also supports the bill. MOAA President Vice Adm. Norbert R. Ryan Jr., USN (Ret) said that the bill is \\"a practical, cost-saving approach that allows our returning warriors more options to take advantage of the Post-9/11 GI Bill and other GI bill programs.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *G.I.

Following the establishment of the Ostend Company, Austrian ships began to travel to Bengal where they opened factories. The early history of ties between Austria and Bangladesh can be seen when a number of Bangladeshis travelled to the Austria for further educational purposes starting in the 20th century; namely Abdullah Al-Mamun Suhrawardy. Large quantities of jute used to be transported from Bengal to Austria due to the efforts of the Ralli Brothers in the early 1800s. The two countries fought the two World Wars against each other, with Austria (as Austria-Hungary) being one of the dominant Central Powers in World War One and part of Adolf Hitler's national socialist Third Reich in World War Two and Bangladesh being a part of the British Raj, a colony of the United Kingdom, which fought Austria (respectively Germany, which Austria was a part of from 1938 to 1945) on both occasions. Abdul Motaleb Malik, a notable Bengali politician, was the Pakistani ambassador to Austria in the 50s, long before the Independence of Bangladesh in 1971.

He lived in St. Petersburg, Florida until his death in 1969. He founded the Hill School of Art in St. Petersburg in 1946. Early life and career Hill was born in Munising, Michigan in 1898.Mural Studies for the St. Louis Post Office, ca. 1939 Richard Norton Gallery He studied naval engineering and architecture at Lehigh University from 1917 until 1918, before graduating with a bachelor's degree in 1923 from Syracuse University where he met his wife Polly Knipp Hill. They studied in Paris together in the 1920s and were married there. She did etchings.A Legacy Takes Flight by Lennie Bennett, St. Petersburg Times, October 13, 2002. Hill went to Paris on a fellowship at the Acad√©mie Colarossi and the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re, and had a studio in the city. His work was shown at the Salon des Artistes Francaise from 1923 until 1929, and he had a one-man exhibition at Simonson Galleries in Paris in 1924. In 1924, he also exhibited at the Royal Academy in London. Hill returned to the United States in 1929, and worked as a portraitist in New York City before establishing a studio in St. Petersburg, Florida in 1932. His work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics. Hill's works include the mural Long Staple Cotton in the Madison, Florida post office, commissioned by the Treasury Section of Fine Arts, and completed in 1937. He signed his paintings G.S. Hill. Controversial and lost work Hill's style has been compared to that of Thomas Hart Benton, who was New Deal muralist as well as John Stuart Curry and Grant Wood.Milton Fire Hill's figures, like those in the Mannerist style, are elongated. His scenes include action. Some of his work was done for the Works Progress Administration. A commission for work in a Clearwater, Florida courtroom was stopped by Judge John U. Bird in 1934 because he did not want \\"pictures of sunbathers with brassiere-type bathing suits hanging over my bench.\\" Another of his murals was torn down in 1966 by activist Joseph Waller because the mural of white sunbathers and black entertainers on the beach \\"depicts Negroes in a most despicable, derogatory manner.\\" Further objections arose in 1998 over a bare breast in a mural at the Coast Guard station in St. Pete. Hill's painting at the Madison Post Office was also controversial when a postmaster raised concerns over the depiction of all-white supervisors and black workers alongside white workers. Hill produced five murals for the Pinellas County Courthouse in Clearwater, Florida depicting county history. Hung in the Clearwater City Auditorium, they became lost after the building was razed in the 1960s. He did two St. Petersburg scenes of the pier and a picnic for City Hall. African-American community leaders later objected to the depictions of black musicians in Picnicking at Pass-a-Grille. After it was torn down, the painting was lost after the vandal's trial. He also painted a mural in the St. Petersburg Coast Guard building's wardroom depicting the service's history. A 1933 Chicago World's Fair painting moved to the Florida State Capitol was also lost, as well as murals for post offices in Florida and Alabama. Murals at Tampa's Peter O. Knight Airport were damaged when they were removed pending the airport's demolition. His aeronautical paintings included one showing Tony Jannus' famous flight from St. Petersburg to Tampa. Several of the murals have been restored and are on display at the Tampa International Airport.Artist George Snow Hill's murals sometimes created controversy by Luis Perez, Tampa Bay Times, April 27, 2010.

An initiative of Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe, the Council replaces the previous Security Council and is modeled after the United States National Security Council. It is headed by the country's National Security Advisor, currently Shotaro Yachi. History Abe first attempted to establish an NSC in his first premiership in 2006‚Äì07, but the effort stalled in January 2008 when he stepped down from office. The House of Representatives passed a bill to establish the Council on 7 November 2013, and the House of Councillors followed suit on 27 November. The Council has its own national security advisor to the Prime Minister, and is staffed by around 60 officials from the Foreign and Defense ministries. There are six teams handling various issue areas, each headed by an official equivalent to a ministerial division chief. One of its key functions is a regular conference with the Prime Minister, the Chief Cabinet Secretary, and the Foreign and Defense ministers. The office has hotlines to its American and British counterparts. Together with the publication of Japan's first National Security Strategy in December 2013, the NSC represents a centralization of Japanese security policy with the Prime Minister. The old Security Council had been beset by bureaucratic inefficiencies and lack of coordination. The National Security Strategy advocates for the creation of an NSC because \\"the security environment surrounding Japan is further increasing in severity. ... [I]t is necessary for the entire Cabinet to work on the strengthening of foreign affairs and the security system of Japan.\\" The Council met for the first time on 4 December 2013 to discuss the National Security Strategy and China's Air Defense Identification Zone.

With a name based on a local legend, the building located in B√∂ttcherstra√üe in the old town was built by the prosperous coffee merchant Ludwig Roselius to a design by Bremen architects Eduard Scotland and Alfred Runge., Retrieved 4 February 2014, in German. The first version of the house was home to the advertising department of Roselius's coffee company and the Deutscher Werkbund association of craftsmen. When it was rebuilt in 1954 the new design was based on a traditional local story.House of the 7 Lazy Brothers , Boettcherstrasse.de, retrieved 5 February 2014 Background Crafted by Bernhard Hoetger, the Fountain of the Seven Lazy Brothers bordering the 1954 rebuild of the house was based on a legend about the sons of a local farmer who were considered lazy as they could find no work in Bremen. After venturing into the wide world for a few years, they returned to the city. With the benefit of experience, they worked in their father's fields, dug drainage ditches and built a dyke next to the Weser which prevented it from flooding. The citizens finally realized how astute they had been. While the fountain still presents seven lazy figures, the proud, upright statues on the gable above show how hard-working they had been. History and architecture In 1924, Ludwig Roselius acquired a lease for a period of 60 years on the land on B√∂ttcherstra√üe covering No. 15-19 and later also obtained permission to develop the old packhouses at No. 4-5. He persuaded the authorities to let him build a small colony of shops, studios and apartments there, drawing on North German architectural styles. Opposite the Paula Modersohn-Becker House, Runge and Scotland designed the long complex known as the HAG Haus (from the name of Rogelius' company: Handels Aktien Gesellschaft). They included traditional North German features such as stepped gables, dormers and arcades. The only part of the building left after it was damaged in the war is the former Kaffee HAG coffee-tasting room. The remainder of the building was rebuilt based on the original style in 1954. The figures standing on the top of the gable overlooking the Sch√ºtting are the work of Aloys R√∂hr from M√ºnster. The figures of the seven brothers looking proud and far from lazy are said to be a homage to Roselius's ideas. The building today is home to a tea shop, a toy shop and a gift shop.

It was commissioned by the New York City Department of Design & Construction and completed in 2011 under the New York City Design and Construction Excellence program. The center is the Queens Borough Public Library system's largest facility. With a $1.8 million grant from the National Science Foundation, the center recruited specialists from the Exploratorium in San Francisco to design hands-on \\"discovery stations\\". The stations, geared toward children ages 3‚Äì12, introduce them to diverse topics such as weather, music, and nanotechnology. According to Queens Library CEO Thomas Galante, the embedding of museum-like exhibits into a reading space as exemplified by the center is unique among public libraries in the United States. The 22,000-square-foot, two-story building was designed by 1100 Architect, with graphics and wayfinding designed by Lee H. Skolnick Architecture & Design Partnership. The exterior is a conspicuous glass fa√ßade scaled to match the existing mix of low-rises in the neighborhood.  History  The library opened in 2011.https://www.mommynearest.com/article/6-best-childrens-libraries-in-the- united-states The addition of the Children's Library Discovery Center is significant to the community of Jamaica, Queens, as it serves a diverse and marginalized population of New York City. The services provided by the Center are not easily available to Queens residents. The adjacent Queens Central Library building was designed by York & Sawyer in 1966. As the first major branch of an urban library to place all public services on one floor, its design was representative of a new building trend towards functional library design. The new addition to the existing library was proposed under New York's Design and Construction Excellence program‚Äîa federal plan started in the mid-1990s that sought to bring better design to government buildings. The program, led by Department of Design and Construction Commissioner David J. Burney, guarantees market-rate fees to architects with the intent to encourage fresh young talent in the city.  Awards  In 2011, the building received two awards: the Queens Library Foundation, Award for Excellence in Design; and the Queens Chamber of Commerce, Building Award: New Construction/Public Building. In 2012 it won the Municipal Art Society of New York, MASterworks Award: Best Neighborhood Catalyst, and in 2013, the NYLA-PLA Award.

Founded as a forced-labor farm worked by black people enslaved by the land's white owners, Oak View features an early 19th-century kitchen, 1855 farmhouse, livestock barn, cotton gin barn, and tenant house dating to the early 20th century. The Farm History Center located on site provides information to visitors regarding the history of the Oak View and the general history of farming in North Carolina. Aside from the historic buildings, the site also features an orchard, a honey bee hive, a small cotton field, and the largest pecan grove in Wake County.  History  Historic Oak View traces its history to a land purchase by Benton Southworth Donaldson Williams in eastern Wake County in 1829. This land was purchased from Arthur Pool for $135 and included 85 acres with several outbuildings none of which remain today. Williams continued to acquire land and holdings over the next 30 years; eventually including the land that houses Oak View's oldest building, the kitchen. In 1855, Williams completed construction of a two-story Greek Revival I house which would become the centerpiece of Oak View farm for the next century. At its pre-Civil War height in 1860, the Williams family enslaved 10 people and produced 27 bales of Cotton per year.1860 North Carolina Agricultural Census records. Cotton was considered \\"King\\" of the South leading up to the Civil War, and even afterwards many farmers including the Williams greatly increased their cotton production. By the 1880s, 93 percent of Wake County farms, including Oak View, produced cotton with the Williams family growing 82 bales of cotton a year.1880 Agricultural Schedule. Following the Civil War, Williams was selected to be one of the four delegates representing Wake County at the 1868 North Carolina Constitutional Convention. His long-held Unionist views made him few friends in Raleigh during the Civil War, but his close association with Governor Holden ensured his place in deciding North Carolina's future through the Reconstruction. Of the four Wake County delegates' homes, only Oak View has survived. Following Williams' death in 1870, he willed that his land be divided among his children and wife, Burchett. This land remained in Burchett's hands until she died in 1886. The land, house, and outbuildings were sold at auction to Job P. Wyatt whose family operated the farm for nearly sixty years.Burchett Williams Estate Sale, 1886. Many of the current outbuildings at Oak View were built during the Wyatt ownership including the cotton gin house, livestock barn, and the carriage house. While the Wyatt family owned Oak View, they generally hired a manager to oversee the day-to- day operations. Unlike much of the South which used sharecroppers to farm their land, the Wyatts' property manager lived in the main house and oversaw the tenant farmers who grew both the Wyatt's crops and their own for a wage. While the tenant families sometimes stayed for as little as a year, Oak View continued to have tenant farmers living in small houses on the property until the 1980s. Despite the farm's success under the Williams family, the Wyatt family rarely made a profit off the farm, \\"At the close of each year, (they) would pore over the books to determine whether they could continue operation.\\" Instead, the Wyatt family began using Oak View as a testing ground for their seed company that was based in Raleigh, North Carolina. They eventually shifted from predominately growing cotton to growing vegetables and pecans. The pecan orchard that the Wyatt family planted continues to produce a crop every year and is the largest remaining grove in Wake County. Eventually, the Wyatt family traded the struggling Oak View to the Gregory-Poole family for a downtown office to help the Wyatt-Quarles Seed Company. Soon after the trade, James Gregory Poole moved into the farmhouse with his family. The Pooles lived at Oak View for three years and remodeled and updated the property. They built an addition to the house, put running water in the buildings, and electrified the property for the first time. Following their many additions, the Poole family sold the property to James and Mary Bryan in 1944. The Poole additions were the last major changes to the historic buildings and the property passed in and out of several families' hands before being purchased by Wake County in 1984. Originally intending to destroy the buildings to build an office park, several local prominent families and descendants banded together to save the property. In 1991, Historic Oak View was added to the National Register of Historic Places and Oak View was soon turned into a Wake County park.  Current use  Oak View's three Anglo-Nubian goats The Wake County Parks, Recreation and Open Space Division was given management of Oak View in 1995, creating the first historic site in the Wake County park system. With the completion of a Farm History Center in 1997, Oak View began to focus on teaching about North Carolina's agricultural history from colonial times to the present. Recently, a historic tenant house has been moved on site at Oak View Historic Park to begin interpretation into the lives of those who lived and worked on the Oak View land. Today, more than 100,000 visitors come to Oak View each year to learn about North Carolina's agricultural past through programs, events and exhibits.

Lee responded to this backlash in an NBC Bay Area phone interview by stating that \\"people should be ashamed of themselves [‚Ä¶] But I think it's also pretty progressive that those ignorant people are being shamed in the media.\\" In another interview, Lee stated: \\"It‚Äôs sad that so many Americans don‚Äôt know how much they don‚Äôt know.

The episodes were written and storyboarded by Kent Osborne and Somvilay Xayaphone, from a story by Mark Banker, Kent Osborne, Patrick McHale, and series creator Pendleton Ward. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on December 5, 2011. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn and Jake stumble across the Ice King‚Äôs (voiced by Tom Kenny) video diary and look to uncover his secrets. The Ice King tries to get the video diaries back, but Finn and Jake discover, via the tapes, that the Ice King was formerly a human archaeologist named Simon Petrikov who was cursed with his powers after he put his crown on his head. \\"Holly Jolly Secrets\\" was based on an earlier, aborted Christmas special that would have involved Finn and Jake watching actual Christmas movies, and providing commentary in a style similar to Mystery Science Theater 3000. These plans were later scrapped, and series writer Patrick McHale developed the idea to explore the Ice King's backstory. The episode was watched by 2.513 million people and received largely positive critical reviews, with the novelist Lev Grossman applauding the exploration of the Ice King's past history. Plot Finn and Jake dig up a box of treasure that Jake had found in the landfill and had buried without opening. When they open the box, the two discover a plethora of VHS tapes. Finn recognizes them, noting that he saw Ice King bury them in the dump awhile ago. The two make plans for a secret tape watching; Jake puts up flyers warning people that the only ones allowed to attend are Finn, Jake, and BMO. However, the Ice King, seeing one of the posters, decides he wants to watch them too, unaware that the tapes are his. Meanwhile, Finn and Jake start to watch the tapes and discover that they comprise the Ice King's boring and somewhat disturbing video journals. After watching several entries, Finn and Jake think there might be a secret code hidden in the tapes. BMO apparently cracks the code, revealing that all of the tapes contain an encoded picture of Gunter, the Ice King's penguin. The Ice King, unable to get into Finn and Jake's house, raises an army of snowmen and tries to break in by force. Finn and Jake, realizing what is going on, hide under their bed and keep watching the tapes, hoping to discover a secret about the Ice King. Soon, the tapes cut to an ominous recording of a man who introduces himself as Simon Petrikov. Simon, an antiquarian, explains that he bought a magical crown and, after placing it on his head, began to succumb to the crown's power, losing his sanity and his \\"princess\\" Betty. Finn and Jake realize that Simon is the same person as the Ice King, and the two take pity on him. Production Tom Kenny's voice acting in the episode was likened to dramatic narration from a radio drama by series creator Pendleton Ward. \\"Holly Jolly Secrets\\" was written and storyboarded by Kent Osborne and Somvilay Xayaphone from a story developed by Mark Banker, Patrick McHale, Osborne, and series creator Pendleton Ward. It was directed by Larry Leichliter. The genesis for this episode was Cartoon Network's suggestion that the show create a holiday special. Ward wanted \\"to do a Christmas episode without doing Christmas\\", but found that it was too difficult to \\"just dance around\\" the holiday. Originally, Ward's idea for the episode was to do it in the style of Mystery Science Theater 3000, featuring Finn and Jake digging up actual Christmas specials, and having them comment on them. This would have entailed a mixing of live-action and traditional animation, but Ward eventually rejected this idea, because the mixing of live action with the animation would have destroyed the world that the cast and crew had spent three seasons creating. To make up for this last-minute change of plans, the writers had to replace the Christmas programs that Finn and Jake would watch with \\"the Ice King's odd home movies\\". McHale then crafted the story involving Simon Petrikov, a move that Ward heralded as \\"brilliant\\". When it came time for Tom Kenny to record his lines, Ward explained that it \\"felt like such an authentic, old-time radio horror drama\\". Adam Muto storyboarded a video that Finn and Jake fast-forward; because this video contains actual dialogue that can be understood if the viewer slows down the episode, the crew noted that the scene in question required three times the work in order for the fast-forward joke to work. During one of the scenes in which the Ice King is bemoaning his situation via video tape, Osborne placed a faux bumper that read \\"You're watching an Adventure Time Christmas special! Ho ho ho!\\", with the joke being that the cheeriness of the bumper undercut the extreme sadness of the Ice King. Many people on the Internet, however, though that the bumper was real. The episode makes use of \\"The Fry Song\\", written by Rebecca Sugar, that had originally appeared in the second season premiere, \\"It Came from the Nightosphere\\". Kenny had recorded this version of the song after \\"It Came from the Nightosphere\\" aired just for fun, but the crew liked it so much that it eventually made its way into the second part of \\"Holly Jolly Secrets\\". The score for the episode was composed by Tim Kiefer. One particular song, titled \\"Old Cold Footage\\", that Kiefer composed was supposed to accompany the scene featuring the Ice King's video diary. This track, however, was excised from the episode and \\"never [saw] the light of day\\" until Kiefer posted it onto his official website. He later uploaded it onto his official SoundCloud account as well. Reception \\"Holly Jolly Secrets\\" parts one and two first aired on Cartoon Network on December 5, 2011. The episodes were viewed by 2.513 million viewers and scored a 0.5 Nielsen rating in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic. Nielsen ratings are audience measurement systems that determine the audience size and composition of television programming in the United States, which means that the episode was seen by 0.5 percent of all households aged 18 to 49 years old were watching television at the time of the episodes' airing. The episode first saw physical release as part of the complete third season DVD on February 25, 2014. Erik Adams of The A.V. Club noted that Finn and Jake finding the Ice King's home tapes led to a \\"disturbingly intimate holiday special.\\" He later jokingly noted that \\"Penguin Dance Parties [are] what Christmas is all about, Charlie Brown.\\" Novelist Lev Grossman, in an interview with NPR praised the backstory of the Ice King and the exploration of his condition, noting that his origin is \\"psychologically plausible\\". Grossman praised the way the series was able to tackle the issues of mental illness, saying: \\"It's very affecting. My dad has been going through having Alzheimer's, and he's forgotten so much about who he used to be. And I look at him and think this cartoon is about my father dying.\\" Explanatory notesReferencesExternal links  Category:2011 American television episodes Category:Adventure Time (season 3) episodes ","title":"Holly Jolly Secrets"},{"id":"41840568","text":"Kingstone Press Cider is an English cider made from apples from an orchard in Malvern in Worcestershire.

The story focuses upon the tragic love affair of \\"star-crossed\\" lovers Ophelia \\"Cocoa\\" Day and George Andrews. The setting of the novel is split between New York City, where George was born and raised and Ophelia has recently moved, and Willow Springs, a fictional community situated on a coastal island on the border of Georgia and South Carolina where Ophelia's family has lived for several generations. The novel takes place within the same fictional universe as some of Naylor's other novels, indicated through its passing references to events and characters from both Linden Hills and Bailey's Cafe.  Plot  Mama Day centers around the characters George and Cocoa. Cocoa, whose real name is Ophelia, is a young southern woman living in New York who is still deeply connected to her family and ancestry, even though her family's history is fraught with pain and tragedy. George grew up an orphan, overcoming a multitude of challenges in order to finally graduate from Columbia engineering school and co-found his own engineering company. Cocoa and George meet when Cocoa interviews for a job at George's firm. George is unable to hire Cocoa because the job starts immediately and she is obligated to visit Willow Springs every August to spend time with Mama Day and her family. Prior to returning to New York from her trip to Willow Springs, Cocoa writes a letter to George saying that she still wants the job. Mama Day intervenes and puts a mysterious substance on the envelope, which causes George to remember Cocoa and soon later recommend her to someone for another job. George and Cocoa begin to date and marry suddenly, but George doesn't visit Willow Springs with Cocoa for four years, during which time Cocoa never shares with him the more unusual and even supernatural aspects of Willow Springs. After several years they return to Willow Springs together. When George finally does accompany her, being a practical minded engineer with no family history or special convictions to help him relate to the people of Willow Springs, he has a hard time believing in or understanding some of the events that take place. When he discovers that Cocoa is dying because of a hex put on her by the deeply jealous and hateful Ruby, who is a conjure woman and Mama Day's wicked counterpart, George wants to use practical means to save her life. Just as Cocoa begins to fall ill, a hurricane knocks out the bridge that is connected to the \\"outside\\" world, making entering or leaving the island impossible. George and Cocoa are now stuck in Willow Springs, and forced to use the remedies available through Mama Day and the mysticism of the island rather than modern treatment. The only person that can save Cocoa is George, by following the instructions of Mama Day. However, he is unable to surrender to and believe in the mystical forces that Mama Day has described to him. In desperation, he submits to Mama Day's directions because Cocoa is near death, and he is desperate for something to help her. In performing the ritual needed, he dies and ultimately saves Cocoa's life.  Characters  Sapphira Wade ‚Äì Mama Day's great-grandmother, who is known on the Island as the mystical \\"great, great, grand mother.\\" The legend of her life is murky, but she is known to have been a slave woman who married Bascombe Wade, bore seven sons, and by some mysterious means gained the deed to the island of Willow Springs from her husband before he died in 1823, from which point the island became a community of free African Americans during the pre-Civil War era. Miranda (Mama) Day ‚Äì Mama Day is a witty old lady and the matriarch of Willow Springs. Mama Day is Cocoa's great-aunt and the sister of Abigail. She is a woman who believes in heritage, family, and a deep understanding of the power of nature. Mama Day is often meddling in Cocoa's life and truly wants to see her happy. Mama Day uses magic, nature, wit, and wisdom to help the people of Willow Springs. Abigail Day ‚Äì Cocoa's grandmother and Mama Day's sister. She is respectful, even-tempered and the peace maker of the family. Abigail Day is a doting grandmother who spoils Cocoa. Ophelia (Cocoa) Day ‚Äì The last living Day of her generation. She is headstrong and stubborn. When the novel opens she has been living in New York City since leaving Willow Springs to go to school seven years earlier, but she goes back to visit for two weeks every August. It is in New York that she meets George Andrews. George Andrews ‚Äì Cocoa's husband. George is an orphan who grew up in a shelter and knows nothing about his family or ancestry. Hardened by life he takes everything one day at a time, and carefully calculates all of his decisions and actions. He doesn't rely on anyone but himself to do things for him. He works at an engineering firm, and is fanatical about football because he's drawn to its detailed strategies. He also has a heart condition that he must monitor closely, which contributes to his need to regulate every aspect of his life. Dr. Buzzard ‚Äì The charlatan of Willow Springs. He brews moonshine and creates other \\"remedies\\" for various problems and ailments which he sells to the people of Willow Springs. Dr. Buzzard thinks that he and Mama Day are rivals, but Mama Day does not believe that they hold similar powers, or even that his powers are real. Ruby ‚Äì Ruby is a family friend who is overweight, insecure, jealous and practices voodoo. She uses her powers to manipulate Junior Lee into marrying her. Junior Lee ‚Äì Married to Ruby. Likes to drink and party, a shiftless individual.  Style and structure  Mama Day is a novel whose subgenres include legend, folklore, mystery, and fantasy. It contains a multitude of narrative voices that include the following: 1st person plural narration ‚Äì The communal voice of the people from Willow Springs is an example of this style. It is also the first one introduced to readers. This voice is best described as an omniscient voice that has been around to see everything. The introduction and sections throughout the book are written in this voice as the different stories of Bascombe Wade, Sapphira Wade, and what exactly \\"18 and 23\\" is. An example of this communal voice is in this sentence from the introduction that states, \\"And he coulda listened to them the way you been listening to us right now.\\" Rita Mae Brown states that \\"The different voices are beautifully realized but confusing to read.\\" As well as the communal voice, Mama Day offers both a first-person narration and occasionally a free indirect discourse that gives readers direct access to Mama Day's thoughts. Mama Day's section is preceded by three diamonds. In her narration she often speaks about what is taking place at present or events from her past. 1st person narration ‚Äì Cocoa's and George's first person narration, which is displayed as a conversation to one another about events that have occurred, is the other narrative voice. It switches between the two characters without any evidence other than a brief space between the two sections. It is read as if the readers are overhearing the conversation. Because of these different narrative viewpoints the novel is filled with dramatic irony. Readers see this with the reoccurring imagery and symbolism of the \\"chicken\\", and \\"chicken coup\\". Because of what Rita Mae Brown feels is a lack of \\"self-restraint\\" in Mama Day, keeping up with the plot of the novel and who is speaking, the reader is suggested to \\"press on doggedly‚Ä¶.[So they can realize] that a plot is developing through these fragmented viewpoints.\\" Mama Day includes allusions to classical Shakespeare plays such as King Lear which is referred to many times by both Cocoa and George; Hamlet, which houses a female character by the name of Ophelia; and The Tempest, which includes a female character with the same name as Mama Day ‚Äì Miranda. Like Miranda from the Shakespeare play, Mama Day also deals with magic or supernatural powers and is set on a secluded island. Bharati Mukherjee states that the storyline in Mama Day, like Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet, \\"concerns star-crossed lovers.\\"  Reception  Upon its publication, the novel received generally favorable reviews from a number of writers and critics. Rita Mae Brown's review for the Los Angeles Times found the multiple voices in the novel to be \\"beautifully realized\\" and suggested that readers willing to work through the confusions brought about by its fragmented narrative style would ultimately be rewarded by the book's \\"dazzling sense of humor, rich comic observation and that indefinable quality we call 'heart.'\\" Bharati Mukherjee, writing for The New York Times, registered disappointment with the love story between George and Cocoa, which she suggested fell short of Naylor's grand Shakespearean ambitions, but nevertheless commended the work as \\"a big, strong, dense, admirable novel.\\" Rosellen Brown's review for Ms. was lukewarm, describing the plot as \\"alternately affecting and silly, though never less than interesting\\" and taking issue with Naylor's \\"need to elevate by making symbolic, or by fitting everything into a larger scheme\\" as well as the author's attempts at \\"didactically fostering our spiritual instruction.\\" Linda Simon of Women's Review of Books commended the originality of Naylor's characters and the book's \\"amplitude and wit\\", but her review mainly focused on chiding Naylor for evading important questions about race and gender the novel implicitly raises.

He survived on a diet of raw fish, turtles, small birds, sharks and rainwater. He swam to shore at Tile Islet, a small island that is part of Ebon Atoll, on January 30. Two locals, Emi Libokmeto and Russel Laikidrik, found him naked, clutching a knife and shouting in Spanish. He was treated in a hospital in Majuro before flying to his family home in El Salvador on February 10. Alvarenga's story was heavily reported worldwide despite initial criticism from skeptics. He is the first person in recorded history to have survived in a small boat lost at sea for more than a year. Early and personal life Alvarenga was born in Garita Palmera, Ahuachap√°n, El Salvador, to Jos√© Ricardo Orellana and Mar√≠a Julia Alvarenga. Orellana owns a flour mill and store in the town. Alvarenga has a daughter who grew up in Garita Palmera with his parents, and several brothers who live in the United States. He left El Salvador in 2002 for Mexico, where he worked as a fisherman for four years, employed for a time by Villermino Rodr√≠guez.Nick Perry, Associated Press, \\"Jose Salvador Alvarenga Says He Survived on Fish, Turtles, birds and drinking his own urine\\". At the time of his rescue, he had not been in touch with his family in eight years. Voyage Alvarenga set out from the fishing village of Costa Azul, near Pijijiapan, off the coast of Chiapas, Mexico on 17 November 2012, accompanied by a 23-year-old co-worker whom he knew only as \\"Ezequiel\\". Alvarenga, an experienced sailor and fisherman, was intent on a 30-hour shift of deep-sea fishing during which he hoped to catch sharks, marlins, and sailfish, but his usual fishing mate was unable to join him. He arranged instead to bring along the inexperienced, Ezequiel C√≥rdoba, with whom he had never worked or even spoken. Shortly after embarking, their boat, a seven-meter (23-foot) topless fiberglass skiff equipped with a single outboard motor and a refrigerator-sized icebox for storing fish, was blown off course by a storm that lasted five days, during which the motor and most of the portable electronics were damaged. Though they had caught nearly of fresh fish, the pair were forced to dump it overboard to make the boat maneuverable in the bad weather. Alvarenga managed to call his boss on a two-way radio and ask for help before the radio's battery died. Having neither sails nor oars, no anchor, no running lights, and no other way to contact shore, the boat began to drift across the open ocean. Much of the fishing gear was also lost or damaged in the storm, leaving Alvarenga and C√≥rdoba with only a handful of basic supplies and little food. The search party organized by Alvarenga's boss failed to find any trace of the missing men and gave up after two days because visibility was poor. As days became weeks, Alvarenga and C√≥rdoba learned to scavenge their food from whatever sources presented themselves. Alvarenga managed to catch fish, turtles, jellyfish, and seabirds with his bare hands, and the pair occasionally salvaged bits of food and plastic refuse floating in the water. They collected drinking water from rainfall when possible, but more frequently were forced to drink turtle blood or their own urine. According to Alvarenga, C√≥rdoba lost all hope around four months into the voyage after becoming sick from the raw food and eventually died by refusing to eat. Alvarenga has said that he contemplated suicide for four days after C√≥rdoba died, but that it was his strong religious faith that ultimately prevented him from doing so. Alvarenga claims that C√≥rdoba made him promise not to eat his corpse when he died, so Alvarenga kept C√≥rdoba's corpse on the boat, and even spoke to it. After six days, Alvarenga realized his own insanity and threw the corpse overboard. Alvarenga also stated that, while at sea, he frequently dreamed about his favorite foods, as well as his parents. Alvarenga claimed to have seen numerous transoceanic container ships while drifting alone but was unable to solicit help. He kept track of time by counting the phases of the moon. After counting his 15th lunar cycle, he spotted land: a tiny, desolate islet, which turned out to be a remote corner of the Marshall Islands. On 30 January 2014, he abandoned his boat and swam to shore, where he stumbled upon a beach house owned by a local couple. Alvarenga's journey had lasted 438 days. The length of his voyage has been variously calculated as , the lower figure of which is about the length of a direct path between Mexico and the Marshall Islands. Though some newspapers originally claimed that Alvarenga had been at sea for 16 months, he never said so himself. The newspapers eventually corrected their error and shortened his voyage to 13 months. According to Gee Bing, Marshall Islands' acting secretary of foreign affairs, Alvarenga's vital signs were all \\"good\\", with the exception of blood pressure, which was unusually low. Bing also said that Alvarenga had swollen ankles and struggled with walking. On 6 February the doctor treating him reported that his health had \\"gone downhill\\" since the day before and that he was on an IV drip to treat his dehydration. ReactionsFamily= Alvarenga's parents, who had not been in contact with him for years, had feared he was dead long before he went missing, and were overjoyed to discover he was still alive. Alvarenga's father said that he had prayed for his son while he was missing. Alvarenga's daughter, upon hearing that her father had been found, said that after he returned home, the \\"first thing I'll do is hug him and kiss him.\\" =Initial doubts and support= The implausibility of someone surviving so long at sea on a small craft led a number of commentators to doubt Alvarenga's story, though investigators were able to confirm some of the basic details. The owner of the boat Alvarenga used, C√©sar Castillo, said that \\"it's incredible to survive that long. It's hard to think how anybody could go more than six or seven months without getting scurvy at least.\\" However, in an interview, Claude Piantadosi of Duke University said that fresh meat from birds and turtles contains vitamin C and that eating a lot of it, as Alvarenga claims to have done, \\"would provide sufficient vitamin C to prevent scurvy.\\" The Guardian found the Chiapas rescue services official, Jaime Marroqu√≠n, who was informed that a fishing boat had gone missing in the area on November 17, 2012. The official report identified the two fishermen as Cirilo Vargas and Ezequiel C√≥rdova, and stated that both were in their 30s. Marroqu√≠n also indicated that according to the boat's owner, Vargas was born in El Salvador. The local authorities originally searched for Vargas and C√≥rdova, but called off the search after two days, citing heavy fog and bad weather. In regard to the discrepancy between the names of the fishermen in the 2012 report and those of Alvarenga and Ezequiel, CBS News reported that \\"records in Mexico are often filed with such mistakes\\". Another explanation was provided by Alvarenga's parents, as reported by National Post, when they confirmed that in Mexico their son is known as Cirilo. Tom Armbruster, the United States ambassador to the Marshall Islands, acknowledged that it seems implausible for someone to survive at sea for 13 months, but that \\"it's also hard to imagine how someone might arrive on Ebon out of the blue. Certainly this guy has had an ordeal, and has been at sea for some time.\\" The Guardian's Jo Tuckman argued that the fact that a fishing boat had been reported missing on November 17, 2012 \\"lin[es] up\\" with Alvarenga's claim that he went to sea the following month and that this supports the view that \\"at least some of his story holds up\\". In addition, Erik van Sebille, an oceanographer at the University of New South Wales, said that it was entirely possible that sea currents could carry a boat from Mexico to the Marshall Islands. He also estimated that such a trip would take about 18 months, but said that 13 months was still plausible. Further support for Alvarenga's tale came from a study by researchers from the University of Hawaii that modeled the path a boat might have taken after departing from the Pacific Coast in Mexico based on wind and current conditions and concluded that it would end up \\"within 120 miles of Ebon\\", where Alvarenga actually landed. In April 2014, Alvarenga's lawyer told a press conference that Alvarenga had passed a polygraph test while being asked about his voyage. Life after rescue After 11 days in a hospital, Alvarenga was deemed healthy enough to return to El Salvador. However, he was diagnosed with anemia, had trouble sleeping and developed a fear of water. In 2015, he gave a series of interviews about his ordeal to the journalist Jonathan Franklin, who published his story as the book 438 Days: An Extraordinary True Story of Survival at Sea. Shortly after the release of Alvarenga's book, the family of Ezequiel C√≥rdoba sued Alvarenga for $1,000,000, accusing him of cannibalizing their relative in order to survive. Alvarenga's lawyer has denied this accusation.

From then on, Broughton served as a residence for Jesuit priests to administer to the local Catholic population. Construction In 1836, seven years after Catholic emancipation the foundation stone for the church was laid by Charles Tempest. A dispute arose between the new parish priest Fr Michael Trappes and Charles Tempest on whether the church would be a parish church, which would be under the priest's supervision, or a family chapel, owned by the Tempests. It meant that the church was not opened five years after it was completed. Finally, the Vicar Apostolic of the Northern District, John Briggs solved the dispute by permitting the Tempests to nominate a priest and pay for the running costs of the church.Re-building Catholic life in Skipton in St Stephen's Parish retrieved 4 February 2014 The church was opened on 15 September 1842 and the Mass was presided over by Thomas Tempest, Charles' brother, who became a priest in 1826.

By 29 September 1853, the extension was completed with a new reredos by Augustus Pugin was added along with transepts to accommodate a new side chapel. A presbytery was also built so that the parish could have a resident priest and a Fr George Bridges SJ arrived into the parish.

Originally introduced in Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, she received a dramatic redesign in World of Warcraft: Legion to her current appearance, much more in line with her in- universe lore depictions. Once a high elf ranger-general of Silvermoon, Sylvanas was murdered by Arthas Menethil when she led a doomed resistance against his invasion. In one climactic battle, that left the capital city of Silvermoon in ruins, he managed to finally beat the elven general, ripping her soul out and transforming her into a banshee. This newest agent of the Lich King was empowered by hatred of the living and an everlasting desire to rule over her new brethren. In The Frozen Throne, Sylvanas was able to regain her free will and body and founded the Forsaken faction of undead while styling herself as the \\"Banshee Queen\\" and \\"Dark Lady\\". With her new undead forces vowing to take revenge on the Lich King, they set out to wage war against the Scourge. Sylvanas has become one of the most iconic and noted characters in Warcraft lore, and has received generally positive critical reception from players and journalists alike. She is often praised for being a capable military leader and at the same time a sympathetic figure in the game's narrative arcs. The character has been voiced by Patty Mattson since World of Warcraft patch 3.2 but prior to that she was voiced by Piera Coppola. Prior to her Forsaken joining the Horde, her brethren and much of the world began to refer to her as the \\"Dark Lady\\" in recognition of the fearsome entity she was becoming. And as of Patch 7.0.3 in the online game, she is also the incumbent Warchief of the Horde, standing as one of the most powerful political leaders in all of Azeroth following the death of Vol'jin. Sylvanas has consistently ranked as one of the most popular characters in the game, and is easily listed among the most recognizable figures (alongside Sarah Kerrigan from StarCraft and Tyrael from Diablo, as well as Tracer from Overwatch) from Blizzard Entertainment's published titles. Her storyline and character development have also been regarded as one of the best examples of archers in fiction with excellent backgrounds.  Development  Sylvanas' character model in World of Warcraft was originally a light-skinned Night Elf. This was changed as the character was to feature in a major role in World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King. Blizzard felt the need to revamp her character model, as \\"players [were] worried that they would have to look at the old night elf model through all her lore moments in Wrath [of the Lich King].\\" An initial redesign featuring a more accurate blood or high elf model was released to the Wrath of the Lich King beta in August 2008, before her final \\"fantastic model\\" was introduced a month later. In an interview with World of Warcraft developer Ion Hazzikostas, Sylvanas was referred to as a \\"very cool character\\" who isn't \\"out of the picture by any means.\\" Christie Golden, writer of the Warcraft novel War Crimes, remembers that \\"I was thrilled when they OK'd [the Sylvanas subplot in the novel], I was like \\"This is going to be a blast, this is just going to be all kinds of fun to write.\\" She also said that \\"I like her, I love Sylvanas, I think she is wonderfully ... she's like chocolate, dark and bittersweet.\\" In an interview with World of Warcraft Trading Card Game developer Cryptozoic, Head Creative Designer Drew Walker stated that \\"MMO fans are immediately drawn to iconic figures like Tirion Fordring, Jaina Proudmoore, and Sylvanas Windrunner\\", which contributes to the popularity of the game. In August 2015, Blizzard updated the website for World of Warcraft: Legion with a profile of Sylvanas featuring another redesign. The new model utilized updated textures, and most notably included a redesign to her armor which covered her midriff. A later cinematic featured the new Sylvanas. This cinematic marked her first appearance in a pre-rendered scene, an opportunity which allowed the team to \\"go back to [their] direction and really talk\\" about the character. The team focused on representing the features associated with her undead high elf appearance, highlighting her \\"slightly wide set of eyes, high cheekbones, and a very pointy chin,\\" as well as adding \\"a little bit of chisel on her face.\\" In addition, they also used the opportunity to redesign her classic armor in order to create \\"a more fitting attire\\" for the undead ranger, nicknaming it her \\"battle armor.\\" Sylvanas' updated look sparked conversation online, with many fans debating the choice to cover her midriff, and discussing the portrayal of female characters in modern video games.  Appearances = Warcraft  Sylvanas Windrunner is the founder and leader of the Forsaken faction. Originally a high elf of Quel'thalas, at a young age Sylvanas displayed exceptional skills at being a ranger, advancing in the ranks until eventually earning the position of Ranger-General. When the Scourge invaded Quel'thalas during the events of Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, Sylvanas valiantly defended her homeland, delaying the Scourge while the high elves attempted to create a defense. The Scourge however eventually overwhelmed her forces, and Prince Arthas Menethil (now a death knight) killed Sylvanas himself and raised her as an incorporeal banshee in his service as punishment for hindering his invasion. Prince Arthas' master, the Lich King, gradually lost control over the undead, a result of an attack by Illidan Stormrage and his forces on the Lich King's fortress, the Frozen Throne in Northrend. Thanks to this loss of control, Sylvanas regained her free will and physical body before launching an attack on Prince Arthas. Arthas fled to Northrend, but Sylvanas chose not to pursue him just yet, instead recruiting the majority of free-willed undead under her service and renaming themselves the 'Forsaken'. She led the Forsaken to consolidate their hold over the ruins of Lordaeron by defeating the dread lords of the Burning Legion and eventually betraying the Alliance remnants within the region (whom she manipulated to help her destroy her enemies). Under their new queen's guidance, the Forsaken established the Undercity beneath the ruins of Lordaeron's capital. While some Forsaken feared Sylvanas, others valued the security she provided. Many of the free-willed undead, however, found a purpose to their cursed existence through the banshee queen's burning desire to destroy the Lich King. Sylvanas and the Forsaken hold a tense relationship with the Horde. After fighting for their right to join the Horde, Sylvanas led her \\"people\\" to the continent of Northrend to destroy the Lich King. Before they could succeed, an uprising among the Forsaken killed members of the Horde and Alliance, casting a shadow of mistrust over Sylvanas. She came to dwell on the Forsaken's dim prospects for the future; they were despised and unable to procreate. Ultimately, the Banshee Queen made a pact with the Val'kyr, nightmarish creatures capable of creating more undead, to give the Forsaken a chance to persist on Azeroth. Although having a respect and loyalty for the founding Warchief Thrall, Sylvanas despised his successor, Garrosh Hellscream‚Äîopenly supporting and obeying Hellscream in his presence, yet plotting and scheming behind his back. Her brethren ultimately joined the Horde's rebellion against Garrosh, helping to bring an end to his tyrannical rule. After Warchief Vol'jin was mortally wounded in the invasion of the Broken Isles, Vol'jin himself named Sylvanas Windrunner as his successor as Warchief of the Horde. Sylvanas then spearheaded the Hordes assault on The Broken Isles where she traveled to Stormheim in search of an artifact that would bind the remaining Val'kyr there to her will, thus allowing her once again to create more Forsaken. However, this plan was foiled when Genn Greymane attacked her and destroyed the artifact, creating more tension between the two factions.  Heroes of the Storm  Sylvanas Windrunner appears as a playable character in the crossover video game Heroes of the Storm, having been introduced in a March 2015 patch during the game's closed beta. She is a ranged assassin, which trait \\"black arrows\\" can enable basic attacks and abilities to stun minions, mercenaries and towers alike. Her basic abilities include a powerful volley of arrows with charges refreshed by kills, a dagger strike that does damage over time and spreads to nearby enemies, and a cone-based area-of-effect damage spell, called \\"haunting wave\\", that also allows her to teleport. Furthermore, both her heroic abilities provide her team with sufficient crowd control either through \\"Mind Control\\", or an AoE silence by shooting the \\"Wailing Arrow\\". Talent upgrades can cause minions that die under the effects of her trait to explode, as well as to force an enemy minion to fight for Sylvanas' team using \\"possession\\" talent, or to enable Sylvanas to teleport multiple times during the short period of time using \\"windrunner\\" talent. In Heroes of the Storm, Sylvanas primarily functions as a fast-paced marksman from behind the front lines but can also initiate tactical maneuvers to \\"gank\\" the enemy or make an easy getaway, and generally focuses on pushing lanes and dominating team fights with quick thinking. Furthermore, successful execution of her skills not only provide your team with a huge killing score but make it very difficult to counter her deceptive split pushing capabilities.  Other appearances  Like several Warcraft characters, Sylvanas features as a collectible card in the Warcraft spin-off game Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, where she is regularly ranked as one of the most powerful cards in the game, with Engadget's Matt Low writing that \\"Sylvanas Windrunner is a legendary rarity card [...] her bang for the mana buck is pretty darned good.\\" She also appears in the World of Warcraft Trading Card Game, also as a collectible card.  Reception  The character has received mostly positive reception. Sylvanas was listed #2 on 2p.com's list of the \\"5 most influential female characters in World of Warcraft\\", where she was summed up as \\"one of the most tragic and legendary heroes in World of Warcraft. However, she never gave up to destiny. Sylvanas strived to get out of predicaments and became a leader of the Forsaken. She was tough, firm, valiant, and brave enough to face her own destiny.\\" IGN editor Dana praised the story around Sylvanas, stating \\"I'm not ashamed to admit that I choked up more than once in the quest chain centered around Lady Sylvanas\\", referring to her appearance in World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. Engadget writer Zach Yonzon wrote that Sylvanas \\"look[ed] every bit as awesome as faction leaders should be.\\" The character's new updated look was praised as being \\"more regal, more intimidating, and just more badass\\" as well, with plenty of admirers. Kotaku referred to her as a \\"crazy new character\\" and \\"rad hero\\" for her appearance in Heroes of the Storm; she was also later reviewed as \\"an absolute blast to play\\", with Kotaku's Mike Fahey writing \\"I love her, at least for now.\\" She has also been referred to as \\"not your regular Heroes of the Storm character\\" by Nicole Arce of Tech Times. Sylvanas was also listed #2 on Matthew Rossi of Engadget's \\"Top 10 magnificent bastards of Warcraft\\", as \\"Sylvanas Windrunner has clawed her way to the number two slot by basically becoming ever more ruthless and viciously pragmatic in every appearance. She's cultivated a personality that has in turn formed its own cult among her Forsaken followers.\\" He also wrote that \\"Sylvanas is an interesting character because despite her often abominable actions, her actions make sense when related to her backstory. She's not an unknowable menace, and while you may not support what she does, you have to admit that it's hard to imagine not being as she is when she's experienced what she has.\\" Actress Michele Morrow stated her desire to play as Sylvanas in the Warcraft film, stating \\"To be honest, I‚Äôd be happy to play any of the characters in the movie. But, Sylvanas‚Ä¶ I love her because she's determined. She's insidious. She's arrogant and spiteful, but you can‚Äôt really blame her. She's very tortured. I love this imagination of her. She truly takes her own council\\"; with an associated Facebook page receiving over 5,000 likes. However, Anne Stickney of Engadget reviewed Sylvanas more negatively, claiming \\"Sylvanas Windrunner? Technically dead. Obsessed with procreation. Sylvanas actually stands on her own two feet, but her story is leaning more and more away from a competent leader and more toward someone who may just be a little cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs, if you know what I mean.\\" Sylvanas has also often been featured in other Warcraft-related merchandise. \\"The most powerful dead female in Azeroth\\" is featured on a custom Warcraft Monopoly $50 note, along with other notable Warcraft characters. A Sylvanas figurine was featured at Comic-Con 2013, with Kotaku's Mike Fahey joking that \\"Mini Sylvanas is the most adorable queen of the undead ever. I love her. More than you.\\" Other Sylvanas figurines can be found too. Sylvanas is also a popular character for cosplay.

Starting in 1696, it was occupied by the Mississauga. Ganneious was settled temporarily as part of a mid 17th-century northward push by the Iroquois confederacy, from their traditional homeland in New York state. The village was one of seven northern bases for the Iroquois from which to hunt beaver and other fur-bearers and to control the flow of furs from the north and west to the markets at Albany. The village was located on or near the fertile and productive soils of the Hay Bay area, near Fredericksburg and Cataraqui. The exact location of the village has not been determined. In 1673, the French built Fort Frontenac, which is located in modern day Kingston, Ontario and approximately 40 kilometres east of Ganneious. The establishment of the fort had a significant impact on Ganneious; French missionaries made several attempts to encourage the population in Ganneious to resettle closer to the Fort, in order to Christianize, Europeanize and encourage them to learn trades and farm. In 1675, Ren√©-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle and Father Louis Hennepin undertook a journey to Ganneious to convince the Oneida settled there to relocate closer to Fort Frontenac. One of Hennepin's accounts suggests that he was successful and able to convince some people from Ganneious to move and settle around the fort: In June 1687, under pressure from King Louis XIV to capture 'prisoners of war for his galleys' the inhabitants of Ganneious were rounded up and held as captives by Jacques Rene de Brisay de Donneville. Donneville departed Montreal in June 1687 with 2,700 men. The troops took 200 prisoners from Kente and Ganneious and destroyed both villages. After 1687, all seven Iroquois Villages on the northern shore of Lake Ontario were abandoned. Starting in 1696, the village was the location of a Mississauga settlement, but was not occupied by 1721.  Iroquois villages on the north shore of Lake Ontario  By the late 1660s various groups of Iroquois had established seven villages along the shores of Lake Ontario where trails led off into the interior. In addition to Ganneious, the following settlements have been identified by Historian Percy James Robinson * Kente - on the Bay of Quinte * Kentsio - on Rice Lake * Ganaraske - on the site of present day Port Hope * Ganatsekwyagon - at the mouth of the Rouge River * Teiaiagon - at the mouth of the Humber River * Quinaouatoua (or Tinawatawa) - Near modern day Hamilton  Fiction  Author Gerald Richardson Brown has written a work of historical fiction, Road to Ganneious, which is set in Hay Bay during the 17th and 18th century.

On July 8, 2013, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) filed a petition for a writ of mandamus and prohibition, or a writ of certiorari, to vacate an order of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) in which the court compelled Verizon to produce telephony metadata records from all of its subscribers' calls and deliver those records to the NSA. On November 18, 2013, the Supreme Court denied EPIC's petition. Background The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) is a United States federal law which prescribes procedures for the physical and electronic surveillance and collection of \\"foreign intelligence information\\" between \\"foreign powers\\" and \\"agents of foreign powers\\" (which may include American citizens and permanent residents suspected of espionage or terrorism).Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act The Act created the FISC to oversee the FISA requests. The FISC is a secret court populated with judges appointed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. The secret nature of the court means that all proceedings are behind closed doors and all decisions are classified. Concerns about the government's surveillance efforts and its use of the Patriot Act were present for years before the case. Two members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Senator Mark Udall (D-CO), had been warning the public about this issue, although they were unable to go into detail because of the confidential nature of the information. In 2012, they wrote an open letter to Attorney General Eric Holder about this issue, saying, \\"We believe most Americans would be stunned to learn the details of how these secret court opinions have interpreted Section 215 of the Patriot Act.\\" On June 6, 2013, The Washington Post and The Guardian published a classified FISC order leaked by Edward Snowden. The leaked order compelled Verizon to produce telephony metadata records on an ongoing daily basis to the NSA. This disclosure of the bulk telephony metadata collection initiated public debate about the constitutionality of NSA's surveillance program and brought forth the question of whether the FISC court had exceeded its statutory authority in granting the Verizon order. EPIC, the petitioner in this action, is a public interest research center focused on First Amendment and other constitutional issues of privacy, open government, free speech, and other civil liberties.http://epic.org/epic/about.html Facts The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) filed an application with the FISC to compel Verizon to produce telephony metadata from its customers' calls for 90 days. According to the FISA order, telephony metadata includes \\"comprehensive communications routing information, including but not limited to session identifying information (e.g., originating and terminating telephone number, International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) number, International Mobile station Equipment Identity (IMEI) number, etc.), trunk identifier, telephone calling card numbers, and time and duration of call. Telephony metadata does not include the substantive content of any communication, as defined by 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 2510(8), or the name, address, or financial information of a subscriber or customer.\\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/jun/06/verizon- telephone-data-court-order On April 25, 2013, the FBI was successful in getting the FISC to grant a FISA order compelling Verizon to produce the metadata of its entire customer base for 90 days and provide it to the National Security Agency (NSA). Judge Roger Vinson presided over the proceeding. This particular FISA order came to light as part of the uncovering actions taken by Edward Snowden.https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/intelligence-leaders-push- back-on-leakers- media/2013/06/09/fff80160-d122-11e2-a73e-826d299ff459_story.html EPIC's Petition= Requirements for Writ of Mandamus  Mandamus is a remedy available for \\"extraordinary circumstances amounting to a judicial 'usurpation of power'\\" or a \\"clear abuse of discretion,\\" and is guided by 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1651(a) and Supreme Court Rule 20.1.Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Court for the Dist. of Columbia Cheney v. United States District Court laid out three conditions to using this type of relief: \\"(1) the party must have no other adequate means to attain the relief he deserves, (2) the party must satisfy the burden of showing that his right to issuance of the writ is clear and indisputable, and (3) the issuing court must be satisfied that the writ is appropriate under the circumstances.\\"In re Electronic Privacy Information Center  EPIC's Arguments  In EPIC's filing, it laid out the following arguments for why the Supreme Court should grant the Petition: :1. EPIC cannot obtain relief from any other court or forum ::a. EPIC cannot seek relief from the FISC or Court of Review ::b. No other court can grant EPIC the relief it seeks :2. The FISC order exceeded the scope of the FISC's jurisdiction under the FISA ::a. Mandamus aids the Court's appellate jurisdiction when it prevents a lower court from exceeding its lawful authority ::b. The FISC lacks the legal authority to order programmatic domestic surveillance under 50 U.S.C. ¬ß 1861 :3. The FISC order creates exceptional circumstances warranting mandamus ::a. Telephony metadata reveals significant private information about EPIC and millions of other americans ::b. EPIC is in active litigation against the very agencies tracking EPIC's privileged attorney-client communications ::c. EPIC confidentially communicates with members of congress, agency officials, journalists, and others to further its First Amendment-protected advocacy ::d. The FISC order compels disclosure of judicial and congressional communications, raising separation of powers concerns =Statutory authority= EPIC asked the Court to consider whether the FISC was acting beyond its authority by applying the FISA order to telephonic communications that were \\"wholly within the United States, including local telephone calls.\\" Under FISA, the FBI \\"may make an application for an order requiring the production of any tangible things . . . for an investigation to obtain foreign intelligence information not concerning a United States person or to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities.\\" EPIC challenged the connection between the FISA order and the government's anti- terrorist efforts, arguing that \\"[i]t is simply unreasonable to conclude that all telephone records for all Verizon customers in the United States could be relevant to an investigation\\" (emphasis added). =Jurisdiction and relief= Is the Supreme Court the appropriate forum for this case? Would the FISC or the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review (FISCR) be a better place for this to be heard? EPIC argues that those courts would not have the authority to provide the relief it seeks. However, at least one academic is of the belief that this is an erroneous argument and that starting in one of those two lower courts would, even if denied, provide a better path to the Supreme Court.http://www.lawfareblog.com/2013/07/the- supreme-courts-power-to-hear-in-re-epic/ Amicus briefs There were four amicus briefs filed with the Court: (1) brief amici curiae of Professors of Information Privacy and Surveillance Law; (2) brief amici curiae of Professors James E.

Decision On November 18, 2013, the Supreme Court denied EPIC's petition, likely on procedural grounds.https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/13-58.htmhttps://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/19/us/justices- reject-challenge-to-nsa-program.html In its October 11, 2013 response to EPIC's petition, the government had also argued that the proper procedure would be to first file an action in a federal district court.https://epic.org/privacy/nsa/in-re-epic/13-58-SG-Brief.pdf Effects of the decision By denying EPIC's petition, the Supreme Court avoided having to wrestle with the privacy issue at hand. There are, however, other cases addressing the same or similar issues in the pipeline, such as ACLU v. Clapper, that the Supreme Court may choose to hear arguments for and write a full opinion.

The site had a map function where the address of the subject of the criminal trial was revealed. Lexbase was closed down by the Internet service provider Bahnhof on 29 January 2014, just two days after launch, after the site came under heavy criticism from Swedish media, government and the general public. Through a virtual server by the company City Networks, Lexbase was able to relaunch on 31 January 2014, however it was closed down once again within hours of becoming available. Since the beginning of April, Lexbase is up and running again, probably operating from servers based in several countries. Lexbase not only provides access to a person's criminal record, but also to the verdict, judgment and sentencing. The map was relaunched at the end of May. Lexbase owes its existence to the Principle of Public Access (offentlighetsprincipen) regarding official documents, a right guaranteed by the Constitution of Sweden since 1766. The Principle of Public Access guarantees that official documents of government agencies can be accessed by the general public. There has been a discussion in Sweden over whether the Principle of Public Access is adapted to the modern society, but since the Principle of Public Access is guaranteed in the Swedish constitution it is very difficult and time-consuming to change it. Moreover, the Principle of Public Access is a source of pride among Swedish decision makers and citizens, since it allows a very high degree of transparency. It was one of the major rights that Sweden was allowed to retain when it joined the European Union, one which Swedish EU negotiators fervently argued they should keep at the time.  Complaints  After the website closure in February 2014, almost 300 complaints were recorded aiming to stop the service, claiming that it violates defamation laws. But since Lexbase is protected by the Principle of Public Access, the only possible prosecutor in this case would be Chancellor of Justice, Anna Skarhed, (in Swedish JK, Justitiekanslern). One of the main tasks of this state-run agency is \\"to ensure that the limits of the freedom of the press and other media are not transgressed and to act as sole prosecutor in cases concerning offences against the freedom of the press and the freedom of expression\\". However, the Chancellor of Justice decided not to press charges against Lexbase. This decision was published at the end of March 2014. It was the main reason for Lexbase to reopen. The decision of the Chancellor of Justice outraged many people in Sweden, especially those with a criminal record who soon realized that they would have to face a lot of problems in the future to find a job, a house or even a partner, and they now fear that they might be discriminated by many companies and institutions, including banks and medical healthcare. They think that the state has betrayed them. Some people say they even consider suicide. Another organisation, ReclaimJustice, has appealed the decision of Chancellor of Justice Anna Skarhed and aims to bring Sweden into the European court of Justice, saying that it violates some fundamental human rights, i.e. Article 8 of the European Convention of Human rights.

The event marked Chikara's fifth iPPV and first event since Aniversario: Never Compromise in June 2013. Background You Only Live Twice featured eight professional wrestling matches involving different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots, and storylines that will be played out on Chikara's monthly house shows and on blog entries written on the promotion's official website. Wrestlers will portray villains (rudos in Chikara) or heroes (tecnicos in Chikara) as they follow a series of events that build tension, and culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches. Chikara follows lucha libre traditions and is known for its colorful characters and gimmicks and family-friendly content. Following June 2, 2013, and the Aniversario: Never Compromise internet pay- per-view (iPPV), Chikara went inactive for a full year, following a storyline development, where the Titor Conglomerate, the storyline owners of the promotion, shut it down in order to cover their tracks regarding their dark past involving a paramilitary group named Condor Security. The Titor Conglomerate then supposedly put the Chikara brand, its related intellectual properties and remaining physical assets on sale, reducing the promotion to ashes. During the rest of the year, a group of Chikara wrestlers, led by Icarus, began holding fan gatherings and \\"guerrilla events\\", trying to revive the promotion. This led to the Flood, a group of rudos from Chikara's past, coming together and starting to shut down Chikara's several smaller sister promotions in order to destroy its final remnants. The storyline culminated on February 1, 2014, during the National Pro Wrestling Day, when the two groups collided. After the Chikara wrestlers had prevailed, Icarus announced that Chikara was coming back on May 25, ending the promotion's one-year-long hiatus. In storyline, the return was made possible by former Chikara wrestler Robbie Ellis winning an auction and becoming the promotion's new owner. The name of the return event was later revealed as \\"You Only Live Twice\\", making it one of several Chikara shows to be held in 2014 named after James Bond films. Tickets for the event were sold out within days with no roster or matches announced. On April 1, Chikara announced that You Only Live Twice would be broadcast live on iPPV through Smart Mark Video. As part of Chikara's return weekend, the promotion presented \\"LuchaBowl\\", a fundraiser for a local chapter of the Make-A-Wish Foundation, on May 24 and \\"Expansion Pack\\", an interactive fan fest, before the iPPV on May 25. Also on May 24, Chikara's sister promotion Wrestling is Fun! (WiF!) presented the finals of the 2014 Tag World Grand Prix, a tournament held by Chikara from 2003 to 2013. (Left to right) Kodama, Obariyon and Kobald of The Batiri On May 5, Chikara announced the first match for the iPPV, which would see The Batiri of Kobald, Kodama and Obariyon take on Sinn Bodhi and the Odditorium of Oliver Grimsly and Qefka the Quiet in a six-man tag team match. The match is part of the big return storyline with The Batiri, longtime rudos turning tecnicos to represent Chikara, while Sinn Bodhi returned as part of the Flood. As part of the storyline, Bodhi successfully took over Wrestling is Art in November 2013 and promptly shut it down. The Batiri have a long history with Bodhi with them being introduced to Chikara in late 2010 as Bodhi's minions. In storyline, UltraMantis Black hired Bodhi to train him three minions, but when the time came, he could not produce payment, which led to Bodhi turning on him and taking control of The Batiri himself. Bodhi and The Batiri remained together as the Dark Army until Bodhi left Chikara at the end of 2011, after finally getting his payment. You Only Live Twice marks the Odditorium's debut in Chikara. On May 8, Chikara announced the first title match for the iPPV, where Eddie Kingston would defend the Chikara Grand Championship against Icarus in a match \\"one year in the making\\". On June 2, 2013, Kingston and Icarus faced off in the main event of Aniversario: Never Compromise. In the weeks leading to the event, Icarus, once known as one of the most hated wrestlers in Chikara, turned tecnico and, following the implosion of his F.I.S.T. stable, began chasing the promotion's top title, held by Kingston, who in turn had begun showing signs of a rudo turn. At the iPPV, Icarus had the match won, when Condor Security interrupted the match and shut down the event, leading to the one-year long hiatus. During the hiatus, Icarus was the leader of the group of wrestlers trying to bring Chikara back, while Kingston was one of the few Chikara wrestlers not to align with the group. During the National Pro Wrestling Day, when he was met with chants of \\"Chikara\\", Kingston even proclaimed that the promotion was dead. Kingston and Icarus are both Chikara originals, with Icarus graduating from the promotion's first group of trainees and Kingston from the second in 2002. Jimmy Jacobs During Chikara's one-year hiatus, the promotion chronicled various storylines in a YouTube series titled Ashes. One of these storylines involved the tag team 3.0 (Scott Parker and Shane Matthews) going on a road trip to find Archibald Peck, who, after taking a Backfist to the Future from Eddie Kingston in May 2013, had supposedly been sent back in time to June 2012 to close a time paradox his earlier time traveling had caused. During the National Pro Wrestling Day, Jimmy Jacobs, who had made some appearances for Chikara in the past, but was not a regular member of the promotion's roster, revealed himself as the leader of the Flood. The Chikara side eventually prevailed in the brawl between the two groups, but only after 3.0 brought Peck to the scene in a DeLorean. On May 12, Chikara announced a singles match between Peck and Jacobs for You Only Live Twice. One stable from Chikara's past included in the Flood was Bruderschaft des Kreuzes (BDK), who had dominated Chikara after forming in November 2009, winning all of its major accomplishments. In storyline, BDK's formation was a direct result of rudo UltraMantis Black trying to use \\"black arts\\" to elevate his Order of the Neo-Solar Temple to new heights. After originally trying to avoid BDK, UltraMantis was finally pulled into a feud with the stable in early 2010, after BDK dissolved the Order of the Neo-Solar Temple. After Sinn Bodhi also took The Batiri away from UltraMantis, he finally found himself new allies in longtime tecnicos Frightmare and Hallowicked, with the three coming together to form the Spectral Envoy stable. In exchange for the help, UltraMantis vowed to right his past wrongs, which included both the Dark Army and BDK. The Spectral Envoy's feud with BDK lasted until Chikara's first iPPV, High Noon in November 2011, where BDK was defeated and effectively dissolved. Two years later, BDK returned to destroy Chikara's sister promotions and successfully shut down Wrestling is Cool in December 2013, when the promotion's owner Milo Schnitzler revealed himself a BDK sleeper agent and showed his allegiance to the stable's leader Ares by ending the company. On May 14, Chikara announced that at You Only Live Twice, the Spectral Envoy would take on BDK, represented by Ares and the debuting duo of Schnitzler and N√∏kken. Also announced for the event is a singles match between Jervis Cottonbelly and the debuting Juan Francisco de Coronado, better known from WiF!, and a four-way elimination tag team match between 3.0 (Scott Parker and Shane Matthews), Gekido (17 and deviAnt), Pieces of Hate (Jigsaw and The Shard) and the Throwbacks (Dasher Hatfield and Mark Angelosetti). In Chikara, teams need three points, or three back-to-back wins, in order to be eligible to challenge for the promotion's tag team championship, the Campeonatos de Parejas. A team could earn all three points in this match by scoring all three eliminations. Pieces of Hate were the reigning Campeones de Parejas, while the other three teams in the match stood at zero points. 3.0 lost the title to Pieces of Hate at Chikara's previous event, Aniversario: Never Compromise, while 17 and deviAnt, though Gekido stablemates, had not wrestled a regular tag team match together prior to You Only Live Twice. The Throwbacks, who earned a spot in the match by winning WiF!'s 2014 Tag World Grand Prix the day before You Only Live Twice, had previously challenged for the Campeonatos de Parejas on July 29, 2012, but heading into the iPPV stood at zero points after losing another four-way elimination match on April 6, 2013. Gekido and Pieces of Hate were both also affiliated with the Flood. The Colony celebrating their 2011 King of Trios win, which was retroactively taken away from them as part of a storyline with The Colony: Xtreme Force On May 19, Chikara announced the seventh and final match for the event, where The Colony (assailAnt, Fire Ant and Green Ant) faces The Colony: Xtreme Force (Arctic Rescue Ant, Missile Assault Ant and Orbit Adventure Ant). The storyline behind the match started in July 2012, when then-Director of Fun Wink Vavasseur broke up one of Chikara's most popular acts, The Colony of Fire Ant, Green Ant and Soldier Ant, by moving Soldier Ant to The Swarm, a sub-group within Gekido, while replacing him in The Colony with Swarm member assailAnt. At the end of the year, assailAnt changed his rudo ways and was accepted as a member of The Colony, while Soldier Ant refused to change his ways and was left outside of Gekido and The Swarm, now without any partners. Vavasseur promised Soldier Ant a new team to lead and in March 2013 introduced The Colony: Xtreme Force of Arctic Rescue Ant, Missile Assault Ant and Orbit Adventure Ant. The move was portrayed as simply a marketing ploy by Vavasseur, who even stripped the original Colony of their 2011 King of Trios win and awarded it to his new trio. After only a month of teaming with his new rudo partners, Soldier Ant handed in his resignation to Vavasseur and left Chikara. Afterwards, Gekido and Swarm member deviAnt took over as Xtreme Force's new leader. During the one-year hiatus, The Colony and Xtreme Force were on opposing sides, with The Colony fighting for Chikara and Xtreme Force for the Flood.

It was created by Aaron Swartz and Virgil Griffith. History Tor is a network which enables people to use the Internet anonymously (though with known weaknesses) and to publish content on \\"hidden services\\", which exist only within the Tor network for security reasons and thus are typically only accessible to the relatively small number of people using a Tor-connected web browser. Aaron Swartz and Virgil Griffith developed Tor2web in 2008 as a way to support whistleblowing and other forms of anonymous publishing through Tor, allowing materials to remain anonymous while making them accessible to a broader audience. In an interview with Wired Swartz explained that Tor is great for anonymous publishing, but because its focus is not user-friendliness and thus not many people would install it, he wanted to \\"produce this hybrid where people could publish stuff using Tor and make it so that anyone on the internet could view it\\". The software developed by Swartz and Griffith is today considered version 1.0. Since then, it has been maintained and developed by Giovanni Pellerano from the Hermes Center for Transparency and Digital Human Rights as part of the GlobaLeaks Project, with financial support from the Open Technology Fund. Version 2.0 was released in August 2011, and version 3.0 is in beta . Operation and security Rather than typical top-level domains like \`.com\`, \`.org\`, or \`.net\`, hidden service URLs end with \`.onion\` and are only accessible when connected to Tor. Tor2web acts as a specialized proxy or middleman between hidden services and users, making them visible to people who are not connected to Tor. To do so, a user takes the URL of a hidden service and replaces \`.onion\` with \`.tor2web.io\`. Like Tor, Tor2web operates using servers run voluntarily by an open community of individuals and organizations. Tor2web preserves the anonymity of content publishers but is not itself an anonymity tool and does not offer any protection to users beyond relaying data using HTTP Secure (HTTPS). Since version 2.0, a privacy and security warning is added to the header of each web page it fetches, encouraging readers to use the Tor Browser Bundle to obtain anonymity.

The event occurred after Hurricane Juan, a tropical cyclone in the 1985 Atlantic hurricane season, meandered near the coast of Louisiana before striking just west of Pensacola, Florida late on October 31\\\\. Juan moved northward into Canada, but spawned another system that spread moderate rainfall across the Mid-Atlantic States, wetting soils. On November 3, a low pressure area developed south of Florida and moved northeastward along a cold front, bringing a plume of moisture influenced by Juan's previous track. The storm moved through the southeastern United States, stalling on November 5 west of Washington, D.C. before turning out to sea the next day. The event was known as the Election Day floods due to its concurrence with elections in Virginia. Damage was heaviest in Virginia and West Virginia. In the former state, the rainfall peaked at just northeast of Montebello. The rains increased levels along many rivers to record heights across Virginia, including the James River which crested at at a station called Holcomb Rock, the highest level in the state. In Roanoke, the Roanoke River rose in ten hours to a peak of , considered a 1 in 200 year event. In the city, many residents had to be rescued after they were trapped, and three people drowned by driving into flooded waters. Considered the worst flood on record in the city, Roanoke sustained $225 million in damage, with 3,100 damaged homes and businesses. There was also flooding in Richmond after the James River crested at the second-highest level on record. Throughout Virginia, damage was estimated at $753 million, making it the state's costliest flood at the time, and there were 22 deaths. In West Virginia, 27 river gauging stations were 1 in 100 year events, mostly along the Potomac and Monongahela basins. As most of West Virginia's liveable land is along flood plains, the river flooding caused heavy damage in the state, mostly in the eastern portion. High waters washed away topsoil and thousands of trees, and over 13,000 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed in the state. Damage was estimated at nearly $700 million, making it West Virginia's costliest flood, and there were 38 deaths. Flooding also affected Maryland, although to a lesser degree than neighboring Virginia, with $21 million in damage and one death. There was also tidal flooding in the state along the Chesapeake Bay from the storm, which washed away beaches just weeks after Hurricane Gloria affected the coastline. In Pennsylvania, flooding was worst along the Monongahela River in the state's southwest portion. During the storm, a power company opened the flood gates of the Lake Lynn dam along the river to preserve its integrity, triggering a class action lawsuit that ultimately failed. The floods damaged or destroyed 3,349 houses in Pennsylvania, causing $83 million in damage, as well as one death. Overall damage was estimated at $1.4 billion, which would have been the fourth costliest United States hurricanes if it were a tropical cyclone, and there were 62 overall deaths. The flooding spurred changes to warning practices by the National Weather Service and the Government of Virginia. In December 2011, the United States Army Corps of Engineers completed a flood mitigation project in Roanoke, Virginia that began following the 1985 floods. Meteorological history Early on October 26, a tropical depression formed in the central Gulf of Mexico, and intensified into Hurricane Juan while meandering northward. The storm had a large wind field and was somewhat subtropical in nature. Due to weak steering currents, Juan looped once offshore Louisiana and later looped again over the state, weakening into a tropical storm over land on October 29\\\\. The storm turned eastward and later northeastward, striking just west of Pensacola, Florida late on October 31\\\\. Juan turned to the north over land and became extratropical on November 1 over Tennessee. After the remnants of Juan continued to the north into Canada, it spawned an occluded low in the Tennessee Valley. This low continued to the east through North Carolina, bringing moderate rainfall throughout the region, and saturating soils; overcast skies and the weak sunlight of early November prevented much of the rains from evaporating. On November 3, while the low was located over North Carolina, a stationary cold front extended from the Gulf of Mexico through Michigan, which absorbed the remnants of Juan. That day, a low pressure area developed in the Gulf of Mexico south of the Florida panhandle and tracked to the northeast along the front, bringing a plume of warm tropical air into the east-central United States; the previously erratic motion of Hurricane Juan allowed this flow of moisture to extend into the mid- Atlantic. As a result, dew points reached over in North Carolina, which is unusually high for the time of year. As the storm moved through the Carolinas, it produced an area of convection, or thunderstorms, that extended to the north and west. The low stalled over Virginia on November 5 to the west of Washington, D.C., before turning to the east and exiting into the Atlantic Ocean, with rainfall ending on November 6. Preparations and warnings Ahead of the main rainfall event, the National Weather Service (NWS) forecast office in Washington, D.C. issued a flood watch for southwestern Virginia, but canceled it early on November 4 after the heaviest rainfall was expected to continue to the northeast. Also that day, the NWS issued flood watches and warnings for portions of West Virginia. Later, special weather statements were issued in Virginia due to the continued rainfall. The Roanoke, Virginia NWS office lost telephone service shortly before the arrival of the flooding, which created difficulties in distributing warning information. Based on the rapid level increase of the Roanoke River, the Raleigh, North Carolina NWS issued a flash flood warning for Roanoke and its surrounding vicinity. The NWS also issued a river flood warning, initially anticipating a crest of , and later increasing the estimate to . In Virginia and Maryland along the western coast of the Chesapeake Bay, several low-lying and small coastal communities were evacuated. About 18,000 people were forced to evacuate in western Virginia due to river flooding. In West Virginia, residents relied on fire and civil defense sirens to receive warning about the floods, although some people in flood areas failed to receive any warning. Before the arrival of the floods, 23 of the 55 counties lacked updated disaster plans due to insufficient staff or funding, and as a result 29 counties' plans were rated \\"poor\\" or \\"very poor\\" by Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Impact Rainfall map for the storm in the eastern United States The system dropped rainfall from North Carolina to Pennsylvania, westward to Ohio, with a peak of just northeast of Montebello, Virginia. Widespread areas reported over of precipitation, with an unofficial total of about in West Virginia. Flash flooding occurred in mountainous portions of Virginia, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania, after orographic lift caused particularly high rainfall totals in the southern Appalachian Mountains. A total of 63 gauging stations along rivers and streams recorded flood magnitudes greater than the 100-year event, of which 40 surpassed the previous record by more than 50%. In addition to the floods, the storm produced the highest tidal flooding in the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries since the 1933 Chesapeake‚ÄìPotomac hurricane, and in some cases surpassed that of Hurricane Hazel in 1954. This was due to persistent southeasterly winds just days after a full moon, causing tides that reached above normal in many places in Maryland, with waves on top. Overall damage totaled $1.4 billion, and the system killed 62 people; if the system were a tropical cyclone, it would have ranked as the fourth costliest United States hurricane at the time. While moving through the southeastern United States, the storm produced gale-force winds along the Outer Banks, and there were reports of two weak tornadoes that damaged boats. Rainfall reached in eastern North Carolina, which flooded coastal cities in combination with high tides. Crop damage in the state was estimated at $1.5 million, mostly to the soybean and wheat harvests. Flooding reached a depth of in some places, which damaged roads and affected a trailer park in Hertford County. The floods also destroyed a fish building in Colerain. In the Piedmont interior, the rainfall flooded streams, flooding some roads and houses, while in mountainous portions, upwards of of snow fell. The high rainfall caused levels to increase along the Ohio River in Kentucky. Rainfall spread as far north as New York, which flooded basements in Amherst and increased levels along streams. Virginia The high rainfall caused many rivers to rise above their banks across Virginia, becoming among the top three highest crests on record along several rivers in the state. The flood set the highest river stage on record along the Roanoke River at Roanoke, Tinker Creek near Daleville, the Calfpasture River at Goshen, the Craig Creek at Parr, and the James River at Buchanan, Holcomb Rock, and Bent Creek. At Holcomb Rock, the James River crested at , the highest in the state, and was about above flood stage; based on the observations and the associated discharge, the return period was estimated as greater than a 1 in 500 year event. River gauges recorded record discharge rates at 34 stations, of which 32 were 100 year events. The rains delayed crops from being planted across the state and caused minor crop damage. Across the state, about 3,500 houses were destroyed. Overall, the storm system caused 22 deaths and $753 million, greater than the devastating hurricanes Camille and Agnes, and making it the costliest flood in the state's history. Hydrograph of the Roanoke River in Roanoke, Virginia, showing a increase in 10 hours The city of Roanoke recorded in a 24‚Äëhour period, the highest 24‚Äëhour total on record for the city since records began in 1912; of the total, fell in about three hours. After previously wet conditions, the Roanoke River at Roanoke rapidly rose in ten hours to its peak of , well above the flood stage of . The floods were considered a 1 in 200 year event, and in one instance near Salem, the waters rose to the height of a three-story building. Many surrounding rivers, including the James River, also rose, with 63 peak discharge rates in local streams. The high rivers flooded much of downtown Roanoke, including roads, rail lines, houses, and businesses, with some roads and bridges closed for weeks. Residents survived by holding onto trees, while others, some trapped in their cars, required rescue; one helicopter rescued 125 stranded people. There were 10 deaths in and around Roanoke, including three who drove into flooded rivers, and three others who refused to evacuate. The floods damaged about 3,000 homes and 100 businesses. Overall monetary damage in the city was estimated at $225 million, with $520 million in the entire metropolitan area, making it the city's worst flood on record. Across the Shenandoah Valley, the flooding caused widespread damage, notably in Rockingham County where the floods damaged most of the roads, and entered 4,000 houses and 350 farms. Along the Shenandoah River, 13 gauging stations reported new discharge records, including the reading at Verona which was five times the previous record. In Elkton within the county, an 89‚Äëyear‚Äëold railroad bridge was washed out, although nearby Bridgewater had less flooding due to a levee built in 1949; the town sustained minor damage to roads and the hydroelectric plant. In nearby Highland County along the border with West Virginia, the floods damaged 350 homes or barns, and deteriorated $2 million worth of roads. In Augusta County, also along the West Virginia border, the Buffalo Creek swept away bridges and roads, with $8 million in transportation damage and $7 million in other damages in the county. Staunton, a city independent from Augusta County, experienced minimal effects, although the water treatment plant was damaged and a hotel basement was flooded. Waynesboro, also within Augusta County, sustained $3 million in damages after the South River reached a record crest, damaging 213 homes and businesses. Damage was particularly heavy in Rockbridge County, estimated at $100 million, with 616 homes and businesses ravaged by floods. In Buena Vista alone, the Maury River left $50 million in damage, after of water entered homes and businesses. Over half of the homes and businesses were damaged in Glasgow. Along the James River, 15 gauging stations reported new records. At Lynchburg, the James River rose to , surpassing the record set by Hurricane Camille in 1969 by . There, the river swept up entire houses, causing portions of U.S. Route 29 to close, and ruining about $8 million worth of tobacco. In Richmond, the James River rose to on November 7, the second-highest peak on record after the set by Hurricane Agnes in 1972. The floods in Richmond closed a portion of Interstate 95, and nearly overtopped the 14th Street Bridge. Three bridges were closed, resulting in heavy traffic due to detours. Portions of the industrial district south of the river was flooded, as were commercial buildings. In eastern Virginia, high winds downed several trees in the eastern portion of the state, causing power outages and blocking roadways. Falling trees struck two vehicles, injuring three people. Along the Chesapeake Bay, high tides severely damaged or destroyed 75% of piers along the Patomac and Rappahannock rivers. Flooding entered about 150 houses in Colonial Beach, while many adjacent highways and seawalls were heavily damaged. The tides damaged several marinas, sinking several boats. At the mouth of the James River, high waves capsized a crab boat, killing its two passengers. A ferry was also washed aground on the James River. Several beaches lost of sand. The floods occurred election day throughout the state, in which Gerald Baliles won the governorship over Wyatt Durrette. The election had a decreased turnout from 1981, the first such decrease since 1961. The floods caused the three districts in western Virginia to have the lowest turnouts in the state, although other counties not affected by the overall system also saw decreased turnout. The event later became known as the \\"Election Day Floods\\" due to their concurrence. West Virginia Destroyed railroad and highway bridge in Rowlesburg, West Virginia After previously dry conditions, severe flooding also occurred in West Virginia, amplified by the mountainous terrain. Record discharge rates were observed at 25 gauging stations, and 27 stations along rivers were at least 100 year events, setting records along the Potomac and Monongahela rivers, among several others. While washing away large rocks, some streams changed their channels due to the high volume of water. Near Petersburg, the South Branch Potomac River crested at and produced a record discharge of , and the peak discharge at Franklin was nearly three times the previous record. At five of the six gauging stations along the Potomac, there were new records for discharge rates. Along the Potomac, the floodwaters collected behind dams, causing 21 to exceed the capacity designed to withstand a 100-year flood. All five stations along the Greenbrier River recorded a new record discharge rate, as did all five along the Tygart Valley River. The flash flooding caused the Bloomington Reservoir to rise in 30 hours. Several caves were flooded, causing high amounts of erosion and damaging some speleothems. After the flooding, Mystic Cave in Pendleton County had tree branches wedged into the ceiling and a layer of sand on the floor. Flooding was worst along the Cheat River, where five of the six gauging stations set new discharge records. At Parsons, the river produced a discharge of , which was about 3.8 times the previous flood record, and 3.5 times the rate of a 100-year flood. At Rowlesburg, the Cheat River crested at , which remains the highest on record as of 2013. At Hendricks, the Dry Fork of the Cheat River had a peak flow of , more than twice the previous record. As most of the livable land in West Virginia is in the flood plain, the high river flooding caused heavy damage, wrecking many small rural towns and washing out miles of roadways. A total of 43 bridges were destroyed and another 80 were damaged. Near Moorefield, the bridge carrying U.S. Route 220 was closed, but was reopened after emergency repairs. In Paw Paw, a flooded river washed a swept up building into a bridge, washing it away. Much of Pendleton County became isolated after 18 bridges were washed out and roads were covered by mudslides. The Cheat River destroyed 110 of the 132 houses in Albright, and washed away a trailer park in Rowlesburg. The flooding downed thousands of trees, which were carried into houses and recreation areas to cause additional damage. Agriculture losses were heavy after the floods washed away the topsoil and left behind miles of debris. Many farm structures were washed away, and hundreds of thousands of chicken or turkeys were killed. Statewide, at least 8,968 houses were damaged, and another 4,000 were destroyed, which left nearly 2,600 people homeless. In addition, the floods damaged or destroyed 711 businesses. Agriculture damage was estimated at $97 million, and damage to the United States Forest Service in the state was estimated at $3.9 million. Statewide damage totaled nearly $700 million, and 38 people were killed in West Virginia. This made it the most damaging flood in the state's history, according to then-Governor Arch A. Moore, Jr. Maryland, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania Flooding in Maryland largely occurred along the Potomac River, primarily along the north branch, as well as downstream after draining floodwaters from Virginia and West Virginia. Two gauging stations recorded new discharge records, although the peak of at Paw Paw was slightly less than the record set in 1936. There was also flooding along the Youghiogheny River, which had a peak discharge of at Oakland, just below the record set in 1941. The floods along the Potomac swept up debris and animals. In Georgetown in Washington, D.C., the floods reached within of overtopping the lock, thus preventing significant flooding in the nation's capital, although floodwaters reached deep in portions of the neighborhood. Levels along the Potomac in Washington were the third highest on record. Officials closed the Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial, and Jefferson Memorial for two days due to fears of flooding. The floods left $9 million worth of damage to the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal between Georgetown and Cumberland, Maryland, which was closed for the first time in its 157-year history. In general, the floods in Maryland caused less damage than in neighboring states, and overall damage in the state was estimated at $21 million; there was one death. Along the Chesapeake Bay, the high tides damaged many piers, bulkheads, and coastal homes along the western coastline of the Chesapeake, mainly in Maryland between St. Mary's and Anne Arundel counties. High waters damaged roads and entered many cars while also washing away several boats. Along the Atlantic coast, high waves washed away of beaches in Ocean City, just months after Hurricane Gloria eroded twice that amount of sand. In addition, winds gusted as strong as , which downed power lines and left thousands without power. During the storm, a member of the United States Coast Guard was injured while responding to a hoax mayday call. Damage in eastern Maryland totaled over $5 million. High rainfall also flooded streams in southwestern Pennsylvania, estimated as 50 year events, and primarily along the Monongahela River. In Point Marion at the confluence of the Monongahela and Cheat rivers, the waters crested at , or above flood stage. There were many evacuation orders after a false report that the Lake Lynn dam had burst, which is located along the Cheat River several miles south of Point Marion in extreme northern West Virginia. The dam, owned by West Penn Power, reached the highest levels in its 60-year history, prompting the company to open flood gates, which flooded Point Marion with of water. The Monongahela River crested at , or above flood state in Brownsville, and rose above flood stage in Greensboro. In the latter city, the peak discharge rate was , 60% greater than the previous record, and downstream at Elizabeth, the peak discharge was , also a record. Damage in Pennsylvania largely occurred along the Monongahela River basin. In Brownsville, 35 businesses were flooded, while in Greensboro, high waters damaged roads and forced 300 people to evacuate. During the floods, 23 barges broke free and became lodged in the Maxwell Lock & Dam, which is an important shipping link; the lock remained closed for nearly six weeks, costing the local economy $20 million in lost production. The same river crested at in Charleroi, breaking the record set in 1967. The flooded river caused $1 million in damage at California University of Pennsylvania, broke 40 barges from their moorings, and forced about 2,600 people to evacuate; one person in North Charleroi drowned after returning to his evacuated home. Throughout the region, the floods damaged or destroyed 3,349 houses, leaving at least 2,000 people homeless, and statewide damage was estimated at $83 million. Aftermath In the aftermath of the floods, President Ronald Reagan declared 121 counties or other areas as disaster areas, including 40 counties and 12 independent cities in Virginia, 29 West Virginia counties, and 6 Pennsylvania counties. After a year of hurricanes Elena, Gloria, and Juan, as well as flooding in Puerto Rico, the American Red Cross ran out of funds while responding to the flood disaster, prompting an emergency fundraising appeal. Much of the eastern portion of West Virginia was declared a federal disaster area on November 7, 1985. Within two weeks of the declaration, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) began clearing debris across the state, which was completed by July 1986. Widespread areas were under a boil-water advisory due to damage to water facilities, prompting officials to deliver trucks with bottled water through disaster areas. The state's highway department worked with FEMA and the USACE to clear destroyed buildings. Workers also buried killed animals, cleared blocked streams, and helped farmers regrow lost crops. FEMA opened 20 disaster centers across the state to coordinate residents' requests for federal aid, and used 290 full or part-time employees. Overall federal assistance totaled $285 million, including $171 million for debris removal and repairing infrastructure, $90 million for loans and temporary housing, and $24 million through payments from the National Flood Insurance Program. This followed a six-week period when applications for such assistance were processed. After receiving complaints about inadequate funding, FEMA increased payments to 869 people. FEMA also built 647 temporary mobile homes, only about half of which were utilized. Residents complained that the money spent on the homes was misdirected and instead should have been given directly to victims. Many residents in Albright moved away after the main industry - river rafting - was washed away. In the city of Parsons, most businesses relied on small business loans to continue operating, although 18 stores never reopened following the floods. Officials held a telethon on state television and radio on December 7, 1985, that ultimately raised $1.7 million for storm victims in the state. In the years after the flood, residents rebuilt houses farther away from flood plains, while officials rebuilt roads, bridges, and public buildings. In general, the USACE credited existing flood control projects as preventing additional flooding. In West Virginia alone, it was estimated that existing flood-control projects saved about $135 million in damage. Lake Moomaw in western Virginia helped prevent $70 million in damage along the James River. In Pennsylvania, flood measures resulted in minimal flooding along the Youghiogheny River. After sustaining damage from flooding along the Monongahela River with little warning, the owners of a marina filed a class action lawsuit in the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County on November 21, 1985, against West Penn Power Company to compensate for damages. The plaintiffs believed that the damage occurred because the company opened the flood gates of the Lake Lynn Dam. The power company attempted to move the case to the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania in March 1986, citing the Federal Power Act's provision that claims should be in the District Court, but the nature of the suit sent it back to the Court of Common Pleas, bringing it to trial in September 1989. The jury found that although the West Penn Power was negligent, the damage was caused mainly by the historic and unprecedented flooding; consequently, the case entered a compulsory nonsuit, meaning the company was not required to pay compensation. The plaintiffs sought an appeal in 1990, which was denied. The city of Roanoke, Virginia had experienced a series of major floods that affected. The floods caused by Hurricane Agnes in 1972 prompted a study that would channelize of the Roanoke River to increase water capacity. After the 1985 floods, the city council sought assistance from the USACE to build flood walls and improve river flow to mitigate against future flooding. The agency estimated that the project would cut the damage in half for a flood similar to the 1985 one. The cost for the project was initially project to be $34.4 million, of which the city was expected to pay $14.3 million. Private land donations and other financial sources provided about $6.8 million of the cost, while the remaining $7.5 million was covered by a bond, approved in an April 1989 single-issue referendum. This was the first such referendum for the city, and passed with 56.6% in support amid a voter turnout of 19.6%. The bond would be repaid by a 2% raise of the utility tax. Construction began in 1990, and that year a flood warning system was completed. In 1993, Roanoke's raw sewage plant and hospital finished flood proofing. The bulk of the project was finished in December 2011 when the final terrain cuts were made. When the project was completed, the USGS estimated that the annual damage from flooding decreased from $5.8 million to $2.7 million, and that the work prevented major floods in November 2009 from Hurricane Ida and January 2013. Also in the state, the General Assembly passed the \\"Virginia Flood Damage Reduction Act\\" in 1989, partly due to the flooding from 1985; this coordinated all work related to flood prevention throughout the state into one department. In Pennsylvania, then- governor Dick Thornburgh allocated $1 million in emergency aid for the disaster areas, and activated 600 National Guardsmen to help with clean up. After nine water plants were closed, the companies relied on reserves to provide water supply to local residents while also encouraging cutting back on usage. About 2,900 people in Washington County lost access to clean water. In the decades following the floods, the NWS utilized enhanced radar technology and computer models to better forecast flood events, as well as improved communications. Whereas in 1985, three different NWS agencies issued different warnings for the area affected in southwest Virginia, the NWS has since restructured to allow local offices, such as the one in Roanoke, to directly issue watches and warnings. The NWS also implemented increased flood prediction techniques across West Virginia in the years after the floods. As many West Virginia counties lacked a full-time emergency management director at the time, funding from the NWS provided 24‚Äëhour weather radios for every county by the year 1987.

Biography  Morfov's father was an officer, and his mother was a teacher in Russian language and literature, music, and also a conductor of a folklore choir in Sliven.http://www.sliven.net/ Sliven After Morfov graduated from the Mathematical high school he attended lectures for two years in the Technical University in Varna. Morfov's theater career began in student's years, when he participated as an assistant stage director in Stoyan Alexiev's theater company. After quitting university he began working in the theater in Sliven as a stage worker and later light manager. In 1984 he was enrolled in the National Academy for Theatre and Film Arts ‚ÄúKrastyo Sarafov‚Äù in Sofia. He graduated from the Academy with a double major in stage directing for drama and puppet theater (1990) in the class of Julia Ognyanova and cinema directing (1994) in the class of Georgi Dyulgerov.  Early works  His earliest works on a professional stage are in the Rhodope drama theater, where he was the author and director of the satire ‚ÄúPolitical cabaret‚Äù (1990). Immediately after his sophomore production he was invited to work at the Little City Theatre ‚ÄúOff the Channel‚Äù where he staged ‚ÄúPere Ubu‚Äù by Alfred Jarry (1991), followed by ‚ÄúThe Tempest‚Äù (1992) and ‚ÄúHamlet‚Äù by Shakespeare in the ‚ÄúLa Strada‚Äù theater.  Professional career in Bulgaria  From 1994 to 2000 he has been occupying the position Chief director at the ‚ÄúIvan Vazov‚Äù National Theatre of Bulgaria. Morfov‚Äôs first shows at the National Theatre were his original version of ‚ÄúDon Quixote‚Äù by Miguel de Cervantes and a revised version of ‚ÄúThe Tempest‚Äù. These two gave start to a whole new process of attracting young and modern-thinking audience to the theater. With his next production ‚Äì ‚ÄúMidsummernight‚Äôs Dream‚Äù by W. Shakespeare, Alexander Morfov became one of the most popular theater directors in Bulgaria. His original version of ‚ÄúThe Decameron, or Passion and Blood‚Äù after Boccaccio, also bears the traits of his stylistics. ‚ÄúThe Lower Depths‚Äù by Maxim Gorky is Morfov‚Äôs way of sharply stating his civil opinion without betraying his typical theatricality. ‚ÄúExiles‚Äù (2004) after a novel by Ivan Vazov, the national poet and writer, is the logical continuation to the latter. Among others, his productions on the leading stage in the country include: ‚ÄúNight of Miracles‚Äù after Beckett, Mrozek and Ionesco; ‚ÄúDom Juan‚Äù by Moliere; ‚ÄúOne Flew over the Cuckoo‚Äôs Nest‚Äù, ‚ÄúLife Is Beautiful‚Äù after Nikolai Erdman‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Suicide‚Äù, etc. In 2000 he was appointed managing and artistic director of the ‚ÄúIvan Vazov‚Äù National Theater.

International success thumb Since 2001 he has been successfully working in Russia. His first show ‚Äì The Tempest in the Komissarzhevskaya Theatre was a landmark event in St. Petersburg's theatre life and was honoured with Russia's most prestigious award in the field of theatre, the Golden Mask Award. Immediately after that he was invited to Moscow, to the theatre of the famous Russian actor Alexander Kalyagin, Et cetera, where he staged Don Quixote and Pere Ubu with Kalyagin in the leading role. Both productions were nominated for the Golden Mask Award and Alexander Kalyagin received the award for Best Performance for the role of pere Ubu. Between 2003 and 2006 he was appointed chief stage director in the Komissarzhevskaya Theatre where he staged five productions and received the Golden Soffit Award for Dom Juan by Moliere and was again nominated for the Golden Mask Award. His productions One Flew over the Cuckoo‚Äôs Nest with Alexandr Abdulov and The Visit of the Old Lady with Maria Mironova in Lenkom Theatre also proved to be significant events in Moscow's theatre life. Morfov has received more than twenty national and international theatre awards, among which are the Golden Mask Award, Chaika [seagull], Crystal Turandot, etc. In 2005 he worked in the United States with Mikhail Baryshnikov on the theatre project Doctor and Patient by Rezo Gabriadze. In 2006 he returned to the National Theatre of Bulgaria as a chief stage director ‚Äì a position he has been occupying since. Morfov's shows were presented at international theatre festivals in Vienna, Casablanca, Kiev, Torun, Ohrid, Belgrade, Wroc≈Çaw, Hamburg, etc. He has numerous successful projects in Europe ‚Äì France, Sweden, Macedonia, Romania, Latvia, and in the recent years in Israel.

With the company she presented 12 seasons of fully staged opera productions, as well as a highly active schedule of opera performances for school children. Glaz was trained at the University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna and the Mozarteum University of Salzburg. She married several times during her life: first to conductor Joseph Rosenstock and then to Viennese composer Paul August Csonka. Her third and last marriage was to Viennese psychiatrist Frederick Redlich which lasted nearly fifty years. Redlich was notably the Dean of the Yale University School of Medicine.

It is native to the tropical western Atlantic Ocean where it is found growing on mangrove roots on the Belize Barrier Reef. Description A colony of Perophora regina consists of a mat of slender, branching stolons, with short- stalked zooids growing at intervals. The zooids are so crowded together in mature colonies that the surface of the colony appears smooth. The zooids are long and on each there is a yellow neural gland between the siphons with a distinctive white spot on either side of this. Like Perophora viridis, the zooids have four rows of stigmata and the muscles in the mantle wall are predominantly longitudinal. This tunicate broods its embryos in a pouch at the lower right side of the atrium. Distribution and habitat Perophora regina is found in scattered locations on the Belize Barrier Reef where it is found growing profusely on mangrove roots in fast moving water. It is particularly common on the free ends of dangling Rhizophora roots where it may completely cover lengths of at the tip. It sometimes grows loosely over the surface of sponges such as Haliclona. It does not seem to be tolerant of wide variations in salinity and temperature.

Elkind's theory on adolescent egocentrism is drawn from Piaget's theory on cognitive developmental stages, which argues that formal operations enable adolescents to construct imaginary situations and abstract thinking. Accordingly, adolescents are able to conceptualize their own thoughts and conceive of others perception of their self-image. However, Elkind pointed out that adolescents tend to focus mostly on their own perceptions ‚Äì especially on their behaviors and appearance ‚Äì because of the \\"physiological metamorphosis\\" they experience during this period. This leads to adolescents' belief that society is just as attentive to their actions and semblance as they are of themselves. According to Elkind, adolescent egocentrism results in two consequential mental constructions, namely imaginary audience and personal fable. Mental constructions=Imaginary audience Elkind used the term imaginary audience to describe the phenomenon that an adolescent anticipates the reactions of other people to them in actual or impending social situations. Elkind argued that this kind of anticipation could be explained by the adolescent's preoccupation that others are as admiring or as critical of them as they are of themself. As a result, an audience is created, as the adolescent believes that they will be the focus of attention. However, more often than not the audience is imaginary because in actual social situations always being the focus of public attention is not usually the case. Elkind believed that the construction of imaginary audiences would partially account for a wide variety of typical adolescent behaviors and experiences; and imaginary audiences played a role in the self-consciousness that emerges in early adolescence. However, since the audience is usually the adolescent's own construction, it is privy to their own knowledge of themself. According to Elkind, the notion of imaginary audience helps to explain why adolescents usually seek privacy and feel reluctant to reveal themselves ‚Äì it is a reaction to the feeling that one is constantly under the critical scrutiny of others. Personal fable Elkind addressed that adolescents have a complex set of beliefs that their own feelings are unique and they are special and immortal. He used the term Personal fable to describe this notion, which is the complement of the construction of imaginary audience. Since an adolescent usually fails to differentiate their focus on their own perceptions and that of others, they tend to believe that they are of great importance to those around them (the imaginary audience), and consequently come to regard their feelings as something special and unique. This belief of personal uniqueness and invincibility contributes to an illusion that they are above the rules, disciplines and laws that apply to other people; isolation can be a way to show individuality in this mindset. Due to the existence of personal fable at some point, adolescents tend to substitute the roles of an idol, a hero or even a god with their own image. Passing Elkind believed that adolescent egocentrism was a temporary phenomenon that will gradually diminish as adolescents grow older. The reason of this, Elkind argued, was because after entering the formal operational stage, no new mental systems would develop. Therefore, the mental structures formed during adolescence would continue to function for the rest of the life span. Accordingly, the two mental constructions that result from egocentrism, imaginary audience and personal fable, will gradually be overcome and disappear as formal operations become mature and stable. Passing of imaginary audience The imaginary audience, Elkind said, could be regarded as \\"a series of hypotheses\\" that an adolescent \\"tests against reality\\". Because the imaginary audience is usually constructed based on an adolescent's attention on his own perception, it will be gradually modified through communicating and reacting with real audiences. Eventually, adolescents will be able to recognize the difference between his own preoccupations and concerns of others. Passing of personal fable As to the passing of personal fable, Elkind's idea was drawn from Erikson's (1959) stages of psychosocial development. An establishment of what Erikson called \\"intimacy\\" could account for the elimination of personal fable, because during the process of establishing \\"intimacy\\", adolescents have to constantly adjust their imaginary audiences to the real ones. As a result, adolescents are able to see themselves in a more realistic way and to establish meaningful interpersonal relationships. Discussions A lot of research has examined different dimensions of Elkind's concept of adolescent egocentrism, however, the findings have not well supported the concept. According to this research, the manifestation of adolescent egocentrism is not a normative developmental phenomenon that occurs only during adolescence, but varies across different contexts. Main discussions from current literature focus on three aspects: whether adolescent egocentrism is age-related; whether adolescent egocentrism has association with formal operations; whether adolescent egocentrism weigh equally across genders. Not being age-related In his 1967 work, Elkind claimed that adolescent egocentrism emerges during early adolescence (age 11‚Äì12) and gradually dissipates throughout middle and late adolescence. However, some findings from later studies indicate that this statement is not necessarily to be accurate. In 1986, Lapsley and his colleagues conducted two studies to examine the theoretical assumptions brought up by Elkind. In their first study they collected data from a sample that included 45 sixth graders, 39 eighth graders, 50 tenth graders and 49 twelfth graders. They used the Adolescent Egocentrism Scale (AES) developed by Enright et al. (1979, 1980) and paper-and-pencil battery of formal operations tasks developed by Lunzer (1965) as measuring instruments to examine the correlation between adolescent egocentrism and formal operational thought. If Elkind's assumption were right, the correlation was supposed to change from positive to negative as the grade increased and the magnitude of the correlation should decrease with age. The results of the study obtained only significant negative correlation in late adolescence and non-significant change in the magnitude of the correlation. The results didn't support the Elkind's claim that adolescent egocentrism emerges in early adolescence and decreases linearly throughout middle and late adolescence. In other words, adolescents aged 11 or 12 could experience adolescent egocentrism of the same magnitude as those aged 15 or 16 do. Another study by Frankenberger (2000) also provides evidence that adolescent egocentrism is not age-related. In this study, a survey was conducted for data collection from 223 adolescents and 131 adults. The survey contained measures of three aspects: adolescent egocentrism, self-consciousness, and interpersonal reactivity. The result revealed that scores of egocentrism were not, on average, significantly different between adolescents and young adults (19-30), which indicates that egocentrism in adolescence may continue into adulthood. Little association with formal operations An important theoretical assumption in Elkind's theory is that the emergence of adolescence egocentrism is a result of the development of formal operational thoughts. Nevertheless, some studies had findings that were contrast to Elkind's position. Lapsley and his colleagues conducted two studies to examine the theoretical assumptions in 1986. In the second study, they analyzed the data obtained from two samples: a sample of 7th-, 9th-and 11th-graders and another sample of college undergraduate students. They used Adolescent Egocentrism Scale (AES) (Enright et al., 1979, 1980), Lunzer (1965) formal operations measure and Imaginary Audience Scale (IAS) (Elkind & Bowen, 1979) as the instruments. The result of a grade-by-grade analysis of inter-correlations between adolescence egocentrism and formal operational thoughts showed modest to non-significant differences among all the measures, which implies that there is little association between adolescent egocentrism and formal operations. Some more recent studies got similar findings. Heather et al. (1993) found that formal operations were not an effective indicator of both imaginary audience and personal fable. Galanaki (2012) performed a research to investigate the association of adolescent egocentrism with age, gender, pubertal development and formal operational thoughts. Gender differences A considerable amount of studies have found gender differences in egocentrism (Smetana, J.G.&VillaLobos; M., 2010). Kimberly A Schonert-Reichl's (1994) study on the relationship between depressive symptomatology and adolescent egocentrism recruited 62 adolescents (30 males, 32 females) aged from 12 to 17. The study used Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale (RADS), Imaginary Audience Scale (IAS) and the New Personal Fable Scale (NPFS) as measuring tools. The results revealed significantly higher scores obtained by females compared with males in the Transient Self subscale in IAS. Transient Self, as defined by Elkind and Bowen in 1979, refers to impermanent image of self that is mainly relative to one-time behaviors and temporary appearance. Thus, adolescent females have a higher tendency to consider themselves to be different from others, and tend to be more self-conscious in situations that involve momentary embarrassments (e.g. going to a party with a bad haircut), than their male peers. Another study conducted by Goossens and Beyers (1992) using similar measuring instruments found that boys have stronger beliefs that they are unique, invulnerable and sometimes omnipotent, which are typical characteristics of personal fable.

Kemsley Paper Mill Sittingbourne Paper Mill Railways in the Sittingbourne and Kemsley area Paper manufacture started in Sittingbourne in 1708, when Peter Archer was recorded as a paper-maker. Sittingbourne Paper Mill existed from circa 1769, which by 1820 had grown and was owned by Edward Smith. After newspaper editor turned publisher Edward Lloyd bought the factory in 1863, it burnt down that August. Covering paper production from his London sites with longer shift production, Lloyd had the Sittingbourne paper mill rebuilt in 1863, but closer to the new railway to enable easier shipping of product to his newspaper presses in Bow, East London. After purchasing the Daily Chronicle in 1876, Lloyd installed new machinery capable of producing of paper per minute, and handed over management of the site to his youngest son, Frederick. By 1882, the transfer of paper-making from London to Sittingbourne was complete, enabled by using esparto grass imported from Algeria and Southern Spain via the creek port as a replacement for expensive cotton rag; the output supplied newsprint to his presses in Bow, East London. The site's production capability was expanded by converting the mill to steam power, and, after the death of his father in 1889, eldest son Frank introduced a horse-drawn tramway to carry materials from a new wharf at Milton Creek to the mill. As the mill expanded and silt built up in Milton Creek, in 1904 the tramway was converted into a narrow gauge railway, to allow both ships and barges to offload pulp product at Ridham, for onward transport to the mill. On what is now known as the Sittingbourne and Kemsley Light Railway, the first of three steam locomotives came into operation in 1906, all being 0-4-2 Brazil type tank engines, sourced from Kerr Stuart. In 1910, United Newspapers was created to buy out Lloyd‚Äôs newspapers, separating it from the paper-making side which continued as Edward Lloyd Ltd. By 1912, the resultant investment made the Sittingbourne Paper Mill the largest producer of newsprint in the world, with 1200 employees using 17 machines to make over 2000 tonnes per week and supply the demands of Fleet Street. New Kemsley Paper Mill Following a shortage of pulp in the early 1920s, from 1924 Frank developed a new mill at Kemsley, together with a model village for its employees - this became the present-day Kemsley village. After his death in 1936, the renamed Lloyd Group was taken over by Sir William Berry, who formed the Bowater-Lloyd Group. After both plants were acquired by Finnish based paper company Metsa Serla in 1998, the decision was made to close the Sittingbourne Mill in October 2006, with the last reel being produced on 23 January 2007. Present Today, the Sittingbourne site has been redeveloped, whilst the Kemsley mill is owned by DS Smith plc. With an annual production capacity of around 800,000 tonnes, it is the second biggest recovered fibre-based paper operation in Europe. Presently the plant produces K-Light testliner in white and brown, dual purpose liner/fluting, standard fluting and plasterboard liners.

As a two-year-old in 1997 she was one of the leading fillies of her generation in Ireland winning two of her four races including the Moyglare Stud Stakes. In the following season she became rather temperamental and ran poorly in the 1000 Guineas and the Oaks Stakes, but produced her best form to win the Irish 1,000 Guineas. She retired after winning three of her nine races and had some success as a broodmare. Background Tarascon was a bay mare bred in Ireland by Barronstown Stud, Ron Con Ltd and Mrs T Stack. She was one of the best horses sired by Tirol, an Irish-bred, British-trained stallion who won the 2000 Guineas and the Irish 2,000 Guineas in 1990. Her dam Breyani, won three minor races and also produced Mister Monet, whose wins included the Prix Guillaume d'Ornano and the Rose of Lancaster Stakes. Throughout her racing career, Tarascon was owned by Jane Rowlinson and trained at Golden, County Tipperary by Tommy Stack. Racing career=1997: two-year-old season As a two-year-old, Tarascon was ridden in all of her races by Pat Smullen. She made her racecourse debut in a six furlong maiden race at the Curragh on 13 July when she finished third of the eight runners, making good progress in the closing stages. Thirteen days later she reappeared in a race over seven furlongs at the same course and started 4/1 second favourite in a field of eight. She moved up on the outside with a quarter of a mile left to run and won by half a length from the favourite Saratoga Springs a colt trained by Aidan O'Brien. Tarascon was then moved up sharply in class for the Group One Phoenix Stakes over six furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse in which she was again matched against colts. She tracked the leaders but was unable to make any significant progress in the closing stages and finished fifth behind the British-trained colt Princely Heir. On 7 September, the filly returned to competing against her own sex in the Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes at the Curragh. Smullen ettled the filly behind the leaders before moving up into second place with a quarter of a mile left to run. In the final strides she overtook the leader Heed My Warning and won by a head at odds of 7/1, with the future Epsom Oaks winner Shahtoush in third. Tarascon did not race again in 1997, but the value of her form was boosted when Saratoga Springs won the Group One Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster Racecourse in October. 1998: three-year-old season Tarascon's first appearance of her second season was the classic 1000 Guineas over the Rowley mile course at Newmarket Racecourse on 3 May. Her chances were somewhat compromised as she became frightened when being unloaded from the plane to England at Stansted Airport and sustained a minor leg injury. The filly became agitated in the starting stalls at Newmarket and ran very poorly, finishing a distant last of the sixteen runners behind Cape Verdi. After this race Jamie Spencer, then a seventeen-year-old apprentice jockey, replaced Smullen as the filly's regular jockey. Three weeks after her defeat at Newmarket, Tarascon started at odds of 12/1 for the Irish 1000 Guineas at the Curragh where she again gave trouble at the start, with four stalls handlers required to force her into the stalls. Spencer settled the filly behind the leaders before switching to the outside with two and a half furlongs left to run. She was still in fifth place entering the final furlong but stayed on strongly in the closing stages to take the lead in the final strides and win by a neck from Kitza, with the Saeed bin Suroor-trained favourite La Nuite Rose two lengths back in third. After the race, Stack revealed that he had deliberately downplayed the significance of the event to the young jockey, telling him that it was \\"just an ordinary race and if she runs bad, there is no panic, there isn't any pressure\\". Tarascon was sent back to England and moved up in distance to contest the Epsom Oaks over one and a half miles on 5 June. She was held up by Spencer in the early stages but began to struggle with two furlong to run and weakened in the closing stages to finish sixth of the eight runners, fourteen lengths behind the winner Shahtoush. Tarascon was brought back to a mile for the Group One Sussex Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse on 29 July, but, racing against colts and older horses, she made no impression and finished seventh of the ten runners behind Among Men. The filly's final start was the Irish Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Leopardstown on 12 September. She made little impact in a strong field, finishing fifth behind Swain, Alborada, Xaar and One So Wonderful. Breeding career Tarascon was retired from racing to become a broodmare. She has produced at least eight foals and five winners: *Beucaire, (bay filly, foaled in 2000, sired by Entrepreneur) won two races *Perfecto, (bay filly, 2001, by Peintre Celebre) won one race *Mayano Sophia, (filly, 2004, by Rock of Gibraltar) won two races *Taras Wells (filly, 2005, by Sadler's Wells) *Estephe, (bay filly, 2006, by Sadler's Wells) won one race *High Award, (bay colt 2008, by Holy Roman Emperor) won two races including the Woodcote Stakes *Skyphos (bay colt 2009, by Galileo) unplaced in only race *Meiner Altero (bay colt 2011, by Holy Roman Emperor) PedigreeReferences Category:1995 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in Ireland Category:Thoroughbred family 13-e Category:Irish Classic Race winners ","title":"Tarascon (horse)"},{"id":"41842046","text":"Fire-Eater () is a 1998 Finnish film directed and written by Pirjo Honkasalo.

It is unusual in being a nitrate complex of a light element. Related substances By substituting boron for aluminium tetranitratoborates result. Aluminium can coordinate more nitrates resulting in pentanitratoaluminates and hexanitratoaluminates. By replacing nitrate with perchlorate, the tetraperchloratoaluminate ion results. Formation When hydrated aluminium nitrate reacts with dinitrogen pentoxide it forms a nitronium salt: [NO2]+[Al(NO3)4]‚àí. A way to make a tetranitratoaluminate salt of a cation is to treat the chloride of the cation and aluminium chloride with liquid dinitrogen tetroxide pure or dissolved in nitromethane. The reaction is started a liquid nitrogen temperatures and then warmed up. Dark red nitrosyl chloride is formed as a byproduct. The byproducts and solvents can then be evaporated. The tetramethylammonium salt can form this way. Properties The tetranitratoaluminate group has two bidentate nitrate groups attached in a square around the aluminium, and with two other monodentate nitrates attached via one oxygen only, perpendicular, up and down from the square. Tetranitratoaluminate salts are not completely stable and can decompose to the nitrates and aluminium oxy-nitrates. When nitronium tetranitratoaluminate is sublimed it can form anhydrous aluminium nitrate. Nitronium tetranitratoaluminate dissolved in a nitric acid and dinitrogen pentoxide mixture yields the hexanitratoaluminate complex. In water is it converted to the hexaaqua complex with six water molecules replacing the nitrate groups. Examples Tetraethyl ammonium tetranitratoaluminate along with nitronium tetranitratoaluminate were the first to be discovered. 1-Ethyl-4,5-dimethyl- tetrazolium tetranitratoaluminate is an oxygen balanced ionic liquid, This liquid salt is stable when moisture is excluded. It is soluble in methyl nitrate. It solidifies to a glass at -46¬∞, starts to slowly decompose at 75¬∞, and inflames, without oxygen required, around 200¬∞. When it burns it produces alumina, nitrogen, water and carbon monoxide. It is being proposed as a rocket propellant, because it has better performance than hydrazine. Rubidium and Caesium also form salts. Tetramethyl ammonium tetranitratoaluminate forms monoclinic crystals with a=12.195√Ö, b=9.639√Ö c=12.908√Ö, Œ±=90¬∞ Œ≤=110.41¬∞ Œ≥=90¬∞ formula weight 349.17 formulas per unit cell= 4 Unit cell volume is 1422√Ö3 calculated density 1.631 g/cm3.

Google Inc., No. 3:12-cv-04177 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 16, 2012), is a case in which the United States District Court for the Northern District of California approved a stipulated order for a permanent injunction and a $22.5 million civil penalty judgment, the largest civil penalty the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has ever won in history. The FTC and Google Inc. consented to the entry of the stipulated order to resolve the dispute which arose from Google's violation of its privacy policy. In this case, the FTC found Google liable for misrepresenting \\"privacy assurances to users of Apple's Safari Internet browser\\". It was reached after the FTC considered that through the placement of advertising tracking cookies in the Safari web browser, and while serving targeted advertisements, Google violated the 2011 FTC's administrative order issued in FTC v. Google Inc. 2011 FTC administrative order In February 2011 the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) filed a complaint before the FTC requesting an investigation against Google Inc. EPIC alleged that during the launching of its Google Buzz social network, Google's businesses practices violated the privacy interests of its consumers. EPIC specified that's its \\"...complaint concerns an attempt by Google, Inc., the provider of a widely used email service to convert the private, personal information of Gmail subscribers into public information for the company's social network service Google Buzz‚Ä¶\\" In October 2011, the FTC initiated an administrative proceeding against Google, charging that it had violated the FTC Act. The FTC asserted that Google, while launching its social networking tool, Google Buzz, had designed business practices which unfairly affected \\"commerce\\" In the FTC's view, Google violated its privacy promises to its customers since it \\"misrepresented to users of its Gmail email service that: (1) Google would not use their information for any purpose other than to provide that email service; (2) users would not be automatically enrolled in the Buzz network; and (3) users could control what information would be public on their Buzz profiles.\\" In the complaint, the FTC considered that Google launched the social network Google Buzz through its Gmail web-based email product. The FTC alleged that the tools to decline or leave the social network were ineffective. Even more, in those cases where users declined to be part of the social network, they were nonetheless \\"enrolled in certain features of the Google Buzz social network. For those Gmail users who clicked on \\"Sweet!,\\" the FTC alleged that they were not adequately informed that the identity of the individuals they emailed most frequently would be made public by default. Google also offered a \\"Turn Off Buzz\\" option that did not fully remove the user from the social network.\\" As stated in the complaint, the FTC concluded that \\"‚Ä¶the setup process for Gmail users who enrolled in Buzz did not adequately communicate that certain previously private information would be shared publicly by default. Further, the controls that would allow the user to change the defaults were confusing and difficult to find\\" and that \\"certain personal information of Gmail users was shared without consumers' permission through the Google Buzz social network.\\" In late 2011, the FTC and Google agreed to a settlement order, wherein Google was to implement a privacy program intended to efficiently protect consumer data. Additionally Google was to subject itself to independent privacy audits for the next 20 years. According to the settlement, Google agreed that it will not, among other things, misrepresent in any manner, expressly or by implication, \\"the extent to which respondent maintains and protects the privacy and confidentiality of any covered information, including but not limited to, misrepresentations related to: (1) the purpose for which it collects and uses covered information, and (2) the extent to which consumers may exercise control over the collection, use, or disclosure of covered information.\\" as well as the extent to which Google participated in any U.S.-EU Safe Harbor The consent order was served on Google on October 28, 2011. It is known to be the first decision of its kind, requiring a company to implement a comprehensive privacy program. The order prevented the company \\"from future privacy misrepresentations, requires it to implement a comprehensive privacy program, and calls for regular, independent privacy audits for the next twenty years.\\" Google-Safari case On August 8, 2012 the United States filed a complaint (\\"Safari complaint\\") against Google Inc., alleging that it had violated the consent order which it had entered into with the FTC, (to settle the above- mentioned Google Buzz case). The government's complaint stems from a page on Google's website that tells Safari browser users \\"that Safari's default operation is to deny what are called third-party cookies, which can be used to track users. At the time they wrote it, this statement was true, but Apple later changed the behavior of Safari to allow third-party cookies from sites that had previously served cookies to the user. The Safari complaint stated that Google used the \\"DoubleClick Advertising Cookie\\" to \\"collect information and serve targeted advertisement services to users who visit Google websites, Google partner websites, and websites that use Google's advertising services.\\" As part of Google's advertising privacy controls, Google offered to its users the possibility of \\"opting out\\" from the delivery of targeted advertising. As was stated in the Safari complaint, \\"...a user may opt out of targeted advertising either by clicking a button on Google's Ads Preferences webpage (\\"opt-out button\\") or by downloading Google's \\"advertising cookie opt-out plug in,\\" and both of the previous options would place an \\"opt-out cookie\\" on the user's browser. The \\"opt-out cookie\\" technology (also referred as the \\"DoubleClick opt-out cookie\\") was available to users of only three browsers: Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Google Chrome. Since the \\"opting-out\\" plug in was not available for the Safari browser, Google assured Safari's users that they need not take any action \\"to be opted out of DoubleClick targeted advertisements\\". According to Google's representation, Safari blocked by default (although allowed in certain exceptional circumstances) third-party cookies, and said blocking was enough to prevent Google from placing tracking cookies or serve targeted advertisements; however even when Safari users had activated the default privacy settings, they received tracking cookies and targeted advertisements. The government alleged that \\"despite its representations to Safari users, Google overrode the Safari default browser setting and placed the DoubleClick Advertising Cookie on Safari browsers.\\" Google's conduct overrode Safari software that blocked cookies, by sending code that was invisible to the user to communicate with that user's Safari browser anytime that a Safari user visited a \\"Google website, Google partner website, or website that used Google's advertising services.\\" This allowed Google to store, collect and transmit the users information. In view of Google's conduct, the complaint addressed five relevant causes of action: (i) Collecting covered information, (ii) Serving targeted advertisements, (iii) Misrepresenting NAI Code compliance, (iv) Civil penalties and (v) Prayer for relief. Furthermore, the government alleged that Google's conduct violated the October 2011 (Google Buzz) order. Court's opinion The government filed a Proposed Stipulated Order for Permanent Injunction and Civil Penalty Judgment (\\"Proposed Order\\") which was approved by the District Court for the Northern District of California on November 16, 2012. In the Proposed Order, the parties agreed that (i) Google denies any guilt regarding its failure to abide by the FTC v. Google Inc settlement order and, (ii) Google agreed to: (a) pay a civil penalty of $22.5 million, (b) maintain until February 15, 2014 a system that had to delete cookies from Safari browser users and (c) file a report with the FTC within 20 days of February 15, 2014 which would document that Google had complied with the remediation component of the order. In reaction to the Proposed Order, Consumer Watchdog objected to the Proposed Order \\"...claiming that the injunction was inadequate, the civil penalty was too small, and Google should be forced to admit liability.\\" Consumer Watchdog claimed that the injunction will be in effect for too short of a duration and that the Order gives Google the ability to resume its unauthorized practices after February 15, 2014. The Court held that the Proposed Order was the result of \\"good faith, arms-length negotiations,\\" that the Proposed Order is presumed to be fair and reasonable, and thus the objecting party has the burden of disproving this presumption. Judge Susan Illston found that Consumer Watchdog's objections were insufficient to satisfy this burden. Specifically, Judge Illston found that a longer injunction was unnecessary as Google was still legally obligated to work under the terms specified in its previous consent order with the FTC (Google Buzz).\\" Impact This case had a great impact on the technology industry as it showed the range of enforceability with regard to FTC consent orders. It was not just the second case against the same company in less than twelve months, but it was also the first case in which the FTC was able to fine a private company. Fran√ßoise Gilbert, at Bloomberg, stated that \\"this Google II action is not just another FTC case under section 5 of the FTC Act. It is unique in many respects. The case is second one against Google in less than 12 months. The FTC does not have the authority to fine a company under Section 5 of the FTC Act, but it can fine a company that violates a consent order with the commission. The FTC took that power into account and built on its prior case against the company (Google I). The arguments are in some respects different than in other similar cases addressing consumer privacy, and the complaint (Google II Complaint) and proposed order provide significant insight into the reasoning of the FTC, which is very valuable information for companies that collect or use personal information and prefer to reduce the risk of government action.\\" Additionally, the case also highlighted the impact that this case may have caused in the international community: \\"the FTC action against the world's most popular search engine provides the U.S. government with an opportunity to show the rest of the world, and especially the European Union and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation member economies, that it cares about privacy and is serious about enforcement. In its press release, the FTC announced that this settlement was \\"part of the FTC's ongoing efforts to ensure that companies live up to the privacy promises that they make to consumers.\\" External links * \\"Privacy activists can sue Google in UK over Safari tracking, court decides\\" * \\"Google To Get Grilling Before UK Courts for Covert Safari Browser Tracking\\" * \\"Judges Approve Google's $22.5 Million Settlement With FTC for Safari Privacy Violation\\"  References  Category:2012 in United States case law Category:United States Internet case law Category:United States District Court for the Northern District of California cases ","title":"United States v.
