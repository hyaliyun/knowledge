After that she hosted various art and music-programs on television and ended up with her own TV show, Jansen & Co. Wishing to devote more time to singing and the theatre, she said goodbye to TV and produced a number of music-theatre productions. She has made a range of programs, such as a Pyjama night in the Concertgebouw, an Opera party for children in Vredenburg, and directed theatre shows for pop groups including Room Eleven, Sensual and Giovanca. Over the past few years she has been busy mainly creating music programs that bridge different cultures. She was, for instance, co-responsible for the theatre hit Female Factory, in which 13 female top stars from 10 different countries were presented simultaneously, a show that was also seen in Moscow and Madrid, following a week when the Carr√© Theatre was completely sold out. She produced the series Wereldwijven, which featured a Dutch singer with a singer from a different continent. She produced the show She Got Game (three versions!) with among others , , , Izaline Callister, Ricky Koole and ), which attracted capacity crowds throughout the country over four seasons. And she created the multi-cultural shows Made in Holland, in response to 11 September, held in Carr√©, and in which 45 artists from 22 different cultures took over the space for one week. She sang at the wedding of Prince Willem-Alexander and Princess Maxima in the Arena in Amsterdam, and she was responsible for the music- production of Faranani, a homage to Nelson Mandela from the Koninklijk Theater Carr√© in 2002, which was broadcast live in dozens of countries. She has worked with many international musicians from the world music scene over the past few years, including: Busi Mhlongo, Toumani Diabate, Rosi Flores, Angelique Kidjo, , Sibongile Khumalo, Mohammud Ahmed, Annie Grace, Karin Polwart, , Kine Lam and Tshala Muana. She performed with Youssou Ndour, singing his worldwide hit \\"7 Seconds\\" on the IDFA festival in Amsterdam. She was honoured by Queen Beatrix as a Companion of the Order of Orange-Nassau in 2006, for her contribution to world music and for empowering women in music. She directed three large African productions: The African Mamas in 2005, Daughters of Africa in 2010 (12 young African women from eight African countries) and in 2013 The African Mamas sing Mama Africa, a tribute to Africa‚Äôs most famous singer, the late Miriam Makeba. Recurring themes throughout her career are social issues and women‚Äôs rights, especially in African countries. In Senegal she directed a play that was a protest against Senegalese fisheries law. Leoni Jansen (2013) Leoni has a number of solo CDs to her name: Three Magic Little Words, Heart Strings & Loose Ends, Second Wind with, among others, The African Mamas, Chris Chameleon and , and \\"Third Road\\". Her album Nina is a joint project with Les Fr√®res Guisse from Senegal, and last year she made the album Santiago, with renowned Flamenco guitarist Eric Vaarzon Morel, with which she toured the Dutch theaters. Her latest album Storyteller contains songs from the theatre production Geheim (secret), in which she traces the war history of her father, who fought on the German side in World War II. She also wrote a book about this, which was well received by literary critics.

Ro.57bis Ro.57bis Ro.57bis The IMAM Ro.57 was an Italian twin-engined, single-seat monoplane fighter of the Regia Aeronautica. Based on a 1939 design by Giovanni Galasso the aircraft did not enter production until 1943. Two hundred aircraft were ordered, but only 50‚Äì75 were produced in two versions, one flown as an interceptor, the other in the role of a ground attack aircraft.  Design and development  The Ro.57 was preceded by another twin engine fighter design, the Ro.53, which never entered production. The Ro.57 consisted of an all-metal, semi-monocoque fuselage with a steel skeleton and Duralumin structure. The wings were also Duralumin. It was powered by two Fiat A.74 radial engines giving a maximum speed of 516 km/h, which in 1939 was faster than that of the main Italian fighter, the Macchi C.200 (504 km/h). After testing at Guidonia it was proposed by IMAM for use as a dive bomber. This transformation, which involved the addition of dive brakes, provision for 500 kg bombs and an improved forward firing armament (adding two 20 mm cannon), took time and delayed production. The resulting aircraft was designated the Ro.57bis. Performance dropped to 457 km/h maximum speed and to 350 km/h at cruise speed. The Ro.57bis was ordered into production in 1942 and entered service with the 97¬∞ Gruppo in 1943. About 50‚Äì60 aircraft were delivered. It is said that the Ro.57 could have been the long range interceptor that Italy lacked throughout the war. It proved to be too costly for the limited weapons it carried and it never was assigned a clear role. A better-armed version with more powerful engines was developed as the Ro.58.

Features The ward covers an irregularly shaped area, sometimes likened to a tuning fork, bounded on the east by the wards of Queenhithe and Bread Street; the ward of Farringdon Without to the north and west; the ward of Farringdon Within to the north; and by the River Thames to the south. Major landmarks within the ward include Blackfriars Bridge (the full span of which falls within the City and this ward), the naval establishment HMS President, and St Paul's Cathedral.

History The program was first established in 1978 as a toll free telephone service at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center to assist medical professionals with the recognition and management of pesticide poisonings. The service was later expanded to the general public. In the mid 1980s the NPIC moved to Texas Tech University and became the National Pesticide Telecommunications Network.

Incident Reporting  The National Pesticide Information Center does not have regulatory authority in relation to pesticides. Pesticide regulatory agencies in many states are delegated primary enforcement responsibilities for pesticide violations by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. However, in addition to being reported to state regulators, pesticide incidents involving people, pets, wildlife (including bees), or the environment can be reported to the NPIC. Incident reports collected by the NPIC, which exclude personally identifiable information, are provided to the U.S. EPA through scheduled reporting and by request from U.S. EPA and partner agencies.

Blending elements of the survival thriller and the slasher film, the story follows a group of campers in the Northern California wilderness who are forced to fight for their lives against a backwoods, feral killer hunting them as prey. The film was released internationally under the alternate titles Carnivore and Campsite Massacre. The film's genesis began with executive producer Samuel Z. Arkoff, who hoped to capitalize on the success of such films as Halloween (1978) and Friday the 13th (1980). Arkoff commissioned Joe Roth to produce the film, after which a screenplay was developed by three writers, including Ronald Shusett. Principal photography took place in the fall of 1981, primarily in the Redwood Forests of Northern California, as well in Oregon, under the working title Bump in the Night. Though completed in 1981, The Final Terror was shelved for two years as a result of the filmmakers failing to find a distributor. It was eventually released on October 28, 1983 to capitalize on the rising fame of it stars Ward, Hannah, and Zmed. Critical reaction to the film was mixed, with some praising it for its believability, while others admonished it for its incorporation of overlapping dialogue and art film elements. Numerous critics drew comparisons to Deliverance (1972) due to the film's survivalist elements, as well as to its slasher contemporary Friday the 13th. In the intervening years, the film has developed a small cult following. Plot A young couple named Jim and Lori loses control of their motorbike while riding in a forest. With Jim hurt, Lori finds no help and returns, only to find Jim dead hanging from a tree before she is killed by a trap. Weeks later, a group of campers consisting of Dennis, Margaret, Wendy, Marco, Nathaniel, Boone, Eggar, Vanessa, Mike, and Melanie, arrive at the forest. The group makes a clearing and spend the night around a bonfire telling a story about a young woman who was raped and became insane enough to flee into the forest. The next morning, the group discover that Marco and Eggar are missing. While the others search for them, Mike takes a swim with Melanie and later they have sex, during which Mike is stabbed to death by a camouflaged killer who then kidnaps Melanie. Nathaniel and Dennis find an abandoned cabin containing an old grave. Dennis enters the cabin and Nathaniel hears him scream, only for it to be a prank by Dennis trying to scare him. While searching the cabin for food and items, they find a severed wolf's head in a cabinet and are shaken before returning to the camp. That night, the killer appears near Margaret in her sleep and she hysterically tells the others what she saw. The campers also find Marco, who has returned to the camp. After Vanessa gets angry at the men for scaring the girls, she walks off alone to the outhouse; she screams when Mike's severed head falls onto her, and the group comes to her aid. The group spends one more night at the camp, and unsuccessfully search for Melanie who they assumed was still with Mike. In the morning they go to the cabin to look for the killer, unaware that he is down in the basement with a captured Melanie, and they flee with the rafts after finding a human hand jar. While rafting along the river, the body of Melanie is tossed onto the boat by the killer which causes panic among the group. Burying Melanie near the river, the group continues on to the end of the river and find their empty, broken-down bus. They spend the night there, but the killer attacks and gets inside the bus before the group escapes out the back door. Wendy gets separated and is slashed by the killer, where the group comes to her and gives her first aid. In the morning, the group gathers supplies and camouflages themselves. Dennis climbs one of the highest trees, where he sets a spiked log trap. Marco begins calling out for Eggar, who appears and begins to strangle Marco. The group attacks Eggar, believing he is the killer. While Dennis is watching the rest of the group fight, the killer murders him from behind and rises up to scream; it is revealed that Eggar's missing, feral mother is the killer. As she walks toward the group, she sets off the trap and is mortally wounded. The film ends with the group watching in horror as Eggar's mother hangs dead in the trap. CastThemes Film scholar John Kenneth Muir notes in his book Horror Films of the 1980s that The Final Terror exemplifies of a trend of slasher films boasting a \\"man-versus-nature\\" trope. Contextualizing it within the decade, Muir writes: \\"In the 1980s, Americans had more creature comforts, including Atari 2600s, VCRs, shopping malls, and less of a need to seek leisure outside in the woods... Ever since Jean Renoir's A Day in the Country (1936), cinema has played with the notion of nature as a foreign place... The Final Terror is no Renoir movie, yet (much like 1977's The Hills Have Eyes and, to a much lesser degree, 1983's The Prey), it explores the idea that wilderness is just that.\\" Production=Development After the success of such slasher films as Halloween (1978) and Friday the 13th (1980, executive producer Samuel Z. Arkoff pitched the idea of making a horror film in order to \\"make some money\\" to his friend and co-producer, Joe Roth. The project marked Arkoff's first major feature following his departure from American International Pictures. The original screenplay, which had the working title Bump in the Night, consisted of a sparse plot about \\"rich boys and girls going off into the woods and getting killed.\\" The screenplay was co-written by Ronald Shusett, who had previously co-written Alien (1979) with Dan O'Bannon. Casting Most of the cast of The Final Terror were inexperienced or new actors. Australian actress Rachel Ward was cast in the lead role of Margaret after Davis had seen a modeling portrait of her in Roth's office. Akosua Busia auditioned during an open casting call on Hollywood Boulevard, and was cast in the supporting role of Vanessa. Busia, the daughter of Ghana Prime Minister Kofi Abrefa Busia, was a childhood friend of Ward, who became acquainted with her while they were studying in London, and neither were aware the other had been cast in the same film until the first day of shooting. In the role of Wendy, Davis cast Daryl Hannah, who, similar to Ward, had little film experience at the time. Davis cast Joe Pantoliano in the role of Eggar after he entered the audition in character, impressing Davis with his commitment. Donna Pinder, who portrayed Mrs. Morgan, was producer Arkoff's daughter, who later married Roth. Filming The Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park was a central filming location Director Davis was recommended for the film by Shusett, who had been impressed by Davis's previous work. Davis was also hired by producer Joe Roth to serve as cinematographer, billed under pseudonym \\"Andreas Davidescu\\" to avoid problems with the union. Prior to shooting, Davis and producer Joe Roth scouted various locations, including the Mount St. Helens area in Washington. Principal photography of The Final Terror took place largely in the Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park and surrounding Crescent City, California in the late summer of 1981. The accompanying crew consisted of only four people. The majority of filming was completed by Davis, though the opening sequence featuring the anonymous couple being murdered was filmed by an editor prior to Davis's arrival to the set. Some of the establishing camp sequences were filmed at the California Conservation Corps camp in northern California. During filming, the cast and crew stayed in Crescent City and would enter through the border before filming all day in Oregon and also traveling along the Whitewater River. The filming conditions were difficult due to weather conditions, with frequent rain.Adrian Zmed (2014), Lewis Smith. Interview (Blu-Ray). Scream Factory. One evening during the shoot, locals gave the cast marijuana brownies, which resulted in some of them being admitted to the hospital.Lewis Smith (2014). Interview (Blu-Ray). Scream Factory. Upon driving in one of their cars, the crew had hit a Redwood tree and Smith cited their excuse was \\"someone putted the tree out on the street\\". According to Adrian Zmed, Davis shot an abundance of film, rolling the camera frequently; the scene with Zmed's character howling was done in estimated 15-20 takes. Zmed also mentioned that his difficult scene was when Eggar was strangling his character Marco, and the time he didn't know how to act in physical pain, so he asked stunt-woman Jeannie Epper to squeeze the rope harder, which helped. The cast performed the majority of their own stunts.Adrian Zmed (2014) Interview (Blu-Ray). Scream Factory. In the log-trap creation scene where Dennis Zorich was climbing up the tree, they used real tree-climbers helping them and used logging techniques. Release After production for the film was completed, the film was shelved for two years until 1983 as the production searched for a distributor. The film only had three deaths, so the beginning scene with the couple getting killed was filmed in order to have a higher chance of a distributor picking up the film. However, the scene was shot without the director's permission, so Roth had to pay a fee, some of it coming from Davis' small wedding at the time. The film was released theatrically in the United States on October 28, 1983. At the time of its release, several of the film's stars had garnered recognition for other acting roles, including Hannah, who had had a major role in Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982), Ward, who made a critically acclaimed appearance in the miniseries The Thorn Birds, and Zmed, who had been cast as a regular on the network series T. J. Hooker. Critical response The film received mixed reviews at the time of its release, with numerous critics drawing comparisons to Deliverance (1972) and Friday the 13th (1980), due to the film's slasher elements set against a survivalist narrative. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times noted that the film does not contain \\"much of a story,\\" though conceded that \\"Davis has managed to turn out a competent, though scarcely compelling, film with believable people. Although not for the faint of heart, The Final Terror avoids lingering morbidly over its bloodshed, and at least is not yet another exploitation of extreme violence against women.\\" Writing for The Baltimore Sun, Stephen Hunter faulted the film as it \\"never builds any real tension or energy, even within the limited confines of the genre... Although the kids... are handsome enough, they never develop any personalities.\\" Hunter did note, however, that the film's \\"production values are unusually high.\\" The Palm Beach Posts Kathryn Buxton praised the film's setting and \\"likewise scenic cast\\" but added: \\"After her throat is cut by the slasher, Ms. Hanna is sewn miraculously back together by Ms. Ward, and she is up and walking in no time. Like that scene there is little sense, or tension, in The Final Terror.\\" Terry Lawson of the Dayton Journal Herald criticized the film's plot for being derivative, adding that both Ward and Hannah \\"do their jobs, which is to look beautiful even when scared out of their makeup. The only real performance in the film is rendered by John Friedrich, who does a Robert De Niro imitation that is so blatantly bad that one can only hope he intended it as parody.\\" Mike Hughes in the Lansing State Journal, was also critical, writing: \\"Davis seems to think he's doing a Bergman drama. He fills Terror with overlapping dialogue, mumbled lines, meandering cameras. Unfortunately, this is no high- class drama... Despite the arty efforts, Final Terror emerges as a movie only James Watt could love. It shows forests aren't that much fun after all.\\" In their capsule review, the Shreveport Times deemed the film \\"another vehicle in the current horror genre with a newcomer cast and not much else.\\" On the internet review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 38% approval rating with an average rating of 3.9/10 based on 8 reviews. AllMovie gave a 2.5 rating, citing the film as \\"mediocre\\" and recommending \\"worth watching more for its cast than for its clich√©d story\\". Home media The film came into home video on VHS in the mid 1980s and later had a DVD release in the 2000s. In July 2014, Shout! Factory subsidiary Scream Factory released the film in a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack, which contains the R-rated version. Accordingly, the film had lost all of the original negative and inner-positive are all lost and Scream Factory went through six film prints lent by film collectors to deliver the best looking reels for the combo pack.

The concept stems from the idea that organisms that are actively selecting habitat must rely on environmental cues to help them identify high-quality habitat. If either the habitat quality or the cue changes so that one does not reliably indicate the other, organisms may be lured into poor-quality habitat.  Overview  Ecological traps are thought to occur when the attractiveness of a habitat increases disproportionately in relation to its value for survival and reproduction. The result is preference of falsely attractive habitat and a general avoidance of high-quality but less-attractive habitats. For example, Indigo buntings typically nest in shrubby habitat or broken forest transitions between closed canopy forest and open field. Human activity can create 'sharper', more abrupt forest edges and buntings prefer to nest along these edges. However, these artificial sharp forest edges also concentrate the movement of predators which predate their nests. In this way, Buntings prefer to nest in highly altered habitats where their nest success is lowest. While the demographic consequences of this type of maladaptive habitat selection behavior have been explored in the context of the sources and sinks, ecological traps are an inherently behavioral phenomenon of individuals. Despite being a behavioural mechanism, ecological traps can have far-reaching population consequences for species with large dispersal capabilities, such as the grizzly bear (Ursus arctos). The ecological trap concept was introduced in 1972 by Dwernychuk and Boag and the many studies that followed suggested that this trap phenomenon may be widespread because of anthropogenic habitat change. As a corollary, novel environments may represent fitness opportunities that are unrecognized by native species if high-quality habitats lack the appropriate cues to encourage settlement; these are known as perceptual traps. Theoretical and empirical studies have shown that errors made in judging habitat quality can lead to population declines or extinction. Such mismatches are not limited to habitat selection, but may occur in any behavioral context (e.g. predator avoidance, mate selection, navigation, foraging site selection, etc.). Ecological traps are thus a subset of the broader phenomena of evolutionary traps. As ecological trap theory developed, researchers have recognized that traps may operate on a variety of spatial and temporal scales which might also hinder their detection. For example, because a bird must select habitat on several scales (a habitat patch, an individual territory within that patch, as well as a nest site within the territory), traps may operate on any one of these scales. Similarly, traps may operate on a temporal scale so that an altered environment may appear to cause a trap in one stage of an organism's life, yet have positive effects on later life stages. As a result, there has been a great deal of uncertainty as to how common traps may be, despite widespread acceptance as a theoretical possibility. However, given the accelerated rate of ecological change driven by human land-use change, global warming, exotic species invasions, and changes in ecological communities resulting from species loss, ecological traps may be an increasing and highly underappreciated threat to biodiversity. A 2006 review of the literature on ecological traps provides guidelines for demonstrating the existence of an ecological trap. A study must show a preference for one habitat over another (or equal preference) and that individuals selecting the preferred habitat (or equally preferred habitat) have lower fitness (i.e., experience lower survival or reproductive success). Since the publication of that paper which found only a few well-documented examples of ecological traps, interest in ecological and evolutionary traps has grown very rapidly and new empirical examples are being published at an accelerating rate. There are now roughly 30 examples of ecological traps affecting a broad diversity of taxa including birds, mammals, arthropods, fish and reptiles. Because ecological and evolutionary traps are still very poorly understood phenomena, many questions about their proximate and ultimate causes as well as their ecological consequences remain unanswered. Are traps simply an inevitable consequence of the inability of evolution to anticipate novelty or react quickly to rapid environmental change? How common are traps? Do ecological traps necessarily lead to population declines or extinctions or is it possible that they may persist indefinitely? Under what ecological and evolutionary conditions should this occur? Are organisms with certain characteristics predisposed to being \\"trapped\\"? Is rapid environmental change necessary to trigger traps? Can global warming, pollution or exotic invasive species create traps? Embracing genetic and phylogenetic approaches may provide more robust answers to the above questions as well as providing deeper insight into the proximate and ultimate basis for maladaptation in general. Because ecological and evolutionary traps are predicted to add in concert with other sources of population decline, traps are an important research priority for conservation scientists. Given the rapid current rate of global environmental change, traps may be far more common than it is realized and it will be important to examine the proximate and ultimate causes of traps if management is to prevent or eliminate traps in the future. Polarized light pollution Polarized light pollution is perhaps the most compelling and well-documented cue triggering ecological traps.Horvath et al., in press as of Jan, 2013 Orientation to polarized sources of light is the most important mechanism that guides at least 300 species of dragonflies, mayflies, caddisflies, tabanid flies, diving beetles, water bugs, and other aquatic insects in their search for the water bodies they require for suitable feeding/breeding habitat and oviposition sites (Schwind 1991; Horv√°th and Kriska 2008). Because of their strong linear polarization signature, artificial polarizing surfaces (e.g., asphalt, gravestones, cars, plastic sheeting, oil pools, windows) are commonly mistaken for bodies of water (Horv√°th and Zeil 1996; Kriska et al. 1998, 2006a, 2007, 2008; Horv√°th et al. 2007, 2008). Light reflected by these surfaces is often more highly polarized than that of light reflected by water, and artificial polarizers can be even more attractive to polarotactic aquatic insects than a water body (Horv√°th and Zeil 1996; Horv√°th et al. 1998; Kriska et al. 1998) and appear as exaggerated water surfaces acting as supernormal optical stimuli. Consequently, dragonflies, mayflies, caddisflies, and other water- seeking species actually prefer to mate, settle, swarm, and oviposit upon these surfaces than on available water bodies.

The key aspect of a cigar case is its portability, and ease of carrying cigars in jacket pockets etc. Over the years cigar cases have evolved from a simple wooden carrier to a luxurious tote, fully cedar lined to retain the humidity of cigars. The leather cigar case has evolved over the past 20 years, from a soft leather pouch to a hard-leather safe. Some provided a slot for a cutter.  Types of cigar cases  Based on construction and accessibility cigar cases are often categorised as follows: Spanish cedar lined cases As the name suggests, these have an lining made of Spanish cedar. These are usually stronger cases, and can withstand impact without damaging the cigars. These cases have two parts; top and bottom. Depending upon construction, one part slides onto the other. The degree of sliding can be adjusted to fit the length of the cigar. Telescopic cigar cases These cases have grooves to fit the cigars. These are usually sliding cases, as the top can be adjusted to the bottom in a telescoping fashion. Usually, these cases do not have a cedar lining and are of relatively soft construction. The shell of the case is usually leather, which is creased against a die matching the ring gauge of the cigar to create the shape of the case. The forms include steel and silver.

Normal Balance  To increase an expense account, it must be debited. To decrease an expense account, it must be credited. The normal expense account balance is a debit. In order to understand why expenses are debited, it is relevant to note the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Equity. Expenses show up under the equity portion of the equation because equity is common stock plus retained earnings and retained earnings are revenues minus expenses minus dividends. Expenses are considered temporary accounts in this equation, because at the end of the period, expense accounts are closed. Because expense accounts decrease the credit balance of owner‚Äôs equity, expenses must be debited.  Closing Expense Accounts  At the end of the year, expense accounts need to be closed, or zeroed out. Expense accounts need to be closed because they are temporary, meaning that they pertain only to a given accounting period and won‚Äôt carry over into the next one. When expense accounts are closed, they close to another temporary account, known as Income Summary. So, the expense accounts must be credited, and the Income Summary will be debited. The net loss or gain in this account transfers to Retained Earnings, which is a permanent account.  Contra Expense Accounts  Contra accounts are accounts that are related, yet separate from its particular account. A contra expense account will behave in the opposite way a normal expense account will; instead of debiting to increase, a contra account must credit to increase. Instead of crediting to decrease, it will be credited to increase. An example of a contra expense account is Purchase Returns and Allowances. US tax treatment of expense accounts In the United States, the use of an expense account can be traced back to George Washington, who chose to forego a salary and relied on an expense account to cover his purchases during his military leadership in the American Revolution. Under today's tax laws of the United States, expense accounts are treated as either \\"accountable\\" or \\"unaccountable\\". Accountable expense accounts are subject to a variety of Internal Revenue Service regulations. There must be a documented business purpose for the account. Spending from the account must be documentable, typically by means of receipts. Any money entrusted to the employee from the account that is not spent for business purposes and accounted for must be returned to the employer.Internal Revenue Service, Publication 535 (2007), Business Expenses, ch. 11: Reimbursement of Travel, Meals, and Entertainment Money paid to an employee under an accountable expense account is not treated as taxable income to the employee; Where as money paid to an employee under an unaccountable plan is treated as income to the employee. Business expenses paid out of a nonaccountable plan are deductible from the employee's taxable income only as miscellaneous itemized deductions, and even then, they are only deductible if the expenses are equal to or greater than 2% of the employee's income. Special rules govern certain types of business expenses, including rules for travel, entertainment, food, and gifts.Internal Revenue Service, Publication 463 (2008), Travel, Entertainment, Gift, and Car Expenses, 2008 version. Expense accounts are also privately regulated by internal auditors for many employers, often to ensure funds are handled appropriately.

Montgomery was a staunch supporter of abolitionist principles and individual liberty and used extreme measures against pro-slavery populations. Early life and Bleeding Kansas James Montgomery was born to James and Mary Baldwin Montgomery in Austinburg, Ashtabula County, Ohio, on December 22, 1814.Clan Montgomery Society International Genealogical Database He migrated to Kentucky in 1837 with his parents and eventually taught school there. He married, but his first wife died shortly after the wedding, so he married again to Clarinda Evans.Clan Montgomery Society International Genealogical Database They moved to Pike County, Missouri, in 1852, and then to Jackson County and finally Bates County while awaiting the organization of Kansas for settlement. In 1854 Montgomery purchased land near present-day Mound City, Kansas, where he became a leader of local Free-state men and was a fervent abolitionist.Cutler, William G., History of the State of Kansas, A. T. Andreas, 1883, \\"The Era of Peace\\", Part 43Castel, Albert, Civil War Kansas: Reaping the Whirlwind, University Press of Kansas, 1997, page 42 In 1857 he organized and commanded a \\"Self-Protective Company\\", using it to order pro- slavery settlers out of the region. Conflict with other pro-slavery elements led territorial governor James W. Denver to dispatch U.S. Army soldiers in to restore order. Montgomery at times cooperated with the abolitionist John Brown and considered a raid to rescue Brown after his capture in Virginia, but snow in Pennsylvania upset his plan.Cutler, William G., History of the State of Kansas, A. T. Andreas, 1883, \\"The Era of Peace\\", Part 43 Civil War On July 24, 1861, Montgomery was commissioned as colonel of the 3rd Kansas Infantry of U.S. Senator James H. Lane's Kansas brigade, with Montgomery as second-in- command of the brigade.Cutler, William G., History of the State of Kansas, A. T. Andreas, 1883, \\"The Era of Peace\\", Part 43 Discipline was lacking under Montgomery, and both the 3rd, 4th, and 5th Kansas would be consolidated into the 10th Kansas Infantry in April 1862.Dyer, Frederick H., A Compendium of the War of the Rebellion, Part 3, Dyer Publching, 1908, page 1187 Lane's Kansas brigade was notorious for its Jayhawker-style raids into Missouri at the start of the war, particularly the Sacking of Osceola. Noted historian Albert Castel describes Montgomery as \\"a sincere, if unscrupulous, antislavery zealot.\\" \\"Kansas Jayhawking Raids into Western Missouri in 1861\\", Missouri Historical Review, Vol. 54 No. 1, October 1959 Montgomery was authorized to raise a regiment of African-American infantry in January 1863 that would become the 2nd South Carolina (African Descent).The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Series III, Volume III, page 14 Throughout 1863 and part of 1864, Montgomery practiced his brand of warfare in South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. In June 1863, Montgomery commanded a brigade, including his own 2nd South Carolina and the 3rd Rhode Island Heavy Artillery, in operations along the coast resembling his earlier Jayhawk raids. The most famous of his operations was the Raid at Combahee Ferry in which 800 slaves were freed with the help of Harriet Tubman. Montgomery led a raid on the coastal town of Darien, Georgia, which he ordered looted and burned even though it was not defended and had not offered any resistance. Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, commander of the all-black 54th Massachusetts Volunteers condemned the action, and in a private letter gave Montgomery's reason for burning the town as \\"that the Southerners must be made to feel that this was a real war, and that they were to be swept away by the hand of God, like the Jews of old.\\" Montgomery stated to Shaw, \\"We are outlawed, and therefore not bound by the rules of regular warfare.\\" . Montgomery's raids were part of a Union strategy to damage the Confederate states' ability to supply food and materials for their war effort. Some held that this strategy would in the end result in the loss of fewer lives, and a shorter and less protracted struggle, by driving the Confederacy to quickly surrender.. Montgomery commanded a brigade in the Battle of Olustee, where Union forces were pushed from Florida. In September 1864 he resigned his commission and returned to Kansas. He ended his military career as colonel of the 6th Kansas State Militia, active in October of that year during Confederate General Sterling Price's raid.The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Series I, Vol 81, page 520 Postbellum After the war, Montgomery returned to his Linn County, Kansas, farm, where he died on December 6, 1871.Cutler, William G., History of the State of Kansas, A.

It stars Linda Carol, Wendy O. Williams, Pat Ast, Sybil Danning and Sherri Stoner, and depicts the story of a young girl (played by Carol) who is sent to a reform school for girls that is operated by a sadistic and evil warden. She also has to deal with the local bully (Williams). After directing two other women in prison films, Prison Girls (1972) and The Concrete Jungle (1982), DeSimone decided to make a film that would be a spoof of the genre. The role of Warden Sutter in the original script was a man. Producers wanted Danning to play the character of Edna, but DeSimone thought she wasn't good for that part so he changed the role of Warden Sutter to a woman and had Danning play that role instead. The film received mostly negative reviews from critics. Plot The film is a satire of the women in prison film genre and deliberately implements many of the tropes commonly found in such films. Such scenes include nude shower scenes, fight scenes, and a suggested romantic relationship between one of the inmates and an administrator. The overall plot involves a new influx of girls coming to the school. They are immediately confronted with Charlie Chambliss, who is the de facto leader of the school and has an exceedingly close relationship with the head of the ward, Edna. Charlie and her circle are given special privileges by Edna and it is suggested that Charlie and Edna enjoy a more intimate relationship. Charlie runs a secret society of girls who are loyal to her and to whom she offers protection. The two main new girls break several of Edna's rules and are punished decisively for their infractions. Jenny comes to the school after becoming mixed up in a shoot out. When she and another group of girls arrive, they are forced to strip in front of the prison nurse and then take a shower, while being informed that they will be \\"inspected inside and out.\\" Afterwards, they are forced to stand naked along a wall while the nurse sprays them with delousing fluid. At one point while being deloused, the nurse tells the girls to \\"bend over ... spread them wide\\",suggesting that the girls will be given their cavity checks. Jenny later tries to break out after befriending a male driver with whom she has a romantic encounter in the back of his truck. She makes arrangements that he will drive her off the premises but is discovered by a guard and after a scuffle she is apprehended and immediately cast into isolation, where Edna forces her to strip naked before using a firehose to spray her with cold water. Lisa is a runaway who is captured and placed in the reform school, here Jenny is confronted by Charlie and inevitably results in a fight, Jenny is swiftly overwhelmed and left lightly hurt in-front of the other girls, She suffers several losses while at the school including her stuffed bunny and a cat she tends to which was originally found while the girls were out performing hard labor. The cat is discovered by Edna in the dorms and she chases it until finally stomping it to death. Lisa is punished with isolation. After the death of her cat, Lisa attempts to climb to the top of the tower, followed closely by Edna. When she reaches the top she stumbles backward as Edna confronts her, breaks through the barriers and falls to her death. This causes Jenny to smash through a window, which starts a riot which is only quelled when Warden Sutter shoots a shotgun into the ceiling. The film culminates in a protest scene after Dr. Norton, a psychiatrist, forces a meeting of administrators over the conditions and treatment of inmates at the school. She intended to have Jenny testify but a doctor determines, despite all evidence to the contrary, that she is ill and will not be able to attend. Therefore, four other inmates are chosen and none of them has any complaints. During the meeting Jenny knocks out a guard and steals her keys, which allows all the girls to march out into the main open area and voice their grudges. Edna, however, gets a hold of a gun and opens fire on them. Edna shoots Charlie and climbs up the tower from which Sutter has broadcast religious-oriented messages as the girls are going to sleep. Charlie climbs a fence and commandeers a school bus, which she drives toward the tower with Edna standing at the top. Just before impact, Charlie leaps from the bus and it explodes as it hits the tower. The scorched body of Edna tumbles to the ground and many of the girls cheer. Charlie crawls and before she dies shouts out, \\"See you in hell!\\" to Edna. The final scene shows Jenny released and getting into a cab. She waves at Dr. Norton, who is implied to be in charge of the new, more benevolent order at the school, and three other girls who are still incarcerated. Cast *Linda Carol as Jenny *Wendy O.

The character is depicted usually as a supporting character in Hulk books. Publication history He first appeared in Incredible Hulk vol. 2, #92 and was created by Greg Pak and Carlo Pagulayan. Fictional character biography Originally, Hiroim was a Shadow Priest, dedicated to the story of the Sakaarson ‚Äî he who would unite the people of Sakaar ‚Äî and trained to join the other Shadows. However, for his blasphemy of daring to dream that he could be the Sakaarson, he was expelled from the order. He was then chosen to be the personal guard of the Emperor of Sakaar, and to uphold an alliance between the Shadows and the Empire. He broke this vow however, when the Emperor ordered Hiroim to kill his adolescent son, due to the belief that he would bring ruin and devastation to Sakaar (a prediction that ended up coming to pass).World War Hulk Aftersmash: Warbound For breaking that oath, he ended up in the Empire's gladiator training school, the Maw, where he fought alongside such other warriors as Miek, No-Name the Brood, Korg and the Hulk. After two victories in the arena ‚Äî during which their teammate Lavin Skee was badly injured ‚Äî, having heard the stories of his allies, Hiroim formed a Warbound pact with them, vowing that they would always stand together. Having been freed from their obedience disks by the Silver Surfer, the Warbound went on to vanquish the Red King, Hiroim concluding that the Hulk was the true Sakaarson (although he briefly thought that the Surfer might be the Sakaarson). With the destruction of Sakaar following the detonation of the shuttle that brought the Hulk to Earth, Hiroim absorbed the powers of all the Sakaar Shadow Priests as he was the only one left, and he accompanied the Hulk to Earth to wage war against the Illuminati. During the subsequent conflict with Earth's heroes, Hiroim defeated Luke Cage during the Warbound's initial attack, but was in turn defeated by Doctor Strange when the sorcerer called on the power of his old enemy Zom. Hiroim is missing his left armWorld War Hulk Aftersmash: Warbound Cover due to Doctor Strange's attack.World War Hulk #4 Following the revelation of Miek's treachery that Miek had allowed the destruction of Sakaar, the remaining Warbound surrender to S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. They manage to escape during tremors caused by Manhattan Island breaking up due to the damage the Hulk had caused. Channeling the rock-based powers of his fellow Warbound Korg, as well as Earth hero the Thing, Hiroim is able to 'heal' the damage before he and the others depart, escaping into the sewers. During the World War Hulk Aftersmash: Warbound series, Hiroim and his fellow Warbound confront S.H.I.E.L.D. agents while attempt to protect a badly wounded Elloe Kaifi. Unfamiliar teleportational technology take all the Warbound and agent Kate Waynesboro to Nevada. Hiroim is not found with the others, as he had been separated by the Leader. Basing the two in a seemingly abandoned factory, the Leader uses Hiroim's powers to create a gamma-dome encapsulated environment called \\"Gamma World\\". Kate and the Warbound are trying to save him but the deadly shields go up despite their efforts. Hiroim eventually sacrifices himself to stop the Leader, and transfers his old power to Kate. Before his death, he was briefly able to rebuild his form, with an intact left arm, out of extant rock, channeling the full might of his Oldpowers. During the Chaos War storyline, Hiroim ends up returning from the dead after what happened to the death realms. He ends up helping the Hulks in fighting Abomination and the forces of Zom and Amatsu-Mikaboshi. The issue also shows that Hiroim and Korg were in a homosexual relationship.Incredible Hulk #619 While Hulk fights his father Brian Banner (who is in the form of Devil Hulk), Hiroim tries to exorcise Zom from Doctor Strange. This fails, but Zom is exorcised when Marlo Chandler taps into Death's powers.Incredible Hulk #620 Power and abilities Like all the Shadow People, Hiroim at his base, natural state possesses physical traits slightly superior to the human maximum, and ages more slowly after reaching adulthood at the age of 13. He possessed the enormous strength of a trained Shadow Warrior and could lift up to one ton. Beyond this he has received quasi-mystic training as a Shadow Priest, and is an experienced warrior, strategist, and philosopher. After the deaths of Caiera and his people he inherited the stone-based \\"Oldstrong Power\\", drawing power from the planet itself, enabling him to turn his body into immensely hard and strong 'mystic rock'. Further demonstrated talents include sensing and unravelling powerful mystic wards cast by Doctor Strange, and limited control over the earth, as seen when helping to keep a massive chasm from destroying Manhattan Island.

Dedicated to St James, the church belongs to the Church of England and is within the Diocese of Lincoln. Background In 1114, an existing religious building was transferred to Robert Bloet, the Bishop of Lincoln. The following years he supervised many renovations and developments to the building, resulting in St James, a church containing a nave with six bays. The central tower was added in 1365. In 1586 St James became the parish church of Grimsby, after John Whitgift united the parishes of St James and St Mary's. The parish church of the latter had been located on Victoria Street. In 1856 Canon Ainslie began a complete restoration of St James, which included lengthening the chancel and the rebuilding of the South transept. Later works included the installation of new windows with stone tracery, and the installation of new oak roofs. The next key event in the history of the church, was the opening of the James College in 1883. The predecessor of today's St James' School, it was founded by Canon Young. It was the only choir school in the UK to be attached to a parish church until the restructuring of the choir in September 2013 by Anthony Pinel, opening membership of the choir to boys and girls from any local school.Extract from Lincolnshire Life Magazine The news that the church was to be granted minster status was announced in the Grimsby Telegraph on 15 April 2010.\\"St James' Church to be granted minster status\\" , Grimsby Telegraph, 15 April 2010. Retrieved 2 September 2014 The Minster-making ceremony took place on Sunday, 16 May 2010 and was led by the Lord Bishop of Lincoln, and the Bishop of Grimsby. The Mayor of North East Lincolnshire, Councillor John Colebrook, accepted the official declaration of Minster status on behalf of the Borough. Parish structure The Parish of St Mary and St James includes three other churches: *St Hugh's Church, Grimsby *St Martin's Church, Grimsby *St Mark's Church, Grimsby These were all built as 'daughter churches' of St James, and are now known as 'district churches'. The four churches form one parish with one Parochial church council. Organ Memorial erected to the memory of the 810 members of the 10th (Service) Battalion, Lincolnshire Regiment (\\"Grimsby Chums\\") who were killed in action or died on service in WWI The church has two pipe organs. The West End Organ is by J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd and dates from 1951, built to replace an earlier instrument destroyed by enemy action during World War II. Parts of the pre-war instrument were incorporated within the new organ, notably soundboards and some pedal pipes. A specification and pictures of the organ can be see on the National Pipe Organ Register. The Walker organ was rebuilt by J. W. Walker in 1976, with significant tonal modifications being made at this time. Given the significant distance between the West End of the Church and the Choir, a second organ was installed on the North Side of the Choir in the 1970s, by Johnson. This two manual and pedal instrument is used for choral services to accompany the Choir. The specification and photographs of this instrument, too, can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

The school was founded in 1880 as St James' Choir School by Canon James Peter Young to educate choirboys and it is now a co-educational school of the Woodard Corporation. Since September 2013, instituted by organist Anthony Pinel, choristers have been drawn from across the county of North East Lincolnshire and membership of the choir is now open to girls as well as boys for the first time since the parish choir, instituted by Steven Maxson, was disbanded in late 2003. Choristers and choral scholars are currently drawn from eleven schools and colleges. A major recruitment drive is currently under way in order to restore the minster choir to its former glory, albeit now as a truly inclusive group open to all who would benefit from the musical education offered. It is hoped that there will soon be two treble sections, each singing two weekly choral services. The Choir is a delivery partner with the local Music Education Hub: North East Lincolnshire Music and Performing Arts Service (MAPAS). Bells The Minster has 10 bells hung for normal full-circle ringing. They weigh a total of 4.3 tonnes, the tenor (the largest bell) weighing 18.25cwt and having a diameter of 4 feet. They are tuned to the key of E flat. They date from 1830 when three of them were cast by William Dobson, and several bellfounders have cast the rest since then, including John Taylor & Co and John Warner & Sons, the newest bells (the two lightest) being cast in 1962 by Mears and Stainbank. Frank Kennington (born 26 December 1933) was taught to ring at the Minster in 1945 by his father and became Tower Captain in 1955. He gave up the post in 2012 after 57 years because the stairs leading to the ringing room were getting too much for him.

It has approximately 33,000 vineyard acres planted with wine grapes, and is well known for its heritage varietal Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Rh√¥ne-style wines.  History  Grapes were first introduced into the Paso Robles area in 1797 by missionaries at Mission San Miguel Arcangel, where more than one thousand vines were planted. Commercial wine growing, however, wasn't started until the 1880s with the establishment of Ascension Winery, later known as York Mountain Winery, and today known as Epoch Estate Wines. Among the winery‚Äôs early producers following prohibition was Polish pianist and composer Ignacy Jan Paderewski. Since 1990, when there were fewer than 20 wineries in Paso Robles, a large expansion of activity has seen the number rise to more than 200 wineries today. Wine critic Robert M. Parker, Jr. commented on the region's promise of quality of wine, emphasizing the wineries L'Aventure, Linne Calodo, Saxum Vineyards, Doce Robles \\"Twelve Oaks\\" Winery & Vineyard, Villa Creek Cellars, Castoro Cellars and Tablas Creek Vineyard as the \\"leading Paso pioneers\\". In 2007, a proposal to split the area at the Salinas River and form a new \\"Paso Robles Westside AVA\\" was made. The proposal was withdrawn in 2009, and a new proposal was made to break up the AVA into 11 smaller viticultural areas. In 2014, The United States Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau issued a final rule in the Federal Register establishing 11 new American viticultural areas within the existing Paso Robles viticultural area.  Paso Robles viticultural areas  *Adelaida District AVA *Creston District AVA *El Pomar District AVA *Paso Robles Estrella District AVA *Paso Robles Geneseo District AVA *Paso Robles Highlands District AVA *Paso Robles Willow Creek District AVA *San Juan Creek AVA *San Miguel District AVA *Santa Margarita Ranch AVA *Templeton Gap District AVA  Viticulture  A red blend from Paso Robles. The Paso Robles AVA is still acknowledged for its heritage grape, Zinfandel, but has gained recognition from a wider range of grape varietals as well. In the 1950s and 1960s, growers began to plant Bordeaux varieties, particularly Cabernet Sauvignon, in the area. Starting in the 1980s, there have been increased plantings of many Rh√¥ne varieties, including the first Syrah planted in California, as well as Viognier and Roussanne to name a few. The emerging popularity of the region's wines led it to become the first site of the bi- annual \\"Hospice du Rh√¥ne\\" conference on Rh√¥ne style wine. Today, Paso Robles Wine Country is receiving attention for its unique Paso blends. These wines are unique to the area, and with varietal make-ups that do not follow traditional rules and expectations of winemaking, as characteristic in other regions of the wine world. Wine Festivals The Paso Robles Zinfandel Festival, now known as Vintage Paso: Zinfandel Weekend, is a festival focused on the Paso Robles area's heritage grape, Zinfandel. This event is held by the Paso Robles Wine Country Alliance, a non-profit cooperative marketing alliance. The Paso Robles Wine Festival is a festival focused on the wide variety of wines the area produces, held in Paso Robles' downtown city park. Attendees have the opportunity to talk with the Paso Robles vintners and taste their wines. The Harvest Wine Weekend is a celebration of the harvest season with three days of hands-on Paso Robles Wine Country activities. In 2015, the Paso Robles Wine Country Alliance started a new festival, BlendFest on the Coast, dedicated to the unique wine blends of Paso Robles, held on the coast in San Simeon and Cambria.

I think of comedy as \\"the great diplomat\\": \\"I believe people are most open when they laugh, and that's perfect time to get them thinking and communicating.\\" A common theme in hall's film and stand-up comedy is the range of social issues that black people face. Her first work of note, a short film entitled The Memo, explores in comedic fashion the misadventures of Ted, who does not \\"get the memo\\" that the black revolution has begun. Mandingo in a Box features a life-sized, black, male \\"lover doll\\" that supposedly represents the ideal man for black women. Hall made a slight creative departure as creative producer of The Peace Process, a documentary that centers on a young man who tries to set a positive example in his heavily gang-influenced community.

Comparison Vansina (1962) discusses the classification of Sub-Saharan African Kingdoms, mostly of Central, South and East Africa, with some additional data on West African (Sahelian) Kingdoms distinguishing five types, by decreasing centralization of power: #Despotic Kingdoms: Kingdoms where the king controls the internal and external affairs directly. Examples are Rwanda, Ankole, Busoga and the Kingdom of Kongo in the 16th century #Regal Kingdoms: Kingdoms where the king controls the external affairs directly, and the internal affairs via a system of overseers. The king and his chiefs belong to the same religion or group. #Incorporative Kingdoms: Kingdoms where the king only controls the external affairs with no permanent administrative links between him and the chiefs of the provinces. The hereditary chiefdoms of the provinces were left undisturbed after conquest. Examples are the Bamileke, Lunda, Luba, Lozi #Aristocratic Kingdoms: the only link between central authority and the provinces is payment of tribute. These kingdoms are morphologically intermediate between regal kingdoms and federations. This type is rather common in Africa, examples including the Kongo of the 17th century, the Cazembe, Luapula, Kuba, Ngonde, Mlanje, Ha, Zinza and Chagga states of the 18th century. #Federations such as the Ashanti Union. Kingdoms where the external affairs are regulated by a council of elders headed by the king, who is simply primus inter pares. The Islamic empires of North and Northeast Africa do not fall into this categorization and should be discussed as part of the Muslim world. History periods Ancient history (3600 BC‚Äì500 AD) Ancient history refers to the time period beginning with the first records in writing, approximately 3600 BC. It ends with the fall of several significant empires, such as the Western Roman Empire in the Mediterranean, the Han Dynasty in China, and the Gupta Empire in India, collectively around 500 AD. Postclassical Era (500‚Äì1500 AD) The Postclassical Era, also referred to as the Medieval period or, for Europe, the Middle Ages, begins around 500 AD after the fall of major civilizations, covering the advent of Islam. The period ends around 1450‚Äì1500, with events like the rise of moveable-type printing in Europe, the voyages of Christopher Columbus, and the Ottoman Empire's conquest of Constantinople.

His new book \\"A New Ireland\\" will be published in February 2020. https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Niall-ODowd/154152578 Irish Presidency bid In early June 2011, O'Dowd announced he was considering becoming a candidate in the 2011 Irish Presidential election, calling himself \\"an Irish Diaspora voice.\\" According to Walter Ellis, writing in the Irish Times, O'Dowd's goal was > ...to call on the power of the Irish diaspora and bring it to bear on the > country‚Äôs crippled economy. He would rally the world‚Äôs wealthiest Irish > people and encourage them to invest in Ireland, North and South. O'Dowd approached Sinn F√©in and possibly other Irish parties seeking support. Sinn F√©in, though then party president Gerry Adams, stated in mid-June that they had been \\"lobbied by all the independent candidates\\" including O'Dowd. By 27 June, The Irish Echo declared the \\"Irish presidential field [is] starting to look crowded\\", citing a comment from O'Dowd saying \\"The reality is you have to fish where the fish are and the only votes for me are with Fianna F√°il and Sinn F√©in.\\" On the same day, Gerry Adams announced Sinn F√©in would \\"will make no decision on whether to back Irish-American publisher Niall O‚ÄôDowd or any other independent candidate for the presidency until it decides next month whether to run its own candidate.\\" On 30 June, O'Dowd stated he would not be running for the office. O'Dowd stated his reasons involved \\"The logistical challenges of running for an office as an independent against established political parties is incredible.\\" Walter Ellis, writing in The Irish Times remarked that, despite many impressive qualifications, \\"O'Dowd would not get my vote,\\" calling him \\"too much of an Irish-American for the √Åras.\\" An Irish Independent/Millward Brown Lansdowne poll revealed O‚ÄôDowd had been \\"way down the field of candidates with just 3pc support.\\" Sinn F√©in vice-president Martin McGuinness became that party's candidate, with backing from O'Dowd, and came third at 13.7 of the vote. Michael D Higgins was elected President of Ireland (see 2011 Irish presidential election). \\"Irish slaves\\" controversy Writing in The New York Times in March, 2017, Liam Stack noted that inaccurate \\"Irish slavery\\" claims had been given publicity in mainstream media including Scientific American, Daily Kos, and O'Dowd's IrishCentral. O'Dowd responded with an op-ed stating that \\"there is no way the Irish slave experience mirrored the extent or level of centuries-long degradation that African slaves went through.\\" Liam Hogan, among others, criticized IrishCentral for being slow to remove from its website two articles (one of them based on a piece that Scientific American quickly withdrew), and for the editorial's drawing comparisons between indentured servitude and slavery. Personal life O'Dowd is married to Debbie McGoldrick and they have a daughter Alana. He is the brother of the Fine Gael TD, Fergus O'Dowd.

September 21, 2007. Retrieved on September 21, 2007. Unity's installation cost around US$300 million, and its completion increased Trans- Pacific cable capacity by around 20 per cent. History The CS Tyco Resolute, a cable-laying ship which was used to install the Unity underwater communications cables In February 2008 a consortium comprising Bharti Airtel, Global Transit, Google, KDDI Corporation, Pacnet and SingTel announced that they had executed agreements to build a high-bandwidth subsea fiber optic cable linking the United States and Japan, with an estimated construction cost of US$300 million. A signing ceremony was held in Tokyo on February 23, 2008 at which the Unity consortium contracted NEC Corporation and Tyco Telecommunications to construct and install the system. NEC and Tyco began work on the project in June 2008. The cable reached Japan in November 2009. Testing of the cable was completed, and it became ready for service, in April 2010. Specifications Unity is a 10,000 kilometer Trans-Pacific cable between Chikura, located off the coast near Tokyo, and Los Angeles and other network points of presence on the West Coast of the United States. At Chikura, Unity is connected to other cable systems. The new five fiber pair cable system has five fiber pairs, with each fiber pair capable of carrying up to 960 gigabits per second (Gbit/s). By having a high fiber count, Unity is able to offer more capacity at lower unit costs. Unity is expected to initially increase Trans-Pacific lit cable capacity by about 20 percent, with the potential to add up to 7.68 terabits per second (Tbit/s) of bandwidth across the Pacific.

He is considered to have exerted a decisive influence on Sydney's architecture, mostly through his dedication to designing architecture that reacts to the landscape and to the needs of the client.  Life  Gruzman was born in Sydney, Australia. His parents‚ÄîSam Gruzman and Rosalind Gunzburg‚Äîwere of Russian origin. He was the middle son, with Laurence, the eldest and Des, the youngest. His childhood near Cooper Park, Bellevue Hill, exerted a certain influence on him regarding his attitude towards landscape. He initially intended to fulfill his mother's wish to study medicine but enrolled for architecture after graduating from Sydney Boys High School.Philip Goad, Neville Gruzman (2006). Gruzman: An Architect and His City In the late 1940s he entered the University of Sydney, where Beaux Arts was a main subject. The first three years of his studyings were difficult for him as he wasn't good in drawing. However, he profited from his work experiences. He developed an interest in ballrooms, particularly mirrors and reflections, and won some skills with glamorous decoration from an interior decorator, Margaret Jaye. In his fourth year at university, he was attracted to the European Modernists, who influenced and furthered him. Before he graduated, he designed the Lapin House, Rose Bay for his aunt. He graduated in 1952 and traveled to Europe with other graduates. Returning to Australia, he opened an office with Bill and Ruth Lucas. He read the work Architectural Beauty in Japan and was deeply attracted by wafer thin concrete roofs, screen glazing and floating upstands sitting over the garden. Therefore, he traveled to Japan for a four- and-a-half-months studying visit‚Äîa journey that would be followed by numerous others to the country. Later, Gruzman was amazed by the work of Frank Lloyd Wright. His understanding of the aspects of planning and of the necessities of an ongoing development grew decisively, in this period. In about 1967, he devoted himself to teaching; he is reported to have reassured his students attended the classes, regularly, and to have renounced holidays to provide extra tutorials for his students. He also participated in politics, to improve the quality of built environment. Gruzman had poor health. He suffered from asthma and heart attacks but managed to recover. He also had an accident that led to brain surgery causing the loss of most of his memory, including for details such as door dimensions, which he most attentively relearned. Architecture Gruzman mostly built residential houses in Sydney. His works are varied forms of Modernism known as Organic Modernism, or Regionalism; some show a strong influence by the works of Frank Lloyd Wright. The impressions exerted on him on his trips to Japan‚Äîmainly by the traditional post and beam architecture he saw at places like Katsura Imperial Villa‚Äîinfluenced some of the homes he created and into which he eventually included Japanese elementsStephen Lacey. Beauty and the East. FairfaxDigital / TheAge.com, retrieved 22 February 2011 (Goodman House, Middle Cove).

The Sydney Morning Herald, retrieved 22 February 2011 However, Gruzman's work deviates from the Sydney School style in important traits; Gruzman himself denied a connection to the movement. Notable projects *Hills House, Turramurra, New South Wales (1966, 1983) Original client was Sam Rosenburg, a nudist and vegetarian. Gruzman's idea was to build a series of hills that surround the site on three sides making it visually and acoustically private. Later, expansion was added for new clients, a family with three children.Karen McCartney (2007). Iconic Australian houses: three decades of domestic architecture The building is referred to by Philip Goad as a product of two iconic 20th-century houses (Wright's Fallingwater and Mies van der Rohe's Farnsworth House) that created the ultimate diagram of abstract shelter in the landscape.

In the 1990s Gruzman became politically active and was elected first as a councilor and then mayor of Woollahra, on a platform of responsible urban development. He was a critic of urban planning in Sydney, and also Sydney architects, notably Harry Seidler. Both his architectural criticism and time as mayor were controversial. Career as a teacher Gruzman began teaching at the University of New South Wales in the 1960s with a number of contemporary modernist architects such as Bill Lucas and Harry Howard. He became an Adjunct Professor and, as a critic of shortening teaching hours and increasing class size, was known for using Saturdays and public holidays to give extra classes to his students at his own home. In 2002 he established two student awards at the Faculty of the Built Environment, both for the best use of urban design in architecture. In his studio practise, beginning from the 1950s, he also employed and trained many notable Sydney architects, including Pritzker Prize winner Glenn Murcutt.Prizes in the Faculty of Built Environment.

Children's book and comic strips Sanders earned a B.A. in Literature at Reed College in 1955. Under the nom de plume Martha Sanders, she wrote Alexander and the Magic Mouse (1969), a children‚Äôs book about an Alligator from China who lives with an Old Lady, a Brindle London Squatting Cat, a Magical Mouse, and a Yak. Although Sanders was a working artist, the French illustrator Philippe Fix was responsible for the pictures, which, according to one reviewer in 1970, \\"make the book the success it is.\\" The same reviewer likened the colors of Fix's illustrations to \\"yesteryear's tintypes,\\" which \\"set the Victorian scene and show Alexander to best advantage.\\" Sanders created her own illustrations for Branwell Snit, a comic strip that appeared between 1975 and 1977 in Wisdoms Child, a pennysaver in New York City. The comic strip similarly featured a cast of talking animal characters: Branwell F. Snit, a cogitating prodigy feline named after Branwell Bront√´ and based on Sanders's actual cat of the same name; Monroe, an undifferentiated bird; and Kenneth, a shaggy dog. In 2016, Sanders published her entire Branwell Snit comic strip series in The Branwell Snitbook: The Complete Branwell Snit Cat Comix. Poetry Throughout her adult life, Sanders has written poetry, which eventually \\"approached the Wordsworthian ideal of natural and yet heightened language.\\" In 1975, one of her poems was included in an anthology of works by contemporary female poets. Sanders published a collection of her poems and a selection of her drawings in Looking for Lola: Poems & Drawings by Morgan Sanders, which was released in 2018. Paintings and wall constructions In 1973, Morgan Sanders was a founding member of SOHO20, the second all-women cooperative art gallery in New York City. For her initial exhibition at SOHO20 in early 1974, she showed three-dimensional wall constructions that combined painting and found objects. In his review, the art critic Peter Frank described the \\"progressions of dissimilar elements\\" as \\"episodic\\" and praised their suggestion of \\"a stream- of-consciousness narrative, with rapid, exhilarating changes of venue.\\" At SOHO20 in 1975, Sanders exhibited four sets of photographs and three large paintings that depicted the aging interiors of turn-of-the-twentieth-century architecture on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, including Tiemann Place. The paintings, which showed the \\"marble of a lobby, metal work of a bannister, floor tiles, and masonry details,\\" were segmented in a collage-like manner. A large nocturnal view of her apartment was similarly \\"disjointed,\\" as if \\"the canvas was painted in sections,\\" according to a reviewer in the New York Times. Photography Sanders increasingly turned to photography in the late 1970s and began to create photographic series, such as Harlem Walls and Trucks. She showed Harlem Walls at the New York Public Library. Trucks was exhibited at The Camera Club of New York in 1980, and at the Viking Union Gallery in Bellingham, Washington shortly after Sanders moved there in 1982. The next year, she showed a photographic series called Flowers and Stones at Fairhaven College. Shot with a telephoto lens, the works were meant to be seen from a distance of 20 to 25 feet, which made the flowers \\"become the dipping and sweeping figures of dancers in flowing gauze gowns,\\" in the words of one reviewer. By the end of the 1980s, she was photographing the countryside in Whatcom County, Washington.

Harvard's conceptual ideas were practiced and refined by a team led by Harry Schwarz in the North Atlantic Regional Study, a Federal water study instigated by President Lyndon B. Johnson after an historic drought in the Northeast led New York City to stop releasing water from its reservoirs into the Delaware River. President Johnson intervened because without that rush of freshwater flowing down the Delaware into the Atlantic Ocean, Atlantic salt water might have been introduced into the Philadelphia drinking water system. Schwarz later summarized the practical interpretation of the Harvard principles in \\"Large Scale Regional Water Resources Planning\\" which he wrote with David Major, a Harvard economist. The lessons learned in the North Atlantic Study were later encoded in the Federal \\"Principles and Standards for Planning Water and Related Land Resources\\" (1973) often shortened to \\"the P&S;\\". The \\"P&S;\\" were used in the design and justification of proposed federal water projects. Eugene Stakhiv, then head of the Corps policy studies, first suggested that a variation on the P&S; should be used for drought response planning. During the National Drought Study, the Corps modified the P&S; planning steps to make them more suitable for drought management decisions, which generally do not involve significant federal funding. These decisions typically must also be agreed to by multiple management entities, and there are typically multiple levels of government that control the drought response. The \\"Circles of Influence\\" method of public involvement was developed by Robert Waldman during the National Drought Study and modified traditional Federal approaches. Typically, Federal water studies would invite stakeholders‚Äîpeople whose lives could be affected by the decision to build a project‚Äîto public meetings. Stakeholders might come to support and shape the infusion of Federal money into the region. But drought management studies typically do not determine whether federal money will be invested in a region; they determine water use curtailment and the storage and allocation of water supplies. Accordingly, \\"Circles of Influence\\" management agencies participate in forums already being used by stakeholders, such as city water advisory boards or boating groups. Trust is developed in concentric circles; the planner works to deserve the trust of the leaders other stakeholders already trust. Disputes that arise during planning are addressed using a range of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) methods. The Corps had been an early adapter of ADR, thanks to the work of Jerry Delli Priscoli. Delli Priscoli who worked at the Corps' Institute for Water Resources, where the National Drought Study was managed, was an informal advisor on the Drought Study. While there is still a link between the SVP community and the ADR community, it is largely personal, as the two communities are not served by a single professional society or journal. The third element, the \\"shared vision model\\" was proposed by Richard Palmer during a National Drought Study case study meeting in Seattle, Washington in 1991. More than ten years earlier, Palmer had been doing post-doctorate work from Johns Hopkins University at the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin (ICPRB). ICPRB was one of several government organizations developing reservoir projects to address water supply needs in the Washington Metropolitan area. Palmer proved using an optimization model that regional water needs could be met with only two new reservoirs if the water supply systems of Maryland, Northern Virginia and Washington were managed collaboratively, but because his model was a black box, his solution was not given a fair hearing. Palmer was aware of the use of interactive water models by Pete Loucks, a professor of engineering at Cornell University and he decided to build a simple interactive simulation model he called \\"PRISM\\" (Potomac River Interactive Simulation Model) and used it in a game playing exercise with water utility representatives. The exercise led to an historic agreement in 1981. Dan Sheer, who was working at ICPRB labeled this technique \\"computer aided negotiation\\" and has been using it since then in river basin studies around the world. Palmer introduced the concept to the National Drought Study team using a systems simulation model building software called STELLA, and the union of Palmer's modeling technique with the planning and public participation elements resulted in what is now known as shared vision planning. Elements developed through application since the Drought Study In later applications, three more major elements developed and were added to Shared Vision Planning. The first is the concept of using Practice Decisions to achieve what Jerry Delli Priscoli calls \\"informed consent\\", which is similar to the medical concept in that expert and stakeholder consider each other's values, objectives and knowledge through a structured dialogue before mutually agreeing to a decision. Practice decisions are just that, decisions made publicly using preliminary data, model results and decision criteria. Practice decisions help decision makers refine and clarify all of these elements, even to arrange for new studies if it becomes clear that it will be needed because of new or more clearly articulated decision criteria. Practice decisions make the final decisions more transparent, and it gives stakeholders and experts an opportunity to present their arguments. The second major element is the use of decision scaling and scenario analysis to address uncertainty about future climate. Decision scaling was developed by Casey Brown, based on the idea that planners should determine whether any plausible future climate could cause failures to meet system objectives. Decision scaling applies more and more extreme climate conditions in system evaluations until the system fails. Future climate scenarios generated by GCMs, RCMs and other means can then be compared to the failure threshold to determine which plausible futures (if any) cause failures. Alternatives can then be developed to eliminate those failures while still performing well under more normal climate conditions. A robust alternative is one that performs about as well as any other alternative in any plausible future climate. The third major element is a more clearly articulated transition to adaptive management. Shared vision planning always required adaptive management and the use of virtual floods and droughts to keep decisions up to date. But during the application of shared vision planning on the International Joint Commission (IJC) International Upper Great Lakes study, institutional studies were conducted to develop an argument and procedure for adaptive management, and it became the strong recommendation of that Study Board. The IJC tested the adaptive management procedures in an experimental task force, then created the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River Adaptive Management Committee to carry it out. Name The method at first was called the \\"drought preparedness study method\\" but was renamed \\"Shared Vision Planning\\" at the suggestion of the late Brian Mar, a University of Washington colleague of Palmer who had heard the name applied to systems design at nearby Boeing Aerospace. Peter Senge used the shared vision phrase in his 1990 book on systems analysis, The Fifth Discipline and this may have been where Boeing learned it. Other case studies Shared vision planning was used in five test studies during the National Drought Study; two were considered successful, the other three were not. Bill Werick, the National Drought Study leader later developed a set of \\"triage\\" questions to ask that would help determine whether shared vision planning would be helpful. Shared vision planning use was expanded beyond drought response planning immediately after the National Drought Study in the Alabama-Coosa- Tallapoosa‚ÄîApalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACT-ACF) Rivers conflict. Its application led to the first interstate water compact in the southeast, but the compact expired years later when the three governors of Florida, Georgia and Alabama could not agree on terms for its continuation. The method has been used in several case studies since, most recently by the International Joint Commission (IJC) in the Lake Ontario‚ÄìSt. Lawrence River Study (2000‚Äì2006), the Upper Great Lakes (2007‚Äì2012)., and the Rainy Lake study. The method has also been applied in Peru in support of some World Bank and Interamerican Development Bank water projects. The method was considered by academics and stakeholders in Sao Paulo during the recent drought, but, as predicted by the answers to the triage questions, it was rejected. Prospects for wider use The use of the methods underlying shared vision planning is now more widespread than the name itself. Robert Costanza, the director of the Gund Institute for Ecological Economics, has used STELLA models in environmental and economic modeling since 1987. The International Environmental Modelling and Software Society (iEMSs), which Costanza co-founded, has as its goal the development and use of environmental modelling and software tools to advance the science and improve decision making with respect to resource and environmental issues. Many iEMSs members have developed approaches similar to shared vision planning without any apparent awareness of the Corps' work, which is perhaps a testament to its soundness. \\"Mediated modeling\\" describes a systems based participatory modeling approach to environmental issues that is very similar to shared vision planning but has typically been used as a learning tool, especially for stakeholders who might otherwise be left out of public policy dialogues. The Corps' Institute for Water Resources (IWR) managed the National Drought Study and now manages the Corps' shared vision planning activities. IWR, Sandia National Laboratories, and the United States Center for Environmental Conflict Resolution hosted the first national gathering of shared vision planners in Albuquerque, New Mexico in September 2007. A second conference was held in 2010 in Denver, Colorado. The conferences were part of the Computer Aided Dispute Resolution or CADRe program. Conference participants agreed that the basic methods of shared vision planning were slowly becoming part of the mainstream in water resources management but that the process could be accelerated if a common name and community identity could be applied to all the various permutations on the approach.

As a research hospital, it is associated with the University of Z√ºrich. It is also called Burgh√∂lzli, after the wooded hill in the district of Riesbach in southeastern Z√ºrich where it is located. History The former convent buildings of Predigerkirche Z√ºrich were also used after the abolition of the monastery by the hospital. After the construction of the new hospital in 1842, they became the so-called \\"Versorgungsanstalt\\" where chronically ill, old, incurable mental patients were housed. The history of the hospital began in the early 1860s, when internist Wilhelm Griesinger at the University of Zurich made plans for the creation of a modern psychiatric clinic for humane treatment of the mentally ill. Although Griesinger died before the building was established in 1870, he is considered the founder of the Burgh√∂lzli. From 1870 until 1879, the hospital had three directors, Bernhard von Gudden, Gustav Huguenin and Eduard Hitzig. All three men practiced medicine from a biological basis, with brain pathology and physiology being the general focus of their research. Auguste-Henri Forel was the fourth director of Burgh√∂lzli, and spent nearly twenty years at the helm. Under his leadership, the hospital began to gain recognition throughout the medical world. Forel was able to combine the \\"dynamic approach\\" of French psychiatry with the biological orientation of the German school of psychiatric thought. In 1898 Eugen Bleuler became director of the Burgh√∂lzli, where he would remain until 1927. The \\"Bleuler era\\" is considered the most illustrious period at the hospital, largely due to the advent of psychoanalysis, usage of Freudian psychiatric theories, and the creative work of Bleuler's assistant, Carl Gustav Jung. Bleuler was followed as director by Hans-Wolfgang Maier and afterwards by his son Manfred Bleuler. In addition to Jung, many renowned psychiatrists spent part of their career at the Burgh√∂lzli, including Karl Abraham, Ludwig Binswanger, Eug√®ne Minkowski, Hermann Rorschach, Franz Riklin, Constantin von Monakow, Eugen Bleuler, Ernst R√ºdin, Adolf Meyer, Abraham Brill and Emil Oberholzer. Albert Einstein's son, Eduard Einstein was a patient at Burgh√∂lzli. Today the Burgh√∂lzli is an important center for psychiatric research and the treatment of mental illness. The psychological torture master Ewen Cameron studied at Burgh√∂lzli in the late 1920s. On March 6, 1971, a fire broke out at the clinic, and 28 patients perished; all were male, all elderly, and all died from suffocation rather than from burns. There were bars on the windows, frustrating the attempts of rescuers to save lives.\\"28 Elderly Men Die in Fire at Clinic in Zurich Suburb,\\" New York Times, March 7, 1971, p. 8. Trivia The fictitious 2007 Swiss mystery film Marmorera was filmed among others, at the B√ºrgh√∂lzli sanatory in the Weinegg district of Z√ºrich, on the river Limmat near Technopark Z√ºrich, at the Limmatquai promenade, and on the M√ºnsterbr√ºcke river crossing towards M√ºnsterhof.

Shiva aided them in killing the asuras - the practise of worshipping Shiva on traiyodashi along with Nandi emerged and continues in Shiva temples. \\"Pradosha vrata\\" (vow) is performed on pradosham with sacred ritual steps following the tradition.Sehgal 1999, p. 704 Shani Pradosha Shani Pradosha, the pradosha falling on a Saturday corresponding to planet saturn is considered important among other pradosham.Samarth 2009, p. 41 The importance of Shani Pradosha is closely associated with Mahakaleshwar temple in Ujjain, a town in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. The city of Ujjain was called Avantika and was famous for its devotional epicenter. It was also one of the primary cities where students went to study holy scriptures. According to legend, there was a ruler of Ujjain called Chandrasen, who was a pious devotee of Shiva and worshipped him all the time. He was blessed with a celestial gem which could create miracles. Rivals of Ujjain, king Ripudaman and king Singhaditya of the neighboring kingdoms decided to attack Ujjain and take over the treasure.Samarth 2009, p. 42 The king Chandransena unaware of the impending war was worshipping Shiva. He was joined by a farmer's boy named Shrikhar, who was walking on the grounds of the palace and heard the king chant the Shiva's name. However, the guards removed him by force and sent him to the outskirts of the city near the river Kshipra. Shrikhar continued to pray and the news spread to a priest named Vridhi. He was shocked to hear this and upon the urgent pleas of his sons, he started to pray Shiva inside the river Kshipra. The enemy kings chose to attack and it happened to be a Saturday and Triyodashi. With the help of the powerful demon Dushan, who was blessed by Brahma to be invisible, they plundered the city and attacked all the devotees of Shiva. Upon hearing the pleas of his helpless devotees, Shiva appeared in his Mahakal (form of light) and destroyed the enemies of king Chandrasen.Samarth 2009, p. 43 Upon the request of his devotees Shrikhar and Vridhi, Shiva agreed to reside in the city and become the chief deity of the kingdom. From that day on, Shiva resided in his light form as Mahakal in a Lingam that was formed on its own from the powers of the Shiva and his consort, Parvati. It is believed that people worshipping Shiva on a Shani Pradosha would be free from the fear of death and diseases.

Burr's artwork explores the relationships between, \\"the built environment, subjectivity, and historical persona\\". He is based in New York City. Life Burr was born in 1963 in New Haven, Connecticut. Burr attended the Educational Center for the Arts high school, a multi-arts program taught in part by Yale University graduate students. It is here that Burr became aware of and developed an interest in Minimal and post-Minimalist artists, including Robert Smithson, Dan Graham, Eva Hesse and Gordon Matta Clark. Burr's senior thesis work reflected these influences, by merging sculptural elements with brief poetic texts. Simultaneously, Burr‚Äôs collage based work began at this time. After graduating from high school, Burr moved to New York City in 1982 to attended figure drawing classes at the Art Students League of New York. Followed by further study, Burr attended the School of Visual Arts (SVA) from 1982 until 1986 and the Whitney Independent Study Program from 1987 to 1988, where he studied with Craig Owens, Benjamin Buchloh, Yvonne Rainer, Barbara Kruger, and Ull Hohn. During this time Burr immersed himself in the theoretical writings and conceptual practices that would expand his own work and thinking. While at the Whitney Program in 1988 Burr met art dealer Colin de Land and began a friendship that would lead to Burr joining de Land's seminal gallery, American Fine Arts, Co. in the early 1990s. In the late 1990s Burr embarked on a body of work that remains ongoing; derived from the language and forms of both Tony Smith's sculptures, on the one hand, and closed architectural spaces such as bars, cages and boxes. These works, often borrowing Smith's matte black palette, evoke spaces of control and containment, as well as the \\"safe zones\\" of underground cultures, such as gay male culture. Alongside these works, Burr developed his now iconic Bulletin Boards, originally created out of the excessive collecting of images and materials that are part of his working methods. Constructed through plays of juxtaposition, the boards are markers of place, often reflecting the situation of their exhibition. His work was included in the Whitney Biennial 2004 exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Burrs work is found in many public art collections including: Hammer Museum, Whitney Museum of American Art, Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami, Walker Art Center, and many others.

Brittany was introduced on December 1, 1999, by former executive producer Edward J. Scott. The role was originated by Vanessa Lee Evigan who departed on February 25, 2000, and was replaced by Lauren Woodland, who debuted on March 7. Brittany's storylines included relationships with Raul Guittierez (David Lago) and J.T. Hellstrom (Thad Luckinbill), as well as marriage to Bobby Marsino (John Enos III) and giving birth to their child, Joshua. Woodland said that the romance with Raul changed the character who was previously manipulative and sexual. Brittany began working at a club owned by Bobby Marsino as a stripper and later a singer, for which she created the stage alter-ego Marilyn. Woodland enjoyed working on this storyline because she is an entertainer in real life. She eventually married Bobby and they had a child together. Bobby died in an accident and Brittany left town on November 2, 2005. The character was well-received; three years after her departure, Luke Kerr of Daytime Confidential said that he missed when the character was on, writing: \\"It's really too bad that Lauren wasn't snapped up by another soap after leaving Y&R.;\\" Casting Vanessa Lee Evigan originated the role of Brittany on December 1, 1999, and portrayed the role on a recurring status until February 25, 2000. The role was recast with Lauren Woodland. Woodland first aired in March 2000. She was absent from the series from February to March 2003 when she was in contract negotiations. Dan Kroll of the website SoapCentral noted that Sharon Case, who plays Sharon Newman, was also in contract negotiations so the show could \\"lose two of its high-profile blonde actresses.\\" That April, it was announced that the actress had opted for a three-year contract. Woodland last appeared in the role of Brittany on November 2, 2005; the character left following her husband's death. Woodland was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for her portrayal. In February 2018, it was reported that Woodland would be returning as Brittany to commemorate with the show's 45th anniversary. Woodland returned on March 28 and 29, 2018. In April 2018, Soap Opera Digest announced that Woodland would return as Brittany for an \\"indefinite run,\\" the new scenes aired from June 12 to 18, 2018. Woodland made other appearances on September 12, 2018, and from February 18 to March 13, 2019. Development Three years into her duration on the series, Woodland said that Brittany \\"Started off as this manipulative and very sexual person who would do whatever it took to get what she wanted.\\" She explained that Brittany has always been a \\"complicated\\" person but everyone was \\"able to see that a lot of that behavior came from her insecurities\\" along with the bad relationship she had with her family, including her parents Frederick (John Martin) and Anita Hodges (Mitzi Kapture). In November 2002, Candace Havens of Zap2It wrote that Brittany had always \\"been a bit of a schemer\\" until she found \\"true love\\" with the \\"handsome\\" Raul Guittierez (David Lago). Woodland stated that Raul is the \\"First person to give her the love and attention she needs, and she has fallen in love with him because of it. After the car crash, she blamed herself and didn't think she was worthy of his love, but he showed her how much he truly cared about her.\\" However, the relationship didn't work out in the end. Another man Brittany was involved with was J.T. Hellstrom (Thad Luckinbill). Woodland was thrilled when she found out that her character would be a stripper, because she was an entertainer herself. Nancy Reichardt of Oakland Tribune noted that the storyline was \\"complete with choreographed song-and-dance routines\\", the reason for the actress being excited. Woodland explained that \\"I always wanted to do musical theater\\" which is why this was a great opportunity. She forms an on-stage alter ego, Marilyn, named after Marilyn Monroe. Her father Frederick attended the club, allured by the new sensation \\"Marilyn\\" but is horrified to find out that she is his own daughter. Brittany became involved with the owner of the club she stripped at, Bobby Marsino (John Enos III). She asked Bobby if she could pursue her real passion at the club, singing, instead of stripping, to which he accepted. They became engaged, although she still had feelings for J.T. The show's special eight- thousandth episode was the wedding between Brittany and Bobby. Storylines In 1999, Brittany Hodges introduced as part of the new teen scene at Walnut Grove Academy. She was the snobby rich girl, the daughter of a wealthy banker; she was often neglected by her parents. At the time, Brittany had a rich boyfriend, J.T. She soon dumped J.T. when she snagged Billy Abbott (David Tom), an Abbott heir. Brittany wasn't a good influence on Billy, who was trying to make his place in his family's company by pretending to be a party boy. Billy got alcohol poisoning at a party thrown by J.T., and neither J.T. nor Brittany attempted to call the ambulance for fear of getting in trouble themselves. Billy's friend Raul came in time to save him, but his mother, Jill Abbott (Jess Walton), lost respect for Brittany when she didn't help her son. At the Junior Prom, Brittany realized that Billy was attracted to Mackenzie Browning (Ashley Bashioum), after they won Prom King and Queen. Brittany and Billy were chosen for the Glo By Jabot Kids campaign, and she used the opportunity to keep Billy for herself. She staged making love to Billy in order for Mac to walk in on them. Billy didn't remember anything, but the truth eventually came out when J.T. accidentally revealed it. Billy and Mac continued to be drawn to one another, and Brittany was left alone, plotting for revenge. Mac began talking to Billy in an Internet chat room under an alias in order to get him to admit to his feelings for her. Brittany found out, and she put Mac's real name on the website. Brittany revealed that Mac was a runaway, but her plan was foiled when Mac's mother, Amanda Browning (Denice Duff), came to Genoa City. Brittany named her stripper alter ego \\"Marilyn\\" after Marilyn Monroe. Brittany began to spend more time with Raul, who was unlike Brittany's other friends because he did not come from a wealthy background. Brittany shoplifted a sweater for Raul to give to his mother for Christmas. She also helped him with his college applications that he was reluctant to complete. Then, Brittany got the lead role in the school play, Much Ado About Nothing. Raul stepped in to play the male lead when J.T. didn't show up to play his role. Brittany and Raul's feelings culminated when they shared a kiss backstage at the play. Later, Raul supported Brittany when her parents didn't come to see her. In a turn of events, Brittany then dumped Raul after she became afraid by the feeling of being in love. She started dating J.T. again in order to hurt Raul. Raul's ex-girlfriend, Rianna Miner (Alexis Thorpe), returned to town just in time for prom, and she persuaded Brittany and Raul to start dating. After prom, the couple made love at a campsite. Their lives took different paths when they accepted colleges in different towns. Before they went to school, they got into a car accident where Brittany was driving drunk. She came out of the accident unscathed while Raul was paralyzed for several months. Raul blamed Brittany for the accident, and he told her to go to college and leave him alone. Brittany refused to leave Genoa City, and she stayed with Raul while he recovered. When Brittany and Raul reunited, Brittany's parents, Anita and Frederick, didn't approve of their relationship. They cut Brittany off from their money, and she was forced to live in a cheap apartment with Raul. One night, burglars came into the apartment and held Brittany captive. Luckily, Billy Abbott and Raul arrived in time to save her. After the break-in, Brittany and Raul both moved back in with their families for a short while. During that time, Raul turned down his scholarship from an out-of-town college in order to stay with Brittany and work part-time in Genoa City. Then, Brittany and Raul moved into an apartment with Billy and Mac, who were engaged at the time. In a turn of events, Billy and Mac left town after they were led to believe that they were first cousins. Raul and Brittany rented Mac's room to J.T. in order to make some money. The peaceful life started to bother Brittany, and she started working as a singer, under the name of \\"Marilyn\\", at a club owned by Bobby. She refused to strip, but the crown encouraged her to, and she gave in. She got a lot of money for her performances, and she loved the attention that she was getting. J.T. followed her to work one day, and he discovered what she had been doing. Raul soon found out the truth, and he broke up with Brittany, who thought that Raul would accept her new job. Soon, Brittany and Bobby began to have romantic feelings for each other. Then, Brittany's father went to the club with some of his clients. After discovering Brittany there, he teamed up with Raul in order to get the club shut down. They were successful for a short while, but the club eventually opened again. Bobby Marsino was involved in the mob, and his mobster friends wanted revenge on Brittany's father for shutting the club down. They punished him by electrocuting Brittany when she touched her stripper pole on stage. The right side of her face was severely burned, and Raul and Bobby stayed with her during her recovery. In the end, Brittany found comfort in Bobby, and she left Raul behind. Bobby decided to reopen the club as a cabaret called Marilyn's just for Brittany. His mobster friends were angry with him, but Bobby had the last laugh when he wore a wire to get them to confess to their crimes. They were eventually sent to jail. Meanwhile, Raul found Brittany a plastic surgeon to fix her scars, and he later left town after Brittany rejected him. In 2004, Brittany and Bobby got married at the Chancellor Estate with her parents reluctantly in attendance. After the wedding, Brittany's father gave Bobby a large check and a threat to take care of his little girl. Then, they disowned their daughter. After the wedding, the newlyweds moved into the Newman Ranch while Bobby's condo was being renovated. During their stay, Bobby became close to Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott). Brittany forced him to move somewhere else away from Nikki. Then, Brittany found out that she was pregnant. Due to complications from her pregnancy, Bobby borrowed money from the mob to pay for Brittany's medical bills. They planned on naming their son Joshua after Bobby's late brother. Before the birth, Bobby and Brittany began to receive anonymous baby gifts that were really from the mob. In order to protect the baby, Brittany told the public that J.T. was the father of the baby. Also, she and Bobby staged a split to throw the mob off course. Nikki found out about Bobby and Brittany's secret, and she was kidnapped by the mob. Bobby rescued Nikki, and J.T. took Brittany to the Newman Ranch for protection, where she gave birth to her son, Joshua Marsino. Mac helped deliver the baby, who was two months premature. Bobby was forced into the Witness Protection Program, and Brittany moved into the Chancellor Estate with baby Joshua, J.T. and Mac. Later, Brittany was able to see Bobby, under heavy security protection, for a short while. Then, she waited for months to hear from him again. Eventually, Brittany received the tragic news that Bobby was killed by a hit-and-run. Distraught, Brittany left Genoa City with Joshua, and they moved back in with her parents in New York City. In March 2018, Brittany returned to Genoa City for the Walnut Grove Centennial Reunion disclosing that she was a partner in a law firm. On her arm was the bearded and distinguished Raul Guittierez. They had gotten together after Raul's breakup with Mackenzie, and were married a year later. Raul had transferred from Washington D.C. to New York City and had adopted Brittany's son Joshua, who was a freshman at Harvard. Both were surprised to see their old pal Billy Abbott in a relationship with former pal Daniel's mother Phyllis Summers. Back together again, Victoria and J.T. also attended, as well as J.T.‚Äôs soon to be ex-wife, Mackenzie. In June 2018, Brittany was hired by Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow) to fight his father Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) for custody of toddler Christian Newman. When Nick tried to move to San Diego, Victor decided to hire Michael Baldwin and sue for custody. Although Victor got temporary custody, the arbitrator awarded Nick custody of Christian, due to Victor's health issues. Flash forward to 2019, Brittany was hired by Sharon Newman as her lawyer after she was accused of murdering J.T. Helstrom and disposing of the body with the help of Victoria Newman, Nikki Newman, and Phyllis Summers. In trial, Brittany did a fantastic job of slaughtering Phyllis on the stand since Phyllis made a deal with District attorney Christine Williams to roll over on the other women in an attempt to avoid prison time. Through very good efforts, unfortunately Sharon was found guilty and sentenced to 4 years in prison.

It was built by Judge Josephus Conn Guild for his family, and completed in 1842. Once the site of the area's largest thoroughbred horse farm with , it is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Rosemont. In 1993 the property was purchased by the City of Gallatin and the Rose Mont Restoration Foundation. The house is open to the public. History Rose Mont was built by Judge Josephus Conn Guild (1802‚Äì1883) for his family. It was begun in 1836 and completed in 1842. All of the materials for its construction were obtained on the property. Rose Mont's architecture is a blend of Greek Revival and Palladian styles. These architectural styles not commonly seen in Middle Tennessee homes of the era, which is typified by Federal or Georgian-style houses with a front entry hall containing a staircase to the second floor. Judge Guild's departure from the local architectural fashions was due to his favorable impression of the Creole-style houses he had seen on frequent trips to Louisiana. Creole elements in Rose Mont include the use of loggias and galleries to connect separate wings, wide porches, open-air halls and staircases, large windows, a raised basement, and an over-hanging roof. The house's main facade employed a classic Italian design by Andrea Palladio, whose influence is seen in the design of many mid-19th century plantation houses in the southern United States. Rose Mont faces the east, so hot summer sun never falls on the main parlor, keeping it cooler. The name of the house derived from a large rose garden that Judge Guild's wife, Catherine Blackmore Guild (1803‚Äì1875), maintained on the north side of the house. In its early years, the house was the center for a working farm that raised thoroughbred horses and longhorn cattle. In 1978 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places under the name \\"Rosemont\\". It was occupied by members of the Guild family from its construction until 1993, when it was acquired by the City of Gallatin and the Rose Mont Restoration Foundation. It is open Tuesdays through Saturdays for guided tours from April 15 through October 31. The mansion and its reception hall are available for rental to the public. In popular culture=Television Rose Mont was featured as a haunted location on the paranormal series, Haunted Live which aired in 2018 on the Travel Channel. The paranormal team, the Tennessee Wraith Chasers investigated reports of 'Nana', an Old Hag entity that attacks visitors to the home.https://www.travelchannel.com/shows/haunted-live/episodes/the-soul- collector ReferencesExternal links * Official website Further reading * *Sumner County Fact Book 2007-2008.

Harkness was laid down as YMS-242 by Tacoma Boatbuilding Company, Tacoma, Washington, 1 June 1942; launched 10 October 1942; commissioned 27 March 1943, Lt. (j.g.) H. S. Meredith in command. Operational history= World War II service  After shakedown along the California coast, YMS-242 departed San Diego, California, 20 August 1943 for duty in the Western Pacific Ocean. Steaming via Pearl Harbor, she conducted mine sweeping patrols in the Marshall and Solomon islands throughout the next year. As American amphibious forces swept over the Mariannas, she swept for mines and made reconnaissance patrols during the summer and fall of 1944. Following the conquest of the Mariannas, she returned to Pearl Harbor 25 December before sailing to the U.S. West Coast for conversion to a surveying ship. After conversion by South Coast Shipbuilding Co., Newport Beach, California, she was named Harkness and reclassified AGS-12 on 24 March 1945. The following month she returned to the Western Pacific where she conducted survey operations in the Marshalls and at Okinawa. After the end of World War II, she sailed to Japanese waters for a month of survey work. She returned to Guam from Nagoya, Japan, 4 January 1946; then sailed 10 January for the United States via the Marshalls and Pearl Harbor, reaching San Diego 26 February. She sailed 29 March for the U.S. East Coast; touched at Acapulco, Mexico, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and Norfolk, Virginia; and arrived New York 8 May.  Reclassified as AGSC-12  Following overhaul, Harkness departed 25 July for Miami, Florida, and arrived 29 July to reclassify as AGSC-12. For more than 3 years she operated out of Miami, participating in extensive ocean surveys from the Gulf of Mexico to the North Atlantic Ocean. During much of 1947 she patrolled the Mexican coast off Vera Cruz, Mexico. Harkness surveyed coastal waters off Labrador and Newfoundland from July to October 1948 and 1949; and survey work continued for the first 5 months of 1950 in the Caribbean between Trinidad and Venezuela. She returned to New York later in the year and decommissioned 22 September 1950.

Since independence in 1957, the title has been held by women, therefore the spouse is also known as the Prime Minister's wife. Some commentators have tried to style prime ministers' wives as \\"First Lady of Malaysia\\", similar to the style of First Lady used in republics, but this is not a recognised title. To date, eight women have held the title of the spouse of the Prime Minister of Malaysia. Noorainee Abdul Rahman is the spouse of the incumbent Prime Minister of Malaysia, Muhyiddin Yassin. Role of the spouse of the Prime Minister of Malaysia The spouse of the Prime Minister of Malaysia is not an elected position, carries no official duties, and brings no salary. However, she does receive some allowance as recognition of her time and energy put into being the spouse of the Prime Minister of Malaysia. As the spouse of the Prime Minister of Malaysia, she attends many official ceremonies and functions of state either along with or representing the Prime Minister. There is a strict taboo against the spouse holding outside employment while serving as spouse of the Prime Minister of Malaysia. Following the Asian value system, where the woman is the guiding light and pillar of the household, the spouse also represents family values and is taken as a motherly figure. The spouse of the Prime Minister of Malaysia frequently participates in humanitarian and charitable work. It became increasingly common for spouses of heads of state or government to select specific causes to promote, usually ones that are not politically divisive. It is common for the spouse of the Prime Minister of Malaysia to form organisations and hire a staff to support these activities.

It is argued that Article 32(2) of the Constitution of Malaysia stipulates that the Consort of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong takes precedence over all individuals in the federation and is second only to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong himself. Hence, it is argued that the Raja Permaisuri Agong is, by strict analogy only, the First Lady of Malaysia. It should however be borne in mind that such a title cannot exist in Malaysia in the first place, as \\"First Lady\\" exclusively refers to wives of presidents and not monarchs. Before Najib's premiership, there has not been a precedent in Malaysia where someone other than the wife of the Prime Minister served as a self-styled \\"First Lady\\". While the Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi's first late wife, Tun Endon Mahmood Ambak underwent treatment for breast cancer in the United States, the title of \\"First Lady\\" was not officially designated. The issue was brought up only during the premiership of Najib when his wife widely used the title of \\"First Lady\\". Many quarters either argue that it is reserved for the Raja Permaisuri Agong, or that it should never be used at all due to Malaysia not being a republic. The issue didn't stop there as there was an obscure new unit established within the Prime Minister's Department with the acronym FLOM (which was not explained on the website, but taken to stand for \\"First Lady of Malaysia\\"). Datuk Siti Azizah binti Sheikh Abod was the Special Officer for the unit. The news on FLOM was widely covered by many bloggers with their own stories and analysis. This led to the government webpage containing the information of the contacts in FLOM department to be removed a few days after the story came out. However some search engines managed to store the cached version of the page.https://archive.is/20121202133809/http://www.pmo.gov.my/?menu=page&page;=1947 First Lady of Malaysia Unit webpage Many groups questioned the validity and functionality of the department. There were also some queries, especially in the Malaysian Parliament, on how much allocation from the National Budget was allocated for the department.

Its plot follows a deranged man, subject to a medical experiment, who leaves his New York City psychiatric institute to murder his ex-wife and child in Florida. Nightmare gained instant notoriety among horror fans when it was banned in the UK as a video nasty and its distributor was sentenced to 18 months in prison for refusing to edit one second of violent footage. The film also garnered controversy for claiming in its press material that Tom Savini had provided the film's special effects, which Savini vehemently denied. Plot George Tatum has been incarcerated in a psychiatric institution in New York City for many years after sexually mutilating and murdering a family in Brooklyn. During his incarceration, George undergoes an experimental procedure that \\"reprograms\\" his brain, reforming him into an upstanding citizen. However, he remains plagued by hazy nightmares of a violent incident from his childhood. Upon his release, George visits a peep show in Times Square, which triggers flashbacks to his mother's murder. The following day, George obtains a car and leaves New York, heading south to the Florida home of his ex-wife, Susan Temper, their daughters Kim and Tammy, and their mischievous young son, C.J., who frequently plays twisted pranks that disturb both her and babysitter Kathy. His car breaks down en route in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, leaving him stranded overnight. There, he follows a woman home from a local bar, and brutally slashes her to death. Back in New York, George's psychiatrists discover he has fled the city, and begin tracking his movements. Meanwhile in Florida, Susan is carrying on a relationship with her boyfriend, Bob Rosen, and struggles with her responsibilities as a single mother. Her house begins receiving numerous disturbing phone calls, which no one realizes are in fact being made by George. One night while Susan is out, Kathy receives multiple calls, which unnerve her. C.J. begins claiming he is being followed by a strange manhis father George, unbeknownst to himbut Susan dismisses it as another of his pranks. Later, George murders two of C.J.'s classmates in an abandoned house during a game of hide-and-seek. The following day, Kathy agrees to babysit the children while Susan attends a party. During the night, George infiltrates the house and murders Kathy with a rock pick. After donning one of C.J.'s Halloween masks, George pursues the children, who have barricaded themselves in the upstairs bedrooms. C.J. obtains a revolver from his mother's dresser, and uses it to shoot George multiple times, eventually killing him. As he lies dying, George has a full recall of his childhood, including a memory of catching his father engaging in sadomasochistic sex acts with another woman, during which he brutally murdered them both with a felling axe. Susan returns home to find police at her house removing George's body while C.J., sitting in a police car, winks into the camera knowingly. Cast * Baird Stafford as George Tatum * Sharon Smith as Susan Temper * C.J. Cooke as C.J. Temper * Mik Cribben as Bob Rosen * Danny Ronan as Kathy * Tammy Patterson as Tammy Temper * Kim Patterson as Kim Temper * Kathleen Ferguson as Barbara Production Scavolini was inspired to write the screenplay for the film after reading articles in Time and Newsweek concerning psychiatric patients who had been administered powerful drugs that altered their behavior. He wrote the screenplay while visiting friends in Cocoa Beach, Florida, over a period of 15 days. Scavolini recalled: \\"[I was] trying to tell a story and not just hit the stomach of the viewers. To hit the spectator's stomach, you need to tell a story that has its roots in reality, not in fantasy. The massacre of the father and mother by the young Tatum is not the explosion of a mental disorder but flows from the inability of him to \\"understand\\" that his parents love to have sex through sadomasochistic practices...In my film there is no hope, because the real and final message is that we are all at the mercy of our demons.\\" The film was also influenced by Scavolini's earlier work in hardcore pornography, which could explain the amount of extraneous nudity and the bare context behind the bloodletting that the film contains. Filming took place in Cocoa Beach, Florida, with additional photography in New York City. Special effects One review published on the film's opening day opined that \\"the bloodshed has been rendered with loving attention to detail.\\" Tom Savini receives a credit for providing special effects on the film, though during its release he would vehemently deny involvement. According to director Scavolini, artists Daryll Ferrucci, Ed French, Johane Hansen, and Robin Stevens were responsible for prosthetic effects, crafting the dummies used as corpses in the film; they receive credit as \\"special effects makeup artist\\" and \\"special effects makeup assistant.\\" This work was completed in New York City, according to Scavolini. On set, however, Scavolini claims that Savini was present and oversaw the directing of all master special effects sequences, including the beheading scene of George's mother and father. Scavolini stated it was \\"incontrovertible\\" that Savini contributed to the film, and added: \\"I never understood why [he] has denied having worked on the set,\\" though he suggested it may have been a result of a salary disagreement between Savini and Goldmine Productions. Actor Baird Stafford confirmed Savini's presence on the set in a 2014 interview. Photographs of Savini on the film set also corroborate his presence there. Cleve Hall, a then-inexperienced local artist, managed the crew of the film's special effects at the Florida locations. Hall's recollection of Savini's connection to the picture was that the filmmakers had initially wanted Savini to oversee all of the special effects; Savini, however, recommended his friend Ed French for the project, but French opted not to sign on. Release=Theatrical distribution Prior to receiving distribution through 21st Century Film Corporation, Warner Bros. and Universal Pictures screened the film, expressing potential interest, but only agreed to purchase it for distribution contingent on the film's gore sequences being significantly truncated. Scavolini refused, as he felt \\"the strongest scenes had to remain uncut because the film should be a scandalous event.\\" 21st Century Film Corporation purchased the film for distribution, though it was released with an X rating in 117 New York theaters on October 23, 1981. Censorship In the United Kingdom, Nightmare was labeled a \\"video nasty\\" and prosecuted for violation of the Obscene Publications Act 1959; of the 72 films named \\"video nasties,\\" it was the only title to receive prosecution and have its distributor spend time incarcerated. This government action led to a black market for the film where the cost reached .  Critical response  Janet Maslin of The New York Times gave the film an unfavorable review, noting: \\"Though everything else about Nightmare is amateurish, and though its surprises are dependably unsurprising, the bloodshed has been rendered with a loving attention to detail. Garotting, slicing, puncturing and chopping are filmed at close range and accompanied by gurgling sounds. Mr. Scavolini, who does nothing here to advance this currently fashionable art form, also favors the trick whereby an ostensible scare turns out to be a practical joke.\\" TV Guide was critical of the film, noting: \\"Given its earnest claims to Freudian psychological complexity, this pretentious gorefest (recipient of a self- imposed X rating) would be laughable if it weren't so repulsive.\\"  References Works cited * *  External links   Category:Obscenity controversies in film Category:English-language films Category:American serial killer films Category:1981 horror films Category:1980s slasher films Category:American slasher films Category:American films Category:1981 films Category:Films about nightmares Category:Video nasties ","title":"Nightmare (1981 film)"},{"id":"13379154","text":"Toomas Helin (born 24 April 1966 in P√§rnu) is an Estonian drug smuggler.

Content  It was written by an Arya Samaji named Pandit M. A. Chamupati or Krishan Prashaad Prataab in 1927, whose name however was never revealed by the publisher, Mahashe Rajpal of Lahore. It was a retaliatory action from the Hindu community against a pamphlet published by a Muslim denigrating the Hindu goddess Sita.Ambedkar, Babasaheb, \\"Thoughts on Pakistan\\", pg. 165 On the basis of Muslim complaints, Rajpal was arrested but acquitted in April 1929 after a five-year trial because there was no law against insult to religion.

Response  The allegations of Rangila Rasul were addressed by the Muslim Qazi Maulana Sanaullah Amritsari in his book Muqaddas Rasool (The Holy Prophet). In 1927, under pressure from the Muslim community, the administration of the British Raj enacted Hate Speech Law Section 295(A), a part of the Criminal Law Amendment Act XXV.

Its capital was at Alexandria, and its governor had the unique title of praefectus augustalis (\\"Augustal Prefect\\", of the rank vir spectabilis; previously the governor of the imperial 'crown domain' province Egypt) instead of the ordinary vicarius. The diocese was initially part of the Diocese of the East, but in ca. 380, it became a separate entity, which lasted until its territories were finally overrun by the Muslim conquest of Egypt in the 640s.  Administrative history  Egypt was formed into a separate diocese in about 381. According to the Notitia Dignitatum, which for the Eastern part of the Empire dates to ca. 401, the diocese came under a vicarius of the praetorian prefecture of the East, with the title of praefectus augustalis, and included six provinces:Notitia Dignitatum, in partibus Orientis, I * Aegyptus (western Nile delta), originally established in the early 4th century as Aegyptus Iovia, under a praeses * Augustamnica (eastern Nile delta), originally established in the early 4th century as Aegyptus Herculia, under a corrector * Arcadia (central), established ca. 397 and having previously briefly listed in the 320s as Aegyptus Mercuria, under a praeses * Thebais (southern), under a praeses * Libya Inferior or Libya Sicca, under a praeses * Libya Superior or Pentapolis, under a praeses Parallel to the civil administration, the Roman army in Egypt had been placed under a single general and military governor styled dux (dux Aegypti et Thebaidos utrarumque Libyarum) in the Tetrarchy. Shortly after the creation of Egypt as a separate diocese (between 384 and 391), the post evolved into the comes limitis Aegypti, who was directly responsible for Lower Egypt, while the subordinate dux Thebaidis was in charge of Upper Egypt (Thebais). In the middle of the 5th century, however, the latter was also promoted to the rank of comes (comes Thebaici limitis). The two officers were responsible for the limitanei (border garrison) troops stationed in the province, while until the time of Anastasius I the comitatenses field army came under the command of the magister militum per Orientem, and the palatini (guards) under the two magistri militum praesentales in Constantinople. The comes limitis Aegypti enjoyed great power and influence in the diocese, rivalling that of the praefectus augustalis himself. From the 5th century, the comes is attested as exercising some civilian duties as well, and from 470 on, the offices of comes and praefectus augustalis were sometimes combined in a single person. This tendency to unite civil and military authority was formalized by Justinian I in his 539 reform of Egyptian administration. The diocese was effectively abolished, and regional ducats established, where the presiding dux et augustalis was placed above the combined civil and military authority: * dux et augustalis Aegypti, controlling Aegyptus I and Aegyptus II * dux et augustalis Thebaidis, controlling Thebais superior and Thebais inferior * Augustamnica I and Augustamnica II were likewise probably ‚Äî the relevant portion of the edict is defective ‚Äî were placed under a single dux et augustalis * in the two Libyan provinces, the civil governors were subordinated to the respective dux * Arcadia remained under its praeses, probably subordinated to the dux et augustalis Thebaidos, and a dux et augustalis Arcadiae does not appear until after the Persian occupation of 619‚Äì629.

While still in the Mid-South region, he continued to appear on Superdome Extravaganza events teaming with Vladimir Petrov against the then NWA Tag Team Champions The Rock 'n' Roll Express on June 13, 1987.  Jim Crockett Promotions / World Championship Wrestling (1987-1991)  He also began wrestling for Jim Crockett Promotions during the mid-1980s, teaming with Big Bubba Rogers and manager Skandor Akbar against UWF Tag Team Champions The Lightning Express at the Great American Bash '87 on July 31, 1987. He also competed in Dallas-based independent promotions early in his career including World Class Championship Wrestling later losing to The Missing Link and Jason Sterling in a tag team match with Vince Apollo and later participated in a \\"triple dome Texas roundup\\" match at the last WCCW Parade of Champions supercard on May 8, 1988. Returning to Jim Crockett Promotions as one half of the Russian Assassins with Jack Victory, he and Victory feuded with Ivan Koloff who had left Paul Jones' Army during late 1988 eventually defeating Koloff and Junkyard Dog at Starrcade '88. Returning to Stampede Wrestling in mid 1989, he wrestled against Kim Schau, Ron Ritchie and Eddie Watts before the promotion closed later that year. In 1990, he was awarded the WCCW Texas Heavyweight Championship by forfeit from then champion Kerry Von Erich in Dallas, Texas on July 13, although he lost the title to Kevin Von Erich four months later on November 23, 1990. In August 1990, while competing in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), Sheldon also began wrestling as \\"The Black Scorpion\\" at house shows. The identity of The Black Scorpion, speculated by announcers at the time to have been a former friend of Sting, was hinted to be as one of several wrestlers then competing in World Championship Wrestling including The Angel of Death, having been a former training partner of Sting while a part of Powerteam USA several years before. While wrestling as The Black Scorpion during that time, the character who eventually wrestled Sting was Al Perez (and at the conclusion of the storyline was eventually revealed to be longtime rival Ric Flair at Starrcade 1990) by the time of their first encounter at Clash of the Champions XII on September 5, 1990.  Late career (1991-2000)  During the early 1990s, Sheldon continued wrestling in Texas independent promotions winning the TWF Tag team titles with Abdullah the Butcher in 1990, although they eventually lost the belts to Steve Austin and \\"The California Studd\\" Rod Price on November 11, 1990. Following the close of WCCW in January 1991, he lost to Kevin Von Erich on February 23 in a match for the vacant WCCW Texas Heavyweight Championship recognized by the now defunct Texas Wrestling Federation before it closed three months later. Later aligning himself with Kevin Sullivan and One Man Gang, the three attacked El Gigante following his match against Tony Mella before Ron Simmons ran in chasing the three out of the ring during a televised WCW event in Dothan, Alabama on May 11, 1991. The next week he appeared on WCW Saturday Night, attacking Ron Simmons as Simmons had a match the following evening against Butch Reed, another of Teddy Long's charges. While in the Global Wrestling Federation, he teamed with Eddie Gilbert in his feud with Big Bad John facing Big Bad John in tag team matches with Dark Patriot on April 10 and Barry Horowitz on April 17 in a steel cage match resulting in a no contest. Turning against Gilbert, he was later defeated by Gilbert, John Tatum and Rod Price in a 6-man tag team match with Horowitz and Johnny Mantell on April 24, 1992.

News was taken off WCW television for the remainder of his contract and eventually released from the company). Wrestling sporadically in the promotion during the 1990s, he occasionally appeared on WCW Saturday Night. Sheldon retired in 2000 after suffering a leg injury.  Death  It was reported that Sheldon was found dead in Bedford, Texas in November 2007. He was found on his couch with the TV remote in his hand. His body was claimed by his \\"little sister\\", Missy Evans, a close friend for more than 20 years. He did not have close family living near him but a sister that he had not spoken to in more than 20 years was said to be living in Miami at the time of this death.

It is constructed with a stainless steel blade and titanium handle. Its handle functions as the lock mechanism similar in concept to the Walker linerlock differing in that the handle itself forms the lock bar which holds the blade open. This mechanism was invented by Chris Reeve, and is called the Reeve Integral Lock (R.I.L). It is also commonly referred to as the Framelock, and is one of the most widely implemented locking systems in the folding knife industry, where lock strength and reliability is a product requirement. The name Sebenza is derived from the Zulu word meaning \\"Work,\\" a tribute to Mr. Reeve's South African origins.  Design and history  A small Sebenza cutting a knot There are currently two size models of the Sebenza 31, small and large. The Small 31 has a 2.99\\" (76.17mm) blade and the Large 31 has a 3.61\\" (91.69mm) blade. First introduced in 1990, the current basic model has a sand-blasted titanium handle and a stonewashed finish CPM S35VN steel blade. There are numerous options for the embellishment of the Sebenza's titanium handles, such as computer-generated graphics, custom (unique) graphics, or inlays such as exotic wood, micarta, or mammoth ivory. Originally the Chris Reeve Sebenza was available with a blade of ATS-34 steel. In 1996, the blade material was changed to BG-42 blade steel, and later in 2001, the Sebenza blade material transitioned to CPM S30V steel. CPM S30V was developed by Crucible Steel with the collaboration of Chris Reeve. Damascus steel blades are also available as an option on the Sebenza. Since 2012, all Chris Reeve knives have transitioned to CPM S35VN steel. A feature of the Sebenza that is highly praised by users is the ease of maintenance, as CRK actually encourages the customer to disassemble and maintain the knife by including a hex wrench, as well as small tube of fluorinated grease (to lubricate the pivot) and a tube of Loctite (for screws) in the box. Another feature of the Sebenza is the use of a bushing system around the blade's pivot that keeps the blade at a constant tight fit which is always centered. This bushing allows the user to tighten the pivot screw completely without having to manually adjust the pivot tension. As of May 2008, the two production models‚Äîthe Regular and Classic Sebenza models‚Äîwere discontinued and replaced by the 'Sebenza 21' (named so as to commemorate the 21st year of the Sebenza's production). The Sebenza 21 is based upon the previous Classic's design, and differs from the Classic only in small details. At the 2012 Blade Show the 'Sebenza 25' (named so as to commemorate the 25th year of the Sebenza's production) was introduced. Significant changes include a more sculpted handle, the introduction of a ceramic ball lockup/detent system and the use of 'Large Hollow Grind Technology\\" on the blade grind. The 21 model continues in production as well. The 'Sebenza 25' was discontinued in mid-2016 and replaced by the Inkosi which shares many similarities with the 25 but with additional refinements. In 2019, Chris Reeve Knives released the Sebenza 31, replacing the 21. This model featured minor improvements again, similar to the 25. Most notably the ceramic lockbar interface and a new inlay design. Additionally, a hole has been removed from the handles, and the pocket clip is slightly offset so that it no longer rests on the lockbar.

It was developed by EA Black Box and released in 2007. Two sequels, Skate 2 and Skate 3, have been released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, as well as Skate It, a spin-off for Wii, Nintendo DS and iOS platforms. In June 2020, EA announced plans for a new Skate game. Development The game's \\"flick it\\" control system began development long before any graphics had been implemented: the initial prototype simply read analogue stick motions and displayed a basic text message saying what trick had been performed, along with speed and accuracy ratings. The developers found that in order to receive accurate information from the very fast analogue stick motions used when playing the game, input data from each control pad had to be read at a rate of 120 Hz. The game relies extensively on physics to model the skateboarders' movement. Havok, Endorphin and others were considered, but ultimately a RenderWare package called \\"Drives\\" was used to model the joints of the human body. Initially the development team planned to include the ability for the player to get off of the skateboard and walk around, but animating this proved to be too big a challenge for the team to handle. Similarly the developers also wanted players to be able to play as a girl but this was also discarded after proving tough to animate. Evidence from different versions of EA's official website for Skate show that the game has been through some major changes in development. For example, one screenshot, dated \\"04/06/2007\\", shows that San Vanelona was originally planned to be a coastal city, featuring a football stadium, harbour and cruise liner. Major changes were also made to the soundtrack. Originally planned to feature \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" by The Doors, the soundtrack now focuses more heavily on hip-hop. Some songs appear in both studio and remixed form. The demo was scheduled for release on Xbox Live for August 15, 2007 but was delayed (as stated by Scott Blackwood on the Skate forum) due to a sudden problem with the demo's Skate Reel (video editing) feature, releasing on August 21, 2007. It was released on PlayStation Network in September 2007. The demo let players skate around the San Vanelona Community Center for thirty minutes and learn how to do various tricks as well as create and edit videos. Mobile version The mobile version of Skate features two game modes: Thrasher Mode (the main game mode, in which the player completes goals to make the cover of skateboarding magazine Thrasher) and Free Skate (where the player can play on levels previously unlocked in Thrasher Mode). The player plays as a customized skater, who receives tips from pro skaters Chris Cole and Rob Dyrdek, among others, through twelve missions divided in four goals each. Though the game is still set in San Vanelona, there are only three explorable areas: Plaza, Halfpipe and Downtown, aside from linear levels only playable in Thrasher Mode. The mobile version of Skate later won \\"Cellular Game of the Year\\" award at the 2008 Interactive Achievement Awards.  Reception  Skate received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews from critics on both platforms according to review aggregator Metacritic. Praise was given to the environments, control scheme, and soundtrack. Criticisms included latency issues with the online multiplayer, odd physics glitches, and the lack of freestyle tricks in both the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game (although it is possible to do lip tricks because of the unique grind engine built into the game). The reviews praised the game for a good start and innovation, but the game was criticized for the in-game advertising and product placement. GameSpy praised the Xbox 360 version for the control scheme, presentation, expansive environments, audio, and amount of content. It was criticized for the learning curve, frustrating camera, and the slowdown in online game modes. In Japan, where the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions were ported for release on March 19, 2008, Famitsu gave both console versions each a score of two eights, one seven, and one eight for a total of 31 out of 40. The New York Times gave the game universal acclaim, saying that \\"While Skate has some small flaws (it would have been a good idea to make your skater translucent whenever he blocks something important on screen), it is rare to find a game that comes so close to doing everything right.\\" Digital Spy gave the Xbox 360 version four stars out of five and called it \\"a superb example of how an extreme sports game should be done.\\" However, The A.V. Club gave the game a C+, saying: \\"A technically strong game tailored to hardcore skaters (and people up for a really serious challenge), this one will alienate casual gamers, as the learning curve can be excruciating.\\" Sequels In February 2008, EA president Frank Gibeau stated in a presentation for industry analysts that the original game posted bigger numbers on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 than rival Tony Hawk's Proving Ground. Because of these numbers, the company had decided to begin work on a sequel. Skate 2 was officially announced in May 2008 and was released at the end of January 2009. In September 2009, EA announced the third installment in the Skate franchise, Skate 3, which was released on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in May 2010. The game is set in a new fictional city called Port Carverton. New gameplay features include the ability to perform dark slides and underflips. Skate 3 has a stronger emphasis on content creation and online team play than the previous games. A fourth installment for the eighth generation of video game consoles has been eagerly awaited by fans. On EA's Instagram page, users consistently comment on posts begging developers to make Skate 4. In September 2016, skateboarding park The Berrics launched a campaign to get EA to develop Skate 4. In the campaign the park uses the slogan \\"Make EA Skate Again\\", which is a parody on Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign slogan. At the June 2020 EA Play event, a new Skate title was confirmed to be in development.

He is portrayed by Shane Bourne. He appeared in the pilot episode and was considered to be the main character of the series throughout the first two seasons, as shown through Bourne's top billing in the show's credits. However, early in season three, the character of Wolfe went on extended leave from Homicide and thus Bourne only appeared in six episodes of the 18-episode third season (though he still received top billing throughout this period). He would later return to the show in the season four premiere, albeit in a slightly reduced role that only required him to appear in 22 of the fourth season's 24 episodes. It is revealed in episode one that Detective Senior Sergeant Wolfe is a religious man, strongly upholding the beliefs of a practicing Catholic. This particularly causes a fear amongst one of Stanley's team members, Simon Joyner, who is busted having an affair with another Senior Sergeant's wife, and is concerned that his boss will punish him for his 'ungodly' behaviour. Stanley appears to be friends with Bernice Waverley. His team includes Senior Detectives Duncan Freeman, Jennifer Mapplethorpe, Matt Ryan, Allie Kingston, Nick Buchanan and Rhys Levitt. From what we have seen, it appears that Stanley prefers to be called 'Stanley' as opposed to the shortened 'Stan', in accordance with his perceived 'proper' nature. Even those close to him, i.e. his wife call him Stanley. His team refer to him as both 'Sarge' and 'Wolfey'. Stanley's wife, Linda, has appeared to date in a few episodes, and it has been revealed that he has two girls. Stanley's goddaughter was recently murdered and Stanley went to great lengths to find her killer, which he succeeded in doing. In the first season it was revealed that Stanley and his wife had a son who died while stillborn. This appears to be a traumatic thing for Stanley as he avoided the topic when his wife tried to talk about it. From here we learn it is not in Stanley's nature to overtly discuss his feelings with those around him, as he acts reserved regarding his feelings even towards his wife. Early in the second season, it is suggested that Linda is having an affair with another man, and after keeping a close eye on his wife's movements, Stanley's suspicions are found to be true, when he discovers her to be in the company of another man. He responds to his findings by burying himself in his work, and staying late at the office more frequently as a means of avoiding contact with his wife. However, when Linda visits him at a homicide one evening, the two leave the building to talk, and a conflict erupts between the two regarding the troubled marriage. At this point, Stanley yells at her and exclaims his disgust at her affair, and how it goes against their religious beliefs. Here, in the street, Linda tells him that she is leaving and taking the children ‚Äì his family have not been mentioned any further thus far, but it is assumed that at some point Stanley's separation and children will be brought back into the picture. To date, these unfortunate events haven't appeared to be affecting his work. It is posited by Stanley's wife that the reason for her affair was as a result of Stanley never being home, primarily because of the nature of his work. Reception Farah Farouque from The Age called Stanley \\"one of the show's triumvirate of standout characters\\". The Sunshine Coast Daily's Nathanael Cooper praised Bourne's performance, saying he was \\"surprisingly powerful in a dramatic role ‚Äì far from the comedy parts we are familiar seeing him in.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Character profile at Yahoo!7 *Character profile at TV Week *Character profile at the Internet Movie Database Category:City Homicide characters Category:Fictional Australian police detectives Category:Fictional police sergeants ","title":"Stanley Wolfe"},{"id":"13379372","text":"Trousdale Place is a historic mansion in Gallatin, Sumner County, Tennessee.

It had a population of 3,656 people as of January 2020. History=Livonian Crusade Territory of the modern Kandava was inhabited by Finnic tribes until 10th century when Curonian expansion to the north started. Settlement grew around Kandava hillfort which was important centre in the curonian land of Vanema. As a settlement (villa Candowe), it is first mentioned in 1230 in a peace treaty between the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, citizens of Riga and the Curonian residents of the Abava valley. Local residents kept their lands but were forced to accept Christianity, pay annual tribute and participate in crusading campaigns against pagans. However, after several uprisings, a new treaty was signed between Livonian Order and Bishopric of Courland in 1253 and lands of the Vanema was partitioned. Its southern portion including Kandava became property of Livonian Order. Livonian Confederation A military castle was built around 1257, but it was gradually dismantled over the years and now only its foundations can be seen in a town park. The oldest remaining structure is a guard tower built in 1334 and later used for gunpowder storage. In 1312 Kandava castle became residence of the vogt and administrative centre of the former land of Vanema. In the 16th century there is church, school and tavern mentioned in the Kandava. Duchy of Courland and Semigallia In the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia Kandava became centre of Hauptmannshaft Candau. Kandava received village rights in 1625. During the reign of duke Jacob Kettler, several manufactures was established around Kandava. In the village there was a flax weaving mill and a gun powder mill where gunpowder was manufactured from local brimstone and saltpeter. During this period, the population in Kandava reached 1000 people. Further development was stopped by the Second Northern War when Swedes sacked and destroyed Kandava Castle. During the Great Northern War, Swedes again destroyed the castle in 1703. In 1710, a plague epidemic started and from 600 residents, only several craftsman survived. During the 18th century, Kandava castle lost its military significance. In 1730, two schools were opened in the village and in 1736, a new church was built. Courland Governorate When the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia were annexed by the Russian Empire in 1795, there were only 439 residents in Kandava. In 1799, Jews were allowed to settle in the village. In 1812, Kandava was occupied for a short period by the army of Napoleon. During the 19th century, Kandava saw rapid development, and in 1892, there were already 2100 residents in the village. As a result, Kandava received limited town rights and its first town council was elected in 1893. In 1904, the Riga - Ventspils railway line was constructed near the town. During the revolution of 1905, Kandava was taken over by a local workers committee for a month. In 1914, there were 2300 residents in the town and 4000 in the rural territory around it. There were a town school, water mill, power station, a lime kiln and several sawmills in Kandava. After the start of the First World War, 75% of the town population fled from the advancing German army to Vidzeme or further east into Russia. However, during the German occupation Kandava was granted full town rights in 1917. Later history During the Latvian War of Independence, Kandava was occupied by the Red Army and later by the Baltic German Landeswehr. In 1920, there were 1045 residents in Kandava. During the 1920s and 1930s there were a post office, a telephone exchange, a court and two primary schools in Kandava. After the Second World War, Kandava became part of the Latvian SSR. A technical school of agriculture was established in the town in 1945. In 1963, a branch of the Riga Radio factory was established in the town. Today, Kandava counts several woodworking enterprises.

It was founded in 2006 at Los Altos High School in the San Francisco Bay Area by history and economics teacher Robert Freeman and science teacher Lisa Cardellini. ODFL works with qualified Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs) in the developing world to fund and implement such projects as schools, water wells, irrigation systems, sanitary waste disposal, vaccinations, and other simple, low cost projects. These projects have the potential to dramatically improve the capacity for self-sustenance for tens of millions of people. History One Dollar For Life was founded in 2006 at Los Altos High School (Los Altos, California) during an economics class. The class was asked to devise a plan to help people around the world, and the idea of ODFL was born. ‚ÄúThe average kid in our school contributed 93 cents each, but these kids put an average of $11 apiece into the box,‚Äù says Robert Freeman. ‚ÄúIt made me cry because these were the poorest kids in the school. But they understood how important it is to help someone else.‚Äù The organization became a reality in 2007 when students began campaigning within the school through a class-to-class speaking tour. Throughout the school year, they managed to raise $9,000 at Los Altos High School, which they used on the summer of 2007 in Kenya to build a schoolhouse, a project spearheaded by student president Mandeep Chahal, and advertised by student photographer Margaret Lewis. Impact and projects ODFL works to help install small infrastructure projects, such as water wells, irrigation systems, sanitary waste disposal systems, and similar such projects that have a low cost but a high impact on small villages. Its maiden project was the construction of a school in Naro Moru, Kenya, which cost $9,400 to build. The schoolhouse was furnished with materials to help educate fifty children who previously learned in a barn house. Since then, the organization has sent 452 bikes to children in Kenya whose homes were located far from the local schools,Wheels of Wonder Retrieved March 26, 2008 as well as the donation of milk cows, the construction of two more schools in various other locations in Kenya, and an upgrade for a woman's clinic in Nairobi. Besides Kenya, ODFL volunteers in partnership with the Nepalese Youth Opportunity Foundation have additionally constructed schools in Nepal, and prevented young girls from being sold into sexual slavery by donating livestock to their parents instead of prostitution money. They have also aided the local Second Harvest Food Bank chapter by raising 4,000 pounds of canned food. The organization has also worked with school-based clubs at Los Altos, Mountain View, and Fremont High Schools to raise money and aide the relief efforts in China following the Sichuan earthquake. They donated $3,000 to the Red Cross. ODFL's largest project was announced on January 2009, a plan that involves the entire population of the city of Burlingame, which includes 25,000 people. The plan to raise at least $18,000 in one month and send them to Kasimu Education Fund in order to construct two-room high school in a village where they previously built a secondary school. Funding ODFL works with students at American high schools. They run a fund raiser at their school where they ask each student to give Just One Dollar. ODFL takes these funds and combines them with other schools‚Äô funds to pay for the projects. Each school is able to follow the progress of its funds to see how they have helped improve the lives of other people. Throughout 2007‚Äì2008, ODFL plans to complete 2-5 more projects along with completing fund raisers at 50-100 more schools. Reaction The organization was described as part of a \\"generation of post-9/11 children\\". San Francisco Chronicle hypothesized that it was a direct result of them being \\"the first set of students to be taught by teachers who were required to do community service in order to get a high school diploma.\\" Macheru Karuku, a Kenyan official who oversaw the numerous school-building campaigns throughout Kenya was afraid that the volunteers might act negatively, and was \\"encouraged when I talked with them later and they realized how lucky they were to be living in good houses back in America, adding that they would never forget what they had seen.\\" Because of the enormous need of American teenagers to \\"find a purpose larger than themselves,\\" as described by ODFL, students from an Arizona high school have rebuilt a school in post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans, while high schools from Florida and New York have requested fundraiser boxes to host in their respective schools. Jody Hare, a teacher at West High School remarked the speed and efficiency in which the projects were completed, saying \\"Within three months of the fundraiser we could see pictures of what our students‚Äô money was doing.\\" Students have also expressed gratitude to the organization, saying, \\"I‚Äôve never been able to feel I could actually do good in the world. Now I can see that I can.\\" ReferencesExternal links *ODFL Home Page *Official Facebook page Category:Non-profit organizations based in California ","title":"One Dollar For Life"},{"id":"13379498","text":"General elections were held in Malta on 26 October 1996.Dieter Nohlen & Philip St√∂ver (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p1302 Although the Malta Labour Party received the most votes, the Nationalist Party won the most seats.

The screenplay, adapted from the 2004 novel of the same name by Karen Joy Fowler, focuses on a book club formed specifically to discuss the six novels written by Jane Austen. As they delve into Austen's literature, the club members find themselves dealing with life experiences that parallel the themes of the books they are reading. Plot The book club is the brainchild of fiftysomething six-time divorc√©e Bernadette (Kathy Baker), who develops the idea when she meets Prudie (Emily Blunt), a prim, married high school French teacher in her mid-20s, at a Jane Austen film festival. Bernadette plans to have six members discuss all of Austen's six novels, with each member hosting the group once a month. Also inducted into the club are Sylvia (Amy Brenneman), a fortysomething librarian recently separated from her philandering lawyer husband Daniel (Jimmy Smits) after over two decades of marriage; Sylvia's 20-something lesbian daughter Allegra (Maggie Grace); Jocelyn (Maria Bello), a happily unmarried control freak and breeder of Rhodesian Ridgebacks, and Sylvia's friend since childhood; and Grigg (Hugh Dancy), a science fiction fan invited into the group by Jocelyn with the hope to match him with Sylvia. As the months pass, each of the members develops characteristics similar to those of Austen's characters, and reacts to events in their lives similarly to their fictional counterparts. Bernadette is the matriarchal figure who longs to see everyone find happiness. Sylvia clings to her belief in steadfast love and devotion (eventually reconciling with Daniel). Jocelyn denies her own feelings for Grigg while playing matchmaker for him and Sylvia. Prudie is encumbered with her inattentive husband Dean (Marc Blucas), and free-spirited, marijuana-smoking, aging hippie mother Mama Sky (Lynn Redgrave), who dies in a car accident; Prudie finds herself desperately trying to resist her feelings for seductive student Trey (Kevin Zegers), meanwhile accusing Dean of coming on to her high- school acquaintance at Mama Sky's funeral. Allegra, who tends to meet her lovers while engaging in death-defying activities, feels betrayed because her current partner, aspiring writer Corinne (Parisa Fitz-Henley), has used Allegra's life as the basis for her short stories. Grigg is attracted to Jocelyn and mystified by her seeming lack of interest in him, marked by her failure to read the Ursula Le Guin novels he hoped would interest her. He also serves as the comedic foil to Jocelyn's and Prudie's very serious takes on the books. The last meeting is held at the beach. Daniel wants to join the book club after reading Persuasion with Allegra at the hospital (after Allegra suffered a concussion from an indoor climbing accident); Sylvia lets Daniel in. Grigg brings his elder sister Cat Harris (Nancy Travis), who persuades Jocelyn to take a chance on Grigg because he loves her. Allegra brings Dr. Yep (Gwendoline Yeo), who treated her concussion. Prudie, the scheduled host, does not attend; she goes to meet Trey, but reconsiders after considering what Jane Austen would do. Prudie goes home to Dean and reads Persuasion with him, helping them rediscover their love. Daniel leaves a letter for Sylvia at her doorstep; upon reading it, she accepts Daniel back. Jocelyn finally reads the books Grigg gave to her, is surprised to find that she loves them, cannot sleep, and finishes them. She drives to Grigg's house, realises the very early time, and snoozes in her car. When Grigg exits his house, he sees Jocelyn's car and knocks on her window. Jocelyn finally gives in to her feelings and they both passionately kiss. One year later, the book club meets at Sylvia's library charity dinner. Grigg and Jocelyn are together; Sylvia and Daniel have reconciled; Prudie, who is pregnant, attends with Dean (who appears more enthusiastic about Austen); and Bernadette introduces her (seventh) husband. Cast * Maria Bello as Jocelyn * Emily Blunt as Prudie * Kathy Baker as Bernadette * Hugh Dancy as Grigg * Amy Brenneman as Sylvia * Maggie Grace as Allegra * Jimmy Smits as Daniel * Marc Blucas as Dean * Lynn Redgrave as Mama Sky * Kevin Zegers as Trey * Nancy Travis as Cat Harris * Parisa Fitz-Henley as Corinne * Gwendoline Yeo as Dr. Samantha Yep * Myndy Crist as Lynne Production In The Book Club Deconstructed, a bonus feature on the DVD release of the film, screenwriter/director Robin Swicord explains how each of the six book club members is based on a character in one of Austen's novels. Bernadette represents Mrs. Gardiner in Pride and Prejudice, Sylvia is patterned after Fanny Price in Mansfield Park, Jocelyn reflects the title character in Emma, Prudie is similar to Anne Elliot in Persuasion, Allegra is most like Marianne in Sense and Sensibility, and Grigg represents all of Austen's misunderstood male characters. Although the film is set in Sacramento, it was shot in Southern California. Filming locations included Encino, Lakewood, Long Beach, Los Angeles, North Hollywood, Northridge, Santa Clarita, Santa Monica, Van Nuys, and Westlake Village. Music The soundtrack includes \\"New Shoes\\" by Paolo Nutini, \\"You're All I Have\\" by Snow Patrol, \\"Save Me\\" by Aimee Mann, \\"So Sorry\\" by Feist, and \\"Getting Some Fun Out of Life\\" by Madeleine Peyroux. Release The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival before going into limited release in the US. It opened on 25 screens on September 21, 2007 and earned $148,549 on its opening weekend. It went into wide release on October 5, expanding to 1,232 screens and earning an additional $1,343,596 that weekend. It eventually grossed $3,575,227 in the US and $3,542,527 in international markets for a worldwide box office of $7,163,566. Critical reception , the film holds a 66% approval rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 116 reviews with an average rating of 6.08/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"Though at times formulaic and sentimental, Jane Austen Book Club succeeds on the strength of its likable ensemble cast. Even those not familiar with Jane Austen's work may find much to enjoy this lighthearted romance.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100, based on 28 reviews. Stephen Holden of The New York Times said the film \\"is such a well-acted, literate adaptation of Karen Joy Fowler's 2004 best seller that your impulse is to forgive it for being the formulaic, feel-good chick flick that it is ... Like the other movies and television projects in a Jane Austen boom that continues to gather momentum, it is an entertaining, carefully assembled piece of clockwork that imposes order on ever more complicated gender warfare.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called the film \\"a celebration of reading\\" and added, \\"oddly enough that works ... I settled down with this movie as with a comfortable book. I expected no earth-shaking revelations and got none, and everything turned out about right, in a clockwork ending that reminded me of the precision the Victorians always used to tidy up their loose ends.\\" Ruthe Stein of the San Francisco Chronicle called the film \\"enjoyable if fairly predictable ... It's all a tad too neatly packaged, like a brand new set of Austen with the bindings unbroken. Still, a lively ensemble cast works hard ... Swicord's gift as a screenwriter is that her catch-up summaries avoid sounding pedantic or like CliffsNotes. She's less assured as a director. Her pacing is off, with some scenes going on longer than they need to and others whizzing by so fast you miss the nuances. Relationships aren't always as clear as they should be. Still, Austen devotees are sure to lap up the central premise that her notions of love and friendship are as relevant today as ever. And if The Jane Austen Book Club gets people thinking about forming a club of their own, it will have served a more admirable purpose than most movies.\\" Carina Chocano of the Los Angeles Times said it was nice to see \\"a movie so alive to the pleasures of reading and writing and sharing books, especially when the love feels sincere ... in parts, the story feels awkwardly truncated or too shallow to matter. But Swicord has a playful sense of humor and a good ear for dialogue, and the movie pleasantly accomplishes what it set out to accomplish.\\" Dennis Harvey of Variety stated, \\"While there are occasional forced notes ... Swicord's direction proves as accomplished as her script at handling an incident-packed story with ease, capturing humor and drama sans cheap laughs or tearjerking.\\" Claudia Puig of USA Today wrote: \\"This is Austen lite, but pleasantly so. You can hardly fault a movie that fashions itself around a consummate writer whose keen sense of humor and gift for fully realized characters have resulted in countless screen adaptations.\\" ReferencesExternal links  * Category:2007 films Category:2007 directorial debut films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:American LGBT-related films Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films set in California Category:Lesbian-related films Category:2007 romantic drama films Category:Sony Pictures Classics films Category:American romantic drama films Category:Films about bibliophilia Category:Films about books Category:Films directed by Robin Swicord Category:Films with screenplays by Robin Swicord Category:Works about Jane Austen Category:2007 drama films ","title":"The Jane Austen Book Club (film)"},{"id":"13379538","text":"Chris Freeman (born Christopher Mark Freeman, August 8, 1961 in Seattle, Washington) is an American bassist, best known as a member of the band Pansy Division.

Biography Howard Simpson was born on 8 May 1892 in Kalamazoo, Michigan, the son of John Robert Bruce Simpson, a carriage maker who was a superintendent for the Fisher Body Company. The Simpsons moved to Detroit in 1902. Simpson graduated from Detroit Central High School in 1910 and entered an apprenticeship program at Cadillac Motor Company. He attended the University of Michigan, graduating in 1917 with a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering. Simpson volunteered for military service during World War I, but was rejected owing to poor eyesight. He served as a civilian employee in the U.S. Army Signal Corps, inspecting aircraft engines. After the war he went to work for the Henry Ford & Son Tractor Plant in Dearborn, Michigan, as a draftsman. Simpson married Gertrude Haeger in 1918; they had two children, Bruce (b. 1921) and Charlotte (b. 1924). In 1921 Henry Ford & Son was acquired by the Ford Motor Company. Simpson became a design engineer at Ford, working primarily on tractor designs and planetary gearsets. He often worked directly with Henry Ford himself. Simpson left Ford in 1938. In 1948 he was diagnosed with cancer. Told he had less than six months to live, he moved to the American southwest (California and then Arizona). He spent much of his time drawing every arrangement he could conceive for planetary gearsets, filing patents on each. He was granted 23 patents in this field during his lifetime. The Simpson Gearset Simpson's preferred gearset was for a three-speed automatic transmission using two identical planetary gearsets in series, linked by a common sun gear. The use of largely identical parts for the front and rear gearset made the transmission substantially cheaper to manufacture by reducing tooling costs. This three-speed gearing arrangement, patented in 1950, is commonly known as the \\"Simpson Gearset,\\" although it is only one of numerous arrangements Simpson successfully patented during his life. In the early 1950s Simpson attempted to sell his patent to major American automakers in Detroit, but was greeted with skepticism, despite his experience and positive reputation. Ford Motor Company licensed his three-speed gearset in 1953, although they did not put it into production at that time. In 1955 Chrysler Corporation licensed the same gearset for use in their new three-speed Torqueflite automatic, which went into production in mid-1956. General Motors was reluctant to adopt this gearset, but eventually relented and licensed it for the Turbo Hydramatic, which entered production for the 1964 model year. Ford similarly introduced reengineered Cruise-O-Matic transmissions (C3, C4, and C6) using the gearset they had already licensed. The Simpson-geared Cruise-O-Matics were introduced in the 1964 and 1965 model years. Germany's Daimler-Benz licensed the gearset as well, although it did not enter production until the early 1970s, as the Mercedes-Benz three-speed automatic. Death and legacy Simpson died of cancer in November 1963. During his lifetime he was granted a total of 41 patents, which eventually resulted in millions of dollars of royalty payments to him and his estate. In 2007 the Timken Company and the SAE Transmission and Driveline Committee established the annual SAE/Timken-Howard Simpson Automotive Transmission and Driveline Innovation Award for innovations in automotive transmissions and drivelines. In 1964 an uncredited writer for Motor Trend magazine said of Simpson, \\"[h]e was neither eccentric nor egocentric. An excellent engineer, he was usually calm and humble, always able to see merit in the other fellow's idea.\\" Sources * \\"Man with a Pencil: Engineering Genius of the Modern Automatic Transmission,\\" Motor Trend, Vol. 16, No. 10, Oct. 1964, pp. 82‚Äì85. * Ford R.

In graph theory, the cube-connected cycles is an undirected cubic graph, formed by replacing each vertex of a hypercube graph by a cycle. It was introduced by for use as a network topology in parallel computing.  Definition  The cube-connected cycles of order n (denoted CCCn) can be defined as a graph formed from a set of n2n nodes, indexed by pairs of numbers (x, y) where 0 ‚â§ x < 2n and 0 ‚â§ y < n. Each such node is connected to three neighbors: , , and , where \\"‚äï\\" denotes the bitwise exclusive or operation on binary numbers. This graph can also be interpreted as the result of replacing each vertex of an n-dimensional hypercube graph by an n-vertex cycle. The hypercube graph vertices are indexed by the numbers x, and the positions within each cycle by the numbers y.  Properties  The cube-connected cycles of order n is the Cayley graph of a group that acts on binary words of length n by rotation and flipping bits of the word.(; ). The generators used to form this Cayley graph from the group are the group elements that act by rotating the word one position left, rotating it one position right, or flipping its first bit. Because it is a Cayley graph, it is vertex-transitive: there is a symmetry of the graph mapping any vertex to any other vertex. The diameter of the cube-connected cycles of order n is for any n ‚â• 4; the farthest point from (x, y) is (2n ‚àí x ‚àí 1, (y + n/2) mod n).. showed that the crossing number of CCCn is ((1/20) + o(1)) 4n. According to the Lov√°sz conjecture, the cube-connected cycle graph should always contain a Hamiltonian cycle, and this is now known to be true. More generally, although these graphs are not pancyclic, they contain cycles of all but a bounded number of possible even lengths, and when n is odd they also contain many of the possible odd lengths of cycles..  Parallel processing application  Cube-connected cycles were investigated by , who applied these graphs as the interconnection pattern of a network connecting the processors in a parallel computer. In this application, cube-connected cycles have the connectivity advantages of hypercubes while only requiring three connections per processor. Preparata and Vuillemin showed that a planar layout based on this network has optimal area √ó time2 complexity for many parallel processing tasks. NotesReferences *. *. *. *. *. *.

He was a member of the committee to frame the U.S. Bill of Rights, a Territorial Secretary of State, and a U.S. Senator. He also surveyed land boundaries in Middle Tennessee. Daniel Smith was born in Stafford County, Virginia in 1748 as a twin.Congressional Record: Proceedings and Debates of the 105th Congress, Second Session, Vol. 144 (October 15, 1998.) He was baptized in Elbo Warren Baptist Church October 24, which was five days before his twin sister, Sarah, died.Bill Glidden, in Funeral of Daniel Smith: Historic Rock Castle, Hendersonville, TN. (Hendersonvill: Historic Productions, 2011) Smith lived in Baltimore, Maryland before he moved into the home of Dr. Thomas Walker. At Walker's, Smith studied medicine and surveying. Dr. Walker was famous for being the legal guardian of Thomas Jefferson. While they were not close in age, Jefferson and Smith did know each other, but Congressional records prove that they met. In these records, Jefferson praises Smith \\"For intelligence, well-cultivated talents, integrity, and usefulness, in soundness of judgment in the practice of virtue and in shunning violence unequaled by few men, and in the purity of excelled by none.\\" Thomas Jefferson, quoted in Bill Frist, U.S. Senator, Congressional Record: Proceedings and Debates of the 105th Congress, Second Session, Vol. 144 (October 15, 1998.) Later, Smith studied at the College of William and Mary, Jefferson's alma mater.Congressional Record.Grave Marker of Daniel Smith Smith served in the American Revolutionary War. He was a Captain and was appointed a Justice of the Peace by Patrick Henry. He was promoted to Major of the Washington County, Tennessee Militia. In 1778, Daniel Smith was appointed commissioner to locate roads. In 1779, along with Dr. Walker, he was appointed to extend the line between Virginia and North Carolina.Sarah Crosby Berry. \\"Application for the Membership to the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution: Washington D.C.\\" (1911) Historic Rock Castle Collection, Hendersonville, Tennessee. This later became the divisional lines of Kentucky and Tennessee. Afterward, in April 1778, Major Smith was recommended to become the Sheriff of Washington County. He was appointed Commissioner of Tax in the same year. Later that same year, Smith was appointed Examiner of the Bills of Credit. President George Washington appointed Smith as Secretary of the Territory South of the Ohio, Southwest Territory in 1790.\\"Smith, Daniel, (1748-1818)\\", \\"Biographical Directory of the United States Congress: 1774-Present.\\" United States Congress. Bioguide.congress.gov. (accessed April 25, 2013). Later Smith became Indian negotiator, where he negotiated most of the treaties with the Cherokee Indians in Tennessee. Smith, as mapmaker, created maps of Tennessee and Kentucky. He is the man that named the state \\"Tennasee\\" or \\"Tanasi\\", pronounced \\\\ten-'ah- see. The name was chosen for a Cherokee settlement in the eastern part of the state. Smith drafted the State Constitution of Tennessee and was one of the men who drafted a constitution for the Continental Congress in 1796. While his draft was not chosen as the Federal Constitution, his work was chosen for the State of Tennessee. Smith became one of the earliest Senators for Tennessee, and served two terms. Daniel Smith also surveyed the area that would become Nashville, the Tennessee state capital. In 1773, Smith married Sarah Michie.Melinda Gaines, \\"Sarah Michie Smith, 1755-1831\\" in A Modest History of Rock Castle. (Hendersonville: Friends of Rock Castle, 1994), 3. In 1783 Major Smith moved to the area that would become Tennessee with his wife and two young children to take up land that was given to him by the State of Virginia for his services in the Revolutionary War.Joseph Delaney, \\"A Historical Study of Rock Castle.\\" (Master's Thesis, Vanderbilt University, 1972-3), 2. He moved into a small log cabin. The Smith family lived in this for only a short time before the local American Indians burned it down in one of many isolated raids. His best friend and neighbor was Andrew Jackson. Jackson's original log cabin was a two-story structure in Hunter's Hill, down the river from Smith's home.Dave McArdle, Andrew Jackson impersonator and Scholar. Personal Communication with author, 2013. Smith filled the vacancy in the Senate that was left open by Jackson's resignation.\\"Smith, Daniel, (1748-1818)\\" Smith was also an in-law of Jackson's. Sarah Michie Smith Marker of Sarah Smith Sarah was born in 1755 to William Michie, the man that built the Michie Tavern near Charlottesville, Virginia. Her father, a Jacobite, was sentenced to transportation for his ideology. He and his family, including the very young Sarah, were brought to the American colonies for a mandatory period of seven years. After the allotted time had passed, William bought a tract of land from Major John Henry and built a permanent family home. His land was so close to a very well-traveled road that soon after finishing the house, travelers would stop in regularly. Eventually, William decided to open a proper tavern in his home to accommodate his frequent guests. Sarah grew up a socialite. She would have been in the same circles as founding fathers such as Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry. This is how she met Dr. Thomas Walker, who ended up introducing Sarah to Daniel and is credited with setting up their romantic relationship. In 1773, Daniel and Sarah were wed.Durham, 11. After Sarah married Daniel, they moved to the Virginian frontier. Here is where she gave birth to their two children, George and Mary Ann (nicknamed Polly). All four moved to Sumner County, Tennessee in 1783.Ruth Witman, \\"Tamsen Donner: A Woman's Journey\\". Historic Rock Castle Collection, Hendersonville, Tennessee. They \\"arrived in October, and spent at least the first winter in a log cabin. Isolated‚Ä¶ under very real danger from Indian attack.\\" Because of her husband's jobs, she found herself alone with her children most of the time. The family described her as having \\"uncommon strength and courage with a strong sense of humor.\\"Whitman Her outgoing and strong nature can also be found in the opening line of a letter she wrote to her husband after a long period of his absence which reads, \\"Dear Husband, I still find myself under the disagreeable necessity of conversing with you on paper or not at all.\\"Sarah Michie Smith, letter to her husband, Daniel Smith. N.d. Historic Rock Castle Collection, Hendersonville, Tennessee. Sarah's social life was impacted greatly when she moved to isolated Sumner county, but she quickly found friendship with Rachel Jackson. Rachel was not an outgoing person to begin with, but after the scandal surrounding her marriage to two men at once broke, she became a complete recluse. However, she knew she had a close friend in Sarah and found herself at the Smith's home often.  George Smith  George Smith was the son of Daniel and Sarah Smith. He was born in Virginia in 1775 and moved with his family to Sumner County when he was about eight years old. George would grow up to inherit the home. As an adult, he incurred a large amount of debt as a result of his struggles with both drinking and gambling. George's son, who was a surveyor and a soldier like his grandfather, would end up having to bail his father out of debt to maintain the house. Mary Anne \\"Polly\\" Smith Donelson Saunders Polly was the daughter of Daniel and Sarah Smith. She was raised almost entirely on the frontier of the United States, having been born in 1781 and having moved to nearly unsettled land in 1783 at the age of two. At the age of fifteen, her father decided to send her to a boarding school in Philadelphia where she would be expected to become a proper young woman in the eyes of the Smith's society. However, Polly did not want to leave because she had fallen in love with 22-year-old Samuel Donelson, Rachel Jackson's brother and Andrew Jackson's partner in law. Polly's father did not want the two to be married, so Andrew and Samuel came up with a plan. They rode over to the Smith's home, where Jackson assisted Polly down a ladder placed against her bedroom window. Andrew Jackson, Samuel Donelson, and Polly Smith traversed down the river to the Jackson's home where a minister was waiting. The two married immediately.Durham, 202. After learning of the marriage, Daniel became enraged and essentially disowned his daughter. A year later he welcomed her back into the family after she delivered his first grandchild. Polly would go on to have three children with Samuel, all boys. Ten years into their marriage, Samuel died of pneumonia. Polly remarried with James Saunders, a member of the Saunders family that ran ferries up and down the Cumberland river in the late 1700s. He was also a widower. When they married, the Saunders's had nine children, and over the course of their marriage they had nine more. As a result of their stepfather's abuse, Polly and Samuel's three sons would soon leave the family home. Her oldest joined the military and passed away in service, while her younger two, Andrew Jackson Donelson and Daniel Smith Donelson, were adopted by Andrew and Rachel Jackson.Polly Smith Donelson Slaves at Rock Castle Few records survive regarding the history of enslaved people at Rock Castle. However, two enslaved people are frequently named in surviving documents. A woman named Easter, who worked in the house as a maid or nanny, lived in a loft above the dining room with her husband Alfred. The Smith family referred to this man as \\"Uncle Alfred,\\" a common occurrence between slaveholding families and the enslaved people who most personally and closely served the family. A newspaper from 1910 also tells the story of an unnamed enslaved man who worked as a foreman on the farm being abducted from the site by Native Americans and taken east. When Smith was a Senator, the enslaved man contacted him to plead for a bounty so that he could be set free from his most recent captivity. Smith offered $900 to the Native people who abducted the unnamed enslaved man, and his captivity was transferred from the abductors to captivity on the plantation landscape of Rock Castle. The man was quoted as saying that he was \\"anxious to return to his old master and home.\\"Sumner County News (1910) in Durham, 172 However, seeing as this story was written at a time when black people's experiences in bondage were simplified to appease and appeal to white audience. Thus, it is uncertain if any of this account is accurate or based in any truth at all. More reliable records show that by 1860, the Smiths owned 98 slaves.Kathleen Gallagher Kemper, \\"Life at Rock Castle During the Civil War\\" in A Modest History of Rock Castle. There are two letters of bill of sale that name the following slaves being sold from George Smith to Harry Smith in 1833: Isaac, Martin, Charles, Cheshire, Larkin, Ina, Toby, Wilson, David, Henry, Sarah, Rachel, Judy (or Juda), Baty, Mitchel, Daniel, Jeffrey, Patricia, and Patricia's two children, Henrietta and Silva (or Silvia).George Smith. Bills of Sale to Henry Smith. (May, 1833), (October 1833), Historic Rock Castle Collection, Hendersonville, Tennessee. Mansion and grounds In 1788, Daniel Smith (surveyor) acquired of land in Sumner County, Tennessee along the Cumberland River and Drake's Creek.Delaney, 5. This was added to his land grant from North Carolina for his services to the Revolutionary War.State of North Carolina. \\"No. 56. (1784). Historic Rock Castle Collection, Hendersonville, Tennessee. This made a total of for Senator Dan Smith.\\"Map of the Lands of Daniel Smith's Grant.

Polly, Daniel and Sarah's daughter, received at the death of her father. Sarah received the land below this, in the amount of . The rest of the land, including the mansion went to the son, George Smith.Daniel Smith, \\"Last Will and Testament\\" (1818), 1-2. Historic Rock Castle Collection, Hendersonville, Tennessee. Over time, land was sold off for newer housing. Now, adjoin the mansion. The mansion was originally located near a stream that no longer flows. There were many slave cabins, a springhouse, and a smoke house. When Old Hickory Lake was created in 1954, the flood submerged most of the area behind the house. The smokehouse was razed to accommodate dirt brought in to prevent the house from flooding. Other buildings included the carriage house and barns. Front of MansionView from the Smokehouse looking toward the back of the mansion showing all three styles of masonryFlemish Style Masonry of Rock Castle The mansion was built in three sections over ten to twelve years. The mansion was built from rocks quarried on site. The first house built was three stories: a kitchen, a bedroom, and an attic. The stone construction inspired the myth that the house was a fireproof \\"castle\\" and that the rock protected the family from fires caused by cooking and set by Native Americans defending their right to the land. Later, a three-story addition was added including a basement, a dining room, and a third room that originally had four dormers that were removed later. The mantle over and around the fireplace is black-maple harvested from Rock Castle's grounds. The last and third edition to the house was added to the front of the house, the most formal portion of the house. Thought this area is currently interpreted as the downstairs master bedroom, it may have been originally used as a withdrawing or retiring room. The third addition also houses Daniel Smith's office. The walls in the space are decorated with faux painting. The upstairs houses George Smith's bedroom and room of unknown use. Rock Castle is the earliest known version of Federal Style architecture in Tennessee. The Greek revival facade with columns and porch may have been added by George Smith or his son Harry. Originally, the house consisted of nine rooms total. Melinda Gaines, Friends of Rock Castle Board President and scholar. Personal Interview with author. 2013. As with any historic Middle Tennessee house of this era, construction items could be made on site, purchased from a local merchant, or ordered from exporters located farther east. Window glass could be shipped in cases, as were hinges, English locks, and barrels of cut nails. Enslaved workers with masonry skill mixed cement mortar from lime and sand binding the wall stones together in a \\"length-wise and width-wise alternately‚Ä¶ Flemish bond pattern.\\"Delaney, 16, 18. This pattern requires planning, skill, and an good understanding of mathematics. Originally the roof was probably clad in pine shingles. A wooden fence painted with lime wash is said to be original to the house. Smith Hansborough, who is thought to be Daniel Smith's nephew, may have commanded a group of enslaved workers as the project's overseer. In one of his letters to Daniel Smith Hansborough discusses the progress of the house's construction. Delaney, 17. The Smoke House - original plus top layer of bricks from when the lake was added Herb Garden on the side of mansion, showing Old Hickory Lake There was also an herb garden and peach orchard on the grounds. The Smiths were locally famous for their peach brandy, which was sold at five shillings per gallon. Since Daniel Smith had training in the medical field, his gardens may have produced plants used for medicine including rosemary and mint, which helps in digestion and depression.\\"Medicinal Uses of Rosemary\\" Gardens Ablaze. N.d. http://www.gardensablaze.com/HerbRosemaryMed.htm.Delaney, 21. The main agricultural enterprise of Rock Castle's plantation landscape was wheat and cotton. Family cemetery There are over fifty family members buried within the small family cemetery on site. The two largest markers are for the founding members, Daniel and Sarah Michie Smith and their son Colonel George Smith. They both have a table-like marker that apparently covers the entire grave. Senator Smith's is breaking down more, but can still be read. There are other small markers, as well as obelisk style markers and pediment style markers within. A stone fence with an iron gate surrounds the cemetery. The stones were quarried using the same stone as the mansion. Family Cemetery at Rock Castle View from family cemetery entrance Daniel and Sarah's Grave Markers Close-up of the top of Daniel's grave marker Museum Entrance sign There are four original items within the mansion that belonged to the first Smiths. They are the sugar chest, the blanket chest, Senator Smith's desk and the original land grant from the State of North Carolina. One hundred of Daniel Smith's books are in the museum archives. George's sideboard and a later generation's grandfather clock is also within the mansion. The State of Tennessee owns the property and the buildings at Rock Castle. The Tennessee Historical Commission provides a partial annual operating grant to the site and is responsible for major maintenance at the property. The Friends of Rock Castle, Inc. owns all of the artifacts. The Friends of Rock Castle was formed in 1969 when the mansion and grounds were sold to the state from a Smith descendant. Board members take pride in the fact that Smith relatives have only owned the house. Sarah Crosby Berry was one of the founding members of the board. Each board member serves a three-year term. Most board members are very active with the site. The Visitor's Center at Rock Castle At the time of museum creation, the State of Tennessee removed years of updates to the mansion. One update was the removal of a concrete floor in a bathroom, which turned out to be the kitchen. Sarah Berry assisted with the selection of the stones for the flooring based on her memory from when she was a child. Dormers were removed from the central portion of the house with the assumption that they were added later. However, they were actually original to that edition of the mansion, but are too expensive to restore at this point. Most rooms are currently being interpreted from the late eighteenth century to the early nineteenth century Regency era. The room off the dining room is being interpreted as the master bedroom because it is known that later in life, the Smiths did sleep in this room. However, there is no proof that it was built and utilized as such originally. The room immediately above is being used as an exhibit room because there is no proof of use. The room where the dormers had been is extremely dark. In total, visitors are able to view all nine rooms in the house today.

All gaseous ionization detectors are able to collect the electrons released by ionizing radiation, guiding them to a region with a large electric field, and thereby initiating an electron avalanche. The avalanche is able to produce enough electrons to create a current or charge large enough to be detected by electronics. In most ionization detectors, the large field comes from a thin wire with a positive high-voltage potential; this same thin wire collects the electrons from the avalanche and guides them towards the readout electronics. GEMs create the large electric field in small holes in a thin polymer sheet; the avalanche occurs inside of these holes. The resulting electrons are ejected from the sheet, and a separate system must be used to collect the electrons and guide them towards the readout. GEMs are one of the class of micropattern gaseous detectors; this class includes micromegas and other technologies. History GEMs were invented in 1997 in the Gas Detector Development GroupThe Gas Detectors Development group. http://gdd.web.cern.ch/GDD/ at CERN by physicist Fabio Sauli.\\"A GEM of a Detector\\". CERN Courier, 27 November 1998. http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/27921 Operation Typical GEMs are constructed of 50‚Äì70 micrometre thick Kapton foil clad in copper on both sides. A photolithography and acid etching process makes 30‚Äì50 micrometer diameter holes through both copper layers; a second etching process extends these holes all the way through the kapton. The small holes can be made very regular and dimensionally stable. For operation, a voltage of 150‚Äì400 V is placed across the two copper layers, making large electric fields in the holes. Under these conditions, in the presence of appropriate gases, a single electron entering any hole will create an avalanche containing 100‚Äì1000 electrons; this is the \\"gain\\" of the GEM. Since the electrons exit the back of the GEM, a second GEM placed after the first one will provide an additional stage of amplification. Many experiments use double- or triple-GEM stacks to achieve gains of one million or more. Operation of wire chambers typically involved only one voltage setting: the voltage on the wire provided both the drift field and the amplification field. A GEM-based detector requires several independent voltage settings: a drift voltage to guide electrons from the ionization point to the GEM, an amplification voltage, and an extraction/transfer voltage to guide electrons from the GEM exit to the readout plane. A detector with a large drift region can be operated as a time projection chamber; a detector with a smaller drift region operates as a simple proportional counter. A GEM chamber can be read-out by simple conductive strips laid across a flat plane; the readout plane, like the GEM itself, can be fabricated with ordinary lithography techniques on ordinary circuit board materials. Since the readout strips are not involved in the amplification process, they can be made in any shape; 2-D strips and grids, hexagonal pads, radial/azimuthal segments, and other readout geometries are possible. Uses GEMs have been used in many types of particle physics experiments. One notable early user was the COMPASS experiment at CERN. GEM- based gas detectors have been proposed for components of the International Linear Collider, the STAR experiment and PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, and others. The advantages of GEMs, compared to multiwire proportional chambers, include: ease of manufacturing, since large-area GEMs can in principle be mass-produced, while wire chambers require labor-intensive and error-prone assembly; flexible geometry, both for the GEM and the readout pads; and suppression of positive ions, which was a source of field distortions in time-projection chambers operated at high rates. A number of manufacturing difficulties plagued early GEMs, including non-uniformity and short circuits, but these have to a large extent been resolved.

He was of Scottish descent and was a resident of Culpeper, Virginia and belonged to a distinguished Jameson Virginian family. Early life John Jameson was a graduate of The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia, the second oldest college in the country. Colonel John Jameson‚Äôs uncle was Lieutenant Governor David Jameson of Yorktown, Virginia who served from 1780-81 under the Governorship of Thomas Nelson, Jr., signor of the United States Declaration of Independence and served as Governor briefly in August 1781 when Nelson took ill. He was elected as a State Senator in 1783. He also served in the Senate during the War in 1776-1777, serving on Patrick Henry's Privy Council. His great nephew John Jameson served as a congressman for Missouri 1839-1849. American Revolution Jameson's second wife, Elizabeth Davenport (1769-1829) In Culpeper, Virginia (what was then called Fairfax, Virginia) under an old Oak tree during the spring of 1775, he volunteered with other men from Culpeper, Orange and Fauquier counties forming the Culpeper Minutemen. He was a Captain and company commander in the Culpeper Minutemen battalion. Making use of popular symbols and phrases of the period, the battalion's flag featured an obverse field containing an emblem of a snake (a symbol of the colonies) and the American Revolutionary mottoes \\"Liberty or Death\\" and \\"Don't Tread on Me.\\" Jameson and John Marshall were a leading spirit amongst the famous Culpeper minute-men. These were the first soldiers raised in Virginia. Together, he and the Minutemen fought in the Battle of Great Bridge, the first Revolutionary War battle on Virginia soil, where the minutemen defeated British troops under John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore, temporarily ending British control of Virginia. Jameson was elected June 13, 1776, by the Virginia Convention, captain of the Third Troop of Horse. He had six competitors for the position, and received forty-eight vote, while his competitors received respectively 17, 15, 9, 4, 3, 2 votes. One of his competitors was Henry Lee. Jameson took command June 16, 1776 as captain in a Virginia regiment of dragoons; promoted March 31, 1777, major 1st Continental Light Dragoons, and transferred April 7, 1777, to 3rd Continental Light Dragoons. He fought at the Battle of Brandywine. While staying with George Washington at Valley Forge, Major Jameson was wounded in a skirmish nearby on January 21, 1778. Throughout that year and the next he remained at Washington's side, engaged at the Battle of Monmouth, New Jersey in June, and promoted to Colonel in August 1779. As a Colonel in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War he was instrumental in exposing the treason of Benedict Arnold. In 1780, General George Washington placed key commanders in strategic areas around West Point, New York, and Colonel Jameson was placed in Tarrytown, New York under the supervision of General Benedict Arnold. A man calling himself \\"John Anderson\\" was intercepted by militiamen and found to be in possession of documents that included information regarding the defenses of West Point and the movements of the American army. Since the papers were found in an odd place, \\"under the feet of his stockings\\", Colonel Jameson became alarmed, arrested Anderson, and alerted General Arnold, since he did not yet suspect Arnold. Anderson was carrying a pass signed by the General, and Arnold was noted to be \\"very desirous of the Papers and everything being sent with him.\\" Jameson followed orders and had sent Anderson and the papers but was dissuaded by Major Benjamin Tallmadge, head of Continental Army Intelligence, who had just arrived at the headquarters. Because of the serious nature of the papers Jameson wrote to General Washington, enclosing the papers taken from Anderson. However he still insisted on notifying Arnold who promptly fled. Upon examining the papers, Washington called for Anderson, who then confessed that he was British major John Andr√©, envoy to the British commander in chief, Sir Henry Clinton. The investigation further revealed that Benedict Arnold, as commandant of West Point, agreed in 1780 to surrender the fort to the enemy in return for a royal commission in the British army and a large sum of money. Because of Jameson's intuition, Arnold's plot was foiled, but on balance, his misjudgment also allowed Arnold to escape. In any case, the attempt to pass control of West Point to the British was thwarted. Later life Jameson was a member of the Society of the Cincinnati, in Virginia, and was present at their meeting held December 13, 1802, in Richmond, Virginia, when it was voted to appropriate some of their funds, to the amount of $25,000, to found Washington College in Maryland. Personal life He was described as being 6 feet tall, blue-eyed and fair-complexion with black hair. After the war he was awarded over of land some of which was located in Green Co., Ohio. He owned many thousands acres of land throughout Virginia, Ohio, and Kentucky. Jameson was a member at the Freemasonry chapter in Alexandria, Virginia. He died on 20 November 1810 and was buried at the Culpeper Masonic Cemetery in Culpeper, Virginia.

The duo went by the names Mad Skillz and Mudfoot, respectively. Caan and Maman met as teenagers in the wealthy neighborhood of Beverly Hills, California. The duo began performing throughout the Los Angeles area and gained recognition. Maman's childhood friend Evidence introduced the group to Quincy Jones III and they began work on a demo. They eventually caught the attention of B-Real of Cypress Hill, who invited the teens to join the collective Soul Assassins, which also consisted of Cypress Hill, House of Pain and Funkdoobiest. The Whooliganz toured the country with the Soul Assassins and their connection helped them land a record deal with Tommy Boy Records. The Whooliganz recorded their debut album, Make Way for the W, and the album's first single was \\"Put Your Handz Up\\", which was produced by DJ Lethal and released in 1993, but the single and music video did not receive much airplay. A second single, \\"Don't Mean Nothin',\\" was planned but then Tommy Boy decided to drop the group and not release the album. Another song, \\"Whooliganz,\\" was released as a single in 1995 in the UK on Positiva/EMI Records, but the duo had already gone its separate ways. Caan followed his father, James Caan, into a successful acting career. Maman turned to making beats and found success as hip hop producer the Alchemist. In 2014, Caan and Maman reunited to collaborate on the song \\"Byron G.\\" from Step Brothers' album Lord Steppington. According to Step Brothers, another collaboration was recorded featuring Caan and Action Bronson but it was not released.

His family descended from a long line of Presbyterian and Episcopalian ministers, college founders, and teachers. Wyly's paternal grandfather was a lawyer who managed plantation assets and helped poor Black convicts get paroled from Angola Prison. His maternal grandfather was a doctor.Rigoni, Gene. \\"Sam Wyly 'Innovates To Opportunity' Time And Time Again\\", Monroe Street Journal, Stephen M.

He sold advertising, wrote stories, sent telegrams for oil and gas workers, folded and addressed the finished papers, delivered daily newspapers from the bus stop on Highway 80, and cleaned the printing presses.\\"Sam Wyly, Chairman, Sterling Software Inc. and Michaels Stores, Inc.\\" , Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans, retrieved September 21, 2007 In the summer, he rough necked in the Delhi Oil Field. Wyly played nose guard on his football team in high school. During his high school and undergraduate degrees, he went by the nickname \\"Bubba\\". Sam attended Louisiana Tech University[3], partly financing his tuition by selling class rings.[4] Sam was elected class president and student senate president. Wyly earned an MBA at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he dropped the \\"Bubba\\" and became \\"Sam.\\" He was Michigan's first Paton scholar. Wyly took the program's first computer course, which led him to code programs in machine language on the IBM 650 computer. He quickly recognized the computer's productivity potential within the farming industry.  Business career  After Michigan, Wyly went to Air Force Boot Camp in San Antonio and to Dallas for a job with IBM[2]. He and Ross Perot were classmates at IBM's education center. Three and a half years later, Wyly left IBM for Honeywell, establishing their computer business in Dallas, Ft. Worth, and Oklahoma.[4] When Honeywell rejected his plan for a new technology computing center to replace the obsolete Univac at SMU, he quit to do it himself. Wyly started his own company in 1963[citation needed]. Wyly played a significant role in the following businesses: *1963: Founded University Computing Company (UCC), to serve engineers, scientists, and researchers. He capitalized the company with his own $1,000 plus commitments from customers including Sun Oil Company, Texas Instruments and SMU, and $650,000 borrowed from the First National Bank in Dallas, now Bank of America, on the cover of Wyly's Dallas Got It Right!.[4] The company went public in September 1965, the month his twin daughters, Laurie and Lisa, were born.[2] In four years, UCC stock gained 100‚Äì1 over its IPO price. Many employees and early investors became millionaires. By 1969, it was one of only five companies headquartered in Texas with a market capitalization of $1 billion or more.[7] *1967: Bought the ten-store restaurant chain Bonanza Steakhouse which served steak and potatoes and salad for $2.[3] Sam ran TV ads using the actors who played \\"Hoss,\\" \\"Little Joe,\\" and \\"Pa Cartwright\\" from the TV series Bonanza. Bonanza grew from 10 to 600 restaurants[3] when he sold it to John Kluge, a German-born entrepreneur, then the richest man in America. *1968: Acquired Gulf Insurance[8] to help fund his biggest dream - a nationwide digital network to compete with AT&T;, then the national telephone monopoly. Their plant was based on analogue technology‚Äîgood for voice calls‚Äîbut, too slow for computer to computer talk. Gene Bylinsky of Fortune wrote, \\"Sam Wyly builds a telephone company for computers.\\" In his 1968 keynote speech to the Spring Joint Computer Conference in Atlantic City, Wyly said, \\"The computer user has dialed into a busy signal.\\" *1968: Co-founded Earth Resources Company, an oil- refining and silver-mining company, that built a refinery in North Pole, Alaska to make jet fuel for airplanes flying to Asia over the Arctic Sea. The Memphis refinery \\"got the lead out\\" of gasoline and fueled the fast growth of Federal Express and overnight air mail delivery *Late 1960s and early 1970s a trustee of SMU and director of First National Bank‚Äîthen youngest at the time for both. *1972: Built a computer keyboard plant to create jobs for Arapaho and Shoshone workers on the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming.[8] *1973: He divided UCC into four companies, including Datran, which began construction of a US digital network to transmit data among 27 American cities in direct competition with AT&T.;[8] He was unable to capitalize Datran at $400 million and Wall Street disappeared for over a decade when there weren't any technology IPOs for 14 years. Venture capital investing shrank 95 percent. Home mortgage rates rose to 20 percent. Wyly liquidated Datran in bankruptcy in 1976 and filed a $300 million anti-trust suit against AT&T; for abuse of its monopoly power and predatory pricing. The courts and Congress forced the bust up of the monopoly, citing Datran as a major reason. Unable to afford lawyers' fees, he engaged Texas lawyer, Bob Strauss, ‚Äî later Chairman of the Democratic Party ‚Äî to fight the legal battle for a contingency fee of 28 percent of any winnings. Four years later it was the largest fee ever paid to a Dallas firm. The monopoly was busted into eight companies competing with each other and they paid a $50 million settlement to Wyly's company. FCC attorney said Datran's effort was a major key to this USA policy change toward free market competition versus regulated monopoly. Strauss later became President George H. W. Bush's Ambassador to Russia and AT&T; ultimately headquartered in Dallas. *1981: Co-founded Sterling Software.[9] Focused on mainframe software and sold in 2000 for $4 billion, [3] and its spin-off of Sterling Commerce sold to AT&T; for another $4 billion. *1982: Bought ten arts-and-crafts Michaels stores.[3] Today over 1,300. In July 2006, Bain and Blackstone purchased the company for $6 billion. Sam's sale protected shareholders from massive losses in the Crash of 2009. *In 1990, co-founded hedge fund Maverick Capital, which by 2003 had about $8 billion in assets. Beginning in 1993, his son Evan, a Maverick co-founder, and money manager Lee S. Ainslie III managed the fund.[10] *In 1996, IPOed 19 percent of Sterling Commerce for $288 million in the \\"dot.com\\" boom of 1995‚Äì2000. Paid out the other 81 percent to Sterling Software shareholders as a tax-free dividend. Reference Sterling Software SEC filings. *In 2000, sold Sterling Commerce to AT&T; for $3.9 billion. Five years later in 2005, AT&T; resold the company for $1.4 billion to IBM. *In 2002, co-founded Ranger Capital, a fund focused on small-cap stocks. *As of 2006, Wyly was co-founder with son, Evan, the largest clean-energy producer Green Mountain Energy. replacing electricity made by older, dirty, coal plants with cleaner natural gas, wind, and solar power. Green Mountain became the clean-energy supplier to the Empire State Building in New York. *In 2006, Wyly was the largest investor in the online social networking company Zaadz.com at an estimated 1.5m. *In March 2007, Forbes magazine estimated Wyly's net worth to be $1.1 billion.[11] He was on the ‚ÄúForbes 400‚Äù for nine years.\\"The 400 Richest Americans: #354, Samuel Wyly\\", Forbes magazine, September 21, 2006  Books  Cheryl and Sam Wyly purchased Explore Booksellers and Bistro in January 2007, ending concern by Aspen, Colorado locals that the only book store would be converted into condos.Curtis Wackerle, \\"Explore building under contract to Wyly family\\", Aspen Daily News, January 29, 2007 Wyly's memoir, 1,000 Dollars & an Idea, was published in September 2008. His last book was The Immigrant Spirit: How Newcomers Enrich America, and his May 2018 book is Dallas Got It Right!, co-authored with Laurie Matthews and Andrew Wyly. His illustrated biography, Beyond Tallulah, How Sam Wyly Became America's Boldest Big-Time Entrepreneur, by Dennis Hamilton (Melcher Media) was published in 2011.http://www.writers.net/writers/books/40761 Hamilton began writing about Sam in software journals in the 1970s. Sam and his son Andrew published their book, Texas Got It Right!, in October 2012.[15] The book claims to explain why California, New York, and the Rust Belt states are losing jobs to Texas and the Southern and Rocky Mountain states.  Politics  In 1968, Sam Wyly was a delegate to the Republican Convention at the request of Chuck Percy, an Illinois Senator and former CEO who he met at a ‚ÄúYoung Presidents‚Äô‚Äù event. After Percy lost the nomination, Wyly became Chairman for the \\"Nixon For President\\" campaign in Texas. It was the first time that Republican presidential money had matched that of Democrats in Texas, which had been part of the \\"Democratic Solid South\\" since the Civil War. Nixon, and later President Ford, named Wyly chairman of a commission to foster businesses in mostly Black neighborhoods. Wyly had earlier worked with Joe Kirven, head of the Dallas Negro Chamber of Commerce, on a similar effort. In 1992, his friends Ross Perot and George H. W. Bush both ran for president. Perot got 20 percent, but with two Texans on the ballot, \\"another Bubba\\" from Texarkana‚ÄîBill Clinton‚Äîwon the White House. Perot, Clinton, and Wyly all grew up less than 100 miles from each other in Louisiana, Arkansas and Texas. In March 2007, commenting on the purchase of a local bookstore by Wyly and his wife Cheryl, the Aspen Times noted that the Wyly family \\"has been known not only for its philanthropic efforts, but also its large contributions to conservative political campaigns and candidates.\\"Rick Carroll, \\"End of an era: Explore sells for $4.6 million\\" , Aspen Times, March 6, 2007 Sam backed George H. W. Bush for president in 1980 and 1988. Sam backed George W. Bush's run for Congress in West Texas in 1978, for governor in 1994, and president in 2000 and 2004.  Philanthropy  Wyly and his late brother, Charles, spent more than $160 million on a wide range of charities in the last 25 years. In 1968, he set up the Sam Wyly Foundation to help black business owners. Wyly provided local matching money to get a Ford Foundation grant for the creation of \\"The Jim Lehrer News Hour.\\" Lehrer told The Aspen Institute, \\"Without Sam Wyly, there would be no News Hour.\\" With Charles, he funded the 16-story Tower of Learning at Louisiana Tech, designed by the Bastrop architect Hugh G. Parker, Jr., in memory of their father (1973). They also funded a $10 million gift to build Sam Wyly Hall at the University of Michigan (2000).[22] Wyly has been a significant supporter of Salvation Army, Deaf Action Center, Human Rights Organizations, animal shelters in Dallas and Hillsboro, Texas, and Aspen, health care for people surviving with Lou Gehrig's disease, and the Aspen Writers' Foundation.[16] He supported the Dallas Theater Center on Turtle Creek for decades, and was a key contributor to the Wyly Theatre in downtown Dallas. In 2015, Wyly founded WylyBooks Company, a nonprofit to fund his storytelling about America's history and future.  Legal Matters = Federal Government Lawsuits  In 1979, Wyly settled Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charges that he made undisclosed payments to associates to buy up company bonds as part of a plan to stave off bankruptcy for University Computing after the $100 million Datran loss. He settled without acknowledging any wrongdoing.Barry Meier, \\"The View From GreenMountain; Financier Mixes Business, the Environment and Politics\\", New York Times, March 16, 2000 In August 2006, the Dallas Morning News reported that Sam and Charles Wyly were again under investigation by the SEC, a grand jury in Dallas and a grand jury in New York,Brendan M. Case, Selling secret accounts draws scrutiny: Senate report blasts Dallas firm for offshore services for the masses\\", Dallas Morning News, August 13, 2006 regarding their use of potentially illegal offshore tax shelters. No criminal charges were made by either Grand Jury. Senate investigators allege that the Wyly brothers used the offshore trusts to buy $30 million worth of artwork, jewelry, furniture and other items for their personal use. The Wyly brothers denied any wrongdoing, and stated that they just followed the advice of their lawyers and CPAs. On July 29, 2010, the SEC charged Charles and Sam Wyly with fraud for violating federal securities laws governing ownership and trading of securities by corporate insiders. Sam was surprised with the charges, because historically such cases were brought when public investors lost money. In these companies‚Äî Michaels, Sterling Software, and Sterling Commerce‚Äîpublic investors had profits well above the averages. The Wyly brothers made an immense fortune for themselves, employees and stockholders through investments in Michaels Stores and several software companies. They had been accused of avoiding their tax obligations by transferring stock options in Michaels and Sterling Software Inc. to offshore trusts after receiving advice from a lawyer who promoted foreign trusts as a method of asset protection and tax deferral.SEC Charges Corporate Insider Brothers With Fraud, SEC, July 29, 2010\\"Wyly Brothers Charged with Fraud\\", New York Times, July 29, 2010SEC charges billionaire Texas brothers who donate to GOP with fraud, Zachary A. Goldfarb and Philip Rucker, Washington Post, July 30, 2010 On May 12, 2014, a civil jury in New York found the Wyly brothers liable on counts for use of offshore trusts. On July 11, 2014, Sam Wyly and his late brother Charles, were found not liable for insider trading by a U.S. Judge in New York. On October 19, 2014 Sam Wyly filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, having lost one of the cases brought by the SEC, and wanting to force the IRS to ‚Äúput up or shut up‚Äù about any taxes he owed related to his family's offshore trusts. The IRS had been auditing his tax returns for a decade without ever telling him whether he owed any additional taxes. In 2016, Wyly settled with the SEC, entering into a settlement agreement under which he agreed to pay $198.1 million. ‚ÄúThis is a significant step towards resolving Mr. Wyly‚Äôs disputes with the government and allowing him to exit from bankruptcy,‚Äù said Jim Lee, a lawyer at Vinson & Elkins. The following year, Wyly sold his home in Highland Park, Texas.  Internal Revenue Service  In April 2015, the Internal Revenue Service filed claims amounting to $3.2 billion for income taxes, interest and penalties against Wyly and the estate of his late brother. His lawyer called the IRS claims \\"unfair and absurd.\\"[35] The largest tax claim ever imposed against an individual. Wyly jokes that this was an IRS \\"billing error.\\" \\"They sent us Exxon's tax bill by mistake. Exxon's headquarters is a few miles from my house.\\" In June 2016, the Court ordered Wyly to pay $1.1 billion in taxes, interest and penalties. The IRS moved to collect from the offshore trusts that had been set up by Wyly. Wyly said he received advice that the Isle of Man was a good place for asset protection ‚Äî a place good for deferring taxes, not avoiding taxes. He had relied on the advice of their lawyers and accountants regarding the legality of the offshore trusts.  Personal life  Wyly and his brother Charles, older by a year, were close all their life. They played high school football, attended Louisiana Tech University, and joined Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity together. They worked together in a large number of businesses that they either owned or ran.Katie Fairbank and Sudeep Reddy, \\"Billionaire brothers under a microscope: They're known for gifts to charities, politics, but tax shelters scrutinized\\", Dallas Morning Times, August 27, 2006 Charles was killed in a car accident in Aspen's Roaring Fork Valley in 2011. From 1960 to 1976, Wyly was married to Rosemary Acton. In 1978, he married Victoria L. Steele.[40] Wyly was married to Cheryl [3] from 1994 to 2016. Cheryl was a former Texas All-State volleyball player at Farmers Branch High School and Valedictorian of Texas A&M;'s School of Architecture. Wyly has six adult children,\\"Man With his Back to the Wall: With his Once-proud Empire Crumbling Around him, UCC's Sam Wyly is Still Hanging on\\"f, Forbes magazine, June 1, 1973, accessed September 22, 2007 Evan, twins Laurie and Lisa, Kelly, Andrew, and Christiana.

Johnson did not believe that an alcoholic needed to \\"hit rock bottom\\" before recovery. He introduced the concept of intervention by family, friends, and employers. He supported \\"early intervention\\", because it interrupted the progression of the disease of alcoholism before the disease completely destroyed the alcoholic's life. Following his own recovery from alcoholism, in 1962 Johnson led a church group concerning alcohol intervention.The Johnson Institute As a Minnesota Episcopal priest, Johnson encouraged the incorporation of faith into the treatment and he convinced many churches to provide space for recovering alcoholics' support group meetings. Dr. Johnson was also a member of faculty of the Rutgers University Summer School for Alcohol Studies. In 1966, he co-founded (along with Irene and Wheelock Whitney) the Johnson Institute, Irene and Wheelock Whitney Award which aims to provide early intervention and help employers deal with employee drinking. The institute has also provided training to over 8,000 professionals.Do Drug and Alcohol Interventions Really Work? To this day, the Johnson Institute uses the \\"Minnesota Model\\", which Johnson constructed when he was leading the church group. (It now has offices in Washington, D.C., Austin, and Minneapolis.) In 2009, the Johnson Institute transferred its programs and products to the Hazelden Foundation.(www.hazelden.org)A History of the Johnson Institute Johnson Institute Announces Start of Nominations for 2006 America Honors Recovery Luncheon Awards Johnson also wrote several books about the treatment of chemical dependency, the most famous being I'll Quit Tomorrow.

He entered into service as a samurai from age 11, and took his first head in battle at the age of 16. He served in most of the campaigns of his father, including the Battle of Anegawa (1570), Battle of Mikatagahara (1573), Battle of Nagashino (1575), Battle of Komaki and Nagakute (1584), and Battle of Odawara (1590). He came to be regarded as one of Ieyasu's most experienced and trusted advisors, along with Honda Masanobu. In 1593, he was assigned the post of Kar≈ç to Tokugawa Hidetada.

The fort was built by long hunter and Sumner County pioneer Isaac Bledsoe (c. 1735‚Äì1793) in the early 1780s to protect Upper Cumberland settlers and migrants from hostile Native American attacks. While the fort is no longer standing, its location has been verified by archaeological excavations. The site is now part of Bledsoe's Fort Historical Park, a public park established in 1989 by Sumner County residents and Bledsoe's descendants. Bledsoe's Station was one of a series of frontier outposts built in the Upper Cumberland during the first major migration of Euro-American settlers into the Middle Tennessee area following the American Revolution. The fort was a convenient stopover along Avery's Trace--the main road connecting East and Middle Tennessee at the time. The flood of settlers into the region brought inevitable conflict with the region's Native American inhabitants, and dozens of settlers were killed in the late 1780s and early 1790s. Isaac Bledsoe's brother Anthony was killed in an ambush at the fort in 1788, and Isaac was killed while tending a field outside the fort in 1793. The end of the Cherokee‚ÄìAmerican wars, the following year, ended much of the violence in the region and reduced the fort's necessity. Bledsoe's Fort Historical Park protects the fort's excavation site, as an outline of the fort's walls can be discerned from former excavation trenches, as well as several historic structures, including the Nathaniel Parker Cabin and Hugh Rogan Cottage, who were compatriots of Isaac Bledsoe and a pioneer cemetery, with a large obelisk, dedicated to the Bledsoe brothers. The Castalian Springs Mound Site and the Wynnewood State Historic Site are located immediately east of the park, and the Cragfont State Historic Site is located immediately to the west. Geographical setting Bledsoe's Station was located on a hill slope between Bledsoe Creek to the west and Bledsoe Lick Creek to the east. Both streams empty into the Old Hickory Lake impoundment of the Cumberland River just over a mile to the south. The hill is relatively blunt and consists of open fields alternating with densely forested areas. The top of the hill is used as a flying zone for radio-controlled airplanes. The spring that furnished the minerals for Bledsoe's Lick flows at the base of the hill a few hundred yards east of the fort site. Bledsoe's Fort Historical Park covers most of the hill between the Sumner County RC Flyers airfield and Rock Springs Road. Tennessee State Route 25, also, known as, Hartsville Pike, provides the park's southern boundary and main access. The park is roughly halfway between Hartsville, to the east and Gallatin to the west, and lies approximately northeast of Nashville. History=Native-American settlements Castalian Springs Mound Site For thousands of years, the mineral springs at Bledsoe's Lick attracted buffalo and other large animals, and subsequently drew Native American hunters to the area. Native Americans were hunting around Bledsoe's Lick as early as 12,000 years ago during the Paleo-Indian period, and camped sporadically in the area throughout the Archaic (8000-1000 BC) and Woodland (1000 BC - 1000 AD) periods. During the Mississippian period (c. 1000-1450 AD), a substantial village had been established at the Castalian Springs Mound Site, a few hundred yards from the mineral springs. The village covered and contained at least 12 mounds.Bledsoe's Lick Archaeological Project, \\"Historical Background of Bledsoe's Lick .\\" Retrieved: October 12, 2008. By the time, the first Euro-American explorers arrived in the area in the mid-18th century, the Cherokee, Chickasaw, and Creek claimed the area as a hunting ground. European-American exploration and hunting expeditions Among the first documented English-American explorers, in the Upper Cumberland region, were the long hunters, so-called, because of the long duration of their hunting expeditions. The long hunters typically followed the Cumberland River and its headwaters, from southwestern Virginia into Middle Tennessee. Expeditions, led by Henry Scaggs in 1765 and James Smith in 1766, passed through what is now Sumner County, Tennessee and hunted extensively in the Upper Cumberland region. In 1769, an expedition led by Kasper Mansker spent several months in the Upper Cumberland area, eventually sending two canoes full of furs downriver to Natchez, Mississippi. Mansker returned to the Upper Cumberland in 1771 with a larger group of hunters-- among them Isaac Bledsoe-- and collected several thousand skins. In 1772, Mansker and Bledsoe led a third expedition to the Upper Cumberland region. This group established a base camp along Station Camp Creek (giving the creek its name) a few miles to the west near Gallatin. It was during this third expedition that Bledsoe followed the ancient buffalo paths to the creek and salt lick that now bear his name, and where he would eventually construct his fort.Walter Durham, The Great Leap Westward: A History of Sumner County, Tennessee from Its Beginnings to 1805 (Gallatin, Tenn.: Sumner County Public Library Board, 1969), 17-26. In the late 1770s, longhunter and explorer, Thomas \\"Bigfoot\\" Spencer led a hunting expedition, that camped near Bledsoe's Lick. Spencer remained throughout 1778, spending the winter in a hollowed-out sycamore tree, just south of the mineral springs. Spencer spent much of the year building cabins in the area, believing (mistakenly) that if he constructed cabins on certain tracts of land, he could lay claim to these tracts.Durham, The Great Leap Westward, 28-29. European- American settlement and Indian hostilities Map of the Upper Cumberland frontier The Bledsoe brothers, Isaac and Anthony, were born in Virginia in the early 1730s. Anthony Bledsoe, the older of the two, served in the French and Indian War and in various capacities with the Virginia militia. He commanded Fort Patrick Henry at Long Island of the Holston in 1776 and was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates the following year. Isaac Bledsoe also served in the French and Indian War, and following the long hunting excursions of the early 1770s, Bledsoe joined William Christian's 1776 punitive expedition against the Cherokee. In 1779, North Carolina appointed Anthony Bledsoe to lead a surveying party to Middle Tennessee. Isaac Bledsoe followed in 1781.Walter Durham, \\"Anthony Bledsoe.\\" The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009. Retrieved: 9 February 2013.Walter Durham, \\"Isaac Bledsoe.\\" The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009. Retrieved: 9 February 2013. Isaac Bledsoe probably began building Bledsoe's Station, shortly after his arrival, although, he didn't move his family, into the fort until 1783. Around the time Bledsoe's Station was completed, Anthony Bledsoe completed a fort at Greenfield north of Bledsoe's Station. As settlers poured into the Upper Cumberland region, conflict with the region's Native American inhabitants intensified. The Chickamaugas-- a renegade branch of the Cherokee-- had for the most part been at war with the United States since 1776, and opposed land concessions that would allow Euro-American settlers to move into the Middle Tennessee area permanently. In 1782, frontiersman Hugh Rogan (1747‚Äì1814) was nearly killed in an ambush in the vicinity of what is now Cragfont. A hunting party led by Thomas Spencer was attacked at Drake's Creek in 1784. Spencer survived, but was later killed in an ambush near Crab Orchard. In 1786, Anthony Bledsoe wrote a letter to North Carolina governor Richard Caswell reporting that 14 settlers had been killed that year and sought permission to attack the Chickamaugas.Durham, The Great Leap Westward, 31-45. A schoolmaster named George Hamilton was shot and badly wounded at Bledsoe's Station in 1787.Jay Guy Cisco, Historic Sumner County, Tennessee (Nashville, Tenn.: Charles Elder, 1971), 30. As attacks increased, Anthony Bledsoe moved his family from Greenfield to Bledsoe's Station, which afforded better protection, but in 1788 he was shot and mortally wounded when he accidentally stepped into a section of the fort vulnerable to hostile fire. During the engagement, Hugh Rogan-- who was in the fort at the time-- volunteered to try to sneak to a nearby fort to obtain means for making a fire and providing light by which the dying Bledsoe could draw up a will.Durham, The Great Leap Westward, 99-101. Conflict between the Chickamaugas and the Upper Cumberland settlers continued into the early 1790s. Ziegler's Fort (at what is now Bledsoe Creek State Park a few miles southwest of Bledsoe's Lick) was overrun in 1792, and Morgan's Station (northwest of Bledsoe's Lick) was nearly burned a few months later. In 1793, Isaac Bledsoe was shot and killed while walking through a field near Bledsoe's Station. The following year, a son of Anthony Bledsoe (named Anthony) and a nephew of Anthony and Isaac (also named Anthony) were both ambushed and killed near Rock Castle at what is now Hendersonville. Thomas Bledsoe, another son of Anthony Bledsoe, was ambushed and killed a few months later.Durham, The Great Leap Westward, 107-121. Hostilities between the settlers and the Chickamaugas finally subsided when the 1794 Treaty of Tellico brought an end to the Cherokee‚ÄìAmerican wars. First road built connecting Fort Southwest Point to Nashville, Tennessee Sign marking what was once a section of Avery's Trace The first major road connecting the Upper Cumberland region with settlements to the east, known as Avery's Trace, was completed in 1788. The road, which connected Fort Southwest Point with Nashville, passed a few hundred feet east of Bledsoe's Station. Guests at Bledsoe's Station in the 1790s included French botanist Andr√© Michaux and Louis-Philippe, Duke of Orl√©ans and later king of France. General James Winchester, who helped establish Cairo to the southwest and was later instrumental in the founding of Memphis, purchased Bledsoe's Station in 1797. The following year, Winchester completed Cragfont near Bledsoe Creek about a mile to the west. In 1807, a pioneer from North Carolina named Jeremiah Belote (d. 1822) purchased Bledsoe's Lick, and his descendants would retain possession of the property for several decades.Information obtained from interpretive signs at Bledsoe's Fort Historical Park, 14 September 2008. Bledsoe's Fort Historical Park Following Winchester's death in 1826, his daughter, Almira Wynne, inherited what is now the Wynnewood State Historical Site. Wynnewood-- the largest extant log structure in the state-- was completed in 1830 and operated as an inn. During this period, the Winchester family also managed to change the name of Bledsoe's Lick to \\"Castalian Springs\\", the name being derived from the spring of mythological importance near Delphi in Greece. Castalian Springs thrived sporadically, as a health resort until 1914. The Bledsoe's Station site was purchased by Sumner County in 1989. Bledsoe's Fort Historical Park consists of approximately , and includes the Bledsoe's Station site and several other features important to the early history of the Upper Cumberland region. The park is owned by Sumner County and maintained by the Bledsoe's Lick Historical Association. A short loop trail-- part of which follows a section of Avery's Trace-- provides access to the fort site and other features. Historical features at Bledsoe's Fort Historical Park Hugh Rogan Cottage * Bledsoe's Station site -- the site of Bledsoe's Station was excavated by Middle Tennessee State University in the late 1990s. Excavators discovered several root cellars (indicating the presence of log cabins) and the fort's stockade. The excavation trench lines remain, and a small platform overlooks the site. * Hugh Rogan Cottage -- Hugh Rogan's stone cottage was built a few miles north of Bledsoe's Lick around 1800. The cottage's architecture was heavily influenced by folk traditions of Rogan's native Ireland, namely the low gabled roof and corresponding doors and windows. The cottage was dismantled and moved to the park in 1998.Caneta Skelley Hankins, \\"Rogana.\\" The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009. Retrieved: 9 February 2013. * Nathaniel Parker Cabin -- Nathaniel Parker's cabin is a typical pioneer log cabin, built in the 1780s. The cabin was originally located a few miles north of Bledsoe's Lick and later dismantled and moved to the park. Parker married Mary Ramsey Bledsoe-- the widow of Anthony Bledsoe-- in the 1790s and commanded the fort at Greenfield. * Belote Cemetery -- the Belote Cemetery (also called the \\"Pioneer Cemetery\\") is located along a section of Avery's Trace a few hundred yards southeast of the fort site and contains the graves of various early settlers in the Bledsoe's Lick area. The cemetery's most prominent feature is a obelisk erected by the Bledsoe family in 1908 as a monument to Isaac and Anthony Bledsoe. * Long hunter camp -- the long hunter camp is a demonstration area located along a spring near the ancient salt lick. MTSU has constructed a \\"lean-to\\" structure believed to be typical of shelters used at 18th-century long hunter base camps. * Belote springhouse -- the ruins of a springhouse used by the Belote family in the 19th century are located along a spring in the Bledsoe's Lick area, near the Long hunter camp. * The Cavern of the Skulls -- the Cavern of the Skulls is a cave located a few hundred feet east of the fort site. The cave's entrance, which is approximately x , is closed to the public. 19th-century cave explorers reported the presence of human skulls in the cave, suggesting that the inhabitants of the Cheskiki Mound village may have used the cave to store \\"trophy\\" skulls. A ritual scene depicted on a shell gorget uncovered at the mound site lends some credence to this hypothesis.

Asselin came from a musical family; he was the brother of mezzo-soprano Marie-Anne Asselin and great uncle of pianist Andr√© Asselin. Asselin was born in the town of Sainte-Famille on √éle d'Orl√©ans in 1881. He moved with his family to Montreal around 1901, and, in 1903, he married Cora Laviolette in Notre-Dame cathedral.  Singing career  Asselin began a career as a furrier soon after his marriage. He would remain a furrier until his retirement. Asselin sang in church for some time, but it would not be until 1916, when he was 35, that he would make his first professional performance. He performed for Ladies' Morning Musical Club of Quebec City, a club devoted to classical music appreciation. He was well received and, within a year, had signed a contract with Columbia Records. Under this contract, he recorded arias from French operas, various songs from operettas, and other classical songs. Asselin also gave live performances. In April 1917, he performed in the oratorio Les Sept Paroles du Christ at the Montreal Cathedral. His first solo concert followed that October. He joined the Soci√©te nationale d'op√©ra comique, but it quickly disbanded. In September 1918, he appeared at the Cartier Theatre and the Orpheum Theatre, alongside Blanche Gonthier. Starting in November 1918, Asselin made recordings for the Edison recording label. His recordings were released in several formats, including Royal Purple Grand Opera Cylinder Records 29000 series, the Blue Amberol 27000 cylinder series and the Edison Diamonds 74000 series of disks. Through Edison, Asselin released a variety of recordings of arias and other serious classical works. Asselin continued recording with Edison until December 1920. In May 1921, Asselin resigned with Columbia Records. He recorded eight songs in New York with them, which included arias by Donizetti, Godard, and Massenet, two duets with Guillaume Dupuis using contemporary melodies and a duet with Blanche Gonthier of Sur le lac d'argent by Faur√©. Asselin made his last recording for the Brunswick record company in 1929. Soon after, he disappeared from professional music and focused his efforts on his fur business.

It is also the name of a village on the island which lies at the southern end of the Gulf of Bothnia. The island has an area of and a population of about 800. The island has a mixture of fields and woodland. It is a popular summer resort. Location Gr√§s√∂ and the smaller island of √ñrsk√§r to the north are the most northerly of the Roslagen islands, the northern part of the Stockholm archipelago. Gr√§s√∂ may be reached by ferry from √ñregrund on the mainland to the west. The island has a gently rolling terrain with woods mixed with cultivated fields and pasture. There is abundant wildlife including fox, badger, deer and elk. Sea eagles nest on the island. History In the past the people lived mainly on fishing, hunting and farming. There is a graveyard from the Viking Age in the grazed pasture to the east of Gr√§s√∂ g√•rd, with 55 graves. This was probably beside a trading post that later gained a more settled farming population practicing arable farming and raising cattle. In 1548 Gustav Vasa evicted the farmers from the region and founded a new estate at Gr√§s√∂ g√•rd. In the early 1600s the farmstead was converted into a manor. Gr√§s√∂ Church was founded in 1695 and consecrated in 1697. In 1719 the Russians raided the island, looting and burning all the farm buildings. A relic from that time is an altar in Klockarhagen where the Russians held their religious services. The church sacristy was built in 1753 as part of the reconstruction after Russian raids of 1719. The church was restored in 1997 for its 300th anniversary. Today there were about 800 permanent residents, but in the summer the population rises as many visitors come to stay for their holidays. The island has a kindergarten and an elementary school for students up to grade 3. There are many small businesses in the agriculture and handicraft industries. Visitor facilities include hostels and camping. There is a family campground with a restaurant and miniature golf, craft and curio shops and a small market. Gr√§s√∂ g√•rd is now a nature reserve owned by the municipality, near to the ferry landing. It includes hiking trails, meadows with many flowers, rocks and woods, and picnic areas. Some of the meadows are fenced off, and cows graze in others. There is a 28-bed hostel. The main building was built at the turn of the century after a fire in 1890.

Personal life He was born at Refne in Berg, √òstfold as a son of wholesaler Christian August Anker (1840‚Äì1912) and Christine Charlotte Friis (1848‚Äì1899). He was a grandson of landowner and politician Peter Martin Anker, and nephew of landowner and politician Nils Anker and school founder Herman Anker. In March 1895 he married Julie Frederikke Jacobsen (1872‚Äì1962). Their son Christian August Anker, born 1896, was a businessman and their son Erik Anker, born 1903, also became a sailor and businessman. The marriage was later dissolved. In January 1910 he married his second wife, renowned feminist Nini Roll Anker (1873‚Äì1942). She had formerly been married to Johan's first cousin. Sailing career In 1908 he finished fourth as a crew member of the Norwegian boat Fram in the 8 metre class competition. Four years later he was a crew member of the Norwegian boat Magda IX which won the gold medal in the 12 metre class. He returned to the Olympics in 1928 to win his second gold medal, this time in the 6 metre class. He did so as a crew member of Norna. This time his son was on the crew, so was Crown Prince Olav of Norway. They represented the Royal Norwegian Yacht Club. Anker chaired the Royal Norwegian Yacht Club from 1916 to 1919 and 1921 to 1925, and was a co-founder and first chairman of the Nordic Sailing Federation from 1915. Yacht designer In 1905 he bought into a small boat building yard named Jensens Yard. It became the famous Anker & Jensen Yard. Most of the boat designing was done by Anker and the boat building was done mostly by Jensen. Johan Anker became an internationally recognized yacht designer after entering the 1908 Olympics, held that year in Great Britain. The sailing took place in the Solent and Johan Anker raced his 8mR Fram. He managed to secure second place in both races. A few years later Anker returned to the Solent for the 1911 Coronation Regatta, this time with the yacht Rollo, an 12mR design. This time Johan Anker sailed home to Norway with the gold medal. With the International Rule yachts quickly increasing in popularity on the international yacht racing scene, John Anker had established himself as a first class designer. With the long sleek and beautiful boats that Anker designed he soon became known as the ‚Äúmaster of lines‚Äù not only in his home country but also in the rest of the world. Except from designing several International Meter Rule yachts, the most noticeable design from John Anker is the Dragon from 1929. The Dragon became an Olympic class and is still today a fast-growing keel boat class that is raced in over 26 countries in 5 continents. In 1915 Johan Anker parted with Jensen and the yard was taken over entirely by Anker who keep the name Anker & Jensen for the business. Anker's 6mR, 8mR, 12mR designs excelled, but he also designed 15mRs Isabel-Alexandra (1913) and Neptune (1917), Q-Class Cotton Blossom II (1925), Figaro IV, Brand II and Noreine. Anker died in October 1940, aged 69, and was buried at Oslo Western Civil Cemetery.

It has an area of 67.79 km2 and a permanent population of 8,417 (as of 31 December 2010), although its summertime inhabitants are about twice that number. Most of the island's inhabitants work in Sundsvall and other towns on the mainland. The island is 15 km long and 6 km wide on the widest spot. It is connected to the mainland by a bridge, which was the longest bridge in Sweden when it was opened in 1964. Evidences of habitation on the island predate the Viking Age, and there are several tumuli on the island from that period. The old stone church near the modern bridge was built in the 12th century. The island saw a population boom in the second half of the 19th century, due to the development of steam-driven sawmills. In 1850 the island had 950 inhabitants, mainly farmers and fishermen, but by 1900 the population had grown to almost 7,000, following the establishment of 18 sawmills between 1860 and 1897. Geology Aln√∂ was affected some 570 million years ago by a massive volcanic eruption. The northeastern part of the island is rich in carbonate minerals, and it is one of few areas in the world with a carbonatite volcanic complex. Its chemistry is very different from the ordinary granitic rock that form the rest of the island, resulting in a number of unusual minerals, such as baryte and aegirine. The most famous of the rocks of Aln√∂n is the alnoite, named from the Island, which is a lamprophyre chiefly composed of biotite or phlogopite and melilite as essential minerals, commonly with olivine, calcite and clinopyroxene. Perovskite, apatite, nepheline and garnet may also be present. Diamonds have also been found on Aln√∂n, but only in very small amounts. Aln√∂bron connects Aln√∂n with the mainland, and was Sweden's longest bridge when it opened in 1964.

Function  This gene encodes a retina-specific guanylate cyclase, which is a member of the membrane guanylyl cyclase family. Like other membrane guanylyl cyclases, this enzyme has a hydrophobic amino-terminal signal sequence followed by a large extracellular domain, a single membrane spanning domain, a kinase homology domain, and a guanylyl cyclase catalytic domain. In contrast to other membrane guanylyl cyclases, this enzyme is not activated by natriuretic peptides. The nomenclature for members of the Gucy2 gene family is not consistent across species. In many mammals, including mice and rats, the Gucy2d gene encodes a related protein ‚Äì GC-D ‚Äì that is specifically expressed in a subpopulation of olfactory sensory neurons. This gene is a pseudogene in humans and most other primates. In rodents, the corresponding (orthologous) gene to human GUCY2D is Gucy2e.  Clinical significance  Mutations in this gene result in Leber's congenital amaurosis and cone-rod dystrophy-6 diseases.

The bathhouses were included in 1832 when the Federal Government took over four parcels of land to preserve 47 natural hot springs, their mineral waters which lack the sulphur odor of most hot springs, and their area of origin on the lower slopes of Hot Springs Mountain. The existing bathhouses are the third and fourth generations of bathhouses along Hot Springs Creek and some sit directly over the hot springs ‚Äì the resource for which the area was set aside as the first federal reserve in 1832. The bathhouses are a collection of turn- of-the-century eclectic buildings in neoclassical, renaissance-revival, Spanish and Italianate styles aligned in a linear pattern with formal entrances, outdoor fountains, promenades and other landscape-architectural features. The buildings are illustrative of the popularity of the spa movement in the United States in the 19th and 20th centuries. The bathhouse industry went into a steep decline during the mid-20th century as advancements in medicine made bathing in natural hot springs appear less believable as a remedy for illness. Bathhouse Row was designated a National Historic Landmark on May 28, 1987. and  Description  Map of Bathhouse Row The Bathhouse Row contains eight bathhouses aligned in a row: Buckstaff, Fordyce, Hale, Lamar, Maurice, Ozark, Quapaw, and Superior. These were independent, competing, commercial enterprises. The area included in the National Historic Landmark also includes a Grand Promenade on the hill above the bathhouses, an entrance way including fountains, and a National Park Service Administration building.  Buckstaff  Buckstaff Baths Typical men's bath in Buckstaff, 1987 Completed in 1912, the elegantly designed Buckstaff Baths operates under National Park Service regulations, its well-trained staff provides a range of services from tradition thermal mineral baths and body massages to Swedish style full body massages. The bathing tubs are private and bathing suits are optional, although visitors may cover themselves between the bathing stations. Services begin with a \\"Whirlpool Mineral Bath\\" for $35.00 The cream-colored brick building is neoclassical in style with the base, spandrels, friezes, cornices and the parapet finished in white stucco. It was a radical departure from the fanciful structures that preceded it, and compared to the Irish House of Parliament or the Treasury Building. The entrance is divided into seven bays by engaged columns, with a pavilion on each end. Friezes above the two- story doric columns have medallions (paterae) that frame the brass lettered words \\"Buckstaff Baths\\" centered above the entrance. Brass handrails border the ramp that leads up to the brass-covered and glazed wood-frame entrance doors. First floor windows are arched; second story windows are rectangular. Those on the third floor are small rectangular windows, with classical urns between them above the cornice that finish the columns. The first floor of the building contains the lobby and men's facilities. Women's facilities are on the second floor. The third floor is a common space containing reading and writing rooms and access to the roof-top sun porches at the north and south ends of the building.  Fordyce (now visitor center)  The Fordyce Stained Glass Skylight Above the DeSoto Fountain, Fordyce Bathhouse Fordyce Bathhouse reading room with stained glass ceiling, Historic American Buildings Survey The Fordyce bathhouse is the most elaborate and was the most expensive of the bathhouses, the cost including fixtures and furniture being $212,749.55 US. It was closed on June 29, 1962, the first of the Row establishments to fall victim to the decline in popularity of therapeutic bathing. Fordyce Bathhouse has served as the park visitor center since 1989. The Fordyce bathhouse was built in 1914‚Äì15, designed by George Mann and Eugene John Stern of Little Rock, Arkansas. Its surpassing elegance was intentional, as Samuel W. Fordyce waited to observe the Maurice's construction to find out if he could build \\"a more attractive and convenient\\" facility. It was built as a testimonial to the healing waters to which Mr. Fordyce believed he owed his life. It represents the \\"Golden Age of Bathing\\" in America, the pinnacle of the American bathing industry's efforts to create a spa rivaling those of Europe. The Fordyce offered all the treatments available in other houses. The Fordyce provided for the well-being of the whole patron ‚Äì body, mind, and spirit. It offered a museum where prehistoric Indian relics were displayed, bowling lanes and a billiard room for recreation, a gymnasium for exercise, a roof garden for clean air and sun, and a variety of assembly rooms and staterooms for conversation and reading. In style, the building is primarily a Renaissance Revival structure, with both Spanish and Italian elements. The building is a three-story structure of brick construction, with a decorative cream-colored brick facing with terra cotta detailing. The foundation and porch are constructed of Batesville limestone. On the upper two stories, the brickwork is patterned in a lozenge design. The first floor exterior of the front elevation to the west is finished with rusticated terra cotta (shaped to look like ashlar stone masonry). The remainder of the first floor is finished with glazed brick. A marquee of stained glass and copper with a parapet of Greek design motifs overhangs the open entrance porch. The north and south end walls have curvilinear parapets of Spanish extraction. These side walls have highly decorative terra cotta windows on the first floor. On the front elevation, the fenestration defines the seven bays of the structure and provides the architectural hierarchy typical of Renaissance Revival‚Äìstyle buildings. The windows on the first floor are of simple rectangular design. Those on the second floor are paired six-light casements within an elaborate terra cotta molding that continues up around the arched window/door openings of the third floor. The arches of those openings are incorporated into the terra cotta frieze that elegantly finishes the top of the wall directly below the cornice. Visible portions of the roof are hipped, covered with decorative tile. Hidden portions of the roof are flat, with the exception of the large skylights constructed of metal frames and wire glass. Hubbard Tub with wooden patient lift (2006), in the Fordyce. The first floor contains the marble-walled lobby, flanked by terra cotta fountains, which has stained glass clerestory windows and ceramic tile flooring. In the vicinity of the lobby desk are a check room, attendant dispatch room, and elevators. The north and central portions of the building house the men's facilities: cooling room, pack room, steam room, hydrotherapy room, and bath hall. The women's facilities, considerably smaller in size, are at the south end of the building. Originally there was a 30 tub capacity. Although the men's and women's bath halls both have stained glass windows in aquatic motifs, the most impressive stained glass is the massive skylight in the men's area, with the DeSoto fountain centered on the floor directly below it. The second floor originally had dressing rooms, lockers, cooling rooms, and massage and mechano-therapy departments; now it is largely occupied by wood changing stalls, with entry to a centrally located quarry- tile courtyard for sunbathing. The third floor houses a massive ceramic-tiled Hubbard Currence therapeutic tub (a full body immersion whirlpool installed in 1938 when other hydrotherapeutic pools were also added), areas for men' s and women' s parlors, and a wood panelled gymnasium to the rear. The most impressive space on the third floor is the assembly room (now museum) where the segmentally arched vaults of the ceiling are filled in with arched, stained glass skylights. Arched wood-frame doors surrounded by fanlights and sidelights open out to the small balconies of the front elevation. The basement houses various mechanical equipment, a bowling alley (since removed), and the Fordyce spring ‚Äì a glazed tile room with an arched ceiling and a plate glass window covering over the natural hot spring (spring number 46). Colonel Samuel W. Fordyce was an important figure in the history of Hot Springs ‚Äì soldier, entrepreneur, and community leader. After experiencing the curative powers of the thermal waters in treating a Civil War injury, he moved to Hot Springs and was involved in numerous businesses including the Arlington and Eastman Hotels, several bathhouses, a theater, the horsecar line, and utilities. Fordyce had a hand in virtually every development which shaped the community and Bathhouse Row from the 1870s to the 1920s.  Hale  Hale The Hale was constructed in 1892‚Äì93, replacing an earlier Hale bathhouse. The Hale was probably the first of the Hot Springs 19th-century bathhouses to offer modern conveniences to its bathers, and thus became more cosmopolitan in nature. The first Hale Bathhouse, built in 1841 by John C. Hale, was the first to provide more than just a bath as a service. Within twenty years there were at least three establishments in Hot Springs bearing Hale's name, although none of these appear to have been situated at the location of the present Hale. It is very likely that all the early structures were destroyed by raiders during the Civil War. Following the war, Hale rebuilt his bathhouse near the Alum Spring. John Hale died in 1875 and the bathhouse lease was sold or transferred by his heirs. After the Hot Springs Commission settled land claims in the area in 1879, William Nelson built a bathhouse adjacent to the existing Hale Bathhouse with the intent to replace it. The 1879 frame structure was razed in 1891 and a new building put up on the site the next year by principal owner Colonel Root. The building retains a considerable amount of its 19th-century character and probably has extensive historical archeological potential around its foundation. Over the entrance there is a double curved parapet with the name of the bathhouse. On either side of the entrance are small windows barred by handsome wrought-iron grilles. The entrance arcade forms a wide sun room where guests could relax. An attractive great-hipped roof of red tile crowns the building on all four sides. Women's baths in Hale Bathhouse, 1st floor, photograph by Historic American Buildings Survey The first floor contains the sun porch, lobby, office, and men's and women's facilities. The south side of the building (the front half and the back two-thirds) contains the men's area with dressing room, pack room, cooling room, and bathing hall with skylight. The women's side contains similar facilities, but smaller in scale. The second floor, reached by stairs flanking either side of the lobby, has additional dressing spaces, cooling rooms, and massage rooms for men and women. The partial basement has employee dressing rooms and a display spring. The basement underwent repairs following a flood in 1956. The floors were laid with handsome French tiling and/or marble. The bathing department had tile floors, 26 tubs, marble partitions, and nickel-plated hardware. The tubs were rolled, rimmed, and porcelain lined. The -high ceilings provided excellent ventilation. The Hale had two needle and shower baths, one hot room, six cooling rooms, a gymnasium, and 14 dressing rooms on the men's side; the women's department contained 8 tubs, one vapor bath, one hot room, two cooling rooms, one needle bath, and six individual dressing rooms. The house included a subterranean excavation or cave in the tufa bluff directly to the rear of the building. This cave was used as a sweat room; it was known for some time as the \\"electric cave\\" until it was closed in 1911. The building ceased operation as a bathhouse in 1978 and was closed for several years. In 1981 it was remodeled for use as a theater and concessionaire operation (snack bar, gift shops, and arcade). A new emergency exit was installed at the south end of the lobby to meet fire code regulations. The concessionaire operation failed and the building closed nine months later. Hale as built in 1892‚Äì1893. The building is primarily a brick and concrete structure, reinforced with iron and steel. It was originally built in 1883 in the Classical Revival style, with an enormous central cupola and possessed a flamboyant Victorian air. Regulations were changed in 1910 and following negotiations the building underwent extensive renovations in 1914 (design by George Mann and Eugene Stern of Little Rock). It was again remodeled in the late 1930s (design by Thompson, Sanders, and Ginocchio of Little Rock). The latter renovation changed the facade from neo-Classical revival to Mission Style in 1939‚Äì40. The building is generally rectangular in plan, and is two and one half stories in height. Hale between 1915 and 1937. By 1919, the neo-Classical building had a hierarchy of fenestration typical of that style: rectangular windows on the ground floor with arched windows on the second floor. The 1939 remodeling included changing the rectangular window openings of the sun porch at the front of the structure to arched window openings, like those on the second story, suggesting arcades of piers with capitals. The classical segmental arch over the main entrance became a simpler Spanish bell gable. The brick was covered with stucco, and wrought iron grilles were placed over the two windows flanking the entrance. The entire effect became very \\"California\\". Interior modifications in conjunction with those remodelings are unknown. An unusual engineering feature in the basement is the use of brick vaulting as the form into which concrete was poured for the floor above. In other words, the original first floor structure and basement ceiling has steel beams with shallow brick vaults between them, held in place with steel tension bars; the whole assembly is covered with a concrete topping.  Lamar  The Lamar The Lamar Bathhouse was completed in 1923 in a transitional style often used in clean-lined commercial buildings of the time that were still not totally devoid of elements left over from various classical revivals: symmetry, cornices, and vague pediments articulating the front entrance. The sun porch leads into the lobby, whose north, south, and east walls are covered with murals of architectural and country scenes. Facilities including cool rooms, pack rooms and bath halls are on this floor, with the men's at the north and the women's at the south. Centered in the building is the stair core that receives natural light from a skylight above. The second floor contains massage rooms, a writing room, dressing rooms, and a gymnasium. The partial basement houses attendant rooms and mechanical equipment. The building's bathhouse operations ended in November 1985. The building is a two-story reinforced concrete structure finished with stucco on the exterior. A one-story enclosed sun porch spans nearly the entire length of the front elevation. The two-story portion is rectangular in plan. The flat roof is finished with built-up roofing material, with the exception of the metal-framed wire glass skylight. Brick and clay tiles cap the parapet edges. The Lamar is now used as the park's giftshop.  Maurice  The Maurice Construction began on the new Maurice Bathhouse in 1911 and was completed by 1912. The building was designed by George Gleim, Jr. of Chicago. The building was remodeled in 1915, following a design by George Mann and Eugene John Stern of Little Rock, which added the front sun parlor and made the white hygienic appearance warmer and more luxurious. The exterior of the Maurice Bathhouse is simple yet elegant in design. The interior of the Maurice ‚Äì patterned after the most successful contemporary European spas ‚Äì was one of the best equipped and luxurious early-20th-century American bathhouses. The Maurice is probably the best example on Bathhouse Row of a bathhouse specially designed using concrete, metal, and ceramic elements to furnish a hygienic atmosphere and specially equipped with the ultimate in early-20th-century bathing technology. Technologically advanced heating, ventilating, and vacuum-cleaning systems were installed in the Maurice to provide a comfortable, healthy atmosphere for the bather. A therapeutic pool was installed in the Maurice in 1931 to treat various forms of paralysis (spurred on by Franklin Delano Roosevelt's treatments at Warm Springs, Georgia). At this time it was also the first of the Hot Springs bathhouses to provide specialized treatment for polio and other severe muscular and joint problems, being the only one to employ a registered physical therapist. The first floor has the entrance through the front sun parlor, lobby, stairs and elevators, men's facilities to the south, and women's facilities to the north. The arches and fluted Ionic pilasters of the lobby re-emphasize the elegance presented by the front elevation. An addition to the lobby space is the orange neon \\"Maurice\\" sign on the wall behind the marble counter of the front desk. Neon signs were also found on the interior of the Superior and in other businesses in the immediate vicinity. Stained glass skylights and windows of mythical sea scenes in the men's and women's portions contribute to the sophistication of the building. The second floor contains dressing rooms, a billiard room with a mural, and various staff rooms. The third floor houses the dark-panelled Roycroft Den, named after Elbert Hubbard's New York Press, which promoted the Arts and Crafts movement in the United States. Also known as the \\"Dutch Den\\", it replaced a solarium during the 1915 remodeling. The den contains an inglenook fireplace with flanking benches and carved mascarons detail the ends of the ceiling beams. In 1930 the men's basement gymnasium was replaced when the den was converted to a gymnasium; originally there were both men's and women's gymnasiums in the basement. The building, generally square in plan, is three stories in height and contains 79 rooms and nearly (including basement). The building was designed in an eclectic combination of Renaissance Revival and Mediterranean styles commonly used by architects in California, such as Julia Morgan. The brick and concrete load-bearing walls are finished with stucco on the exterior, and inset with decorative colored tiles. The front elevation of the building is symmetrical, with a five-bay enclosed sun porch set back between the north- and south-end wings. Besides the symmetry, the hierarchy of fenestration found in Renaissance Revival buildings is also present: delicate arches of the porch window and door openings on the first floor, paired nine- light windows on the second story, and enormous rectangular openings on the third floor, further illuminated by the skylight above. Much of the roof is flat, with parapets and other sections of the roof visible from ground level are covered with green tile. The skylights are metal frames with wire glass. The concrete beams on the interior of the beam and slab floor construction are exposed, finished with plaster similar to the interior walls. Originally, this building contained 27 tubs (seven of them in the ladies' department), a Nauheim bath, and hydro-therapeutic baths; it could handle 650 bathers a day. Additional tubs were installed in 1924. A Nauheim or effervescent bath is a type of spa bath through which carbon dioxide is bubbled, named after the German spa town. p.797 Battle Creek Sanitarium also employed Nauheim baths. The Maurice represents another facet of American spa history. It provided special services, elegant appointments, and luxurious decor to attract sophisticated bathers who came to Hot Springs to fraternize with their peers. It is said that Jack Dempsey trained in the gymnasium and Elbert Hubbard based one of his Journeys booklets on W. G. Maurice and his bathhouse.  Ozark  The Ozark. The Ozark Bathhouse was completed in 1922 and designed by George Mann and Eugene John Stern of Little Rock. The building closed for use as a bathhouse in 1977. On the interior, the central lobby has a marble counter with hallways to the men's and women's facilities on either side. Mirrors cover the walls in the lobby. The floor of the sun porch is covered with quarry tile, and most of the remaining floors in the building are finished with acrylic tile. Ceilings are concrete and painted plaster. Interior walls are brick and hollow tile finished with plaster. The two-story 37-room Spanish Colonial Revival building, approximately , is constructed of brick and concrete masonry finished with stucco. The structure is trapezoidal in plan, although the impressive front elevation is symmetrically designed with twin towers composed of three-tiered setbacks flanking the main entrance. The main entrance is accessed through an enclosed sun porch, a later addition set between two pavilions that form the visual bases of the towers above them. The windows of the pavilions have decorative cartouches above them, as well as a series of rectangular setbacks that evoke a vague Art Deco appearance. Additional wings of the building continue to the north and south of the towers. The sloped roofs over the porch and part of the second story are covered with red clay tile. The hipped roofs of the towers, also covered in red clay tile, are topped with finials. The remainder of the roof is flat, with the exception of the metal-framed glass skylight over the porch. In 1928 concrete cooling tanks (finished with stucco on the exterior) were added to the rear of the building. The massage rooms were expanded in 1941. The cooling towers were removed in 1953 followed by a complete overhaul of the second story interior in 1956. The skylights were rehabilitated in 1983.  Quapaw  Quapaw Baths in 1984 Spa at Quapaw The Quapaw bathhouse was built in 1922 in a Spanish Colonial Revival style building of masonry and reinforced concrete finished with stucco. The most striking exterior feature is the large central dome covered with brilliantly colored tiles and capped with a small copper cupola. The building's use as a bathhouse ended in 1984 when the last contract ended. A new lease was signed with the National Park in 2007 and the Quapaw Bath house reopened as Quapaw Baths & Spa in July 2008. The Quapaw Bathhouse was built on the sites of two earlier bathhouses, the Horseshoe and the Magnesia, which resulted in its large land assignment on Bathhouse Row. The moderately priced bathhouse services were designed to serve the public at rates set somewhere between the lower-priced Superior and the luxurious Maurice. With an original capacity of 40 tubs the building was expected to handle about three times as many bathers as the Hale or Superior. Originally to be named the Platt Bathhouse, after one of the owners, but when a tufa cavity was discovered during excavation the owners decided to promote it as an Indian cave. It was renamed Quapaw Bathhouse in honor of a local Native American tribe that briefly held the surrounding territory after the Louisiana Purchase was made. The natural hot spring in the building's basement was publicized in promotional brochures making the cave and hot spring a popular attraction. The Quapaw had bathing facilities on its first floor making them accessible to the elderly, handicapped, and wheelchairs. Most of the floor space is in the U-shaped first floor which has a quarry-tiled lobby with sun porches on each side and massage facilities on the north and south pavilions. The rest of the first floor is divided unequally between the men's and women's bathing facilities which occupy the north and south sides respectively. The narrow rectangular second floor, running the length of the facade and topped with the dome, has dressing rooms and a lounge. The Quapaw was the moderately priced bathhouse with none of the extras such as beauty parlors. Baths, vapors, showers and cooling rooms were provided with massages and some electro-therapy also offered. The partial basement contains a laundry (moved there in the late 1940s), mechanical equipment and a tufa chamber housing the Quapaw spring. Directly above the entrance is a cartouche with a carved Indian head set into the decorative double-curved parapet. The Indian motif, found in several other places in the bathhouse, was used to reinforce the promotional \\"Legend of the Quapaw Baths\\" which claimed that the Indians had discovered the magical healing powers of the cave and spring which were now housed in the building's basement. The double-curved parapets at the north and south ends of the building are capped with scalloped shells that frame spiny sculpin fish. The shell and the fish both emphasize the aquatic aspect of the building. The scalloped shell is a common architectural element found in Spanish Colonial and Revival buildings. Originally the symbol was used to represent Santiago de Campostela, the patron saint of Spain, but it evolved into a mere decorative element in secular revival buildings such as this. The sculpins, originally painted gold, are now painted white. On the front elevation a series of arched windows is interrupted by a central pavilion that forms the entrance. The arched entrance doorway is flanked by two smaller arches. Further emphasizing the entrance are two large finials that project out of the roofline of the second story, visually framing the dome behind them. The dome's mosaic is chevron-patterned with a band of rectangular and diamond patterns encircling its base. The dome rests on an octagonal base and a new compression ring was installed after 2004. The sloped roofs of the first and second floor are visible from the front elevation and are covered with red clay tiles. Portions of the roof that are not visible from the ground are flat. The interior of the building is more than . In 1928 the portico across the front of the building was winterized with glass enclosures in the window openings which was removed in the early 21st century. Acoustic tile ceilings were added in the men's first cooling room and the women's pack room. Some of the outside walls were insulated the following year. New partitions were installed in 1944 to allow more space for massage facilities. The display spring in the basement was covered with plate glass in the mid-1950s. Closed in 1968, it was reopened as Health Services, Inc. with only 20 tubs and services that were oriented towards hydrotherapy and physical therapy. It was the only bathhouse open on evenings and weekends. It regained its original name a year before it was closed in 1984 following the discovery of major damage to plaster ceilings and skylights. The exterior was sandblasted, repaired and repainted its original white color in 1976. Work began in August 2007 to ready the building for its new use with pools added so that whole families can enjoy the spring water together and the bathhouse re-opened to the public in 2008.  Superior  Superior Baths The northernmost bathhouse on the row is the Superior which was completed in 1916 and designed by architect Harry C. Schwebke of Hot Springs, Arkansas. The building is designed in an eclectic commercial style of Classical Revival origin. The building has two stories and a basement, is L-shaped in plan and is constructed of brick masonry and reinforced concrete. It contains 23 rooms and is more than . The building was constructed on the site of an 1880s Victorian style Superior bathhouse. Brick from the previous bathhouse may have been reused in this structure. Principal exterior architectural details are on the front elevation. The three bays are separated by brick pilasters with patterned insets and decorated with concrete painted in an imitation of ornamental tiles. Green tile medallions (paterae) are centered over the pilasters in the friezes below the first and second story cornices. Both roofs are flat and topped with brick parapets. The cornice and exterior trim are painted metal and stone. The one-story sun porch at the front elevation projects out from the main mass of the two-story building. The first floor contains the sun porch, the lobby flanked by the stairs and the bathing facilities. The men's bath hall, dressing rooms and pack room are on the longer north end of the building. The women's facilities are smaller and located on the south side of the building. The two stairways leading upstairs have marble treads and balusters with tile wainscoting on the walls. The second floor is divided down the middle with dressing facilities, cooling rooms and massage rooms on either side for men and women with each served by its own stairs. Bath stalls are marble-walled with tile floors and solid porcelain tubs. The front desk in the lobby is marble while most of the interior hardware is brass. Walls vary from painted plaster to marble (men's hot room) and tile (bath halls). The double hung wood‚Äìframe windows have twelve lights over one light. A concrete ramp edged with wrought iron railings provides a central entrance to the structure. A cooling tank and steel frame to support it were added to the rear of the building in 1920. The building was damaged by a flood in 1923 but the extent of repairs is not known. Some remodeling was completed on the interior in the 1930s, but again the extent of those changes is unknown. In 1957 the massage room was extended, wall radiators were installed, floors were re-tiled and modern lighting fixtures were added. Many of the original furnishings were also replaced at that time. Other changes to the building include the installation of whirlpool equipment in 1962 and air conditioning in 1971. The Superior closed in 1983 and the furnishings were sold at auction. The Superior currently serves as a brewery and restaurant.  Administration building  South entrance of Administration building Finishing the southern corner of the row is the Administration building which was formerly the National Park Service Visitor Center. Constructed in 1936, this Spanish Colonial Revival building was designed by architects of the Eastern Division, Branch of Plans and Design from the National Park Service. The well-detailed building has a simplified Spanish Baroque doorway framed by pilasters topped with frieze, cornice and finials flanking a second story window. The window has rusticated moldings at its sides and is in turn capped with a broken arched pediment. Windows on the first floor are screened by wrought iron grilles. On the second story there are five‚Äìlight French doors that open on to wrought iron balconies. The hip roof is covered with clay tile. The air-conditioning system was replaced in 1960. The first floor was remodelled in 1966 to accommodate a lobby and an audio-visual room. Steps up to the front door were enlarged in 1965 and the hand railing may have been put in at that time. The building remains in use as the administrative core of the park.  Other features  Grand Promenade Other outdoor features are within the historic district boundaries. The Grand Promenade runs in a north-south direction on the hillside behind the bathhouses, between Reserve Avenue and Fountain Street. Construction on the promenade began in the 1930s and by the beginning of World War II the promenade was a graded pathway covered with gravel. After many false starts due to planning and funding problems the promenade was finally completed in the early 1960s. The paving brick was replaced in 1984. Fountains for public use have been located in the vicinity since the area was developed and several remain today. The fountain directly in front of the stairway into the administration building is of cast concrete and was built in 1936. A new jug fountain on the sidewalk in front of the administration building was installed in 1966. The Noble fountain at the Reserve Avenue end of the Promenade moved to this location in 1957. The Maurice Spring fountain and retaining wall just north of the Maurice Bathhouse was completed in 1903. The original main entrance to the reservation was between the Maurice and Fordyce bathhouses directly below the Stevens Balustrade, at about the center of Bathhouse Row. The two bronze federal eagles on their stone pillars still stand guard over the old entrance, forming a gateway to the concrete path that leads between the two bathhouses up to the baroque double staircase of the balustrade. Below the eagles are the names of Secretaries of the Interior Hoke Smith (1893‚Äì96) and John Noble (1889‚Äì93) and \\"U.S. Hot Springs Reservation.\\" The balustrade itself is of limestone ashlar masonry and concrete construction. The central bay houses a vaulted hemicycle niche containing a drinking fountain. The upper portion of the balustrade leads to the Promenade. A bandstand was located along the top of the balustrade on the Promenade, but it was removed because of its deteriorated condition in 1958. By the early 1970s curbs and paving at the old main entrance constructed in the 1890s had been changed and Holly trees were planted to border the entryway. The areas around the bases of the stone pillars, originally paved, were grass-covered by that time. Several other entrances were located at various points along the linear development of Bathhouse Row during the 1890s but have disappeared over the years as a result of newer construction. None were as elaborate as the Main Entrance which still gives a sense of \\"high style\\" to Bathhouse Row. Army engineer Stevens was also responsible for establishing the Magnolia Promenade in front of the bathhouses. The Promenade had double rows of magnolias during the 1890s but now a single row separates the sidewalk and the street. The varied architectural styles of the Bathhouses are pulled together by the linear greenbelts of the Magnolia Promenade and the Grand Promenade and by the smaller hedges and bushes that soften the edges of the spaces between the buildings.  History  Archeological evidence has proven that the hot springs which later supplied the water for Bathhouse Row were used prehistorically for thousands of years. In local Indian mythology the valley of the hot springs was considered neutral ground, a healing place and the sacred territory of the Great Spirit. Close to the springs is a novaculite quarry that was used as a source for material for tools, weapons and household goods. Hernando de Soto may have visited the hot springs in 1541 in his quest for gold, silver and jewels. By 1807 the first permanent white settler was living in the area and shortly after a number of log cabins had been built in the vicinity.  Emergence of formal bathing and health benefits  The first bathhouses were log and wood-frame structures built from 1830 through the 1850s and were used well into the late 19th century. By the mid-19th century the bathing industry in the United States, following elegant European precedents, was establishing more complex bathing rituals. This was influenced by the mid-19th-century promotion of the field of hydrotherapy as a popular medical tool. Newer bathhouses gradually showed influences of Spanish Renaissance architecture.  Government involvement alongside private development  Although the area had been set aside as the first federal reservation in 1832 government acquisition of the lands did not take place until 1879. By that time private development had established its own north‚Äìsouth linear building pattern along the creek and hot springs. The bathhouses were constructed along the east edge of Hot Springs Creek which was covered over and channeled into a masonry arch in 1884. This eliminated the separate bridges to each bathhouse and also improved sanitation in the area. The space above the arch was filled with dirt and planted, so that each bathhouse now had its own garden space. Central Avenue after 1925 From 1892 until 1900 the Department of the Interior undertook a massive beautification project to improve the character of the \\"National Health Resort\\". The main landscape thrust of the program was to provide formal gardens in front of the bathhouses and more \\"natural\\" landscaped areas behind. The range of landscaping would provide areas for restful walks with enough connection to nature and the outdoors to ensure a healthy atmosphere for recuperation. Frederick Law Olmsted's landscape architectural firm was hired to produce plans for the area but those plans were rejected or left unfinished for a variety of reasons. The project development was given to an Army engineer, Lieutenant Robert Stevens. Stevens designed the entrances to the reservation including the historic main entrance. He also conceived of the Magnolia Promenade in front of the bathhouses, the meandering upper terrace behind the bathhouses, a series of pathways, carriage roads and vest-pocket parks. Massage services were added in the bathhouses in the late 1890s and later chiropodists.  The Jim Crow period  When Civil War Reconstruction ended in 1877 Jim Crow laws were created which required racial separation of facilities. As this did not formally require separation of workers, African‚ÄìAmerican workers found that although they could work in the bathhouses, they could not use them for bathing. Although the federal government regulated the bathhouses, local tradition prevailed until segregation ended in the 1960s. During this period African‚ÄìAmericans primarily bathed at bathhouses operated by African‚ÄìAmericans. In the 1880s black patrons could buy bath tickets at the Ozark Bathhouse, the Independent Bathhouse and possibly the Rammelsberg Bathhouse, but they were not allowed to bathe during the hours considered optimum by prescribing physicians, particularly from 10 A.M. to 12 noon. This briefly changed in 1890 when the Independent was purchased by A.C. Page, who operated it as an exclusively black bathhouse for less than a year. William G. Maurice then purchased it, remodeled it and reopened it as the Maurice Bathhouse, an older building than the current Maurice, serving white patrons only. An assortment of buildings and services provided bathing for African‚ÄìAmericans during the period, and until the 1980s most bath attendants were African‚ÄìAmericans. Away from Bathhouse Row National Baptist Hotel and Sanatorium Originally known as the Woodmen of the Union Building (not located on Bathhouse Row) Facilities were built to serve the Black community ‚Äî but not along Bathhouse Row until the Crystal Bathhouse opened in 1904. It was located at 415 Malvern Avenue at the edge of the African‚ÄìAmerican business district. The Crystal burned in the 1913 fire. The Knights of Pythias raised the Pythian on the site of the Crystal Bathhouse in 1914. The Pythian operated successfully until desegregation in 1965 when it began operating part-time until the building finally closed in 1974. The Woodmen of the Union Building opened in 1922. This building included a first- class hotel 2000-seat theater and auditoriam for meetings of up to 600, a gymnasium, a print shop, a beauty parlor and a news‚Äìstand. After 1922 black people had two facilities available when the African American National Baptist Convention bought the Woodmen of the Union Building in 1948. In addition to the services offered by the Woodmen, the facility hosted the annual National Baptist Association Convention until the early 1980s. It closed in 1983.  The 20th century  By 1900, the Hot Springs Reservation landscape had both the informal Victorian landscape design and the more formal post-1880s design. A series of bathhouses had been constructed and, through the early decades of the 20th century, the parade of buildings continued. At first, wooden bathhouses were constructed and then replaced after fires or deterioration made them unsafe. Architects began choosing materials less prone to deterioration and fire. The most notable of the period's fires caused destruction of 60 blocks south of the row in 1916 with Central Avenue almost lost as well. The changes to the bathhouses over time reflected changes in the bathing industry, changes in technology, and changes in social mores. By the start of the 20th century, Hot Springs became an attraction for fashionable people all over the world to visit and partake of the baths, while maintaining its reputation as a healing place for the sickly. In 1910, the government employed a doctor as medical director of the bathhouses who improved sanitation and bath attendant training. So many establishments were fraudulently soliciting customers that such promotion was barred by the City Council in 1899 although prosecution was necessary for thirty more years. In the early 20th century, park superintendent Martin Eisele thought no new bathhouses were needed and the buildings date from that period. It had also been noted that wood buildings rotted due to the high humidity and the structures of this generation of buildings featured concrete, steel and brick. A few other key points in the history of Bathhouse Row affected the natural and architectural landscape resulting in what remains today. In 1916, Stephen Mather, director of the National Park Service, brought landscape architect Jens Jensen down from Chicago to enhance Bathhouse Row. Under his direction lights were placed along the street promenade and various flower gardens were cultivated in front of the bathhouses. George Mann and Eugene John Stern of Little Rock were hired in 1917 to do a comprehensive plan of Bathhouse Row to guide its future development. In their view a Spanish and Mediterranean Revival architectural theme was appropriate for the \\"Great American Spa\\". The intervention of World War I stopped their grand plans although their designs and review of other bathhouse plans had a strong influence on the architectural character of Bathhouse Row. In the 1930s the design of a new hot water system for the bathhouses resulted in changes to curbs, plantings and gutters along the Magnolia Promenade. Although the creek adjoins the bathhouses the bathing and drinking water is piped from several springs and wells. The more formally aligned Grand Promenade at the rear of the bathhouses, begun in the 1930s and completed in the 1960s, replaced the meandering Victorian path and changed the architectural character of area. The Maurice and Fordyce bathhouses were strategically located at the north and south sides of the historic entrance to the reservation. Both of these buildings provided bathing experiences for the wealthy. The elegant interiors and quality of service attracted an upper class clientele. The placement of the two most architecturally significant structures at the main entrance set the refined architectural character of Bathhouse Row. Both were luxurious in design and were equipped with sophisticated bathing facilities. The Maurice and Fordyce also offered additional attractions: The Fordyce catered to more than the client's physical needs by providing diversions such as a museum displaying prehistoric artifacts, roof gardens, a bowling alley and a gymnasium. The Maurice had its Roycroft Den, or Dutch Den, that served as a gathering place for well-to-do clients. In 1920 the Fordyce and Buckstaff added musicians playing light classical music and popular tunes.  Changes in late 20th century  Facilities in the bathhouses included licensing for the number of tubs along with spraying facilities such as water jets and needle showers. A doctor's prescription was required for some medical services which were provided. Although baths could be taken without the advice of a physician this practice was not recommended. It was advised that baths only be taken for diseases which they could improve along with the proper drugs for the condition. Services included mercury rubs (used since the 16th century for treating syphilis), enemas and massages. The first whirlpool bath was installed in 1937. Mercury treatments began to be replaced by the drug Salvarsan after its invention in 1908 and the clinic above the Government Free Bathhouse began furnishing Salvarsan treatments in 1920. These were finally rendered obsolete by the discovery of penicillin and its widespread manufacture after World War II allowed syphilis to be effectively and reliably cured. After World War II the bathing industry had large crowds of visitors. In 1946 people took 649,270 hot tub baths establishing a new record. Modern antibiotics developed during the war diminished the use of the thermal waters for medical purposes. Changes in American society prevented many people from taking the long, leisurely vacations that characterized the 19th-century spa life and the automobile allowed Americans to visit more places in a single vacation. During the post-war years visitation to the park increased but visitation to the bathhouses decreased after 1946. By the 1960s society's needs had changed. The bathhouses became anachronisms as post-Victorian buildings which housed post-Victorian functions. Americans began participating more in various recreational activities and moved away from the social promenading of the spas. Spas that survived this period emphasized a total program of diet, exercise and bathing. Exercise and diet were not adequately addressed by the bathhouse operators in Hot Springs. Bathing practices in Hot Springs became identified with an older generation and few young people took the full course of 21 baths. By 1979 only 96,000 baths were given on Bathhouse Row. The economics of this labor-intensive industry began to force the bathhouses to close down. The elegant Fordyce Bathhouse was the first to close in 1962 followed by the Maurice, the Ozark and the Hale in the 1970s. In 1984 the Quapaw, briefly reincarnated as Health Services, Inc., and the Superior closed. The Lamar closed in 1985 leaving the Buckstaff as the only bathhouse still operating on Bathhouse Row.  Present  Aerial view of Hot Springs National Park showing the historic Bathhouse Row. Fourth from the left is the Fordyce Bathhouse which serves as the park visitor center. The Buckstaff, Fordyce and Administration buildings are the three buildings presently open to the public. All of the buildings on Bathhouse Row have certain architectural elements in common that contribute to the district's unity: * All of the buildings are set back the same distance from the sidewalk, and have garden areas and green spaces in front. * They are all of similar height, scale, and proportions. * The sidewalk and remaining Magnolia Promenade (there is one row of magnolia trees rather than the original two) to the west and Grand Promenade to the east tie the buildings together. What makes that unity successful in an architectural sense is the diversity that exists within it. The eclectic combination of styles and materials provides texture and visual interest amongst them. The free use of Greek, Roman, Spanish and Italian architectural idioms emphasize the high style sought after by the planners and create a strong sense of place. What remains on Bathhouse Row are the architectural remnants of a bygone era when bathing was considered an elegant pastime for the rich and famous and a path to well-being for those with various ailments. Today only the Buckstaff provides baths and related services. Throughout the country 19th-century bathing rituals have been replaced by late-20th-century health spas that emphasize physical fitness and diet though some provide bathing as part of the regimen. The bath is no longer the central feature of rejuvenation provided by spas in the United States. Advances in medicine and the high costs of medical care have diminished the importance of bathing in physical therapy. The need for bathhouses on the scale of Bathhouse Row no longer exists. Bathhouse Row is the largest collection of 20th-century bathhouses remaining in the United States from the industry's peak from the 1920s through the 1940s. Bathhouse Row is also one of the few collections of historic bathhouses remaining in the United States. As an entity Bathhouse Row represents an area unique to the National Park System as an area where the natural resources historically were harnessed and used rather than preserved in their natural state. On a regional level of significance the bathhouses also form the architectural core of downtown Hot Springs, Arkansas. Pickup truck enthusiasts have enjoyed the vintage neighborhood during Saturday night cruising among the steaming manholes and free water fountains. Several nonprofit groups have helped with projects such as restoring the Fordyce and Maurice. According to the National Historic Landmarks Program the status of Bathhouse Row was threatened as most of the historic bathhouses were vacant and are not being maintained. Some have had \\"damaging uses\\" contributing to the severe physical deterioration of the majority of the historic bathhouses. Bathhouse Row was added to the National Trust for Historic Preservation list of \\"11 Most Endangered Places\\" in 2003. It was removed in May 2007 because the National Park Service began to rehabilitate the buildings. Hot Springs National Park now rents the renovated structures to commercial enterprises who submit an approved request for qualifications. The restoration of Bathhouse Row and commercial leasing of public structures has become a model for similar projects across the country. Fordyce Bathhouse was restored in 1989 as the park's visitor center and the beginning of restoring all properties on Bathhouse Row. The property was closed and renovated between 2012 and 2013, with the Lamar serving as the visitor center in the interim. The Lamar was renovated into offices for park staff and Bathhouse Row Emporium, the park's official store. Ozark Bathhouse was renovated and opened as the Museum of Contemporary Art of Hot Springs in 2009. The museum closed in November 2013, and the NPS is currently receiving proposals for new occupants. Superior and Hale bathhouses went under contract in 2012 following renovation with Vapor Valley Spirits Inc. and Muses Creative Artistry Project, respectively. As of 2014, Superior Bathhouse Brewery and Distillery continues to operate, but the Hale is again available for rent. Buckstaff Bathhouse has been in continuous operation since 1912, and thus is one of the best-preserved structures on Bathhouse Row. The Buckstaff Bathhouse Company has completed the majority of maintenance and renovation that has occurred without outside funding.

It operated from 3 February 1862 to 30 May 1901, with the last mineral traffic on the incline section operated in January 1866. This line was the first \\"railway\\" to be opened and operated in New Zealand, preceding the first public railway and the first railway to be operated by steam trains, the line between Ferrymead and Christchurch, which opened on 1 December 1863. The city of Nelson had the first city tramway to both open and close in New Zealand.  History = Background  Prominent advocates for the mining of mineral deposits found on Wooded Peak included a syndicate formed by William Long Wrey, William Travers and William Wells. In the winter of 1853 a local runholder, George Duppa, discovered a large deposit of chromite between Wooded Peak and Dun Mountain, about 8 kilometers south-east of Nelson township. It was named the Duppa Lode, but considered to be of no commercial value at the time. The syndicate readily agreed that in order to exploit the mineral deposits a tramway would need to transport the product back to Nelson. After attempts to raise capital for the project locally failed in August 1853, Wrey headed to England in October to raise further capital. His efforts were successful, resulting in the formation of the New Zealand Land Fund Association backed by 20 London financiers, who had each contributed ¬£500. Wrey returned to New Zealand on 8 August 1855 with 24 miners and an engineer, Jeremiah How. In early 1857 the Dun Mountain Copper Mining Company Ltd. formed, and shareholders in the Cook's Straight Company previously formed by the mining syndicate were able to exchange their shares for fully paid-up ones in the new company, with a further 5,000 B shares reserved for sale in New Zealand. The first shareholders' meeting of the company took place on 22 July 1857. Investors learned of plans to construct a long light railway along the Maitai Valley - to be worked up the incline by horses and in the opposite direction by gravity. To determine the extent of the copper deposits on which the company could rely the directors employed mining engineer Thomas R. Hacket. A local management committee was appointed to assist Hacket, consisting of Wrey, Wells, merchant George Ridings and Maxwell Bury as secretary. Hacket arrived in Nelson on 31 October 1857 and set about appraising the copper deposits, which he found wanting. Rather than make known in Nelson his disappointing first impression, he allowed the survey for the Maitai Valley railway to go ahead. On completion of the survey, conducted by local engineer Edward Moody, the first consignment of tramway materials arrived from London on 11 January 1858. They were stored in the company's yard on Haven Road pending the enactment of the necessary railway legislation. By 1858 word had spread locally of Hacket's negative reports on the deposits, causing considerable antagonism between Hacket and Wrey. Some of the shareholders in London were sufficiently angry to claim that Wrey had defrauded them. Though Wrey was never subjected to legal action, he was removed from the Nelson management committee. Though it was realised that there were no commercially exploitable copper deposits in the mineral belt, Hacket was sufficiently impressed with the chromite deposits that had earlier been found on Wooded Peak. The directors were thus dissuaded from liquidating the company while awaiting the testing of chromite samples forwarded to England. As these new mineral deposits were at a higher elevation on Wooded Peak the earlier proposed route of the tramway along the Maitai Valley had become redundant, and Hacket set about investigating a more direct route around Wooded Peak. Testing confirmed the high quality of the ore, later confirmed by Joseph Gibbs in June 1858. In 1859 Hacket demonstrated with underground prospecting that the deposits persisted below the surface. With his favourable reports extolling the extent of the ore available, the directors were convinced to begin mining, which would involve a tramway from the Coppermine Saddle to Nelson Port. On 24 February 1860 notice was given of the company's intention to seek legislative approval for the construction of a tramway along a route chosen by Hacket.  Construction  Stack of wooden ties beside the Dun Mountain Railway in heavily wooded country Two Irish engineers with railway experience, William Doyne assisted by Abraham Fitzgibbon, were engaged by the directors to manage the construction of the line. They arrived in Nelson along with the Fitzgibbon's family on 18 July 1860. They quickly dismissed Hacket's proposal and agreed that a better route to Wooded Peak was to be had through the Brook Valley. This change in plans was not well received by the committee that had been appointed to study the proposal as submitted for the accompanying legislation, which was accordingly withdrawn by the company. The earthworks for the long section between the mines and the Wairoa Saddle were put out to tender in 1861 and awarded the following February to contractors Charles Ambler, John Davis and Robert Carter, each working on approximately equal lengths. The work included a wide ledge in the side of Wooded Peak, drainage and six bridges. The route of the next section from Brook Street to the Wairoa Saddle was debated amongst the engineers, but they eventually settled on a gradient of 1:18 for the first with the rest at 1:20. This was divided into seven sections that were put to tender and let on 3 June 1861 to, amongst others, the contractors Hale, Vercoe and party; John Ward and John Mitchell; John Brown and George Cummins; and W. Martin and John Avery. The company advertised for a supply of 20,000 sleepers after rejecting a trial in which sleepers had been cut from trees adjoining the rail formation. The price they were quoted in response was ¬£1 per hundred more than the price they had earlier received for sleepers supplied from their own land, but having spent two months on the tender process they decided to proceed with the tenders received from the sawmills. Approximately 24,000 sleepers were required. On 17 August the Act authorising the construction of the railway on public lands was passed. It was based on earlier bills from the Provincial Council and one of 1860 which was withdrawn over the issue of the route of the line. The act allowed the company to begin construction of the line from the incline section through Nelson, following Brook, Tasman, Manuka, Alton, Hardy, and Rutherford Streets, and along the shoreline on Haven Road to the port. Three contracts for this section were let in late August 1861 to contractors Mark Blythe and Robert Carter. Work on the town section was completed within four months. At around the same time work commenced on the formation between the incline and the port, Dudderidge Gibbs submitted a successful tender for track laying work on the incline section. This work started on 4 September 1861, but it was soon clear that it would not be completed by the end of the year as expected. Eager to begin revenue traffic on the line, the company dismissed Gibbs despite his protestations, and continued the work itself on 23 September. The final shipment of rails arrived on 25 October 1861, numbering 2,314, including 26 casks of bolts. The last rail was laid in January 1862.  Inauguration  Opening of Dun Mountain tramway, 3 Feb 1862 The railway was officially opened on 3 February 1862. Around ¬£75,000 had been spent, of which approximately a third went into the construction of the railway. At noon, horse-drawn paired wagons left the company depot in Brook Street for the port, with the Nelson Brass Band being seated in the first pair of wagons. The next set of wagons carried company officials and guests, also on temporary seating. The remaining wagons were loaded with ore. The procession proceeded along streets lined with the local inhabitants, who had earlier erected flags and banners. Once the procession reached the port and the ore had been dumped at the privately owned Albion Wharf, they returned to town. In gratitude for the efforts of the men who had been involved in the construction of the line, the company gave each of them a paid holiday, and treated them to a lunch at the Freemasons' Hall. As was then customary several speeches were given, after which a toast was offered to Wrey. The day's festivities were concluded with a soiree and ball.  Operation  Freight services = Freight train of the Dun Mountain railway. Trucks were pulled up the grade by horses, and descended by gravity. The tramway's act of parliament prohibited the use of locomotives within the city limits. This was no real problem for the company, as they had always intended to work the line with horses and rely on gravity for descending ore wagons. The horses averaged when pulling empty wagons up the incline to the mines, where they were unhitched and returned to First House on Brook Street. Once the wagons were full, they descended to Nelson in pairs under the control of a brakeman. Trials were undertaken to determine safe working procedures for descending wagons. It was soon discovered that as the line had over 700 corners ranging from radius, descending speeds in excess of meant an unacceptable risk of derailment. At the bottom of the incline the wagons usually retained sufficient momentum to continue unaided to the corner of Hardy and Rutherford Streets. The wagons were then hauled by horses at up to through the city to the port where the ore was later shipped to England from the Provincial Government owned wharf. In February 1862 the company prohibited the carriage of any persons in the wagons on the line as the entire capacity of the 20 wagons was required for the transport of the ore. Horses hauled the empty wagons up to the mine in the mornings, and once loaded they departed for the port under gravity at 13:15. The distance was expected to be covered in 45 minutes to Third House, with a further 1 hour and 30 minutes to the Alton Street depot. Any trip conducted in less than the allotted time could lead to the dismissal of the brakeman for speeding. On 23 March 1862 the capacity of the line was increased with the arrival of an additional 25 wagons. In late 1862 Fitzgibbon had to tell the directors in London that the ore was not available in such abundance as was first thought. It was no longer profitable to continue to mine the chromite, and after transporting around of the ore mining operations were suspended from early 1863. Thereafter, the company relied on sales of firewood, timber, flagstones and road gravel from its own land, and revenue from the passenger \\"city bus\\" (a horse-dawn tram) to meet their overheads. This generated only around ¬£1,300 per year, approximately a quarter from the passenger operation. However, by mid-1863 the chromite market showed signs of improvement, allowing the company to sell of ore and receive forward orders for an additional either stored in England or en route from Nelson. In order to stabilise the demand for its ore, the company purchased a controlling stake in Connah's Quay Chemical Company, a dye manufacturer due to be established in North Wales. Confident in the security of the market for chromite, the company resumed mining on Wooded Peak later that year. With the departure of Hacket, the company sought to hire someone with mining experience to support the Nelson management team, and accordingly appointed an experienced mining engineer by the name of Joseph Cock from Tavistock in Devon as the new manager. The company had also developed some new sources of revenue, including lime from a kiln built at Wooded Peak, gravel for use on the roads, and the leasing of wagons to local merchants for the transport of inbound goods from the port to Nelson. Traffic increased on the line to levels not seen for some time when the mining resumed. During 1863 the mines produced of ore for export, over half of which was exported in November. Congestion at the port was such that permission was obtained from the Board of Works to install a loop siding on Haven Road at Auckland Point, though it is not known if this work was completed. Other small safety improvements were also made. = Passenger services = Though the railway was initially used only for the transport of ore to the port, the company had made provision for the operation of both freight and passenger services. The railway's act of Parliament required the company to institute at least one daily return service between the city and the port, except where the revenue from all services failed to exceed 10 shillings. Horse tram on Hardy Street from Trafalgar Street via Rutherford Street, Haven Road to the Tasman Hotel at the port. It operated until 1901 as last remnant of the old Dun Mountain railway. The company already had wagons in which to conduct its freight traffic, so for the passenger services they ordered a horse-drawn tram in late 1861 from the Australian firm of Keary and Company. The tram was soon known as a bus, also referred to as the Dun Mountain Bus or the City Bus, and later as a tram. It arrived in Nelson on 23 March 1862. The first operator of the tram was Thomas Nesbitt, a long-time local who arrived in Nelson in 1842. The inaugural service of the tram occurred on Saturday, 3 May 1862. A trial run between the city and the port showed amongst other things that fears the tram would be unstable when fully laden on account of the narrow gauge were not warranted. Vibrations were experienced, however, due to the wheels being locked to the axles. Fare paying passengers were carried throughout the day, with regular services commencing at 0900 the following Monday. The tram departed every half-hour from either the Port or Hardy Street termini, providing a reliable daily service. Though the legislation specified a speed limit of , in practice average speeds of were maintained. Among the conditions imposed by the company on the operator, he had to provide services between 0900 and sunset at not more than 6d per fare (the fare cap did not apply to services operated outside these times). As the company was originally established to profit from the chromite ore, which was at the time making them in excess of ¬£1,000 in revenue per week, the local management saw no need to burden themselves with the running of passenger services. Later that year the company realised that in not taking an interest in the passenger services they were forgoing a reasonable source of revenue, and accordingly entered into a leasing arrangement with the operator. Late in 1863 James McConkey purchased the lease on the tram and introduced some changes, including freeing the wheels to turn independently of the axles. This had the benefit of making the ride more comfortable and reducing wear on both the tram and rails. He also reduced the daylight running fare to 3d, though the after dark fare remained unaltered. McConkey's tenure as operator of the tram lasted to the mid-1860s, by which time he had become a timber merchant. An increase in confidence in the company's future subsequent to the resumption of mining activities in 1863 led to debate on whether the line should be extended into Trafalgar and Bridge Streets. Despite popular support for such a move no-one was prepared to finance it, and there was a small band of vocal opponents, including competing transport operators. Though their concerns were largely commercial, it is easy to see that the tram was providing strong competition, for in mid-February 1864 the services were increased to half-hourly in both directions. City departures were on the hour and half-hour, with Port departures 15 minutes later. At around the time Cock arrived, further changes were made to the operation of the tram. In July 1864 railway by-laws were introduced that forbade smoking on the tram and the carrying of inebriated passengers, and introduced penalties for failing to purchase a ticket. By April 1866 the tram was being operated by William Weeden and Alfred Brind. It was during their tenure that the tram received its first refurbishment, during which time passenger services were provided using wagons with temporary seating. On encountering financial difficulties in the winter of 1866 Weeden terminated his connection with the tram, with Brind doing likewise soon after. The lease was picked up by the Brays. In 1870 the Brays relinquished the lease on the tram, which was briefly taken over by William Taylor, who had earlier worked as a driver of the tram for the Brays. The following year, the lease passed to Stevenson and McGlashan, and in early 1872 to Thomas Newton. In the winding up of the company the line between Nelson and the port, including the passenger operation, was sold in June 1872 as a going concern to Moses Crewdson by Levien. With the mining operation gone the line was essentially passenger only, with only the occasional carriage of goods on the line for Crewdson. The line was still subject to the provisions of the Dun Mountain Railway Act. Crewdson renovated the service, including rehabilitating the line and painting the tram. The service was renamed to Crewdson's City Bus, and employed several drivers in addition to Crewdson himself and several stable hands to tend to the horses. At some point an additional tram was purchased, with the original tram thereafter only being used when passenger demand or maintenance on the new tram required it. Crewdson had been unable to come to an acceptable agreement regarding the sale of the tram service to the council, so in June 1884 he sold the operation to its last owner, Jonathan Harle. Though Harle was interested in maximising his revenue from the service he was equally determined to spend as little on maintenance as possible, with the only apparent change to the service on the transfer of ownership being the removal of Crewdson's name from the livery. He continued with the postal delivery contract established by his predecessor, and came to an arrangement with the proprietor of the Marine Baths on Wakefield Quay whereby he could sell concession tickets covering a return fare and use of the baths.  Demise  Freight services = The revival in the company's fortunes was short lived. By the autumn of 1864, after exporting 768 tonnes of ore that year, it was discovered that the chromite deposits had been worked out, leaving only small pockets of low-grade ore. Again mining was suspended, though the company continued to use the incline to rail out firewood, rock and lime. The company was keen to secure reliable shipments of chromite from its mines to supply Connah's Quay Chemical Company, which was by this time ready to commence operations. Because the new manager, Joseph Cock, had yet to arrive in Nelson, a geological survey of the mines was conducted on 1 June 1864 by Dr James Hector, an assayer working for the Otago Provincial Government. On 5 July 1864 Cock and his family arrived in Nelson. The directors were disappointed when on examining the mines Cock came to the same conclusion that had already been conveyed to them regarding the chromite supplies. He set about prospecting other areas in the mineral belt in an attempt to find other workable lodes of chromite, including a deposit below the railway which would have required a branch line to be constructed. In the end, Cock reported that constructing such a line would not be financially viable. Cock estimated that revenue from other sources would be almost sufficient to cover overheads, so any decision on the future of the company was deferred. As part of the retrenchment measures, the secretary was terminated in August 1865. Cock was also authorised to extract the remaining 400 tonnes of ore from the mines, though because of its inferior quality, only 281 tonnes of it was exported. Mining operations ceased in January 1866. In March 1866 the London-based directors resolved to liquidate the company, though this was not carried out. They tried without success to sell the assets of the company in April 1867 and again in March 1868. Though there was no hope that chromite or copper mining would resume, the company remained hopeful that other mineral resources would be found on its land, and in October 1869 halted plans to sell or dismantle the railway. Surveys conducted the following year and in September 1871 by the New Zealand Geological Survey confirmed that there were no commercially viable mineral deposits. As a result of these reports the directors decided in 1871 to liquidate the company. The following year, the company's assets were advertised for sale by auction. As the date for the auction drew near, Cock wrote to the Board of Works suggesting that they consider purchasing the railway to safeguard their supply of rock that the company had been producing. The Board advised that though it was not legally able to purchase the railway itself, it could be considered by the provincial council. A public meeting was held to discuss the proposal on 10 May, at which the consensus was to not proceed with the proposal, despite a minority advocating the idea, so as to be able to completely remove it. Five days later, all of the assets of the company were sold by auctioneers William Stavert and Company to local merchant Robert Levien. Considering the investment made and the valuation of the company's assets, the price attained of only ¬£4,750 was a poor result. After confirming that the provincial council had no interest in the railway, Levien was quick to split up and sell off the assets. The line from Trafalgar Street to the mines was lifted and sold to various buyers, with this work complete by the end of 1872. The Alton Street yard was sold to Sir David Munro in September 1873, and the timber processing machinery had already been sold to James Burford. Three months later the company's land at Wooded Peak was sold to James Newport. = Passenger services = By July 1893 the tram had been running for over 30 years and the maintenance costs were rising at an unacceptable rate, with much of this attributable to the run-down state of the assets, particularly the rails. Harle resolved to sell the operation and put everything up for sale by tender. When no tenders were received to his satisfaction, he approached the council to see if it was interested in purchasing it. As it were in some financial difficulties and realising that a significant expense would be involved in upgrading the railway, it declined Harle's offer. On 18 January 1901 the council received a petition from Hardy Street business owners and cab drivers demanding that something be done about the parlous state of the railway. The council held a meeting to consider the petition, and the majority of councillors were in favour of purchasing and dismantling the railway, though the minority were in favour of retaining it. Following this meeting, the council's finance committee was authorised to conduct due diligence on the railway. At the next council meeting, on 5 February, an offer from Harle for the sale of the tram operation including all assets bar the Haven Road property was tabled. The council agreed to commence negotiations, but first needed to obtain statutory authorisation from a ratepayer plebiscite as a loan would need to be raised. The poll was conducted on 19 April 1901, with the result being 369 in favour, 244 against and 12 informal of a total of 625 ballots cast from 1,591 eligible voters. Six days later a new council was elected, which quickly confirmed the intention to purchase and close the railway. A problem was encountered when the council was reminded by the Treasury that it would be illegal for them to raise a loan under the Loans to Local Bodies Act, which they resolved by instead issuing debentures on 15 May 1901. The city purchased the railway and trams on 30 May 1901, with the last fare-paying journey being made the same day. This service to the port and back carried several local dignitaries, including Mayor Henry Baigent, councillors Charles Harley, Frederick Fairey and William Akersten, and several members of the public. Town Clerk Harry Gully was on hand to ensure that the fares collected made it into the city coffers. The council voted on 7 June 1901 to lift the rails, with work commencing on 26 June and being completed by 6 July. The sleepers were sold, though many of the rails were retained by the council for its own use. The trams were sold at auction on 14 December 1901 to Joseph Taylor, acting on behalf of the Puponga Coal and Gold Mining Company.  Stations  Scene at Dun Mountain, 1862 The company did not have stations on the incline section: it established four depots that it called \\"houses\\". The first, at the start of the incline section, included stores, workshops for the carpenters and blacksmiths, stables for up to ten horses, a four-room house and a two-room cottage. The next most important depot was Third House, on the Wairoa Saddle, approximately halfway along the incline section. Second and Fourth Houses included small buildings for maintenance work and shelter for the staff. While waiting for the delivery of the tram, the company communicated with the Board of Works in January 1862 to arrange for the installation of suitable passenger stations, as required under the act. The Board initially deferred a response, pending a decision on suitable sites. Later that month the company again wrote to the Board to suggest that four stations be established, at Alton Street; outside the Masonic Hotel; adjacent to the City Market Hall, on the Fish Market Reserve; and at the Government Wharf at the port. The company suggested that further stations would be required when the it exercised its right to extend the line into Trafalgar Street and Bridge Street. Only a week later it changed its stance and suggested that only stations at the port and outside the Masonic Hotel would be required. On 30 January the Board agreed with this suggestion, but attached the stipulation that the latter station should only be a temporary stopping place, that the footpath was not to be obstructed, and that no buildings were to be erected on the roadway.  Today  No trace remains of the City Bus operation in Nelson itself, though one may still walk the incline section of the Dun Mountain Railway from Brook Street. Some parts of the City Bus route are almost unrecognisable today from the days of its operation, largely due to significant reclamation works in the Nelson Haven along Hardy Street.

He captained Worcestershire between 1952 and 1954, though he had acted as such on many occasions during the previous two seasons when official captain Bob Wyatt was unavailable. He usually batted at number four, Obituary. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 1986 while his fast-medium bowling was of the occasional variety: he never took a season's tally of wickets into double figures. Although Bird was on the groundstaff at Warwickshire as early as 1934, he never played for that county, and the intervention of the Second World War meant that he was 31 before he made his first-class debut. This was for Worcestershire against the touring Indians at Worcester in early May 1946. Bird's contribution to a narrow Worcestershire win was minimal: he scored 0 and 3, did not bowl, and held a single catch to dismiss Lala Amarnath. Bird quickly established himself in the first team, and was capped that year, playing 24 times in all and ending the year with 801 runs at 20.53 including three half-centuries. Although he was only available for half Worcestershire's games in 1947, he nevertheless made his first century ‚Äì 105 against Sussex in June ‚Äì and passed fifty twice more. The following month he took his first wicket, against the same opponents, when he caught and bowled John Langridge. He played only twice at first-class level in 1948, although he did turn out a few times for the Second XI in the Minor Counties Championship. In one of his two first-team matches, he took a career- best 3‚Äì26 against Northamptonshire in June. Bird returned for a full season the following summer, and passed a thousand runs for the first of three times, hitting 1,016 at 26.73 with one hundred ‚Äì an innings of 116 which \\"had much to do\\" with a good win over Yorkshire ‚Äî and five fifties. 1950 was rather a lean year for Bird, as in 38 innings his highest score was 68, but things improved in 1951, when he scored 129 against Essex and made seven further fifties. Appointed club captain for the 1952 season, he enjoyed the best summer of his career, scoring 1,591 first-class runs at exactly 37, and scoring three hundreds and eight fifties. The centuries included the highest of his career, an unbeaten 158 to help set up a two-day innings defeat of Somerset at Taunton in June. The 1953 season was also quite successful for Bird, as he made 1,238 first-class runs at 26.91, with one hundred and five half-centuries. In late May of that year, he made his debut for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's, captaining the side for the only time and opening the batting; he scored 68 and 40 in a losing cause against Hampshire. However, in 1954 he appeared only 20 times and made only 629 runs with three fifties, at an average of under 22. A defeat at Derby in mid-August, in which he scored 10 and 20 and took the wicket of John Kelly, marked the end of Bird's county cricket career. All of his four remaining first-class matches were for MCC: two at Lord's (against Gloucestershire in June 1955 and against Cambridge University a year later) and two at Dublin in September 1956 and September 1958, both against Ireland. Bird's only significant contribution in any of these games was the 52 he hit in the first innings against Gloucestershire. He appeared a couple of times for the Second XI in 1959, then after leaving cricket represented Worcestershire at both squash and tennis.

Plot John Radley's childhood was not a particularly nice one; his father's abandonment, an abusive mother, bullied by neighborhood kids and his pets had a tendency to die on him. Only his first crush Gretchen ever treated him with kindness. But this all ended when he was goaded into performing a balancing act, whereupon a malicious prank backfired and Johnny ended up plunging down a dried up well to greet a rock floor. Since then he has been in Oakhurst State mental hospital for over a decade. Left semi- comatose, he has only his now-distorted memories and nightmarish flashbacks for comfort. One night the continual flood of harsh images is too much for his psyche, and he comes to find himself badly disfigured and severely brain damaged, so much so that he can no longer feel any pain. Who will care for, let alone love, Johnny now? No one, he knows (in what's left of his damaged mind). He suffers a complete psychotic break, and after venting his fury on a nurse, turns his rage towards those responsible for his condition. Bursting out of his temporary accommodation, he storms off into the night, dead set on disposing of his old childhood tormentors, whose body parts he intends to offer up to the only person in his life who ever gave a damn about him‚Äîa certain girl by the name of Gretchen.

His paintings can be found in the permanent collections of many museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the National Museum of American Art, the Smithsonian Institution, the White House, Gracie Mansion in New York, the Senate Office Building, and the Museum of the City of New York. Willows and Sky  Youth  Stokely Webster was born in Evanston, Illinois. His parents were the noted author Henry Kitchell Webster and Mary Ward Orth. As a child, he spent his summers at Bee Tree Farm, the family retreat built by his grandfather, industrialist Towner K. Webster. He credited his time at that ‚Äúmagical place‚Äù with shaping his world view and future painting. One of his earliest works, ‚ÄúWillows and Sky,‚Äù was painted at the Farm when he was 17 years old. As a youth, he traveled with his family to Paris, France where he was enthralled by the paintings of the French impressionists and post-impressionists and embarked on his own fledgling efforts at plein-air cityscapes. In 1922 he spent a year in France where he saw Monet at work in his Giverny garden and viewed his paintings at the Luxembourg Palace. He decided at that time to be a painter. His first studies were with family friend Lawton S. Parker, an American artist who had studied with Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me and James McNeill Whistler. He taught young Webster the century-old traditions of painting, generally accepted up until World War II.‚ÄúStokely Webster and His Paris,‚Äù published 2001 After returning to America in 1924, he dedicated the next ten years to educating himself through a succession of art-school courses, studying architecture at Yale University and spending two years in Chicago, Illinois working as a textile designer. Webster was a student at Columbia University, National Academy of Design, and the Yale School of Fine Arts.  Maturity  In 1933, he married renowned ballerina and satirical dancer Iva Kitchell.University of Central Florida, Special Collections and University Archives In 1936 he studied for six months with Robert Henri's disciple Wayman Adams, learning portrait painting and landscape technique, which combined the high-valued colors of impressionism with the methods of Henri and John Singer Sargent. A one-man exhibition, which opened in New York the same year he completed the painting, Times Square, drew praise from The New York Sun, \\"Mr. Webster paints in the way that at one time was thought the only way to paint, using the flowing strokes and well-thinned-out pigments that came to us through Sargent via Frans Hals and Velasquez.\\" A reviewer for the New York Herald Tribune endorsed that opinion, comparing Webster's technical skills to those of Sargent, while others praised his expertise at capturing the momentary impression of a place and his exceptionally convincing and precise use of light as the force defining its mood, climate, and urban disposition. Webster's joy at this reception, which buttressed his ambition to focus on painting full-time, was savored only briefly. The outbreak of World War II had soon shifted him to the assembly line at Grumman Aircraft Corporation, leading to his pursuit of an engineering degree at Columbia University and seven years of steady employment designing airplanes. He returned to painting in 1948, having sublet a spacious studio, formerly owned by George Luks, in Manhattan. A fire ravaged this building four years later, however, destroying more than sixty of his canvases and cheating Webster of his successful re-entry into the city's art world. The incident prompted him to relocate to Huntington, Long Island, where he became involved as a designer, and then president, of a gyroscope manufacturing company. Webster's creative inclinations eventually lured him back into active painting, and the decades of the 1960s and 1970s saw him creating both landscapes and figural studies and exhibiting that work internationally in an array of salons and galleries. During this time, Webster's paintings were acquired by, or donated to, museums in the United States. During the 1960s, he painted many portraits of his wife, Iva, as well as his daughter, Stephanie (dancer, who later married novelist Martin Brooks), and his granddaughter, Kathryn (novelist and photographer K. S. Brooks).NYT obituary Published: July 12, 2001\\"The View Through Her Lens\\", The Boston Sunday Globe, 1996-07-07 In 1983, Webster and his wife took up residence in Flagler Beach, Florida after many years as Long Island, New York residents. Mrs. Webster died later that year. He remarried in May 1984 to long-time friend Audrey Coutant and relocated to Southport, Connecticut. His commitment to painting lyrical seascapes and city scenes in an impressionist manner continued unabated, and museum exhibitions featuring recent work by the artist were still being organized into the mid-1990s. Webster traveled to Boston in May 1993 to attend the National Invitational exhibit State of the Art ‚Äô93, sponsored by the New England Fine Arts Institute, as both he, and his granddaughter, K.S. Brooks, were exhibiting works at the same show.WCVB-TV News 1993 Two books were published about Stokely Webster during his life: Stokely Webster Paintings, 1923-1984, published in 1985 by the Museum of Arts and Sciences, Daytona Beach, Florida; and Stokely Webster and his Paris‚Ä¶New York, London and Venice published in 2001 by Connecticut River Press.

History Iglesia San Carlos de Chonchi Traditional architecture in Chonchi General view of Chonchi Church in Vilupulli Fuerte Tauco, a fortress dating from 1780 Originally Chonchi was a Jesuit mission station with a school which had 150 pupils in 1755, and the town itself was founded in 1767 by order of Don Guil y Gonzaga, the Governor of Chilo√©.Juan Mancilla P√©rez. Pueblos de Chilo√©, p. 56. Castro 2008 In 1787 Chonchi had 315 inhabitants. Unification with Chile increased the economic importance of the region and promoted population growth. The 1833 census in Chonchi demonstrated that it was the most important town in south of the island. It became a parish in 1836, resuming its traditional religious significance within the area. A good anchorage made Chonchi a natural stopping place for traffic in the canals and timber exploitation transformed it into a hub for development of the region. The economic activity centred upon Chonchi reached its zenith at the beginning of the 20th century creating an opulent society with an active social circle. The influence of external ideas (Europeans) is clearly apparent in the town.Chonchi history The pirate Pedro √ëanc√∫pel was a native of Chonchi, being born in Terao 1837.

(ACC) is a Libyan company involved in production of cement, lime, gypsum and paper bags for cement packaging, and other construction related operations. It has a total production capacity of roughly 3.340 million tons per year (t/yr) and currently operates seven plants throughout Libya. The company's investment volume was estimated at Ld 180 million. Background Nationally, the cement sector in Libya is not a major economic actor. Nevertheless, on a sectoral level, the impact of the production of cement on the natural and social environment in Libya is important. ACC was formed as a state-owned company in 1988, resulting from a merger between the National Cement & Building Materials Establishment and the Souk El Khamis General Cement & Building Materials Corporation. Since then, cement manufacture in Libya has been the sole domain of two parastatals; the ACC and the Libyan Cement Co. In 1998, ACC operated four plants: El Mergeb with a 330,000-t/yr capacity, and Souk, El Khamis, and Lebda each with a 1-M/yr capacity. Production from the two companies satisfied most domestic demand, and minimal surplus was available for export; on average, capacity utilization was 50%.P. Mobbs (1998) In 2001, the Libyan Government proposed a number of state company projects for which joint ventures would be considered. These included an expansion of ACC's cement plants in Libda and Zliten, valued at $242 million and $169 million respectively.P. Mobbs 2001 p. 19.1 In February 2005, the initial public offering of shares in the formerly state- owned ACC resulted in the sale of 60% of the company for $273 million.

It is sometimes called the \\"Akropolis des P√©rigord\\". Geography Aerial view of Domme Domme is above sea level on a rocky outcrop overlooking the Dordogne river. With its trapezoid city plan, Domme is a bastide (a fortified medieval town) adapted to the surrounding terrain, and thus falling short of the rectangular city plan characteristic to bastides. Today a member of the association Les Plus Beaux Villages de France (\\"The Most Beautiful Villages of France\\"), Domme has two public spaces of medieval origin: the commercial Place de la Halle (\\"Market Hall Square\\") and the Place de La Rode, where the breaking wheel entertained the public. There were two other notable locations in the village: the fair and the moneyer's house. This section was a free translation of the French article as of June 5 2011 History Templar graffiti on a prison wall Founded as a stronghold in 1281 by Philip the Bold following his campaign along the Dordogne river, Domme obtained the privilege of minting its own currency. In 1307, the Knight Templars were imprisoned in Domme during the trial against them, of which hundreds of Templar graffiti still bear witness. They used a code system involving series of geometric figures: the octagon represented the Grail, the triangle surmounted by a cross represented Golgatha, the square represented the Temple, and the circle represented the imprisonment. Similar inscriptions (of disputed authenticity) has been found in other towns such as Loches, Gisors, and Chinon. During the Hundred Years' War, the bastide was coveted by the English who first took the town in 1347 and repeatedly changed rulers throughout the war until 1437 when it finally fell under French rule again. The Wars of Religion brought new turmoil. Protestants took the city in 1588 by climbing the cliffs at night to open the gates. A short success, as the Protestant captain had to hand the bastide in which he was entrenched back to the Catholics in 1592. The city then witnessed popular revolts (Jacquerie des Croquants) in 1594 and 1637. Domme prospered during the seventeenth century only to decline thereafter, which greatly facilitated its preservation in modern time. PopulationPoints of interest Domme is famous for its fortifications, which were completed by 1310. The Porte des Tours with the main entrance loads to two drum-shaped towers of stone on the east and west part of the wall. The walls, first completed in 1310, contain two more gates.

The state highway runs from MD 64 in Smithsburg east to MD 194 in Keymar. MD 77 is the main east-west highway of northern Frederick County. The state highway connects Thurmont with eastern Washington County via Foxville, which lies between South Mountain and Catoctin Mountain near Catoctin Mountain Park and Cunningham Falls State Park. MD 77 links Thurmont with western Carroll County through the communities of Graceham, Rocky Ridge, and Detour in the Monocacy River valley. MD 77 was constructed from Thurmont east to Detour in the 1920s and early 1930s. A disjoint section of MD 77 was built between Cavetown and Foxville in the late 1930s. The portions of the modern highway between Foxville and Thurmont and from Detour to Keymar were county highways until they were designated part of MD 77 in 1956. MD 77's western terminus was moved east to MD 64 in Smithsburg in 1960.

The state highway passes Pleasant Valley Road before it reaches its highest point at the Washington-Frederick County line. East of Foxville, MD 77 begins to follows the boundary between Cunningham Falls State Park to the south and the National Park Service-managed Catoctin Mountain Park to the north. Catoctin Mountain Park contains three historic camps: Camp Greentop, Camp Misty Mount, and the Presidential retreat Camp David. MD 77 follows a curvaceous route along the narrow valley of Hunting Creek to descend Catoctin Mountain. The state highway emerges from the mountain valley just west of the town of Thurmont, where the highway becomes Main Street and meets U.S. Route 15 (Catoctin Mountain Highway) at a folded diamond interchange. MD 77 intersects Church Street and Water Street in the center of town; Church Street heads north as MD 550. The two state highways run concurrently through the eastern part of Thurmont until MD 550 heads south as Jimtown Road and MD 77 continues east as Rocky Ridge Road. MD 77 leaves the town of Thurmont and passes through the village of Graceham, where the highway passes Graceham Moravian Church and Parsonage and has a one-lane underpass of the Maryland Midland Railway. The state highway passes through farmland and traverses Owens Creek just west of Old Frederick Road, which crosses the creek to the south on the Loys Station Covered Bridge. Another historic bridge across Owens Creek, the Old Mill Road Bridge, is accessed by Old Mill Road just east of Loyds Station. MD 77 passes under the railroad again just west of Rocky Ridge, where the highway meets the southern end of MD 76 (Motters Station Road). The state highway crosses the Monocacy River on a through truss bridge at Millers Bridge just south of the confluence of the Monocacy River and Double Pipe Creek. A short distance to the east, MD 77 crosses Double Pipe Creek and enters Carroll County at the village of Detour, which is located just north of the confluence of Big Pipe Creek and Little Pipe Creek to form Double Pipe Creek. The state highway continues east as Middleburg Road, which intersects the Maryland Midland Railway at grade and crosses Big Pipe Creek before reaching its eastern terminus at MD 194 (Francis Scott Key Memorial Highway) in the village of Keymar, which sits at the junction of the Maryland Midland Railway's east-west and north-south rail lines. Middleburg Road continues east as a county highway that passes through Middleburg and Uniontown before continuing as Uniontown Road toward Westminster. History View west along MD 77 west of MD 76 in Rocky Ridge The first section of what was to become MD 77 was paved in concrete from the railroad crossing at Graceham east to Old Frederick Road near Loys Station by 1923. This section of improved road was extended east with concrete to Rocky Ridge starting in 1924 and completed by 1927. MD 77 was also extended west to the eastern edge of Thurmont as a macadam road by 1927. The concrete highway was extended east from Rocky Ridge in 1928 and to the Monocacy River in 1930. MD 77 was extended east to the Frederick-Carroll county line at Double Pipe Creek just west of Detour starting in 1930. The state highway's truss bridge over the Monocacy River was built in 1932, replacing an old truss bridge of the same design as one that had catastrophically failed on US 240's (now MD 355) crossing of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad in 1930. MD 77 was connected to US 15 in Thurmont by municipally-maintained Main Street and from Detour to MD 71 (now MD 194) in Keymar by a county connecting road. The first portion of the western half of MD 77 was built between 1936 and 1938 from Cavetown to Foxville. The westernmost part of MD 77 included Cavetown Church Road from MD 64 (now MD 66) in Cavetown to just east of Wolfsville Road. The two sections of MD 77 were connected by county-maintained Foxville Road from Foxville to Thurmont. Foxville Road between Foxville and Thurmont and Middleburg Road from Double Pipe Creek east to MD 194 became part of MD 77 in 1956. MD 77 was widened through Thurmont that same year. In 1956, construction began on MD 77's interchange with the US 15 bypass, which opened in 1958. The US 15 interchange originally consisted of one two-way ramp in the northeast quadrant of the junction between MD 77 and the two-lane bypass. When US 15 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway in 1985, the southbound US 15 ramps in the southwest quadrant of the junction were constructed. MD 77's western terminus was moved from Cavetown to the Smithsburg Bypass when MD 64 was moved to the new highway in 1960. The old alignment of MD 77 west to Cavetown consists of Cavetown Church Road, which is unsigned MD 844 between MD 64 and a dead end adjacent to modern MD 77 east of Wolfsville Road.

Pearce (born June 23, 1947) is a conservative American politician and Republican former member of the Arizona State Senate. He rose to national prominence as the primary sponsor of Arizona SB1070, a controversial anti- illegal immigrant measure that was signed into law in 2010. He was elected President of the Arizona Senate when the Senate began its January 2011 term, but then suffered a dramatic reversal of fortune when he was ousted in a November 2011 recall election, the first legislator in Arizona history to be so removed from office. He served as Vice-Chair of the Arizona GOP, but in September 2014, he resigned the position after controversy over a eugenicist comment about forced sterilization of poor women on Medicaid. Prior to his election to the Arizona Senate in 2008, Pearce served in the Arizona House of Representatives from 2001 to 2009, and worked in law enforcement for more than twenty years.  Education  *BA in Management at the University of Phoenix *John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University *Motor Vehicle Legal and Law College, University of Colorado *Advanced Executive Development, Arizona State University *Budget and Appropriations, University of Arizona *Arizona Judicial College, Supreme Court of Arizona  History  A fifth- generation Arizonan, Pearce was born on June 23, 1947, to Hal Frost Pearce and Norma Crandell. He grew up in a troubled and impoverished home with an alcoholic father; he recalled in past interviews that when he came home from school, he sometimes found that neighbors had left groceries for the family, but his mother would always put the food to the side, not wishing to accept charity. Pearce served with the National Guard in Arizona during the Vietnam War. Sheriff Pearce wanted to attend medical school, but his family was unable to afford it, which led him to join the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office where he served as a sheriff's deputy for twenty-three years, including a stint as Chief Deputy Sheriff under Joe Arpaio. After an incident where he continued to pursue several gang members after being shot in the chest, he received a Medal of Valor from the Department. Pearce's son, Sean Pearce, has also been awarded the Medal of Valor for being shot in the line of duty while serving a homicide warrant. Pearce claims credit for one of Arpaio's more publicized and controversial actions, that of housing jail inmates in tents. Following disagreements with Arpaio, Pearce moved to the Arizona Motor Vehicle Division. In 1995, Pearce became the Director of the Arizona Motor Vehicle Division. Two notable changes during his tenure were: 1) bringing in IBM to create the first version of servicearizona.com, an online resource for Arizonans to update their Motor Vehicle Department information and 2) more controversially, Pearce enrolled Arizona in the then optional (at the federal level) National Drivers Registry program, making collection of social security numbers for drivers' licenses mandatory at the state level to comply with the (then optional) federal program. This caused a controversy at the time because he caused SSNs to be displayed on the face of the driver's license, causing the state legislature to have to later take up legislation to obfuscate the SSN, replacing it with a \\"D\\"# which is seen today. However, the SSN is still collected at the time of application or via SSOLV, and remains on the Arizona drivers license file. Pearce oversaw the implementation of a law requiring that applicants for drivers licenses provide either a birth certificate proving they are United States citizens, or documents proving they are in the United States legally. Pearce was discharged from the position of Director of the Arizona Motor Vehicle Division in August 1999 by Arizona Department of Transportation Director Mary Peters, after an investigation revealed that two of Pearce's subordinates had tampered with a Tucson woman's driving record.Don't count out Pearce, Arizona's political Rasputin Pearce later said he was cleared of wrongdoing, but Peters told the Arizona Republic: \\"There's a big difference between being cleared and choosing not to file criminal charges\\".Daily Kos: Senator Pearce: Please Go on Rachel MaddowRussell Pearce's Problem with the Rule of Law; and Andrei Cherny Contends for Democratic Party Chair - Page 2 - News - Phoenix - Phoenix New Times He was elected to the Arizona House in 2000, representing a district in the Mesa area. He transferred to the state senate in 2006. During his tenure, Pearce authored legislation creating the Arizona Auto Theft Authority and served as its chairman. The Arizona Auto Theft Authority has been credited with a 60% decrease in statewide car thefts since its inception in 1992. Republican anti- tax activist Grover Norquist's group, Americans for Tax Reform, named Pearce a \\"Hero of the Taxpayers\\" for 2003.  Immigration policies  In 2004, Pearce supported Arizona's Proposition 200, which requires individuals to produce proof of citizenship before they may register to vote or apply for public benefits in Arizona. Prop 200 was approved by voters as a ballot initiative in 2004. Proof of citizenship includes an Arizona drivers license issued on or after October 1, 1996, the date from which AZ DLs were required to contain SSNs on the DL data file. Pearce was the lead sponsor of Arizona SB1070, drafted by Kansas anti-immigrant politician Kris Kobach which passed into law in April 2010 as the Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act. The measure attracted national attention as the broadest and strictest anti- illegal immigration measure in decades within the United States. After the Obama administration challenged the law, resulting in a federal court ruling that most of the law was unconstitutional, Pearce told a gathering of conservative activists, \\"When you talk about jihad, that is exactly what Obama has against America, specifically the state of Arizona.\\" In a 2008 story on National Public Radio NPR, he was quoted as saying, \\"I believe in the rule of law ... I've always believed in the rule of law. We're a nation of laws.\\"; and \\"I will not back off until we solve the problem of this illegal invasion. Invaders, that's what they are. Invaders on the American sovereignty and it can't be tolerated.\\" In reaction to the federal government's seeking of an injunction against enforcement of the law on constitutional grounds: \\"It's outrageous and it's clear they don't want (immigration) laws enforced. What they want is to continue their non-enforcement policy,\\" Pearce said. \\"They ignore the damage to America, the cost to our citizens, the deaths\\" tied to border-related violence. He also sponsored Arizona SB1097, also debated in the legislature during the 2010 term, which sought to quantify the impact of illegal immigration on the state's K-12 education system. The text of the bill states that: * School districts would be required to identify and count all students who are in the U.S. illegally. * The state's Department of Education would be required to report annually on the impact and costs to state taxpayers of the enrollment of these students. * The state Superintendent of Public Instruction would be authorized to withhold state aid from districts that do not comply with the law. CNN announced on June 15, 2010, that Senator Pearce is proposing a measure that would deny U.S. citizenship to children born in this country to illegal immigrants in an effort to thwart so-called \\"anchor babies\\". The vast majority of legal scholars have stated that such a measure would be unconstitutional as the 14th Amendment guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the United States.\\"Arizona bill would deny citizenship to children of illegal immigrants.\\" CNN. N.p., n.d. Web. June 16, 2010. The endorsement of the Utah Compact by Pearce's church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), resulted in accusations that Pearce opposed the social stance held by his own church on illegal immigration. Pearce addressed these accusations by reaffirming that he supports the principles in the Utah Compact such as the importance of the family and showing respect to immigrants. However he disagrees with what he considers to be a deceitful purpose of the Utah Compact being used as a political vehicle for pro-amnesty activists. He disagrees with the compact's failure to differentiate between legal and illegal immigration. The church's adoption of compassion-based approaches to immigration issues has sharply divided Mormons, with an increasing number being opposed to Pearce's immigration platform and desiring a solution more resembling the Compact. Another Pearce measure was the 2010 voter-approved law which denied bail to immigrants illegally in Arizona. In October 2014, an eleven-member panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the measure violates due process by imposing a punishment, denial of bail, before the holding of a trial. Pearce replied that he believes the Ninth Circuit decision overstepped federal authority and overrode the will of voters.\\"Court tosses out Arizona's no-bail law for immigrants\\", Laredo Morning Times, October 16, 2014, p. 11A  Controversies  Pearce faced criticism in 2006 after he called for the renewal of a 1950s immigration enforcement program, Operation Wetback, that deported or encouraged to self-deport 1.3 million illegal immigrants (and several hundred US citizens) in less than a year. Hispanic groups said the use of the word wetback was derogatory. In October 2006, Pearce included the text of an article by National Alliance, a white separatist group, in an email to a group of supporters. The article, titled \\"Who Rules America\\" contained allegations of Jewish control of the media and of multiculturalism being a Jewish anti- White conspiracy, as well as Holocaust denialism. He quickly apologized to supporters in an email, stating: \\"Ugly the words contained in it really are. They are not mine and I disavow them completely. Worse still, the website links to a group whose politics are the ugliest imaginable.\\" Pearce told reporters he did not agree with the antisemitic and racist statements in the article, and that he had copied it from an email forwarded to him by someone else after \\"the title and the first paragraphs about media bias appealed to him\\". Pearce was also criticized for his association with the homicidal white supremacist J. T. Ready. Pearce endorsed Ready for Mesa City Council in 2006 and appeared with him at several rallies. In 2004 Pearce was photographed attending Ready's baptism into the LDS Church. In addition, church documents revealed that Pearce ordained Ready into the LDS priesthood in 2004. Pearce has since claimed he was unaware of Ready's neo-Nazi affiliations at the time he made the endorsement, In April 2008, Pearce sponsored a measure, Senate Bill 1108, that would bar Arizonan public schools from teachings that \\"denigrate[s] American values and the teachings of Western civilization\\", and prohibit the formation of groups \\"based in whole or part on the race of their membership\\". Pearce said he didn't want students indoctrinated with anti- American ideologies. The Arizona Republic noted the measure could ban groups such as the Black Business Students Association at Arizona State University or Native Americans United at Northern Arizona University. Critics of the bill called it vague and predicted its implementation would have chilling effects. As lead sponsor of Arizona SB 1070, Pearce received assistance from the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) in drafting the text for the legislation. In December 2007, FAIR was identified as a \\"hate group\\" by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). In the early 1990s Founded by eugenicist John Tanton FAIR received funding from the Pioneer Fund, a eugenics society established in 1937 \\"to advance the scientific study of heredity and human differences\\" that the SPLC has described as a neo-Nazi organization. In October 2010, the SB 1070 bill, which Pearce sponsored in the legislature, came under criticism for benefiting the for-profit prison industry. Most of the language of the bill had been written as model legislation at a December 2009 meeting of the Koch-sponsored American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), where Pearce was joined as an attendee by officials of the company Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), later renamed CoreCivic. CCA \\"executives believe immigrant detention is their next big market\\" according to NPR. In November 2010, Pearce launched a push to reject US$7 billion in federal funding for Arizona's Medicaid program, which serves more than one million people. When asked what those who rely upon this program for health care would do if it no longer has the funds to operate, Pearce said \\"they'll probably be okay.\\"  2011 recall election  On May 31, 2011, Citizens for a Better Arizona turned in 18,315 signatures to the Arizona Secretary of State's Office to recall Pearce from office. On July 8, the Arizona Secretary of State's Office officially verified that the recall petitions had sufficient signatures. On July 12, Arizona Governor Jan Brewer (R) issued an order calling a special recall election in November.Governor Jan Brewer Issues Order for November 8 Russell Pearce Recall Election (w/UPDATE) - Phoenix News - Feathered Bastard Pearce was the first state lawmaker in Arizona history to be recalled.Russell Pearce recall: Enough signatures to force election Mesa, Arizona, Republican Jerry Lewis announced he would run against Senator Pearce. Independent Tommy Cattey also filed to become a candidate in the recall election. A significant factor in Pearce's recall were that his views on immigration and other matters are an embarrassment to the LDS Church, of which Pearce is a member, which led Jerry Lewis, another member of the church, to seek to replace him. Straw Candidate Pearce's supporters recruited Republican Olivia Cortes to run in the recall election in order to split the anti-Pearce Republican vote. As of October 2011, several members of Pearce's campaign effort had been accused of Class 5 felonies for their role in aiding and funding the sham candidacy.Russell Pearce's Cortes Scandal: Tom Ryan Challenges the Media, Lester Pearce Flips Out - Phoenix News - Feathered Bastard Independent Cortes later dropped out of the race.huffingtonpost.com  Dec 06, 2017  Tea Party Scandal Explodes in Arizona Recall Election  Jeff Biggers  On November 7, 2011, the night before his recall election, Mesa voters were flooded with robocalls from Pearce's supporters, informing them that both Pearce and his challenger Jerry Lewis were Republicans.Robocalls target Pearce recall election voters, KPHO-TV. Retrieved July 28, 2018. The call then encouraged voters to protest this one-sided election by writing in their own candidate. Since the winner of an Arizona recall election is the candidate who receives a plurality of the votes cast, and the candidate whose recall is sought is also on the ballot, the effect of casting such a write-in vote is to decrease the chance that a single challenger will receive more votes than the candidate whose recall is sought. On November 8, 2011, Pearce was defeated in the recall election by Lewis.Russell Pearce ousted in historic recall election, KPHO-TV. Retrieved July 28, 2019. Lewis said, \\"We now have an opportunity to heal the divide in Mesa.\\" Pearce replied, \\"If being recalled is the price for keeping one's promises, then so be it.\\"  2012 Senate primary defeat  On August 28, 2012, Pearce lost his comeback bid in the Republican primary for the nomination for a state senate seat to businessman Bob Worsley, by 56 to 44 percent.  2014 Party Resignation  In September 2014, Pearce made eugenicist comments on his KKNT radio show, stating that poor, unemployed women on Medicaid should receive forced sterilization, as well as other comments which were widely criticized in the media and by fellow GOP politicians. As a result of the controversy, he resigned his position as Vice- Chair of the Arizona GOP.  Personal life  Pearce lives in Mesa, Arizona with his wife, LuAnne and his three adopted grandchildren: Wyatt, Ethan, and Tatum Pearce. He has five children: Dodi, Sean, Colten, Justin, and Joshua. Pearce has worked in the Maricopa County Treasurer's Office since 2014. In 1980, Mrs. Pearce filed a petition for dissolution of marriage which alleged that he \\"is possessed of a violent temper, and has from time to time hit and shoved the wife, when he grabbed the wife by the throat and threw her down.\\" LuAnne was later reconciled with her husband. When asked many years later about the allegations, she acknowledged the 1980 petition but, despite having signed the document under oath, categorically denied ever having been struck, grabbed by the throat, thrown down, or threatened by her husband, adding that she did not know how the allegations came to be part of the court document signed by her under oath. Her husband likewise denied the allegations. Pearce's son Justin resigned from the Arizona Motor Vehicles Division in 1999, after he produced counterfeit driver's licenses for himself and four friends with false ages in an effort to avoid alcohol prohibition laws. Justin Pearce subsequently pleaded guilty to tampering with a public record and received a suspended sentence. In February 2011, Mesa police arrested Pearce's son, Joshua Trent Pearce, on two outstanding arrest warrants tied to a probation violation and failing to appear in court. Pearce's nephew Talmage attended the 2016 Republican Convention as an anti-Trump delegate from Arizona's 5th District.

It is housed in the Lower Manhattan Security Coordination Center (LMSCC) located at 55 Broadway. The LMSI covers a 1.7-mile area from Canal Street to Battery Park, including the New York Stock Exchange, World Financial Center, former World Trade Center site, and numerous financial institutions. History When the New York City Police Department launched the initiative in 2008, it aimed to install over 3,000 new security cameras in Lower Manhattan, as well as 100 automatic number plate recognition devices which are intended to scan plates and compare the numbers with information in a database. According to police spokesman Paul J. Browne, the footage from the cameras would be monitored from a center staffed by police officers and private employees. The activities the cameras are programmed to pick up on include the delivery of packages. For privately owned cameras, Scientific American reported in 2011 that the NYPD depends on private CCTV camera operators to manually control their cameras to point at significant elements in their environment, and the NYPD would cut into those dynamic feeds as needed.Other features of the system include mobile roadblocks, which could swivel into the streets and block traffic, and radiation detectors. An NYPD mobile traffic barrier Upon its initial proposal in 2007, the estimated cost of the LMSI was around $US 90 million (excluding the cost of radiation detectors), with the Department of Homeland Security paying for 10 million of this, and the city government covering 15 million. In 2009 an extension to Midtown was announced, supported with $24 million from DHS. As of 2010, the Midtown Manhattan Security Initiative (MMSI) used 689 surveillance cameras between 30th and 60th Streets. As of 2010, the LMSI and MMSI combined used 1,159 cameras. The program was further extended in cooperation with Microsoft and is fully active as of 2012. It is known as the Domain Awareness System. As of August 2014, the LMSCC uses feeds from 6,500 cameras owned by NYPD and private stakeholders, and reads approximately 2 million license plates per day. Whereas most cities' cameras aren't networked and require an individual to retrieve the footage, NYPD's cameras are viewed in real time by officers located at the LMSCC. Criticism The plan has been compared to the ring of steel around the City of London, the financial district at the center of Greater London. The City of London had 649 City-government-operated cameras in 2011 (often incorrectly quoted at 500,000 cameras). In October 2007, the New York Civil Liberties Union served the NYPD with a FOIL request for all documents related to the planned surveillance system. After multiple requests, the NYPD responded with only 91 pages of documents, prompting the NYCLU to sue the NYPD in State Supreme Court in September 2008. The Gothamist reporter Jake Dobkin expressed concern over the IT security of the LMSI in a critical editorial, noting that the wifi password for the facility was \\"P@ssword1\\".

It acquired certain celebrity because the famous Chilean writer Francisco Coloane was born nearby the town. The town is served by Quemchi Airport. History At the end of 1860, Quemchi was set in native forest and the inhabitants lived mainly on shellfish. The population was a mixture of Chileans and Europeans. In 1870 the first barkentine to anchor in the bay brought the English businessman Edwin H. Landon. Impressed by the beauty of the area and its potential commercial possibilities, he settled on a big block of land purchased from Juan Pablo Tocol. Here he built a house and later the first sawmill in Choen, as well as a store to supply his workers and villagers with provisions. He introduced exotic timbers from North America, Europe and Australia. Thus emerged a port visited by ships of many different nations. As this harbour was not very secure, it was moved to the more protected waters of Quemchi. This became quite an important place, where many people established themselves, amongst them Vicente Lobos Toledo from Valpara√≠so. Compa√±√≠a Explotadora de Maderas Valpara√≠so was formed in Quemchi in 1885, and later became the \\"Sociedad Nacional de Bosques y Maderas\\", with affiliated companies in Quemchi, Calbuco and Maull√≠n, and with an agent in Ancud. In 1881 Luis Martiniano was appointed Governor of Chilo√©. He signed the declaration recognising Quemchi and its environs as an administrative area of the republic. 20th century Compa√±√≠a de Electricidad was formed in Quemchi in 1925 by Don Vicente Lobos T. and Don Antonio Scholbach and supplied the port with electric power. The timber company Pi-Castolpi was founded in 1940 when the Spaniard don Antonio Campani, bought a thousand hectares of virgin forest in the Ancud area. With employment a strong community emerged. Port of Quemchi Demographics According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Quemchi spans an area of and has 8,689 inhabitants (4,525 men and 4,164 women). Of these, 1,665 (19.2%) lived in urban areas and 7,024 (80.8%) in rural areas. The population grew by 6.1% (501 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses. Administration As a commune, Quemchi is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2008-2012 alcalde is Luis Mac√≠as Demarchi (ILC). Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Quemchi is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Gabriel Ascencio (PDC) and Alejandro Santana (RN) as part of the 58th electoral district, (together with Castro, Ancud, Dalcahue, Curaco de V√©lez, Quinchao, Puqueld√≥n, Chonchi, Queil√©n, Quell√≥n, Chait√©n, Hualaihu√©, Futaleuf√∫ and Palena). The commune is represented in the Senate by Camilo Escalona Medina (PS) and Carlos Kuschel Silva (RN) as part of the 17th senatorial constituency (Los Lagos Region).

History=World War II Established in 1939 as a prewar bombardment squadron, it was equipped with a mixture of Douglas B-18 Bolo medium and early-model Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bombers. It trained over the US east coast flying training missions. It also had some second-line Northrop A-17 Nomad dive bombers assigned. After the outbreak of World War II in Europe it flew patrols over the Atlantic Coast searching for German U-boat activity. Deployed to Borinquen Field, Puerto Rico in late 1940, the unit was assigned to the Caribbean Air Force, 25th Bombardment Group. The unit was called to face possible action, with its sister 1st Bombardment Squadron, in April and May 1942, however, when it patrolled the Vichy French Martinique area. By 1 November 1942, the squadron was transferred (minus personnel) to Edinburgh Field, Trinidad.Hagdedorn, In August 1943, the 10th Squadron, which had by then been consolidated with the personnel and equipment of the old 1st Bombardment Squadron re-equipped with the North American B-25 Mitchell. A detachment was also maintained at Port-of-Spain at this time. With the Navy taking over the antisubmarine mission, the squadron moved to France Field, Canal Zone in December 1943, where it became an element of the VI Bomber Command. The Squadron carried on patrols up and down the Atlantic coast of Panama and into neighboring Colombian waters until relieved from assignment to Sixth Air Force and returned to the United States. on 2 May 1944. It moved to Lincoln Army Air Field, Nebraska where it became a B-25 Mitchell medium bomber replacement training unit under Second Air Force. Inactivated June 1944. Reserve bombardment squadronStrategic Air Command The squadron was reactivated in 1955 as a Strategic Air Command (SAC) Boeing B-47 Stratojet squadron. It trained in air refueling and strategic bombardment operations with the B-47. In 1961, the squadron transferred its B-47s to other SAC wings and was inactivated. Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Squadron It was reactivated on 1 December 1961 as an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile squadron assigned to the 341st Missile Wing at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana. It was initially equipped with 50 LGM-30A Minuteman Is in early 1962, becoming SAC's first operational Minuteman squadron. It upgraded to the Minuteman IB in 1964 and the Minuteman IIF in 1967. It received control of LGM-30G Minuteman III silos from the inactivating 321st Strategic Missile Wing at Grand Forks Air Force Base, North Dakota in 1996; the Minuteman IIs being retired.

He was originally from Croatia. Early life Nobilo was born in present-day Croatia in 1913. His family's home village was Lumbarda, located on the island of Korƒçula. They had worked in the winemaking industry in Croatia for 300 years before Nobilo moved to New Zealand in the 1930s. Nobilo's uncle feared the signs of what would become World War II in Europe, and so ordered him to move to New Zealand. Nobilo worked as a stonemason before his emigration. Nobilo Wines Poverty Bay Chardonnay Nobilo - New Zealand Nobilo and his family arrived in New Zealand in 1937 and settled in Huapai, west of the city of Auckland. They began planting grapes in Huapai in 1943. Gradually the Nobilos led New Zealand's wine industry away from hybrid grapes to an emphasis on classic grape varieties which produce higher quality wines. Nobilo came to head the family company, which grew to become one of New Zealand's largest winemakers. In the 1995 New Year Honours, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to the viticulture industry. In 1998, the company, then called Nobilo Vintners, purchased another award-winning New Zealand winemaker, Selaks. The Nobilo family company was, in turn, acquired by BRL Hardy, one of Australia's largest winemakers, 2000. BRL Hardy merged Nobilo with its Constellation Brands wines in 2003. The new combined company, Constellation Wines, was able to distribute Nobilo wines throughout New Zealand, Australia, Europe and the Americas. Nobilo continued to produce wines after the acquisition. Nobilo Wines were named New Zealand's wine producer of the year in 2003. Nobilo's sauvignon blanc also won the award for best sauvignon blanc at the international wine and spirit competition in 2000. Death Nobilo died in Auckland, New Zealand, on 29 August 2007, at the age of 94. His funeral was held at the Holy Trinity Cathedral in Auckland. He was survived by his wife, Zuva, and three children.

Before Kemp left Arkansas, he discovered pulp fiction. As Kemp once wrote, \\"There were a number of magazines that struck my fancy for different reasons, among them were titles like Planet Stories, Weird Tales, Spicy Mystery Stories, etc. It was probably my emerging pubescence tilting me toward the spicy parts, but I had always been easy to tilt.\\"\\"Tales of Imagination and Space Travel: A Capricious Chronology\\" by Earl Kemp, Earl Kemp fanzine, December 2002.

To create the fanzine, \\"Earl sent the same five questions to 108 people, the elite of the science fiction world. And he printed the seventy-one responses he received.\\" The fanzine was distributed by the Spectator Amateur Press Society (SAPS), a long-running amateur press association. Kemp's win caused a bit of controversy because some felt that his publication had only a single issue; afterwards the award's eligibility rules for fanzines were changed to prevent single-issue publications from winning.\\"Notable fanzines of the 1960s\\" Chapter Five: publications and legendry; also Chapter Eight ‚Äì worldcons of the 1960s, both accessed Sept. 21, 2007 However, Who Killed Science Fiction was actually the first SaFari Annual, part of a series of fanzines Kemp was publishing for SAPS, and the \\"controversy\\" was largely based on misunderstanding.The complete text of Who Killed Science Fiction accessed Oct. 1, 2007.

It reprinted the entirety of the original 1961 edition and added considerable new material. In 2011 a book edition of Who Killed Science Fiction was published by The Merry Blacksmith Press. Kemp also served as chairman of the 20th World Science Fiction Convention. In 1961, he wrote a letter to Isaac Asimov in which he stated that \\"based on your delightful wit, and frankly your reputation\\" someone had jokingly suggested that Asimov deliver a pseudo-lecture at the convention. Kemp stated, \\"Specifically it should be delivered at the masquerade and should be something on the theme of THE POSITIVE POWER OF POSTERIOR PINCHING. They went on to say that we would, naturally furnish some suitable posteriors for demonstration purposes.\\" Asimov responded that, \\"I have no doubt I could give a stimulating talk that would stiffen the manly fiber of every one in the audience. However, I am not yet ready to give an unqualified acquiescence. It does occur to me, now and then, that there is some age at which I ought to gain a kind of minimal dignity suiting my [unintelligible] position in life. Besides the real reason is that I will have to ask the permission of various people who are (or would be) concerned in the matter. If they say 'no', it will be 'no.' Of course, I could be persuaded to do so on very short notice; even after the convention began, if the posteriors in question were of particularly compelling interest. Yours, Asimov.\\" The suggested pseudo-lecture did not occur. In 1963 Kemp edited The Proceedings: CHICON III, published by Advent:Publishers. The book included transcripts of lectures and panels given during the course of the convention, along with numerous photographs. Kemp edited a number of science fiction fanzines up until 1965, including Destiny and SaFari.

Her class of eight ships was armed by four obsolete Majestic-class pre- dreadnoughts which had their 12-inch guns and mounts removed, modified and installed in the newly built monitors. Wolfe spent her entire war service with the Dover Patrol, bombarding the German-occupied Belgian coastline, which had been heavily fortified. In the spring of 1918 she was fitted with an gun, with which she made the longest-range firing in the history of the Royal Navy - - on a target at Snaeskerke, Belgium. After the war, she was laid up before being stripped and put up for sale in 1920. She was finally scrapped in 1923. Background and construction The outbreak of the First World War and the rapid fall of Belgium into German hands meant that for the first time in decades the North Sea between the United Kingdom and Europe would not be wholly surrounded by friendly or neutral powers. In order to harass the Germans occupying the Belgian coast, and to prevent the use of ports by Imperial German Navy warships, vessels were needed which could traverse the shallow coastal waters and bombard the enemy. At this time aircraft were still relatively primitive and therefore orders were placed for shallow-draught vessels with long-range guns, the Abercrombie-class monitors. The speed with which the Abercrombie class of monitor had commenced construction, coupled with the prospect of large-scale shore bombardment presented by the entry of the Ottoman Empire into the First World War led to Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty and political head of the Royal Navy writing to First Sea Lord Jacky Fisher 11 December 1914; There were however no spare usable guns. Three 13.5-inch guns and mountings were free after the sinking of HMS Audacious, but there were no turrets available. Although 15-inch guns and turrets would later be re-allocated to monitors, at this time it was not thought to be a feasible option while the Queen Elizabeth class and Revenge- class battleships were being completed. It was then suggested that the guns and barbettes of the obsolete pre-dreadnought Majestic-class battleships be removed and placed in the monitors while the older ships were utilised as transports and hulks. Admiral Percy Scott, the foremost gunnery expert in the navy was consulted, who recommended that if the elevation of the guns was increased from their then limit of 13.5¬∞ to 30¬∞ then a comfortable range of could be reached. Five of the monitors were allocated to the firm of Harland and Wolff, to be constructed at their Belfast and Govan yards. Another, which became HMS Prince Rupert was built at William Hamilton & Company of Port Glasgow and another at Scotts' shipyard at Greenock. This left the monitor provisionally named M9. Initially the order for her went to Fairfield's on 23 December 1914. Due to a mass re-allocation of resources caused by the halting of capital ship construction, the construction of the former battleship, now the battlecruiser building at Fairfield was speeded up, while capacity at Palmer's in the North of England had been increased by the transfer of HMS Repulse to Clydebank. The order for M9 was therefore given to Palmer's Hebburn-on-Tyne yard on 6 January 1916 who also received the order for its two 4-cylinder triple-expansion engines. Before M9 was laid down at Hebburn, it was decided from which ship she would receive her main-armament. On 1 January 1915 it was decided that HMS Victorious would surrender one of her two 12-inch turrets, which was converted in situ by the Elswick Ordnance Company on Tyneside and then removed by crane - waiting dockside at Elswick until the monitor was launched and ready to have it fitted. The hull form was similar to the Abercrombie class, except that due to the lighter main armament the hull could be made slighter narrower and shorter, which meant that even with bulges she would be able to berth in most docks - a severe handicap for most monitors. M9, so named as it was the ninth monitor laid down for the Royal Navy, was originally intended to be named simply Wolfe after the victor of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, James Wolfe. On 15 February 1915 she was renamed Sir James Wolfe before receiving the name she would be launched under, General Wolfe, on 8 March. In common with all her sister-ships, which were named for famous British soldiers, the title was most often dropped leaving the name only, hence \\"Wolfe\\". Early career Wolfe was launched at Hebburn on 9 September 1915, and commissioned for service on 9 November under Commander Neston William Diggle, who had been appointed to her on 27 October. She was the last of her class to complete, and arrived at Dover for service with The Dover Patrol on 12 November. Her sister-ships had already performed a number of shore bombardments, and Wolfe had to wait until 25 January 1916, when Marshal Foch of the French Army requested a demonstration of the monitors. Wolfe went to sea under Captain John Alfred Moreton, and flew the flag of Vice-Admiral Reginald Bacon, the patrol's commander-in-chief, who had served with Moreton in the submarine service. Anchored off the Belgian coast in the afternoon of the 26th, Wolfe and six other monitors bombarded the German artillery batteries at Westende, between Nieuport and Ostend, each of the larger monitors firing about eleven rounds with spotting (observation of the fall of shot) provided by aircraft. On 24 April 1916, Wolfe and her sister-ship Prince Eugene were detailed to cover the laying of a net barrage twelve miles off the Belgian coast, stretching twenty miles from Nieuport to Zeebrugge. Wolfe was spotted by the Tirpitz battery (four guns) and straddled at a range of . She steamed out of range, only to be ineffectively attacked by German aircraft, which Wolfe responded to with shrapnel shell. She then provided cover for British destroyers when the Germans attempted to press home a torpedo-boat attack. Afterwards, up until September when the weather turned wintry, Wolfe and the other 12-inch monitors patrolled the Belgian coast along with other monitors, destroyers and drifters to prevent the Germans breaking out or laying more mines, or sweeping up British minefields. By dint of their enormous beam and large guns, the 12-inch monitors were thought to be invulnerable to all warships but cruisers. During the build-up to the reopening of the Somme offensive on 15 September 1916, the Dover Patrol was asked to tie-down the enemy forces on the coast of Belgium. From 8 September to 15 September all the monitors of the patrol were engaged, and the 12-inch monitors, including Wolfe, fired two hundred of the three hundred heavy rounds fired in this period. They also acted as aiming marks for the larger 15-inch gunned monitors. For the next twelve months, weather permitting, the monitors continued the unglamorous task of patrolling. In July 1917, Wolfe with a number of her sister-ships was taken off patrolling in preparation for Operation Hush, a planned landing on the Belgian coast by the 1st Division. She and General Craufurd would have been tasked with towing one of three pontoons, each of which would have been capable of landing hundreds of men as well as tanks, guns and transport. The landing had been designed to coincide with Allied success at the 3rd Battle of Ypres which opened on 31 July 1917. This offensive faltered, however, so it was deemed too dangerous to attempt an assault on the coast. The monitors, which had been training at South West Reach in the River Thames without leave since July, were ordered to Portsmouth on 2 October. Wolfe arrived on 4 October and was dry-docked for maintenance. 18-inch monitor Starboard quarter view of Wolfe showing her 18-inch gun to good effect. In the new year of 1918, Wolfe was selected to be converted to take an gun along with Lord Clive and Prince Eugene. The mounting for the gun, the largest in service with any navy, was named the \\"15-inch B C.D.\\". \\"15-inch B\\" was the code name for the 18-inch gun itself, and C.D., for \\"Coast Defence\\" reflected the possible usage of the mount on land. The mounting was designed and produced by the Elswick Ordnance Company and due to labour troubles, although ordered in October 1917, it was not completed until May, and finally arrived in Portsmouth for installation on Wolfe on 20 June 1918. Wolfe had been taken in hand by Portsmouth Dockyard on 5 April for the structural modifications required to take the weight of the 18-inch gun and mounting on her quarterdeck. The total weight of the mounting was 384 tons, not including the weight of sixty shells and seventy-two full charges of cordite. The gun itself, which was fixed to starboard, had been intended for \\"A\\" turret of the large light cruiser and was fitted on 9 July. Wolfe was ready for gun trials on 7 August, which took place off the Isle of Wight and were successful. The mounting, with its large box-shaped shield, so disfigured the stern of the ship that it earned Wolfe the nickname of \\"Elephant and Castle\\". On 15 August the monitor returned to the Dover Patrol, the first of the 18-inch monitors to re-enter service. She had a new commanding officer, Commander S.B. Boyd- Richardson. The rest of August and most of September she saw no action. In cooperation with Allied forces attacking on the coast of Belgium, the monitors were used on a protracted shore bombardment. In the night of 27/28 September, the seven monitors available to the Patrol bombarded targets near Ostend and Zeebruge, using their sub-calibre (smaller) guns, to trick the Germans into thinking that a night landing by Allied forces might be made there (following the earlier Ostend and Zeebrugge Raids in April). By dawn the monitors had arranged themselves in three divisions off the West Deep, where they could harass German lines of communication far inland. Wolfe was in Division III with the new-completed coast defence ship HMS Gorgon. Wolfe was anchored parallel to the coastline, and at 0732 opened fire on the railway bridge at Snaeskerke (four miles south of Ostend) at a range of away. She therefore fired the heaviest shell from the largest gun at the longest range up to that time, and at the longest range any Royal Navy ship has fired in action. During the rest of the day Wolfe fired fifty-two 18-inch shells out of her supply of sixty at Snaeskerke, all landing close to the target. For the next two weeks, Wolfe and the other monitors of the patrol kept up an intermittent bombardment of the Belgian coast, interrupted by bad weather or lack of air support for spotting the fall of shot. In mid-October the Germans evacuated the Belgian coast and the monitors returned to Sheerness when the Armistice was signed. Wolfe paid off on 19 November 1918. Post-war General Wolfe was placed on the sale list by Admiralty order on 7 April 1920. It had been announced on the 6th that she, in company with the other monitors lying at Immingham being tended by care and maintenance parties, would travel singly to the Portsmouth Royal Dockyard to have guns and other useful fittings removed, after which they would then return to the Humber. In December 1920 her 18-inch gun was removed and placed into storage; it was scrapped in 1933. The ship was sold to Thos W Ward on 9 May 1921 and broken up at Hayle in 1923.

Background  In a reviewing article for Resident Advisor, it clearly describes The X-Ecutioners as a \\"four-man DJ battle group as a team that consists of Rob Swift, Mista Sinista, Total Eclipse and Roc Raida coming out with a new album, Built from Scratch, to take the music genre of turntablism from an underground phenomenon to a more accessible sound. The record is more than a P.Diddy record, as it is a straight up hip-hop record of 2002 using the techniques being more built up from the days when Grandmaster Flash had his own adventure behind the wheel.\\"DJ Robotek RA Reviews: X-ecutioners - Built from Scratch on Sony (Album) Resident Advisor Retrieved July 31, 2014 \\"No hip-hop record is complete nowadays without the usual intro,\\" as described from the article via Resident Advisor, \\"and ever since producer Prince Paul (formerly De La) brought them out the Skit. A lot of albums really have skits that are wack and get way too played out. However, The X-Ecutioners pulled off decent skits and incorporated a lot of scratching routines into 'em, as well as being quite funny.\\" The skit, entitled \\"You Can't Scratch\\" that appears on this album, is carefully described well. \\"The album isn't just about skits,\\" continuously being described from Resident Advisor, \\"but all about the hip-hop music and turntablism, and proper tracks that have all been done quite well. All the skits and the songs appear on this album as listed in the record.\\"  Tracks  \\"Intro\\", which features Vinroc, Apollo and Shortkut of the Triple Threat DJ's, has all the mad scratching DJ's in the states that are Flipino's mainly on the west coast of San Francisco to be exact, as they represented quite well for the album. \\"XL\\", which features Large Professor, has a smooth head nodding hip-hop track with one of the most and greatest emcees on the Main Source with a sound that is familiar. \\"X-ecutioners Scratch\\" has an old-school sketchy madness, which people can recognize a lot of cuts on the track as the X-Men takes them on a hip-hop history lesson with the same kind of vibe that goes for all scratchy tracks on the record. \\"A Journey Into Sound\\", which features Kenny Mohammed, who can beatbox in this track, compliments their style very well as they cut up the battle breaks with proficient technology. \\"Let It Bang\\", which features rap duo M.O.P., is a bit of a tribute to the classical track, entitled \\"Ante Up\\", getting the feeling to start any party with their hardcore rhyme delivery and production, which makes it almost sound like a rock song. \\"X-Ecutioners (Theme) Song)\\", which features Dan the Automator, has a signature Automator feel, making it a real head nodding hip-hop, which sounds like a track from a Handsome Boy Modeling School album, digging a juggling routine as they create their own drumming pattern while using battle records. Besides the \\"You Can't Scratch\\" skit appearing on the record as the tenth track, \\"It's Goin' Down\\", which features Mike Shinoda and Joe Hahn (Mr. Hahn) of American rock band Linkin Park, has a rap rock style to expect from Linkin Park being taken into the X-Ecution chamber, ready to be finally cut up, getting a lot of the JJJ play already, and is quite a decent track with a pretty average and flawless rap from Shinoda. An instrumental version of \\"It's Goin' Down\\" on the 12\\" format is included in the single that was released in March 2002. The single samples \\"Dedicated (Demo 1999)\\" from the LP Underground 2.0 EP, \\"Step Up\\" from the Hybrid Theory EP, and \\"Year 2000\\" by Xzibit. \\"Premier's X-ecution\\", which features DJ Premier, who puts his signature as a smooth hip-hop production style on the track as the X-Men cut onto the top. \\"The X (Y'all Know the Name)\\", which features Pharoahe Monch, Xzibit, Inspectah Deck, and Skillz, picked a creme de le creme of emcees who can easily flow to the beat. After cutting up samples for \\"3 Boroughs\\", Pharoahe Monch makes an appearance on the track and kicks some real flows, as Xzibit never fails to flow with the impression on his usual gruff voice delivery, while Inspectah Deck shows his versatility Wu-Tanger style and kicks some decent lines from his raps, and Skillz delivers mad skills on the mic. \\"Genius of Love 2002\\", which is a partial cover of Tom Tom Club's \\"Genius of Love\\", features Tom Tom Club and Biz Markie on the track with his usual comical rhyme delivery. \\"B-Boy Rock 2001\\", which features Everlast, has more piano sampling hip-hop beats, not making it as crazy as Busta Rhymes' \\"Woo-Hah\\", as Everlast flows gets pretty stocky as a standard House of Pain style that works pretty well on the record. Besides the \\"Who Wants to Be a Motherfuckin' Millionaire\\" skit, listed as \\"Who Wants to Be a M*****F*****' Millionaire\\" on the back cover of the audio compact disc, \\"Play That Beat\\", which features uncredited rap vocals from Fatman Scoop on the record, is the track that could follow the path, after hearing the sampling club anthem of \\"Be Faithful\\" by Faith Evans. It is another history lesson in hip-hop with a hip-hop classic sample, as Fatman Scoop goes nuts for the mic, teaching people how to dance with the shout to who the DJ's are on the record. However, a Lo-Fidelity All Stars Remix of \\"Play That Beat\\" has a bit more of a disco groove with Fatman Scoop getting on the less annoying side and the vocoder adds the extra bit of funk. \\"Dramacyde\\", which features Big Pun and Kool G Rap, has a thug style rap that flows from the hip-hop originator of gangsta rap and Big Pun, who died on February 7, 2000 from suffering a fatal heart attack and respiratory failure at a Crowne Plaza Hotel while staying with his family before the album's slated release in September 2001. Kool G Rap's flows sound similar of the contributed UNKLE release, but the song shows off more of X-Men instead of the emcees. \\"X-ecution of a Bum Rush\\", which features the Beat Junkies (consisting of DJ Babu and rapper J-Rocc), has more of the east coast against the west coast turntablism, and a great ending to the album with hip-hop samples from both coasts, such as Dilated Peoples, and Gangstarr among others. History The record only spawned one hit single from the album, entitled \\"It's Goin' Down\\", which was released in March 2002. The single was heavily written, produced, and performed by Linkin Park members Shinoda and Hahn. They both appear in the official music video along with other Linkin Park members, including Rob Bourdon and Dave \\"Phoenix\\" Farrell on drums and bass respectively, with Wayne Static from American rock band Static-X on the guitars. However, Bourdon and Phoenix of Linkin Park, and Static of Static-X were all not involved with the recording session for the single in the studio. The main album cover is based on Public Enemy's first album, Yo! Bum Rush the Show; an alternative cover simply shows the DJ group's logo and album title on a scratched orange surface (similar as the \\"It's Goin' Down\\" single cover).

David Garcia (January 8, 1944 ‚Äì August 28, 2007) was a broadcast journalist for ABC News. Garcia had the distinction of becoming one of the first Hispanic news correspondents for a major American television network in the 1970s. Garcia was born James David Garcia, in Temple, Texas and briefly attended Baylor University in the 1960s, but said they had little or nothing to teach him, so he left. He began his career at a local radio in Temple at KTEM radio station while in high school and was soon hired by WFAA radio in Dallas, Texas. He possessed an unusually deep voice with a rounded, warm sound that marked his on-air delivery with authority. The 1960s were a period when the older style of stern sounding newscasters on radio and television was giving way to a more informal, friendly style. Garcia's voice and delivery neatly bridged the changing era. During his time with WFAA radio, Garcia was selected to anchor the Saturday evening newscasts on WFAA-TV, a job he was carrying out, along with radio reporting, at the time he was hired by ABC radio in New York in 1969. While working for ABC News, Garcia served as a secondary reporter at the White House during the Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter administrations. He later was named chief of ABC's Latin America bureau, where he covered the assassination of Nicaraguan President Anastasio Somoza Garcia, among other stories. While working in Latin America, Garcia became interested in environmental reporting after visiting rain forests in the region. He later moved to Los Angeles, California where his career included stints at KNXT (now KCBS-TV), KNBC and KTTV. His duties at KNXT included anchoring general reporting and hosting a public affairs program titled At Issue/With David Garcia. He covered the environmental beat from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s at KNBC and from 1993 to 2001 at KTTV, where he served as the station's environmental reporter earning the nickname \\"Earthman.\\" As Earthman, Garcia achieved such visibility throughout the Los Angeles area that children would send him letters addressed \\"Earthman, Los Angeles\\" and the postal service would deliver them to Garcia at his station. In 2002 he began hosting a newsmagazine show titled Eye on Riverside County at KPSP-LP. It was during this period that Garcia and his wife, Susan Garcia, went \\"on the road\\" together with a video camera and produced half hour programs around the American west for a local public broadcasting station. His wife would shoot and edited the video, Garcia would narrate and appear on camera. He and his wife were actively engaged in this pursuit at the time for his death. Garcia died in Rancho Mirage, California of complications from a liver ailment at the age of 63.David Garcia, 63; pioneering Latino newsman, environmental reporter dubbed 'Earthman', Los Angeles Times, Jocelyn Y.

Operational history Redpoll was laid down as YMS-294, 10 June 1943 by Associated Shipbuilders, Lake Union, Seattle, Washington; launched 11 August 1943; sponsored by Miss Joanne Swanson; and commissioned 11 September 1943. In the Puget Sound area through the fall of 1943, YMS-294 moved south to San Pedro, California, in January 1944 and operated out of that port until April. On the 21st, the motor minesweeper steamed west and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 1 May. Thence, she completed a run to Midway Island and back and in June she continued on to the Marshall Islands. There through the end of the war, she engaged in patrol operations, convoy escort duty and minesweeping operations principally out of Kwajalein and Eniwetok. In December 1945, she returned to Hawaii; remained there until February; then, ordered inactivated, got underway for the U.S. East Coast. She arrived at Charleston, South Carolina, in late June, received new orders, and in September retraced her route back to the Gulf of Mexico for duty in the 8th Naval District. On 12 November she was decommissioned and placed in service at New Orleans, Louisiana. The following month she assumed U.S. Naval Reserve training duties at Houston, Texas. Named Redpoll and redesignated AMS-57, 1 September 1947, she was recommissioned effective 20 November 1950, but until 1952 remained in the 8th Naval District as a reserve training ship. In May 1952, she departed Lake Charles, Louisiana, and steamed back to the Atlantic coast. Assigned to the 5th Naval District for the next 5 years, she operated out of Norfolk, Virginia, for 2 years, then, in June 1954, shifted to Yorktown, Virginia, for duty with the Mine Warfare School. On 7 February 1955, Redpoll was redesignated MSCO-57 and in October 1957 she was ordered to Chattanooga, Tennessee, for reserve training duty. She arrived at her new homeport 2 November and 6 days later, 8 November, was again decommissioned and placed in service. A little over 1-1/2 years later she completed her last tour. She was placed out of service and struck from the Navy list 1 July 1959.

It fought in the battle of Lake Njemen and the battle of Vilnius in September 1915. From October 1915 to September 1917, the division occupied the line between Lake Naraƒç and Lake Dr≈´k≈°iai. In November/December 1917, it occupied the line near Daugavpils. After the armistice on the Eastern Front, the division remained stationary on the armistice line until February and March 1918, when it was involved in fighting in the Baltic region. At the end of March 1918, the division was transferred to the Western Front, where it entered the line in the Champagne region. It later fought against the Allied counterattacks in the Second Battle of the Marne. The division remained on various parts of the front until the end of the war.

Synopsis Three thousand years ago in the Moonlands, the Shadow Magi Agram was sealed inside the planet's Core by the Core Glyph and the Dreamstones which provided its power. Now he plans to escape by using his Shadow Geysers to weaken his prison in order to bring the Moonlands under his control, and only a Magi known as the \\"Final Dreamer\\" can stop him. A young boy from Earth, Tony Jones, is summoned into the Moonlands as he is believed to be this Final Dreamer. He joins forces with the apprentice Magi, Edyn, and the Shadow Stalker, Strag, on a mission to gather the Dreamstones before Agram is set free. Using the Book of Elders, the three travel through the Moonlands while combatting the forces of Agram and gaining an ever-growing collection of Dream Creatures from the Moonlands that they visit.

He has dark brown hair, a fur vest and heavy-duty boots as well as developing a muscular chest and arms from his time in the Moonlands. Although initially reluctant to take on his role as a hero, Tony comes to accept the realm as his new home and his friends as a family. After months of training, he becomes a skilled warrior who adjusts to his new world's culture and lifestyle. He also has a crush on Trup'tika, a girl of his age from the ocean realm of Orothe. His main Dream Creature is Furok (voiced by Alan Park), a mysterious bearlike creature who is his best friend and protector. * Martha MacIsaac as Edyn, a 14-year-old beautiful girl from the forests of Naroom who lives with her guardian, Orwin. She's Tony's other best friend, always there to have his back, is well-read in the books of the Moonlands, caring, organized, brave, and is an expert magic spell caster. She has very long red hair tied up in a ponytail, an athletic, slender figure topped off with a leaf skirt and red short-sleeved shirt. Her main Dream Creature is Ugger (voiced by Joseph Motiki), a plant-based creature with a rhinoceros-like horn. * Dan Petronijevic as Strag, a 14-year-old from the Underneath who has trained as a Shadow Stalker to rid the Moonlands of the Shadow Magi. He is one of the Final Dreamers alongside Tony and Edyn, and is able to use his Moon senses to aid them in their adventures. Despite this training, he is of the lineage of the first Shadow Magi, Agram, and lives with this shadow. Strag primarily uses relics and his turtlelike Dream Creature, Freep (voiced by Rick Miller). * Martin Roach as Agram, the powerful leader of the Shadow Magi who was sealed in the Core of the Moonlands 3,000 years ago. He uses his Shadow Geysers to weaken his prison in an attempt to return to the surface Moonlands. During the first season, he escaped from the Core but was re-imprisoned with the Book of Elders. In the second season, he returned using the body of Gorath, one of his Dream Creatures. * Alex Karzis and Rory O'Shea as Korg and Zed, Agram's primary henchmen. They are a duo of evil, yet bumbling Shadow Magi who use an arsenal of evil Dream Creatures supplied by Agram. They later are joined by other Shadow Magi including Chur, Ashio, and Warrada. Recurring * Rick Miller as Orwin, the Elder of Vash Naroom and Edyn's guardian. He is a powerful Magi and a mentor to Tony, Edyn, and Strag. Though Orwin was later turned into a Shadow Magi by Korg and Zed in \\"Fiery Betrayal,\\" he was soon returned to normal in \\"The Secret Chamber.\\" * Julie Lemieux as Evu, a wise old woman from Vash Naroom. She helped to summon Tony to the Moonlands and often assisted Tony, Edyn, and Strag on their adventures. She is a wise sage and displays great power despite her age and her size. * Rick Miller as Ashio, a Shadow Magi who was sent to destroy the Moonland of Paradwyn. * Helen King as Trup'tika, a teenage mermaid girl from the realm of Orothe. She has long red- pink hair tied in two buns, pointed ears, gills, and can transform her legs into a tail to enable her to swim with ummatched grace and agility. Trup'tika has a noticeable crush on Tony, which Strag and Edyn often tease him about. She admires (and thus, is attracted to)Tony for his selflessness and bravery in his quest to save the Moonlands from destruction. Dream Creatures Dream Creatures are creatures that inhabit the Moonlands and originate from the Dream Plane. A Magi who gains the trust of a Dream Creature or defeats it in battle gains an Animite crystal. This Animite can be used to summon that Dream Creature back from the Dream Plane when needed by using some of a Magi's energy. A Dream Creature that is defeated simply returns to the Dream Plane and can be summoned again if the Magi has sufficient energy. Within the Dream Plane, even corrupted Core Creatures are temporarily purified to their natural states.  Guardian Hyrens  The Guardian Hyrens are unique Dream Creatures and a subset of the often draconic Hyrens. Each Guardian Hyren protects a particular Moonland and, namely, its respective Dreamstone. A test is given to those seeking a Guardian Hyren's Dreamstone in order to test that Magi's worthiness and character.

Hans Rudolph, born in Frankfurt, Germany, became a mechanical apprentice and attended vocational school there to learn his chosen trade. In October 1923 he emigrated to Rosholt, South Dakota. He helped on his uncle's farm and in September 1924 moved to St. Louis, where he worked in a machine shop. Two years later he was hired by a machine shop in Chicago and he studied electronics, earning a diploma in the subject. He married Elizabeth Wilke, also from Germany, and they began raising a family. In June 1930 the Rudolphs moved to Kansas City, where Hans worked in another machine shop. In February 1932 Rudolph started work as an instrument maker for the physiology department of Indiana University. He stayed with this position until June 1941. It was there he designed and produced, in 1938, a high velocity valve for pulmonary function testing. He then produced a machine to record PFT results on paper. Rudolph returned to Kansas City in June 1941 and spent the rest of his life there. He serviced and repaired research equipment for public schools, laboratories and universities. He kept working with respiratory valves, as well. From 1945 to 1955 he went into partnership with Glade Ives. Their company was named Multiform. In 1955 the partnership ended and Rudolph started a machine shop in his basement. He received numerous orders for his high velocity valve and he built other equipment. In 1961 Hans and his son, John Rudolph, incorporated the company as Hans Rudolph, Inc. They moved out of the basement and to 7200 Wyandotte, Kansas City, Missouri. The company operated at that location for 46 years. On the day of October 19, 2007 they moved into the newly built World Headquarters at 8325 Cole Parkway, Shawnee, KS 66227. As the years went by, Hans Rudolph designed and patented more respiratory equipment and concentrated on his respiratory line. John and Hans began design work on masks for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines in the early 1980s. CPAPs aid those with obstructive and central sleep apnea, so they may get adequate sleep. Hans Rudolph's grandsons, Kevin Rudolph and Kelly Rudolph, joined the business after graduating from university programs. Kevin and others worked on a mouth face mask for the CPAP machine and the mask was patented in 1991. It is ironic that production of CPAP masks did not begin until near the very end of Hans Rudolph's life. Elizabeth died in 1987. Hans worked for his company up to the very end of his 90 years. In fact, he worked the day he died. Hans Rudolph left quite a legacy in the design and production of respiratory equipment and supplies. Hans, John, Kevin and Kelly built upon the research of Hans to design CPAP and BIPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure) masks to allow persons with sleep apnea to get better rest and maintain better health. In recent years, CPAP and BIPAP have been proven to help with a number of ailments, aside from sleep apnea. In the years since Hans died, Hans Rudolph, Inc., has expanded its line of CPAP and BIPAP masks and improved upon them. The company also has developed accessories for masks and has marketed equipment for pulmonary function studies, ventilator equipment, and various connectors for CPAP/BIPAP circuits (allowing for the flow of supplemental oxygen and other gases). The company has in addition developed a line of anesthesia products. References *Hans Rudolph, Inc., Catalog.

It was proposed by means of the initiative process as a version of the Jessica's Law proposals that had been considered in other states. Provisions The Act was a lengthy and complex measure that made many changes to the California Penal Code and the Welfare and Institutions Code. Its provisions increased the penalties for sex offenders, broadened the definition of certain sexual offenses, eliminated good time credits for early release of certain offenders, prohibited probation for certain crimes, extended parole for some offenses, increased court-imposed fees on sex offenders and provided for lifelong GPS monitoring of high risk sex offenders. The law also barred convicted sex offenders from living within 2,000 feet of a school or any place where children gather‚Äîeffectively blocking them from living in the vast majority of the areas of large California cities, until the provision was found unconstitutional by Supreme Court of California in March 2015. Under the law, a sex offender with a minimum of one victim and any previous criminal history may be civilly committed for an indefinite period. Initiative campaign The law was sponsored by husband and wife legislators State Senator George Runner (R-Antelope Valley) and State Assemblywoman Sharon Runner (R-Antelope Valley). It was supported by Governor Schwarzenegger and law enforcement throughout the state. California Attorneys for Criminal Justice (a criminal defense attorneys association) opposed Proposition 83 and wrote the opposing argument for the voter pamphlet. They argued the restrictions would cause problems with finding a place of residence for freed convicts. Result of voteEnforcement In November 2006, enforcement of the new law was initially blocked in four counties by U.S. District Judge Susan Illston who ruled in a lawsuit filed by an existing offender based on its retroactive nature.Prop. 83 buffer zone for sex criminals blocked November 9, 2006 However, three months later, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White dismissed that lawsuit. In 2010, the Supreme Court of California ruled that the residency requirements of Jessica's Law could be applied retroactively. On September 12, 2012, a state appeals court blocked enforcement of the residency requirements of Jessica's Law for all paroled sex offenders in San Diego County, affirming a lower court ruling, stating that it was an unconstitutional blanket condition of parole that \\"limits the housing choices of all sex offenders identically, without regard to the type of victim or the risk of reoffending.\\" During 2014 RSOL's Californian chapter CA RSOL sued over 20 municipalities in federal court over sex offender ordinances causing at least 44 other municipalities to either repeal or quit enforcing their ordinances in order to avoid litigation. In March 2015 Supreme Court of California deemed blanket residency restrictions unconstitutional citing their counterproductive effect and unfairness. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) has stated that every registered sex offender paroled after the law's passage in 2006 is wearing a GPS device. However, CDCR is responsible for only 11% of California's sex offenders statewide, and \\"only a fraction of the state's registered sex offenders wear a GPS unit\\".

History  The castle was built between 1124 and 1146 by order of Bishop Otto of Bamberg. In an 1160 deed, Emperor Friedrich I mentioned Grivena as a Bamberg property. In 1292 the Carinthian nobleman Count Ulrich von Heunburg with support of Archbishop Konrad IV of Salzburg occupied the fort in an uprising against Albert of Habsburg, the son of King Rudolph I of Germany and Duke Meinhard II. However Ulrich was abandoned by his allies and one year later had to leave the castle. In 1759 Bishop Adam Friedrich sold the Bamberg estates in Carinthia to Maria Theresa of Austria and the castle was incorporated into the Carinthian duchy. About 1520 a large reconstruction of the castle took place as a protection against the threat posed by the Ottoman forces with a base amounted of about 4000 m¬≤, though the Turks never laid siege to Griffen. In 1659, lightning struck one of the towers and the decay of the castle began. In 1768 a last religious service took place and about 1840 the roofs were torn. In 2000 the preservation of the castle began. A steep footpath leads up the mountain to the ruins.

Also the Pensacola towed the YMS-299 once at a speed that was too fast and the YMS-299 crew thought that it would be the end of them, but all went well! Following shakedown, the YMS-299, a wooden hulled minesweeper, sailed west to Hawaii where she operated under Commander, Hawaiian Sea Frontier, until December 1943. Then proceeding further across the Pacific Ocean she steamed to Makin where, on 20 December, she was damaged while sweeping the approaches to Butaritari. Ordered first to Tarawa, then to Funafuti for repairs, she returned to Makin toward the end of February. In April she shifted to Kwajalein, thence to Majuro in May. Through the summer, she conducted ASW patrols and provided escort services in the Marshall Islands and, in early October, returned to the Gilbert Islands en route to Pearl Harbor and an overhaul. Heading west again in late February 1945 YMS-299 arrived off Okinawa on 1 April. An element of task unit TU 52.7.2 she remained in the area until July, sweeping the approaches to the Hagushi beaches, to the Kerama Retto anchorage, and to Buckner Bay.

The object is to acquire all of the enemies' territory and defeat the evil gang leaders. Even though this game was only released in Japan, the gangsters fight without any weapons and the violence level is mild compared to later gang-related games. Gameplay=Strategy A couple of computer controlled street gangs are fighting on an urban street. Once the main gang leader is defeated in either or mode, the remaining members of the gang switch membership to become a gray-colored gang that does not have a leader. Consequently, all territory that belonged to leader that was killed in combat becomes neutral territory with a number describing the strength of the \\"neutral gangs.\\" These \\"neutral gangs\\" will attempt to defend their turf. In order for a gang with colors (red, blue, or green) to use the land as their own, they must eliminate all the gangsters in that territory. However, invasions can be canceled before they can begin by saying \\"no\\" when asked to . Neutral gangs, fortunately, do not have ability to invade the territories of the red, blue, or green colored gangs. There are three difficulty levels for computer opponents and games are possible with two or three colors (but never with only one color). After naming the character (using the Japanese alphabet), the player must select his face that will represent his main gang leader. The two gang leaders involved will use a special fighting game engine to settle their differences while individual gang members will fight each other through a special battle screen. The battle screen allows players to use special effects against the opponent like a motorcycle, a thunderstorm, or even a quick call to the police's riot squad. All brawls are timed by a timer which is never seen in the game. That means if there is no determined winner in a certain number of time, the brawl ends with a stalemate and no territory gains or losses are made. The brawl can be re- initiated either during the player's next turn or during the opponent's turn. There are eight different maps to choose from that depict the world in a manner similar to the board game Risk. There are islands with land bridges and bodies of water to them. Between combat, the player can either his gang members from territory to territory or immediately end his turn. It is possible for a player to transfer all of his gang members out of a territory, turning it into a blank grey territory without a number. Fighting In addition to the strategy mode, there is also a variation of the game that focus exclusively on street fighting using either the or the mode. With a cast of 20 (twenty) characters, it was considered to be one of largest line-ups for an 8-bit fighting game compared to Nekketsu Kakut≈ç Densetsu with 22 (twenty- two) characters, Tenkaichi Bushi Keru Nag≈´ru having 16 (sixteen) characters in 1989, and Joy Mech Fight which has 36 (thirty-six) characters. Out of the 20 (twenty) characters available for picking, the player must pick 5 (five) and the computer must do the same. When a fighter is defeated, he is eliminated and is forced to play against the next fighter. Victory is assured when the opponent's fifth fighter is defeated in combat.

This section of the Lincoln Highway, one of only that were paved with brick in Nebraska, is one of the most well-preserved in the country. The roadway was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. The Lincoln Highway was the first road across the United States, traversing coast-to-coast from Times Square in New York City to Lincoln Park in San Francisco, California. History The original Lincoln Highway was built from Omaha to Elkhorn in 1913. The Lincoln Highway crossed the Missouri River into Omaha on the old Douglas Street Bridge and traveled west on Dodge Street, from which point it began meandering across the state following section lines. However, after the Abraham Lincoln Memorial Bridge was built at Blair in 1929, the following year Lincoln Highway was rerouted for the last time onto U.S. 30 through Blair. Soon after the rerouting was completed, local officials from Blair came to Omaha and dug up the Lincoln Highway markers that lined the road, only to re-insert them in their town. This infuriated Omahans and incited a long-standing resentment against Blair. The elimination of the Omaha section managed to preserve the roadway from too much usage, effectively securing its usage and appreciation today. Landmarks According to the National Park Service, important buildings on the Lincoln Highway in Omaha included the Nash Block at 902-912 Farnam and 901-911 Douglas streets, as well as the Blackstone Hotel at Farnam Street and 36th Street. Additionally, the Rose Blumkin Performance Arts Center at 20th and Farnam Street and the Farnam Street Automobile Row, from 30th to 40th Streets were both important landmarks. There were several other attractions on the Lincoln Highway in Omaha. They included Jobber's Canyon, a warehousing district in the downtown area that once outfitted the Old West, and Peony Park, an amusement park that was home to Lawrence Welk's orchestra in the 1930s. Other important landmarks along the highway included the Guy Barton Mansion, built in 1892 and demolished in 1982; the Hupmobile dealership at 25th and Farnam, which is the last preserved Hupmobile dealership in the United States, and; John Sutter's Mill, built in 1847 and the intersection of Saddle Creek Road and Dodge Street, immediately east of the Saddle Creek Underpass, was a landmark during the entire life of the Highway, and predated the incorporation of the neighboring towns of Dundee and Benson. Preservation In 1975 the Douglas County Board of Commissioners passed a resolution to maintain and preserve the roadway. In the 1980s preservationists pushed for the highway to be restored after plans were revealed that covered the road with asphalt. The section was eventually restored with original bricks that were laid in 1920. To protect the brickwork, vehicles weighing 6 tons or more are now banned from the highway. Development The highway is currently marked by an interpretive pull-off maintained by the Omaha Public Power District, and there is a reconstructed pony truss bridge over the West Papillion Creek. There are seven historical markers lining the roadway, including a monument was erected by the Elkhorn Lincoln Highway Diamond Jubilee Committee in 1987. It includes an historic plaque and two replica 1928 Lincoln Highway markers. The city of Omaha proposed an approximately $633,000 plan to enhance the roadway with a paved trail to the south of the highway and informational kiosks. This would be the farthest west trail in Omaha, although it would not connect with any other trails in the city. The Omaha government has already acquired the land needed for the trail. Directions According to the Lincoln Highway Association, the Lincoln Highway in Omaha can still be followed through the city. The route begins by exiting I-480 at Dodge Street and following it westward, past when it becomes West Dodge Road. The actual route is Douglas St. from the river west to 18th or 24th (depending on the year). South to Farnam St. West on Farnam St. to 40th St. North on 40th to Dodge St. West to 78th St. North to West Dodge Rd. West on West Dodge Road to 180th. North to the longest stretch of original Lincoln Highway bricks in the country. Two and a half miles west of Boys Town the route turns right at the Lincoln Highway sign at North 183 Street.

Fiction is a form of narrative, one of the four rhetorical modes of discourse. Fiction-writing also has distinct forms of expression, or modes, each with its own purposes and conventions. Currently, there is no consensus within the writing community regarding the number and composition of fiction-writing modes and their uses. Some writing modes suggested include action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, scene, description, background, exposition and transition.Marshall, 1998, p. 143-65.Morrell, 2006, p. 127.Selgin, 2007, p. 38. Overview The concept goes back at least as far as Aristotle who, in Poetics, referred to narration and action as different modes or manner of representing something.Aristotle, pp. 3, 5. For many years, fiction writing was described as having two types: narration and dialogue. Evan Marshall, in The Marshall Plan for Novel Writing (1998) noted that writers should know what they are doing at all times. He described what he called fiction-writing modes‚Äîthe types of writing of which all fiction is made. He listed five modes: action, summary, dialogue, feelings/thoughts, and background, each with its own set of conventions regarding how, when, and where it should be used.Marshall, pp. 143-165. *Jessica Page Morrell, in Between the Lines: Master the Subtle Elements of Fiction Writing (2006), mentioned six delivery modes: action, exposition, description, dialogue, summary, and transition.Morrell, p. 127. *Peter Selgin, in By Cunning and Craft: Sound Advice and Practical Wisdom for Fiction Writers (2007), mentioned five writing methods: action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, and description.Selgin, p. 38. *Mike Klaassen, in Fiction-Writing Modes: Eleven Essential Tools for Bringing Your Story to Life (2015), addressed eleven modes: action, summarization, narration, description, exposition, transition, conversation (dialogue), sensation, introspection, emotion, and recollection.Klaassen, p. 3. Narration In Poetics, Aristotle mentions narration as a mode, or manner of representing something.Aristotle, p. 5. As a fiction-writing mode, narration is how the narrator communicates directly to the reader. This contrasts with the use of the term \\"narration\\" as a rhetorical mode of discourse, where it has a broader meaning which encompasses all written fiction. Description Description is the fiction-writing mode for transmitting a mental image of the particulars of a story. Together with dialogue, narration, exposition, and summarization, description is one of the most widely recognized of the fiction-writing modes. Description is more than the amassing of details, it is bringing a scene to life by carefully choosing and arranging words and phrases to produce the desired effect.Polking, 1990, p. 106. Exposition Broadly defined, exposition is one of four rhetorical modes of discourse. Within the context of fiction-writing modes, exposition is used to convey information. Exposition may be used to add drama to a story, but too much exposition at one time may slow the pace of the story.Kernen, 1999, p. 57. Summarization Summarization, or narrative summary, condenses events to convey, rather than to show, what happens within a story.Marshall, 1998, p. 144-6. The \\"tell\\" in the axiom \\"Show, don't tell\\" is often in the form of summarization. Summarization may be used to: * connect parts of a story * report details of less important events * skip events that are irrelevant to the plot * convey an emotional state over an extended period of timeMarshall, 1998, p. 145. * vary the rhythm and texture of the writingBrowne, King & Booth, 2004, p. 12. The main advantage of summary is that it takes up less space than other fiction-writing modes.Selgin, 2007, p. 31. Effective use of summarization requires a balance between showing and telling, action and summary, with rhythm, pace and tone playing a role.Card, 1999, p. 140-2. Introspection Introspection (also referred to as internal dialogue, interior monologue, or self-talk) is the fiction-writing mode used to convey the thoughts of a character, allowing the expression of normally unexpressed thoughts.Browne, King & Booth, 2004, p. 117. Introspection may also be used to: * enhance a story by allowing the character's thoughts to deepen characterisation * increase tension * widen the scope of a storyKress, 2003, p. 38. * play a critical role in both scene and sequelBickham, 1993, pp. 12-22, 50-8 Recollection Recollection is the fiction-writing mode whereby a character remembers a detail or event. It plays a vital role in conveying backstory by allowing writers to convey information from earlier in the story or from before the beginning of the story. Although recollection is not widely recognized as a distinct mode of fiction-writing, it is a common tool. Recollection could be considered a subset of introspection, but its role in developing backstory separates it from the other thoughts of a character. Effective presentation of recollection has its own unique issues and challenges. For example, timing a recollection to avoid implausible-seeming memories (such as when a character must make a key decision) can be difficult, and should be prompted by a recent plot event.Card, 1999, p. 113. Sensation Sensation is used to portray a character's perceptions. It can help draw the reader in by conveying the actual sensations of things comprising the story, breathing life into its physical world.Rozelle, 2005, p. 76.Morrell, 2006, p. 172. Since the reader has experienced only a portion of the sensations experienced by the character, the author aims to either provoke recall from the reader, or convey the experience,Rozelle, 2005, p. 86. drawing the reader in and maintaining interest in the story.Morrell, 2006, p. 173. Emotion The fiction-writing mode of emotion conveys the feelings of the character, and is a vital component of creative writing.Reid, 1994, p. 105. Connecting the character to his or her own emotions allows the author to connect with the reader on an emotional level.Kempton, 2004, p. 148.Card, 1999, p. 74. Action In Poetics, Aristotle refers to action as a mode, or manner of representing something.Aristotle, p. 5. Action is the demonstration of events as they are happening in a story,Marshall, 1998, p. 142.Morrell, 2006, p. 127. and may help readers feel as if they were participating in the plot.Rosenfeld, 2008, p. 173. Transition Transitions in fiction are words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, or punctuation that may be used to signal various changes in a story, including changes in time, location, point-of-view character, mood, tone, emotion, and pace.Morrell, 2006, p. 281-2.Polking, 1990, p. 495. Categories Fiction-writing modes may be classified into categories of modes with common features. * InteriorityScofield, p. 6. includes modes that reflect the inner workings of the character's mind: introspection, recollection, emotion, and sensation.Klaassen, p. 11. * Exteriority includes modes that represent what is outside the character's mind: narration, description, exposition, and transition.Klaassen, p. 147. * Dialogue represents a character's speech: conversation.Klaassen, p. 85. * Activity includes modes used to portray story events: action and summarization.Klaassen, p. 63.

Formerly the birds were slaughtered and used for food. Decoys had an advantage over hunting ducks with shotguns as the duck meat did not contain lead shot. Consequently, a higher price could be charged for it. Some decoys are still used for hunting ducks. But they are also now used for ornithological research, and the birds are released after capture. Etymology The word decoy is derived from the Dutch word eendenkooi, which means \\"duck-cage\\"; Chambers Dictionary suggests Dutch de kooi = \\"the cage\\". Description Screens by a duck decoy pipe in a nature reserve near Waardenburg, the Netherlands (2007) As finally developed the decoy consisted of a pool of water leading from which are from one to eight curving, tapering, water-filled ditches. Over each ditch is a series of hoops, initially made from wood, later from iron, which diminish in size as the ditch tapers. The hoops are covered in netting. The combination of ditch and net- covered hoop is known as a pipe. On the outside curve of the pipe, for two- thirds of its length, are overlapping screens. Operation Wild ducks fly in to settle on the central pool; the decoy operator might maintain a resident population of tame ducks to encourage them to do this. When a sufficient number have gathered, they are encouraged to swim down one of the pipes leading from the pool, where they are trapped. If the decoy has several pipes, then wind direction determines which one is used - it is important for the wind to be blowing approximately up the pipe so the decoyman remains downwind of the ducks. Ducks are encouraged to swim up the pipe using a dog, by feeding them, or a combination of both. *Use of dogs An 1886 illustration showing a decoy-man and his dog at work, :Ducks are naturally curious and when they see a predator, such as a fox, they will keep it at a distance, but tend to follow it. The decoyman uses a dog, preferably a breed similar in appearance to a fox, to lure the ducks along the pipes. For this purpose in the sixteenth century in the Netherlands the kooikerhondje breed was developed. The dog appears between a gap in the screens and the ducks approach. It then appears at the next gap further along the pipe, and so on until the ducks are trapped at the end of the pipe. For a dog to be suitable for this task, it must not bark, and must be completely obedient to the decoyman. The decoy man quietly directs the dog using hand gestures while watching the progress of the ducks using peep-holes in the screens. *Feeding :The decoyman walks behind the screens, throwing grain or other food over them while keeping out of sight. The ducks follow, eating the food, and are caught at the end of the pipe. This task requires some experience and judgment as too little food will not encourage the ducks to swim further down the pipe. While if too much is thrown to them, they will remain where they are to consume what's there. The decoyman might also have trained the tame ducks to associate a gentle whistling noise with feeding time. By blowing a whistle, the tame ducks will be encouraged to swim up the pipe, and the wild ducks will be more likely to follow them. Today= England  One of the pipes of Hale Duck Decoy (2005) In the mid-1880s there were 41 decoys still in operation in England, and 145 which were no longer in use. Today there are only a few remaining duck decoys in England. These include Hale Duck Decoy in Cheshire, administered by Halton Borough Council, Boarstall Duck Decoy near Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, owned and administered by the National Trust, and a decoy in Abbotsbury Swannery, Dorset. Some are used to trap ducks for non-harmful study, such as ringing them. Evidence of former duck decoys can be found. At Swanpool near Lincoln, cropmarks revealed in aerial photographs show the outlines of a decoy. In Somerset, west of Nyland Hill there is evidence of a pond with three pipes, and in Westbury there is a decoy with possibly six pipes.  Netherlands  A decoy in action; Dutch footage from 1974 There are about 111 decoys still in operation in the Netherlands with one of the oldest dating from the 13th century. The number of ducks still caught for consumption is small. Larger numbers of ducks are hunted by shooting. The decoys are mostly used for study purposes including ringing, but also for studying the avian flu.  Denmark and Germany  On the North Frisian Islands, decoys originally served as a pastime for sea captains and ships' officers during wintertime. Later the ponds were also used to trap great numbers of wild ducks for commercial purposes. In one decoy on F√∂hr island, more than 3,000,000 ducks have been caught since its installation in 1735, and from 1885 to 1931 a factory for canned duck meat was active in Wyk auf F√∂hr. The preserved meat was exported worldwide. Today there are six inactive decoys on F√∂hr. Another decoy is located near Norddorf on Amrum island. The decoy on Pellworm island was active until 1946. Today it is a public park and has been converted into an orchard.

Its main purpose is to protect the driver element and speaker internals (and possibly other audio components) from foreign objects while still allowing the sound to clearly pass. However, because it sits in the direct path of the driver, the grille interacts with the sound produced. A suitable compromise between protection and sound quality must be made based on the speaker's application. Types=Soft Grilles Soft grilles can be made from any well suited cloth, weaving, stitching, foam, fabric upholsteries and other similar materials. In general, soft grilles impose little resistance on the speaker driver because the material is free to move synchronously with the sound waves. Because the grille is capable of absorbing this vibration, softer grilles are (in general) less prone to rattling except at extremely high sound pressure levels. Soft grilles offer protection from small, lightweight objects, and may be water resistant to some degree but could be susceptible to being torn, or even stretched enough to reach the driver. Hard Grilles Hard grilles can be made from many types of construction material including metal, wood or plastic. Some solid grilles are made from a board or sheet of material with holes drilled or cut for the sound to pass, while others are made with thin strips of material either crosshatched together or equally spaced in parallel. Because hard material is not free to move with the speaker's sound like soft material, the speaker's output level must be considered when designing the grille. A grille with more holes will allow more sound to pass but will offer less protection from small objects. A speaker with too much material in front of the driver will begin to distort at higher sound pressure levels, and in severe instances could damage the speaker, resulting in unwanted rattling at the least. Impracticalities Some types of speakers have such eccentric characteristics that a grille would interact too much with the sound to be practical. Studio monitors, for instance, are required to reproduce audio so accurately that anything in the path of the speaker could obscure aspects of the sound, and thus are rarely seen with grilles. On the other hand, high powered subwoofers (such as those used in high-end car audio applications), produce such violent sound waves that a grille may be susceptible to rattling or damage while the driver is under load. All but the most sparse grilles also possess the possibility of diminishing or distorting the low frequency waves being produced. Some speakers simply don't need a grille, perhaps because they are enclosed in a case (such as speakers found inside personal computers) and are not meant to produce high fidelity audio, but only audible tones and noises.

In fact, in that election, the Partit Nazzjonalista managed an absolute majority of votes, but it managed only 31 seats to the Labour Party's 34. Dom Mintoff said that he would not be ready to govern in such conditions and hinted that he would call for fresh elections within six months. However, this was not to be: Mintoff eventually accepted the President's invitation to form a government. This led to a political crisis whose effects continued through much of the 1980s, as well as increasing political violence in the street. The election resulted in controversy because although the Nationalist Party received a majority of votes, the voting system in use led to Malta Labour Party winning a majority of seats and governing the Maltese islands with a disputed mandate, until the 1987 elections. This provoked a constitutional crisis, with the Nationalist Party boycotting parliament. As a result a compromise was reached whereby changes were made to the voting system to prevent a recurrence of the same problem. Under the new system if a repeat of the 1981 scenario occurs, the party supported by an overall majority of voters is awarded a number of additional seats from a party list, so that it secures a parliamentary majority.Malta: STV With Some Twists ACE Electoral system The 1981 election was held under the single transferable vote (PR-STV) system, with five-seat constituencies.

In the U.S. state of New Jersey, US 30 runs from the Benjamin Franklin Bridge at the Delaware River in Camden, Camden County while concurrent with Interstate 676 (I-676) southeast to Virginia Avenue in Atlantic City, Atlantic County. Most of the route in New Jersey is known as the White Horse Pike and is four lanes wide. The road runs through mostly developed areas in Camden County, with surroundings becoming more rural as the road approaches Atlantic County. US 30 runs through several towns including Collingswood, Berlin, Hammonton, Egg Harbor City, and Absecon. Most of US 30 in New Jersey follows the White Horse Pike, a turnpike chartered in 1854 to run from Camden to Stratford and eventually toward Atlantic City. In 1917, pre-1927 Route 3 was legislated to run from Camden to Absecon on the White Horse Pike, while US 30 was designated in New Jersey in 1926 to connect Camden and Atlantic City via the White Horse Pike. A year later, pre-1927 Route 3 was replaced by Route 43, which ran between US 130 near Camden and US 9 (now Route 157) in Absecon, and Route 25 was designated along the portion of US 30 between the Ben Franklin Bridge and US 130\\\\. The segment of US 30 past Route 43 into Atlantic City became Route 56 in 1938. In 1953, the state highway designations were removed from US 30\\\\. A freeway was proposed for US 30 in Camden County during the late 1960s, running from Camden to Berlin; however, it was never built.  Route description = Camden County  US 30 crosses the Delaware River into New Jersey on the Ben Franklin Bridge from Philadelphia along with I-676 and the PATCO Speedline. The road continues east into the downtown area of Camden in Camden County as a seven-lane freeway maintained by the Delaware River Port Authority that passes to the north of the former site of Campbell's Field, a former baseball stadium, and comes to the westbound toll plaza for the bridge. Past the toll plaza, US 30 splits from I-676 at an interchange and heads southeast on the six-lane, divided Admiral Wilson Boulevard maintained by the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) and named for Henry Braid Wilson. This portion, formerly known as Bridge Approach Boulevard, is an early example of a roadway designed for the automobile, and was home to the first drive-in movie theatre. Along Admiral Wilson Boulevard, the route passes under a railroad line carrying Conrail Shared Assets Operations' Vineland Secondary and NJ Transit's River Line and interchanges with CR 537 before widening to eight lanes and crossing the Cooper River. The road runs east through urbanized sections of Camden along the north bank of the Cooper River, interchanging with CR 608\\\\. After this interchange, US 30 enters suburban Pennsauken Township and comes to the Airport Circle, which has been modified to include ramps. Here, US 30 meets US 130 and the western terminus of Route 38 and turns south to form a concurrency with US 130 on Crescent Boulevard, a six-lane divided highway that narrows to four lanes. The road crosses the Cooper River into Collingswood, running to the east of Harleigh Cemetery before interchanging with CR 561 and passing under the PATCO Speedline. US 30 westbound on the Admiral Wilson Boulevard at the interchange with Linden Street in Camden At the former Collingswood Circle, US 30 splits from US 130 by heading south-southeast on two-lane, undivided White Horse Pike. The road passes homes and some businesses before crossing the Newton Creek into Oaklyn, where it passes suburban residential and commercial development. US 30 forms the border between Oaklyn to the west and Haddon Township to the east before heading into Audubon. At the border of Audubon and Haddon Heights, the route crosses CR 551 Spur. In this town, the White Horse Pike reaches an intersection with Route 41 at a modified traffic circle and an interchange with I-295 within a close distance of each other in Barrington. At this point, the route is four lanes wide, with a short divided portion immediately south of I-295. US 30 westbound past CR 669 in Magnolia US 30 continues into Lawnside, becoming a four-lane undivided road. It passes under the New Jersey Turnpike, but there is no interchange present between the two roads. Past here, the road enters Magnolia, where it crosses CR 544\\\\. Following this intersection, the route heads through Somerdale before turning more southeast and forming the border between Stratford to the southwest and Somerdale to the northeast. US 30 entirely enters Stratford as it intersects CR 673 and passes near the Lindenwold Station, which is a stop on NJ Transit‚Äôs Atlantic City Line and the terminus of the PATCO Speedline. The White Horse Pike turns back to the south- southeast and forms the border between Laurel Springs to the west and Lindenwold to the east before continuing fully into Lindenwold. The route later turns southeast and enters Clementon. After a turn to the east, US 30 runs along the border of Lindenwold to the north and Clementon to the south and fully enters Lindenwold again prior to the border with Berlin. In Berlin, the White Horse Pike becomes concurrent with CR 534 and then CR 561 a short distance later. US 30 turns to the south-southeast and passes through the downtown area of Berlin as a two-lane road. Past the downtown area, CR 534 and CR 561 split from US 30 at the same intersection, with CR 534 heading east on Jackson Road and CR 561 heading southeast on Tansboro Road, and US 30 widens back to four lanes. The White Horse Pike encounters Route 73 and CR 536 Spur at a cloverleaf interchange. Following the interchange, US 30 enters Waterford Township, as it passes near the community of Atco. The road turns south as it passes Atco Lake and continues into more wooded areas with some development, eventually heading south-southeast again. NJ Transit‚Äôs Atlantic City Line runs a short distance to the northeast of the route at this point. US 30 continues through Chesilhurst before it enters Winslow Township. Here, the route intersects CR 536 and forms a short concurrency with that route before it heads to the east. From this point, the road continues into a mix of woodland, farmland, and development. US 30 intersects Route 143 and passes over the Atlantic City Line as it turns southeast. The road makes another turn to the south as it crosses CR 723.  Atlantic County  US 30 westbound past CR 623 in Mullica TownshipUS 30 heads southeast into Hammonton, Atlantic County, continuing through rural areas with increasing development. The road comes to its intersection with the southern terminus US 206 and the northern terminus of Route 54. A short distance later, the route has a concurrency with CR 542 that begins adjacent to the former Atlanticare - Kessler Memorial Hospital that closed in 2009 and passes by Hammonton Lake. US 30 turns south-southwest past the CR 542 concurrency before heading south. The route crosses CR 561 and turns southeast again, entering Mullica Township. Here, the White Horse Pike enters more forested areas with a few buildings, running a short distance to the northeast of the Atlantic City Line. Past the intersection with CR 623 in the developed community of Elwood, US 30 becomes a divided highway with grass median and jughandles. This configuration continues until Egg Harbor City, when the median ends. In Egg Harbor City, US 30 passes a mix of homes and businesses, intersecting Route 50 and CR 563 in the center of town. At this point, CR 563 forms a concurrency with US 30 and the two routes continue through more of the town before crossing into Galloway Township at the intersection with CR 674. The road passes through rural areas with some development, reaching the community of Cologne. In this area, there is a crossroads with CR 614 before CR 563 splits from US 30 by turning south onto Tilton Road. Past Cologne, the road reaches a junction with CR 575 in the developed community of Pomona. US 30 westbound just west of the eastern terminus in Atlantic City Following this intersection, US 30 continues southeast past wooded residential neighborhoods to the northeast, becoming a divided highway again. The route comes to a partial interchange with the Garden State Parkway, with access to and from the northbound direction of the parkway. Past this interchange, the road heads through commercial areas and continues into Absecon. In Absecon, the White Horse Pike widens to six lanes and crosses CR 651 before intersecting US 9. After passing near the Absecon Station, US 30 crosses Shore Road, which heads north as Route 157 and south as CR 585\\\\. The road turns south, narrowing back to four lanes before entering marshland to the west of Absecon Bay. There is a northbound exit and southbound entrance to CR 646 before US 30 crosses the Jonathans Thorofare into Atlantic City, where the name becomes Absecon Boulevard as it turns to the east. Absecon Boulevard crosses Newfound Thorofare before heading south and passing over Duck Thorofare. The road passes by the Jersey-Atlantic Wind Farm and heads southeast across Beach Thorofare. At this point, US 30 widens to six lanes and passes to the north of residential neighborhoods, with maintenance of the road switching from the New Jersey Department of Transportation to the South Jersey Transportation Authority. After crossing the Penrose Canal, the route passes over the tunnel carrying the Atlantic City‚ÄìBrigantine Connector and intersects the southern terminus of Route 87, where there is a ramp to the northbound Atlantic City‚ÄìBrigantine Connector. The road passes areas of development and intersects an access road to the southbound Atlantic City‚ÄìBrigantine Connector as well as Route 187. Two blocks later, US 30 ends at the intersection with Virginia Avenue.  History  US 30 followed the course of an old Lenape trail running from what is now Camden to the Absegami lands, in what is now Abescon.Snyder, John (1969). \\"The Story of New Jersey's Civil Boundaries 1606-1968\\" This later became the White Horse Road. The White Horse Turnpike Company was incorporated January 27, 1854 with the authority to convert White Horse Road into a turnpike, running from Camden to Stratford and eventually to Atlantic City. By 1913, maintenance of the White Horse Pike became public, and the road was incorporated into an auto trail, signed as the White Horse Trail.Rand McNally and Co. \\"Eastern Ohio, Western Pennsylvania, South East Michigan, Southern Ontario, Western New York: District No. 4\\".

The route of US 30 today in New Jersey was designated as pre-1927 Route 3 from 1916 to 1927 between Camden and Absecon. On October 30, 1925, plans were made for a cross-country route from Salt Lake City, Utah to Atlantic City, New Jersey as part of the U.S. Highway System. This road was designated U.S. Route 30 in 1926. Usage Note: Access the full resolution version of the image and focus on Salt Lake City, Utah where the western end of Route 30 can be seen It entered New Jersey from Pennsylvania in Camden and followed the entire length of pre-1927 Route 3 to Absecon before continuing into Atlantic City. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 43 replaced the Route 3 designation along US 30 between US 130 and US 9 (now Route 157) in Absecon while Route 25 was designated along with US 30 between the Ben Franklin Bridge and US 130. In 1938, the portion of US 30 from the terminus of Route 43 in Absecon into Atlantic City was designated as Route 56. Prior to the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, spur routes of Route 43 and Route 56 were planned. Route S43 was planned in 1938 to be a route running from Route 43 in Germania to Route 4 in Northfield; this was never built as a state highway but the alignment is now followed by CR 563. Route S56 was legislated in 1945 to be a spur of Route 56 to Brigantine along what had also been legislated as Route S4A; this road became Route 87 in 1953. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, which eliminated several concurrencies between U.S. and state routes, the designations of routes 25, 43, and 56 were removed from US 30. Prior to the completion of I-676 across the Ben Franklin Bridge in the 1970s, US 30 used Penn Street eastbound and Linden Street westbound to travel between the bridge and Admiral Wilson Boulevard. In the late 1960s, a freeway was proposed for US 30 in Camden County by the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission. The freeway, which was to cost $40 million, was to run from the Ben Franklin Bridge to I-295 in Barrington with a $16 million extension to the planned Route 90 freeway in Berlin. The segment between Camden and Barrington was to be complete by 1975 while the extension to Berlin was to be finished by 1985. However, the NJDOT did not build this US 30 freeway. Note: Copy available at Temple University Library In 2009, the Collingswood Circle at the eastern end of the US 130 concurrency was replaced with an at-grade intersection with jughandles.

The book is divided in three parts: * The Red Horse, * The Pale Horse, and * The Tree of Life. The book is a metaphor for the genesis of the new democratic Italy that arose out of the ashes of the chaos of pre-fascist, fascist and war-torn Italy. The new Italy is governed by division and loss of conservative Christian values and the question is posed by Michele Tintori if the chaos is a result of this loss. It was translated into English and published by Ignatius Press in 2002. Main characters * Manno Riva, an officer in the new Italian army that fight along the Allied armies in occupied Italy; * Ambrogio Riva, officer of the Italian army, son of an industrialist; * Michele Tintori, officer of the Italian army, writer and Christian Democratic activist; Commentary The novel begins in late Spring 1940 in the town of Nomana (a literary depiction of Corti's hometown Besana in Brianza) where the inhabitants live on agriculture, farming, or work in the textile mill owned by the local industrialist Gerardo Riva, Ambrogio's father. In the afternoon of 10 June, the workers gather in the town square to hear Mussolini's declaration of war over the loudspeakers. However, they receive the news with no enthusiasm: fascism has very few supporters in Nomana, where most people sympathized for the Italian People's Party of which Gerardo used to lead the local branch. Moreover, all the inhabitants are staunch Catholics, and their everyday life is shaped by devotion. As war progresses, young men are sent off to several fronts: North Africa, Russia, Albania. Michele Tintori is captured by Soviet troops and interned in several Gulags, but survives. After the breakup of 8 September 1943 Manno enlists in the Italian Co-Belligerent Army, and others join the partisans, but see a gap digging between themselves and some fellow combatants as the resort to revenge becomes more widespread in the Italian Resistance, in contrast with their Christian beliefs. Michele Tintori's experiences in Russia have convinced him that totalitarianism is hell on Earth; especially communism is an even greater threat to the Christian order than fascism had been. He thinks the only path out of the inhumanity of the war and post-war chaos is the Christian-Democratic order, which pillars are the Roman Catholic Church and the industrialist elite. The communist, socialist and liberal forces do not see the threat of their progressive ideas because they are ignorant about the evils of un-Christian powers. The danger of a communist-socialist takeover, which would include Italy into the other side of the Iron Curtain, is avoided by the Democrazia Cristiana led by Alcide De Gasperi winning the elections of 18 April 1948. However, in the eyes of Michele Tintori, that same party betrays its founding Christian values by seeking an appeasement with their counterpart, and allowing members of the Communist and Socialist party into key places in education, mass media and culture, thus opening the door to the leftist cultural hegemony and speeding the secularization of Italy. When, in 1974, the referendum for the abrogation of divorce fails, Tintori understands he has been left alone in his battle for Christian values and that Christians are now a minority in Italian society. The Red Horse is an epic story about the genesis of new Italy, with many affinities to Alessandro Manzoni's novel The Betrothed. Similarly to Manzoni, Corti mixes fictional individual stories with actual history, going as far as inserting real characters in the plot: for example Father Carlo Gnocchi, Nilde Iotti, Agostino Gemelli, Corti's brother Piero (partly recognizable in Pino Riva). Manno Riva is based on Sottotenente Giuseppe Cederle (a recipient of the Gold Medal of Military Valor) whereas details from the author's own life are incorporated in both Michele Tintori and Ambrogio Riva. Corti writes his novel with a world view, which he borrows from Saint Augustine's book De Civitate Dei: man can build the city of God if he decides to rely on divine principles as a foundation for society. When, instead, man leaves God out of the picture he ends up building the city of the Devil.Eugenio Corti interview by Roberto Persico, 19 April 2007 References Category:1983 novels Category:20th-century Italian novels Category:Family saga novels Category:Novels set in Italy ","title":"The Red Horse"},{"id":"13382072","text":"The Trap may refer to:  Film  * The Trap (1913 film), a lost silent film starring Lon Chaney * The Trap (1914 film), a dramatic short starring Harry von Meter * The Trap (1918 film), an American drama film starring Alice Brady * The Trap (1919 film), an American drama film starring Olive Tell * The Trap (1922 film), an American silent Western starring Lon Chaney * The Trap (1946 film), a Charlie Chan film starring Sidney Toler * The Trap (1949 film), an Argentine film directed by Carlos Hugo Christensen * The Trap (1950 film), a Czech drama directed by Martin Friƒç * The Trap (1959 film), a crime drama directed by Norman Panama * The Trap (1966 film), an adventure/romance starring Oliver Reed and Rita Tushingham * The Trap (1985 film), an Italian erotic thriller starring Tony Musante and Laura Antonelli * The Trap (2007 film) or Klopka, a Serbian film * The Trap, a 2007 short film starring Jeanne Tripplehorn and Camilla Belle * The Trap, a 2017 short film in competition at the 67th Berlin International Film Festival * The Trap (2019 film), a film starring Mike Epps and T.I.

Elmer Crowell (1862‚Äì1952) was a master decoy carver from East Harwich, Massachusetts. Crowell specialized in shorebirds, waterfowl, and miniatures. Crowell's decoys are consistently regarded as the finest and most desirable decoys ever made.  Life  Crowell's father, Anthony S. Crowell, was a mariner and cranberry grower who may not have even cared much for hunting. Despite this, he bought Elmer his first gun in 1874, when the boy was 12. The land around their East Harwich, Massachusetts, home was rich in game and waterfowl, the numerous ponds and bays were a haven for sportsmen and market gunners from all over. Anthony Crowell owned property on Pleasant Lake near where the Crowells lived and Elmer built a gunning stand there in 1876. The stand stayed for many years while Elmer shot ducks, geese, and on occasion, shorebirds. Despite this early interest in hunting, Crowell long favored live decoys to the block variety, perhaps proving that his career in carving block decoys didn't start until later on. In 1947, Crowell related in his article, \\"Cape Cod Memories,\\" that, \\"The shooting was great. But we could not sell them in the markets, as the law cut it out. Soon the law cut out the live decoys, and that was the end of good shooting there.\\"Cullity, Brian, and Gigi Hopkins. The Songless Aviary: The World of A. E. Crowell & Son. [Sandwich, Massachusetts]: Heritage Plantation of Sandwich, 1992. Print. Crowell certainly didn't begin making decoys to support himself until later in life. By the late 1920s, Crowell's decoys were being churned out at a prodigious rate, and the quality suffered. For this reason, decoys of his from this period are slightly less desirable than those made earlier. The decoy, as a form, implies both sculpture and function, and Crowell approached their creation as an artist. As George Hepplewhite wrote in the 18th century, the interpretation and execution of the decoys, \\"blend the useful with the agreeable.\\"The Harry V. Long Collection of A. Elmer Crowell Decoys: The Sporting Sale 2009. Boston: Copley Fine Art Auctions, 2009. 12-13. Print., In particular, two of Crowell's decoys have repeatedly set world records for sales. Crowell's preening pintail drake and Canada goose decoys share the world record at $1.13 million dollars. Their private sales were orchestrated by Stephen O'Brien Jr. as part of what remains the largest decoy sale ever, with over 30 birds changing hands for approximately $7.5 million. Crowell's barn/workshop was restored and moved to the grounds near the Harwich Historical Society. It is open to the public as a museum, commemorating his life and work.

Grimsby Town On 11 November 2008, Buscher was handed a trial by English club Grimsby Town with a view to a permanent move. He signed a contract with the club on 2 December joining fellow Frenchman Jean- Louis Akpa Akpro at the club until the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season. However Buscher's time at Grimsby was not a memorable one, as he failed to make a single appearance for the club's first team, as well as this, Bushcer also failed to make even the substitute bench. His only appearances for Grimsby came in the club's reserve team, managed by Stuart Watkiss. Manager Mike Newell commented saying that he had made a mistake when signing Buscher, and this was the reason that the player was never used in his 7-month stay at Blundell Parkhttp://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:3_4YRpxZyfoJ:www.oleole.com/news/show/id/10210+grimsby+buscher+a+mistake&cd;=1&hl;=en&ct;=clnk‚â∑=uk&client;=firefox-a On 5 May 2009, Buscher's contract was cancelled ahead of schedule by mutual consent. Later career Buscher signed for Tunisian side CS Hammam-Lif for the 2009‚Äì2010 season and then in 2010 he joined fellow Tunisian outfit CA Bizertin. He has since played for Nice B, AS Marsa, Canterbury United and currently RC Grasse.

Life and work Thomas Cotes became a \\"freeman\\" (a full member) of the Stationers Company on 6 January 1606; he was a former apprentice of William Jaggard, who would print the First Folio with his son Isaac. Cotes ran his own printing shop from 1620 to 1641; from 1635 on, he was in partnership with his brother Richard Cotes (died 1653). Their shop was in the Barbican in Aldersgate Street. (Their sister Jane was married to another printer, Robert Ibbitson.) On 19 June 1627, Thomas Cotes acquired the business and copyrights of Isaac Jaggard, son and heir of William Jaggard, from Jaggard's widow Dorothy.Henry Robert Plomer, A Dictionary of the Booksellers and Printers Who Were at Work in England, Scotland and Ireland from 1641 to 1667, London, The Bibliographical Society/Blades, East & Blades, 1907; p. 53. A royal decree of 1637 named Thomas Cotes one of the twenty Master Printers of the Stationers Company.Henry Robert Plomer, A Short History of English Printing, 1476-1898, London, Kegan Paul, 1900; pp. 178-9. Drama In his substantial career, Cotes was a major producer of play texts of English Renaissance drama. He printed the first quarto of The Two Noble Kinsmen (1634) for publisher John Waterson, and the second edition of Fletcher's The Faithful Shepherdess (1629) for Richard Meighen, who was one of the partners in the Second Folio syndicate. He printed more than a dozen plays for Andrew Crooke and William Cooke, including many by James Shirley; he printed Pathomachia for Francis Constable. His quartos of Pericles, Prince of Tyre (1635) and The Bloody Banquet (1639) were rare instances in which Cotes functioned as both publisher and printer. In an age when the two functions were often separate, Cotes largely confined himself to printing, and left publishing to booksellers like Meighen, Crooke and Cooke, and others. Other works Cotes worked on poetry, printing John Taylor the Water Poet's Wit and Mirth (1629) for James Boler, and James Day's A New Spring of Divine Poetry and Thomas Jordan's Poetical Varieties (both 1637), both for Humphrey Blunden. Most notably in this area, Cotes printed John Benson's important 1640 edition of Shakespeare's Poems. Cotes produced books on heraldry; religious and polemical works, by William Prynne, Hugh Latimer, and others; and a large share of ephemera and now-forgotten items -- like The Book of Merry Riddles (1629), Wine, Beer, Ale and Tobacco (1630), and Robin Goodfellow, His Mad Pranks and Merry Jests (1640).George Watson Cole and Philip Sanford Goulding, Check-List or Brief Catalogue of the Library of Henry E. Huntington, New York (privately printed), 1919. Later years During his later years, Thomas Cotes served as the clerk of his London parish, St. Giles without Cripplegate; as such, he was a member of their guild, the Parish Clerks' Company. That guild maintained its own printing press, for issuing bills of mortality. (The Stuart regime was serious about security and censorship: the parish clerks' printing press was kept in a triple-locked room.) Thomas Cotes served as the clerks' printer from 1636 until his death in 1641. Thereafter the clerks' printing was done by brother Richard Cotes, who in turn was followed by Ellen or Ellinor Cotes, Richard's widow.Peter Hampson Ditchfield, The Parish Clerk, London, Methuen, 1907; pp. 115-26. Thomas Cotes was survived by two sons, James and Thomas. The exact date of his death is not recorded; he was buried on 15 July 1641. His last will and testament was signed on 22 June 1641 and probated on 19 July the same year. His will assigned full rights to their business to brother Richard, the surviving partner, in return for a payment of ¬£100.

The state government building TSFC, and the President Plaza (home of best web designer) Badeshah palace are located here. A variety of businesses are located here, unlike most markets which are known for specializing in a certain trade. This area's importance has increased because of its close proximity to Nampally Railway Station. It is surrounded by Basheerbagh to the north, Nampally to the east via Chapel Road, Koti to the west, and Chaderghat to the south, via the Bank Street. It falls under Nampally constituency. History Abids Departmental store in 1897 Abids Circle circa 1934The St. George's Grammar School (established in 1834), and adjoining St. George's Church (established in 1844) predate the area's naming. This area had a shop known as Abid's belonging to an Armenian merchant known as Albert Abid, a valet of Nizam VI of Hyderabad state, hence the area came to be known as Abids. Albert Abid left for England, but as per another version the area got its name after a shop run by Abid Evans. In 1939, the store was demolished and a cinema known as \\"Palace Talkies\\" was built in its place. Later in the 1980s this theater was also demolished and a new structure built in its place. Now this space is occupied by Big Bazaar. In 1942, the headquarters of the State Bank of Hyderabad were established here. The Taj Mahal Hotel was built here in the 1950s. Commerce Today the whole area is one of the main shopping centres in the city and the main street is known as Abids Road. The General Post Office or GPO headquarters is located in this area. The major businesses are hotels and shops for textiles, clothing, jewelry, footwear, and electronics. BSNL, the largest telecommunications provider in the city, has its headquarters located here. The GHMC office is also located here, situated adjacent to the GPO. The famous Jagdish market, a bustling grey market for mobiles and electronics, is also located here. The area is a major business hub and has many restaurants for travellers. Palace Heights, the Taj Mahal Hotel and Grand Hotel are the best restaurants in Abids. Culture Some famous temples are located here especially on the Nampally and Abids road, such as the Hanuman Temple and ISKCON which are considered to be heritage sites.

Webb's lab at Cornell University, in 1989. Early Life and Education Denk was born in Munich, Germany. As a child he spent most of his playtime learning to use the tools and building materials in his father's workshop. In school it became apparent that Denk‚Äôs ‚Äòtalents were unevenly spread across subjects, math and physics being favored‚Äô. Fixing and constructing electronic devices was his main hobby throughout high school. After high school, Denk completed the mandatory 15-month stint in the German army and spent the next 3 years at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. In 1981 he moved to Zurich to study at the ETH. During this time, he also worked in the lab of Dieter Pohl, at the IBM laboratory. There he built one of the first super-resolution microscopes and developed a passion for scanning microscopy. He did his Master‚Äôs thesis in the lab of Kurt W√ºthrich, under the direct guidance of Gerhard Wagner. But he felt that NMR spectroscopy was not for him because it did not involve enough opportunities to create new experimental gadgets. In 1984 Denk joined the lab of Watt W. Webb at Cornell. While Webb himself was extremely interested in methods ‚Äì both fluorescence-correlation and photo bleaching-recovery spectroscopy had been invented in his lab ‚Äì he gave students and postdocs a lot of freedom. Denk enjoyed his time at Cornell but was almost fired after he went to Greece for six months to study monk seals. Given a second chance, he started a project aimed at measuring the motion of sensory hair-bundles in the inner ear. One of the attractions of this endeavor was that it required a stay in San Francisco, in order to learn from Jim Hudspeth and his group about hair-cells in general and specifically how to prepare them for the planned measurements. Denk returned to Cornell and invented a method sensitive enough to measure the thermal movement of hair-bundles. He went on to show that hair cells can sense their own Brownian motion. Central to Denk's early career was his intuition that two-photon (2p) imaging might damage the sample less than one-photon confocal imaging. He predicted this in spite of the fact that peak light intensity for 2p is almost one million times higher than for the confocal microscope. Equally important was his insight that infrared 2p excitation would allow scattered fluorescence to contribute to images even deep in turbid samples, improving the optical access and resolution of 2p imaging over what was possible using confocal imaging. Nowhere has this proven more valuable than when imaging neurons in living brain tissue. Two-photon microscopy remains the only technique that allows the recording of activity in living brains with high spatial resolution. 2p excitation can also be used to map cells' receptor distributions by releasing substances from their chemical \\"cages\\". Denk later demonstrated that 2p can be utilized to record activity in the visually stimulated retina. He also showed that it can be combined with adaptive optics to improve resolution, and with amplified pulses to push the depth limit to 1mm in brain tissue. Today, two-photon excitation microscopy is also used in the fields of physiology, embryology and tissue engineering, as well as in cancer research. The sparsity of data on connectivity between neurons had been a major limitation in circuit neuroscience. Denk‚Äôs 2004 paper describing automated serial blockface microscopy rekindled the dormant science of comprehensive neural circuit mapping (connectomics), pioneered by Sydney Brenner. Denk, now Director at the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology, continues working to improve techniques for circuit-mapping in the rodent brain. His most recent work involves precisely determining the positions, orientations, and identities of proteins and bound ligands in cryo-preserved cells.

The College sets and upholds standards for best practice provision of rural and remote medical care. It provides training and certification, and professional development for rural general practice. It also provides advocacy and support for current and prospective rural doctors. The College has been part of an international movement to promote the concept of Rural Generalist Medicine as an important model of medical practice to support quality health services in rural and remote communities. The College is a signatory to the Cairns Consensus Statement of Rural Generalist Medicine endorsed by 23 national and international medical organisations. ACRRM has a current national membership of around 4,500 including fellows, registrars, practitioners, junior doctors and students. Training for ACRRM Fellowship The College provides training and assessment pathways to the award of Fellowship of ACRRM (FACRRM). In all pathways, training is based on the ACRRM curricula and standards, and trainees must successfully complete the ACRRM assessment program which is delivered by the College. Professional Development Program ACRRM's Professional Development Program provides a framework for undertaking continuing professional development and maintenance of professional standards for unsupervised general practice in accordance with national regulatory authorities. The program is Australian Medical Council (AMC) accredited and designed to accommodate the distinct professional requirements of general practice in the rural and remote context. In particular it requires maintenance of advanced emergency care skills. History ACRRM was incorporated in March 1997 with 600 members. In 1998 the College published the first edition of its ACRRM Primary Curriculum. the curriculum is in its 4th edition. In 2002 the College's Professional Development Program (PDP) was formally recognized by the federal government as a mechanism for maintenance of Vocational Recognition (VR) for general practitioners in Australia. ACRRM received initial accreditation from the Australian Medical Council (AMC) in February 2007, and was included in the Australian Medicare legislation in April 2007. Full accreditation was achieved in October 2011. The College's AMC accreditation status has been upheld since that time. Status and recognition within Australian regulatory framework=College Fellowship status within Legislation and Regulations governing Medicare Ratified Fellows of the ACRRM can attain vocational recognition as a general practitioner. This means that they can be recognised as a general practitioner in Australia and through this can become eligible to deliver services that attract a Medicare rebate. This eligibility was achieved in 2007 through a change to the Health Insurance Regulations (1975), gazetted underneath the Health Insurance Act (1973). These two documents define the conditions for vocational recognition of General Practitioners and provide three pathways to attaining this: # Section 3EA of The Health Insurance Act 1973 allows doctors to gain a 'determination' as a General Practitioner if they are General Practitioners if they are Fellows of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. # Section 3F of The Health Insurance act 1973 allows doctors to gain a determination as a General Practitioner if they meet the requirements set out by Medicare Australia. This is the Vocational Register. This list is held by the CEO of Medicare Australia. # The third pathway relevant to Fellows of ACRRM is held in Section 6DA of The Health Insurance Regulations 1975. This section allows doctors to seek a determination that they are a General Practitioner if they 'meet ACRRM fellowship standards'. This regulation was added in April 2007 by the authority of the Governor General. Accreditation by the Australian Medical Council The College initially sought recognition of Rural and Remote Medicine as a unique medical specialty in Australia through the then newly established Australian Medical Council (AMC) new specialty assessment process. This application was hotly debated with the AMC receiving 326 submissions for its deliberations. The application met resistance from some of the established medical groups and was rejected by the then Minister for Health and Ageing, Hon Tony Abbott MP and the AMC Review Group proposed an alternative way forward for the process. They considered that \\"applying a broad definition of general practice, the practice of rural and remote medicine is largely general practice.\\"pg 72 Additional comments said that \\"there is as yet no other instance in Australia of two organisations defining the standards of medical practice and the standards for training and assessment in one medical specialty.....the AMC had agreed this should be possible.\\" In light of these comments, on 22 December 2005 Minister Abbott released funding to the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine to further develop its rural doctor vocational training programs for assessment and accreditation within the specialty of 'general practice'. The College and its educational programs were subsequently assessed by the AMC and ACRRM and was granted initial accreditation as a standards body and provider of specific training and professional development program for the specialty of general practice in 2007. This decision included accreditation of training leading to Fellowship of ACRRM and of the ACRRM Professional Development Program. The AMC awarded the College Full accreditation as a provider of specialist medical training in general practice in 2011. Full accreditation status has been maintained since that time. ACRRM became the first Australian medical college to be recognized, fully assessed and accredited under the newly established and substantively more rigorous AMC accreditation framework.

It is owned by the Indian company Nirma. It has major operations in the Searles Valley and in Trona, California where it is the town's largest employer. The company produces borax, boric acid, soda ash, salt cake, and salt. It also owns the Trona Railway. The Trona facility extracts and ships 1.75 million tons of chemicals per year. History The mining, production, and assets of the present day Searles Valley Minerals Inc. have a long and varied history. When John Searles arrived in the area in the 1860s, he was looking for gold and silver to mine. Instead he found a white crystalline powder, borax, in the dry Searles Lake bed. Searles Valley Historical Society.org: Searles Valley History Timeline In 1873, he went into production as the San Bernardino Borax Mining Company to mine borax. Long mule teams were used to haul borax in wagons to San Pedro, until the much closer settlement of Mojave was used after the Southern Pacific Railroad reached it in 1876. In 1895 The San Bernardino Borax Mining Company was sold by Searles to the Pacific Coast Borax Company, owned by Francis \\"Borax King\\" Smith. He shut down production at the company's section of Searles Lake the next year. San Bernardino Sun: \\"Tiny desert community of Trona hopes to rise from the ashes\\", by Beau Yarbrough, 24 October 2015. American Trona Company The American Trona Company was founded in 1913 by the British-owned Consolidated Gold Fields of South Africa company. In 1914 the company completed the Trona Railway line from Searles Station south to a junction with the Southern Pacific Railroad. Also in 1914, the American Trona Corporation established the company-owned town of Trona, named for crystals of soda ash formed by the evaporation of chemical-rich water commonly found in the lake bed. The production of potash began in 1915. In 1917, construction was completed on the American Trona Corporation Building in San Pedro, to process and store salt potash. In 1926, after becoming the American Potash & Chemical Corporation, it began producing borax, soda ash, and sodium sulfate. Productions of these chemicals continued to expand until the 1980s. Post-WW II After World War II, American Potash had labor relations problems due to allegations that Latino workers were paid lower wages than White workers. Later, Latino workers were promoted to managerial positions also. In 1962 the company received nationwide recognition and an award for its innovative solvent extraction process to recover boric acid and potassium sulfate from weak brines. In 1974 American Potash and Chemical was acquired by Kerr-McGee. However they didn‚Äôt want to own the company town and sold it. They cut production in half in 1982 and instituted massive layoffs. Kerr-McGee sold the Searles Valley production facilities in 1990, to capital investors D. George Harris and Associates, which formed the North American Chemical Company. Ownership changed again in 1998 when IMC Global corporation acquired North American Chemical Company. 21st century In 2004 when Sun Capital, LLC purchased IMC Global corporation, the North American Chemical Company facilities at Trona and Westend were renamed Searles Valley Minerals, Inc. In November 2007, Karnavati Holdings, a subsidiary of the Indian corporation Nirma Limited based in Ahmedabad (India), purchased Searles Valley Minerals corporation from Sun Capital Partners. Searles Valley Minerals Inc. is part of Climate VISION (Voluntary Innovative Sector Initiatives: Opportunities Now), a public/private partnership which is seeking to reduce US industry greenhouse gas emissions by 18 percent between 2002 and 2012. As it operates on government owned land, Searles Valley Minerals Inc. pays royalties of millions of dollars each year to both the federal and state governments. Much of those royalties cover the expenses of local school districts. Argus Cogeneration Plant The Argus Cogeneration Plant of Searles Valley Minerals. The Argus Cogeneration Plant is a coal-fired power station located adjacent to the mineral processing plant in Trona, California. The power station has nameplate capacity of 63 MW and produced 296 GWh of electricity in 2018. It is the last coal-fired power station still operating in California. Unit 1 was commissioned in 1978 and has a nameplate capacity of 63 MW. Unit 2 was commissioned in January 1991 and had a nameplate capacity of 103 MW before being decommissioned on October 2, 2014. The power station is located at the coordinates . Environmental Problems The California Department of Fish and Game (DFG) has noted that salt toxicosis has killed over 4,000 birds in brine ponds produced by the Trona plant. The DFG made an agreement with the company in 2005 to allow a certain number of bird deaths, if the company paid $300,000 for a new wetlands area in the southern Owens Valley on a main migratory bird route. There are allegations of arsenic poisoning of plant workers. SVM argued in a to the State Water Resources Control Board, that concentration of total dissolved solids, chlorides, sodium and other minerals are higher in natural ephemeral pools than in the company's depleted brine ponds.letter The Searles Lake brine is rich in arsenic, and a unique anaerobic, extremely haloalkaliphilic bacterium which uses arsenic for respiration has been isolated from the mud.Oremland, R., et al., \\"A Microbial Arsenic Cycle in a Salt-Saturated, Extreme Environment\\", Science, Vol. 308. no. 5726, pp. 1305 - 1308, 27 May 2005..

History The second ship to be named Gull by the Navy, AMS-16 was launched as YMS-324 by the Al Larson Boat Shop, Terminal Island, California, 14 October 1943; sponsored by Mrs. William Toman; and commissioned 28 February 1944, Lt. H. B. Silveira, USNR, in command. After shakedown and minesweeping training, YMS-324 sailed from San Pedro, California, 20 June 1944 via Pearl Harbor and reached Guadalcanal 1 August to prepare for the coming invasion of Peleliu. She put in at Peleliu and swept her first enemy mine 14 September, the day before the famous 1st Marine Division stormed ashore, and for the next month continued minesweeping operations there and at Ulithi. Sailing from Ulithi 14 October for the attack on the Ngulu Islands, the ship swept mines under enemy fire without damage or casualties and subsequently continued her duties at Ulithi until departing 19 March 1945 for Okinawa. YMS-324 aided in clearing the approaches to Okinawa, and remained in those waters until the fall of 1945, returning to San Pedro, California, 20 September 1945, 15 months to the day from the time she left. minesweeping operations on 15 June 1951 in support of commando raid by British Royal Marines on Chinnampo, North Korea, during the Korean War.

Gull remained off Chinnampo for more than a month and through her untiring efforts the approaches to that port were cleared, allowing an evacuation accomplished without loss of life. For this hazardous duty Gull was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation. On 1 August 1954 Gull was redesignated AMCU-46 and underwent conversion at Yokosuka, Japan. Redesignated again as MHC-46 on 7 February 1955, she returned to Long Beach, California, in May, 1955, and subsequently conducted peacetime training duty out of southern California ports until 14 January 1958. Decommissioned at San Diego, California, that date, she was disposed of in March 1959.

Alongside the Toldi trilogy it is one of his most important works. Background Arany was asked to write a poem of praise for the visit of Franz Joseph I of Austria, as were other Hungarian poets. Arany instead wrote about the tale of the 500 Welsh bards sent to the stake by Edward I of England for failing to sing his praises at a banquet in Montgomery Castle. The poem was intended by analogy to criticise the tight Habsburg rule over Hungary since the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. It was a form of passive resistance to the repressive policies of Alexander von Bach in Hungary, and to the planned visit of the monarch himself.\\"The Bard of Wales\\" in the Hungarian Electronic Library Retrieved 11 August 2019. The poem John Martin (1789-1854), . The poem was written \\"for the desk drawer\\" and first published six years later in 1863, disguised as a translation of an Old English ballad, as a way of evading the censorship that would cease only with the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867. Arany wrote in his preface to the poem: The royal form of bardic tradition ended in the 13th century with the 1282 Edwardian conquest. The legendary suicide of The Last Bard (in about 1283) was marked in the poem as encoded resistance to the Habsburg repression of that period. The best-known English translation was done by Canadian scholar Watson Kirkconnell in 1933. In September 2007 an English copy of this poem, translated by Peter Zollman, was donated to the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth. Cultural significance Album cover of The Bards Of Wales by Karl Jenkins (2012) All Hungarian students in the sixth grade of elementary school learn \\"The Bards of Wales\\" by heart, in view of its literary importance and historical message. The poem was set to music by the Hungarian band Kal√°ka in 1989. Dalriada made a different setting in 2003, which was re- recorded and re-released in 2004 and in 2009, on an album with several other settings of Arany poems. The Welsh composer Karl Jenkins wrote a cantata to the Zollman translation of the poem in 2011. In 2012 it was announced that a Hungarian version of the Welsh Gorsedd Circle would be set up in Hungary as a symbol of strengthening relationships between Wales and Hungary and in commemoration of \\"The Bards of Wales\\".

The Sanskrit name for this polity is Kuntala. Chinese records indicate that \\"Sanfotsi was formerly called Kantoli\\" and this as well as the location of the kingdom have led historians to consider Kantoli as the predecessor of Srivijaya. Srivijaya was referred to as Sanfotsi by the Chinese. During the reign of the Liu Song Dynasty, Kantoli sent several embassies to China. Trade between the two kingdoms were established and this granted Kantoli with great wealth through heavy dependency on volume from China. With the conquest of Song by the Sui Dynasty, volume of trade dwindled due to the new ruler's austerity. The emperor banned all luxurious items in the courts which coincidentally were supplied by many, including Kantoli. Sri Varanarendra, king of Kan-t'o-li, sent the Hindu Rudra on an embassy to China between 454 and 464. His son, Vijayavarman, did the same in 519.  Origins  According to S.Sartono (1992), there were difficulties for merchant ships to dock at the port of Muara Tebo as a result of siltation in the bay. As a result, the port could no longer function as an ocean port. Koying State, the ruler of the Wen Bay region, was thus forced to move the trading port to the East Coast of what is now the Kuala Tungkal area. Ultimately, Koying State released the east coast area and encouraged the formation of a new government called Kantoli (Kuntal). This occurred around the 5th century of the common era. Following the formation of Kantoli, the new kingdom maintained good relations with Koying.

First synthesized in 1970, it acts as a modulator of mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptors. Dezocine is a mixed agonist/antagonist of opioid receptors. It is related to other benzomorphans such as pentazocine, with a similar profile of effects that include analgesia and euphoria. Unlike many other benzomorphans however, it is a silent antagonist of the Œ∫-opioid receptor, and in accordance, does not produce side effects such as dysphoria or hallucinations at any dose. History Dezocine was patented by American Home Products Corp. in 1978. Clinical trials ran from 1979-1985, before its approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1986. As of 2011, dezocine's usage is discontinued in the United States. Synthesis Dezocine [(‚àí)-13Œ≤-amino-5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12-octahydro-5Œ±-methyl-5,11-methanobenzocyclodecen-31-ol, hydrobromide] is a pale white crystal powder. It has no apparent odor. The salt is soluble at 20 mg/ml, and a 2% solution has a pH of 4.6. The synthesis of dezocine begins with the condensation of 1-methyl-7-methoxy-2-tetralone with 1,5-dibromopentane through use of NaH or potassium tert.butylate. This yields 1-(5-bromopentyl)-1-methyl-7-methoxy-2-tetralone, which is then cyclized with NaH to produce 5-methyl-3-methoxy-5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12-octahydro-5,11-methanobenzocyclodecen-13-one. The product is then treated with hydroxylamine hydrochloride, to yield an oxime. A reduction reaction in hydrogen gas produces an isomeric mixture, from which the final product is crystallized and cleaved with HBr. Legal status in United States As of 2011, dezocine is not used in the United States or Canada. It is not commercially available in either of these countries, nor is it offered as a prescribed analgesic for postoperative care. In China however, it is commonly used after surgery. Pharmacology=Target action Dezocine has an intramuscular bioavailability of 97%. It has a mean t1/2 Œ± of fewer than two minutes, and its half-life is 2.2 hours. Its binding affinity varies with regards to the receptor type, as it acts as a partial agonist primarily on mu-opioid receptors. At kappa-opioid receptors, it acts as an antagonist. Overall, it has a high efficacy as an analgesic. With regards to its potency, it has a Bmax of 3326 fmol/mg of protein in HEK cells. Dezocine is five times as potent as pethidine and one-fifth as potent as butorphanol. Mechanism of action at the mu opioid receptor Dezocine is unusual among opiates as it is one of the only primary amines known to be an active opioid (along with bisnortilidine, an active metabolite of tilidine). It is a mixed agonist‚Äìantagonist as with other drugs in this class, and despite having a stronger respiratory depressant effect than morphine, dezocine shows a ceiling effect on its respiratory depressive action so above a certain dose this effect does not get any more severe. Dezocine possesses affinities (Ki) of 3.7 nM, 31.9 nM, and 527 nM for the Œº-, Œ∫-, and Œ¥-opioid receptors (MOR, KOR, and DOR), respectively. It is a partial agonist of the MOR and a silent antagonist of the KOR. In addition to its opioid actions, dezocine has been found to act as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), with pIC50 values of 5.86 for the serotonin transporter (SERT) and 5.68 for the norepinephrine transporter (NET). Due to its partial agonist nature at the MOR, dezocine has significantly reduced side effects relative to opioid analgesics acting as full agonists of the MOR such as morphine. Moreover, dezocine is not a controlled substance and there are no reports of addiction related to its use, indicating that, unlike virtually all other clinically-employed MOR agonists (including weak partial agonists like buprenorphine) and for reasons that are not fully clear, it is apparently non-addictive. This unique benefit makes long-term low-dose treatment of chronic pain and/or opioid dependence with dezocine more feasible than with most other opioids. Administration Dezocine is generally administered intravenously. It can also be administered in intramuscular doses, and is given singularly rather than continuously. Dezocine has been found to be an effective painkiller comparable to meperidine (pethidine), and so is a more effective analgesic than pentazocine, but causes relatively more respiratory depression than pentazocine. It is a useful drug for the treatment of pain, but side effects such as dizziness limit its clinical application, and it can produce opioid withdrawal syndrome in patients already dependent on other opioids. Uses=Prescription Dezocine is generally administered intravenously (as Dalgan) to relieve post- operative pain in patients. Because of its high efficacy, it is often administered at a base dose of 0.1 mg/kg. Respiratory depression, a side- effect of dezocine, reaches a ceiling at 0.3-0.4 mg/kg. It has potent analgesic results, and greater pain-relieving ability than morphine, codeine, and pethidine. Side effects Because decozine has mixed agonist/antagonist effects on mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptors, it has a lowered dependence potential than purely agonistic opiates. It can be prescribed, therefore, in small doses over an extended period of time without causing patients to develop and sustain an addiction. Its efficacy as an analgesic is dose-dependent; however, it displays a ceiling effect in induced respiratory depression at 0.3-0.4 mg/kg. Side effects at lower doses include mild gastrointestinal discomfort and dizziness. It is often administered in post-operative laparoscopy patients as an alternative to fentanyl.

In 2008 the Asamer Group together with the Libyan government holding company ESDF (Economic and Social Development Fund) took over 90% of the Libyan Cement Company (LCC). Background The Libyan Cement Company started production in 1972 with one factory. The production capacity for ordinary Portland cement was 200,000 t/yr. In 1974, a new production line was added with a capacity of 400,000 t/yr. A third production line was built in 1977 with a 400,000 ton capacity, which brought production to 1 million t/yr of ordinary Portland cement. However, the first factory stopped production due to maintenance problems. As of 2007, the Benghazi plant produces 800,000 t/yr. The Hawari plant, which was established in 1964 to produce 1,000,000 t/yr. In 1987, adjustments were made to the Hawari plant production lines to produce sulphate-resistant cement. The El-Fatayah factory was established in 1982 with two production lines having a 1,000,000 t/yr capacity of ordinary Portland cement. This factory is located 350 km east of Benghazi, near Derna.

In 1890 he received his medical doctorate from the University of Strasbourg with a thesis on delirium tremens. Later he worked as an assistant to Emil Kraepelin at the psychiatric university clinic in Heidelberg. He then practiced psychiatric medicine at the University of Halle and at the Akademie f√ºr praktische Medizin in Cologne (from 1919 the University of Cologne). In the 1930s Aschaffenburg's academic career at Cologne was terminated by the Nazi edict, Gesetz zur Wiederherstellung des Berufsbeamtentums, and he eventually emigrated to the United States, working as a professor at the Catholic University of America in Washington D.C. and at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Aschaffenburg was a pioneer in the fields of criminology and forensic psychiatry. In 1903 he published an early systematic study on the causes of crime titled \\"Das Verbrechen und seine Bek√§mpfung\\", in which he discusses individual-hereditary and social-environmental factors, and also dismisses Cesare Lombroso's idea of the so-called \\"born criminal\\".

History The short-lived Air Bahia, based in San Diego, operated its first scheduled service on August 18, 1979. Its operations included service to Los Angeles (LAX), Long Beach (LGB), San Diego via both Lindbergh Field (SAN) and Gillespie Field (SEE), Santa Ana via Orange County Airport (SNA), Palm Springs (PSP), Carlsbad via McClellan-Palomar Airport (CLD), El Centro (IPL), Calexico (CXL) and various points in Baja California and elsewhere in Mexico. In July 1980, Air Bahia was operating high frequency shuttle service between San Diego Lindbergh Field and Los Angeles (LAX) with twelve round trip flights every weekday and also between San Diego Lindbergh Field and Tijuana, Mexico with thirteen round trip flights every weekday. Its flights arrived and departed from the eastern terminal building at Lindbergh Field which it shared with National Airlines (1934-1980), Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) and United Airlines at the time. The airline operated only a small handful of twin prop commuter aircraft, including the Piper Chieftain, Piper Navajo and the Britten-Norman BN-2 Islander. Air Bahia operated scheduled international passenger service from Lindbergh Field, McClellan-Palomar Airport and Gillespie Field in San Diego County to several Mexican destinations and also flew nonstop between Tucson (TUS) and Guaymas, Mexico. Its timetables advertised connecting services to and from jet flights operated by Aeromexico and Mexicana de Aviacion in Mexico. Other routes included nonstop service between Las Vegas (LAS) and both Carlsbad and Long Beach. The airline's fleet service center was located at Southern Cal Aircraft Repair at Gillespie Field. In December 1980, Air Bahia filed for bankruptcy and all flights ceased. Reorganization under Chapter 11 failed, and the company folded up in 1981 without resuming flights.

Delgado, starring Cantinflas, Lilia Prado, and Sara Garc√≠a.Rodr√≠guez Terce√±o, pp. 218‚Äì219Amador & Ayala Blanco, p. 84 It is the second Cantinflas film presented by Columbia Pictures. Plot Inocencio Prieto y Calvo receives a letter telling him that he is the heir to his uncle's fortune of two million pesos, which he has only to claim by producing his baptismal certificate as proof of identity. However, as an illiterate, Inocencio has no idea of the contents of the letter. While waiting for the local druggist to wait on him so he can have the letter read to him, Inocencio is embarrassed to see that a customer's young daughter is already able to read while he, a grown man, cannot. He leaves without telling the druggist his problem, resolved to go to school and to wait to learn the letter's contents until he can read them for himself, so that never again will he have to share private matters with others because of his own ignorance. After registering at school, he stops by the local bank to ask for a job, having quit his previous employment that morning. Leaving the bank, he meets Blanca, an attractive young woman newly arrived in town, and shows her the way to her new place of employment, partly to avoid admitting he cannot read the written address. The daughter of Blanca's employer is entertaining her fianc√©, An√≠bal, who finds Blanca appealing and begins to make advances on her almost immediately. These advances are spurned each time; the final time, An√≠bal warns her she will regret her refusals. Over the course of the film, Inocencio gradually learns to read, courts Blanca, and makes both friends and enemies at the bank. He foils a robbery and then a plot to make him look guilty; the bank manager is so pleased with his honesty that he gives Inocencio a 1000-peso reward, which the grateful man proceeds to spend on a new dress for his godmother, a traditional regional dress for Blanca to wear in a beauty contest, and new shoes for himself. While going about his cleaning work in the bank, Inocencio unwittingly drops the lawyer's letter -- which he still has yet to read -- and Ferm√≠n, a fellow employee with a grudge against him finds the item on the floor. On the day of the contest, An√≠bal and Ferm√≠n, who are revealed to be cousins, conspire to make it appear that Blanca has stolen her employer's jewels and passed them to Inocencio. Though both are arrested, the trial is cut short when Ferm√≠n discovers An√≠bal has betrayed him and gone alone to claim the inheritance, leading him to reveal the whole plot. Inocencio and his friends rush to Mexico City to thwart the attempt and denounce An√≠bal, who is arrested at the lawyer's office after he arrives to claim the funds. The film concludes with Inocencio's and Blanca's wedding.

Werner considered the film as the one that marked the start of Cantinflas's creative decline, saying, \\"If one were forced to pinpoint the exact film that marked the start of Cantinflas's creative decline, one might choose El analfabeto.\\" He further elaborated, \\"There, his character is incarnated as an illiterate who works as a bank guard and eventually learns to read and write, thanks to Mexican public education. However, Cantinflas is not the schrewd, if ignorant, peladito of yore; rather, he is a quasi-retarded child-like simpleton who is easily tricked. Gone are the affronts towards the powerful that characterized his former movies: the bank's owner is good while his employees are bad, and the Catholic Church is fundamental to the illiterate's 'salvation'\\".Werner, p. 490 In Cantinflas and the Chaos of Mexican Modernity, Professor Jeffrey M. Pilcher reached similar conclusions, saying, \\"A lack of artifice and sophistication had always been part of [Cantinflas's] wise fool character, but in El analfabeto, he no longer appeared wise, merely a fool\\", theorizing that Cantinflas \\"adopted the innocent simpleton\\" from his previous film Pepe \\"as the new identity for Cantinflas\\", and that in the film \\"the capitalist represented a benevolent guardian while the antagonist was a jealous fellow worker trying to sabotage his success.\\" However, Pilcher also stated that \\"the movie featured Moreno's strongest supporting cast in decades\\", singling out √Ångel Garasa, Carlos Mart√≠nez Baena and Sara Garc√≠a.Pilcher, p. 189 DVD details The film is available on DVD from Sony Pictures Entertainment, with Spanish audio and Spanish and English subtitles.

The text and shape relate to each other, the latter usually giving added meaning to the poem itself. The tradition of shaped poetry goes back to Greek poets writing in Alexandria before the Common Era but most examples date from later and were written by European Christian poets during the Baroque period. Classical examples Three poems in the shape of altars date from Classical times, starting from the turn of the Common Era, and refer to Pagan altars, even though the last of the poets was a Christian. The name of the creator of the earliest poem is known to be Dosiadas, but there is no other information about him. As in some of the shaped poems written before it, the 18 lines propose a riddle to which the shape gives a clue. Containing recondite allusions to Greek mythology which have to be penetrated first, they begin ‚ÄúI am the work of the husband of the man-mantled queen, the twice young mortal,‚Äù by which one understands Jason, husband of Medea, who had once had to flee for her life in male disguise and who rejuvenated her husband by boiling him in a cauldron. The puzzle continues on for another sixteen longer and shorter lines arranged to represent an altar balanced on a pillared base.Theoi pattern poems The altar poem (Carmen XXVI) by Optatianus The second poem is also in Greek and was the work of Lucius Julius Vestinus, who describes himself as ‚ÄúHigh-priest of Alexandria and all Egypt, Curator of the Museum, Keeper of the Libraries of both Greek and Roman at Rome, Supervisor of the Education of Hadrian, and Secretary to the same Emperor.‚Äù The 26 lines of the poem represent the altar's self-referential soliloquy, but the initial letters of the lines are also an acrostic that spell out a complimentary message to the Emperor.Information from the Theoi site; also an image of the poem Finally there is a poem written in Latin by Publilius Optatianus Porfirius dating from the first quarter of the 4th century. In this the altar describes its construction as ‚Äúpolished by the craft of the poet's musical art (fabre politavitis artem musica)‚Ä¶I am straightly confined and hold back my edges as they attempt to grow and then, in the succeeding portion, let them spread more broadly.\\" It then elaborates in an equally self-descriptive way.FAMSF The poem has been judged to be 'undoubtedly a direct imitation of ‚ÄúJason‚Äôs Altar‚Äù' by Dosidas.J. Stephan Edwards, commentary on poem 26 in ‚ÄúThe Carmina of Publius Optatianus Porphyrius‚Äù The English Baroque Poems in the form of an altar reappear in the Baroque period, written by educated authors who had come across the shaped poems preserved in the Greek anthology. At the very beginning of this period, an altar was found to be a convenient shape for an epitaph, as in the anonymous tribute in Greek to the poet Philip Sydney in the Peplus Illustrissimi viri D. Philippi Sidnaei (1587),Higgins, p.24 and there are later examples of such epitaphs in English by William BrowneRickey, p.12 and Robert Baron.Higgins, p.96 There was an even earlier altar poem in Latin dating from 1573 by the English Catholic Richard Willis. Turning away from pagan associations, his poem declares itself ‚Äúan altar of the Christian religion‚Äù. In its presence, Willis represents himself as \\"Reborn in the holy/ washing of baptism\\"; though tried by perilous exile, he will keep the faith to the end.Rickey, p.11 The dedicatory poems to King James the First, prefacing Joshua Sylvester‚Äôs 1604 translation of a Christian epic by Du Bartas, occupy a position midway between Pagan and Christian. They are arranged as altar shapes centred upon each of the Classical Muses, but chiefly their names are only used as markers of the various aspects of the poem recommended to the king.Internet Archive The 17th century text of George Herbert's \\"The Altar\\" Most modern commentaries reflect on how altar poems of the period relate to the best known example, George Herbert‚Äôs \\"The Altar\\" (1633). An earlier anonymous example in Francis Davison‚Äôs Poetical Rhapsody (1602), the address of a rejected lover, approximates the form of George Herbert. A cross-rhymed octosyllabic quatrain is supported by three 4-syllabled quatrains which have as base another octosyllabic quatrain.Rickey, pp.13-14 Herbert‚Äôs is quantitively different, however. It is rhymed throughout in couplets and has lines of differing length (a pentameter followed by tetrameter) at the head which are reversed at the base. His poem is also more serious in tone, for all that it is built on an extravagantly Baroque conceit. His altar, he declares, is constructed from a broken, stony heart that is offered as a sacrifice to God. A nearly contemporary poem by William Bosworth (written about 1628, although not printed until 1651) matches the form of Herbert‚Äôs altar exactly. It appears untitled near the end of the ‚ÄúHaemon and Antigone‚Äù episode in his The Chaste and Lost Lovers, beginning with the lines ‚ÄúThose that Idalia‚Äôs wanton garments wear/ No Sacrifices for me must prepare‚Äù. There too is a repetition of the word ‚Äòaltar‚Äô in connection with the word ‚Äòsacrifice‚Äô which, more logically than in Herbert, appears on top of the altar.Text online Edward Benlowes‚Äô poem ‚ÄúThe Consecration‚Äù, in his Theophila, or Loves sacrifice: A divine poem (1652), was dissimilar in form from Herbert, but was surrounded by a drawn outline to make the likeness to an altar clearer,Online reproduction as happened in some later editions of Herbert's poem.Rickey, p.14 In the last quarter of the century appeared Samuel Speed's verbally ‚Äúservile imitation‚Äù of Herbert,Westerweel, p.84 also titled ‚ÄúThe Altar‚Äù, in his Prison Pietie (1677).Online text The taste for this kind of production was now over in any case. John Dryden satirised the Baroque taste in his ‚ÄúMac Flecknoe‚Äù and Joseph Addison singled out Herbert's ‚ÄúThe Altar‚Äù and its companion piece, ‚ÄúEaster Wings‚Äù, as a false and obsolete kind of wit.The Spectator no.58 (May 11, 1711), p.69 In Germany, too, where there had been a similar craze, Johann Leonhard Frisch composed some extreme examples, including an altar bearing a flaming heart, as satires upon the style.Online visual poetry exhibits Few more shaped poems were to be written until centuries later, and then in the service of a completely different aesthetic.

Etymology The Irish name Disert-Iolladhan (Disertillan) translates as Iolladhan's or Illan's hermitage. The word Castle was substituted for Disert as in last name. Ilann‚Äôs feast day is listed as 2nd Feb in the Martyrology of Tallaght and he was accorded a genealogy which indicated close kinship with the Ui Dunglainge kings of Leinster. The ancient Irish genealogy claims that Cormac: second son of Olioll, was King of Leinster for nine years; abdicated A.D. 515, and died a monk at Bangor, 567, had: 1. Cairbre Dubh, King of Leinster, who died in 546; 2. Felim, from whom descended Cormac, of Tullac; 3. Iolladon, priest of Desert Iolladoin (now \\"Castledillon\\"), who had St. Criotan (11 May), of Magh Credan and Acadfinnech (on the river Dodder), and of Crevagh Cruagh, co. Dublin. In 1202 Thomas de Hereford granted Thillerdelan to St Wolstan‚Äôs religious community in nearby Celbridge. Medieval landmarks By 1294 the church of Tristeyldelane was described as ‚Äúnot worth the services of chaplains‚Äù in the Calendar of Christ Church deeds. The site is now identified by a pile of stones and one headstone, erected in 1758 to the Spellissy family. The Castledillon Friars Stone, probably erected for a 15th-century abbot of St Wolstan‚Äôs (four miles to the east), remained on the site until removed to the Visitor centre in Kildare town. Castle In 1271 William de Mandesham of Kavesham was granted the lands of Tristildelane. The tower house of Castledillon passed to the de Hereford and Rochford families (1359). It was burned in the wars of 1641-2 but uniquely was recorded in the 1659 census as ‚Äúbeing since repaired by Mrs Bowell‚Äù increased in value from ¬£60 to ¬£50. It remained intact until the 18th century until it rapidly fell into disrepair and stones were removed from the site ‚Äì now only the foundations remain. In 1557 Patrick Sarsfield of Tisteldalen, great great granduncle of Patrick Sarsfield of Siege of Limerick fame, obtained a pardon from the English colonial government and in 1560 obtained the lease of White Church alias Tullatipper. Monitoring of development undertaken on 25‚Äì26 July 2001 led to the recovery of pottery sherds of both medieval and post-medieval date from a layer of fill. This material was introduced to the site, at some unknown time in the past, in order to fill a natural hollow. Castledillon Friar‚Äôs Stone An incised slab with a priest, which was removed from Castledillon, is now in the visitor centre in Kildare town.

On 1 April 1922, she was officially re-designated as a survey vessel, and her armament was replaced by two 8-inch guns. During the course of its surveys, Yamato discovered a seamount in the Sea of Japan, which was named after it. On 1 April 1935, Yamato was retired from navy service and demilitarized. Her hulk was obtained by the Ministry of Justice and relocated to Uraga where she was used as a floating prison and training vessel for juvenile offenders. It was towed to Yokohama harbor during World War II, but was swamped in a typhoon in September 1945 at the mouth of the Tsurumi River in Tokyo Bay. Her hulk was raised and scrapped in 1950.

It connects to Jamaica Bay to the south, and the north end of the basin is adjacent to the intersection of Ralph Avenue and Flatlands Avenue. \\"Paerdegat\\" derives from the old Dutch paardengat, meaning \\"horse gate\\".NYC Parks - Paerdegat Park Formation Paerdegat Basin came to its present form in the late 1920s. Before then, it was a freshwater-fed tidal creek known at various times as Bestevaar Kill, Bedford Creek, and Paerdegat Creek. It was much longer than the present-day basin, and had several branches. The basin adjoined Brooklyn's last patch of natural forest, which was demolished in 1940. Jamaica Bay seaport plan The waterway was an important part of a failed plan to transform Jamaica Bay into an alternative port to New York Harbor. Such a plan had been entertained in the 1910s, but was ultimately unsuccessful. In 1927, the docklands project was revived when a connection to the Long Island Rail Road was announced. Planners wanted to create a spur of the Bay Ridge Branch south to Flatlands, with two branches to Canarsie and Mill Basin. A connection to Staten Island would be built via the planned Staten Island Tunnel, which would in turn allow freight to be delivered and shipped to the rest of the continental United States. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey offered to build the new railroad link for $2 million and lease it to the city. In January 1931, the New York City Board of Estimate approved a plan to build railroads on both sides of Paerdegat Basin, connecting the LIRR to Canarsie Pier to the east and to Floyd Bennett Field to the west. However, the plans for rail service to the rest of Brooklyn went unrealized. The only thing that was completed was the dredging of Paerdegat Basin to a depth. In the 1950s and 1960s, much of the city-owned land around the basin was sold off to private developers. The neighborhoods of Georgetown and Bergen Beach were built near its banks. Sewage treatment plant The waterway is polluted due to the overflow location of the combined sewer system at the basin's northern end. The area's sanitary sewer (from residential and industrial sources) is carried through the same system as the storm water. Typically, the full volume of that water is drained to the Coney Island Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) located on Knapp Street. However, during periods of heavy rainfall, the Knapp Street plant does not have the capacity to treat the full volume of the water, so untreated water is forced to flow out into Paerdegat Basin. The New York City Department of Environmental Protection is working to mitigate the environmental impact of the overflow on the ecosystem. At the same time, the DEP is working with the Parks Department to repair the saltwater wetland area which lines the east and west shores of the basin. NYC Parks and NYCDEP are building a Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) facility at that location; the construction contract was awarded to the joint venture of Slattery Skanska / Gottlieb Skanska, which is a subsidiary of the global construction company Skanska. The facility serves as holding tank for the excess water, and whenever the Knapp Street plant can accept additional water, the water is pumped from the holding tank of the CSO facility back to the plant to be treated, preventing the raw untreated sewage from flowing into the Basin. The CSO facility was completed in August 2011.

An analogy of caprock could be the outer crust on a cake that is a bit harder than the underlying layer. Common caprock locations are escarpments, mesa formations, and salt domes.

Description  Horseshoe Falls, part of the Niagara EscarpmentCaprock is a harder or more resistant rock type overlying a weaker or less resistant rock type. Common types of caprock are sandstone and mafic rock types. An analogy of caprock could be the outer crust on a cake that is a bit harder than the underlying layer. In processes such as scarp retreat, the caprock controls the rate of erosion of the scarp. As the softer rock is cut away, periodically the caprock shears off. Caprock is also found on the top of mesa formations. The Niagara Escarpment, over which Niagara Falls flows, is an example of a scarp or escarpment. At Niagara Falls, the caprock is the riverbed above the falls, and is what prevents the river from eroding the face of the falls very quickly. In the photo, the dark thin layer in the foreground where water is not yet running, is the caprock. The Niagara caprock is made of dolomitic limestone.  Petroleum  In the petroleum industry, caprock is any nonpermeable formation that may trap oil, gas or water, preventing it from migrating to the surface. This caprock or trap can create a reservoir of oil, gas or water beneath it and is a primary target for the petroleum industry.  Salt dome caprock  The tops of salt domes such as in the Gulf of Mexico dissolve in a characteristic manner, and can range between 0‚Äì1500 ft thick. The halite (salt) is removed first, leaving behind gypsum and anhydrite. The anhydrite and gypsum react with organic material to form calcite. The classic Murray 1966 paper describes the generalized sequence as sediments-calcite-gypsum- anhydrite-salt.

His older brother James Conway played Major League Baseball as a pitcher for the Brooklyn Atlantics and Philadelphia Athletics in 1884 and 1885. Baseball player=Buffalo Bisons Conway began pitching in Major League Baseball with the Buffalo Bisons of the National League in 1885. He made his Major League debut on August 10, 1885. He pitched a six-hit complete game victory in his debut against his hometown team, the Philadelphia Phillies. The World of New York reported on Buffalo's rookie pitcher: \\"The Buffalo Club tried Conway, of the local Solar Tip Club, in the box today, and he proved quite a success. The six hits obtained by the Philadelphians were scattered, two being made in the first inning and one each in the second, third, fifth and sixth. In the fourth inning, Conway struck out the side, saving a man on third base.\\" One day after his Major League debut, Conway pitched his second complete game victory, this time against St. Louis. Conway allowed only four hits up to the eighth inning in the game. Two days later, The New York Times took note: \\"Conway, Buffalo's new pitcher, is handling the ball very cleverly.\\" Later that week, The New York Times added: \\"Conway, Buffalo's new pitcher, is said to be a first-class man. He appears to be doing good work.\\" At the end of September 1885, Conway lost a game against the Brooklyn Giants at the Polo Grounds. Although Brooklyn won the game 11‚Äì2, The New York Times again praised the effort of the young Conway: \\"With the exception of the second inning Conway pitched a good game, and was very effective. The support given him, however, was of the worst possible character, and allowed the local men to tally unearned runs with apparent ease.\\" During the 1885 season, the 18-year-old rookie appeared in 27 games and pitched 26 complete games. As his debut came on August 11, his 26 complete games were thrown over a seven-week period in August and September ‚Äì a remarkable average of almost four complete games per week. Conway compiled a record of 10 wins and 17 losses for a Buffalo team that finished in seventh place (next-to-last) with a 38-74 record. Kansas City Cowboys After the 1885 season, the Buffalo franchise folded, and Conway signed with the Kansas City Cowboys of the National League. Again, Conway played for a team that finished the year in seventh place, as the Cowboys compiled a 30‚Äì91 record. Conway appeared in 34 games for the Cowboys, 31 as a starter, and threw 30 complete games. He compiled a record of 5 wins and 15 losses. Detroit Wolverines Pete Conway, 1887 Old Judge baseball card Conway was traded late in the 1886 season to the Detroit Wolverines, where he pitched 11 complete games in 1886 with a record of 6‚Äì5. On September 2, 1886, Conway defeated the Brooklyn Giants 8‚Äì2 in a game played in Detroit. The New York Times wrote that the Giants were unable \\"to bat the curves of young Conway, Detroit's new pitcher\\", adding that Conway \\"handled the ball in rare style, and, with the exception of Connor, completely puzzled the batters from New York.\\" In his first full season in Detroit, Conway played on the 1887 Detroit Wolverines team that won the National League pennant. Conway pitched 16 complete games and led the team with a 2.90 ERA, though his record was 8‚Äì9. When he defeated his hometown Phillies at Philadelphia in late August 1887, The New York Times wrote: \\"Conway pitched a great game of ball for Detroit to-day, holding local players down to three actual hits and giving only three bases on balls. ... The Phillies ... were seemingly dazed by the effectiveness of Conway's pitching.\\" Conway pitched four games in the 1887 World Series against the American Association St. Louis Browns, winning two and losing two, as the Wolverines won the World Series 10 games to 5. Conway had his best season in 1888. He appeared in 45 games for Detroit and pitched 43 complete games and 391 innings. He finished the season with a record of 30 wins and 14 losses, and his winning percentage (.682) was the second highest in the National League. It would be 80 years before another Detroit pitcher would win 30 games, when Denny McLain did it for the Detroit Tigers in 1968. Pittsburgh Alleghenies At the end of the 1888 season, the Detroit franchise disbanded. Conway traveled to New York in November 1888 to offer his services to other clubs at a meeting of the National League. William A. Nimick, the president of the Pittsburgh Alleghenys, offered Conway a salary of $3,500 per year, but Conway refused to sign unless he was paid $4,000 per year. Conway indicated that he preferred to play for the Boston Beaneaters, where four of his Detroit teammates known as the \\"Big Four\\" (Dan Brouthers, Hardy Richardson, Jack Rowe, and Deacon White) had signed. However, Conway was told that, following the breakup of the Detroit franchise, he \\"had been allocated to Pittburg.\\" After talking with Fred Dunlap, a former teammate who had played for the Alleghenies in 1888, Conway ultimately agreed to sign a two-year contract for $3,500 per year. During the 1889 season, Conway appeared in only three games for the Alleghenies. Though he won two of the three games, his earned run average soared to 4.91 ‚Äì more than double his 1888 earned run average of 2.26. Conway appeared in his final Major League game on May 9, 1889. He was suspended without pay by the Alleghenies who claimed that he was not in condition to play. It was reported in the press that Conway had \\"snapped a cord in his arm,\\"Boston Daily Globe, July 2, 1889. and that his \\"anterior detroid muscle was out of whack.\\"Boston Daily Globe, August 4, 1889. The Alleghenies' suspension of Conway without pay following his injury sparked an early controversy over players' rights. In August 1889, newspaper accounts noted: \\"Pete Conway will be backed by the brotherhoodThe Brotherhood of Professional Base-Ball Players was baseball's first players' union. in a suit against the Pittsburg club this fall. He was laid off without pay, but reports for duty, every day.\\" In September 1899, Conway was reported to be using electricity on his arm to offset the effect of the injury.Boston Daily Globe, September 17, 1889. Players' League In March 1890, Conway signed with the Brooklyn franchise in the newly formed Players' League. By late June, newspapers reported that he had been with the team for two months, but had not yet appeared in a game. A reporter quipped, \\"If he is drawing salary he is rather an expensive ornament.\\" By the beginning of August 1890, it was reported that \\"Conway has not drawn a dollar from the Brooklyn club\\" and that he was \\"at his home in Philadelphia.\\" Baseball coach Pete Conway, Michigan's first baseball coach in 1891 In 1891, the University of Michigan hired Conway as the first coach of the Michigan Wolverines baseball team. Although Michigan had fielded a baseball team since the 1860s, the team had never engaged the services of a professional coach. H. T. Abbott, the student manager of the baseball team, attempted to hire Billy Sunday and Charlie Bennett, but both declined the offer. Conway accepted and became Michigan's \\"first official coach.\\" Conway arrived in Ann Arbor at the beginning of April 1891 and remained through the end of May. The 1891 Wolverines finished with a 10‚Äì3 record, including victories over Harvard (4‚Äì3) and Cornell (8‚Äì6). Conway returned as Michigan's baseball coach in 1892. In two years as Michigan's baseball coach, Conway compiled a 22‚Äì9‚Äì1 record (). Later years and family At the time of the 1900 U.S. Census, Conway was living with his mother (Grace, born 1840 in Ireland) and three brothers in Clifton Heights, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia located approximately a mile from where he was born. His occupation was listed as mule skinner.Census listing for Grace Conway, born November 1840, in Ireland, listing 1851 as the year of immigration to the United States. She was living on Edgmount Avenue in Clifton Heights with her sons, Michael (Worker, born February 1860), James (Day Labor, born October 1862), Francis (born June 1864), and Peter (Mule Skinner, born October 1867).

About the founder  The Gandhi Vidya Mandir was established in 1950 envisioned by Shri Kanhaiyalal Dugar, on the Gandhian ideals, who later embraced sainthood. Gandhi Vidya Mandir was the vision of Shri Kanhaiyalal Dugar. He was born and brought up in Sardarshahr, in the erstwhile princely state of Bikaner. Although he belonged to a very distinguished and wealthy family, he had a spiritual inclination since his childhood. He idolized Mahatma Gandhi and much of those ideals are embedded in the University. Shri Dugar went to Wardha and consulted Acharya Vinoba Bhave and other Gandhians like Kaka Kalelkar, Kishorlal Mashruwala, Krishnadas Jaju, Shriman Narayan Agarwal and Madalsa Ben. Vinoba Bhave who said 'Spread Light Where It Is The Darkest, Spread Education Were Illiteracy Is The Highest'; the reference was obvious ‚Äì Kanhaiyalal's home town of Sardarshahr, in the starkest desert region of Rajasthan. The project was conceptualized there and the name of Gandhi Vidya Mandir was decided. Later on, Shri Dugar consulted some other prominent personalities like Dada Ravishankar Maharaj, Swami Sharnanand, Hanuman Prasad Poddar, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Acharya Tulsi and Jayaprakash Narayan. Sardar Patel had promised to lay the foundation stone of Gandhi Vidya Mandir but he died. Devised as India's first Rural University, its foundation stone was laid in 1955, by Dr. Rajendra Prasad, the first President of India.

Giacomo Francia, Flight into Egypt, Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille Giacomo Raibolini (1484 ‚Äì 3 January 1557), alternative names; Giacomo Francia or Jacopo Francia, was an Italian painter and engraver of the Renaissance period. Francia was born in Bologna as elder son of Francesco Raibolini, (Francesco Francia) and like his father was also called il Francia. His father and brother Giulio Raibolini were also artists. Francia was trained by his father in painting and goldsmithing, and acted as his assistant. In 1517, the year of his father's death, he and his brother, Giulio, assumed responsibility for the family business and together executed many church altarpieces, identifiable by the initials (I I) of their Latinized names (Iacobus and Iulius). Late in life Giacomo came under the influence of Dosso Dossi. He died in Bologna in 1567. Giacomo's earliest known work is the Virgin in Glory with SS Peter, Mary Magdalene, Francis, Martha and Six Nuns (after 1515; Bologna, Pin. N.). In this painting, as in the SS Jerome, Margaret and Francis (1518; Madrid, Prado) and the Nativity (1519; Parma, S Giovanni Evangelista), both dated and signed by both brothers, there appear, in addition to the influence of their father, echoes of the monumental style of Raphael.

Also known as Mummadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar, the maharaja belonged to the Wadiyar dynasty and ruled the kingdom for nearly seventy years, from 30 June 1799 to 27 March 1868. He is known for his contribution and patronage to different arts and music during his reign. He was succeeded by his adopted son, Chamarajendra Wadiyar X. Early years Krishnaraja Wadiyar III, who was born at Srirangapatna, was the son of Khasa Chamaraja Wadiyar IX (who was born at Arikottara, now Chamarajanagar) and his first wife, Maharani Kempananjammani Avaru.Annals of The Mysore Royal Family Part-1: A publication by the Royal Family of Mysore: 1916 Maharani Lakshmi Ammani Devi, his adoptive grandmother, played a major role in the education and upbringing of her adopted grandson, Krishnaraja Wadiyar III, and was instrumental in his ascendancy to the Mysore throne.Rajakaryaprasakta Rao Bahadur (1936), p265 The Wadiyars had lost the throne of Mysore to Hyder Ali in the year 1766 and, for the first and last time in Mysore's history, there was no Wadiyar ruler on the Mysore throne between 1760 and 1799. Maharani Lakshmi Ammani Devi was awaiting a chance to unseat Hyder Ali (who died) and later his son Tipu Sultan, and had sent numerous feelers to the British to unseat him and hand over the kingdom to the Wadiyars. She also informed the British about the treaty between Tipu Sultan and the French.Rajakaryaprasakta Rao Bahadur (1936), p271 When Tipu Sultan died at the hands of the British in 1799, she discussed about the handover of the Mysore throne, which finally led to the installation of the five-year-old Krishnaraja Wadiyar III, as the Maharaja of Mysore on 30 June 1799.Rajakaryaprasakta Rao Bahadur (1936), p266 The ceremony took place in a special pavilion constructed near the Lakshmiramana Swamy temple in Mysore. Being led to it by the Duke of Wellington on his right, Tipu Sultan's prime minister Dewan Purnaiah was formally selected as the Dewan of Mysore with an indication that he should be loyal to the king till the king himself attains an age of discretion. Ruler of Mysore State Krishnaraja Wadiyar III attained the age of 16 in early 1810 and hence attained the age of discretion. After discussing with the British Resident, A. H. Cole, the reins of the state were transferred from Dewan Purnaiah to the king.Rajakaryaprasakta Rao Bahadur (1936), p383 But the king lost the services of his grandmother, who died in 1810, and also of Purnaiah, who died in 1812. The years that followed witnessed cordial relations between Mysore and the British until things began to sour in the 1820s. Even though the Governor of Madras, Thomas Munro, determined after a personal investigation in 1825 that there was no substance to the allegations of financial impropriety made by A. H. Cole, the incumbent Resident of Mysore, the civil insurrection which broke out towards the end of the decade changed things considerably. In 1831, close on the heels of the insurrection and citing maladministration, the British took direct control of the princely state. For the next fifty years, Mysore passed under the rule of successive British Commissioners; Lieutenant-General Mark Cubbon, renowned for his statesmanship, served from 1834 until 1861 and put into place an efficient and successful administrative system which left Mysore a well-developed state. Contribution to culture Krishnaraja Wadiyar III was responsible for the cultural growth of the Kingdom of Mysore. He was himself a writer, having written Kannada books like Sritattvanidhi and Sougandhikaparinaya. He also has a number of writers in his court who together contributed to the development of modern Kannada prose, which had a style different from the Champu style of prose which was followed till then.K. M. George (1994), p167 Other important writings that emerged during his rule include Mudramanjusha by Kempu Narayana, Kalavati Parinaya by Yadava, and Vachana Kadamabari. The king was well versed in many languages, including Sanskrit, Kannada, Tamil, English, Telugu, and Urdu. He even played the musical instrument, veena. He was an expert player of board games and is credited to have revived the Ganjifa game. He was also a collector and an inventor of board games. Krishnaraja Wadiyar III was a ruler who gave a lot of importance to the development of art during his period. He patronised many scholars in his court and he himself was a great Kannada and Sanskrit Scholar, and has composed more than 50 works. The Yakshagana form of literature, its growth, and survival are all due to his efforts. Parti Subba from South Canara, a famous Yakshagana writer, flourished during his period. Devachandra, Venkatarama Shastri, Basavappa Shastri, Aliya Lingaraja, Kempu Narayana, Srinivasa Kavisarvabhouma, Thammaya Kavi, Nanjunda Kavi, Shantaraja Pandita were all patronised by him. Devachandra wrote Rajavali Katha which is of great historical importance and also Ramakathavathara, a work in Champu style. Kempu Narayana wrote Mudra Manjusha, which is a Kannada prose. Asthana Vidwan Basavappa Shastri has written various works. He composed Kannada poems such as Shakuntala, Vikramorvasiya, Rathnavali, Chandakousika, and Uttara Ramacharita. He has also translated the famous work of Shakespeare, Othello, into Kannada and it is known as Shurasena Charita. He has also written Damayanti in Champu style, Savitri Charita in Shatpadi, Sri Raghavendra Swamy Ashtottara Stotram, and numerous other works in Sanskrit. Krishnaraja Wadiyar III has composed many works like Dasharatha Nandana Charita, Grahana Darpana, Sankya Ratna Kosha, Chaturanga Sara Sarvasva, Sri Tatvanidhi, Saugandhika Parinaya, Sri Krishna Katha Sangraha, Ramayana, Mahabharata, Surya Chandra Vamsavali, etc. He was called Bhoja Raja of Kannada.

He is considered a pioneer of gekiga. The son of the Japanese proletarian painter Toki Okamoto, his dream to become an artist equal with his father started when he became a Kamishibai artist. He is also known for his work published in the early issues of the manga anthology magazine Garo in 1964, which he began publishing so as to serialize his comic Kamui. Early Life Shirato was born in Tokyo, Japan. In Shirato's childhood his father was active in the proletarian culture movement, being one of the few people to be photographed with the tortured corpse of proletarian leader Kobayashi Takiji. As he grew up he experienced the rancor of the war years, and it is said that these grim emotions come out in the nihilistic society portrayed in his works. Shirato developed his artistic style through painting picture-card shows (kamishibai) after finishing middle school at 18. He was influenced by the Ukiyo-e of the pre-Meiji period, but differed in his portrayal of action in a multi-panel \\"slow motion\\" style unique to his manga.Tsurumi, Shunsuke. A Cultural History of Postwar Japan. Columbia University Press. 1987. First Published in Japanese by Iwanami Shoten, Tokyo, 1984. His style of action portrayal came from the tension building techniques inherent in the performance aspect of Kami-shibai. Manga Career Shirato started his career as a professional manga artist in 1957 with Ninja bugeich≈ç (\\"Ninja martial arts handbook,\\" published 1959-1962), a historically-based ninja-themed manga that captured the attention of students and intellectuals of the time. This violent epic tale set in Japan's \\"Warring States\\" (Sengoku) period was seen by many readers and critics as a thinly-veiled allegory for the ongoing Anpo Protests against the US-Japan Security Treaty (although Shirato himself later denied this was his intention). Regardless of Shirato's true intetions, the manga seemed to correspond to the feelings and experiences student protesters were going through at the time, and Ninja bugeich≈ç developed an avid following among left-leaning student activists. Because its adult themes and graphic violence, Ninja bugeich≈ç has been cited as one of the very first examples of gekiga, or serious manga aimed specifically at adult audiences rather than children. The Legend of Kamui, the first series published in Garo, can be considered his most important manga work. It is the story of Kamui, a ninja who leaves an organization that pursues him and clearly sees the true nature of the Edo period and the discrimination that existed in the feudal system. Shirato's works are primarily historical dramas that focus on ninja, present a historical record of Japan, and criticize oppression, discrimination, and exploitation. Many of Shirato's works have been adapted as anime series and films, including Ninja bugeich≈ç, adapted by Nagisa Oshima as Band of Ninja in 1967, an unusual film consisting only of images from the manga and voiceovers with no animation. Some works have received attention in the United States, such as The Legend of Kamui, which was released in 1987 by Viz Media, but others remain relatively unknown.

The landscape is arid, dry and very remote. The Irrunytju artists and their families will often travel through the country of their ancestors to hunt for food, collect plants for bush medicine, and grass and seeds for basket weaving and jewellery making. The Irrunytju art centre was established in 2001. Before this, some of the community members were already producing paintings. But when the art centre was opened, many community members attended daily to paint their tjukurpa(dreamtime) stories. Irrunytju Arts is now well established and the artists are known for producing vibrant and colourful canvases which depict a variety of tjukurpa, heavily related to the landscape of the surrounding country and its history. Some Irrunytju artists, particularly Yannima Tommy Watson, are represented in prominent private and public collections, both in Australia and internationally.

He was encouraged by his aunt (by some accounts adopted mother), Moraa Ngiti, to launch an attack against British forces. He is famously remembered for injuring GAS Northcote, a British colonial administrator, triggering a widespread rebellion. Northcote had first gone to Kisii as part of a military force in 1904 which massacred people and raised the Union Jack. He returned in 1907 as the areas first administrator, and was on his way back from a punitive expedition when he was attacked by Otenyo with a spear. Although Northcote survived the attack, Otenyo's ambush inspired widespread resistance which took a month to quell. The warrior was arrested, tried in public, and then killed by a firing squad at Kisii Stadium. His body was then beheaded and transported to London as proof of his death. What remained of him was left on a public bridge as a warning to others.  Background  In 1905, British officers from the King's African Rifles (K.A.R) arrived in Gusiiland where they met resistance from the Gusii warriors whom they attacked with machine guns and killed quite a number. They burned homesteads, seized livestock and destroyed crops already on the farms in what came to be known as the \\"massacre\\". Families including women and children who showed resistance of moving from their homes were mercilessly shot dead and their huts torched during this expedition. The British and their Nubian porters forcefully settled in the present day Kisii town which was known as Getare at the time, but not without tensions from the Kitutu region which was known to be the militaristic centre of the whole Gusiiland. This constant fighting made it hard for the British to realise their expansionism dreams of occupying more land. The Gusii elders encouraged young men who had gone through the initiation ceremony to marry fearing a whole generation would be wiped out, citing prophet Sakawa's foresights of the coming of the white man before his death in 1902. On numerous occasions the British made sudden predatory invasions on cattle camps known as ebisarate and seized livestock. One well-known British hostile attack on Omogusii was in 1908 when they raided ebisarate in the Kitutu region and confiscated over 8,000 livestock. The British with the aid of their Nubian porters used guns and overpowered the young warriors hence killing them and getting away with the livestock. One warrior who survived these initial 1908 attacks was named Otenyo. He had a young daughter named Bosibori and lived in the same homestead with his aunt Moraa, a medicine woman-cum-prophetess who was vocally rebellious to the alien authority. Otenyo was infuriated with the serious losses of livestock and conceived a counterattack plan on the British officers who were by then marching the livestock out of Kitutu. With his aunt encouraging him, Otenyo assembled seasoned warriors with whom together they received blessings from Moraa before leaving to confront the British officers. Armed with poisonous arrows and spears, their plan was to use a different route and get ahead of the British officers who were moving slowly with the livestock. Once they would be in front of them, the warriors were to waylay the British officers by spreading themselves out and hiding inside a thicket of bushes known as ebitutu. This attack took place in the present day Manga in Kitutu region. Though armed with inferior weapons, the Gusii warriors managed to lay an ambush on the British and recovered many livestock which they led towards the Manga escarpment. Some brave warriors sacrificed their lives and many more were wounded. One British officer was speared dead by warrior Otenyo. The British officers shot and wounded Otenyo whom they captured. His bloodied headless body was later found dumped beside a bridge with multiple gunshot wounds. The name of the British colonial officer who beheaded warrior Otenyo was Geoffrey Alexander Northcote who was 27 years old at the time and was better known to the locals as ‚ÄúMr. Nyarigoti\\". He was leading the British invasion at the time and there was corroborating evidence from the Nubian porters in Bosongo where he was stationed, of his unbounded pride in having beheaded a Gusii warrior. He stayed in Kenya until 1927 before he left for Gold Coast (Ghana).  Death and legacy  During the counter-attack by British forces after Otenyo's attack on Northcote, over 160 people were killed. Otenyo was captured and tried in public. He was then executed by a firing squad, then beheaded and the rest of him left on a bridge. Under the guidance of the Gusii elders, Otenyo's headless body was buried at the top of Manga escarpment (present day Kitutu). Moraa continued administering to the wounded Gusii warriors until she died in 1929 due to old age. Moraa is regarded a Gusii heroine for her courage and many songs have been composed in her tribute. Gusii warriors from Kitutu who died protecting Gusiiland and their livestock are remembered through songs and stories depicting their bravery in the different wars they fought. Otenyo's family was taken care of by Moraa after his death. Through his only daughter Bosibori, his family is now widespread in the Manga and Matutu area of Kitutu region. In 2015, Gusii elders demanded the repatriation of his skull, said to still be held by a British museum. The story of Otenyo has resurfaced in multiple pop culture and social activism efforts, such as Too Early for Birds and Project Courage.

Konyok Gorbunok ili Tsar-Devitsa, or Le Petit cheval bossu, ou La Tsar-Demoiselle) is a ballet in four acts and eight scenes with apotheosis.  Story of the ballet  The libretto is by Arthur Saint-L√©on, based on the fairy tale The Little Humpbacked Horse by Pyotr Yershov. However, the choreographer substantially deviated from Yershov's original tale.¬´–ö–æ–Ω–µ–∫-–≥–æ—Ä–±—É–Ω–æ–∫¬ª The ballet shows how Ivan the fool, with the aid of a magical horse, defeats an evil Khan and wins the hand of the Tsar- Maiden. Eventually Ivan replaces the ineffective and incompetent Tsar and becomes Tsar himself.  Choreography of Saint-L√©on  The original choreography was created by Arthur Saint-L√©on and was set to music by Cesare Pugni. The ballet was first presented by the Imperial Ballet on at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia. Marfa Muravyova (as the Tsar Maiden) and Timofey Stukolkin (as Ivanushka) were planned as principal performers. However, Stukolkin had broken his leg and was replaced with Nilolay Troitsky, who had no previous experience of dancing principal roles. The ballet became an important milestone in the development of Russian ballet. It was the first ballet based on a Russian story. Composer Pugni included Russian folk songs in the music for the ballet and choreographer Arthur Saint-L√©on created specifically Russian folk dancing - overall 22 Russian folk dances were staged. However, the French choreographer was not very knowledgeable in Russian folk dancing and invented many of them himself, including the \\"Ural dance\\".Yuriy Bakhrushin.

On the other hand, the ballet enjoyed success with the audience. In its turn, it triggered the creation of a series of Russian-style ballets on the Imperial scene. Simultaneously, the Moscow Imperial troupe developed a different style, combining classical European choreography with real Russian folk dance. After two years, , the ballet was moved to the Moscow Imperial troupe.

The film is critically acclaimed and has received several awards, both Australian and international. The Black Road was among four films on the subject of separatism that the Indonesian Film Censorship Institute banned in the country. __TOC__ Plot William Nessen, an American freelance journalist, travels to Aceh, Indonesia to cover the conflict which was taking place there at the time.

At this point, Nessen had no plans for a film, but recorded footage which he intended to sell to television networks. He began to visit General Bambang Darmono, the leader of the Indonesian military in Aceh. Gaining the trust of General Darmono, Nessen was able to obtain information and shooting opportunities that would have been unavailable to most other journalists. During this period he fell in love with a trusted military translator, Sya‚Äôdiah Syeh Marhaban, who was a spy for the separatist movement. They worked together, continuing to extract sensitive information from General Darmono. Nessen, as his collection of footage grew, thought of making a film. This idea would later evolve into The Black Road. Nessen and Marhaban were married in Aceh. Only a few days after the wedding Nessen‚Äôs best man, a human rights activist, was kidnapped and murdered by Indonesian security forces.The Black Road It became clear to Nessen that the independence movement was supported by the majority of the Acehnese. As his personal experiences began to influence him, he too began to support the GAM. He went to live on the front lines with the rebels many times, travelling between General Darmono and the guerrillas in secret. In total, Nessen spent more than a year with the GAM before the military realised what he was doing. He was hunted and almost killed by the Indonesian military, who accused him of espionage. After being ordered to stop reporting from rebel held areas, Nessen spent weeks running from the authorities. After many near-death experiences, he turned himself into the military and was then imprisoned for forty days. Following this he was deported to Singapore and banned from entering Indonesia for one year, a ban that has been renewed each year since 2004.Reporters sans fronti√®res - Indonesia Reporters sans fronti√®res - Indonesia: Officials deny entry to US journalist who covered war in Aceh from rebels‚Äô side Production Between 2001 and 2003, Nessen spent almost a year in Aceh.Acheh-Eye.Org During this time, Nessen was repeatedly ordered to stop reporting from rebel-held areas. Upon giving himself up to Indonesian authorities, Nessen was imprisoned for 40 days. The Indonesian military originally accused him of espionage, and threatened the death penalty, but due to U.S. Embassy involvement in the case Nessen was found to be innocent, and was only charged with failing to inform officials of an address change and failing to report to martial law authorities.

Chameleon Jail is Inoue's first manga series to be compiled in tank≈çbon form. It was first published in Shueisha's Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump in Japan in 1989. The story centers on a \\"risk hunter\\" named Chameleon Jail, who thwarts and solves crimes by using a superhuman ability to change his appearance at will. Plot \\"Risk hunters\\" are professionals who handle jobs considered too tough for normal law enforcement, such as kidnappings, combatting terrorism, and preventing murders. One man who stands above them all however is the legendary Chameleon Jail, who has the ability to manipulate his \\"kara\\" or internal human body energy in order to physically change his appearance into that of any other person. Throughout the series, he pursues several assignments on behalf of various clients given to him by Shall, a woman who runs a detective agency in New York City. All difficult, the successful completion of these assignments hinges on Jail's ability to change his appearance when the time is right. Characters=Main characters Chameleon Jail :The protagonist and title character, Chameleon Jail or Jail as he more commonly goes by, is a Japanese risk hunter residing in New York City. In addition to manipulating his kara to alter his appearance, he can also channel it in order to change a target's sex from male to female. Part of his ability to manipulate his appearance also seems to entail being able to adopt the talents and skills practiced by those whom he imitates in order to further deceive his targets. However Jail can hold his own in most situations without resorting to using his kara manipulation, being a skilled fighter and marksman. Despite the high prices charged for his services, Jail has a sense of honor and a conscience. He also has goofy side and a weakness for food. He works between assignments as a sushi chef. Shall :Shall is the female proprietor of a private detective agency in New York City who gives Jail his assignments and also assists him in completing them as best she can, functioning as his partner in a sense. She continuously promotes Jail as the best risk hunter in the business, and uses him once herself for an assignment. Other characters Chameleon Jail manipulates his \\"kara\\" to transform from a disguise he has assumed to his true self (right). The following characters appear in story arcs more than one chapter long in Chameleon Jail. Colonel Keith Burns :Colonel Keith as he is known as is a former Delta Force officer who is dying from a heart condition. Because of his stoic demeanor at the time of his wife's death and their frequent arguments, his son Jed believes that he did not love his wife and bears a grudge against him as a result. Jed Burns :Jed Burns is Colonel Keith's son who harbors a grudge against his father following his mother's death at a young age. Seeking to get revenge by tarnishing his father's name, he becomes a terrorist and leads a group of hijackers who take control of an airliner, killing many of the hostages. Camel :Camel is Gil's righthand man, who is responsible for kidnapping Kat Suri. He later attempts to kill Corey and Jail and assists in Jackal's attempt to steal an Incan golden idol by detonating explosives in the museum it is put on display in. Corey :Corey is a New York Police Department detective who approaches Jail and Shall for help in bringing back his former lover Kat Suri. Corey has an allergy to women, breaking out in a rash when they are physically within a meter of him, and vomiting when they are right next to him. However Kat is the only woman who does not affect him in this way. Corey is chosen to lead the police team charged with stopping Jackal and Kat Suri specifically, from stealing a priceless Incan golden idol from a museum, causing intense inner conflict. Gil :Gil is the current head of Jackal, a criminal organization that aims to steal a priceless Incan golden idol that will be put on display in a New York museum. He was an orphan who was taken in by Jackal as a young boy and raised as a thief alongside Kat Suri. He tries to prevent her from leaving Jackal by having her kidnapped and ordering Camel to kill Corey. Kat Suri :Kat Suri is a highly skilled pickpocket who successfully uses her feminine wiles against her male targets. An orphan who was taken in at a young age by the criminal organization Jackal and trained as a thief, she is now considered the organization's best one. Kat initially used Corey to shelter her from three of her victims by lying to him, but grew to love him after he steadfastly defended her against them despite sustaining multiple injuries. She kept her true nature as a pickpocket secret from Corey and left him after he was promoted to detective. Lawson :The chief of the NYPD who is personally involved with tracking down a few of Jail's targets, but is unsuccessful despite his best efforts. Publication Chameleon Jail is written by Kazuhiko Watanabe and illustrated by Takehiko Inoue. It was serialized in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump from July 31 to October 16, 1989. The manga was compiled into two tank≈çbon volumes which also included three of Inoue's one shot manga stories, Purple Kaede, Flower Sh≈çnen, and Like Jordan. Chameleon Jail was later rereleased as a single volume on November 19, 2004, which included another of Inoue's one shots, Baby Face.

It is an antojito, which at first sight looks like an unusually thick tortilla with vegetables and meat toppings. The base is made from a circle of fried masa (ground maize soaked in lime, also used as the basis for tamales and tortillas) with pinched sides. This is then topped with refried beans and crumbled cheese, lettuce, onions, red or green sauce (salsa, made with chiles or tomatillos, respectively), and sour cream. Sometimes other ingredients (mostly meat) are also added to create different tastes and styles of sopes; they are roughly the size of a fist. Traditional sopes The sope has spread throughout all Mexico's territory, and thousands of regional variants are made. While the pinched sides of the sope are its most distinctive characteristic, flat sopes are made to resemble a thick tortilla or a tostada. However, though both tostadas and sopes are fried, the tostada is thin and fried until it becomes crunchy and fragile, while the sope is much thicker and fried only until the exterior surface is cooked. The sope, therefore, has a soft, slightly pliable texture. The sope's thickness is meant to support its toppings, and the frying of its exterior surface adds resistance to the moisture of the ingredients. The most common variation of the sope involves simply adding chicken and is widely known as a sope de pollo. Sopes topped with beef are also a common variation and are typically slightly larger than sopes de pollo. In the northern regions of Mexico, sopes are often prepared without vegetables, substituting black beans, spicy salsa, and longaniza or chorizo, instead. In Acapulco and Guerrero, sopes are unusually small in size, so they are called sopecitos instead, and are fried in the same oil used to fry seafood, which gives them a unique taste. Sopecitos are made of beans and salsa only; no other ingredients are added. In Oaxaca, sopes sometimes are prepared using chapulines (roasted grasshoppers) as topping. Also, an extremely large dish similar to a giant sope or a giant tostada is the traditional food of reference in Oaxaca known as tlayuda. Similar dishes The sope has been adopted and adapted to the local tastes of all Mexico's regions. This resulted in the creation of many traditional food specialties, which may appear to resemble the sope, but are considered a different dish. Huarache The most common variation is the huarache, which is prepared in almost the same manner. However, the huarache normally is two or three times as large as a sope and has a characteristic oblong shape. Huaraches are usually topped with rib, chicken, or beefsteak meat. The name huarache is derived from the shape of the masa, similar to the popular sandals. Toppings for the huarache include beans, cheese, lettuce, sour cream, ground beef, and salsa. Tlacoyo The tlacoyo is a completely different traditional Mexican dish which must not be confused with a sope, but in some regions has started to be used in a similar way, as a base on top of which are placed the same ingredients used for sopes. A tlacoyo is an oval fried or toasted cake made of masa, torpedo-shaped and a lot fatter, since it is filled with beans or cheese. Since it is similar in shape to a huarache (but smaller), and is made of the same corn as the sope and is even thicker (so it has more resistance to humid foods), Mexican street vendors decided to sell it adding toppings on it, as an alternative to the sope. However, the traditional tlacoyo it is supposed to be consumed without any toppings on it, and this form is mostly found as street food. Garnacha Garnachas are small corn tortillas fried with shredded meat, crumbled dried cheese, and salsa. In many instances, garnachas may only have chopped onion and salsa on top. Similar in appearance to sopes, they are a main specialty from Guatemala. Memela Oaxacan memelas are a local name for the identical sopes served in other parts of Mexico, just made with different toppings. Memelas are corn masa cakes topped with beans, salsa, shredded cabbage, mole negro, guacamole, and cheese. Memelas have been served at Oaxacan/Mexican restaurants in the United States since the 1990s. In Puebla, they are often served by topping the fried masa with sauce - red sauce on one side and green sauce on the other side which is called estilo bandera. Instead of meat, memelas in Puebla are served with sour cream, crumbled cheese, and diced onions on top of the red and green sauces. Chalupa A chalupa is a tostada platter in Mexican cuisine, not a sope, but its preparation method is quite similar. It is a specialty of south-central Mexico, such as the states of Puebla, Guerrero, and Oaxaca. It is made by pressing a thin layer of masa dough around the outside of a small mold and deep frying to produce a crisp, shallow corn cup. It is filled with various ingredients such as shredded chicken, pork, chopped onion, chipotle pepper, red salsa, and green salsa. The chalupa is usually longer than a sope, resembling the canoe-like boat that is its namesake, although small versions (named chalupitas) are available in other regions. An Americanized form is sold in Taco Bell restaurants, filled with ground meat, steak, or chicken, (and even bacon has also been available in past limited offers) and topped with cheese, lettuce, sour cream, and salsa (also comes in Baja style, replacing the sour cream with a Baja sauce), resembles an American taco inside, but is wrapped with deep-fried wheat flatbread. Salbutes and panuchos Yucatecan food is very different from what is traditionally referred to as \\"Mexican\\" food, as the cuisine from this region includes the local Mayan culture combined with an unusual (for the rest of the country) European cuisine influence. Salbutes and panuchos are the Yucatecan variant of the sope. Salbutes are soft, cooked tortillas with lettuce, tomato, turkey, and avocado on top. Panuchos feature tortillas partially fried as a sope base, but filled with black beans and topped with turkey or chicken, lettuce, avocado, and pickled onions. Habanero chiles accompany most dishes, either in solid or pur√©ed form, along with fresh limes or lime juice.

The company was founded in the 1920s and got its name from a hand drill, the so-called \\"Metallbohrdreher\\". Today, Metabo offers a wide range of power tools.  History  In 1923, Albrecht Schnizler built his first hand drill in his parent‚Äôs bakery in N√ºrtingen. 50,000 copies of this drill were sold under the designation No. 18 and one year later the Schnizler GmbH was founded. Co-founder Julius Closs was the owner of a brewery called ‚ÄúSonnenbrauerei‚Äù in N√ºrtingen. The company moved into the rooms of this brewery located in Church Street. Walter Rauch became an associate in 1927 and managed the national and international distribution of the machines. In 1932, the company was renamed Metabowerke Closs, Rauch & Schnizler KG. The plant was spared serious damages during the war years, but in late autumn of 1945, a fire destroyed close to 75% of the manufacturing facilities. The reconstruction was completed in 1948. The company‚Äôs rapid growth made it necessary to move to a new headquarters. Therefore, in 1953, the construction of a new plant in N√ºrtingen‚Äôs industrial zone Steinach was initiated. The relocation was completed in 1969 with a new administrative building. In the course of restructuring measures, the Metabo group acquired Elektra Beckum in 1999, a company from Meppen in Northern Germany. Combined with the takeover of two other (woodworking) machine manufacturers, this briefly made Metabo the second largest producer of stationary woodworking machines in the world. However, in the next decade, they decided to focus mostly on producing smaller power tools. In 2004, Metabo restructured the production and a plant in Shanghai was established.Metabo Shanghai The full integration of Elektra Beckum took place in 2006. In 2010, the disposal of the plant in Meppen marked the end of the restructuring process of the production plants.History of the company Metabo: History , Abruf: 9.

Roger de Saint-Lary de Termes, duc de Bellegarde (December 10, 1562July 13, 1646 in Paris), nephew of Roger de Saint-Lary de Bellegarde, was a French duke. Life Born as son to Jean de Saint-Lary (died in 1586), who was a military governor of Metz, he was brought to court by the duke of √âpernon. He quickly became a favourite of Henry III and maintained this position during the reigns of Henry IV, and Louis XIII. It was also during the reign of Henry III that he became royal master of the horse, whereas he received his title of governor of Burgundy in 1602 after his involvement against the Biron conspiracy.French Wikipedia site Roger de BellegardeJean Richard, Histoire de la Bourgogne His estate of Seurre in Burgundy was created a duchy in the peerage of France (duch√©-pairie) in his favour under the name of Bellegarde, in 1619. In 1645 the title of this duchy was transferred to the estate of Choisy-aux-Loges in G√¢tinais. He was an illustrious noble at the French court who sided with Gaston, Duke of Orl√©ans. During the very difficult years of 1629 and 1630, in which Marie de Medici and Gaston had reputadely allied against Cardinal Richelieu, there were rumours that Bellegarde kept their agreement in a precious necklace he wore at court.Moote, A. Lloyd: \\"Louis XIII, the Just\\", chap. 10 After the Day of Dupes, in 1631, when Gaston tried to rally an army against the king but failed, Bellegarde let him pass through his estates to Lorraine and yet tried afterwards to rally people in his own district against the king. Upon hearing that, the king started moving towards Burgundy with an army, so Bellegarde fled after the king had taken Dijon and had forced the Parlement to issue an edict against Gaston's followers. Bellegarde's governorship was therefore given to Henri, Prince of Cond√© (1588-1646).Moote, A.

This was a record for successful crossings by an Australian until it was overtaken by Chloe McCardel in 2016. From 1975-1979 and for a period in 1980 he held the title of King of the Channel. At the time of his death, only two other people had swum the Channel more often, Alison Streeter and Michael Read. Biography Des Renford was born on the 52nd anniversary of the very first Channel swim, achieved in 1875 by Matthew Webb. He took up marathon swimming only at the age of 39. His Channel crossings included three in 10 days in 1980. In 1977 he broke the record for swimming around Alcatraz Island by 23 minutes. He was a mentor of Susie Maroney, and led her on her first Channel crossing when she was 15. In the Queen's Birthday Honours of 12 June 1976, Renford was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE).It's an Honour He was a Papal knight of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre (the letters OHS sometimes appear after his name). He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1998. He suffered three heart attacks and a stroke, and had undergone heart surgery. He had a fourth heart attack while swimming on 29 December 1999. He went into a coma, was admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital in Sydney, and died there the following evening.

It is a crucial part of some nuclear weapons, as its role is to \\"kick-start\\" the chain reaction at the optimal moment when the configuration is prompt critical. It is also known as an internal neutron initiator. The initiator is typically placed in the center of the plutonium pit, and is activated by impact of the converging shock wave. One of the key elements in the proper operation of a nuclear weapon is initiation of the fission chain reaction at the proper time. To obtain a significant nuclear yield, sufficient neutrons must be present within the supercritical core at the right time. If the chain reaction starts too soon (\\"predetonation\\"), the result will be only a 'fizzle yield', well below the design specification, therefore low spontaneous neutron emission of the pit material is crucial. If it occurs too late, the core will have begun to expand and disassemble into a less-dense state, leading to a lowered yield (less of the core material undergoes fission) or no yield at all (the core is no longer a critical mass). For boosted fission weapons, the size of the centrally placed initiator is critical and has to be as small as possible. The use of an external neutron source allows more flexibility, such as variable yields. Design The usual design is based on a combination of beryllium-9 and polonium-210, separated until activation, then placed in intimate contact by the shock wave. Polonium-208 and actinium-227 were also considered as alpha sources. The isotope used must have strong alpha emissions and weak gamma emissions, as gamma photons can also knock neutrons loose and cannot be so efficiently shielded as alpha particles.Nuclear Weapons FAQ, Section 4.1, Version 2.04: 20 February 1999 Several variants were developed, differing by the dimensions and mechanical configuration of the system ensuring proper mixing of the metals. Urchin Urchin was the code name for the internal neutron initiator, a neutron generating device that triggered the nuclear detonation of the earliest plutonium atomic bombs such as The Gadget and Fat Man, once the critical mass had been 'assembled' by the force of conventional explosives. The initiator used in the early devices, located at the center of the bomb's plutonium pit, consisted of a beryllium pellet, and a beryllium shell with polonium between the two. The pellet, 0.8 cm in diameter, was coated with nickel and then a layer of gold. The beryllium shell was of 2 cm outer diameter with wall thickness of 0.6 cm. The inner surface of that shell had 15 concentric, wedge-shaped latitudinal grooves and was, like the inner sphere, coated with gold and nickel.The Design of Gadget, Fat Man, and \\"Joe 1\\" (RDS-1) . Cartage.org.lb. Retrieved on 2010-02-08.On the Origins of the Soviet Atomic Project. Nuclearweaponarchive.org (1998-04-15). Retrieved on 2010-02-08. A small amount of polonium-210 (50 curies, 11 mg) was deposited in the grooves of the shell and on the central sphere: the layers of gold and nickel served to shield the beryllium from alpha particles emitted by the polonium. The whole urchin weighed about 7 grams and was attached to mounting brackets in a 2.5 cm diameter inner cavity in the pit.Nuclear Weapons FAQ, Section 8.0, Version 2.18: 3 July 2007 When the shock wave from the implosion of the plutonium core arrives, it crushes the initiator. Hydrodynamic forces acting on the grooved shell thoroughly and virtually instantly mix the beryllium and polonium, allowing the alpha particles from the polonium to impinge on the beryllium atoms. Reacting to alpha particle bombardment, the beryllium atoms emit neutrons at a rate of about 1 neutron every 5‚Äì10 nanoseconds (See Beryllium#Nuclear properties). These neutrons trigger the chain reaction in the compressed supercritical plutonium. Placing the polonium layer between two large masses of beryllium ensures contact of the metals even if the shock wave turbulence performs poorly. The 50 curies of polonium generated about 0.1 watts of decay heat, noticeably warming the small sphere.4.1 Elements of Fission Weapon Design. Nuclearweaponarchive.org (1953-05-19). Retrieved on 2010-02-08. The grooves in the inner surface of the shell shaped the shock wave into jets by the Munroe effect, similar to a shaped charge, for fast and thorough mixing of the beryllium and polonium. As the Munroe effect is less reliable in linear geometry, later designs used a sphere with conical or pyramidal inner indentations instead of linear grooves. Some initiator designs omit the central sphere, being hollow instead. The advantage of a hollow design is possibly managing a smaller size while retaining reliability. The short half-life of polonium (138.376 days) required frequent replacement of initiators and a continued supply of polonium for their manufacture, as their shelf life was only about 4 months.AbrahamsonThe Sandia Pioneers. Unc.edu. Retrieved on 2010-02-08. Later designs had shelf life as long as 1 year. The US government used Postum as a code name for polonium.Injecting Polonium into Humans, Federation of American Scientists, December 12th, 2006 by Steven Aftergood Use of polonium for the neutron initiator was proposed in 1944 by Edward Condon. The initiator itself was designed by James L. Tuck, and its development and testing was carried out at Los Alamos National Laboratory in \\"Gadget\\" division's initiator group led by Charles Critchfield. Abner A different initiator (code named ABNER) was used for the Little Boy uranium bomb. Its design was simpler and it contained less polonium. It was activated by the impact of the uranium projectile to the target. It was added to the design as an afterthought and was not essential for the weapon's function.Carey Sublette, Section 8.0 The First Nuclear Weapons, The Nuclear Weapon Archive : A Guide to Nuclear Weapons (July 3, 2007). TOM initiator An improved construction of the initiator, probably based on conical or pyramidal indentations, was proposed in 1948, put into production by Los Alamos in January 1950, and tested in May 1951. The TOM design used less polonium, as the number of neutrons per milligram of polonium was higher than of the Urchin. Its outer diameter was only 1 cm. The first live fire test of a TOM initiator occurred on 28-Jan-1951 during the Baker-1 shot of Operation Ranger.http://www.stealthskater.com/Documents/Nuke_16.pdf A series of calibration experiments for initiation time vs yield data of the TOM initiators was done during the Operation Snapper, during the Fox test on 25 May 1952. Flower In 1974, India performed the Smiling Buddha nuclear test. The initiator, codenamed \\"Flower\\", was based on the same principle as the Urchin. It is believed the polonium was deposited on lotus-shaped platinum gauze to maximize its surface and enclosed in a tantalum sphere surrounded by uranium shell with embedded beryllium pellets. According to other sources, the design was yet more similar to the Urchin, with a beryllium shell shaped to create beryllium jets upon implosion. The initiator outer diameter is reported as 1.5 cm, or \\"about 2 cm\\".India's Nuclear Weapons Program ‚Äì Smiling Buddha: 1974. Nuclearweaponarchive.org. Retrieved on 2010-02-08.

Boosted fission weapons and weapons using external neutron generators offer the possibility of variable yield, allowing selection of the weapon's power depending on the tactical needs. Development The polonium used in the urchin initiator was created at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and then extracted and purified as part of the Dayton Project under the leadership of Charles Allen Thomas. The Dayton Project was one of the various sites comprising the Manhattan Project. In 1949, Mound Laboratories in nearby Miamisburg, Ohio opened as a replacement for the Dayton Project and the new home of nuclear initiator research & development.

The initiator group built test assemblies by drilling holes in large turbine ball bearings, inserting the active material, and plugging the holes with bolts. These test assemblies were known as screwballs. The test assemblies were imploded and their remains studied to examine how well the polonium and beryllium mixed.The Making of the Atomic Bomb, Richard Rhodes, 1986, Simon & Schuster, p. 580 W76 Neutron Tubes The production of the beryllium-polonium TOM initiators ended in 1953.

Urchin style initiators were later superseded by other means of generating neutrons such as pulsed neutron emitters that do not use polonium. Using tritium with a half-life of 12.3 years instead of polonium they have a much longer replacement interval. These are mounted outside the pit and electrically controlled, since neutrons easily pass through considerable mass without interactions. These initiators were more controllable and enable much improved weapon reliability.

Pfister studied theology, philosophy and psychology at the University of Zurich and the University of Basel, graduating in 1898 in the philosophical faculty. He then became a pastor, serving in Wald (canton of Z√ºrich) until 1920. He is remembered for his efforts involving the application of psychoanalysis to the science of education, as well as his belief system in a synthesis of psychology and theology. Pfister was a pioneer of modern Swiss psychology, belonging to a psychoanalytical circle in Zurich that was centered on Eugen Bleuler and Carl Jung. In 1919, he formed the Swiss Society for Psychoanalysis. Although the psychiatrist Emil Oberholzer founded a separate Swiss Medical Society for Psychoanalysis in 1928, Pfister stuck with the group he had started, defending Sigmund Freud's position on lay analysis that Oberholzer's group rejected.Paul Roazen, \\"Introductory Note\\" to Pfister, \\"The Illusion of a Future: A Friendly Disagreement with Prof. Sigmund Freud\\", International Journal of Psycho- Analysis 74 (1993), pp. 557‚Äì58. Pfister was an early associate of Freud, maintaining an ongoing correspondence with him from 1909 to 1939 (the year of Freud's death). Pfister believed that theology and psychology were compatible disciplines and advocated the concept of a \\"Christian Eros\\". He was especially interested in Freud's concepts of the Oedipus Complex, castration anxiety and infantile sexuality. From a religious standpoint, Pfister advocated a return to what he saw as the original fundamental teachings of Jesus Christ.

Early life Ahmad Yani was born in Jenar, Purworejo, Central Java on 19 June 1922 to the Wongsoredjo family, a family that worked at a sugar factory run by a Dutch owner. In 1927, Yani moved with his family to Batavia, where his father now worked for a Dutch General. At Batavia, Yani worked his way through primary and secondary education. In 1940, Yani left high school to undergo compulsory military service in the Army of the Dutch East Indies colonial government. He initially trained to be a navy seaman. He studied military topography in Malang, East Java, but this education was interrupted by the arrival of the invading Japanese in 1942. At the same time, Yani and his family moved back to Central Java. In 1943, he joined the Japanese sponsored Peta army, and underwent further training in Magelang as an artillery officer. After completing this training, Yani enlisted to be trained as a Peta platoon commander and was transferred to Bogor, West Java to receive his training. Upon completion, he was sent back to Magelang as an instructor. Career with the Indonesian military Col. Yani leading a briefing on 12 April 1958 during Operation 17 August After Independence Yani joined the army of the fledgling republic and fought against the Dutch. During the first months after the Declaration of Independence, Yani formed a battalion with himself as Commander and led it to victory against the British at Magelang. Yani then followed this up by successfully defending Magelang against the Dutch when it tried to take over the city, earning him the nickname of the \\"Savior of Magelang\\". Another notable highlight of Yani's career during this time period was the series of guerilla offensives he launched in early 1949 to distract the Dutch whilst Lieutenant Colonel Suharto prepared for the 1 March General Offensive which was to be directed at Yogyakarta and its suburbs. After Indonesia's independence was recognized by the Dutch, Yani was transferred to Tegal, Central Java. In 1952, he was called back into action to fight the Darul Islam, a group of rebels seeking to establish a theocracy in Indonesia. To deal with this rebel group, Yani formed a special forces group called the Banteng Raiders (today the 400th Raider Infantry Battalion, Kodam IV/Diponegoro). The decision to call in Yani paid dividends and over the next 3 years, Darul Islam forces in Central Java suffered one defeat after another. In December 1955, Yani left for the United States to study at the Command and General staff College, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Returning in 1956, Yani was transferred to the Army Headquarters in Jakarta where he became a staff member for General Abdul Haris Nasution. At the Army Headquarters, Yani served as Logistics Assistant to the Army Chief of Staff before becoming Deputy Army Chief of Staff for Organization and Personnel. In August 1958, he commanded Operation 17 August against the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia rebels in West Sumatra. His troops managed to recapture Padang and Bukittinggi, and this success led to his being promoted to 2nd deputy Army chief of staff on 1 September 1962, and then Army chief of staff on 13 November 1963 (automatically becoming a member of the cabinet), replacing General Nasution, who was appointed Minister of Defence. Final years Plaque marking the place when Yani fell after being shot by members of the 30 September Movement ‚Äì his former home is now a museum. Note the bullet holes in the door. As President Sukarno moved closer to the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) in the early 60s, Yani, who was strongly anti-communist, became very wary of the PKI, especially after the party declared its support for the establishment of a fifth force (in addition to the three armed services and the police) and Sukarno tried to impose his Nasakom (Nationalism-Religion- Communism) doctrine on the military. Both Yani and Nasution procrastinated when ordered by Sukarno on 31 May 1965 to prepare plans to arm the people. In the early hours of 1 October 1965, the 30 September Movement attempted to kidnap seven members of the Army general staff. A squad of about 200 men surrounded Yani's home at Latuhahary Street No. 6 in the Jakarta suburb of Menteng. Usually Yani had eleven troops guarding his home. His wife later reported that a week before an additional six men were assigned to him. These men were from the command of Colonel Latief, who unknown to Yani, was one of the main plotters in 30 September Movement. According to Yani's wife, the additional men did not appear for duty on that night. Yani and his children were asleep in his house while his wife was out celebrating her birthday by staying out with a group of friends and relatives. She later recounted that as she drove away from the home at about 11 pm, she noticed someone sitting in the shadows across the street as if keeping the house under observation. She thought nothing of it at the time, but following the events later that morning she wondered differently. Also, from about 9 pm on the evening of 30 September a number of phone calls were made to the house at intervals, which when answered would be met with silence or a voice would ask what time it was. The calls continued until about 1 am and Mrs Yani said she had a premonition something was wrong that night.Hughes (2002), pp. 42‚Äì47 Yani spent the evening with official callers; at 7 pm he received a colonel from the Supreme Operations Command. General Basuki Rahmat, divisional commander in East Java, then arrived from his headquarters in Surabaya. Basuki had come to Jakarta to report to Yani on his concerns about increasing communist activity in East Java. Complimenting his report, Yani asked him to accompany him to his meeting the following morning with the President to relay his account.Hughes (2002), pp. 44‚Äì45 When the kidnappers came to Yani's home and told him that he was to be brought before the president, he asked for time to bathe and change his clothes. When this was refused he became angry, slapped one of the kidnapper soldiers, and tried to shut the front door of his house. One of the kidnappers then opened fire, killing the general. His body was taken to Lubang Buaya on the outskirts of Jakarta and, together with those of the other murdered generals, was hidden in a disused well. Yani's body, and those of the other victims, was disinterred on 4 October, and all were given a state funeral the next day, before being buried at the Hero's Cemetery at Kalibata. On the same day, Yani and his colleagues were officially declared Heroes of the Revolution by Presidential Decision No. 111/KOTI/1965 and his rank was raised posthumously from lieutenant general to a 4-star general (). Mrs Yani and her children moved out of the home after Yani's death. Mrs Yani helped make their former home into a public museum which stands largely as it was in October 1965, including bullet holes in the door and walls, and with the home's furnishings of the time. Today, many Indonesian cities have roads named after Yani, and Semarang's Ahmad Yani International Airport is named after him. ReferencesFurther reading * Bachtiar, Harsja W.

It is located on Academy Street just off US 9. Detailed plans for a landscape and complex of farm buildings were drawn up by the influential Andrew Jackson Downing prior to his death. The landscaping was completed and remains Downing's only surviving work, but only a few of the buildings were ever built and most have since been lost to fire and structural failure. A cottage where Vassar resided, Downing's only known surviving building, had to be dismantled and removed in the mid-1970s. Its facade is on display in the New York State Museum. Downing's landscape, in the English Landscape Garden style, has survived several serious efforts to redevelop the property in the last half-century due to opposition from local preservationists. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Matthew Vassar Estate, and further it was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1969, and but the estate was not permanently protected for almost two decades, when a lawsuit was settled with the transfer of the land to its current owners, Springside Landscape Restoration. History Springside's development took up much of the last two years of Downing's life, and the latter years of Vassar's. The unfinished estate was maintained and developed by several other families for a century afterward. Their descendants were more amenable to selling the land for development in the years afterward, which led in turn to the efforts to protect and restore it. Downing's original site plan. Planning and development under Vassar The Springside property was the \\"Allen farm\\", first a family farm, then an ornamental farm of roughly 45 acres (18 ha), twice its current size. It takes its name from a spring on the property. It was considered as a site for a cemetery by the then-village of Poughkeepsie in 1848. Vassar, a village trustee and founder of the nearby college that bears his name, bought the property from its last owner George Bloom Evertson Platt, Edmund. The Eagle's History of Poughkeepsie: From the Earliest Settlements 1683 to 1905. Poughkeepsie, NY 1905, page 282. for $8,000, intending to sell subscriptions to future plots at the cemetery to local investors, a common practice at the time. However, there were few takers.\\"Cemetery Meeting\\", Poughkeepsie Eagle; June 1, 1850; cited at Vassar Encyclopedia. He had planned to develop the property as a private summer estate himself if the cemetery plan failed, and so he contracted Downing, who lived downriver in Newburgh, to begin planning the landscape for the property. By 1851, Downing, in collaboration with his associate Calvert Vaux and Vassar, had detailed landscape plans ready. The next year, the city of Poughkeepsie chose another site for the cemetery, ending that possibility. Downing's death in a steamboat boiler explosion the following year did not halt development, as Vassar and Vaux continued along the lines Downing had established. At least two of Downing's planned structures, a barn and a gardeners' cottage, were built, and he eventually invested $100,000 in developing the site. However, the central villa that was to be the main house of the estate, a Gothic Revival work by Downing and Vaux, was abandoned (although artists' renderings survive), since Vassar preferred the cottage as a residence. Main house planned but never built As Springside continued to grow and develop, Vassar regularly opened the lands to the public until he retired to it full-time in 1867, the year before his death. It became a popular place to visit and inspired poetry and songs. One visitor, Russell Comstock, wrote: After Vassar After Vassar's death, the lands were divided among several other local families, who continued to work the landscape. Judge Homer Nelson, New York's Secretary of State, bought the southern half of the property and renamed it Hudson Knolls. He lived elsewhere while a boardinghouse operated on the site. The northern half was purchased by local shoe manufacturer John Whitehouse, who merged it with his own adjoining property to the west of the site, retaining the Springside name. It passed to his son-in-law Eugene Howell upon his death, who kept up the landscape, at one point using it as a golf course, despite the failure of the shoe factory in 1891.Helen Myers; \\"Springside Site Developed by Vassar Had Many Famous Owners in Past Century,\\" Poughkeepsie Sunday New Yorker; September 21, 1952; 192, 235, 260; cited at Vassar Encyclopedia. The gardener's cottage, since dismantled and removed. In 1901, the property was reunified under the ownership of William Nelson, who had previously purchased the southern half when Judge Nelson (to whom he was not related) died in 1881, bought Howells' half following the shoe heir's bankruptcy. Nelson, the founder of the Red Ball Line shipping company, lived in the former boardinghouse with his family. He bequeathed it to his wife, and she in turn passed it on to their children. The two daughters and son kept the property in the family and lived in various of its buildings. Gerald Nelson moved his family into the Hudson Knolls mansion, which Homer Nelson's widow had built anew in 1911 after the former boardinghouse had succumbed to a fire three years previously. Gertrude Nelson Fitzpatrick and her husband lived in the cottage, while her sister Geraldine Acker built Spring Gable for themselves in 1929 on the site where Downing had intended for Springside's main house. Late 20th-century preservation Facade at New York State Museum The gatehouse, restored to its original colors The combination of private ownership and benign neglect had preserved much of Downing and Vassar's original design for a century. This situation would change as Poughkeepsie experienced rapid growth in the years after World War II. In 1952 development pressure began when the Poughkeepsie City School District considered Springside as a site for a new high school. In the 1960s, historic preservation efforts started in response to increasing development in the area led to the estate being declared a National Historic Landmark (NHL) in 1969. The NHL designation could not protect the barn complex from being totally destroyed by arson later that month,\\"Arson Claims Buildings at Springside,\\" Poughkeepsie Journal; August 18, 1969; cited at Vassar Encyclopedia. and the other buildings suffered from continued decay and neglect. Development threats continued as the landowner, developer Robert Ackerman, persuaded the city to rezone the property to make it more amenable to the luxury apartment complex he planned to build.\\"City Planners Recommend 'Springside' Rezoning,\\" Poughkeepsie Journal; October 29, 1970' cited at Vassar Encyclopedia. He pledged to protect the gatehouse and cottage, but the landscaping would have substantially altered Downing's original design.\\"New 'Springside' Plan Features Apartment, Historical Preservation\\", Poughkeepsie Journal; October 21, 1970. The cottage facade was removed to an Albany warehouse by state order to preserve it in 1976;P. Sleight, \\"Piece of City's Heritage Spirited Away to Albany,\\" Poughkeepsie Journal; December 28, 1976; cited at Vassar Encyclopedia. a quarter-century later it was put on display at the State Museum. Only the foundation clearing remains at the site. In 1982, a nearby condominium complex proposed nearby, and approved by the city, would have cleared most of Downing's remaining landscape. A lawsuit two years later alleging an insufficient environmental impact statement was settled in 1986 with the development of the farm portion of the property, close to Route 9 and the river, while the remaining landscape donated to a newly established non- profit organization, Springside Landscape Preservation, which continues to maintain the property. It took formal title to the land in 1990. Today, only the Carpenter Gothic gatehouse, a building not found on the original plans, survives. It has been restored to its original colors and is still used as a private residence. Aesthetics Landscape and curving pathway near cottage site Downing had become a bestselling writer by expounding on his theories of combining that which was beautiful in nature and art. The buildings at Springside, both planned and built, used consciously rustic board-and-batten siding, emphasized by some of the thousand trees he had transplanted from nearby forests. On the ground, the curving pathways follow the contours of the land beneath them and lead to scenic views, sometimes created by planting evergreens around rock outcrops Statuary embellishments unite the buildings and grounds, and Downing took advantage of the property's natural drainage to create streams and fountains. Above the spring that gave the property its name, later itself named Willow Spring by Vassar, he placed a statue of a dog, since replaced by one of a young maiden. Ponds, too, were created, their irregular, natural shapes accentuated by similarly-shaped islands. Many of these features that Downing pioneered were later replicated by Vaux and his fellow associate of Downing's, Frederick Law Olmsted, in their designs for Central Park and other major parks in American cities. Today, with most of the buildings no longer extant on the site, the landscape still largely reflects Downing's original plan. Some secondary vegetation has grown in, but the pathways have been restored and many of the original trees remain.

It is the second largest wine appellation of origin in the United States (only the Upper Mississippi Valley is larger) with (67,300 km2) in portions of the states of Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia. The area is mostly planted with hybrid grapes like Baco noir, Marechal Foch, Seyval blanc and Vidal. Of the Vitis vinifera found in the area Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Petit Manseng and Riesling are the most common. History The Ohio River Valley AVA is the birthplace of American viticulture. Wine has been produced in Ohio since 1823 when Nicholas Longworth planted the first Alexander and Isabella grapes in the Ohio River Valley. In 1825, Longworth planted the first Catawba grapes in Ohio. Others soon planted Catawba in new vineyards throughout the state and by 1860, Catawba was the most important grape variety in Ohio. At this time, Ohio produced more wine than any other state in the country, and Cincinnati was the most important city in the national wine trade. Of the 570,000 gallons of wine that were produced each year in Ohio, 200,000 came from Brown County.City Beat (2009).\\"Bottle Shock in Ripley\\". Retrieved 2009-08-04. In the 1800s, wine was expensive, so non-trellised vines succumbed to fungal diseases. Horses could farm the narrow ridges, but tractors could not. Tobacco farming became profitable. And as in many other states, Prohibition in the United States destroyed the Ohio wine industry, which has struggled to recover. Climate and geology The Ohio River is a climatic transition area as its water runs along the periphery of the humid subtropical climate and humid continental climate thereby being inhabited by fauna and flora of both climates. The hardiness zones are 6b and 7a. The Ohio River is young from a geologic standpoint. The river formed on a piecemeal basis beginning between 2.5 and 3 million years ago. The earliest Ice Ages occurred at this time and dammed portions of north flowing rivers. The Teays River was the largest of these rivers, and the modern Ohio River flows within segments of the ancient Teays. The ancient rivers were rearranged or consumed by glaciers and lakes. The vineyard soils of the Ohio River Valley are diverse, being on the boundary between glaciated and non-glaciated.

The Mongol conquest of China was a series of major military efforts by the Mongol Empire to invade China proper. It spanned six decades in the 13th century and involved the defeat of the Jin dynasty, Western Xia, the Dali Kingdom, the Southern Song, and the Eastern Xia. The Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan started the conquest with small-scale raids into Western Xia in 1205 and 1207. By 1279, the Mongol leader Kublai Khan had established the Yuan dynasty in China and crushed the last Song resistance, which marked the onset of all of China under the Mongol Yuan rule. This was the first time in history that the whole of China was conquered and subsequently ruled by a foreign or non-native ruler.Hugh D. Walker \\"Traditional Sino-Korean Diplomatic Relations : A Realistic Historical Appraisal\\", Monumenta Serica, Vol. 24 (1965), pp. 155‚Äì16, (p.159)  Conquest of Western Xia  In the early 1200s, Temujin, soon to be Genghis Khan, began consolidating his power in Mongolia. Following the death of the Kerait leader Ong Khan to Temujin's emerging Mongol Empire in 1203, Kerait leader Nilqa Senggum led a small band of followers into Western Xia, also known as Xi-Xia. However, after his adherents took to plundering the locals, Nilqa Senggum was expelled from Western Xia territory. Using his rival Nilga Senggum's temporary refuge in Western Xia as a pretext, Temujin launched a raid against the state in 1205 in the Edsin region.C. P. Atwood Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, p.590 The Mongols plundered border settlements and one local Western Xia noble accepted Mongol supremacy.J. Bor Mongol hiigeed Eurasiin diplomat shashtir, vol.II, p.204 The next year, 1206, Temujin was formally proclaimed Genghis Khan, ruler of all the Mongols, marking the official start of the Mongol Empire. In 1207, Genghis led another raid into Western Xia, invading the Ordo region and sacking Wuhai, the main garrison along the Yellow River, before withdrawing in 1208. In 1209, the Genghis undertook a larger campaign to secure the submission of Western Xia. After defeating a force led by Kao Liang-Hui outside Wuhai, Genghis captured the city and pushed up along the Yellow River, defeated several cities, and besieged the capital, Yinchuan, which held a well-fortified garrison of 150,000.Jack Weatherford Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World, p.85 The Mongols, at this point inexperienced at siege warfare, attempted to flood out the city by diverting the Yellow River, but the dike they built to accomplish this broke and flooded the Mongol camp. Nevertheless, Emperor Li Anquan, still threatened by the Mongols and receiving no relief from the Jin dynasty, agreed to submit to Mongol rule, and demonstrated his loyalty by giving a daughter, Chaka, in marriage to Genghis and paying a tribute of camels, falcons, and textiles. After their defeat in 1210, Western Xia served as faithful vassals to the Mongol Empire for almost a decade, aiding the Mongols in their war against the Jin dynasty. In 1219, Genghis Khan launched his campaign against the Khwarazmian dynasty in Central Asia, and requested military aid from Western Xia. However, the emperor and his military commander Asha refused to take part in the campaign, stating that if Genghis had too few troops to attack Khwarazm, then he had no claim to supreme power. Infuriated, Genghis swore vengeance and left to invade Khwarazm, while Western Xia attempted alliances with the Jin and Song dynasties against the Mongols. After defeating Khwarazm in 1221, Genghis prepared his armies to punish Western Xia for their betrayal, and in 1225 he attacked with a force of approximately 180,000. After taking Khara-Khoto, the Mongols began a steady advance southward. Asha, commander of the Western Xia troops, could not afford to meet the Mongols as it would involve an exhausting westward march from the capital Yinchuan through 500 kilometers of desert, and so the Mongols steadily advanced from city to city. Enraged by Western Xia's fierce resistance, Genghis engaged the countryside in annihilative warfare and ordered his generals to systematically destroy cities and garrisons as they went. Genghis divided his army and sent general Subutai to take care of the westernmost cities, while the main force under Genghis moved east into the heart of the Western Xia Empire and took Ganzhou, which was spared destruction upon its capture due to it being the hometown of Genghis's commander Chagaan. In August 1226, Mongol troops approached Wuwei, the second-largest city of the Western Xia empire, which surrendered without resistance in order to escape destruction. In Autumn 1226, Genghis took Liangchow, crossed the Helan Shan desert, and in November lay siege to Lingwu, a mere 30 kilometers from Yinchuan.Hartog 2004, pg. 134 Here, in the Battle of Yellow River, the Mongols destroyed a force of 300,000 Western Xia that launched a counter-attack against them. Genghis reached Yinchuan in 1227, laid siege to the city, and launched several offensives into Jin to prevent them from sending reinforcements to Western Xia, with one force reaching as a far as Kaifeng, the Jin capital. Yinchuan lay besieged for about six months, after which Genghis opened up peace negotiations while secretly planning to kill the emperor. During the peace negotiations, Genghis continued his military operations around the Liupan mountains near Guyuan, rejected an offer of peace from the Jin, and prepared to invade them near their border with the Song. However, in August 1227, Genghis died of a historically uncertain cause, and, in order not to jeopardize the ongoing campaign, his death was kept a secret. In September 1227, Emperor Mozhu surrendered to the Mongols and was promptly executed. The Mongols then mercilessly pillaged Yinchuan, slaughtered the city's population, plundered the imperial tombs west of the city, and completed the effective annihilation of the Western Xia state. Conquest of Jin dynasty The siege of Zhongdu (modern Beijing) in 1213‚Äì14. One of the major goals of Genghis Khan was the conquest of the Jin dynasty, allowing the Mongols to avenge the earlier death of a Mongol Khan, gain the riches of northern China and to establish the Mongols as a major power in the East-Asian world. Genghis Khan declared war in 1211, and while Mongols were victorious in the field, they were frustrated in their efforts to take major cities. In his typically logical and determined fashion, Genghis and his highly developed staff studied the problems of the assault of fortifications. With the help of Chinese engineers, they gradually developed the techniques to take down fortifications. This eventually would make troops under the Mongols some of the most accomplished and most successful besiegers in the history of warfare. As a result of a number of overwhelming victories in the field and a few successes in the capture of fortifications deep within China, Genghis had conquered and consolidated Jin territory as far south as the Great Wall by 1213. Cherik soldiers were non-nomad soldiers in the Mongol military. Jin defectors and Han Chinese conscripts were recruited into new armies formed by the Mongols as they destroyed the Jin dynasty. A critical role in the defeat of the Jin was carried out by the Han Chinese cherik forces. Han Chinese defectors led by General Liu Bolin defending Tiancheng from the Jin in 1214 while Genghis Khan was busy going back north. In 1215 Xijing fell to Liu Bolin's army. The original Han cherik forces were created in 1216 and Liu Bolin appointed as their leading officer. As Han troops kept defecting from the Jin to the Mongols the size of Han cherik forces swelled and they had to be partitioned between different units. Han soldiers made up the majority of the Khitan Yelu Tuhua's army, while Juyin soldiers from Zhongdu made up Chalaer's army and Khitan made up Uyar's army. Chalaer, Yelu Tuhua and Uyar led three cherik armies in northern China under the Mongol commander Muqali in addition to his tamma armies in 1217‚Äì1218. Many Han Chinese and Khitan defected to the Mongols to fight against the Jin.

The three Khitan Generals Shimobeidier (), Tabuyir () and Xiao Zhongxi () commanded the three Khitan Tumens and the four Han Generals Zhang Rou, Yan Shi, Shi Tianze, and Liu Heima commanded the four Han tumens under Og√∂dei Khan. Shi Tianze (Shih T'ien-tse), (Chang Jou, ), and (Yen Shih, ) and other high ranking Chinese who served in the Jin dynasty and defected to the Mongols helped build the structure for the administration of the new state.Chan, Hok-Lam. 1997. ‚ÄúA Recipe to Qubilai Qa'an on Governance: The Case of Chang Te-hui and Li Chih‚Äù. Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society 7 (2). Cambridge University Press: 257‚Äì83. https://www.jstor.org/stable/25183352. The Mongols received defections from Han Chinese and Khitans while the Jin were abandoned by their own Jurchen officers. Interethnic marriage between Han and Jurchen became common at this time. The Han Chinese General Shi Tianze's father Shi Bingzhi (Âè≤ÁßâÁõ¥, Shih Ping- chih) were married to a Jurchen womaned. de Rachewiltz 1993, p. 41. Shi Tianze was married to two Jurchen women (Mo-nien and Na-ho), a Han Chinese woman (Shi), and a Korean woman (Li), and his son Shi Gang was born to one of his Jurchen wives and the family served the Yuan prominently.Kinoshita 2013, p. 47. and Shi Gang married a Kerait woman, the Kerait were Mongolified Turkic people and part of the \\"Mongol nation\\".Watt 2010, p. 14.Kinoshita 2013, p. 47. Genghis advanced with three armies into the heart of Jin territory, between the Great Wall and the Yellow River. With the help of Chenyu Liu, one of the top officers who betrayed Jin, as well as the Southern Song, who wanted revenge on Jin, Genghis defeated the Jin forces, devastated northern China, captured numerous cities, and in 1215 besieged, captured and sacked the Jin capital of Yanjing (modern-day Beijing). However, the Jin emperor, Xuan Zong, did not surrender, but moved his capital to Kaifeng. The city fell in the siege of Kaifeng in 1232. Emperor Aizong fled to the town of Caizhou. After this, the Han Chinese general Shi Tianze led troops to pursue Emperor Aizong as he retreated, and destroyed an 80,000-strong Jin army led by Wanyan Chengyi (ÂÆåÈ°èÊâøË£î) at Pucheng (Ëí≤Âüé). The Jin dynasty collapsed after the siege of Caizhou in 1234. Eastern Xia, an short-lived kingdom which declared independence from Jin in 1215, was conquered in 1233. The first Han armies in the Mongol army were those led by defecting individual officers. There were 1,000 Han (Chinese) troops each in 26 units which made up three tumeds arranged by Ogedei Khan on a decimal system. The Han officer Shi Tianze, Han officer Liu Ni and the Khitan officer Xiao Chala, all three of whom defected to the Mongols from the Jin led these three tumeds. Chang Jung, Yen Shi and Chung Jou led three additional tumeds which were created before 1234. The Han defectors were called the \\"Black Army\\" (Hei Jun) by the Mongols before 1235. A new infantry based \\"New Army\\" (Xin Jun) was created after the Mongols received 95,000 additional Han soldiers through conscription once the 1236 and 1241 censuses were taken after the Jin was crushed. Han cherik forces were used to fight against Li Tan's revolt in 1262. The New Army and Black Army had hereditary officer posts like the Mongol army itself. The Mongols valued physicians, craftsmen and religious clerics and ordered them to be spared from death and brought to them when cities were taken in northern China.  Conquest of Dali Kingdom  M√∂ngke Khan dispatched Kublai to the Dali Kingdom in 1253 to outflank the Song. The Gao family dominated the court, resisted and murdered Mongol envoys. The Mongols divided their forces into three. One wing rode eastward into the Sichuan basin. The second column under Uryankhadai took a difficult way into the mountains of western Sichuan.John Man Kublai Khan, p.79 Kublai himself headed south over the grasslands, meeting up with the first column. While Uryankhadai galloping in along the lakeside from the north, Kublai took the capital city of Dali and spared the residents despite the slaying of his ambassadors. The Dali King () himself defected to the Mongols, who used his troops to conquer the rest of Yunnan. The Mongols appointed King Duan Xingzhi as Maharajah and stationed a pacification commissioner there.C. P. Atwood Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongols, p.613 After Kublai's departure, unrest broke out among the Black Jang (one of the main ethnic groups of the Dali kingdom). By 1256, Uryankhadai, the son of Subutai had completely pacified Yunnan. The Duan family were originally Han Chinese from Wuwei in Gansu. The Duan family still ruled Dali relatively independently during the Yuan dynasty. The Ming abolished them. The Tusi chieftains and local tribe leaders and kingdoms in Yunnan, Guizhou and Sichuan submitted to Yuan rule and were allowed to keep their titles. The Han Chinese Yang family ruling the Chiefdom of Bozhou which was recognized by the Song dynasty and Tang dynasty also received recognition by the Mongols in the Yuan dynasty and later by the Ming dynasty. The Luo clan in Shuixi led by Ahua were recognized by the Yuan emperors, as they were by the Song emperors when led by Pugui and Tang emperors when led by Apei. They descended from the Shu Han era king Huoji who helped Zhuge Liang against Meng Huo. They were also recognized by the Ming dynasty.  Capitulation of Nobles and Tusi vassal chiefdoms in southwestern China  Many Tusi chiefdoms and kingdoms in southwestern China which existed before the Mongol invasions were allowed to retain their integrity as vassals of the Yuan dynasty after surrendering, including the Kingdom of Dali, the Han Chinese Yang family ruling the Chiefdom of Bozhou with its seat at the castle Hailongtun, Chiefdom of Lijiang, Chiefdom of Shuidong, Chiefdom of Sizhou, Chiefdom of Yao'an, Chiefdom of Yongning and Mu'ege. As were Korea under Mongol rule and the Kingdom of Qocho. The Han Chinese nobles Duke Yansheng and Celestial Masters continued possessing their titles in the Yuan dynasty since the previous dynasties.  Use of Chinese soldiers in other campaigns During their campaigns, the Mongol Empire recruited many nationalities in their warfare, such as those of Central and East Asia.Reuven Amitai-Preiss Mongols and Mamluks: The Mamluk-Ilkhanid War, 1260‚Äì1281 p. 189Angus Donal Stewart The Armenian kingdom and the Mamluks, p. 54Michael Biran The empire of the Qara Khitai in Eurasian history: between China and the Islam, p.143Stepehen Turnball The Mongol Invasions of Japan 1274 and 1281, p.72Peter Jackson The Mongols and the West, p.86 The Mongols employed Chinese troops, especially those who worked catapults and gunpowder to assist them in other conquests. In addition to Chinese troops, many scholars and doctors from China accompanied Mongol commanders to the west. The Mongols valued people with specialized skills. The ability to make cast iron which was tough enough for shooting objects with gunpowder was available to the Chinese in the Song dynasty and it was adopted by the Liao, Jin, and Yuan dynasties. During the invasion of Transoxiana in 1219, along with the main Mongol force, Genghis Khan used a Chinese specialist catapult unit in battle. They were used in Transoxania again in 1220. The Chinese may have used the catapults to hurl gunpowder bombs, since they already had them by this time (although there were other siege engineers and technologies used in the campaigns, too.The Devil's Horsemen: The Mongol Invasion of Europe by James Chambers, p.71) While Genghis Khan was conquering Transoxania and Central Asia, several Chinese who were familiar with gunpowder were serving with Genghis's army. \\"Whole regiments\\" entirely made out of Chinese were used by the Mongols to command bomb hurling trebuchets during the invasion of Iran. Historians have suggested that the Mongol invasion had brought Chinese gunpowder weapons to Central Asia. One of these was the huochong, a Chinese mortar. Books written around the area afterward depicted the use of gunpowder weapons which resembled that of China. One thousand northern Chinese engineer squads accompanied the Mongol Hulagu Khan during his conquest of the Middle East. 1,000 Chinese participated in the Siege of Baghdad (1258). The Chinese General Guo Kan was one of the commanders during the siege and appointed Governor of Baghdad after the city was taken.Original from the University of Michigan (Original from the University of Michigan) While serving in the Mongol armies, Chinese generals were able to observe the invasion of West Asia. According to Ata-Malik Juvayni during the assault on the Alamut Assassins fort, \\"Khitayan\\" built siege weapons resembling crossbows were used. \\"Khitayan\\" meant Chinese and it was a type of arcuballista, deployed in 1256 under Hulagu's command. Stones were knocked off the castle and the bolts \\"burnt\\" a great number of the Assassins. They could fire a distance around 2,500 paces. The device was described as an ox's bow.Wright, David C. \\"The Sung-Kitan War of A.D. 1004‚Äì1005 and the Treaty of Shan-Y√ºan.\\" Journal of Asian History, vol. 32, no. 1, 1998, p. 20. . Pitch which was lit on fire was applied to the bolts of the weapon before firing. Another historian thinks that instead gunpowder might have been strapped onto the bolts which caused the burns during the battle recorded by Juvayini. Alans were recruited into the Mongol forces with one unit called \\"Right Alan Guard\\" which was combined with \\"recently surrendered\\" soldiers, Mongols, and Chinese soldiers stationed in the area of the former Kingdom of Qocho and in Besh Balikh the Mongols established a Chinese military colony led by Chinese general Qi Kongzhi (Ch'i Kung-chih).  Siege policy  James Waterson cautioned against attributing the population drop in northern China to Mongol slaughter since much of the population may have moved to southern China under the Southern Song or died of disease and famine as agricultural and urban city infrastructure were destroyed. The Mongols spared cities from massacre and sacking if they surrendered, like Kaifeng which was surrendered to Subetai by Xu Li, Yangzhou, which was surrendered to Bayan by Li Tingzhi's second in command after Li Tingzhi was executed by the Southern Song, and Hangzhou, which was spared from sacking when it surrendered to Kublai Khan. Han Chinese and Khitan soldiers defected en masse to Genghis Khan against the Jurchen Jin dynasty. Towns which surrendered were spared from sacking and massacre by Kublai Khan. The Khitan reluctantly left their homeland in Manchuria as the Jin moved their primary capital from Beijing south to Kaifeng and defected to the Mongols.  Use of other conquered non-Mongol peoples  Against the Alans and the Cumans (Kipchaks), the Mongols used divide and conquer tactics: first the Mongols told the Cumans to stop allying with the Alans and then, after the Cumans followed their suggestion, the Mongols defeated the AlansHalperin, Charles J.. 2000. ‚ÄúThe Kipchak Connection: The Ilkhans, the Mamluks and Ayn Jalut‚Äù. Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London 63 (2). Cambridge University Press: 235. . and then attacked the Cumans.Sinor, Denis. 1999. \\"The Mingols in the West\\". Journal of Asian History, 33 (1). Harrassowitz Verlag: 1‚Äì44. . Alan and Kipchak guards were used by Kublai Khan. In 1368 at the end of the Yuan dynasty in China Toghan Tem√ºr was accompanied by his faithful Alan guards. \\"Mangu enlisted in his bodyguard half the troops of the Alan prince, Arslan, whose younger son Nicholas took a part in the expedition of the Mongols against Karajang (Yunnan). This Alan imperial guard was still in existence in 1272, 1286 and 1309, and it was divided into two corps with headquarters in the Ling pei province (Karakor√∫m).\\" Alans were converted to Roman Catholic Christianity as were Armenians in China by John of Montecorvino.  Conquest of Southern Song  At second, the Mongols allied with Southern Song as both had a common enemy in the form of Jin. However, this alliance broke down with the destruction of Jur'chen Jin in 1234. After Song forces captured the former Northern Song capitals of Luoyang, Chang'an and Kaifeng from the Mongols and the Song had killed a Mongol ambassador, the Mongols declared war on the Song. Very quickly the Mongol armies forced the Song back to the Yangtze, although the two sides would be engaged in a four- decade war until the fall of the Song in 1276. Islamic engineers joined later and especially contributed counterweight trebuchets, \\"Muslim phao\\", which had a maximum range of 300 meters compared to 150 meters of the ancient Chinese predecessor. It played a significant role in taking the Chinese strongholds and was as well used against infantry units on the battlefield. The Mongol force which invaded south China was far greater than the force they sent to invade the Middle East in 1256. The Mongols made heavy use of indigenous ethnic minority soldiers in southern China rather than Mongols. The Kingdom of Dali's indigenous Cuan-Bo army led by the Duan royal family were the majority of the forces in the Mongol Yuan army sent to attack Song China during battles along the Yangtze river. During a Mongol attack against the Song China, there were only 3,000 Mongol cavalry at one point under the Mongol commander Uriyangkhadai, the majority of his army were native Cuan-Bo with Duan officers. Alt URL While the Mongol forces had success against the non-Han Chinese ruled states of the Jin and Xia, conquering the Song took much more time. The Song forces were equipped with the best technology available at the time, such as an ample supply of gunpowder weapons like fire lances, rockets and flamethrowers. The fierce resistance of the Song forces resulted in the Mongols having to fight the most difficult war in all of their conquests, and the Mongols required every advantage they could gain and \\"every military artifice known at that time\\" in order to win. They looked to peoples they already conquered to acquire various military advantages. However, intrigues at the Song court would favor the Mongols. The Yuan dynasty created a \\"Han Army\\" () out of defected Jin troops and army of defected Song troops called the \\"Newly Submitted Army\\" ().Hucker 1985, p.66. Southern Song Chinese troops who defected and surrendered to the Mongols were granted Korean women as wives by the Mongols, whom the Mongols earlier took during their invasion of Korea as war booty. The many Song Chinese troops who defected to the Mongols were given oxen, clothes and land by Kublai Khan. As prize for battlefield victories, lands sectioned off as appanages were handed by the Yuan dynasty to Chinese military officers who defected to the Mongol side. The Yuan gave Song Chinese soldiers who defected to the Mongols juntun, a type of military farmland. Chagaan (Tsagaan) and Han tumen General Zhang Rou jointly launched an attack on the Song dynasty ordered by T√∂regene Khatun. After several indecisive wars, the Mongols unsuccessfully attacked the Song garrison at Diaoyu Fortress Hechuan when their Great Khan, M√∂ngke, died of cholera or dysentery. However, the general responsible for this defence was not rewarded but instead was punished by the Song court. Discouraged, he defected to the Mongols and suggested to M√∂ngke's successor, Kublai, that the key to the conquest of Song was the capture of Xiangyang, a vital Song stronghold. The Yuan dynasty under Kublai Khan after the conquest of Southern Song dynasty. The Mongols quickly enclosed Xiangyang and defeated any attempt to reinforce it by the Song. After a siege that lasted several years, and with the help of Muslim artillery created by Iraqi engineers, the Mongols finally forced the city of Xiangyang to surrender. The dying Song dynasty sent its armies against the Mongols at Yehue under the incompetent chancellor Jia Sidao. Predictably, the battle was a disaster. Running out of troops and supplies, the Song court surrendered to the Mongols in 1276. Many Han Chinese were enslaved in the process of the Mongols invasion of China proper.Junius P. Rodriguez, \\"The Historical Encyclopedia of World Slavery\\", ABC-CLIO, 1997, pp146 According to Japanese historian Sugiyama Masaaki (ÊùâÂ±±Ê≠£Êòé) and Funada Yoshiyuki (Ëà©Áî∞ÂñÑ‰πã), there were also a certain number of Mongolian slaves owned by Han Chinese during the Yuan dynasty. However, there is no evidence that Han Chinese, who were considered people of the bottom of Yuan society according to some researchers, suffered particularly cruel abuse.ÊùâÂ±±Ê≠£Êòé„ÄäÂøΩÂøÖÁÉàÁöÑÊåëÊàò„ÄãÔºåÁ§æ‰ºöÁßëÂ≠¶ÊñáÁåÆÂá∫ÁâàÁ§æÔºå2013Âπ¥ÔºåÁ¨¨44‚Äì46È†ÅËàπÁî∞ÂñÑ‰πã„ÄäËâ≤ÁõÆ‰∫∫‰∏éÂÖÉ‰ª£Âà∂Â∫¶„ÄÅÁ§æ‰ºöÔºçÔºçÈáçÊñ∞Êé¢ËÆ®ËíôÂè§„ÄÅËâ≤ÁõÆ„ÄÅÊ±â‰∫∫„ÄÅÂçó‰∫∫ÂàíÂàÜÁöÑ‰ΩçÁΩÆ„Äã,„ÄàËíôÂè§Â≠¶‰ø°ÊÅØ„Äâ2003Âπ¥Á¨¨2Êúü With the desire to rule all of China, Kublai established the Yuan dynasty and became Emperor of China. However, despite the surrender of the Song court, resistance of Song remnants remained. Chinese resistance lasted for a few more years as Song loyalists organized themselves around a powerless boy emperor, brother to the last formal Song emperor. In an attempt to restore the Song dynasty, several Song officials set up a government in Guangdong, aboard ships of the vast Song navy, which still maintained over a thousand ships (which then carried the Song army, which had been forced by the Mongol army off of the land onto these Song warships). Realizing this, in 1279 Kublai sent his fleet to engage the Song fleet at the battle of Yamen in the waters off of modern Hong Kong, winning a decisive victory in which the last Song Emperor Bing of Song and his loyal officials committed suicide. This was the final major military confrontation of the Mongol conquest of the Song in southern China. However, members of the Song Imperial Family continued to live in the Yuan dynasty like Emperor Gong of Song, Zhao Mengfu, and Zhao Yong. Zhao Mengfu painted at the Yuan court and was personally interviewed by Kublai Khan. This practice was referred to as ‰∫åÁéã‰∏âÊÅ™. Chinese resistance in Vietnam against the Mongols The ancestors of the Tr·∫ßn clan originated from the province of Fujian and later migrated to ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát under Tr·∫ßn Kinh Èô≥‰∫¨ (Ch√©n Jƒ´ng), the ancestor of the Tr·∫ßn clan. Their descendants, the later rulers of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát who were of mixed-blooded descent later established the Tran dynasty, which ruled Vietnam (ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát). Despite many intermarriages between the Tr·∫ßn and several royal members of the L√Ω dynasty alongside members of their royal court as in the case of Tr·∫ßn L√Ω and Tr·∫ßn Th·ª´a, some of the mixed-blooded descendants of the Tr·∫ßn dynasty and certain members of the clan were still capable of speaking Chinese such as when a Yuan dynasty envoy had a meeting with the Chinese-speaking Tr·∫ßn prince Tr·∫ßn Qu·ªëc Tu·∫•n in 1282. p. 190. Professor Liam Kelley noted that people from Song dynasty China like Zhao Zhong and Xu Zongdao fled to Tran dynasty ruled Vietnam after the Mongol invasion of the Song and they helped the Tran fight against the Mongol invasion. The ancestors of the Tran clan originated from the modern day province of Fujian as did the Daoist cleric Xu Zongdao who recorded the Mongol invasion and referred to them as \\"Northern bandits\\". He quoted the ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát S·ª≠ K√Ω To√†n Th∆∞ which said ‚ÄúWhen the Song [Dynasty] was lost, its people came to us. Nh·∫≠t Du·∫≠t took them in. There was Zhao Zhong who served as his personal guard. Therefore, among the accomplishments in defeating the Yuan [i.e., Mongols], Nh·∫≠t Du·∫≠t had the most.‚Äù The Tran defeated the Mongol invasions of Vietnam. Southern Song Chinese military officers and civilian officials left to overseas countries, went to Vietnam and intermarried with the Vietnamese ruling elite and went to Champa to serve the government there as recorded by Zheng Sixiao. Southern Song soldiers were part of the Vietnamese army prepared by emperor Tr·∫ßn Th√°nh T√¥ng against the second Mongol invasion.

It is located in King Edward Street, South Dunedin, close to the crossroads known as Cargill's Corner. It was built as a purpose- designed cinema in 1914 by the King Edward Picture Theatre Company. This included some people prominent in Dunedin business such as William and Mary Ann Hudson of the eponymous confectionery company, the brewer Charles Speight and Robert and Charles Greenslade, also of the brewery (Speight's).Minutes, 19/3/1914, King Edward Picture Theatre Co.

This was early in the history of purpose-designed cinemas. While live venues had fan-shaped auditoria and deep stages behind the proscenium arch the Mayfair has the characteristic rectangular auditorium and originally small space behind the proscenium of a cinema. It was decorated with exuberant plasterwork by Robert Wardrop (1858‚Äì1924) which remains a striking feature of the interior.Registration report, New Zealand Historic Places Trust, Heather Bauchop,12/8/2008, p. 8.

Williams.Meeting of Directors, minutes, 12/7/1934, Hocken Collections. It was closed as a cinema on 25 September 1966. The building was acquired by the Dunedin Opera Company in 1967 which converted it to a live venue. The seating capacity was reduced from 862 to 413 by removing the ground floor stalls and advancing the proscenium into the auditorium to achieve a greater stage depth.Otago Daily Times, 16/10/1967 p.13. It has since been operated as a live theatre, particularly for opera. By 2008 it was one of only three remaining buildings in New Zealand originally purpose-designed as cinemas, with the Princess Theatre in Gore, New Zealand (1913) and the Victoria Theatre in Devonport, Auckland (1912).Registration report, New Zealand Historic Places Trust, Heather Bauchop, 12/8/2008, p.13. In 2008, a $20,000 state-of-the-art fire alarm system was installed with donations from several charities. Previously the code phrase \\"Mr Sands to report to the dressing rooms\\" would have been used to evacuate the building, but this was eventually disallowed by the Fire Service as not meeting legal requirements. On 5 December 2008 the theatre was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category II historic place. In 2013 the Mayfair Theatre Charitable Trust was formed from members of the Dunedin Opera Company and registered as a Charity on 15 October 2013.

The medieval lordship of Garmoran was ruled by the MacRuaris, descendants of Somerled, and later formed part of the Lordship of the Isles. Castle Tioram, at the entrance to Loch Moidart, was one of the residences of the lords of Garmoran. In 1284 when his son the prince died, Alexander III called Ailin mac Ruaidhri, the ruler of Garmoran, (along with all the Earls and Barons of Scotland) to make them accept Margaret, Maid of Norway as the heir.Gregory (1881) p. 24 Ailin had died by 1296, by which time he had fathered two illegitimate sons, Ruaidhri and Lachlan, and Christina, his sole legitimate heir. However, when Christina succeeded to the extensive estates of her father she resigned a large proportion of them to Ruaidhri.Barrow (2003) p. 347Gregory (1881) pp. 24, 27 In 1343, King David II issued a charter to Raghnall Mac Ruaidhr√≠, granting him the islands of Uist, Barra, Eigg and Rhum (Ywest ...

He is the author of 31 books, six of which have been adapted for film, and a hundred or so magazine articles and stories. Daley graduated from Fordham University in 1951 and served in the Air Force during the Korean War. He spent six seasons as publicity director for the New York Giants of the National Football League in the days of Frank Gifford, Charlie Conerly and Sam Huff. He then worked on the foreign staff of The New York Times for six years based first in Nice, then in Paris, covering stories in sixteen countries in Europe and North Africa. In 1971‚Äì72, he served as Deputy Commissioner of the New York City Police Department (NYPD). It was a particularly tumultuous period in the department's history: two Mafia dons were killed, the city's biggest-ever jewel heist took place, the Knapp Commission investigation into police corruption caused great upheaval in the department, and four police officers were assassinated by gunmen who claimed to be associated with the Black Liberation Army. Two others were machine- gunned in their car, riddled with bullets but did not die. He had a staff of thirty five, a car and drivers assigned to him around the clock. He witnessed headquarters infighting up close, took part in major decision-making, and saw crime scenes from inside the yellow tape. Daley recounted these events and others in the nonfiction book Target Blue, and he used the police background and his inside knowledge of police headquarters in a number of the novels that followed as well. He was the first professional writer ever to see the NYPD from so deep inside, and said later that when he agreed to take the job, he got more than he bargained for. Daley's award-winning 1978 nonfiction work Prince of the City was hailed by The New York Times Book Review: \\"The policeman as flawed hero, a recurrent and enormously popular figure in contemporary writing, has never been done better.\\" Daley's books, which have been translated into 14 languages, also include Year of the Dragon and Tainted Evidence (filmed as Night Falls on Manhattan). Most of his books grew out of immersing himself deeply in studying people and subjects that fascinated him, from Grand Prix racing to opera to bullfights to treasure diving‚Äîand of course the NYPD. He and his French-born wife divide their time between suburban New York and an apartment in Nice, France.

It is designated as a legal nudist beach under the Nudity (Prescribed Areas) Act 1983.  About the beach  It is a surf beach west of Torquay. It is about 30 minutes drive from Geelong. Signs at both ends of the beach are regularly vandalised or stolen, and the exact legal area can be hard to identify. The beach is very flat and tides come in a very long way. Only a narrow strip of sand remains at high tide and caution is advised when selecting a spot to set up.  How to get there  The beach is south west of Bells Beach and north east of Point Addis. It replaced the previously legal beach just west of Point Addis when that beach's status was revoked. Most nudists remain at the 'revoked' area. Access is via either a long and steep walk from the westernmost carpark at Bells Beach, or via a staircase from Point Addis Rd. Pt Addis Rd runs south from a 90 degree bend in the Great Ocean Rd south of Jarosite Rd. Jarosite Rd/Bells Beach Rd provides access to the Bells Beach carparks.  Parking  There is a sealed carpark atop a high cliff at the western end of Bells Beach. There is a small carpark as well as limited parking along Pt Addis Rd. Parking restrictions apply and enforcement is enthusiastic. At the Bells Beach end, a steep walking track leads from the car park to the beach at the base of the cliff. From there, it is a long walk to the west and around a rocky point, where the waves lap the cliff face at high tide. The water is very shallow and is safe to walk in. At the Pt Addis end, there is a wooden staircase near the carpark which leads to the textile (non-nudist) part of the beach. The legal nude beach is a short walk to the left, and is roughly in the middle of the beach.  Facilities  There are toilets at Bells Beach, 300 metres from the Southside car park and approx 200 m from the access steps on Pt Addis Rd.

Composed of members Jonathan Lippmann, Nathan Gaddis, Jason Barton, and Jordan Roe, the group was born out of Lippmann's desire to pursue musical excellence without watering down his Christian faith. Biography Jonathan Lippmann left 98 Degrees just before they signed a recording contract; he had already signed on to several roles as an actor, but also found himself somewhat uncomfortable with his understanding of religion.[ Biography], Allmusic.com After performing in Sweet Valley High and doing commercials for Burger King, Lippmann formed True Vibe in Nashville, Tennessee, and signed with Essential Records. The group released two albums on Essential. The second album (See The Light) was Grammy-nominated for Best Pop/Contemporary Christian Album. Sometime in 2003, the group parted ways. Jonathan Lippmann told a Christian magazine that he thought about replacing the other three guys but decided against it. They may be best known to mainstream audiences for appearing on the title track to NSYNC members' Lance Bass and Joey Fatone's film, On the Line. True Vibe performed on the Late Show with David Letterman and are featured on the Jimmy Neutron soundtrack. Member Jason Barton later became lead singer of the band 33Miles. Member Nathan Gaddis is now a traveling worship leader, leading in churches, conferences and events.

This method corrects the bias in the estimation of the population variance. It also partially corrects the bias in the estimation of the population standard deviation. However, the correction often increases the mean squared error in these estimations. This technique is named after Friedrich Bessel. In estimating the population variance from a sample when the population mean is unknown, the uncorrected sample variance is the mean of the squares of deviations of sample values from the sample mean (i.e. using a multiplicative factor 1/n). In this case, the sample variance is a biased estimator of the population variance. Multiplying the uncorrected sample variance by the factor : \\\\frac n {n-1} gives an unbiased estimator of the population variance. In some literature,W. J. Reichmann, W. J. (1961) Use and abuse of statistics, Methuen. Reprinted 1964‚Äì1970 by Pelican. Appendix 8.Upton, G.; Cook, I. (2008) Oxford Dictionary of Statistics, OUP. (entry for \\"Variance (data)\\") the above factor is called Bessel's correction. One can understand Bessel's correction as the degrees of freedom in the residuals vector (residuals, not errors, because the population mean is unknown): : (x_1-\\\\overline{x},\\\\,\\\\dots,\\\\,x_n-\\\\overline{x}), where \\\\overline{x} is the sample mean. While there are n independent observations in the sample, there are only n ‚àí 1 independent residuals, as they sum to 0. For a more intuitive explanation of the need for Bessel's correction, see . Generally Bessel's correction is an approach to reduce the bias due to finite sample size. Such finite-sample bias correction is also needed for other estimates like skew and kurtosis, but in these the inaccuracies are often significantly larger. To fully remove such bias it is necessary to do a more complex multi-parameter estimation. For instance a correct correction for the standard deviation depends on the kurtosis (normalized central 4th moment), but this again has a finite sample bias and it depends on the standard deviation, i.e. both estimations have to be merged. Caveats There are three caveats to consider regarding Bessel's correction: # It does not yield an unbiased estimator of standard deviation. # The corrected estimator often has a higher mean squared error (MSE) than the uncorrected estimator. Furthermore, there is no population distribution for which it has the minimum MSE because a different scale factor can always be chosen to minimize MSE. # It is only necessary when the population mean is unknown (and estimated as the sample mean). In practice, this generally happens. Firstly, while the sample variance (using Bessel's correction) is an unbiased estimator of the population variance, its square root, the sample standard deviation, is a biased estimate of the population standard deviation; because the square root is a concave function, the bias is downward, by Jensen's inequality. There is no general formula for an unbiased estimator of the population standard deviation, though there are correction factors for particular distributions, such as the normal; see unbiased estimation of standard deviation for details. An approximation for the exact correction factor for the normal distribution is given by using n ‚àí 1.5 in the formula: the bias decays quadratically (rather than linearly, as in the uncorrected form and Bessel's corrected form). Secondly, the unbiased estimator does not minimize mean squared error (MSE), and generally has worse MSE than the uncorrected estimator (this varies with excess kurtosis). MSE can be minimized by using a different factor. The optimal value depends on excess kurtosis, as discussed in mean squared error: variance; for the normal distribution this is optimized by dividing by n + 1 (instead of n ‚àí 1 or n). Thirdly, Bessel's correction is only necessary when the population mean is unknown, and one is estimating both population mean and population variance from a given sample, using the sample mean to estimate the population mean. In that case there are n degrees of freedom in a sample of n points, and simultaneous estimation of mean and variance means one degree of freedom goes to the sample mean and the remaining n ‚àí 1 degrees of freedom (the residuals) go to the sample variance. However, if the population mean is known, then the deviations of the observations from the population mean have n degrees of freedom (because the mean is not being estimated ‚Äì the deviations are not residuals but errors) and Bessel's correction is not applicable.  Source of bias  Suppose the mean of the whole population is 2050, but the statistician does not know that, and must estimate it based on this small sample chosen randomly from the population: : 2051,\\\\quad 2053,\\\\quad 2055,\\\\quad 2050,\\\\quad 2051 One may compute the sample average: : \\\\frac{1}{5}\\\\left(2051 + 2053 + 2055 + 2050 + 2051\\\\right) = 2052 This may serve as an observable estimate of the unobservable population average, which is 2050\\\\. Now we face the problem of estimating the population variance. That is the average of the squares of the deviations from 2050\\\\. If we knew that the population average is 2050, we could proceed as follows: : \\\\begin{align} {} & \\\\frac{1}{5}\\\\left[(2051 - 2050)^2 + (2053 - 2050)^2 + (2055 - 2050)^2 + (2050 - 2050)^2 + (2051 - 2050)^2\\\\right] [6pt] = {} & \\\\frac{36}{5} = 7.2 \\\\end{align} But our estimate of the population average is the sample average, 2052\\\\. The actual average, 2050, is unknown. So the sample average, 2052, must be used: : \\\\begin{align} {} & \\\\frac{1}{5}\\\\left[(2051 - 2052)^2 + (2053 - 2052)^2 + (2055 - 2052)^2 + (2050 - 2052)^2 + (2051 - 2052)^2\\\\right] [6pt] = {} & \\\\frac{16}{5} = 3.2 \\\\end{align} The variance is now a lot smaller. As proven below, the variance will almost always be smaller when calculated using the sum of squared distances to the sample mean, compared to using the sum of squared distances to the population mean. The one exception to this is when the sample mean happens to be equal to the population mean, in which case the variance is also equal. To see why this happens, we use a simple identity in algebra: : (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 With a representing the deviation of an individual sample from the sample mean, and b representing the deviation from the sample mean to the population mean. Note that we've simply decomposed the actual deviation of an individual sample from the (unknown) population mean into two components: the deviation of the single sample from the sample mean, which we can compute, and the additional deviation of the sample mean from the population mean, which we can not. Now, we apply this identity to the squares of deviations from the population mean: : \\\\begin{align} {[}\\\\,\\\\underbrace{2053 - 2050}_{\\\\begin{smallmatrix} \\\\text{Deviation from} \\\\ \\\\text{the population} \\\\ \\\\text{mean} \\\\end{smallmatrix}}\\\\,]^2 & = [\\\\,\\\\overbrace{(\\\\,\\\\underbrace{2053 - 2052}_{\\\\begin{smallmatrix} \\\\text{Deviation from} \\\\ \\\\text{the sample mean} \\\\end{smallmatrix}}\\\\,)}^{\\\\text{This is }a.} + \\\\overbrace{(2052 - 2050)}^{\\\\text{This is }b.}\\\\,]^2 \\\\ & = \\\\overbrace{(2053 - 2052)^2}^{\\\\text{This is }a^2.} + \\\\overbrace{2(2053 - 2052)(2052 - 2050)}^{\\\\text{This is }2ab.} + \\\\overbrace{(2052 - 2050)^2}^{\\\\text{This is }b^2.} \\\\end{align} Now apply this to all five observations and observe certain patterns: : \\\\begin{alignat}{2} \\\\overbrace{(2051 - 2052)^2}^{\\\\text{This is }a^2.}\\\\ &+\\\\ \\\\overbrace{2(2051 - 2052)(2052 - 2050)}^{\\\\text{This is }2ab.}\\\\ &&+\\\\ \\\\overbrace{(2052 - 2050)^2}^{\\\\text{This is }b^2.} \\\\ (2053 - 2052)^2\\\\ &+\\\\ 2(2053 - 2052)(2052 - 2050)\\\\ &&+\\\\ (2052 - 2050)^2 \\\\ (2055 - 2052)^2\\\\ &+\\\\ 2(2055 - 2052)(2052 - 2050)\\\\ &&+\\\\ (2052 - 2050)^2 \\\\ (2050 - 2052)^2\\\\ &+\\\\ 2(2050 - 2052)(2052 - 2050)\\\\ &&+\\\\ (2052 - 2050)^2 \\\\ (2051 - 2052)^2\\\\ &+\\\\ \\\\underbrace{2(2051 - 2052)(2052 - 2050)}_{\\\\begin{smallmatrix} \\\\text{The sum of the entries in this} \\\\ \\\\text{middle column must be 0.} \\\\end{smallmatrix}}\\\\ &&+\\\\ (2052 - 2050)^2 \\\\end{alignat} The sum of the entries in the middle column must be zero because the term a will be added across all 5 rows, which itself must equal zero. That is because a contains the 5 individual samples (left side within parentheses) which - when added - naturally have the same sum as adding 5 times the sample mean of those 5 numbers (2052). This means that a subtraction of these two sums must equal zero. The factor 2 and the term b in the middle column are equal for all rows, meaning that the relative difference across all rows in the middle column stays the same and can therefore be disregarded. The following statements explain the meaning of the remaining columns: * The sum of the entries in the first column (a2) is the sum of the squares of the distance from sample to sample mean; *The sum of the entries in the last column (b2) is the sum of squared distances between the measured sample mean and the correct population mean * Every single row now consists of pairs of a2 (biased, because the sample mean is used) and b2 (correction of bias, because it takes the difference between the \\"real\\" population mean and the inaccurate sample mean into account). Therefore the sum of all entries of the first and last column now represents the correct variance, meaning that now the sum of squared distance between samples and population mean is used * The sum of the a2-column and the b2-column must be bigger than the sum within entries of the a2-column, since all the entries within the b2-column are positive (except when the population mean is the same as the sample mean, in which case all of the numbers in the last column will be 0). Therefore: * The sum of squares of the distance from samples to the population mean will always be bigger than the sum of squares of the distance to the sample mean, except when the sample mean happens to be the same as the population mean, in which case the two are equal). That is why the sum of squares of the deviations from the sample mean is too small to give an unbiased estimate of the population variance when the average of those squares is found. Smaller the sample size, larger is the difference between the sample variance and the population variance.  Terminology  This correction is so common that the term \\"sample variance\\" and \\"sample standard deviation\\" are frequently used to mean the corrected estimators (unbiased sample variation, less biased sample standard deviation), using n ‚àí 1\\\\. However caution is needed: some calculators and software packages may provide for both or only the more unusual formulation. This article uses the following symbols and definitions: :Œº is the population mean :\\\\overline{x} is the sample mean :œÉ2 is the population variance :sn2 is the biased sample variance (i.e. without Bessel's correction) :s2 is the unbiased sample variance (i.e. with Bessel's correction) The standard deviations will then be the square roots of the respective variances. Since the square root introduces bias, the terminology \\"uncorrected\\" and \\"corrected\\" is preferred for the standard deviation estimators: :sn is the uncorrected sample standard deviation (i.e. without Bessel's correction) :s is the corrected sample standard deviation (i.e. with Bessel's correction), which is less biased, but still biased  Formula  The sample mean is given by :\\\\overline{x}=\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i. The biased sample variance is then written: :s_n^2 = \\\\frac {1}{n} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\left(x_i - \\\\overline{x} \\\\right)^ 2 = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\left(x_i^2\\\\right)}{n} - \\\\frac{\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\\\right)^2}{n^2} and the unbiased sample variance is written: :s^2 = \\\\frac {1}{n-1} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\left(x_i - \\\\overline{x} \\\\right)^ 2 = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\left(x_i^2\\\\right)}{n-1} - \\\\frac{\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\\\right)^2}{(n-1)n} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{n}{n-1}\\\\right)\\\\,s_n^2.  Proof of correctness ‚Äì Alternative 1 As a background fact, we use the identity E[x^2] = \\\\mu^2 + \\\\sigma^2 which follows from the definition of the standard deviation and linearity of expectation. A very helpful observation is that for any distribution, the variance equals half the expected value of (x_1 - x_2)^2 when x_1, x_2 are an independent sample from that distribution. To prove this observation we will use that E[x_1x_2] = E[x_1]E[x_2] (which follows from the fact that they are independent) as well as linearity of expectation: :E[(x_1 - x_2)^2] = E[x_1^2] - E[2x_1x_2] + E[x_2^2] = (\\\\sigma^2 + \\\\mu^2) - 2\\\\mu^2 + (\\\\sigma^2 + \\\\mu^2) = 2\\\\sigma^2 Now that the observation is proven, it suffices to show that the expected squared difference of two observations from the sample population x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n equals (n-1)/n times the expected squared difference of two observations from the original distribution. To see this, note that when we pick x_u and x_v via u, v being integers selected independently and uniformly from 1 to n, a fraction n/n^2 = 1/n of the time we will have u = v and therefore the sampled squared difference is zero independent of the original distribution. The remaining 1-1/n of the time, the value of E[(x_u-x_v)^2] is the expected squared difference between two independent observations from the original distribution. Therefore, dividing the sample expected squared difference by (1-1/n), or equivalently multiplying by 1/(1-1/n) = n/(n-1), gives an unbiased estimate of the original expected squared difference.

We know that the variance of a sum is the sum of the variances (for uncorrelated variables). So, to find the discrepancy between the biased estimator and the true variance, we just need to find the expected value of (x ‚àí ¬µ)2. This is just the variance of the sample mean, which is œÉ2/n. So, we expect that the biased estimator underestimates œÉ2 by œÉ2/n, and so the biased estimator = (1 ‚àí 1/n) √ó the unbiased estimator = (n ‚àí 1)/n √ó the unbiased estimator.

His career was much influenced by his conversion to the Church of England in his youth, and he became a pious believer on the Anglo-Catholic wing of the Church. A brilliant scholar and champion athlete while at university, Bulmer-Thomas wrote biographies and worked as a sub-editor on The Times during his early life. His experience in wartime Italian propaganda led him to doubt its value. Serving in the Attlee Labour Party government in junior roles made him resent the influence of the Labour left; he fell out with party policy on nationalisation and moved to the Conservative Party. He was a workaholic and after leaving politics he became a leading layman in the Church of England; an interest in historic buildings led him to set up the Friends of Friendless Churches group, which campaigns to prevent churches falling into disuse, and play a key role in founding the charity known today as The Churches Conservation Trust. Family and faith Thomas was born in Cwmbran, Monmouthshire; his father A.E. Thomas, was working class.Matthew Saunders, \\"Ivor Bulmer-Thomas\\" (Obituary), The Independent, 8 October 1993. He went to West Monmouth School in Pontypool, where he abandoned his father's Baptist faith in favour of the Anglo-Catholic wing of the Church of England,\\"Ivor Bulmer-Thomas\\" (Obituary), The Times, 8 October 1993. a decision that was to affect his future career profoundly. Although a pious believer, his personal piety was described by Robin Denniston in his Guardian obituary as \\"always gentle and humble\\".Robin Denniston, \\"Dissenter in the Pews: Ivor Bulmer-Thomas\\" (Obituary), The Guardian, 9 October 1993. Oxford Performing well at school, Thomas won a scholarship to St John's College, Oxford, where he studied both Mathematical Mods. and Literae Humaniores (known unofficially as 'Greats' and as 'Classics' at other universities), obtaining Firsts in both. He then turned to study divinity, but fell into dispute with the president of the college and moved instead to Magdalen College where he became Senior Demy in Theology.\\"Thomas, Ivor Bulmer- (1905-1993)\\" in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\\". He was the Liddon Student in 1928, the Ellerton Essayist in 1929, and the Junior Denyer and Johnson Scholar in 1930.\\"Who Was Who\\", A & C Black. Thomas' achievements at Oxford were not confined to academic life; he also became a competitive cross country runner. He represented Oxford in varsity matches against Cambridge from 1925 to 1927, in which year he won the three miles race. In 1926 he had represented his country, Wales, in international cross-country running. But for an injury he would have stood a good chance of selection in the Great Britain team for the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. Author On leaving Oxford, Thomas became the Gladstone Research Student at St Deiniol's Library in Hawarden, the residential library founded at William Ewart Gladstone's former house. The product of his research there was a book on Gladstone's son, published under the title \\"Gladstone of Hawarden\\" in 1936. This book was preceded into print by a biography of Lord Birkenhead, published in 1930 (the year its subject died). Thomas had come to know Birkenhead through his interest in university athletics and the book has been described as witty and entertaining; it was dedicated to \\"my creditors\\".

Journalism Thomas joined the staff of The Times newspaper in 1930, where he served in the sub-editors' room. He also wrote occasional leader columns and specialist articles on scientific subjects as well as being a sports correspondent for a brief period. He married Dilys Llewelyn Jones in 1932, who bore him a son. In 1935, owed some leave from The Times, Thomas took it to coincide with the general election for which he had been chosen as Labour Party candidate for Spen Valley in July.\\"News in Brief\\", The Times, 16 July 1935, p. 9. The sitting Member of Parliament was Sir John Simon, the Home Secretary and the contest was a high-profile one; although Simon was elected, his margin of 642 votes was closer than expected and was said to have given him a fright. Bereavement Thomas moved to the News Chronicle in 1937 as chief leader writer, finding the time to write a biography of Welsh industrialist David Davies which was published the following year. However, tragedy struck with the death of his wife in childbirth in the same year. Thomas' reaction was to write \\"Dilysia\\", a threnody which combined his increasing love of Italian literature (especially Dante) with a Christian philosophical analysis of suffering and bereavement. In later life Thomas was to identify it as his favourite piece of writing, and it was republished in 1987. Thomas needed only four hours sleep, and kept volumes of Dante in the original mediaeval Italian by his bedside to read at night. Wartime service As the Second World War threatened, Thomas enlisted in 1938 in a Territorial battalion of the Royal Fusiliers as a fusilier, equivalent in rank to a private. In 1940 he was commissioned into the Royal Norfolk Regiment. While in the Army, he wrote a two-volume work \\"Selections Illustrating the History of Greek Mathematics\\" which was published by the Loeb Classical Library; he was promoted to captain in 1941. Propaganda work As a fluent Italian speaker, Thomas was drafted into the psychological warfare department of the Foreign Office and Ministry of Information with a brief to develop propaganda for use against Mussolini's Italy. Thomas wrote a 1942 book for Penguin Books called \\"Warfare by Words\\" which criticised British propaganda efforts, and defined the term as an act of \\"sabotage leading to revolution\\". Parliament=Election After leaving propaganda work, Thomas was appointed as intelligence officer in the Cambridge area. In January 1942, he was chosen as Labour Party candidate for the Keighley byelection caused by the death of Hastings Lees-Smith.\\"Keighley By-Election\\", The Times, 26 January 1942, p. 2.

He described the principle of supporting those unable to work as \\"the iron ration of citizenship\\".\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 13 March 1942, p. 8. In his early period in Parliament he concentrated on propaganda concerns, in which he disagreed with Stephen King-Hall's call for it to be treated on the same level as the three services. Thomas argued that this was an \\"entirely false perspective\\" and that propaganda was a \\"valuable but ancillary weapon\\".Letters, The Times, 20 April 1942, p. 5. Activity In November 1942, Thomas worked with Aneurin Bevan and an all-party group of Members of Parliament to put down a motion opposing British co-operation with Admiral Darlan in French North Africa.\\"Terms Of Commons Motion\\", The Times, 27 November 1942, p. 4. He was also active on domestic issues, supporting the movement to allow Sunday opening of theatres,\\"Sunday Theatre Opening\\", The Times, 4 February 1943, p. 2. and for his stance he was denounced by the Lord's Day Observance Society. At a meeting of the society in February 1943, one prayer asked God to \\"deal with Ivor Thomas as he dealt with Saul of Tarsus\\".\\"Protest Against Sunday Theatres\\", The Times, 9 February 1943, p. 2. (Saul is said in Acts 9:4 to have been converted hearing a voice from Heaven saying \\"Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?\\") Thomas became a very active Member of Parliament, intervening in many debates on diverse subjects both domestic and foreign. In January 1945 he was also a speaker at the inaugural meeting of the League for European Freedom, a group which worked to restore the sovereignty of all \\"lesser European Powers existing in 1937\\" and for democratic government throughout Europe.\\"League For European Freedom\\", The Times, 20 January 1945, p. 2. With the end of the war in sight, in April 1945 Thomas drew attention to a speech by Ernest Bevin which called for Government and Opposition to share common ground on foreign policy and defence by sharing information.Letters, The Times, 13 April 1945, p. 5. Government=Ministry of Civil Aviation At the 1945 general election Thomas was easily re-elected. When he saw the list of Government Ministers appointed by Clement Attlee, Thomas took the unusual step of writing to the new prime minister to ask why his own name had not appeared on it. Attlee decided to find Thomas an appointment, and made him Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Civil Aviation on 10 August 1945.\\"More Ministerial Appointments\\", The Times, 11 August 1945, p. 2. He was the Ministry's spokesman in the House of Commons as the Minister was Lord Winster. Thomas took over responsibility for the building of London Heathrow Airport, then known as 'Heath Row', which had been started by the Royal Air Force during the war.\\"House Of Commons\\", The Times 11 October 1945, p. 8. Thomas felt that he could only truly understand his job if he obtained a Private Pilot's Licence, and took up flying until he passed. In 1946 he had responsibility for taking the Civil Aviation Bill through the House of Commons; the Bill was controversial in that it nationalised air transport into three corporations which were originally intended to have commercial freedom. Winster and Thomas were forced by left-wing pressure within the Labour Party to revisit the plans and make the corporations public monopolies.\\"Civil Aviation\\", The Times, 6 April 1946, p. 2.Ivor Bulmer-Thomas, \\"The Growth of the British Party System\\" (John Baker, 1965), vol. ii, p. 168. Some Labour Members were concerned that Thomas, still a young man with little experience of the heavy work of Parliament, was in charge of such an important Bill. Despite a gruelling passage, including an all day Standing Committee session,\\"Standing Committee's Long Day\\", The Times, 28 June 1946, p. 4. the Bill was enacted on schedule on 1 August. Colonies Office On 4 October 1946 Thomas was moved to be Under-Secretary for the Colonies,\\"Cabinet And Defence\\", The Times, 5 October 1946, p. 4. a shift which he later ascribed to an act of weakness by Attlee in giving in to left-wing pressure after the dispute over the Civil Aviation Bill. With this appointment he was also a delegate to the General Assembly of the United Nations.\\"British Delegation\\", The Times, 14 October 1946, p. 4. He negotiated at the United Nations over continued British administration of the colonies of Tanganyika, Togoland and the Cameroons, against attempts by the Soviet Union to limit the extent of control.\\"Trustee Agreements\\", The Times, 12 December 1946, p. 4. Early the next year he intervened in a strike in Singapore, helping to persuade 7,000 municipal labourers to return to work.\\"Singapore strike over\\", The Times, 17 February 1947, p. 3. The Colonies Office also had responsibility for Palestine under the British mandate, in which he followed government policy of resisting illegal immigration (which was predominantly Jewish).\\"House Of Commons\\", The Times, 13 August 1947, p. 6. Crossing the floor Despite thoughts that Thomas might be 'leadership material', Attlee dropped him from the government on 7 October 1947, a dismissal which was unexpected.\\"New Members Of Cabinet\\", The Times, 8 October 1947, p. 4. The reason was Thomas' increasing disillusion with socialism. In March 1948 he spoke at an Italian election rally for the moderate Italian Socialist Party calling for a federation of Europe;\\"Mr. Ivor Thomas On European Union\\", The Times, 1 April 1948, p. 3. when it was revealed that left-wing Labour Members of Parliament had sent a telegram of support to Pietro Nenni, leader of the rival left-wing Italian Socialists, Thomas signed a motion calling for a Select Committee to investigate.\\"Party Discipline\\", The Times, 20 April 1948, p. 4. On 13 October 1948 Thomas wrote to The Times to urge the government to \\"drop all contentious legislation\\" in the forthcoming Parliamentary session, specifically the Parliament Bill and the Iron and Steel Bill,\\"Unity At Home\\", The Times, 15 October 1948, p. 5. prompting considerable debate. Immediately after the King's Speech in which both Bills were included, Thomas wrote to Attlee announcing his resignation from the Labour Party. He said he had been \\"particularly disturbed by the growing concentration of power in the hands of the State\\" and accused the government of surrendering \\"to its more extreme members and supporters\\".\\"M.P. resigns from Labour Party\\", The Times, 27 October 1948, p. 6. Stormy speech When Thomas rose to speak in the debate the following day, it became clear that leaving the Labour Party had cost him many friendships. Hyacinth Morgan intervened in his speech to ask whether he would stand for re-election immediately under his new colours; Thomas replied that he had consulted the precedent of Tom Horabin who had moved from the Liberals to Labour without so doing. When Thomas declared that the Labour slogan reversed the Christian declaration 'What is mine is thine' to say 'What is thine is mine', Morgan shouted at him \\"You are a dirty dog!\\". The Speaker ordered Morgan to withdraw the words. In his conclusion, Thomas implicitly praised the leadership of Winston Churchill.\\"Mr. Ivor Thomas In Stormy Scene\\", The Times, 28 October 1948, p. 4. During the rest of the Parliament, Thomas was treated by Labour Members as a pariah. He formed an unofficial group of two with Alfred Edwards who had also left Labour over the nationalisation of steel, and in the new year he formally announced he had joined the Conservative Party; simultaneously it was announced that he had been adopted as Conservative Party candidate for Newport (Monmouthshire), near his birthplace.\\"Mr. Ivor Thomas\\", The Times, 4 January 1949, p. 4. However, he did not receive the Conservative Whip until Whitsun.\\"Mr. A. Edwards Joins Conservatives\\", The Times, 20 August 1949, p. 4. Thomas made an attacking speech at the 1949 Conservative Party conference: referring to Harold Wilson's remark that half the children in his class never had any boots, Thomas gibed that \\"if ever he went to school without any boots it was because he was too big for them\\".Nigel Rees, \\"Sayings of the Century\\" (Unwin Paperbacks, 1987), p. 150. He wrote a book called The Socialist Tragedy which was published that year. Defeat When the general election came round, Thomas found himself with a formidable task in trying to win Newport. Thomas had family connections and his stance on steel nationalisation was thought to be popular, but he found the voters not very interested.\\"S. Wales apathy on steel\\", The Times, 18 February 1950, p. 3. Thomas was defeated by the heavy margin of 9,992 votes. Return to journalism Thomas' first action on losing his seat was to go with a group of friends to drive across the Sahara desert. He then returned to journalism, becoming a reviewer for The Times Literary Supplement and writing obituaries for The Times. His contributions were anonymous in print but he is known to have been responsible for many important obituaries including that of Bertrand Russell. From 1953 to 1954, he was acting deputy editor of The Daily Telegraph. By this time, he had changed his surname. In 1940 he had married (at Hereford Cathedral) Joan Bulmer, from Hereford, by whom he had a son and two daughters; in April 1952 he took the additional surname 'Bulmer-' by deed poll to acknowledge her. His son by his second marriage is Victor Bulmer- Thomas, formerly director of Chatham House. Church of England In the same year as losing his Parliamentary seat, Bulmer-Thomas had found a seat in the House of Laity of the Church Assembly. There, as he had at Westminster, he intervened frequently in debate with some extravagant and controversial speeches The issue which had become the most pressing for Bulmer-Thomas on the Church Assembly was the care of the fabric of churches. In 1951 he was appointed chairman of the London Diocesan Advisory Committee on the care of Churches,\\"Roofing Of Churches\\" (letter), The Times, 3 May 1952, p. 7. and in June of that year he successfully moved a motion in the Church Assembly to set up a ¬£4 million trust for the preservation of historic churches.\\"Maintenance Of Churches\\", The Times, 20 June 1952, p. 3. The Historic Churches Preservation Trust achieved its desired funding and persuaded the Church Assembly to pass the Inspection of Churches Measure, to properly assess the condition of old churches every five years.\\"Expert Inspection Of Churches\\", The Times, 9 May 1955, p. 5. Bulmer-Thomas' obituary in The Independent commented that \\"more than any other single Act, this modest Measure has prevented many of those sudden 'repairs crises' which carry off too many fine churches\\". Dispute with the archbishop On 13 July 1956 long-running tensions within the Historic Churches Preservation Trust came out in the open. Bulmer-Thomas wanted the trust to save every threatened church, which included intervening with Dioceses to persuade them not to demolish unwanted churches which had lost their congregations. Other trustees, allied with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher, thought that local autonomy should be preserved. When Bulmer-Thomas failed to persuade the trust to adopt his policy, the trust was dissolved and a new executive committee set up in which he was not involved.\\"Church Preservation Trust Difference On Policy\\", The Times, 14 July 1956, p. 6. At the Church Assembly on 15 November 1956, Bulmer- Thomas attacked Fisher, saying that he \\"held a pistol to my face while the Dean of Gloucester plunged his dagger into my back\\", which shocked some listeners.\\"Assembly Clash On \\"Neglect\\" Of Historic Churches\\", The Times, 16 November 1956, p. 7. Bulmer-Thomas went away and made his own plans. Friends of Friendless Churches On 12 August 1957 Bulmer-Thomas announced the formation of \\"The Friends of Friendless Churches\\", with himself as acting chairman and honorary secretary; he stressed that the group \\"is in no sense a rival to any existing body\\".\\"Saving 'Friendless Churches'\\", The Times, 13 August 1957, p. 5. The Friends followed the policy Bulmer-Thomas had hoped the trust would adopt, opposing any suggestion of the demolition of a church. He saw some considerable success but became an even more controversial figure with those who saw new uses of old churches as being an inevitable development. By the time of Bulmer-Thomas' death, it was estimated that the Friends had by their own efforts actively saved 17 churches, and helped to rescue many more; They had become the guardians of 21 separate churches. While many disagreed with Bulmer-Thomas' approach, his commitment was clear. The Churches Conservation Trust In 1969 Bulmer-Thomas was made the first chairman of the Redundant Churches Fund, known today as The Churches Conservation Trust, the national charity protecting historic churches at risk.\\"Latest Appointments\\", The Times, 3 April 1969, p. 12. Bulmer-Thomas was in charge of it for seven years. As of 2015 this body has over 345 historic churches in its care, visited by almost 2 million people a year. Other activity Bulmer-Thomas had other involvement in the field of heritage, being Secretary of the Ancient Monuments Society from 1958; he served on the society's council for more than 30 years and was its chairman from 1975 to 1990. In 1970 he became a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. In addition he became a Churchwarden at St. Andrew-by-the-Wardrobe in the City of London, where he conducted an \\"Advanced Sunday School\\"; he had a special bond to the Church, having fought to have it rebuilt after bomb damage in the Second World War. His interest in journalism and connection to the Church led him to get involved in the Society of the Faith and the Faith Press, which it owned as a specialist printing firm. Honours He never attempted to return to politics, but he did write \\"The Growth of the British Party System\\" in two volumes in 1965; it was poorly received. In 1981 he became a member of the Social Democratic Party, although he was not active. He was a hard worker, but in 1985 he stood down from the General Synod after 35 years membership of it and its predecessor. He received several honours, including an honorary Fellowship of St John's College Oxford, and the CBE for his work in preserving Churches in 1984, which Bulmer-Thomas quipped stood for \\"Churches Before Evangelism\\". He received two honorary degrees, that from the University of Warwick in 1979 being at the insistence of the Mathematics Department. On his 80th birthday, the Ancient Monuments Society published a 'Festschrift' in his honour, paying tribute to the diversity of his interests. Bulmer-Thomas was reported to have been working \\"literally till a few minutes before his death\\" on a letter to the Daily Telegraph, which was published on the same day as his obituary appeared.

Plot Greta is 17, a bright and beautiful young woman. She is also rebellious as a result of her turbulent home life. Pushed aside by her mother, Karen, who is on her third marriage, Greta is shipped off to her grandparents for the summer. She is not happy about it and neither are the grandparents. She tells them that she fully intends to kill herself before the summer is over and compiles a notebook of suicide methods. Greta's snarky attitude results in her being offered a job as a waitress at a local seafood restaurant. While working there, her odd sense of humor makes her attractive to many customers. Greta falls for a charismatic short-order cook named Julie. When he reveals to her that he was once in a juvenile correctional facility for stealing cars, Greta is even more attracted to him. Julie tells her that his experience made him determined to do something positive with his life and he attempts to convince Greta to not give up on hers. He is alarmed when he sees Greta's \\"suicide list\\". Although Greta's grandparents Katherine and Joseph are initially concerned about her boyfriend's criminal past, Julie proves himself worthy of their trust and demonstrates that he truly cares for Greta. Joseph tells him about Greta's father, who committed suicide in front of Greta when she was very young. Julie demonstrates his respect for Greta when she attempts to lose her virginity to him. He tells her he will not be one of the things she checks off of her \\"to- do list\\" and that it has to be another time. The police come as a result of neighbors having seen Julie enter an upper story window. At first the grandparents are upset with Julie for being there. Greta is called inside, and explains to her grandparents he was there at her request. The grandfather goes outside and squares things with the police. Julie tells the grandparents that he sincerely cares for Greta. While the four are out sailing in Joseph's boat, Greta attempts to drown herself. Julie rescues her, but the fright still causes Katherine to have a mild heart attack. Katherine is given a positive prognosis by a doctor and she and her husband stay the night at a local hospital. Julie is mad at Greta, telling her that she should appreciate the life she has. The near catastrophe gives Greta a wake-up call and shows her how deeply her own actions affect those around her. Once Katherine gets back from the hospital, Greta is determined to show her how sorry she is. Katherine is still furious, telling Greta she doesn't really know what she is sorry about. They have a heart-to-heart conversation, interrupted by Greta's mother and her current husband, who have come to take Greta to a summer boot camp. The grandparents are shocked at the mother's abrasive behavior. Greta escapes to Julie who tells her that as messed up as she may be, a boot camp will never help her if she does not want to help herself. Julie's advice calms Greta and she returns to the house to find her mother has already packed up her things. Joseph arrives and interrupts them all telling Karen that Greta does not need a boot camp, she needs love, and that Greta and Karen will both be staying with them. The three women bond looking at old pictures and the film ends with Greta leaving her suicide notebook in the ocean and in a voice over (letter to her mom) thanking her for letting her stay for the rest of the summer with her grandparents.

Position in canon law In Catholic canon law, amovibility is a term applied to the condition of certain ecclesiastics in regard to their benefices or offices. Holders of so- called perpetual or irremovable dignities can in certain specified cases be deprived of their offices; but the term \\"amovibility\\" is generally restricted to office-holders removable at the will of the bishop. The term covers most of the rectors of churches in the United States and England, as also in general and everywhere those who have charge of succursal churches or are parish assistants. Under the head of removable dignitaries, canonists generally class also vicars-general, archdeacons, and rural deans. Such an office or benefice is designated manuale, as opposed to titulare or perpetuum. The interpretation of amovibility has caused controversy. Many canonists have argued that because the possessor of an office holds it ad nutum, he can therefore be deprived of it without cause. Otherwise, they declare, the word amovibility would have no meaning. They note as exceptions, however, to this power of the bishop, cases in which he acts from open hatred, or injures the good name of the ecclesiastic, or damages the parish. Likewise, they say, if the person removed were not given another office, he could have recourse to a superior authority, as this would be equivalent to injuring his good name. These canonists also add that the bishop would sin if he removed an ecclesiastic without cause, as his action would be without a proper motive, and because frequent changes are necessarily detrimental to churches. Other canonists seem to maintain for removable rectors practically the same rights as to perpetuity, which are possessed by irremovable ecclesiastics. Amovibility contrasts with arbitrary removal, which the Catholic Church has always condemned. It is opposed to the perpetual tenure of those benefices, for removal from which the canons require a cause expressly named in law and a formal canonical process or trial. But there may be other causes that justify a removal besides those named in the canons. A removable rector is, therefore, one who may be removed without cause expressed in law, but not without a just cause; one who may be removed without canonical process, but not without certain prescribed formalities, which are really judicial, though \\"extra-judicial\\" as regards the canons. Since, however, removable ecclesiastics have no strict and perpetual right to their offices, any revocation made by the superior ad nutum is valid, though it might be gravely illicit and reversible. In such cases recourse may be had to a superior authority, although an ordinary appeal in the strict sense is barred. In the United States the method of procedure was laid down principally in the Second Plenary Council of Baltimore (1866) and the Roman Instructions \\"Quamvis\\" of 1878 and \\"Cum Magnopere\\" of 1884.

In a part exchange, instead of one party to the contract paying money and the other party supplying goods/services, both parties supply goods/services, the first party supplying part money and part goods/services. Whether a part exchange is a sale or a barter is a fine point of law. It depends from whether a monetary value is assigned to the non-money goods supplied. Several cases at law clarify this. In the case of Flynn v Mackin and Mahon an old car was supplied in part exchange for a new car, along with ¬£250. This was held to be a barter, because no monetary value was affixed to the old car. However, in Aldridge v Johnson a similar transaction was held to be a sale, because a monetary value was assigned to the item being exchanged (23 bullocks, valued at ¬£192), and cash then used to make up the difference to the price of the item being purchased (100 quarters of barley, valued at ¬£215). If the contract had been structured as \\"23 bullocks and ¬£23 for 100 quarters of barley\\" then it could have qualified as barter. It is the affixture of the monetary value of ¬£192 to the bullocks and ¬£215 to the barley that made it a sale. Indeed, it is not necessary even for the contracting parties themselves to assign a monetary value to the goods for a part exchange deal to be held to be a sale. In Bull v Parker, the court itself assigned a value (¬£4) for new riding equipment, sold for some old riding equipment and ¬£2. If goods/services have obvious monetary values, then a part exchange deal can be held to be a sale. It was held in Aldridge v Johnson that there were in fact two separate contracts, both of sale, rather than a single contract of barter. And this is one way that part exchange deals are viewed. Indeed, this is how they are always viewed in the United Kingdom for V.A.T. purposes. A supply of an old car in part exchange for a new one, at a car dealership, is two separate sales, and must be recorded by the dealer as such in account books, for V.A.T. purposes. Technically, the customer is making a \\"supply\\" for the discount given, providing the old car for an amount equal to the monetary discount, and the dealer is also making a \\"supply\\" for the full price, providing the new car for its full sale price. Car dealerships are one business sector where part exchange deals are common. They are less common in other sectors. In the housing sector, for example, only a few businesses will make part exchange deals. One such is Barratt Homes, where the part exchange deal, with buyers being offered discounts for part exchange of their old houses, has in fact been an integral part of the company's business model. There is another accounting nicety for the house builder in such deals, relating to when, exactly, to take the profit on the deal. House prices change over time, and it is possible that the housebuilder may not be able to eventually sell the old, exchanged, property for the same or more than the value that it was originally exchanged for. There are two extreme views on how to render accounts for such deals, and most accounting practices fall somewhere in the spectrum in between. The one extreme has the profit on the deal taken straightaway that the new house is sold, on the presumption that the old house will sell for its exchange value. The other extreme has the profit on the deal not taken at all until the entire deal has completed, including the sale onwards of the old house received in exchange. The major accounting considerations are making provisions at year's end for part exchange stock that remains unsold, and for the predicted marketing costs of selling it.

A normal clinical ultrasound user only has access to the ultrasound data in its final processed form, typically a B-Mode image, in DICOM format. For reasons of device usability they also have limited access to the processing parameters that can be modified.Dickie K, Leung C, Zahiri R, Pelissier L.

Research interface on a programmable ultrasound scanner. Ultrasonics. 2008 Jul;48(03);159-168. A URI allows a researcher to achieve different results by either acquiring the image at various intervals through the processing chain, or changing the processing parameters. Typical B-mode receive processing chain A typical digital ultrasound processing chain for B-Mode imaging may look as follows: *Multiple analog signals are acquired from the ultrasound transducer (the transmitter/receiver applied to the patient) *Analog signals may pass through one or more analog notch filters and a variable-gain amplifier (VCA) *Multiple analog-to-digital converters convert the analog radio frequency (RF) signal to a digital RF signal sampled at a predetermined rate (typical ranges are from 20MHz to 160MHz) and at a predetermined number of bits (typical ranges are from 10 bits to 16 bits) *Beamforming is applied to individual RF signals by applying time delays and summations as a function of time and transformed into a single RF signal *The RF signal is run through one or more digital FIR or IIR filters to extract the most interesting parts of the signal given the clinical operation *The filtered RF signal runs through an envelope detector and is log compressed into a grayscale format Multiple signals processed in this way are lined up together and interpolated and rasterized into a readable image. Data access A URI may provide data access at many different stages of the processing chain, these include: *Pre-beamformed digital RF data from individual channels *Beamformed RF data *Envelope detected data *Interpolated image data Where many diagnostic ultrasound devices have Doppler imaging modes for measuring blood flow, the URI may also provide access to Doppler related signal data, which can include: *Demodulated (I/Q) data *FFT spectral data *Autocorrelated velocity color Doppler data Tools A URI may include many different tools for enabling the researcher to make better use of the device and the data captured, some of these tools include: *Custom MATLAB programs for reading and processing signal and image data *Software Development Kits (SDKs) for communicating with the URI, signal processing and other specialized modes of operation available on the URI ReferencesUltrasound Research Laboratories The following non-exhaustive list of research labs are typical candidates that would use an ultrasound research interface for conducting experiments and collecting data. *NTNU Ultrasound Research Group *Duke Biomedical Imaging *Stanford Ultrasound Lab *Mayo Clinic Ultrasound Imaging Lab *Western Biomedical Ultrasound Research Lab *Physics for Medicine lab, Paris Category:Ultrasound Category:Medical ultrasonography Category:Medical physics ","title":"Ultrasound research interface"},{"id":"13384618","text":"The Opici were an ancient italic people of the Latino-Faliscan group who lived in the region of Campania.

Novalima's style blends Afro-Peruvian music with Electronica, Latin American beats and other contemporary genres. History Novalima is a Latin Grammy nominated band created in 2001 by Carlos Li Carrillo (Hong Kong). The name Novalima came from one of Carlos‚Äô trips to Brazil where he saw a broken sign along the highway in Mina Gerais saying: ‚ÄúNova Lima in 30 Kms‚Äù. ‚ÄúThat is how the name Novalima was created and it was conceptualized in order to give rise to a new generation of modern music made with musicians from around the world combined with the Lima music scene‚Äù. Carlos commented ‚Äú I wanted to put Afro Peruvian influences within the same context along other important world music styles, since at that time Afro Peruvian music was somehow unknown outside Peru. For the initial recordings Carlos met Afro-Peruvian musician Mang√ºe Vasquez who introduced the first ‚Äúcaj√≥n‚Äù in a Novalima song becoming the ‚Äúsoul‚Äù of Novalima and the main influence of Afro-Peruvian sounds in the band. For the production and recording of these songs Carlos recruited Ram√≥n Perez Prieto (Lima) and Pier Paolo de Bernardi (Lima) to join the band's production team. Later on, Rafael Morales (London) who at that time was living in UK, was also invited to join the band. (Since the early 90s Pier, Ramon and Rafael were together with Carlos in the psychedelic rock band ‚ÄúAvisp√≥n Verde‚Äù with which they made 2 albums ‚ÄúAvisp√≥n Verde‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlan 9‚Äù) After the release of the self titled 1st album in 2003, Carlos decided to invite Grimaldo del Solar (Barcelona) who was at that time living in Spain to join the band. (Grimaldo played together with Carlos and Rafael during their teenage years in Curriculum Mortis, a Peruvian Thrash Metal band during the mid 80s in the Lima underground scene). Grimaldo entered Novalima for the recording of ‚ÄúAfro‚Äù, the 2nd album production under a UK label called Mr. Bongo. The main members of the band Carlos Li Carrillo (Hong Kong), Ram√≥n Perez Prieto (Lima), Rafael Morales (London), Pier de Bernardi (Lima) and Grimaldo Del Solar (Barcelona), became friends while in high school in Lima, and shared a fascination for many types of music, such as metal, rock, reggae, dance and electronic music. The production of the ‚ÄúNovalima‚Äù first album, and the ‚ÄúAfro‚Äù album was done when the main members were living in different parts of the world. From their homes in Hong Kong, London, Barcelona and Lima, they started emailing song ideas to each other even when transferring heavy song files was not easy in the internet and the files had to be done by courier in burned CDs. For the 2nd album, Afro, they invited more Afro-Peruvian musicians to join their recording sessions. It was released in 2006 to tremendous acclaim and put Novalima on the international music map. It also held the #1 spot on the US College Music Journal Latin Alternative and New World radio charts for ten weeks combined. On that same year Novalima was awarded with the IMA (The Independent Music Awards) for Best Album in World Fusion category. In ‚ÄúAfro‚Äù, the creative core was further enriched by Afro-Peruvian scene musicians, such as Milagros Guerrero, Juan Medrano (Cotito), Mangue V√°squez, Marcos Mosquera. Short after the world release of the ‚ÄúAfro‚Äù album and after playing drums in the 1st Novalima concert in Lima, Pier de Bernardi left the band and the production team. With the addition of percussionist/timbalero Constantino √Ålvarez to the band, Novalima started touring live concerts in Europe, USA and Asia. Novalima's 3rd album, Coba Coba, was released in October 2008 for the Peruvian market. The album was released worldwide in January 2009 by the Cumbancha label and nominated for the Latin Grammy as Best Alternative Album. On Coba Coba, Novalima delved further into the African roots of Afro-Peruvian music, bringing in influences from its musical cousins reggae, dub, salsa, hip-hop, afrobeat and Cuban son. To complete the extensive Coba Coba tour, Alfonso Montesinos joined the band ensemble with the bass guitar since 2010. In 2010, the song \\"Machete\\" from the album \\"Afro\\" appears in the film Machete. In 2011 Novalima started the recordings of ‚ÄúKarimba‚Äù, its 4th album. One of the main guest musicians for this musical production is the singer Pepe Vasquez who is considered a legend in Per√∫ music scene. Karimba was released on January 2012 under the label Eighteenth Street Lounge Music (ESL Music). In mid 2012, Mang√º√© Vasquez died. Mang√º√© was considered the best Afro Peruvian ‚Äúcaj√≥n‚Äù player in Per√∫, and the one who provided the initial Afro Peruvian influences to the band. He was widely recognized as the ‚Äúsoul‚Äù of Novalima. During late 2012, the founder and main bass player Carlos Li Carrillo left Novalima to form his own solo project TIME CERO, an Industrial Electro Metal band with Pier de Bernardi. The rest of the band continued touring with Novalima. In 2015 Novalima recorded its 5th album Planetario which was reviewed very positively by NPR as a \\"three-layer cake of time\\" and avant-garde in approach and execution.

They are native to Australia, with a centre of diversity in Western Australia. The genus is named in honour of Hugh Davies, a Welsh botanist. They have nitrogen-fixing bacteria contained in root nodules like other genera in their family. Description The leaves of Daviesia species are like phyllodes. They are usually hard, frequently prickly, frequently circular in section, and sometimes reduced to scales. Some species have cladodes, e.g., D. alata. The roots of many Daviesia species have a mode of secondary thickening in which successive arch-like cambia arise outside the roots of the previous season, creating rope-like structures on the roots.

Early life Eustace James Missenden was born in London, the son of a South Eastern and Chatham Railway station master.Bonavia (1981) He left school at an early age, which according to Bonavia gave him a chip on his shoulder.Bonavia, Michael R. (1993). Railways South East, 3, 182 In May 1899, Missenden started work as a junior clerk with the South Eastern Railway, at the small station at Bishopsbourne, on the Elham Valley line, earning 7 s a week. In November 1902, after a spell at New Romney, he was posted to Lydd, on the edge of Romney Marsh, and his pay went up to 17s a week. For a staff photograph, which must have been taken shortly after he arrived (aged sixteen and a half), he stood at the extreme edge of the group, as befitted his junior status, but his shiny shoes and stand-up collar (the only one in the group) show that he intended to make an impression. Southern Railway years Missenden's career was largely with the Southern Railway, where he rose to be Docks and Marine Manager and in 1941 General Manager. He was a competent railwayman, experienced more on the operating than the commercial side of operations, and was loyal to the established working practices of the Southern Railway. Missenden was also a good organiser and knew how to delegate, whilst looking after the interests of those subordinates who had served him well, the key example being Oliver Bulleid. He firmly declined to work over-long hours and was careful, perhaps even fussy, over his health. However, Missenden lacked both the warm, extrovert personality of his predecessor at Waterloo, Gilbert S. Szlumper, and the intellectual and managerial distinction of Sir Herbert Walker, a predecessor he admired greatly. Railway executive years With the passing of the Transport Act 1947, Missenden became the first Chairman of the Railway Executive later that year, accountable to the British Transport Commission for the running of British Railways. Missenden accepted the offer of the Chairmanship, though with the private intention of \\"retiring before too long\\". This was primarily because he did not move easily in Government circles, being suspicious of both politicians and civil servants. He found himself out of his depth in attempting to coordinate a team of disparate Railway Executive Members who were not responsible to him in the way that railway departmental officers had been responsible to a General Manager. The difficulties came from the fact that the Members represented the legacy of the \\"Big Four\\" railway companies in Britain, with each having their own agenda even when part of a nationalised industry. Antipathy increased when the Southern Railway, the smallest of Britain's pre-nationalised railways, had provided the Chairman, and as such, the Railway Executive ceased to be an effective body for policy- making. In 1949, British Railways gave Bulleid Pacific locomotive 34090 the name Sir Eustace Missenden - Southern Railway. The intention was both to honour his personal contribution and to act as a tribute to the war effort of the Southern Railway's employees.Burridge (1975) Missenden retired in 1951. Honours He was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1925 and upgraded to Officer of the same order (OBE) in the 1937 Coronation Honours. He was knighted in the 1944 Birthday Honours. Personal life In 1912, he married Lilian Adeline Gent, daughter of Henry Gent. They had no children. He died in 1973, aged 86.

It's one of the oldest digital art festivals in Bulgaria, founded in 1989. 30 jubilee edition of the international computer art forum Computer Space'2018, 24 hours newspaper, 2018  Description  An international non- commercial event and platform joining young artists, students and producers of computer graphics, computer animation, off-line multimedia, electronic music and web design. Computer Space includes contest and festival part and all the events are free and open to the public especially encouraging the participation of students and young artists. Every year more than 200 projects in the sphere of computer arts have been presented by their authors and discussed. The creative idea, the transformation of the idea to project, the combination of technology and art in the implementation, the society impact of computers have been always a main focus of the symposia in the frame of Computer Space.  History  Starting as an electronic music festival in 1989 Computer Space included graphics and animation sections next few years. Web design and mobile applications have been one of the fast-growing sections last years. During the 1980s Bulgaria specialized in producing microcomputers in the former communist bloc countries and the Soviet Union specialized in producing big machines and supercomputers. The Eastern bloc countries had the so-called Economic Inter-support Council and in the frame of that Council each country has been developing some economic area. At that time it was not so clear the microcomputers will be the future and some experts believe that the microcomputers are mainly for games and home usage. It happened that in 1981 the first microcomputer in Eastern Europe called Imko II then (in 1982) called Pravetz 82 (with 8 bit processor) has been released in Bulgaria. This was Apple II compatible microcomputer and it came to life just after Apple II. This situation placed Bulgaria in the leadership role in microcomputers production not only in Eastern Europe but also in the Middle East and even in the Central Europe. A huge plants have been built exporting thousands of Pravetz 82 and later Pravetz 16 (with 8086/88 processor) to all Eastern bloc countries and to Arabic countries. The development of computer industry in that time strongly influenced the development of software and also the development of computer arts. In the beginning of 80's the first analogue synthesiser (produced in Paris and occupying almost one big hall) has been installed in the Bulgarian National Radio and thus giving a strong tool to the electronic music composers from the Balkan region. The own production of EGA and VGA displays in the middle and late 80s pushed the computer graphics and visualization to a new level.Petkov, R., Multimedia development and computer arts in Bulgaria, Balkanmedia magazine, V3, Balkanmedia, ISSN 0861-5047, C: 1996, p. 25-26,Behind the Silicon Curtain, Computer Art in Eastern Bloc, Todor Bozhinov, University of the Arts Bremen, p. 60 Being a barometer of electronic and computer arts in Sough-Eastern Europe Computer Space forum often offers the artists possibility to debate such fundamental issues as relations between computer arts and other contemporary arts, place of the artists in the creative process, styles in digital arts, technology and society issues etc. Some of the symposium topics like 'The Violence of Information', 'Virtual Identity', 'Computer arts or computers in the arts', 'Art or a design' opened a lot of following discussions in many artistic forums and blogs. One of the often open questions during the many discussions is the definition of art in the computer generated or manipulated products. For example, some computer graphics like 3D architectural or car images could demonstrate brilliant design technologies and could 'touch' the users emotionally. Is this an art? Or we may see very nice Photoshop made drawings of landscapes or processed photographs. And, another often posed question, the value of such creations, especially in comparison to the value of oil paintings that exist in just one unique copy. These and many similar questions allow the artists to debate the future of the arts and interaction between the arts. Computer arts have a lot of forms and appearance and this evolution is always been in a focus of CS seminars. Computer graphics, computer animation, multimedia (CD/ DVD based games, encyclopaedia, fairy-tale stories, galleries, training modules etc.), web-art, net-art, electronic/computer music, VRs, interactive art installations and many forms are regarded as computer arts. But, it is always a big discussion when the synthesis of technology and creative ideas becomes an art. And, how to distinguish the art from the brilliant design or from the perfect modelling? Shall we consider the impact and raised emotions as a prove of the artistic elements of some project? And, if and how the entertainment projects (for example, games) could be considered as an art ?  Reception  The event is mentioned regularly in national and international press.242-computer-space-2010 article in the .net Magazine about Computer Space 2010 (archived)UNESCO Young Digital Creators programme and Computer Space (2004)Computer Space 2007 in Designer (2007, archived) In 2003 President of the Republic of Bulgaria awarded the project in the category \\"Society and Institution web\\".The President of Republic of Bulgaria awarding the project in Society and Institution web category (archived) A lot of well-known studios and artists from the CS participating with projects over the years, for instance: Braam Jordaan (South Africa), Academy of Media Arts Cologne (Cologne), ZKM (Karlsruhe), IRCAM (Paris), Platige Studio (Poland), Studio Aka (UK), Miralab (Switzerland), Institute for Electroacoustic of Vienna University and many others.

It depicts the 81-year-old artist posed in Peale's Museum, then occupying the second floor of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.Admission ticket to Peale's Museum from Philadelphia Museum of Art. The nearly life-size painting is in the collection of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. History Toward the end of his career, beginning in 1822, he painted seven self-portraits that together formed the final motif of his art and the final flourishing of his talent. The Artist in His Museum is a large-scale oil-on-canvas work painted in about two months, and is the most emblematic of Peale's many self-portraits. Peale was a naturalist as well as a painter. In 1784 he founded the Philadelphia Museum, situated at the time of the painting in the Long Room of the Pennsylvania State House (now Independence Hall). The curation of the museum dominated his career from that point; he would on occasion announce his retirement from painting or his return to it. In 1822 he was asked by the museum's trustees to paint a full-length portrait of himself for the museum. The artist endeavored to \\"not only make it a lasting monument of my art as a Painter, but also that the design should be expressive, that I bring forth into public view, the beauties of Nature and Art, the rise & progress of the Museum.\\" He further said, \\"I wish it may excite some admiration, otherwise my labor is lost, except that it is a good likeness.\\" Peale's determination to honor his career is reflected in his having painted two preliminary versions of The Artist, unusual for an artist who took pride in producing likenesses with little preparatory work. Description Peale's Exhuming the First American Mastodon (1806). There are three spaces in the work. The foreground of the painting depicts in low light some natural objects of the museum. At the front left, a dead wild turkey sits with Peale's taxidermic tools, brought back by his son Titian and waiting to join the collection to reveal its meaning as a national symbol. Another American symbol, the bald eagle, is higher on the left edge of the canvas, mounted by Peale‚Äî\\"the strength of the Eagles Eye is really astonishing\\"‚Äîand is now one of his few surviving specimens. On the extreme left is an early donation: a paddlefish from the Allegheny River in an upright case, marked \\"With this article the Museum commenced, June, 1784\\". To Peale's left lie the bones of a mastodon; the assembled skeleton that shows from behind the curtain was the museum's main attraction. Peale had unearthed and reconstructed a mastodon in 1800, an event he chronicled in his 1806 painting Exhuming the First American Mastodon (left). The artist's palette and brushes to his left contribute to the autobiographical statement. The middle ground highlights Peale. In the painting, the artist invites the viewer into his museum; he pulls back a draped crimson curtain, which divides the painting's space, to reveal the collection. He used a similar motif on the printed acknowledgments he sent to museum donors, on which a curtain labeled \\"Nature\\" is held back to reveal a landscape with animals. According to critic David C. Ward, the positioning of Peale \\"has the effect of creating a dialectic between life and art, painter and audience, the individual and American culture at large, and finally past and present. The figure of Peale bridges these realms ‚Ä¶ further drawing attention to and heightening the impact of his creativity.\\" The painting appeared on a stamp commemorating the Academy's 150th anniversary The deep background behind the curtain gives the portrait its unique significance. Peale collected thousands of specimens of birds and other animals for his museum by soliciting donations or hunting them himself. The museum's receding shelves display animal species organized by Linnaean classification, and above them are portraits of revolutionary heroes and other notable Americans, whose placement suggests the position of humans in the great chain of being. Peale believed that physiognomy, whether of humans in portraits or of animal specimens, provided insight into character. To Peale, the behavior of animals served as a model for a moral, productive, and socially harmonious society. In the far background a child represents posterity benefiting from the museum's lessons in natural history.Miller, Lillian B. (1990). \\"Charles Willson Peale\\" in James Vinson (ed.), International Dictionary of Art and Artists vol. 2, Art. Detroit: St. James Press; pp. 622‚Äì23. . Likewise the woman nearer to the foreground represents the museum's power to inspire feelings of awe and wonder in the face of the sublime. Yet as the space recedes, so does Peale's life and the intellectual and scientific culture of the time‚Äîthe American Enlightenment.

Function  This gene encodes a protein that belongs to the non-histone chromosomal high-mobility group (HMG) protein family. HMG proteins function as architectural factors and are essential components of the enhanceosome. This protein contains structural DNA-binding domains and may act as a transcriptional regulating factor. Identification of the deletion, amplification, and rearrangement of this gene that are associated with lipomas suggests a role in adipogenesis and mesenchymal differentiation. A gene knock-out study of the mouse counterpart demonstrated that this gene is involved in diet-induced obesity. Alternate transcriptional splice variants, encoding different isoforms, have been characterized. The expression of HMGA2 in adult tissues is commonly associated with both malignant and benign tumor formation, as well as certain characteristic cancer-promoting mutations. Homologous proteins with highly conserved sequences are found in other mammalian species, including lab mice (Mus musculus). HMGA2 contains three basic DNA-binding domains (AT-hooks) that cause the protein to bind to adenine-thymine (AT)-rich regions of nuclear DNA. HMGA2 does not directly promote or inhibit the transcription of any genes, but alters the structure of DNA and promotes the assembly of protein complexes that do regulate the transcription of genes. With few exceptions, HMGA2 is expressed in humans only during early development, and is reduced to undetectable or nearly undetectable levels of transcription in adult tissues. The microRNA let-7 is largely responsible for this time-dependent regulation of HMGA2. The apparent function of HMGA2 in proliferation and differentiation of cells during development is supported by the observation that mice with mutant HMGA2 genes are unusually small (pygmy phenotype), and genome-wide association studies linking HMGA2-associated SNPs to variation in human height.  Regulation by let-7  Let-7 inhibits production of specific proteins by complementary binding to their mRNA transcripts. The HMGA2 mature mRNA transcript contains seven regions complementary or nearly complementary to let-7 in its 3' untranslated region (UTR). Let-7 expression is very low during early human development, which coincides with the greatest transcription of HMGA2. The time-dependent drop in HMGA2 expression is caused by a rise in let-7 expression.  Clinical significance = Relationship with cancer  Heightened expression of HMGA2 is found in a variety of human cancers, but the precise mechanism by which HMGA2 contributes to the formation of cancer is unknown. The same mutations that lead to pituitary adenomas in mice can be found in similar cancers in humans. Its presence is associated with poor prognosis for the patient, but also with sensitization of the cancer cells to certain forms of cancer therapy. To be specific, HMGA2-high cancers display an abnormally strong response to double strand breaks in DNA caused by radiation therapy and some forms of chemotherapy. Artificial addition of HMGA2 to some forms of cancer unresponsive to DNA damage cause them to respond to the treatment instead, although the mechanism by which this phenomenon occurs is also not understood. However, the expression of HMGA2 is also associated with increased rates of metastasis in breast cancer, and both metastasis and recurrence of squamous cell carcinoma. These properties are responsible for patients' poor prognoses. As with HMGA2's effects on the response to radiation and chemotherapy, the mechanism by which HMGA2 exerts these effects is unknown.  Characteristic mutations in HMGA2-high cancers  A very common finding in HMGA2-high cancers is the under-expression of let-7. This is not unexpected, given let-7's natural role in the regulation of HMGA2. However, many cancers are found with normal levels of let-7 that are also HMGA2 high. Many of these cancers express the normal HMGA2 protein, but the mature mRNA transcript is truncated, missing a portion of the 3'UTR that contains the critical let-7 complementary regions. Without these, let-7 is unable to bind to HMGA2 mRNA, and, thus, is unable to repress it. The truncated mRNAs may arise from a chromosomal translocation that results in loss of a portion of the HMGA2 gene. ERCC1 Overexpressed HMGA2 may play a role in the frequent repression of ERCC1 in cancers. The let-7a miRNA normally represses the HMGA2 gene, and in normal adult tissues, almost no HMGA2 protein is present. (See also Let-7 microRNA precursor.) Reduction or absence of let-7a miRNA allows high expression of the HMGA2 protein. As shown by Borrmann et al., HMGA2 targets and modifies the chromatin architecture at the ERCC1 gene, reducing its expression. These authors noted that repression of ERCC1 (by HGMA2) can reduce DNA repair, leading to increased genome instability. ERCC1 protein expression is reduced or absent in 84% to 100% of human colorectal cancers. ERCC1 protein expression was also reduced in a diet-related mouse model of colon cancer. As indicated in the ERCC1 article, however, two other epigenetic mechanisms of repression of ERCC1 also may have a role in reducing expression of ERCC1 (promoter DNA methylation and microRNA repression). Chromatin immunoprecipitation Genome-wide analysis of HMGA2 target genes was performed by chromatin immunoprecipitation in a gastric cell line with overexpressed HMGA2, and 1,366 genes were identified as potential targets. The pathways they identified as associated with malignant neoplasia progression were the adherens junction pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, p53 signaling pathway, VEGF signaling pathway, Notch signaling pathway, and TGF beta signaling pathway. Non-homologous end joining DNA repair Li et al. showed that overexpression of HMGA2 delayed the release of DNA-PKcs (needed for non-homologous end joining DNA repair) from double strand break sites. Overexpression of HMGA2 alone was sufficient to induce chromosomal aberrations, a hallmark of deficiency in NHEJ-mediated DNA repair. These properties implicate HMGA2 in the promotion of genome instability and tumorigenesis. Base excision repair pathway Summer et al. found that HGMA2 protein can efficiently cleave DNA containing apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites (is an AP lyase). In addition, this protein also possesses the related 5‚Äô-deoxyribosyl phosphate (dRP) lyase activity. They demonstrated an interaction between human AP endonuclease 1 and HMGA2 in cancer cells, indicating that HMGA2 can be incorporated into the cellular base excision repair (BER) machinery. Increased expression of HMGA2 increased BER, and allowed cells with increased HMGA2 to be resistant to hydroxyurea, a chemotherapeutic agent for solid tumors. Interactions HMGA2 has been shown to interact with PIAS3 and NFKB1. The transport of HMGA2 to the nucleus is mediated by an interaction between its second AT-hook and importin-Œ±2.

It is known for its distinctive natural arch, which at approximately tall is the tallest in Hawaii. At the lower end of the valley is Honop≈´'s secluded, beach, also known as Cathedral Beach. Honop≈´ means \\"conch shell\\", and the valley's name is derived from the conch shell-like sound its arch makes when hit by winds from the north.Valley of the Lost Tribe. Index Stock Imagery, Inc.

Beach-Kaua‚Äôi.‚Äù Kauai Explored. 2008 http://www.kauaiexplored.com/beaches/Honopu-Beach.aspx The valley is isolated and not easily accessible except by water. No landing of any aircraft or boat is allowed in Honop≈´ Valley or on its beach, so visitors must swim from an offshore boat or from neighboring Kalalau Beach. The valley, because of the mystery surrounding the exodus of the people who lived there until the mid-19th century, is sometimes called \\"the valley of the lost tribe.\\" In 1922, visiting archaeologists found several skulls thought to be primitive, pre-Hawaiian people. Later studies of the valley and its artifacts determined all of its residents were clearly Hawaiian, but the erroneous legend endures. As the valley is so hidden and isolated, it is believed to be spiritual: it is a place of temples and burial grounds, and the source of many Hawaiian legends and myths. The burial site for the local chiefs was located on the surrounding cliffs. It was believed that once a chief died, his bones held a supernatural power, and if found by others they could be used against the chief's tribe. When chiefs died, their bones were collected and taken to the cliffs, and the warrior who transported the bones had to die in order to ensure the secrecy of the location of the bones.Honop≈´ Valley. Kauai-Hawaii. 5 February 2008 http://www.kauai-Hawaii.com/destinations.php?1 In 1983 a skeleton was discovered at the top of the arch while exploring the valley that led to the source of waterfall that fell on the beach. A skull and vertebrae were eroding out of the soil and the vertebrae were rolling down the incline from the steep location. The land on Honop≈´ Valley is highly fertile; a castaway could survive there simply on the large amount of wild fruit, such as guavas and grapefruit, that grows along its coast. A view of the NƒÅ Pali Coast from the ocean  Menehune  The only available information about the ancient mythological Menehune people of Polynesia comes from the stories told by natives. Native Hawaiians refer to the Menehune as being the ‚Äúkamaaina‚Äù, or \\"children of the land\\".Katharine Luomala. The Menehune of Polynesia and Other Mythical Little People of Oceania. Bernice P. Bishop Museum Bulletin 203. Honolulu, Hawaii, 1951. 3-6, 10, & 19. While they may simply be mythical, the Menehune are said to have lived throughout the Hawaiian Islands, including Kauai, which they inhabited in large numbers. The Honopu Valley is also known as \\"the valley of the lost tribe\\" because it was the home of the last Menehune.  Travel  Honop≈´ Ridge, above the cliffs, can be visited with a few miles' walk. The view along the way includes that of the ocean and the beach of Honop≈´. There are tour boats that travel along the coast and helicopters offering aerial views of the valley.Cruise The Na pali Coast, Tours and Attraction.

Honop≈´ Valley in film  Aircraft and boats that are part of Hollywood film productions are the only ones allowed in Honop≈´ Valley. Honop≈´ Valley is perhaps most famous for its appearances in the 1976 remake of King Kong and in the 1998 movie Six Days Seven Nights. In the 1976 remake of King Kong the beaches and jungles of Kauai, Hawaii stood in for South Pacific. Originally only the jungle scenes were to be shot in Hawaii and the rest on Zuma Beach, California.Morton, Ray. King Kong: The history of a movies icon from Fay Wray to Peter Jackson. New York: Applause Theatre & Cinema Books, 2005.186-187. Producer Dino De Laurentiis, however, was so pleased with Hawaii that he decided to film all the beach scenes at Honop≈´ and Kalalau Valley. The producers and production crew of King Kong were told that Honop≈´ Valley was uninhabited, but on the day that they arrived to start filming, they were shocked to find honeymooners on the beach.Morton, Ray. King Kong: The history of a movies icon from Fay Wray to Peter Jackson. New York: Applause Theatre & Cinema Books, 2005.186-187. Scenes that involved filming in the ocean were hard to film due to the 12-foot-high waves. Most of the crew got seasick and one filming boat almost capsized. Examples of involved scenes are when the party arrive on Skull Island and the nighttime arrival to rescue Dwan; other scenes are the arrival of equipment to capture King Kong and Fred Wilson directing the rescue mission. For the film Six Days Seven Nights, Hawaii stood in for French Polynesia. Among the scenes filmed on Honop≈´ Beach is the one in which Harrison Ford runs from pirates. The arch is also included in the film.Honopu Valley.

He is also the co-owner of the Charlotte-based Professional Wrestling Federation and its wrestling school with longtime rival George South. Among the wrestlers he and South have trained over the years include Henry Godwin, Ron Killings and the Hardy Boyz. He was instrumental in bringing the latter to the WWF in 1994. Professional wrestling career Gary Sabaugh, also known as the pro wrestler The Italian Stallion, has had many television appearances in the NWA, WCW, WWF, Georgia Championship Wrestling with WTBS, Florida Championship Wrestling, and New Japan Pro Wrestling. In addition to a 23-year-career in professional wrestling, Sabaugh was also a sitcom actor and stunt man. Jim Crockett Promotions Teaming with Buzz Sawyer and \\"Pistol\\" Pez Whatley against Bob Roop and NWA National Tag Team Champions Ole and Arn Anderson on May 11, he would face a number of veteran wrestlers throughout 1985 including Terry Flynn, Black Bart, and appeared at the first Starcade '85 losing to Thunderfoot#1 on November 28. Two days later, he also teamed with Rocky King against The Midnight Express on November 30, 1985. Teaming with Koko B. Ware during the first annual Jim Crockett, Sr. Memorial Cup Tournament in April 1986, they were defeated in the opening round by Buzz Sawyer and Rick Steiner. The following year, he and Ricky Lee Jones lost to Ronnie & Jimmy Garvin in the opening rounds of the second annual Jim Crockett, Sr. Memorial Cup Tournament on April 11, 1987. In his third appearance at the Jim Crockett, Sr. Memorial Cup Tournament, he and Kendall Windham would defeat Green Machine and Terminator by forfeit on before losing to Arm Anderson & Tully Blanchard in the quarterfinals in April 1988. World Championship Wrestling Sabaugh continued working for World Championship Wrestling (WCW), which was Jim Crockett Promotions renamed after the latter's sale to Ted Turner in November 1988. Sabaugh would wrestle members of The Varsity Club facing Mike Rotunda in late 1988 and team with \\"Dr. Death\\" Steve Williams and Nikita Koloff in a 6-man tag team match against Rotunda, Rick Steiner and Al Perez on September 25 before losing to Steve Williams at Clash of the Champions IV on December 7, 1988. During that year, he was the wrestling advisor for the short-lived sitcom Learning the Ropes and, along with \\"Dr. Death\\" Steve Williams, was a stunt double for the Lyle Alzado's character The Masked Maniac. He would team with Brett Sawyer and The Nasty Boys in an 8-man tag team match against Johnny Ace, The Terminator and Southern Force on March 11, 1989. Later career Appearing less often during the early 1990s, making an appearance on WCW Power Hour teamed with Reno Riggins against The Fabulous Freebirds on January 19, he was absent from WCW television for much of 1991. This may be due to Sabaugh and wrestler George South having founded the Professional Wrestling Federation in 1990. Originally based in Charlotte, North Carolina, the Promotion ran shows in the old Crockett territories in North and South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia until its closure in 1999. Sabaugh and South would continue their decade long feud while in PWF, which involved female wrestlers Mad Maxine and her mother Mama Maxine for a time, trading the PWF heavyweight title several times and at one point forming a tag team with South, winning the tag team titles before they began fighting each other again. At the same time, Sabough continued working for other companies. His WCW appearances increased in 1992, and included a bout for the World Tag Team Championship on September 15 in Macon, Georgia, teaming with Ricky Nelson in a losing effort against Steve Williams and Terry Gordy. He would contest the following year for the Television Championship, losing to \\"Mr. Wonderful\\" Paul Orndorff on April 3, 1993, and twice more for Tag Team Championship, partnering with Chris Sullivan on April 6 and Rex Cooper on April 27, losing both times to The Hollywood Blonds. Sabaugh's last appearance for WCW would be with George South in a tag team match against Kent & Keith Cole at a house show at the Brushfork Armory in Bluefield, West Virginia on August 20, 1993. Sabaugh would also wrestle for a time in the World Wrestling Federation during the mid-1990s. Though he would never get higher than lower mid-card status, he did help a very young Matt & Jeff Hardy break into the WWF as jobbers. Though the Hardys would make $150 per appearance as jobbers, Sabaugh would charge them $100 per appearance. According to Matt Hardy in the 2008 DVD Twist of Fate: The Matt & Jeff Hardy Story, Sabaugh ended up leaving the Hardys stranded in Charlotte, North Carolina where the three were supposed to meet before traveling to a show in Macon, Georgia. In the process, Sabaugh left the Hardys to fend for themselves, but still wanted to collect the $100 per appearance fee from the boys. Matt later told Bruce Prichard about what happened, and the WWF would contact the Hardys directly thereafter for jobbing before the two would eventually sign with WWF full-time in 1998. Sabaugh was released afterwards partially due to the incident. Sabaugh's last match would be a successful defense of the PWF Heavyweight against George South on March 29, 1997 at The Armory in Greer, South Carolina.

Inhabitants of M√©dan are called M√©danais. Geography M√©dan is located in the Seine Valley, surrounded by the towns of Triel-sur-Seine to the northeast, Villennes-sur-Seine to the south, Orgeval and Morainvilliers to the southeast, and Vernouillet to the northwest. The village counts about 1,500 residents and has very little commercial activity. It is a bedroom community for people working in Paris. While the commune is partially urbanized, green space comprises 66% of the territory. It has a primary school, a Romanesque church (open from Easter to Toussaint) and a municipal meeting room (Salle Maeterlinck). M√©dan is divided by the secondary roads RD 164 and RD 154. M√©dan is also served by the highways A13 and A14 or by Poissy station of the RER line A and the Transilien Paris ‚Äì Saint-Lazare suburban rail line at Villennes-sur-Seine. History and Culture In the ninth century, the village was known as Magedon, and consisted of a feudal manor and 24 small houses. C√©zanne, Ch√¢teau de M√©dan (1880) The castle of M√©dan The castle of M√©dan was built in the late fifteenth century. During the Renaissance, the castle was frequented by Pierre de Ronsard and the poets of the Pl√©iade (Du Bellay, Ba√Øf ...) who came to hunt and write poems. Paul C√©zanne painted it three times from 1879 to 1881. Maurice Maeterlinck, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1911, moved to the castle in 1924 where he wrote La vie des Termites and L‚ÄôAraign√©e de verre. The castle, abandoned after World War II and then damaged by fire in 1956, has been on the national registry of historical monuments since 1926. The newspaper ¬´Combat¬ª was printed there from 1966 to 1974. Today, the restored property is in private hands and open for visits by appointment only. √âmile Zola‚Äôs House √âmile Zola‚Äôs House Thanks to the success of L‚ÄôAssommoir, French writer √âmile Zola acquired a house in M√©dan in May 1878 that he referred to as a ‚Äúrabbit hutch‚Äù. Over three years, he transformed it into a manor house where he led a relaxed lifestyle, with his garden and farm. He designed the park of which he always dreamed. During the summer in M√©dan, Zola hosted C√©zanne, his childhood friend, and other artists such as √âdouard Manet and Camille Pissarro, and naturalist writers such as Alphonse Daudet, Guy de Maupassant and J.K. Huysmans. The writers combined their efforts in a literary collection entitled Les soir√©es de M√©dan (M√©dan Evenings) (1880) named after the amusing evenings they had spent in Zola‚Äôs home. Zola split his time between M√©dan and Paris, where he died on 28 September 1902. In 1905, Alexandrine Zola, his widow, donated the house to a newly created Zola Foundation. It served as a convalescent home for children and eventually a nursing school before being turned into a museum in 1985. The property was taken in hand by the Association pour la Rayonnement de l‚ÄôOeuvre d‚Äô√âmile Zola (Association for the Promulgation of the Works of √âmile Zola) in 1998. The Association, led by financier Pierre Berg√© and his partner, fashion designer Yves St. Laurent, spearheaded efforts to restore the house, develop the museum, and add a wing dedicated to Alfred Dreyfus. Some 10,000 people visited the house and garden annually in the 2000s. The Zola-Dreyfus Project construction led to closing the house to visits in 2011 for an anticipated four years. The project includes renovation of √âmile Zola‚Äôs house and the creation of the Dreyfus Museum, which will be a place for exhibiting and teaching, for debates and reflection, for memory and vigilance.

Movements  This work has four movements: # Adagio (A major) ‚Äì Allegro vivace (A minor, sonata form*) # Adagio non lento (F major) # Intermezzo: Allegretto con moto (A minor) ‚Äì Allegro di molto** (A major) # Presto*** (A minor) ‚Äì Adagio non lento (A major) A typical performance lasts about 28 minutes. * Mendelssohn originally wrote the repeat sign for the exposition, but later the repeat sign was removed in copyist's manuscript. ** Autograph gives poco pi√π mosso, which is replaced first by Pi√π Presto, then Allegro di molto, in copyist's manuscript. *** Composer used Molto Allegro in autograph, it was replaced by Presto in copyist's manuscript. Composition The motif of Mendelssohn's song \\"Ist es Wahr?\\", and the motif as it appears in the opening Adagio of the quartet.Though Mendelssohn was still a teenager when he wrote this quartet, he was already an experienced composer of chamber music. He had already written the string quintet opus 18, the octet for strings opus 20, and three piano quartets,IMSLP besides several youthful string quartets which remained unpublished. He had a few months before produced his opera Die Hochzeit des Camacho, which was not a success. (His quartet Opus 12, though it bears an earlier opus number, was actually written two years later.) Mendelssohn wrote the quartet a few months after the death of Ludwig van Beethoven, and the influence of Beethoven's late string quartets (written only shortly before and some of which had not even been published when Mendelssohn started his composition) is evident in this work. Beethoven's late works received a lukewarm reception at best, and many ‚Äî including Mendelssohn's own father ‚Äî agreed with composer Louis Spohr that they were an \\"indecipherable, uncorrected horror\\". Mendelssohn, however, was fascinated by them: he studied all the scores he could obtain and included several allusions to Beethoven's quartets in opus 13. But more than being simply a homage to his great predecessor, Mendelssohn's quartet takes the implications of Beethoven's late quartets - above all their suggestions of cyclic formal organization - and develops them in radically new directions. As Benedict Taylor writes in a very detailed analysis, this quartet \\"is the most thorough-going essay in cyclic form, both by Mendelssohn and by any composer to that time, until the late works of Franck at the very least\\".Benedict Taylor, 'Cyclic Form, Time and Memory in Mendelssohn's A minor Quartet, Op. 13', The Musical Quarterly, 93/1 (2010), 46 As a unifying motif, Mendelssohn included a quotation from his song \\"Ist es wahr?\\" ('Is it true?', op. 9 no. 1) - \\"Is it true that you wait for me in the arbour by the vineyard wall?\\" - composed a few months earlier.Mendelssohn attributed the poem to 'H. Voss', which might be a pseudonym of his classics tutor Johann Gustav Droysen, although the composer's nephew claimed Mendelssohn wrote the poem himself. See Douglass Seaton, \\"With Words: Mendelssohn‚Äôs Vocal Songs,\\" in The Mendelssohn Companion (Westport: Greenwood Press, 2001) Mendelssohn includes the title of the song in the score of the quartet, recalling the title Beethoven wrote on the last movement of his Op. 135 string quartet \\"Muss es sein?\\" (Must it be?). But, unlike the introspective, existential quality of Beethoven's quartet, Mendelssohn's work is passionate and richly romantic. \\"...This quartet, relying heavily on compositional techniques of late Beethoven, links Classical form to Romantic expression,\\" writes Lucy Miller.Miller, Lucy (2006) Adams to Zemlinsky Concert Artists Guild , p. 168 Analysis The three-note motif from \\"Ist es wahr?\\", presented in an opening Adagio in the key of A Major, establishes the cyclic form of the quartet; derivatives of the motif appear in all four of the movements, and the opening theme concludes the quartet.For a complete analysis of this quartet, see , and Taylor, Cyclic Form, Time and Memory in Mendelssohn's A minor Quartet, Op. 13 After the Adagio introduction, the quartet breaks into a tumultuous Allegro Vivace in Sonata form in A minor. \\"You will hear its notes resound in the first and last movements, and sense its feeling in all four\\" wrote Mendelssohn to a friend.Ibid. So the quartet, which is mostly in minor keys, and is primarily minor in character, opens and closes in a major key ‚Äî a rather daring departure from standard quartet- writing practice of the time. Many writers have seen a resemblance to Beethoven's Op. 132 quartet: that quartet, also, has an opening adagio, then a first theme built of running sixteenth notes and a lyrical passage, which is loosely akin to an inversion of Mendelssohn's theme.For a comparison of the quartet with Beethoven's opus 132, see Gregory John Vitercik, The Early Works of Felix Mendelssohn: A Study in the Romantic Sonata Style (1992) Taylor & Francis, , pp 227-229; and Uri Golomb, ‚ÄúMendelssohn‚Äôs creative response to late Beethoven: Polyphony and thematic identity in Mendelssohn‚Äôs Quartet in A-major Op. 13‚Äù, Ad Parnassum: A Journal of Eighteenth- and Nineteenth-Century Instrumental Music, Volume 4, Issue 7 (April 2006): 101-119. Mendelssohn had actually completed his first movement before Beethoven's Op. 132 was published. The fugal motifs from the slow movements of Mendelssohn's Opus 13 (top) and Beethoven's Opus 95 (bottom). Second violin and viola parts are shown. The Adagio movement has a middle slow, fugal section which is modelled after the fugal middle section of the slow movement of Beethoven's Op. 95. The subjects of both fugues are sinuous melodies that slide down chromatically, moving from viola to second violin and then to the other voices. Like the Beethoven model, the fugue goes through a series of increasingly complex variations with cross-rhythms in the different instruments. The theme of the Intermezzo movement, with lyrical violin theme and pizzicato accompaniment. The Intermezzo movement opens with a light, gossamer theme which is Mendelssohn's signature style. The lilting theme in the first violin, with pizzicato accompaniment in the other instruments, recalls the A Midsummer Night's Dream Overture and scherzo movements from many of Mendelssohn's chamber works. The violin cadenzas, with tremolo accompaniment, that introduce the final movements of the Mendelssohn quartet (top) and the Beethoven opus 132 (bottom). First and second violin parts shown.The themes of the finales of the Mendelssohn quartet and Beethoven opus 132. Note the cello parts and the interlocking inner voices (viola part in the Mendelssohn, second violin in the Beethoven. Fourth part not shown). The final movement of Beethoven's Op. 132 quartet is a prototype for the opening of Mendelssohn's last movement: it begins with a cadenza interlude in the first violin, leading into a fast, melodic movement with a driving bass line in the cello which is similar to the cello part of Op. 132.

The AARD code was a segment of code in a beta release of Microsoft Windows 3.1 that would determine whether Windows was running on MS-DOS or PC DOS, rather than a competing workalike such as DR-DOS, and would result in a cryptic error message in the latter case. This XOR-encrypted, self-modifying, and deliberately obfuscated machine code used a variety of undocumented DOS structures and functions to perform its work, and appeared in the installer, WIN.COM, and several other executables in the OS. The AARD code was originally discovered by Geoff Chappell on 17 April 1992 and then further analyzed and documented in a joint effort with Andrew Schulman. The name was derived from Microsoft programmer Aaron R. Reynolds (1955‚Äì2008), who used \\"AARD\\" to sign his work; \\"AARD\\" was found in the machine code of the installer. Microsoft disabled the AARD code for the final release of Windows 3.1, but did not remove it, so that it could have become reactivated later by the change of a single byte in an installed system, thereby constituting a \\"smoking gun\\". DR- DOS publisher Digital Research released a patch named \\"business update\\" in 1992 to enable the AARD tests to pass on its operating system. The rationale for the AARD code came to light when internal memos were released during the United States v. Microsoft Corp. antitrust case in 1999. Internal memos released by Microsoft revealed that the specific focus of these tests was DR- DOS. At one point, Microsoft CEO Bill Gates sent a memo to a number of employees, reading \\"You never sent me a response on the question of what things an app would do that would make it run with MS-DOS and not run with DR- DOS. Is there feature they have that might get in our way?\\" Microsoft Senior Vice President Brad Silverberg later sent another memo, stating: \\"What the [user] is supposed to do is feel uncomfortable, and when he has bugs, suspect that the problem is DR-DOS and then go out to buy MS-DOS.\\" Following the purchase of DR-DOS by Novell and its renaming to \\"Novell DOS\\", Microsoft Co- President Jim Allchin stated in a memo, \\"If you're going to kill someone there isn't much reason to get all worked up about it and angry. Any discussions beforehand are a waste of time. We need to smile at Novell while we pull the trigger.\\" What had been DR-DOS changed hands again. The new owner, Caldera, Inc., began a lawsuit against Microsoft over the AARD code, Caldera v. Microsoft, which was later settled. It was believed that the settlement ran in the order of $150 million, but was revealed in November 2009 with the release of the Settlement Agreement to be $280 million.

Over the next two years, he and his assistant Eugen Fink expanded and elaborated on the text of these lectures. These expanded lectures were first published in a 1931 French translation by Gabrielle Peiffer and Emmanuel Levinas with advice from Alexandre Koyr√©. They were published in German, along with the original Pariser Vortrage, in 1950, and again in an English translation by Dorion Cairns in 1960, based on a typescript of the text (Typescript C) which Husserl had designated for Cairns in 1933. The Cartesian Meditations were never published in German during Husserl's lifetime, a fact which has led some commentators to conclude that Husserl had become dissatisfied with the work in relation to its aim, namely an introduction to transcendental phenomenology. The text introduces the main features of Husserl's mature transcendental phenomenology, including (not exhaustively) the transcendental reduction, the epoch√©, static and genetic phenomenology, eidetic reduction, and eidetic phenomenology. In the Fourth Meditation, Husserl argues that transcendental phenomenology is nothing other than transcendental idealism. The name Cartesian Meditations refers to Ren√© Descartes' Meditations on First Philosophy. Thus Husserl wrote: Contents The work is divided into five \\"meditations\\" of varying length, whose contents are as follows: #First Meditation: The Way to the Transcendental Ego #Second Meditation: The Field of Transcendental Experience #Third Meditation: Constitutional Problems #Fourth Meditation: Constitutional Problems Pertaining to the Transcendental Ego Itself #Fifth Meditation: Transcendental Being as Monadological Intersubjectivity Editions * Meditations Cartesiennes: Introduction √† la phenomenologie. 1931.

It currently lies on the northern edge of the county borough of Blaenau Gwent in Wales. According to the 2011 census, the population of the ward and community of Beaufort is 3,866 The settlement arose on the boundary of two parishes, Llangattock in Brecknockshire and Aberystruth in Monmouthshire on the 1779 establishment of the Beaufort Iron Works by Edward and Jonathan Kendall (Cendl) after whom the new settlement was first named. NB The photograph is of the 'New Rassau estate'. Built late fifties- seventies. The information above, pertains to the village commonly known as 'The Old Rassau', but recognised by the local Authority as one community called 'Rassau'. Description The village's name derives from the fact that much of the local land was originally owned by the Duke of Beaufort. The border between Beaufort and Ebbw Vale itself is generally considered to be the Ebbw River which passes close to St David's Church (Church in Wales). 'Carmeltown', presumably so-called because of the presence of Carmel Chapel, lies between the Rassau and the rest of Beaufort. Confusingly, the 'rest of Beaufort' (i.e. geographically the eastern part of Beaufort) is frequently simply referred to as 'Beaufort' or 'Beaufort Hill'. Postcard to address in Beaufort, labelled as Breconshire, 1920s The eastern end of Beaufort is more densely populated than Carmeltown or the border areas of Rassau or Brynmawr. Beaufort was administratively part of Brecknockshire, but was transferred to the administrative county of Monmouthshire as part of the urban district of Ebbw Vale in 1888. However, even in the 1920s, 'Beaufort Breconshire' was still widely used in postal correspondence. Subsequent local government changes incorporated it into the Blaenau Gwent district of Gwent in 1974 and the unitary authority of Blaenau Gwent in 1996. Beaufort and parts of nearby Badminton and Rassau are widely seen as being some of the most affluent areas in the County. House prices in these area are some of the most expensive in the area, with a new housing development at the top of Beaufort Hill being developed with house starting around ¬£200,000 - ¬£300,000. The village also has a theatre with a ball room where many famous people played at the start of their careers. One of the most famous was Tommy Scott who later went on to become known worldwide as Sir Tom Jones. Up until 1958 the village was served by Beaufort railway station, a station on the LNWR railway line from Abergavenny - Merthyr. In 2010 the Beaufort community (civil parish) was replaced by three smaller communities, named Beaufort (including the village and the area to the north), Badminton (to the south) and Rassau (to the west). Welsh Historically, the language of Beaufort was Welsh. The Reverend Peter Williams' monograph, 'The Story of Carmel', concerning Carmel Congregational Church (chapel) in Beaufort, published in 1965 is useful here. Williams reports that between 1904 and 1906, the change was made to conduct the morning Sunday service (the less prestigious service) in English, whereas previously both the morning and evening services had been in Welsh. This is consistent with Beaufort being bilingual with both Welsh and English-language chapels until at least the end of the 19th century with the Welsh language surviving well into the 20th century before rapidly disappearing as a native language by World War II. Elements of a Welsh service continued (e.g. in Carmel Chapel) until the 1970s. Amongst its Nonconformist chapels, the Welsh Independent Congregational Chapel 'Carmel' was pre-eminent, rising to national fame under the leadership of Thomas Rees DD (author of History of Protestant Nonconformity in Wales, whose second edition was printed in 1883). According to the 2001 census, 440 residents, or 11.7% of the village's population aged 3 and over can now speak Welsh.Spreading the Word: the Welsh Language 2001 This gives Beaufort the highest percentage of Welsh Speakers in Blaenau Gwent.

They have performed in many prestigious venues all around the world, and are one of the most famous choirs in Wales. The Beaufort Male Choir, one of the oldest in Wales, was founded at the end of the eighteenth century. Today‚Äôs choir was reformed after the Second World War in 1947 and this year we are celebrating sixty years of successful music making. Though times and circumstances have changed, we, like our predecessors still aspire to the highest ideals of male voice singing. However, whereas they placed great emphasis on competition in Eisteddfodau with significant success, we for the past forty years have concentrated exclusively on concert work This allows us greater musical freedom and affords us the opportunity of performing in the principal concert halls through the UK and Europe. One of the most noticeable changes in perspective has occurred in recent years with the introduction of an international dimension. For in those years the choir has undertaken tours to Germany, Malta, France, the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland. In addition, the choir has played host to choirs from Germany, the Netherlands, the United States and Japan. Among the highlights in recent years was the accolade of singing before heads of state at Kensington Palace and also before His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales. Annual Concert 2009 with RHYDIAN. Also concerts at La Maison Blance in Oxford and St Mary's Chapel in Westminster. Under the musical direction of Craig James and Accompanist Margaret Davies, the choir has a much varied repertoire ranging from Welsh and English Hymns, spirituals and modern ballads as well as the more traditional male voice works. 2011 Annual concert featured Hayley Westenra. In May 2012 the choir performed at Ebbw Vale with the famous tenor Alfie Boe and performed with Katie Treharne from the West Ends production of Phantom of the Opera in September.

In 1833, by which time there were four furnaces, the works were taken over as an extension of their Nantyglo operations by the Bailey brothers, Joseph and Crawshay who put their sister‚Äôs son, William Partridge (1800‚Äì1862), in charge. Unmarried Agents (senior managers) of the local iron works companies lodged at the Rhyd- y-Blew, a drovers' inn, properly the hunting lodge of the Duke of Beaufort who carried out an annual rough-shoot of the area. The inn was at the end of the toll road from Merthyr Tydfil and for the rest of the year provided the drovers‚Äô animals very good pasture and water in the Ebbw river. Suffolk-born Partridge married Charlotte Bevan, daughter of the Rhyd-y-Blew‚Äôs innkeeper, and remained in charge of the Beaufort iron works until his early death in 1862. The works soon closed. In conjunction with the then well-known Needham family of Beaufort mining engineers Partridge sons became involved in local collieries and established the substantial business later known as Partridge Jones. Grandson, rugby international and Barbarian, \\"Birdie\\" Partridge founded the Army Rugby Union. The Beaufort works house eventually became a fever hospital in 1902 and has since been demolished. The ground, just south of Beaufort Hill, and close to a Chapel of Rest in the area known as Glanyafon, once occupied by the iron works has long been cleared and covered with houses. Giant pieces of slag remained in place until the most recent developments.

Appointed to the legislature in 2007, Ferrandino represented House District 2, encompassing south central Denver from 2012 to 2014. He is the first openly gay male legislator in Colorado history. He did not seek re- election in 2014, and is currently the chief financial officer of Denver Public Schools.http://co.chalkbeat.org/2014/06/18/colorado-speaker-mark- ferrandino-to-join-denver-public- schools/#.VOSu7URkAtshttp://www.denverpost.com/opinion/ci_27380544/new-higher- education-funding-model Biography Ferrandino, the son of two Italian- American public school teachers, was born in Nyack, New York. He was born with oxygen deprivation and had to have surgery because he was cross eyed. Suffering from multiple learning difficulties, he took special education classes until the fourth grade. He later joined mainstream classes, played the trumpet and captained his high school track team. Ferrandino graduated from Clarkstown High School South in 1995 and earned a bachelor's degree in political science and economics in 1999 and a master's degree in public policy analysis in 2000 both from the University of Rochester. While in school, Ferrandino was a collegiate pole vaulter. He began his political career in 1997, spending a semester as intern for Congressman Chuck Schumer of New York. After working for several years in Washington, DC as a program analyst for the United States Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General, and as a policy analyst for the White House Office of Management and Budget, Ferrandino relocated to Colorado when his partner, Gregory, took a job with the U.S. Customs Service. He now lives in the Baker neighborhood of Denver and is a member of the Baker Historic Neighborhood Association. Ferrandino has played the trumpet since the fourth grade and continues to play regularly. Ferrandino worked as a senior budget analyst in the Colorado Department of Health Care and Financing from 2005 until his legislative appointment in 2007. He was also active in Democratic Party politics as treasurer of the Colorado Democratic Party and co-captain for Colorado House District 2A. Ferrandino was named Colorado Young Democrat of the Year in 2007. He is also a former co-chairman of the Colorado Stonewall Democrats, and served on the board of directors for the National Stonewall Democrats. Ferrandino is a twin, and younger brother. His twin Nicole is a business analyst for the University of Colorado Denver and his older brother Micheal is a surgeon at Duke Medical Center in North Carolina. He has two nieces and nephews, Abbey and Owen who live in CO, as well as Hayden and John in NC. He has an adopted daughter with his spouse Gregory Wertsch and they live in the Baker community of Denver. Legislative career=2007 legislative appointment In September 2007, Rep. Mike Cerbo resigned from the legislature in order to become director of the Colorado AFL- CIO. Ferrandino was elected to Cerbo's seat in the Colorado House of Representatives in September 2007 by the 2nd District Vacancy Committee on a vote of 23‚Äì3. Both Ferrandino and his opponent in the vacancy election, Doug Williams, were openly gay; Ferrandino became the first openly gay man to serve in the Colorado General Assembly. He served as one of four openly LGBT members of the legislature, alongside Sens. Pat Steadman (D‚ÄìDenver) and Luc√≠a Guzm√°n (D‚ÄìDenver), as well as Rep. Sue Schafer (D‚ÄìWheat Ridge). Ferrandino was sworn into the legislature on October 1, 2007, and was elected to a full term in November 2008. Assuming he is re-elected at two-year intervals, term limits will prevent him seeking a fifth House term in 2014, despite the fact that he would not have served four full terms. Ferrandino has declared his legislative priorities to include health care, consumer protection, and TABOR reform. 2008 legislative session For his first legislative session, in 2008, Ferrandino was named to the House Business Affairs and Labor Committee and the House State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee. Ferrandino has named health care and education as his top legislative priorities. For the 2008 legislative session, Ferrandino is exploring regulation requiring greater transparency and guaranteed lifetimes for gift cards, and plans to sponsor a bill to direct funds from fines collected from scammers to educate the public about consumer scams. Ferrandino has also sponsored a bill to allow some lesser criminal convictions to be sealed from public inspection. He has also proposed, with Rep. Sara Gagliardi, the \\"American Dream Protection Act of 2008,\\" which would allow judges to delay home foreclosures by 90 days, in response to the ongoing subprime mortgage crisis. The bill was amended in the legislature to only increase public outreach efforts and notification requirements before passing the state house. He has also introduced the Colorado Payday Lending Reform Act, which would cap interest rates for payday lending at 36 percent and prohibit additional lending to borrowers already in debt, making Colorado's short-term lending regulation the strictest in the nation. The bill narrowly passed the state house on a vote of 33-30, and passed the state senate on 19-16 after being significantly amended. Ferrandino objected to senate amendments, claiming that they weakened the bill by loosening caps on lending fees. Several weeks later, Ferrandino and Senate cosponsor Peter Groff announced that they intended to kill the bill, but Ferrandino plans on re-introducing the bill during the 2009 session. 2008 election Ferrandino stood for election to a full term in 2008. In the Democratic Party primary, he faced former Eagle County commissioner James Johnson. Ferrandino easily won the Democratic nomination with over 81 percent of the vote, and faced Republican Thomas \\"Doc\\" Miller in the general election, winning handily. Ferrandino's re-election bid was endorsed by the Denver Post, and he easily won a full term in the legislature with 80 percent of the popular vote. Ferrandino was also a member of the Democratic Party's platform committee for the 2008 Democratic National Convention, one of only three Colorado delegates to that committee. 2009 legislative session After winning re-election, Ferrandino was named to a post on the legislature's six- member Joint Budget Committee for the 2009 legislative session, and was tapped as vice-chair of the House Appropriations Committee. He remained on the Joint Budget Committee until his election as Democratic Leader in November 2011. With Sen. Jennifer Veiga, Ferrandino introduced legislation to allow same-sex partners of state employees to receive health insurance benefits. 2010 legislative session2010 election2011 legislative session In 2011, Ferrandino co-sponsored the Colorado Civil Unions Act, introducing it in the House. State Senator Pat Steadman originally introduced it in the Senate, where it passed with bipartisan support. The Colorado Civil Unions Act was an act to create legal recognition for same-sex and heterosexual couples in Colorado law. The act was killed in the Colorado House Judiciary Committee before it was able to reach a full House vote, where Ferrandino held it would have had the votes to pass. See: Recognition of Same-Sex Unions in Colorado: The Colorado Civil Unions Act of 2011 In November 2011, House Democratic Leader Sal Pace announced that he would relinquish his leadership position to campaign for Congress in the 3rd district. Ferrandino ran to succeed him and was elected unopposed by the Democratic caucus on November 18, 2011. 2012 legislative session 2012 election In the 2012 General Election, Representative Ferrandino faced Republican challenger TJ Tyrrell. Ferrandino was reelected by a margin of 70% to 24%. As the longtime Minority Leader, Ferrandino was elected by his caucus as the Speaker of the House of the State of Colorado.

She was an important political figure from the death of her brother Ecgfrith in 685 until her death. According to one account, √Ülfflaed had been afflicted with a crippling disease for some time. One day she thought about Cuthbert and wished she had something belonging to him, for she was certain that would help her. Soon afterwards a messenger arrived with the gift of a linen girdle from Cuthbert. She put this on and within three days was restored to health.\\"Stories form the Life of St. Cuthbert\\", St. Cuthbert's College, Auckland, New Zealand One letter of √Ülfflaed, to Adolana, abbess of Pfalzel, survives in the Bonifatian correspondence, which provides rare evidence for interaction between female religious leaders in the Early Medieval period.Fell, 'Some implications of the Boniface Correspondence', p. 30, In this letter √Ülfflaed seeks advice and assistance for a fellow abbess, who wished to go on pilgrimage to Rome, shedding light on Whitby's Continental connections in the years after Hilda's death.https://epistolae.ctl.columbia.edu/letter/338.html 'Medieval Women's Latin Letters' Her piety was praised by contemporaries such as Bede and Stephen of Ripon. Bede refers to her high degree of holiness and devotion, while Stephen calls her the consoler of the whole kingdom and the best counsellor. √Ülffl√¶d was considered a saint and her feast day was celebrated on 8 February. She was buried at Whitby. A late hagiography, the Vita sanctae Elfledae, survives, collected in John Capgrave's Nova Legenda Angliae of 1516. Excavations in the 1920s by Radford and Peers found several building foundations and two inscribed memorial stones believed to record the deaths of St. √Ülfflaed, Abbess of Whitby, and Cyneburgh, queen of King Oswald.Ziegler, Michelle. \\"Anglian Whitby\\", the Heroic Age, Issue 2, Autumn/Winter 1999 ReferencesSources * .
