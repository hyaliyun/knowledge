Originally from Liverpool, England, he moved to Los Angeles in 1991.  Biography  Paul Greenberg's interest in film making began at the age of 13. His involvement in the production of short films and corporate videos gave him an early education in the basics of film production. At 16 he was awarded the Young Filmmaker Award by Sony for his original production about his hometown Liverpool. When he turned 18, Greenberg was selected from over 2000 applicants to fill one of the 16 places at the Prestigious Manchester Metropolitan University Film Program. Greenberg focused on film production and direction, earning Honors in his Bachelor of Arts degree three years later. The day after his graduation he boarded a flight to Los Angeles. Greenberg quickly moved up the ranks, and within three years had already landed his first film directing gig, shooting \\"It's a Digital World\\" on the Universal Studios Backlot. Featuring a cast of hundreds, this live action kids musical also featured technologically advanced computer animated characters - a groundbreaking feat for its time. Greenberg's most prescient act as director, was to discover a child actress who went on to achieve international acclaim as a Hollywood leading lady. Jessica Biel was a complete unknown when she arrived in Hollywood at the age of 13. Greenberg is proud to have launched Biel's career by casting her in her first on-screen role. Greenberg also produced the feature \\"Angels with Angles\\" starring Rodney Dangerfield and Frank Gorshin (playing the roles of G-d and George Burns respectively) in what would become the final movie performances of their lives. Greenberg chose to focus his attention on the lucrative Direct Response Television business for the next decade, achieving unprecedented success. The 35 half-hour TV shows he produced and directed during that time grossed over $3 Billion dollars in sales. Greenberg worked as Vice-President of production at Sylmark (now IdealLiving) before moving on to serve as Chief Creative Officer for Thane Direct. Greenberg currently runs and operates his own production company Greenberg Direct, Inc. Greenberg recently returned to his movie-making roots and has three screenplays currently in development.

It is the product's demand function minus its supply function. In a pure exchange economy, the excess demand is the sum of all agents' demands minus the sum of all agents' initial endowments. A product's excess supply function is the negative of the excess demand function--it is the product's supply function minus its demand function. In most cases the first derivative of excess demand with respect to price is negative, meaning that a higher price leads to lower excess demand. The price of the product is said to be the equilibrium price if it is such that the value of the excess demand function is zero: that is, when the market is in equilibrium, meaning that the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded. In this situation it is said that the market clears. If the price is higher than the equilibrium price, excess demand will normally be negative, meaning that there is a surplus (positive excess supply) of the product, and not all of it being offered to the marketplace is being sold. If the price is lower than the equilibrium price, excess demand will normally be positive, meaning that there is a shortage. Walras' law implies that, for every price vector, the price‚Äìweighted total excess demand is 0, whether or not the economy is in general equilibrium. This implies that if there is excess demand for one commodity, there must be excess supply for another commodity. Market dynamics The concept of an excess demand function is important in general equilibrium theories, because it acts as a signal for the market to adjust prices. The assumption is that the rate of change of the price of a commodity will be proportional to the value of the excess demand function for that commodity, eventually leading to an equilibrium state in which excess demand for all commodities is zero. If continuous time is assumed, the adjustment process is expressed as a differential equation such as :\\\\frac{dP}{dt}=\\\\lambda \\\\cdot f(P,...) where P is the price, f is the excess demand function, and \\\\lambda is the speed-of-adjustment parameter that can take on any positive finite value (as it goes to infinity we approach the instantaneous-adjustment case). This dynamic equation is stable provided the derivative of f with respect to P is negative--that is, if a rise (or, fall) in the price decreases (or, increases) the extent of excess demand, as would normally be the case. If the market is analyzed in discrete time, then the dynamics are described by a difference equation such as :P_{t+1} = P_t + \\\\delta \\\\cdot f(P_t,...) where P_{t+1} - P_t is the discrete-time analog of the continuous time expression \\\\frac{dP}{dt}, and where \\\\delta is the positive speed-of-adjustment parameter which is strictly less than 1 unless adjustment is assumed to take place fully in a single time period, in which case \\\\delta=1. Sonnenschein‚ÄìMantel‚ÄìDebreu theorem The Sonnenschein‚ÄìMantel‚ÄìDebreu theorem is an important result concerning excess demand functions, proved by G√©rard Debreu, , and Hugo F. Sonnenschein in the 1970s. It states that the excess demand curve for a market populated with utility-maximizing rational agents can take the shape of any function that is continuous, homogeneous of degree zero, and in accord with Walras's law. This implies that market processes will not necessarily reach a unique and stable equilibrium point, because the excess demand curve need not be downward- sloping.

As another, both King Ethelbert and Augustine foresaw the abbey as a burial place for abbots, archbishops, and kings of Kent.William Page, ed., 'Houses of Benedictine monks: The abbey of St Augustine, Canterbury' in A History of the County of Kent: Volume 2 (1926), 126-133 at British History Online, accessed 20 July 2013 William Thorne, the 14th century chronicler of the abbey, records 598 as the year of the foundation.

At St Augustine's Abbey, the Anglo-Saxon buildings were completely reconstructed in the form of a typical Norman Benedictine monastery. By 1100, all the original buildings had disappeared under a Romanesque edifice.

Boggis' history calls this period a time of \\"worldly magnificence,\\" marked by \\"lavish expenditures\\" on new buildings, royal visits, and banquets with thousands of guests. In addition, the papacy imposed many levies on the abbey. The large debt that was incurred by these expenditures might have swamped the abbey had it not been for generous benefactors who came to the rescue.R. J. E. Boggis, A History of St Augustine's Monastery (1901) 70, 85, 96, 103. Available online at Google Books. The cloister, frater (refectory) and kitchen were totally rebuilt. A new abbot's lodging and a great hall were added. In the early 14th century, land was acquired for a cellarer's range (living and working quarters for the cellarer who was responsible for provisioning the abbey's cellarium), a brewhouse, a bakehouse, and a new walled vineyard. A Lady chapel was built to the east of the church. Fyndon‚Äôs Gate The abbey gatehouse was rebuilt from 1301 to 1309 by Abbot Fyndon. It has since been known as the Fyndon Gate or the Great Gate.

J. E. Boggis, A History of St Augustine's Monastery (1901) 111-118, 122. Available online at Google Books. However, the English Reformation accompanied by the Dissolution of the Monasteries happened before bankruptcy. The Reformation replaced the Pope (a cleric) with a Monarch (a layman). Actions by the Parliament's House of Commons strengthened the power of the laity versus the power of the clergy. These actions were part of the English Reformation‚Äôs \\"great transfer\\" of power, both economic and religious, from Ecclesiastical to Secular authorities.A. G. Dickens, English Reformation (Pennsylvania State University, 1991), 167. As part of the \\"great transfer,\\" Parliament gave King Henry VIII authority to dissolve the monasteries and confiscate the property for the Crown. The rationale given was \\"that the religious houses had ceased to apply their property to the specific religious uses for which it was originally given.\\" On 30 July 1538, the King's Commissioners arrived to take the surrender of St Augustine's Abbey. The last abbot and monks complied and left the abbey. The abbey, with its site, its goods, buildings, lands and all other possessions, became the property of the Crown. This dissolution ended over 940 years of monastic presence.Judith Roebuck, St Augustine's Abbey (English Heritage, 1997), 11 and G. F. Maclear, S. Augustine's, Canterbury: Its Rise, Ruin, and Restoration (Wells Gardner, Darton, & Co., 1888) 27. =Dismantling= St Augustine's College chapel During the rest of Henry's reign, St Augustine's Abbey was held by the Crown with some of its buildings converted into a royal residence. However, in other parts of the abbey dismantling and sale of material began in 1541.Judith Roebuck, St Augustine's Abbey (English Heritage, 1997), 13. Some of the stone was used in the fortifications of the Pale of Calais, but more of it was sold locally. The library, containing two thousand manuscripts, was destroyed and the treasure plundered. The royal residence was used occasionally by the royal family as late as the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, during which the buildings were leased to a succession of noblemen. In 1558, Elizabeth leased the palace to Henry Lord Cobham. During Lord Cobham‚Äôs possession, the Queen kept her court here while on one of her royal progresses.Ewell (1896), 14 Lord Cobham was a resident of Kent who had served her faithfully as a diplomat and parliamentarian.Henry Cobham I of Sutton at Hone, Kent (1538-92), sometimes known as Henry Brooke.

After Cecil died in 1612, the residence passed to Edward, Lord Wootton of Marley (sometimes spelled \\"Wotton\\").Ewell (1896), 15 Lord Wootton employed John Tradescant the Elder to lay out formal gardens. Wootton died in 1626, but Lady Wootton lived on in her palace until her death in 1658. The open space before the gateway is still known as Lady Wootton's Green.\\"Lady Wootton‚Äôs Green\\" at http://www.canterbury-archaeology.org.uk/#/wootton/4557759367 Sir Edward Hales (1626‚Äì1684) took possession of the property after Lady Wootton‚Äôs death, to be followed by his son Sir Edward Hales (1645‚Äì1695). Rather than conserving the property, these new owners dismantled the buildings and carried used stones to build a new house at Hales Place. From then on until 1844, the desolation continued until it had engulfed the church, cloister, kitchen and refectory. Other parts of the site suffered degradation. From 1770 to 1844, the Alfred Beer & Company brewery operated within the abbey precincts. In 1804, a portion of the site was divided into lots and sold. The Great Court was used as a bowling green and skittle ground. Ethelbert's Tower, the remaining tower of the Norman abbey, was taken down in 1822.St Augustine's Abbey: information for teachers (pdf) at english-heritage.org.uk, accessed 19 November 2013 Robert Ewell, in his Guide to St. Augustine‚Äôs Monastery and Missionary College wrote that in the first half of the 19th century, the abbey \\"reached its lowest point of degradation\\". =Restoration to present= English Heritage entrance on Longport to St Augustine's Abbey ruins The condition of the abbey did not go unnoticed. In 1844 a rich young landowner, member of parliament, and generous churchman, Alexander James Beresford Hope, visited the ruins, found them deplorable, and bought them. Inspired by the missionary zeal of the Reverend Edward Coleridge, Hope and other donors gave additional money to restore and construct buildings for the establishment of a college to train young men as missionaries in the British colonies. They envisioned a dual purpose for the college: (a) to educate missionaries and (b) to excavate and preserve the abbey remains.Judith Roebuck, St Augustine's Abbey (English Heritage, 1997), 32.

On the death of his father the responsibility of supporting his mother and brother and sister fell on William Henry, or Harry Wills as he was always called. After leaving school he became a wood-engraver in the office of J. H. Vizetelly before becoming a journalist, contributing to periodicals such as the Penny Magazine and Saturday Magazine, John Ramsay McCulloch's A Dictionary, Geographical, Statistical, and Historical before being appointed sub-editor of The Monthly Magazine. His play The Law of the Land was produced at the Surrey Theatre in 1837. In the same year he first met Charles Dickens who was then the editor of Bentley's Miscellany.Wills on Spartacus Educational He was one of the original writers on Punch, and had some share in the composition of the draft prospectus. He contributed to the first number (17 July 1841) the satiric verse on Lord Cardigan called To the Blackballed of the United Service Club. He was for some time the regular drama critic, in which capacity he ridiculed Louis Antoine Jullien, the introducer of the promenade concerts at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and severely criticised the acting of Charles Kean. Among his other contributions in prose and verse were Punch's Natural History of Courtship (illustrated by Sir John Gilbert), Punch's Comic Mythology, Information for the People, and skits such as The Burst Boiler and the Broken Heart, and The Uncles of England, in praise of pawnbrokers. From 1842 to 1845 Wills was in Edinburgh where he was assistant editor of Chambers's Edinburgh Journal; in April 1846 he married Janet Chambers (1812‚Äì1892), the youngest sister of William and Robert Chambers, the Edinburgh publishers for whom he had been working. Association with Dickens Front cover of Household Words from 1851 On his return to London he wrote for the Punch Almanack in 1846, but his contributions were thenceforth infrequent. Also in 1846 Harry Wills began his lifelong association with Charles Dickens, when he became one of the sub-editors of The Daily News under Dickens' editorship. He continued in this role when John Forster replaced Dickens as editor. In 1850, on Forster's suggestion, Wills joined Dickens as secretary, sub-editor and proprietor of the new journal Household Words, Wills holding an interest of one-eighth share, which was increased to three-sixteenths in 1856. He was given the same position by Dickens when, ten years later, All the Year Round was incorporated with it, but by now Wills had a quarter share. His business capacity was invaluable to Dickens, and he was one of the most intimate friends of the novelist in later life. Despite this, Dickens accorded him no higher title than \\"subeditor\\". But as far as the reading public was concerned, Wills was as much a part of the two periodicals as was Dickens. Of Household Words (or at times of both Household Words and All the Year Round), he was variously referred to as \\"acting editor\\" (Wills' obituary in Athenaeum, 4 September 1880), \\"working editor\\" (John Hollingshead, My Lifetime, vol. I, p. 98), \\"assistant editor\\" (Lady Priestley, Story of a Lifetime, p. 95), \\"co- editor\\" (Athenaeum, 29 October 1892), and \\"editor\\" (W. J. Linton, Memories, p. 161). Dickens realised Wills's importance in making his periodicals a success. At various times he referred to Wills as his \\"fellow-workman\\", even as his \\"colleague\\" but also as his \\"factotum\\". However, Dickens was under few illusions regarding Wills's literary capabilities, on 15 May 1861 writing to Edward Bulwer Lytton, \\"Wills has no genius, and is, in literary matters, sufficiently commonplace to represent a very large proportion of our readers\\".William Henry Wills on Dickens Journals Online In 1850 Wills edited Sir Roger de Coverley by the Spectator, illustrated with engravings from designs by Frederick Taylor (Boston, Massachusetts, 1851; reissued in the Traveller's Library, 1856). At the end of 1851 Wills accompanied Dickens on his theatrical tour in connection with the Guild of Literature and Art, a philanthropic organisation founded by Dickens, Augustus Egg and Edward Bulwer Lytton, intended to provide welfare payments to struggling artists and writers who had fallen on hard times. Wills was honorary secretary of the Guild. Wills also published Old Leaves Gathered from Household Words (1860), dedicated to Dickens. In 1861 he issued Poets' Wit and Humour, illustrated by a hundred engravings from drawings by Charles Bennett and G. H. Thomas. Two pieces, A Lyric for Lovers and an Ode to Big Ben, the latter of which originally appeared in Punch, were from his own pen. The book was republished in 1882. Wills also republished under the title Light and Dark some of his contributions to Chambers's Edinburgh Journal. He was a fluent writer both in prose and verse, with a faint tinge of pedantry, which afforded Dickens much amusement. Douglas Jerrold was fond of exercising his wit at his expense, and Wills had enough humour to enjoy the situation. In 1855 Wills was asked to edit the Civil Service Gazette in addition to editing Household Words. Dickens refused him permission to hold these dual roles, but realising that Wills needed both positions because he was short of money suggested that he become part-time secretary to Baroness Burdett-Coutts who for many years had the advantage of Wills's judgement and experience in the conduct of her philanthropic undertakings. Wills was a highly trusted friend to Dickens, who entrusted Wills with the task of forwarding his letters to Ellen Ternan during Dickens's 1867‚Äì8 American reading tour. In 1868, while Dickens was still in America, Wills suffered a concussion from an accident while hunting when he was thrown from his horse, and was disabled from his duties as editor of All the Year Round. He never recovered, and retired from active work. The remaining years of his life Wills spent at his home, Sherrards at Welwyn in Hertfordshire. In Welwyn he acted as magistrate and Chairman of the Board of guardians. He died there on 1 September 1880, and was buried on 6 September. In 1883 his widow Janet Hills left Welwyn and moved to London.'Sherrards Secluded Mansion, Hidden History' on 'Our Welwyn Garden City' website Personal life Wills married Janet Chambers (1812‚Äì1892), the youngest sister of William and Robert Chambers, the Edinburgh publishers. There were no children of the marriage. Janet Wills was a woman of strong character, and a great favourite with Dickens, in whose correspondence her name frequently appears and who wrote the part of Nurse Esther in The Frozen Deep (1857) for her; she played the role \\"to much acclaim\\",A. Lohrli, 'Wife to Mr Wills', The Dickensian, 81 (1985), pg 24 in one of Dickens's amateur theatricals held at Tavistock House. She had an extensive knowledge of Scottish literature, and a large fund of anecdotes, and was for many years the centre of a wide literary and social circle. She died on 24 October 1892. At her death the sum of ¬£1,000 accrued to the newspaper press fund, in which Wills had interested himself after the failure of the Guild of Literature and Art.

Guide-A-Ride is the bus stop information display for MTA Regional Bus Operations of New York City. It is a rectangular box attached to the bus stop pole that displays a route map and a schedule. Originally designed for MTA New York City Transit operations, it is also used for routes of the MTA Bus Company that were formerly privately operated. The Guide-A-Ride canister is vandal-resistant and was designed for easy updating of the information displayed; though as a partly analog tool still requiring visits to the site ‚Äì requiring some planning during the massive system-wide service reductions the MTA was forced to implement at the end of December 2009.  History  MTA New York City Transit Guide-A-Ride kiosk and bus The New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA, NYCT, or TA) first announced a plan for \\"metal diagrammatic maps of bus routes on bus-stop stanchions\\" in 1964. These consisted of large metal signs (14 x 8 inches) with pictographic depictions of bus routes. Sometimes installed in the place of conventional bus stops, these signs were often considered confusing, as they attempted to consolidate multiple route maps onto a single sign and sometimes omitted routes. The prototype for Guide-A-Ride was developed in 1977, the key novelty in the display of times to the minute the bus was due at the individual stop. The first sign was installed along the Q44A (now ) route in Queens. Although skeptics doubted the ability of buses on New York City‚Äôs densely packed streets to show up anything like the times posted, on-time performance proved to be reliable. Regardless, customers were able to confirm whether they were at the right place at the right time. The actual displays began appearing at bus stops a few years later. The TA did not have a good reputation at the time, but Guide-A-Ride came to be viewed as one positive thing.  Current status  Even despite being superseded by BusTime, Guide-A-Ride is still found at the vast majority of MTA Bus and New York City Bus stops, providing bus schedules and maps. Similar transit aids can be seen in at bus stops in other cities including Boston, Atlanta, and Los Angeles.

It is the thirteenth Gabriel Allon series. It was released in July 2013. It reached the top of The New York Times bestseller list on July 25, 2013 and number 5 on the Wall Street Journals list. Plot Synopsis British political worker Madeline Hart is kidnapped in Corsica and former Israeli spy and assassin Gabriel Allon is soon invited by deputy director Graham Seymour of MI5 to find her as she is the mistress of British Prime Minister Jonathan Lancaster and was made by her kidnappers to film a testimonial implicating Lancaster in order to blackmail him. Gabriel goes to crime boss Don Orsati in Corsica who once agreed to have him killed at the behest of Swiss bankers (in The English Assassin) to ask for guidance and Orsati both lets Gabriel use the services of Christopher Keller, a former SAS officer believed dead (and Gabriel's erstwhile would-be assassin) and tells him that a man named Paul came to ask for a fast boat and points him to smuggler Marcel Lacroix in Marseilles. Gabriel and Keller capture Lacroix, who upon torture gives up local crime syndicate member Ren√© Brossard as his immediate contact and who says that when he learned it was a high-profile kidnapping he demanded more money and plans to meet with Brossard in Aix the next day to receive it. Keller kills Lacroix, and Gabriel and Keller keep watch on Lacroix's meeting site to follow Brossard to a villa in the Luberon. Keller monitors the villa for a couple days while Gabriel jets off to Paris to update Graham, but when they storm the house together one barely surviving criminal reports that Madeline left three days earlier. With the trail cold and the blackmailer's deadline near, Gabriel goes to Lancaster in London where the blackmail demand finally arrives: 10 million euros and, surprisingly, Gabriel to deliver the money. The money and the girl both check out, but the handoff is set up in such a way that Gabriel watches the car Madeline's in explode (as he watched his ex-wife and son die before the events of the series) rather than saves her and loses the money too. While Gabriel's in Israel to recuperate, Gabriel's former boss Ari Shamron wins Gabriel's agreement to head the Office (the Mossad) in exchange for the Office's support in figuring out who's responsible for Madeline's kidnapping and death. Back in London, Gabriel approaches journalist Samantha Cooke, who wrote an article about the unanswered questions about Madeline's death, and learns that Madeline's family vanished after her kidnapping and that Lancaster's chief of staff Jeremy Fallon also loved Madeline and is now leaving his position to run for Parliament to aim for Chancellor of the Exchequer after completing a final deal with Russian oil firm Volgatek. Gabriel and Keller visit Madeline's family's house only to observe another interloper there speaking Russian and demonstrating excellent tradecraft, whom Gabriel also saw tailing him earlier. Gabriel asks exiled Russian oil billionaire Viktor Orlov for help to prove Russian involvement. Orlov says Volgatek under his former deputy Gennady Lazarev is former KGB through and through and that he counselled the government not to take the deal but Fallon overruled him after taking five million euros from the firm, though Orlov won't reveal his source. Gabriel and Orlov prepare Gabriel's man Mikhail Abramov to serve as Orlov's heir apparent as Nicholas Avedon but to be apparently seduced by Lazarev into betraying Orlov during which conversation he finds that Volgatek's security chief Pavel Zhirov is their Paul. Mikhail as Avedon goes to Moscow with Gabriel's team shadowing him to negotiate his contract, and the gang abducts Zhirov who after torture confesses that he suborned Fallon on behalf of the Russian president, killed Madeline so as not to have Russian influence unraveled by an investigation, and demanded that Gabriel deliver the money to have a credible witness to the manner of her death. But Gabriel doesn't buy his story and with a further threat learns that Madeline was a Russian agent all along. Gabriel meets Madeline in St. Petersburg to learn that she was a lifelong sleeper agent activated into a political career to compromise Lancaster to win the oil deal, but she now wants out of Russia. Gabriel and the gang sneak her out of Russia by El Al. Lancaster's party wins the parliamentary election. Fallon becomes Chancellor and Graham's to head MI6. Gabriel delivers Madeline to Graham as a defector and they stage an apology for Lancaster's affair to get Fallon to overcommit, then take him down when he moves to withdraw some of the money in Zurich. Gabriel tries to recruit Keller to join either him or MI6 on his recommendation, but Keller's uninterested and Orsati believes the invitation impolitic. Gabriel's wife Chiara's pregnant with twins.

He is a specialist in cognitive neuroscience research in autism at the University of Montreal.  Biography  He studied medicine at the University Fran√ßois-Rabelais (Tours) and in 1981 a medical thesis entitled how the opposition neurosis / psychosis works, and defended in 1983, a state thesis in humanities and sciences, entitled Common constraints to the acquisition, theory and pathology of the deixis at the University Paris 5-Ren√© Descartes. He has lived in Quebec since 1990, where he is now a full professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the Universit√© de Montr√©al. He holds the Marcel and Rolande Gosselin Research Chair in Cognitive Neuroscience of Autism at the University of Montreal since 2008, and is a fellow of the Canadian Academy of Health Sciences since 2019. Since 1997, his research was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR). Several of his students now pursue an academic career, including Isabelle Souli√®res and Claudine Jacques. One of the particularities of his group is to regularly include autistic researchers, as Michelle Dawson, with whom he has been collaborating for more than fifteen years. He is married to Quebec researcher Sylvie Belleville and is the father of three children, including singer and songwriter Pierre Mottron.  Areas of research  He has authored over 150 scientific papers on cognitive neuroscience and autism. His early work is part of the general neuropsychology of pervasive developmental disorders and focuses on visual and auditory perception in savant and non- savant autism, studied through cognitive tasks and brain imaging. He is also interested in re-examining the role of intellectual disability, identifiable mutations and epilepsy in primary and syndromic autism, and the inclusion of autistic researchers in science. Along with the cognitive neuroscience research group on autism in Montreal, he develops the model of Enhanced Perceptual Functioning (2006), an influencing theory for interpreting cognitive and imaging data in autism. This model has been extended recently by that of veridical mapping (2013), on the strengths and talents of autistic, and the trigger-threshold-target model (2014), on the links between mutations involved in autism, microstructural and regional plasticity, and enhanced perceptual functioning. In the area of intervention, he and his collaborators V√©ronique Langlois and Val√©rie Courchesne develop an intervention program based on autistic forces. More recently, he and his collaborators are trying to re-construct de novo \\"prototypical\\" phenotype of this condition, in order to reason its uncontrolled increasing reported prevalence.  Position Statements  In a letter published by Le Monde in 2012, Laurent Mottron expresses that he left France for Canada as opposed to the psychoanalytic approach of autism: \\"psychoanalysis has nothing to say or to do with the autism. Psychoanalysis is a belief, a practice that must remain limited to a relationship between consenting adults. It must be taken out of the care, especially of children (and not just autism). I went to Canada to flee that twenty years ago‚Äô‚Äô. In this letter, he also expresses his opposition to the ABA method, which he considers \\"scientifically unjustified and ethically questionable\\". In Cerveau & Psycho, he writes: \\"Psychoanalysis has brought nothing to the understanding or the management of autism, neither in terms of practices nor in terms of knowledge\\".

He began his professional career at Porto, where he made 107 appearances for their reserves and won the 2015‚Äì16 Segunda Liga, but never represented the first team. After a season at Vit√≥ria de Set√∫bal in which he was a Ta√ßa da Liga runner-up, he joined Pogo≈Ñ Szczecin in 2018. Podstawski earned 85 caps for Portugal from under-16 to under-23 level. He represented the nation at the 2016 Olympic tournament. Club career =Porto= Born in Porto to a Polish father and a Portuguese mother, Podstawski joined FC Porto's youth system at the age of 13. On 20 February 2012, having not yet featured for the reserves, he was called up by first-team manager V√≠tor Pereira for the UEFA Europa League round of 16 second leg match at Manchester City, remaining unused in a 0‚Äì4 loss (1‚Äì6 aggregate) for the reigning champions. Podstawski finished his first season with 24 appearances ‚Äì 11 starts ‚Äì helping Porto B to the runner- up position, although the team was not eligible for promotion. On 2 April 2016 he scored his first goal for the B team in a 4‚Äì0 home win over Acad√©mico de Viseu FC, as they became the first reserves to win the second division. =Vit√≥ria Set√∫bal= On 12 June 2017, Podstawski signed a three-year contract for Vit√≥ria de Set√∫bal. He made his Primeira Liga debut on 6 August in a 1‚Äì1 home draw against Moreirense FC, and scored his first goal in the division on 30 October, consolation as a substitute in a 2‚Äì5 away loss to Portimonense SC. On 27 January 2018, Podstwaski was the only player to miss his penalty shootout attempt in the final of the Ta√ßa da Liga, lost to Sporting CP after a 1‚Äì1 draw in regulation time. He was also booked for handling the ball in his own box late into the game, which led to Bas Dost's equaliser. =Pogo≈Ñ Szczecin= On 27 August 2018, Podstawski joined Polish club Pogo≈Ñ Szczecin on a three-year deal. His maiden appearance in the Ekstraklasa occurred four days later, when he played the entire 1‚Äì1 draw away to G√≥rnik Zabrze, and his first goal came on 27 October in a 3‚Äì0 home win over Lech Pozna≈Ñ. International career At the 2014 UEFA European Under-19 Championship in Hungary, Podstawski captained Portugal to runners-up position behind Germany. He scored his only goal of 37 appearances for the team in the group stage, in a 2‚Äì1 win against Austria at Pancho Ar√©na. Podstawski also acted as captain to the under-20 side at the 2015 FIFA World Cup, playing four games out of five in an eventual quarter-final exit in New Zealand. He had previously turned down an approach from the Polish Football Association. Manager Rui Jorge included Podstawski in the under-23 team for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Brazil.

Previously it had been a foundation school controlled by Greenwich London Borough Council. The school continues to coordinate with Greenwich London Borough Council for admissions. Philosophy Virtually all maintained schools and academies follow the National Curriculum, and are inspected by Ofsted on how well they succeed in delivering a 'broad and balanced curriculum'. Schools endeavour to get all students to achieve the English Baccalaureate(EBACC) qualification- this must include core subjects a modern or ancient foreign language, and either History or Geography. Harris Academy Greenwich operates a three-year, Key Stage 3 where all the core National Curriculum subjects are taught. The school chooses to prioritise breadth of curriculum early on, so that students can widen their understanding and appreciation of the world, music, art and science, believing that through broad immersion, students will excel later in formal examinations. Later interactions with the world will be more fulfilling and successful, Curriculum Harris Academy Greenwich offers GCSEs and BTECs as programmes of study for pupils in Key Stage 4. In Year 10 students study a core of English, maths, science, history or geography and a foreign language yet are able to shape their own curriculum by choosing from a wide range of GCSE options. Students in the sixth form have the option of studying from a range of A Levels as well as further BTECs. Some sixth form courses are offered in conjunction with Harris Academy Falconwood.

The route starts at SR 60 and travels north to its terminus at SR 78, all located inside Morgan County. SR 607 was designated in 2011, after Monastery Road was transferred from township-maintenance to state-maintenance. The road was then repaved and realigned in 2012, and became signed on July 25, 2013. The route opened to the public on the next day. Route description All of SR 607 is located in central Morgan County, Ohio. The state route starts at the intersection of SR 60 near McConnelsville. SR 607 travels north for the majority of the length. SR 607 passes near an Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) county garage near the beginning of the road. Halfway through the route, SR 607 meets Township Road 696 in a T-intersection, where the route moves slightly westward. After that, there is an Ohio Army National Guard training site at Hawk Drive. The route keeps moving north until it ends at SR 78 at another T-intersection. The route goes through mostly forests and small hills. In 2012, ODOT calculated 1,975 vehicles traveling south of McGovern Lane. This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. No part of SR 607 is included within the National Highway System, a system of routes deemed most important for the economy, defense and mobility of the country. History Planning of Monastery Road (Township Road 209) improvements began in 2003. At that time, $3.8 million in state funding was set aside for the project, but the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) did not receive the money until 2005\\\\. By 2007, most of the earmarked money was spent on preliminary engineering and planning. Without the money, Morgan Township officials could not afford to upgrade the road, and ODOT was barred from spending money on local roads. In 2011, deputy director Steve Williams devised a new plan that made the township road a state route, and Morgan Township officials transferred the road to ODOT. Monastery Road was closed north of SR 60, and south of SR 78 in April 2012, for nine months. The road was realigned and resurfaced, and it cost around $1.5 million.

It was originally organized as a female auxiliary to the Ancient Order of United Workmen, but split off in 1910 to become its own independent group.Alvin J. Schmidt Fraternal Orders (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press), 1980, pp. 88‚Äì9  History  The Degree of Honor was established at the AOUW's first Supreme Lodge (national convention) at Cincinnati in February 1873. The Degree was open to the wives, widows, daughters, sisters, mothers, sons and brothers of members of the Order. A ritual was written by Dr. James Bunn, the founder of the AOUW, that provided for the creation of new lodges specifically for the degree. The Degree could also be applied by Subordinate Lodges of the Order, or in private to eligible individuals by duly qualified individuals.Sackett, Myron Ward, 1841- Early history of fraternal beneficiary societies in America Meadville, Pa., The Tribune publishing company 1914 p. 111 The first four or five lodges of the Degree itself were created in Pittsburgh and Allegheny, Pennsylvania in 1873 and 1874. In 1882 the Supreme Lodge of the AOUW granted permission for Grand Lodge Separate Beneficiary Jurisdictions to add a beneficiary feature to the Degree. The first Grand Lodge of the degree and the first to take advantage of the beneficiary feature was the Grand Lodge of Kansas, which was organized on May 20, 1890. A Superior Lodge of the degree to which the state Grand lodges were supposed to adhere to as the highest organ of the Degree was created in 1896. While this institution was subordinate to the Supreme lodge of the AOUW, there was never any financial connection between them, and the Degree of Honor became an independent organization in 1910Sackett p. 113  Membership  In 1896 the Degree reportedly had 40,000 members.Stevens, Albert Clark, 1854- The Cyclop√¶dia of Fraternities: A Compilation of Existing Authentic Information and the Results of Original Investigation as to More than Six Hundred Secret Societies in the United States (New York: Hamilton Printing and Publishing Company), 1899, p. 129 In 1923 it had grown to 80,015.Preuss, Arthur A Dictionary of Secret and other Societies St. Louis: B. Herder Book Co. 1924; republished Detroit: Gale Reference Company 1966; p. 108 According to the constitution that was operative in 1979, membership was open to any person of good moral character, who believed in a Supreme Being and was from sixteen to sixty-five years old. Applications for membership were voted on by the blackball system, with three black balls needed to reject a candidate. Non-insured social membership was also available.Schmidt p. 89  Organization  The organization has a three level structure, with local lodges electing delegates to state conventions, which in turn elect delegates to the annual convention. The national headquarters is in St. Paul, Minnesota.Schmidt p. 90 In 1923 the group had 800 lodges spread throughout the country. Four Grand Lodges (state organizations), joined between 1920 and 1922 ‚Äì Michigan, Iowa, Washington, and North Dakota. Independent groups remained in Massachusetts and Nebraska.Preuss p. 108 A junior department was created in 1926 and soon the society admitted men, though its national officers were all women in 1979,Schmidt p. 89 and still make up a majority of the board of directors.Board of Directors The group had 120,000 members in 1967 and 86,000 members in 390 local lodges in 1979.Schmidt p. 89 The Association bought the Schiffman Building in St. Paul, Minnesota for $150,000 in the early 1920s.Preuss p.108  Ritual  The group had an elaborate ritual based around its motto Talithi Cumi, Aramaic for \\"maid arise\\". The motto is taken from Mark 5:41, when Jesus speaks to a dead twelve- year-old girl. The ritual included prayers, a hymn (\\"Blest Be the Tie that Binds\\") and an altar and accented the group's three watchwords: constancy, honor, purity. The group also had its own burial service.Schmidt p. 89 The meetings were opened with a prayer and a Protestant Bible was kept on the altar in the meeting place, though the name of Jesus was reportedly never stated. The group claimed to be \\"Christian in its teachings with out being sectarian...[and its] fundamental principle is the Golden Rule.\\"Preuss p. 108  See also  *List of North American fraternal benefit orders  References   Further reading  *Degree of Honor Protective Association Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws (1977) *Degree of Honor Protective Association Rituals and rules of procedure (1951) *Yates, Keith L.

He commonly signed his paintings \\"J. W. Tristram\\". Biography  Born at Gillingham, Kent, England, Tristram was the first of eight children to his parents Samuel Herbert Tristram and Hannah Thompson. His father was a gunnery instructor in the British Army and accepted a posting in Australia which resulted in the family's emigration. John was 13 when they arrived in Sydney on 21 December 1883. Tristram's artistic abilities were utilised in seeking employment and by April 1885 he was accepted as a junior draftsman in the Architect‚Äôs Branch of the Department of Public Instruction (which became the Department of Education in 1915). He was to remain in this career until he retired in 1930. On 14 October 1891 he married Maude Face at Woollahra, in Sydney's eastern suburbs. In 1899 John, Maude and their two surviving children moved north of Sydney Harbour to Mosman which, from its earliest days, had strong connections with the creative arts in Sydney. He remained a resident of Mosman until his death in 1938. During his life Tristram was an active participant on the committees of three art societies: Art Society of New South Wales (which became the Royal Art Society of New South Wales when its Royal charter was granted in 1903), Australian Watercolour Institute and Australian Art Society. Aside from his painting, Tristram was known as a contributor of poetry to publications such as The Bulletin and The Lone Hand as well as being a talented musician. J. W. Tristram died in Sydney on 19 August 1938 and was survived by his wife Maude and children Ashwin, John, Norah and Molly.  Works  Tristram's watercolours were typically soft and delicate. He was best known for his coastal scenes and rural landscapes which were often nocturnes or low light depictions of dawn or dusk. His works can be found in the collections of many Australian public galleries including: National Gallery of Australia, Art Gallery of New South Wales, National Gallery of Victoria, Art Gallery of South Australia and Queensland Art Gallery.

Olsen and Will Scheffer. The series aired on HBO from November 24, 2013, to December 13, 2015, for three seasons each containing six episodes. The show has garnered positive reviews from critics. It stars Laurie Metcalf, Alex Borstein, Niecy Nash, and Mel Rodriguez. Premise The series is set in the Billy Barnes Extended Care Unit of the down-and-out Mount Palms Memorial Hospital in Long Beach, California. The show follows the lives of the staff involved in the ward's daily operation, specifically Dr. Jenna James (Laurie Metcalf), the ward's director of medicine; Dawn Forchette (Alex Borstein), the head nurse; Didi Ortley (Niecy Nash), a nurse; and Patsy De La Serda (Mel Rodriguez), the supervising nurse. Cast =Main cast= * Laurie Metcalf as Dr. Jenna James, director of medicine. She is uptight, self-centered and lacks social skills. She plays the piano, as revealed in the episode \\"Concert\\". She is usually oblivious to the offense she causes, believing people are impressed by her professionalism. In truth however, she is unintentionally psychologically abusive, especially towards head nurse Dawn. To the annoyance of her co- workers, Jenna often conducts various research studies using hospital resources. She is currently conducting a study on shrinking perineum in the elderly and one involving the use of mice. In collaboration with a hospice- care organization, Jenna introduces a hospice program into the ward, with the intent of using the extra profits to fund her research studies. Jenna gets greedy however when she begins classifying patients that are not dying of a terminal illness as part of the hospice program. This scheme is later exposed, putting Jenna, everyone else in the ward, and the hospital in jeopardy. * Alex Borstein as Dawn Forchette, the head nurse. Her husband has recently left her and took her car and dog. She often lets her various personal and romantic problems affect her work performance. She always works by the rules and has a difficult relationship with Jenna, who unintentionally bullies her. She has a complicated relationship with Patsy due to the fact that she slept with him, even though he may be gay. Dawn and Patsy's relationship improves and he becomes her boyfriend. She later discovers that she is pregnant, believing Patsy to be the father. After an ultrasound, however, Dawn discovers that she was never pregnant, and instead had a blighted ovum. This discovery leads to difficulties in her relationship with Patsy, and they eventually break up. She later hastily marries hospital security guard Dennis Beardman, seemingly just to spite Patsy. * Niecy Nash as Denise \\"Didi\\" Ortley, a return-to-work nurse. She is empathetic to the concerns of patients and their families, which often brings her into conflict with some of her colleagues who are more concerned with sticking to the rules. She appears to be happily married with six children, a daughter in college and a son in high school. Didi implies that her son has had issues. She is also currently taking care of her sister's children because of issues involving her sister. Didi also has a strained relationship with her half-sister Sherrie, who also is a nurse. After a hospice-care program is introduced into the ward, she is appointed as the hospice-nurse liaison. * Mel Rodriguez as Patsy De La Serda, the supervising nurse. He is very emotional and socially awkward in the workplace. He has stated that he was on a vegan diet because he needs to lose weight. Due to his ideas regarding how to run the ward, he often comes into conflict with Dr. James, who holds more traditional views about the running of the ward. He is having a complicated relationship with Dawn, as he has identified as homosexual even though he slept with her. His relationship with Dawn improves and she becomes his girlfriend. After Dawn's suspected pregnancy is diagnosed as a blighted ovum, he begins to experience difficulties in his relationship with Dawn, and they eventually break up. =Recurring cast= * Kurtis Bedford as Dennis Beardman, a hospital security guard that Dawn hastily marries after he shows a romantic interest in her. * Marsha Stephanie Blake as Yvette Ortley, Didi's sister-in-law, with whom Didi has a contentious relationship. * Grant Bowler as Dr. Ron Rudd, a charismatic physician from New Zealand. * K Callan as Susan Dayward, a patient recovering from knee-replacement surgery. * Kimberly Celemen as Kitty Doris, a medical resident whose name Jenna constantly forgets. * Brandon Fobbs as Antoine Robertson, an orderly who flirts with Dawn. * Ann Guilbert as Birdy Lamb, a patient who has been in the ward for some time due to a continuous flow of illnesses. * Mark Harelik as Dr. Paul Stickley, a medical colleague of Jenna's who is later appointed the hospital's director of medicine.

History  Union Depot in Columbia, South Carolina circa 1907-1912; where the train's South Carolina branch had its southern terminus from 1964 to 1968. The Southern Railway introduced the Carolina Special on January 22, 1911, between Cincinnati and Charleston, South Carolina via Asheville, North Carolina. The trip took 25 hours. The train's equipment included coaches, Pullman sleeping cars, an observation car and a dining car. Through-sleepers were later added to and from three different origins, Chicago, Detroit and Cleveland via the New York Central (NYC). NYC coaches linked at Cincinnati from Detroit and Cleveland. In mid-20th century the train was augmented to have an eastern North Carolina branch splitting off at Biltmore, North Carolina and heading east to Winston-Salem, Greensboro, Durham, Raleigh and Goldsboro.Southern Railway July 1952 timetable, Table J http://streamlinermemories.info/South/SOU52TT.pdf The Greensboro to Raleigh part of this branch is continued today in Amtrak's North Carolina-based Piedmont service. :\\"Despite its singular name, the train served both Carolinas, with a northern section going to Greensboro and Goldsboro, N.C., and the southern section serving Spartanburg, Columbia, and Charleston. The train was divided at Asheville. Over the years the consists varied (sleepers from Cincinnati to Columbia and Charleston were listed in 1917, Chicago- Columbia in 1925, Cincinnati-Spartanburg in 1930, and so forth), but typically they included a Chicago-Charleston car. Before the train was inaugurated, the Southern had run a Charleston-Cincinnati sleeper by way of Augusta and Atlanta (Georgia Railroad), but for the 57 years of its life, the Carolina Special offered a unique connection to the Cincinnati gateway.\\"Maiken, Peter T., \\"Night Trains: The Pullman System in the Golden Years of American Rail Travel\\", Lakme Press, Beloit, Wisconsin, December 1989, Library of Congress card number 88-83514, , pages 123-124. In pre-World War II years the train had additional sections that were northern destinations, aside from the default site of Cincinnati. A branch from Louisville joined with the train in Danville, and a Nashville branch running over the Tennessee Central's tracks joined the main route at Harriman. Continuing sleeper equipment was offered between Louisville and Asheville and between Nashville and Knoxville. This was a rare instance of a long distance train traveling east out of Nashville.'Official Guide of the Railways' August 1936, Southern Railway section, Condensed Tables and Table 32'Official Guide of the Railways' August 1936, Tennessee Central section By the 1950s, the Louisville part persisted as a connection, but not a through-train.

He served a single term from 1968 until 1972. Background Aulds was born near Farmerville in Union Parish in North Louisiana to Henry Leonard Aulds, Sr. (1897-1956), and the former Hazel Duty (1899-1972). According to the 1940 census, he had two brothers, Henry Leonard Aulds, Jr., and Charles Glen Aulds, and two sisters, Lillian (later Armstrong) and Nellie Sue (later Davis), who were eleven years apart in age. He served from 1943 to 1946 in the United States Navy in the Pacific Theater of Operations during World War II. Aulds graduated in 1950 from Centenary College in Shreveport and later taught real estate in night school there. In 1957, he organized the Aulds-Horne & White Investment Company in Shreveport and was a principal in the real estate firm, Woodland Development Corporation. He was a president of the North Louisiana Economic Development Corporation. Highly active in various civic and community organizations, he was affiliated with the Jaycees and then the Chamber of Commerce. Aulds was a member of the Kiwanis Club, the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, Masonic lodge, Shriners, the Forty and Eight veterans organization, and the American Legion. Political career Aulds was an elected member of the Caddo Parish Police Jury from 1960 to 1968. He was the jury vice president in 1963 and the president from 1964 to 1966. The police jury, the parish governing body, is now known as the Caddo Parish Commission.Veta Samuels, History of Caddo Parish Police Jury - Caddo parish Commission (government document) In 1966, Aulds was a candidate for the Louisiana State Board of Education for the seat representing the 4th congressional district. He vowed if elected to work to expand vocational education and higher education opportunities in the district. He lost to fellow Democrat and incumbent board member Robert H. Curry of Shreveport. That board was reorganized under the Louisiana Constitution of 1974 into the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education. Another candidate in the race, Cecil K. Carter, Jr.,Minden Press-Herald, August 15, 1966, p. 1 was later elected to a term in the Louisiana State Senate. In 1967, as a police juror and with extensive experience in real estate, he was a member of the site selection committee for the Northwest Louisiana School for the Mentally Retarded. The seven-member committee was headed by then State Representative and later U.S. Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Jr. Other members of the panel included Representative Frank Fulco, later Representative P. J. Mills, and Edgar Hull, dean of the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport.\\"Nearby sites for retarded school sought\\", Shreveport Times, August 21, 1967 The completed facility is now known as the Northwest Louisiana Developmental Center, located at 5401 Shed Road in Bossier City. Aulds left the police jury to run successfully for the state House of Representatives in the 1967-1968 election cycle, when Democrats swept the Caddo Parish offices. His colleagues included the Shreveport businessman Dayton Waller as well as the long-term members Algie D. Brown and Frank Fulco. Early in his first session of the legislature the freshman Aulds was named to replace veteran Representative Fulco on the House Budget Committee at the request of Governor John McKeithen. The matter sparked discord in the Caddo Parish delegation, but McKeithen tried to smooth over the hard feelings with self-deprecating humor in an engagement in Shreveport in mid-February 1969.Charlotte Burrows, \\"McKeithen leaves them 'em Laughing, Gasping\\", Shreveport Times, February 18, 1969 Personal life At forty-four, Aulds on December 31, 1969, married 20-year-old Katherin B.

Katherin Aulds was a florist for twenty-five years until she became a funeral home owner after completion of the course in mortuary science at Southern University at Shreveport. Their son is James Linard Aulds (born c. 1972). Aulds died in Shreveport at the age of fifty-eight. He was a member of the First United Methodist Church on Texas Avenue in downtown Shreveport.

As a compact system, rapid intensification continued, with Ken becoming a typhoon on the evening of September 17 and a major typhoon on September 18\\\\. The cyclone up to this point had a history of progressing slowly west-northwest, but Ken eventually stalled on September 20 and became a larger cyclone. As a mid-latitude trough to its north deepened, Ken took off to the northeast towards Okinawa.

By September 21, Ken began to move erratically due to a deepening trough that was centered north of Typhoon Ken before taking off in the general direction of Japan. Weakening ensued thereafter due to increased wind shear. By September 23, the JWC reported that winds had diminished below Category 2-equaivlent strength on the SSHWS while the JMA reported winds of . At this time, Ken was located around south of Tokyo.

History Founded 1 February 1910, the name A.V.V. Swift stands for Amsterdamse Voetbalvereniging Swift (English: Amsterdam Football Club Swift). They play their home matches at Sportpark Olympiaplein in Amsterdam, which was built in 1927 ahead of the 1928 Summer Olympics, to a capacity of 1,000 people. The Saturdays team of Swift were promoted to the Eerste Klasse, following their Tweede Klasse championship in the 2007‚Äì08 season. The following season saw Swift finishing in fourth place, thus qualifying for the playoffs for promotion to the Hoofdklasse which they won. They were relegated to the newly formed Topklasse in 2010‚Äì11, after their first season in the Hoofdklasse, finishing 13th, in second to last place on the table, resulting in relegation back to the Eerste Klasse. In 2008 the teams Sportpark Olympiaplein was redesigned by Ruud-Jan Kokke, which earned the stadium a Dutch Design Award that same year. The year the team was promoted to the Hoofdklasse in 2009, two new artificial grass fields were created at the Olympiaplein, as well as a new scoreboard put up. It is noteworthy to point out that AVV Swift's Sport park has very low sitting stands due to a historical law, which states that the view of the Monument Indi√´-Nederland from the Parnassusweg may never be obstructed, preventing the possibility of high seating in the park. In 2017, Swift knocked out the defending KNVB Cup winners Vitesse in the first round on penalties. References External links *A.V.V.

When the Americans forced African slaves to work on the plantations, banjo music followed them, and stayed primarily a form of African folk music, up to the 1800s. It was during this time that the banjo in all probability was first introduced to Ireland, when the Virginia Minstrels toured in England, Ireland and France in 1843, 1844 and 1845.

Unlike most other solo music pieces played by various instruments, banjo music does not only consist of a melody, but it also utilizes drone notes to make the music seem like it is being played by more than one instrument.

The drumhead, which is made from animal skin, is struck with a curved beater fashioned from cane. The frame may also be equipped with jingles. Like the na drum of Tibet, but unlike most frame drums, the dhyƒÅngro usually has a handle. The carving in the wooden handle of a dhyƒÅngro may be quite intricate; owing to Buddhist influence, the handles of some drums are fashioned into a kƒ´la. Ceremonial use A Nepali jhakri holds up a dhyƒÅngro with his left hand, and holds the beater in his right. In Nepal, a jhakri (shaman) plays the dhyƒÅngro during traditional shamanic ceremonies. The drum is occasionally used in Tibetan Buddhist celebrations, as in an orchestra performing Buddhist music.

He belonged to a Sayyid family. A Muslim and in one of many non-Sikhs in Ranjit Singh's secular government of the Sikh Empire. He was the eldest son of Hakƒ´m GhulƒÅm Mohy ud-Dƒ´n and had two brothers, N≈´r ud-Dƒ´n and ImƒÅm ud-Dƒ´n. Both had senior military posts in the empire. He was apprenticed as a physician, and was originally known by the title Hakƒ´m (physician). Later in life he adopted the title Fakir (beggar), as a mark of humility, that title appearing in British correspondence after 1826. His first contact with Ranjit Singh was as a physician. The Maharaja was impressed by his medical skill and proficiency in languages ‚Äì Arabic, Persian and English ‚Äì and granted him a jagir and a position at court. His first major assignment was to assist the Maharaja in the negotiations with the British which led to the Treaty of Amritsar, 1809. Between 1810 and 1838 there followed a great number of diplomatic assignments and tasks as an interpreter. The Maharaja had complete trust in him and rewarded him with honours and jagirs. Aziz ud-Din continued in the service of the Sikh Empire after the death of Ranjit Singh. In December 1839 he represented Maharaja Kharak Singh on a mission to the British Governor-General, Lord Auckland. In 1842, on behalf of Maharaja Sher Singh, he welcomed the new Governor-General, Lord Ellenborough, at Firozpur. He remained scrupulously aloof from the factional intrigues which had overtaken the Empire after Ranjit Singh's death. Saddened at the turn events had taken and by the death of two of his sons, Aziz ud-Din died in Lahore on 3 December 1845, aged 65.

The company was originally a person-to-person model, similar to Airbnb, that later developed into a marketplace for self-storage. The company now facilitates self-storage rentals between consumers and storage operators. The company was profiled as one of America's Most Promising Startups by Bloomberg Businessweek in 2011. SpareFoot lists storage business around a particular area to show available units and prices. Customers are able to view available units, real-time price quotes, view photos and make reservations. The company currently works with more than 10,000 storage facilities across the nation. In 2016, SpareFoot added valet-storage operators to its searchable database. This on-demand option, called Full-Service Storage, takes care of pick up, storage and return delivery on demand. As of 2017, SpareFoot's Full-Service Storage is available in almost 50 markets across the U.S. The company has also expanded its offerings by partnering with providers of other moving and storage services. Current moving-related offerings include moving supplies, moving truck rental, and full-service storage with moving labor. History SpareFoot was founded in 2008 by Chuck Gordon and Mario Feghali while both were attending UCLA. The concept was developed a year prior when Gordon was attending UCLA and left to spend a semester in Singapore. Gordon used space in Feghali's residence as well as space in girlfriend's garage. While away, Gordon came up with the concept which he pursued with Feghali. SpareFoot was originally formed as a person-to-person website with the concept of facilitating the rental of extra storage space in private residences to those looking for storage. Original funding came from family members and friends. The site failed to gain traction with a person-to-person model. The founders noticed that there were more storage companies signing up to sell space as opposed to homeowners. The site was re-branded (along with a name change from Homstie to SpareFoot) and began allowing customers to find, compare and review potential storage providers. Additional funding for SpareFoot came in 2009 when the company was accepted into an incubator program at Capital Factory in Austin, Texas. They were awarded $20,000 seed capital as well as mentoring from the program. During a second round of funding in 2010, the company received $2 Million in investment from Silverton Partners and Floodgate Fund. The following year they raised $1.5 million in capital, bringing their second round total to $3.5 million. In 2014, SpareFoot raised $10 million in a Series C round of venture funding from Insight Venture Partners. On March 11, 2015 the company announced a Series D round of $33 million from Insight Venture Partners as well as Monkfish Equity and Revolution LLC. In 2011, Chuck Gordon and Mario Feghali were named to the list of 30 Under 30 by Forbes. Company culture and philanthropy In 2013, SpareFoot was the winner of the Austin Startup Games, a competition that paired 15 startup companies against each other in games like ping pong, flip cup, and shuffleboard. SpareFoot received $30,000 for winning which they donated to the charity Kure It Cancer Research. The company ran a campaign in 2012 where they donated $3 in school supplies for users of their Facebook and Twitter pages who posted items they have kept since they were in grade school. SpareFoot also gave $100 vouchers for self- storage space to Washington D.C. residents affected by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. SpareFoot was listed as one of 7 Awesome Dog-Friendly Companies for National Dog Week by Career Bliss in 2012 for allowing dogs at their headquarters in Austin.

The island is owned by the United States Navy, and is a valuable asset to the Pacific fleet, allowing for ship- to-shore, air-to-ground, and ground-to-ground operational training. Shrikes typically occupy wooded canyons on the west side of the island, and sagebrush- dominant habitat on the eastern escarpment. Environmental status Since the 1880s, the San Clemente loggerhead shrike's habitat has been threatened by domestic animals, primarily goats, imported to San Clemente Island. By the early 1900s, the bird's population had declined to about 20, but stabilized. The Navy began removing introduced species in 1973. In 1977, the San Clemente loggerhead shrike was listed as endangered by the United States government, with an estimated population of 50. Between 1982 and 1999, the bird's population was measured between 14 and 33 birds, bottoming out in January 1998. The removal of feral goats and sheep was completed in 1993. In 1996, the Institute for Wildlife Studies conducted video research on the shrike for the Navy. In 1997, they were asked to come up with a strategy to raise the bird's numbers. A $3 million per year breeding program was launched in 1999 and new policies were instituted to help the shrike. For example, snipers must aim around bird nests when practicing. Thanks to the program, the bird's population reached 135 (captive and wild) specimens by 2004. In 2013, an estimated 70 breeding pairs were alive in the wild.

Its mission is to address the social problems of Boston's children and communities. Founded in 2003, BCC has performed all over the world in countries such as Japan, Mexico, Australia, Cambodia, Vietnam, Jordan, the Czech Republic, Germany and the United Kingdom. In addition, BCC has received critical acclaim for its music and hosts Boston's Martin Luther King Jr. annual celebration at New England Conservatory's Jordan Hall. This concert has featured guests such as Lou Gossett Jr, Patti Austin, Melinda Doolittle, Cindy Blackman Santana, Leslie Odom Jr., Dom Flemons and Roomful of Teeth and has been televised nationally. BCC's believes in the transformative power of music as a tool for social bridging. Its program focuses on providing children with a comprehensive music education and strong diverse youth leadership. Founding BCC was founded by Boston civic leader, Hubie Jones. In 2001, Jones experienced a performance by the nationally renowned Chicago Children's Choir, and returned to Boston determined to replicate the program, as there were no organizations in Boston that effectively combined a mission for artistic excellence with an agenda for social change. He gathered the support of civic leaders and, after a year of planning and pilot projects, the Boston Children's Chorus was launched in October 2003. Growth Since BCC's inception, the programs have grown rapidly. In 2003 under the leadership of Founding Artistic Director Darren Dailey, sixty-five (65) children were accepted into the initial pilot program, and now counts more than 500 singers who represent over 150 different zip codes from Greater Boston's urban and suburban neighborhoods. The program spans thirteen different choirs in five Boston locations: the South End, Allston-Brighton, South Boston and Dorchester. The 2012-2013 season represented 10 Years of Harmony for the organization, during which the chorus had its biggest sell-out concert at its winter concert at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross. In April 2013, the State of Massachusetts called on BCC to aid in the healing process of Boston in the wake of the tragic events at the Boston Marathon of 2013. The chorus joined with President Barack Obama, first responders and others as they sang to a national audience at the Interfaith Service in Boston's South End. In 2014, BCC performed at the Boston Marathon anniversary observances on April 15 in Boston. The 2013 season ended with a World Premiere performance of \\"A Boy Called King\\" at the Institute of Contemporary Art by composer Daniel Bernard Roumain, and a tours Southeast Asia. The 2018-2018 season was the 15th anniversary of the chorus and had all 13 choirs perform in their famous MLK concert at Symphony Hall, Boston. Leadership Darren Dailey was the Founding Artistic Director from 2003-2006. Darren is a graduate of Westminster Choir College in Princeton, NJ, where he earned a Bachelor's in Music Education(voice) and Appalachian State University, where he completed his Master's in Choral Directing. Anthony Trecek-King served BCC as Artistic Director from 2006-2015. The BCC Board of Directors appointed him as President and Artistic Director and the leader of the organization in 2015. He led the BCC as President and Artistic Director until his departure in 2020. Anthony is a graduate of University of Nebraska at Omaha, where he earned a Bachelor's in Cello Performance and Florida State University, where he completed his Master's in Orchestral Conducting. In 2015 he received his Doctorate in Choral Conducting from Boston University. Celeste Wilson joined BCC as Managing Director in October 2015. She works with Anthony to lead the organization and manage all fundraising, marketing and operations. Social justice BCC's mission is to harness the power of music to bring together Boston's diverse communities and to inspire social bridging. Through intensive choral training and high-profile performances, BCC singers learn discipline and develop leadership skills. In 2013, BCC won the Business Unusual National Challenge which is allowing the organization further develop its social curriculum for creative social integration. Musical program BCC's 500 singers comprise 13 choirs in five different locations. In addition to the 6-8 self-produced concerts in venues such as New England Conservatory's Jordan Hall, Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, and the Institute for Contemporary Art/Boston, BCC also tours internationally and has performed in Japan, Mexico, Australia, Cambodia, Vietnam, Germany, England and Jordan. BCC has also appeared on National Public Radio's From the Top. The organization and its singers, called Ambassadors of Harmony by the Boston Globe., have garnered critical acclaim. BCC is a 2011 recipient of the Margaret Hillis Award by Chorus America, recognizing BCC for artistic and organizational excellence and a commitment to outreach, education, and/or culturally diverse activities. The organization was chosen as a 2011, 2012, 2013 National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Award. Finalist by the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities.

It had its world premiere on October 26, 2013 at the Austin Film Festival and received a limited theatrical release in the United States on September 5, 2014. The movie stars Sophie Curtis, Kelly Reilly, Graham Phillips, Linus Roache, Sarah Sutherland and Stephanie March. Plot Beckett (Sophie Curtis) is a young teenager mourning the loss of her mother. She's moved to the Upper West Side of Manhattan with her father Miles (Linus Roache) and is set to begin school at Hamilton, an exclusive prep school. Beckett is so engrossed in her grief that she fails to notice that her school is a little stranger than most schools, as its students are prone to suicides and is full of extraordinarily beautiful female teachers. Things grow worse when the school nurse Pamela (Kelly Reilly) decides to move in with Beckett and Miles, especially since Pamela keeps instructing Beckett to remain a virgin. What Beckett doesn't know is that Pamela and the other school staff are all incarnations of Lamia, a former queen of Libya, and must kill and drink the blood of virgins to retain their immortal existence.

David Pitcairn, c.1800 Life Born on 1 May 1749 in Fife, he was eldest son of Major John Pitcairn, who was killed at the battle of Bunker's Hill; Robert Pitcairn (1747?‚Äì1770?) was his brother. He was sent to Edinburgh High School, the university of Glasgow, and then to the University of Edinburgh. He went on in 1773 to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he graduated M.B. in 1779 and M.D. in 1784. In 1779 Pitcairn began practice in London, and was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians on 15 Aug. 1785. He was five times censor, and in 1786 was also Gulstonian lecturer and Harveian orator. On the resignation of his uncle William Pitcairn, he was, on 10 February 1780, elected physician to St Bartholomew's Hospital, and held the post till 1793, when he resigned. He attained a large private practice. John Latham mentioned, in his treatise on gout and rheumatism, that David Pitcairn was the first to discover that valvular disease of the heart was a frequent result of rheumatic fever, and that he made his discovery known in his teaching at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. On 11 April 1782 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Last years and death Pitcairn had frequent attacks of quinsy, and failing health, accompanied by h√¶moptysis, in 1798, forced him to give up work and spend eighteen months in Portugal. He returned to England and continued to practise, but on 13 April 1809 had an attack of sore throat, followed by acute inflammation of the larynx, with consequent ≈ìdema of the glottis, of which he died on 17 April 1809, at Craig's Court, Charing Cross. Matthew Baillie, a close friend for 30 years, attended him, and described his case, with the similar one of John Macnamara Hayes, who died of the same disease three months later. Pitcairn's body was examined by Benjamin Collins Brodie the elder, in the presence of Baillie, Everard Home, and William Charles Wells. Pitcairn was buried in the family vault in the church of St Bartholomew the Less, without the walls of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London. A tablet to his memory was erected in the church of Hadham Magna, Hertfordshire. Family Pitcairn married Elizabeth, daughter of William Almack.

It was meant to be more understandable than Paxos by means of separation of logic, but it is also formally proven safe and offers some additional features. Raft offers a generic way to distribute a state machine across a cluster of computing systems, ensuring that each node in the cluster agrees upon the same series of state transitions. It has a number of open- source reference implementations, with full-specification implementations in Go, C++, Java, and Scala. It is named after Reliable, Replicated, Redundant, And Fault-Tolerant.Why the \\"Raft\\" name? Raft is not a Byzantine fault tolerant algorithm: the nodes trust the elected leader.  Basics  Raft achieves consensus via an elected leader. A server in a raft cluster is either a leader or a follower, and can be a candidate in the precise case of an election (leader unavailable). The leader is responsible for log replication to the followers. It regularly informs the followers of its existence by sending a heartbeat message. Each follower has a timeout (typically between 150 and 300 ms) in which it expects the heartbeat from the leader. The timeout is reset on receiving the heartbeat. If no heartbeat is received the follower changes its status to candidate and starts a leader election. = Approach of the consensus problem in Raft = Raft implements consensus by a leader approach. The cluster has one and only one elected leader which is fully responsible for managing log replication on the other servers of the cluster. It means that the leader can decide on new entries' placement and establishment of data flow between it and the other servers without consulting other servers. A leader leads until it fails or disconnects, in which case a new leader is elected. The consensus problem is decomposed in Raft into two relatively independent subproblems listed down below.  Leader election  When the existing leader fails or when the algorithm initializes, a new leader needs to be elected. In this case, a new term starts in the cluster. A term is an arbitrary period of time on the server for which a new leader needs to be elected. Each term starts with a leader election. If the election is completed successfully (i.e. a single leader is elected) the term keeps going with normal operations orchestrated by the new leader. If the election is a failure, a new term starts, with a new election. A leader election is started by a candidate server. A server becomes a candidate if it receives no communication by the leader over a period called the election timeout, so it assumes there is no acting leader anymore. It starts the election by increasing the term counter, voting for itself as new leader, and sending a message to all other servers requesting their vote. A server will vote only once per term, on a first-come-first-served basis. If a candidate receives a message from another server with a term number at least as large as the candidate's current term, then the candidate's election is defeated and the candidate changes into a follower and recognizes the leader as legitimate. If a candidate receives a majority of votes, then it becomes the new leader. If neither happens, e.g., because of a split vote, then a new term starts, and a new election begins. Raft uses a randomized election timeout to ensure that split vote problems are resolved quickly. This should reduce the chance of a split vote because servers won't become candidates at the same time: a single server will time out, win the election, then become leader and send heartbeat messages to other servers before any of the followers can become candidates.  Log replication  The leader is responsible for the log replication. It accepts client requests. Each client request consists of a command to be executed by the replicated state machines in the cluster. After being appended to the leader's log as a new entry, each of the requests is forwarded to the followers as AppendEntries messages. In case of unavailability of the followers, the leader retries AppendEntries messages indefinitely, until the log entry is eventually stored by all of the followers. Once the leader receives confirmation from the majority of its followers that the entry has been replicated, the leader applies the entry to its local state machine, and the request is considered committed. This event also commits all previous entries in the leader's log. Once a follower learns that a log entry is committed, it applies the entry to its local state machine. This ensures consistency of the logs between all the servers through the cluster, ensuring that the safety rule of Log Matching is respected. In the case of leader crash, the logs can be left inconsistent, with some logs from the old leader not being fully replicated through the cluster. The new leader will then handle inconsistency by forcing the followers to duplicate its own log. To do so, for each of its followers, the leader will compare its log with the log from the follower, find the last entry where they agree, then delete all the entries coming after this critical entry in the follower log and replace it with its own log entries. This mechanism will restore log consistency in a cluster subject to failures. = Safety =  Safety rules in Raft  Raft guarantees each of these safety properties : * Election safety: at most one leader can be elected in a given term. * Leader append-only: a leader can only append new entries to its logs (it can neither overwrite nor delete entries). * Log matching: if two logs contain an entry with the same index and term, then the logs are identical in all entries up through the given index. * Leader completeness: if a log entry is committed in a given term then it will be present in the logs of the leaders since this term * State machine safety: if a server has applied a particular log entry to its state machine, then no other server may apply a different command for the same log. The first four rules are guaranteed by the details of the algorithm described in the previous section. The State Machine Safety is guaranteed by a restriction on the election process.  State machine safety  This rule is ensured by a simple restriction: a candidate can't win an election unless its log contains all committed entries. In order to be elected, a candidate has to contact a majority of the cluster, and given the rules for logs to be committed, it means that every committed entry is going to be present on at least one of the servers the candidates contact. Raft determines which of two logs (carried by two distinct servers) is more up-to-date by comparing the index term of the last entries in the logs. If the logs have a last entry with different terms, then the log with the later term is more up-to-date. If the logs end with the same term, then whichever log is longer is more up-to-date. In Raft, the request from a candidate to a voter includes information about the candidate's log. If its own log is more up-to-date than the candidate's log, the voter denies its vote to the candidate. This implementation ensures the State Machine Safety rule.  Follower crashes  If a follower crashes, AppendEntries and vote requests sent by other servers will fail. Such failures are handled by the servers trying indefinitely to reach the downed follower. If the follower restarts, the pending requests will complete. If the request has already been taken into account before the failure, the restarted follower will just ignore it.  Timing and availability  Timing is critical in Raft to elect and maintain a steady leader over time, in order to have a perfect availability of the cluster. Stability is ensured by respecting the timing requirement of the algorithm : > broadcastTime << electionTimeout << MTBF * broadcastTime is the average time it takes a server to send request to every server in the cluster and receive responses. It is relative to the infrastructure used. * MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) is the average time between failures for a server. It is also relative to the infrastructure. * electionTimeout is the same as described in the Leader Election section. It is something the programmer must choose. Typical number for these values can be 0.5ms to 20ms for broadcastTime, which implies that the programmer sets the electionTimeout somewhere between 10ms and 500ms. It can take several weeks or months between single server failures, which means the values are all right for a stable cluster to work.

The film stars Zoe Kazan, Jake Johnson, Ron Livingston, Sterling Beaumon and John Carroll Lynch.  Plot  Laurel and Audrey (Zoe Kazan) are identical twins. Although they look the same on the outside, their personalities are very different, with Audrey being popular, sophisticated and successful while Laurel is shy, childlike, awkward and still living at home with their widowed father (John Carroll Lynch) and his new fianc√©e, and helping him with his work of reproducing famous paintings. At their birthday party, Audrey decides to take Laurel to live with her, and in preparation to the move, Laurel gets a new haircut that makes her look like her sister. Returning from the hair salon, they get in a severe car crash together, and when Laurel wakes up in the hospital, she is informed that her sister has died. Suffering from post-traumatic amnesia, Laurel doesn't remember who she is at first and due to her new haircut and the fact that the deceased's body was burned beyond recognition following the accident, everybody assumes she's actually Audrey. The morning of her sister's funeral, Laurel remembers her actual identity but decides to keep everyone thinking that was Laurel the one who died in the crash, especially when she realizes nobody at her funeral has anything to say about her. Laurel flies back to the city where Audrey used to live and work as a real estate agent. There, she meets her late sister's tenant, Basel (Jake Johnson), who is confused about Audrey's sudden change of personality, because Audrey was never nice to him before. While posing as her sister, she learns that Audrey had a married boyfriend, Charles (Ron Livingston), but broke up with him before the accident. Laurel continues to spend more time with Basel and Audrey's best friend and coworker Claudia (Frankie Shaw), who grows suspicious due to Audrey's change of behavior and sudden lack of skills at work. Eventually, Laurel and Basel fall in love and begin a relationship. When she finally feels that she is adapting to her new life, Laurel accidentally introduces Charles as her ex-boyfriend to her boss Edith (Sabrina Lloyd), not knowing that Charles is actually Edith's husband, and getting immediately fired as a result. Shortly after this, Basel proposes to Laurel saying that he has loved her since they first met, which to Laurel means he loves her as Audrey, not as herself. Unable to continue deceiving everyone, Laurel reveals the truth to Basel, but he is devastated by her deception and breaks up with her. Laurel returns to her father's home, who's also shocked to hear what Laurel did, while at the same time being relieved that the daughter he felt closer to is still alive. They have another funeral for Audrey, and after talking to Claudia and receiving praises and encouragements from her father after showing him her original paintings, Laurel eventually comes to terms with her own insecurities about being the less worthy sister. She returns to the city as herself and looks for Basel who's still upset but also still in love with her. In the end he forgives her, and they share a kiss and start making plans for the future.

He published two literary magazines, the Oxford and Cambridge Review and the Eye Witness, which carried works by \\"up and coming\\" literary authors, and also a third, Rhythm. In October 1912 he was wanted for embezzlement and bigamy, and fled the country. He was brought back, tried, and imprisoned for bigamy. His publishing company was liquidated. Granville was dining at a London dinner party when a London magistrate (who said that he never forgot a face) asked him for a private word. The magistrate said that they were fellow guests that night, but next morning he would inform the authorities that some years earlier Granville had earlier appeared before him for bigamy, was given bail, and absconded. Granville then fled to Algiers with his secretary and a large cheque from the Oxford and Cambridge Review. He was extradited for embezzlement, but subsequently charged only with bigamy, and was imprisoned although his wives were willing to give him testimonials as a good husband. The story was heard by Arthur Ransome from Ashley Dukes at the Garrick Club forty years later.Chambers p 63Ransome p 150Kirkpatrick p 7  Stephen Swift Ltd  Granville published literary and general books and magazines as Stephen Swift Ltd, from offices in St John Street, London; and may have used Stephen Swift as an alias.

Belloc also wrote a series of booklets on British battles, starting with Blenheim, Malplaquet, Waterloo and Tourcoing. Other books Granville published included books by and about Henri Bergson, Katherine Mansfields short story In a German Pension and various novels, books of poems and belles lettres. Arthur Ransome had left his previous publisher Martin Secker for Granville, who promised him better returns and a guaranteed and steady income.Ransome p146Brogan p77, 78 He recalled that Granville ‚Äúhad a magnificent way with him‚Äù.Chambers p 60 He transferred his works of the last five years, including Bohemia in London and literary works on Edgar Allan Poe and Oscar Wilde. The work on Wilde went into eight editions; it had attracted public notoriety because of an (unsuccessful) libel case by Lord Alfred Douglas, who was by now a ‚Äúvexatious‚Äù ‚Äúsemi- professional‚Äù (and indigent) litigant.Brogan p 80, 86 Ransome had translated Une Nuit au Luxembourg by the French Symbolist poet and novelist Remy de Gourmont into English for Granville as A Night in the Luxembourg. His works held by Granville represented all his work worth republishing. When he heard on 8 October (from Cecil Chesterton) that Granville had fled and his company had gone into liquidation, Ransome went and sat in Granville's chaotic office day after day to establish his interest as a leading creditor of the bankrupt firm. He sacrificed control of some earlier works, but kept the most valuable, Poe and Wilde, which were subsequently taken over by Methuen; and a collection of essays, Portraits and Speculations which went to Macmillan.Ransome p 149-150Brogan p 83Chambers p 63  References  *The Autobiography of Arthur Ransome by Arthur Ransome pp 145‚Äì150 (1976, Jonathan Cape, London) *The Life of Arthur Ransome by Hugh Brogan pp 77‚Äì83 (1984, Jonathan Cape, London) *The Last Englishman by Roland Chambers pp 59‚Äì63 (2009, faber and faber, London) *The Life of Katherine Mansfield by Anthony Alpers p151 (1980, Oxford University Press & Viking Press, New York) *  External links  *Works published by Stephen Swift, from In a German Pension *Title page of Stephen Swift edition of In a German Pension Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown Category:British book publishers (people) Category:20th-century English businesspeople ","title":"Charles Granville"},{"id":"40226763","text":"Arnold van der Vin was an Indonesian footballer.

Ghana has no restrictions on the use of number plates in the various regions, for example, a vehicle registered in the Ashanti Region can be used in the Brong-Ahafo Region. A vehicle can be re- registered or a new license plate acquired under the following conditions: * Vehicle bears a government registration plate and is being transferred to a civilian. * Vehicle bears a diplomatic plate and is being transferred to a non-diplomat. * Vehicle has a personalized plate and is being transferred to a new owner. A Peugeot 607 which was registered in the Greater Accra Region in 2009 The image was captured at Santa Maria, a suburb of GA Central Municipal Assembly of the Greater Accra Region Format The current Ghanaian number plate format has been in use since January 2009. Ghanaian vehicle license plates consist of a two-letter region code, followed by a four-digit numeric and a two-digit year code. The two-letter region code indicates the region in which the vehicle was registered; the four-digit numeric code is the unique item one can find on a Ghanaian number plate‚Äîthe digits show the number of vehicles registered in the region in which the vehicle was registered. The year code also tells one the exact year in which the vehicle was registered. For instance, the 2567th vehicle registered in the Ashanti Region in the year 2012, will bear the number plate AS 2567-12. The four-digit numeric code is unique, to distinguish between vehicles registered in the same region and year. The numbering starts from 1 and increases to 9999. For example, the first vehicle registered in the Central Region in the year 2009 will bear the number plate CR 1 -09 and the last vehicle in that year will bear the number plate CR 9999 -09. The two-letter region code is the combination of the first letter from the name of the region, and the letter 'R' which denotes region; however, four of the ten regions in Ghana: Ashanti, Brong-Ahafo, Upper East and Upper West do not have the letter 'R' as part of their region code. Below are the codes for the various regions in Ghana AS, AE, AW = Ashanti Region * BA = Brong-Ahafo Region* CR = Central Region ER = Eastern Region GR, GC, GE, GL, GM, GN, GT, GS, GW, GY, GX = Greater Accra Region NR = Northern Region UE = Upper East Region* UW = Upper West Region* VR = Volta Region WR = Western Region NB Regions with asterisks are those that do not have the letter R as part of their region code. Starting in 2020, additional abbreviations will be added. \\"The Ghana Armed Forces, Ghana Police, Fire Service and the Ghana Prisons Service have special codes on their number plates - GA, GP, FS and PS, respectively. For example, GP 5 would be a number plate for the Ghana Police. =Supplementary Plates= In the Ashanti and Greater Accra Regions, many vehicles are registered every year so, the Driver Vehicle License Authority (DVLA, the body responsible for vehicle registration in Ghana) provides supplementary plates for these two regions - AW, AS and AE are the supplementary for Ashanti Region; GT, GN, GS, GC, GW, GE, GX, GL, GM, GY are the supplementary for the Greater Accra Region FZB is issued as a special identification by Ghana Free zone board.  Types of Vehicle Registration Plates  There are several types of vehicle registration plates in Ghana: black print on a white background (for private vehicles), black print on a yellow background (for commercial vehicles), green print on a white background (for agricultural equipment such as tractor) white print on a red background (for diplomats), and white print on a blue background (for motorcycles only). =Vehicles with Special Mark= The DVLA refers to vehicles with personalised or customised plates as Vehicles with Special Mark.

It was originally released as a free digital download on Amazon in the United States and the United Kingdom for a limited time starting on August 13, 2013. On August 20, the song was made available on the iTunes Store. It was also made available to those who had pre-ordered the album from Nine Inch Nails' official online store, together with \\"Came Back Haunted\\" in a zip file labeled \\"Hesitation Marks Singles\\". The song was played live in concert for the first time about two weeks before the official studio track was released. Composition The song features the use of a Swarmatron, an analogue synthesizer which was most notably used by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for the soundtrack of the 2010 film The Social Network. Reznor's singing on the track uses both the minor and the acoustic scales. Critical reception When referring to the song, Marc Hogan of Spin magazine stated that \\"the concept of 'a copy of a copy' is somewhat quaint in a time when digital files can be copied limitlessly without any discernible drop in quality\\". He also described the drum machine in the song as \\"crisp\\" and the synths as \\"jittery\\", while noting the \\"overlapping vocals and smeared tendrils of fuzzy noise\\". Andrew Trendell of Gigwise described the song as \\"an epic, sprawling and typically NIN number that features a gradual and repetitive trancey build-up with a dark intensity before an almighty rock crescendo\\". He also interpreted the song's lyrical theme as \\"a struggle for identity\\". Triple M Network inferred from the song that Reznor \\"stays true to his roots while trying something different\\". Similarly, Forrest Wickman of Slate magazine stated that \\"the song is an update on an old NIN sound\\", while speculating on the possible muse on the postmodern condition or Fight Club on the lyrics. He also praised the musical beats by Atticus Ross and Alan Moulder and the use of Swarmatron. This Is Fake DIY also referred the song \\"as a punchy electronic piece, suitably harsh on the senses\\". Fact magazine described the song as \\"an urgently paced but slow- building chiller constructed from ice-cold techno arpeggiations and droning synths\\", while Katie Hasty of Hitfix remarked positively on the track's mellow vocals. She also praised the effect of looping sampler and itchy beat, contrasting it with the features of the previous single, \\"Came Back Haunted\\". In popular culture \\"Copy of a\\" was featured in the soundtrack of the video game FIFA 14. A 2014 parody song by comedian Freddy Scott about Reznor's musical style, \\"This Is a Trent Reznor Song\\", was performed to the tune of \\"Copy of a\\". Spin referred to the parody as \\"reductive, unfair, and more than a little silly\\" but also called it \\"uncomfortably dead-on\\" and said that \\"the way the song deploys various Reznor moves ('random percussion', 'weird guitar', 'creepy piano') is priceless\\".

Life The son of Robert Pitt, he was born at Blandford Forum in Dorset; Christopher Pitt the poet was his nephew. He matriculated at Wadham College, Oxford, on 2 April 1669, and was elected to a scholarship there in 1670. He graduated B.A. in 1672, was elected a Fellow of his college in 1674 and Dean in 1677, graduated M.A. in 1675, M.B. in 1678, and M.D. on 16 February 1682. He taught anatomy at Oxford, and was elected Fellow of the Royal Society on 20 December 1682. In 1684 Pitt settled in London, and was admitted a candidate or member of the Royal College of Physicians on 22 December. He was created a fellow by the new charter of James II, and admitted on 12 April 1687. He was a censor in 1687 and 1702. Pitt lived in 1685 in the parish of St. Peter-le-Poer, in the city of London; in 1703, and till his death, in Hatton Garden. On the death of Francis Bernard he was, on 23 February 1698, elected physician to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and held the post until 1707. Pitt died on 13 January 1713. Works Pitt took part in the controversy which followed the establishment of a dispensary by the College of Physicians in 1696. He published in 1702 The Craft and Frauds of Physick exposed, dedicated to Sir William Prichard, president, and to the governors of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and written to show the low cost of the useful drugs, the worthlessness of some expensive ones, and the dangers of taking too much physic. Sarsaparilla, which for more than a hundred years later was a highly esteemed drug, was detected by Pitt to be inert; and he condemned the use of bezoar, of powder of vipers, of mummy, and of many other once famous therapeutic agents, on the ground that accurate tests proved them of no effect. A second and third edition appeared in 1703. In 1704 he published The Antidote, or the Preservative of Life and Health and the Restorative of Physick to its Sincerity and Perfection, and in 1705 The Frauds and Villainies of the Common Practice of Physic demonstrated to be curable by the College Dispensary. He was attacked by Joseph Browne in 1704 in a book The Modern Practice of Physick vindicated from the groundless imputations of Dr. Pitt. Pitt also published a paper in the Philosophical Transactions for 1691 on the weight of the land tortoise. The observations, work with Sir George Ent, compared the weight of the reptile before and after hibernation for a series of years. Family Pitt married Martha, daughter of John Nourse of Wood Eaton, Oxfordshire, in 1686.

He entered Caius College, Cambridge as a sizar, on 23 March 1610, and graduated M.B. in 1617, and M.D. in 1625. He became a licentiate of the College of Physicians of London on 22 December 1621, and was elected a fellow in 1626. Prujean practised in Lincolnshire till 1638, and then settled in London. In 1639 he was elected a censor at the College of Physicians, and again from 1642 to 1647. He was registrar from 1641 to 1647, and president from 1650 to 1654, in the last of which years he was chosen, on the recommendation of William Harvey who declined the post. He was treasurer from 1655 to 1663. Prujean had a large practice, and was knighted by Charles II on 1 April 1661. When Queen Catherine of Braganza had typhus fever in October 1663, he attended her, and her recovery was attributed to a cordial he prescribed. John Evelyn described his laboratory and collection of pictures, and mentions that he played on the \\"polythore\\", a musical instrument combining features of the harp, lute and theorbo. Prujean died on 23 June 1666, and was buried at Hornchurch in Essex. Baldwin Hamey the younger composed a Latin epitaph. Prujean lived near the Old Bailey, and the place was named Prujean Square after him. Samuel Pepys called him a man of great judgment but who sadly left no written works behind him. Family Prujean was married twice: first to Margaret Leggatt (died 1661), and secondly, on 13 February 1664, to Margaret, the widow of Sir Thomas Fleming, and daughter of Edward Gorges, 1st Baron Gorges of Dundalk. Samuel Pepys records that his second wife brought him a great fortune. By his first wife he had an only son, Thomas Prujean, who graduated M.D. at Cambridge in 1649.

It refers to a yajna (sacrifice) organized by Daksha, where his daughter Sati immolated herself. The wrath of god Shiva, Sati's husband, thereafter destroyed the sacrifice. The tale is also called Daksha-Yajna-Nasha (\\"destruction of Daksha's sacrifice). The story forms the basis of the establishment of the Shakti Peethas, temples of the Hindu Divine Mother. It is also becomes a prelude to the story of Parvati, Sati's reincarnation who later marries Shiva. The mythology is mainly told in the Vayu Purana. It is also mentioned in the Kasi Kanda of the Skanda Purana, the Kurma Purana, Harivamsa Purana and Padma Purana. Linga Purana, Shiva Purana, and Matsya Purana also detail the incident. Background =Sati-Shiva marriage= Daksha was one of the Prajapati, son of Brahma, and among his foremost creations. The name Daksha means \\"skilled one\\". Daksha had two wives: Prasoothi and Panchajani (Virini). Sati (also known as ‚Äò‚ÄòUma‚Äô‚Äô) was his youngest daughter; born from Virini (the daughter of the Prajapati Manu), she was the pet child of Daksha and he always carried her with him. Sati (meaning truth) is also called Dakshayani as she followed Daksha‚Äôs path; this is derived from the Sanskrit words daksha and ayana (walk or path). Sati, the youngest daughter of Daksha, was deeply in love with the god Shiva and wished to become his wife. Her worship and devotion of Shiva strengthened her immense desire to become his wife. However, Daksha did not like his daughter‚Äôs yearning for Shiva, mainly because he was a Prajapati and the son of the god Brahma; his daughter Sati was a royal princess. They were wealthy nobility and their imperial royal lifestyle was entirely different from that of Shiva. As an emperor, Daksha wanted to increase his influence and power by making marriage alliances with powerful empires and influential sages and gods. Shiva, on the other hand, led a very modest life. He lived among the downtrodden, wore a tiger skin, smeared ashes on his body, had thick locks of matted hair, and was with full of purity. His abode was Mount Kailash in the Himalayas. He embraced all kinds of living beings and did not make any distinction between good souls and bad souls. The Bhutaganas, his followers, consisted of all kinds of ghosts, demons, ghouls and goblins. He wandered through garden and graveyard alike. As a consequence, Daksha had aversion towards Shiva being his daughter‚Äôs companion. However unlike Daksha, Sati loved Shiva as she had the revelation that Shiva was the Supreme God. Sati won Shiva as her husband by undergoing severe austerities (tapas). Despite Daksha's disappointment, Sati married Shiva. =Brahma's yajna= Daksha criticizing Rudra for insulting him in the Satrayaga Once Brahma conducted a huge (sacrifice), where all the Prajapatis, gods and kings of the world were invited. Shiva and Sati were also called on to participate in the yajna. All of them came for the yajna and sat in the ceremonial place. Daksha came last. When he arrived, everyone in the yajna, with the exception of Brahma, Shiva and Sati, stood up showing reverence for him. Brahma being Daksha's father and Shiva being Daksha's son-in-law were considered superior in stature to Daksha. Daksha misunderstood Shiva‚Äôs gesture and considered Shiva's gesture as an insult. Daksha vowed to take revenge on the insult in the same manner. Ceremony Daksha‚Äôs grudge towards Shiva grew after Brahma's yajna. With the prime motive of insulting Shiva, Daksha initiated a great yajna, similar to that of Brahma. The yajna was to be presided over by the sage Bhrigu. He invited all the gods, Prajapatis and kings to attend the yajna and intentionally avoided inviting Shiva and Sati. =Dadhichi-Daksha argument= The Kurma Purana discusses the dialogues between the sage Dadhichi and Daksha. After the sacrifice and hymns were offered to the twelve Aditya gods; Dadhichi noticed that there was no sacrificial portion (Havvis) allotted to Shiva and his wife, and no Vedic hymns were used in the yajna addressing Shiva which were part of Vedic hymns. He warned Daksha that he should not alter the Holy Vedas for personal reasons; the priests and sages supported this. Daksha replied to Dadhichi that he would not do so and insulted Shiva. Dadhichi left the yajna because of this argument. =Sati's death= Sati argues with Daksha. Sati came to know about the grand yajna organized by her father and asked Shiva to attend the yajna. Shiva refused her request, saying that it was inappropriate to attend a function without being invited. He reminded her that she was now his wife more than Daksha‚Äôs daughter and, after marriage, is a member of Shiva‚Äôs family rather than Daksha‚Äôs. The feeling of her bond to her parents overpowered the social etiquette she had to follow. She even had a notion that there was no need to have received an invitation in order to attend as she was Daksha‚Äôs favourite daughter and no formality existed between them. She constantly pleaded and urged Shiva to let her attend the ceremony, and became adamant in her demands without listening to the reasons Shiva provided for not attending the function. He allowed Sati to go to her parents' home, along with his followers including Nandi, and attend the ceremony, but refused to accompany with her. Upon arriving, Sati tried to meet her parents and sisters; Daksha was arrogant and avoided interacting with Sati. He repeatedly snubbed her in front of all the dignitaries but Sati maintained her composure. Because of Sati‚Äôs persistence in trying to meet him, Daksha reacted vehemently, insulting her in front of all the other guests at the ceremony to which she had not been invited. He called Shiva an atheist and cremation ground dweller. As planned, he took advantage of the situation and continued shouting repugnant words against Shiva. Sati felt deep remorse for not listening to her beloved husband. Daksha‚Äôs disdain towards her, and especially her husband Shiva, in front of all the guests was growing each moment she stood there. The shameless insult and humiliation of her and her beloved, eventually became too much to bear. She cursed Daksha for acting so atrociously toward her and Shiva, and reminded him that his haughty behavior had blinded his intellect. She cursed him and warned that the wrath of Shiva would destroy him and his empire. Unable to bear further humiliation, Sati committed suicide by jumping into the sacrificial fire. The onlookers tried to save her but it was too late. They were only able to retrieve the half burnt body of Sati. Daksha's pride in being a Prajapati and his prejudice against his son-in-law created a mass hatred within himself, which resulted in the death of his daughter. The Nandi and the accompanying Bhootaganas left the yajna place after the incident. Nandi cursed the participants and Bhrigu reacted by cursing the Bhootaganas back. =Destruction of the yajna by Shiva= Virabhadra and Daksha Shiva appears as Parabrahma in the scene from the Mahabharata. Shiva was deeply pained upon hearing of his wife's death. His grief grew into a terrible anger when he realized how Daksha had viciously plotted a treachery against him; but it was his innocent wife who fell into the trap instead of him. Shiva learned of Daksha‚Äôs callous behavior towards Sati. Shiva's rage became so intense that he plucked a lock of hair from his head and smashed it on the ground, breaking it into two with his leg. Armed and frightening, two fearsome beings Virabhadra and Bhadrakali (Rudrakali) emerged. Shiva ordered them to kill Daksha and destroy the yajna. The ferocious Virabhadra and Bhadrakali, along with the Bhutaganas, reached the yajna spot. The invitees renounced the yajna and started running away from the turmoil. Sage Bhrigu created an army with his divine penance powers to resist Shiva‚Äôs attack and protect the yajna. Bhrigu‚Äôs army was demolished and the entire premises were ravaged. All those who participated, even the other Prajapatis and the gods, were mercilessly beaten, wounded or even slaughtered. The Vayu Purana mentions the attack of Bhutaganas: the nose of some goddesses were cut, Yama's staff bone was broken, Mitra's eyes were pulled out, Indra was trampled by Virabhadra and Bhutaganas, Pushan's teeth were knocked out, Chandra was beaten heavily, all of the Prajapatis' were beaten, the hands of Vahini were cut off, and Bhrigu's beard was cut off. Daksha was caught and decapitated, the attack culminated when the Bhutaganas started plucking out Bhrigu‚Äôs white beard as a victory souvenir. The Vayu Purana do not mention the decapitation of Daksha, instead it says Yajneshwara, the personification of yajna took the form of an antelope and jumped towards the sky. Virabhadra captured it and decapitated him. Daksha begs mercy from the Parabrahman (the Supreme Almighty who is formless), who rose from the yajna fire and forgives Daksha. The Parabharman informs Daksha that Shiva is in fact a manifestation of Parabrahman. Daksha then becomes a great devotee of Shiva. The Linga Purana and Bhagavatha Purana mention the decapitation of Daksha. Certain other puranas like Harivamsa, Kurma, and Skanda narrate the story from the perspective of the Vishnava-Shaiva community feud prevalent in ancient times. In these puranas, there are fights between Vishnu and Shiva or Virabhadra, with various victors throughout. The story of Daksha Yaga in Vaishnava and Shaiva puranas end with the surrendering of Daksha to the Parabrahman or with the destruction of yajna and decapitation of Daksha. Aftermath Shiva wandering around holding Sati's corpse As the obstruction of the yajna will create havoc and severe ill effects on the nature, Brahma and the god Vishnu went to the grief-stricken Shiva. They comforted and showed their sympathy towards Shiva. They requested him to come to the yajna location and pacify the bhutaganas and allow the yaga to be completed; Shiva agreed. Shiva found the burnt body of Sati. Shiva gave permission to continue yajna. Daksha was absolved by Shiva and the head of a ram (Male goat) was fixed on the decapitated body of Daksha and gave his life back. The yajna was completed successfully. The later story is an epilogue to the story of Daksha yajna mentioned in Shakta Puranas like Devi Bhagavata Purana, Kalika Purana and the folklores of various regions. Shiva was so distressed and could not part from his beloved wife. He took the corpse of Sati and wandered around the universe. To reduce Shiva's grief, Vishnu cuts Sati's corpse as per Vaishnava Puranas; whose parts fell on the places Shiva wandered. The Shaiva version says that her body disintegrated on its own and the parts fell while Shiva was carrying Sati's corpse in various places. These places commemorating each body part came to be known as the Shakti peethas. There are 51 Shakti peethas, representing the 51 letters of Sanskrit. Some of the puranas which came in later ages gave more importance to their supreme deity (depending on Vaishnava, Shaiva, and Shakta sects) in their literature. Shiva went to isolation and solitude for ages and wandered all around until Sati reincarnated as Parvati, the daughter of the King Himavana. Like Sati, Parvati took severe austerities and gave away all her royal privileges and went to the forest. Shiva tested her affection and devotion in disguise. He eventually realized Parvati is Sati herself. Shiva, later on, married Parvati. Shakti Peethas The mythology of Daksha Yaga is considered to be the story of origin of Shakti Peethas. Shakti Peethas are sacred abodes of Devi. These shrines are located all over South Asia. Most of the temples are located in India and Bangladesh; there are a few shrines in Pakistan, Nepal and Sri Lanka. There are 51 Shakti Peethas as per the puranas denoting the 51 Sanskrit alphabets. However 52, and 108 are also believed to exist. Shakti Peethas are the revered temples of the Shakta (Shaktism) sect of Hinduism. It is said that the body part of the corpse of Sati Devi fell in these places and the shrines are mostly now associated with the name of the body part. Out of the 51 Shakti peethas, 18 are said to be Maha Shakti peethas. They are: Sharada Peetham (Saraswati devi), Varanasi Peetham (Vishalakshi devi), Gaya Peetham (Sarvamangala devi), Jwalamukhi Peetham (Vaishnavi devi), Prayaga Peetham (Madhaveswari devi), Kamarupa Peetham (Kamakhyadevi), Draksharama Peetham (Manikyamba devi), Oddyana Peetha (Girija Viraja devi), Pushkarini Peetham (Puruhutika devi), Ujjaini Peetham (Mahakali devi), Ekaveera Peetham (Renuka Devi), Shri Peetham (Mahalakshmi devi), Shrishaila Peetham (Bhramaramba devi), Yogini Peetham (Yogaamba(Jogulamba) devi), Krounja Peetham (Chamundeshwari devi), Pradyumna Peetham (Shrinkala devi), Kanchi Kamakodi Peetham (Kamakshi devi), and Lanka Peetham (Shankari devi). Commemoration Daksheswara Mahadev Temple with Shiva carrying Sati's corpse (rightmost). Various sites like Kottiyoor, Kerala; the Aami Mandir of Chhapra in Bihar the Daksheswara Mahadev Temple of Kankhal in Uttarakhand, and Draksharama, in Andhra Pradesh claim to be the location of Daksha yajna and the self-immolation of Sati. Kottiyoor Vysakha Mahotsavam, a 27‚Äëday Yajna ceremony, conducted in the serene hilly jungle location of Kottiyoor yearly commemorating the Daksha Yaga. The pooja and rituals were classified by Shri Sankaracharya.

The park has carousels, water slides, a roller-coaster, funicular, and a big Ferris Wheel at the edge of the mountain, offering a splendid view over the city.  Overview  The park is situated at the 770 metres height, the highest point of Tbilisi, on the area of more than 100 hectares. It is connected to a motorway (Tbilisi-Okrokana Direction) as well as a funicular, built in 1905. Tbilisi Funicular Tbilisi Funicular is a ropeway railway connecting Chonkadze street and Mtatsminda Park. The length of the funicular road is 501 m, the angle of the tunnel is 28-33¬∞, and the distance between the stations is 0,98 m. The upper station is at 727 m above sea level and the lower station is at 460 m above sea level. Giant Wheel is the highest attraction in Mtatsminda Park: it is 65 m high. The Giant Wheel completes one revolution in 10‚Äì12 minutes. History The park was founded by the Soviet government in the 1930s and was once noted as the 3rd most visited public park in the USSR. [In 2001] the late Georgian billionaire Badri Patarkatsishvili along with his wife, Inna Gudavadze, began transforming the park into a 21st-century theme park. Badri owned the park as a charitable project alongside a number of commercial assets in Georgia, included the Rustavi Steel Plant, Borjomi water, and Imedi TV station. In 2007 Patarkatsishvili became a vocal opponent of the National Movement Party and as a result, fell out of favor with President Mikhail Saakashvili. On the 7 November 2007, his assets including Mtatsminda Park and the Imedi TV station were seized by the Government under claims that the company had ‚Äúviolated numerous times‚Äù the terms of the contract and had failed to pay a rental fee. Representatives of Patarkatsishvili immediately rejected this claims, saying that they were ‚Äúbaseless.‚Äù After Patarkatsishvili's death at his home in England in February 2008, his widow Inna Gudavadze began international arbitration proceedings against the Government of Georgia, claiming that Mtatsminda Park, along with other Georgian assets, had been unfairly expropriated by the government. On the 29 October 2008, Inna Gudavadze said at a press conference in Tbilisi that Mtatsminda Park, as well as the Imedi TV station were ‚ÄúBadri‚Äôs personal projects for Georgia and the Georgian people\\" and that she had a \\"duty to see that these works are carried on.‚Äù In July 2011, the Patarkatsishvili family reached a settlement with the government that saw Mtatsminda Park returned to Inna and the family in return for them renouncing all claims to the ownership of Imedi TV. Following the fall of President Mikhail Saakashvili, Imedi was also subsequently returned to Inna and her family in October 2012 under the new government.TV Imedi \\"returned\\" to Patarkatsishvili family, Georgia Online, 17 October 2012 In July 2014, the Chief Prosecutor‚Äôs Office of Georgia issued a criminal indictment to former President Mikhail Saakashvili and a group of state officials for their role in the illegal expropriation of the Georgian assets owned by the Patarkasishvili family.

He was sent to Charles Burney's school at Greenwich, and, having obtained a Tancred studentship in medicine, entered Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in 1815. He took no degree in arts, but graduated M.B. in 1820. Roupell became a licentiate in medicine in 1824, and M.D. in 1825, and on 30 September 1826 was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. He was a censor in 1829, 1837, and 1838, gave the Croonian lectures in 1832 on general pathology, and in 1833 on cholera (published the same year). After some practice as physician to the Seamen's Hospital Society and to the Foundling Hospital, he was appointed physician to St. Bartholomew's Hospital on 19 June 1834, in succession to Dr. Edward Roberts. In 1838 Roupell succeeded to his father's estates, and then was less active in practice. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1839.royalsociety.org, Roupell; George Leith (1797‚Äì1854). He contracted cholera at Boulogne, and died in Welbeck Street, London, after twenty-six hours' illness, on 29 September 1854. He was unmarried. Works Roupell published in 1833 Illustrations of the Effects of Poisons, a series of notes upon drawings made by George McWhinnie, a demonstrator at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. In 1837 he read before the College of Physicians, and then published, Some Account of a Fever prevalent in the year 1831. He proposed the name \\"febris typhodes rubeoloida\\" for this epidemic disease, of which 12 out of 75 cases were fatal, apparently what is now known as cerebrospinal meningitis. Roupell published in 1839 A Short Treatise on Typhus Fever, based on observations made in the wards of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, but mainly using extracts from other writers. He noted the infection of typhus being conveyed by a corpse.

He joined Asante Kotoko in September 2011, and featured regularly for the side, also winning the Ghana Premier League in the 2012‚Äì13 campaign. In January 2013 Kotoko blocked Anaba's move to Valencia CF. He was also linked to Parma F.C. in the same transfer window, but nothing came of it. In late July 2013, Anaba joined Elche CF in a trial basis. On 13 August, the club agreed a fee with Kotoko, and the player signed a four-year deal late in the month. Anaba was initially assigned to the reserves in Segunda Divisi√≥n B. In July 2014 he was called up to the main squad for the pre-season, being definitely promoted to the first-team in the following month. On 11 October 2014 Anaba returned to the B-side, due to the lack of opportunities in the main squad. He only made his first team debut on 30 August 2015, playing the last 13 minutes in a 2‚Äì1 Segunda Divisi√≥n home win against Bilbao Athletic. On 27 January 2016, Anaba was loaned to CD Alcoyano in the third level until June. Upon returning, he rescinded his contract on 30 August, and joined CD Eldense the following day. On 23 January 2017, Anaba switched teams and countries by agreeing to a contract with Uruguayan Primera Divisi√≥n side Sud Am√©rica. On 14 August, he returned to Spain after joining third-tier club Ontinyent CF. International career Anaba was a member of the Ghana under-20's during the 2013 African U-20 Championship qualification for the 2013 African U-20 Championship. In 2013, he was named in Sellas Tetteh's 23-man squad for the 2013 tournament, hosted in Algeria. He was appointed vice-captain, and featured regularly during the tournament. Anaba was also selected to 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup hosted in Turkey. He was used mainly as a substitute during the competition, but started and captained his side in a 1‚Äì2 loss against France.

It used the flat sided fuselage of the earlier Siemens-Schuckert D.I biplane rather than that of the rounded D.II. Like the D.I the Dr.III was powered by a Siemens-Halske Sh.I nine cylinder rotary engine. The fighter was first flown in July 1917.

An award-winning director and experience designer, she works with scientists and engineers to devise events and experiences. She serves on the Advisory Council of METI (Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence). Ben Hayoun is also an exhibitor and keynote speaker who has worked with museums and design centres across the world. Ben Hayoun collaborated with Sigur R√≥s, Savages, The Prodigy, Beck, Bobby Womack, Damon Albarn, Maywa Denki, Bruce Sterling and Penguin Caf√© in a musical collaboration that took music into space. Launched from a Japanese launch pad in August 2013, she assembled the International Space Orchestra (ISO) ‚Äì the world first orchestra of space scientists from NASA Ames Research Center, Singularity University, International Space University and the SETI Institute. In 2013, Icon Magazine nominated Ben Hayoun as one of the 50 international designers ‚Äúshaping the future‚Äù. In 2014, Wired Magazine awarded Nelly Ben Hayoun a WIRED Innovation fellowship for her work to date and for its potential to make a ‚Äúsignificant impact on the world‚Äù. In 2015, 'Ben Hayoun was nominated for a Women of the Year Achievement Award which rewards, since 1955, women 'who have made a significant achievement' and 'are being recognised for their strides in making the world a better place'. Also in 2015, Nelly Ben Hayoun released her feature film Disaster Playground. The film is based on an investigation of emergency procedures for disasters such as earth-bound rogue asteroids. In 2016, Nelly Ben Hayoun began work on her next project: feature film, digital platform and exhibition entitled ‚ÄúThe Life, the Sea and the Space Viking‚Äù. In 2017, Ben Hayoun has launched with academic partner the Sandberg Instituut, the University of the Underground, a tuition- free postgraduate university providing Master in Design of Experiences and based in the underground of the urban spaces in London and Amsterdam. It is set to support unconventional research practices. For this Ben Hayoun was appointed as \\"Ambassador for the Underground\\" by the independent self-declared artist republic U≈æupis in 2019. Ben Hayoun is a member of the International Astronautical Federation, Space Outreach and Education committee. Background Ben Hayoun is a visiting professor at the Architectural Association School of Architecture (Unknown Fields Division) and the Royal College of Art. She was a senior a lecturer and researcher at Central Saint Martins where she won the CSM University of the Arts Teaching Award in 2016. Ben Hayoun is a contributing writer at Domus and Design Indaba and guest writer at We Make Money Not Art, Blueprint and Bruce Sterling‚Äôs blog \\"Beyond the Beyond\\" on Wired. Ben Hayoun initially trained in painting then Textile Design at Olivier de Serres National College of Art and Design in Paris and then graduated from Design Interactions (MA) at the Royal College of Art. She holds a PhD in Human Geography and Political Philosophy from Royal Holloway, University of London, UK under the supervision of Professor Harriet Hawkins.https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/nelly-ben- hayoun(12d9e978-78ec-476a-8976-586185453442).html Designer of Experiences at SETI Institute Ben Hayoun was appointed Designer of Experiences at the SETI Institute under the supervision of David Morrison, Jill Tarter, Franck Marchis and Frank Drake in May 2013. Her work at SETI focuses on extending outreach activities and design in terms of scope, scale, and methods of engagement towards architecture, installations, environments, social system, performances, experiences and narratives, as events. Extreme fieldwork Ben Hayoun speaks about the value of ‚Äòextreme‚Äô fieldwork which she considers an essential part of designer training. For Ben Hayoun, designing experiences implies tangibility, hence fieldwork, and working collaboratively with experts. Ben Hayoun‚Äôs design practice brought her investigation to the empty lands of Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and the Large Hadron Collider, CERN situated 100m below ground. She has also collided atoms at SLAC, trapped herself in a Soyuz rocket capsule in Baikonur Cosmodrome, and experienced a sonic Booum in the neutrino Observatory Super Kamiokande in Japan. About her practice she said: \\"My working method is to go in situ in scientists‚Äô research centres and design events that radically change and adapt their attitudes to their research to a non-scientific audience‚Äôs creative needs. Design should be embedded in a physical experience, it should be something you remember like seeing a painting and remembering the tone of it.\\" Director of the International Space Orchestra (ISO) Alongside her role as designer of experiences at the SETI Institute, Ben Hayoun is directing the International Space Orchestra. The International Space Orchestra is a project she created and assembled over the summer of 2012. It is composed of a team of space scientists from the NASA Ames Research Center, SETI Institute (Search for Extraterrestrial Life), Singularity University, and the International Space University. In January 2013, the International Space Orchestra feature film had its world premiere at the Rotterdam International Film Festival where it was acclaimed as a \\"masterpiece\\" by the Independent Cinema Office (ICO), a \\"real achievement\\" (DOMUS), \\"as thrilling as watching a rocket launch\\" and \\"Spine Tingling\\" (The Guardian). On April 19, 2016, the International Space Orchestra performed at the historic Fillmore Auditorium, San Francisco, with the all-female British rock group the Savages. On September 24, 2016, the International Space Orchestra opened for the Icelandic group Sigur R√≥s, playing the Sigur R√≥s songs Vidrar, Olsen Olsen, Hoppipola and Hafsol (orchestrated and conducted by Gordon Lustig) to a sold-out audience of 17,500 at the Hollywood Bowl. After their set, members of ISO also performed outreach as \\"Space Vikings\\" to members of the audience, educating the audience on space research related topics. In November 2016, the International Space Orchestra recorded tracks at 25th Street Recording in Oakland, California to celebrate their recent collaborations with rock band Savages and Icelandic group Sigur R√≥s. Launch in space Ben Hayoun's work Ground Control: An Opera in Space, performance recordings by the International Space Orchestra was released from the International Space Station in November, 2013. On 4 August 2013, two ArduSat (Arduino based Nanosatellite run by the company Nanosatisfi) carrying the ISO recordings of Ground Control: An Opera in Space were launched aboard the H-IIB Launch Vehicle, HTV-4 from Yoshinobu Launch Complex at the Tanegashima Space Centre.\\"Nelly Ben Hayoun‚Äôs artwork launched into space\\", \\"Wired\\", by Bruce Sterling, August 7, 2013 On 19 November 2013, these ArduSat got released from the International Space Station by the six-member Expedition 38 crew.

It connects Red Square and Lubyanka Square. It was known as the Street of the 25th of October between 1935 and 1990. The north side of the street is lined with historic buildings, such as the Kazan Cathedral, the Old Mint, Monastery of the Holy Saviour, Greek Monastery of St. Nicholas (from which this street takes its name), and the former Holy Synod Printing Offices, Russia's first publishing house. The south side contains the GUM and the Dormition Church, an example of the Naryshkin Baroque underwritten by the Saltykov boyar family in 1691. Before Stalin's reconstruction of downtown Moscow, the street led to the Vladimir Gates of the Kitay-Gorod wall (1534-38) which used to dominate the Lubyanka Square. Another Naryshkin Baroque church, dating from 1694, adjoined the gate, as did the more recent chapel of St. Pantaleon with a large cupola. All these buildings were razed in 1934. The Nikolskaya Street and the neighbouring Tretyakovsky Proyezd are the center of Moscow's traditional luxury shopping district. It was pedestrianized in August 2013.

The original structure was a four-room log dwelling with one staircase and sat in the top right hand corner of the property, near a natural spring and the current main road. Thomas Hall raised the log dwelling up, situated it upon a set of large logs, and rolled the structure to its current location and began expanding the house throughout 1875 and 1876. He added four rooms (a parlor and three bedrooms) in addition to the preexisting kitchen, dining room, and two upstairs bedrooms - sheathing the preexisting log frame and the new addition with board-and-batten siding. Many decades later, with the advent of plumbing and electricity, the milk cooler (which stood behind the kitchen and had also served earlier as a grain room) was converted into a full bathroom, which is still in use to this day. The two-story frame house features a shallow gabled roof that is covered with slate. The three-bay southwest (front) facade incorporates a central door flanked by one sidelight and is sheltered by a large gabled central porch. The porch is supported by four two-storied paneled columns. The second floor balcony is supported by angled struts and features a sawn balustrade. The house features an integral two-story ell and the roof is hipped where the ell and main-block intersect. A two-story brick exterior chimney is situated at each end of the main house with the northwest chimney being a more modern copy of the chimney at the southeast end. A one-story walled-in porch shelters the rear (northeast) of the main house. Originally, the main yard was partially surrounded by a white picket fence. Many years later, this style was replaced by a white board fence incorporating horizontal members. Today, only the left- hand fencerow extending up from the driveway entrance remains. The foundation of the entire house is limestone. The interior features the original staircase in the kitchen, an open-stringer staircase in the center passage, and simple plastered mantels in the flanking rooms. The lawn is sheltered by a pair of river maples symmetrically placed in front of the house and by an aging catalpa tree near the drive to the northwest side of the house. Portions of an ornamental boxwood garden remain to the southeast of the house. A medium-sized frame granary is located to the north of the house and appears to be contemporary with it. The garage across from the granary was built sometime afterwards. A machine shop stood just past the garage at the border of the farm's hay field. This was destroyed during Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Only the concrete floor remains where the structure once stood. The Thomas Hall House is very significant as an unusual example of a popular regional form. It is one of one sixty-seven frame single-pile, canter-passage houses in the county dating from the mid to late nineteenth century. It is one of very few to be sheathed with board-and-batten siding. The well preserved house demonstrates the influence of pattern books advocating the use of board-and-batten siding for rural residences. The two-story colossal porch and the second-floor balcony are unusual features associated with this form. The house has undergone little alteration and remains in good condition. and Accompanying photo It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the Virginia Landmark Register in 1989. The private Hall Family Cemetery sits near the back left corner of the property along a fence line. There have been fifteen grave plots identified to date, with the most prominent surnames belonging to the families of Hall, Jones, and Chumbley. A well-preserved portion of the original Tyler Road roadbed can be viewed as you approach the home on your left. You can see the original roadbed descending from a slight ridge and it continues parallel to the current road, winding its way through the home's front yard before the footprint becomes absorbed again by the current road just past the main section of front yard.

Originally specialists in singing lamentations, gala appear in temple records dating back from the middle of the 3rd millennium BC.Hartmann 1960:129‚Äì46; Gelb 1975; Renger 1969:187‚Äì95; Krecher 1966:27‚Äì42; Henshaw 1994:84‚Äì96 According to an old Babylonian text, Enki created the gala specifically to sing \\"heart-soothing laments\\" for the goddess Inanna.Kramer 1982:2 Cuneiform references indicate the gendered character of the role.Gelb 1975:73; Lambert 1992:150‚Äì51 Lamentation and wailing originally may have been female professions, so that men who entered the role adopted its forms. Their hymns were sung in a Sumerian dialect known as eme-sal, normally used to render the speech of female gods,Hartmann 1960:138; Krecher 1966; Cohen 1974:11, 32 and some gala took female names.Bott√©ro and Petschow 1975:465 Homosexual proclivities are clearly implied by the Sumerian proverb that reads, \\"When the gala wiped off his anus [he said], ‚ÄòI must not arouse that which belongs to my mistress [i.e., Inanna]‚Äô\\".Gordon 1959, no. 2.100 In fact, the word gala was written using the sign sequence U≈†.KU, the first sign having also the reading gi≈°3 (\\"penis\\"), and the second one dur2 (\\"anus\\"), so perhaps there is some pun involved.Steinkeller 1992:37 Moreover, gala is homophonous with gal4-la \\"vulva\\". However, in spite of all their references of their effeminate character (especially in the Sumerian proverbs), many administrative texts mention gala priests who had children, wives, and large families.Rubio 2001:270; Michalowski 2006 In addition, some gala priests were women.al-Rawi 1992 See also * Galli (eunuch or transfeminine priests in Phrygia and the Roman Empire) Notes References * Al-Rawi, F.

It was destroyed by East German authorities in 1978 as it stood too close to the Inner German border (part of the larger \\"Iron Curtain\\"), the border between the post-war states of East and West Germany. It lay in the extreme south of Thuringia in the Heldburger Land in the district of Hildburghausen, only five hundred metres (1,640 ft) away from the Thuringian- Bavarian border. In January 1965, the authorities destroyed the small village church. In September 1978, the last family left the village, after which all the buildings in the village were demolished and the land leveled. History Billmuthausen is first mentioned in historical records in 1340 under the name of Billmuthehusen and in 1528 under the name of Bylmethausen. In 1840, the village had 14 households, a mill and a church. A decade later, the village's population stood at 68. The former site of the village is now a memorial with a marker stone and cross, and a new chapel is located at the site of destroyed church.

He was a pioneer of spectroscopy, and the first person to establish a relationship between the wavelengths of spectral lines of the elements and their positions in the periodic table (published in 1883), and he studied also the relationship between the structure and spectra of a wide variety of organic compounds. In 1881, he hypothesized the presence of ozone in the atmosphere. Life He was born in Lichfield in Staffordshire on 3 February 1847, the son of Thomas Hartley a portrait painter and his wife, Caroline Lockwood. He studied Science at Edinburgh University and Marburg in Germany. He married Mary Laffan in 1882 and they had one son John who was killed in the First World War. From 1871 to 1879 he lectured in Chemistry at King's College London. He was then given a professorship at the Royal College of Science in Dublin, remaining in this role until retiring in 1911. (Obituary 12 Sept 1913) In 1877 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Alexander Crum Brown, Sir James Dewar, John Hutton Balfour, and Sir William Turner. His work also led to his election to Fellowship of the Royal Society in 1884, and he was awarded an honorary doctorate (D.Sc.) by the Royal University of Ireland in October 1901. He was knighted in 1911, following retiral. He died in Braemar on 11 September 1913. Works His published works included: 'Air and its Relations to Life' (1876),A review of this book is available in the archives of The Spectator magazine, with an 1875 article explaining this work's significance, accessible here 'Water, Air and Disinfectants' (1877) and 'Quantitative Analysis' (1887).Walter Noel Hartley's 1907 article, 'On the Thermochemistry of Flame Spectra at High Temperatures' in the Proceedings of the Royal Society is available to preview, here He was awarded a gold medal at the 1904 St Louis Exposition, for scientific applications of photography and a silver medal in chemical arts. In 1906 he gained the Longstaff Medal of the Chemical Society for researches in spectro- chemistry, and in 1908, the Grand Prix for spectrographic research at the Franco-British Exhibition. He was president of Section B (Chemistry) of the British Association, 1903-04. Family Hartley married novelist Mary Laffan (1849-1916) in 1882. He was survived by one son, Walter John Hartley, who died whilst serving in the British Army during the First World War at Gallipoli in 1915.

A major component of this risk can result from necessary use of drugs in pregnancy to manage the disease. In such circumstances, women who wish to continue with a pregnancy require extra medical care, often from an interdisciplinary team. Such a team might include (besides an obstetrician) a specialist in the disorder and other practitioners (for example, maternal-fetal specialists or obstetric physicians, dieticians, etc.). Endocrine disorders =Diabetes mellitus= Diabetes mellitus and pregnancy deals with the interactions of diabetes mellitus (not restricted to gestational diabetes) and pregnancy. Risks for the child include miscarriage, growth restriction, growth acceleration, fetal obesity (macrosomia), polyhydramnios and birth defects. =Thyroid disease= Thyroid disease in pregnancy can, if uncorrected, cause adverse effects on fetal and maternal well-being. The deleterious effects of thyroid dysfunction can also extend beyond pregnancy and delivery to affect neurointellectual development in the early life of the child. Demand for thyroid hormones is increased during pregnancy which may cause a previously unnoticed thyroid disorder to worsen. The most effective way of screening for thyroid dysfunction is not known. A review found that more women were diagnosed with thyroid dysfunction when all pregnant women were tested instead of just testing those at ‚Äòhigh-risk‚Äô of thyroid problems (those with family history, signs or symptoms). Finding more women with thyroid dysfunction meant that the women could have treatment and management through their pregnancies. However the outcomes of the pregnancies were surprisingly similar so more research is needed to look at the effects of screening all women for thyroid problems. Hypercoagulability Hypercoagulability in pregnancy is the propensity of pregnant women to develop thrombosis (blood clots). Pregnancy itself is a factor of hypercoagulability (pregnancy-induced hypercoagulability), as a physiologically adaptive mechanism to prevent post partum bleeding. However, when combined with any additional underlying hypercoagulable state, the risk of thrombosis or embolism may become substantial.Page 264 in: Infections =Vertically transmitted infections= Many infectious diseases have a risk of vertical transmission to the fetus. Examples include: * Chickenpox * Chlamydia * Herpes simplex or Neonatal herpes simplex * HIV * Human T-lymphotropic virus * Syphilis Infections in pregnancy also raise particular concerns about whether or not to use drugs in pregnancy (that is, antibiotics or antivirals) to treat them. For example, pregnant women who contract H1N1 influenza infection are recommended to receive antiviral therapy with either oseltamivir (which is the preferred medication) or zanamivir.Health Care Guideline: Routine Prenatal Care. Fourteenth Edition. By the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement. July 2010. Both amantadine and rimantadine have been found to be teratogenic and embryotoxic when given at high doses in animal studies. =Candidal vulvovaginitis= In pregnancy, changes in the levels of female sex hormones, such as estrogen, make a woman more likely to develop candidal vulvovaginitis. During pregnancy, the Candida fungus is more prevalent (common), and recurrent infection is also more likely. There is no clear evidence that treatment of asymptomatic candidal vulvovaginitis in pregnancy reduces the risk of preterm birth. Candidal vulvovaginitis in pregnancy should be treated with intravaginal clotrimazole or nystatin for at least 7 days. =Bacterial vaginosis= Bacterial vaginosis is an imbalance of naturally occurring bacterial flora in the vagina. Bacterial vaginosis occurring during pregnancy may increase the risk of pregnancy complications, most notably premature birth or miscarriage. However, this risk is small overall and appears more significant in women who have had such complications in an earlier pregnancy.Bacterial vaginosis from National Health Service, UK. Page last reviewed: 03/10/2013 Valvular heart disease In case of valvular heart disease in pregnancy, the maternal physiological changes in pregnancy confer additional load on the heart and may lead to complications. In individuals who require an artificial heart valve, consideration must be made for deterioration of the valve over time (for bioprosthetic valves) versus the risks of blood clotting in pregnancy with mechanical valves with the resultant need of drugs in pregnancy in the form of anticoagulants. Other autoimmune disorders = Celiac disease = Untreated celiac disease can cause spontaneous abortion (miscarriage), intrauterine growth restriction, small for gestational age, low birthweight and preterm birth. Often reproductive disorders are the only manifestation of undiagnosed celiac disease and most cases are not recognized. Complications or failures of pregnancy cannot be explained simply by malabsorption, but by the autoimmune response elicited by the exposure to gluten, which causes damage to the placenta. The gluten-free diet avoids or reduces the risk of developing reproductive disorders in pregnant women with celiac disease. Also, pregnancy can be a trigger for the development of celiac disease in genetically susceptible women who are consuming gluten. =Systemic lupus erythematosus= Systemic lupus erythematosus and pregnancy confers an increased rate of fetal death in utero and spontaneous abortion (miscarriage), as well as of neonatal lupus. =Beh√ßet's disease= Pregnancy does not have an adverse effect on the course of Beh√ßet's disease and may possibly ameliorate its course. Still, there is a substantial variability in clinical course between patients and even for different pregnancies in the same patient. Also, the other way around, Beh√ßet's disease confers an increased risk of pregnancy complications, miscarriage and Cesarean section. =Multiple sclerosis= Being pregnant decreases the risk of relapse in multiple sclerosis; however, during the first months after delivery the risk increases. Overall, pregnancy does not seem to influence long-term disability. Multiple sclerosis does not increase the risk of congenital abnormality or miscarriage.Multiple Sclerosis: Pregnancy Q&A; from Cleveland Clinic, retrieved January 2014. Others The following conditions may also become worse or be a potential risk to the pregnancy: *Cancer *Chronic hypertension *Cirrhosis *Congenital disorders that may be passed on to offspring *Heart defects, especially primary pulmonary hypertension and Eisenmenger's syndrome *Kidney disorders *Mental health. **Depression has been linked to higher rates of preterm delivery. *Respiratory disorders and diseases (associated, for example, with placental abruption) **Asthma *Seizure disorders *Structural abnormalities in the cervix *Structural abnormalities in the uterus *Viral hepatitis References * ","title":"Pre-existing disease in pregnancy"},{"id":"40228169","text":"Ben Hall is a 1975 Australian TV series based on the bush ranger Ben Hall.Albert Moran, Moran's Guide to Australian TV Series, AFTRS 1993 p 74 It stars Jon Finch in the titular role, Evin Crowley as Biddy Hall, John Castle as bushranger Frank Gardiner, Brian Blain as Sir Frederick Pottinger, Jack Charles as Billy Dargin and John Orcsik as John Gilbert (bushranger).

The first property in the area was Mount Gipps Station In 1865 with Corona, Mundi Mundi and Poolamacca being established shortly afterward. Sidney Kidman worked at Poolamacca during the 1870s as a boundary rider and stockman. In 1877 the property was put up for auction by the trustees of the estate of Messrs E. M. Bagot and G. Bennett. At this stage the property was approximately in size along with a flock of 34,906 sheep. The property comprised ten separate runs including the 64,000 acre Bijerkerno run to the 25,000 acre Torrowangee run. John Brougham acquired a half share in Poolamacca in 1889 and later secured the lease outright. Brougham remained at Poolamacca until 1915 when he moved to Adelaide. In 1892 approximately 50 Aboriginal people, were moved to Poolamacca station which under the regime of the late owner, Mr J.

Professional career Dr.Subhash Gupta is accredited all over the world for his leading work in liver transplantation in the Indian subcontinent. Dr.Subhash Gupta and his team has successfully conducted 300 Living Donor Liver Transplant in 2013 at Centre for Liver and Biliary sciences situated at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, New Delhi which makes them the Most busiest and only Centre of the World.This has meant that 600 major Liver Surgeries each lasting 12 to 16 hours were conducted in 2013. This is an Amazing exercise and very few Centres in the World have managed to complete as any number of Transplants in One Year. Dr.Subhash Gupta JoinedSir Ganga Ram Hospital in 1998 and set up Liver Transplantation along with Dr. S Nundy. The department conducted the first liver transplant in 2001. This was a deceased donor liver transplant. Along with Dr. S Nundy he started living donor liver transplantation as the predominant form of liver transplantation. After a slow start, the liver transplantation program took off with 66 transplants in 2006. He has pioneered the Development of LDLT in India.Previously patients had to travel abroad to get this treatment at a very high cost.His surgical techniques have brought down the cost to a fraction of what it costs elsewhere and made Liver Transplant available to patients from the India, Africa, Middle East and Far East. =Founder of CLBS(Centre for Liver & Biliary Sciences)= Dr.Subhash Gupta is the Owner/President of The Center for Liver and Biliary Sciences. He has acquired an outstanding reputation in the field of Liver Transplantation comprehensive management of Complex conditions of Liver, Biliary tree and Pancreas.

Pricyclopyge had an extratropical distribution, and there is evidence that it lived in darker parts of the water column (around 175m deep). Pricyclopyge has huge eyes, an inverted pear-shaped glabella, six thorax segments, with on the 3rd two small discs.Whittington, H. B. et al. (1997) Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology. Part O, Revised, Volume 1 ‚Äì Trilobita ‚Äì Introduction, Order Agnostida, Order Redlichiida. Pricyclopyge is known from what are today China, the Czech Republic, France, and the United Kingdom.Paleobiology Database  Description  Pygidium of P. longicephala Like other cyclopygids, Pricyclopyge lacks genal spines. Pricyclopyge has six thorax segments of which the third from the front carries two very characteristic round discs that are presumed to have been bioluminescent organs, and if true, this suggests that Pricyclopyge swam upside down. It has a wide and stout axis, that tapers gradually backwards until it ends in a semicircle close to the border of the pygidium. The short side lobes (or pleurae) of the thorax segments gradually become wider further back so that the thorax is widest at its back, with the tips of the pleurae of the 6th segment sometimes enlarged, bent backwards and so bordering the pygidium. The pygidium is more than twice as wide as long, the axis showing 3 or 4 clearly defined rings, while segmentation of the pleural area is barely visible. The pygidial border furrow is clear. = Eyes = ommatidia Like all cyclopygids, Pricyclopyge has huge eyes, that largely encircle the inverted pear-shaped glabella. These eyes have a wide angle of view, both horizontal and vertical, reminiscent of the eyes of dragonflies. The individual lenses in the eyes are hexagonally arranged, with their centers approximately 0.25 mm apart. Merger of both eyes, creating a visor, has appeared in several cyclopigid genera, but only in Pricyclopyge binodosa several stages in this development can be seen as a consecutive series of subspecies collected from successive zones in the late Arenig to the Llanvirn. This development improves the sensitivity of the eye for objects that move relative to the eye, which might have been particularly useful under low-light conditions and when rapidly moving. The extant hyperiid amphipod Cystisoma also has such fused eyes. Although the distance between the eyes varies within any one population of the earlier subspecies, the eyes only touch and merge in P. binodosa synophthalma. Monocular trilobites are always younger than closely related species with normal paired eyes, and is an example of a trend that occurred several times in parallel.  Ecology  It is presumed that Pricyclopyge swam upside down in dimly lit oceanic waters outside the tropic belt. It occurs together with other cyclopygids, blind or nearly blind deepwater benthic trilobites, and free-floating oceanic graptolites. It probably hunted the zooplankton and may have migrated in the evening towards the surface and in the morning to greater depths, following prey and possibly avoiding some of its potential predators.

United States, 177 U.S. 529 (1900), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that an individual had the right to use force to resist an unlawful arrest and was entitled to a jury instruction to that effect. In 1899, a tribal police officer, John Bad Elk, shot and killed another tribal police officer who was attempting to arrest Bad Elk without a warrant, on a misdemeanor charge, for a crime allegedly committed outside of the presence of the arresting officer. The Supreme Court reversed his conviction, noting that a person had the right to resist an unlawful arrest, and in the case of a death, murder may be reduced to manslaughter. The Supreme Court held the arrest to be unlawful due, in part, to the lack of a valid warrant.  Background  = Common law history = The English common law has long recognized the right of an individual to resist with reasonable force an attempt of a police officer to make an unlawful arrest., 250 (2009); Darrell A.H. Miller, Retail Rebellion and the Second Amendment 86 939, 948 (2011). This offered a complete defense if nonlethal force was used, at 250. and would reduce a murder charge to manslaughter if a death ensued.Miller at 948. In Hopkin Huggett's case,Hopkin Huggett's case (1666) 84 Eng. Rep. 1082 (K.B.). English officials illegally seized a man to serve in the King's army., 682, 682-84 (2d ed. 1907); Miller at 949. Huggett and others observed this and fought to free the man. at 682-84; Miller at 949. In the course of the fight one of the King's men, John Barry, was killed and Huggett was put on trial for murder. The English court ruled that since the officer was making an unlawful arrest, the most that could be charged was manslaughter. at 682-84; Miller at 948. In 1709, in Queen v. Tooley,Queen v. Tooley (1709) 92 Eng. Rep. 349 (K.B.). the English court again found that when resisting an unlawful arrest, the death of an individual would result in a manslaughter charge instead of a murder charge.Miller at 950. When the United States separated from England, the common law was adopted by the new American courts and the right to resist unlawful arrest was clearly recognized. at 250; , 1 ¬ß 1.13(a) (5th ed.). = Death of John Kills Back = Map of Pine Ridge Indian Reservation U.S. Indian Police badge, of type in use in South Dakota in 1890 On March 8, 1899, John Bad Elk fired several shots from his pistol from or near his home on the Pine Ridge Reservation.Bad Elk v. United States, ; Craig Hemmens & Daniel Levin, ‚ÄòNot a Law at All‚Äò: A Call for a Return to the Common Law Right to Resist Unlawful Arrest, 29 1, 14 (1999); Andrew P. Wright, Resisting Unlawful Arrests: Inviting Anarchy or Protecting Individual Freedom? 46 383, 386 (1997). At the time Bad Elk was employed as a tribal police officer for the Oglala Lakota Sioux tribe.Bad Elk, 177 U.S. at 531; Hemmens at 14; Wright at 386. Captain Gleason, who was in charge of that part of the reservation, heard the shots and asked Bad Elk to stop by his office to discuss the matter, but Bad Elk did not show up.Bad Elk, 177 U.S. at 531; The World of Law 9 22 (William Cyrus Sprague, Griffith Ogden Ellis, & Frederick R Austin eds., 1901). Gleason then ordered several other tribal police officers to arrest Bad Elk and to take him to the Pine Ridge Agency, about 25 miles away. Three officers contacted Bad Elk, who refused to go with them, telling them that he would go in the morning.Bad Elk, 177 U.S. at 532; Hemmens at 14. The officers then tried to arrest Bad Elk, who shot and killed John Kills Back. Bad Elk claimed that Kills Back had reached for his pistol and that Bad Elk fired in self-defense.Bad Elk, 177 U.S. at 532; Wright at 387. Kills Back and the other officers did not have an arrest warrant, nor was the offense one that they could arrest for without a warrant.Hemmens at 14; Wright at 386. = Trial = In April 1899 at Sioux Falls, Bad Elk was tried in the United States Circuit Court for the District of South Dakota for murder. At trial, Bad Elk requested a jury instruction allowing the jury to consider that he had a right to resist an unlawful arrest.Bad Elk, 177 U.S. at 533. Instead, the court gave a jury instruction that stated that Bad Elk did not have the right to resist an arrest and that Bad Elk only had the right to resist if the arresting officers used excessive force in making the arrest.Bad Elk, 177 U.S. at 533-34; Wright at 387. The jury convicted Bad Elk and sentenced him to death.Sprague at 22. His execution date was set at June 16, 1899.Death to be the Penalty: John Bad Elk Sentenced to Hang on June 16, , Apr. 27, 1899, at 22 (via Newspapers.com).  Opinion of the Court  Justice Peckham, author of the unanimous opinion Justice Rufus Wheeler Peckham delivered the opinion of a unanimous court. Peckham noted that the prosecution's case and the defendant's case varied in their presentation of the facts.Bad Elk, 177 U.S. at 534; Hemmens at 14. First he noted that the prosecution did not show and the court could not find a legal basis for the arrest, that at most the firing of the pistol was a misdemeanor if it were a crime at all.Hemmens at 14; Late Legal Decisions, , June 16, 1900, at 6 (via Newspapers.com). An officer could arrest for a felony without a warrant, but to arrest for a misdemeanor, the crime had to have occurred in the officer's presence. They ruled that the captain also did not have the authority to order the arrest.Bad Elk, 177 U.S. at 534; Susan McPherson, Constitutional Law - Fourth Amendment - Warrantless Arrest for Misdemeanor Traffic Violation Does Not Violate Fourth Amendment Protection Against Unreasonable Seizure 32 265, 273 (2001-2002). The court noted that at common law, an individual had a right to use reasonable force to resist an unlawful arrest.Hemmens at 14; Wright at 387. Peckham said that the requested jury instruction was therefore material and that it was error for the trial court not to allow it.Bad Elk, 177 U.S. at 534; Late Legal Decisions, at 6. The court stated: > At common law, if a party resisted arrest by an officer without warrant and > who had no right to arrest him, and if in the course of that resistance the > officer was killed, the offense of the party resisting arrest would be > reduced from what would have been murder if the officer had had the right to > arrest, to manslaughter. What would be murder if the officer had the right > to arrest might be reduced to manslaughter by the very fact that he had no > such right. So an officer, at common law, was not authorized to make an > arrest without a warrant, for a mere misdemeanor not committed in his > presence.Bad Elk, 177 U.S. at 534; Hemmens at 15 (internal citation > omitted). The decision of the lower court was reversed and the case remanded for either a new trial or dismissal.Bad Elk, 177 U.S. at 538; Hemmens at 15; Sprague at 22; Wright at 387.  Subsequent developments  = Scholarly response = The first response to the common law rule appeared in 1924, when it was questioned in a law review note which advocated abrogating the rule.Hemmens at 18. In 1942, Harvard Law professor Sam Bass Warner, in his support of the Uniform Arrest Act, proposed that a citizen had a duty to submit to arrest, legal or not, if he reasonably believed that the arresting individual was a peace officer.Hemmens at 18-19; Miller at 953. Warner's explanations and reasoning appear to have been \\"accepted without question by subsequent courts...\\"Hemmens at 22. In 1969, during the height of the Civil Rights Movement, Paul Chevigny of the New York branch of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) responded that an unlawful arrest was a trespass against the person and was not consistent with Warner's explanations.Hemmens at 31; Miller at 955. = Common and statutory law = In the 1960s, courts began to limit the right to resist an unlawful arrest, apparently influenced by Warner and by the Model Penal Code, which had eliminated the right. at 251; Hemmens at 22-23; Miller at 953; at ¬ß 1.13(a). In 1965, the first court struck down the right in New Jersey., 36 (1977); Hemmens at 24. Although a few states adopted the Uniform Arrest Act, a majority of the states did not. The Model Penal Code in 1962 eliminated the right to resist an unlawful arrest on two grounds. at 36; Hemmens at 23. First, there were better alternative means of resolving the issue; second, resistance would likely result in greater injury to the citizen without preventing the arrest. at 250-51; Hemmens at 24. By 2012, only fourteen states allowed a citizen to resist an unlawful arrest.Miller, at 953. The case also received negative treatment in subsequent Supreme Court cases, from Carroll v. United States in 1925, on arrests and vehicle searches, to Atwater v. City of Lago Vista in 2001, holding that an arrest without a warrant, even for a misdemeanor, is lawful when authorized by statute. = Internet meme and myths = The case has also been cited on various internet sites as giving citizens the authority to resist unlawful arrest. This claim is normally put forth in connection with a misquoted version of Plummer v. State.Plummer v. State, 34 N.E. 968 (Ind. 1893); Robery Cubby, The Right to Resist An Unlawful Arrest , (Dec. 10, 2014); Paul Markel, Do You Have the Right to Resist an Unlawful Arrest? (May 9, 2014); Jon Roland, Your Right of Defense Against Unlawful Arrest, (July 10, 1996, as modified as of May 6, 2015). One version is: > Citizens may resist unlawful arrest to the point of taking an arresting > officer's life if necessary.‚Äù Plummer v. State, 136 Ind. 306 [sic]. This > premise was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case: > John Bad Elk v. U.S., 177 U.S. 529. The Court stated: ‚ÄúWhere the officer is > killed in the course of the disorder which naturally accompanies an > attempted arrest that is resisted, the law looks with very different eyes > upon the transaction, when the officer had the right to make the arrest, > from what it does if the officer had no right. What may be murder in the > first case might be nothing more than manslaughter in the other, or the > facts might show that no offense had been committed.Scott H. Greenfield, > Curb Your Catharsis, (Sep. 16, 2013). Modern sources citing Plummer and Bad Elk have tended to discuss the issue as defense against unlawful force; under contemporary law in most jurisdictions, a person may not use force to resist an unlawful arrest.Wright at 387-88 (covering the common law rule, but noting that as of publication, 36 of the 50 states prohibited resisting unlawful arrests); see generally Miller, at 953 (only 13 states allow resistance to an unlawful arrest).

He is a Professor in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of New South Wales. Khachigian is known for his studies in the area of transcriptional control and for translating basic discoveries into potential novel therapeutics. He is the inventor of the experimental drug Dz13, which may help treat a range of common diseases or complications including skin cancer, post-angioplasty restenosis, macular degeneration and asthma.  Early life and education  Khachigian was born to Armenian parents who served as evangelical protestant missionaries in the Middle East and migrated to Australia at age 18 months. He was raised in Naremburn, New South Wales, Australia and attended Naremburn Public School and later Crows Nest Boys' High School. Khachigian obtained a B.Sc. with first-class honours in biochemistry in 1986 and Ph.D. in growth factor biochemistry and cell biology in 1993 from the University of New South Wales. He performed doctoral research at the School of Medicine, St George Hospital (Sydney), Division of Biomolecular Engineering, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and Department of Haematology, Prince of Wales Hospital (Sydney). He obtained a D.Sc. in vascular biology and transcriptional control in 2004 from the University of New South Wales.  Research  Khachigian is a vascular biologist with a strong focus on \\"bench to bedside\\" translational research. His research has centered mainly on interrogating the roles of immediate-early genes (such as Egr1 and c-Jun) as molecular switches in the pathogenesis of disease. He and his collaborators have uncovered regulatory networks underpinning waves of transcriptional change in cellular activation in a range of single gene and systems-based approaches. Khachigian has developed a range of interventional approaches to target key regulatory genes for the development of novel therapeutics, particularly catalytic DNA. Khachigian invented Dz13, a molecule that targets the transcription factor c-Jun, implicated in a range of common proliferative, occlusive and inflammatory diseases. In 1999 Khachigian reported the first use of catalytic DNA as new experimental drugs in an animal model of any kind. In 2013 he reported the first clinical use of catalytic DNA in human subjects. This was later followed by numerous other independent, some multi-center, clinical trials evaluating DNAzymes in humans, including DNAzymes targeting EBV-LMP1 in patients with nasopharyngeal cancer and DNAzymes targeting another nuclear transcription factor GATA3 in patients with allergic asthma demonstrating DNAzyme efficacy and safety. Targeted catalytic DNA-based molecular therapy may represent a novel, effective and less invasive therapeutic approach in humans.  Career  After obtaining his Ph.D. and with the support of a CJ Martin Research Fellowship from the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia and Fulbright Program, Khachigian studied vascular biology and transcriptional control with Professor Tucker Collins at Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston USA. On returning to Australia in 1996 he established the Transcription Laboratory within the Centre for Vascular Research, Faculty of Medicine at the University of New South Wales. He has been supported by an NHMRC RD Wright Fellowship, Principal Research Fellowship, Senior Principal Research Fellowship and the Australia Fellowship. In 2004 Khachigian was appointed Professor in Medicine and in 2009 appointed Director of the Centre for Vascular Research, succeeding its Foundation Director Scientia Professor Colin Chesterman AO.  Service  Khachigian has a strong record of service to international and national scientific societies and has been at the helm of numerous international conferences in vascular biology, drug design and discovery, and interdisciplinary health and medical research, including the International Vascular Biology Meeting and Congress of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis. He has served as President of the Australian Society for Medical Research and President of the Australian Vascular Biology Society. He is a member of the Faculty of 1000.  Awards  Khachigian has received numerous prestigious national and international awards including the Commonwealth Health Minister's Award for Excellence in Health and Medical Research, GlaxoSmithKline Award for Research Excellence, Gottschalk Medal from the Australian Academy of Science, Khwarizmi International Award for Science and Technology, and 3 separate Eureka Prizes from the Australian Museum for scientific research, medical research and international scientific collaboration.  Investigations  The University of New South Wales investigated matters involving Khachigian in accordance with the Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research. Khachigian maintained there was no wrongdoing and a trial involving Dz13 was put on hold ‚Äúto err on the side of caution‚Äù. Six research articles co-authored by Khachigian have been retracted and one corrected.http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dKhachigian%252c%2bLevon%2bM None of the multiple different, independent external expert panels of inquiry or investigations conducted under the Australian Code made any finding of research misconduct on the part of Khachigian and concluded that breaches arose from genuine error or honest oversight. In 2017, a fifth independent external expert panel, set up following the Australian Research Integrity Committee‚Äôs review of all previous independent external expert investigations came to the same conclusion that there was no finding of research misconduct. This decision was discussed in a news article by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in October 2019.

His style is notable for its use of brown packing tape as a medium and cutting on acrylic glass with a scalpel to create portraits that need lighting from behind to be seen.  Career  Zorn's rise began in 2011 after publishing a two-minute self-made video on YouTube ‚ÄúStreet Art by Max Zorn Making of Tape Art‚Äù showing how Zorn hangs his translucent tape art on street lamps. It was picked up by national and international media, and by April 2012 Zorn created over 150 works of tape art. In a speech about creating street art seen in the dark at TEDx Talent Search, Max Zorn states: Zorn's first solo show was held in downtown Paris by 2012 in a vintage ballroom, and in that same year he was invited by the Sovereign Art Foundation to feature his first art fair exhibition and live performance at Art Basel Hong Kong which was sold as a unique original for a price that doubled the artwork's value. His in-house gallery Stick Together has exclusively exhibited his work annually since 2013 in Miami during Art Basel Miami week. Their first Miami exhibition together was held inside Wood Tavern, a small bar in the heart of Wynwood Art District that sold out in two days. Stick Together Gallery has since exhibited Zorn's solo showcase of new work at Aqua Art Miami and most recently SCOPE Miami Beach. He has sold out his entire solo exhibitions in Miami with Stick Together Gallery to date. Zorn has worked on large-scale tape art projects with festivals like Amsterdam Light Festival in The Netherlands , the Living Arts Festival in Bangkok , Dubai Canvas in Dubai , and the South By Southwest festival in Austin, Texas . His live artwork performances and pieces have been featured and collected from museums such as MUCA (Museum of Urban and Contemporary Art) in Munich , EYE Filmmuseum , the Amsterdam Museum and The Dutch Resistance Museum in Amsterdam , the Cornell Art Museum at Old School Square , and the international museum franchise Ripley's Believe It Or Not . His artworks have sold on auction at Tajan Auction House and Digard Auction Company in Paris, Chiswick Auctions in London and Julien's auction in Los Angeles .  Influences  Zorn‚Äôs settings and themes are influenced by a combination of classic novels, nostalgic history and film noir blended together by sepia tones of brown tape illuminated from behind. Zorn says he also finds inspiration from characters in novels produced by writers from The Lost Generation specifically Ernest Hemingway, John Steinbeck, and Tom Wolfe. His fascination with American cityscapes began as a child when his bedroom wallpaper was the New York City skyline. His work also is influenced by American realism artists such as Edward Hopper, however Zorn's process rarely involves any photo reference and most of his artworks are created from scratch.  Works  Zorn's work has been placed in Key West, Florida, Canada and Hong Kong. Through his project Stick Together, his work has also been put on street lamps by fans worldwide, with large-scale street art installed in multiple windowpanes in locations like coffeeshop De Dampkring in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. In collaboration with Scotch Tape, Max Zorn created the largest outdoor tape art installation he ever made out of brown packing tape, a 40-square-foot freestanding illuminated artwork titled \\"Huckleberry\\" for the South By Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, in 2016. His most-valued work sold for $30,000 - a three-panel triptych called \\"Floating in Time\\" created in 2018. In a 2016 TEDx Talk in Munich, Germany, Stick Together Gallery owner Audrey Sykes explained that Max Zorn tape artworks have multiple facets, and the simple concept of a universal medium like tape being used in a creative way can be seen as contemporary art, upcycling art, and help a larger audience understand art because of its \\"wow\\" factor.  Stick Together  Max Zorn is the founder and creator of the project Stick Together, an online game that spreads street art around the world for free. In 2012 Stick Together became the official name of the in- house gallery that has exclusive access to Max Zorn artworks and at times doubles as an artist agency and representative. Based in Amsterdam, Stick Together Gallery also exhibits online and with art fairs globally.

History Eberts Villaby on a drawing by Franz ≈†ediv√Ω from 1896 The development takes its name after Herman Ebert who acquired a farm at the site in 1894. He constructed a fountain at the centre of the development, a pumping station at its highest point and began the construction of houses which he sold to members of the Copenhagen middle class as they were completed. The Association of House Owners in Sundbyvester ( Foreningen af Villaejere i Villabyen I Sundbyvester)was founded on 1 September 1896. The original plans for the area also included a community house with a conditorie but it was given up in 1897 due to an estimated cost of DKK 30,000. The last houses were completed in 1898 and water and gas was installed in 1899. Herman Ebert√∏s Villa \\"Sans Souci\\" at Christians II's Plads 9. In 1907, Herman Ebert ceded ownership of the fountain and street network to the Association of House Owners and electricity was installed in all houses. In 1925, the Association of House Owners changed its name to Eberts Villaby. One of the houses was expropriated and subsequently demolished in connection with an expansion of Englandsvej from 10 to 22 metres. Another four houses were demolished in 1856 as a consequence of a building project on Amagerbrogade. Street names The fountain Ebert launched a public competition for the naming of the streets which was created with the establishment of the new neighbourhood. The names were announced on 14 April 1895 and commemorate persona from the time of king Christian II's reign: * Christian II's All√© ‚Äì King Christian II * Dronning Elisabeths Alle * Dyvekes Alle√© ‚Äì Dyveke Sigbritsdatter * Sigbrit s all√© ‚Äì Sigbrit Willoms * Skipper Clements Alle ‚Äì Skipper Clement * Hans Bogbinders All√© ‚Äì Hans Bogbinder The area today The houses are built in the Historicist style which was popular in Denmark at the time. Many houses are named after prominent historic buildings (such as Rosenborg, Rosenvold), localities (Hindsholm, a peninsula off Funen). Herman Ebert's own villa, Sans Souci, which is inspired by Franz Joseph I of Austria's summer residence in Bad Ischl.

History On March 26, 1872, Kimberly, Clark & Co. was established in Neenah, Wisconsin through the partnership of four businessmen‚ÄîJohn A. Kimberly, Havilah Babcock, Charles B. Clark and Frank C. Shattuck. The first healthcare product by Kimberly-Clark was absorbent wadding, intended to replace cotton. It was used as a bandage for wounded soldiers in World War I. Army nurses adapted the material for menstrual use. Kaycel fabric for surgical gowns was developed by Kimberly- Clark in 1960 [? - the Korean War ran 1950-53] for use in field hospitals during the Korean War. In 1980, Health Care began to grow as it was separated from consumer packaged goods management and products, such as Kleenex, with a move to Roswell, Georgia. Kimberly-Clark Health Care had offices in North America, Latin America, Australia, New Zealand, China, Hong Kong, Europe, Asia and India. It also sold its products in more than 150 countries. =Expansion= Kimberly-Clark Health Care opened European Health Care operations in Brussels in 1991. In 1999, Kimberly-Clark Health Care expanded into new global markets. =Company acquisitions= In 1998, Ballard Medical Product, a maker of disposable medical devices for respiratory care, gastroenterology and cardiology, was purchased by Kimberly-Clark for $764 million. That same year, Kimberly-Clark also acquired TECNOL Medical Products, Inc., a maker of disposable face masks and patient care products. Kimberly- Clark acquired Safeskin Corporation in 2000, a maker of disposable gloves for healthcare, high technology and scientific industries. In 2009, Kimberly-Clark acquired Baylis Medial Company‚Äôs Pain Management Business and I-Flow Corporation. On April 11, 2016, Halyard announced its agreement to acquire CORPAK MedSystems, a company specializing in enteral access devices. The acquisition is an all-cash transaction for a total consideration of $174 million. =Spin-off= In November 2013, Kimberly-Clark Corporation announced the company‚Äôs plan to pursue a tax-free spin-off of the company‚Äôs health care business creating a stand-alone, publicly traded health care company. Robert E. Abernathy, would become chief executive officer of the new company. In May 2014, Kimberly-Clark announced that the Form 10 for the spin-off plan had been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and that the new company, Halyard Health, would be headquartered in Alpharetta, Georgia. The spin-off was scheduled to come into effect on October 31, 2014. At that time Halyard Health applied to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \\"HYH.\\" One hundred percent of the shares of Halyard Health would be distributed to Kimberly-Clark shareholders, one share for every eight shares of Kimberly-Clark stock. On November 3, 2014, Halyard debuted as a public company following the spin-off, and began trading on the NYSE under the symbol \\"HYH.\\" =Sale of Surgical and Infection Prevention Business= On November 1, 2017, Halyard announced it entered into a definitive agreement with Owens & Minor, Inc. to sell its Surgical and Infection Prevention business for $710 million.http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171101005846/en/Owens-Minor- Acquire-Halyard-Health-Inc.%E2%80%99s-Surgical On May 1, 2018, HALYARD Surgical & Infection Prevention business officially became part of Owens & Minor.

On June 27, 2018, the former Halyard medical device business was rebranded as Avanos Medical, Inc.https://www.massdevice.com/halyard-health-to- rebrand-as-avanos-medical/ Products * Face masks * Sterilization wrap * Facial protection * Exam gloves * Protective apparel * Surgical drapes * Surgical gowns Lawsuit The infection protection Microcool gowns manufactured by Halyard are at the center of a fraud lawsuit against Halyard Health and Kimberly-Clark and profiled on the newsmagazine 60 Minutes. The lawsuit alleges that Halyard knowingly sold Microcool gowns which failed to meet industry standard specifications and could potentially expose medical workers to the patient's bodily fluids. The company denies the allegations and asserts that the gowns which failed to meet specifications were outliers, and that no health care worker has been infected as a result of defective products. Headquarters/campus Halyard's campus is located in Alpharetta, Georgia, just north of Atlanta. Awards In 2013 and 2014, Halyard was named a winner of the Practice Greenhealth Champion for Change Awards, recognizing the company's ongoing commitment to sustainability accomplishments in support of people, the planet and products. Halyard was awarded Innovative Technology Designation for Coolief Cooled Radiofrequency Treatment at Novation Expo 2015. Community Since Kimberly-Clark's original grant to help launch MedShare in 1998, the company has funded the shipment of $18.5 million worth of supplies to 13 countries in Latin America. Since then, Halyard examination gloves have been on every MedShare shipment and Halyard continues to be one of MedShare‚Äôs largest medical product donors. In 2015 Halyard donated $400,000 in medical supplies to MedShare for April 2015 Nepal earthquake relief efforts including surgical gowns, protective masks, and examination gloves.

Jenal received international acclaim through his discovery of a new pathway, which is based on a new cyclic di-nucleotide (c-di-GMP) and which coordinates the formation of microbial biofilms and contributes to the development of chronic bacterial infections. With the model bacterium Caulobacter crescentus, Jenal discovered that c-di-GMP controls the transition from motile bacteria to a sedentary biofilm-forming structure and this process coordinates the replication cycle of the cells.

His numerous public talks, media interviews, and online presentations on the topic led to the award in 2017 by the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University Louise Richardson of a prize for public engagement with research. He subsequently composed music in ancient Greek style to accompany a series of performances of Euripides' play Alcestis (438 BC) staged in the Greek theatre at Bradfield College in June 2019, and his research has inspired other stage performances including that of Euripides' Herakles at Barnard College, Columbia in 2019.

Two of their records, \\"Highway Code\\" and \\"Weather Forecast,\\" both produced by George Martin, reached the UK singles chart in 1966. History The original setting of the Highway Code as a psalm chant was devised by John Horrex, a teacher at Abingdon School, in the late 1950s. He performed it with various friends at local church and school social events for several years. In 1963, to celebrate the school's tercentenary, Horrex with three other teachers ‚Äì George Pratt, Geoff Keating and Barry Montague ‚Äì made a private recording of the Highway Code in several different styles.

It was released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and PlayStation 4 in August 2015, and the PlayStation Vita in January 2016. The game uses stealth mechanics inspired by Metal Gear Solid series, allowing the player to plan courses of action to work through levels without being detected by guards, dogs, and automated security turrets to reach specific objectives. In addition to the game's levels, Volume supports user-made levels that can be shared with others. The game presents a modern take on the Robin Hood legend, where a young thief discovers a plot for a military coup involving various heists, and uses a device called \\"Volume\\", with the assistance of its artificial intelligence to perform these heists in a virtual manner and broadcasting them to the world at large to make the coup known. The story is presented with the help of voice actors Charlie McDonnell, Danny Wallace, Dan Bull, Jim Sterling, and Andy Serkis.  Plot  Volumes story is based on a modern take of the Robin Hood legend. Robert Locksley (voiced by Charlie McDonnell) is a petty thief that finds a device called \\"Volume\\", which allows the user to simulate heists that is part of a secret military coup attempt. The device has an artificial intelligence built into it named Alan (Danny Wallace) that acts as \\"the Microsoft Office paperclip as a military training program\\", according to Bithell, and guides Robert on how to use the device. Robert decides to use the device to broadcast the simulations of high-profile crimes across the Internet in the same manner as Let's Play videos. Locksley eventually faces off against Guy of Gisbourne (Andy Serkis), re-envisioned for the game as the CEO of a company that has taken over the country of England and runs the nation as a corporatocracy. It is hinted in-game that Volume is set in the same timeline as that of Thomas Was Alone, also developed by Mike Bithell, but set after the events of that game.  Gameplay  Volumes approach is similar to the Metal Gear series, in this case, showing the player as Robert (bottom center) in virtual heist against guards (knightlike figures) and their current cones of vision. Volumes gameplay has been designed by Bithell similar to the stealth elements of the Metal Gear Solid series. The game is presented in a top-down third-person view of the Volume simulation, showing a floor layout, Robert's avatar, and several guards and other antagonists that patrol the area. Several different variety of guards exist, each of which have different patterns of movement and how they respond to seeing the player character; such guards include archers that have a long range of vision, rogues that can see in a full circle around them, dogs that work by sense of smell and track the player by proximity, and automated turrets that react much faster than other guards. When spotted, the player has a short amount of time to attempt to break the line of sight and take cover, otherwise the simulation will restart, either fully or at the most recent checkpoint that the player has crossed. Guards behave in established patterns, and the player can disrupt these by making noise, such as flushing a toilet, or purposely cross their line of sight to draw them away from a patrol route. The player is unable to kill these foes, but over the course of the story, gain an arsenal of tools to distract them and avoid detection; once the player has one or more such tools, they can create a loadout for their character to select which gadgets they wish to take into a level. The goal is to sneak through the level without being spotted to complete various heists. En route, the player needs to collect gems that are scattered through the level before the exit point will become available. Players can track global leaderboards based on how fast they completed a level, with the game allowing players to revisit earlier levels to improve their times. The game contains 100 story-based levels. Additionally, the game includes a level editor, allowing users to create their own simulated missions. Players are required to complete their own levels before uploading them to be shared with others.  Development and release  Bithell's inspiration for Volume was directly from his earlier enjoyment of playing the Metal Gear games since he was a teenager. Though several other stealth games have come out since then, Bithell felt the newer games lost the \\"purity\\" of the stealth experience that Metal Gear provided. The user-generation aspects for Volume were inspired by The Document of Metal Gear Solid 2 that was on the Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance disc, during which Metal Gears game designer, Hideo Kojima, designed prototypes of levels in real-life using Lego bricks. Bithell designed the in-game level editor to work similar to Lego, allowing the player to snap-in predesigned elements onto new or existing levels, including the game's core levels. Bithell hopes that Volume would have an active user-community that will continue to evolve the game over many years, similar to that of Vampire: The Masquerade ‚Äì Bloodlines where the player community has continued to work on improving the game five years after release. Bithell expected that Volume would still have a limited budget, compared to the he needed for Thomas Was Alone, but the extra funding has been used to hire additional programming help and 3D modelers. On the New Year of 2014, Bithell had to be taken to a hospital due to overworking himself on Volume. Following his treatment, he opted to bring on more staff to help complete the more ambitious title, with a 15-man team by the game's completion. Some included his former colleagues at Blitz Games, where he had worked during the development of Thomas Was Alone, and additional help came from members of Curve Digital, who had previously ported Thomas to the PlayStation platforms. David Housden, who composed the Thomas soundtrack, would also create the music for Volume. Bithell announced the game in August 2013, using a carefully managed approach to assure the news was widely disseminated on a specific day, promising further announcements on its voice cast and story at future gaming conventions. Volume was originally planned to be a timed exclusive for the PlayStation 4 and Vita platform sometime in 2015, with the Windows and OSX releases set a month later. Later, the release was set to be simultaneous across all platforms on 18 August 2015; while the PlayStation 4, Windows, and OS X versions were released on this day, Bithell stated that the Vita version was delayed by a few weeks to better refine the title. Bithell later confirmed that the game would be released as a CrossBuy title for the Vita in January 2016, the additional time used to polish the game based on player feedback. The Vita version was released on 6 January 2016. Limited Run Games published a limited edition physical release of the game: PS Vita version on 11 November 2016, and PS4 version on 4 May 2018. Bithell had already worked with Danny Wallace from Thomas Was Alone. For the role of Gisborne, Bithell had listed Andy Serkis high on his list of desired actors. Serkis has responded positively to Bithell's script, and they were able to arrange for his voice acting between Serkis' busy schedule. Bithell contends that Serkis brought \\"a great amount of gravitas\\" to the character to help flesh out the game. With Serkis' involvement, Bithell changed the character of Gisborne to better suit Serkis' acting style, making the character more fiendish than an evil genius. A free expansion, Volume: Coda, has been announced to be released in 2016 alongside Sony's PlayStation VR unit. It includes 30 additional levels, and enables the game to be played on the VR unit, though it is not required. The new levels extend the game's story, following the trials of \\"The Troubleshooter\\", a person that was captured by the government forces after the actions of Locksley in the main story, and includes new voice actors for additional characters.  Reception  Volume received mostly positive reviews. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the Microsoft Windows version 78.40% based on 21 reviews and 80/100 based on 33 reviews and the PlayStation 4 version 71.67% based on 12 reviews and 71/100 based on 15 reviews.

It was built in 1900 and is now a Grade II listed building, once again used as a caf√©.Taylor The facade puns on two meanings of \\"turkey\\", with a vaguely Eastern exotic style of architecture and three large turkey birds on the facade, one sculpted on each side of the ground floor shopfront and another forming a large coloured panel of Royal Doulton tiles right at the top.Farquhar, p. 5 History The site of the Turkey Cafe was owned by James Wesley, a grocer and confectioner, from 1877 to 1899. Wesley sold the site to architect Arthur Wakerley, a well-known Leicester architect who was also a prominent supporter of the Temperance Movement. Upon completion he leased it to John Winn, who owned a number of other cafes in Manchester and the Oriental Cafe in Leicester. The offices of Wakerley's architectural practice were above Winn's Oriental Cafe, making it easy to negotiate a deal regarding the construction and occupancy of a new cafe on Granby Street. Wakerley approached the Royal Doulton Company for help constructing his design for the new \\"Turkey Cafe\\".Farquhar 1987, pp. 3‚Äì4 One of the shopfront turkeys The style of the Turkey Cafe reflected what was popular at that time, which was the new trend of art nouveau. The building created a sense of stability by visually implying a pyramid structure. This was done by having seven arches on the ground floor and then decreasing the number of arches on each level. The pyramid is completed with a single turkey located at the top of the building. The building was coloured blue, green, and buff, which allowed any onlooker to fully appreciate the shapes and curves of the building's designs.Farquhar 1987, p. 4 The facade was constructed using tiles, hollow blocks, and a type of white architectural terracotta called carraraware. The Doultons actually developed carraraware in 1888, which is a matt-glazed stoneware. The carraware tiles of this frontage were handmade by William Neatby, a ceramic artist who worked for the Doultons.Taylor 1997 In addition to these features, art nouveau can be found in the decorations etched into the front window, as well as the red and green art nouveau designs of the rear tea room windows.Farquhar 1987, p. 4 The Turkey Cafe was opened in September 1901 and was later renumbered 24 Granby Street. As a tea room, the cafe was popular with women. Not only was it a respectable venue for gathering, but it provided a convenient meeting place to discuss the progress of women's rights.Taylor 1997 However, the cafe was not designed with only women in mind. Located in the back of the cafe was the Smoke Room. This room with its dark interior provided a place for men to gather and converse as well. The popularity of the cafe rose so high that in 1911 Winn expanded into the building next door, which used to be William Wheeler Kendall's \\"Umbrella Manufacturer and Can Stick Merchant.\\" This change allowed Winn to expand the restaurant and storage space, and add a billiard room.Farquhar 1987, pp. 6‚Äì7 Further renovations were made in 1927 when Winn decided to modernise the entrance, making the front appear more art deco than art nouveau. Wakerley allowed the changes, as long as Winn restored the shop to its original appearance once the lease was done. Unfortunately, when Winn's family sold the Turkey Cafe to Brucciani Bakers Ltd. in 1963, no restoration actually occurred. Under the Brucciani family, the Turkey cafe became a coffee and ice- cream shop. The reputation of the cafe as a location for woman to gather continued, and in 1966 the cafe had a \\"Ladies Only\\" room. But after the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 came into law, they could no longer prohibit men from entering. In 1968, the cafe was once again renovated. The result was a mixture of old and new. The original interior tiled walls were panelled over, a tiled mural of a turkey was added, and smaller windows were inserted.Farquhar 1987, pp. 7‚Äì8 The Turkey Cafe underwent yet another renovation process after Rayner Opticians Ltd. purchased the property in 1982. The interior was altered greatly to accommodate the new business that it would house, and curved windows were added to the above stories. However, the etched glass windows on the ground floor and the front arch were kept and restored to their original condition.Farquhar 1987, pp. 8‚Äì9 Rayners tracked down the Hathernware Ceramics Ltd. of Loughborough who was the only firm experienced in using the terra cotta material needed for restoration.Midlands Heritage website The opticians were also fortunate enough to have the original architectural drawings and a 1910 photograph, which architects Sawday and Moffat had in their archives. Rayners then commissioned Deardon Briggs Designs Ltd. to follow these plans for the restoration process and creation of reproductions. In the end, the restoration of the exterior cost over ¬£30,000, with Leicester City Council contributing ¬£5,000.Farquhar 1987, p. 9 For two decades the building served as an optician's office, but in 2014 the building was returned to its original purpose as a cafe during the day and a cocktail bar at night. Now called 1901 - The Turkey Cafe representing the year the building was constructed and many original features have been exposed and restored. rep.Midlands Heritage website The building has also been listed as a grade two building for its art nouveau style architecture, making it clear that the building is of architectural and historic special interest.Taylor 1997 To the people of Leicester, the building certainly is worth preserving and does have an interesting history. The building has served as a cafe, restaurant, meeting place, ice-cream parlour, and unexpectedly an office for opticians. While numerous buildings were destroyed during and after the World Wars, including all of Winn's other cafes, the Turkey Cafe has remained.Taylor 1997 Now, the building has come full circle, standing restored in its original appearance and serving as a cafe. =Gallery of details= File:The Turkey Cafe, Leicester, UK (3).jpgAbove the entrance File:The Turkey Cafe, Leicester, UK (4).jpgLooking up from the entrance File:The Turkey Cafe, Leicester, UK (8529943697).jpgFirst floor File:The Turkey Cafe, Leicester, UK (2).jpgTop storey Notes References *Farquhar, Jean, and Skinner, Joan, The history and architecture of the Turkey Caf√©, Sedgebrook, 1987 *\\"Story\\": \\"The Turkey Cafe\\", in The Story Of Leicester, on Leicester City Council website *\\"The Turkey Cafe, Leicester,\\" , on Midlands Heritage website, 2011 Further reading *Taylor, M.

History  Harley and Woodward's initial scheme was for a four-volume series, each volume to contain several full- length chapters by different authors, all to be published by 1992. This plan was followed for Volumes 1 through 3, but as the scope of the project grew Volume 2 was divided into three physical parts, and Volume 3 into two parts. The growth of Volume 3 to have been larger than the entire series as originally conceived demonstrated how unfeasible the established format would be for what was now planned as the final three volumes, dealing with the modern period. Woodward therefore decided, after much consultation, to turn the volumes into interpretive encyclopedias. In July 2011 it began to be made available online as PDF files.

The critique Ian Patterson of The Guardian comments in his review of Golden Xplosion: \\"Marius Neset, the 25-year-old Norwegian saxophonist who surfaced in the UK last year with Django Bates (his teacher and mentor at Copenhagen's Rhythmic Music Conservatory), not only combines Brecker's power and Jan Garbarek's tonal delicacy, but has a vision that makes all 11 originals on this sensational album feel indispensable, and indispensably connected to each other. Bonuses include an inspired Bates on piano and synths, and the formidable Phronesis rhythm section of bassist Jasper H√∏iby and drummer Anton Eger.\\" In 2012 Neset collaborated with the violinist Adam Ba≈Çdych on the album Imaginary Room within \\"The Baltic Gang\\", including Jacob Karlzon (piano), Lars Danielsson (double bass), Morten Lund (drums) & Verneri Pohjola (trumpet).

As in many other cases, the origin of the ship is unknown, although it is known that she was named Las Caldas and later Milagro. Capture by the First Chilean Navy Squadron On 24 July 1824 Commander Thomas Crosby of the First Chilean Navy Squadron captured the Spanish ships Milagro, (property of Vicente Benito Larriva), San Fernando and Resoluci√≥n, during the Blockade of Callao by the ships of the Freedom Expedition of Per√∫. Milagro was in service for the Chilean Navy until Jos√© de San Mart√≠n ordered to return the ship to its owner. But Cochrane stopped the frigate until the full payment of $5,000 for the prize. Later she was renamed Monteagudo and was commissioned by the Peruvian Navy. Career in the Peruvian Navy Monteagudo was used as transporter for the troops of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. In 1836 Andr√©s de Santa Cruz created the Peru-Bolivian Confederation and challenged the status quo in South America. Allegedly due to exhausted finances, the ships of the Peruvian Navy Monteagudo and the brig Orbegoso (as well as the corvette Libertad) were advertised on 4 May 1836 in \\"El Redactor Peruano\\", N¬∫ 54, a Lima newspaper, and chartered in a dubious operation to unknown ship brokers. They handed over the ships to Ramon Freire, a Chilean exiled head of state in Lima who pretended his return to the presidency of Chile. He was also furnished with men, arms, and ammunition in a conjoint scheme of General Orbegoso and Santa Cruz against the existing administration of Chile. Ramon Freire's Expedition to Chile On 3 July 1836 sailed bound to Chilo√© the brigantine Orbegoso under the command of Freire, and on 7 July Monteagudo under the command of Puga. During the voyage, Monteagudo crew rose against Freire's partizans on board and proceeded to Valpara√≠so to deliver the ship and the prisoners to the Chilean authorities. Freire on Orbegoso, ignorant of what had happened, continued the route to Chilo√© where the authorities surrendered to Freire without resistance. The Chilean government had been informed about the plot, and Diego Portales, defense minister of the government ordered Monteagudo manned with loyal crew and troops to Chilo√©. As she arrived, Freire, assuming the ship was still under the command of Puga, ordered Puga to land with his men. This was executed and thus admitted into the fort. The troops of the fort, informed of the situation returned to the Chilean authorities and Freire was arrested. Simultaneously to the capture of Freire in Chilo√©, Portales ordered and to capture the naval ships of the Peru- Bolivian Confederation anchored in Callao, without a declaration of war. They captured on 21 August 1836 the ships Santa Cruz, the brig Arequipe√±o and the schooner Peruviana. The War of the Confederation On 30 August 1836 the Chilean plenipotentiary Mariano Ega√±a arrived to Callao with the ships Monteagudo, Colo Colo, Valpara√≠so, Aquiles, and Orgeboso to negotiate a treaty based on several points: the payments of the outstanding international debts owed by Peru to Chile, the limitation of the outstanding armies, commercial agreements, compensation to Chile for the Freire Expedition, and the dissolution of the Confederation. Santa Cruz agreed to everything but the dissolution. Chile responded by declaring war on 28 December 1836. Monteagudo participated in the Battle of Islay, The result was mostly a stalemate that did not affect the course of the war. She sunk in a gale off Valparaiso on 24 July 1839. Her crew were rescued.

Bugil Academy(Bugil High School) is one of the most selective and prestigious boarding schools in Korea, renowned for its high academic levels and successful college admission results. Bugil Academy selects half of the students per grade nationwide, and its admissions process is competitive. The school requires prospective students to show academic well-roundedness and other various qualities. Established in 1975, the school is financed by the Hanhwa Group, one of the largest Business conglomerates in Korea.  Traditions  = Cherry Blossom Festival = Bugil Academy is famous for its cherry blossoms that fill the wide campus every spring.http://www.naeil.com/news/Local_ViewNews_n.asp?bulyooid=5&nnum;=708607 Its reputation has even led the Korean indie band Busker Busker to write a popular song \\"Cherry Blossom Ending\\". The Cherry Blossom festival is held usually in mid-April when blossoms reach their peak. Since 1976, it has grown to become a festival for the entire Cheonan city and annually attracts hundreds of visitors. The festival is even more famous for the fireworks on the last night. In 2010, the school spent nearly $300,000 on fireworks for commemorating the 25th anniversary of the school's establishment. Unlike what many think, the school's official flower is not cherry blossom but Korean Forsythia. = Strict Discipline = Strict discipline defines the educational style of Bugil Academy. It is based on strong military-style traditions that includes military salute and trainings. As a result, the school is often criticized for being overly stringent, conservative and anachronistic.http://www.naeil.com/news/Local_ViewNews_n.asp?bulyooid=1&nnum;=618725 Whether this discipline helped or not, Bugil Academy has had the highest number of students accepted to Korea Military Academy, Korea Naval Academy and Korea Air Force Academy for many years. = Baseball Team = Bugil Baseball Team is one of the strongest teams in the Korean High Schools' League.http://www.bugil.hs.kr/eng/about/baseball.jspdate=August 2013 Closely related to the professional Korea League team Hanhwa Eagles, it has achieved notable successes in a wide variety of competitions. Since 1978, it has won 23 championships 15 runners-up and 21 third-bests. Some of the respected players who graduated from Bugil Academy are Kim Tae-kyun, Yoon Hyung-bae and Na Ju- hwan.  Global Leader Program  Bugil Academy's Global Leader Program (GLP) is a \\"school within a school\\". The GLP comprises students in the three grades (10-12) of class #12 - students from classes #1~#11 are separate and belong to the Boys' School. Only the GLP is co-educational and has its own specialized American curriculum, whereas classes #1~#11 are form the all-boys school and follow the Korean curriculum. GLP's structure and curriculum are completely different from the rest of the Bugil Academy. Much more selective and specialized, the GLP currently has a maximum enrollment of 90 students: 30 seniors, 30 juniors and 30 sophomores. Despite the overwhelming success of the program in placing students in top-tier American and British universities, the program is to be closed after the 2020 school year (ending in January 2021) due to a discontinuation of funding from the Hanhwa Corp.. = Academics = Featuring a challenging Advanced Placement-oriented curriculum taught in English-only classes, the GLP provides preparation for Korean students to primarily top-tier universities in the United States and the United Kingdom, but also Japan and Hong Kong. The school intends its students to develop their own unique color and character through their experiences at Bugil Academy which will help them to stand out among the increasing number of Korean applicants. Each student takes seven courses including a Directed Research Project (DRP), an individualized, independent graduation research project on his or her topic of interest. The GLP has a 6:1 student teacher ratio, and each student is assigned one teacher as his or her mentor, thus helping new incoming students to seamlessly assimilate into the school community. The school believes that its academic environment enhances time management skills, diligence, and self-reliance. Since its opening, the GLP has had faculty members with diverse nationalities including the United States, Ecuador, Switzerland, and China. The AP average for 2015 was the highest in school history: 4.6. = Exchange programs = Bugil Academy GLP pariticpates in numerous exchange programs with many different schools worldwide. Schools involved in the exchange program with Bugil include Hwa Chong Institution in Singapore, Westlake High School (Texas) and Townview Magnet Center. The GLP students are also annually invited to several international events such as Asia-Pacific Youth Leaders' Summit (APYLS) by Hwa Chong Institution, Dominion International Young Leaders' Summit (DIYLS) by Dominion High School and International Young Leaders' Forum (IYLF). Through the international conference experiences, students learn to thrive in foreign environments amongst students who come from diverse backgrounds. = Residential Life = All GLP students must reside in the school dormitory for all three years. Constructed in 1976 and renovated in 2009, Summit Hall has six classrooms, one library with 9,000 volumes (the biggest English library for secondary schools in Korea), student activity room, and a music room. The dormitory for male students is located next to the front gate. Female students share the dormitory building with the Bugil Girls' High School. Both dormitories have dorm parents who inspect students on a regular basis; all students wake up at 6:40 a.m. and attend classes until 4:20 p.m. Mandatory study hours are from 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 pm., and from then to 1:00 a.m., students are free to do independent study and work on individual homework, team projects, or any academic activity that suits their needs and interests. = Extracurricular = The GLP has its own extracurricular programs separate from the rest of Bugil Academy. It has a vibrant journalism culture through the student-run weekly newspaper The Headline, which publishes weekly editions to update the school community regarding ongoing events. It also has activities with respect to public speaking, debate, Model United Nations, and stage performance. Many of the students have exhibited great achievements in competitions such as World Individual Debating and Public Speaking Championships, National Forensic League and several Model Congress and Model United Nations conferences. In terms of sports, the newly formed lacrosse team has grown quickly to win a championship in the sophomore division of the National tournament. Some other unique extracurricular includes the volunteering club Interact and Three Cups of Tea, a club for tea mania to socialize and discuss. = Admissions = The GLP selects 30 students per grade nationwide, and its admissions process is highly competitive. The school demands prospective students to show academic well-roundedness and other various qualities. It also demands students to show high English proficiency that would allow them to study in the GLP's English- only curriculum. An interesting factor is that the GLP is under a coed system and nearly half of the admitted students are girls, despite the fact that Bugil Academy as a whole is a boys' school. This shows the success of the \\"school within a school\\" concept on which the GLP is built. = College Entrance = In February 2013, the GLP's first graduates attended their graduation ceremony. 23 graduates were accepted to top-tier schools in the United States, France and Japan. = School Closing = The GLP admitted its final class of students in March 2018. This class will graduate after the 2020 school year, which ends in January 2021. The program will then shut down as the Hanhwa Group will no longer fund the GLP.

In England, an asset of community value (ACV) is land or property of importance to a local community which is subject to additional protection from development under the Localism Act 2011. Voluntary and community organisations can nominate an asset to be included on their local authority's register of asset of community value. Criteria Under the terms of the legislation, registration as an asset of community value covers three aspects: *Material planning consideration: ACV status is a material consideration in a planning application and can be used by the local planning authority and Planning Inspectorate as a factor in refusing planning permission for full or partial change of use or demolition; *Community right to bid: this allows an ACV to be purchased by a group representing its users or the local community; *Compulsory purchase rights: an ACV-registered building can be compulsorily purchased by the local authority or council \\"if the asset is under threat of long-term loss to the community\\". Restrictions The owner of an asset of community value must inform the local authority if they wish to sell the asset. If a qualifying community group wants to buy the asset, they can trigger a moratorium for six months, to give them a chance to raise the money to purchase the asset. The owner does not have to sell to a community group. The asset of community value listing only improves the chances of community groups being able to purchase by providing more time to raise funds. It does not require the owner to sell at a discount. The listing of a property as an 'Asset of Community Value' lasts for five years after which it is automatically delisted and the restrictions imposed by the covenant are removed. Communities can however apply for the listing to be renewed. Care should be taken to ensure the listing is continuous- apply for renewal not less than 8 weeks before the original listing ends. Between 6th March 2015 and 22nd May 2017 there was special protection in place protecting ACV listed or nominated pubs from a change of use or demolition under the 'Permitted Development' rules in the General Permitted Development Order. From 23rd May 2017 onwards this protection is extended to all pubs regardless of their ACV status, under the Amendment to the GPDO (SI 2017/619).This means that any change of use or demolition (apart from changing the way a pub operates to include greater dining use, and back again to a solely drinking establishment) now requires full planning permission. Numbers By late 2015, of about 860 pubs across the country which had registered as ACVs, twelve had been acquired by groups under the Community Right to Bid and none had been purchased under compulsory purchase powers, although in 2015 there were two cases where the latter was being investigated; in 2018 there are currently about 6 pub CPO actions being considered or underway. The largest group of listings have been for pubs, with over one hundred listed by August 2013 and six hundred by March 2015.

It is located on the southern outskirts of Prague, in the administrational district of Velk√° Chuchle. Races are held there from April to mid-November. The track measures 2180m in length.  General Information  The Praha-Velk√° Chuchle racetrack is the center of premier horse racing in the Czech Republic. It hosts more races than any other Czech racecourse, and its hosted races include the three most prestigious flat races in the country; the Czech Derby, the Czech St Leger, and the Czech 2000 Guineas. These three races make up the Czech Triple Crown of flat racing, which only seven horses have accomplished in the history of the Czech Republic. The latest, as of 2013, to have done so is the Polish thoroughbred Age of Jape. Emblem of the administrational district Velk√° Chuchle, the horseshoes demonstrate the importance of the racecourse to the surrounding areas  History  = 1906-1937 = The B√∂hmischer Rennverein, a Czech horse racing club, campaigned to set up a new horse racecourse in the Prague area. The club was very prestigious; its members included the Archduke Karl Franz Josef, the Governor Earl Karl Coudenhove, and the Lord Mayor of Prague, Dr Karel Gro≈°. This track was located at the Prague Indalidovna, and racing began there from the 1860s. A track was shortly later set up at C√≠sarsk√° louka (the Imperial Meadows). Kincsem, widely recognized as one of the most successful horses of all time, won three times at this racetrack. However, the 1890s brought flooding that destroyed the track. After the river was regulated to reduce risk of flooding, racing at C√≠sarsk√° louka ended when the area of the island it was located on decreased. Statue of Kincsem, who won three times at Velk√° Chuchle, and is widely considered the one of the greatest racehorses of all time A racetrack at Karlovy Vary was opened in 1899, but it was decided by the Rennverein that this was not near enough to Prague, which was the desired centre of racing in the Czech Republic. Funded by the Rennverein,the construction of a very modern racetrack began in 1899 on land rented at Velk√° Chuchle. On September 28, 1906, the track was unveiled. The very first horse to win at the track was the mare Vision, ridden by her owner, veterinarian Francis Bartosch, during the Opening Stakes. The racetrack was made popular by the various famous jockeys of the time that participated there. These included the Velk√° Pardubick√° winners Slinn (1901), Buckenham (1899, 1900, 1904) and Ultirck Ros√°k (1902,1903). The racetrack hosted important English racing personalities such as trainer John Reeves and jockey Walter Earl, the presence of which brought importance to Prague, given that the capital city was at that time Vienna. Although the press raved of the opening day at Velk√° Chuchle, the track remained relatively unknown. Indeed, the only race of great importance held there between 1906 and 1914 was the annual Velk√° pra≈æsk√° steeplechase. On May 13, 1911, racetrack engineer Jan Kaspar landed his airplane Bl√©riot XI on the racetrack. This was the first ever long-hail flight between Pardubice and Prague. This was an event that helped put the racetrack on the map. The First World War marked the first time that operations at the racecourse were abandoned, and remains the only time for this to happen. The track itself was so devastated that there was little indication that any post-war regeneration of racing would occur. On 28 March 1919, a meeting of ex-B√∂hmischer Rennverein members and other racing enthusiasts were organized at the hotel Sask√Ω dv≈Ør, in Prague. There, they founded the Czechoslovak Jockey Club, which adopted the control of the horse racing community of the newly established Czechoslovakian Republic.http://www.velka-chuchle.cz/userfiles/file/Prezentace2013AJ.pdf On 15 March 1920, the first races of the season were held during a 6-day Spring meeting. There, horses owned by the most influential and powerful people in the horse racing community, from the most successful stables, raced. The main race, a 1600m event with 20.000 crowns of prize money, was won by the four- year-old Kongo, ridden by Ker√©sz and owned by Oskar Kunz, in a time of 1 minute and 42 seconds. Following the success of the Spring meeting, the event was repeated in August and later again in Autumn. Eighty foreign horses were transferred to Czech stables, and many foreigners visited the racetrack, enticed by the strong exchange rates of their currencies against the crown. Starting in 1927, various forms of modern technology were implemented at the racecourse. First, electric lighting was installed in the entire grandstand and the weighing room. Then, in 1930, the Australian starting machine, which had made its way into all American and Australian racetracks, made its debut at Velk√° Chuchle. In this year, Jaroslav Houra won the jockey's championship and two years later, at 19, he won the Czechoslovak Derby, remaining to this day the youngest jockey to ever win this title. In 1931, the Czechoslovak Derby was hosted on 17 May, and it had clearly become the most significant flat racing day of the year, drawing the spectatorship of even the president of the Czechoslovak Republic. In 1937, the Czechoslovak Jockey Club rented the entire grounds until 1948. = 1938-1979 = The 1939 season began with a 50% increase in funding, and new horses being imported form the west. An otherwise optimistic start to the season was interrupted by the Munich Accord, and The Czechoslovak Derby was renamed the Bohemian-Moravian Derby, and from 1940 onwards the Bohemian-Moravian Blue Band. The Nazi's was a reign of terror; Jews were banned from entering the racecourse and were prevented from owning stables. Germans also took leading positions at the jockey club and the Nazis systematically eliminated Czechs from positions of power. However, racing at Velk√° Chuchle did continue. Several horses were very successful throughout the years of the war. These included Simonel, the third winner of the Bohemian- Moravian Blue Band, and Cyklon, who ran 86 times in Prague, Karlovy Vary, and Vienna throughout his career. Cyklon won a total of 1,076,500 crowns of prize money between the ages of 2 and 8. In 1942, the chestnut stallion Lionel took the racetrack at Velk√° Chuchle by storm. He won 25 races out of 36 during his 5-year career. His career winnings totaled 1,393,600 crowns, 5 times more than his purchase price as a yearling. From May 1945, firefights sprang up between the Prague Uprising and the retreating German soldiers at Velk√° Chuchle and other surrounding villages. On 7 May, German troops occupied Velk√° Chuchle, and some of the 200 horses kept there were transported to municipal stables. On 9 May, when Prague was finally celebrating its liberation, Germans troops shot at a munitions train at Velk√° Chuchle station, which caught fire and set the surrounding area and the wooden stables alight. Three horses died, including the beloved Cyklon. Private stables began to be nationalized in 1949 and soon after private horse auctions were suspended. The Ministry of Agriculture set up an organization tasked with distributing yearlings to several state-owned stables. In 1950, in the aftermath of the Second World War, Czechoslovakian stables fell under federal control, and private bookmakers vanished. Furthermore, racing was subsidized federally.http://www.velka-chuchle.cz/en/tickets-and-accessability.html With these changes, the Czechoslovak Jockey Club was disbanded, as the Ministry of Agriculture established the Czechoslovak Racing Institution to take up the Club‚Äôs former responsibilities organizing horse racing. After merely three years of existence, the Racing Institution was replaced by St√°tn√≠ z√°vodi≈°te, a different racing organization. This organization would regulate flat racing in the Czechoslovak Republic for the next thirty-seven years. These changes did little to affect Velk√° Chuchle, as top horses were still being produced, ridden and trained by top professionals. The 1950s say two excellent horses dominate Velk√° Chuchle; Symbol and Masis, both Derby winners. Aside from horses, Velk√° Chuchle profited from individuals, namely trainers Jaroslav Houra, Josef Celler, Karel Truhlar, and Franti≈°ek Hule≈°. The elite jockey Karel Havelka dominated the races, and his foreign rivals had to prepare to compete with his riding style. In 1955, Masis won the Czechoslovak Derby at Velk√° Chuchle, setting a new record time. Albeit the first live telecast from Velk√° Chuchle being on 3 June 1962, Velk√° Chuchle was losing its position as the site of premier flat racing in Central Europe. There may have been several reasons for this. First, leading professionals began to leave Velk√° Chuchle, new jockeys and trainers did not have any international experience, the racing facilities had not been cared properly for, and were beginning to be in a bad state, and breeding and training methods were deteriorating in quality. Furthermore, other socialist countries, more populous than Czechoslovakia, such as the Soviet Union, had growing flat racing centers, pushing out Velk√° Chuchle. In 1965, things had begun to go better for Czechoslovak racing, with Myjavan from Mote≈°ice coming within one tenth of a second of Masis' record. = 1971- 2003 = In 1972, an exceptional event transpired at Velk√° Chuchle. First the first time in its history, the Czechoslovak Derby was won by a woman. Indeed, the chestnut Crapom, ridden by Miloslava Hermansdorferov√°, won by a record distance of ten lengths. It may even have been possible fofr Hermansdorferov√° to be the first Derby winner in the world, but she broke her leg in 1969, and could only watch as her horse won the Derby with a different jockey. Unfortunately for Velk√° Chuchle's history, Ina Schwarzk√§chel won the Dutch Derby in 1970, robbing Hermansdorferov√° of this honor. The 1970s were a decade filled with significant events for Velka Chuchle. First, on 8 April 1973, starting boxes were used for the first time at Velk√° Chucle. Then, in 1975, the renowned writer Dick Francis visited the racetrack. The 1975 Derby was significant because it was won for the fifth time by Josef ≈†ach, who was already 55 years old. In 1978, a series of successes of the trainer Franti≈°ek V√≠tek and the jockey Vlastimil Smol√≠k began. Smol√≠k won the flat riders' championship 13 years in a row, which brought the time during which he rode to be dubbed the Age of Smol√≠k. while V√≠tek's horses won for fourteen years in a row, with the exception of in 1986. On 26 May 1976, the stallion Masis was put to sleep, and, one year later, La Legion gave birth to his foal at Napajedla. The foal was named Latina, and she was ridden by Smol√≠k, becoming his sixth Derby winning horse. The 1985 Czechoslovak Derby was the last race to be spectated from the old stands. Shortly after the Derby, the old stands were torn down, and construction of the current grandstand began. The Velvet Revolution of 1989 brought with it new socioeconomic conditions to be adapted to by the racetrack. The state of racing had always been an indicator of the nation's progress. For example, the racetrack, which had never lacked for funding under the communist regime, now saw itself at a lack of money. Thus, the financials behind the improvement of the racecourse became problematic. It was therefore difficult to predict future developments as the funding was not always available. While the new grandstand was being built at Velk√° Chuchle, racing transferred to West Bohemian racecourse at Karlovy Vary. At the beginning of the 1991 season, racing returned to Velk√° Chuchle, and, in the same year, Vlastimil Smol√≠k won the Czechoslovak Derby for the sixth time, riding Lykeion, setting a new record. In May of the 1991 season, the financial situation turned dire: the racecourse was in debt and stopped functioning. The organization of horse racing at Velk√° Chuchle turned over to the Association of Professional Trainers, Riders and Grooms, who, thankfully, secured funding from the Fund to Rescue Horse Racing. The Union of Czechoslovak Flat Racing organized the second half of the 1991 season. Plans to privatize some operations at the racecourse were elaborated, but the Ministry of Agriculture made an inspection of the racecourse, and after finding it in a desolate state questioned who would seek to privatize such a racecourse. Velk√° Chuchle's well kept records allowed it access to European racing organizations and authorities without any problems. The victory of the French-bred Ajanta at the first classic race in the new Czech Republic demonstrated that the purchases of quality horses from Western European auctions would play a significant role in racing at Velk√° Chuchle in the next years. By 1995, the organizer of racing at Velk√° Chucle had become insolvent, and the management of Czech flat racing took the decision to transfer racing from Velk√° Chuchle to racecourses elsewhere in the Czech Republic. The Czech Derby was hosted at Karlovy Vary, and its winner, Regulus, the last Czech-bred horse to win the Derby, won by a record 15 lengths. In Autumn of 1995, racing returned to Velk√° Chuchle. The troubles plaguing the racecourse since the fall of the Berlin Wall had been solved one by one. In 1996, Skanska adopted control of racing at Velk√° Chuchle, providing a guarantee of stability. Famous South African jockey Michael Roberts visited the track for the 1997 Czech Derby, and rode two winners. In November 2001, the Jockey Club of the Czech Republic, the highest racing authority in the country, with support from various investors, bought the facilities at the Velka Chuchle racecourse. A daughter company, TMM (Turf Management and Marketing), was established, and has been organizing racing at the Prague-Velk√° Chuchle Racecourse since. A recent flat race at Velk√° Chuchle  2002 Floods http://www.velka-chuchle.cz/en/floods-2002.html  In the week starting 12 August, extensive flooding of the Vltava and Berounka rivers wreaked havoc at the racecourse. Having survived smaller floods, two world wars, and stables fires, the racecourse was accustomed to, and prepared for, such natural and manmade disasters. However, the flooding of 2002 outdid all previous disasters in the damage that it caused to the racecourse. Fortunately, all horses kept at the racecourse were able to be safely transported to several other racecourses. When the water level fell, the exact extent of the damages to the racecourse appeared for the first time, and unfortunately exceeded even the most pessimistic expectations. For the 2002 race season to proceed, all scheduled races had to have been moved to other racecourses in the Czech Republic. The main racing authority in the country, the Czech Jockey Club, had to be relocated from its offices in the grandstand of the racecourse to other offices. In Spring of 2003, the racecourse was reopened. = 2013 Floods http://www.velka-chuchle.cz/en/floods-2013.html = In June 2013, the racecourse was again completely submerged in muddy water from predominantly the Berounka, which runs into the Vltava near the racecourse. Again, all horses were safely transported off the premises before the track was flooded. The flood was not as destructive as the 2002 one was, but the track was nonetheless rendered useless for several months. Reconstructions began, and the first race, a trotters race, was held on 28 July. The Czech St Leger, an important flat race, was delayed by merely one week, impressive considering the extent of the damages. Furthermore, the Czech Derby, the most significant Czech flat race of the year, was hastily relocated to the Most racecourse.  General Information & Statistics  The racecourse has a capacity for 4000 seated, 10000 standing and 800 VIPs. There is complete internal television circuit, including production studio, BOSE surround sound systems in VIP lounges, lighting and projection equipment for the racetrack, Direct Internet connection - 8 x 2Mb, with wifi projection equipment, and IPTV (internet television) channel on television for the subscribed 10 000 people.  Other Events Held at the Racecourse  The track has been used for events other than horse racing. Events held at the racecourse include country music festivals, rock music festivals, children's days, and carnivals. Furthermore, the facilities are available to companies to host their corporate events, include teambuilding and training. During the winter months, when no horse racing is being held, the racecourse is transformed into a ski park for cross- country skiing, called Ski Park Velk√° Chuchle.  Transport  The grandstand of the racecourse is located 2 minutes by foot from Praha-Velk√° Chuchle train station. The station is located 5 minutes by train from Praha Smichov station. Buses are available for transport to and from the racecourse.

Another well- known publication Krayevsky founded (in 1863) was the popular newspaper Golos (The Voice). Biography Andrey Krayevsky was born in Moscow, an illegitimate grandson of the chief of the Moscow police Nikolai Arkharov in whose house he was brought up and received primary education. In 1823 he enrolled at Moscow University, from which he graduated in 1828. After graduation Krayevsky joined Moscow's Governor-General's office. He soon began to write articles and reviews for local publications. In 1831 he moved to St. Petersburg to work in the Ministry of Public Education. While serving in that office, in 1835 he started a newsletter for the ministry. Vladimir Odoyevsky introduced Krayevsky to the Russian capital's literary circles. Pyotr Pletnyov invited him to Sovremennik, first as a technical editor. After Alexander Pushkin's death Krayevsky took part in sorting out of the great poet's archives and became one of five Sovremennik‚Äôs co-publishers. In 1836 Krayevsky introduced Mikhail Lermontov to the Saint Petersburg cultural elite and was his literary mentor for a time. In 1837 Krayevsky started editing Russky Invalid's Literary Supplement, an obscure newspaper he soon transformed into the popular Literaturnaya Gazeta. In 1839 he became the editor and publisher of Otechestvennye Zapiski, a journal he originally took on lease from Pavel Svinyin. With a stellar team of authors and critics (Vladimir Odoyevsky, Evgeny Baratynsky, Vasily Zhukovsky, Alexander Veltman, Pyotr Vyazemsky, Alexey Koltsov, Nikolay Gogol, later ‚Äì Vissarion Belinsky, Alexander Hertzen, Nikolay Nekrasov, Fyodor Dostoyevsky (from 1846), Ivan Turgenev, Ivan Goncharov) in the mid-1840s Krayevsky's OZ became one of the most successful and respected Russian publications. After Belinsky's departure in 1846, Krayevsky was keen on keeping the magazine's high profile, but the change of the political atmosphere in the country forced him to make compromises. An 1848, a pro-monarchist article called \\"Russia and The Western Europe as They Stand Now\\", saw him shifting from the left to the center-right of the Russian literary world's political spectrum. In 1845 Krayevsky began an effort to publish Russian translations of all Sir Walter Scott's novels, but failed to finish this project. Krayevsky was a co-editor of Russky Invalid (1843-1852), Sankt-Peterburgskie Vedomosti (1852-1862, with the circulation rising up to 12,000). In 1863 he founded the highly popular newspaper Golos, its circulation reaching the high point of 23,000. In 1866 he became one of the creators of the first ever Russian Telegraph Agency (RTA). Andrey Krayevsky died on 20 (8, old style) 1889 in Pavlovsk, Saint Petersburg.

It is owned by the State Railway of Thailand and serves the Northern Line. Uttaradit railway station is located from Bangkok railway station. It is also a Class 1 Station and is also the base for many maintenance subdivisions. History The facade of Uttaradit station The platform and sign of Uttaradit station During 1905-1906 King Chulalongkorn planned to build a railway line from Bangkok-Chiang Mai and another from Uttaradit to Ban Krai then across the Mekong River to Luang Prabang. Thus a railway station was built here, and trees were cleared and the land was leveled to await the track-laying process, which happened later in 1907. In 1907, trains hauled rock-filled wagons in which the people saw everyday. A railway station was therefore built in the forest cemetery of Wat Tha Thanon (now known as Uttaradit Station) in 1909 and was finished in 1910. The first Uttaradit Station was built in the Modernist Style of Jugendstil with a tower in the middle, designed and built by German architect Karl Siegfried D√∂hring. However, the tower was torn down during World War II and turned into a bomb shelter for protection against Allied Bombings. Uttaradit station was hit and rebuilt after the war and opened for service once again in 1951. Due to an increase of train traffic, a new station had to be built 2.35 kilometres north and was finished in 1958, it was called Sila At Station. Today Uttaradit Station is kept as an OTOP centre and there have been plans of expanding the station building into a department store.

The party was founded in April 1906, emerging out of the Vozrozhdenie (Renaissance) circles. The Vozrozhdenie was a non-Marxist tendency which was led by the nonmarxist thinker and politician Chaim Zhitlowsky. Zhitlowsky became the theoretician of the new party that advocated with the same emphasis Jewish self-reliance and socialism.Patkin, A. L.

In Germany, AMANN is the market leader in the industrial sector. Internationally, AMANN is among the world's three largest producers. In 2019, the company had a turnover of approximately 200 million euros and employed 2,500 people. Background The company was founded in 1854 by Alois Amann and Imanuel B√∂hringer as Amann & B√∂hringer for the purpose of manufacturing twined and colored silk. At this stage, industrialisation had not yet reached B√∂nnigheim. In the beginning, the products were dyed in Rau in Berg and then returned to B√∂nnigheim, where they were revised and reeled on a winch by 12 employees. The force was generated by two wheel movers, who wearily turned the flywheel. The power of these men became insufficient when the company acquired new machines. Hence, they got replaced by two donkeys (later two oxen), who propelled the whim. In 1856, the company acquired new twisting machines, as well as further machines. The new machines could be propelled by a 4 HP steam engine so that the oxen got replaced. The prosperous company developed fast and turned into a factory. This encouraged the founders to invest in a steam engine with a steam boiler and further modern machines. In 1858, Amann & B√∂hringer already counted 100 employees. By implementing an own dye-house, Alois Amann became a pioneer in processing silk threads in Germany. In a W√ºrttemberg industrial biography that was released in Leipzig in 1879, the company was described as the most important and most powerful silk processing company in Germany. In 1880, the major competitive Augsburg-based factory Payr & Mayer was acquired with its subsidiary in M√∂ssingen and the whole management got relocated to the headquarters in B√∂nnigheim. In 1882, Imanuel B√∂hringer left the company. Alois Amann converted it into a family business and hired his sons Emil and Alfred as associates. Accordingly, the company was renamed into Amann & S√∂hne. Emil Amann conducted experiments with the production of synthetic fibres, however he came to the conclusion that there was nothing equivalent that could replace natural silk, yet. In the 1880s, the company expanded to Northern Italy and opened two factories in Seriate and Telgate. Emil Amann travelled to the furthest European countries in order to increase the turnover of the factories, whereas his father and brother focused on managing the company. During the following years, Alfred Amann did an apprenticeship as a dyer in Lyon, London and Krefeld. He returned to B√∂nnigheim in 1888 and took over the technical director's position. In 1892, Alois Amann died at the age of 68. Henceforth, his sons Emil and Alfred started to lead the company on their own. In 1902, the old factory building in B√∂nnigheim was pulled down and gave space for the construction of a new factory building. Today, the building from 1902 is under monumental protection and is still used as the headquarters of AMANN Group. High-bay warehouse in the central industrial warehouse in Erligheim Since silk, the original product, was gradually being replaced by more modern raw materials, Amann & S√∂hne started to manufacture schappe silk in 1919, and mercerised cotton in 1923. Serafil samples Alfred Amann died in 1942. Alfred Pielenz, his son-in- law, was nominated to become his successor. He guided the company through the last years of war, during which the production stagnated, as well as through the postwar years, during which the production was slowly being reconstructed. In 1955, the B√∂nnigheim-based company pioneered with the production of endless synthetic sewing threads. In 1993/1994, AMANN acquired Ackermann-G√∂ggingen AG, a traditional Augsburg-based company along with its dye-house. Moreover, in 1996 a fully automatic industrial central warehouse was inaugurated in Erligheim. In 2002, AMANN extended its product portfolio and launched a novel specialty program for technical textiles. Hanns A. Pielenz, Alfred Pielenz' son, retired in 2004 after 36 years of being the executive manager. Bodo Th. B√∂lzle was nominated to become his successor. In 2006, the company opened a new production plant in Brasov, Romania. In 2008, Oxley Thread Ltd., one of the most famous European sewing thread manufactures was acquired by AMANN. In 2009, AMANN established a new production plant in Yancheng, China. Furthermore, the company launched a new label including products made of recycled polyester and organic cotton in 2009. In 2013, the company expanded to Bangladesh and opened a new production plant in the capital Dhaka. In 2016, AMANN inaugurated its new R&D; center, the AMANN Innovation Lab, based in Augsburg. In 2017, AMANN inaugurated its Sewing Technology Center, which is based in the AMANN headquarters in B√∂nnigheim. AMANN production site in Yancheng, China Today, AMANN counts approx. 2,150 employees (incl. production plants, subsidiaries and distributors) in more than 100 countries. The management consists of Bodo Th. B√∂lzle, who is also the president of the employer's association \\"S√ºdwesttextil\\" and chairman of the European Federation of Sewing Thread Industries (EFT), along with Wolfgang Findeis and Peter Morgalla. The daily production output amounts to approx. 1 million kilometers of thread. Products The product range comprises, among others, traditional sewing threads for the apparel industry, threads for the automotive industry, and special threads for technical applications. The company is ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certified.  Production sites  The headquarters of AMANN are located in B√∂nnigheim/Erligheim. * B√∂nnigheim (Headquarters) * Erligheim (industrial central warehouse) * Augsburg (production site) AMANN solely produces in own production sites in: * Manchester, United Kingdom * Brasov, Romania * Chribska, Czech Republic * Yancheng, China * Dhaka, Bangladesh Moreover, AMANN has own subsidiaries in 21 countries and sales agencies in more than 100 countries.  Management/Amann family  Alois Amann (03.07.1824 - 28.09.1892) founded the company with Imanuel B√∂hringer (1822 - 1906) and let it until he died in 1892. Emil Amann (01.03.1862 - 30.01.1935) and Alfred Amann (20.09.1863 - 01.02.1942) had already been involved as associates when their father Alois died. Later, they became the sole managers. Whilst Emil Amann retired in 1917, Alfred Amann led the company independently until he died in 1942. Especially Alfred Amann is today considered to be the crucial person in the company's history. He and his wife Jule were known to be important social patrons within their local area. Today's Gymnasium (secondary School) in B√∂nnigheim is named \\"Alfred-Amann-Gymnasium\\". Moreover, there is a path called \\"Alfred-Amann-Weg\\" in B√∂nnigheim, as well as further important buildings and facilities that where established by Alfred Amann and his wife. Alois, Alfred and Emil Amann are honorary citizens of the city of B√∂nnigheim. The son-in-law of Alfred Amann, Alfred Pielenz (05.09.1898 - 12.07.1989), led the company from 1942 till 1968. He was then replaced by his son Hanns A. Pielenz (22.11.1939 - 13.06.2013), who handed over the CEO position to the present CEO, Bodo Th. B√∂lzle, in 2004. Today's management consists of Bodo Th. B√∂lzle, Wolfgang Findeis and Peter Morgalla.

According to news reports in 2013, it is now owned by Qatar media interests, through intermediaries.https://www.aljadid.com/content/will-al- quds-al-arabi-readers-be-treated-al-jazeeras-viewers-june-30th The paper's motto is ( \\"daily, political, independent\\"). Its circulation is estimated to be somewhere between 15,000 and 50,000. From the start until his resignation in July 2013, its editor-in-chief was Abdel Bari Atwan, who was born in a Palestinian refugee camp in the Gaza Strip in 1950. After his resignation in July 2013, Abdel Bari Atwan was followed by Sana Aloul, a London-based Palestinian journalist. The paper publishes many Arab writers. It positions itself as an objective newspaper, covering the latest news and events. Al-Quds Al-Arabi states that its \\"correspondents and writers are biased toward people‚Äôs and human rights issues, including women's, children's and refugees' rights. It rejects sectarianism, violence and discrimination\\". It exposes corruption, violations, racism and practices of oppressive regimes. It advocates for the rights of the Palestinian people and opposes the sanctioned policies of the Israeli occupation. As indicated by its motto, the paper stresses this distinction by emphasizing its independent ownership and viewpoint relative to the other pan-Arab dailies. History Al Quds Al Arabi was founded in 1989 and is based in London. The paper first came to global attention after Atwan traveled to Afghanistan in 1996 to interview Osama bin Laden. Like Al-Jazeera, contacts with terrorist groups such as Al-Qa'ida have consistently stirred attention and controversy in the West toward Atwan and the paper, particularly in the immediate aftermath of 9/11. The fatƒÅwƒÅ of Osama bin Laden in 1996 were first published by the paper. It also featured several statements from the person or people who signed themselves the Abu Hafs al-Masri BrigadesLondon Editor Prays for Nuke Attack on Israel by Rick Moran, The American Thinker, 29 August 2007 On the fifth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, Atwan wrote: \\"The events of 11 September will be remembered as the end of the US empire. This is because all empires collapse when they pursue the arrogance of power.\\"Press blasts US foreign policy, BBC News website, 11 September 2006 However, Atwan explicitly condemned terrorist attacks on innocent Western civilians, as he wrote in one of his two books, The Secret History of al Qa'ida: \\"I do not endorse or in any way support al- Qa'ida's agenda\\" and \\"I utterly condemn the attacks on innocent citizens in the West\\".The Secret History of Al-Qa'ida, Abdel Bari Atwan, Abacus (2006), Atwan unexpectedly left the paper as its chairman and editor-in-chief on 10 July 2013 and Sana Aloul became the editor-in-chief. The exact reason for Atwan's sudden departure isn't publicly known, but he stated: \\"We had on-going and never-ending financial problems whose resolution, ultimately, required political compromises that I was not able to make. Sacrificing professional integrity, our independent editorial line and the space we allowed for free comment were red lines I could not cross.\\"Gulf News, 11 July 2013: Al Quds ex- editor: ‚ÄòUncompromising integrity is what made us stand apart‚Äô Linked 2013-11-09 Organization The paper is owned and published by \\"The Al Quds Al Arabi Foundation for Publishing and Media\\". The only editor listed on the masthead was editor-in-chief Abd al-Bari Atwan. The newspaper is printed in London, New York City, and Frankfurt, and then circulated in Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, and North America. In addition to London, the paper has offices in Cairo, Rabat, and Amman. =Content= The paper is 20 pages in length. The first half or so of the paper is devoted to political news from around the world, with a focus on what it terms Arab affairs. The paper also has sections devoted to cultural news and other miscellaneous items, as well as business (2 pages) and sports sections (1 page). The paper devotes three pages to op-ed writing, divided into what it calls \\"The Al Quds Pulpit\\" (a forum for reader submission), \\"Orbits\\" (or trends), and \\"Opinion\\". The paper devotes more space to opinion and less space to business news and sports, as compared with competitors like Al-Hayat or Asharq Al-Awsat. Additionally, Abd al-Bari Atwan wrote a well-known opinion column, featured prominently on the front page until his leave on 10 July 2013. =Circulation= Circulation data for Arab media is based on estimates, which vary widely for Al Quds Al Arabi. Former American diplomat and media scholar William Rugh estimated the paper's circulation around 15,000 in 2004 which is also stated by Arab Reform Bulletin. More recent estimates cite significantly higher circulation numbers of around 50,000. By point of comparison, rival London-based Arabic press such as Al-Hayat and Asharq Al-Awsat are generally estimated in the 200,000 to 300,000 range. Reputation Marc Lynch of Foreign Policy called Al Quds Al Arabi \\"the most populist/'rejection camp' of the major Arab papers\\". It is often paired with Asharq Al Awsat to represent the polar extremes in the pan- Arab press.

The novel, like a majority of the Jack Reacher novels, is narrated in third-person point of view. Plot At a motel outside Washington D.C., former army cop Jack Reacher is confronted by two men, who call him a disgrace and order him to leave town. Reacher refuses, and subdues them in a brief fistfight. Earlier that same day, Reacher arrives at the headquarters of his old unit, the 110th MP Special Investigations Unit, to meet with its commander, Major Susan Turner. When he arrives, however, he discovers that Turner has been relieved of command. Her replacement, Col. Morgan, informs Reacher that he is under investigation in two cases: a suspected homicide dating back nearly sixteen years, and a lawsuit filed by Candice Dayton, a woman who alleges that she and Reacher had an affair when he was stationed in South Korea, and that he is the father of her fifteen-year old daughter, Samantha. When Reacher points out that the military has no authority to investigate him due to his civilian status, Morgan reinstates him as an officer and gives him a room at a local motel, where the fight occurs later that night. Learning that Turner has been incarcerated on suspicion of taking a bribe, Reacher goes to visit her, but learns that she has specifically requested that he not be allowed to do so. The next morning, Reacher meets with his lawyers, Maj. Helen Sullivan and Cap. Tracy Edmonds, and learns the details of both cases. He also meets Col. Moorcroft, Turner's attorney, and asks him to get her released from custody. When he returns to police headquarters, he discovers that Morgan has disappeared, and that two men from the 110th on duty in Afghanistan have gone missing. Reacher uses his authority as an officer to order a search for them, embarrassing Morgan and getting him banned from setting foot in the headquarters or issuing any more orders. Shortly thereafter, police from the 75th MP, led by Warrant Officer Pete Espin, take him into custody and bring him to the same prison where Turner is held. Reacher is subsequently informed by a detective that Moorcroft has been severely beaten, and that he is considered a prime suspect. Reacher arranges a meeting with Sullivan to buy time until Turner arrives, and then stages an escape, stealing Sullivan's ID and giving it to Turner. The two find her car and leave, but are intercepted by Metro police and end up ditching their ride and fleeing to Berryville, where Reacher informs Turner that her men in Afghanistan were assassinated, and that the charges against her were invented to cover up some sort of illegal activity. Finding themselves tracked by strange men, they manage to hitch a ride into West Virginia. Reacher obtains money and a car from a deceased meth dealer named Claughton, but his relatives identify the car, locate Reacher and Turner's motel, and confront them. Reacher manages to intimidate them into backing down, and takes one of their trucks. Turner explains that the mission in Afghanistan was linked to a Pashtun elder, later identified as Emal Zadran, and theorizes that Morgan, the strange men, and some higher-ups in the army's chain of command (named in the story as Romeo and Juliet) are working together to protect him. She also insists that Reacher go to Los Angeles to deal with Dayton. They track down Samantha, but Espin later confirms that the paternity claim is bogus as he found that a man named Romeo had secured a falsified birth certificate from a crooked lawyer in LA and had Candice sign it for $100. Sullivan also discovers that the homicide charge was faked as well, clearing Reacher of any potential legal consequences. Through Edmonds, Reacher and Turner learn that an illicit operation was being run through North Carolina under the control of Crew Scully and Gabriel Montague, both Deputy Chiefs of Staff, involving the smuggling of contraband using empty ordinance crates. Reacher arranges for Morgan and Staff Sgt. Ezra Shrago, one of the smugglers, to be arrested, and locates Scully and Montague at Dove Cottage, a private club, where both men choose to commit suicide rather than be arrested. Morgan and Shrago reveal that Zadran had been supplying their bosses with opium, and Turner's name is finally cleared, allowing her to resume command. They part ways, and Reacher throws his phone in the Potomac and sits by the bank, alone. Critical reception Janet Maslin, writing in The New York Times, stated that the book \\"may be the best desert island reading in the series. It's exceptionally well plotted. And full of wild surprises. And wise about Reacher's peculiar nature. And positively Bunyanesque in its admiring contributions to Reacher lore.\\" Film adaptation Paramount Pictures and Skydance Media produced the film adaptation, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, as a sequel to 2012 film, Jack Reacher.

The Armed Forces of South Russia were formed on 8 January 1919, incorporating the Volunteer Army (which was renamed the Caucasian Volunteer Army). In addition, the AFSR included the Don Army, the Crimean-Azov Army, the Forces of Northern Caucasus and the Turkestan Army. In January 1919, it numbered 51,000 Infantry, 34,000 Cavalry, 204 Field guns, 682 machine guns and 6 armoured trains. By July 1919 it had grown to 104,000 Infantry, 56,000 Cavalry, 600 Field guns, 1,500 machine guns, 19 aircraft, 34 armoured trains, 1 Cruiser, 5 Destroyers, 4 Submarines and 20 Gunboats. By October, after heavy losses and the transfer of units to other armies, the armies' strength fell drastically. On 22 May 1919, the Caucasian Volunteer Army was split into two formations: the Caucasus Army, and the Volunteer Army. The Caucasus Army disbanded on January 29, 1920 and was replaced by the short-lived Kuban Army. Troops of the Kuban Army ended up surrendering by April 18‚Äì20, 1920 to the Red Army. The Volunteer Army continued to exist from May 22, 1919 until March 26/27, 1920, when the remaining troops were evacuated from Novorossiysk to Crimea. Most then merged there with Wrangel's forces. In early April 1920, Anton Denikin, commander-in- chief of the AFSR, delegated all authority to Pyotr Wrangel, who took command of the so-called \\"Russian Army\\", which included all units remaining from the AFSR after its defeat in the Northern Caucasus.

On 27 March 1920, Denikin was forced to evacuate Novorossiysk for Crimea, which the Whites had controlled since June 1919. However, the slipshod retreat discredited Denikin and he stepped down, succeeded by General Pyotr Wrangel, who was elected new Commander-in-Chief of the White Army by military council. The South Russian Government was dissolved on 30 March in Feodosiya. Wrangel set up a new Government of South Russia in Sevastopol in April. This attempted establishment of civil government by the White authorities was a recognition that previous neglect of civil administration by the General Command of the Armed Forces of South Russia had cost the Whites civilian support.

(In Russian language, the terms \\"zavod\\" & \\"fabrika\\" for factory are not synonymous: \\"zavod\\" is reserved for heavy industry and \\"fabrika\\" for the rest). Two basic meanings are to be distinguished. Russian Revolution of 1917 and afterwards Factory committees sprang up during the Russian Revolution of 1917. These committees were varied in origin and purpose, at times acting in a supervisory role over management, in other instances engaging in matters of collective bargaining and worker representation, and in some instances acting as rudimentary organs of workers' control. While the majority of factory committees fulfilled union-type roles (indeed, many arose due to the illegality of unions in pre-revolutionary Russia), historians estimate that in 7-10% of cases, factory committees were the result of workers' take-over of the factory. Most factory committees of this type developed as a means by workers to counter lock-outs and/or sabotage by factory owners. As a June conference of factory committees resolution describes, > From the beginning of the Revolution the administrative staffs of the > factories have relinquished their posts. The workmen have practically become > the masters. To keep the factories going, the workers' committees have had > to take the management into their own hands. In the first days of the > Revolution, in February and March, the workmen left the factories and went > into the streets. The factories stopped work. About a fortnight later, the > mass of workmen returned to their work. They found that many factories had > been deserted. The managers, engineers, generals, mechanics, foremen had > reason to believe that the workmen would wreak their vengeance on them, and > they had disappeared. The workmen had to begin work with no administrative > staff to guide them. They had to elect committees which gradually re- > established a normal system of work. The committees had to find the > necessary raw materials, and altogether to take upon themselves all kinds of > unexpected and unaccustomed duties.\\" (Resolution adopted during May 30 - > June 5 Conference of Factory Committees in Petrograd, quoted in S.O. > Zagorsky, State Control of Russian Industry During the War, p. 174.) Through the factory committees workers dealt primarily with immediate economic questions, such as planning production and allocating compensation for work. At times, factory committees grew to rival the power, prestige, and effectiveness of the soviets and eventually sought political power. Nearing the October revolution, factory committees continued to grow in size and scope, attracting (and influencing) anarchists and some Bolsheviks. Lenin, for example, considered abandoning the \\"All power to the soviets!\\" strategy for an \\"All power to the factory committees!\\" strategy as the revolution neared and some soviets were proving ineffective in his insurrection plans. In the ensuing Dispute about Trade Unions, the Bolsheviks managed to eliminate this threat to their monopoly on power. Maurice Brinton of the Solidarity (UK) group wrote a history of the factory committees, their interactions with the unions and Bolshevik party in The Bolsheviks and Workers Control Soviet Union In the Soviet Union, the terms \\"fabkom/zavkom\\" were abbreviations for \\"factory committee of the local organization of a Soviet trade union\\". Often the combined term \\"fabzavkoms\\" (\\"factory and plant committees\\") was used until these terms were replaced with the neutral term \\"profkom\\" for \\"profsoyusny komitet\\" (–ø—Ä–æ—Ñ–∫–æ–º, –ø—Ä–æ—Ñ—Å–æ—é–∑–Ω—ã–π –∫–æ–º–∏—Ç–µ—Ç), which means \\"trade union committee\\". The term \\"profkom\\" has a convenience of being applicable to any type of establishment: factory, school, hospital, etc. References External links *libcom.org Russian Revolution archive, including several articles on the factory committees *Beyond Kronstadt; the Bolsheviks in power - Mark Kosman Category:Communism Category:Socialism Category:Russian Revolution Category:History of the Soviet Union ","title":"Factory committee"},{"id":"40229554","text":"Abbi Glines (Abigail Glines) (born 16 April 1977) is an American New York Times,FALLEN TOO FAR, by Abbi Glines & NEVER TOO FAR, by Abbi Glines., March 31, 2013, Combined Print & E-Book Fiction, Best Sellers - The New York Times USA Today,Forever Too Far by Abbi Glines, Book Review - USATODAY.com and Wall Street Journal Best-Selling Books, Week Ended April 28 With data from Nielsen BookScan, May 3, 2013, - WSJ (Behind paywall) bestselling novelist.

It published a magazine of the same name. Solidarity was close to council communism in its prescriptions and was known for its emphasis on workers' self-organisation and for its radical anti-Leninism. History Solidarity was founded in 1960 by a small group of expelled members of the Trotskyist Socialist Labour League. It was initially known as Socialism Reaffirmed. The group published a journal, Agitator, which after six issues was renamed Solidarity, from which the organisation took its new name. Almost from the start it was strongly influenced by the French Socialisme ou Barbarie group, in particular by its intellectual leader Cornelius Castoriadis, whose essays were among the many pamphlets Solidarity produced. The group was never large, but its magazine and pamphlets were widely read, and group members played a major part in several crucial industrial disputes and many radical campaigns, from the Committee of 100 in the early-1960s peace movement to the Polish Solidarity Campaign of the early 1980s. In the mid-1970s, a number of Solidarity's members left to form the left communist group, the Communist Workers' Organisation. Solidarity existed as a nationwide organisation with groups in London and many other cities until 1981, when it imploded after a series of political disputes. Solidarity the magazine continued to be published by the London group until 1992; other former Solidarity members were behind Wildcat in Manchester and Here and Now magazine in Glasgow. The intellectual leader of the group was Chris Pallis, whose pamphlets (written under the name Maurice Brinton) included Paris May 1968, The Bolsheviks and Workers' Control 1917-21 and 'The Irrational in Politics'.Now collected in a book, Maurice Brinton, For Workers' Power. Other key Solidarity writers were Andy Anderson (author of Hungary 1956), Ken Weller (who wrote several pamphlets on industrial struggles and oversaw the group's Motor Bulletins on the car industry), Joe Jacobs (Out of the Ghetto), John Quail (The Slow- Burning Fuse), Phil Mailer (Portugal:The Impossible Revolution) John King (The Political Economy of Marx, A History of Marxian Economics), George Williamson (writing as James Finlayson, Urban Devastation - The Planning of Incarceration), David Lamb (Mutinies) and Liz Willis (Women in the Spanish Revolution). Ideology Membership of Solidarity was open to anyone who agreed with the statement As We See It, later elaborated in As We Don't See It, some key points of which were: Solidarity rejected what it saw as the economic determinism and elitism of most of the Marxist left and committed itself to a view of socialism based on self-management. Supporting those who were in conflict with bureaucratic capitalist society \\"in industry and elsewhere\\", the group tried to generalise their experiences to develop a mass revolutionary consciousness, which it believed was essential for a total transformation of society. Crucially, the group did not see itself as another political leadership. On the contrary, it believed that the workers themselves should decide on the objectives of their struggles. Control and organisation should remain firmly in their own hands. In accordance with this, Solidarity had no confidence in the traditional organisations of the working class, the political parties and the trade unions, which it said had become parts of the bureaucratic capitalist pattern of exploitation. The group stressed that socialism was not just the common ownership and control of the means of production and distribution: it also meant equality, real freedom, reciprocal recognition and a radical transformation in all human relations. Solidarity argued that what it called the \\"trad revs\\", i.e., 'traditional revolutionaries' -- among whom it included social democrats, trade unionists, Communists and Trotskyists‚Äîhad failed to understand that in modern capitalist societies (in which it included Soviet-type societies) the key class division was between order-givers and order-takers and that self-management was now the only viable socialism. Practice In workplace politics, Solidarity took a strong line in defence of shop stewards against trade union bureaucrats (and subsequently argued that too many shop stewards had been co-opted by official trade unionism). The group did not put forward candidates for election to union posts (though many Solidarity members became shop stewards and some became officials). It nevertheless played a significant role in several industrial disputes in the 1960s and 1970s by offering its services to those involved. But it was always also otherwise engaged. The group played an important part in the direct action wing of the early-1960s peace movement (including the Committee of 100 and Spies for Peace), in local and national agitation on housing policy and in squatting throughout the 1960s and 1970s, in protests and actions against the Greek colonels and other right-wing dictatorships in the same period, in the anti-Vietnam war movement, in support of dissidents in the Soviet Union, eastern Europe and China, and in the feminist movement. In later years, Solidarity members tended to get involved in whatever took their fancy, though there were several concerted interventions, the last of them to help set up the Polish Solidarity Campaign in the early 1980s. The group's distinctive features in its interventions were its rejection of the leftist fashions both for \\"respectability\\" ‚Äì the bugbear of first-wave CND as it saw it ‚Äì and for supporting \\"national liberation struggles\\" in the third world and, closer to home, Ireland. Solidarity was also anti-Zionist (in Brinton's 1974 essay \\"The Malaise on the Left\\" Zionism is described as \\"anti-Arab\\" and \\"anti-socialist\\"). Solidarity was corruscating in its criticisms of Leninist organisational practice, of the \\"lifestyle\\" left that saw \\"liberation\\" in personal terms, and of fellow libertarian socialists who fetishised action for its own sake. Solidarity consistently privileged first-person participant accounts of activism in its industrial and campaigning politics and was equally consistently critical of the process of grassroots political activity. Time and again the group produced documented case studies of how left orthodoxy had let down workers in struggle or radical campaigns. Critics accused it of sectarianism and argued that it operated ‚Äì contrary to its professed anti-elitism ‚Äì as an informal \\"structureless tyranny\\" with Pallis/Brinton at the centre of a clique of friends. David Widgery's 1973 survey noted: Publications For all Solidarity's engagement in struggle \\"in industry and elsewhere\\", its main activity was as a publications group. It produced regular magazines from 1960 to 1992. Agitator (1960‚Äì61), which became Solidarity for Workers' Power (1961‚Äì1977), was published by the London Solidarity group; there were also various short-lived Solidarity magazines published outside London, including the north-west and Glasgow. Solidarity for Self-Management (1977‚Äì78) and Solidarity for Social Revolution (1978‚Äì81) were both magazines of the national group. The final manifestation of the magazine, called simply Solidarity (1982‚Äì92), was published by the London group. The group also specialised in pamphlets, of which it produced more than 60. Many of them were texts by Cornelius Castoriadis from Socialisme ou Barbarie, published under Castoriadis's pen- name, Paul Cardan, among them Modern Capitalism and Revolution, From Bolshevism to the Bureaucracy, Redefining Revolution, The Meaning of Socialism and Workers' Councils and the Economics of a Self-Managed Society. Other pamphlets include: Solidarity's platforms, As We See It and As We Don't See It; Maurice Brinton's The Bolsheviks and Workers' Control 1917-21, Paris, May 1968 and The Irrational in Politics; and Andy Anderson's Hungary 1956. Solidarity also reprinted many pamphlets associated with the Workers' Opposition in Russia, such as Ida Mett's The Kronstadt Commune and Alexandra Kollontai's The Workers' Opposition. Many of the pamphlets are accessible online. Bibliography Former members of Solidarity are contributing accounts of their experiences with the group to John Quail, who is writing a history. Louis Robertson (the pen-name of a Solidarity member of the late 1970s from the Midlands, who joined the group with a handful of other fellow former dissident members of the Socialist Party of Great Britain) has published an account on the web of his time in Solidarity. He says: Robertson also describes the group as he first encountered it in the early 1970s: He continues on the mid-1970s: In fact there were two London groups: the original North London group and a West London group that focused on industrial agitation in West London. Robertson goes on to describe how Solidarity played midwife to various minor left-wing groups, among them the left-communist groups World Revolution and the Communist Workers' Organisation.

Lenin characterized the NEP in 1922 as an economic system that would include \\"a free market and capitalism, both subject to state control,\\" while socialized state enterprises would operate on \\"a profit basis.\\"Lenin, V.I. \\"The Role and Functions of the Trade Unions under the New Economic Policy\\", LCW, 33, p. 184., Decision of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.), 12 January 1922. Published in Pravda No. 12, 17 January 1922; Lenin's Collected Works, 2nd English Edition, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1973, first printed 1965, Volume 33, pp. 186‚Äì196. The NEP represented a more market-oriented economic policy (deemed necessary after the Russian Civil War of 1918 to 1922) to foster the economy of the country, which had suffered severely since 1915. The Soviet authorities partially revoked the complete nationalization of industry (established during the period of War Communism of 1918 to 1921) and introduced a system of mixed economy which allowed private individuals to own small enterprises, while the state continued to control banks, foreign trade, and large industries. In addition, the NEP abolished prodrazvyorstka (forced grain-requisition) and introduced prodnalog: a tax on farmers, payable in the form of raw agricultural product. The Bolshevik government adopted the NEP in the course of the 10th Congress of the All-Russian Communist Party (March 1921) and promulgated it by a decree on 21 March 1921: \\"On the Replacement of Prodrazvyorstka by Prodnalog\\". Further decrees refined the policy. Other policies included monetary reform (1922‚Äì1924) and the attraction of foreign capital. The NEP policy created a new category of people called NEPmen (–Ω—ç–ø–º–∞–Ω—ã) (nouveau riches). Joseph Stalin abandoned the NEP in 1928 with the Great Break.  Beginnings  In November 1917, the Bolsheviks seized control of key centres in Russia. This led to the Russian Civil War of 1917‚Äì1922, which pitted the Bolsheviks and their allies against the Whites and other counter-revolutionary forces. During this period the Bolsheviks attempted to administrate Russia's economy purely by decree, a policy of the War Communism. Farmers and factory workers were ordered to produce, and food and goods were seized and issued by decree. While this policy enabled the Bolshevik regime to overcome some initial difficulties, it soon caused economic disruptions and hardships. Producers who were not directly compensated for their labor often stopped working, leading to widespread shortages. Combined with the devastation of the war, these were major hardships for the Russian people and diminished popular support for the Bolsheviks. At the end of the Civil War, the Bolsheviks controlled Russian cities, but 80% of the Russian population were peasants. Although almost all the fighting had occurred outside urban areas, urban populations decreased substantially.Koenker, Diane P., William G. Rosenberg, and Ronald Grigor Suny, ed. Party, State, and Society in the Russian Civil War (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1989), pp. 58‚Äì80. The war disrupted transportation (especially railroads), and basic public services. Infectious diseases thrived, especially typhus. Shipments of food and fuel by railroad and by water dramatically decreased. City residents first experienced a shortage of heating oil, then coal, until they resorted to wood. Populations in northern towns (excluding capital cities) declined an average of 24%.Koenker, Rosenberg, and Suny, ed., 61. Northern towns received less food than towns in the agricultural south. Petrograd alone lost 850,000 people, half of the urban population decline during the Civil War. Hunger and poor conditions drove residents out of cities. Workers migrated south to get peasants' surpluses. Recent migrants to cities left because they still had ties to villages. Urban workers formed the core of Bolshevik support, so the exodus posed a serious problem. Factory production severely slowed or halted. Factories lacked 30,000 workers in 1919. To survive, city dwellers sold personal valuables, made artisan craft-goods for sale or barter, and planted gardens. The acute need for food drove them to obtain 50‚Äì60% of food through illegal trading (see meshochnik). The shortage of cash caused the black market to use a barter system, which was inefficient.Koenker, Rosenberg, and Suny, ed., pp. 58‚Äì119. Drought and frost led to the Russian famine of 1921, in which millions starved to death, especially in the Volga region, and urban support for the Bolshevik party eroded. When no bread arrived in Moscow in 1921, workers became hungry and disillusioned. They organised demonstrations against the Bolshevik Party's policy of privileged rations, in which the Red Army, Party members, and students received rations first. The Kronstadt rebellion of soldiers and sailors broke out in March 1921, fueled by anarchism and populism. In 1921 Lenin replaced the food requisitioning policy with a tax, signaling the inauguration of the New Economic Policy.Siegelbaum, p. 85.  Policies  Reestablishment of a stable currency, the gold-backed chervonets, was an essential policy component of the Soviet state's return to a money- based economy The laws sanctioned the co-existence of private and public sectors, which were incorporated in the NEP, which was a state oriented \\"mixed economy\\".V N. Bandera \\"New Economic Policy (NEP) as an Economic Policy.\\" Journal of Political Economy 71, no. 3 (1963): https://www.jstor.org/stable/1828984 (accessed 4 March 2009), 268. The NEP represented a move away from full nationalization of certain parts of industries. Some kinds of foreign investments were expected by the Soviet Union under the NEP, in order to fund industrial and developmental projects with foreign exchange or technology requirements.Fitzpatrick, The Russian Revolution, p. 96. The NEP was primarily a new agricultural policy.Vladimir P. Timoshenko, Agricultural Russia and the Wheat Problem. Stanford, CA: Food Research Institute, Stanford University, 1932; p. 86. The Bolsheviks viewed traditional village life as conservative and backward. With the NEP, the state only allowed private landholdings because the idea of collectivized farming had met strong opposition. Lenin understood that economic conditions were dire, so he opened up markets to a greater degree of free trade, hoping to motivate the population to increase production. Under the NEP, not only were \\"private property, private enterprise, and private profit largely restored in Lenin's Russia,\\" but Lenin's regime turned to international capitalism for assistance, willing to provide \\"generous concessions to foreign capitalism.\\" A. James Gregor, Marxism, Fascism & Totalitarianism: Chapters in the Intellectual History of Radicalism, Stanford: CA, Stanford University Press, 2008, p. 55-56 Lenin took the position that in order to achieve socialism, he had to create \\"the missing material prerequisites\\" of modernization and industrial development that made it imperative for Soviet Russia to \\"fall back on a centrally supervised market-influenced program of state capitalism\\". Lenin was following Karl Marx's precepts that a nation must first reach \\"full maturation of capitalism as the precondition for socialist realization.\\"A. James Gregor, Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship, Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 59 Future years would use the term Marxism‚ÄìLeninism to describe Lenin's approach to economic policies which were seen to favor policies that moved the country toward communism. The main policy Lenin used was an end to grain requisitions and instead instituted a tax on the peasants, thereby allowing them to keep and trade part of their produce. At first, this tax was paid in kind, but as the currency became more stable in 1924, it was changed to a cash payment. This increased the peasants' incentive to produce, and in response production jumped by 40% after the drought and famine of 1921‚Äì22.Siegelbaum, p. 90 NEP economic reforms aimed to take a step back from central planning and allow the economy to become more independent. NEP labor reforms tied labor to productivity, incentivizing the reduction of costs and the redoubled efforts of labor. Labor unions became independent civic organizations. NEP reforms also opened up government positions to the most qualified workers. The NEP gave opportunities for the government to use engineers, specialists, and intelligentsia for cost accounting, equipment purchasing, efficiency procedures, railway construction, and industrial administration. A new class of \\"NEPmen\\" thrived. These private traders opened up urban firms hiring up to 20 workers. NEPmen also included rural artisan craftsmen selling their wares on the private market.Siegelbaum, pp. 97‚Äì116  Disagreements in leadership  Lenin considered the NEP as a strategic retreat from socialism.Lenin, V. I. \\"New economic policy and the politprosvet's goals.\\" Collected Works, v. 44. p. 159 He believed it was capitalism, but justified it by insisting that it was a different type of capitalism, \\"state capitalism\\", the last stage of capitalism before socialism evolved. While Stalin seemed receptive towards Lenin's shift in policy towards a state capitalist system, he stated in the Twelfth Party Congress in April 1923 that it allowed the \\"growth of nationalistic and reactionary thinking..\\". He also states that in the recent Central Committee plenum there were speeches made which were incompatible with communism, all of which were ultimately caused by the NEP. These statements were made just after Lenin was incapacitated by strokes. Leon Trotsky and Joseph Stalin disagreed over how to develop the Soviet economy. Trotsky, supported by radical members of the Communist Party, believed that socialism in Russia would only survive if the state controlled the allocation of all output. Trotsky believed that the state should repossess all output to invest in capital formation. On the other hand, Stalin supported the more moderate members of the Communist Party and advocated for a state-run capitalist economy. Stalin managed to wrest control of the Communist Party from Trotsky. After defeating the Trotsky faction, Stalin reversed his opinions about economic policy and implemented the first five-year plan.Sheila Fitzpatrick, The Russian Revolution. New York: Oxford University Press, 1984. p. 115  Results  After the New Economic Policy was instituted, agricultural production increased greatly. In order to stimulate economic growth, farmers were given the opportunity to sell portions of their crops to the government in exchange for monetary compensation. Farmers now had the option to sell some of their produce, giving them a personal economic incentive to produce more grain. This incentive, coupled with the breakup of the quasi-feudal landed estates, surpassed pre-Revolution agricultural production. The agricultural sector became increasingly reliant on small family farms, while heavy industries, banks, and financial institutions remained owned and run by the state. This created an imbalance in the economy where the agricultural sector was growing much faster than heavy industry. To maintain their income, factories raised prices. Due to the rising cost of manufactured goods, peasants had to produce much more wheat to buy these consumer goods, which increased supply and thus lowered the price of these agricultural products. This fall in prices of agricultural goods and sharp rise in prices of industrial products was known as the Scissors Crisis (due to the crossing of graphs of the prices of the two types of product). Peasants began withholding their surpluses in wait for higher prices, or sold them to \\"NEPmen\\" (traders and middle-men) who re-sold them at high prices. Many Communist Party members considered this an exploitation of urban consumers. To lower the price of consumer goods, the state took measures to decrease inflation and enact reforms on the internal practices of the factories. The government also fixed prices, in an attempt to halt the scissor effect. The NEP succeeded in creating an economic recovery after the devastation of World War I, the Russian Revolution, and the Russian Civil War. By 1925, in the wake of Lenin's NEP, a \\"... major transformation was occurring politically, economically, culturally and spiritually.\\" Small-scale and light industries were largely in the hands of private entrepreneurs or cooperatives. By 1928, agricultural and industrial production had been restored to the 1913 (pre- World War I) level.  End of NEP  By 1924, the year of Lenin's death, Nikolai Bukharin had become the foremost supporter of the New Economic Policy. The USSR abandoned NEP in 1928 after Joseph Stalin obtained a position of leadership during the Great Break. Stalin was initially noncommitted to the NEP; as early as 1918 Stalin was quoted calling it \\"...the beginning of the planned reconstruction of the outmoded social-economic system in a new socialist manner\\". Stalin then enacted a system of collectivization during the Grain Procurement Crisis of 1928 and saw the need to quickly accumulate capital for the vast industrialization programme introduced with the Five Year Plans starting in 1928. The Bolsheviks hoped that the USSR's industrial base would reach the level of capitalist countries in the West, to avoid losing a future war. (Stalin proclaimed, \\"Either we do it, or we shall be crushed.\\") Stalin asserted that the grain crisis was caused by kulaks ‚Äì relatively wealthy farmers who allegedly \\"hoarded\\" grain and participated in \\"speculation of agricultural produce\\". He also considered peasant farms too small to support the massive agricultural demands of the Soviet Union's push for rapid industrialization, and Soviet economists claimed that only large collective farms could support such an expansion. Accordingly, Stalin imposed collectivization of agriculture. Land held by the kulaks was seized and given to agricultural cooperatives (kolkhozes and sovkhozes). Lenin and his followers saw the NEP as an interim measure. However, it proved highly unpopular with the Left Opposition in the Bolshevik Party because of its compromise with some capitalist elements and the relinquishment of state control. The Left saw the NEP as a betrayal of Communist principles, and believed it would have a negative long-term economic effect, so they wanted a fully planned economy instead. In particular, the NEP fostered a class of traders (\\"NEPmen\\") whom the Communists regarded as \\"class enemies\\" of the working class. On the other hand, Vladimir Lenin is quoted to have said \\"The NEP is in earnest and long-term\\" (–ù–≠–ü ‚Äì —ç—Ç–æ –≤—Å–µ—Ä—å–µ–∑ –∏ –Ω–∞–¥–æ–ª–≥–æ), \\"Speech In Closing The Conference May 28\\") which has been used to surmise that if Lenin had lived, the NEP would have continued beyond 1929. Lenin had also been known to say about NEP, \\"We are taking one step backward, to take two steps forward later\\", suggesting that, though the NEP pointed in another direction, it would provide the economic conditions necessary for socialism eventually to evolve. Despite Lenin's opinion that the NEP should last several decades at least until universal literacy was accomplished, in 1928, after only seven years of NEP, Lenin's successor Stalin introduced full central planning, re- nationalized much of the economy, and from the late 1920s onwards introduced a policy of rapid industrialization. Stalin's collectivization of agriculture was his most notable departure from the NEP approach.  Influence  Pantsov and Levine see many of the post-Mao economic reforms of the Chinese Communist Party's former paramount leader Deng Xiaoping away from a command economy and towards a \\"socialist market economy\\" during the 1980s as influenced by the NEP: \\"It will be recalled that Deng Xiaoping himself had studied Marxism from the works of the Bolshevik leaders who had propounded NEP. He drew on ideas from NEP when he spoke of his own reforms. In 1985, he openly acknowledged that 'perhaps' the most correct model of socialism was the New Economic Policy of the USSR.\\"  See also  * Capital accumulation * Corporatism * Dirigisme * Family in the Soviet Union * Hyperinflation in early Soviet Russia * Mixed economy * Soviet-type economic planning * State capitalism  Multimedia  * Vladimir I.

She authored several books alleging human rights violations on the part of Israeli authorities. She lived in Germany from 1990 and acquired German citizenship in 2008. In July 2009, President of Germany Horst K√∂hler awarded her the Federal Cross of Merit, First class, which is the fifth highest of Germany's federal order of merit's eight ranks. The bestowal triggered a public controversy because of her attitude towards the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In 1990, she was awarded the Right Livelihood Award for \\"the exemplary courage of her advocacy for the basic rights of the Palestinian people.\\" Youth in Eastern Europe Felicia- Amalia Langer was born to Jewish parents in the Polish town of Tarn√≥w in 1930. In 1939, her family fled from the German invasion to the Soviet Union, where her father died in one of Stalin's gulag prisons. Other relatives were murdered by the Nazis. In 1949, she married Mieciu Langer in Breslau, a survivor of Nazi concentration camps who had lost his entire family in the Holocaust. Time in Israel In 1950, the young couple immigrated to Israel, where their son was born in 1953. In 1959 she began to study law at Hebrew University Jerusalem, where she obtained a law degree in 1965. She briefly worked for a Tel Aviv law firm, but then opened up her own lawyer's office in 1966. She was opposed to the conduct of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, and so established a private practice in Jerusalem defending Palestinian political detainees. Langer was the first lawyer to assist Palestinians in cases involving land confiscation, house demolition, deportation, and torture before Israeli military courts. Langer only infrequently won cases in her 23-year career. In 1977, she lost her licence to defend Israeli conscientious objectors before Israeli courts and could be excluded from proceedings at any time on security grounds. Langer counted her successful defense in 1979 of Nablus mayor Bassam Shaka as the high point of her career. Shaka had been a PLO supporter and outspoken critic of the Camp David accords, and was subsequently accused of inciting terrorism by his public statements and issued an expulsion order. Langer defended him successfully, having the expulsion order overturned by the Israeli supreme court. For many years Langer was vice president of the Israeli League for Human and Civil Rights. She joined the bi-national, anti-Zionist and pro- Palestinian New Communist List Rakah, in which she became part of the central committee. In 1990 she departed from the party after an internal conflict of orientation, closed her lawyer‚Äôs office and moved to Germany with her husband. In an interview with the Washington Post, Langer said she quit because Palestinians no longer can expect justice in Israel.Journal of Palestine Studies Volume XIX, no 4 (76) Summer 1990, pg. 212. cites Washington Post, 13 May 1990. Time in Germany From 1990, she lived in T√ºbingen, Baden- W√ºrttemberg, Germany, and acquired German citizenship in 2008. She accepted teaching positions at the universities of Bremen and Kassel and continues to author books which have been translated to several languages. She became patron of the association Refugees¬¥ Children in Lebanon which assists Palestinian refugee families. After March 2009 she supported the newly founded Russell Tribunal for Palestine. In her writings, lectures and interviews she criticized the Israeli policy in the occupied Palestinian territories, which she considered equivalent to an annexation. Langer furthermore considered the construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank as undermining the possibility of a two-state solution and demands the complete and unconditional retreat of Israel from the territories conquered in 1967 and a right to return for any descendant of the Palestinian refugees. In 1990, Langer received the Right Livelihood Award \\"for the exemplary courage of her struggle for the basic rights of the Palestinian people.\\" In 1991, she was awarded the Bruno Kreisky Award for Outstanding Achievements in the Area of Human Rights. In 2002, she declared that whereas the Palestinian terrorist attacks were unjustifiable, the Israeli policy had \\"paved the way\\" for them. Within this context, she adopted the opinion of the deputy chairman of the German Liberal Party FDP J√ºrgen M√∂llemann, who had called the targeted killings of Palestinian subjects by Israeli security forces as an act of state terror. In 2003, she wrote the preface to a book written by Jamal Karsli. In 2005, Langer was awarded the Erich M√ºhsam Prize for her continuing struggle for the human rights of the Palestinian people. She was a supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which campaigns for democratic reformation of the United Nations. In 2007, she described the Israeli regime in the occupied Palestinian territories as \\"apartheid of present time\\". Death Felicia Langer died on 21 June 2018, aged 87, in T√ºbingen, Germany.Im Gedenken an eine gro√üe Humanistin: Felicia Langer, diefreiheitsliebe.de; accessed 22 June 2018. Federal Cross of Merit Langer was awarded the Federal Cross of Merit, First class, by the President of Germany Horst K√∂hler following the nomination by the government of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, itself based on suggestions by the publicist Evelyn Hecht-Galinski and the city of T√ºbingen. At the award ceremony, on 16 July 2009 in Stuttgart, the decoration was bestowed by Hubert Wicker, a senior civil servant of Baden-W√ºrttemberg‚Äôs chancellery. The official award acknowledges a lifetime effort of Langer for peace, justice and the respect of human rights, as well as her efforts for people in need of help without regard of their nationality or religion and independently of their personal political, or religious motivation or worldview. He furthermore admonished her childhood and youth rife of distress/sorrow, war, persecution and flight. Discussion about the award The federal state government led by G√ºnther Oettinger had adopted the proposal after having consulted all commonly involved positions including the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs.\\"Auszeichnung Felicia Langers l√∂st Wirbel aus\\" The decision has been criticized by several Jewish municipalities as well as several prominent German Jews, Jewish and pro-Israeli organizations like the Central Council of Jews in Germany, the New York-based American Jewish Committee and the Deutsch- Israelischen Gesellschaft. Polish-German journalist and author Henryk Broder assumed that K√∂hler had made the decision, ignoring Langer's statements criticizing Israel.Henryk Broder, \\"Feigenblatt des schlechten Gewissens\\", spiegel.de; accessed 22 June 2018. The deputy president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany Dieter Graumann declared in an interview, Germany had awarded a person who had been demonising Israel professionally, chronically and obsessively.\\"Bundesverdienstkreuz: K√∂hler ger√§t √ºber Vergabe unter Druck\\", zeit.de, 21 July 2009. Arno Lustiger, Ralph Giordano and Arno Hamburger announced their intent to return their Federal Crosses of Merit if Langer's award was not revoked. They said Langer had compared the Israeli policy to the HolocaustOffener Brief Arno Lustigers an Horst K√∂hler, honestly-concerned.org, 21 July 2009; accessed 22 June 2018. (PDF) and described her as a long-time \\"enemy of Israel\\" guilty of the \\"devastating effect\\" of a common German desideratum to disburden the own guiltiness by criticizing Israel.Offener Brief Ralph Giordanos an Horst K√∂hler, spiegel.de; accessed 22 June 2018. Langer said she never compared the Israeli foreign policy to the Holocaust, but considered it as a policy of apartheid.Arno Hamburger gibt seine Orden zur√ºck , N√ºrnberger Nachrichten, 2 September 2009. Giordano later withdrew his announcement to return his award, maintaining his critique.Ralph Giordano, \\"Ich bin immer noch geschockt\\", Die Welt, 6 August 2009. The Israeli travellers' guide, Motke Shomrat, known for his advocacy for the conciliation between Israel and Germany, and honoured with a Federal Cross of Merit, returned it on 24 July 2009,Ulrich W. Sahm \\"‚ÄûMit gro√üem Schmerz‚Äú Bundesverdienstkreuz zur√ºckgegeben\\", n-tv.de; accessed 22 June 2018. as Langer had supposedly consented anti-Israeli statements of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad,Motke Shomrat \\"Eine Schande\\" which was denied by Langer. Federal Cross of Merit holder Ralph Giordano said: \\"No one in the last 25 years, with a one-sidedness bordering on blindness, has done Israel more damage than this supposed human- rights lawyer.\\"German Jewish author attacks prize for Israel critic, monstersandcritics.com; accessed 22 June 2018. The American Jewish Committee wrote a letter to K√∂hler condemning the award. The letter expresses an \\"astonishment at the decision to honour an individual who for many years was an apologist for a regime which brought untold fear and misery upon the citizens of eastern Germany\\", and refers to her membership of the Israeli Communist Party.AJC rejects Germany's honour for harsh Israel critic , jta.org, 21 July 2009. A sharp criticism in German newspapers was mentioned by the spokesman of the Israeli ministry of foreign affairs Yigal Palmor. He said that Langer had a long track of supporting forces in benefit of violence, death and extremism.Benjamin Weinthal The Langer Case, tagesspiegel.de, 24 July 2009. As a result of the criticism, and in response to Arno Hamburger¬¥s return of his award, Gert Haller, the highest ranking state secretary in the office of the President of Germany, Horst K√∂hler, wrote a letter to Hamburger saying that the grievance caused by the awarding was \\"terribly unfortunate.\\" After requests by Hamburger he stated there was no legal basis to withdraw the award.German president regrets Langer award, Jerusalem Post, 7 September 2009. Educationist Micha Brumlik criticized Langer's conduct, argumentation and choice of words as too one-sided. He considers that making Israel the only responsible for the situation in the Middle East is typical of an anti-Semitic pattern of argumentation. Nevertheless, she might deserve the Federal Cross of Merit on the merits of calling the attention to the permanent violations of the human rights of the Arab population in the occupied territories on the behalf of Israel.\\"Antisemitismusforscher Brumlik: ‚ÄûIn der Sache hat Frau Langer das Bundesverdienstkreuz verdient‚Äú\\", spiegel.de, 22 July 2009.

According to Soviet historiography, the ruling Bolshevik administration adopted this policy with the goal of keeping towns (the proletarian power-base) and the Red Army stocked with food and weapons since circumstances dictated extreme measures as the ongoing civil war disrupted normal economic mechanisms and relations. War communism began in June 1918, enforced by the Supreme Economic Council (), known as the Vesenkha. It ended on 21 March 1921 with the beginning of the New Economic Policy, which lasted until 1928.  Policies  War communism included the following policies: # Nationalization of all industries and the introduction of strict centralized management # State control of foreign trade # Strict discipline for workers, with strikes forbidden # Obligatory labor duty by non-working classes # Prodrazvyorstka ‚Äì requisition of agricultural surplus (in excess of an absolute minimum) from peasants for centralized distribution among the remaining population # Rationing of food and most commodities, with centralized distribution in urban centers # Private enterprise banned # Military-style control of the railways Because the Bolshevik government implemented all these measures in a time of civil war, they were far less coherent and coordinated in practice than they might appear on paper. Large areas of Russia remained outside Bolshevik control, and poor communications meant that even those regions loyal to the Bolshevik government often had to act on their own, lacking orders or coordination from Moscow. It has long been debated whether \\"war communism\\" represented an actual economic policy in the proper sense of the phrase, or merely a set of measures intended to win the civil war.  Aims  The goals of the Bolsheviks in implementing war communism are a matter of controversy. Some commentators, including a number of Bolsheviks, have argued that its sole purpose was to win the war. Vladimir Lenin, for instance, said that \\"the confiscation of surpluses from the peasants was a measure with which we were saddled by the imperative conditions of war-time.\\" Other Bolsheviks, such as Yurii Larin, Lev Kritzman, Leonid Krasin, and Nikolai Bukharin, argued that it was a transitional step towards socialism. Commentators, such as the historian Richard Pipes, the philosopher Michael Polanyi, and economists such as Paul Craig Roberts or Sheldon L. Richman, have argued that war communism was actually an attempt to immediately eliminate private property, commodity production and market exchange, and in that way to implement communist economics, and that the Bolshevik leaders expected an immediate and large-scale increase in economic output. This view was also held by Nikolai Bukharin, who said that \\"We conceived War Communism as the universal, so to say 'normal' form of the economic policy of the victorious proletariat and not as being related to the war, that is, conforming to a definite state of the civil war\\".  Results  = Military = War communism was largely successful at its primary purpose of aiding the Red Army in halting the advance of the White Army and in reclaiming most of the territory of the former Russian Empire thereafter. = Social = In the cities and surrounding countryside, the population experienced hardships as a result of the war. Peasants because of the extreme scarcity were beginning to refuse to co-operate in giving food for the war effort. Workers began migrating from the cities to the countryside, where the chances to feed themselves were higher, thus further decreasing the possibility of barter of industrial goods for food and worsening the plight of the remaining urban population, economy and industrial production. Between 1918 and 1920, Petrograd lost 70% of its population, while Moscow lost over 50%. A series of workers' strikes and peasants' rebellions broke out all over the country, such as the Tambov rebellion (1920‚Äì1921). A turning point came with the Kronstadt rebellion at the Kronstadt naval base in early March 1921. The rebellion startled Lenin because Bolsheviks considered Kronstadt sailors the \\"reddest of the reds\\". The nature of these uprisings and their leadership were also of significant concern because they were generally left-wing uprisings led oppositionist leftists, thus creating competition with the Bolsheviks. According to David Christian, the Cheka, the state Communist Party secret police, reported 118 peasant uprisings in February 1921.Pipes, p. 373. Christian, in his book Imperial and Soviet Russia, summarises the state of Russia in 1921 after years of War communism: > A government claiming to represent the people now found itself on the verge > of being overthrown by that same working class. The crisis had undermined > the loyalty of the villages, the towns and finally sections of the army. It > was fully as serious as the crises faced by the tsarist government in 1905 > and February 1917. Bolshevik officials were paralyzed by the Russian famine of 1921‚Äì22 which coincided with the catastrophic crisis of the war and economic difficulties faced by the new regime. These militarization efforts were taken sustain the Red Army for the war effort and the defence of the new state, for proper logistics, and to distribute the scarce supplies to people that the regime considered needed it more than others, such as the Red Army. = Economic = A black market emerged in Russia, despite the threat of martial law against profiteering. The rouble collapsed and barter increasingly replaced money as a medium of exchange and, by 1921, heavy industry output had fallen to 20% of 1913 levels. 90% of wages were paid with goods rather than money. 70% of locomotives were in need of repair, and food requisitioning, combined with the effects of seven years of war and a severe drought, contributed to a famine that caused between 3 and 10 million deaths. Coal production decreased from 27.5 million tons (1913) to 7 million tons (1920), while overall factory production also declined from 10,000 million roubles to 1,000 million roubles. According to the noted historian David Christian, the grain harvest was also slashed from 80.1 million tons (1913) to 46.5 million tons (1920).

During the Russian Civil War, he established an anti-communist government in Siberia‚Äîlater the Provisional All-Russian Government‚Äîand was recognised as the \\"Supreme Leader and Commander-in-Chief of All Russian Land and Sea Forces\\" by the other leaders of the White movement from 1918 to 1920.Jon Smele (2006) Civil War in Siberia: The Anti-Bolshevik Government of Admiral Kolchak, 1918‚Äì1920, Cambridge University Press, . p.77 His government was based in Omsk, in southwestern Siberia. For nearly two years, Kolchak was Russia's internationally recognized head of state. However, his effort to unite the White Movement failed; Kolchak refused to consider autonomy for ethnic minorities and refused to cooperate with non-Bolshevik leftists, heavily relying on outside aid. This served only to boost the Reds morale, as it allowed them to label Kolchak as a \\"Western Puppet\\". As his White forces fell apart, he was betrayed and captured by the Czechoslovak Legion who handed him over to local Socialists-Revolutionaries, and he was soon after executed by the Bolsheviks in Irkutsk.N.

Biography  =Early life and career= Kolchak on board the Zarya Kolchak was born in Saint Petersburg in 1874 to a family of minor Russian nobility of Moldavian origin. Both his parents were from Odessa. His father was a retired major-general of the Marine Artillery and a veteran of the 1854 siege of Sevastopol, who after retirement worked as an engineer in ordnance works near St. Petersburg. Kolchak was educated for a naval career, graduating from the Naval Cadet Corps in 1894 and joining the 7th Naval Battalion. He was soon transferred to the Russian Far East, serving in Vladivostok from 1895 to 1899. He then returned to western Russia and was based at Kronstadt, joining the Russian Polar expedition of Eduard Toll on the ship Zarya in 1900 as a hydrologist. After considerable hardship, Kolchak returned in December 1902; Eduard Toll with three other explorers continued further north and were lost. Kolchak took part in two Arctic expeditions to look for the lost explorers (who were not found) and for a while was nicknamed \\"Kolchak-Poliarnyi\\" (\\"Kolchak the Polar\\"). For his explorations Kolchak received the Constantine Medal, the highest award of the Imperial Russian Geographical Society. In December 1903, Kolchak was en route to St. Petersburg to marry his fianc√©e, Sophia Omirova, when, not far from Irkutsk, he received notice of the start of war with the Empire of Japan and hastily summoned his bride and her father to Siberia by telegram for a wedding, before heading directly to Port Arthur. In the early stages of the Russo-Japanese War, he served as watch officer on the cruiser ,Admiral Kolchak, K.A. Bogdanov, St. Petersburg Sudostroyeniye 1993 and later commanded the destroyer Serdityi. He made several night sorties to lay naval mines, one of which succeeded in sinking the Japanese cruiser . He was decorated with the Order of St. Anna 4th class for the exploit. As the blockade of the port tightened and the Siege of Port Arthur intensified, he was given command of a coastal artillery battery. He was wounded in the final battle for Port Arthur and taken as a prisoner of war to Nagasaki, where he spent four months. His poor health (rheumatism, a consequence of his polar expeditions) led to his repatriation before the end of the war. Kolchak was awarded the Golden Sword of St. George with the inscription \\"For Bravery\\" on his return to Russia. Returning to Saint Petersburg in April 1905, Kolchak was promoted to lieutenant commander and took part in the rebuilding of the Imperial Russian Navy, which had been almost completely destroyed during the war. He served on the Naval General Staff from 1906, helping draft a shipbuilding program, a training program, and developing a new protection plan for St. Petersburg and the Gulf of Finland. Kolchak took part in designing the special icebreakers Taimyr and Vaigach, launched in 1909 and spring of 1910. Based in Vladivostok, these vessels were sent on cartographic expedition to the Bering Strait and Cape Dezhnev. Kolchak commanded the Vaigach during this expedition and later worked at the Academy of Sciences with the materials collected by him during expeditions. His study, Ice of the Kara and Siberian Seas,Kolchak A.V., 1909, Ice of the Kara and Siberian Seas (170 pp.). St. Petersburg (in Russian). was printed in the Proceedings of the Russian Imperial Academy of Sciences and is considered the most important work on this subject. Extracts from it were published under the title \\"The Arctic Pack and the Polynya\\" in the volume issued in 1929 by the American Geographical Society, Problems of Polar Research. In 1910 he returned to the Naval General Staff, and in 1912 he was assigned to the Russian Baltic Fleet. = First World War = Vice-admiral Kolchak in 1916 The onset of the First World War found him on the flagship Pogranichnik, where Kolchak oversaw the laying of extensive coastal defensive minefields and commanded the naval forces in the Gulf of Riga. Commanding Admiral Essen was not satisfied to remain on the defensive and ordered Kolchak to prepare a scheme for attacking the approaches of the German naval bases. During the autumn and winter of 1914‚Äì1915, Russian destroyers and cruisers started a series of dangerous night operations, laying mines at the approaches to Kiel and Danzig. Kolchak, feeling that the man responsible for planning operations should also take part in their execution, was always on board those ships which carried out the operations and at times took direct command of the destroyer flotillas. He was promoted to vice-admiral in August 1916, the youngest man at that rank, and was made commander of the Black Sea Fleet, replacing Admiral Eberhardt. Kolchak's primary mission was to support General Yudenich in his operations against the Ottoman Empire. He also was tasked with countering the U-boat threat and planning the invasion of the Bosphorus (never carried out). Kolchak's fleet was successful at sinking Turkish colliers. Because there was no railroad linking the coal mines of eastern Turkey with Constantinople, the Russian fleet's attacks on these Turkish coal ships caused the Ottoman government much hardship. In 1916, in a combined Army-Navy assault, the Russian Black Sea fleet aided the Russian army's capture of the Ottoman city of Trebizond (modern Trabzon). One notable disaster took place under Kolchak's watch: the dreadnought Imperatritsa Mariya exploded in port at Sevastopol on 7 October 1916. A careful investigation failed to determine whether the cause of the disaster was accident or sabotage. = Revolution = The Black Sea fleet descended into political chaos after the onset of the 1917 February Revolution. Kolchak was relieved of command of the fleet in June and traveled to Petrograd (St. Petersburg). On his arrival at Petrograd, Kolchak was invited to a meeting of the Provisional Government. There he presented his view on the condition of the Russian armed forces and their complete demoralisation. He stated that the only way to save the country was to re- establish strict discipline and restore capital punishment in the army and navy. During this time many organisations and newspapers of a conservative inclination spoke of him as a future dictator. A number of new and secret organisations had sprung up in Petrograd with the goal of suppressing the Bolshevist movement and the removal of the extremist members of the government. Some of these organisations asked Kolchak to accept the leadership. When news of these plots found their way to then Naval Minister of the Provisional Government, Alexander Kerensky, he ordered Kolchak to leave immediately for America. Admiral James H. Glennon, a member of American mission headed by Senator Elihu Root, invited Kolchak to the United States to brief the American Navy on the strategic situation in the Bosphorus. On 19 August 1917 Kolchak with several officers left Petrograd for Britain and the United States as a quasi-official military observer. When passing through London he was greeted cordially by the First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, who offered him transport on board a British cruiser on his way to Halifax in Canada. The journey to America proved unnecessary, as by the time Kolchak arrived, the US had given up the idea of any independent action in the Dardanelles. Kolchak visited the American Fleet and its ports and decided to return to Russia via Japan. = Russian Civil War = The Bolshevik revolution found Kolchak in Japan and then Harbin in November 1917. As a supporter of the Provisional Government, he returned to Russia, through Vladivostok, in 1918. Kolchak was an absolute supporter of the Allied cause against Imperial Germany and regarded Russia's immediate withdrawal from the conflict as dishonorable. Upon hearing of the October Revolution, Kolchak offered to enlist in the British Army to continue the struggle. The British were inclined to accept Kolchak's offer, and there were indeed plans to send Kolchak to Mesopotamia (modern Iraq). Ultimately, the British Foreign Office decided that Kolchak could do more for the Allied cause by toppling Vladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks and bringing Russia back into the war on the side of the Allies. Reluctantly, Kolchak accepted the British suggestions and returned to Russia. Kolchak arrived in Manchuria and was placed in charge of security for the Russian-owned Chinese Eastern Railroad. Arriving in Omsk, Siberia, en route to enlisting with the Volunteer Army, he agreed to become a minister in the (White) Siberian Regional Government. Joining a 14-man cabinet, he was a prestige figure; the government hoped to play on the respect he had with the Allies, especially the head of the British military mission, General Alfred Knox. Knox wrote that Kolchak had \\"more grit, pluck and honest patriotism than any Russian in Siberia\\". Kolchak was a man with poor social skills, being moody, melancholy, taciturn, and very uncomfortable in dealing with people. Arriving at a dinner, Colonel John Ward described him as \\"a small, vagrant, lonely soul without a friend enter unbidden to a feast\\". One who knew him wrote: > The character and soul of the Admiral are so transparent that one needs no > more than one week of contact to know all there is to know about him. He is > a big, sick child, a pure idealist, a convinced slave of duty and service to > an idea and to Russia. An indubitable neurotic who quickly flares up, > exceedingly impetuous and uncontrolled in expressions of displeasure and > anger; in this respect he has assimilated the highly unattractive traditions > of the naval service, which permit in high naval ranks behavior that in our > army has long since passed into the realm of legend.

For > the sake of this he can be persuaded and moved to do anything whatever. He > has no personal interests, no amour propre: in this respect he is crystal > pure.

He > does not know life in its severe, practical reality, and lives in a world of > mirages and borrowed ideas. He has no plans, no system, no will: in this > respect he is soft wax from which advisers and intimates can fashion > whatever they want, exploiting the fact that it is enough to disguise > something as necessary for the welfare of Russia and the good of the cause > to be certain of his approval. Another who knew him wrote of Kolchak: > He is kind and at the same time severe, responsive and at the same time > embarrassed to show human feelings, concealing his gentleness behind make- > believe severity. He is impatient and stubborn, loses his temper, threatens > and then calms down, making concessions, spreads his hands in a gesture of > helplessness. He is bursting to be with the people, with the troops, but > when he faces them, has no idea of what to say. Politically naive and an inept administrator, Kolchak described himself as a \\"military technician\\" who knew nothing of politics, described power as a \\"cross\\", and in a letter to his wife wrote about the \\"terrifying burden of Supreme Power\\" and admitted that as \\"a fighting man he was reluctant to face the problems of statecraft\\". The American historian Richard Pipes wrote that Kolchak's only strengths were his courage, patriotism, integrity, and a strong sense of honor, writing that he was \\"...in many ways, along with Wrangel, the most honorable White commander in the Civil War\\", but his weaknesses such his tendency to suffer from manic depression and an inability to \\"understand people or communicate with them\\", which made him into \\"an execrable administrator in whose name were committed unpardonable acts of corruption and brutality that he personally found utterly repugnant.\\" In November 1918, the unpopular regional government was overthrown in a British sponsored coup d'etat. Kolchak had returned to Omsk on 16 November from an inspection tour. He was approached and refused to take power. The Socialist-Revolutionary (SR) directory leader and members were arrested on 18 November by a troop of Cossacks under ataman Krasilnikov. The remaining cabinet members met and voted for Kolchak to become the head of government with emergency powers. He was named Supreme Ruler (Verkhovnyi Pravitel), and he promoted himself to full admiral. The arrested SR politicians were expelled from Siberia and ended up in Europe. Kolchak's signature He issued the following manifesto to the population: The Left SR leaders in Russia denounced Kolchak and called for his assassination. Their activities resulted in a small revolt in Omsk on 22 December 1918, which was quickly put down by Cossacks and the Czechoslovak Legion,Precl√≠k, Vratislav.

Subsequently, the SRs opened negotiations with the Bolsheviks and in January 1919 the SR People's Army joined up with the Red Army. Kolchak pursued a policy of persecuting revolutionaries as well as Socialists of several factions. His government issued a decree on 3 December 1918 stating, \\"In order to preserve the system and rule of the Supreme Ruler, articles of the criminal code of Imperial Russia were revised, Articles 99 and 100 of which established capital punishment for assassination attempts on the Supreme Ruler and for attempting to overthrow his government. \\"Insults written, printed, and oral, are punishable by imprisonment under Article 103.

Kolchak (seated), Anna Timiryova and General Alfred Knox (behind Kolchak) observing a military exercise in 1919 Although the news of Kolchak's ascension to power spread very slowly behind Bolshevik lines, it caused considerable excitement among anti-communist Russians living there. Ivan Bunin wrote in his diary, \\"4/17 June 1919. The Entente has named Kolchak the Supreme Ruler of Russia. Izvestia wrote an obscene article saying: 'Tell us, you reptile, how much did they pay you for that?' The devil with them. I crossed myself with tears of joy.\\"Ivan Bunin (1926) Cursed Days: A Diary of Revolution, p. 177. On 11 April 1919, the Kolchak government adopted Regulation no. 428, \\"About the dangers of public order due to ties with the Bolshevik Revolt\\". The legislation was published in the Omsk newspaper Omsk Gazette (no. 188 of 19 July 1919). It provided a term of 5 years of prison for \\"individuals considered a threat to the public order because of their ties in any way with the Bolshevik revolt.\\" In the case of unauthorised return from exile, there could be hard labour from 4 to 8 years. Articles 99‚Äì101 allowed the death penalty, forced labour and imprisonment, repression by military courts, and imposed no investigation commissions. Kolchak acknowledged all of Russia's debts, returned nationalized factories and plants to their owners, granted concessions to foreign investors, dispersed trade unions, persecuted Marxists, and disbanded the soviets. Kolchak's agrarian policy was directed toward restoring private land ownership. To this end former Tsarist laws concerning property were restored. On 26 May 1919, the Supreme Allied Council in Paris offered to provide Kolchak with unlimited supplies of food, weapons, munitions and other supplies (but not diplomatic recognition) provided that he was willing to meet the following conditions: * Promise to convene the Constituent Assembly the Bolsheviks had disbanded in January 1918. * Allow local self-government in territories under his control. * Promise not to restore the aristocracy, the \\"former land system\\" and \\"make no attempt to reintroduce the regime which the revolution had destroyed\\" (i.e. not restore the monarchy). * Recognize the independence of Finland and Poland. * Accept Allied mediation for relations with the Baltic states and in the Caucasus. * Promise to join the League of Nations. * Promise to pay all of Russia's debts. Kolchak with French general Maurice Janin Pipes wrote though the Allies wanted a Constituent Assembly to decide the future of Russia, but they had decided in advance in their conditions that they had imposed such as no restoration of the monarchy, many matters that properly should have been decided by the Constituent Assembly. As Kolchak was entirely dependent upon supplies from Britain as the British shipped him in the period October 1918-October 1919 about 600,000 rifles, 6,831 machine guns, and about 200,000 uniforms, he had to accept nearly all of the conditions. In a telegram to Paris sent on 4 June 1919, Kolchak accepted every condition except for the independence of Finland, which he accepted only de facto, not de jure, saying he wanted the Constituent Assembly to grant Finland its independence. As the Allies were especially opposed to a return of the House of Romanov, Kolchak emphatically declared \\"that there cannot be a return to the regime which existed in Russia before February 1917\\". The British War Secretary Winston Churchill pressed very strongly in the cabinet for British recognition of Kolchak's government, but the Prime Minister David Lloyd George would only do so if the United States likewise recognized Kolchak. The American president Woodrow Wilson was strongly hostile towards Kolchak, openly doubted his word, and was against diplomatic recognition. Wilson's main adviser on Russia was the former head of the Provisional Government, Alexander Kerensky, who told Wilson that Kolchak was a \\"reactionary\\" who would \\"inaugurate a regime hardly less sanguinary and repressive than that of the Bolsheviks\\". Though American forces in Siberia co- operated with Kolchak, it was clear he was not the man favored by the United States as the next leader of Russia. American forces had been sent to Siberia less to help the Whites than to prevent the Japanese who had occupied the Russian Far East from annexing it as Tokyo was openly considering. The Great Soviet Encyclopedia alleges (without evidence) that more than 25,000 people were shot or tortured to death in Yekaterinburg alone.S.N. Semanov, \\"Kolchakovshchina\\" , Great Soviet Encyclopaedia In March 1919 Kolchak himself demanded one of his generals to \\"follow the example of the Japanese who, in the Amur region, had exterminated the local population.\\" ‚Äì not an original source citation, Mayer's footnote for this statement not cited. Sovietskaya Rossiya, an official organ of the Soviet Bureau established by Ludwig Martens, quoted a Menshevik organ, Vsegda Vperyod, alleging that Kolchak's men used mass floggings and razed entire villages to the ground with artillery fire. 4,000 peasants allegedly became victims of field courts and punitive expeditions and that all dwellings of rebels were burned down.P. Golub (2006) White Terror in Russia (1918‚Äì1920). Moscow: Patriot, In an excerpt from the order of the government of Yenisei county in Irkutsk province, General. S. Rozanov said: Kolchak inspecting troops There was prominent underground resistance in the regions controlled by Kolchak's government. These partisans were especially strong in the provinces of Altai and Yeniseysk. In summer 1919 partisans of the Altai Region united to form the Western Siberian Peasants' Red Army (25,000 men). The Taseev Soviet Partisan Republic was founded south- east of Yeniseysk in early 1919. By the fall of 1919, Kolchak's rear was completely disintegrating. About 100,000 Siberian partisans seized vast regions from Kolchak's regime even before the approach of the Red Army. In February 1920, some 20,000 partisans took control of the Amur region.\\"The Partisan Movement of 1918‚Äì22\\" , Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 1969‚Äì1978 British Marxist historian Edward Hallett Carr wrote,A review of General Wrangel's memoirs, John Hallett, Fortnightly Review, January 1930, as quoted by Jonathan Haslam in The vices of integrity: E.H. Carr, 1892‚Äì1982, , p. 32 On the contrary, a former Chief of Staff to Admiral Kolchak wrote, = Supreme Ruler of Russia = Kolchak with 270x270px Initially the White forces under his command had some success. Kolchak was unfamiliar with combat on land and gave the majority of the strategic planning to D. A. Lebedev, Paul J. Bubnar, and his staff. The northern army under the Russian Anatoly Pepelyayev and the Czech Rudolf Gajda seized Perm in late December 1918 and after a pause other forces spread out from this strategic base. The plan was for three main advances ‚Äì Gajda to take Archangel, Khanzhin to capture Ufa and the Cossacks under Alexander Dutov to capture Samara and Saratov. The White forces took Ufa in March 1919 and pushed on from there to take Kazan and approach Samara on the Volga River. Anti-Communist risings in Simbirsk, Kazan, Viatka, and Samara assisted their endeavours. The newly formed Red Army proved unwilling to fight and instead retreated, allowing the Whites to advance to a line stretching from Glazov through Orenburg to Uralsk. Kolchak's territories covered over 300,000 km2 and held around 7 million people. In April, the alarmed Bolshevik Central Executive Committee made defeating Kolchak its top priority. But as the spring thaw arrived Kolchak's position degenerated ‚Äì his armies had outrun their supply lines, they were exhausted, and the Red Army poured newly raised troops into the area. Draft coat of arms of the Russian government Kolchak had also aroused the dislike of potential allies, including the Czechoslovak Legion and the Polish 5th Rifle Division. They withdrew from the conflict in October 1918 but remained a presence; their foreign adviser Maurice Janin regarded Kolchak as an instrument of the British and himself was pro-SR. Kolchak could not count on Japanese aid either; the Japanese feared he would interfere with their occupation of Far Eastern Russia and refused him assistance, creating a buffer state to the east of Lake Baikal under Cossack control. The 7,000 or so American troops in Siberia were strictly neutral regarding \\"internal Russian affairs\\" and served only to maintain the operation of the Trans-Siberian railroad in the Far East. The American commander, General William S. Graves, personally disliked the Kolchak government, which he saw as monarchist and autocratic, a view that was shared by the American President, Woodrow Wilson.Postage stamp issued in 1919 with the inscription \\"For United Russia ‚Äì Supreme leader of Russia, Kolchak.\\" = Defeat and death = From 1919, when the Red forces managed to reorganise and turn the attack against Kolchak, he quickly lost ground. The Red counter-attack began in late April at the centre of the White line, aiming for Ufa. The fighting was fierce as, unlike earlier, both sides fought hard. Ufa was taken by the Red Army on 9 June and later that month the Red forces under Tukhachevsky broke through the Urals. Freed from the geographical constraints of the mountains, the Reds made rapid progress, capturing Chelyabinsk on 25 July and forcing the White forces to the north and south to fall back to avoid being isolated. The White forces re-established a line along the Tobol and the Ishim rivers to temporarily halt the Reds. They held that line until October, but the constant loss of men killed or wounded was beyond the White rate of replacement. Reinforced, the Reds broke through on the Tobol in mid-October and by November the White forces were falling back towards Omsk in a disorganised mass. At this point the Reds became sufficiently confident to start redeploying some of their forces southwards to face Anton Denikin. The last photo of Kolchak taken before his execution in 1920 A memorial cross placed at the resting place of Kolchak Kolchak also came under threat from other quarters: local opponents began to agitate and international support began to wane, with even the British turning more towards Denikin. Gajda, dismissed from command of the northern army, staged an abortive coup in mid-November. Omsk was evacuated on 14 November, and the Red Army took the city without any serious resistance, capturing large amounts of ammunition, almost 50,000 soldiers, and ten generals. As there was a continued flood of refugees eastwards, typhus too became a serious problem. Kolchak had left Omsk on the 13th for Irkutsk along the Trans-Siberian Railroad. Travelling a section of track controlled by the Czechoslovaks, he was sidetracked and stopped; by December his train had only reached Nizhneudinsk. In late December Irkutsk fell under the control of a leftist group (including SRs and Mensheviks) and formed the Political Centre. One of their first actions was to dismiss Kolchak. When he heard of this on 4 January 1920, he announced his resignation, giving his office to Denikin and passing control of his remaining forces around Irkutsk to the ataman, G. M. Semyonov. The transfer of power to Semyonov proved a particularly ill- considered move. Kolchak was then promised safe passage by the Czechoslovaks to the British military mission in Irkutsk. Instead, he was handed over to the Left SR authorities in Irkutsk on 14 January. On 20 January the government in Irkutsk surrendered power to a Bolshevik military committee. The White Army under the command of General Vladimir Kappel advanced toward Irkutsk while Kolchak was interrogated by a commission of five men representing the Revolutionary Committee (REVKOM) during nine days between 21 January and 6 February. Despite the arrival of a contrary order from Moscow,W. Bruce Lincoln (1999) Red Victory: A History of the Russian Civil War, 1918‚Äì1921, DaCapo Press, Admiral Kolchak was sentenced to death along with his Prime Minister, Viktor Pepelyayev. Both prisoners were brought before a firing squad in the early morning of 7 February 1920. According to eyewitnesses, Kolchak was entirely calm and unafraid, \\"like an Englishman.\\" The Admiral asked the commander of the firing squad, \\"Would you be so good as to get a message sent to my wife in Paris to say that I bless my son?\\" The commander responded, \\"I'll see what can be done, if I don't forget about it.\\"Peter Fleming (1963) The Fate of Admiral Kolchak, Harcourt, Brace, & World, Inc., pp. 216‚Äì217. A priest of the Russian Orthodox Church then gave the last rites to both men. The squad fired and both men fell. The bodies were kicked and prodded down an escarpment and dumped under the ice of the frozen Angara River. Their bodies were never recovered. When the White Army learned about the executions, its remaining leadership decided to withdraw farther east. The Great Siberian Ice March followed. The Red Army did not enter Irkutsk until 7 March, and only then was the news of Kolchak's death officially released.  Legacy  Monument of Alexander Kolchak on Kolchak Island Admiral Kolchak's government was not successful from the time of his taking the position of \\"Supreme Ruler\\" until his death. As a military commander he was unable to make successful strategic plans or to coordinate with other White Army generals such as Yudenich or Denikin. Kolchak also failed to convince potentially friendly Finland to join with him against the Bolsheviks. He was unable to win diplomatic recognition from any nation in the world, even the United Kingdom (though the British did support him to some degree). In addition he alienated the Czechoslovak Legion, which for a time was a powerful organised military force in the region and very strongly anti-Bolshevik. As was mentioned above, the American commander, General Graves, disliked Kolchak and refused to lend him any military aid at all. Monument of admiral Kolchak in Irkutsk After decades of being vilified by the Soviet government, Kolchak is now a controversial historic figure in post-Soviet Russia. The For Faith and Fatherland movement has attempted to rehabilitate his reputation. However, two rehabilitation requests have been denied, by a regional military court in 1999 and by the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation in 2001. In 2004, the Constitutional Court of Russia returned the Kolchak case to the military court for another hearing.Krasnov, V. G. Kolchak: I zhizn π, i smert πza Rossiiu. 2 vols.

Monuments dedicated to Kolchak were built in Saint Petersburg in 2002 and in Irkutsk in 2004, despite objections from some former Communist and left-wing politicians, as well as former Soviet army veterans. His memorial in St. Petersburg is a frequent target of vandalism. There is also a Kolchak Island. The modern Russian Navy considered naming the third ship of the new s, Admiral Kolchak to commemorate the Admiral but declined to do so in the end. Kolchak was a prominent expert on naval mines100 –≤–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏—Ö –∫–∞–∑–Ω–µ–π, \\"–í–µ—á–µ\\", 1999, and a member of the Russian Geographical Society. Among his awards are the Saint George Gold Sword for Bravery, given for his actions in the battle of Port Arthur and the Great Gold Constantine Medal from the Russian Geographic Society and Serbian Order of the White Eagle.  In culture  A Kolchak biographical film, titled Admiral (–ê–¥–º–∏—Ä–∞–ª—ä), was released in Russia on 9 October 2008 after a gala preview to an audience of senior Russian Navy admirals. The film portrays the Admiral (Konstantin Khabensky) as a tragic hero with a deep love for his country. Elizaveta Boyarskaya appears as his common law wife, Anna Timireva. Director Andrei Kravchuk described the film as follows, > It's about a man who tries to create history, to take an active part in > history, as he gets caught in the turmoil. However, he keeps on struggling, > he preserves his honor and his dignity, and he continues to love. A collectible silver coin (31.1 gr, dia 40mm) showing Admiral Kolchak has been struck.

Wilson also designed a self-acting motion for steam hammers which was key to making them practical for industrial use, among many other inventions. Early years Robert Wilson was born in Dunbar on the eastern Scottish coast on 10 September 1803, son of a fisherman. His father was drowned in 1810, and the family moved inland. Wilson left school at the age of nine. He became a joiner's apprentice. From an early age he began experimenting with model boats driven by \\"rotating sculls\\", with different numbers of blades on a shaft, and blades of different shapes and sizes set at different angles. The minutes of the Dunbar Mechanic's Institute of 18 October 1827 record, James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale became interested in Wilson's experiments, and in 1827 notified the Admiralty of the invention, but did not gain their attention. Wilson conducted successful sea trials in April 1828 on the Firth of Forth near to Leith, observed by witnesses who included Vice-Admiral David Milne. However, Wilson was forced to stop when he ran into debt. He resumed the trials in June 1832 using a loaned boat, and won the silver medal of the Highland Society of Scotland. Once again the Admiralty ignored his results. On 17 September 1833 the captain superintendent of the Woolwich dockyard wrote \\"We have carefully examined the papers ... the plan proposed ... is objectionable, as it involves a greater loss of power than the common mode of applying the [paddle]wheels to the side.\\" Foundry manager In 1838 Wilson was appointed Works Manager at James Nasmyth's Bridgewater Foundry in Patricroft near Manchester. He improved Nasmyth's design for a steam hammer, inventing the self-acting motion that made it possible to adjust the force of the blow delivered by the hammer ‚Äì a critically important improvement. An early writer said of Wilson's gear, \\"... I would be prouder to say that I was the inventor of that motion, then to say I had commanded a regiment at Waterloo...\\" Nasmyth's steam hammers could now vary the force of the blow across a wide range. Nasmyth was fond of breaking an egg placed in a wineglass without breaking the glass, followed by a blow that shook the building. From 1845 to 1856 Wilson was employed by the Low Moor Ironworks near Bradford in Yorkshire. While at Low Moor he improved the steam hammer with the \\"circular balanced valve\\". He returned to the Bridgewater foundry in July 1856, and became Managing Partner when Nasmyth retired at the end of that year. The company designed and manufactured machine tools, hydraulic presses, pumps and locomotives. Wilson built a very large double-acting steam hammer for the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich. The company was renamed Nasmyth, Wilson & Co. in 1867, and Wilson continued to be a partner until 1882. Between 1842 and 1880 Wilson took out more than thirty patents for mechanical devices. In 1857 he became a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. In 1873 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He was also a member of the Royal Scottish Society of Arts. He was finally awarded ¬£500 by the War Office for his double action screw propeller for torpedoes in 1880. Wilson died on 28 July 1882 in Matlock, Derbyshire, England at the age of 78.

The All-Palestine Government ( ') was established by the Arab League on 22 September 1948 during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War to govern the Egyptian-controlled enclave in Gaza. It was soon recognized by all Arab League members except Transjordan. Though jurisdiction of the Government was declared to cover the whole of the former Mandatory Palestine, its effective jurisdiction was limited to the Gaza Strip.Gelber, Y. Palestine, 1948. Pp. 177‚Äì78 The Prime Minister of the Gaza- seated administration was Ahmed Hilmi Pasha, and the President was Hajj Amin al-Husseini, former chairman of the Arab Higher Committee.Spencer C. Tucker, Priscilla Mary Roberts. The Encyclopedia of the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli Conflict: A Political, Social, and Military History: A Political, Social, and Military History p 464 Shortly thereafter the Jericho Conference named King Abdullah I of Transjordan \\"King of Arab Palestine\\".See Jericho Declaration, Palestine Post, December 14, 1948, Front page The Congress called for the union of Arab Palestine and Transjordan and Abdullah announced his intention to annex the West Bank. The other Arab League member states opposed Abdullah's plan. All- Palestine Government's importance gradually declined, especially after the relocation of its seat of government from Gaza to Cairo following the Israeli invasion in December 1948. Though the Gaza Strip remained under Egyptian control through the war, the All-Palestine Government remained in exile in Cairo, managing Gazan affairs from outside. In parallel to the 1952 Egyptian Revolution, the authority of the government further degraded, being put by the Arab League under the official aegis of Egypt. In 1953, the All-Palestine Government was nominally dissolved, except the Prime Minister Hilmi position, who kept attending the Arab League meetings on behalf of All-Palestine protectorate.Middle East Record Volume 1 - pg.128 In 1959, the All-Palestine nominal area was de jure merged into the United Arab Republic, coming under formal Egyptian military administration, who appointed Egyptian military administrators in Gaza. The All-Palestine Government is regarded by some as the first attempt to establish an independent Palestinian state. It was under official Egyptian protection, but it had no executive role. The government had mostly political and symbolic implications. The All-Palestine Government's credentials as a bona fide sovereign rule were questioned by many mainly due to the government's effective reliance upon not only Egyptian military support but also Egyptian political and economic power. Egypt, however, both formally and informally renounced any and all territorial claims to Palestine territory (in contrast to the government of Transjordan, which declared its annexation of the West Bank). Background =British rule= At the end of World War I, Great Britain occupied the Ottoman territory of Palestine. The boundaries of the occupied land were not well defined. Britain and France, the main Allied Powers with a long-term interest in the area, made several agreements which set up spheres of interest between them in the area. Britain sought to legitimize the occupation by obtaining the British Mandate of Palestine from the League of Nations. In the mandated territory, Britain set up two separate administrations‚ÄîPalestine and Transjordan‚Äîwith the stated objective that they would in the course of time become fully independent.See Marjorie M. Whiteman, Digest of International Law, vol. 1, US State Department (Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1963) pp 650‚Äì652Hersh and Elihu Lauterpacht, E. Lauterpacht(ed). International Law: Collected Papers of Hersch Lauterpacht Cambridge University Press, 1978, , page 100 There was opposition from the Arab population of Palestine to the objectives set out in the mandate, and civil unrest persisted throughout the term of the mandate. Various attempts were made to reconcile the Arab community with the growing Jewish population without success. Several partition plans were proposed. The United Nations proposed the Partition Plan of 1947 which proposed that the Gaza area would become part of a new Arab Palestinian state. The Arab states rejected the United Nations plan, which heralded the start of the 1947‚Äì48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine. Ernest Bevin, the British Foreign Secretary, said that after twenty five years the British had failed to establish the self-governing institutions in Palestine that had been required under the Mandate.See Text of Message From Mr. Bevin to the U.S. State Department, February 7th, 1947, Foreign Relations of the United States, 1947 The Near East and Africa, Volume V (1947), page 1033 Transjordan had been recognized as an independent government throughout most of the mandatory period, but it was officially recognized as an independent state by the United Kingdom in the Treaty of London (1946). Some countries continued to dispute its independent status.Foreign Relations of the United States, Volume VII, 1946, page 796 =End of the Mandate= With the announcement by Britain that it would unilaterally withdraw from the Mandate on 15 May 1948, the players in the region commenced maneuvers to secure their positions and objectives in the power vacuum brought on by the departing British. The objective of the surrounding Arab countries in the take-over of the whole of the British Mandate was set out on April 12, 1948, when the Arab League announced: > The Arab armies shall enter Palestine to rescue it. His Majesty (King > Farouk, representing the League) would like to make it clearly understood > that such measures should be looked upon as temporary and devoid of any > character of the occupation or partition of Palestine, and that after > completion of its liberation, that country would be handed over to its > owners to rule in the way they like.Gerson, Allan. Israel, the West Bank and > international law, Routledge, 1978, , p 78 Israel declared its independence on 14 May 1948, the day before the expiration of the Mandate (because 15 May was the Jewish Sabbath). On 15 May 1948, the Egyptian army invaded the territory of the former British Mandate from the south, starting the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. Formation of All-Palestine Government An Egyptian Ministerial order dated 1 June 1948 declared that all laws in force during the Mandate would continue to be in force in the Gaza Strip. On 8 July 1948, the Arab League decided to set up a temporary civil administration in Palestine, to be directly responsible to the Arab League. This plan was strongly opposed by King Abdullah I of Transjordan and received only half-hearted support from the Arab Higher Committee, which had itself been set up in 1945 by the Arab League. The new administration was never properly established. Another order issued on 8 August 1948 vested an Egyptian Administrator-General with the powers of the High Commissioner.Palestine Yearbook of International Law 1987-1988, Vol 4, by Anis F. Kassim, Kluwer Law International (1 June 1988), , p 294 The Egyptian government, suspicious of King Abdullah's intentions and growing power in Palestine, put a proposal to the Arab League meeting that opened in Alexandria on 6 September 1948. The plan would turn the temporary civil administration, which had been agreed to in July, into an Arab government with a seat in Gaza for the whole of Palestine. The formal announcement of the Arab League's decision to form the Government of All-Palestine was issued on 20 September. The All-Palestine Government was under the nominal leadership of Amin al-Husayni, the Mufti of Jerusalem. Ahmed Hilmi Abd al-Baqi was named Prime Minister. Hilmi's cabinet consisted largely of relatives and followers of Amin al-Husayni, but also included representatives of other factions of the Palestinian ruling class. Jamal al-Husayni became foreign minister, Raja al-Husayni became defense minister, Michael Abcarius was finance minister, Awni Abd al-Hadi was minister for social affairs and Anwar Nusseibeh was secretary of the cabinet. Husayn al-Khalidi was also a member. Twelve ministers in all, from different Arab countries, headed for Gaza to take up their new positions. The decision to set up the All-Palestine Government made the Arab Higher Committee irrelevant, but Amin al-Husayni continued to exercise an influence in Palestinian affairs. The All-Palestine National Council was convened in Gaza on 30 September 1948 under the chairmanship of Amin al-Husayni. The council passed a series of resolutions culminating on 1 October 1948 with a declaration of independence over the whole of Palestine, with Jerusalem as its capital. Although the new government claimed jurisdiction over the whole of Palestine, it had no administration, no civil service, no money, and no real army of its own. It formally adopted the Flag of the Arab Revolt that had been used by Arab nationalists since 1917 and revived the Holy War Army with the declared aim of liberating Palestine. Abdullah regarded the attempt to revive al-Husayni's Holy War Army as a challenge to his authority and on 3 October his minister of defense ordered all armed bodies operating in the areas controlled by the Arab Legion to be disbanded. Glubb Pasha carried out the order ruthlessly and efficiently.Shlaim, 2001, p. 99. The sum effect was that: > 'The leadership of al-Hajj Amin al-Husayni and the Arab Higher Committee, > which had dominated the Palestinian political scene since the 1920s, was > devastated by the disaster of 1948 and discredited by its failure to prevent > it.'Rex Brynen, Sanctuary and Survival: The PLO in Lebanon Westview Press, > Boulder, 1990 p. 20 After Israel began a counter-offensive on the southern front on 15 October 1948, the All-Palestine Government was quickly recognized by six of the then seven members of the Arab League: Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen, but not by Transjordan.Kadosh, Sandra Berliant. \\"United States Policy Toward The West Bank In 1948.\\" Jewish Social Studies 46.3/4 (1984): 231‚Äì252.

Academic Search Premier. Web. 16 May 2012. It was not recognized by any other country. Activities of the All-Palestine Government =After the declaration= Despite its lofty declarations and goals, the All-Palestine Government proved to be generally ineffectual. The Palestinian Arabs, and the Arab world in general, were shocked by the speed and extent of the Israeli victories, and the poor showing of the Arab armies. This, combined with the expansionist designs of King Abdullah, cast the Palestinian Arab leadership into disarray. Avi Shlaim writes: > 'The decision to form the Government of All-Palestine in Gaza, and the > feeble attempt to create armed forces under its control, furnished the > members of the Arab League with the means of divesting themselves of direct > responsibility for the prosecution of the war and of withdrawing their > armies from Palestine with some protection against popular outcry. Whatever > the long-term future of the Arab government of Palestine, its immediate > purpose, as conceived by its Egyptian sponsors, was to provide a focal point > of opposition to Abdullah and serve as an instrument for frustrating his > ambition to federate the Arab regions with Transjordan'.Shlaim, 2001, p. 97. =First years= The 1948 Arab-Israeli War came to an end with the Israel- Egypt Armistice Agreement of 24 February 1949, which fixed the boundaries of the Gaza Strip.Egypt Israel Armistice Agreement UN Doc S/1264/Corr.1 23 February 1949 The All-Palestine Government was not a party to the Agreement nor involved in its negotiation. The Gaza Strip was the only area of the former British Mandate territory that was under the nominal control of the All-Palestine Government. The rest of the British Mandate territory became either part of Israel or the West Bank, annexed by Transjordan (a move that was not recognized internationally). In reality, the Gaza Strip was under Egyptian administration, though Egypt never made any claim to or annexed any Palestinian territory. Egypt did not offer the Palestinians citizenship. There was an enormous influx into the Gaza Strip of Palestinian refugees from those parts of the former Mandate Palestine that became part of Israel. From the end of 1949 the refugees received aid directly from UNRWA and not from or through the All-Palestine Government. There is no evidence of any All-Palestine Government involvement in the negotiations for the setting up of UNRWA-run refugee camps in the Gaza Strip or anywhere else. =Under Nasser's policies= After the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 and the rise to power of Gamal Abdel Nasser, Egyptian support for Pan-Arabism and the Palestinian cause increased. However, the new rule increasingly acted to degrade the Palestinian self-rule. In 1952, All-Palestine being put by the Arab League under the official aegis of Egypt. In 1953, the All-Palestine Government was nominally dissolved, except the Prime Minister Hilmi position, who kept attending the Arab League meetings on behalf of All-Palestine. During the Suez War of 1956 Israel invaded the Gaza Strip and the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula. Israel eventually withdrew from the territories it had invaded, and the All-Palestine Government continued to have official sovereignty in Gaza. In 1957, the Basic Law of Gaza established a Legislative Council that could pass laws which were given to the High Administrator-General for approval.\\"From Occupation to Interim Accords\\", Raja Shehadeh, Kluwer Law International, 1997, pages 77‚Äì78; and Historical Overview, A. F. & R. Shehadeh Law Firm =Dissolution= The situation changed again after the 1958 unification of Egypt and Syria in the United Arab Republic. In 1959, Gamal Abdel Nasser officially annulled the All- Palestine Government by decree, reasoning that the All-Palestine Government had failed to advance the Palestinian cause. At that time, Amin al-Husayni moved from Egypt to Lebanon and the Gaza Strip became directly administered by Egypt. In March 1962 a Constitution for the Gaza Strip was issued confirming the role of the Legislative Council. Egyptian administration came to an end in June 1967 when the Gaza Strip was captured by Israel in the Six-Day War.

The argument as to the legitimacy of the State of Israel is also couched in terms of Israel's right to exist. Although Israel has been a member of the United Nations since 11 May 1949,un.org/en/members/ 3 July 2006 as of 2020, 31 United Nations member states do not recognise the State of Israel. The campaign against the legitimacy of Israel is led especially by some Palestinian and Arab leaders, and groups for countries to deny or withdraw recognition of Israel. Diplomatic normalization and legitimacy From an international relations perspective, Israel meets basic standards for legitimacy as a state.Edward M. Siegel, ed., Israel's Legitimacy in Law and History (New York: Center for Near East Policy), 1993 , 30 United Nations member states did not recognise the State of Israel: 16 of the 21 UN members in the Arab League: Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, and Yemen; a further nine members of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Brunei, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Mali, Niger, and Pakistan; and Bhutan, Cuba, North Korea and Venezuela. Since the publication of this document, Maldives has recognized Israel. On the other hand, six members of the Arab League recognise Israel: Egypt, Jordan, Mauritania, Oman, United Arab Emirates and Palestine; and most of the non-Arab members of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation also recognise Israel. A handshake between Hussein I of Jordan and Yitzhak Rabin, accompanied by Bill Clinton, during the Israel-Jordan peace negotiations, 25 July 1994 In the 1990s, Islamic and leftist movements in Jordan attacked the Israel‚ÄìJordan Treaty of Peace as legitimization.Paul L. Scham and Russell E. Lucas. \\"'Normalization' and 'Anti- Normalization' in Jordan: The Public Debate\\" Middle East Review of International Affairs, Vol. 5, No. 3 (September 2001) Significant minorities in Jordan see Israel as an illegitimate state, and reversing the normalization of diplomatic relations was central to Jordanian discourse.Mustafa Hamarneh, Rosemary Hollis, Khalil Shikaki. Jordanian-Palestinian Relations ‚Äì Where to? Four Scenarios for the Future. Royal Institute of International Affairs, 1997. p. 8 In 2002 the Arab League unanimously adopted the Arab Peace Initiative at their Beirut summit. The comprehensive peace plan called for full normalization of Arab-Israeli relations in return for full Israeli withdrawal from the territories occupied in June 1967. Turki al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia said that in endorsing the initiative every Arab state had \\"made clear that they will pay the price for peace, not only by recognising Israel as a legitimate state in the area, but also to normalise relations with it and end the state of hostilities that had existed since 1948.\\" =Palestinian Authority and Hamas= Yitzhak Rabin, Bill Clinton, and Yasser Arafat at the Oslo Accords signing ceremony, 13 September 1993 Following the Oslo I Accord, the Palestinian Authority and Israel conditionally recognized each other's right to govern specific areas of the country. This boosted Israel's legal authority and legitimacy on the international stage.Burhan Dajani. \\"The September 1993 Israeli-PLO Documents: A Textual Analysis\\". Journal of Palestine Studies Vol. 23, No. 3 (Spring, 1994), pp. 5‚Äì23 Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas, said while speaking at the UN regarding Palestinian recognition, \\"We did not come here seeking to delegitimize a state established years ago, and that is Israel.\\" Hamas, in contrast, does not recognize Israel as a legitimate government. Furthermore, Hamas denies the legitimacy of the Oslo I Accord. Rhetoric of delegitimization Especially in recent years, following the Palestinian legislative election of 2006 and Hamas' governance of the Gaza Strip, the term \\"delegitimisation\\" has been frequently applied to rhetoric surrounding the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. =Legitimacy rhetoric as antisemitism= Delegitimization is seen by some observers to be a double standard which separates Israel from other legitimate nations which have imperfect government. Natan Sharansky, head of the Jewish Agency, discussed a 3D Test for determining new antisemitism. The third of the three D's is delegitimization. He explains \\"when Israel's fundamental right to exist is denied ‚Äì alone among all peoples in the world ‚Äì this too is anti- Semitism.\\" Dore Gold, President of the Israeli think tank Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs (JCPA), believes there is a \\"campaign to delegitimize Israel\\" based on three themes, a \\"denial of Israel's right to security\\", \\"portrayal of Israel as a criminal state\\", and \\"denial of Jewish history\\". Elhanan Yakira, professor of philosophy at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, also considers portrayal of Israel as \\"criminal\\" and denial of Jewish history, specifically the Holocaust, to be key to a delegitimizing narrative.Elhanan Yakira. Post- Zionism, Post-Holocaust: Three Essays on Denial, Forgetting, and the Delegitimation of Israel. Cambridge University Press, 2009. . pp. 36‚Äì46 Alan Dershowitz believes that other standard lines of argument include claims of Israel's \\"colonial\\" nature, a belief that statehood was not granted \\"legally\\", the apartheid analogy, and the necessity of a one-state solution.Alan Dershowitz. \\"Countering Challenges to Israel's Legitimacy\\". Israel's Rights as a Nation-State in International Diplomacy. Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, 2011. According to Irwin Cotler, the lopsided number of anti-Israel resolutions passed by the UN is an example of delegitimization. Canadian ex- Foreign Minister John Baird has characterized Israel‚Äôs delegitimization as the new antisemitism. =Legitimacy rhetoric as distraction= M.J. Rosenberg, writing in the Los Angeles Times, argued that the term \\"delegitimization\\" is a \\"distraction\\", whose purpose is to divert attention away from world opposition to the \\"illegitimate\\" occupation of the West Bank and blockade of the Gaza Strip, from the \\"illegal\\" settlements, and from \\"the ever-louder calls for Israel to grant Palestinians equal rights\\". He concludes that \\"It's not the Palestinians who are delegitimizing Israel, but the Israeli government, which maintains the occupation. And the leading delegitimizer is Netanyahu, whose contemptuous rejection of peace is turning Israel into an international pariah.\\" Dangers of delegitimization to peace According to Gerald Steinberg writing for JCPA, attacks on Israel's legitimacy are a barrier to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian peace process. Amos Yadlin, former head of Israeli intelligence said that \\"delegitimization of Israel is a graver threat than war.\\" Thomas Friedman, writing in the New York Times, says \\"for 100 years, through violence and delegitimization, Israelis and Palestinians have made sure that the other was never allowed to really feel at home in Israel.\\" Delegitimization of the adversary, among all the psychological themes, is said to be \\"one of the major detrimental forces that turns a conflict to be vicious and violent, while preventing its peaceful resolution.\\" US President Barack Obama said in a May 2011 speech \\"for the Palestinians, efforts to delegitimize Israel will end in failure. Symbolic actions to isolate Israel at the United Nations in September won't create an independent state.\\" In 2012, the president said, \\"whenever an effort is made to delegitimize the State of Israel, my administration has opposed them.\\" Irwin Cotler, former Canadian Attorney General, said that delegitimization is \\"masked under the current discourse\\". It is hidden in the anti-Israel resolutions passed by the UN, universal jurisdiction is \\"often abused\\" regarding Israel, it is \\"laundered under the cover of human rights\\", and is hidden behind the use of accusations of racism and apartheid. Delegitimization is seen as a threat to Israel's security. Demands for Israel to not enter into Gaza and defeat Hamas during Operation Pillar of Defense are characterized by David Schwartz as a \\"delegitimization of Israel's right to defend itself.\\" Tzipi Livni said that \\"the threat of delegitimization intensifies other threats facing Israel, and limits our ability to protect ourselves.\\" Legitimacy and Israeli uniqueness Professor Emanuel Adler of the University of Toronto considers Israel as willing to accept a situation where its legitimacy may be challenged, because it sees itself as occupying a unique place in the world order.Emanuel Adler. Israel in the World: Legitimacy and Exceptionalism. Routledge, 2012. p. 1 Stacie E.

Noam Chomsky has described her contributions to the field of linguistics as \\"original and highly influential,\\" particularly regarding \\"syntactic structure and operations, referential dependence, principles of lexical semantics and their implications for syntactic organization, unified approaches to cross- linguistic semantic interpretation of complex structures that appear superficially to vary widely, the theory of stress and intonation, efficient parsing systems, the interaction of internal computations with thought and sensorimotor systems, optimal design as a core principle of language, and much else.\\"Noam Chomsky, \\"In Memory of Tanya Reinhart\\", 19 March 2007 Reinhart's academic work also extended well beyond linguistics, to that of literary theory, mass media, propaganda, and other core elements of intellectual culture. Political activism Chomsky has noted Reinhart's activism was not limited to words and that she was often on \\"the front line of direct resistance to intolerable actions, an organizer and a participant, a stance that one cannot respect too highly.\\" Commenting on her death, he wrote that Reinhart would be remembered \\"not only as a resolute and honorable defender of the rights of Palestinians, but also as one of those who have struggled to defend the moral integrity of her own Israeli society, and its hope for decent survival.\\" Reinhart was an outspoken critic both of Israel's invasion and occupation of Lebanon and its occupation of the Palestinian territories after 1967, the latter of which she came to regard as worse than Apartheid. She was active in organizing solidarity campaigns with her Palestinian colleagues at Bir Zeit University. Her position was that Israel should abandon the West Bank and Gaza: > Israel should withdraw immediately from the territories occupied in 1967. > The bulk of Israeli settlers (150,000 of them) are concentrated in the big > settlement blocks in the center of the West bank. These areas cannot be > evacuated over night. But the rest of the land (about 90%‚Äì96% of the West > bank and the whole of the Gaza strip) can be evacuated immediately. Many of > the residents of the isolated Israeli settlements that are scattered in > these areas are speaking openly in the Israeli media about their wish to > leave. It is only necessary to offer them reasonable compensation for the > property they will be leaving behind. The rest ‚Äî the hard-core \\"land > redemptions\\" fanatics ‚Äî are a negligible minority that will have to accept > the will of the majority. Israel/Palestine: How To End The War Of 1948, > Znet, November 08, 2002 Reinhart pointed out that immediate withdrawal would still leave under debate between six and ten percent of the West Bank with the large settlement blocks, as well as the issues of Jerusalem and the right of return, and maintains that these should be the subject of \\"serious peace negotiations\\". In 2002, Reinhart was heavily criticized in Israel for signing a European petition calling for a moratorium on European support of Israeli academia in protest of Israel's Palestinian policies. She expressed sympathy and understanding for her colleagues who opposed such measures but insisted that: > It is not easy for an Israeli academic to support the calls for boycott of > Israeli academic institutions these days. Like any other segment of the > Israeli society, the universities are paying the price of Israel's war > against the Palestinians, with severe budget cuts and deteriorating research > conditions. A freeze of the EU funds would, no doubt, make things even > tougher. It is therefore understandable that the Israeli academia is > mobilising its forces to attack any such boycott attempt. Understandable, > but not just. The same year, she also published a book, Israel/Palestine: How to End the War of 1948, in which she analyzed what she saw as the breakdown during the preceding three years of constructive engagement over the Palestinian issue and the hardening of the Israeli position. Reinhart gave the 2006 Edward Said Memorial Lecture at Adelaide University. Saying she could no longer live in Israel due to its treatment of Palestinians in the Occupied Territories, Reinhart moved to New York in December 2006.Israeli Author, Peace Activist Tanya Reinhart Dies at 63 , Democracy Now, March 19, 2007 Tanya Reinhart was married to Israeli poet and translator Aharon Shabtai.

Due to their bright pigmentation and fluorescence under ultraviolet light, Ricordea florida is very popular in hobby saltwater aquariums. Morphology Ricordea florida is a coral without a skeleton, having the same internal anatomical structure as corals of the order Scleractinia. The body of the coral is small and cylindrical. The basal end resembles a flat disk that functions as a foot. The apical end is the oral disk which functions as one or more mouths. These mouths are centered amid short rounded tentacles bearing cnidocytes, whose sting contains paralytic neurotoxins. The sting is used to subdue prey to make it more easily ingested via the mouth, or as a defensive mechanism to evade enemies. The stinging ability of this species is lower than in most corals. Ricordea florida reaches 7.5 cm in diameter. The fleshy body and tentacles can be found in a variety of colours, including purple, orange, green, blue and yellow. The tips of the tentacles and the mouth may be one or more different colours. The colour of Ricordea florida depends on various factors, including the depth at which they live, the temperature, the season, and other environmental factors. Habitat and distribution Ricordea florida is found in the interior of reefs, usually in shallow water, rocky areas, and pools. It is found alone or in small groups. They are known to inhabit the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. Food As with other corals, Ricordea florida is host to a symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae. These algae undergo photosynthesis producing oxygen and sugars which are then used by the coral. The zooxanthellae also feed on the catabolites of the coral (especially phosphorus and nitrogen). Ricordea florida feed both on the products of zooxanthellae, and on zooplankton or fish they catch with their tentacles, along with dissolved organic matter in the water. Reproduction Asexual reproduction can be accomplished by two mechanisms. Split or fission reproduction occurs when the coral splits along its mouth creating a clone. Alternatively, particulates released from the foot can develop into a new specimen, which is called laceration. Sexual reproduction produces a larva called a planula which once on the seabed develops into a new individual.

Ovoid images matching the outline of uchiwa were printed on rectangular sheets of washi rice paper, then cut along the margins and pasted onto a skeletal bamboo frame.Bell 2004, xivMarks 2010, 14 Late Edo period uchiwa-e print of bugaku dancers Uchiwa characteristics Unlike folding hand fans, which originated in Japan in the sixth or seventh century,Halsey and Friedman 1983, 556 non-folding flat, oval or \\"bean-shaped\\"Newland 2005, 431 uchiwa were a Chinese import. In terms of popular usage, uchiwa had a close connection with Edo urban culture which gained momentum during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Folding fans, known as ≈çgi (Êâá), suehiro (Êú´Â∫É) or sensu (ÊâáÂ≠ê), remained the dominant accessory within the realm of the sophisticated court culture prevailing in Kyoto at the time. The actor Ichikawa Ebijuro I by Toyokuni I Historically, uchiwa were an ostensibly feminine accessory, with men more typically carrying folding fans.Salter 2006, 25 They were simultaneously fashion accessories and functional items for daily use.Newland 2005, 431 They are strongly associated with summer, having been sold only during the summer months, and often decorated with summer imagery.Salter 2006, 25 At least one critic argues that, due to their use by women during periods of intense heat, uchiwa \\"can have suggestive connotations.\\"Salter 2006, 79 Uchiwa are used by many today as devices for personal cooling, as well as for fanning rice to cool it in the preparation of sushi. More ceremonially, they can still be seen in a number of contexts, including a variety of summer dance performances and as an accessory carried by referees during sumo matches. Uchiwa-e history Uchiwa with printed designs were first produced in Japan sometime in or prior to the 1680s.Newland 2005, 431 One of the earliest extant examples is a 1684 ehon (picture book) by Hishikawa Moronobu (Ëè±Â∑ùÂ∏´ÂÆ£) entitled Uchiwa zukushi (Uchiwa Pictures of Every Variety), which includes illustrations within fan-shaped frames.Newland 2005, 431 Other notable examples placing uchiwa-e within a socio-historical context are prints by Suzuki Harunobu (Èà¥Êú®Êò•‰ø°) from 1767 or 1768 featuring uchiwa uri (fan sellers), and an 1814 print by Utagawa Kunisada depicting kabuki actor Ichikawa Dannosuke II in the role of a fan vendor.Newland 2005, 432 Hishikawa Moronobu - Uchiwae zukushi One historical fan vendor about whom we still have a good deal of information is Ebiya Rinnosuke (Êµ∑ËÄÅÂ±ãÊûó‰πãÂä©) (1832‚Äì1895). Ebiya printed and sold both fan and standard- sized prints until around 1895. Although Ebiya's publishing house originally commissioned designs from Utagawa Kunisada and Utagawa Kuniyoshi exclusively, they expanded their roster to include other artists from the late 1850s.Marks 2010, 27 During the nineteenth century, the production of uchiwa-e and ≈çgi-e prints was under the strict control of a guild of fan publishers operating under a system of rules and regulations different from those applying to regular published prints.Newland 2005, 432 Beginning in 1815 and lasting to the end of the Edo period (1603-1868), fan prints were commonly marked with seals indicating their year of publication.Newland 2005, 432 Examples Most, if not all, major Edo period woodblock print artists worked within the uchiwa-e medium in addition to with standard prints and illustrated books. Uchiwa-e designs fall into all of the major categories of prints, including yakusha-e (actor prints), bijin-ga (beauties), f≈´kei-ga (landscapes), kach≈ç-ga (nature prints) and Musha-e (warrior prints).Newland 2005, 431 Some notable uchiwa-e works which survive in collections today are by Katsukawa Shunsh≈ç (1726-1793), Utagawa Toyokuni (1769-1825), Kunisada (1786-1865), Kuniyoshi (1797-1861) and Hiroshige (1797-1858).Newland 2005, 432 Uchiwa are by definition accessories intended for practical, everyday use. As a result of their frequent handling, few pristine mounted examples of uchiwa-e remain.Harris 2010, 106 For this reason, art historian Amy Reigle Newland has suggested that uchiwa-e \\"are probably among the most elusive of all categories of ukiyo-e prints to study and collect.\\" (2005, 431) See also * Fan print with two bugaku dancers (Kunisada) Notes References * Bell, David.

One of the largest sites, Lolita City, hosted by Freedom Hosting, was Denial-of-service attacked (DDoS), and later had its member list leaked following a SQL injection attack, as was The Hidden Wiki which linked to it. Federal investigation News reports linked a Firefox browser vulnerability to a United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) operation targeting Freedom Hosting's owner, Eric Eoin Marques. In August 2013, it was discovered that the Firefox browsers in many older versions of the Tor Browser Bundle were vulnerable to a JavaScript attack, as NoScript was not enabled by default. This attack was being exploited to send users' MAC and IP addresses and Windows computer names to the attackers. The FBI acknowledged they were responsible for the attack in a September 12, 2013 court filing in Dublin; further technical details from a training presentation leaked by Edward Snowden showed that the codename for the exploit was EgotisticalGiraffe.

Disagreements with corporations Activists argue that corporate globalization corresponds to a displacement in the transition from a highly industrial-based economy to one where trade development is connected to the financial deregulation on the basis of circulation of capital. An increasing number of diverse societies have changed to free-market structure, which leads to displacement. Due to this expansion, market-governed regulation has outrun the grasps of the state. Opponents of corporate globalization hold that the government needs greater power to control the markets, that income inequality is increasing, and that corporations have gained too much power. As part of the political left, activists against corporate power and influence support a decreased income gap and improved economical equity. Counter-arguments The defenders of corporations such as Ron Arnold highlight that governments do legislate in ways that restrict the actions of corporations (see Sarbanes-Oxley Act) and that lawbreaking companies and executives are routinely caught and punished, usually in the form of monetary fines. In addition, from the perspective of business ethics it is argued that chief executives are not inherently more evil than anyone else and so are no more likely to attempt unethical or illegal activity than the general population. Large multi-national corporations do continue to attempt to erode governmental regulations through in-house or contracted lobbyists who work closely with State and Federal legislators. So as corporate laws continue to lean in their favor, corporate members have improved portals to drive up company profits. Alliances Anti- corporate activists may often ally themselves with other activists, such as environmental activists or animal-rights activists in their condemnation of the practices of modern organizations such as the McDonald's Corporation (see McLibel) and forestry company Gunns Limited (see Gunns 20). In recent years, the number of books (Naomi Klein's 2000 No Logo being a well-known example) and films on the subject has increased such as The CorporationThe Corporation which have to a certain extent supported anti-corporate politics. Art activism An artist critical of sociopolitical agendas in business is conceptualist Hans Haacke. Anti-corporate web sites In June 2008, Cond√© Nast Publications released an article entitled \\"The Secret Seven\\" which it listed the top seven anti-corporate web sites which include: WikiLeaks, Mini- Microsoft, Wal-Mart Watch, HomeOwners for Better Building, Brenda Priddy and Company (automotive spy photos) and finally Apple Rumor Sites AppleInsider and MacRumors. New digital media Media and digital networking have become important features of modern anti-corporate movements. The speed, flexibility, and ability to reach a massive potential audience has provided a technological foundation for contemporary network social movement structure. As a result, communities and interpersonal connections have transformed. The internet supports and strengthens local ties, but also facilitates new patterns for political activity. Activists have used this medium to operate between both the online and offline political spectrums. Email lists, web pages, and open editing software have allowed for changes within an organization. Now, actions are planned, information is shared, documents are produced by multiple people, and all of this can be done despite differences in distance. This has led to increased growth in digital collaboration. Activists can presently build ties between diverse topics, open the distribution of information, decentralize and increase collaboration, and self-direct networks. Rise of anti-corporate globalization Close to fifty thousand people protested the WTO meetings in Seattle on November 30, 1999. Labor, economic, and environmental activists succeeded in disrupting and closing the meetings due to their disapproval of corporate globalization. This event became a symbol as anti-globalization networks emerged and became strengthened. The experiences from the protests were distributed throughout the internet via emails and websites. Anti- corporate globalization movements have also expanded through the organization of mass mobilizations, including the anti-WTO protests, which were remarkably successful. In the United States, these movements reemerged after less attention was given to the war in Iraq, resulting in an increase in mass mobilizations.

Loudermilk won the Republican nomination for the seat in a runoff on July 22, 2014, over Bob Barr, and won the general election on November 4, 2014. He won reelection to a second term in the U.S. House on November 8, 2016. Early life and career Loudermilk was born in Riverdale, Georgia, and attended the Community College of the Air Force to receive his Associate of Applied Science in 1987 before going on to receive his Bachelor of Science from Wayland Baptist University in 1992. He was a member of the Georgia State Senate for almost three years, representing the 14th district. He previously served in the Georgia House of Representatives from 2005 until 2011. Loudermilk resigned from the state Senate on August 27, 2013, to focus on his congressional bid. Loudermilk is a native of Georgia. He entered politics in 2001, when he was elected as Chairman of the Bartow County Republican Party until 2004. He was subsequently elected to the State House. Loudermilk was elected to the State Senate in 2010, and was sworn in during 2011. As a state senator, he served as Chair to the Senate Science and Technology Committee and as Secretary to the Veterans, Military and Homeland Security and Public Safety Committees.

In September 2017, the Georgia-based credit bureau Equifax revealed a data breach that affected 143 million Americans and was characterized by technology journalists as \\"very possibly the worst leak of personal info ever to have happened\\". Four months earlier, Loudermilk, who had received $2,000 in campaign contributions from Equifax as part of an extensive lobbying effort, introduced a bill that would reduce consumer protections in relation to the nation's credit bureaus, including capping potential damages in a class action suit to $500,000 regardless of class size or amount of loss.Weisbaum, Herb, ‚ÄúRepublicans in Congress Want to Roll Back Regulations on Credit Bureaus‚Äù, NBC News, September 11, 2017, Retrieved September 18, 2017 The bill would also eliminate all punitive damages. Following criticism by consumer advocates, Loudermilk agreed to delay consideration of the bill \\"pending a full and complete investigation into the Equifax breach.\\" =Committee assignments= *Committee on Financial Services **Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit **Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations *Committee on Science, Space, and Technology **Subcommittee on Environment **Subcommittee on Oversight *Committee on House Administration =Caucus memberships= * Republican Study Committee * U.S.-Japan Caucus Political positions Loudermilk has an 83 percent score from conservative political advocacy group Heritage Action for his voting record. = Health care = Loudermilk supports reforming Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security.

He compared the 2017 efforts by the Republicans to repeal the health care act to the American Revolutionary War and World War II. Loudermilk did not vaccinate his children against the mumps or measles. He believes that it is up to parents, not the government, to decide if children receive vaccines. =Donald Trump= Loudermilk said he considers the presidency of Donald Trump a \\"movement\\" and has praised the concept of \\"Make America Great Again.\\" Loudermilk has credited Paul Ryan, rather than Trump, with Republican success in Congress. In 2017, Loudermilk called Ryan a \\"revolutionary thinker.\\" In December 2019, amid the impeachment inquiry into President Trump, Loudermilk likened the impeachment of Trump to the crucifixion of Jesus. Loudermilk stated, on the Congressional record, \\"When Jesus was falsely accused of treason, Pontius Pilate gave Jesus the opportunity to face his accusers. ... During that sham trial, Pontius Pilate afforded more rights to Jesus than the Democrats have afforded this President in this process.\\" PolitiFact noted that experts on religion said that Jesus did not have the right to face his accusers. Trump, on the other hand, did have an opportunity to present a defense. = Economic issues = In 2016, Loudermilk was named a \\"defender of economic freedom\\" by the Club for Growth for his conservative voting record around the economy.

He supports the right to life movement and states that \\"Life is the ultimate right endowed by God and it is the responsibility of governments to protect that right not to destroy it.\\" = LGBT rights = Loudermilk opposed same-sex marriage up to and upon its legalization, believing it should be decided by states.

Cohen is especially familiar with east Jerusalem, the topic of his book, Kikar Hashuk Reka (The Marketplace is Empty or: The Rise and Fall of Arab Jeruslaem), because of the years he spent as a correspondent for east Jerusalem affairs for the Israeli weekly Kol Ha'ir.

The group is named after a former policeman Mohammed Atef, aka Abu Hafs, of Egypt, who was a member of Ayman al-Zawahiri's al-Jihad al-Islami (Islamic Jihad). Al-Masri means \\"the Egyptian\\" in Arabic. He became a relative to Osama bin Laden, the al-Qaeda leader, after his daughter married bin Laden's son, Mohammed bin Laden. He was killed by U.S. airstrikes in Afghanistan in late 2001. He has been adopted as a \\"martyr\\" to the fundamentalist cause. Claimed attacks The London-based Arabic language newspaper Al-Quds al-Arabi has received letters from this group, in which it has claimed responsibility for: * the blackout of August 14, 2003 in the northeastern United States and Canada; * the attack on the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad on August 19, 2003; * the bombing of two synagogues in Turkey on November 15, 2003 and the British consulate and HSBC bank in Istanbul on November 20; * a hotel bombing in Jakarta, Indonesia in 2003; * the 11 March 2004 Madrid attacks; * a letter published July 2, 2004 endorsing the three months Al Qaeda ultimatum against Europe of April 14, 2004 * The terrorist bombings in London in July 2005 Credibility There is no clearly defined stance on the existence of the Brigades can be discerned on the part of the jihadist radical community. By and large, terrorist organisations have disregarded their statements and avoided including any reference in their own messages that might be construed as representing support for the Brigades or, conversely, a desire to dismiss them as a fraud. This indifference has been shared even by those groups who claimed responsibility for an act of terrorism previously claimed by the Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigades. The group has merited mention by only a handful of radical preachers and even they have arrived at contradictory conclusions . For example, Omar Bakri, leader of the fundamentalist ‚Äúal-Muhajiroun‚Äù group, stated that the claim of responsibility by the Brigades for the Madrid train bombings ‚Äúwas genuine‚Äù, whereas Abu Hamzah al-Masri, another of the London-based ‚Äúpreachers of hate‚Äù, denied that al-Qaeda (via the Brigades) could be behind ‚Äúsuch a criminal act‚Äù and defended its position of never referring publicly to the Brigades because ‚Äúsometimes they [al-Qaeda] leave people to speak whatever they want to speak for, as long as they support them and they try to get the people around them‚Äù. At least some of these claims are regarded as being false. The August 2003 power failure in the US, which the group called Operation Quick Lightning in the Land of the Tyrant of This Generation has been shown to be caused by a large- scale technical failure rather than terrorist actions. Turkey claims that the Turkish Hizbullah was responsible for the Istanbul bombings while the UN headquarters in Baghdad was blamed on Baathists. The Jakarta bombing was carried out by Jemaah Islamiya, an Indonesian group, according to Indonesian and US officials. The group's involvement with the March 11, 2004 attacks is also uncertain; Spain originally pointed the finger for the train bombings at the domestic terrorist group ETA, although it later transpired that Islamist militants were behind it. According to the group's letter to Al-Quds, it calls the attacks \\"The Trains of Death Operation\\". It also claims that it has completed 90% of the preparation for a new attack on the US, which it calls Winds of Black Death. The name is speculated to come from Iraq's use of poison gas on Kurds - which Physicians for Human Rights has named the \\"Winds of Death\\" - and the black skin lesions on anthrax victims. Some are skeptical if this group actually exists. The only hard evidence is through communiqu√©s, usually sent via the Internet, to the Al-Quds al-Arabi newspaper in the UK. Another previously unknown group calling itself the Lions of Al-Mufridun also has decided to claim credit for the Madrid attack, perhaps attempting to copy Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigades.

The original bill (HB 707) was eventually attached to HB 943 through the ‚ÄúLindsey Amendment.‚Äù * HB 973 ‚Äì Medicaid False Claims Act (Sponsor): This bill updates and expands the Georgia Medicaid False Claims Act which Rep. Lindsey originally sponsored in 2007. * HB 141 ‚Äì Assisting Victims of Human Trafficking in obtaining help (Sponsor): In 2001, Georgia made a giant leap forward in the passage of HB 200 to attack the horrible crime of human trafficking. This hear, HB 141 is an additional step in the right direction by requiring places where the victims of human trafficking are likely to be found such as bars, hotels, bus stations, and massage parlors to post a notice developed by the GBI alerting the victims of a 1-800 hotline number that can provide immediate law enforcement and social services help to the victims. The program is already operating in twelve other states and has helped thousands of victims escape from the dark web of this 21st century form of slavery. * HB 361 & HB 362/HB 179 ‚Äì Strengthening Georgia's Right to Work Laws (Sponsor): Georgia has economically benefited from its Right to Work policy and other states such as Indiana and Michigan are beginning to also recognize its benefit. HB 361 and HB 362/SB 179 strengthen this policy. HB 361 allows workers to leave a union at any time and stop payroll deductions immediately if they feel the union is unresponsive to their needs. HB 362/SB179 bars the state or any local government from mandating that a bidder on a public works project use union labor. (HB 362 passed the House and was then attached to SB 179 which passed both chambers.) 151st Georgia General Assembly (2011‚Äì2012) * HR 1162/HB 744 ‚Äì State Charter Schools (Co- Sponsor): This constitutional amendment and enabling legislation will make it easier to create charter schools in Georgia and provide parents and children greater choices and education opportunities. * HB 1176 ‚Äì Criminal Justice Reform (Co-Sponsor): This legislation makes it easier for the criminal justice system in Georgia to distinguish and treat differently those we are afraid of versus those that we are merely mad at. We should always have space in our prisons for those violent and dangerous criminals that seek to do us harm. However, a great many criminals ‚Äìparticularly ‚Äìdrug offenders should be dealt with through alternative sentencing programs that focus on rehabilitation and recovery. This legislation is an important step forward in that effort. * HB 87 ‚Äì Illegal Immigration Reform and Enforcement Act (Co-Sponsor): This legislation requires employers to use e verify to confirm legal status of all job applicants and toughens sanctions against illegal aliens to protect citizens and legal residents in Georgia. * HB 232 ‚Äì Ethics Reform (Sponsor): This legislation clarifies and distinguishes between what constitutes lobbying in Georgia as opposed to ordinary citizens exercising their First Amendment rights to petition their government. 150th Georgia General Assembly (2009‚Äì2010) * HB 233 ‚Äì Moratorium on Property Reassessment Increases (Sponsor): This legislation imposes a three-year moratorium on increased property reassessments for tax purposes to protect property owners during the current economic crisis. 149th Georgia General Assembly (2007‚Äì2008) * HB 551 ‚Äì Georgia False Medicare/Medicaid Claims Act (Sponsor): This legislation provides for civil remedies to sue those entities which engage in fraudulent Medicare/Medicaid activity. * HB 369 ‚Äì Child Custody Reform (Co- Sponsor): This legislation provides for greater definition of what constitutes the \\"best interest of the child,\\" encourages greater cooperation between the parents, requires expedited rulings in contested custody cases, and allows for direct appeal of child custody orders. 148th Georgia General Assembly (2005‚Äì2006) * HB 37 ‚Äì City of Sandy Springs (Co-Sponsor): This legislation finally allows for the creation of the City of Sandy Springs. * SB 100 ‚Äì Georgia Residential Mortgage Fraud Act (House Sponsor): This legislation gives the Georgia Attorney General the power to investigate and prosecute mortgage fraud and provide for enhanced penalties under Georgia's RICO statute Awards and recognition =State legislator= In the state legislature, among many others, Lindsey was named the Georgia Chamber of Commerce and National Federation of Independent Businesses Legislator of the Year in 2013.

In 2003, Oleksandr was convicted and imprisoned for 8 years for a vehicle arson. The couple states that imprisonment was result of a business dispute and the reason for Anastasiya's out-of-need family-supporting porn career. Anastasiya claims her first porn shooting took place in Russia in 2004, where she was paid $500 per week, considerable money for Ukraine at that time. Between 2004 and 2008, Anastasiya, nicknamed Wiska, starred in over 40 pornographic films, including at least one movie with Rocco Siffredi. Circa 2007, Wiska's identity was revealed in Ukraine after a family interview for one of the local tabloids, which attracted journalistic interest and launched her as a national celebrity posing for mainstream media.  Persecution  In 2010, Ukrainian authorities began investigating Anastasiya's family living in Feodosia on the legal grounds of child abuse (including forensic examination of her children for possible sexual assault) and production and distribution of pornography (illegal in Ukraine since 2009).–£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è –ø–æ—Ä–Ω–æ–∑–≤–µ–∑–¥–∞ –ê–Ω–∞—Å—Ç–∞—Å–∏—è –ì–†–ò–®–ê–ô (WISKA): ¬´–¢–µ, –∫—Ç–æ –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ—Ä—è–ª –Ω–∞—à—É —Å–µ–º—å—é, —Å–æ–±–∏—Ä–∞–ª–∏—Å—å –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏ –º–µ–¥–∏—Ü–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π –æ—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä –º–æ–∏—Ö –¥–µ—Ç–µ–π ‚Äî –¥–≤—É—Ö–ª–µ—Ç–Ω–µ–≥–æ –û—Å–∫–∞—Ä–∞ –∏ –≤–æ—Å—å–º–∏–ª–µ—Ç–Ω–µ–≥–æ –°–∞—à–∏ ‚Äî –Ω–∞ –Ω–∞–ª–∏—á–∏–µ —Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤ –ø–æ–ª–æ–≤–æ–≥–æ –∞–∫—Ç–∞. –£–∂–∞—Å! –ü—Å–∏—Ö–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è —Ç—Ä–∞–≤–º–∞ –Ω–∞ –≤—Å—é –∂–∏–∑–Ω—å!¬ª The persecution was initiated by Leonid Hrach, then representing the Autonomous Republic of Crimea in Verkhovna Rada.

Their ideology, known as Narodism or ' (; , similar to the German ), was a form of agrarian socialism though is often mistranslated as populism or peopleism. The (; meaning 'going to the people') campaigns were the central impetus of the Narodnik movement. The Narodniks were in many ways the intellectual and political forebears and, in notable cases, direct participants of the Russian Revolution‚Äîin particular of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, which went on to greatly influence Russian history in the 20th century. History Narodnichestvo as a philosophy was influenced by the works of Alexander Herzen (1812‚Äì1870) and Nikolay Gavrilovich Chernyshevsky (1828‚Äì1889), whose convictions were refined by Pyotr Lavrov (1823-1900) and Nikolay Mikhaylovsky (1842‚Äì1904). In the late 19th century, socialism and capitalism were slowly becoming the primary theories of Russian political thought, and Mikhaylovsky, realizing this shift in thought, began to tweak his original ideas of Narodnism, such that two groups of Narodniks emerged: the so-called \\"Critical Narodniks\\" and \\"Doctrinaire Narodniks\\". Critical Narodniks followed Mikhaylovsky, and assumed a very flexible stance on capitalism, whilst adhering to their basic orientation. The more well-known Doctrinaire Narodniks had a firm belief that capitalism had no future in Russia or in any agrarian country. Narodnichestvo arose after the emancipation of the serfs in 1861 under Tsar Alexander II, which signaled the end of feudalism in Russia. Arguing that freed serfs were being sold into wage slavery, in which the bourgeoisie had replaced landowners, Narodnism aimed to become a political force opposed to the phenomenon. They supported the existing obshchina system of communes and wanted to strengthen peasant self- governance. Narodniki established semi-underground circles (–∫—Ä—É–∂–∫–∏) such as the Chaikovsky Circle and Land and Liberty, with the goals of self-education and external propaganda work. They shared the common general aims of destroying the Russian monarchy and of distributing land fairly among the peasantry. The Narodniks generally believed that it was possible to forgo the capitalist phase of Russia's development and proceed directly to socialism. The Narodniks saw the peasantry as the revolutionary class that would overthrow the monarchy, and perceived the village commune as the embryo of socialism. However, they also believed that the peasantry would not achieve revolution on their own, insisting instead that history could only be made by outstanding personalities, who would lead an otherwise passive peasantry to revolution. Vasily Vorontsov called for the Russian intelligentsia to \\"bestir itself from the mental lethargy into which, in contrast to the sensitive and lively years of the seventies, it had fallen and formulate a scientific theory of Russian economic development\\". However, some Narodnik intellectuals called for an immediate revolution that went beyond philosophical and political discussion. In the spring of 1874, the Narodnik intelligentsia left the cities for the villages, Going to the People in an attempt to uplift the peasantry their moral imperative to revolt. They found almost no support. Given the Narodniks' generally middle- and upper-middle-class social background, they found difficulty relating to the impoverished peasants and their culture. They spent much of their time learning peasant customs, such as clothing and peasant labor. Narodniks were viewed with suspicion by many Russian peasants, who were completely removed from the more modernized culture of the urban sphere. The authorities responded to the Narodniks' attempt with repression: revolutionaries and their peasant sympathizers were imprisoned and exiled. Arrest of a Propagandist (1892) by Ilya Repin. One response to this repression was the formation of Russia's first organized revolutionary party, Narodnaya Volya (\\"People's Will\\"), in June 1879. It favoured secret society-led terrorism, justified ‚Äúas a means of exerting pressure on the government for reform, as the spark that would ignite a vast peasant uprising, and as the inevitable response to the regime's use of violence against the revolutionaries‚Äù. The attempt to get the peasantry to overthrow the Tsar proved unsuccessful, due to the peasantry's idolisation of the latter as someone \\"on their side\\". Narodism therefore developed the practice of terrorism: the peasantry, they believed, had to be shown that the Tsar was not supernatural, and could be killed. This theory, called \\"direct struggle\\", intended \\"uninterrupted demonstration of the possibility of struggling against the government, in this manner lifting the revolutionary spirit of the people and its faith in the success of the cause, and organising those capable of fighting\\".Narodnaya Volya program of 1879. On March 1, 1881, they succeeded in assassinating Alexander II. This act backfired on a political level, because the peasantry were generally horrified by the murder, and the government had many Narodnaya Volya leaders hanged, leaving the group unorganized and ineffective. However, these events did not mark the end of the movement, and the later Socialist-Revolutionaries, Popular Socialists, and Trudoviks all pursued similar ideas and tactics to the Narodniks. The philosophy and actions of the Narodniks therefore helped prepare the way for the Russian revolutions of 1905 and 1917. Challenges The Narodnik movement was a populist initiative to engage the rural classes of Russia in a political debate that would overthrow the Tsar‚Äôs government in the nineteenth century. Unlike the French Revolution or the European Revolutions of 1848, the ‚Äúto the people‚Äù movement was political activism primarily by the Russian intelligentsia. These individuals were generally anti-capitalist, and they believed that they could facilitate both an economic and a political revolution amongst rural Russians by ‚Äúgoing to‚Äù and educating the peasant classes. The concept of the narod, like the volk in Germany, was an attempt to establish a new national identity in Russia that was both nationalistic and liberal. Fyodor Dostoevsky said that ‚Äúnone of us like the narod as they actually are, but only as each of us has imagined them.‚Äù Russian political activists and government officials often claimed to be working to improve the lives of Russian peasants; in reality, they were manipulating the image of the peasant to further their own political objectives. Narodniks saw the peasant commune as a Russia that had not been tainted by western influence; Alexander Herzen wrote that the narod was ‚Äúthe official Russia; the real Russia.‚Äù Hampered by a biased understanding of the peasantry, the Narodniks struggled, mostly unsuccessfully, to relate to the peasantry. Rural Russians were typically highly devoted to the Tsar and to the Orthodox Church; not understanding this, the Narodnik rhetoric blamed the Tsar and centralized religion for the peasants‚Äô lack of land and material resources. Another example of the cultural disconnect between the intelligentsia and the peasants in the ‚Äúto the people‚Äù movement was the Narodniks propagandizing through pamphlets when virtually all poor Russians were illiterate. In essence, the Narodnik movement in 1874 failed because they approached the peasants as though the peasants were intellectuals like themselves. Radicals in the latter part of the 1870s would learn that their concept of the narod was flawed, and intellectuals would have to instead make themselves into peasants to have success in the movement and begin a revolution against the government of Alexander II. Nikolay Chernyshevsky‚Äôs ‚Äúanthropological principle‚Äù held that all humans, regardless of class, have many intrinsic similarities, and intellectuals saw in the peasants a purified version of themselves that could be radicalized; time demonstrated that this was simply not the case. Disunity between Bakunists and Lavrists, and Narodnik circles acting on independent initiative, were a further obstacle. The Bakunists believed revolution among the peasantry and populist uprisings in Russia would begin in the immediate future, the latter believed that propaganda should precede revolution, and the process would be more gradual. Bakunists believed that the peasants were ready to revolt with little propagandizing, whereas the Lavrists thought that considerable effort would be needed for the uprisings to begin. A lack of ideological unity resulted in varied approaches to the movement, and because of this the Narodniks no longer presented a united front to rural Russia. Some Narodniks believed in propagandizing by staying in one area for an extended period of time and assimilating into a commune that they were trying to revolutionize (‚Äúsettled‚Äù propaganda), and others practiced propagandizing by using pamphlets and literature to maximize the number of people that the message reached (‚Äúflying‚Äù propaganda). Disunity was prevalent even though Narodniks only traveled in three directions: either towards Volga, Dnieper, or Don. The Narodniki, who often took up work as nurses, scribes, schoolteachers, or participated in construction and harvest, struggled in unfamiliar terrain and poverty. All Narodniks resented foreign intervention into Russia, wanted Russian communes to control their own economic policies. Narodniks believed that the Tsar had impoverished the peasants, but Narodniks should have understood how highly the peasants regarded the Tsar. By failing to present a disciplined message and avoid directly attacking the Tsar, the Narodniki was often simply ignored. It was not until the formation of Narodnaya Volya in 1879 that young revolutionaries saw the need for organization and a disciplined message. This lack of unity is responsible for the third reason that the ‚Äúgoing to the people movement‚Äù failed; the peasants did not receive the intellectuals well. The reception that the intelligentsia received in the communes was so poor that it destroyed their idealized image of the peasant that was so common prior to 1874. The Narodniks saw peasants as a unified body; they thought that all peasants dressed poorly, so intellectuals dressed as poorly as was possible in order to fit in. In actuality, the peasants saw a poorly dressed person as a person with no authority or credibility. Accordingly, intellectuals dressing as they imagined the peasant dressed had an adverse effect; it actually made peasants suspicious of the intellectuals. Furthermore, Narodnik propaganda failed to address the more mundane, ordinary concerns of the peasantry. The everyday troubles of a rural Russian‚Äîa lack of material goods, poor healthcare, etc.‚Äîleft little time for discussions of socialism or egoism. Feminism in the Narodnik movement was also hard for the peasantry to accept. Pre-Marxist revolutionaries believed in an unusually strong equality of sex, and educated noblewomen played major roles in radical movements in the latter decades of the nineteenth century. Russian revolutionary literature in the 1840s and 1850s linked the causes of emancipation of serfs with the emancipation of the Russian woman‚Äîthis literature was manifest in the Narodnik movement. The Narodniks promulgated Chernyshevskyan ideas of chaste cohabitation‚Äîthat men and women should live together with no sexual interactions‚Äîand gender equality. These concepts were extremely odd to most peasants, and they did not generally react well to them. Furthermore, Narodniks often lived in communes where non-married men and women slept and lived in the same rooms. To Orthodox Russian peasants in the 1870s, such disregard of gender norms were both offensive and off-putting. When you consider the fact that nearly 60% of Narodnik women were from wealthy classes it becomes clear why the Russian peasant could not relate to most intellectuals in the movement intellectually, economically or socially.Information on sex in the Narodnik movement was drawn from Historian Dmitri Pisarev writes that ‚Äúsensing their inability to act alone, the intelligent radical made the peasantry the instrument to realize their hopes.‚Äù As historian Daniel Field wrote, however, ‚ÄúNarodniks found that the peasant desire for land was not accompanied by a wish to rebel.‚Äù The Russian government did not look favorably on the Narodniks advocating their overthrow, and peasants would only abide Narodniks so long as no criminal connections could be drawn to them. The Narodniks believed that the peasants were the class in Russia most prone to revolution, yet the peasants were not ready for revolutionary action. Government suppression of the Narodniki resulted in mass trials that widely publicized the views of the Narodniki, and outraged the public. Between 1873 and 1877, the Russian police arrested 1,611 propagandists, of whom 15% were women. Radicals in the movement focused on Russia‚Äôs oppressive taxation and land laws, and their propaganda was viewed as a threat by Tsar Alexander II. He ordered the arrest and trial of known Narodniks and Narodnik sympathizers in the peasantry; peasants were forced to expose the Narodniks to the authorities to escape persecution themselves. Beginning in 1877, a long and slow trial of 193 Narodniks was conducted. The propagandists had to either operate covertly or face imprisonment.Statistics on the trials of Narodniks were borrowed from The more the government tried to repress the Narodniks, the more radical the Narodniks became. They grew increasingly selective in their membership, and their Zemlya i Volya (Land and Freedom) members would eventually evolve to form more terroristic organizations: Narodnaya Volya (The People‚Äôs Will) and Chornyperedel (Black Repartition). These groups sought to begin a revolution through violence, and when members of Narodnaya Volya killed Tsar Alexander in 1881, the larger Narodnik movement lost virtually all support in the communes and rural parts of Russia. Government oppression further radicalized the Narodniks, and the peasants could not support enhanced radicalization of the already radical intelligentsia. Influence Narodnichestvo had a direct influence on politics and culture in Romania, through the writings of Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea and the advocacy of the Bessarabian-born Constantin Stere (who was a member of Narodnaya Volya in his youth). The latter helped found various groups, included one formed around the literary magazine Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ, which he published along with Garabet IbrƒÉileanu and Paul Bujor. Stere and the Poporanist (from popor, Romanian for \\"people\\") movement eventually rejected revolution altogether. Nevertheless, he shared the Narodnik view that capitalism was not a necessary stage in the development of an agrarian country. This perspective, which contradicted traditional Marxism, also influenced Ion Mihalache's Peasants' Party and its successor, the National Peasants' Party, as well as the philosophy of Virgil Madgearu. The Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm detected a Narodnik influence on Bolshevist method. \\"Lenin‚Äôs Bolsheviks owe more than they have sometimes admitted to the experience and methods of work of the Buonarrotist-Narodnik tradition, though Marxist antiritualism has done its best to establish an atmosphere of deliberate and extreme matter-of-factness and colourlessness even in cloak- and-dagger activities which, as their popular name shows, tend to compensate for the extreme tension in which participants are involved by a certain amount of romanticism.\\" See also *Nihilist movement *Narodnaya Volya *Socialist Revolutionary Party *Group of Narodnik Socialists *Nakanune (newspaper) *Nikolai Danielson Notes Bibliography * Pedler, Anne. \\"Going to the People: The Russian Narodniki in 1874‚Äì5\\".

In the early Soviet Union, particularly Soviet Russia and Azerbaijan, kulak became a vague reference to property ownership among peasants who were considered \\"hesitant\\" allies of the revolution. The word kulak originally referred to former peasants in the Russian Empire who became wealthier during the Stolypin reform from 1906 to 1914. During the Russian Revolution, the label of kulak was used to chastise peasants who withheld grain from the Bolsheviks. According to Marxist‚ÄìLeninist political theories of the early 20th century, the kulaks were class enemies of the poorer peasants. Vladimir Lenin himself described them as \\"bloodsuckers, vampires, plunderers of the people and profiteers, who fatten on famine,\\" declaring revolution against them to liberate poor peasants, farm laborers, and proletariat (the much smaller class of urban and industrial workers). During the first five-year plan, Stalin's all-out campaign to take ownership and organisation from the peasantry meant that \\"peasants with a couple of cows or five or six acres [~2 ha] more than their neighbors\\" were labeled kulaks. Under dekulakization, government officials seized farms and killed some resisters, deported others to labor camps, and drove many to migrate to the cities following the loss of their property to the collective. Definitions alt= Soviet terminology divided the Russian peasants into three broad categories: # bednyak, or poor peasants; # serednyak, or mid- income peasants; and # kulak, the higher-income farmers who had larger farms. In addition, they had a category of batrak, landless seasonal agricultural workers for hire. The Stolypin reform created a new class of landowners by allowing peasants to acquire plots of land on credit from the large estate owners. They were to repay the credit (a kind of mortgage loan) from their farm earnings. By 1912, 16% of peasants (up from 11% in 1903) had relatively large endowments of over per male family member (a threshold used in statistics to distinguish between middle-class and prosperous farmers, i.e. the kulaks). At that time, an average farmer's family had 6 to 10 children. The number of such farmers amounted to 20% of the rural population, producing almost 50% of marketable grain. = 1917‚Äì18 = Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Bolsheviks considered only batraks and bednyaks as true allies of the Soviets and proletariat; serednyaks were considered unreliable, \\"hesitating\\" allies; and kulaks were identified as class enemies, as they owned land (this was later expanded to include those who owned livestock). However, a middle peasant who did not hire labor and was little engaged in trade \\"might yet (if he had a large family) hold three cows and two horses.\\" There were other measures that indicated the kulaks as not being especially prosperous. Both peasants and Soviet officials were often uncertain as to what constituted a 'kulak'. They often used the term to label anyone who had more property than was considered \\"normal,\\" according to subjective criteria, and personal rivalries played a part in the classification of enemies. Historian Robert Conquest argues: During the summer of 1918, Moscow sent armed detachments to the villages to seize grain. Any peasant who resisted was labeled a kulak: \\"The Communists declared war on the rural population for two purposes: to extract food for the cities and the Red Army and to insinuate their authority into the countryside, which remained largely unaffected by the Bolshevik coup.\\" A large-scale revolt ensued, and it was during this period, in August 1918, that Lenin sent a directive: > Hang (hang without fail, so the people see) no fewer than one hundred known > kulaks, rich men, bloodsuckers.‚Ä¶ Do it in such a way that for hundreds of > versts [kilometers] around the people will see, tremble, know, shout: they > are strangling and will strangle to death the bloodsucker kulaks. = 1930s = The average value of goods confiscated from kulaks during the policy of \\"dekulakization\\" () at the beginning of the 1930s was only 170‚Äì400 rubles (US $90‚Äì$210) per household. During the height of collectivization in the early 1930s, people who were identified as kulaks were subjected to deportation and extrajudicial punishment. They were often murdered in local violence while others were formally executed after conviction as kulaks. In May 1929, the Sovnarkom issued a decree that formalised the notion of 'kulak household' (), whereby any of the following defined a kulak: * Use of hired labor. * Ownership of a mill, a creamery (, 'butter-making rig'), other processing equipment, or a complex machine with a motor. * Systematic renting out of agricultural equipment or facilities. * Involvement in trade, money- lending, commercial brokerage, or \\"other sources of non-labor income.\\" By the last item, any peasant who sold his surplus goods on the market could be classified as a kulak. In 1930, this list was extended to include those who were renting industrial plants, e.g. sawmills, or who rented land to other farmers. At the same time, the ispolkoms (executive committees of local Soviets) of republics, oblasts, and krais were given rights to add other criteria for defining kulaks, depending on local conditions. Dekulakization In July 1929, it remained official Soviet policy that the kulaks should not be terrorized and should be enlisted into the collective farms. However, Stalin disagreed: > Now we have the opportunity to carry out a resolute offensive against the > kulaks, break their resistance, eliminate them as a class and replace their > production with the production of kolkhozes and sovkhozes. A decree by the Central Committee on January 5, 1930 was titled \\"On the pace of collectivization and state assistance to collective-farm construction.\\" Andrei Suslov argues that the seizure of peasants' property led directly to the destruction of an entire social group: the peasant‚Äêowners. The official goal of \\"kulak liquidation\\" came without precise instructions, and encouraged local leaders to take radical action. The campaign to \\"liquidate the kulaks as a class\\" constituted the main part of Stalin's social-engineering policies in the early 1930s. On 30 January 1930, the Politburo approved the dissolving of kulaks as a class. Three categories of kulaks were distinguished: the first to be sent to the Gulags; the second to be relocated to distant provinces, such as the north Urals and Kazakhstan; and the third to other areas within their province. The peasantry were required to relinquish their farm animals to government authorities. Many chose to slaughter their livestock rather than give them up to collective farms. In the first two months of 1930, peasants killed millions of cattle, horses, pigs, sheep and goats, with the meat and hides being consumed and bartered. For instance, the Soviet Party Congress reported in 1934 that 26.6 million head of cattle and 63.4 million sheep had been lost. In response to the widespread slaughter, the Sovnarkom issued decrees to prosecute \\"the malicious slaughtering of livestock\\" (). Stalin ordered severe measures to end kulak resistance. In 1930, he declared: :In order to oust the 'kulaks' as a class, the resistance of this class must be smashed in open battle and it must be deprived of the productive sources of its existence and development.‚Ä¶ That is a turn towards the policy of eliminating the kulaks as a class. Human impact During 1929‚Äì1933, the grain quotas were placed artificially high. Peasants would attempt to hide grain and bury it. According to historian Robert Conquest, every brigade was equipped with a long iron bar to probe the ground for grain caches and peasants who did not show signs of starvation were especially suspected of hiding food. Conquest states: As Vasily Grossman explained, the Party activists who helped the State Political Directorate (the secret police) with arrests and deportations \\"were all people who knew one another well, and knew their victims, but in carrying out this task they became dazed, stupefied.\\" > They would threaten people with guns, as if they were under a spell, calling > small children 'kulak bastards,' screaming 'bloodsuckers!'‚Ä¶ They had sold > themselves on the idea that so-called 'kulaks' were pariahs, untouchables, > vermin. They would not sit down at a 'parasite's' table; the 'kulak' child > was loathsome, the young 'kulak' girl was lower than a louse. Party activists brutalizing the starving villagers fell into cognitive dissonance, rationalizing their actions through ideology. Lev Kopelev, who later became a Soviet dissident, explained: =Numbers executed= Stalin ordered for kulaks \\"to be liquidated as a class,\\" and this was the cause of the Soviet famine of 1932‚Äì1933. This famine has complicated attempts to identify the number of deaths arising from the executions of kulaks. A wide range of death tolls has been suggested, from as many as six million suggested by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, whereas the much lower number of 700,000 deaths are estimated by Soviet sources. According to data from Soviet archives, which were published only in 1990, 1,803,392 people were sent to labor colonies and camps in 1930 and 1931. Books based on these sources have said that 1,317,022 reached the destinations. The fate of the remaining 486,370 cannot be verified. Deportations on a smaller scale continued after 1931. The reported number of kulaks and their relatives who died in labor colonies from 1932‚Äì1940 was 389,521. Former kulaks and their families made up the majority of victims of the Great Purge of the late 1930s, with 669,929 arrested and 376,202 executed.

The aim of the conference was to pave the way for Germany's participation in the international community through the creation of a democratic and federal government in the area of the U.S., British and French zones of the country. The conference was held in two sessions, the first from 23 February to 6 March, the second from 20 April to 2 June 1948. The reason for summoning the conference was that the Foreign Secretary Conference 15 December 1947 between the four victorious nations United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union had ended without result in the German question. The recent Communist takeover in Czechoslovakia made it urgent for the western allies to help create a democratic (West) Germany. The Soviet Union was not invited to the London Conference. The conference conclusions were later called London recommendations. The three western military governors in Germany were assigned to make recommendations to the Minister Presidents in western Germany about how the new state should be established.Bundeszentrale f√ºr politische Bildung The Minister Presidents should convene a constitutional Assembly (Parliamentary Council) to found a free and democratic state. The Military Governors recommendations were called the Frankfurt Documents after the place where the German Minister Presidents met. Conditions were made that Germany should not have weapons of mass destruction and other similar weapons, and that the country should not be able to invade the Soviet occupation zone. France voted for the merger of the three western occupation zones on conditions that the Saarland was financially merged with France and that the Ruhr area became subject to international control. USSR ended its efforts in the Allied Control Council as a consequence of the London Conference.

Written by Reverend Jen Miller, the film is notable for being the only feature-length film ASS Studios had completed, known mainly for their short subjects, as well as the inclusion of writer Jonathan Ames as an Executive Producer. The film also marks the return of actor Robert Prichard, recognized for his roles in various Troma films including The Toxic Avenger & Class of Nuke em' High. Following a loose narrative, the film concerns a group of Satanic worshippers, who, after kidnapping two Catholic schoolgirls, soon realize that Satan isn't as evil as they hoped for. Production According to Sell, the estimated shooting budget on the film was only $27.00, which he claimed was mostly spent on alcohol and pizza for the cast. To further these claims, Sell, who is known for his no-budget film work announced publicly that the film was shot in \\"Drunk-O-Vision\\". In the same interview, the group jokingly claimed that Janeane Garofalo had been kidnapped in order to obtain a cameo, and only released upon giving a performance. Sell and Miller have mentioned that the idea and screenplay had been completed almost immediately during the time their now-defunct company ASS Studios was launched. However, due to financial issues, they began shooting short films in order to gain momentum and attention for the project, which at the time was entitled \\"Satan's Bitches\\" then \\"Half-ASSed Satanists\\" and possibly written as a soft-core feature. The title change was decided when the two felt that, though with no intentions of putting the film in the Festival circuit, would be a bit more publicly accepted. Sell helped obtain funding for pre-production working as a cook at various Lower East Side restaurants. Regarding the involvement of Jonathan Ames in the film, Sell wrote: > When our friend Jonathan Ames, writer and creator of HBO‚Äôs series Bored to > Death decided to sign on as a producer, it saved us a lot of further > hardship.

He entered politics in the mid 1950s through involvement in a hospital worker's trade union and membership of the Nyasaland African Congress, where his activities led to his detention without trial during the 1959 State of Emergency in Nyasaland. After his release, he joined the Malawi Congress Party (MCP), and became locally prominent in Ntcheu District as district MCP chairman and from 1962 as Member of Parliament for Ntcheu South. In 1963, he became Administrative Secretary of the MCP, and he was a prominent supporter of the then-Prime Minister, Hastings Banda during the Cabinet Crisis of 1964. Muwalo was rewarded for his loyalty with the cabinet post of Minister of Information in 1964, and in 1966 he became Minister of State in the President's Office. His close contact with Banda, both as minister in Banda's office and in the MCP gave him great power and, during the first half of the 1970s he and his relative, the Head of the Police Special Branch Focus Gwede, were heavily involved in the political repression of actual or suspected opponents of the Banda regime. In 1976 he and Gwede were arrested: the reasons for their arrests were unclear, but may have resulted from a power struggle among those around the ageing president or simply because he became too powerful and may have been seen by Banda as a threat. In 1977, the two were tried before a Traditional Court and after a trial whose fairness was in serious doubt, were both sentenced to death. Gwede was reprieved, but Muwalo was hanged on 3 September 1977. Early life and entry into politics Albert Andrew Muwalo Gandale Nqumayo (or Ngumayo) was born in Ntcheu District, of Maseko Ngoni parentage on 23 June 1927, the second of seven children, all sons. After primary education at Gowa Mission in Ntcheu District, he attended the secondary school at Blantyre Mission, gaining a Junior Certificate in 1945. He worked at Zomba African Hospital, and undertook further study in evening classes at the hospital. During the mid-1950s, his ambition was to undertake further study in Britain, but his detention in 1959 put an end to this, and he did not obtain the further education achieved by several of those who became ministers in 1961 and 1962. During his time at the hospital, he became involved in trade union activities through the Nyasaland African Medical Orderlies union, becoming its Secretary-General. He joined the Ntcheu branch of the Nyasaland African Congress and was active in demonstrating against the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. During the State of Emergency declared in March 1959, he was detained without trial in Nyasaland, unlike the most senior Congress members, who were imprisoned in Southern Rhodesia. After his release, he joined the Malawi Congress Party (MCP), and became active in its organisation, first in Ntcheu town and later as a party member and then Chairman of the MCP in Ntcheu District. Between 1962 and 1964, he was Chairman of Ntcheu District Council. Muwalo was Member of Parliament for Ntcheu South between 1964 and 1967, when he resigned owing to the pressures of his MCP work, although the seat was later held by his younger brother, Daniel.A C Mkandawire (2010) Albert Muwalo Nqumayo: His life and times, his death and legacy, pp. 21, 30, 35‚Äì38. Albert Muwalo became Administrative Secretary of the Malawi Congress Party in April 1963, in succession to Yatuta Chisiza,J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, Woodbridge, James Currey p. 382. . and he became the party's Secretary General in 1973. He entered the cabinet as Minister of Information in 1964, and became Minister of State in the President's Office in 1966 and Minister without Portfolio in 1976.C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964‚Äì1965, pp. 70, 358. IB Tauris. . Cabinet Crisis Most of the ministerial appointees in 1961 and 1962 were relatively young, generally under 35 (only Orton Chirwa was over 40), with at least secondary, and often higher, education. A disproportionate number of these came from the Northern Region, because several mission schools there taught to a high standard. The group ranking just below the ministers, which included Muwalo, consisted of local MCP bosses who were generally older than the first group and usually less well educated but with stronger local ties than them, and often came from the Central and Southern regions. After the 1964 crisis, several of them replaced the former ministers.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, Woodbridge, James Currey p. 427. . Differences between Banda and his ministers arose after the 1963 election. From October 1963, Banda began to make slighting references to them in public speeches and accused some of them of forming a cabal against him. He dismissed one minister, took away another's responsibilities without removing him from the cabinet and reassigned portfolios in a cabinet reshuffle. As well as being Prime Minister, Banda retained four ministerial portfolios, devolving the day- to-day work to parliamentary secretaries. All this diminished the power and influence of the ministers.C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964‚Äì1965, pp. 91‚Äì2, 95-6, 333.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 403‚Äì4. Banda also continued diplomatic relations with South Africa and Portugal, but refused to recognise the People's Republic of China or East Germany, and contemptuously rejected suggestions of forming closer ties with Zambia and Tanzania. The slow pace of Africanization in the Civil Service, the freezing of Civil Service salaries and the introduction of a charge for outpatients at state hospitals were all seen as failing to pass the benefits of independence to the people.R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa: The Making of Malawi and Zambia, 1873‚Äì1964, Cambridge (Mass), Harvard University Press, pp. 317‚Äì8. At the cabinet meeting of 26 August 1964, all the ministers present raised their concerns with Banda and presented him with a list of grievances. A number of ministers led by Yatutu Chisiza apparently wished to convert Banda's role from that of Prime Minister who expected to become an executive President, to that of a future President without executive functions, with an appointed Prime Minister as head of government.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 431, 451.C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964‚Äì1965 pp. 159‚Äì60. During the Cabinet Crisis of 1964, on 27 August Banda consulted Muwalo and Aleke Banda as leading officials of the MCP to ensure that leading party members in all three regions of Malawi supported him, rather than supporting the ministers who opposed him. Banda advised Glyn Smallwood Jones, the Governor-General on 1 September of his intention to resign, which would automatically end the tenure of the other ministers. On his own reappointment he would reappoint the ministers, except for Kanyama Chiume, Yatuta Chisiza and possibly John Msonthi and Chipembere. The Governor-General advised him to seek a vote of confidence in parliament rather than resign, and on the day that this vote began Banda secured the dismissal of three cabinet ministers: three others resigned in solidarity.C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964‚Äì1965, pp. 125, 128. President Banda saw Muwalo and Aleke Banda a great deal in September 1964, and their comments and the unity of the ex-ministers led him to believe that the latter were conspiring against him.C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964‚Äì1965, pp. 140‚Äì1. The attempts of the Governor-General to secure a compromise after the vote of confidence led to an undertaking by Banda to reinstate the ministers, except for Chiume, Chisiza and Chipembere: he wished for the appointment four new ministers, including Muwalo, possibly as Minister of Health. After the breakdown of attempts to find a compromise, because the ex-ministers insisted they should all be reinstated. Muwalo was appointed as Minister of Information in September 1964. On 28 September, members of the Youth League of the MCP supporting Banda, who had been bussed into Zomba during the previous night, tried to close Zomba market and force those civil servants that were in strike back to work. However, the more numerous civil servants, armed themselves with sticks and attacked MCP supporters and burned down the party's national headquarters and a shop owned by the local MCP chairman. During these disturbances, Muwalo was assaulted by the pro-Chipembere crowd, and another newly-appointed minister was severely beaten. By 30 September supporters of the dismissed ministers controlled Zomba, and Muwalo and every other minister that supported Banda had left the town.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, Woodbridge, James Currey p. 439. . Ministerial Career There are few detailed records of Muwalo's repressive activities between his appointment as a minister 1964 and his arrest in 1976, although as early as 1964, Banda urged anyone with any information on dissent to give this him or Muwalo.J Power, (2010) Political Culture and Nationalism in Malawi: Building Kwacha, University of Rochester Press, p. 183. . In this period, Muwalo exercised almost complete censorship over the Malawian media. The most important decisions of Banda's government were made orally, so the reasons for them are not documented and much of the discussion of those reasons relies on claims and allegations that cannot be verified. It is clear that Banda was ultimately responsible for the policy of the imprisonment, with or without trial, torture and occasional murder of actual or invented dissidents. However, as he grew older he acted on the information provided by the ministers and others closest to. There were several, often competing, sources of intelligence: Muwalo's associate Gwede controlled the Police Special Branch, while John Tembo organised a network of spies and informers through the Malawi Young Pioneers.J Lwanda, (2002). Paper Tigers: The Rise and Fall of the Independent Media in Malawi, 1961 ‚Äì 2001, The Society of Malawi Journal, Vol. 55, No. 1, p. 6.J Mapanje, (2002). The Orality of Dictatorship, in H Englund (editor), A Democracy of Chameleons, Kachere Books, pp. 181‚Äì3. Two matters that are better documented were the campaign against Jehovah's Witnesses and the reaction to the Chilobwe murders. Muwalo and Gwede were closely associated with the implementation of repressive policies against political critics and even those seeking political neutrality, like Jehovah's Witnesses. After the removal of these two, the government's attitude appeared to have softened, at least for a time. Muwalo was linked to the persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses, that started in late 1963 before the pre-independence election, when Witnesses were beaten for failing to buy MCP cards, because their religious beliefs did not allow membership of political parties.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, p. 382. In 1967, at the conference of the MCP, of which Muwalo was Administrative Secretary, it was agreed that Jehovah's Witnesses should be declared an \\"unlawful society\\", and it was soon declared to be such, leading to attacks in which at least five Witnesses were killed and many fled the country. The anti-Witness campaign resumed in 1972, with further killings and beating. Over 50,000 Witnesses fled to Zambia or Mozambique, although in 1973, the Zambian authorities, and in 1975 the government of newly independent Mozambique, forcibly repatriated the majority of these refugees. A fifth wave of persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses began in September 1975, mainly organised by local MCP members, but authorised at the party's highest level. This involved over 5,000 arrests, with many Witnesses being sentenced to three years in prison for membership of an illegal organisation, many beatings and destruction of Witnesses' property, and at least two more killings. After Muwalo's arrest, this wave of persecution ended, and many of those imprisoned or in detention were released. Although it is clear that the initial impetus for banning the Witnesses in 1967 came from Banda, Muwalo was responsible for organising much of the subsequent anti-Witness action.R Carver, (1990). Where Silence Rules: The Suppression of Dissent in Malawi, Human Rights Watch, pp. 33, 64-6. . Between September 1968 and March 1970, at least 31 brutal murders occurred at night and in the victims' own homes in the suburbs of Malawi's largest city, Blantyre. These were said to have been committed by the same person or group, and they are collectively known as the Chilobwe murders. They were often accompanied by mutilation of the victims' bodies suggestive of a belief in witchcraft or magic by whoever carried out the killings. Many of the victims lived in poor housing which offered little resistance to forced entry. The Government's failure to make any arrests caused panic and led to criticism of the police and government. One persistent rumour was that the Government was itself responsible for the murders, and that it had drained the victims' blood to send to South Africa.P Brietzke, (1974). The Chilobwe Murders Trial, African Studies Review, Vol. 17, No. 2, pp. 361‚Äì2. In 1969, rumours were widespread that Muwalo was responsible for the Chilobwe murders. Both Banda and Muwalo took these rumours seriously and Muwalo told the Malawi parliament that there was no truth in them; on the contrary, those who had committed the murders were agents of the ex-ministers involved in the 1964 Cabinet Crisis.J Power, (2010) Political Culture and Nationalism in Malawi, p. 193. At his trial, Muwalo was said to have started or spread rumours that the Chilobwe murders were ordered by the Malawi government, so the blood of the victims could be sold to South Africa. There has been speculation that the downfall of Muwalo and Focus Gwedwe was engineered by John Tembo and his niece Cecilia Kadzamira, as the two groups were rivals to control and succeed the ageing Banda. However, none of these rumours or speculation can be proven.J Power, (2010) Political Culture and Nationalism in Malawi: Building Kwacha, pp. 159, 184.B Kasuka, (2013). African Writers, African Books p.199. . Trial and Execution For much of the first half of the 1970s, Muwalo was able to use his post as Minister of State in the President's Office and his MCP positions to control access to Banda and manipulate the information that Banda received, particularly on the repression that Muwalo and Gwede controlled. In June 1976, the change in his ministerial post to Minister without Portfolio was seen as a demotion and, at the end of the MCP Conference in September, Banda denounced abuses of power and stated that Muwalo was no closer to him than other ministers.Telegram, US Embassy in Malawi to State Department on Muwalo's Political Demise, Wikileaks, https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1976LILONG01192_b.html Muwalo was expelled from his posts of MCP Secretary General and Minister without Portfolio on 27 October 1976. The announcement gave the reason as a grave breach of discipline and stated that Muwalo would forfeit any property gained through his governmental or party posts. His expulsion occurred shortly after that of Focus Gwede, and both men were arrested, Muwalo on 27 October and Gwede on 10 November.A C Mkandawire (2010) Albert Muwalo Nqumayo: His life and times, his death and legacy, p. 115. It was suggested that these expulsions and arrests followed an investigation into the activities of Muwalo and Gwede which found the men had misused Banda's name when abusing their powers. In particular, the two men (who were related) interfered with a police investigation involving another relative.Telegram, US Embassy in Malawi to State Department on Muwalo's Political Demise, Wikileaks, https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1976LILONG01192_b.html The trial of Albert Muwalo and Focus Gwede was held in the Southern Region Traditional Court in March to April 1977. Traditional Courts did not allow defence lawyers to plead for the accused, who were not given a summary of the charges against them before the trial, so could not prepare a defence. Defendants had no right to call witnesses (which was at the discretion of the judges) nor to appeal (which was at the discretion of Minister of Justice, a post held by Banda). Finally, these courts were not bound by the normal rules of evidence.P Brietzke, (1974). The Chilobwe Murders Trial, p. 363.M Nzunda, (1985).Criminal Law in Internal Conflict of Laws in Mala≈µi, Journal of African Law, Vol. 29, No. 2, pp. 138, 140. The charge against Muwalo and Gwede was of attempting to assassinate President Banda and overthrow his government. Banda had defined plotting to and overthrow his government as merely speaking aloud about it, but there was little evidence that the accused had even done that. The only concrete evidence against the men was their illegal possession of firearms. However, the Traditional Court admitted as evidence three letters that denounced them for colluding with ex-ministers who fled Malawi after the Cabinet Crisis of 1964. One of the letters was anonymous, and of the two signed letters, one was disowned by the supposed signatory and the signatory of the other did not exist. Nevertheless, the court admitted all three on the basis, \\"... there is no smoke without fire\\". They also admitted recordings of two telephone conversations the defendants had about the guns, which did not discuss any plans to use them. In order to establish a motive for the alleged treason, the court considered Muwalo's possession of photographs of some of the ex-ministers and copies of books which the court deemed subversive, although only one was actually banned (this was George Orwell's Animal Farm). The court held that mere possession of the photographs of people who had, \\"... rebelled against the Malawi government\\" made the owner, Muwalo, a rebel, and owning the books was enough to brand him as a communist sympathiser. There was even less evidence, however unsatisfactory, against Gwede, but both men were sentenced to death for treason. Although Muwalo and Gwede were probably guilty of many crimes, the wholly insufficient evidence produced did not prove their guilt of the crime of which they were accused.R Carver, (1990). Where Silence Rules: The Suppression of Dissent in Malawi, pp. 33‚Äì6. An appeal against both conviction and sentence was heard by the National Traditional Court of Appeal in August 1977, but rejected. The two men were then transferred to the condemned cells of Zomba prison to await execution. Muwalo was hanged on 3 September 1977, but Gwede received a last minute reprieve and remained in prison until 1993.A C Mkandawire (2010) Albert Muwalo Nqumayo: His life and times, his death and legacy, pp. 125, 136, 142.

Sutton was born in Staffordshire, England about 1767. He studied medicine in London, England, Edinburgh, Scotland, and Leiden, The Netherlands, which granted him an M.D. in 1787. He became a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians in 1790. He served in the Army and then settled in Greenwich, England to become a consultant at the Kent Dispensary and to practice medicine. In 1813, Sutton published his book, Tracts on Delirium Tremens, on Peritonitis, and on Some other Internal Inflammatory Affections, and on the Gout. The chapter on delirium tremens contains sixteen case-reports with detailed description of the symptoms and the differential diagnosis from ‚Äúphrenitis‚Äù (another term for delirium) due to inflammation of the brain and from mania. He described the unusual case of a woman not known to be inebriated but he discovered that she frequently imbibed large quantities of Tincture of Lavender, which has an alcohol base. Sutton‚Äôs treatment for delirium tremens discarded the use of bleeding, an accepted medical method unless the patient was plethoric. Instead, he used opium in sufficient dosage to induce sleep from which the patient awoke improved. He suggested purgation if needed noting that opium may cause a confined bowel state and that blistering appeared to be of no use. Sutton died at Greenwich in 1835. Works Sutton, Thomas.

The name Theerthamalai in Tamil means Hill with Holy Water. Theerthamalai is a village situated about 16 km (about 9.9 mi) northeast of Harur. Theerthagirishwarar Temple is located at the top of a hillock. The temple, situated about 1 km (about 0.6 mi) up the steep slope of the hillock, derives its name from the five springs in the temple. Lord Theerthagireeswar (Shiva) is the worshipping deity. History Theerthagirishwarar was built in the 7th century, with many contributions being made by the Chola and Pandya Kings. Several inscriptions can be found in Theerthagireeswarar Temple. The inscriptions on the temple say that Chola emperors, including Rajendra Cholan, regularly visited this temple. Poet Saint Arunagirinathar referred to Theerthagirieeswarar Temple in his compositions. =Greatness of the Temple= Lord Sri Rama, after winning the war against Ravana and returning to Ayodhya, wanted to perform Shiva Puja in the temple. As Sri Hanuman could not return in time with holy Ganga water and flowers from Kasi, Rama shot an arrow on rock creating the Rama Theertha and completed the puja. The Rama Theertham is a tiny waterfall about 9.1 meters (about 30 feet) high. During summer, even when the river is dry, there will be sweet water in the spring that flows from rock. Sri Hanuman threw the pot of water from here, which fell at a distance of about 12 km (about 7.4 mi) from the hill and became Hanuman Theertham. People take the first dip in Hanuman Theertha and then at Rama Theertha for relief from sins. List of Theertham Theertham means Holy water in Tamil. The most fascinating factor is that the tiny waterfalls never dry out, even during the most drought seasons recorded in the history. All of which have their origin in different parts of the rocky surface. They are: thumbnail *Agasthya Theertham In the Hill *Ramar Theerththam *Agni Theertham *Gowri Theertham *Kumara Theertham *Vasishta theertham Inth top of the Hill Cave *Vayu Theertham *Varuna Theerththam *Indhira Theerththam, Andiyur (Mondukuli) *Yema Theertham, Veppampatty * Anuman theertham, Hanumantheerththam River Festival The famous festivals of the temple are the 10-day Masi Brahmmotsavam in February‚ÄìMarch with procession of the presiding Lord, car festival on the 7th day, wedding festival on the 5th day and Sathaparana festival ‚Äì Lord in reclining posture on the 10th day; Abishek pujas with 365 litres of milk on the Chithirai new year day falling mostly on 14 April or a day earlier or later occasionally, Navarathri in September‚ÄìOctober and Aadi 18 July‚ÄìAugust with special abishek at night followed by Girivalam ‚Äì circumambulation of the hill. The devotee crowd in the temple is usually big on Saturdays and Sundays. Pradosha is devotionally observed. Also Tamil and English New Year Day are observed in the temple.

A Republican, Green previously served in the Tennessee State Senate, representing the 22nd district. Following his graduation from West Point, Green was initially an infantry officer. He graduated from Boonshoft School of Medicine at Wright State University and became a flight surgeon, serving tours of duty in the Afghanistan War and Iraq War. He authored a book about his experience in Operation Red Dawn, which saw the capture of Saddam Hussein. Following his military retirement in 2006, Green became the CEO of a hospital emergency department staffing company. Green first entered politics in 2012 by defeating Democratic incumbent Tim Barnes for a seat in the Tennessee State Senate. In 2017, Green was nominated by President Donald Trump to serve as the United States Secretary of the Army, but withdrew his nomination when comments he had previously made came to light. When Representative Marsha Blackburn announced her candidacy for the United States Senate in 2018, Green announced his campaign to succeed her, which he won in November 2018. Military career Green graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1986, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree majoring in quantitative business management. From 1987 through 1990, Green served as an infantry officer in the United States Army. His first duty assignment following graduation from the US Army Ranger School was with the 194th Armored Brigade (United States) at Fort Knox. There he served as a rifle platoon leader, scout platoon leader and battalion adjutant for an infantry battalion. Following the Infantry Officer's Advance Course, then Captain Green served with the 82nd Airborne Division as an airborne battalion supply officer and a rifle company commander. Following a traumatic event where his father's life was saved by a team of surgeons and critical care doctors, Green requested the US Army send him to medical school. He attended Boonshoft School of Medicine at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, graduating with an MD degree in 1999. He did his residency in emergency medicine at Fort Hood, Texas. After his residency Dr. Green was selected to serve as the flight surgeon for the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment. As a special operations flight surgeon, Green served a tour of duty in the Afghanistan War and two tours of duty in the Iraq War. He was the special operations flight surgeon during Operation Red Dawn, the military operation that captured Saddam Hussein. Green interrogated Hussein for six hours. Following his military service, he authored a book, titled A Night With Saddam, detailing the capture of Hussein, his interview with the dictator and his service with the Army's elite aviation unit. Green was honorably discharged from the Army in 2006. For his service, Green was awarded the Bronze Star, the Meritorious Service Medal with two oak leaf clusters, the Army Commendation Medal with two oak leaf clusters, the Achievement Medal with three oak leaf clusters, the Air Medal with the V Device for valor under heavy enemy fire while rescuing British Special Operations forces wounded near Fallujah, and the Combat Medical Badge among numerous other awards. He also earned the Air Assault Badge and the Flight Surgeon Badge during his military service. Civilian career Green founded and served as chief executive officer of Align MD, a hospital emergency department management staffing company. Align MD provides staffing to emergency departments and hospitalist services in 50 hospitals across 10 states. Green also founded Two Rivers Medical Foundation, which provides healthcare to underserved populations throughout the world via medical mission trips, and operates a free medical clinic in his hometown, and in Memphis, Tennessee. Green served on the boards of several for profit companies including, American Physician Partners, Align MD, and Rural Physician Partners. Green is also a board member of the Middle Tennessee Boy Scouts of America. He has served on the advisory board of the political organization Latinos for Tennessee since 2015. In 2015, Green was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Humanities by Williamson College in Franklin, Tennessee. Political career =Tennessee State Senate= He was first elected to the Tennessee Senate in 2012, defeating Democratic incumbent Tim Barnes. He was rumored to be considering a challenge to Lamar Alexander in the 2014 U.S. Senate election, but declined to do so. Green is most noteworthy for his legislation ending the Hall Income Tax in Tennessee, only the second time in US history a state has repealed an income tax. He also co-sponsored a bill which eliminated the statute of limitations on rape cases where the DNA profile of the suspect is known. Sen. Green has received awards recognizing his many laws protecting veterans and small businesses. He has led the charge in Tennessee for automated technology in the auto manufacturing world speaking at national conferences on the topic. In 2015 Green proposed a pilot program to test an innovative solution to healthcare. The idea provides a reduced amount of healthcare dollars on a swipe card for Medicaid patients giving them choice and control. The incentive is that any dollars not spent go to the patient as an addition to their earned income check. SJR 88 passed and was signed by the governor. Currently, the request for a waiver to test the program is at CMS for approval. Green was opposed for re-election in the 2016 Republican primary but he won 84% to 16% over Lori Smith of Clarksville, Tennessee. In the general election, Senator Green won re-election defeating Democrat David Cutting 67% to 33%. =Nomination as U.S. Army Secretary= In April 2017, Green was nominated by President Donald Trump to be United States Secretary of the Army. Green was Trump's second nominee for this position after initial nominee Vincent Viola withdrew from consideration. Green drew some opposition based on public comments directed at transgender people. A statement that Green made which brought wide attention to him in the media was made before a Tea Party group in September 2016 at a gathering in Chattanooga, Tennessee. At that event Green said, \\"If you polled the psychiatrists, they're going to tell you that transgender is a disease.\\" As well as his support for a state law which defined access to public restrooms for transgender individuals matching their legal sex, rather than gender identity. In an internet radio talk show with CJ Porter, Green also stated that his duty as a state senator is to \\"crush evil.\\" Green said this in the context of his support for a bill to prohibit transgender individuals from entering the restrooms for the gender they identified with. Green also stated that if school districts \\"want to have a bathroom that's separate for all of the, you know, guys or gals with question marks\\" but were concerned the \\"AFL-CIO is going to sue you, well I got your back.\\" It is assumed Green meant the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) not the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL‚ÄìCIO). Green has also said that he would \\"not tolerate\\" students learning about Muslim beliefs and practices. Green added later that he doesn't \\"think we should teach the Lord‚Äôs Prayer\\" in schools either. In a call for separation of church and state, he said: \\"Leave that to the churches, the synagogues, and the mosques.\\"https://franklinhomepage.com/sen-mark-green- discusses-sec-of-army-nomination-opioid-crisis-illegal-immigration-and-more/ Green withdrew his nomination on May 5, 2017. =2018 Tennessee gubernatorial election= On January 4, 2017, Green officially filed paperwork to run for Governor as a Republican candidate for the 2018 Tennessee gubernatorial election.
