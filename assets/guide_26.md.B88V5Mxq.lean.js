Bakeoven was named for a clay and stone oven built in 1862 to make bread to sell to miners traveling along a trail from The Dalles to gold mines near Canyon City. The baker was said to have been a trader with a pack train of flour whose horses were driven off in the night by Native Americans. Joseph Sherar, another pioneer and businessman, is thought to have been at the scene at the time of the incident. In 1905, the community, at the intersection of two stagecoach roads, had a post office, a hotel, general merchandise store, and a blacksmith shop. The Prineville road and the Canyon City road merged here and continued as one road to The Dalles. The Dalles - Canyon City road was later included in the land-grant route known as The Dalles Military Road. A Bake Oven (two words) post office was established in 1875, and Ellen Burgess was the first postmaster. This office was discontinued in 1913, and for about a year the Bakeoven mail was handled by a nearby post office named Flangan. The Bakeoven (one word) post office was reopened in 1914 but closed again in 1918.

The player controls being chased from an enemy. The primary theme of series is an explorer chased from evil demon monkeys, however, the characters and theme vary between spin-off. The game was initially released for iOS devices on August 4, 2011, and later ported to Android systems and Windows Phone 8. The series consists of five titles and one planned. The series has received commercial success with multiple entries surpassing 1 million downloads. Gameplay In the Temple Run series, the player controls a player character with the perspective behind the player character's back. While the character is running, the player can swipe left or right to move the character to either side of the screen to collect coins and/or avoid obstacles. The player can also swipe down to slide down towards the ground or swipe up to jump. If the path leads to a turn, the player must swipe toward the direction of the turn to successfully stay on the path. Intersections on the path allow the player to choose different paths. If the player does not avoid obstacles or doesn't turn to stay on the path, the player will fall off the path or die and lose. Throughout the path, there are coins to collect. There are three types of coins to be found while the character is running: gold, red, and blue. A gold coin will only add one coin to the player's total number of coins. Red coins are worth two coins, while blue coins are worth three. The coins can be used to buy and then upgrade power-ups and/or other characters. Coins can also be bought by the player through in-app purchases with payments of actual money. When the player needs to turn left or right, the touchscreen can be swiped in the corresponding direction. If the player wishes to jump over an object, the screen can be swiped upwards; if the player wishes to slide under an object, the screen can be swiped downwards.  Games  =Released= ;Temple Run The first entry in the Temple Run series. ;Temple Run: Brave In June 2012, it was announced that Imangi had teamed with Disney to promote the film Brave via a Temple Run-style game titled Temple Run: Brave. The game was released on June 14 for iOS and Android. As with Temple Run when it was initially released, Temple Run: Brave cost 99 cents to purchase. Temple Run: Brave is set in the highlands of Scotland. The default character is , and as in the original game, the objective is to keep running, avoiding the dangers along the way in an effort to achieve the longest time possible, while being chased by the demon bear, Mor'du. The new feature for Temple Run: Brave is archery. During the run, archery symbols appear with some dots above them, acting as a signal that there will be bullseyes at which to shoot. The dots are the number of targets in the area. On the left and right sides, the player will then find archery targets, and by touching the screen, an arrow is shot accurately at the upcoming target. When the player finishes hitting all targets in the area, they get a coin bonus, and must then wait for another area with archery targets. In an update, Temple Run: Brave received a new power-up, the \\"Will-o'-the-Wisps\\", which appear in the game random times during gameplay. When the player obtains it, they are transported to a \\"dark\\" version of the game world, where glowing wisps appear in the player's path. The player has to grab as many as they can, while still navigating the turns and jumps. In 2013, Temple Run: Brave was ported to Windows Phone 8, and both Windows 8 and Windows RT (via Windows Store).

He was born in Stretford, then in Lancashire, and was possibly the son of John and Mary Painter baptised at St Mary's Church Stretford on 15 February 1784. Boxing career Painter is known to have served time in King's Bench Prison. His first fight was against the Irish boxer J. Coyne, who stood tall and weighed ; Painter was a stone lighter and 5 ft in (1.77 m). The contest took place at St Nicholas near Margate on 23 August 1813, and after 40 minutes Painter emerged victorious. On 17 May 1814, Painter fought Tom Oliver the Gardener at Shepperton Range, a brutal bout that Painter lost, both men incurring serious injuries. Historian Pierce Egan described the bout as \\"enough to any two men\\", and by the time of his defeat in the 8th round, stated that Painter was \\"quite blind, and his nose beat flat upon his face\\", while Oliver's body was \\"terribly beaten, his head much disfigured, and nearly one of his eyes closed\\". Painter fought Corporal John Shaw on 18 April 1815 in front of a large crowd at Hounslow Heath. He lost the fight, Shaw being at least and around with a strength and reach advantage. Painter twice fought Tom Spring in 1818. During the first match, held on Mickleham Downs on 1 April 1818, he was struck by Spring in the side of the throat, his head and shoulder striking a stake supporting the ring on the way down. He fought on until the 31st round despite his injury but lost the fight. Painter's defeat came as a major upset to the sporting community, and a lot of people lost money betting on the fight. Egan documented: \\"Painter, from his hard hitting and bottom qualities, stood so high in the estimation of the amateurs, that it was booked Spring would prove an easy conquest to him.\\" A rematch took place on 7 August 1818; many of Painter's devoted fans had shifted their allegiance to Spring and he was now the favourite to win. Painter slugged it out for 42 rounds, giving Spring a powerful right above his right eye, before defeating him. According to Frank L. Dowling, Painter \\"had not been a successful boxer, but the men he had fought were known to be first-raters, and he displayed such gluttony and stamina.\\" Later life and death Painter announced his retirement from boxing after his victory over Spring, and became the landlord of The Anchor in Lobster Lane, Norwich, where he lived for many years. He was persuaded out of retirement for a final contest against Tom Oliver on 17 July 1820, which Painter won. He died at his son's home in Lakenham, Norwich, on 18 September 1852, and was buried at St Peters in Lakenham four days later.

Local bodies were called \\"Assemblies\\", which elected a Past Commander to the Grand (State) Assembly, which in turn elected two Past Commanders to the Supreme Castle. These representatives, however, were only allowed to attend meetings of the Supreme Castle when the affairs of the Degree of Naomi were under consideration.

It was developed by the Tiltfactor Laboratory as part of the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded project called \\"Transforming Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) For Women and Girls: Reworking Stereotypes & Bias.\\" The game was runner-up for Best Digital Game in the 2012 Meaningful Play Awards.  Gameplay  In each round, players race to make matches using cards listing noun and adjective descriptors. The first to shout out the name of a real person or fictional character who matches the descriptors on two or more word cards, claims the matched cards, and flips over a new noun/adjective pair. When the deck runs out, the player who collected the most cards wins. Whenever players are unable to make a match, someone adds another card from both decks to the table.  Research  Initial data suggests that Buffalo reduces prejudice and encourages greater inclusiveness in players’ representations of social identity groups. The research study showed that thinking about stereotypical and nonstereotypical trait pairings increases social identity complexity, a psychological construct linked to tolerance of members outside one's group.

It has been founded through a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign, which sought to raise $100,000 in 30 days for a pilot and a full 12-episode season.  Plot  Fourteen-year-old orphan Jesse Davidson lives with his emotionally distant and peculiar uncle Christopher Portalis in the Iliad House, a mysterious old mansion on an island off the east coast of the United States. Just when Jesse is finally getting used to living on the island, he discovers that the old abandoned train he and his friends have been using as a clubhouse for the past year can actually move through time. They get caught up in a series of adventures fraught with temporal distortions, political intrigue, secret societies, and supernatural battles, all as they try to cope with the daily pressures and craziness of adolescence. While traveling through the future and the past, they learn hard truths and secrets about themselves, and that there is forgiveness and redemption available to all who desire it. And, as Jesse and his uncle come to understand each other, Jesse begins to see that there is much more to Iliad House, and to why he and his uncle are there, than anyone realizes.  Reception  Roma Downey, an Irish filmmaker and executive producer of The Bible miniseries, endorsed Iliad House and its crowdfunding campaign.

He was Bishop of the Diocese of Nidaros in the aftermath of the introduction of Lutheranism into Norway. Gaas was born in Svendborg on the island of Funen in Denmark. He studied in Wittenberg for a few years from 1521. He took his magister degree in theology at Copenhagen during 1548. He was sent to Trondheim in 1549 with the goal of completing the Reformation of the church in the Diocese of Nidaros. When he first came to Trondheim, he was initially assigned to the Cloister at Elgeseter where he initiated reform. He also undertook a rescue mission for Nidaros Cathedral which was badly damaged by fires in 1327 and again in 1531. In his efforts to initiate reform of the church, he found an ally in Gjeble Pederssøn (ca. 1490-1557) Bishop in Bergen stift, who in 1537 had become the first Lutheran Bishop within Norway. Pederssøn was likewise reforming the church in Bergen. Hans Gaas served as superintendent and Bishop in Trondhjems stift from 1549 until his death in 1578, except for the war period from 1564 to 1570. In 1563, the Northern Seven Years' War was initiated between Sweden and Denmark. In 1564, Swedish forces occupied Trøndelag, including the city of Trondheim. Gaas refused taking the oath to the king of Sweden and was imprisoned. The war ended in 1570 with the withdrawal of Swedish forces under terms of the Treaty of Stettin at which time Gaas was reinstated in his former office.

Biography His birth and death dates are unknown. On the basis of his name, which means 'English', it is believed that Inglés' birthplace may have been in England. From his style it has been inferred that the artist possibly trained in the Low Countries. Los Gozos de Santa María The only documentary evidence on this painter is the codicil to a will of Íñigo López de Mendoza, 1st Marquis of Santillana, dated 6 June June 1455. The codicil records that prior to June 1455 the Marquis commissioned Jorge Inglés to paint the Altarpiece of the Gozos de Santa María or of the Marquis of Santillana for the chapel of the Castle of Buitrago del Lozoya. The altarpiece is regarded as the earliest Hispano-Flemish painting in Spain.The Museo del Prado will be exhibiting the first documented Hispano- Flemish painting by a Castilian artist for a period of ten years at the Prado The choice for Jorge Inglés shows that he was already a well-known painter by that time.J. J. Martín González. \\"Inglés, Jorge.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 26 Feb. 2016 Work =General= The work of Jorge Inglés reveals his intimate knowledge of Flemish painting, particularly of the work of Rogier van der Weyden, and of Flemish tapestries and manuscript illumination. He was the first painter in Castile known by name to employ the Netherlandish technique of oil on panel. His drawing technique was bold and his figures have a sculptural and expressive quality, particularly in the faces and hands. He was very skilled in rendering sumptuous clothes and the characteristics of Spanish brocades. St George and the Dragon Jorge Inglés enlarged the settings in his compositions through the use of bold perspective effects. He filled the interiors with carpets, flagstones and canopies. He paid attention to details to suggest atmosphere and usually created openings to reveal a landscape in the distance. =Altarpiece of the Gozos de Santa María= Íñigo López de Mendoza who commissioned the Altarpiece of the Gozos de Santa María was a major poet and devotee of science. López de Mendoza was also particularly devoted to his family and the Virgin. The latter is reflected in his devotional verses known as the Gozos de Santa María, which inspired the altarpiece. Some of the verses are inscribed on the scrolls carried by the angels at the top of the composition. The altarpiece retains part of the original structure and traceries and all the paintings executed by Jorge Inglés. Above the predella with the busts of the Fathers of the Church Íñigo López de Mendoza himself is depicted. This is the only surviving painted portrait of a Castilian nobleman. Also depicted is his wife, Catalina Suárez de Figueroa, kneeling before the Virgin. The image of the Virgin is a replacement of the original, mid-15th- century Flemish image which is lost. The Marquis and his wife are accompanied by their page and maid, respectively. This work is on display since 2012 at the Museo del Prado thanks to an agreement with Íñigo de Arteaga y Martín, 19th Duke of the Infantado, its present owner. =Other works= Another work attributed to Inglés is the retable of St Jerome from the monastery in Olmedo, Valladolid, now residing in the National Sculpture Museum at the Colegio de San Gregorio. The seven predella panels include a St Sebastian with a curious hat. The main panel shows St Jerome in his Study. The retable in the parish church of Villasandino (Burgos), of which fragments survive, may be Inglés' last work. Jorge Inglés was responsible for various miniatures in manuscripts in the collection of Marqués’ Íñigo López de Mendoza. References Further reading * J. F.

History and description  The bridge links the area of Lungotevere delle Armi to Piazzale delle Belle Arti.Rendina, p. 953. The works for the building began in 1909 and were completed two years later. The bridge was designed and built by Giovanni Antonio Porcheddu, with the cooperation of the engineers Giaj and Parvopassu, on the occasion of the exhibition for celebrating the 50th anniversary of Italian unification. It is the first bridge in Rome made in reinforced concrete, since its creator, at that time, was the only Italian dealer of the patent of the Belgian François Hennebique. The day of the inauguration (April 17, 1911), the spectators doubted that the structure, after the removal of the supporting scaffoldings, wouldn't have stood up; on the contrary, Porcheddu was so sure about the effectiveness and reliability of the new technique that he wanted to attend the demolition of the scaffolding on a little boat just below the arch of the bridge, together with his two youngest kids, Giuseppe and Ambrogia.Vanni Lòriga, cit., Sassari, 2003 During the ceremony, King Victor Emmanuel III offered Porcheddu the epithet \\"King of reinforced concrete\\".

They have been described as \\"one of the most important groups of ceramic sculpture in the world.\\"Gillman Lecture, 3.20 They reached the international art market, and were bought for Western collections. At least eight statues were originally found, including one large fragment which was long thought to have been destroyed in Berlin during World War II, but has been sighted in Russia recently. Others are now in the following collections: the British Museum in London, two in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Penn Museum, Philadelphia, Nelson Gallery of Art, Kansas City, the Musée Guimet in Paris, and a Japanese collection. With the example lost in Berlin, this makes a total of ten figures. There are fragments probably from the same set in other collections.Sickman, p. 483, note 11 for p. 200; updated to include the Paris example (Musée Guimet page The circumstances of the find, and the subsequent events as the figures reached the art market, have been the subject of much scholarly investigation, without being entirely clarified. A luohan (often written luóhàn) is the Chinese term for an arhat, one of the historical disciples of the Buddha. As Buddhist tradition developed, and especially in the East Asian Buddhist countries, the number of arhats or luohans tended to increase, and at least the most important were regarded as, or as almost, bodhisattvas or fully enlightened beings, with a wide range of supernatural powers.Rhie and Thurman, 102 According to Buddhist tradition, groups of 16, 18 or 500 luohans awaited the arrival of Maitreya, the Future Buddha, and groups were often used in East Asian Buddhist art. The full set is thought by most scholars to have had figures for the typical Chinese main grouping of Sixteen or Eighteen Arhats, although William Watson describes this \\"usual assumption\\" as \\"speculative\\". These and earlier smaller groupings of six or eight were each given names and personalities in Buddhist tradition.Rhie and Thurman, 102–116; Wisdom, 112–114; Steinhardt, 7–8; Gillman, 126; Watson, 123, quoted This set is exceptional in its quality and the individuality of each figure; it has been suggested that they were also portraits of notable contemporary monks. For Watson they are \\"outstanding examples of the naturalistic pseudo- portrait of the period, displaying to great perfection an idealization of the face\\", where \\"only the elongation of the ear-lobes follows [traditional Buddhist] iconography\\".Watson, 123 The green hair of some of the figures is also a departure from naturalism. The findspot in 1912 seems not to have been the original location of the group, which is unknown, and the set of 16 or 18 figures was probably made to be set on platforms along the walls of a \\"luohan hall\\" in a temple.Steinhardt, 7–8; Gillman, 126; Gillman Lecture, 35:00 – 37:00 The openwork bases were intended to suggest mountains; paintings of luohans often show them perched on small peaks, indicating the mountain retreats of the ascetic monk.Gillman Lecture, 38:30 Gallery File:Luóhàn at British Museum.jpgBritish Museum, Seated Luohan from Yixian File:遼 三彩羅漢像- Arhat (Luohan) MET DP163962.jpgYixian luohan from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, his head turned sharply to his right File:遼 三彩羅漢像-Arhat (Luohan) MET DP163966.jpgAnother at the Metropolitan from the same set, depicting an older monk Image:Green Luohan, Southeast Asia Gallery, Royal Ontario Museum, front.jpgLuohan at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, with later head Dating The older of the New York figures, from the side In their first years in the West the figures were usually assigned to the Tang Dynasty (618–907), with some proposing various later dates in the Ming dynasty period and those of the dynasties in between. But a date in the regional Liao Dynasty (916–1125 CE) came to be preferred, although in recent years they are increasingly, partly because of the results of scientific dating methods, placed in the early 12th century, which is mostly in the following Jin dynasty (1115–1234) period.Bulletin and Hobson's titles; Hobson, 69–70; Watson, 123 Thermoluminescence dating tests of the statues in Philadelphia and New York (younger figure) produced a midpoint date of 1210, ± 100 and 200 years respectively, the midpoint being during the period of the following Jin dynasty. Derek Gillman tentatively suggests the specific date of 1159, to match the recorded renovation of a large temple in the region, which he proposes as a candidate for their original location.Steinhardt, 8; Gillman Lecture, 53:10, for some minutes; Wisdom, 116 (Technical note). An early 12th- century coin was also found inside the Boston figure. A significantly different dating is proposed by Hsu, based mainly on inscriptions on stone stelae which she connects to the figures. The earliest of these records the completion in 1519 of a number of figures commissioned by a Song Jun; these had taken eight years to make. Another stele dated 1667 records the repair of Buddhist figures; Hsu argues this is when at least some of the replacement heads were added.Hsu, 184 (PDF)  History in the art world  Luohan at Royal Ontario Museum Detail from Royal Ontario Museum The figures were reportedly in the hands of Chinese dealers who told the German sinologist Friedrich Perzynski about them in 1912, and subsequently showed him examples, some of which he bought and exported to Europe. They had apparently been found in one or more caves near Yixian, Hebei, some 100 miles south-west of Beijing in northwestern China.Gillman Lecture, 23:40; others give shorter distances Perzynski claimed that he visited the cave the luohans had come from, by which time only a few fragments remained there. He described the episode in an article for Deutsche Rundschau soon after, repeating his story in a book published a few years later,Bulletin, 16 but the accuracy, indeed the veracity, of his account has been challenged in recent years.Abstracts of the 1998 AAS Annual Meeting, March 26–29, 1998, Washington, DC Session on the Luohans In 1913 two figures were exhibited in Paris (without their bases), and a third (with base) was acquired by the British Museum in 1914, see Seated Luohan from Yixian.Hobson Now six figures are in museums in North America, with two surviving and one missing or destroyed in Europe, and one of the set in Japan. The Metropolitan acquired its two examples separately in 1921, by which time Boston, Philadelphia, Toronto and the Matsukata Collection in Japan already had theirs, and a further four were \\"owned by private collectors and dealers\\", so making a total of ten figures, \\"besides a great many small fragments, several hands and feet, and baskets full of broken pieces\\".\\"Bulletin\\", 15, quoted; this covers the first the MMA bought, the younger luohan, with a later article in the June edition on the second aged figure, see Wisdom, 226 The figure long thought lost from the Museum für Ostasiatische Kunst in Berlin is a head and bust length fragment, 60 cm high, of a younger man with his head turned to his left, and his shoulder bared.Photo on Flickr; Gridley, 10, 113, 114; Steinhardt, 7 In his 2011 lecture Derek Gillman reported that Stanley Abe, a fellow specialist, had recently been shown it in a storeroom of the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg.Gillman Lecture, 21:10 The figure in Paris is an uncertain member of the group, very similar overall, but with differences in the posture of the shoulders and its stippled design on the robes. Many scholars question whether it really belongs with the group.Gillman Lecture, 22:30 To a surprising degree, the number of surviving pieces differs between sources. Most older sources say there were eight, including the Berlin figure. Three of these, those in Boston, Japan and Ontario, are reported to have later heads.Gillman, 126 n This may explain why William Watson in 2000 wrote that \\"Five Luohan in sancai pottery are preserved in Western museums\\", presumably excluding the example in Japan. The group of nine as listed by Laurence Sickman and others includes the examples from Berlin (as \\"present location unknown\\") and Japan (as \\"Matsukata Collection\\") but excludes the one now in Paris.Sickman, 483, note 11 By 2010 Gillman says what is presumably the same Japanese example was in the \\"Saizon Museum of Modern Art\\" (more usually \\"Sezon\\").Gillman, 126n Several of the current museum web pages mention a group of eight, probably counting Berlin, plus the Metropolitan Museum of Art (with two) in New York City, British Museum in London, Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, Ontario, and Penn Museum in Philadelphia. The current Penn Museum webpage lists eight surviving figures, including the \\"Matsukata Collection\\" but excluding Paris and Berlin.Penn Museum page Lecturing in 2011, Derek Gillman, Executive Director and President of the Barnes Foundation, said there were \\"nine known examples; there's a tenth which may be part of the group, and three are known, er, believed to have been broken\\".Gillman Lecture, 3:50 The luohan at the Royal Ontario Museum, in the Bishop White Gallery of Chinese Temple Art, was one of the first pieces to be included in the museum's Chinese art collection. Although the piece dates back to the Liao Dynasty (916–1125 CE), its tri- colour glaze of green, amber, and cream, is reminiscent of elements from Tang Dynasty sculptures. Technique The dimensions of the figures vary somewhat; taking the younger of the two in New York as an example, they are: height of the figure alone 50 in. (127 cm); including the base the height is 92 in. (233.7 cm). The base is 41 in. (104.1 cm) wide and 38 in. (96.5 cm) deep. The whole piece weighs 450 lbs (204.1 kg).Metropolitan object page The statues are assembled from several pieces of glazed terracotta (not stoneware as sometimes said),Gillman Lecture, 21:00 with their bases made separately, and using a combination of moulded and freely formed \\"slab-constructed\\" sections. They use the difficult sancai three-colour glazing process (here in fact often including four colours), which requires two firings. This was widely used for vessels and figures found in T'ang dynasty (618–907) tombs (this set in London is a good example), but from the mid-8th century is rarely found in most of China. However the regional Liao dynasty, founded by the semi-nomadic Khitan people, continued to use the style, although normally for vessels rather than figures, and Beijing and Yixian were on the southern edge of their state, with Beijing (as \\"Nanjing\\") their southern capital.Wisdom, 115–116 The figures, variously described as life-size or \\"slightly over life-size\\",Wisdom, 115; Sickman, 200 quoted are among the largest made with the technique and are agreed to be outstanding examples from the technical as well as the artistic point of view.Sickman, 201; Wisdom, 115–116 According to one scholar \\"it would tax the best-equipped modern pottery to build up and fire such massive objects without sinkage or warping or loss of pose\\",Hobson, 70 though he was probably unaware that because of their exceptional size the figures have iron rods inserted internally before firing to support the structure, a very unusual element. Because of their high quality it is often believed that they may have been made at one of the imperial kilns, which were home to the most highly skilled craftsmen.Rawson; Sickman and Soper Remains of a kiln have been excavated since 1983 at Longquan (not Longquan), between Beijing and the findspot, which seems a plausible site for their manufacture, with fragments of figures with similar characteristics found, although Gillman is unconvinced by this suggestion.Gillman Lecture, long passage beginning 41:00  Notes   References  *\\"Bulletin\\", \\"A Large Pottery Lohan of the T'ang Period\\" by \\"S.C.B.R.\\" (S.C.

It was developed by the Tiltfactor Lab as part of a National Science Foundation-funded project called “Transforming Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) For Women and Girls: Reworking Stereotypes & Bias.” It is a 20 minute game for middle and high school students (ages 12 and up). The game won Meaningful Play's best non- digital game award in 2012.  Gameplay  Players take turns assuming the role of the Decider. The Decider reveals a Moment Card that describes a funny, embarrassing, or stressful situation for the group and a Decider Card that provides a guideline for choosing a winning Reaction. Players submit a Reaction Card from their hand face down, and the Decider selects the Reaction Card that he/she thinks is the best response to the Moment, given the Decider Card's rule.  Research  Awkward Moment challenges players to consider other's viewpoints and assess their own biases. Data suggests that Awkward Moment strengthens associations between women and STEM and reduces people's trained biases.

History  The division had come about in 1833 between the Old and New Light Covenanters. The Old Lights had refused to swear allegiance to the constitution and thus become citizens, whereas the New Lights decide to allow for it. While the Old Light side was generally known as the Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America, the New Light was generally known as the Reformed Presbyterian Church, General Synod. Initially, the church did well, including sending missionaries to India, and adopting both a Book of Discipline and a Directory for Public Worship.Hutchison, George. The History Behind the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod. However, division soon began to plague the church, with a faction in Philadelphia arguing that the RPCGS had spent too much time arguing doctrinal points, as opposed to pursuing union with other Presbyterian denominations. Indeed, the Synod had rejected a plan of union with the United Presbyterian Church of North America in 1859. Debates on issues such as exclusive psalmody, the use of instruments in worship, and union with the UPCNA led to even further dissension and division in the church.www.gulfcoastpres.org/about.htm The first Stated Clerk of the RPCGS was Rev. John Black.www.thisday.pcahistory.org/2013/10/october-2/ The General Synod begun to shrinking in the 19th century and the early 20th century. At its low point the denomination had only 9 organized churches. In the 1940s and 1950s with new pastors it begun to grow, planting new congregations in the USA. In 1965 there were 28 churches.www.thisday.pcahistory.org/2014/12/december-16-the-duanesburg- fire-1951/ Merger with the Evangelical Presbyterian Church By the 1950s, the RPCGS had been moving away from its Covenanter heritage, including dropping its Reformation Principles Exhibited (1807) as a subordinate standard in 1959, and had also been looking to merge with another denomination. Eventually, thanks to influence of newer people in the denomination such as Gordon Clark, discussions began with the Bible Presbyterian Church-Columbus Synod, which included members such as Francis Schaeffer and Jay E. Adams. During the years of negotiations, the BPC-Columbus Synod would eventually rename itself, becoming the Evangelical Presbyterian Church. In 1965, after coming to negotiations that had included revising the Westminster Larger Catechism to be more open to Premillennial eschatology, and resolutions against alcohol, the Evangelical Presbyterian Church and the Reformed Presbyterian Church, General Synod celebrated a union at the EPC's Covenant College in Georgia, adopting the name the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod. The RPCES would eventually merge with the Presbyterian Church in America in 1982.

He made only one K League 1 appearance, playing 56 minutes of a 2–0 away loss against Pohang Steelers before being substituted with an adductor muscle injury; in May, he told his country's TVI 24 that while he was financially better off in Asia, he disliked the culture of longer working hours. Leixões brought Barros back to his homeland's second tier in June 2017, on a three- year deal. Injured in September, he had surgery on his right ankle in November, and was ruled out for a further four months. On 4 October 2018, having played one league match in the campaign, he reached an agreement with his employer to cancel his contract. Days after severing his link, Barros signed for Varzim S.C. of the same league on a deal effective from January 2019. In July, having contributed two goals in 19 games to stave off relegation, he earned another year at the Estádio do Varzim SC. On 6 February 2020, shortly after having become a free agent, Barros moved to third-division Valadares Gaia FC.

Known also as Tomlinson Chair Manufacturing Company Complex, it was listed on the NRHP under that name. The former manufacturing complex includes the oldest factory building in the city, and its renovation has been credited with making High Point a successful furniture exhibition center. A 16-story addition in 1990 is one of the city's tallest buildings. History of Tomlinson Chair Sidney Halstead Tomlinson Sr. started Tomlinson Chair Manufacturing Company in October 1900 in High Point, North Carolina, with 12 employees. The business was originally chartered under the name of Tomlinson of High Point, and operations started on January 1, 1901, with just 18,000 square feet of space its inaugural year. Sidney Tomlinson's brother Charles F. Tomlinson joined the company as secretary and treasurer in June 1904. The two brothers played major roles in starting the city's YMCA, chamber of commerce and library, and Emerywood Country Club. Tomlinson Chair was one of the first companies to make matching dining room suites. The company's styles included 19th Century French, English and American. Tomlinson was one of the first companies to show furniture in gallery style. According to a 1945 article in North Carolina's The State magazine, \\"In order to show [their] fine furniture to advantage, Tomlinsons devised displays in gallery form, thus originating a method which has affected the whole furniture industry, as display in galleries has developed into a center about which the manufacture and sales of distinctive furniture now resolve.\\" High Point's success as a furniture manufacturing city was \\"due in large measure to the success and leadership of the Tomlinson Chair Manufacturing Company\\", which was \\"one of the nation's largest, most profitable and most innovative furniture factories.\\" The term \\"Tomlinson Quality\\" was trademarked. Members of the Lambeth family were among the founders of Standard Chair Company in Thomasville, North Carolina, in 1898; the plant was the oldest in town in 1990.Bob Burchette, \\"Thomasville: Ready for Fresh Start,\\" Greensboro News & Record, September 23, 1990, Centennial section p. 82. James Erwin Lambeth and his wife Katherine Covington \\"K.C.\\" Lambeth started Erwin-Lambeth. The company added a new plant in 1947. Rod Lambeth bought Tomlinson Chair in 1987 and Erwin-Lambeth in 1989. In 2001, Tomlinson/Erwin-Lambeth, based in Thomasville, bought Directional Furniture. The companies were known for their \\"higher end\\" traditional furniture.\\"Tomlinson/Erwin-Lambeth to Buy Directional Furniture,\\" Greensboro News & Record, October 18, 2001, p. B8. Prior to Fall 2005, when the company moved to its own building, Tomlinson/Erwin-Lambeth had its showroom in the complex where Tomlinson once made furniture.Sue Schultz, \\"Trepidation precedes fall market's opening,\\" Greensboro News & Record, October 17, 2005, p. A1. Tomlinson/Erwin-Lambeth now makes upholstered furniture and occasional pieces. History of Market Square The Tomlinson Chair Manufacturing Company Complex was built between 1900 and 1927, with another addition in 1946.Paul Muschick, \\"Significant Structures: Architects to Tour High Point Showrooms,\\" Greensboro News & Record, April 28, 2002, p. R1. It includes the oldest factory building still standing in High Point, built between 1902 and 1906. A group of five- story buildings built between 1902 and 1911 are described as \\"brick Italianate industrial buildings with large segmental door and window arches.\\" A five- story building built between 1924 and 1927 served as offices and showrooms and was later renovated for showrooms and a restaurant. Also part of the complex were a smokestack and water tower. The older buildings were still used for manufacturing until the 1970s. In July 1981, a group of businessmen bought the 650,000-square-foot complex, with plans to turn it into a furniture showroom building.Jack Scism, \\"Taft to Republicans: Service to people over patronage,\\" Greensboro News & Record, July 9, 2006, People & Places p. 2. Market Square opened for the Spring 1982 Furniture Market. Jake Froelich, one of the owners, hoped furniture manufacturers would move their showrooms to the city.Jack Scism, \\"Remember When?\\" Greensboro News & Record, April 8, 2007, p. GRN21. When Froelich died at 72 in 2003, a Greensboro News & Record editorial said, \\"His far-sighted notion to remake an aging factory into Market Square forever changed the face of the Furniture City.\\"\\"Arts, Politics and Business Felt Jake Froelich's Impact,\\" Greensboro News & Record, May 2, 2003, p. A12. The Tomlinson Chair Manufacturing Company Complex was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 because it is \\"an intact example of the physical evolution of North Carolina furniture manufacturing plants during the first half of the 20th century.\\"Justin Cord Hayes, \\"More on History's High Points,\\" Greensboro News & Record, January 1, 2006, p. R2. Features include \\"windows, its arched entrances, metal water tower, steel ceiling beams and wooden support beams.\\" The nomination form said, \\"On both its interior and exterior, the Tomlinson Chair Manufacturing Co. complex provides a well- preserved example of the growth and development of the early 20th-century furniture manufacturing industry in North Carolina.\\" The 1983 listing included two contributing buildings and one other contributing structure on . The conversion of the Tomlinson complex has been given as a major reason for High Point's success as a furniture exhibition center.Paul Muschick, \\"Market Square Opens Show Under New Owners,\\" Greensboro News & Record, October 16, 1998, p. B2c. In 1990, a 16-story $16 million addition to Market Square opened, with showrooms on the first five floors, nineteen condominiums on the top four floors, and office space in the middle.Mark Sutter, \\"Luxury Living at the Top: Condos Offer Convenience Plus Spectacular View,\\" Greensboro News & Record, June 24, 1990, p. F1. In 1998, Merchandise Mart Properties, a subsidiary of Vornado Realty Trust, of New Jersey, bought Market Square for $100 million from George Lyles, S. Davis Phillips and Froelich, who remained as general manager. With 1.05 million square feet and plans for a 345,000-square-foot addition,Jane Secombe, \\"Vornado Buys Another High Point Showroom,\\" Greensboro News & Record, December 11, 1998, p. A1. Market Square was already High Point's second-largest showroom complex, with five restaurants, four exhibition areas, and walkways to a Holiday Inn and other showrooms. In December, the Guilford County Historic Preservation Commission agreed to allow the demolition of a drying kiln section built in 1946 in order to build the three-story addition on the West Commerce Street side, but the brick floor and handrail tracks would be preserved. So would a brick wall which was an exterior wall of the factory before the addition of the drying kiln. A brick facade in the new section would match the rest of the building.Paul Muschick, \\"Expansion Approved for Market Square,\\" Greensboro News & Record, December 22, 1998, p. B1. The Suites at Market Square opened in April 2000.Debra D. Bass, \\"Fancy Facades Are Latest Trend at Furniture Market,\\" Greensboro News & Record;, April 2, 2000, p. A1. As part of the expansion, a \\"nonworking replica\\" of a water tower was added which looked like the one used during the Tomlinson days, except with \\"The Suites at Market Square\\". The city objected, calling this a sign which violated city rules, but after negotiation, the city changed the rules to allow historic buildings to have signs.Sue Schultz, \\"City Allows Showroom to Keep Sign,\\" Greensboro News & Record, February 15, 2002, p. B4. In Spring 2010, Merchandise Mart Properties announced $1.5 million in renovations which included preserving the complex's history. Also in 2010, the High Point holdings of Merchandise Mart Properties went into receivership. High Point Acquisition Co. bought the properties in 2011, including Market Square and National Furniture Mart, for $139.5 million. The deal represented 2.1 million square feet of space. At a press conference on May 3, 2011, World Market Center CEO Bob Maricich and other officials of a new company announced the consolidation of what had been competing showroom facilities. International Market Centers (IMC), owned by Bain Capital and Oaktree Capital, with headquarters in both High Point and Las Vegas, bought the International Home Furnishings Center, Market Square and Showplace, representing about two- thirds of the city's 10 million square feet of showroom space.

The first club president was Frank Cook (eldest grandson of the company founder),Thomas Cook-The Holiday Maker, Jill Hamilton, Sutton Publishing,Glos. who had played his rugby at Mill Hill School. It ceased playing during both World Wars, and like many ‘house’ rugby clubs it no longer exists. At its most popular the club ran two XV’s until it closed in 1966. During its lifetime the club played against well over 100 different clubs in London and the South East. It also established a regular Easter tour to the Netherlands in 1958 playing RC Hilversum. which helped to promote Dutch rugby during the 1960s. The original tour fixture was filmed for Dutch cinemas and television in front of crowd of over 2,600 at the AGOVV Apeldoorn stadium in Apeldoorn.  Thomas Cooks Sports Club  Established in 1897, initially known as the ‘Ludgate Circus Athletic Club’, (after the company’s first London Head Office) when the existing football and swimming clubs amalgamated. The new club had four sections – football, swimming, cricket and tennis – and the playing facilities scattered across London. Despite having no ground, it proved popular and by 1902 the club was simply known as the ‘Ludgate Circus Club’. The company purchased land at Ravensbourne Kent and laid out a sports ground and erected a Pavilion. By 1905 it had become one of the finest private athletic grounds near London.Thomas Cook's Rugby Club, 1910-1966 published 2013, page 33, By the summer of 1911 the sports club had over 600 members. The rugby section was established in 1910 as the Ludgate Circus XV. After the First World War a new pavilion was built in 1922 opened by Thomas Cook's eldest grandson, the club's president Frank Henry Cook (1862-1931). The rugby club changed its name to Thos. Cook & Son's RFC in 1926 after the company moved to its new London Head Office in Berkeley Street Mayfair. During this time the annual summer Sports Day was held at Ravensbourne which became a popular date in the company's social calendar.  Honours Cap recipients  Probably an incomplete list, this was an established award to players for distinguished performance, discontinued after Second World War.

Coussens and Higgins were awarded their honour caps. Post war this dinner became less formal and often held in a pub.  Club Ground  The club sports ground had been purchased and laid-out around 1903 and established in 1905, at Ravensbourne in Kent. A new pavilion was built in 1922. In all internal communications the 'pavilion' was referred to as the 'club-house' by the rugby section. Location: Ravensbourne Avenue, Beckenham, Kent Telephone: RAVensbourne 6713 Resident stewards: Annie & William Dyer (1953-56), George & Gladys Gladdy (1956-75) After the company moved its Head Office to Peterborough in 1977, the club was renamed Thomas Cook Sports and Social Club. The Ravensbourne playing fields and pavilion were purchased by the Goan Association and used as a sports facility until tragically the old Mock-Tudor clubhouse opened by the founder’s grandson seventy-six years earlier, was burnt down in 1998 due to vandalism. It was then sold to Lewisham Council – now called Summerhouse Playing Fields as part of the wider Beckenham Place Park open space. During the war years (1939-1945) the ground was requisitioned by the army and the site used for anti-aircraft guns. Nearby at Crab Hill, a Prisoner of War Camp for Italians was established known as Summerhouse Camp 233, Thomas Cook's Rugby Club page 45 part of the Beckenham Place Park estate.

He was made free of the Company in 1454, and became a wool merchant. By 1460 he was dealing on a large scale, and in 1462 was described as 'of London, grocer, Merchant of the Staple of Calais'. In 1465 his former master, John Young, accused Crosby of 'counterfeiting his seal and making a false indenture', and the quarrel between the two had to be submitted to arbitration. By about 1469 Crosby was importing luxury fabrics, including damasks and satin, and exporting from England on Italian vessels. He was a Member of Parliament for the City of London in 1467-68, auditor from 1467-8, and alderman from 1468 until his death. In 1469 he became Master of the Grocers' Company, and in 1470 was one of the two Sheriffs of London. At about this time he was also Mayor of the Staple of Calais. By 1466 Crosby had amassed sufficient wealth from his trading ventures to obtain a 99-year lease of land from the prioress of St Helen's Priory in Bishopsgate, and to build Crosby Hall, a house which John Stow described as ‘of stone and timber, very large and beautiful, and the highest at that time in London’. The house was later taken over by Richard III; a scene in Shakespeare's Richard III is set at Crosby Hall.Crosby Hall Retrieved 16 August 2013. In 1502 Sir Bartholomew Rede, Lord Mayor of London, kept his mayoralty there. During the Wars of the Roses, Crosby's political sympathies were Yorkist. He is said to have influenced the decision of his fellow aldermen to commit the city of London to Edward IV, and in May 1471 he and other aldermen successfully resisted Thomas Fauconberg's attack on London Bridge, for which service he was knighted by the King at the foot of London Bridge on 21 May 1471. In accordance with the fluctuating Lancastrian and Yorkist fortunes, Crosby was pardoned four times:Sources differ as to the specific dates of the pardons. in April 1459 by Henry VI, in 1464 by Edward IV, on 10 February 1471 by the Readeption government of Henry VI, and again on 11 December 1471. Crosby was one of the ambassadors sent by Edward IV to Burgundy in 1472 and to Utrecht and Bruges in May 1473 to negotiate commercial treaties. Crosby made his will on 6 March 1471. He died five years later, in either January or February 1476, and was buried at St Helen's, Bishopsgate, where an altar tomb was erected to him and his first wife, Agnes. He and his two wives are also commemorated in a stone inscription in the steeple of All Saints church in Theydon Garnon, Essex.'Theydon Garnon', An Inventory of the Historical Monuments in Essex, Volume 2: Central and South West (1921), pp. 231-233 Retrieve 17 August 2013.

His widow, Anne, was bequeathed £2000, while his daughter, Joan, was to inherit his manor of Hanworth. He also left £100 for the repair of London Bridge, and a further £100 for the repair of Bishopsgate and the adjoining parts of London wall.

After Crosby's death, his widow is said to have married John Rogers, esquire. Crosby's only surviving child when he made his will in 1471 was an unmarried daughter, Joan. In Crosby's will she is referred to as Joan Crosby, otherwise Talbot, and it has been said that 'the alternative surname suggests that she may have been a natural child'. It is thought that she died between 1471, when Crosby made his will, and his death in 1476.

It is one of the most mysterious unsolved cases in German criminal history.  Background  In 1984, Günther Stoll, an unemployed food engineer from , was suffering from a moderate case of paranoia. Prior to his death, he occasionally spoke to his wife of \\"them,\\" unknown people who supposedly intended to harm him. He mentioned \\"them,\\" specifically, on the evening of 25 October 1984 (at approximately 23:00), before suddenly shouting \\"Jetzt geht mir ein Licht auf!\\" (\\"Now I've got it!\\"). He then wrote the six letters \\"YOG'TZE\\" (it is not conclusive if the third letter was intended to represent a '6' or a 'G') on a sheet of paper before instantly crossing them out. Shortly thereafter, Stoll went to his favorite pub in Wilnsdorf, where he ordered a beer and fell on the ground, injuring his face. Witnesses stated that he was not under the influence of alcohol and that he suddenly lost consciousness. He awoke and drove away in his VW Golf I. It is not known what he did in the next two hours. At around 01:00 on 26 October 1984, he went to , where he grew up. There, he talked to a woman he knew from his childhood and mentioned a \\"horrible incident.\\" Since it was so late at night, the woman advised him to go to his parents' place, and talk to them instead. He then left.  Discovery  At approximately 03:00, two truck drivers discovered Stoll's crashed vehicle in a trench adjacent to the A45, near the Hagen-Süd exit, from Haigerseelbach. Both truck drivers testified to having seen an injured person in a white jacket walking near the car. After calling law enforcement, the drivers found the severely injured Günther Stoll naked in his car. He was conscious and mentioned four male persons who had been with him in the car, and had run away. When asked if the men were his friends, Stoll denied it. He died on the way to hospital.  The investigation  The criminal investigation showed that Stoll was injured before the crash, and must have been hit by a car elsewhere, and subsequently positioned in the passenger's seat of his car and driven to the location where he was discovered. It was also concluded that he was naked at the time he was run over. Other drivers reported seeing a hitchhiker at the Hagen-Süd exit. Neither the hitchhiker nor the person in the white jacket were identified. Suspicions regarding Stoll's holiday trips to the Netherlands, where he was thought to have made contact with drug dealers, proved unfounded. The meaning of the letters \\"YOG'TZE\\" remains unknown, however, some suggest it may be properly read upside-down.  Television coverage  On 12 April 1985, the case was presented on the popular German television program Aktenzeichen XY … ungelöst.

It aired on Fox in the United States on March 9, 2014, and is directed by John Holmquist and written by Ted Jessup. In the episode Peter's mother, Thelma Griffin, dies of a stroke. After the funeral, Thelma's friend Evelyn arrives to support Peter, but ends up kissing him. The episode marked Lauren Bacall's final television role. Plot Lois gives Peter grief for eating an entire tube of raw cookie dough (which Peter thought was a sausage with raisins). At the Pawtucket Brewery, Peter is bored while sitting through a meeting until his stomach starts to give him trouble (as a result of the raw cookie dough and a taco he found in the parking lot) and he soils himself trying to get to the restroom while evading various people. When in the restroom, Peter is washing his pants with the toilet water. Depressed and exhausted following that incident, Peter (while wearing his shirt as pants) comes home from work to find his friends and family gathered in the living room. After a rant where he thought the incident at work had leaked out to Quahog, Lois tells him that they didn't find out about the incident and explains they found out his mother, Thelma, died of a stroke. After the service, a woman named Evelyn approaches Peter and tells him she was Thelma's closest friend and the two connect after she tells him about her husband, Walter, dying some time ago. The two begin spending much time together and Peter begins seeing her as a surrogate mother. Peter takes Evelyn to the bar and introduces her to Joe and Quagmire. When they leave upon being obviously disturbed by her (it was also shown that Joe was saving his regained walking ability for Susie's wedding as he abandons his wheelchair), Evelyn attempts to seduce Peter by kissing him. Later that night, Peter tells Lois what happened and she suggests Peter talk to Evelyn. When he confronts her, Evelyn lies and says her medicine made her act in an uncharacteristic way and the two become friends again. After spending more time with her, Peter realizes she was lying as she continues making advances towards him and immediately ends the friendship. The next day, he visits his mother's grave, where he sees Evelyn. Evelyn apologizes to Peter and explains that Peter's the first man to pay any real attention since her husband died, and she had taken advantage of that fact. Upon hearing this, Peter realizes that what happened between him and Evelyn was also partially his fault—due to missing his mom so much, he had looked to Evelyn as a replacement. Peter and Evelyn reconcile, but while they hug, Peter accidentally cracks Evelyn's spine, thus killing her. He places Evelyn on a nearby bench and immediately leaves her for the groundskeeper to handle. Meanwhile, Stewie develops a fear of death after Brian explains to him at Thelma's funeral that everyone is going to die at some point, including Stewie himself. Brian attempts to console him by seeking out several religions and showing Stewie their beliefs on the afterlife like visiting a Jewish temple, the Quahog Buddhists Temple, and a Catholic church. Stewie is unsatisfied (even after reading several religious texts) and asks Brian what he believes happens after death. Brian, despite the fact he went to Heaven in Stu and Stewie's Excellent Adventure and has also met Jesus Christ in person multiple times, believes that nothing happens after someone dies (reflecting his atheist views). This leads Stewie to believe that life isn't really worth living, and he then makes several unsuccessful attempts to commit suicide: 1.) He tries hanging himself where his head is too big, 2.) He tries to coerce Joe into shooting him, but fails and 3.) He tries the \\"toaster in the bathtub\\" trick, which gives him toast- making superpowers. During his final attempt by jumping out the window, he's stopped by Brian, who tells him that no one truly knows what happens after death and that he should seek out his reason to live. Stewie tells Brian that he has always wanted to be a singer-songwriter, but when he is about to sing to him, Brian just gives him a gun and tells Stewie to kill himself. Reception Eric Thurm of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C+, saying \\"The good parts of \\"Mom's The Word\\" are more than outweighed by how tonally inconsistent it is...it’s almost impossible to pay attention to the episode as a whole, especially when the episode attempts to do something a bit weightier than the show’s normal outings.\\" Thurm did however praise the sub-plot, saying, \\"the better plot spinning off is the Brian and Stewie B-plot (surprise, surprise).\\" The episode received a 2.2 rating in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic and was watched by a total of 4.56 million people. This made it the most watched show on Animation Domination that night, beating Bob's Burgers and two episodes of The Simpsons.

Her book Phantom Crown, a biography of the tragic life of Emperor Maximilan of Mexico and his wife Charlotte was turned into a screenplay by John Huston for the film Juarez (1939). Magic Fire, her biography of Richard Wagner, was made into a German film by William Dieterle in 1955.  Life  She was born as Bertita Carla Camille Leonarz on 1 November 1902 in Nuremberg, Bavaria. Her father, Emile Leonarz, was an engineer from the Rhineland. While working on a public street lighting project in Budapest in 1896, he married the Hungarian Countess Sarolta Poszte-Karoly. The couple had five children, two of which died in 1903 during a diphtheria outbreak. In 1904 the family moved briefly to Berlin and the following year to Mexico City where her father worked as general director of the Mexican steel industry. It was in Mexico City where Bertita was raised and spent her formative years. Her childhood was one of privilege. She attended a Catholic school, made trips to Europe and the United States, and learned German, Spanish, English, Hungarian and French. In 1912 the family moved to Monterrey. It was at this time that she began piano lessons. Her parents destined her to follow a career as a concert pianist. In 1923, she was sent to the United States to improve her English at Wisconsin University. While there, she met Jack Harding, a British-born American, who worked as advertising agent. The couple married on 7 October 1926 and settled in Indianapolis, Indiana. Bertita became a naturalized American citizen in 1927 and began to have some success as concert pianist. At the age of 28, she abandoned her career as a pianist and started to write Phantom Crown: The Story of Maximilian and Carlota of Mexico. The book sold well. In the following years she continued to publish more books about royalty and she became a well-known author. Her first book, Phantom Crown, was turned into a screenplay by John Huston for the film Juarez (1939). Invited by Warner Brothers, the studio that made Juarez, she moved with her husband to Hollywood in 1940 as she was offered a job as a writer for the studio. She spent winters in Indianapolis and the summers in Mexico. In 1940 she made a trip to Brazil that inspired her books on the House of Braganza of Brazil. The following year she began a career as lecturer, giving more than 120 lectures throughout the United States. During World War II, her husband served as lieutenant colonel and she sold war bonds in support of the troops. In the latter part of the 1940s Bertita published The Land Columbus loved, a traveling book written with her husband, and wrote, Mosaic, in the Fountain, an autobiographical book covering her childhood. The couple had an active social live and traveedl extensively as Bertita continued her series of lectures around the United States.

Her biography of Richard Wagner, was made into a German film, Magic Fire, by William Dieterle in 1955. She attended the premier of the film in London. In 1957 she married Count Josef Radetzky. The couple adopted a four-year-old Mexican orphan named Katya, but the marriage lasted less than one year. In 1961 she published her last book Concerto: a biography of Clara Schumann. Bertita retired to her Spanish Villa at Lomas of Chapultepec, spending her time painting. She did not finish a biography of Haile Selassie Emperor of Ethiopia. She fought breast cancer that metastasized to the bones. In May 1971 she married Halstead P. Councilman, an American business man who had been her friend for years.

In order to build the new facility, the town relied heavily on provincial and federal government subsidies as well as private donations. There remain some who doubt whether the town of approximately 4000 (and the surrounding municipalities) can afford to run such a facility. The strongest opposition has come from the area's rural municipalities. Further, the cost of the project has ballooned from an estimated $9 million to $11.8 million.

The field started to move around 9.30 pm on November 9. The slip site is approximately one kilometer from the 1986 slip site, which was twice as large as the one in 2016. The slip stopped at about ten meters from the house of Luc Normandin and its barn sheltering about sixty cattle. This natural disaster generated a large crater of the size of a baseball field, about 160 meters wide and a depth of between 2 and 10 meters, between farm buildings and the edge of the Champlain River. Thousands of tons of clay and earth slipped into the river bed completely blocking the flow of water over several tens of meters. The water has risen to make its way again. Two houses were evacuated and a 200-meter security perimeter was established around the crater.Paule Vermot-Desroches, journalist, newspaper Le Nouvelliste, November 10, 2016Amélie St-Yves, journalist, Journal de Montréal, November 11, 2016, page 9, article \\"Le terrain s'effondre à sa porte\\" (The ground collapses at its door).

The Portland and Rochester Railroad, established in 1867, was an important predecessor railway of the Rochester to Portland branch line of the Boston and Maine Railroad. It was founded in the merger of several smaller shortline rail transport companies, the oldest being the shortline York and Cumberland Railroad which was formed in 1846 to connect the seaport facilities of Portland, Maine, to the water powered manufacturing and textile industries along the Quampheagan Falls on the Salmon Falls River in the twin towns of South Berwick, Maine, and Rollinsford, New Hampshire (ca 1850). A year later another investor group began a railway leading inland to the upcoming mill town of Nashua, New Hampshire, inspiring the easier to construct leg founded as the Nashua & Rochester Railroad (1847). The York and Cumberland opened to Gorham, Maine, in 1851 under the direction of Maine railroad pioneer John A. Poor and was extended in 1853. The York and Cumberland was reorganized as the Portland and Rochester Railroad in 1867, and merged to the Nashua and Rochester, and was completed to Rochester, New Hampshire, in 1871, providing a connection to Canada via the Grand Trunk Railway in Portland to inland cities further west that connected to Worcester, Massachusetts. In 1883 this entity briefly merged with the Worcester & Nashua Railroad and became part of the Worcester, Nashua and Rochester Railroad, which three years later was succeeded by the Boston and Maine (leased the road rights in 1886, acquired ownership later) as it grew into the regional giant; the line is still owned by its successor.

The branch served the West Town and the Humboldt Park neighborhoods of Chicago and consisted of six elevated stations. It opened on July 29, 1895, and closed on May 4, 1952. Operations The Humboldt Park branch was a elevated line which served six stations. The branch separated from the Northwest branch northwest of the Damen station (originally called Robey), and ended at the Lawndale terminus. It ran immediately north of North Avenue between Hoyne Avenue and Lawndale Avenue.The Metropolitan West Side Elevated Railroad Metropolitan West Side Elevated Railroad. 1898. Accessed August 16, 2013 History The Humboldt Park branch had initially been intended to run to Harlem Avenue, a length of , although this never came to be due to that area being less developed in 1895, and Lawndale Avenue remained the branch's terminus for the duration of the branch's existence.Humboldt Park branch Chicago \\"L\\".org. Accessed August 16, 2013 The Humboldt Park branch initially had only five stops, until 1902 when a sixth stop opened at Humboldt Park Boulevard.Humboldt Park (3000W/1600N) Chicago \\"L\\".org. Accessed August 16, 2013 In 1906, the Chicago city council approved the Met's proposal to extend the branch westward to Harlem Avenue, running on an elevated structure to 52nd Avenue and then at ground level from there to Harlem Avenue, but construction was never implemented, even though said extension likely would have given the branch the ridership levels needed to maintain service after 1952. For the larger part of its service life, the Humboldt Park Branch was operated as a shuttle between Damen and Lawndale. For the first ten years, until 1904 when the Met converted their trains to multiple-unit operation, Humboldt trains only ran downtown via the Paulina Connector and Marshfield Junction during rush hours. Late night service operated as single car shuttles on the branch, and during off-peak hours, motor cars pushed trailers to Damen that were then coupled onto Logan Square trains for the trip downtown, and the process reversed on the outbound trip. In 1930, during the Great Depression, all stations on the Met branches were lengthened to accommodate eight car trains, including the Humboldt branch. During off-peak hours, the procedure of coupling Humboldt cars to Logan Square trains at Damen continued. During rush hours, Logan Square and Humboldt trains ran downtown, providing skip-stop service between Damen and Marshfield Junction. =Abandonment= The beginning of the end for the Humboldt Park branch was in 1947 when the CTA was formed to take over from the ailing Chicago Rapid Transit. Compared to their predecessor, the CTA intended to change things by adjusting the 'L' services to adapt to changing ridership patterns. The Humboldt Park branch was one line that they targeted for abandonment as early as 1949, but political pressure forced them to hold off. In August 1948, the CTA discontinued the practice of coupling Humboldt cars to Logan Square trains at Damen. Effective August 29th, off-peak Humboldt Park service was reduced to a shuttle between Damen and Lawndale. To provide a timed transfer to Logan Square trains to downtown, Humboldt cars were scheduled to arrive right before Loop-bound Logan Square trains, discharge and board new passengers, then cross back over to the outbound track and return to the branch. Rush hour through service was retained, although now all Logan Square trains serviced the Loop while Humboldt trains terminated at Wells Street Terminal. The 1950s brought bigger changes that would lead to the branch's abandonment. The first was on February 19, 1950, when the CTA discontinued evening and owl service. While minor, a bigger change happened in December of that year when the Logan Square branch was re-equipped with the 6000-series cars, whereas the Humboldt branch continued to use older wood cars. This led to a decline in Humboldt ridership as passengers preferred to go to Logan Square to ride trains with the newer cars. In 1951, the CTA made plans to close the Humboldt Park branch alongside the rerouting of Logan Square trains into the Milwaukee-Dearborn Subway. However, protests by aldermen and local residents pressured the CTA into keeping the branch in operation. Regardless, the opening of the subway on February 25th was the nail in the coffin for the Humboldt Park Branch. All Logan Square trains were rerouted via the subway, while the elevated tracks from Evergreen Junction (where the subway portal is located) to Marshfield Junction were taken out of revenue operation. As wooden cars were forbidden from operating in the subway due to fire safety concerns, Humboldt Park service was cut off from downtown, and reduced to a full-time Lawndale-Damen shuttle. In the interest of efficiency, the Humboldt trains no longer discharged passengers onto the inbound platform at Damen for a same-platform transfer to the Logan Square branch, but instead now boarded and discharged at a new temporary platform that was constructed over the inbound trackway at the junction where the two branches met, with a new walkway being built at track level to connect the shuttle platform to the inbound platform on the main line. At Damen Junction, the tracks were reconfigured with a spring-and-return switch that merged the eastbound and westbound tracks just before the shuttle platform. With ridership declines, and in spite of protests, service on the Humboldt Park branch ended on May 4, 1952. The line was demolished in 1953 from Lawndale terminal to Oakley Avenue. A three block stub between the Congress-Milwaukee tracks and Oakley Avenue remained intact for car storage including the shuttle platform until the late 1960s, when the Paulina Connector tracks from Evergreen Portal to Lake Street were demolished. Remnants of the junction were still visible in the structure at North Avenue until 1996 when the spans were replaced as part of renovation work on the Blue Line.

The incident happened at the Hollinwell Showground in Kirkby-in-Ashfield, in Nottinghamshire, England, and the exact cause has never been determined. The two leading theories relate to mass hysteria and the use of pesticides in nearby fields. Background In 1980 the Hollinwell Show, an annual event at the Hollinwell Showground near Kirkby-in-Ashfield, took place on Sunday 13 July. As part of the event the Forest League of Juvenile Jazz Bands decided to hold a charity show, creating a Junior Brass and Marching Band competition, with entrants coming from across the East Midlands. Around 500 children from 11 marching bands were in attendance, many of them brought in by coaches from up to away. With the show scheduled to begin at 9am, many of the children were tired from their journeys and nervous about performing. The incident At around 10:30 band members began to collapse without any apparent explanation, and the fainting seemed to be contagious. Children began \\"[falling] down like nine pins\\" according to one witness and soon the numbers of ailing children reached into the hundreds. Symptoms also included vomiting, sore eyes and throats, and dizziness. One girl described her symptoms: \\"My legs and arms felt as if they had no bones in them and I had a bad headache\\". The estimated number of victims was around 300, including children, adults, and babies, and 259 people were taken to four nearby hospitals including the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham, with nine children kept in overnight. A Fortean Times investigation reported that several horses were also taken ill, but admits that any link to the incident is conjecture. Cause The exact cause of the widespread illnesses is still disputed. Initial investigations by Ashfield District Council looked into a variety of possible causes, including contaminated water supplies, food poisoning, radio waves, and crop spraying of the nearby fields. The use of pesticides became the favoured explanation, with a 2003 episode of the BBC news and current affairs programme Inside Out revealing the local use of the pesticide tridemorph. Banned by the British government in 2000, tridemorph was discovered to be a harmful substance described by the World Health Organization (WHO) as \\"moderately hazardous\\". However, these investigations took place over 20 years after the event and disagree with the official findings. The official inquiry did reveal the use of Calixin, a pesticide that contains tridemorph, but it was not considered to be dangerous at the time. The official inquiry ruled that mass hysteria was the likely cause, with the symptoms experienced by the children demonstrating some of the characteristics of such an outbreak. People present at the event were adamant that the symptoms were real and not the result of imagination or hysteria. They also expressed their frustration at never having received a satisfactory explanation. The council has no plans to revisit the incident or reopen the inquiry. An episode of Punt PI on BBC Radio 4, in which Steve Punt investigated the incident, was broadcast on 24 August 2013. This was followed by a further examination during the second episode of Mystery Map on ITV on 27 November 2013.

Although considered state of the art when it opened, the gym certainly had its quirks that gave the Canaries one of the most unique home-court advantages in the sport. This led to more offence, including the February 19, 1971 evening when the head coach's son, Pat Sewards, scored a record 62 points in a little less than three quarters against Tamaqua HS, the highest one-game scoring for a player at the arena as well as the high school.

The area's trained female workforce was cited as a particular reason for picking Allentown. The facility would involve glass working and the production of vacuum tubes and quartz crystals. However, advances in technology meant that the plant's planned use would be very different. : With Bell Lab scientists and a skilled Allentown labor pool, Western Electric soon found itself at the forefront of the revolution in electronics. The plant would produce a tiny metal device about the size of a shoelace tip, serves nearly all the functions of a conventional vacuum tube, the transistor. On 1 October 1951 the world's first transistor production began at the Allentown plant. It would become the backbone of a communications revolution. Over the years the Allentown plant was at the forefront of the postwar electronics revolution.

However, according to Metzger, \\"It was on the wrong side of the street\\", and in 1918, the store moved to the more prominent north side, at 719 Hamilton where it remained for the next 69 years. Wetherhold & Metzger also had an uptown store in the 900 block of Hamilton Street. Over the decades, Wetherhold owned and operated about 11 stores under the names of Wetherhold, Shoe Rack, Kristy Shoes and Shoes by Gina. The store closed and was sold in May, 1987 with the demise of the Hamilton Street shopping district. In September, 2012, the store at 719 Hamilton was demolished, along with most of Allentown's mercantile history as a part of the Onc City Center/PPL Plaza/Reconnaissance Hotel construction project.Molovinsky On Allentown, The Radiation Mystery: Wetherhold & Metzger, Sep 27, 2012City-based Shoe Chain Reported Sold, The Morning Call, May 15, 1987by TOM MOYLAN, The Morning Call * Wright Montessori School (1915-1957) : 933 North Ott Street : Map location: : Private school, founded by Ada V. Wright in 1915, based on education principles of Maria Montessori. A teacher in the Allentown School District, she opened her first private school in 1915 at her father's home at 1449 West Turner Street with 15 students. In 1922 the school opened at a larger home at 1536 Walnut Street. The school moved to 922 Ott Street in 1940. The school on Ott street was built about 1917 by Maximilian Juruick, an engineer as a private home. It was the first home built on Ott Street. Juruick and his family moved out in 1923. It was a Muhlenburg College fraternity home during the late 1920s, however, in 1931 the Great Depression had reduced the number of students at the college and the fraternity closed its doors. Over the years, the school educated many of Allentown's wealthy students and future business and civic leaders. in 1950 it was the first co-educational private school in the state to have met the academic standards for membership in the Pennsylvania Association of Private Academic Schools. The school closed in 1957, shortly after Wright's retirement.

The show, narrated by Future Ted (Bob Saget), tells the story of how Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor) met his children's mother. Tracy McConnell appears in eight episodes, from \\"Lucky Penny\\" to \\"The Time Travelers\\", as an unseen character; she was first seen fully in \\"Something New\\" and was promoted to a main character in season 9. She is played by Cristin Milioti. The story of how Ted met The Mother is the framing device behind the series; many facts about her are revealed throughout the series, including the fact that Ted once unwittingly owned her umbrella before accidentally leaving it behind in her apartment. Ted and The Mother meet at the Farhampton train station following Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris) and Robin Scherbatsky's (Cobie Smulders) wedding; this scene is shown in \\"Last Forever\\", the series finale. The Mother's death from an unspecified terminal illness in 2024, also revealed in the series finale, received a mixed reaction from fans. In the alternate ending on the ninth season DVD, The Mother is still living when Ted is telling the story in 2030. Casting During its first eight seasons, the sitcom How I Met Your Mother often hinted at the unseen character of The Mother. Well-known actresses often made guest appearances on the show. Many fans expected that another would play the role, but creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas wanted an unknown. Using Anne Hathaway and Amy Adams as examples, Thomas said that \\"We didn't want it to be a big famous star because we didn't want the wider audience to have associations with whatever actress this would be ... The whole idea is that Ted's never seen this woman before, so it better feel that way to the audience\\", similar to how Cobie Smulders being cast as Robin Scherbatsky had \\"kept the show alive\\" when it began. They also did not want a large casting call. Bays and Thomas chose Cristin Milioti after seeing her on 30 Rock and Once; her musical ability was also helpful, as The Mother had been described as a band member. Milioti filmed her first scene for the last episode of season 8 having never watched How I Met Your Mother before. She only learned of the character's importance after binge watching the show during the summer. Character history The Mother was born on September 19, 1984. The Mother, joined by her roommate Kelly (Ahna O'Reilly), awaits the arrival of her boyfriend Max, only to receive a call informing her of his death. After the funeral service, she returns to the apartment to open Max's last gift to her—a ukulele. The Mother spends the next few years grieving the passing of the man she believes was her one true love. In \\"Wait for It\\", it is revealed that the short story of how they met involved her yellow umbrella. In \\"No Tomorrow\\", Ted finds the umbrella at a club and takes it home after attending a St. Patrick's Day party which she also attended, as it had been two and a half years since Max's death. She is still grieving, but Kelly encourages her to go out and date again, bringing her to the same bar where Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris) and Ted are celebrating. The two women run into Mitch (Adam Paul), her old orchestra instructor; The Mother offers to give Mitch her cello for his work at a school and they head to her apartment. Mitch tries to seduce her with a move called \\"The Naked Man\\", but she turns him down. Nevertheless, Mitch encourages her to pursue her dreams. The Mother expresses her desire to end poverty by taking up economics in college. On his first day of teaching as Professor Mosby, as seen in the season 4 finale \\"The Leap\\", he is seen in front of the classroom of students, one of which Future Ted says is the titular mother. But in the first episode of season 5, \\"Definitions\\", it is revealed that he was actually in the wrong classroom—Economics instead of Architecture. At the same time in \\"How Your Mother Met Me\\", the Mother sits her first session in Economics 305 and meets another graduate student named Cindy (Rachel Bilson), whom she offers to move in with her as her roommate. They see Ted enter the room, but when he announces the subject, The Mother thinks she is in the wrong room and runs off. She heads back to the room after seeing Ted scramble to his actual classroom. Later, in \\"Girls Versus Suits\\", Ted dates Cindy, not knowing that her roommate is his future wife. Throughout the episode, Ted notes that Cindy had spent most of their first date talking jealously about her roommate. When in Cindy and the mother's apartment he picks up many of The Mother's belongings, attempting to show how compatible he and Cindy are (thinking the items are Cindy's) and glimpses the mother's foot as she disappears into her room after taking a shower. Ted finds out at this time that she plays bass guitar in a band. Ted forgets to take the yellow umbrella with him when he goes out and Future Ted mentions, \\"And your mom ... well, she got her yellow umbrella back.\\" In \\"How Your Mother Met Me\\", it is revealed that, after Ted left the apartment, the Mother had discovered the umbrella and, upon going to question Cindy, finds her crying. As the Mother tried to console her, Cindy kissed her, revealing that her jealousy towards her roommate was actually a crush. While this incident made Cindy realise that she is a lesbian, it also made the Mother decide to go back into dating, as the kiss was her first in a long time. Some time after this, a man named Darren (Andrew Rannells) approaches the Mother and is welcomed into her band, Superfreakonomics. Darren gradually takes over the band, and becomes her nemesis. In the season 6 opener \\"Big Days\\" it is revealed Ted meets his future wife \\"the day of\\" the wedding at which he is the best man. In the episode \\"False Positive\\" Robin asks Ted to be her future best man, should she ever get married. In the episode \\"Challenge Accepted\\", it is revealed that Ted meets the mother of his children the day of Barney's wedding. In the last episode of season 7, \\"The Magician's Code\\" it is shown that Barney will marry Robin, and Ted will meet the Mother \\"the day of\\" their wedding. On the premiere of season 8, Ted's wife appears after Barney and Robin's wedding, outside at the \\"Farhampton\\" station while holding a yellow umbrella and her bass guitar. In the season 8 episode \\"Band or DJ?\\", Ted runs into Cindy and her partner on the subway and tells them that the band Barney and Robin hired to play at their wedding cancelled at the last minute. The end result of the encounter is that Cindy's (now ex-) roommate's band plays at Barney and Robin's wedding. The Mother is first shown meeting Louis (Louis Ferrigno Jr.) in \\"How Your Mother Met Me\\" as she is left to carry the band equipment while the now-lead band member Darren talks to his fans. Later at MacLaren's Pub, she tells him she's not yet ready to date. Louis asks her to give him a call if she changes her mind, and they begin dating not long after. They live together for the next two years, but she knows deep down that she doesn't love him. The Mother meets all of Ted's best friends—Barney, Robin, Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), and Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel)—before she meets him. The Mother is responsible for convincing Barney to pursue Robin, as revealed through a flashback in \\"Platonish\\". In \\"The Locket\\", Tracy meets Lily on a train journey. In \\"Bass Player Wanted\\", the Mother picks up a hitchhiking Marshall, carrying his infant son Marvin, on her way to Farhampton Inn. On their way, it is revealed that the Mother is a bass player in the band that is scheduled to play at the wedding reception, but Darren forced her to quit. The Mother ultimately decides to confront Darren and retake the band. Before she can, however, Darren walks up to her, furious the groom's best man punched him for \\"no reason\\", and quits the band. In \\"How Your Mother Met Me\\", it is shown that after this incident, the Mother returns to Louis' summer cottage not far from the Farhampton Inn where she has been staying for the duration of the wedding weekend. As she walks in the door, Louis proposes to her, but she goes outside to think about it for a few minutes. She looks skyward and asks Max for permission to let him go and move on; she takes a sudden gust of wind as a \\"yes\\", says goodbye, and declines Louis' proposal when she goes back inside. She leaves his cottage and checks in at Farhampton Inn. On her room's balcony, she plays the ukulele and sings \\"La Vie en Rose\\". Ted hears her singing from his room next door. In \\"Gary Blauman\\", Ted and the Mother are on their first date. Ted picks her up at her New York City apartment and they proceed to walk to a Scottish-Mexican fusion restaurant for dinner. On the way there, Ted is telling her a story when they nearly have a run-in with Louis. She says that she is in the \\"weirdest place on earth\\" right now and that it is too soon for her to be dating. Ted walks her back to her apartment. They say goodnight and Ted begins to walk away. The Mother then stops him and asks him to finish the story he was telling her. When the story is over, they say goodnight again. The Mother takes a step towards Ted and they kiss for the first time, before deciding to carry on their date. In a flashforward in \\"The Lighthouse\\", Ted proposes to the Mother at the top of the lighthouse near Farhampton Inn. She immediately accepts. In another flashfoward in \\"Unpause\\", the Mother is revealed to be pregnant with their second child, Luke, in the year 2017. She goes into labor while she and Ted are staying at Farhampton. =Name= The Mother's real name—Tracy McConnell—is not confirmed until the series finale, \\"Last Forever\\", when Ted meets her at the Farhampton train station. The name was hinted at in the season 1 episode \\"Belly Full of Turkey\\": Ted meets a stripper named Tracy and says \\"...that, kids, is the true story of how I met your mother\\". The children are horrified, but then he says he is joking, which led some fans to correctly guess that the Mother's name is Tracy. Fate In the series finale, it is revealed that six years prior to Ted telling the story to his children, Tracy died in 2024 from an undisclosed illness. In the finale, the characters do not directly state that the Mother is dead. Ted says that she \\"became sick\\" and his children said that she has been \\"gone\\" for six years. Many fans expressed considerable disappointment with the Mother's death. Milioti cried when she learned her character was supposed to die, but came to accept the ending was what the writers had planned from the beginning. Bill Kuchman from Popculturology said that the Mother was \\"an amazing character\\" and that \\"over the course of this final season HIMYM made us care about Tracy. Kuchman said that \\"asking fans to drop all of that with a simple line about The Mother getting sick and passing away was a very difficult request\\", that the finale \\"advanced too quickly\\" and that \\"HIMYM was a victim of its own success on this issue\\". A petition was started, aiming to rewrite and reshoot the finale. The petition has over 20,000 signatures and considerable online news coverage. On April 5, 2014, Carter Bays announced on Twitter that an alternate ending would be included on the Season 9 DVD. No new material was shot for this scene. In the alternate ending, The Mother is still living when Ted is telling the story in 2030. Future Ted is heard saying, \\"...When I think how lucky I am to wake up next to your mom every morning, I can't help but be amazed how easy it all really was...\\", indirectly stating that The Mother is alive. The video ends right after the train passes at Farhampton station and credits start rolling, implying that Ted never went back to Robin and went on to have a long, happy marriage with Tracy.

He was most known for being the son of Civil rights activist and minister Reverend Willie Taplin Barrow. Background =Early life and family= Barrow was born in Chicago and had a gospel singing background. He was the only child of his civil rights and human activist mother Rev. Willie Barrow, who was known as 'The High Priestess of Protest', and served the National Executive Director and chairman of the board of The Rainbow of Rev. Jesse Jackson's Push Organization/Coalition and Clyde Barrow, a welder. His mother would also become part of the gay-rights movement after Barrow revealed his sexuality to her. Barrow's first singing experience was in gospel music, as befitting the son of the famous Chicago minister. In his teens, Barrow headed a gospel group called the Soul Shakers. =Career= Leaving Chicago for New York City and soon after Los Angeles, Barrow signed with Columbia Records/CBS around 1976. Barrow's self-penned song, \\"Teach Me (It's Something About Love)\\", was a charting single for Blue Magic in 1976. It was taken from the band's fourth studio album Mystic Dragons, and charted at No. 48 on the Billboard R&B; chart. Barrow released his self-titled debut album, produced by MFSB guitarist/songwriter Bobby Eli, in the summer of 1977. His debut single from the album, \\"Precious\\" was issued to little success, like the album, although the second and final single \\"Mr. Magic Man\\" received some attention. For the album he recorded his own version of \\"Teach Me (It's Something About Love)\\". Afterwards he soon worked on his second album with producer Michael Stokes. The album, released in 1978, was titled Physical Attraction. Barrow's biggest hit and signature tune was \\"You Know You Want to be Loved\\" which went to No. 26 R&B; on Billboard's chart in summer 1978. This track, along with several others on the album, was penned by the songwriter Ronn Matlock. The song \\"Turn Me Up\\" also reached the charts the following year and remains a favorite among dancefloor aficionados, reaching No. 79 on the R&B; chart in early 1979. The title track \\"Physical Attraction\\" was another disco hit from the album, and the track \\"If Its Love That You're Looking For\\" was also issued as a single. In the summer of 1979, Barrow felt too ill to perform on stage in Paris. Complaining of feeling sick, he called his mother in America and ended up having to be taken to a local hospital. Despite the major setback of what was revealed to be HIV, Barrow switched over to the Capitol Records label and recorded and released his third and final studio album Just As I Am in 1980 before beginning his health decline, which featured the sole single \\"Why Love Half The World (When You Can Love The Whole World)\\". =Illness and death= He returned to Chicago from New York in June 1983, and was looked after by his mother, before being admitted to the Michael Reese Hospital, where he was diagnosed with AIDS. Barrow died of AIDS-related complications on October 22, 1983 at age 29. He was one of the disease's early victims. African American newspapers never mentioned the cause of his death. More than 1,100 people attended memorial services at Operation Push's Auditorium in Chicago for Barrow.

Atkinson (October 6, 1879 – May 16, 1958) was a Canadian American agronomist who served as the President of Montana State University from 1919 to 1937 and the University of Arizona from 1937 to 1947. He made a number of advances in farming methods, and developed the \\"Montana 36\\" wheat cultivar. Life and career Alfred Atkinson was born on a farm near Seaforth, Ontario, in Canada on October 6, 1879. His parents were Joseph and Isabella A. (Burns) Atkinson,Who's Who in American Education, p. 24. His paternal grandparents were James and Sarah (Cotton) Atkinson, who emigrated to Canada from Bradford, County of York (W.R.), United Kingdom.The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography, p. 322. He attended Ontario Agricultural College from 1899 to 1902, but left without earning a degree. He then enrolled at Iowa State University and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in agronomy in 1904.Cattell and Brimhall, p. 21. He obtained a position as an assistant agronomist at Iowa State's agricultural experiment station in 1902, and served there until 1904.Ohles, p. 56. Atkinson was named an associate professor of agronomy at Montana State College (MSC) in 1904, and served there until 1906. He also served during this time as an agronomist with the MSC agricultural experiment station. He was promoted to professor of agronomy in 1906. During his time as an academic, he published numerous papers on dryland farming, nitrate formation, soil moisture control, soil science, and agricultural practice. He developed several new farming methods, and developed a new cultivar of wheat named \\"Montana 36\\". Atkinson became a naturalized American citizen in 1911, and obtained a master of science degree from Cornell University in 1912. During World War I, Congress enacted the Food and Fuel Control Act (also known as the \\"Lever Act\\") to promote food production for the war effort. The United States Food Administration was established to implement the act, and an administrator appointed in each state to oversee these efforts. Atkinson was appointed Food Administration administrator for the state of Montana, and traveled the state extensively giving speeches, promoting modern agricultural practices, and exhorting farmers and ranchers to produce more.Malone, Roeder, and Lang, p. 252. University presidencies =Montana State College= Atkinson was appointed President of Montana State College in 1919. He received his doctorate from Iowa State University in 1920. Atkinson had the second- longest tenure as president (as of 2013) of any person at Montana State College, one which lasted 18 years (1919 to 1937). A firm believer in his predecessor's vision for the school, Atkinson worked hard to continue the rapid expansion of the campus. The iconic, domed Gymnasium Building (now Romney Gym) was built in 1922, replacing a dilapidated \\"drill hall\\" and giving the school's men's basketball team its first home court. The Heating Plant, Lewis Hall, and Roberts Hall followed in 1923. By the 1920s, the school was commonly referred to as Montana State College (MSC). Herrick Hall opened in 1926. The college was justifiably proud of its academic accomplishments, but its sports teams entered a golden age as well. In 1922, Atkinson hired George Ott Romney and Schubert Dyche as co-head coaches of the football and men's basketball teams. Between 1922 and 1928 (the year he departed Montana for Brigham Young University), Romney's football teams compiled a 28–20–1 record. This included the 1924 season in which his team went undefeated until the final game of the year. As co-head basketball coach, Romney's teams compiled a 144–31 record and invented the fast break. After Romney left, Schubert Dyche coached the \\"Golden Bobcats\\" team of 1928–29, which had a 36-2 record and won the national championship.The starting lineup consisted of John \\"Brick\\" Breeden, J. Ashworth \\"Cat\\" Thompson, Orlando Ward, Frank Worden, and Max Worthington. In his seven years as basketball coach, Dyche's teams compiled a 110–93 record (this included the dismal 1932–33 and 1933–34 seasons), but won their conference championship twice. In 1930, the college built Gatton Field, a football field on what is now the site of the Marga Hosaeus Fitness Center. In one of President Atkinson's last accomplishments, the Dormitory Quadrangle (now Atkinson Quadrangle) was built. The first three decades of the 20th century were rowdy ones on the college campus. Bozeman, Montana, had a large red-light district by 1900, alcohol was plentiful and cheap, and there was little in the way of organized entertainment such as theaters to occupy the student body. Like his two predecessors, President Atkinson sought to reduce what he believed were immoral student activities. Atkinson Quadrangle was built on the location of the \\"Bobcat Lair\\", a popular student drinking and dancing hangout, as part of this program. The college suffered greatly during the Great Depression. The price of agricultural products (Montana's economic mainstay) soared during World War I, as European and Russian farms were devastated by military campaigns and American and European armies demanded food. For a few years after the war, these prices stayed high. But as European agriculture got back on its feet, an agricultural depression swamped the United States beginning about 1923. State tax revenues plunged, and fewer buildings were constructed on campus after 1923. The United States entered the Great Depression in 1929. President Franklin D. Roosevelt established the Public Works Administration (PWA) in 1933 to provide federal funding for public works construction as a means of economic stimulus. But President Atkinson was strongly opposed to Roosevelt's New Deal, and refused to accept PWA funds to expand the college. With the state unable to assist, Montana State College stagnated through the 1930s. =University of Arizona= Atkinson served as president of the University of Arizona (UA) from 1937 to 1947. During his tenure, enrollment doubled and he greatly expanded the campus. Atkinson wished to undertake a rapid expansion of UA much as he had at MSC. He was not successful at first. When he tried to demolish Old Main in 1938, alumni reaction was so negative that he was forced to cancel the plan. Campus growth was slow, with only Pima Hall and the James Douglas Memorial Building for Mines and Metallurgy (built with a private donation) constructed prior to World War II. Enrollment, already low due to the Great Depression, dropped lower as young men enlisted or were drafted during World War II. The curriculum was significantly altered to emphasize vocational skills demanded by war production, and the United States Navy took over a number of campus buildings (including Old Main) and began training men and women for military service. One of the few scholastic changes which occurred during the war was the promotion of the School of Business and Public Administration into a college, and a change in governance that brought UA and the other two state universities under a single Board of Regents. After the war, the G.I. Bill and the end of the war led to a rapid rise in enrollment. To handle the significant influx of new students, Atkinson approved the construction of 114 Quonset huts on campus. Intended to be temporary, the Quonset huts lasted until the mid-1980s. Retirement and death After he retired, he served until 1955 as an advisor to the University of Arizona Board of Regents and to the State Colleges of Arizona. Alfred Atkinson died in Tucson, Arizona, on May 16, 1958. Legacy, other roles, and memberships Atkinson was active in a number of professional organizations. He served as the chair of the executive committee of the 5th Dry Farming Congress, and was a vice president of the Corn Association and the Plains Cooperative Extension Association. Atkinson was a member of the Council of Presidents of the Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges (now known as the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities), and served as its president from 1936 to 1937. Atkinson also served on a number of nonprofessional capacities as well. He was Montana's representative on the Northwest Planning Board (a federal power and transportation infrastructure planning agency) in the 1930s, and served on the Arizona Interstate Water Commission from 1948 to 1955. Atkinson was a Freemason, and a member of Phi Gamma Delta and Alpha Zeta. He was president of the Northern Pure Seed Company from 1906 to 1913, and consulted on farm crops with the Anaconda Copper Company. Personal life Atkinson married Barbara Miller of Whitby, Montana, on June 13, 1906. They had no children. References Bibliography *Cattell, J. McKeen and Brimhall, Dean R., eds.

The Kurdish Front operates in Kurdish and ethnically-mixed areas in northern Syria, such as the Sheikh Maqsood and Ashrafiyeh districts of Aleppo city, Afrin Canton, the Shahba region, and the northern Raqqa Governorate. It also fought as part of Fatah Halab in the Bustan al-Pasha, Haidariya, and Handarat districts of Aleppo city until November 2015, when Fatah Halab declared war on the Army of Revolutionaries. Ideology During an interview with the commander of the group, Haji Ahmed Kurdi, in April 2014, he stated that the Kurdish Front is part of a \\"project for a democratic Syria\\". The goal of the group is to establish a pluralist democracy in Syria, where \\"every people can live freely, those of different faiths can find their own space to live, and all constitutional rights will be guaranteed\\". In a May 2015 interview with Ahmed Barakal, another commander of the group, Barakal said that his group received support from \\"Western and Gulf sources\\", that the Kurdish Front was not affiliated with any political party, and that \\"we do not see the National Coalition as our representative.\\" History Muhammad Mustafa \\"Abu Adel\\" (left) and Shervan Derwish (right), two commanders of the Kurdish Front, in Qabasin during the signing of an agreement with other rebel groups in July 2013 The Kurdish Front Brigade was originally formed on 22 January 2013 as a subgroup of the Free Syrian Brigade in the Raqqa Governorate, affiliated with the Free Syrian Army, by Kurdish, Arab, and Turkmen fighters, some of whom defected from the Syrian Army, from the Raqqa, Aleppo, Latakia, Hama, and Homs governorates. Since its founding members of the group also maintained close ties to the Democratic Union Party (PYD), including military coordination with its armed wing, the People's Protection Units (YPG). Some members of the Kurdish Democratic Progressive Party also joined the Kurdish Front. After the Kurdish Front was formed, the influence of other Kurdish FSA groups such as the Azadî Battalion and the Saladin Ayubi Brigade began to decline. In early 2013, the Kurdish Front participated in the Siege of Menagh Air Base along with other rebel groups. On 28 May 2013, when several thousand FSA and jihadist rebels moved west to launch an attack on Kurdish fighters of the YPG in the Afrin region, the group withdrew its participation in the siege in order to join forces with the YPG to repel the attack on Afrin. The Kurdish Front joined the Revolutionary Military Council of Aleppo Governorate, led by Abdul Jabbar al-Oqaidi, on 7 March 2013. It was subsequently expelled from the council on 15 August, amid intensifying conflict between the Kurdish Front and its YPG ally on one side and Sunni Islamist rebel groups, including the military council, the al-Nusra Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), on the other. During the Battle of Tell Abyad in July 2013, the al-Nusra Front and (ISIL) captured the border town of Tell Abyad from the Kurdish Front and YPG. In early 2014, following several months of inactivity, the Kurdish Front re-emerged to collaborate with other Free Syrian Army groups and other rebel factions in attacks on ISIL. During the fighting with ISIL, on 17 February, Alaa Ajabu, Kurdish Front general commander also known by his nom de guerre Abu Satif, was killed in action. On 28 February, ISIL withdrew from the strategic border town of Azaz, which was then taken by the Kurdish Front, the Northern Storm Brigade, and al-Tawhid Brigade. The Kurdish Front briefly joined the Dawn of Freedom Brigades in March. In July 2014, the Kurdish Front and 10 other groups threatened to leave the frontlines in the Aleppo and Raqqa governorates if they are not aided by other rebels. The Kurdish Front, as part of Euphrates Volcano, re-entered the Raqqa province after they broke the Siege of Kobanî in February 2015. It also cooperated with the Levant Front and other groups in an attempt to advance into al-Bab and Jarabulus. = Army of Revolutionaries and Syrian Democratic Forces = On 3 May 2015, some of the former members of the northern branches of the Hazzm Movement, including the Atarib Martyrs Brigade, and the Syrian Revolutionaries Front along with the Kurdish Front, the Dawn of Freedom Brigades main component group the Northern Sun Battalion (making the Dawn of Freedom Brigades defunct in the process) and smaller FSA groups formed the Army of Revolutionaries. Many of the northern members of the Syrian Revolutionaries Front and Hazzm Movement also joined the Levant Front. On 8 June 2016, the Kurdish Front established an all-female unit called the Shahba Women's Protection Front. In August 2016, the Kurdish Front changed their logo, removing the Syrian independence flag in the process, though they kept the Arabic text. This represents the 4th logo the group has had. Their logos for their male and female units are different from the new main logo, as they sometimes employed Kurdish text. Their male unit is referred to in Kurdish as Hêzên Eniya kurdan (HJK) and their female unit as Hêzên Jinên Kurdan (HEK). On 6 October 2017, the first regiment of the Kurdish Front was formed in the Shahba region, consisting of 236 fighters.

Their initial employment lasted for six months, or the duration of the voyage, whichever was the longer time. After this they became \\"pensioners\\" and had to serve 12 days per year as well as whenever called upon. They paraded annually in Perth at the Pensioner Barracks. Many enlisted in the British Army as boys, around 15–17 years of age, and served in many parts of the world including India, Afghanistan, China, Crimea for about 21 years before being pensioned off. This meant a number of guards were under 40 years of age and had young families when they came to Western Australia. As an incentive they were promised a two- roomed cottage and a plot of land sufficient to grow crops, vegetables and keep livestock. It was a chance for a new and better life and a large number of families remained as settlers.Enrolled Pensioner Guards’ display material provided by Army Museum, Fremantle. Pensioner Guards, State Library of Western Australia. http://www.slwa.wa.gov.au/dead_reckoning/government_arch In 1858, many of the Enrolled Pensioner Guards in the colony contributed to the Indian Relief Fund that had been set up in England following the Indian Mutiny of 1857. Many of the EPGs had served in India with the British Army before their retirement. The mutiny led to the ending of the East India Company in 1858, and the establishment of the British Raj. A settlement for the Pensioners was established near Lake Coogee in 1876, and ruins of two stone cottages from this time are extant, along with a well on the shore of the lake. This location was chosen as it lay on the main route from Fremantle to Albany, but was never popular and although a few cottages, gardens, and orchards were established the settlement did not flourish. John Hyland, James Cunningham, and John Gilbride were involved in this settlement. The site lies within the buffer zone of the Woodman Point wastewater treatment plant. After 1880, they were known as the Enrolled Guards.

J., et al. (2007). Defining the limits of taxonomic conservatism in host–plant use for phytophagous insects: Molecular systematics and evolution of host–plant associations in the seed-beetle genus Bruchus Linnaeus (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae).

Several occur in other parts of the world, such as North America, Africa, and Australia, as introduced species. Several species are notorious agricultural pests. The genus is part of the subfamily Bruchinae. Members of the subfamily are known commonly as bean weevils. Many authors prefer to call them seed-beetles or bean beetles, because they are not true weevils, and because in most species, the larvae develop inside seeds, particularly beans.Kergoat, G. J. and N. Alvarez. (2008). Assessing the phylogenetic usefulness of a previously neglected morphological structure through elliptic Fourier analyses: a case study in Bruchus seed-beetles (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae). Systematic Entomology 33(2), 289-300.Tuda, M. (2007). Applied evolutionary ecology of insects of the subfamily Bruchinae (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). Applied Entomology and Zoology 42(3), 337-46. Because Bruchinae was known as the family Bruchidae until the 1990s, they are sometimes still called bruchid beetles. Description The genus Bruchus is well-defined by a number of characters, such as the shape of the pronotum, an arrangement of spines or plates on the tibia of the middle leg of the male, and the unique morphology of the male genitalia. The latter are slender and elongated,Kingsolver, J. M. Handbook of the Bruchidae of the United States and Canada (Insecta, Coleoptera), Volume I. Technical Bulletin 1912. USDA ARS. 2004. pg. 69. and the eighth abdominal sternite in particular is large and sclerotized, \\"with a characteristic boomerang shape\\". This part of the genitalia has been called the \\"urosternite\\", but other authors suggest the term \\"ventral plate\\" is more appropriate. The robust ventral plate of Bruchus helps distinguish the genus from other seed-beetles, which tend to have vestigial or lobe-like ventral plates. The ventral plate is useful in identification because each species seems to have a distinctive shape to it, and it does not vary among individuals of one species. In general, these beetles have black bodies with patterns of white or yellow setae. Some species have red or red-orange legs. The elytra are marked with straight lines. Biology Bruchus are specialists, feeding and developing almost exclusively on plants of the legume tribe Fabeae (Vicieae), which includes peas, sweet peas, lentils, and vetches. Examples include cow vetch (Vicia cracca), which is attacked by at least nine Bruchus species, common vetch (Vicia sativa), which is host to five recorded species, and meadow vetchling (Lathyrus pratensis) and tuberous pea (Lathyrus tuberosus), which are each attacked by four species. Some Bruchus species are monophagous, living on just one host plant species. Some species of Lathyrus have an antipredator adaptation that may have evolved in response to Bruchus and other seed-beetles. The fruit pods develop a callus when attacked, by the beetle, and this growth is mediated by bruchins, compounds so far known only from seed-beetles. These beetles are univoltine, producing one generation per year. The female lays eggs on the fruit pod of its host legume in spring and summer, and the larva enters a seed to develop. The adult emerges, but remains in diapause through fall and winter, waiting until spring to reproduce. Impacts Among the major agricultural pests in the genus are B. lentis on lentils, B. pisorum on peas, and B. rufimanus on fava beans. Bruchus species are among the worst pests of lentils, in one study causing a 30% loss of a crop.Laserna-Ruiz, I., et al. (2012). Screening and selection of lentil (Lens Miller) germplasm resistant to seed bruchids (Bruchus spp.). Euphytica 188(2), 153-62. While many seed-beetles are pests of stored bean supplies, Bruchus species do not reproduce in postharvest dry bean stores, just in beans on the plant in the field. One species has proved more useful. B. rufipes was found inside jars of Spanish vetchling (Lathyrus clymenus) seeds in the ruins of Akrotiri, a settlement on the island of Santorini destroyed in the Minoan eruption of its volcano.Panagiotakopulu, E., et al. (2013). Ancient pests: the season of the Santorini Minoan volcanic eruption and a date from insect chitin. Naturwissenschaften 100 683-89. The inhabitants used the vetchling seeds for food.Melamed, Y., et al. (2009). Lathyrus clymenum L. in Israel: A \\"revival\\" of an ancient species. Israel Journal of Plant Sciences 57(1-2), 125-30. Charred remains of B. rufipes, a pest of the plant, were recovered from the jars and the chitin was successfully radiocarbon dated, providing evidence that the date of the eruption was between 1744 and 1538 BC. Systematics Linnaeus erected the genus, and initially it contained almost all the known species of seed-beetles. The genus was divided over time and many species were distributed into new genera. Some authors, though, continued to classify new seed-beetles in Bruchus, creating a disorganized taxon full of species quite obviously unrelated to one another. Today, after revisions, the circumscription of Bruchus is relatively clear.Kergoat, G. J., et al. (2011). Phylogenetics, species boundaries and timing of resource tracking in a highly specialized group of seed beetles (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae). Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 59, 746-60. Phylogenetic analyses have shown that the genus as it is now defined is monophyletic, but also that two of the seven groups in the genus are \\"potentially paraphyletic\\". As of 2008, about 36 species are in the genus. Species include: Bruchus atomarius Bruchus rufimanus Bruchus affinis *Bruchus affinis *Bruchus altaicus *Bruchus anatolicusAnton, K.-W. (1999).

He also played Sheriff Powers on another western series, The Adventures of Champion. Early years Mitchell was born in Charleston, South Carolina. His Episcopal minister father headed Porter Military Academy before he was appointed Episcopal Bishop of Arizona, which took the family to that state. In 1938, Mitchell left Arizona to study singing in Hollywood. He attended Hampden–Sydney College and Sewanee: The University of the South. He appeared and sang baritone on Broadway during the 1930s. He also appeared on Broadway in Song of Norway (1944). Acting career Mitchell made his television debut at the age of 40 on January 1, 1951, in the syndicated western series, The Range Rider. On that series through January 1, 1953, he made ten other appearances, mostly as a law- enforcement officer, the genre in which he specialized. He was also cast in 1951 as a waiter in the episode \\"Bad Man of Brisco\\" of another syndicated western series, The Adventures of Kit Carson. He appeared in that same series twice in 1952, both times as a marshal, in the episodes \\"Trouble in Tuscarora\\" and \\"Golden Trap\\".

He also had roles in several films, mostly uncredited, before and after those particular television appearances. By 1965, he had appeared in 20 films. Ewing was cast in seven episodes each of The Gene Autry Show (1951-1953) and Gene Autry's related The Adventures of Champion (1955-1956).

In 1958, he was cast as Fred Gerlock in \\"The Red Flannel Shirt\\" of the syndicated anthology series, Death Valley Days, hosted by Stanley Andrews. That same year, he made two appearances on John Payne's NBC western, The Restless Gun, as Dawson in \\"Gratitude\\" and as Sheriff Frank Kemper in \\"Bonner's Squaw\\". It was Sky King, a contemporary western which originated on radio, with which Mitchell was most identified. He played the sheriff of fictional Grover County, Arizona. The series starred Kirby Grant as rancher Sky King who spent more time in his plane, the Songbird, than riding his horse. Gloria Winters played Sky King's niece, Penny, and early in its run, Ron Hagerthy was cast as the nephew, Clipper King. The episodes on which Mitchell appeared began with \\"Manhunt\\" and \\"The Neckerchief\\" and included \\"Geiger Detective\\", \\"Land o'Cotton\\", \\"Rodeo Round-up\\", \\"Bad Actor\\", \\"A Dog Named Barney\\", \\"Sky Robbers\\", \\"Bounty Hunters\\", and \\"Dead Giveaway\\", his last appearance having been on March 1, 1959.

In his later years, Mitchell managed several ranches he owned in Southern California. He died in 1988 at the age of 77 of a stroke caused by a fall from a ladder in La Jolla in San Diego County, where he had resided. Mitchell was married and had two sons.

It was published in 1995 by Cleis Press. Most of the works in the book involve topics relating to LGBT and specifically gay and lesbian homosexuality issues. Forbidden Passages features works seized at the Canada–United States border by the Canada Border Services Agency which were intended for delivery to the store Little Sister's Book and Art Emporium in Vancouver. The book won the Lambda Literary Award in the Editor's Choice category at the 8th Lambda Literary Awards in 1996; also receiving a nomination in the anthologies category. Background Forbidden Passages features works seized at the border between Canada and the United States by the Canada Border Services Agency which were intended for delivery to the store Little Sister's Book and Art Emporium in Vancouver. The book's proceeds went to legal costs incurred by the bookstore during its court case against the censorship by Canada, Little Sisters Book and Art Emporium v. Canada. The bookstore was close to bankruptcy at the time subsequent to anti-pornography initiatives carried out by the Canadian government. Publication history A paperback edition of Forbidden Passages was published by Cleis Press in 1995. It was published again as an eBook the same year. Contents The introduction by Little Sisters manager Janine Fuller explains the chronology of events surrounding the confiscation of literary works by the government of Canada that were intended for the store. A preface to the book by Patrick Califia argues strongly against the censorship by Canada. Califia writes: > \\"You may not agree with many of the things I've said, or some of the > positions I take in my work. Perhaps you won't like some of the passages > that appear in Forbidden Passages. But don't you think you ought to have the > right to read them in the first place? ... If you buy only one gay or > feminist book this year, it should be Forbidden Passages. ... Buy this book, > hold a benefit, make a donation. Gag the state, before it chokes you!\\" Most of the works in the book involve topics relating to LGBT and sexuality. Forbidden Passages includes \\"Egg Sex\\" by Susie Bright, about how pregnancy impacted her sexual wants. The book features pieces banned in Canada written by authors including: Kathy Acker, Dorothy Allison, Dennis Cooper, Marguerite Duras, bell hooks, John Preston and Jane Rule. Reception =Awards= Forbidden Passages won the Lambda Literary Award in the Editor's Choice category at the 8th Lambda Literary Awards in 1996. It also received a nomination in the anthologies category. =Reviews= Forbidden Passages received a favorable review from Publishers Weekly which was heavily critical of the censorship by Canada. The review wrote that the prefaces about censorship written by Califia and Fuller were more crucial to the book than the literary passages included therein. The reviewer concluded: \\"Cleis is helping by donating proceeds from the book to Little Sisters; librarians can help by stocking this informative book in all public and academic libraries in the U.S.\\".

The Perris Block lies between the Santa Ana Block to the west and the San Jacinto Block to the east. Earth Resources Technical Report PREPARED FOR: RIVERSIDE PUBLIC UTILITIES BY: POWER ENGINEERS, INC, June 2010, p.3 The Perris Block, was named by Walter A. English in 1925 for the city of Perris, located near the center of the block.Walter Atheling English, Geology and Oil Resources of the Puente Hills Region Southern California, Geological Survey Bulletin 768, U.S. Government Printing Office, 1926. Structurally stable for millions of years, the Perris Block is an internally unfaulted, eroded mass of Cretaceous and older granitic rocks of the Southern California Batholith and metasedimentary basement rocks. These rocks compose various ranges of mountains and hills and monadnocks and underlie the valleys within it. It is bounded on the west by the Chino Fault and Elsinore Trough, on the east and northeast by the San Jacinto Fault Zone including the San Jacinto Valley graben. It is bounded on the north by the Cucamonga Fault Zone, in the San Bernardino Valley and San Jose Hills Fault in the Pomona Valley. To the south, the Perris Block is bounded by the San Felipe Fault Zone between it and the Temecula, Aguanga, and Anza sedimentary basins that lie between Temecula and Anza.Morton, D.M. and Matti, J.C., A vanished late Pliocene to early Pleistocene alluvial-fan complex in the northern Perris block, Southern California.

The interior of the Perris Block has various low bedrock mountains, hills and bedrock plains with intervening sediment-filled valleys, that make up six erosional surfaces sculpted by the effects of the vertical oscillation of the block during the Plio - Pleistocene era.ALFRED O. WOODFORD, JOHN S. SHELTON, DONALD O. DOEHRING and RICHARD K. MORTON, Pliocene-Pleistocene History of the Perris Block, Southern California, Geological Society of America Bulletin, 971 Northern Perris Block The northern part of the Perris Block lies north of the Santa Ana River. Here in the Pomona Valley and San Bernardino Valley it has been mostly buried by the sediments from the Transverse Ranges as they rose over the last 2-3 million years. Exceptions are the Jurupa Mountains and Pedley Hills that still rise above that deposition. The now obliterated Slover Mountain also did so before it was mined out of existence. These sediments under the Pomona and San Bernardino Valleys form the Inland Santa Ana Basin aquifer. East of the Santa Ana River lie the La Loma Hills, Box Springs Mountains and northeastward of them, across the canyon of Spring Brook and of the Pigeon Pass Valley, the range of mountains formed by Blue Mountain, Reche Summit, Olive Hill and the Kalmia Hills that border the northeast edge of the Perris Block along the San Jacinto Fault Zone to the Perris Plain. Central Perris Block The western side of the central Perris Block and across its width eastward south of the Santa Ana River, is bordered by the range of the Temescal Mountains. They run southeastward along the Elsinore Trough to the Temecula Basin. Eastward, these mountains run to the south of the Santa Ana River to Sycamore Canyon, bordering on the Box Springs Mountains. They enclose the Gavilan Plateau and partially enclose the Riverside Valley on the west, south and east. They extend their ancient eroded surfaces eastward to the Perris Plain and the Plains of Leon, which they border on the west, southward to the Temecula Basin. =Perris Plain= The Perris Plain, an uplifted peneplain, is drained primarily in the San Jacinto Basin, the San Jacinto River watershed flowing into Lake Elsinore, that is dotted by monadnocks and by several other ranges of mountains and hills. Above the San Jacinto Basin, the northwest corner of the Perris Plain is drained by Sycamore Canyon and Tequesquito Arroyo into the Santa Ana River. Below the San Jacinto Basin, the Perris Plain is bounded on the south by the Plains of Leon, which continues the plains of the Perris Block and by the mountains of the southern Perris Block.

After making only six league appearances for the Reds, McAllister caught the eye of Scottish Premier Division side Dunfermline Athletic, who signed him in July 1990. Although McAllister remained at East End Park for two and a half seasons he made little impact at the club, managing only six Premier Division appearances for Dunfermline. In August 1992 McAllister was loaned back to Cliftonville, making three league appearances.

It is home to the New York Knights of the USA Rugby League, though it is primarily used by youth and high school athletics. Pier 40 was originally one of five \\"finger\\" piers numbered 37 through 41, which were owned by the government of New York City, and were used by various transport companies. In 1956, the city announced a plan to consolidate the five piers into a single large passenger and cargo terminal serving the Holland America Line. Construction began in 1958 and the terminal was opened in 1962. When the Holland America Line moved to the New York Passenger Ship Terminal in 1974, the pier continued to be used by ships until 1983. Afterward, the New York State Department of Transportation purchased the pier as part of its failed Westway expressway proposal, with plans to use the pier for parking. Pier 40 was redesignated as parkland in 1998; several options for the structure were proposed, including redevelopment as a soccer stadium or an entertainment complex. It reopened in 2005 as a sporting complex within Hudson River Park. The former cargo terminal is the largest structure in Hudson River Park, with an area of , and houses the Hudson River Park Trust's offices. Various park tenants host activities in Pier 40 as well. Sports include baseball, football, soccer, boat building, rowing, trapeze arts, and rugby among others. Despite its popularity, the terminal is dilapidated and sinking into the Hudson River, and was previously proposed for closure due to its deteriorated condition. History = Cargo terminal and parking lot = The side of Pier 40. Prior to the construction of Pier 40, five city-owned \\"finger\\" piers were located at the site. From south to north, these were Pier 37 (at Charlton Street), Pier 38 (at King Street), Pier 39 (at West Houston Street), Pier 40 (at Clarkson Street), and Pier 41 (at Leroy Street). Companies using the piers in the early 20th century included the Southern Pacific Transportation Company, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&W;), and the Atlantic Transport Line. By the 1950s, the piers were used by the DL&W; and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.See:  * The current Pier 40 was proposed as a passenger and cargo terminal in February 1956 by the city's Marine and Aviation Department. The plan was put forward to allow the Holland America Line to move its area operations from Hoboken, New Jersey on the other side of the Hudson River, where the company was based for 73 years. It was the first terminal of its kind to be built by the city, and was designed as a \\"massive hollow square\\" with three levels to accommodate cars, taxis, and commercial trucks. The massive four-block structure replaced the five smaller \\"finger\\" piers. Construction began on July 31, 1958, at a projected cost of over $18 million. The pier began operations in 1962, with Holland America signing a 20-year lease for over $1.2 million in annual rent. * For discussion of the rent, see: Holland America also moved its offices from the Financial District to Pier 40. In its first year in operation, Pier 40 served over 2,000 passengers daily. In 1971, the Pier was taken over by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Holland America moved their operations to the New York Passenger Ship Terminal in Hell's Kitchen in 1974. Pier 40 ceased serving ships at that time, and ended all operations around 1983. Following the cessation of maritime operations, in 1982 the Pier was purchased by the State of New York for the failed Westway project. Under the New York State Department of Transportation's operations, its primary use was as a parking complex for cars, buses and trucks, as well as commercial warehousing.See: * * Bus, truck, and warehousing activity ended in 2004. = Park use = The facility was rededicated under the Hudson River Park act of 1998. At this time, two small athletic fields opened on the pier's roof. Between 1998 and 2003, several plans abound for the redevelopment of the site. One was an entertainment complex featuring movie theaters and Cirque du Soleil performances. Another plan sought to construct a public high school along with swimming pools and retail space, in addition to conventional sports fields. Additional plans called for a branch of the Guggenheim Museum, and a big-box store. Ultimately, a plan backed by the community won out, and the pier currently serves the dual purpose of commercial parking garage (located in the outer perimeter of the pier) and a multi-purpose sports facility (encompassing the center of the facility and small sections of the upper level). The main field, occupying the former cargo level, began construction in 2004, and opened in May 2005 with Governor George Pataki and professional soccer player Eddie Johnson in attendance. The sports fields were intended as an interim solution, until a major development would take place. According to the Hudson River Park Trust, the facility generates $6 million in operating revenue and 40 percent of the entire park's annual operating budget. Following Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the pier was closed after being engulfed by more than of water. The fields reopened on December 19 following a $50,000 donation to fix the damaged turf surface, while full power was restored by spring 2013. Condition and use left Pier 40's design resembles a square donut, with the three decks hollowed in the center by the central courtyard. The outer facade consists of tan brick and blue-grey enamel. The outer decks, also referred to by the Hudson River Park Trust as the pier's \\"shed\\", are wide. The pier's base is made of concrete. Extending west out of Manhattan island over the Hudson River, the pier is held up by more than 3,500 steel H-pile girders reinforced by concrete sunk into the river. At the southwest corner of the site is a \\"finger pier\\" extending a further west. According to several reports, the Pier is severely dilapidated and gradually sinking into the Hudson River. Sections of the roof have fallen in, and portions of the garage, a stairwell, bathrooms, and one of the upper fields, have been closed since 2012. A 2014 report found that over half of the facility's 3,500 steel girders that hold it above the river are severely deteriorated, possibly due to the electrical rust-protection system being shut down during the 1970s fiscal crisis. The turf field is also subject to flooding and warping after heavy precipitation, even though turf fields are typically designed to optimize drainage. In spite of the revenue the facility generates, Hudson River Park officials have discussed closing the park due to the $7 million annual financial burden required to maintain it. =As a marine terminal= The pier's three decks were used for the loading and unloading of cars, taxis, and trucks, which alleviated congestion on local streets. The ground floor was dedicated to cargo operations, with the central courtyard utilized for the parking and loading of up to 350 trucks simultaneously. The second floor was used for passenger operations, serving taxis picking up arriving passengers, and featuring a furnished waiting room. The roof served as parking for over 700 cars, and ramps connected the three levels. =As Hudson River Park= The pier's outer decks now act as a parking garage. The car park, a self-parking facility, has a 1,700-car capacity (formerly accommodating approximately 2,000) and serves over 1,500 drivers. The upper-level recreational area, opened in 1998, features two fields (one small field and one soccer field) and a \\"flying trapeze\\" operated by the Trapeze School of New York. The fields were resurfaced in 2004. The rooftop field measures . The main athletic field at ground level (called the courtyard field) is constructed of modern artificial turf manufactured by FieldTurf, consisting of plastic grass blades submerged in recycled rubber pellets. Construction of the field began in 2004, and the field was opened in May 2005. The regulation-size baseball field is located at the southwest corner of the park, while the Little League/softball field is located at the northeast corner. Both fields feature imitation-dirt turf cut- outs, base anchors, dugout, and synthetic turf pitching mounds. Indoor batting cages are located near the baseball field. The center of the park (east-to- west) is marked up for football, with movable goal posts and practice sleds. Several movable soccer goals are also located around the ground floor field, which can be set up into two or four soccer pitches covering each half or each corner of the field respectively.See: * * At some point, black nets were installed around the field to prevent balls from flying into the asphalt walkway that surrounds the perimeter of the sports field. The facility also features twelve stadium lighting fixtures, allowing night games to be played. Prior to 2008, Public Schools Athletic League (PSAL)-sanctioned high school baseball games could not be played at Pier 40. This was because the portable mounds owned by the facility, which were in diameter, did not meet the specifications of the league. The portable mounds (as opposed to a permanent dirt mound) were required to maintain the multi-purpose status of the field. In 2008, after lobbying by the nearby Stuyvesant High School, a new mound was purchased from an Iowa-based company that was in diameter. The new mound, consisting of a center and two side pieces, was the first mound of its kind, and allowed for PSAL league games to be played. Spaces on the southern side of the pier are occupied by several nonprofit organizations such as the Village Community Boathouse, the River Project, and New York Outrigger, as well as a commercial a kayak shop. The Village Community Boathouse builds and stores traditional wooden rowboats there. During the summer months these boats, called Whitehall gigs, are launched at least twice weekly for free public rowing trips up and down the Hudson River. There is also a mooring field, maintained by the Hudson River Park Trust, that offers seasonal and daily moorings for recreational sail and motor boats. Future development Pier 40's entrance When established as a park in 1998, Pier 40 was zoned for exclusively entertainment and retail purposes, with half of the pier required to be set aside for recreation. Because of the facility's condition, several proposals have been made to increase revenue to the park for repairs, which were estimated to cost anywhere between tens and hundreds of millions of dollars. A 2012 proposal from local real estate developer and former Friends of Hudson River Park chairman Douglas Durst would consolidate the current parking facilities from a self-park to three-level stacked parking, freeing up 500,000 square feet on the roof for commercial space. The plan did not gain support. A 2014 proposal would demolish and redevelop the building across the street into a residential and retail facility over the course of 10 years, which would require the sale of Pier 40's air rights but would generate an estimated $100 million in revenue. This plan was reportedly canceled following public and political opposition. In 2012, reports surfaced that the then-new Major League Soccer team New York City FC, which plays at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, were seeking to develop a new soccer stadium at the Pier 40 site. Renderings of this proposed stadium were leaked online. The plan was scrapped in 2015 due to local opposition.

She served primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic as an ocean escort. She was named for Chicoutimi, Quebec. Background Flower- class corvettes like Chicoutimi serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail- driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which – in the Royal Navy – were named after flowering plants. Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas. Construction Chicoutimi was ordered on 20 January 1940 as part of the 1939-1940 Flower-class building program. She was laid down 5 July 1940 by Canadian Vickers Ltd. at Montreal, Quebec and launched 16 October later that year. On 12 May 1941, Chicoutimi was commissioned at Montreal. She was one of the few Flower-class corvettes not to have her fo'c'sle extended. War service After arriving at Halifax on 17 May 1941, she was initially assigned to Sydney Force. In September 1941 she joined Newfoundland Escort Force as a mid-ocean escort. She served the next five months escorting convoys across the Atlantic. In February 1942, Chicoutimi was reassigned to the Western Local Escort Force (WLEF). She served with WLEF until August 1944. Beginning in June 1943, she did so as part of escort group W-1. In August 1944, Chicoutimi was sent to join as a training ship. She remained so for the rest of the year and into early 1945. In April 1945, she rejoined Sydney Force and remained with that unit until the end of the war. She was paid off at Sorel, Quebec on 16 June 1945. The ship was sold in June 1946 and broken up at Hamilton.

The southern front of the manor was on the edge of St. Lawrence river. The depth of the lordship was heading north, parallel to the Lordship of Batiscan (on West side). The northern boundary of the Lordship of Sainte-Anne-de-la-Perade stopped at the north-western boundary of St. Joseph row, in Sainte-Thècle. In comparison, the lordship of Batiscan spanned 20 \\"lieues\\",A \\"lieue\\" is an old unit of length formerly used in Europe and Americas. A \\"lieue\\" was a unit of length equal to the distance that a man can go on foot in an hour. For example, the former \\"lieue\\" in Paris (before 1674) is , or . beyond the Saint-Maurice River. The western boundary of the manor cut the Batiscan river at the rapids of Manitou, between Saint-Adelphe and Saint-Stanislas. The estates of the north shore of St. Lawrence river fell within the stately administrative division of Trois-Rivières. The Lordship of Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade was divided into two areas: 1\\\\. Western half of the lordship was located between the Lordship of Sainte-Marie, the Lordship of Batiscan (west) and the eastern half of the Lordship of Saint-Anne-de-la- Pérade; 2\\\\. Eastern half of the lordship skirted the Western half. Both territories were included mainly in the municipality of Sainte-Anne-de-la- Pérade, in the MRC Les Chenaux Regional County Municipality, in the administrative region of Mauricie. Established in 1627 in New France and abolished in 1854, the feudal system allowed the state to divide the territory into fiefs and lordships to sustain the momentum of colonization. This stately institution allowed the distribution and land use by controlling the development. In each fiefs or manors, lords attributed byDeeds stipulated the rights and obligations of each party lots to the highest bidder settlers (charging system). These could lease them back to other settlers. The person was granted by the State territory became lord. The concession contract required him to be operating his lordship. The seigneurial system is based on the feudal system that subjected the census (referred to as \\"habitant\\" in New France) to the Lord. Based on the principle of entrepreneurship, the seigneurial system stimulated colonization efforts. Toponymy The name \\"Lordship of Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade\\" takes its name from the Sainte-Anne river which flows into the St. Lawrence river (North shore) at the height of Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade, located about east of Trois-Rivières. From its source at Lake Anne (in the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve), the Sainte-Anne river follows a path of about . The river crosses the municipalities of Saint- Alban, Quebec of Saint-Casimir and Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade. In 1609, the river was named \\"Sante-Marie\\" by Samuel de Champlain, who used the same name in his book from 1632, titled \\"Les Voyages de la Nouvelle-France occidentale dite Canada\\" (The Travels of the western New France called Canada). However, the map drawn about 1641 by Jean Bourdon--which describes the course of St. Lawrence river, between Tadoussac and Montreal--refers to the river as \\"R St Anne\\", without any explanation for this original Christian toponym. Finally, the last name is required. In popular usage, the river is called \\"Sainte-Anne- de-la-Pérade\\" because its mouth is located in the municipality of the same name. The name \\"Lordship of Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade\\" was formally recorded on February 3, 1983 in the register of place names at the Commission de toponymie du Québec (Geographical Names Board of Québec).  History  =Colonization Movement= The colonization of the lordship of Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade began with a leading front on the north side of St. Lawrence river. Initially, the second row was not implemented because of the swampy (including peat) land. In a second stage of colonization, the settlers chose to settle along the Sainte- Anne river. Then, the expansion to the second row away from streams, rather orientation towards Charest River and its main branch the stream Gendron. This rises to the top the morraine in the territory of Saint-Stanislas (east side of the Batiscan river), descends into the morraine and through the village of Saint-Prosper before emptying into the Charest river, almost at its mouth. Charest river latter flows into the Sainte-Anne river. The most favorable overland road to move from St. Lawrence river sector to the Rivière des Envies sector is to cross the morraine (about a kilometer) west of the village of Saint-Prosper, on the course of the present route 159. The road of row Saint- Auguste at the foot of the morraine and parallel to it connects the village of Saint-Prosper and Sainte-Geneviève-de-Batiscan (through the Rivière à Veillet road). =Timeline= # 1667, the first installations of the pioneers in the territory of the Lordship. Note: in the Lordship of Champlain, colonization began in 1664 and in the Lordship of Sainte-Marie in July 1669. # In 1670, Sieur Amelin (Hamelin) gets the concession rights in this sector. # October 29, 1672, steward Jean Talon of the New France grants manorial rights to Edmond de Suève and Thomas Tarieu Lanaudière, in the Sainte-Anne River area. The extent of the manor is 1.5 \\"lieues\\" of frontage on one \\"lieue\\" deep. Under the concession, the lord of Lanaudière have bought the land from Mr. Amelin (Hamelin) in 1672. # 4 March 1697, the government of Trois-Rivières authorizes an expansion of 3 \\"lieues\\" deep, which is granted by the Governor Frontenac and Intendant Champigny Marguerite Denis, widow of Thomas Tarieu Lanaudière. # On 6 April 1697, the government of Trois-Rivières grants the islands on the St. Lawrence river, located in front of the manor. This new concession will be officially certified on October 30, 1700. # The order of January 8, 1710, granted Pierre-Thomas Joliette Tarieu the enjoyment of the islands located in front of the lordship, while coseigneur François Chorel of Saint-Romain, said Orvilliers, sees dismiss. An increase to 30 October 1700, is the lordship Tarieu. # November 10, 1772 - Charles-François Tarieu Lanaudière transfers the rights to the lordship to his son Charles-Louis de Lanaudière. # Feb 13. 1781 - Charles-Louis de Lanaudière fully owns the rights to the Lordship. # November 11, 1811 - With only daughter, Marie-Anne Tarieu Lanaudière acquired by succession manorial rights of his father Charles-Louis de Lanaudière. # September 27, 1819 - Marie-Anne Tarieu Lanaudière sells its rights to the lordship of Sainte-Anne-de-la-Perade to John Hale. # December 24, 1838 - Following the death of John Hale, the Lordship of Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade is now co-owned by his children: George Carleton, Edward Jeffery, Bernard, Richard, William Amherst, Francis, Isabella, Mary and Henry. # December 18, 1854 - Abolition of the feudal regime in Lower Canada.

Career Reuben graduated from the Medical Training Center Nairobi with a Diploma in Pharmaceutical technology (1982). Reuben worked for the Kenya ministry of health then went to work for central bank of Kenya before branching into business. He is a director of Holfar Products and a partner in a publishing company in Nairobi. He has worked with the Read for the Top project run by Canadian NGO Tembo Kenya donating and providing reading books for the schools in Kakamega County. He spent several years in Canada and he spend some time at Carleton University studying Political Science (1999).

He studied Political Science at Carleton University in Ottawa Canada Politics The vetting committee Nyangweso first tried his hand in elective politics in 1997 when he ran a very successful campaign against the KANU establishment candidate and won the nomination but was narrowly beaten by the opposition candidate for the Lurambi constituency seat. It was whispered that the KANU establishment decided to lose the seat rather than have someone within the party whom they could not control. He tried again for that seat and was unsuccessful. Reuben was very active in the constitutional referendum and after the establishment of the counties he rightfully realized that the responsibilities of the county governments would require enlighten leadership. He thus opted to run for county representative and was elected to the Kakamega County Assembly. He served as the leader of the majority in the Kakamega county Assemble in the first session of the County assemble. In 2014 he was elected to the Chair of the Kakamega County Public Service & County Administration Committee as well as Vice Chair of Liaison Committee between the Legislative and Executive. Kakamega County is one of the largest counties in Kenya by population and resources; the county government is expected to convert people's expectations into tangible results, Reuben plans to play a key role in that transformation. Leadership On 8 May 2013 Reuben led other County representatives in Kakamega in a coordinated walkout to assert their right to the constitutionally mandated pay and other compensation which the National government wanted to reduce, obstinately to reduce cost but overtly to test the will of the counties to protect their turf. In early 2013 police investigated an incident in which the majority leader in the Kakamega County Assembly, Mr. Reuben Nyangweso, allegedly threatened a Kenya Power worker with a pistol. (newskenya.co.ke and ) This allegation was found without merit, and the police apologized to Mr. Nyangweso. Mr. Nyangweso runs a pharmacy and other businesses in Kakamega town besides serving the county as their elected representative. The USA Government Affairs Institute of Georgetown University ( GAI) provides courses and training for public servants to optimize the relationships between and among the various branches of government. On 29 February to March 3 GU held the Executive – Legislative branches relations course. One notable attendee was Hon Reuben Nyangweso of Kakamega County Assemble. He was notable because he was the only foreign attendee among the various high ranking US government officials attending. It’s necessary that both branches learn to work together within the bounds of the law. This course curriculum and presenters emphasized the importance of each branch of government observing the founder’s intent. GAI’s mission is to provide education and training about congressional processes, organization, and practices, and about selected legislative policy issues. By better understanding the functions and organization of Congress, executive branch personnel and others with a direct interest in federal programs can more effectively plan, manage, and budget for those programs, and better represent those programs before Congress.

Johansen is one of only a few women in the world to have headed a national football association, along with Lydia Nsekera, the former president of the Burundi football association, Izetta Sombo Wesley, the former leader of the Liberia Football Association and Sonia Bien-Aime of the Turks and Caicos Islands Football Association. Isha Johansen is the owner and CEO of Sierra Leone National Premier League club F.C. Johansen. Early life and family Isha Johansen was born as Isha Tejan-Cole in Freetown, Sierra Leone, into the Tejan-Cole family, who are of Aku Mohammedan descent. She was immersed in football from the very beginning, as her father co-founded East End Lions F.C. in Freetown. Her father took her to see football matches, and she played football with her brothers and their friends. She was educated at a convent school in Freeport and a boarding school in Yeovil, England. She was raised in a religious Muslim family. She is married to the Norwegian Consul in Sierra Leone, Arne Birger Johansen. Football Isha Johansen founded her own football club, F.C. Johansen, in 2004. The club was started with the objective of giving guidance and opportunities to children whose lives had been disrupted by the recent Sierra Leone Civil War (1991-2002). It began playing in Division One in 2011 and was promoted to the Premier League the following year. Johansen was elected president of the Sierra Leone Football Association (SLFA) unopposed on 3 August 2013, after her main opponent, former Sierra Leone international footballer Mohamed Kallon was disqualified by the Sierra Leone Football Executive committee for not meeting the SLFA residency requirement in the country. Kallon appealed his disqualification, but the FIFA delegation to Freetown confirmed the disqualifications of Kallon and two other candidates (for links to gambling), so Johansen was unopposed. When Sepp Blatter was pressured to step down as head of FIFA, Johansen was touted as a possible successor in the press. She launched Powerplay, an initiative to encourage women and girls to play the game and to help empower them. It has the support of FIFA and the Confederation of African Football. She also started the annual African International Youth Tournament in 2009. On 7 September 2016, SLFA President Isha Johansen, Vice President Brima Kamara and Secretary General Christopher Kamara were jailed by the Anti-corruption Commission for failing to provide reports regarding the SLFA's financial statements and the use of money. The trio were released after posting bail. FIFA defended the SLFA in a letter, stating, \\"FIFA has no reason to suspect there has been misuse of funds that FIFA has provided to the SLFA\\", having audited the SLFA's accounts earlier in the year. Other activities In 1993, she became the first woman publisher in the country's history, producing Rapture Magazine, an entertainment publication. She was also contributing editor to Ovation magazine. She founded the Pink Charity Fund to combat breast cancer in 2006 and the Women of Excellence Awards.

He served from 1904 to 1919. A group of historians named Hamilton one of Montana State's four most important presidents in 2011. Early life and career James M. Hamilton was born on a farm on October 1, 1861, in Crawford County, Illinois, to James and Mary (Burner) Hamilton. He was the ninth of 10 children. His Presbyterian paternal grandparents emigrated to the United States from Belfast, Ireland, shortly after the American Revolutionary War. His Lutheran maternal grandparents came from what is now Germany at about the same time. Although his paternal grandparents settled in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania and his maternal grandparents in northern Virginia, they both settled in Licking County, Ohio, in the 1820s. James' parents met there, and married in 1838.Burlingame, p. vii. About 1850, a large migration of Licking County residents began into the Wabash Valley of Illinois, and his parents were among them. James grew up near Licking Township and attended local public school. His father died when he was 14 years old, and James began working during the spring, summer, and fall in order to support his family. He attended school only in the winter, which prevented him from graduating from school until he was 18 years old. (Most children graduated from high school at about age 16 at the time.) After graduation, James worked as a public school teacher in rural Illinois public schools from 1879 to 1882. Hamilton enrolled at Union Christian College in Merom, Indiana. The date of his entry is not clear. He worked at a number of jobs to pay for his education, and he graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1887. He then entered the graduate program at Union Christian, receiving either a master of artsBurlingame, p. vii-ix. or a master of science degreeNational Education Association, p. 273. in 1890. While in the graduate program, he married Emma Shideler of Merom on June 6, 1888.Burlingame, p. ix. =Role in Montana's educational system= Hamilton obtained a position as superintendent of the public school system in Sumner, Illinois, in 1887. He worked there until 1889, when he moved to take a similar position in Missoula, Montana. Montana became a state on November 8, 1889. In 1893, the state legislature began considering legislation to establish a state college system. The Montana State Teacher's Association (now MEA-MFT) advocated that a single college be created rather than several. Hamiltion was elected president of the teachers' association in December 1892. Hamilton traveled to the new state capital, Helena, to lobby for a single college. But listening to the debates there convinced him that multiple campuses would be more likely to win legislative approval in Montana's bitter political climate (in which towns and cities lobbied hard to undercut one another in an attempt to reap state largesse). The legislature subsequently passed legislation establishing two colleges. It also established a State Board of Education in 1893, and Hamilton was appointed a member. While serving on the board, Hamilton chose the sites (Missoula and Bozeman) for the two state colleges, their first presidents, and their first faculty members.Burlingame, p. vi. After eight years of service, Hamilton resigned from the State Board of education and took an appointment as a professor of history and economics at Montana State University (Missoula) (now known as the University of Montana). He was promoted to vice-president of the school a short time later. In 1901, the same year that he began teaching at the University of Montana, he began a five-year term as a member of the Montana State Textbook Commission, which chose textbooks for public schools in the state. Montana State University Hamilton Hall on the MSU Campus, named for Emma Hamilton, wife of MSU President James Hamilton The Montana State Board of Education appointed Hamilton to be President of what was then known as the Agricultural College of the State of Montana (now Montana State University). The first president, Augustus M. Ryon, had only served for a year before coming into significant conflict with faculty and local businesspeople who disagreed with his intent to build a technology-oriented engineering school. His successor, the Rev. Dr. James R. Reid, was a Presbyterian minister and educator who rapidly expanded enrollment, obtained a campus, and oversaw the construction of the college's first two buildings—the Agricultural Experiment Station (now known as Taylor Hall) and the Main Building (now known as Montana Hall). Reid was determined, however, to stop students from dancing, drinking, gambling, playing cards, and soliciting prostitutes (common distractions in a frontier town like Bozeman), and his constant anti-vice campaign took a significant toll on his health. He resigned in 1904. Hamilton's governance style was unlike the authoritarian Reid. He was friendly and outgoing, which made him popular among state legislators, local Bozemanites, and students, but he was also a decisive leader who rarely deviated from a course of action (once decided upon). He was also interested in ensuring that Montana State adopted the most modern educational models available, and he traveled widely in Europe in 1912 in order to keep abreast of ongoing changes in European institutions of higher education. Determined to make the college into a school of technology, Hamilton rapidly expanded the curriculum in areas such as biology, chemistry, engineering, geology, and physics. He also devised the school motto, \\"Education for Efficiency\\", which the college continued to use until the 1990s. Further marking this change in direction, the school was officially renamed the Montana College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts in 1913 (although that name was in widespread use as early as 1894). The college's first great rapid expansion of physical plant also began under Hamilton. Constructed during this time were Linfield Hall (1908), Hamilton Hall (1910), and Traphagen Hall (1919). Hamilton Hall was named for Mrs. Emma Hamilton, the popular and vivacious president's wife who died on August 12, 1909. The giant whitewashed \\"M\\" on the side of the Mount Baldy in the foothills of the Bridger Range was first built in 1916, and in 1917 ROTC came to campus for the first time. Hamilton married Florence Ballinger, an instructor in the Department of Home Economics, on August 21, 1918.Burlingame, p. x. When World War I ended in 1919, Hamilton resigned as president of the college. He argued that a younger man (he was 58 years old by now) should take over. Hamilton accepted the position of Dean of Men in addition to resuming his teaching duties in the Department of Economics. =Retirement= While continuing to teach, Hamilton also continued to attend school. He enrolled in classes at Cornell University, Harvard University, the University of California, and the University of Chicago. He wrote a \\"Montana Supplement\\" in 1921 for the civics textbook used in Montana high schools. Hamilton continued to take on a number of professional roles as well. He was elected President of the Montana State Teacher's Association in 1922 and 1923, and as of the 1970s remained the only person to hold the office three times. He was also elected president of the Inland Empire Teachers Association in 1923,Cattell, p. 550. and remains the only person to hold both the Montana and Inland Empire presidencies concurrently. =Death= Hamilton cut back his teaching load in 1935 to write. He completed two manuscripts during this time. One was History of Yellowstone National Park (Previous to 1895), and the other was From Wilderness to Statehood: A History of Montana, 1805-1900. Neither was published in his lifetime. In 1957, Florence Hamilton asked Dr. Merrill G. Burlingame, a professor of history at Montana State College, to edit the latter manuscript into a book. This book was published in 1957, and a revised edition (with a new chapter by Burlingame) issued in 1970. In the spring of 1940, Hamilton suffered a stroke. Although it was not considered serious, his health failed rapidly during the summer. He died at his home in Bozeman on September 23, 1940. His funeral was held in what is now Romney Gym, attended by all the faculty and students of Montana State College as well as many members of the public.Burlingame, p. xi. Legacy, other roles, and honors Hamilton was a member of the Unitarian Church. He was an active Freemason, becoming a Master Mason in Bozeman Lodge No. 18. He was also a member of St. John's Commandery of the Knights Templar, the Algeria Temple of the Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, and the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks.Burlingame, p. x-xi. He was a founding member of the Bozeman Rotary Club. Hamilton also maintained memberships in Phi Kappa Phi and Sigma Chi. Three times, Montana State honored him. The first was on October 18, 1929, which was proclaimed \\"Dean Hamilton Day\\" in honor of his 25th year of service to the college. That same day, he was elected the first president of the newly formed \\"Quarter Century Club\\" (an association of college faculty and staff with twenty-five years or more of service). In June 1930, Montana State University conferred upon him an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. In 2011, three historians who wrote a history of MSU were asked to name Montana State University's most important presidents. Pierce Mullen, Robert Rydell, and Jeffrey Safford named Hamilton one of the four top presidents in the university's history. The others were Roland Renne, Leon H. Johnson, and William Tietz. Hamilton, the scholars said, turned Montana State from an ill- defined, small school into a large agricultural college with a strong but narrow focus. His stamp on the university would remain well into the 1950s.Schontzler, Gail. \\"Presidential Debate: Who Were MSU’s Most Important Presidents?\\" Bozeman Daily Chronicle. July 17, 2011.

Until 1772 the town was located in the historical territory of Ruthenia, in the Ruthenian Voivodeship of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, thereafter until 1919 became part of the Austro- Hungarian Cisleithanian crown lands in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria (Galicia). From 1919 until 1945 the town was once again part of Poland within the Tarnopol Voivodeship. The town is located 8 km north-east of Zolochiv on the west bank of Western Bug River. Etymology The town's original Polish name Sasów also written as Sassów is derived from the Jan Daniłowicz family coat of arms \\"Sas\\" (Saxon) clan, itself derived from the medieval 12th-century German migrants of Saxony, see Transylvanian Saxons. In Ruthenian (Ruś) language the town name was Sassíw. History In 1511, the rural settlement of Komarów (Ukrainian Комарiв) became the property of Anna Sienieńska and was a key part of the commune of Olesko, located in the historical state of Ruthenia, Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia. In 1605, Olesko and Olesko Castle became the property of wealthy landowner and nobleman Jan Daniłowicz herbu Sas, Voivode of the Ruthenian Voivodeship and grandfather of later King Jan III Sobieski. With the sanction of King Sigismund III Vasa, Sasów town was founded in place of the settlement of Komarów in 1615 by Jan Daniłowicz and granted town charter status in the Ruthenian Voivodeship, the town was named Sasów (Sassów) after Jan Daniłowicz' Sas clan coat-of-arms. With its town charter status modeled on the Magdeburg rights, Sasów was permitted a degree of internal autonomy, hold fairs three times a year which took place at ceremonies of Saint Stanislaus, Saint Michael and Saint Nicholas, as well as trade fairs and auctions every Wednesday and Saturday, its residents (burghers) were also exempt from public taxation for a period of 4 years, and perpetually from tolls and customs duties applicable on Ruthenian lands, with exception of the frontier duty. King Sigismund III Vasa also ordered construction of a highway, which was to pass through the town, on the highway leading from Lviv, Kamianets-Podilskyi, Bar, Terebovl and Ternopil to Kremenets, Lutsk, Horodło and Sokal. The town had a defensive character and was located on an important trade route from Podolia in Volhynia, where merchants passing through would stop in Sasów, thus developing its economy. At the top of nearby Mount Grodzisko was the castle. The town easily achieved economic and commercial prosperity. In 1628 there was already the first wooden church, and in 1631 a Catholic parish. 1638 the town became a paper mill, exporting to Germany, France, Russia and Turkey, where the tradition continued into the 19th century with the new Paper Products Works building in 1860, which at that time was considered to be the largest in Europe. In Vienna, middlemen would cut, package and place Viennese or French brands to Sasów produced paper. The Sasów paper mill operations remained until 1915, where during World War I it was destroyed by the Imperial Russian Army. To date, the buildings remain unoccupied. In 1648, Sasów was besieged by attack troops of Tatars, where King John II Casimir Vasa defeated them and freed the town from siege. In August 1649 citizen of Sasów defend the town from further attacks by the Tatars. In 1675, Turkish forces attacked Sasów. The town and castle were burned, and many of its inhabitants were killed. After the attack, King Jan III Sobieski became the town patron, who would often together with his wife Marie Casimire Louise de La Grange d'Arquien hunt in the woods of Sasów. In 1682, Sasów lost its town rights, and during the first half of the 18th century James Louis Sobieski' daughter - Maria Karolina Sobieska Duchess of Bouillon - conveyed Sasów to the Polish magnate Radziwiłł family, from there the town would later succeed into the hands of Count Starzeński. Between 1772-1918 the town was part of the Austro-Hungarian Cisleithanian crown lands in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, from 1867 Sasów belonged to the administration district of Zolochiv. Throughout this period, Sasów was inhabited by Poles and Ruthenians (with a town population total of 2,697 according to the census of 1857). A Roman Catholic parish with Catholic works. In the 19th century, Sasów developed into and was known as a hydrotherapy health spa resort for the wealthy, which saw during the summer season some 300-400 people staying. On the islands of the nearby Western Bug River were built hospitals, houses for patients who walked the green seating areas, admiring the scenery, and on the large reservoir was a palace. This water park was built by Count Starzeński. Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria during his journey to Galicia stayed in Sasów and while staying there became the godfather to Count Starzeński's son. Nobility came from the cities for parties and concerts that took place in the palace hall. The town resort declined as a result of World War I, and the park was destroyed by tanks. From 1921, shortly after the end of World War I, the town was once again part of Poland within the Tarnopol Voivodeship. During the occupation of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, the town was deprived of civic rights and incorporated into the new rural community of Sasów in the District of Galicia.Amtliches Gemeinde- und Dorfverzeichnis für das Generalgouvernement, auf Grund der Summarischen Bevölkerungsbestandsaufnahme am 1. März 1943 (English: Official township and village directory for the General Government, on the basis of the summary population inventory on 1 March 1943) (in German) After World War II the municipality was disconnected from Poland and incorporated into the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. =Jewish community= In 1726 James Louis Sobieski, son of King Jan III Sobieski, gifted the town's Jewish inhabitants various legal rights, resulting in all communal facilities of the Jewish community being exempted from taxes. The town's Jewish inhabitants would be permitted to produce and deal in alcoholic beverages, and their level of excise duties would be no higher than those of other town inhabitants. In 1764 there were 223 Jews living in Sasów, by 1880 1,906. In 1912 there were 1,761 Jews, representing 52.1% of the town's total population. 1921 there were 1,096 (35.4%) Jews living in the town. The town's Jewish population produced candles and ornamental strips (atarot) for prayer-shawls, for which Sasów was a world leading center. Before 1939 there were about 1,500 Jewish people in the town of Sasów. The most famous Jew of the town was the author and founder of the Sasov Hasidic Judaism dynasty, Rabbi Moshe Leib Erblich (Hebrew משה לייב מסאסוב) of Sasów.Sasov Jewish Virtual Library On 17 September 1939, the Red Army entered the town, which was under Soviet administration until the German-Soviet war. Nazi Germans occupied the town on 2 July 1941; during the first couple of weeks they killed 22 Jewish community leaders on the claim these were communists. Three Aktionen took place, the largest on 15 July 1942, when the Jews were deported to Belzec extermination camp. The remaining 400 Jews were deported on 25 November 1942 to the forced-labor camp Zolochiv, which had been set up in March 1942. When this camp was liquidated in July 1943, all its inmates were shot not far from the camp in the forest. After the end of the war, the Jewish community of Sasów could not be reconstituted.

Marking her as the first woman to direct on a STAR WARS film in the franchise's forty year history. Mahoney is currently in talks to direct the feature film of Starks beloved Graphic Novel, Kill Them All for Paramount Pictures. Mahoney made her directing debut in 2011 with the semi- autobiographical film Yelling to the Sky. When Mahoney was 21, she developed “Yelling to the Sky” which is an American drama feature film that was released in 2011. The film follows a young girl’s struggle in high school and her difficult home life. The film, starred Zoe Kravitz as a troubled teen and Jason Clarke as her father, debuted in competition at the 61st Berlin International Film Festival.

Victoria entered the film into multiple film festivals across the world before releasing theatrically in late 2012. In an interview with the Tribeca Film Institute, Mahoney reveals what she wants people to take away from her films saying, “The level of ‘take away’ exists on such a case by case basis. It all depends on what an audience member is experiencing and investigating in their own life. My overriding intentions as a filmmaker, is to tap into individual inquiries and reflect-whatever is hidden. Inspiring an audience’s need for further inquiry into whatever stories, wishes, wants, hungers, desires, questions or aches-presently propel them. From my filmmaking, I’d love audiences to receive some measure of inspiration; to investigate the human condition.” In 2013, she was nominated for the inaugural Tribeca Film Institute's Heineken Affinity Award's $20,000 prize, but lost to her friend and colleague Ava DuVernay.http://affinity.strutta.com/entry/1205773 In the same year, she directed a short film starring Selena Gomez and Shiloh Fernandez for Flaunt.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzZOInRU4ng = Acting career = Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s Mahoney worked as an actress appearing in Seinfeld and the movie Legally Blonde.

He studies the effects of extreme environments, including cold, heat, hypoxia, and hypobaria on the human body. His laboratory motto is vitas salvantas (saving lives). He was dubbed \\"Professor Popsicle\\" in a feature article in Outside Magazine. Dr. Giesbrecht ran unsuccessfully as the Conservative Party of Canada's candidate for Winnipeg South in the 2015 Canadian federal election. Academic career Giesbrecht is a Canadian academic and public educator. Giesbrecht earned a PhD in physiology from the University of Manitoba in 1990 and has been a professor of thermophysiology in the Faculty of Kinesiology and Recreation Management since 1991. He is best known for his work on cold physiology and the co-creation of Cold Water Boot Camp and Beyond Cold Water Boot Camp; two public/professional educational programs. He has also spearheaded a research and education program dedicated to reduce the incidence of vehicle submersion drownings, which account for up to 10% of all drownings. =Cold physiology and survival= Through publications, media appearances and educational programs, Giesbrecht has championed the fact that most cold-water immersion deaths are not caused by hypothermia (which takes more than an hour for most adults), but rather occur earlier due to either the cold shock response (gasping and hyperventilation), or cold incapacitation (due to cooling of muscle and nerve fibres). In order to clarify and publicize the four phases of cold water immersion # Cold shock response # Cold incapacitation # Hypothermia # Circum-rescue collapse Giesbrecht coined the 1-10-1 Principle which was introduced on February 19, 2004 on Late Night With David Letterman. \\"If you fall in ice water, do not panic and remember you have 1 MINUTE to get control of your breathing, 10 MINUTES of meaningful movement, and 1 HOUR before you become unconscious due to hypothermia.\\" =Vehicle submersion= After testifying as an expert witness in an inquest regarding the death of the driver of a snowplow which broke through the ice on a winter road, Giesbrecht realized that up to 10% of all drownings occurred in vehicles and that there was virtually no organized research into vehicle submersion, especially with people in the test vehicles. Operation ALIVE (Automobile submersion: Lessons In Vehicle Escape) has resulted in a series of scientific publications and the following public advice for occupants of a sinking car: \\"Don't panic, do not touch your cell phone and remember 4 words, 'SEATBELTS off; WINDOWS open; CHILDREN released from their constraints; and OUT'\\". This work has also resulted in rewriting of the \\"Sinking Vehicle Protocol\\", and creation of a new \\"Vehicle Stranded in Floodwater Protocol\\" used by the National Academies of Emergency Dispatch for 9-1-1 emergency dispatch operators throughout the world. =Media communications= Giesbrecht has appeared in a number of interviews and documentaries relating to his work in environmental medicine, including Discovery Channel Canada, twice on the Rick Mercer Report, the National Geographic Channel, Canadian and US network news, and The Nature of Things'.' =Publications= Giesbrecht is the author/coauthor of over 90 publications in the scientific literature, has coauthored one book, Hypothermia, Frostbite and Other Cold Injuries, and written a dozen book chapters. =Awards and honours= * 2015 Elected as a Fellow of the Aerospace Medical Association * 2012 Blair Erb World Congress Award for worldwide impact on wilderness medicine, from the Wilderness Medical Society. * 2012 The Ellingson Award for Scientific Writing Achievement within the Associate Fellows Group of the Aerospace Medical Association. * 2011 Education and Training Award of the National Search and Rescue Program Awards of Excellence (Canada) * 2010 Elected as an Associate Fellow of the Aerospace Medical Association * 2008 Canadian Safe Boating Association, Special Recognition Award * 2005 Elected to the Explorer's Club Political career After incumbent Conservative MP Rod Bruinooge declined to run in the 2015 Canadian federal election, Giesbrecht won the nomination race to replace him as candidate for Winnipeg South. During the campaign Giesbrecht highlighted Canada’s number one ranking in the G7 in both economic growth and job creation. He also described the 24% increase in combined science funding for four federal funding organizations (NSERC, SSHRC, CIHR and NRC) during the Conservative mandate. In September 2015, Giesbrecht faced criticism from his political opponents for a 2009 video in which he described abortion rates as \\"a 9/11 every day for the past 35 years.\\" The video was made when Giesbrecht was president of Horizon College and Seminary, a Saskatoon Christian Bible College. These comments came from a message in which Giesbrecht encouraged future community and church leaders to meet people in their greatest times of need (in this case, women with unwanted pregnancies or who had an abortion) not with condemnation but with Christian love, compassion and support.\\"Meet the candidates for Winnipeg South\\".

Early life Burshtein was born in New York in 1967, and moved to Tel Aviv when she was one year old. She attended the Sam Spiegel Film and Television School in Jerusalem, graduating in 1995. Burshtein became an Orthodox Jew when she was 25 years old. Career Prior to Fill the Void, Burshtein was part of a collective of Orthodox Jewish women film-makers who funded, produced, directed, and wrote films for themselves. According to Burshtein, it took her 15 years to complete her debut film, Fill the Void, with numerous delays over writing, casting, and editing. It took her a year to find actress Hadas Yaron to play the main role of Shira, and another year in post-production because of insecurities over the editing process. Fill the Void starred Chayim Sharir, Hadas Yaron, Hila Feldman, Ido Samuel, Irit Sheleg, Razia Israeli, Renana Raz, Yael Tal, and Yiftach Klein. It is the story of a religious Jewish woman who must make a decision about whether or not to marry her late sister's husband. Fill the Void premiered at the 69th Venice International Film Festival. Lead actress Hadas Yaron won the Volpi Cup for her work. Burshtein won three Ophir Awards for directing, writing, and producing for her work on the film. The film was picked up for North American distribution by Sony Pictures Classics. It was released in 2013, to great critical acclaim, receiving a score of 81 on Metacritic. In 2013, Burshtein was invited to direct a short film in celebration of the 70th anniversary of the Venice International Film Festival.

It is located with a distance of 332 km south of Victoria, Seychelles. History Boudeuse Cay was named after a ship used in Bougainville's famous voyage round the world, from 1766 to 1769. It was explored and named by the Chevalier du Roslan in 1771. Geography Boudeuse Cay is the farthest southwestern feature on Amirante Bank, and the westernmost island of the chain. It is a one hectare sandstone platform island, 4.6 m high. There is a small sandy beach, but it is difficult to land because of heavy swells even during calm weather. The island has no trees, and no introduced vegetation, possibly making it one of the most pristine cays in the area. Demographics Boudeuse Cay is uninhabited. Administration The island belongs to Outer Islands District.District map Flora & Fauna The island has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports a breeding population of about 4000 pairs of masked boobies. Green and hawksbill sea turtles nest there. In 2013, a small colony of brown boobies was discovered during a visit by scientists from Island Conservation Society. Once a widespread breeding species in Seychelles, the brown booby was wiped out except for a small number surviving at Cosmoledo. This is the first recorded recolonization of a Seychelles island by this species.

It is a site of pilgrimage in the Hajj, which every Muslim must do at least once in their lives if able, and is also the main phase for the ʿUmrah, the lesser pilgrimage that can be undertaken any time of the year. The rites of both pilgrimages include circumambulating the Kaaba within the mosque. The Great Mosque includes other important significant sites, including the Black Stone, the Zamzam Well, Maqam Ibrahim, and the hills of Safa and Marwa. the Great Mosque is the largest mosque and the eighth largest building in the world. The Great Mosque has undergone major renovations and expansions through the years. It has passed through the control of various caliphs, sultans and kings, and is now under the control of the King of Saudi Arabia who is titled the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. History The Great Mosque contends with the Mosque of the Companions in the Eritrean city of Massawa and Quba Mosque in Medina as the oldest mosque. According to one set of views, Islam as a religion preceded Prophet Muhammad,Esposito (2002b), pp. 4–5. representing previous prophets such as Abraham. Abraham is credited with having built the Kaaba in Mecca, and consequently its sanctuary, which according to this view is seen as the first mosque that ever existed. According to another set of views, Islam started during the lifetime of Prophet Muhammad in the 7th century CE, and so did architectural components such as the mosque. In that case, either the Mosque of the Companions or Quba Mosque would be the first mosque that was built in the history of Islam. =Era of Abraham and Ishmael= According to the Quran, Abraham together with his son Ishmael raised the foundations of a house, which has been identified by commentators as the Kaaba. God showed Abraham the exact site, very near to what is now the Well of Zamzam, where Abraham and Ishmael began work on the construction of the Kaaba. After Abraham had built the Kaaba, an angel brought to him the Black Stone, a celestial stone that, according to tradition, had fallen from Heaven on the nearby hill Abu Qubays. The Black Stone is believed to be the only remnant of the original structure made by Abraham. After placing the Black Stone in the Eastern corner of the Kaaba, Abraham received a revelation, in which God told the aged prophet that he should now go and proclaim the pilgrimage to mankind, so that men may come both from Arabia and from lands far away, on camel and on foot.Quran 22:27 =Era of Muhammad= Upon Muhammad's victorious return to Mecca in 630 CE, he and his cousin, Ali Ibn Abi Talib, broke the idols in and around the Kaaba, similar to what, according to the Quran, Abraham did in his homeland. Thus ended polytheistic use of the Kaaba, and began monotheistic rule over it and its sanctuary.Mecca: From Before Genesis Until Now, M. Lings, pg. 39, ArchetypeConcise Encyclopedia of Islam, C. Glasse, Kaaba, Suhail Academy =Umayyad era= The first major renovation to the mosque took place in 692 on the orders of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan. Before this renovation, which included the mosque's outer walls being raised and decoration added to the ceiling, the mosque was a small open area with the Kaaba at the center. By the end of the 8th century, the mosque's old wooden columns had been replaced with marble columns and the wings of the prayer hall had been extended on both sides along with the addition of a minaret on the orders of Al-Walid I. The spread of Islam in the Middle East and the influx of pilgrims required an almost complete rebuilding of the site which included adding more marble and three more minarets. =Ottoman era= In 1570, Sultan Selim II commissioned the chief architect Mimar Sinan to renovate the mosque. This renovation resulted in the replacement of the flat roof with domes decorated with calligraphy internally, and the placement of new support columns which are acknowledged as the earliest architectural features of the present mosque. These features are the oldest surviving parts of the building. During heavy rains and flash floods in 1621 and 1629, the walls of the Kaaba and the mosque suffered extensive damage. In 1629, during the reign of Sultan Murad IV, the mosque was renovated. In the renovation of the mosque, a new stone arcade was added, three more minarets (bringing the total to seven) were built, and the marble flooring was retiled. This was the unaltered state of the mosque for nearly three centuries. =Saudi era= First Saudi expansion The first major renovation under the Saudi kings was done between 1955 and 1973. In this renovation, four more minarets were added, the ceiling was refurnished, and the floor was replaced with artificial stone and marble. The Mas'a gallery (As-Safa and Al-Marwah) is included in the Mosque, via roofing and enclosures. During this renovation many of the historical features built by the Ottomans, particularly the support columns, were demolished. On 20 November 1979, the Great Mosque was seized by extremist insurgents who called for the overthrow of the Saudi dynasty. They took hostages and in the ensuing siege hundreds were killed. These events came as a shock to the Islamic world, as violence is strictly forbidden within the mosque. Second Saudi expansion The second Saudi renovations under King Fahd, added a new wing and an outdoor prayer area to the mosque. The new wing, which is also for prayers, is reached through the King Fahd Gate. This extension was performed between 1982 and 1988. 1988 to 2005 saw the building of more minarets, the erecting of a King's residence overlooking the mosque and more prayer area in and around the mosque itself. These developments took place simultaneously with those in Arafat, Mina and Muzdalifah. This extension also added 18 more gates, three domes corresponding in position to each gate and the installation of nearly 500 marble columns. Other modern developments added heated floors, air conditioning, escalators and a drainage system. Third Saudi expansion In 2008, the Saudi government under King Abdullah Ibn Abdulaziz announced an expansion of the mosque, involving the expropriation of land to the north and northwest of the mosque covering . At that time, the mosque covered an area of including indoor and outdoor praying spaces. 40 billion riyals (US$10.6 billion) was allocated for the expansion project. In August 2011, the government under King Abdullah announced further details of the expansion. It would cover an area of and accommodate 1.2 million worshippers, including a multi-level extension on the north side of the complex, new stairways and tunnels, a gate named after King Abdullah, and two minarets, bringing the total number of minarets to eleven. The circumambulation areas (Mataf) around the Kaaba would be expanded and all closed spaces receive air conditioning. After completion, it would raise the mosque's capacity from 770,000 to over 2.5 million worshippers. his successor King Salman launched five megaprojects as part of the overall King Abdullah Expansion Project in July 2015, covering an area of . The project was carried out by the Saudi Binladin Group. On 11 September 2015, at least 111 people died and 394 were injured when a crane collapsed onto the mosque. Construction work was suspended after the incident, and remained on hold due to financial issues during the 2010s oil glut. Development was eventually restarted two years later in September 2017. On 5 March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the mosque was closed at night and the Umrah pilgrimage was suspended to limit attendance at the mosque.

Pilgrimage The Great Mosque is the main setting for the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages that occur in the month of Dhu al-Hijjah in the Islamic calendar and at any time of the year, respectively. The Hajj pilgrimage is one of the Pillars of Islam, required of all able-bodied Muslims who can afford the trip. In recent times, over 5 million Muslims perform the Hajj every year.General statistics of the Umrah season of 1436 A.H. until 24:00 hours, 28/09/1436 A.H.

Many ancient buildings, some more than a thousand years old, have been demolished to make room for the expansion. Some examples are: * , the house where Muhammad was born, was demolished and rebuilt as a library. * , the Islamic school where Muhammad first taught, was flattened to lay marble tiles. * The house of Abu Jahal has been demolished and replaced by public washrooms. * A dome that served as a canopy over the Well of Zamzam was demolished. * Some Ottoman porticos at the Mosque were demolished, and those remaining are under threat.

On 16 August 2013, the vessel collided with a cargo ship named MV Sulpicio Express Siete of Philippine Span Asia Carrier Corporation (formerly Sulpicio Lines) causing it to sink. As of 3 September 2013, there were 108 dead and 29 missing with 733 rescued as a result of the accident. Vessel The ferry, named after the Catholic Saint Thomas Aquinas, was a long roll-on/roll-off ferry capable of transporting both passengers and their vehicles. It measured 11,000 tons and was commissioned in 1973. It was operated by 2Go at the time of its sinking. Sinking =Collision= On Friday, 16 August 2013, St. Thomas Aquinas departed from Nasipit, Agusan del Norte, on the southern Philippine island of Mindanao. At approximately 21:00 PHT (13:00 UTC), it was heading into the port at Cebu City via the Cebu Strait when it collided with (IMO 7724344), a cargo ship owned by the Philippine Span Asia Carrier Corporation that was leaving port, approximately from Talisay, Cebu. St. Thomas Aquinas immediately began to take on water, prompting the captain to order the ship abandoned. The crew hurriedly handed out life jackets as hundreds of passengers jumped overboard. Within 30 minutes, the ship sank. At the time of the collision, St. Thomas Aquinas was carrying 715 passengers (58 were infants) and 116 crew members. Many passengers were asleep at the time or otherwise had trouble finding their way to the deck in the dark. A spokesperson for 2Go said there was a high probability that some passengers were in the area of impact and were trapped by the damage. The Sulpicio Express Siete, which did not sink, has 36 crew members on board. Sulpicio Express Siete was severely damaged at the bow in the accident. Local fishermen saw several flares–a sign of distress–being launched from St. Thomas Aquinas and helped with initial rescue efforts. \\"We just picked up the survivors and left the dead in the water,\\" said a rescuer. \\"I heard screams and crying.\\" The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) is conducting the formal rescue efforts. Rescued passengers were taken to local hotels. =Casualties= On Saturday, 17 August 2013, divers began the process of recovering bodies from the sunken ship, but suspended operations later in the day due to safety concerns. 31 people were confirmed dead with 172 others missing as of midday, when rescue operations were suspended due to rough seas. By 18 August, there were 35 confirmed deaths and 85 others missing as a result of the accident. On 19 August, the Coast Guard confirmed 55 dead and 65 missing with 750 rescued. Rescue and recovery efforts have been hampered by bad weather. The death toll is \\"almost certain\\" to rise, according to the Philippine Coast Guard. Many of the survivors were sickened after swallowing seawater and oil believed to have leaked from St. Thomas Aquinas. =Cause= A cause for the accident has not yet been determined, and an official investigation will be launched after rescue efforts are ended. In a statement, 2Go said St. Thomas Aquinas \\"was reportedly hit\\" by Sulpicio Line's cargo vessel, but at the same time refused to directly blame the cargo vessel. 2Go also said the Port of Cebu is unusually narrow and that special traffic control measures were in use to try to avoid accidents at the port. Maritime accidents in the Philippines are common due to a combination of bad weather, poor maintenance, and lax enforcement of safety regulations. The Philippine Span Asia Carrier Corporation (operator of Sulpicio Lines) has been involved in five maritime disasters, most notably the 1987 sinking of the ferry Doña Paz that resulted in an estimated 4,000+ deaths. =Official investigation= A Special Board of Marine Inquiry was opened on 23 August in Cebu City, led by Commodore Gilbert Rueras of the Philippine Coast Guard. The captains of the MV St Thomas Aquinas and the Sulpicio Express Siete testified, as did Captain Galipher Ian Faller, captain of a Trans-Asia Shipping Lines cargo ship in the area, the Trans Asia Nine. Captain Galipher of the Trans Asia Nine testified that the Sulpicio Line Siete was in the inbound lane instead of the outbound lane. Long-term implications Oil and fuel are leaking from the shipwreck. The ferry was carrying of bunker fuel, of diesel fuel, and of lube oil. Owner 2Go is using spill-containment equipment in the area, but local fishing is already being affected. The spilled petroleum is expected to also contaminate local beaches and mangrove swamps, further damaging Cebu's ecosystem and economy.

For fifteen years, from 1991 until 2006, Zehelein was artistic director of the Staatsoper Stuttgart. Critic Gerhard Rohde, summing up Zehelein's theatre work at the Stuttgart opera, says \\"Zehelein does not view opera as a culinary phenomenon. For him opera is an extremely complex matter, where all arts – as well as social, philosophical, historic, utopic and other aspects – unite. This complexity of opera merits being perceived, being seen, being experienced; thus all works that end up performed on stage, are rigorously analyzed beforehand. He who says this results in thinned-out, merely sophisticated opera performances, missed out substantially in the Zehelein-Era in Stuttgart.\\"Gerhard Rohne, Oper und Tanz, April, 2006, - this quote is translated into somewhat simplified English. Education and professional activity Zehelein studied German literature, musicology and philosophy in the Goethe University Frankfurt. Among his teachers were the philosophers Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno. Although not a composer himself, Zehelein participated in the Darmstädter Ferienkurse from 1959 to 1966.

The branch served the Englewood neighborhood of Chicago and consisted of four elevated stations. It opened on May 25, 1907, and closed on January 29, 1954. Operations The Normal Park branch was a elevated line which served four stations. The branch began at the Harvard station, which served a transfer point to the Englewood Branch, and ran southwestward toward the branch's terminal at 69th and Parnell. The branch generally ran only single car trains, although two car trains were occasionally run during weekday rush hours. The branch separated from the Englewood branch at Stewart Junction, west of the Harvard station. Although ridership was low, the stations had enough capacity for 8 car trains, rare around the CTA during that time period. The vast majority of the line's traffic came from the terminal at 69th; the Chicago Normal School was located in this area, along with a small commercial district. Ridership had always been low on this line: There was very little passenger traffic between Harvard and the 69th St. terminal. By the time the branch was closed in January 1954, it was a shuttle only service between Harvard and 69th. Most of the intermediate stations had been gutted before, and 69th St. station was halfway locked down. The line was completely torn down around Summer 1954. When the Dan Ryan branch (serving the Red Line) was built in 1969, a brand new 69th station was built a half-mile away from the former Normal Park station. While the original 69th St. was a low ridership station, the new 69th St. is one of the busiest stations on the CTA system.

However, on December 23, 1993, Republic Act No. 7662, or the Legal Education Reform Act of 1993 through the authorship of Senator Edgardo Angara, was created into law. Despite of the creation of the Board, it only became operational after 16 years. In 2009, through the efforts of Senator Angara, the Board was given its first operational budget of 10 million pesos. In the same year, former Court of Appeals Hilarion Aquino was appointed as its first Chairman. His term was supposedly to end on 2014, but had to occupy his post for two years in a holdover capacity. In 2016, Aquino was replaced by Emerson Aquende, former Law Dean of University of Santo Tomas–Legazpi (formerly known as Aquinas University of Legazpi). On December 29, 2016, the Legal Education Board issued a memorandum order mandating all aspiring law school students to take the Philippine Law School Admission Test (PhilSAT). The first examination took place in April 2017 across seven key cities in the Philippines. =Developments= The following were the major changes to the legal education made by the Board since 2009: * Migration of the basic law degree from Bachelor of Laws to thesis and non-thesis Juris Doctor degrees. * For purposes of classification, ranking and promotion in non-law degrees or courses, Juris Doctor and Bachelor of Laws degrees were classified as equivalent to professional graduate degrees, regardless if the holder has bar eligibility. Previously, a law degree with bar eligibility was only treated as equivalent to a master's degree. Composition The Board is composed of a Chairman, who must preferably a former justice of the Supreme Court or of the Court of Appeals, and four other regular members, each representing the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, Philippine Association of Law Schools, the ranks of active law practitioners and the law students' sector. A representative from the Commission of Higher Education shall also serve as an ex officio member of the Board. With the exception of the representative of the law students' sector, the Chairman and regular members of the Board must be natural-born citizen of the Philippines and members of the Philippine Bar, who have been engaged for at least ten years in the practice of law, as well as in the teaching of law in a duly authorized or recognized law school. PhiLSAT The Philippine Law School Admission Test, or more popularly known by its acronym PhiLSAT, is a one day standardized aptitude test that was designed to evaluate the academic capability of a person to pursue the potential in the study of law in the Philippines. The standardized test was created pursuant to LEB Memorandum Order No. 7, series of 2016. The tests covers four subtests, namely: communications and language proficiency, critical thinking, verbal reasoning, and quantitative reasoning. The test was first implemented in 1970; it was later reintroduced in 2017 and is given twice a year, on April and on September. In 2017, two petitions were filed before the Supreme Court: a petition challenging the constitutionality of the Legal Education Board, and the second was a petition challenging the powers of the Board to administer a standardized national test and creating such test as a requirement for law school admission. Oral arguments were held on March 5 and 12, 2019. On March 18, 2019, the Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining order for the implementation of PhiLSAT. The order further conditionally allowed those who have not taken PhiLSAT for the academic year of 2018-2019, those did not pass the tests in the previous years, those honor graduates with no exemption certificates or with expired exemption certificates to enroll as incoming law students for the upcoming academic year. The said order was effective immediately and shall continue until further orders from the said high court.

Background Morrow & Benjamin Ltd, a stockbroker, opened up an account for the then 15-year-old Whittington to purchase shares during the stock market boom on the mid-1980s. While initially his credit limit was set at $3,000, it was later increased to $12,000. That being said, the now 17-year-old ignored this credit limit and the stockbroker allowed him to purchase shares worth $36,000 on the eve of the 1987 share-market crash, which were a few months later only worth $4,000. The plaintiff then wanted him to pay his credit account of $30,250, however Whittington had no means to pay the debt. Held While the defendant was sufficiently close to being 18 for the court to exercise its discretion to rule that the minor be liable for this debt, due to the fact that the plaintiff ignored its own credit control procedures, that it viewed the defendant at the time as being \\"casual and arrogant\\", and that the purchases were highly speculative in nature, the court held that the account was unreasonable, and so refused to make an order under section 6 of the Minors Contract Act for the debt to be repaid.

Production The series was renewed for a fifth season on October 29, 2013. The season began filming on May 5, 2014 and finished on November 22, 2014. Scott M. Gimple continued the role of showrunner, a position he held since the fourth season. In January 2015, it was announced that Ross Marquand had been cast in a series regular role, to debut during the second half of the season. It was believed Marquand would be playing Aaron, a prominent character from the comic book series. The character debuted in the tenth episode, \\"Them\\", and his role as Aaron was officially confirmed. This season also introduces prominent characters from the graphic novels, besides Aaron, including Bruce, Eric, Nicholas, Olivia, and Tobin. The season finale aired in an expanded 90-minute time slot. The titles of the final five episodes of the season (\\"Remember\\", \\"Forget\\", \\"Spend\\", \\"Try\\", and \\"Conquer\\"), which feature the characters in the Alexandria Safe-Zone, refer to William Faulkner's novel The Sound and the Fury, which Dale quotes from the first season episode \\"Vatos\\". =Writing= Scott M. Gimple remarked that the television series would be following its source material more than ever in the fifth season, with exceptions including original characters such as Daryl Dixon, and deceased characters from the comics alive in the television series and vice versa. The fifth season adapted material from the comic books \\"Volume 10: What We Become\\", \\"Volume 11: Fear the Hunters\\", \\"Volume 12: Life Among Them\\", and \\"Volume 13: Too Far Gone\\". While the television series has remained faithful, the character of Beth Greene and her story arc have been largely made up for the television series. Despite this, the scenario in which Rick Grimes chases down a man who betrayed the group's trust was a moment from the source material, albeit with a different character. Episodes Reception =Critical response= The fifth season of The Walking Dead has received critical acclaim. On Metacritic, the season holds a score of 80 out of 100, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\", based on 11 critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the season holds an 90% with an average rating of 7.86 out of 10 based on 32 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"Thanks to a liberal dose of propulsive, bloody action and enough compelling character moments to reward longtime fans, The Walking Deads fifth season continues to deliver top-notch entertainment.\\" Brian Lowry of Variety gave the fifth-season premiere a positive review, saying: \\"After the (rather too) long and winding road to Terminus, 'The Walking Dead' opens its fifth season in spectacular fashion, a dazzling adrenaline rush filled with suspense, righteous violence and, before it's all over, genuine emotion. Imbued with cinematic touches, the only downside to this breathtaking episode is pondering what the creative brain trust can do for an encore. Still, AMC's megahit finds itself in a very good place, from the current makeup of its ever-evolving cast to the latitude it has earned to take unexpected detours. Given the hype surrounding the series, it's still impressive to see the producers deliver such a feast.\\" Several critics have felt the fifth season has been a huge improvement to its preceding seasons. Emily VanDerWerff for Vox, wrote: \\"...it's not unprecedented for a series to have its best season in its fifth year, but it's definitely strange for a show to make this big of a leap this late in its run.\\" She praised all aspects of the storytelling and conception of the fifth season, singling out the action, themes, characters, advanced storylines, newly introduced anthology character- focused episodes, and overall improvements to the material the show has always worked with. Similarly, writing for Grantland, Andy Greenwald praised Scott M. Gimple as showrunner, particularly noting him as an improvement to Glen Mazzara and Frank Darabont, as well as praising the increase in minorities and resulting racial diversity among the main cast. He further commented: \\"Gimple has also done wonders with the characters he inherited,\\" and singled out characters such as Beth Greene and Tyreese, praising their newly established complexities and character evolution. The constantly shifting environments and surrounding threats were also noted and lauded. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club in his review of \\"Consumed,\\" summarized the season as a whole, saying: \\"This is a large part of why The Walking Dead has gotten so good this season: The writers have found a way to exploit subtext and history in compelling, haunting ways.\\" Laura Prudom of Variety on her review of \\"Conquer\\" commented that \\"...season five represents a marked improvement over the stagnation of previous years, with the promise of Alexandria breathing new life into the series, offering our group a form of opposition that isn't inherently wrong, unlike The Governor or the Termites.\\" She assessed it as having \\"arguably been \\"The Walking Dead's\\" best yet, propelled by compulsive story threads and fascinating character dynamics.\\" =Accolades= For the 41st Saturn Awards, the fifth season of The Walking Dead received seven nominations and three wins. The wins were for Best Syndicated/Cable Television Series, Best Actor on Television (Andrew Lincoln), and Best Supporting Actress on Television (Melissa McBride). The nominations were for Best Supporting Actor on Television (Norman Reedus), Best Supporting Actress on Television (Emily Kinney), Best Performance by a Younger Actor in a Television Series (Chandler Riggs), and Best Guest Starring Role on Television (Andrew J.

It is native to North America, where it is distributed in southern Canada and the central and eastern United States.Polygala senega. NatureServe. 2012. Its common names include Seneca snakeroot, senega snakeroot, senegaroot, rattlesnake root, and mountain flax.Small, E. and P. M. Catling. Polygala senega L. (Seneca Snakeroot). Canadian Medicinal Crops. Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. 2012. Its species name honors the Seneca people, a Native American group who used the plant to treat snakebite. Description This species is a perennial herb with multiple stems up to 50 centimeters tall. The stems are usually unbranched, but some old plants can have branching stems. A mature plant can have up to 70 stems growing from a hard, woody rootstock that spreads horizontally. The lance-shaped leaves are alternately arranged. The lower leaves are reduced and scale-like. The inflorescence is a spike of rounded white or greenish flowers. The fruit is a capsule containing two hairy black seeds. The root is twisted and conical, with a scent somewhat like wintergreen and a very pungent taste. There are two root Polymorphisms; a northern morph growing in Canada and toward Minnesota has larger roots up to 15 centimeters long by 1.2 wide which are dark brown and sometimes purplish toward the top, and a southern morph found in the southeastern United States that has smaller, yellow-brown roots. The plant grows on prairies and in woods and wet shoreline and riverbank habitat. It grows in thin, rocky, usually calcareous soils. It also occurs in disturbed habitat, such as roadsides. Medicinal use This plant had many uses among Native Americans. The Cherokee used it as an expectorant and a diuretic, and for inflammation, croup, and common cold. The Chippewa used preparations of the root to treat convulsions and bleeding wounds. The Cree chewed the root for sore throat and toothache.Polygala senega. Native American Ethnobotany. University of Michigan, Dearborn. According to Canadian botanist Frère Marie- Victorin, the Seneca may have been inspired to use the root to treat snakebite by its resemblance to the tail of a rattlesnake. The root was exported to Europe in the 1700s and was sold widely by pharmacists into the 1800s. It was marketed as a treatment for pneumonia. It is still in use as an herbal remedy. It is ground and made into patent medicines, mainly remedies for respiratory complaints. It is added to cough syrups, teas, lozenges, and gargles.Senega Snakeroot. Manitoba Agriculture, Food and Rural Initiatives. Province of Manitoba. It is toxic in large amounts, and overdose causes such symptoms as diarrhea and \\"violent vomiting\\". The powdered root can be sternutatory (sneeze-inducing).Radix Senegae. WHO Monographs on Selected Medicinal Plants - Volume 2. World Health Organization. 2004. The root product is called Senegae Radix, Radix Senegae, or simply senega. Active compounds include saponins such as senegin, as well as phenolic acids, sorbitol derivatives, methyl salicylate (oil of wintergreen), and sterols. The expectorant property comes from the irritation of mucous membranes by the saponins, which causes an increase in respiratory secretions and a decrease in their viscosity, giving a productive cough. Commercial trade The root has economic value, so it is cultivated on a small scale, particularly in Japan, India, and Brazil. Until the 1960s, Canada was the largest exporter of the product, but there the root was collected from the wild. Most came from Saskatchewan and Manitoba. It is still wild-harvested today, and three quarters of the world's supply is taken from the wilds of the Interlake Region of Manitoba. Native peoples provide most of the labor, digging roots and selling them to drug companies. There is interest in turning the plant into a workable agricultural crop, especially in Canada. Overexploitation of the native plant is a concern, and there has been evidence of overharvest in some areas. At its peak in the year 1931, Canada exported about 781,000 pounds of dry senega root, which equals 2 million pounds of fresh plant. More yet was supplied to the domestic market. Today about 100,000 pounds of fresh plant are harvested annually from the wild in Canada. Herbal remedies are becoming popular again, and demand for senega grows an estimated 5% per year. The biggest importers of the Canadian product, as of the mid-90s, were Europe, Japan, and the United States. The Cree and Métis people are the main collectors of the wild plant. They reportedly earned US$3.50 per pound of dry root in 1993, and up to US$7.00 per pound in 1998. A government report noted the price was US$6.50-8.00 in 1995. The dry root brought C$28,000 per ton in 1997. In 1999, one company was selling bulk powdered senega for US$18 per pound. In cultivation the plant can be propagated by seeds or cuttings. The seeds require two months of cold stratification before use. A plant takes 4 years to produce a root large enough to harvest. The roots are dug up, washed, and dried, and about 160 roots yield one kilogram of senega. Conservation The plant is distributed widely in Canada and is not considered endangered. In some more pristine and isolated regions the species can be common. In general, it is experiencing a short-term decline of about 10 to 30%. Besides overexploitation, the plant has experienced loss of habitat to overgrazing and the conversion of land to urban and agricultural use. References External links *Polygala senega.

As with all other full-size Can-Am cars of the time, it used a mid-mounted 5-litre, naturally-aspirated Chevrolet V8 engine. Two cars are known to have been built. Paul Newman Racing won the Team's championship of the Can-Am series in 1981 with the March 817, whilst their main driver, Teo Fabi took second in the driver's standings. Racing history Both March 817s were bought by Paul Newman Racing, with Al Unser and Teo Fabi initially being selected to drive them. The car made its first appearance in the first round of the 1981 Can-Am season, held at Mosport Park; Unser retired due to brake failure after 12 laps, but Fabi won the race. Unser wasn't present at Mid Ohio, but Fabi won again in a close race. Unser returned at Watkins Glen, but the weekend proved to be unsuccessful; damage to the rear end of his car forced Unser out after 16 laps, and Fabi retired with a blown engine five laps later. Road America saw Unser finish third, for his first podium of the season; however, Fabi crashed in practice and was unable to compete in the race. Edmonton was another unsuccessful event; Unser blew his engine after 25 laps, and Fabi span out after 48 laps. Unser left the team before the Trois-Rivières, and Fabi brought his March 817 home in fourth place. The series then returned to Mosport Park, and Bobby Rahal joined the team; the pair took a one-two finish, with Fabi finishing just five-hundredths of a second ahead of Rahal. Riverside saw Paul Newman Racing suffer another pair of retirements; Rahal suffered suspension failure after 19 laps, and Fabi's car lost a wheel two laps later. The penultimate round of the Can-Am season was held at Laguna Seca Raceway, where Fabi won the race, and Rahal finished in ninth place. Caesars Palace held the final round of the season, where Fabi finished second, and Rahal finished fourth. Despite taking two more wins than Geoff Brabham, Fabi was only able to finish second to him in the driver's standings; whilst Rahal finished eighth, and Unser in 13th. Paul Newman Racing did, however, manage to win the Team's championship. The car was not used again, and was replaced by the March 827 for 1982.

He is the son of jazz trombonist, Viggo Hansen and is considered one of the most prominent Norwegian drummers in the bebop genre.  Career  Hansen debuted at the age of 14 with the legendary north-Norwegian guitarist Thorgeir Stubø, and participated in his quartet (1981–82). In the early 1980s he also played within \\"Samasjyen\\" in Harstad, and was, in other words a very young contributor to Narviks vital jazz scene at this time. He appeared in Erling Wicklund's show Ung norsk jazz at NRK in the early 1990s, and played with regional musician group \\"Jazz i Nord\\" together with the pianist Jørn Øien, bassist Konrad Kaspersen and trombonist Øystein B. Blix. This ensemble is documented on the album Song, Fall Soft (1995) with vocalist Marit Sandvik. Hansen joined the Kjell Bartholdsen Quintet at \\"Festspillene i Harstad\\" 1984, collaborated within Øystein Norvoll Quintet at Kongsberg Jazzfestival in 1988, and was part of the Ernst-Wiggo Sandbakk Group in 1989–90. The combination Kaspersen/Hansen is a strong jazz accompaniment, and has laid the foundation for many constellations, among them Hallgeir Pedersen Trio (from 1999) which he is a permanent member of. His contribution here can be heard on the plates West Coast Blues (2002) Wistful (2004) and Bluero (2006).

It is believed to be the site of a Byzantine-era fort and part of a Roman line of defense against desert raiders. More recent research has suggested it was constructed for economic rather than military reasons.  History The fortlet of Upper Zohar is situated on a flat shelf of a steeply sloping ridge on the northern side of a hill known as Rosh Zohar (Zohar Head), southeast of Arad. Unreferenced by ancient sources, its ancient name is unknown. It appears as Khirbet Gazza in Albrecht Alt's writings and is also correctly marked in the British Mandate for Palestine maps, both from the 1930s. It appears again in Mordechai Gichon's writings about the Limes Palaestinae, but was only excavated between 1985 and 1986 by a team from the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem led by Richard P. Harper. The final excavation report was published in 1997. The site of Upper Zohar occupies roughly 26 meters squared, a square fortlet with protruding towers at each corner. It is not a perfect square, but rather than carelessness, this is caused by the desire to make use of the characteristics of the site itself. The fortlet was constructed using dense chert quarried nearby, though limestone was used for doorways and some exterior corners of the towers. The curtain walls varied between 1 and 1.5 meters in width, and were built with coursed faces both on the inside and outside. Laid in a shallow foundation, they were set using wet earth and filled with small rubble. Each corner tower was approximately 4 * 4.5 meters, and contained both a lower and upper level. Their walls were preserved up to a height of 3 meters. Access to the top of the walls was provided by a pair of staircases on the northern and southern walls. In the middle of the courtyard, which is roughly 17 meters squared, stood a cistern sunk into the bedrock. The cistern was circular, 3.75 meters in diameter and 5 meters deep. On the eastern side of the courtyard stood three rooms, although the northern and southern rooms were demolished at some point, leaving a sole room that may have served as a chapel. The fortlet's gateway, roughly 2 meters wide, stood in the middle of the western wall. At some point a wall was built from the tower at the north-western corner of the fort, past the gateway and parallel to the wall. This perhaps served as shelter for animals. Only a small amount of identifiable coins were recovered at the site. Save for a single coin dated to the reign of Diocletian, pierced and therefore worn as a good luck charm, the numismatic evidence suggests the site was occupied from the first half of the fifth century. The largest number of coins date to the 6th century, particularly to the early reign of Byzantine emperor Justinian I. No coins date later than 550 CE. Over 43,000 sherds were unearthed at Upper Zohar, 55% of which were local cooking ware and another 42% other coarse wares, though 3% were fine imported ware, including African, Phocaean and Cypriot Red Slip. The datable pottery was dominated by sixth century types, several known to continue into the 7th century. No example dating from earlier than the late 5th century was found, including those found within the fortlet's foundation trenches. Harper notes that 'no specifically military finds were uncovered at the site', though the final excavation report does list one spearhead end and 2 slingstones. Faunal finds include over 23,000 mammalian bones, 2,000 bird bones and a similar number of fish. 86% of mammal bones belonged to caprids and a further 12% were pig, while bird bones are dominated by the domestic chicken. Fish species found at the fortlet include both fresh and salt water fish, from both the Mediterranean and the Red Sea.  Dating and possible use  Upper Zohar stands along an ancient road leading from Arabia and the Arava toward the Palestinian heartland and the Mediterranean ports. Beginning at Ein Bokek on the Dead Sea, where another fortlet stands, the route passes by another fortlet at Hatrurim before approaching Upper Zohar. Here the road merges with another track coming from the Dead Sea through the fort at Mezad Zohar, which lies to the southeast, before heading west to the northern Negev. Like these and other similar forts, it stands at a point where anyone using the road is obliged by the topography to pass close by. Harper had chosen to excavate Upper Zohar because of its potential to contribute to the debate about the nature and date of the Roman limes in Palestine. Mordechai Gichon had written extensively about the disposition of the Roman army in Palestine, proposing the existence of defensive belt of fortifications in the northern Negev, known as the Limes Palaestinae, against marauding Saracens. Based on even earlier Judean fortifications, this line of defense was supposedly established by the Flavian emperors and refurbished and expanded by Diocletian. Gichon, therefore, regarded Upper Zohar as a Flavian establishment, part of their line of defense protecting the settled heartland from desert-based raiders. Based on the numismatic and ceramic finds, Harper dated the construction of Upper Zohar only to the late 5th century. The initial occupation had apparently been cleaned out some time in the early 6th century, eventually falling into disuse by the early 7th century, when it was finally abandoned. The absence of a destruction layer and the discovery of the skeleton of a child under the rubble of one of the towers a suggests the cause may have been an earthquake. Archaeologist Thomas S. Parker has suggested that the cessation of military activity at the site in the 6th century may have resulted from the demobilization of the Limitanei, attributed to emperor Justinian by Procopius. The fortlet may have been initially garrisoned by a detachment from one of the units listed in the Notitia Dignitatum, which policed the road. There were, after all, no real Police forces at the time, the activities of which were carried out by the military. Later, these were replaced by some local arrangement, eventually leading to its neglect and eventual abandonment. Jodi Magness and Benjamin Isaac disagree with Parker, noting that Justinian's reign may have, in fact, witnessed a surge in military building activity in the region. According to Isaac, however, nothing justifies describing Upper Zohar as any part of a system of defense. Although a structure of this type is assumed to have had a military role, this is not necessarily the case, as is evident by the paucity of military finds. Isaac's criticism of Gichon's theories regarding the Roman deployment in southern Palestine is shared by other scholars as well. Magness marks the homogeneity of the ceramic finds at Upper Zohar, the vast majority of which post-date the mid 6th century, as indicative that Upper Zohar was only occupied in the middle of that century. It could not have been part of any system of defence, often attributed to Diocletian's military and administrative reforms. Like other forts in the region, Upper Zohar is too small to support any sizeable garrison. These were apparently not intended to provide defense against a strong opponent. Rather, they were police posts and lookouts protecting travelers, pilgrims and trade along the road. These forts are evidence for a concentrated effort on the part of the government to police the local road system. Upper Zohar and other such forts may have been constructed on a local rather than imperial initiative, with the purpose of safeguarding the road. They were likely constructed for economic rather than military reasons.

To the right of the gate the house is already standing, but it has only one floor The smallest house in Amsterdam is located at Oude Hoogstraat 22 in the old city center of Amsterdam, next to the Oost-Indisch Huis and the gate to the Walloon Church. The house, by some called the \\"Smallest house of Europe\\", is wide and deep. With its distinctive spout gable, this house represents a miniature version of a typical Amsterdam canal house. The smallest house in Amsterdam is registered as a national heritage site (rijksmonument). History The smallest house in Amsterdam is located on the edge of the former site of the Sint- Paulusbroederklooster monastery. In 1550, a portion of this property was sold to the City of Amsterdam who built the Bushuis here. Later, in 1603, the Amsterdam chamber of the Dutch East India Company took possession of a part of the Bushuis and used it as a warehouse. In 1604, adjacent to the Bushuis, construction began of the East India House, which was completed in 1606. Right next to the house is one of the most famous gates of Amsterdam: the Gateway to the Walloon Church. This gate, built in 1616, is the work of architect Hendrik de Keyser (1565-1621) and served as a passageway for funeral services. The Oude Hoogstraat has always been a shopping street. On the current location of number 20 and 22 there was a property called 'King David'. This building was demolished in 1733 to make way for a new building site: the current building at number 20. The city purchased the remaining piece of land of about . On this land the smallest house in Amsterdam was built: the current number 22. In 1738 the small house was first mentioned in the city Archives. For the first time, 'The City' paid taxes for the location where the house stands. In 1742, watchmaker Jan Tenking rented the house for 150 guilders per year. Although nowadays the small house has two upper floors and an attic, in the early years the house only consisted of a ground floor. Between 1768 and 1787, the current levels and attic were built.

He was one of the leading European two-year- old of 1986, when he was unbeaten in three races including the Dewhurst Stakes. In the early part of 1987 he was aimed at the classics but after winning the Craven Stakes on his debut, he was beaten in the 2000 Guineas, Irish 2,000 Guineas and Epsom Derby. He was then switched to shorter distances and emerged as the best European sprinter of the year, winning the July Cup, William Hill Sprint Championship and Vernons Sprint Cup. He was then retired to stud but died after siring only one crop of foals. Background Ajdal was a bay colt with three white socks bred in Maryland by Ralph C. Wilson Jr. He was from the nineteenth crop of foals sired by Northern Dancer, the winner of the 1964 Kentucky Derby and one of the most influential sires of the 20th century. Ajdal's dam Native Partner was a half sister of Jim French and a top- class racemare whose wins included the Maskette Handicap in 1970. Apart from Ajdal she produced several other winners including (Formidable), Flying Partner (Fantasy Stakes) and Fabuleux Jane (Prix de Pomone). The yearling was consigned by Wilson's Oxford Stable to the Keeneland Sales in July 1985 and attracted strong interest. The bidding reached $7.5 million before Sheikh Mohammed dropped out when he realised that he was bidding against the colt's breeder. The price set a record for a breeder \\"buying back\\" his own horse which stood until 2008 when Michael Paulson went to $7.7 million to retain Vallenzeri, the horse later known as Take Control. The Sheikh later purchased the yearling privately for an undisclosed sum and gave him the name Ajdal, an Arabic word meaning \\"handsome\\". Ajdal was sent into training with Michael Stoute at Newmarket, Suffolk and was ridden in most of his races by Walter Swinburn. Racing career =1986: two-year-old season= Ajdal began his racing career by winning a race over six furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse in September. Later that month he was moved up in class and distance for the Mornington Stakes over seven furlongs at Ascot Racecourse and won impressively. In October the colt was again stepped up in class to contest Britain's most prestigious race for two-year-olds, the Group One Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket. Despite never having run in a Group race, Ajdal was made the 4/9 favourite against four opponents which included the Middle Park Stakes winner Mister Majestic (20/1). Swinburn positioned the colt just behind the leaders before taking the lead a furlong from the finish. Ajdal quickly accelerated clear of the field and seemed poised to win easily, but in the final strides he began to slow down and won by only three-quarters of a length from Shady Heights. Some observers felt that Ajdal was tiring in the closing stages, while others, including Timeform, felt that the colt was merely showing sign of inexperience. He looked likely to be named the year's leading two-year-old but his performance was surpassed eight days later when Reference Point won the William Hill Futurity. =1987: three-year-old season= Ajdal began his three-year-old season as favourite for the 2000 Guineas and made his first appearance in the Craven Stakes over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket on 16 April. He started the 6/5 favourite and won by three-quarters of a length from the Richard Hannon Sr.-trained Don't Forget Me with Most Welcome in third place. Sixteen days later, over the same course and distance, Ajdal started 6/5 favourite against thirteen opponents in the 181st running of the 2000 Guineas. Swinburn settled Ajdal just behind the front-running Don't Forget Me, before attempting to challenge for the lead in the last quarter mile. He was unable to overtake the leader, and after being bumped by the subsequently disqualified Most Welcome in the closing stages, he finished fifth behind Don't Forget Me, beaten two lengths. Ajdal reopposed Don't Forget Me in the Irish 2,000 Guineas at the Curragh on 16 May, with the two colts starting joint-favourites on 6/4. Ajdal finished third to his rival, but was disqualified after Swinburn failed to weigh in after the race. On 3 June, Ajdal was moved up in distance to contest the 208th Epsom Derby over one and a half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse. He was considered unlikely to stay the distance and started at odds of 25/1, with Swinburn opting to ride his stable companion Ascot Knight. Ridden by Ray Cochrane, Ajdal was reluctant to enter the stalls but ran prominently for much of the race before fading in the final quarter mile to finish ninth behind Reference Point. After running over one and a half mile, Ajdal was brought back to six furlongs for the Group One July Cup at Newmarket on 9 July. This required a change in the horse's training regime: after spending most of the year teaching the horse to relax and settle in a race, he now required \\"sharpening\\" to compete against specialist sprinters. He started the third favourite behind the Vincent O'Brien-trained Bluebird, who had been an impressive winner of the King's Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot. Ajdal was among the leaders from the start before taking the lead approaching the final furlong and won by a head from the filly Gayane, with Bluebird in third. Stoute later admitted that it had taken him a long time to find Ajdal's best distance and described the early part of the colt's three- year-old campaign as \\"one of the biggest cock-ups\\". In August, Ajdal raced over five furlongs for the first time when he contested the Group One William Hill Sprint Championship at York Racecourse and started 2/1 second favourite behind Bluebird. Swinburn sent the colt into the lead from the start and set a strong pace before pulling away in the last quarter mile to win by three lengths from Sizzling Melody in a time of 58.48 with Bluebird in fourth. In September at Haydock Park Racecourse, Ajdal started 8/11 favourite for the Vernons Sprint Cup, which was the most valuable sprint race in the United Kingdom despite only carrying Group Two status. Ajdal took the lead two furlongs from the finish and won decisively by two lengths from the five-year- old Sharp Romance. Ajdal's final race was the Prix de l'Abbaye over 1000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse in October. He started the 3/10 favourite but was poorly drawn and seemed unsuited by the firm ground, finishing seventh of the nine runners behind the Irish-trained filly Polonia. Assessment In the official International Classification for 1986, Ajdal was the second highest- rated two-year-old of the season in Europe, two pounds below Reference Point. The independent Timeform organisation concurred, rating Ajdal and Reference Point on 130 and 132 respectively. In the 1987 International Classification, Ajdal was rated on 127, making him the highest-rated sprinter and the third highest-rated three-year-old colt behind Reference Point and Trempolino. Timeform again gave him a rating of 130, and named him as the best sprinter of the year. Stoute described Ajdal by saying that \\"as a sprinter he wasn't as good as Marwell, who'd be the best sprinter we had, but he beat the best around and he could have been a little better if we'd have clicked earlier what we were doing with him.\\" Stud record Ajdal was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at his owner's Dalham Hall Stud at a fee of £35,000, but died in August 1988 at the age of four. In the following year thirty-five of the mares he had covered produced live foals. The performances of his offspring on the racecourse were disappointing: his only winner of any consequence was Cézanne, who won the Irish Champion Stakes as five-year-old in 1994. He was more successful as a sire of broodmares, with his daughter Homage producing Mark of Esteem. Another of his daughters Anima, was the grand-dam of the Lockinge Stakes winner Creachadoir and Youmzain, who was runner-up in three consecutive runnings of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Other Group One winners from Ajdal mares were Dilshaan (Racing Post Trophy) and Olden Times (Prix Jean Prat). Pedigree *Ajdal was inbred 3 x 3 to Native Dancer, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the third generation of his pedigree.

It was launched along with the second Cygnus spacecraft and 28 Flock-1 CubeSats aboard an Antares 120 carrier rocket flying from Pad 0B at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on Wallops Island to the International Space Station. The launch was scheduled to occur in December 2013, but later was rescheduled to 9 January 2014 and occurred then. The satellite was broadcasting greetings of Lithuanian president, Mrs. Dalia Grybauskaitė. The satellite was deployed from the International Space Station via the NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer on February 28, 2014. All LituanicaSAT-1 subsystems have been turned on, tested and proved to be working properly. The mission is considered a complete success by its team of engineers. The mission ended upon the reentry and disintegration of the satellite on July 28, 2014. Description The satellite conforms to standard 1U size cubesat form factor as to the latest cubesat design specifications. The satellite does not have any active systems except the antenna deployment mechanism that is engaged 30 minutes after deployment sequence. Both attitude and thermal control sub-systems are implemented passively for simplicity and safety. The total mass of the body including the equipment within it is 1,090 g. Subsystems =Attitude determination and control= LituanicaSAT-1 uses passive magnetic attitude control system consisting of permanent magnets that create a control torque and soft magnets that provide dampening torque using hysteresis effect. Following attitude sensors are implemented for attitude determination: * PS- MPU-6000A MEMS motion sensor * PS-MPU-9150A MEMS motion sensor * L3GD20 MEMS three-axis digital output gyroscope * HMC5883L three-axis digital magnetometer =Command and data management= There are two on board computers in LituanicaSAT-1 due to redundancy requirements: the flight computer based on ARM Cortex-M4F microcontroller and secondary (back-up) computer based on an Atmel ATMega2560 microcontroller. The flight computer is the central control unit of the satellite responsible for maintaining the normal operating mode of the satellite, monitoring and control of energy resources, control of attitude determination sub-system and performance of telecommands received from the satellite ground station in Vilnius University, Lithuania. Secondary flight computer is based on Arduino. It ensures limited but safe functionality of the satellite in case of the main CPU failure and will also take and record the first pictures made from space, as well as control the radio beacon of the satellite. =Payload= The main payload is amateur radio FM mode V/U voice repeater. It operates on 145.950 MHz uplink (PL 67 Hz CTCSS) and 435.180 MHz downlink. The FM repeater subsystem identifies itself with callsign LY5N. The first filter of repeaters receiver is 15 kHz wide, second is 12 kHz. The transmit filter is set to +/- 5 kHz, and bandwidth to 10 kHz, but this width depends highly on the incoming signal width, for example if the uplink signal is 15 kHz wide, it will be cut down with 12 kHz filter. The repeater payload was engineered and developed by Žilvinas Atkočiūnas and Žilvinas Batisa. Due to temperature changes, the downlink frequency may be shifted down by 5 kHz. =Power supply subsystem= The power supply sub-system includes a GomSpace Nanopower P31u power board with a lithium-ion battery and solar cells. =Communications subsystem= Comm subsystem consists of AX.25 transceiver and corresponding antennas. He-100 COTS transceiver is used for establishing and maintaining radio communication with the ground station. The key technical specifications of the radio transceiver are as follows: * Operating frequencies: TX: 437 MHz / RX: 144 MHz * Sensitivity: -104.7 dBm @ BER 10-3 * Transmit power: 100 mW – 2 W * Receive power: < 200 mW * Data transfer rate: 9600 bit/s * Data protocol: AX.25 * Operating temperature: from -30 to +70 °C =Antennas= There are 4 monopole antennas on LS-1: three UHF antennas and one VHF antenna. Each antenna is made of approx. 0.2 mm thick and 5 mm wide spring steel measurement tape. In deployed configuration, all UHF antennas are pointed towards the Z+ body axis direction and VHF antenna is pointed toward –Z body axis. Mission control The satellite is commanded from Vilnius University amateur radio station, LY1BWB. Ground control software is written in Erlang and has a web interface, served by Yaws. The source code of the software is partly available for public use. Communication is done using custom protocol, which is built on top of reduced set of AX.25 and handles full-duplex data transfer, when required. Recent versions of ground control software support direct upload of binary telemetry files, which were collected and sent to ground control by amateur radio operators worldwide. OSCAR status On June 8, 2014, AMSAT-NA OSCAR number administrator Bill Tynan, W3XO, stated that \\"LituanicaSAT-1 has met all of the requirements for an OSCAR number\\" and assigned the designation of LO-78 (LituanicaSAT-OSCAR 78) to the satellite. The team of engineers subsequently announced that it will try to keep the onboard FM repeater operative for the rest of the mission.

The character is voiced by Jason Ritter, and designed by and loosely based on the childhood of series creator Alex Hirsch. First appearing in the unaired unnamed pilot created by Hirsch with which he pitched the show; he later appeared in the first episode \\"Tourist Trapped\\". Dipper, along with his twin sister Mabel Pines, who stars in every episode of the show. Dipper is the star of the Gravity Falls series of shorts titled \\"Dipper's Guide to the Unexplained\\" and also appears in the shorts \\"Fixin' it with Soos\\" and \\"Mabel's Guide to Life\\". Background Dipper is a 12-year-old boy who, along with his twin sister Mabel, is sent to spend his summer vacation in his great uncle's tourist trap, \\"The Mystery Shack\\". He endeavors to uncover the secrets of the fictional town of Gravity Falls and to find explanations for assorted strange situations. He is helped by his energetic and boundlessly cheerful twin Mabel and the Shack's handyman Soos. They often end up dealing with or encountering various supernatural or legendary creatures, like gnomes, cryptids, demons, extraterrestrials, minotaurs, and Vampires. Dipper tackles these mysteries with the aid of a journal—a large, red-bound book with a gold six fingered hand and number \\"3\\" on the front cover—that he found in the forest. This journal describes many of the supernatural occurrences of Gravity Falls. In \\"Scary-oke\\", he discovers another layer of knowledge in the journal only visible under black light. Dipper is uncommonly brave and determined for a pre-teen, and struggles with growing up. He is singularly devoted to solving the mysteries of Gravity Falls that he has discovered, which often puts him at odds with Grunkle Stan. The adventures of Dipper and his sister are inspired by the childhood of series creator Alex Hirsch and his own twin sister, Ariel Hirsch. As a character, Dipper has been critically well received. He appears in various Gravity Falls merchandise, such as on clothing and in video games. Role in Gravity Falls Jason Ritter voiced Dipper in the series Dipper Pines is a curious, clever and inventive boy from Piedmont, California, forced to spending his summer together with his great uncle Stan in the fictional town of Gravity Falls, Oregon. He is accompanied by his twin sister Mabel Pines. He is portrayed as smart, wise, gentle, conventional, and very logical, showing knowledge in various areas like history, cryptography, puzzle-solving, etc. Although Dipper can find his twin sister Mabel pesky and annoying, he will do anything to protect her from danger. He first arrives in Gravity Falls upset with going to a small, boring town, with his twin sister Mabel for the summer, but because of interest in mysteries and lust for adventure after finding the third of the three journals written by his great uncle Stanford \\"Ford\\" Pines, he starts to adjust to life in town and encourages his sister to join him in unraveling its supernatural secrets. Dipper is shown as a very organized child and often comes up with well-thought-out plans for his friends and family to follow. Throughout the series, Dipper wears a trademark white and blue cap with a symbol of a blue pine tree on the front, which he takes from the Shack's gift shop. He also wears a navy blue vest, reddish orange T-shirt, gray shorts, black sneakers, and a wristwatch. \\"Double Dipper\\" reveals that his nickname comes from a birth mark on his forehead in the form of the Big Dipper, which he hides with his bangs. His given first name, Mason, is seen one time in the series briefly: in \\"Dungeons, Dungeons & More Dungeons\\", it is written messily on the bottom right corner of a piece of graph paper when Mabel comments on Dipper's spending a lot of time with Ford. In the book Gravity Falls: Journal 3, a guide book about the series intended to be a replica of the fictional journal, Dipper tells Ford his name is Mason. Starting with \\"The Inconveniencing\\", Dipper is shown to have a crush on 15-year-old Mystery Shack cashier Wendy Corduroy. However, his attempts to win her over are usually sidetracked by accidents or supernatural phenomena. In the episode \\"Into the Bunker\\", Wendy confirms her suspicions of Dipper's crush, and though she explains that she is too old for Dipper, they remain close friends. Behind the scenes Dipper was based on series' creator Alex Hirsch's younger self. Mason “Dipper” Pines was voiced by the actor Jason Ritter. He first appeared on Gravity Falls in the never released pilot episode that the creator Alex Hirsch pitched to Disney Channel.

He has also written for the flautist James Galway, pianist Barry Douglas, the British violinist Tasmin Little, the Russian pianist Nicolai Demidenko, and singers Ann Murray, Suzanne Murphy and Sarah Walker. Early life and education Hammond was born in Belfast. After studying at Cabin Hill Preparatory School and Campbell College, Belfast, Hammond graduated from Queen's University Belfast in 1974 as a Bachelor of Music and Master of Arts. In 2003 he was awarded a Doctorate of Music from Queen’s. Career as a composer While teaching at Cabin Hill, Hammond regularly performed as a pianist and accompanist with the mezzo-soprano Daphne Arlow and in a piano duo with Michael McGuffin, performing and presenting for BBC Radio Ulster, BBC Radio Three and RTE. His first major commission, Thanatos (1977), was written for the choir of the Royal Victoria Hospital. It became controversial when what was to have been its first live performance was disrupted when some of the original singers objected to the piece on \\"moral grounds\\". Following publicity on the BBC, Radio Three offered to record the first performance. That studio performance, with the Choir of St Anne's Cathedral, was broadcast throughout the UK and subsequently performed live at the Ulster Museum by a different grouping of performers. The work is dedicated to the composer and academic Adrian Thomas. Hammond received a commission from Radio Three, and Narcissus, a setting of poems by George Barker, was performed by Lontano and mezzo- soprano Linda Hirst in April 1981 as part of the Sonorities Festival of Twentieth Century Music. It was later broadcast by BBC Radio Three and received a London premiere by the same performers in 1982. One of Hammonds most frequently performed pieces, French Blue, was commissioned by the GPA Dublin International Piano Competition. It was a test piece for the competition. He later wrote two companion pieces Irish Green for Iain Burnside and African Black for Ruth McGinley who had reached the finals of the BBC Young Musician of the Year Competition in 1993 and who had played French Blue as part of that competition. His Waterfront Fanfares (1997) were written for the opening of the Waterfront Hall, Belfast; and his work for piano and orchestra ... the starry dynamo in the machinery of night ... was commissioned by Queen's University Belfast for a concert marking the award of an honorary degree to President Bill Clinton in 2001. It was subsequently performed on a tour of the United States by Barry Douglas and Camerata Ireland in Belfast's Waterfront Hall. Many of Hammond's pieces have a strong literary association. His orchestral piece Die Ersten Blumen (1996) was a response to a poem by Hermann Hesse. The White Lake (1999) was a choral and orchestral setting of a specially commissioned poem by Michael Longley, and one of his most recent large-scale compositions, Psalms and Songs from the Hebrew (2000) for chorus and orchestra, was a setting of mediaeval Jewish poetry from Spain. His work ... while the sun shines was commissioned by BBC Radio Three for performance in September 2005 and celebrates the music of the great Irish conductor and composer Sir Hamilton Harty (in 1979, Philip Hammond contributed two chapters to a book on Sir Hamilton Harty published by Blackstaff Press). Arts Council Hammond was a Director at the Arts Council of Northern Ireland. While at the Arts Council, Hammond spent two years seconded to the Northern Ireland government to design and manage an international arts festival in Washington DC to accompany Northern Ireland's role as a featured region in the 2007 Smithsonian Folklife Festival.

It is an adaptation of the stage musical of the same name, a jukebox musical featuring songs by The Proclaimers. It was screened in the Special Presentation section at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. The songs, arranged by musical director Paul Englishby, are performed by the cast. The Proclaimers themselves appear in a brief cameo. Plot The film starts in Afghanistan where an APC is on patrol while the passengers including Davy Henshaw (George MacKay) and Ally (Kevin Guthrie) are nervous as to their survival (\\"Sky Takes the Soul\\"), before an ambush happens. Some time later Davy and Ally, recently discharged, return to their homes and families in Edinburgh after their Afghanistan tour (\\"I'm on my Way\\"). Ally returns to his girlfriend Liz (Freya Mavor), a nurse who is Davy's sister. On Davy and Ally's first night home Liz introduces Davy to her English friend and colleague Yvonne (Antonia Thomas) at a pub. Liz and Yvonne take part in some drunken story telling, a Scottish tradition (\\"Over and Done With\\"). Following from their blind date Davy and Yvonne strike up a romantic relationship (\\"Misty Blue\\") as Ally and Liz consider their future as a potential married couple (\\"Make my Heart Fly\\"). Davy's Dad Robert \\"Rab\\" Henshaw (Peter Mullan) receives a letter from, and later meets, Eilidh, a daughter he didn't know he had; the product of an affair early in his marriage (the mother of this affair has just died and Rab secretly attends the funeral). As Ally explains to Davy that he intends to propose to Liz during the 25th wedding anniversary party for Davy's parents Rab and Jean (Jane Horrocks), a bartender, who overheard the conversation offers Ally advice on how to propose (\\"Let's Get Married\\"). At the anniversary party Rab serenades Jean (\\"Oh Jean\\"). During the party, Jean discovers the letter still in Rab's jacket and is outraged at Rab's infidelity. Ally then proposes to Liz, who turns him down. A mass brawl develops and Yvonne is horrified at Davy's aggression. Jean is horrified to hear from Rab that he intends to keep seeing his newly found daughter. Jean stops speaking to him and he is seen sleeping on the sofa. Eventually, Jean feels guilty and blames herself for the deconstruction of her family but her colleagues at the Scottish National Gallery reassure her that none of these events were her fault (\\"Should have been Loved\\"). Meanwhile, Rab is out buying the ingredients for a special meal he intends to cook in the hopes of reconciliation with Jean. As he returns home, he suffers a heart attack on the doorstep and is admitted to hospital. Rab recovers, and Rab and Jean reconcile (\\"Sunshine on Leith\\"). Jean agrees to let Rab see his daughter and has brought her to the hospital to see him. Yvonne and Davy have reconciled (\\"Then I Met You\\"). However, Liz and Ally's relationship has dissolved. Ally re-enlists, while Liz accepts an offer of a job nursing in Florida (\\"Letter from America\\"). After an argument with Davy, Yvonne prepares to leave Edinburgh. However, before she can reach Waverley railway station, Davy catches her and declares his commitment to her in Princes Street Gardens where they reconcile for a second time (\\"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\\"). The scene cuts to Jean & Rab singing verses of the song to each other; Ally on patrol with the army, presumably sings to Liz who is shown at work in America opening a letter from Ally.

Career The Manors of Burlewas (or Burdeleys) and Marhams (or Harlestons) at Madingley, Cambridgeshire, were among the acquisitions of land made by Francis Hynde's father, Sir John Hynde, who was buying land in Madingley from the 1520s onwards. By the time he died in 1550 the manors had become combined, and remained so in the hands of his descendants and successors.

There are various records of Hynde's dealings with Corpus Christi College. Between 1552 and 1561/62 he fell into dispute with the College over lands at Barton, Coton and Whitwell resulting in a suit against Hynde which was resolved in Chancery. For many years he withheld an annual rent of 50 shillings owing out of the Manor of Girton, which was eventually recovered for the College by the Master, Matthew Parker, with the assistance of Sir Nicholas Bacon.R.

This included a multi-arched loggia below, with a first-floor long gallery 87 feet in length, set between two high turrets.

From mainstreaming sustainability with powerful demonstrations of economic possibility he has moved to accelerating sustainability. He runs a series of online education and policy dialogues under the banners of the Prem Jain Memorial Trust, INHAF India and the AltTech Foundation. Dr Hariharan also is working to create a quarter million jobs for skills based opportunity with collaborations with the CII, the Institute of Logistics, the IPSC, a few marquee companies in water management. In the higher education sphere, he is leading initiatives to usher in programmes that will make budding architects, engineers and business managers to become market ready and industry relevant. Career His work as founder chairman of Biodiversity Conservation India Limited (1994-2017) led to the creation of homes that defined the grail of green in times when the world had not yet stirred to the threats of climate change. His work on designs for the envelope and beyond the envelope of buildings have signified the pioneering of some of the best green and sustainable practices in the construction sector from about 1991, when he founded the Academy for Mountain Environics and worked on local solutions for kitchen energy and localized solutions for villages in the sub Himalayan region of Garhwal. ZED Homes [standing for zero energy developed homes] with over 2,000 homes spread over 14 projects have stood testimony to what can be achieved within the enterprise mode with a business base of over USD 100 million when he stepped down as executive Chairman in the mid 2010s. From mainstreaming sustainability as founder of those enterprises over 25 years, he has moved on to accelerating sustainability with special focus on urban, industry and agriculture, as the 2020s offer exciting prospects of technology, data analytics, AI and ML for a host of solutions for both existing and new buildings. He has worked with development institutions like the World Resources Institute and the Asian Development Bank, Les Ateliers Maitrise d’Oeuvres Urbaine, Paris, ADEME, UN Habitat and others. He mentors green start-ups on their business models for sustainable solutions with low-carbon footprint for products and services in areas of energy, water, waste and air management. Under another program he has worked on studies relating to residential apartments and energy outcomes.

He was a Member (MP) of the Parliament of England for Cambridge in 1572, for Cambridgeshire in 1584, 1586 and 1589 and for Orford in 1593.http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/member/north- john-1551-97 Life He was born about 1551, was the eldest son of Roger North, 2nd Baron North, of Kirtling or Cartelage, Cambridgeshire, and Winifred, daughter of Richard, lord Rich, widow of Sir Henry Dudley, knt. (Visitation of Nottingham, Harl. Soc. Publ. iv. 82). In November 1562, 'being then of immature age,' he was matriculated fellow- commoner of Peterhouse, of which college his grandfather, Edward, first baron North [q. v.], was a benefactor. Young North was entrusted to the care of John Whitgift, who instructed him in good learning and Christian manners (Strype, Whitgift, p. 14). He migrated to Trinity College in 1567, when Whitgift became master of Trinity, and in November 1569 took the oath as a scholar of the university. On 19 April 1572 the senate passed a grace that his six years' study in humanioribus literis might suffice for his inception in arts, and on 6 May he was admitted M.A. On this occasion the corporation presented him with gifts of wine and sugar, at a cost of 38s. 9d. (Cooper, Annals of Cambridge, p. 307). On Friday, after the nativity of St. John the Baptist, 1572, he was made a free burgess and elected an alderman of Cambridge. In 1576, in accordance with the custom of the times, he travelled in Italy, being away for two years and two months. In 1579, after the union of Utrecht, North went to the Netherlands with Sir John Norris (1547?–1597) [q. v.], and took service as a volunteer in the cause of the provinces. He returned to England in 1580, and probably married. He may be the Mr. North who visited Poland in 1581 (Dee, Diary, p. 19), and who, after returning in 1582, had an audience of the queen, who had been sumptuously entertained at Kirtling in 1578. He was returned M.P. for Cambridgeshire to the fifth parliament of Elizabeth in 1584. He again went to the Netherlands with Leicester and Sidney late in 1585. At Flushing he had a violent quarrel with one Webbe, whose eyes he attempted to gouge out in a desperate encounter. Webbe appealed to Leicester as supreme governor, but he strangely decided that, as both were Englishmen, the matter was in the queen's cognisance. North then returned to England, and sat for Cambridgeshire in the sixth parliament of Elizabeth, which met in October 1586; and again in the seventh, which was summoned for November 1587, but was prorogued to February 1588 (Returns of Members; Willis, Not. Parl. iii. pt. 2, pp. 99, 108, 118). He went a third time to the Netherlands, and joined the enemy in 1597, 'for religion's sake only;' but sent information to his father of certain plots formed against the queen by Thomas Arundell, who had been created a count of the empire. He died in Flanders during his father's lifetime, 5 June 1597. Family He married Dorothy, daughter and heiress of Sir Valentine Dale, LL.D., master of the requests, by whom he had issue: Dudley North, 3rd Baron North, godson of the Earl of Leicester; Elizabeth, wife of William, son of Sir Jerome Horsey; Sir John North, K.B.; Roger Gilbert, the navigator; and Mary, wife of Sir Francis Coningsby of South Mimms, Hertfordshire.

History Originally, the Catholics in the area prayed in the chapel of a nearby convent on Mount Vernon Street. With the Catholic population expanding, plans were drawn up for the construction of a church that would accommodate the increasing numbers. It was opened in 1886 and the core elements of the church, such as the nave and exterior, were designed by the architectural firm of George Goldie, Goldie, Child & Goldie Ltd. However two other firms also did work for the church. Augustus Pugin's firm, Pugin & Pugin, designed the sanctuary in the 1890s. Also, Sinnott, Powell & Sinnott, who also designed Our Lady Star of the Sea Church in Seaforth, Merseyside did the church hall in 1894. There was originally an entrance to the church from Mount Vernon Street, but with the construction of the Royal Liverpool University Hospital, the road became a private access for the hospital and the entrance was blocked off.

The goal of the project is to create a reusable development platform for building alternative and supplemental user interfaces in support of people with diverse disabilities. The original use of the LSR platform was to give people with visual impairments access to the GNOME desktop and its business applications (e.g. Firefox, OpenOffice, Eclipse) using speech, Braille, and screen magnification. The extensions packaged with the LSR core were intended to meet this end. LSR was an alternative to Orca, but there were a number of non- competitive reasons for having two extensible assistive technologies for the GNOME desktop. * Two implementations stress test desktop accessibility in non- overlapping ways: * Two design philosophies explore different ideas for system architectures and user interfaces. * Two products enable user choice based on the task at hand, personal preferences, and the individual strengths of the two systems. * There is ton of room for innovation in the field of enabling technology. Linux Screen Reader (LSR) was started in 2006 by IBM. Initially, LSR was released with the Common Public License but on November 29, 2006, the version 0.3.2 was switched to the New BSD License. It was discontinued in 2007 when IBM focused their resources in other projects.  Maintainers list  The maintainers managed the development process with the help of many other members of the GNOME community: * Larry Weiss * Brett Clippingdale * Peter Parente Other developers who made great contributions to the project were Pete Brunet, Eirikur Hallgrimsson, Scott Haeger, Eitan Isaacson, Andy Shi, Critóbal Palmer and Joel Feiner.

After the Mongol invasion (1241–1242), where voivode Pousa, son of Sólyom died, the consolidation of the province of Transylvania was the main task of Lawrence, who was appointed voivode by Béla IV and held the office for 10 years from 1242.Sălăgean 2005, pp. 175–176. He also fought in the royal army in a war against Austria in 1246 and participated in the battle of the Leitha River, where Frederick the Quarrelsome killed.Sălăgean 2005, p. 176. Besides his voivodeship, Lawrence also functioned as ispán of Valkó County from 1248 to 1252.Zsoldos 2011, p. 220. During the throne fights in the 1260s, he supported junior king Stephen, who rebelled against his father's rule and governed Transylvania independently from Béla IV, holding the title of duke of Transylvania. Consequently, Lawrence served as master of the treasury for Stephen between 1263 and 1265.Zsoldos 2011, p. 75. He was appointed ban of Severin () in 1263, where Stephen also exercised the royal rights.Zsoldos 2011, p. 49. References Sources * Engel, Pál (2001).

Early life Upton House, commissioned by the 3rd Baronet Cullen was the son of Sir Abraham Cullen, 1st Baronet, MP of East Sheen, Surrey and Upton near Banbury in Warwickshire, and his wife Abigail Rushout, daughter of John Rushout, merchant of St Dionis Backchurch, London and Maylords, Havering, Essex. In 1677, he succeeded his brother John to the baronetcy. He married his cousin Mary Adams widow of William Adams of Sprowston, Norfolk and daughter of Sir John Maynard of Tooting Graveney, Surrey on 13 April 1686. In 1688, he sold the estate at East Sheen, and bought more property at Upton, for £7,000. His wife who died in about 1694, had inherited property in Cambridgeshire where he was appointed a deputy-lieutenant. At Upton, he built the mansion known as Upton House in about 1695 and he then married, as his second wife, Eleanor Jarrett, daughter of William Jarrett, merchant, of St Dionis Backchurch, on 19 July 1696. Career Cullen stood for Parliament as a Whig at Cambridgeshire at a by-election on 21 December 1693, and lost by seven votes to The Lord Cutts. At the 1695 English general election he stood on the suggestion of his brother-in-law, Sir James Rushout, 1st Baronet at Evesham, but, being an outsider, was narrowly defeated. He was finally returned as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Cambridgeshire at a by-election on 16 December 1697. At the 1698 English general election, he was returned in a contest, and was returned unopposed at the two general elections of 1701. In February 1702 he acted as a teller for the first time. He was a Whig and, by an electoral pact, was returned unopposed, with the Tory Granado Pigot, at the 1702 English general election. At the 1705 English general election he topped the poll in a close contest and voted for the Court candidate for Speaker on 25 October 1705. He supported the Court side over the 'place clause' of the regency bill on 18 February 1706. At the 1708 British general election, he was returned unopposed and continued to support the Whig administration acting as teller twice in the first session. He voted for the naturalization of the Palatines in 1709 and for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710. He did not seek re- election at the 1710 British general election, and retired to his Warwickshire estates. Death and legacy Cullen died on 15 October 1730, and was buried at Upton. He had one daughter, Mary, who married Sir John Dutton, 2nd Baronet but no male heir, so the baronetcy became extinct. He left as his heir his nephew Thomas Bedford of the Middle Temple.

It is written and directed by filmmaker Amit Gupta. It tells the story of two brothers, Raja and Jagi, who are both chefs, but fall out catastrophically. They set up rival restaurants, on opposite sides of Belgrave Road in Leicester; one cooking starters and the other main courses, and refuse to talk to one another. Raja's daughter Shalini, attempts to get the brothers talking again. She hatches a plan and asks them to work together to cook her a perfect Indian wedding banquet.  Plot  Two brothers, both wonderful chefs, fall out catastrophically. At the climax of their dispute they rip the family recipe book in half – one brother gets the starters and the other gets the main courses. They set up rival restaurants, on opposite sides of the same road, and spend the next twenty years trying to outdo each other. Neither brother will admit it but they both know they are not entirely successful without the ‘other half’ of the menu. It takes Raja's daughter, Shalini, a successful London lawyer, marrying a man from a different ethnic background, to reunite them. She is planning her marriage and is determined that they will both attend. Can the men bury the hatchet without actually burying the kitchen knife? Shalini returns home to Leicester for the Hindu festival of Holi to tell her father and her uncle that she's getting married. But it takes a challenge from a sharp ambitious new restaurant owner who tries to put them out of business and a threat from Shalini that she will not have a traditional Indian wedding before the brothers finally start to unravel the secret behind the quarrel which has lasted two decades.

Originally dating from the late 15th century, it was completely remodelled in 1870. It stands in its own grounds overlooking a lake in the Quy Water. History A manor house known as Quy Hall had stood on the site since the late 15th century. In the 17th century the hall was occupied by the Whichcote baronets, the 3rd Baronet of whom sold it c.1720 to James Martin, a London banker. In 1854 the Martins sold it on to Clement Francis, a Cambridge solicitor, who carried out the substantial rebuilding to designs by William White. The grounds were also progressively extended to cover some 135 acres (55 ha) by the late 19th century. The property has passed down in the Francis family ever since.

It originally dates to the 15th century, and some of the roof trusses remain from that era as well as 16th century ones in the south front roof. The end crosswing gables, three central gables and three service range gables are all in chequered patterned brickwork. In the 1870s the house was completely remodelled by William White and what is believed to be decorator Thomas Gambier Parry, who decorated and painted the drawing room, dining room and library. Gambier Parry was staying in the vicinity during his work on Ely Cathedral. 18th century doors remain on the dining room. Both of the staircases and fireplaces were designed by White.

Local residents protested and anti-fracking environmentalists in the UK made it a focus of attention. The drill pad is located in a wooded area known as Lower Stumble Wood. Background After the initial announcement of plans to drill a local protest group was formed and a picnic was held. There was considerable opposition to exploration plans with a poll conducted by the Balcombe Parish Council showing that 82% of local residents were opposed. Cuadrilla Resources, the company that proposes to drill the well, engaged in public relations efforts attempting to convince villagers that the project was both useful and safe. Previous exploration by Conoco in the same area in 1986 was abandoned due to low production of oil. As of June 2013 Balcombe had emerged as a focus of opposition to fracking in the Weald Basin of southeast England. No actual permits that allowed for fracking were ever asked for or issued.http://www.wscountytimes.co.uk/news/local/protesters-speak-out-as- balcombe-fracking-company-is-granted- permit-1-5322532https://www.westsussex.gov.uk/media/3040/balcombe_jr.pdf Drilling In July 2013 a licence to drill the well was granted by the Environment Agency and Cuadrilla began transporting equipment and supplies to the test site. The well would be deep with a possible horizontal leg. The property is owned by the Balcombe Estate which is managed by Simon Greenwood, a local resident and a member of the Balcombe Parish Council that granted permission for the well. It is the opinion of Mr. Greenwood that there is low risk for a well regulated under UK regulations. Protests thumb On 25 July 2013 colourfully dressed protestors blocked the gates to the site and prevented passage of a lorry with drilling equipment. On 26 July there was a heavy police presence at the gates and about a dozen protestors were arrested and charged with violation of section 241 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 which governs picketing. Protests continued on 27 July and additional protestors were arrested. Frack Off protestors from outside the immediate area have proven to be aggressive and creative. After receiving intelligence developed by the local police of credible threats of direct action the company suspended drilling on 16 August. Up to 1,000 protesters were expected for a six-day \\"Reclaim the Power\\" camp at the annual meeting of the No Dash for Gas environmental action movement. Workshops in skills-sharing in campaign building and direct action were planned. The height of the security fence around the site was doubled and razor wire installed. No Dash for Gas camp Hundreds of protesters from throughout the UK camped on private land at the so-called No Dash for Gas \\"Reclaim the Power\\" camp during the weekend of 17–18 August about a mile from the drilling pad in a field west of Cherry Lane near the intersection with London Road (B2036)in Cuckfield Parish. Facilities such as kitchens and toilets were erected without permission to support hundreds of expected participants. 38 Degrees, a not- for-profit political-activism organisation reported raising £50,000 with £30,000 budgeted to support local groups, £10,000 for training, and £10,000 on development of internet sites and infrastructure. 2,000 marched in Balcombe on held Sunday with direct action scheduled to commence on Monday. After 2 days of direct action protests the camp began breaking up on Wednesday 21 August, leaving a contingent of those who have been protesting since July behind. Direct action On 19 August activists engaged in direct actions at Cuadrilla headquarters in Lichfield, Staffordshire and at the London offices of Bell Pottinger, which conducts its public relations. A few protesters gained entry to Cuadrilla's building and posted banners reading \\"Reclaim the Power\\" and \\"Power to the People,\\" and, at Bell Pottinger, several protesters super glued themselves to the entrance, posting a banner over its entrance reading \\"Bell Pottinger Fracking Liars.\\" The entrance to the drilling site was also blocked by protesters who were locked together. There was a heavy police presence. As the day progressed the protesters where pushed to the side; dozens of arrests were made including Caroline Lucas the only Green Party MP. Lucas was released on bail the next day. Most arrests at the entrance to the drilling site were made under a section of the Public Order Act, failure to comply with a condition made by a senior police officer on the scene. There were also direct actions at the homes of Lord Howell and Francis Maude, the Conservative MP who represents Balcombe. Significance According to Fiona Harvey of The Guardian the Balcombe protests coincide with movement of the issue of hydraulic fracturing to the front of the public agenda in the United Kingdom. The initial permits to drill near Balcombe were issued routinely as were permits in other parts of the UK such as Lancashire where fracking operations are believed to have resulted in two small earthquakes. As of August 2013 public opinion was evenly divided with about 40% of the public for and 40% against. The Balcombe protests occurred against a background of political and public relations blunders such as this remark by the government energy minister Michael Fallon: > The beauty of that - please don't write this down - is that of course [the > oil and gas resources of the Weald Basin] are underneath the commentariat. > All these people writing leaders saying, \`Why don't they get on with shale?' > We are going to see how thick their rectory walls are, whether they like the > flaring at the end of the drive. There is growing public awareness of the potential impacts of industrial scale exploitation of shale gas. Judicial Review Request On 5 December 2014 the High Court has dismissed Frack Free Balcombe Residents’ Association’s (FFBRA’s) claim for a judicial review to quash the County Council’s grant of planning permission for oil and gas exploration and appraisal south of Balcombe. According to Mr Justice Gilbart, author of the judgement, there was never really a question of fracking at Balcombe: > I have no doubt whatever that this proposal has caused considerable concern > to the Claimant Association. I recognise also that some parts of the public > are concerned about the process commonly known as “fracking” although I must > observe also that this application did not seek permission for that > activity. The judgement concludes by rejecting the request for a judicial review.

Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 375. Abstract available from http://www.tracemaker.com. Traditionally, two models have been proposed for Nereites: # in the ‘worm model’, Nereites is a feeding burrow produced by wormlike organisms, probing and backfilling laterally # in the ‘arthropod model’, the characteristic lobes are pressure-release structures made by arthropod legs. According to this interpretation, Nereites is a locomotion trail  Nereites irregularis  The ichnogenus Nereites includes Nereites irregularis (formerly Helminthoida labyrinthica and Helminthoida crassa). They are relatively small Nereites characterized by large numbers of closely packed deeply meandering trails that tend to coil. The trails are usually horizontal and may be regular to irregular in guidance. The central tunnel is usually thicker than the envelope zone. In dense meanders, the envelope zone may touch or overlap, but it displays low- amplitude lobes in looser meanders. Nereites irregularis has not been matched with known modern organisms, but they are generally believed to have been grazing trails (pascichnia) made by worms.  Nereites biserialis  Nereites biserialis comprises winding trails constituted by a furrow flanked on both sides by lobes. Incipient biseriate Nereites are produced by hermit crabs occupying oblong shells (i.e. Cerithium).  Nereites uniserialis  Nereites uniserialis comprises winding trails consisting of a furrow flanked by a single row of lobes. In contrast to the roughly symmetric Nereites biserialis, Nereites uniserialis is produced by hermit crabs occupying trochiform shells.

It is a remake of Clint Eastwood's 1992 western Unforgiven. The film was screened in the Special Presentation section at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. The film also made its US debut as the opening film for LA EigaFest 2013. It was also presented in 2014 in the Palm Springs International Film Festival (World Cinema Now category) and out of competition in the 70th Venice International Film Festival. The plot closely follows the original 1992 film, but shifts the setting to Japan's Hokkaido frontier during the early Meiji period. Jubei Kamata (Ken Watanabe), a former samurai, is approached by an old associate to help claim the bounty on two men who have disfigured a prostitute. Plot Shortly after the start of the Meiji period, a former samurai under the Edo Shogunate, Jubei Kamata, flees from government forces on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. Jubei kills his pursuers and disappears, but remains infamous as \\"Jubei the Killer\\". Years later, in a frontier town, two brothers, Sanosuke and Unosuke Hotta, disfigure a prostitute. The local lawman, Ichizo Oishi, lets the brothers go with only minor chastisement instead of dispatching them to Sapporo to face justice. The other prostitutes gather together the reward for a bounty on the two brothers. This draws several bounty hunters, including Kingo Baba, an old associate of Jubei. One of the bounty hunters, Masaharu Kitaoji, arrives with his biographer. Armed with swords, he draws the attention of Oishi, who demands he hand over his weapons as they are banned in the town. Confronted by lawmen with firearms, Kitaoji has to accept, but is then beaten and humiliated by Oishi. The following day, Oishi throws him out of the town, but the biographer, Himeji, stays behind to write about Oishi instead. Kingo tracks Jubei down to a small farm where he lives in poverty with his two children. Although reluctant, Kingo convinces Jubei to help him earn the bounty by killing the two men. On the way, they are joined by Goro Sawada, a brash young half-Ainu man who claims to have killed five men already. When the trio arrive at the frontier town, Oishi finds and recognises Jubei at the inn. He taunts, beats, and scars Jubei, but doesn't kill him. Kingo and Goro are upstairs with the prostitutes and escape unharmed. After recuperating with the help of the prostitutes, the three men track down one of their targets and kill him. Jubei delivers the killing blow after Kingo is unable to do so himself. After this, Kingo admits that he doesn't have the stomach for killing. Handing Jubei his rifle, he leaves the other two men to collect the bounty. Jubei and Goro return to the town to kill the other Hotta brother. Jubei sends Goro in to kill the man while he uses an outhouse. After a scuffle in which Goro is unable to get a fatal shot with his pistol, he stabs the Hotta brother with an Ainu knife. Although Jubei and Goro escape, Oishi's men are able to track down Kingo, who is killed after a night of torture. Jubei learns of his friend's death when one of the prostitutes delivers the bounty. Sober for years, he drinks the last of Goro's liquor and returns to the town to exact revenge. Before he leaves, he orders Goro and the scarred prostitute, Natsume, to deliver his share of the bounty to his children and look after them. Jubei returns to the inn and a battle ensues between him, Oishi, and the posse Oishi had put together to hunt down Jubei and Goro. Despite being wounded several times, Jubei is able to kill Oishi and several of his men, and the survivors flee. He orders Himeji, who witnessed the battle, to write about what he saw. However, Jubei knows that the Japanese authorities would be particularly harsh if they found out that Goro, who is half-Ainu, had been involved in the killing of two Japanese men. He therefore demands that Himeji leave Goro and the Ainu out the account, and threatens to kill the writer if he mentions them. Having returned to Jubei's farm, Natsume explains how she might be willing to settle down there with Goro, looking after Jubei's children. She is hopeful that one day, Jubei might return. He is last seen walking alone, in the snow, somewhere in Hokkaido.

It is a platform where citizens can rate the performance of their elected representatives on I for India's web-platform, based on the quality of public services in their assembly constituency. This data is used to generate real-time report cards for Members of Legislative Assembly (MLAs), Members of Parliament (MPs), Chief Ministers (CMs) and the Prime Minister. Mission The goal of this organization is to include more citizens in the democratic process, to inform the voters about their representatives and the quality of public services in their areas. Additionally the foundation aims at bringing data-driven discussions and accountability into politics by tracking the performance of politicians on a real-time basis. People behind the initiative iForIndia was founded by Ankur Garg, an IIM Ahmedabad alum and an ex-Microsoft employee and Tarun Jain, a University of Southern California grad and an ex-Capital One Financial employee.iForIndia was founded in 2013. Report Card The Report Cards display the aggregated ranking on each of the 24 parameters that users rate their representative's performance on. Each Report Card also contains an overall ranking for the elected official. They also include basic information about the elected public officials like his/her educational background, profession, and participation in Parliament. The report cards are available on the website iForIndia.org. Rating System The ratings are on a scale of 0 to 5. An average rating of 0-2 is 'Fail,' 2-3.5 is 'Average' and 3.5-5 is 'Pass'. People can rate their representatives on very specific issues. The parameters cover the broad categories of basic needs (electricity, water, transport, sanitation, education, healthcare), governance & administration (law & order, govt offices, e-governance, price rise, poverty, disaster management), growth & progress (traffic, roads, higher education, jobs, business friendliness, tourism) and reputation (scams, public comments, women empowerment, backward sections, religious harmony, fulfilling promises) etc. These factors help in calculating metric specific ratings, category ratings (aggregates of metrics within a category) and an overall rating for the official. User Authentication A strong focus on security includes a mobile number authentication and fraud check algorithms to ensure the identity of individuals rating their elected officials cannot be compromised and that the system remains defensible against fake users and multiple account holders. Future Plans I for India plans on launching the portal in most regional languages, developing a smartphone apps, SMS based rating, call back option, and kiosks.

Due to the film's \\"naturalistic tone\\", he notes there's little music. Storring wrote on his blog that Veninger and he \\"tried numerous types of things with different scenes, and in some of those cases the decision was ultimately no music at all.\\" Friendly Rich & The Lollipop People appear in the film with \\"Sei Spento il Sole\\". Reception In a story about Canadian films at TIFF in 2013 when the film premiered, Maclean's dubbed Veninger \\"Toronto’s reigning queen of DIY cinema\\". Release The film premiered at the Contemporary World Cinema section at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. The film has also screened at the St. John's International Women's Film Festival, with a one-hour \\"making of\\" talkback section. In November, it will screen at the Denver Film Festival. Critical reception NOW Magazine commented that \\"It may not be the sort of hyper-personal near-meta-fiction Veninger defined her career with, but The Animal Project seems to similarly prod the relationship between interiority and outside world.\\" In a review, the magazine gave it their highest rating, \\"NNNN\\", declaring it a transitional project for the director, who \\"upped her game without abandoning any of her characteristic whimsy.\\" They note the film has a narrative story unlike her previous films, and a \\"more formal visual style\\". Highlighting actor Aaron Poole in an article, Torontoist suggested that the film was \\"heavy with emotional baggage but imbued with a lightness that comes from being partially improvised,\\" suggesting it might \\"demonstrate a different side of Poole.\\" Ilse de Mucha Herrera for The Arts Scene website suggested that the film is \\"nothing short of delightful\\", a \\"refreshing\\" film with \\"a script full of passion with relatable characters and creative sequences,\\" rating it 4/5. Isabel Cupryn of Canadian Film Review commented: \\"With pure honesty and unwavering compassion for its characters, it's hard not to fall in love with this quiet, thoughtful film. The Animal Project is like its creator Ingrid Veninger — genuine and true to its heart.\\" Weekly newspaper The Grid suggested that the use of costumes is \\"less striking than it's intended to be\\", but \\"the good moments... linger vividly in the rearview mirror,\\" offering it 7/10. Pop culture website Dork Shelf suggested \\"the scattered moments of human observation that make up the film are almost always careful and poignant,\\" but the overall film premise and characters' \\"revelatory experiences\\" \\"never [feel] genuine.\\" Canadian entertainment website Scene Creek also gave a less than enthused review, 2 out of 5 stars. Critic Danielle La Valle praised the father and son conflict, suggesting it should have been the film's focus, praising Jacob Switzer's \\"great skill and understatement\\" in the role. The review cites the dysfunction of Leo needing to disguise himself and offer free hugs at his son's high school, in order to feel comfortable hugging him. She suggests that the concept of obliterating comfort zones with the costumes is incorrect, as the outfits would add a layer of comfort through anonymity. Toronto Star connected the film with six other Canadian films screening at the festival, all with themes of identity. Critic Linda Barnard deemed it 3/4 stars. Yahoo!

He discovered the first starspot and made the first photometric observation of a stellar flare. A graduate of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he earned a Master of Science degree in mechanical engineering in 1934, Kron became interested in astronomy, which he studied under Joel Stebbins. Stebbins arranged for Kron to enter the University of California at Berkeley, where he received his doctorate in astronomy in 1938. During World War II, Kron served with the Radiation Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and participated in the development of microwave radar. He later became the head of the Special Devices Group at the Naval Ordnance Test Station (NOTS) at Inyokern, California, where he conducted studies on solid fuel rockets, and developed radio transponders for the Manhattan Project's Project Camel. After the war Kron returned to the Lick Observatory, where he was one of the designers of the C. Donald Shane telescope. Using photometric techniques that he had pioneered before the war, he studied the stars, especially eclipsing binaries. In 1965, Kron became director of the United States Naval Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, and he was a regular visitor to the Australian National University's Mount Stromlo Observatory. Early life Gerald Edward Kron was born in Milwaukee on 6 April 1913, the son of Edmund Kron, a mechanic, and his wife Letty Dieterick Kron. He attended Lincoln High School in Milwaukee, and then University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he earned a Master of Science degree in mechanical engineering in 1934. While there took advantage of the access to machine shops as part of his training to design and build a 6-inch telescope. After graduation, he received a scholarship to study astronomy for two years under Joel Stebbins. He published his first paper in 1935, a study of the photometric elements of Boss 5070, an eclipsing binary. In 1935, Kron travelled to California with Stebbins and Albert Whitford, where Kron and Whitford assisted Stebbins at the Mount Wilson Observatory. After returning to Madison, he worked with Whitford on the design of a 200-inch telescope. Stebbins arranged for Kron to enter the University of California at Berkeley, where he received his doctorate in astronomy in 1938, with a thesis on the photometric elements of eclipsing binaries. He then worked in the Lick Observatory as a research assistant. World War II In May 1940 Kron joined the Radiation Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and participated in the development of microwave radar. He would later use devices and equipment that he became familiar with at the Radiation Laboratory such as the RCA IP21 photomultiplier and Direct-coupled amplifiers in looking at the stars. Later in World War II he became head of the Special Devices Group at the Naval Ordnance Test Station (NOTS) at Inyokern, California, where he conducted studies on solid fuel rockets. He also participated in the Manhattan Project's Project Camel, developing instrumentation to evaluate the test drops of nuclear bomb shapes. Radio transponders with timing pulses attached to the bombs allowed their position to be tracked the release of the bomb until the time it was all destroyed when the bomb detonated in the air or hit the ground. This gave the drop time to within a few hundredths of a second. In the course of his duties he visited Kingman and Wendover Army Air Fields. When the war ended, he \\"liberated\\" some equipment from NOTS before it could be destroyed. Later life Eclipsing binary. Algol B orbits Algol A. After the war Kron returned to the Lick Observatory, where he was one of the designers and creators of the C. Donald Shane telescope. During the war, Kron met Katherine Carson Gordon, a Vassar College graduate and a Radcliff College student, at a picnic at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. After the war, she became an assistant at Lick Observatory. He married her on 22 April 1946. She continued publishing papers under her maiden name. The two worked together, looking at eclipsing binaries. At one point they found an irregularity, which they attributed to an area of colder temperature, a starspot. His observation and explanation were correct, but he was ahead of his time. It would be many years before the existence of starspots was accepted, and they became a popular research topic. They also made the first photometric observation of a stellar flare. In 1965, Kron became director of the United States Naval Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. He regularly visited Canberra in Australia, where the Mount Stromlo Observatory allowed him to study M-type dwarf stars in the southern sky. He was senior research fellow at the Australian National University in Canberra from 1974 to 1976. He retired in 1985 to live in Honolulu, but moved to Sedona, Arizona, in 1995. Kron served for a time as President of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, and the International Astronomical Union's Commission on Instrumentation. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society. Kron published over 130 scientific papers, many of them described the method accurately measure the light of stars and globular clusters. He pioneered the use of photomultiplier tubes to measure the infrared radiation of cold stars. His measurements of globular clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud revised earlier views on distances outside the Milky Way Galaxy. He died on 12 April 2012. His wife Katherine and son Donald predeceased him. He was survived by his brother Robert and his remaining four children, Richard, Jenny, Virginia and Charles.

It was screened in the Contemporary World Cinema section at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. The film has been praised by critics for its performances by Castillo and Lange. It deals with many topics ranging from adolescence and parent-child tensions to gender identity and sexuality. Its setting in Venezuelan society also contributes to many of the film's themes. Plot Junior, a young nine-year-old boy, lives in Caracas in a shoddy apartment complex with his mother and baby brother. He has \\"pelo malo,\\" a Hispanic term for curly, Afro-textured hair, which he constantly attempts to straighten using various methods, including smearing a mixture of mayonnaise and other ingredients into it. His hair is a constant source of frustration for both he and his mother, who does not approve of his obsession with his looks, believing that it's not normal behavior for a young boy his age. Junior and his friend from the apartments, \\"La Niña,\\" spend a lot of time together in her family's apartment watching the Venezuelan beauty pageants on TV. La Niña is the classic \\"girly girl,\\" dressing like a princess and playing with makeup and dolls often. Junior also enjoys the beauty pageants, and when the time comes for the two to take their school pictures, La Niña chooses to dress as a princess while Junior wants to dress as a singer with straight hair. It is in this scene that the double standard for males and females in Latin American society is demonstrated best; the photographer suggests that Junior dress as something more masculine, suggesting a soldier with a gun and hat. It is considered normal for La Niña to be obsessed with beauty and dresses and pictures, but for Junior it is not a normal interest. His mother does not approve of his constant grooming and takes it to be a sign of his homosexuality. Twice she takes him to the doctor to find out if he is developing \\"normally,\\" later coming out and asking the doctor straightforwardly if he is gay. When the doctor suggests he needs a stronger male influence at home (the mother is widowed), she brings home her boss and has sex with him, forcing Junior to watch them through his open bedroom door. Junior rolls over in his bed in an attempt to look away. The treatment of Junior's \\"abnormal\\" obsession with his hair is placed at the spotlight of the movie, amid other far worse aspects of society and life around him. In the apartments, the children face many dangers; La Niña even says at one point in the movie that she fears they will be raped, with Junior telling her not to worry about that because \\"you have to be pretty to be raped\\" to which she responds, \\"then you have nothing to lose.\\" This also demonstrates the double standards for beauty and sexuality facing Venezuelan society. The movie is also set against the backdrop of the announcement that Hugo Chávez is dying, signifying the end of an era in Venezuela and uncertainty for the future. Amid all these problems, the issue of Junior's hair and his sexuality is still the main focus of the film.

Dictionaries, grammars and inflection tables were combined in a set of web- based tools to provide comprehensive reading support for scholars, students and independent readers. The tools were implemented as browser add-ons so that they could be used on any web site or any page that a user might create in Unicoded HTML. In collaboration with the Perseus Digital Library, the goals of the Alpheios Project were subsequently broadened to combine reading support with language learning. Annotation and editing tools were added to help users contribute to the development of new resources, such as enhanced texts that have been syntactically annotated or aligned with translations. The Alpheios tools are designed modularly to encourage the addition of other languages that have the necessary digital resources, such as morphological analyzers and dictionaries. In addition to Latin and ancient Greek, Alpheios tools have been extended to Arabic and Chinese. The Alpheios Project is a non-profit (501c3) initiative. The software is open source, and resides on Sourceforge.com. The Alpheios software is released as GPL 3.0 and texts and data as CC-by-SA.  History  The Alpheios Project was established in 2007 by Mark Nelson, the founder of the commercial software company Ovid Technologies, which he started after writing a search engine for medical literature that became widely popular in medical libraries and research facilities (Strauch, 1996). Nelson, who holds an MA in English literature from Columbia University, sold the company to Wolters Kluwer in 1999 (Quint, 1998). Nelson created Alpheios by recruiting several developers and programmers from his previous company, defining the project's initial goals and funding its first three years of operation. In 2008 he also provided the initial funding for The Perseus Treebank of Ancient Greek, which has subsequently been crowd-sourced. In 2011, the Perseus Project hired key Alpheios staff and the activities of the projects were extensively integrated, although Alpheios remains an independent organization focused on developing adaptive reading and learning tools that can provide formative assessment customized to the individual user's special abilities and goals, including the study of specific authors or texts. To date, all Alpheios applications, enhanced texts and code have been provided without any fees or licenses.

The discovery of its type species Rugosodon eurasiaticus was reported in the 16 August 2013 issue of Science. The species is the oldest so far described in the multituberculate family, the most successful and long-lasting lineage of all mammals. Description Rugosodon is represented by a nearly complete fossilized skeleton, including a skull, that bears a strong resemblance to a small rat or a chipmunk. The mammal is estimated to have weighed between 65-80 g, about that of an average chipmunk. The generic name Rugosodon (Latin for \\"wrinkly tooth\\") refers to the rugosity, or wrinkliness, of the distinctively shaped teeth. Its teeth indicate that the animal was an omnivore, well-adapted to gnawing both plants and animals, including fruits and seeds, worms, insects and small vertebrates. Its ankle joints were highly mobile at rotation, a characteristic of mammals living in trees. This means that the ankle is remarkably flexible, allowing the foot to hyper-extend downward — like a ballerina standing on pointed toes — and to rotate through a wide range of motion. This feature, along with highly mobile digits, defines the multituberculates and is not seen in other mammalian lineages of the era. Rugosodon also had a highly flexible spine, which would have allowed it to twist both left to right and front to back. Discovery and taxonomic significance In 2009, a local fossil hunter unearthed an unusual fossil in the Tiaojishan Formation of China's Liaoning province, dating to 160 million years ago. He turned the fossil over to the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, where it was eventually identified as a nearly complete skeleton and given the name Rugosodon eurasiaticus. The fossil was discovered on what was the shore of an ancient lake. It was preserved in two shale slabs and measures about 17 cm (6.5 inches) long from head to rump. The site of the discovery consists of lake sediments with embedded volcanic layers, which also contained fossils of feathered dinosaur Anchiornis and the pterosaur Darwinopterus. The dental features of Rugosodon most resemble those of multituberculates of the Late Jurassic of Western Europe, suggesting that Europe and Asia had extensive mammal faunal interchanges (hence the specific name, eurasia) during the Jurassic. Prior to the discovery of Rugosodon, scientists knew that multituberculates living 66 million years ago had highly flexible ankles. However, older species were mostly known from small fragments, and it was not proven that the trait was ancestral. Additionally, it was unknown what sort of diet was primitive in the lineage. The presence of the characteristic flexible ankles in Rugosodon demonstrates that the trait is ancestral and provides a strong clue that the trait was a major factor in the lineage's evolutionary success. The animal's diet provides a bridge between very early mammals, which were mostly insectivores, and later multituberculates, which were mostly herbivores. The features of Rugosodon also suggest that the animal initiated tree-dwelling habits among mammals.

It rises near Mahableshwar, a famous hill station in the Western Ghats. The river meets the Krishna River, which is one of the three largest rivers in southern India by Karad. The river is small and is slow-flowing.  Geography and history  Mahabaleshwar is the source of five rivers namely Krishna River, Koyna, Venna (Veni), Savitri, and Gayatri. The source is at the Panchaganga temple in old Mahabaleshwar. The legendary source of the river is a spout from the mouth of a statue of a cow in the ancient temple of Mahadev in Old Mahabaleshwar. Legend has it that Krishna is Lord Vishnu himself as a result of a curse on the trimurtis by Savitri. Also, its tributaries Venna and Koyana are said to be Lord Shiva and Lord Brahma themselves. An interesting thing to notice is that 4 other rivers including Gayatri come out from the cow's mouth apart from Krishna and they all travel some distance before merging into Krishna.
