He obtained his master's degree in law in Constitutional & International Law from the Campus Centre of OULC in 1963. Legal career Markandeya apprenticed with, and was also a junior to Ramkrishen Rao Nimbalkar, a leading lawyer of the City Civil Court, Hyderabad, one time President of its Bar Association and member of the first Bar Council of Andhra Pradesh, where he engaged in civil law practice. In 1965, he got the opportunity to practice under Jagdish Swarup, legendary lawyer of Allahabad High Court, where he honed his skills in the civil, constitutional, regulatory and interpretation laws. He also acquired independent cases for the Supreme Court of India, particularly in labour and service laws. In 1968 he shifted to Supreme Court as a trainee Advocate-on-Record (AOR) under R. Vasudev Pillai. He was enrolled as AOR by the Supreme Court in 1970 and appeared in several 'cause c√©l√®bre' cases from all over India. He was appointed Standing Counsel by the Central Government in 1977 and he appeared in cases of prime importance, including Minerva Mills vs. Union of India. and Som Prakash Rekhi vs. UOI (3), Sanjay Gandhi vs. Delhi Administration The Supreme Court appointed him amicus curiae in the \\"Tihar Jail Enquiry\\" Case, which spurred major jail reforms and protection of prisoners' human rights. A petition was moved in the Supreme Court by Markandeya contending that the resignations submitted by MLAs on the issue of Telangana be deemed to have been accepted by the Andhra Pradesh Assembly Speaker. He said MLAs belonging to Telangana, irrespective of their political affiliations, submitted their resignations to the Speaker, who acknowledged the receipt of 139 letters. During the Emergency, his joint efforts with R. P. Goel, [later Advocate General of Uttar Pradesh] brought succour and freedom to hundreds of detenues throughout India and particularly Uttar Pradesh. Markandeya was also appointed Counsel for the Allahabad High Court, State of Uttar Pradesh, its various Public Undertakings, Development Authorities, Universities and local bodies. He also appeared for a number of public sector undertakings like Life Insurance Corporation,  Notable cases  In AVS Narasimha Rao vs. State of Andhra Pradesh (6), CB led by Chief Justice M. Hidayatullah struck down section 3 of the Andhra Pradesh Public Employment[Requirement as to Residence] Act, 1956 (AP PE [RR] Act) enacted by India's parliament for reserving lower government posts for residents of backward regions of Telangana of Andhra Pradesh. However, with hard work by Markandeya and other lawyers - and some luck ‚Äì a later judgment held in Director of Industries vs. VV Reddy. In All Saints High School vs. State of Andhra Pradesh, Markandeya strategized the argument that even minority institutions can not be allowed to terminate the services of teachers en masse as such a course would inevitably result in the lowering the standards of excellence, which was accepted by the Supreme Court. Lakshman vs. State of Madhya Pradesh, argued by Markandeya, involved members of the nomadic tribe of Rabari from Rajasthan had been going with their herds of sheep unhindered by changing political boundaries, to the deep south of the sub-continent. The state levied a grazing fee on migratory cattle at twice the rate of fee payable by local herdsmen. In writ petition under Article 32 of the Indian Constitution by the tribesmen, the Supreme Court struck down the discriminatory fee imposed by State of Madhya Pradesh. In T. Venkata Reddy vs. State of Andhra Pradesh, Chief Minister N. T. Rama Rao terminated the services of over 37,000 Village Officers without taking into consideration the hardship caused to the officers. After the Supreme Court upheld the validity of the Ordnance, Markandeya argued that some of the former Vos must be employed first before recruiting anymore ‚Äì a contention that prevailed before the High Court as well as the Supreme Court in appeal. B.Prabhakara Rao vs. the State of A.P. involved a sudden reduction in superannuation age from 58 years to 55 years of over 35,000 public servants of theState Government, public sector undertakings, statutory bodies, educational institutions and Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD). They lost the first round of litigation in the Supreme Court. Realizing the mistake, fresh legislation was brought restoring the original superannuation age of 58 years, but providing that the benefit of new legislation would not extend to those whose reduction of the age of superannuation had been upheld. In challenge to this law, Markandeya argued that all that was required was to strike down naughty \\"not\\" ‚Äì which found favor with the Supreme Court bringing relief to over 35,000 public servants. P. Sambamurthy vs. the State of A.P., related to constitutional validity of clause (5) of Article 371-D inserted in the Constitution for setting up the Andhra Pradesh Administrative Tribunal (A.P.A.T.) for deciding service cases of public servants. Strangely, it was provided that the judgment of the A.P.A.T. could be annulled by the State Government ‚Äì a litigant before the A.P.A.T. Markandeya submitted that the provision that gave a litigant power to annul the judgment of the tribunal, before which it is a party is in the nature of a \\"Bill of Attainder\\" and void, which was accepted by the Supreme Court and clause (5) of Article 371-D was struck down. Pawan Kumar Jain vs. The Union of India was perhaps the first Supreme Court case challenging the constitutional validity of telephone tapping by the Government. Ittihad-al- Khawateen-ul-Musalmeen-e- Hind [Al Khawateen] vs. Union of India challenged the constitutional validity of the Muslim Women's Right to Maintenance Act, 1986 which really robbed the Muslim women of their right to claim any maintenance. The challenge in A.S. Narayana Deekshitulu Etc. vs State Of Andhra Pradesh And Ors was to the A.P. Charitable & Hindu Religious Institutions & Endowments Act, 1987 which took away the rights of the Hindu priests (Archakas) to customary offerings given to them after the performance of rituals (Archakatwam). Markandeya argued that out of more than 37,000 temples in the state only 25 had an annual income of rupees 2.5 million; most of the village temples had an annual income of only rupees 5000 and it is futile to bring them under the purview of the impugned Act. The Supreme Court upheld the validity of the Act but in view of the above argument also directed the State Government to consider the exemption of village temples from the operation of the Act. A massive temple movement started forcing the Government to bring legislation to amend the Act. In Preeti Srivastava vs. State of M.P.(15) petitioner with 63% marks in the admission test did not get admission to the post-graduate medical course while Scheduled Tribe (ST) candidate with 13% marks secured admission in that course. The Supreme Court accepted Markandeya's submission that excessive reservation and dilution of standards for admission in post graduate courses in favor of ST candidates were unconstitutional. In Anil Baluni vs. Surendra Singh Rawat, Markandeya had an uphill task: to persuade the Supreme Court to hold that a Returning Officer [RO] after accepting appellant's nomination as valid, himself made an interpolation to invalidate it. With magnifying glass he had blown up the interpolation and with corroborative evidence on record - forensic report and \\"return\\" sent by RO to the Election Commission of India by 3 p.m. on the date of receiving nomination as mandated by the election manual - Markandeya was able to persuade the Court that Uttaranchal High Court's judgment was flawed. It was, accordingly, set aside, election of successful candidate was quashed and fresh poll for Kotdwar constituency of Uttaranchal Assembly was ordered. In Jaswant Singh VS Mohd. Azam Khan, civil contempt petition no. 386 decided on 25 October 2014, the question was whether the employees of Jal nigam were entitled to the retiral benefits given by the Supreme Court on 2 July 2013. Azam Khan and others alleged contemeror contended that the petitioners were not the parties to that judgment. Markandeya pointed out that the court has used the expression \\"Employees including the respondents\\" which means that employees other than respondents before the court were also beneficiaries of the judgment.The Court accepted Markandeya's argument and gave all retiral benefits to the petitioners who were not parties on 2 July 2013 judgment.

Ahmedi, Asma Niazi one of his interns from Pakistan described him as \\"common human asset of South Asia\\". Personally, Markandeya found his interactions with Salma Mahmood a dedicated Muslim feminist from Hyderabad (whom he calls \\"Aapa\\" ‚Äì elder sister) intellectually very stimulating and rewarding. Inspired by Fatima Mernissi's The Veil and the Male Elite, Mahmood wanted to hold in major Indian cities, Mujahera-e-Burqa-fash [public demonstration of tearing the veil] for which she wrote to the Chief Ministers to provide her police protection from mullahs. Even women Chief Ministers ‚Äì J. Jayalalita of Tamil Nadu and Mayawati of Uttar Pradesh did not extend any such protection. According to him India had come a long way since its freedom.

She married three times: Francis St Clair-Erskine, Lord Loughborough (heir to the 5th Earl of Rosslyn); Sir John Charles Peniston Milbanke, 11th Bt; and Prince Dmitri Alexandrovich of Russia. Chisholm also had close relationships with brothers George VI and Edward VIII, both future Kings of the United Kingdom. Chisholm's romantic liaison with George ended when his father, George V, told him to leave the already-married Australian and find someone more suitable. Known for her striking beauty, she is likely the inspiration for the Australian phrase \\"a good-looking sheila\\".\\"A Sheila who captured London's heart\\" (28 February 2014), SBS. Retrieved 14 March 2015. Family and early years Sheila Chisholm was born on 9 September 1895 on the family property \\"Wollogorang\\", the centre of the locality now called Wollogorang, near Breadalbane, New South Wales, youngest child and only daughter of grazier Harry Chisholm and his wife Margaret, n√©e Mackellar. Her paternal great-grandfather was Scottish and arrived in Australia with the Second Fleet in 1790. The Chisholms became wealthy members of the Squattocracy in New South Wales, and she was raised on \\"Wollogorang\\" with her two older brothers, John and Roy. As the only girl in a rough, male-dominated world, she often attempted to match and outdo the working men at tasks on the station. She recalled how she liked to \\"go out further than the furthest man\\" when swimming at Bondi Beach, until she witnessed a man lose his leg in a shark attack. After her family moved to Sydney in 1912, she attended Kambala School for Girls. Chisholm was attracted to the arts and had a deep appreciation for Australia's flora and fauna. In her unpublished memoir, Waltzing Matilda, she described her adolescent self as \\"a queer mix of romanticism and boyishness ... I was quite unconscious of my looks.\\" Adult life Chisholm at a fancy dress party, 1922 In 1914, Chisholm and her mother sailed to England on SS Mongolia. They planned to spend months in Europe, but their trip was extended by the onset of the First World War, making the long journey back to Australia too dangerous. Chisholm and her mother travelled to Cairo where one of her brothers was stationed with an Australian cavalry regiment. In Cairo, Chisholm met the first of her three husbands, Lord Loughborough. Loughborough was a compulsive gambler, later immortalised as 'the Man who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo'. The couple had two sons together. At the end of 1918, Chisholm met Bertie, the future George VI. Bertie's older brother, Edward, Prince of Wales, had fallen in love with her best friend, Freda Dudley Ward. They called themselves The Four Do's. In April 1920, Bertie ended his relationship with the still married Chisholm in return for a dukedom awarded by his father. Chisholm dated Italian-American actor Rudolph Valentino, who gave her his \\"lucky bracelet\\". He died six months later, causing Chisholm to think it was because she had taken his luck. She inspired British author Evelyn Waugh to write his celebrated 1948 novel The Loved One. Death and legacy Chisholm is buried at Rosslyn Chapel. Her son commissioned a stained glass window of St Francis of Assisi surrounded by animals which can be seen in the chapel‚Äôs baptistry. In a nod to Chisholm's Australian heritage, there is a kangaroo in the bottom left hand corner of the window. Chisholm had fallen into obscurity by the time of her death and was almost completely forgotten until the publication of journalist Robert Wainwright's 2014 biography Sheila: The Australian Beauty Who Bewitched British Society.

Mountaineering and climbing  Rope team at the summit of the Gro√üvenediger; on hard frozen snow there is a higher risk of falling even on ar√™te slopes of only 30¬∞ slope A rope team during an ascent of the Klockerin. Front right: the Flemish loop attached by carabiner to the harness; on the lifeline to the next person, more brake knots are visible In mountain sports, especially climbing, a rope team is a group of mountaineers or climbers who are linked together by a safety rope. In a more general sense, a group of mountaineers, who are travelling together, may also be known as a rope team. The common safety rope helps to protect members of the rope part from falling. That said, it may also heighten the risk for the group as a whole because, unfavourable conditions, the fall of a single member may pull the entire party down as well. In glacier crossings and on easier terrain, long stretches of the route may be negotiated purely by members of the climbing team being roped together without an anchor point being used. For this so-called \\"walking on a rope\\" everyone in the party attaches themselves to the safety rope at equal intervals. For parties of fewer than five people a certain amount of rope remains free at the front and back. The spare rope may be used in the event of a crevasse accident, e.g. to make a Swiss pulley in order to rescue a fallen climber. For larger groups of about four people or more, recovering a fallen man is most easily done using a team pull. When \\"walking on a rope\\", the fall of one person - for example, into a crevasse - must be broken by the rest of the rope team members. So there is a danger that such a fall can endanger the entire team. On steep firn or ice-covered mountainsides, where possible and appropriate, the rope must be secured to an anchor point or the rope team members must negotiate it individually in order to prevent the risk of one climber falling and pulling the rest down with him. When climbing or in steep terrain where there is a high risk of falling, the rope is also secured to fixed points in the rock or ice. At the same time a \\"sliding rope\\" (gleitendes Seil) may be used or the rope may be fixed to a top anchor (Standplatz). A distinction is made between groups of two, three and four persons: * Two-man team: Consisting of a climber and a safety climber (or lead climber and following climber); mostly used in climbing halls, climbing gardens and Alpine climbing. * Three-man team: Comprises a lead climber and two following climbers on a common single rope (branch using rope wedge) or two independent half rope sections; used in multi-rope length routes (e.g. in alpine climbing) and partly also on shorter routes in highlands areas (e.g. the Elbe Sandstone Mountains). * Four-man team: Consisting of a lead climber and three followers; seldom used in alpine climbing. During glacier walks and simple high mountain tours, rope teams of more than four people are not uncommon. There is a tendency for the rope team to move more slowly the more members it has. The reason for this is the increasing amount of time needed in a larger team for the coordination and to ensure the safety and protection of team members. Where the level of skill varies the rope team has to move at the pace of the slowest person.

The foundation stone was laid on 4 June 1887 by Thomas Henry Goodwin Newton, High Sheriff of Warwickshire. The church was built to the designs of the architect John Cotton of Temple Row, Birmingham, and opened on 10 April 1888. It comprised a nave with low aisles, double transepts, a baptistery and the foundations for a tower in the north west corner. A parish was assigned out of All Saints' Church, Hockley. Pevsner records that the church is said to have been renovated in 1891 by William Bidlake. Part of the parish was taken to form a new parish for Bishop Latimer Memorial Church, Winson Green in 1904. In 1972 the church was merged with All Saints' Church, Hockley and Bishop Latimer Memorial Church, Winson Green and the church was demolished in 1974.

He is now best known for his controversial biography of Richard Wagner, Wagner As I Knew Him, published in 1892 after Praeger's death. Life Praeger was born in Leipzig, to Jewish parents, the Dutch-Jewish violinist, composer and conductor Heinrich (Hijman Chaim Aron) Aloys Praeger (Amsterdam 1783 - Magdeburg 1854) and his English-Jewish wife Elizabeth (Wilhelmina), n√©e Davis or Davison (b. 1788). \\"Heinrich Hijman Chaim Aron Aloys Praeger\\" on Geni.com website, accessed 14 March 2015; Heinrich Praeger was a director of opera in Leipzig until 1828, and later at Hanover and Magdeburg.Grove and Warrack (n.d.) Praeger studied the cello as a child but on the advice of Hummel took up the piano. In 1831 he moved to The Hague and in 1834 went on to London, which thereafter became his home. From 1842 onwards he was the British correspondent of the Leipzig Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr Musik, the journal founded by Robert Schumann. In England he continued as a teacher and a composer, marrying his French wife L√©onie in about 1850. His many compositions included piano music, chamber music, and orchestral works (his overture Abellino was conducted by Hector Berlioz in London in 1855).Grove and Warrack (n.d.) These included thirty-six piano sonatas and twenty-five string quartets.Anon (1891), p. 603. He wrote a number of pieces to celebrate Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee (1887), and was still composing shortly before his death in 1891. Some of his works are dedicated to his musical friends, including an 1889 Impromptu dedicated to the composer Ethel Smyth.Nay (2012), 5-6, 15, 7. He was active in British musical social life and worked with many musicians visiting Britain, including Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k.Slav√≠kov√° (1986). But despite lobbying William George Cusins (the Master of the Queen's Musick) to conduct his other orchestral works, he was unable ever to get these performed.Cormack (2013). In 1890 Praeger agreed a contract with the Earl of Dysart to send him for the next 12 years his compositions, for a remuneration of ¬£200 a year. The Earl, who was President of the London Wagner Society, also commissioned him to write a biography of Wagner.Nay (2012), 13. Praeger died in London in 1891.Grove and Warrack (n.d.) Praeger and Wagner Praeger claimed to be an early advocate of Wagner's music, having written the first article on Wagner in the English press in 1845, after hearing the overture to Tannh√§user in Germany.Praeger (1895), loc 1912. In fact, the article was on Wagner's earlier opera, Rienzi. Praeger learned much about Wagner in correspondence with their mutual friend August R√∂ckel, but his published journalism shows him to have been sceptical about the music of the \\"New German School\\" (which included Wagner, Hector Berlioz and Franz Liszt) as late as 1854, in which year he claimed to have been a leader amongst those who persuaded the Philharmonic Society to invite Wagner to London to conduct their 1855 season. However, in March 1855, just before Wagner arrived in London, Praeger wrote to George Hogarth (the Secretary of the Society) that he was not a Wagnerite and had never heard any of Wagner's operas.Cormack (2013). It was in London that Praeger and Wagner actually met for the first time.Anon (1892), p. 235. In his autobiography Mein Leben, Wagner explains how he was introduced to Praeger, via correspondence, by the R√∂ckel family, and how Praeger put him up on his first night in London. Praeger later accompanied him on visits to various musical notables, including the conductor Sir Michael Costa and the violinist Prosper Sainton (who was in fact the prime mover of Wagner's appointment in London). Wagner describes Praeger patronisingly as \\"an unusually good-natured fellow, though of an excitability insufficiently balanced by his standard of culture\\".Wagner (1992), p. 621. Together they visited the pantomime in London and went on trips to Brighton and Gravesend.Spencer (2000), p. 85. Although Praeger sought to be helpful to Wagner during the London season, he may in fact have contributed to the poor reception of Wagner by leading English critics, such as J. W. Davison of The Times, by writing an article in the American Musical World looking forward to the uproar that the music of this \\"ultra-red republican\\" would cause in \\"the musical world of this classical, staid, sober, proper, exclusive, conservative London\\".Newman (1976) II, pp. 466-7\\\\. Davison is scathing about Praeger in his own memoirs (Davison (1912), pp. 164-6.) Wagner became godfather to one of Praeger's sons, Richard Wagner Charles Henry Praeger (b. 1855).Praeger (1892), locs. 3733, 3915. Praeger remained in correspondence with Wagner for some years thereafter, and met with him on several occasions. These included stays with Wagner and his wife Minna in Z√ºrich in July 1857 and with Wagner and his second wife Cosima at Tribschen near Lucerne in the summer of 1871. Praeger saw Wagner at the time of the abortive 1861 Paris production of Tannh√§user, and also saw him at the 1882 Bayreuth Festival.Spencer (2000), p. 85. By this time, however, in Praeger's own words, \\"The world accepted [Wagner] as one of its great men\\" and Praeger no longer had any part in his life.Praeger (1892), loc. 4513. Wagner As I Knew Him Praeger's Wagner As I Knew Him, which he had dictated during his last years, the first full-length biography of Wagner to be created in English, was published a year after the author's death and nine years after the death of its subject. The work was controversial for a number of reasons. Not least, the author claimed, in his introductory dedication to the Earl of Dysart, \\"an uninterrupted friendship of close upon half a century\\" - whereas the period of their intimacy can be set at the most from 1855 until 1871. The author's doubtful claims to have been Wagner's first English champion, and his early opposition to the \\"New German School\\" were also challenged from the start,Anon (1892), p. 234. although the Wagner enthusiast George Bernard Shaw said of the book, \\"A more vivid and convincing portrait than Praeger's was never painted in words.\\"Cormack (2014) But the book soon met more forceful criticism from Wagner's English translator W. Ashton Ellis and Wagner's son- in-law (and major promoter of the Wagner cult at Bayreuth) Houston Stewart Chamberlain. In particular they objected to Praeger's detailed account of Wagner's involvement in the 1849 May Uprising in Dresden, which to Chamberlain's far-right-wing political opinions was deeply embarrassing. Ellis wrote a pamphlet (1849: A Refutation) denouncing the book, and Chamberlain was successful in suppressing its German publication. Praeger's case was not helped when Chamberlain and Ellis revealed that he had fabricated or mis- represented a number of Wagner's letters that had been included in the book, often in such a way as to promote Praeger's own profile. Chamberlain had insinuated himself in the household of the Earl of Dysart in order to examine the originals of the letters.Cormack (2014) However, as the music historian Stewart Spencer points out, there was something \\"distinctly comical\\" about Chamberlain's complaints. As Chamberlain was himself \\"currently overseeing one of the most egregious attempts in the history of musicology to misrepresent an artist [Wagner] by systematically censoring his correspondence, to criticize Praeger ... suggests either a pot-and-kettle blindness or a deliberate attempt to divert attention\\". Nevertheless, Praeger's reputation has never recovered from this initial onslaught.Spencer (2000), p. 81; Newman (1976) II, p. 451. The attack on the biography led to the resignation of Dysart from the Presidency of the London Wagner Society.Cormack (2014) Wagner's supporters may have also been irked by other apparent fabrications by Praeger, such as the claim that Wagner had told him that his first love, at the age of 14, was a Jewish girl in Leipzig.Praeger (1892), locs. 632-664. Throughout the book, Praeger in fact supports and justifies Wagner's anti-Jewish prejudices, including a defence of his anti-Semitic essay Das Judenthum in der Musik,Praeger (1892), locs. 2797-2943. and gives the excuse that \\"Towards Jews and Judaism [Wagner] had a most pronounced antipathy, and yet this did not prevent him from numbering many Hebrews amongst his most devoted friends.\\"Praeger (1892), loc.44. Praeger, however, nowhere reveals that he himself was Jewish.

The village is about from the city centre.  History  In 1993 the Salisbury Hoard was excavated within the parish. These Bronze Age and Iron Age objects are the largest group of prehistoric metal objects ever found in Britain. Many were illicitly dug before being acquired by the British Museum in 1998.British Museum Collection Netherhampton House has a central position in the village. It was built in the 17th century for the Wilton Estate and is Grade II* listed. The village lies on a road which was previously the B3094 and linked the southeast of Salisbury (and main routes further south) with Wilton and the main route to the northwest. The Shell Guide of 1968 describes the church as \\"dangerously close to the busy main road\\". When this road was upgraded to the A3094, a half-mile section was built on a straighter alignment in order to bypass the village to the south.  Parish church  St Catherine's Church There was a chapel at Netherhampton in 1564, when its parish was united with Wilton. The church of St Catherine was rebuilt, except for its 18th-century tower, in 1876‚Äì7 by William Butterfield. The tower is in Flemish bond brick with a shingled roof, while the rest is built in limestone and flint chequers under a tiled roof. Inside, the pews and octagonal stone font are by Butterworth, and the east window is by Gibbs. Since 1972 the parish name has been Wilton with Netherhampton and Fugglestone. Geography The northern part of the parish has water meadows and the River Nadder. The village is bypassed by the A3094 road which links Quidhampton with Harnham, providing a southwestern ring road for Salisbury. Unlike the rest of the Salisbury ring road that is formed of the A36, the A3094 runs through the outer suburbs of Salisbury rather than encircling the city centre. To the west the parish borders the Wilton House estate. To the east was the ancient parish of West Harnham, separated from Netherhampton by the route of a Roman road. When West Harnham parish was abolished in 1934, its land outside the Salisbury built-up area was transferred to Netherhampton. In 1954 the urban boundary was extended to bring the expanded built-up area into Salisbury; since then development has spread further into Netherhampton parish, bringing housing and a business park. The southern part of the parish has farmland. Amenities The village pub, the Victoria and Albert, is a 17th-century cottage extended in the 18th. To the south of the village are a golf club (Salisbury and South Wilts), a garden centre and Salisbury Racecourse.

She established the Jennie Sesnan Gold Medal at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where she had studied and won the Mary Smith Prize. She also studied in Paris at Acad√©mie Julian and Florence. In Massachusetts, Roberts founded and funded the Concord Art Association. Early life Elizabeth Wentworth Roberts, also known as Elsie, was born an only child on June 10, 1871 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her father was George Theodore Roberts. Her paternal grandfather helped found Pennsylvania Railroad Corporation and made a fortune in the railroad and coal mining industries. She knew that she wanted to paint when she was 15 years of age. Her mother, Sarah Cazenova Roberts, wanted her to be a stylish young woman in Philadelphia and New York upper class society. Education Elizabeth Wentworth Roberts, The Black Fan, 1906 Roberts studied art in Philadelphia with Elizabeth Bonsall (1861-1956) and Henry R. Poore (1859-1940) of New York. She won the Mary Smith Prize in 1889 at a Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts exhibition for a painting that was described as beautiful, original, and skillfully executed with a \\"fineness of color\\". She also won an associate fellowship at PAFA. In Paris, she studied at Acad√©mie Julian and then lived in the city for eight years. Roberts studied under Jules Joseph Lefebvre, Robert Fleury, Monsieur Beaugereau, and Merson. The classes at the school segregated men and women, Roberts felt the sting of sexual discrimination. She stated, \\"I can paint as well as any man.\\" Roberts had a studio near Parc Monceau. Initially, she made paintings of animals, at the urging of Lefebvre. While in Paris, she began painting religious themes and figurative works. She exhibited a painting of two widows in a church, Blessed Are They That Weep, at the Palais des Champs Elysees Salon in the spring of 1892 and received an honorable mention, along with New York sculptor Daniel Chester French. Ridgeway Knight (1839-1924), Rodolphe Julian (1839-1907), and Edwin Lord Weeks (1849-1903) sent their congratulations. Philadelphia Evening Telegraph reporter, Lucy H. Hooper, who was in Paris at the time, stated, \\"A singularly powerful piece of work this is to have been created by a girl of twenty. In 1897, she exhibited several religious works at the Paris Salon, the five-paneled The Madonna of St. Mark‚Äôs and The Madonna of the Rose, which were made in Italy. Roberts went to Florence in 1898, where she received an additional two years of study. She studied and copied paintings by Botticelli and learned the techniques of the old masters. Career She had a fast, expressive style like John Singer Sargent and was known for her seascape and landscape paintings. Her works have been sold for more than $44,000. Roberts exhibited her works in the United States and in Paris. She was discouraged, though, that her work was not accepted for exhibition in major galleries, few of her paintings sold, and she was not accepted as a member of Boston's Copley Society. Artist Elizabeth Wentworth Robers, California Landscape, 1920 In 1899 or 1900, she returned to the United States. Roberts worked a full workday painting landscape scenes from Normandy, France or paintings with religious themes in the family's apartment in New York or house in Philadelphia. She exhibited paintings made in Europe at the Pennsylvania Academy, where she won a prize for her landscape painting, and at Lindsay's Gallery in Philadelphia in 1899. She also exhibited The Green Gown, Types of the Black Forest, and My Grandmother's Birthday. Her mother died in 1900. In 1902, Roberts founded the Jennie Sesnan Gold Medal at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, for the best landscape. The Doll and Richards Gallery in Boston exhibited her portrait paintings of Frank B. Sanborn, an educator, and Judge John S. Keyes. Roberts sent her works to galleries and museums in major United States cities. In 1908, the Detroit Institute of Arts held an exhibition of 30 of Robert's seascapes, some of which included playing children and families. Her paintings were exhibited at the Indianapolis Museum of Art in 1908, 1910, and 1914. In 1911, she exhibited at The Plastic Club in Philadelphia. During World War I, Roberts supported the war effort by donating some of her paintings, including those she painted of women gathered to sew clothing at the First Parish Church of Concord. The women were making clothing for refugees who had fled their homes in Belgium to England. A field ambulance was purchased from the $10,000 () she raised. It was used at battles in France. Due to physical examinations, she was unable to join the Red Cross as she desired. Concord Art Association Roberts founded and funded the Concord Art Association in 1917 and for 10 years managed its exhibitions. The purpose of the organization was to promote and encourage art and hold art exhibitions in Concord. She purchased the John Ball House in 1922 and hired architect Lois Howe to renovate the building for its use as the Concord Art Centre, the original name of the organization. The second and third floors of the house built in 1750 were remodeled for gallery space and a great hall. A sky-light was installed to provide natural light for the gallery. The grand opening was held on May 6, 1923, with sixty painters and eighteen sculptors from Europe and the United States in attendance. Among the noted artists were Claude Monet, Robert Henri, Mary Cassatt, and John Singer Sargent. Personal life Elizabeth Wentworth Roberts, Figures on the Sand, Annisquam, 1915 Roberts inherited family residences, including a summer house in Hopkinton, New Hampshire from her mother and a New York City apartment. Grace Keyes, a golfer who in 1900 was the Massachusetts women's golf champion, became Roberts companion. Keyes, who also enjoyed fishing and tennis, became president of the Massachusetts Women's Golf Association. Due to complications following an appendectomy, Keyes retired. The two women began living together in 1900 in a Concord, Massachusetts house that Roberts bought on Estabrook Road. Roberts was welcomed into the Keyes family. She was out of touch with her father. Roberts painted portraits of Judge John S. Keyes and other family members. She had periods of depression and had a reserved demeanor. Roberts was ordered not to work as a result of an illness that required surgery, which left her despondent. In 1926, she was diagnosed with psychoneurosis and admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital. She hung herself on March 12, 1927, the same day her father died, at her home in Concord. Keyes organized Roberts personal life, house, her work schedule, and domestic and international vacations. Aside from New Hampshire, they spent their summers on their houseboat along the New England coast or at their house in Annisquam, Massachusetts, where Roberts painted many of her coastal paintings. Grace was heir to Robert's estate. She died in 1950, at which time Children's Aid Society received the estate. A portrait painted of her in 1925 by Lucy May Stanton is in the Concord Art Association's collection.

It is the percentage of scheduled trains which successfully run their entire planned route, calling at all timetabled stations, and arrive at their terminating station 'on time', where 'on time' means within five minutes of the scheduled destination arrival time for London and South East and regional operators (i.e. commuter services), or within ten minutes for long-distance operators. It is the industry standard measurement of performance, and has been used since 6 June 2000. The target for PPM varies each year and for each train operator, and is agreed with the Office of Rail Regulation. In October 2013 ORR said that, \\"Network Rail should... ensure that 92.5% of trains arrive on time nationally by 2019 (as measured using PPM), compared to 90.7% today.\\" Causes Network Rail delays due to infrastructure faults cause about 39% of delays, train operating companies 28%, weather, trespass, vandalism, cable theft and fatalities 20%, other train operating companies (mostly other passenger trains) 13%. History Prior to PPM's introduction in 2000, there were a variety of punctuality measures. For example, in 1957 Gerry Fiennes published an analysis showing that permanent way restrictions accounted for 25% of delays, locomotives (eg poor steaming due to wrong type of coal for the engine) 25%, signals (mostly due to other delays) 15%, signal failures 10%, coach defects 8%, station duties 4% and miscellaneous (eg. open doors, lamps out, special stops) 13%.Railway Magazine September 1957 p. 597 From 1 April 2019, Network Rail introduced a new 'more detailed and precise set of measures...The official measure of punctuality used up till now, known as the public performance measure (PPM), considers trains to be punctual if they are five or 10 minutes after schedule, for short and long-distance trains are respectively, at their destination. The new measures will report cancellations and the proportion of trains arriving to the minute at every station on the timetable, known as a ‚Äòstation stop‚Äô, where technology allows...' Criticisms * PPM doesn't measure strict punctuality ‚àí whether a train arrived strictly on time ‚àí but has an inbuilt margin for lateness. This means that a train can be 'on time' according to PPM, but still late enough for passengers to miss their connections. It also means there can be, or appear to be, a difference between the rail industry's perception of what is success, and that of passengers. * PPM doesn't reflect passenger experience, as no weight is given to the number of passengers on each train ‚àí a late night service with few passengers on is counted the same as a rush hour service. Therefore, according to PPM, a near-empty train which arrives 6 minutes late is worse than a fully loaded commuter train which arrives 4 minutes late. As busier rush hour trains are more likely to be delayed than off peak trains, PPM scores are likely to be higher than what most passengers experience. * As only the time at the terminating station is recorded, a train could have been late at some of its intermediate stations, affecting passengers alighting at those stops, and this would not be a PPM fail. This is particularly the case for timetables with 'backloading', or 'padding', which is when extra minutes are built into the final leg of the journey as 'catch-up' time. While time at the terminus is important for morning commuter trains into a city, when most passengers alight at the terminus, for inter-city trains, cross-country trains, and evening commuter trains out of a city, it is irrelevant to most passengers, who will alight at different points along the journey. * PPM doesn't measure the quality of the service provided: **It makes no judgement whether customer demand is met by the level of service provision, for example whether departure times match customer journey times, how many people have to stand, or whether people are able to board the first train that departs. **If minutes are added to a timetabled journey due to repeated lateness, then the service will deteriorate, but PPM will improve. **If a different type or size train is run than originally scheduled, then this doesn't count as a PPM fail. Therefore if a train is run with fewer carriages than normal, meaning that some passengers are unable to board who would normally be able to do so, the train can still be a PPM success. * PPM is measured against the planned timetable as agreed between the operator and Network Rail at 22:00 the night before.Network Rail So it is possible for train operators and Network Rail to remove services the day before, for example due to strike action, fail to deliver what the customer is used to expecting, and not fail on PPM.

When mogul Alan Bond took over XXXX, Power's commenced operations in 1988. Castlemaine Perkins changed their terms of credit to hoteliers from one month to one week in late 1985. Power then became determined to brew his own brand (Brews News, 5 Jun 2015). He head hunted a number of young brewers from various brands. Power's sponsored the Brisbane Broncos and Cronulla Sharks NRL teams. By 1991/2 Power's had claimed roughly 14% of Queensland's beer market until being bought out by Foster's Group CUB brewery. In 1992 Power's entered into a joint operation with CUB. As Bernie Power claimed later the brewery was close to closure when CUB stepped in. He sold out to CUB in 1993. The entire length of Yatala Rd was owned by Power's, and the site was approved for brewing. CUB then set about building the largest brewery in the country. The original beers were Power's Bitter, Power's Gold and Power's Dry. The replacement facility now produces all of the CUB beers consumed outside of Victoria.

It was released by Som Livre in September 1998. Released two months after Sasha's birth, the album was totally geared towards that moment of joy that the Children's Queen lived at the time. Although the whole album was thought of in the daughter, Xuxa dedicated more specifically two for its small one: \\"S√≥ Faltava Voc√™\\" and \\"Uma Can√ß√£o Para Sasha\\", of which it participated in the composition. S√≥ Faltava Voc√™ was not as elaborate as the others, due to the pregnancy and the birth of the singer's daughter, which caused the album to \\"flop\\" in some stores of the country until 2003. The tracks most remembered by the public are: \\"Eu t√¥ Feliz\\" and \\"Pelot√£o da Xuxa\\". The album was certified gold record by Associa√ß√£o Brasileira de Produtores de Discos (ABPD). Background and production In 1998, Xuxa Meneghel would realize the dream of being a mother. The singer was preparing for the birth of her daughter and the event in her life, which influenced her career a lot. In addition to changes in Xuxa Park and Planeta Xuxa, the blonde was planning to star in a special Mother's Day night, something that did not happen. In the song, Xuxa had plans to release an album of lullabies, which even got to put voice in some songs, and another more infantile one where it would only sing two tracks and the rest of the disc would be interpreted by invited artists. Projects that were also canceled. From the end of the projects she was planning to release that year, Xuxa and her team began to develop an album around her pregnancy. Several songs were presented to Xuxa talking about what it is to be a mother. The song \\"M√£e\\", \\"Palavrinha M√°gica\\" that came to be performed in Xuxa Park and Planeta Xuxa at that time. Another song recorded for the album, but which was not presented to the public was the re-recording of \\"Le√£ozinho\\" by Brazilian singer Caetano Veloso. Xuxa had already re-recorded the song in a duet with Caetano on his first album Xuxa e Seus Amigos (1985) and decided to record that year, as he had long said that he would have a daughter with a lion sign and would like to sing that song for her. \\"F√©rias no Hawaii (Hulla Hulla)\\" which was originally recorded for the summer season of Planeta Xuxa, which did not materialize, was discarded and included on the album. In July, it was decided the song that would name the project: S√≥ Faltava Voc√™ The composition portrays that despite all the happiness of the work, Xuxa was incomplete until being mother. The photographic essay for the album was performed shortly before Sasha's birth. Xuxa bet on many artificial hair, but in fewer costumes. The photos of the rehearsal were well taken advantage of in the art of the album that had on its back cover and insert, three photos of Xuxa, each with a different artificial hair. The photos were well publicized at the time. After the birth of his daughter, Xuxa and composers Michael Sullivan and Dudu Falc√£o wrote the song \\"Uma Can√ß√£o Para Sasha\\". The singer contributed to the composition by telling the composers everything she felt at that moment. The song was recorded in a studio set up at Xuxa's house, which at that time had already withdrawn from some activities to enjoy his daughter. It was mixed at the beginning of the song, Sasha's first crying during childbirth and a speech of Xuxa quite excited during the recording of the song. \\"Uma Can√ß√£o Para Sasha\\" was included on the album in a hurry, since the album was already finalized until that moment. It was produced by Michael Sullivan and Z√© Henrique, had artistic direction of Aramis Barros and had artistic coordination of Marlene Mattos and Xuxa. It was recorded in the Som Livre studios. Initially, the album would have 20 songs, but the tracklist was reduced to 16. The songs were discarded: \\"M√£e\\", \\"Palavrinha M√°gica\\", which came to be presented in the programs of the singer, \\"Um Mundo Melhor\\", performed in the program social Crian√ßa Esperan√ßa (Child Hope) 1998, \\"O Park J√° Chegou (Chega Mais)\\", performed a few times in Xuxa Park and \\"Vamos Sacudir\\", sometimes performed on Planet Xuxa. Release The album was released in September 1998. while Xuxa presented the special Xuxa 12 Years. The sales were not very good for the time, and the album ran aground in stores, the album is on the list of those that have not been reissued, along with T√¥ de Bem com a Vida (1996), Boas Not√≠cias (1997) and Xuxa 2000 1999). Promotion As for the other records, S√≥ Faltava Voc√™ had little publicity. The songs were little worked on the programs of Xuxa, except for \\"Eu t√¥ Feliz\\" and \\"Adoleta\\". The only ones not performed on TV were \\"Rima 2 (a Malha√ß√£o Continua)\\" and \\"Uma Can√ß√£o Para Sasha\\". As in the previous album, Boas Not√≠cias, the disc's release was incorporated into the program scenarios. At Xuxa Park, from the return of maternity leave, the stage floor was changed to a cover art of the album. In Planeta Xuxa, also after the return of Xuxa, the photo of the cover of the disc happened to serve of floor in the scene. The photos of the bottom panels of the ball in which the blonde made her entrance were also changed to images of the essay for S√≥ Faltava Voc√™, plus a circle with a photo of the rehearsal for the disc that came down from the ceiling after Xuxa left the ball. After the release of the album, the single \\"Uma Can√ß√£o Para Sasha\\" was distributed to the radios all over Brazil. Although it was released as a single, the song has never been performed on the singer's shows or shows. It was planned to tour the album in the first half of 1999, when Xuxa would also record a live album. Due to the recording of the film Requebra, the project was canceled. The only presentations where the S√≥ Faltava Voc√™ songs were part of the setlist were: Santa Claus Arrival on December 20, 1998 in Porto Alegre, the Rio de Janeiro concert for the Christmas Without Hunger campaign also in December 1998, in addition to the presentation for children of INCA (National Cancer Institute) in August 1999 and a closed show for employees of Rede Globo on October 31, 1999. In its dissemination phase, a commercial simpleton was conveyed in Rede Globo's programming. The 10-second commercial brought images of various programs from Xuxa on Globo to the song \\"Eu t√¥ Feliz\\" and \\"Uma Can√ß√£o Para Sasha\\", which may have contributed to the low sales, since the ad implied that it was a collection.

The documentary film had its theatrical premiere in Washington, DC on March 22, 2012 and has screened around the United States at theatres, film festivals, colleges and universities and museums. Produced over six years by the married filmmaking team of Kevin and Tamara Williams, the film takes a non-partisan point-of-view of the American two-party political system and why the Republican Party has so few Black and Urban supporters. Many of the films scenes take place in the Northeast and Southern U.S. and primarily cover the time period of 2004‚Äì2009. Former U.S. Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush figure prominently in the film, but are not the focus of the film. Many political and media figures, including Mitt Romney, Cornel West, Mike Huckabee, Michael Steele, Tavis Smiley, John McCain, Ann Coulter, Newt Gingrich, Grover Norquist, Senator Edward W. Brooke, Christine Todd Whitman, Michelle Malkin, Jim Gilmore, Lynn Swann and Tom Delay are interviewed. The film also features interviews with many non-celebrities and regular citizens/voters who are Democratic, Republican and Independent. While the filmmakers identify themselves as Republicans, the films non- partisan claim is supported by independent reviews from Film critics Kam Williams Syndicated columnist and Sean Edwards as well as many other reviewers across the country. The film also follows a Black Republican female candidate in Atlanta, Georgia named Catherine Davis during her Congressional election run. The film includes a historical timeline explaining much of the history of the Republican Party and includes the founding of the GOP in 1854 until the ‚ÄúParty of Lincoln‚Äù lost the black vote in the 1960s. It also covers the Ku Klux Klan's co-option by the Democratic Party during Reconstruction through the 1960s and the Kennedy-Nixon-Goldwater-Johnson era. Archival footage, some rarely seen, is included in the film and comes from sources as varied as the National Archives and ABCNews.

On sandstone Ockham and Wisley Commons, it was designed in 1860 by the railway architect Frederick Barnes for brewing magnate and MP, Charles Buxton. It is a Grade II* listed building. From 1919 to 1955, it was owned by Alfred Ezra who was President of the Avicultural Society -- he assembled a collection of rare birds and animals on the estate -- in 1939 it housed the last known pink- headed ducks in the world. It was then owned by Hannah Weinstein and chosen for films and television series including The Adventures of Robin Hood. History Charles Buxton, brewer, philanthropist and politician, was also an amateur architect. Having rented a range of properties around the growing village of Weybridge in the 1850s, he purchased the site for Foxwarren Park in 1855. He was heavily involved in the design of the new house, working with Frederick Barnes, known more for his designs for railway stations, particularly in Norfolk. The style is described as \\"harsh Victorian Gothic\\". The house has been suggested as the inspiration for E. H. Shepard's illustrations of Toad Hall in Kenneth Grahame's book, The Wind in the Willows. The claim has also been made for Hardwick House and Mapledurham House in Oxfordshire, and Fawley Court in Buckinghamshire. The house was acquired by Alfred Ezra in 1919, who owned it until his death in 1955. He was an enthusiastic breeder of birds and created a large private collection of rare birds and animals on the estate. From in 1939 the journal Forest and Outdoors praised it as \\"probably the finest (private zoo) in the world\\"; in which state it had been since 1920 and remained so until the following year. It hosted the known last pair of pink-headed ducks. During World War II, the estate hosted research facilities of engineering firm Vickers for Operation Chastise: development of Barnes Wallis's bouncing bomb. Maid Marian, Robin Hood and Little John in The Adventures of Robin Hood which was shot on location here In the 1950s, the house and estate was owned by Hannah Weinstein's Sapphire Films which built a castle in the deer park and used it as the location for the successful TV series, The Adventures of Robin Hood starring Richard Greene. a not dissimilar show, The Adventures of Sir Lancelot, also used it as a location. Weinstein commissioned writers who had been blacklisted in the US as communists and this exile community included Christina Stead, who had a cottage in the grounds. In 1978, the house was used as the main location for the horror movie, The Comeback. Architecture The house is built of red brick, in a polychromatic design, with terracotta dressings and blue diapering. The house is Grade II* listed. The architectural critic Ian Nairn (d.1983) described the Model Farm attached to Foxwarren Park as \\"a true Struwelpeter mid-Victorian nightmare\\". It has a separate Grade II* listing.

It was released by Som Livre in 1999, being the last Xuxa studio album, before the series S√≥ Para Baixinhos. Background and production In February 1999, it was announced that Xuxa would record a live album during their April tour of the same year. Because of the recordings of the film Requebra, neither the album nor the tour came to fruition. In contrast, the Children's Queen, felt the need to make a more childish album. With the cancellation of the live project, they decided to start producing another studio album. At the request of the present host, hundreds of composers sent their songs to the production of Planeta Xuxa until about 20 songs were selected. Just like in S√≥ Faltava Voc√™, Xuxa wanted to make a record more aimed at the children's audience, more specifically, an album for her daughter, as she stated in some interviews of the time. The recording of the album began in late June 1999. The album was produced by Michael Sullivan and Z√© Henrique, had artistic direction of Aramis Barros and artistic coordination Marlene Mattos and Xuxa Meneghel. It was recorded in the Som Livre studios. At the time, much was said about Nostradamus' prophecy about the world ending in 2000 and the coming of the new millennium. Taking a hitch on the subject, were ordered music with these themes and so were recorded: \\"Profecias (Fim do Mundo)\\", 2000 and \\"Aquarius\\" (discarded). In addition to tracks with the biggest subject of the time, Xuxa realized in part his desire to record more infantile songs, which are the majority in this album. The songs aimed at the underdogs on this album were nothing more than a test for the project S√≥ Para Baixinhos, that the blonde would release the following year. Initially First Anniversary would not be a potpourri, it would only count to the first song and a chorus shouting \\"Sasha! Sasha! Sasha!\\". This version even touched on the \\"Primeiro Anivers√°rio\\" of Xuxa's daughter. For the adolescents, \\"Vira, Vira\\" (Planeta Vira, Vira) that served as theme of the Planeta Xuxa program that year, \\"Efeito Domin√≥\\" e \\"S√≥ o Nosso Amor\\" that served as a trail for the film Requebra, besides the theme song of the film, which was discarded and released in the voice of the composer himself, the singer Vinny. One of the bands that stand out is \\"O Bicho Vai Pegar\\", the last partnership of the presenter with the composer Cid Guerreiro, the same of \\"Ilari√™\\". During the song selection phase, the Molejo group composed a song especially for Xuxa. The singer liked \\"Pagoxu\\" so much that she decided to record for the album. Initially, there would be no talk in the introduction of the pagode, but rather you speak of Xuxa herself after the chorus of the song. While recording an edition of Planeta Xuxa on August 15, 1999, Xuxa and Anderson (vocalist of the group) commented on the song after the blonde showed an excerpt of the result of the song. In this conversation, the idea of the vocalist appeared to record some lines to insert in the introduction, as if it were announcing the arrival of Xuxa. In 1999, Xuxa made his return to the cinema with the film Requebra. Two songs were composed for the feature and soon after included in the album: the pop \\"Efeito Domin√≥\\" and the romantic ballad \\"S√≥ o Nosso Amor\\". The art of Xuxa 2000 is one of the most masterful of Xuxa's entire career. The cover, back cover and the label bring the concept of the end of the world. The photos of the rehearsal for the Spanish album El Mundo √©s de los Dos, which was released that same year, were reused. The inside of the booklet simulated a notebook with many drawings, pencils and photos of the essay done for the album. One of the highlights of the art was a holographic seal with the signature and the Xuxa kissing marque that was glued to the packaging. Release Xuxa 2000 was released in the second half of 1999, the album only had two runs, totaling 100,000 copies sold. The cover and the back cover have a holographic effect, the first print also came with a holographic tag with a kiss marquinha and the signature of Xuxa, he is in the list of those that have not been re-released, among this list are T√¥ de Bem com a Vida (1996), Boas Not√≠cias (1997) and S√≥ Faltava Voc√™ (1998). Promotion Since March 1999, the song \\"Vira, Vira (Planeta Vira, Vira)\\" was already performed in the Planeta Xuxa program. However, the release of the album only really began in August when Xuxa started to present other songs from the album on the show, as well as performing at Xuxa Park. All the songs were performed on TV, except \\"Rap da Xuxa\\". In October 1999, the program Xuxa Park begins its new season and begins to have as theme of opening the music \\"Profecias (Fim do Mundo)\\". Already in the first program, Xuxa started a contest where a group of boys and girls should learn the choreography of Dancing the Country, the group that had the best performance would win a bicycle for each member. The promotion was released in a few editions of the Park and soon canceled. In the same month, the Queen of Children performed \\"Profecias\\" in the show of the campaign Crian√ßa Esperan√ßa (Child Hope). Only two songs from Xuxa 2000 have won clips in their release phase. From December 1999, the music video \\"Profecias (Fim do Mundo)\\", began to serve as the opening theme of the novel Vila Madalena. In the same month, the music 2000 had its video shown in the Show of Turned on the 31 of December. Taking a ride on Xuxa's return to the movies, the songs \\"Efeito Domin√≥\\" and Only Our Love were included in the soundtrack of the film Requebra. The blonde even gave interviews to some radios promoting the album and her most recent feature. In November 1999, the blonde arrived to participate in the program Show of Ant√¥nio Carlos of Radio Globo. The 2000 tour was scheduled for October 1999, including the custom bus that would transport Xuxa and his team was ready, but for unknown reasons the project was canceled. Xuxa only presented songs from this album in a show for children of INCA (Instituto Nacional do C√¢ncer), in Rio de Janeiro on August 21, 1999 and in a closed presentation for Rede Globo employees, held at the Globo studios (Rio de Janeiro) on 31 of October of that year. Curiously, the scene of this show was basically the same as the Xuxa 92 tour, but Xuxa was coming down from the white ship used in the last season of Xou da Xuxa. To date, no video record has been found of these shows, just photos. As part of the disclosure, Xuxa would appear in the program Doming√£o do Faust√£o on December 12, 1999, but due to a subacute thyroiditis was forced to cancel. Participation in Santa's Arrival in Maracan√£, Rio de Janeiro was also canceled and Xuxa was replaced by Eliana.

Life Lightfoot was born on 17 April 1936 on South Uist to a family rich in pipers, and her first music lessons came from her parents, before she was taught by her uncle Angus Campbell. Teaching was in Canntaireachd, a way of notating pibroch orally. She attended secondary school in Fort William, before going to Glasgow to train as a nurse. She met her husband Tony whilst in Glasgow, and they married in October 1960. Tony worked as a sailor and Rona often travelled with him, taking her pipes with her. Career Lightfoot had a successful career as solo piper, and credited as the first woman to win a major piping competition. In 1972, she won third place in the jig competition at the Northern Meeting, but was not allowed to compete in the march competition due to the way she was dressed. She became the first woman to compete in the Bratach Gorm after applying pressure to the Scottish Piping Society of London, quoting the Sex Discrimination Act. She was only allowed to compete once. Lightfoot is regarded as one of the best players never to have won a Gold Medal. She plays with her drones over her right shoulder, and her left hand on the bottom, the opposite arrangement to most players. She later became the President of the Inverness Piping Society, the first (and only, to date) woman to do so. Since retiring from competitive piping, she has judged and taught, and in 2010 she won the Balvenie Medal for services to piping. In 2019, she was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Scottish Gaelic Awards. Recordings In 2004 she recorded Eadarainn, which involved both singing and piping. Lightfoot also featured in Br√¨ghde Chaimbeul's debut album The Reeling, released in 2019. Chaimbeul was initially inspired to learn the pipes at the age of four when she heard Lightfoot playing.

By the early 1900s, he had developed yogic powers such as the materalization of objects and scents, and became socially popular for his feats. His encounter with Paramhansa Yogananda, during the latter's youth, is detailed in Yogananda's autobiography.

The Moderates were never a formal party, but only a movement of liberal-minded reformist patriots, usually secular, from politics, military, literature and philosophy. History Since the Congress of Vienna, inside the Italian Peninsula was diffused a reformist and Romantic moment, inspired from Jacobonism and Bonapartism and explosed in the revolutions of 1820 against the reactionary Congress System. Many patriots, soldiers and intellectuals who took part to the revolutions were definited \\"moderates\\". The Moderates, with time, demarcated themselves from radical and republican organizations like Giuseppe Mazzini's Young Italy, Carboneria and others. The moderates and radicals disputed mainly for the methods to unified Italy: the Moderates supported secret pacts and strategic alliances between the patriotic movement and the other European powers, whereas the Mazzini's supporters called a popular revolution to establish a democratic Republic. After the failure of the Italian Revolutions of 1848, attempted by Mazzinians and republicans, the republican ideas declined for the Moderates' agenda. During this time, several politicians of other Italian states are members of the group: in the Kingdom of Sardinia, the leaders were Massimo d'Azeglio and Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, representing the parliamentary Right, and Urbano Rattazzi, representing the Left; in the Papal States the reform movement was headed by Terenzio della Rovere and Pellegrino Rossi, the last murdered by a republican plot in 1848; in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies prominent moderates were brothers Bertrando and Silvio Spaventa. When the Kingdom of Italy was founded in 1861, the moderates merged in the Historical Right and Left, the two Piedmontese parliamentary group that monopolized the politics of the new Italian state for almost half-century. Tendencies and members Differently by democrats and radical republicans, the Moderates were only circles of intellectuals, aristocrats, soldiers and businessmen with patriotic tendencies. However, the Moderate Party wasn't cohesive, because its members were of different political ideologies, from continental liberalism to soft conservatism. Initially, the party wasn't too nationalist, preferring a federation or coalition between the several Italian states, and support both reformist and law and order policies, different by the republicans like Mazzini. When the possibility of an unified Italian state became real, a new question of division was the form that the new Italian State would have. Someone, like Vincenzo Gioberti, supported a confederation of states, led by the Pope. other simply claimed for a centralized state headed by a monarch, without differences if a Savoy or other. There were three main tendencies inside the movement: Neo-Guelphs: * Vincenzo Gioberti * Carlo Troya * Alessandro Manzoni * Terenzio della Rovere * Pellegrino Rossi * Antonio Rosmini-Serbati * Gino Capponi * Carlo Matteucci * Luigi Tosti Neutral: * Gabrio Casati * Cesare Alfieri di Sostegno * Massimo d'Azeglio * Luigi Settembrini * Carlo Zucchi * Ruggero Settimo * Carlo Filangieri Neo-Ghibellines: * Cesare Balbo (switched side) * Carlo Cattaneo (left for Action Party) * Santorre de Rossi, Count of Santarosa * Francesco Domenico Guerrazzi * Giovanni Battista Niccolini * Gabriele Rossetti * Florestano Pepe * Guglielmo Pepe References See also * Liberalism and radicalism in Italy Category:Liberal parties in Italy Category:Italian unification Category:Kingdom of Sardinia Category:Defunct political parties in Italy Category:1848 establishments in Italy Category:Political parties established in 1848 Category:1861 disestablishments in Italy Category:Defunct liberal political parties ","title":"Moderate Party (Italy)"},{"id":"45669431","text":"Isabelle Michel is a Swiss former racing cyclist.

P. de la Rep√∫blica, 1999 was a mixed brigade of the Spanish Republican Army in the Spanish Civil War. It was formed in the spring of 1938 in Catalonia and had four battalions, the 905, 906, 907 and 908. History The 227th Mixed Brigade was established on 22 April 1938 and placed under the 42nd Division of the XV Army Corps, at the time part of the Agrupaci√≥n Aut√≥noma del Ebro (A.A.E.). The command of the unit was assigned to Militia Lieutenant Tom√°s Guerrero Ortega. The Chief of Staff leader was Tom√°s S√°nchez Lorda and the political commissar was Lorenzo Arcones Grande. Battle of the Ebro On 25 July 1938 the 227th Mixed Brigade was camped in Almatret and the following day it crossed the Ebro River as part of one of the operations that marked the beginning of the Battle of the Ebro. Its main efforts were directed at recapturing Fay√≥n from the rebel faction, but it was not able to achieve is aim. After lingering for two weeks in the bridgehead area it reached the Auts on 5 August, having to cross back the Ebro on 7 August. Since it had suffered grievous losses, the 227th Mixed Brigade was moved to La Pobla de Massaluca in order to be reorganized and on 14 September it crossed the Ebro again in order to relieve the forces of the 3rd Division in the Vilalba-Corbera-V√©rtice Gaeta triangle.Vertex Gaeta On 22 September it replaced units of the 45th Division in the Coll del Coso sector, where it remained until it was replaced by the 44th Division on 6 October. Owing to the steady and relentless advances of the rebels the brigade returned to first-line combat, defending Miravet on 4 November while initiating the withdrawal along the right bank of the Ebro. It arrived to Benissanet on 5 November and camped at Mount Picossa by M√≥ra d'Ebre on 7 November. Finally it reached Asc√≥ on 12 November where, after a great number of casualties, it had to abandon the bridgehead. Catalonia Offensive and extinction of the brigade At the beginning of the Catalonia Offensive the 227th Mixed Brigade was in La Granadella, under the command of Major Bermejo and commissar Modesto Castrillo, for Major Guerrero was missing in action. On 5 January the brigade was in full withdrawal, marching northeastwards to Vinaixa, where it tried unsuccessfully to defend its road junctions. While the rebels advanced in full force, attacking the retreating Republican troops, the 227th Mixed Brigade continued withdrawing across the Serra de Prades, L'Espluga de Francol√≠, Alcover and La Selva. After reaching the Gai√† River line, the brigade continued fleeing before the enemy advance. It reached the Tibidabo mountain shortly before the Fall of Barcelona on 25 January. By then the 227th Mixed Brigade had been reduced to a handful of ill-equipped, hungry and demoralized volunteers. Nevertheless, they continued to fight while slowly withdrawing northwards, until they reached the border town of Portbou and crossed the mountains into France on 9 February.

He died in exile in Moscow at the age of about forty. Early years Joseph Tommasi was born in 1886. He worked as a bicycle courier, a carpenter and then a mechanic. He joined the Socialist Party of France in 1904. Tommasi became a union activist, and during World War I (1914‚Äì18) supported the left wing of the CGT. Tommasi became secretary of the Car and Aviation Workers Federation, and secretary of the GGT in 1919. In 1919 he was a member of the CGT administrative committee. At the CGT's first postwar congress, held in Lyon from 15-21 September 1919, Tommasi was among the leaders of the minority, with Pierre Monatte, Raymond P√©ricat and Gaston Monmousseau. This group denounced the CGT membership in the Amsterdam International of Labor Unions, said the CGT majority had broken with the principles of syndicalism and lost faith in revolution by dealing with the government. The minority wanted the CGT to join the Communist International. Communist When the French Communist Party (PCF: Parti Communiste Fran√ßais) was formed in December 1920 Tommasi was 34 years old and was working in the aviation industry. From 1921 to 1922 he was a member of the Communist Party executive committee. He was also a member of the political bureau of the party, and for a while was acting secretary-general. He was a delegate to the Third Congress of the Communist International in Moscow in June‚ÄìJuly 1921, where he supported the Left current. At the request of Stepanov, Tommasi organized an intelligence network in France. Tommasi attended the congress in Saint-√âtienne on 25 June ‚Äì 1 July 1922 at which the syndicates, unions and federations that had been excluded from the CGT founded the Conf√©d√©ration g√©n√©rale du travail unitaire (CGTU). The dynamic new organization was attached to peace and to the anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggle. The French police forced Tommasi into exile in 1924. He moved to Moscow, where he joined the Left Opposition led by Leon Trotsky. Joseph Tommasi died in 1926.

A mountain sport or Alpine sport is one of several types of sport that take place in hilly or mountainous terrain. All these sports require special equipment, carry a higher level of risk and require specialised training before they can be undertaken safely. Because mountain sportsmen deliberately go into terrain that is not easily accessible where there are higher risks ‚Äì dangers such as avalanches, bad weather, mudflows, rockfalls and icefalls - special measures must be taken to mitigate these risks. This is generally known as risk management. Mountain sports include the following:Bergsport f√ºr alle ...Seien Sie aktiv.

Mountain sport tourism  Many mountain schools offer the various mountain sports as guided tours. These enable beginners to try out the various activities under supervision. The leaders of these tours know the likely risks on their tour routes and accompany the party. Some of these tours are targeted at specific groups, such as guided Alpine crossings for beginners, intermediates, older people or singles.Patrick Merhi: Erfahrungsbericht einer Alpen√ºberquerung. Report dated 26 August 2013. Online at guiders.de, retrieved 1 September 2013. These tours have adapted to the changes in travel behaviour of tourists observed in recent years. For example, studies by the University of Berne have found that travellers expect increasingly individualized and flexible travel deals. They are mainly looking for deals that provide varied and intense experiences.Hansruedi M√ºller: Der Alpentourismus vor gro√üen Herausforderungen (PDF, 26 kB). Online at fif.unibe.ch, retrieved 1 September 2013.  Mountain sports and conservation  Because mountain sports usually take place in area of relatively unspoilt nature, it is important that participants ensure their activities are carried out in a sustainable and environmentally-friendly way. For this reason guidelines have been prepared by the various mountaineering and alpine clubs. These say, for example, that plants may be photographed but not picked.Naturvertr√§glich unterwegs. Ma√ünahmen zum Naturschutz im Bergsport. Online at alpenverein.de, retrieved 1 September 2013. In addition to these measures the Alpine countries and the EU have agreed a framework programme for pan-Alpine policy. The agreement is also known as the Alpine Convention and, in addition to conservation, also covers planning, sustainable development, mountain farming, countryside conservation, mountain forests, tourism, soil protection, energy and transport.Alpenkonvention .

The scope weighs 2.1 kg and measures 276 mm √ó 210 mm √ó 140 mm (length √ó height √ó width). It is attached onto a matching side rail on the weapon after which a lever on the scope is pressed to hold it in place. The 1PN51 comes in a metal container with room for extra batteries, battery charger and the other accessories, weighing 6.45 kg in total. Optics The scope gathers light via an 80 mm aperture into a reflector with the secondary mirror obscuring the central 42 mm of the aperture. For zeroing the sight the top of the scope has two perpendicular knobs, of which the elevation knob has a detachable scale. The scope comes with eight different, detachable elevation scales for the supported weapons. The aperture cover itself has two 12 mm apertures that can be opened partially allowing the scope to be used in light conditions that would otherwise saturate the light intensifier. The rear end of the scope is a focus dial. The eyepiece has a detachable soft rubber eyecup. The scope has a magnification of 3.46. Light Intensifier and Reticle On the left below the aperture the device has a brightness knob. Apart from powering on and off the device, this knob controls the brightness of the reticle allowing for the reticle to be visible without outshining the target. The reticle has markings that match targets of various heights from 0.3 m to 2.7 m at distances ranging from 100 m to 970 m. This is similar to the reticle of the 1PN58. Power The light intensifier is powered by a pack of 5 D-0,55S () rechargeable cells, providing up to 7 V. The scope requires 6.25 V. The maximum current drawn is 40 mA. The D-0,55S battery pack is used by a range of devices including 1PN51-2 and 1PN58 and has a separate charging device. The charging device has a switch to select one of 12 V or 27 V input and two red control lamps, one to indicate that power is available and one to indicate that charging is complete. Supported Weapons As of 1992 the 1PN51 can be used with the following weapons (weapons on the same line share the elevation scale): SVDN-1, AK-74N (AKS-74N), PKMN-1 (PKMSN-1), RPG-7N1 (RPG-7DN1), AKMN-1 (AKMSN-1), RPK-74N (RPKS-74N), AKS-74UN (no elevation scale), RPKN-1 (RPKSN-1), VSS Vintorez, AS Val, AK-103N2 (AK-103N2).

After showing useful form in his early career, winning two National Hunt Flat races and a novice hurdle, he improved through the handicap ranks in the 1997/1998 National Hunt season before recording an upset win in the Stayers' Hurdle. He looked better than ever in the following year, winning the Long Distance Hurdle and the Long Walk Hurdle, but was brought down and badly injured in his first and only appearance in a steeplechase. He never recovered his best form thereafter and was retired from racing in 2002 with a record of seven wins and three places from eighteen races. Background Princeful was a bay gelding with a narrow white blaze and two white socks bred in Ireland by J S Bellingham. He was the most successful racehorse sired by Electric a high- class middle-distance runner whose wins included the Gordon Stakes, Great Voltigeur Stakes and Jockey Club Stakes. As a son of Blakeney, Electric was a representatives of the Byerley Turk sire line, unlike more than 95% of modern thoroughbreds, who descend directly from the Darley Arabian. Princeful's dam Iram was an unraced daughter of the dual Goodwood Cup winner Proverb, and a descendant of the broodmare Review, who produced the 1000 Guineas winners Pourparler and Fleet. As a four-year-old gelding in May 1995, Princeful was sent to the Doncaster Bloodstock Sales where he was sold to a cash bid of 13,000 guineas. He entered the ownership of Robert and Elizabeth Hitchins and was sent into training with Jenny Pitman at Upper Lambourn in Berkshire. Racing career Early career: National Hunt flat races and novice hurdles Princeful began his racing career as a five-year-old in a National Hunt Flat race at Worcester Racecourse on 22 May 1996. He started the 9/2 joint-favourite and won by twelve lengths from the mare Quick Bowler. After a break of more than seven months he returned for a similar event at Towcester Racecourse and led for most of the way before winning by two and a half lengths from Billingsgate. In January 1997, the gelding was switched to compete in novice hurdle races, making his debut over obstacles when finishing fifth behind Red Blazer at Leicester. He recorded his first victory over jumps in February, winning by three-quarters of a length from John Drumm at Chepstow Racecourse. In March 1997, Princeful made his first appearance at the Cheltenham Festival where he started a 25/1 outsider for the Supreme Novices' Hurdle. He was restrained in the early stages by his jockey Rodney Farrant before making steady progress in the closing stages to finish second of the sixteen runners behind Shadow Leader. He was then sent to Ireland for the Jameson Gold Cup Novice Hurdle at Fairyhouse but was pulled up in a race on by the 33/1 outsider Gazalani. 1997/1998 National Hunt season: hurdle races Princeful began to compete against more experienced hurdlers in the 1997/1998 National Hunt season, beginning his campaign when finishing second under top weight of 164 pounds in a two-mile handicap at Ascot Racecourse in November. Two weeks later he finished fourth of twenty-one starters behind Major Jamie in the valuable William Hill Handicap Hurdle at Sandown Park Racecourse, again over two miles. On New Year's Day 1998, the gelding was moved up in distance for a handicap over two miles, five and a half furlongs at Cheltenham. Carrying 140 pounds, he won by eight lengths from Moorish, Karshi (winner of the 1997 Stayers' Hurdle) and Go Ballistic. He continued to compete in handicaps, finishing second to Splendid Thyne at Warwick Racecourse on 17 January and fourth behind Buckhouse Boy in the Sandown Handicap Hurdle in February. On 19 March 1998, Princeful returned to the Cheltenham Festival and started a 16/1 outsider for the twenty-seventh running of the Stayers' Hurdle over three miles. Splendid Thyne and Buckhouse Boy were again in opposition, but the 6/4 favourite was Paddy's Return, whose wins included the Triumph Hurdle, World Series Hurdle and Long Walk Hurdle. The other contenders included Commanche Court and Ocean Hawk (1996 Long Walk Hurdle). Farrant restrained the gelding in the early stages as the Martin Pipe-trained Gysart set the pace from Ocean Hawk and Splendid Thyne. Princeful began to make progress from half way and overtook Splendid Thyne to take the lead approaching the final flight of hurdles. Princeful stayed on strongly on the run-in and won by two lengths from Splendid Thyne, with four lengths back to Ocean Hawk in third. 1998/1999 National Hunt season On his return in November, Princeful started 6/1 third favourite behind the West Yorkshire Hurdle winner Marello and the Nigel Twiston-Davies-trained The Proms in the Long Distance Hurdle at Newbury. Ridden by Richard Dunwoody, he was under pressure two hurdles from the finish, but stayed on to overtake Shooting Light on the run-in and won by two and a half lengths. Dunwoody kept the ride when Princeful started 11/4 favourite for the Grade 1 Long Walk Hurdle at Ascot on 19 December. Paddy's Return, Ocean Hawk and Shooting Light were again in opposition as well as the 1996 Stayers' Hurdle winner Cyborgo and the Martin Pipe-trained Deano's Beeno who had won his last three races. Deano's Beeno took the lead and opened up a clear advantage, but Princeful made steady progress and took the lead in the closing stages to win by half a length with a gap of thirty lengths back to Ocean Hawk in third. After the race Pitman embraced the winner, whilst Dunwoody said \\"I think that was as tough a performance as I can recall from any horse\\". Pitman announced that the gelding would be aimed at the RSA Chase at the Cheltemham Festival with the 2000 Gold Cup as the long-term objective. In January Princeful made his debut over fences and started odds-on favourite for a novice chase over three miles at Doncaster Racecourse. He appeared to be going well in fourth when he was hampered and brought down when Optimism Reigns fell at the twelfth fence. The race was won by the future Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Looks Like Trouble. It was at first believed that Princeful's injuries amounted to nothing more than a \\"sprain\\", but an X-ray examination revealed that the gelding had fractured a pedal bone in his left hind leg. Pitman admitted that she was no more than \\"hopeful\\" that he would ever race again. Later career Princeful remained in training for three more seasons but made few appearances and never recovered his best form. In January 2000, Hitchins removed several of his horses from Pitman's (Mrs P had already retired at this point ‚Äì needs correction) yard and sent them to be trained by Mandy Bowlby. In two races that year, Princeful finished sixth behind Teaatral in Grade 2 hurdle at Ascot in April and was pulled up in the Champion Stayers Hurdle at Punchestown in May. By 2002, he was being trained in Somerset by Ron Hodges. He made his final appearance that year, finishing sixth of seven behind It Takes Time when a 33/1 outsider for a race at Sandown.

Euphron was a citizen of Sicyon, who held the chief power during the period of its subjection to Sparta. In 368 BC the city was compelled by Epaminondas to join the Theban alliance, and though its constitution appears to have remained unchanged, the influence of Euphron was considerably diminished. In order to regain it, he took advantage of the dissatisfaction of the Arcadians and Argives with the oligarchical line of Epaminondas, and representing to them that the supremacy of Lacedaemon would surely be restored in Sicyon if matters continued as they were, he succeeded in establishing democracy. In the election of generals which followed, he himself was chosen, with four colleagues. He then procured the appointment of his own son, Adeas, to the command of the mercenary troops in the service of the republic and he further attached these to his cause by an unsparing use, not only of the public money and the sacred treasures, but of the wealth also of many whom he drove into banishment on the charge of Laconism. His next step was to rid himself of his colleagues and having effected this by the exile of some and the murder of the rest, he became tyrant of Sicyon. He was not, however, entirely independent, for the citadel was occupied by a Theban harmost, sent there, as it would seem, after the democratic revolution. We find Euphron co- operating with that officer in a campaign against Phlius, probably in 365 BC. Not long after this, oligarchy was again established in Sicyon, by Aeneas of Stymphalus, the Arcadian general, and apparently with the concurrence of the Theban harmost. Euphron upon this fled to the harbour, and, having sent to Corinth for the Spartan commander Pasimelus, delivered it up to him, making many professions at the same time of having been influenced in all he had done by attachment to the interests of Lacedaemon, to which however little credit seems to have been given. Meanwhile party-strife still continued at Sicyon, and so he was enabled, by help from Athens, to regain possession of the city. But he was aware that he could not hold it in the face of opposition from the Theban garrison (to say nothing of his having now decisively incurred the enmity of Sparta), and he therefore betook himself to Thebes, hoping to obtain, by corruption and intrigue, the banishment of his opponents and the restoration of his own power. Some of his enemies, however, followed him thither, and when they found that he was indeed advancing towards the attainment of his object, they murdered him in the Cadmea, while the council was actually assembled there. Being arrested and brought before the council, they pleaded their cause boldly, justified their deed, and were acquitted. But Euphron's partisans were numerous at Sicyon, and having brought home his body, they buried it in the Agora, an unusual honour (cfr. Plutarch, Aratus 53) and paid worship to him as a hero and a founder. Xenophon, Hellenica VII 1-3; Diodorus Siculus XV 69,70. In 323 BC Euphron the Younger, son of Adeas and grandson of the tyrant Euphron, reintroduced democracy in Sicyon, but was soon conquered by the Macedonians.

Ri≈°pet also co-organized Split Pride. The purpose of Ri≈°pet is to deal with problems of violence towards LGBT persons, to empower and educate the community, thereby making it more sensible to LGBT problematics. Ri≈°pet also organized various formal and informal activities for the local LGBT community, including film screenings, thematic workshops, exhibitions, public forums, Pride marches, festivals and conferences in Croatia and the region. Past achievements of Ri≈°pet are based on a large volunteer potential of the local LGBT community. Given that those accomplishments are achieved only thanks to the volunteers and collaboration with other NGOs, without any financial resources. Ri≈°pet educated volunteers about the position of LGBT people in Croatia, as well as on methods and possibilities of their participation in the struggle for realization of the rights for a decent life, free of violence and discrimination. It wants to encourage them to think critically questioning the patriarchy, heteronormativity and the generally process of re- traditionalization and models that inhibit the development of democratic processes based on the principles of equality, justice and freedom.

Christina Stone played a ballet dancer and the lead role was played by Jeffrey Hunter.Remembering Singapore \\"Strange Portrait\\" Hunter played the role of Mark, an expat American and petty thief in Hong Kong who lives with his Chinese girlfriend played by Barbara Lee. One day while watching a soccer game, a mansion catches his eye and he breaks into it. Whilst inside, he notices a portrait there that looks just like him. The only person living in the mansion is a wealthy but mad woman played by Mai Tai Sing. He finds out that the painting that looks like him is actually that of her husband who deserted her years before. He also discovers that she has an abundance of jewelry and decided to woo her and pretend that he is her departed husband. While gaining access to the woman's treasure he makes a startling and macabre discovery and thus has a tragic end. Cast and crew Jason Evers was the original choice for the lead role. He had to vacate the role in favor of a television pilot, Three for Danger, thus the role was filled by Jeffrey Hunter even though his agent wasn't keen on the idea. It was reported in the Milwaukee Sentinel that Jeffrey Hunter was to wed Mai Tai Sing, a business woman who was a cast member.

Her novels, based on her adventures, did not have much success, except for Les enchantements de Prudence, Avec George Sand (\\"The Enchantment of Prudence, with George Sand\\") (1873), which had a succ√®s de scandale. Early years and education Allart was born in Milan in 1801. Her French father was Nicolas-Jean-Gabriel Allart and her French mother was the writer Marie-Fran√ßoise Gay who had translated the works of the English gothic author Ann Radcliffe. Her maternal aunt was the writer Sophie Gay and her cousin was Delphine de Girardin. In 1817, her father died. She had received what was considered to be a good education. Career Allart was an enthusiastic supporter of the vanquished Napoleon and in 1819 she wrote to Henri Gatien Bertrand and volunteered to travel to Saint Helena to nurse the ex-emperor who was ill. Bertrand later offered her a job as a governess and commented that he thought that Napoleon would have fallen in love with her if she had been successful in travelling to be his nurse. Napoleon and her mother died, leaving her an orphan at the age of 20. For some two years she worked as a governess in the household of General Bertrand, where she met the Comte de Sampayo, a Portuguese gentleman. She became his mistress, and in 1826 gave birth to his son, Marcus. Sampayo abandoned her before she gave birth. Allart's first work was published in 1821. At this time she was living with the Countess Regnault de Saint-Jean d'Angely, who became a close friend when she confessed to also wanting to go and tend to the ailing Napoleon. The Countess introduced Allart to two suitors: the economist Hippolyte Passy and the poet Pierre-Jean de B√©ranger. Beranger and Passy were to be life-long friends. Allart traveled to Florence, where, after a time, she appears to have had an affair with Gino Capponi, who had been interested in a book entitled La Conjuration d'Amboise, which she had published when she was 21. Another early work of hers was a volume of Letters to George Sand, with whose moral and religious principles she much sympathised, and who, later on, pronounced her to be 'one of the glories of her sex'. Allart was a lifelong lover of George Sand, but they had an open relationship. In 1829, Allart was in Rome on a visit to her sister. There, she met Fran√ßois-Ren√© de Chateaubriand and they became lovers. Within a few weeks, he proceeded to Paris, and Allart followed him there, taking an apartment in the Rue d‚ÄôEnfer. In England, she met Henry Bulwer Lytton, afterwards Lord Dalling, and they became lovers, which Allart told Chateaubrian on her return, under notions of probity, and being faithful in her temporary unions.Knowles (1911), p. 1069 In 1843, she married the French aristocrat Napol√©on Louis Fr√©d√©ric Corneille de M√©ritens de Malv√©zie but she left him the following year. Allart, a notable figure in Paris' intellectual circles, lived several miles outside Paris with her books which she called her \\"true lovers\\". She did not recommend that women should abandon men, in fact in her novel Settimia her heroine enjoys her male lovers but is not defined by them but by her lack of interdependence, her intellectual maturity and her children. This was the life that Allart lived, surviving without having to rely on a supportive family. She argued that women needed political reform of their lot and if this meant that women needed to abandon the two-parent family then this would be acceptable. Allart foresaw a world where society was not democratic or organised by men, but a meritocratic society run by women and men of higher abilities than the general population. She professed herself a Protestant, and had a kind of religiosity, however hazy; Allart was loyal, generous and true to her lovers, who usually became her friends. A single mother of two sons, Allart wrote that her sons were not accidents and this was the life she had chosen. Allart recorded her adventures in her books, veiling them only slightly as fiction.Knowles (1911), p. 1070 Her novel Jerome (1829), for example, is a thinly disguised account of her experiences with Sampayo, whom she portrayed in the book as a celibate Roman prelate. With the exception of Les enchantements de Prudence, Avec George Sand (1873), which had a succ√®s de scandale, none of her novels had much success. Allart died in Montlh√©ry in 1879 and is buried in the cemetery at Bourg-la- Reine.

Together, Heber and Mary had eight children: * Mary Cunningham Bishop (1864‚Äì1948), who died unmarried. * Elizabeth Templeton Bishop (1865‚Äì1934), who married James Low Harriman (1856‚Äì1928), eldest son of Oliver Harriman * Harriet Arnold Bishop (1866-1931), who married James Franklin Doughty Lanier (1858‚Äì1928), grandson of James Lanier. * Heber Reginald Bishop Jr. (1868‚Äì1923), who married Mabel Wolverton Sard (1871‚Äì1923), who was previously married to Arthur Amory Jr. (1867‚Äì1898) * James Cunningham Bishop (1870‚Äì1932), who married Abigail Adams Hancock (1872‚Äì1949), niece of Winfield Scott Hancock, and had five daughters. * Francis Cunningham Bishop (1872‚Äì1927), who married Gertrude Sophia Pell (d. 1953) in 1906, and had three sons. * Edith Bishop (1874‚Äì1959), who married Moses Taylor V (1871‚Äì1928), grandson of Moses Taylor, in 1896. After his death, she married George James Guthrie Nicholson (1871‚Äì1950). * Ogden Mills Bishop (1878‚Äì1955) Bishop died on December 10, 1902 at his residence, 881 Fifth Avenue, after a long illness. Bishop, his wife, and several of their children are interred in the Bishop mausoleum at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, Sleepy Hollow, NY. It sits next to the Cunningham mausoleum erected by his wife's father, and a short distance from the Darius Ogden Mills and Whitelaw Reid mausoleums. His estate, valued at approximately $3,500,000, was left in trust for his widow, children, sisters, and brother. He left funds to the Metropolitan Museum for the preservation of his collection. By 1915, his estate's holdings in Standard Oil had increased in value by $1,450,000. Society life Mary's brother-in-law, Darius Ogden Mills, was instrumental in introducing the Bishops to elite New York business and society circles. For example, Heber and his children Mary, Harriet, and Ogden were members of Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\" list, reportedly the number of people who could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. His daughter Harriet's home, the James F. D. Lanier Residence, is a New York landmark. His daughter Edith and her husband owned many residences, including Annandale Farm in Mt. Kisco, NY, Glen Farm in Portsmouth, RI, and the Villa Taylor in Marrakesh, Morocco, where Winston Churchill and Franklin Delano Roosevelt \\"played hookey\\" during World War II. The Taylors would cruise to Morocco aboard their 310-foot steam yacht \\"Iolanda\\". In 1898, Bishop and his wife gave a red domino dance for 150 at their residence in New York. An 1895 watercolor on ivory portrait of the four daughters is held by the New York Historical Society. He was a member of the Metropolitan Club, the Union Club, the Union League Club, the New York Yacht Club, the City Club, the Turf and Field Club, the Century Association, the New England Society, the Mendelssohn Glee Club, the Chicago Club of Chicago, the Golf Club of Newport, the Turf Club of Newport, the American Hackney Horse Society of New York, the Boone and Crockett Club and the Civil Service Reform Association. In 1899, Bishop rented Houghton Hall in England, where he hosted the Prince of Wales for a weekend of hunting. References ;Notes ;Sources * American Art Association. 1919.

The VP designation in the name refers to Volkspistole, which translates to \\"people's pistol\\", while SFP stands for \\"striker-fired pistol\\". The 9 stands for the caliber designation of 9 mm. The VP9 is the third striker-fired pistol that HK has produced. A variant of the VP9, the VP40, is chambered for .40 S&W; the VP40 is known as SFP40 in Europe and Canada. History A disassembled HK-SFP9 LSH According to the manufacturer, Heckler & Koch (HK), the pistol was under development for more than four years before its release in June 2014. Originally, it was designed on request of the Bavarian State Police, to replace the HK P7. As HK has a long history with striker-fired pistols, they decided to update their lineup with a newly designed striker system that gives their pistols a single stage-like trigger feel with a clean break. Design details The VP9 is a striker-fired pistol that features a Picatinny rail, ambidextrous controls, a hammer forged polygonal barrel, and changeable back and side straps to make the pistol grip customizable for any shooter's hand with 27 options of grip configuration. It was in development for more than four years and is Heckler & Koch's first striker-fired handgun since the P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s. The pistols are made in Heckler & Koch's Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. Most striker-fired handguns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as the shooter squeezes it rearward. The VP9 trigger has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The average weight of the stock trigger pull is . The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull followed by a positive set with clean break. Disassembly does not involve releasing the striker by squeezing the trigger. Both the VP9 and VP40 use Heckler & Koch's ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels that allow the pistol's to fit any and all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol's grip also instinctively position the shooters hand for optimal shooting. Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has a few innovations of its own. The controls are completely ambidextrous. A slide release is present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A new feature is HK's patented charging supports. They are simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols use the same steel magazines as the Heckler & Koch P30 in both the 15 and 10-round capacity configurations. The VP9 has an extended full size Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle the heavier mounted accessories because of its full size which adds rigidity. This rigidity gives the VP9 superior capabilities compared to some of its polymer competitors whose frames flex under use and cannot handle the weight of some of the medium to larger mounted lights. In United States, the VP9 is available from retailers as a standard package (standard three-dot sights and two magazines included) or as a \\"LE\\" (Law Enforcement) package (factory-equipped tritium night sights and three magazines included). The night sights are Meprolight Tru-Dot. In late 2018, HK introduced the VP9-B (B for \\"button\\"), equipped with a push-button magazine release, in response to the preferences of the American market. In January 2020, HK updated the VP9 design with a slide cutout for mounting pistol red-dot optics, new higher-capacity 17-round magazines to replace the 15-round magazines, and iron sights with a blacked- out rear bladed sight, replacing the previous three-dot setup, all as new standard features for the pistol. European variants VP9 variants available in Europe include: SFP9-SF RAL 8000 green brown gripframe and sighting in target Due to its trigger characteristics, the SFP9-SF variant is marketed by Heckler & Koch as a Special Forces pistol and not as a police duty pistol. The SFP9-SF has a trigger travel of approximately with a relatively short trigger reset of and a trigger pull of approximately with a maritime marine coating. SFP9-TR The Technical Specifications (TR) of the German Police (Technische Richtlinie Pistolen im Kaliber 9mm x 19, Revision January 2008) for obtaining a German Police duty pistol certification require a first shot trigger pull of ‚â•, a trigger travel of ‚â• and a trigger reset of ‚â•. The SFP9-TR has a trigger travel of approximately with a trigger reset of and a trigger pull of approximately to accommodate German legislation on police duty handguns. SFP9-M Maritime variant with saltwater resistant special coating (weapon fully usable according to the NATO salt spray test and NATO long-term saltwater test as per AC225 requirements) and OTB (Over The Beach) capability. SFP9-OR OR stands for 'optic ready', the variant uses the same trigger as SFP9-SF. SFP9-SD sound-suppressed variant (SD = Schalld√§mpfer) SFP9-SK variant with barrel (SK = Subkompakt) SFP9-L variant with barrel (L = Long) American variants The American-market VP9 is available in a variety of colors including black, flat dark earth (FDE), grey, olive drab (OD) green, and midnight bronze.

MacPherson (2 November 1911 ‚Äì 6 January 1993) was an American nuclear engineer and deputy director of Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). He contributed to the design and development of nuclear reactors and in the opinion of Alvin Weinberg he was \\"the country's foremost expert on graphite\\"...  Career  After receiving his Ph.D. in Physics from the University of California at Berkeley in 1936, MacPherson went to work at the National Weather Service in Washington DC. The following year he was hired by the National Carbon Division of the Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation in Cleveland Ohio, where he investigated the spectra of carbon arcs that were often used in the movie industry. In 1956 he moved to Oak Ridge TN to become a research scientist at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. MacPherson became deputy director of Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 1965, a position he held until 1970. From 1970 to 1976 he held the position of Professor of Nuclear Engineering at the University of Tennessee. In 1973 he served as acting director of the Institute for Energy Analysis, an organization founded by Alvin Weinberg for the study of management and future sources of energy. In 1978 he was elected to membership in the National Academy of Engineering.  Nuclear graphite and the Manhattan Project  The possibility of creating a chain reaction in uranium became apparent in 1939 following the nuclear fission experiments of Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassman, and the interpretation of these results by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch. The exciting possibilities that this presented rapidly spread throughout the world physics community. In order for the fission process to chain react, the neutrons created by uranium fission must be slowed down by interacting with a neutron moderator (an element with a low atomic weight, that will \\"bounce\\", when hit by a neutron) before they will be captured by other uranium atoms. It was well known in 1939 that the two most promising moderators were heavy water and graphite (a semi- crystalline form of pure carbon). In February 1940, using funds that were allocated partly as a result of the Einstein-Szilard letter to President Roosevelt, Leo Szilard purchased 4 tons of graphite from National Carbon for use in Enrico Fermi's experimental reactor, the so-called exponential pile. Fermi writes that \\"The results of this experiment was [sic] somewhat discouraging\\" presumably due to the absorption of neutrons by some unknown impurity. So, in December 1940 Fermi and Szilard met with H. G. MacPherson and V. C. Hamister at National Carbon to discuss the possible existence of impurities in graphite, without specifically describing the reasons for their visit. Having previously (September 1939) read the article of R. B. Roberts and J. B. H. Kuper (which described the necessity of a moderator in a chain reaction), MacPherson was able to deduce the purpose of the visit. Because of his experience with the spectra of carbon arcs he realized that even high quality graphite contains minute quantities of boron impurities that could make it potentially unusable as a neutron moderator in a uranium reactor, confirming a suspicion of Szilard. As a result of this meeting, over the next two years, MacPherson (together with L. M. Currie and V. C. Hamister) developed thermal purification techniques for the production of low boron content graphite, which resulted in the product \\"AGOT Graphite\\" of National Carbon. According to W. P. Eatherly, it was \\"the first true nuclear grade graphite\\". By November 1942, National Carbon had shipped 250 tons of AGOT graphite to the University of Chicago where it was used in the construction of Fermi's Chicago Pile-1, the first nuclear reactor to generate a sustained chain reaction. AGOT graphite was also used to build the X-10 graphite reactor in Oak Ridge TN and the reactors at the Hanford Site in Washington, which produced plutonium during and after World War II. This process and its later refinements became standard techniques in the manufacture of nuclear graphite. This crucial information concerning boron impurities was not known to the German scientists who attempted to create a chain reaction in uranium during the second world war. The cross section for neutron absorption in graphite was investigated in Germany by Walter Bothe, P. Jensen, and Werner Heisenberg who found it to be too high, thereby eliminating graphite as a possible moderator. Consequently, the German effort to create a chain reaction involved attempts to use heavy water, an expensive and scarce alternative. Writing as late as 1947, Heisenberg still did not understand that the only problem with graphite was the boron impurities.  Molten Salt Reactor  In 1956 MacPherson was appointed by ORNL director Alvin Weinberg, to lead the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment, a revolutionary safe, efficient and relatively inexpensive reactor design, now referred to as the Thorium fuel cycle. Within two years the chemical tests of molten materials, cost studies, overall design, and calculations had been completed and were outlined in MacPherson's quarterly progress report on the MSRE. Computations were performed on the ORACLE (computer), a clone of von Neumann's IAS machine that had been built at ORNL under the guidance of Alston Scott Householder. The MSRE was funded by the Atomic Energy Commission in 1959 and was completed in 1965. It ran continuously until it was shut down in 1969, but it had proved the viability of the design Weinberg refers to this project as \\"perhaps the most ingenious and daring engineering experiment ever conducted at ORNL\\". (In 1972 the U.S. government declined to fund the proposed follow-up molten salt breeder reactor at ORNL, fired Alvin Weinberg, and redirected its support towards the design and construction of liquid metal fast breeder reactors, such as the Clinch River Breeder Reactor.) In 1958, concurrently with the publication of the first textbook on nuclear reactors, MacPherson (together with James Lane and Frank Maslan) edited and published their engineering treatise on fluid fuel reactors  Mayan Archaeology  After he retired, MacPherson developed an interest in Mayan culture and writings, especially those pertaining to the Dresden Codex. This ancient Mayan manuscript contains a table, commonly referred to as the \\"Eclipse Warning Table\\" of dates, the intervals between which approximately correspond to the intervals between solar eclipses that occur worldwide. Hundreds of articles have been written in attempts to understand this table (see). MacPherson studied the baffling problem of how an ancient civilization may have succeeded in generating such a table when it did not possess the astronomical models that would be needed to predict eclipses worldwide and when only several solar eclipses would have been visible to the Maya throughout the whole period of their civilization. In what some experts consider to be \\"the most interesting of the recent studies of the eclipse table\\",MacPherson described a simple procedure by which such a table may have been assembled by Mayan astronomers in the process of determining the \\"lunar season\\".

Not much happened at the cobbled stoned sections and also the wind did not caused major splits in the bunch. Finally the caused a major split of the peloton at the VAM mountain and later at the narrow roads. At the start of the final lap of 7.6 km, four riders had an advantage on 12 chasers. Tiffany Cromwell (Velocio-SRAM), Roxane Knetemann (Rabo Liv), Chantal Blaak (Boels-Dolmans) and Elisa Longo Borghini (Wiggle Honda) all had teammates in the group behind and none seemed willing or allowed to back themselves. With cooperation amongst the four waning, the 12-strong chase group bridged the distance to the leaders. A lull in pace at the front gave the second chase group, led by Al√© Cipollini, an opportunity to merge with the first group on the road. An on-form Anna van der Breggen (Rabo Liv), Kirsten Wild (Hitec), who had punctured out of the leading group one lap earlier, and Bronzini were amongst the notable names in the second group.

Managerial career He started training the base teams of the SG Comercial-Estudiantes de Lugo at the age of 16, at the same time that he played on the youth team of that club. A serious knee injury at the age of 18 made him leave the playing fields prematurely, moving to the youth team of which he was part that same season. At the age of 18 he began his academic training as a coach at the Galician School of Coaches, obtaining in three years and consecutively, the different titles of coach, which at that time accredited him as the youngest Galician coach in history to obtain this level , and possibly from Spain. After leading the youth team of SG Comercial, and SD Castroverde and SD Quiroga in territorial category; His first opportunity to work in professional football comes as an assistant to Fabri Gonz√°lez at the CP M√©rida de Segunda Division A in Spain. After that two-year stage, he would return to Galicia where he would train the UD Xove-Lago and the SD Mindoniense of the Third Division of Spain, to repeat as Fabri Gonz√°lez's assistant in Real Murcia during the 1998-99 season, the year that would end in the same club but as head coach of the second team. Back in Galicia, he takes over the CD Endesa-As Pontes Third Division team, to land in the 2000-01 season at CD Lugo where he would spend three seasons developing various positions, starting as base football coordinator, passing by technical secretary or second coach, and concluding as coach of the first team. In 2003 he directed the SD Noja of the Third Division, with which he obtained the title of league champion, playing the promotion playoff to Second Division B, being eliminated in the round played against SD Huesca. Back in Galicia, where his coaching tasks are compatible whenever he is with those of a teacher at the Galician School of Coaches, the possibility of training Caravaca CF in Levantine lands arises. This return to the Region of Murcia would have great significance for his future, since it is there where months later he ends up working for Lorca Deportiva CF in Second Division A, and where he would meet Unai Emery, who years later would take him as his assistant to Valencia CF in La Liga. Subsequent to this stage, and combining his teaching tasks with that of coach, he directed several teams in the Region of Murcia such as Murcia Deportivo CF (youth), FC Puente Tocinos, Real Murcia (youth), CD Cieza (youth), o UCAM CF (youth). After this stage, and with the firm intention of returning to the professional benches, he took over the newly created FC Cartagena B, reaching the Third Division after two consecutive category promotions. As a sign of that eagerness to regain a place in professional football, he stops for the third time at Real Murcia, where he directs the filial team from the start, having the opportunity to lead the first team on an interim basis for two games. As a reward for that effort, during the 2019-20 season he has his first experience abroad, in the Volos NFC of the Greek Super League, serving as assistant to Juan Ferrando, where he becomes the first coach for four games; That same season is rounded off with a new experience in Lithuania, at FC Zalgiris in A Lyga, to end the year in SD Formentera.

The child was found with more than 115 tools made of stone and antlers and dusted with red ocher, suggesting an honorary burial. Anzick-1 is the only human who has been discovered from the Clovis Complex, and is the first ancient Native American genome to be fully sequenced. Paleogenomic analysis of the remains revealed Siberian ancestry and a close genetic relationship to modern Native Americans, including those of Central and South America. These findings support the hypothesis that modern Native Americans are descended from Asian populations who crossed Beringia between 32,000 and 18,000 years ago. Anzick-1's discovery and subsequent analysis has been controversial. The remains were found on private land, so the researchers did not violate the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) in their study. But many Native American tribal members in Montana believed they should have been consulted before the researchers undertook analysis of the infant's skeleton and genome. Anzick-1 was reburied on June 28, 2014 in the Shields River Valley in an intertribal ceremony. The numerous Clovis artifacts associated with the first burial are archived at the Montana Historical Society in Helena, Montana.  Discovery  The Anzick site was accidentally discovered by a construction worker in a collapsed rock shelter near Wilsall, Montana, on private land. The remains were found on the ranch of the Anzick family. The Anzick-1 remains were found buried under numerous tools: 100 stone tools and 15 remnants of tools made of bone. The site contained hundreds of stone projectile points, blades, and bifaces, as well as the remains of two juveniles. Some of the artifacts were covered in red ocher. The stone points were identified as part of the Clovis Complex because of their distinct shape and size. Originally, the two human skeletons were both thought to be contemporaneous with the Clovis Complex stone points, but later carbon dating revealed that only one of the human skeletons, Anzick-1, was from the Clovis period. Anzick-1 predates the other skeleton by two millennia.  Osteological findings  Anzick-1's skeletal remains included 28 cranial fragments, the left clavicle, and several ribs. These bones were discovered in highly fragmented states; however, partial reconstruction of the crania allowed for age estimation, investigation of basic health indicators, and some information about cultural practices. Originally, investigators thought the left clavicle showed evidence of cremation, but further analysis revealed that the discoloration was the result of groundwater staining and not fire. Additionally, all of the Anzick-1 remains were stained with ocher, which masks the natural color of the infant's bones.  Age estimation  The age at death of an individual can be determined from several skeletal markers, including cranial suture closure, tooth eruption rates, rates of epiphyseal fusion on long bones, and others. Cranial bones fuse together along suture lines throughout the life of every human, and can be used to estimate the age at death of human remains. The small size and lack of suture closure of Anzick-1's crania revealed that the individual was 1‚Äì2 years old. The metopic suture is also present in the frontal bone of Anzick-1. This suture is present in most human infants but closes well before adulthood. The presence of a frontal suture in Anzick-1's remains corroborates the age estimation of 1‚Äì2 years old.  Skeletal markers of health  Cranial bones can also be useful for detecting evidence of physiological perturbations. The reconstructed frontal, parietal, and occipital bone fragments of Anzick-1 were analyzed for these indicators of health; however, the crania showed no evidence of cribra orbitalia or porotic hyperostosis, conditions that can indicate diseases. Porotic hyperostosis is characterized by porous lesions on the parietal, occipital, and sometimes frontal bones. Cribra orbitalia is another pathological skeletal lesion that manifests as porosity on the orbital roof. Both porotic hyperostosis and cribra orbitalia are indicators of a nutritional deficiency that leads to anemia.  Cranial vault modification  Many cultures use wrappings and boards to manipulate the malleable cranial bones of infants into different shapes, which may hold cultural and ritual significance. This practice has been recorded historically and in several different bioarchaeological contexts throughout the Americas. The shape of Anzick-1's cranial vault revealed no evidence of cultural cranial vault modification. Paleogenetic findings A team of researchers throughout the United States and Europe conducted paleogenetic research on the Anzick-1 skeletal remains. They sequenced the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), the full nuclear DNA, and the Y-chromosome, and compared these sequences to those of modern populations throughout the world. The results of these analyses allowed the researchers to make conclusions about ancient migration patterns and the peopling of the Americas. These analyses revealed that the individual was closely related to Native Americans in Central and South America, instead of being closely related to the people of the Canadian Arctic, as had previously been thought likely. (The people of the Arctic are distinct from Native Americans to the south, including in lower North America and Central and South America.) The infant was also related to persons from Siberia and Central Asia, believed to be the ancestral population of indigenous peoples in the Americas. This finding supports the theory that the peopling of the Americas occurred from Asia across the Bering Strait. For more than 20 years, some anthropologists have debated whether the first settlers who came to the New World did so by crossing a land bridge through the Bering Strait, or by sea from the southwest of Europe, in what is called the Solutrean Hypothesis.  Nuclear DNA analysis  Human nuclear DNA is located inside the nucleus of every cell and makes up the human genome. Humans inherit half of their nuclear DNA from their mother and half from their father. Throughout human evolution, mutations occur that are inherited in each subsequent generation. Different populations have different frequencies of these mutations, and population histories can be ascertained from these mutations by comparing the mutations of one individual to other genomes from specific ethnic groups. The genome of Anzick-1 was sequenced and analyzed to look for specific mutations that might shed light on the population history of modern Native Americans. Anzick-1's genome was compared to over 50 Native American genomes for comparison, and researchers found that it was significantly more similar to these than to any modern Eurasian population. Anzick-1's genome was closer to 44 Native American populations from Central and South America than with 7 Native American populations from North America; samples from North America were limited as tribes in the United States have been reluctant to participate.  Mitochondrial DNA analysis  MtDNA is DNA located in mitochondria, an organelle that is found in human cells. The mitochondria is maternally inherited by all persons, and analysis of the mtDNA can provide information about maternal ancestry. MtDNA genomes are classified into different haplogroups based on a shared common ancestor. These distinct haplogroups provide information about ancient migration patterns. Morten Rasmussen and Sarah L. Anzick et al. sequenced the mitochondrial DNA of Anzick-1 and determined that the infant represents an ancient migration to North America from Siberia. They found that Anzick-1's mtDNA belongs to the haplogroup D4h3a, a \\"founder\\" haplogroup that might represent people taking an early coastal migration route into the Americas. The D haplogroup is also found in modern Native American populations, which provides a link between Anzick-1 and modern Native Americans. Although it is rare in most of today's Native Americans in the US and Canada, D4h3a genes are more common in native people of South America. This suggests a greater genetic complexity among Native Americans than previously thought, including an early divergence in the genetic lineage some 13,000 years ago. One theory suggested that after crossing into North America from Siberia, a group of the first Americans, with the lineage D4h3a, moved south along the Pacific coast and finally, through thousands of years, into Central and South America. Another line may have moved inland, east of the Rocky Mountains, ultimately populating most of what is now the United States and Canada.  Y-chromosome analysis  The y-chromosome is inherited directly through the paternal line from father to son in each generation. Because males have an x-chromosome and a y-chromosome, and females have two x-chromosomes, the y-chromosome can only be inherited from a male's father. Specific mutations on the y-chromosome can be used to trace the paternal lineage of a male individual. Like mtDNA, these mutations can be grouped and categorized into haplogroups. The y-chromosome of Anzick-1 was sequenced, and researchers determined that his y-chromosome haplogroup is Q-L54*(xM3), one of the major founding lineages of the Americas.  Implications  Anzick-1's mtDNA, nuclear DNA, and Y-Chromosome analysis revealed a close genetic affinity to modern Native Americans and provided evidence of gene flow from Siberia into the Americas nearly 13,000 years ago, earlier than thought. These findings support the Beringia Hypothesis of the peopling of the Americas and directly refute the Solutrean Hypothesis. Proponents of the latter theory do not think the evidence is in conflict.  Beringia Hypothesis  The Beringia Hypothesis is the mainstream model for the peopling of the Americas, which posits a migration of early Amerindians from Siberia across a land bridge that spanned the Bering Strait. This hypothesis is supported by genetic and archaeological evidence that places the migration no earlier than 32,000 years ago. Ancient Native Americans could have entered the New World across the Beringian land bridge, and passing south from Alaska through an ice-free corridor in Canada. Another concept is that they used boats to sail along the coast of Siberia, the Beringia land bridge, and the Pacific coast of North America. Archeological evidence at the former area of the land bridge or a coastal path has been lost because of the rise in sea levels. The Anzick-1 paleogenetic analysis lends support to the Beringia Hypothesis theory, showing that humans had arrived in Montana by nearly 13,000 years ago.  Solutrean Hypothesis  The controversial Solutrean hypothesis posits that modern Native Americans migrated to the New World across the Atlantic Ocean from Europe via \\"ocean current highways.\\" Based on superficial similarities between Clovis stone tools and earlier Solutrean stone tool cultures in Western Europe, proponents of the Solutrean Hypothesis believe that ancient people crossed the Atlantic Ocean during a climatic event that raised glacier levels to a maxima that created a land bridge between Europe and North America. These early migrants to the New World would have left evidence of their presence through cave paintings and a distinct tool culture influencing the Clovis Complex tools, but should also have left a genomic signature in individuals associated with such artifacts. No convincing evidence in support of this hypothesis has been found, and the results of the Anzick-1 genomic study falsify it by showing no genetic contribution from European populations in this Clovis-associated individual.  Ethics  Studying the remains of ancient Native Americans is an \\"ethical minefield\\" because it calls into question \\"ownership\\" and interpretation of the past. Larry Echo-Hawk, a member of the Pawnee Nation, legal scholar, and United States Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs under President Barack Obama, said of the excavation of Native American remains, \\"Regardless of the motive for expropriating Indian graves, the impact of this activity upon the affected Indians is always the same: emotional trauma and spiritual distress.\\" After the remains of Anzick-1 were excavated in 1968, they were analyzed by several teams of researchers and eventually returned to the Anzick family. The daughter of the Anzick family, Sarah Anzick had become a genetic researcher. She hoped to conduct genomic analysis on the Anzick-1 skeleton. She was cautious because a previous case, involving the ancient remains of a Native American called Kennewick Man, caused a great deal of controversy. Under NAGPRA, US law protects the remains and artifacts of Native Americans found on federal lands or stored by institutions that receive federal funding. It requires restoration of remains and artifacts to tribes associated with the remains or culture. Because Anzick-1 was discovered on private property, Sarah Anzick was not legally required to consult tribal members before conducting analysis of the remains. She discussed her goals with representatives of several Montana tribes that now inhabit the area, to determine whether to use the required techniques (which destroy some material) to analyze the remains of Anzick-1. Because she was unable to achieve consensus, she temporarily gave up the project. She eventually conducted DNA analysis on the remains of Anzick-1. After the results of the analysis revealed a link between Anzick-1 and modern Native Americans, the team of researchers sought consultation from several Montana tribes. Eske Willerslev, a Danish genetic researcher, visited several Indian reservations in Montana in 2013 to try to engage community members in the decision-making related to the research of Anzick-1. He met with Shane Doyle, who became a co-author of the paper. A member of the Crow tribe, Doyle works in Native American studies at Montana State University. There were mixed opinions about the research conducted on Anzick-1, but many tribal members said that they would prefer to have been contacted before the destructive techniques were performed, not after. The overwhelming response from Montana tribal members was that the remains of Anzick-1 should be reburied according to tribal ritual.

It is located at the intersection of the Selimiye Square and the ƒ∞dadi Street, and is currently as the headquarters of the Turkish Cypriot Union of Municipalities.  History  The earliest parts of the building were built in 1329, during the Lusignan rule of the island, as the Latin Archbishopric Palace of Cyprus. This building initially had a rectangular plan, as opposed to the L-shaped structure of the contemporary mansion. The 30th Latin Archbishop of Cyprus, Orsini Aldobrandini of Rome, rebuilt the building between 1502 and 1524 and the building was kept for the same purpose during the Venetian rule in the island. After the capture of Cyprus by the Ottoman Empire, the building was designated as the place of residence of the qadi of Cyprus. For this purpose, the upper floor of the building was built in the Ottoman architectural style. The building was used for this purpose for centuries, but was restored between 1819 and 1821 and became the place of residence of the governor. It became known as the \\"K√º√ß√ºk Mehmet Building\\" due to the fact that this change occurred during the administration of the governor K√º√ß√ºk Mehmed Pasha. During the Ottoman period, the large and spacious yard of the building was confiscated and used as the site of several educational institutions: the Great Madrasah (destroyed in 1932), Small Madrasah (only its fountain survives), Library of Mahmud II. In 1897, an \\"idadi\\" (middle school) was built, which was later enlarged to also contain a \\"sultani\\" (high school), but converted into the Ayasofya Primary School after the Turkish educational reform in 1924 abolished religious education. Today, this building is used by the Folk Arts Foundation. In 1901, another \\"idadi\\" was built in the territory, later used as the Bayraktar Middle School until 1960 and today used by the Department of Antiquities. It was later used as a building of the Nicosia Municipality and provided housing for civil servants. In 1979, the inhabitants were evicted and the mansion renovated, and granted to the Turkish Cypriot Union of Municipalities in November 1985.  Architecture  The fa√ßade towards the Selimiye Mosque. Coats of arms can be seen on the southern entrance gate. The building has a Gothic southern entrance gate with three coats of arms inscribed on it. There are different claims regarding the ownership of these coats of arms, these include Costanza De Brie, who owned the land where St. Sophia's Cathedral was located, Prioli, the archbishop of Cyprus in 1495 and the Venetian family of Donado della Rose. The other coats of arms on the gate were removed and used at the construction of other buildings. During the Venetian rule, the building had tunnels connecting it to St. Sophia's Cathedral and St. Catherine's Cathedral. There are indications of the existence of a tower for safety purposes on the southwestern corner of the building during this period. During the restoration, a closer examination of the building revealed that a greater portion of the building was dated to the Lusignan and Venetian eras. The upper floor of the building exhibits typical Ottoman architecture, with thin walls, large rooms, a Baghdadi bay window and ornate walls. The motifs of flowers and plants are in the traditional √ßitak√¢ri style, and are estimated to be dated from the 18th century.

The Rote Fl√ºh is a peak in the Tannheim Mountains, a sub-range of the Allg√§u Alps. It is 2,108 metres high. The Rote Fl√ºh is built from Wetterstein limestone. It gets its name (which means \\"red rock face\\") from the layers of embedded particles of red limestone rock that appear reddish as the sun goes down.  Location and surrounding area  The ar√™te of Judenscharte links the Rote Fl√ºh with the Gimpel to the north. The optically unimpressive ridge of the east ar√™te bears its own name, the Hochwieseler, on account of the number of climbing routes on its south face. Along the almost two-kilometre-long West Ar√™te, from which the Schartschrofen rises, runs the Friedberger Klettersteig to the col of F√ºssener J√∂chl which is served by a cable car. The prominence of the Roten Fl√ºh is at least 108 metresExact value not known; given value is a minimum, (but it could be up to 19 metres higher). It was deduced from the spacing of the 20-metre-contour lines on the 1:25,000 series topographic map. Its isolation is 300 metres, the Gimpel being the reference summit.  Alpinism  There are several climbing tours of the Rote Fl√ºh ranging from alpine routes on the (short) north face to sports climbing at grade nine on the south face.Walter H√∂lzer: My nine routes on the Roten Fl√ºh South Face . Retrieved on 1 September 2010. The normal route is classed as relatively straightforward and therefore very frequently used. From the Gimpelhaus or the Tannheimer Hut the path runs through a cirque on the eastern side of the summit block, which is partially secured by cables. In good weather queues often form at this bottleneck.Dieter Seibert: Alpine Club Guide alpin ‚Äì Allg√§uer Alpen und Ammergauer Alpen. 17th edn., Bergverlag Rother, Munich, 2008 (pp. 240f). Due to its location in the \\"front row\\" of the Alps,the Rote Fl√ºh has outstanding views both of the flat Alpine Foreland as well as the lake of Haldensee, just under 1,000 metres below in the valley of Tannheimer Tal. The east ar√™te, a ridge called the Hochwiesler, on whose south face there are also several climbing routes. From it there is a 30-metre abseiling point to the north and a 100-metre abseiling piste to the south, whose first half has a 45-metre free hanging drop. In sunny weather the mountain can be climbed to within about 2-3 rope lengths of the summit on the often snow-free south face. After an anchor broke causing a roped team to fall with the loss of three lives, all frequently used south face routes were equipped with climbing bolts. The easiest one is the normal south face route (IV). Two abseil pistes (100 metres) run back to the foot of the south face.

Because they exhibit very few impact craters they are believed to be relatively young. THEMIS image of Medusae Fossae Formation, ASU, 2002-04-16 The easily eroded nature of the Medusae Fossae Formation suggests that it is composed of weakly cemented particles, and was most likely formed by the deposition of wind-blown dust or volcanic ash. Yardangs are parts of rock that have been sand blasted into long, skinny ridges by bouncing sand particles blowing in the wind.Yardangs in Arsinoes Chaos University of Arizona HiRISE Operations, 04 January 2015http://www.uahirise.org/ESP_039563_1730 Layers are seen in parts of the formation. A resistant caprock on the top of yardangs has been observed in Viking, Mars Global Surveyor, and HiRISE photos.

Rule in Athens Lachares was one of the most influential leaders in his native city, after Athenian democracy had been re-established by Demetrius Poliorcetes. He was afterwards secretly gained over by the King of Macedonia Cassander, who incited him to aim at the acquisition of the tyranny, hoping to be able through his means to rule Athens.Pausanias, I 25,7. He does not seem, however, to have been able to effect this purpose until Athens was besieged by Demetrius (296 BC), when he took advantage of the excitement of the popular mind to expel Demochares, the leader of the opposite party, and establish himself as undisputed master of the city. We know but little either of the intrigues by which he raised himself to power or of his proceedings afterwards, but he is described in general terms by Pausanias, as \\"of all tyrants the most inhuman towards men, and the most sacrilegious towards the gods\\". He plundered the temples, and especially the Parthenon, of all their most valuable treasures, stripping even the chryselephantine statue of Athena Parthenos of her sacred ornaments. At the beginning of his rule he had procured a decree to be passed, forbidding, under pain of death, even the mention of treating with Demetrius and he succeeded in inducing, or compelling, the Athenians to hold out until they were reduced to the last extremities of famine. At length, however, he despaired of doing so any longer, and made his escape to Boeotia.Pausanias I 25,7, 29,10; Plutarch, Demetrius 33, 34, De Ts. et Osir. 71, p. 379, Adv. Epicur. p. 1090; Polyaenus Stratagemata IV 7,5; Athenaeus IX p. 405f. Escape from Athens The historian Polyaenus tells a number of stories about the tyrant's lucky escapes which appear almost as a literary topos. According to Polyaenus, Lachares fled from Athens stealing the city's put and hiding the gold in a basket covered with dung. Dressed up as a slave, with his face blackened, he slipped out through a minor gate. Chased by a squadron of fast cavalry, he scattered some gold coins on the road to slow his pursuers, which allowed him to reach Thebes. When Demetrius Poliorcetes took that city, too, Lachares hid himself in the sewers, only to come out at night after a few days and make his escape to Delphi. From there he went to king Lysimachus in Thrace, and there he was once again in danger of falling into the hands of his enemy, when Demetrius besieged the town of Sestos on the Hellespont, in which Lachares happened to be. Again, Lachares stayed for several days in a pit, with just enough provisions to support himself, and this time he escaped during a funeral procession disguised as a mourning woman wearing a gown and a black veil over his head. From Sestos he fled to Lysimachia.Polyaenus III 7 Finally we hear of him at Cassandrea as late as 279 BC, when he was expelled from that city by Apollodorus, on a charge of having conspired to betray it into the hands of Antiochus.Polyaenus VI 7,2 Death Pausanias states that Lachares was murdered by the people of Coroneia for the sake of the wealth he was supposed to have accumulated. The geographer gives no date for his death, which leaves several possibilities: either he died much earlier than Polyaenus believes, or Pausanias is mistaken, or Lachares later returned south, to meet his fate in Boeotia many years after his tyranny.Pausanias I 25,7 References Category:4th-century BC births Category:4th-century BC Athenians Category:3rd- century BC Athenians Category:3rd-century BC deaths Category:Athenian tyrants ","title":"Lachares"},{"id":"45670464","text":"Fatima Al Qadiri (, born July, 1981) is a Senegalese-born Kuwaiti musician and conceptual artist.

Known universally throughout Irish and British theatrical and broadcasting circles as Ronnie, among the writers Mason championed, Brian Friel perhaps became the most prominent. Mason produced and directed Friel's earliest plays, A Sort of Freedom (16 January 1958) and To This Hard House (24 April 1958), for the BBC Northern Ireland Home Service on radio and later brought Friel's stage work to the BBC's national networks. Life and works Ronald Charles Frederick MasonRonald Mason biography, BBC Comedy and Drama Exhibition was born in Ballymena, County Antrim, the seventh child of a seventh child in a strongly Protestant community. Among his schoolmates in Ballymena was Ian Paisley, who was to become a major political figure in Unionist politics and a leading anti-Catholic, whom he was later to command to ‚ÄòSit down, Ian‚Äô, when the Reverend Paisley began a peroration at the BBC during Mason's years as the BBC's Head of Programmes in Northern Ireland. The Reverend Paisley complied. Mason graduated from Queen's University, Belfast, and began his career teaching English and French in the 1940s. He joined the BBC six years later in 1955 as a radio producer in Belfast, finding a kindred spirit in the novelist, radio producer and broadcaster Sam Hanna Bell against BBC Belfast's prevailing caution in political matters, standing with Bell as an advocate for the shipyard worker turned controversial playwright, Sam Thompson. After negotiating the treacherous BBC politics in Northern Ireland, successfully bringing new and established writers to the Northern Ireland Home Service and attracting attention in London, he joined BBC Radio Drama in London in 1963. As his successor as Head of Radio Drama, John Tydeman, described it in his obituary in The Independent, \\"he became executive producer of an innovative new series of 15-minute-long single plays broadcast every weekday evening at 11.45 under the title Just Before Midnight. The series gave great encouragement to new playwrights, including the young Tom Stoppard\\".John Tydeman Obituary: Ronald Mason, The Independent, 20 January 1997 Jill Hyem and Brian Friel would be among the other emerging playwrights. His time in London also saw him producing and directing a twenty-hour-long production of Tolstoy's War and Peace ,War and Peace, Episode 1, BBC Radio 4, 1969 bringing plays by Friel to national prominence and directing work from Eugene O'Neill, Marguerite Duras and Christopher Hampton. During forays into television in the 1960s, he produced The Randy Dandy,The Randy Dandy, BBC Television, 1961, Radio Times by Stewart Love, ‚Äòthe Irish John Osborne‚Äô, and was director for the six-part series Here Lies Miss SabryHere Lies Miss Sabry, final episode BBC TV, 1960, Radio Times>, starring Sebastian Shaw, produced by Dennis Vance and written by Raymond Bowers. He also oversaw a series of new plays called Double Image, among which he produced Tom Stoppard's British television debut, A Separate PeaceTom Stoppard, A Separate Peace, BBC Television, 1966, IMDb in 1966 . His radio production of Friel's play The Loves of Cass McGuire in August 1969 preceded the Broadway premiere by two months and the Dublin premiere at the Abbey Theatre the following year. Head of Programmes, Northern Ireland (1970‚Äì1976) His political acumen seemingly took him away from drama in 1970, when he returned to Belfast to assume the role of Head of Programmes, Northern Ireland. It was not a simple role of choosing programmes, but an essential and central role in redefining the BBC's presence in the province. Security was a continuing issue, bringing staff into safer buildings in the midst of a bombing campaign, and balancing the complicated demands of Protestant and Catholic communities. Although Mason's time at Belfast's Broadcasting House saw him facing serious civil unrest, shown through the bomb attacks on the BBC, the violence had impact through all the province's cultural life, reducing audiences and seeing the closure of theatres. Mason was made vice-chairman of the Interplay Theatre Management Committee of the Arts Council of Northern Ireland,Arts Council of Northern Ireland Annual Report 1971/1972, pp. 15-18 set up to form a company that would offer work to the ‚Äòactors and actresses‚Äô, suffering unemployment in traditional theatres, by taking plays to schools. The work ranged from classical drama to Bernard Shaw's Arms and the Man, but also quickly added the living writer Stewart Love, whose work Mason had previously produced for the BBC. Quoting from BBC files, John Tydeman, in his Independent obituary, presented Mason's response to a suggestion in 1972 from the BBC Director General, Charles Curran, that he might like some respite from the strain of the Troubles: \\"My duty is to Ireland. I intend to devote myself to the job of helping to make the province a better place in which to live.\\" He continued to accept his responsibilities for another four years, including his leading role in the launch of BBC Radio Ulster in 1975. Tydeman described him as \\"a man of all Ireland\\". Head of Radio Drama (1976‚Äì1986) On the back of his success in Northern Ireland, Mason was one of five people who might have become Controller of BBC Radio 4 in 1976Life on Air: A History of Radio Four By David Hendy, Chapter 6 ‚ÄòMac the Knife‚Äô, Oxford University Press along with Monica Sims and David Hatch, both of whom were appointed some years later. In 1976, however, the post was given to Ian McIntyre, whose strict journalistic regime lasted only two years before he was moved to become Controller of Radio 3. In the meantime, Mason was invited back to London to take up the post of Head of Radio Drama on the impending departure of Martin Esslin, and became the third longest-serving head of one of the most culturally significant posts of the time. His entanglements with Ian McIntyre, however, were to last the rest of his time in radio. One of the reasons for bringing Mason back to Radio Drama, above his proven success in the form, was the need for a politically savvy executive who could fight the corner for Radio Drama at one of the cyclical period of BBC cuts in funding. He did this with considerable success, and was held up as a model by European broadcasters also facing contractions in the relatively expensive form of radio art. Not everything was considered a success by Mason. In 1980, Radio Drama's most popular programme, the Radio Two daily soap, Waggoner's Walk (on air since 1969), was presented as a potential cut since its budget was almost exactly the requested savings. Although Mason also presented a fully costed alternative series of cuts across the drama output, BBC management opted for the simple expedient of axing the soap. Meanwhile, Ian McIntyre's reign at Radio 3, with limited journalism in the musical output, saw McIntyre's intensive scrutiny of the spoken-word programmes. Drama became a particular target. When McIntyre blocked the broadcast of a Mason- commissioned radio drama by the writer and director Mike Leigh in May, 1979, Too Much of a Good Thing, recorded on location with convincing sexual activity, it set up a continuing conflict. Piers Plowright, in the book And Now on Radio 4 by Simon Elmes, recalled the occasion when Mason's fury at a Radio 3 meeting, in response to criticism of a radio play, led to Mason throwing a chair and leaving the meeting.Simon Elmes And Now on Radio 4 ‚Äì A celebration of the World's Best Radio Station Arrow Books, 2008, p. 34 Mike Leigh's play was not broadcast until 1992 some years after the departures of both Mason and McIntyre from their posts, Mason continued to support his writers and his personal intervention in defending a Howard Barker script, Scenes from an Execution, which meant a line-by-line scrutiny of the play with negotiations that went down to the use of the word \\"groin\\". Richard Wortley's production, broadcast on Radio 3, features Glenda Jackson in the leading role. Despite his reservations, McIntyre nominated the production for Europe's grand prize for radio drama, the Prix Italia, which it won in 1985. Mason's service on committees from the EBU, the Arts Council of Northern Ireland and the National Council for Drama Training was influential and rigorous. At the NCDT his support for removing the accreditation of a leading London drama college in the 1980s had positive effects for the NCDT, which was shown to be far from toothless, and for the college in question which improved impressively. His concern for drama training reflected his continuing support for BBC Radio Drama's annual award of contracts to graduating drama college students competing in the Carleton Hobbs Awards, named after one of British radio's most successful radio actors. The tenacity of Mason's tenure secured radio drama as a key component in the Corporation's public service commitments. His interventions preserved the bulk of the radio drama output, and its continuing integration with radio features, which, particularly in the work of Piers Plowright, brought European recognition to the department in several Prix Italia awards. Later life After his retirement, he returned to radio to produce John Arden and Margaretta D'Arcy's Whose is the Kingdom?,Whose is the Kingdom?, John Arden and Margeretta D'Arcy, Episode 1, 19 February 1988, BBC Genome a nine-play sequence of dramas about Christianity. Arden and D‚ÄôArcy wrote to The Irish Times after Mason's death, reporting that his funeral had needed to be postponed by a week to accommodate the people who wished to attend, and, in their tribute, gave an insight into his working practices: ‚ÄòAs a drama director, he was a natural radio genius and an educator both to playwrights and actors. He never seemed to forget that he had begun his adult life as a teacher: he would inspire his casts by getting up from the directorial chair, moving all over the studio, telling stories, and more or less improvising the whole play from start to finish, with a running fire, of folklorish anecdotes from his childhood in County Antrim.‚Äô Letters, Irish Times, 17 February 1997 In his last years, Mason suffered from emphysema, related to his devotion to cigarettes, but even then, as Oscar Wilde's grandson, Merlin Holland, wrote to The Independent,Merlin Holland Obituary footnote, The Independent , 5 February 1997 Mason called in his estimable contacts to secure Wilde's place in Poet's Corner at Westminster Abbey when he realised that a \\"fellow Irishman\\" had been denied his rightful place. \\"Without Ronald Mason's taking the initiative, despite his ill-health, Wilde might still be waiting\\" wrote Merlin Holland. \\"The ceremony on 14 February 1995 drew the biggest Poets' Corner crowd since Byron's inclusion in the 1960s\\". Mason died of emphysema, still smoking next to his oxygen tank, in London on 16 January 1997. He was 70 years old.

Dunning, Work on Medieval Pottery, 28 April 1978, p.18 His most significant contribution was in the study of post-Conquest pottery; he was largely responsible for establishing the first chronological framework by which different types of English ceramics could be dated. His work has been described as 'visionary' and 'seminal'. It has been noted that Dunning didn't achieve the profile of some of his peers due to the fact that he didn't write a text-book on either medieval pottery in particular or on medieval archaeology in general, but concentrated on writing articles for academic journals and encouraged the research interests of others, however John Hurst argued that, '...we should regard Gerald Dunning as the main founding father of medieval archaeology as we know it today in the last quarter of the 20th Century'.John Hurst, \\"Gerald Dunning and His Contribution to Medieval Archaeology\\", Bulletin of the Medieval Pottery Research Group, Vol. 6 (1982), pp. 1‚Äì20, at p. 15.  Career  Gerald Clough Dunning was the son of James and Mary (Clough) Dunning. He was born on 20 December 1905 at Ventnor, Isle of Wight. He was educated at Shoreham Grammar School and Bedford Modern School. His early interest in archaeology was fostered at Bedford through the school's archaeological society, and he also took on the task of mending broken pottery and also reassembling Bronze-Age skeletons from Dunstable Downs held in the school museum.Hurst, \\"Gerald Dunning and His Contribution\\", p. 5A. Underwood, School of the Black and the Red: A History of Bedford Modern School (Bedford, 2010 edn.), p. 130 At University College, London he took a BSc in Anthropology and in 1927 was awarded the University's Franks Studentship in Archaeology.Hurst, 'Gerald Dunning and His Contribution', pp. 5‚Äì6 From 1929 to 1934 he was based at the London Museum as Investigator of Building Excavations in the City of London on behalf of the Society of Antiquaries of London.Hurst, \\"'Gerald Dunning and His Contribution\\"', pp. 7‚Äì8 From 1934 to 1942 he was Junior Investigator with the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales.Hurst, 'Gerald Dunning and His Contribution', pp. 8‚Äì9. From 1942 to 1946 he served in the meteorological service of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve.Hurst, \\"Gerald Dunning and His Contribution\\", p. 9 At the end of the war he returned to London as an Inspector of Ancient Monuments, where he remained until his retirement in 1965. He was appointed a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1935, and was awarded the degree of D.Lit by the University of London in 1968.Hurst, \\"Gerald Dunning and His Contribution\\", p. 9Hurst, 'Gerald Dunning and His contribution', p. 15 He was a founding council member of the Society for Medieval Archaeology in 1957 and a founder and for 12 years Chairman of the Deserted Medieval Villages Research Group.Hurst, \\"Gerald Dunning and His Contribution\\", p. 11  Later medieval pottery  At the beginning of Dunning's career there was a general ignorance regarding the chronology of later English medieval pottery, and this problem began to occupy his mind during the rescue excavations he undertook in the City of London during the early 1930s; he later recalled, '... I hastily planned Roman walls, drew sections, took photographs and scribbled notes on pieces of paper. We then left the sites, pausing for a glass of sherry at one of the very convenient pubs on the way, and returned to the Guildhall for lunch. Later in the afternoon and evening, I returned to the London Museum, there to disentangle my notes and start to draw the plans correctly and have a go at the pottery. Medieval pottery often turned up in the City and I began to draw this too. Often, in the evening Mortimer Wheeler used to come in to see what was the loot that day. He was as perplexed as I that not even a vague date could be given to the medieval pots'.Hurst, \\"Gerald Dunning and His Contribution\\", p. 7 In 1931 Dunning was awarded the Esher Research Studentship to study specifically medieval pottery and published his first two reports on groups of these objects in 1935. Over the following 40 years he developed the first chronology of later English medieval pottery. He was able to discern regional variations in use and production, and through research in France, the Low Countries, Scandinavia and Germany, insular from imported pottery in England, as well as English exports to the Continent.Hurst, \\"Gerald Dunning and His Contribution\\", p. 10 and pp. 12‚Äì13. According to Hurst, 'Because of all this work, we have a basic framework on which our present knowledge of medieval pottery and many other classes of object is founded'Hurst, \\"Gerald Dunning and His Contribution\\", p. 13.  Anglo-Saxon archaeology  Dunning also published extensively on Anglo-Saxon pottery, most notably on Saxo-Norman wheel-thrown types from East Anglia. He also examined late Anglo-Saxon pottery imports from the Rhineland to understand the complexity of North Sea trade routes during the period.Hurst, 'Gerald Dunning and His Contribution', p. 10 He collaborated with Sonia Chadwick Hawkes on a study of some of the ornamental migration period grave goods excavated from Anglo-Saxon cemeteries in Kent.S.

American expatriate players began to steadily find spots on Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) rosters in the 1960s. More than 600 Americans have played NPB, although very few last more than a single season in Japan. Many of the most celebrated American expatriate players came to Japan after not finding success in the Major Leagues. Major League Baseball (MLB) players, scouts, and sabermetricians describe play in the NPB as \\"AAAA\\"; less competitive than in the MLB, but more competitive than in AAA minor league baseball, which may explain the American expatriate players' success overseas. (see: \\"Big in Japan\\") American players hold several NPB records, including highest career batting average (Leron Lee, .334), highest single season batting average (Randy Bass, .389), and the dubious record of most strikeouts in a season by a hitter (Ralph Bryant, 204). Americans rank #3 (Tuffy Rhodes, 55) and #5 (Randy Bass, 54) on the list of most home runs in a season, and #2 in single-season RBI (Bobby Rose, 153). Since the 1970s, Americans have also made an impact in Nippon Professional Baseball's managing and coaching ranks, with Bobby Valentine and Trey Hillman managing their respective teams to Japan Series championships.  Gaijin waku and cultural differences  For most of its history, NPB regulations imposed \\"gaijin waku\\", a limit on the number of non-Japanese people per team to two or three ‚Äî including the manager and/or coaching staff.\\"Foreign Player Restrictions?\\", JapaneseBaseball.com. Accessed March 12, 2015. In addition to the foreign culture, the language barrier, and loneliness, differences in the way the game is played in Japan are often challenges for American players. Japanese teams practice much more often than American teams, the game relies more on off-speed pitching and not as many fastballs, and team harmony is stressed over individual achievements. The American writer Robert Whiting wrote in his 1977 book The Chrysanthemum and the Bat that, While others have objected to characterizing the sport that way, many Japanese players and managers describe themselves in these terms. Perhaps because of these cultural differences, many expatriate baseball players don't last very long in NPB. Even star players often return home after five or six seasons. Of American expatriate baseball players in Japan, the longest tenures in NPB belong to Tuffy Rhodes (a total of 13 seasons in NPB), Wally Yonamine (12 seasons), Leron Lee (11 seasons), and Leon Lee and Greg Wells (10 seasons each).  Recruitment and salaries  There was time when Japanese teams looked to recruit established Major League players on the downside of their careers. Now, however, Japanese teams scout American Triple-A games and monitor MLB transactions, looking for players being shuttled back and forth between the minors and the majors.Berry, Adam. \\"Challenge of playing in Japan can be worthwhile,\\" MLB.com. Accessed March 15, 2015. A good majority of American players recruited to play in NPB are power hitters, which traditionally are in short supply in Japan.\\"The Best Foreign Pitchers in the History of Japan's NPB,\\" Burly's Baseball Musings (Oct. 6, 2014). Although the average NPB salary is not comparable to MLB salaries, Japanese teams can offer much more money than a player can make in the American minor leagues.Dubberke, Tom. \\"What Do American Players Make in Japan?\\" BleacherReport (June 19, 2009). The typical American playing NPB has a higher base salary than his Japanese teammates, but his endorsement opportunities are much more limited. The Yomiuri Giants are particularly known for the high salaries they pay foreign players.  History   1930s and 1940s  American Major League Baseball outfielder Lefty O'Doul was instrumental in spreading baseball's popularity in Japan, serving as the sport's \\"goodwill ambassador\\" in the mid-1930s, and again after World War II. Japanese-American outfielder Fumito \\"Jimmy\\" Horio (who hailed from Hawaii) became the first American to play professional baseball in Japan when he joined the Dai Nippon Tokyo Yakyu Kurabu (later known as the Tokyo Giants) in December 1934, touring with them in 1935.\\"Jimmy Horio,\\" Baseball- Reference.com. Accessed March 14, 2015. Dai Nippon was a team of all-stars organized by media mogul Matsutar≈ç Sh≈çriki that matched up against a visiting American All-Star team that included Babe Ruth, Jimmie Foxx, Lou Gehrig, and Charlie Gehringer. Owner Sh≈çriki survived an assassination attempt by right- wing nationalists for allowing foreigners (in this case, Americans) to play baseball in Jingu Stadium. He received a 16-inch-long scar from a broadsword during the assassination attempt.\\"Matsutaro Shoriki: Japan's Citizen Kane,\\" The Economist (Dec 22, 2012). Harris McGalliard (known in Japan as \\"Bucky Harris\\"), Herbert \\"Buster\\" North, and James E. \\"Jimmy Bonna\\" Bonner became the first Americans to play in Japan's professional baseball league, when the Japanese Baseball League was formed in 1936.

Harris, North, and Bonner were joined by the Japanese-American players Kiyomi \\"Slim\\" Hirakawa, Kazuyoshi \\"George\\" Matsuura, Yoshio \\"Sam\\" Takahashi, and Tadashi Wakabayashi.

Pitcher Tadashi Wakabayashi renounced his American citizenship in 1941, following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (so his achievements as the Japanese Baseball League Most Valuable Player in 1944 and 1947 \\"don't count\\" toward the accomplishments of American players). No Americans played in Japanese pro leagues from that point until after the war.  1950s  Another Hawaiian, Wally Yonamine, was the first American to play professional baseball in Japan after World War II when he joined the Yomiuri Giants of the reorganized Japanese professional league, now known as Nippon Professional Baseball. A multi-skilled outfielder, Yonamine was a member of four Japan Series Championship teams, the Central League Most Valuable Player in 1957, a consecutive seven-time Best Nine Award winner (1952‚Äì58), an eleven-time All- Star, and a three-time batting champion. He was inducted into the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994, the only American yet admitted into the Hall as a player. Other than Yonamine, the first Americans to play NPB were African- American veterans of Negro League baseball.Zurui, \\"Negro Leaguers in Japan,\\" BlackTokyo (September 12, 2008). The Hankyu Braves made a commitment to attracting these players, the first of whom were third-baseman John Britton and pitcher Jimmy Newberry, who both came to the Braves in 1952. Britton played for the Braves through the 1953 season, while Newberry left after one year. Infielder Larry Raines and pitcher Rufus Gaines joined Britton on the Braves in 1953. Gaines pitched well, recording 14 wins with a 2.53 ERA, but left after one season, while Raines stayed another year, winning the Pacific League batting title in 1954 with a .337 average.Albright, Jim. \\"All-Time Foreign-Born Team: Larry Raines,\\" BaseballGuru.com.

Former league star Wally Yonamine became the first foreigner to be a manager in the NPB, when he took charge of the Chunichi Dragons from 1972‚Äì1977. After a long successful Major League career, Joe Pepitone made an impression in a negative way. In 1973 he accepted an offer of $70,000 ($ today) a year to play for the Yakult Atoms.

Hall of Fame pitcher Warren Spahn was hired to serve as the team's temporary pitching coach, after having worked together with Lutz on the Cleveland Indians' coaching staff.Harvin, Al. \\"People in Sports; DiMaggio Impressed by Japanese Baseball\\", The New York Times, February 15, 1975. Accessed November 6, 2008. As manager, Lutz had the team change the colors of its caps to red to represent the team's fighting spirit. Unfortunately, Lutz only lasted as Carp manager for 15 games, leaving the team due to an umpiring dispute (although the Carp went on to win its first-ever Central League championship under replacement manager Takeshi Koba).Staff. \\"Former Carp manager Lutz dead at 83\\", Yomiuri Shimbun, October 28, 2008.

Famed manager Leo Durocher was hired as manager of the Taiheiyo Club Lions in 1976, but he retired due to illness (hepatitis) before the beginning of the season.Markus, Robert. \\"Feisty Baseball Legend Leo Durocher Dead At 86: Ex- player, Manager Lived Life On Own Terms,\\" Chicago Tribune (October 8, 1991). Willie Davis 2 time Allstar with 17 seasons in MLB signed with the Chunichi Dragons after the 1976 MLB season and became one of the most famous American players to ever come to Japan. Willie a 3 time Gold Glove winner for the Dodgers in 1971-72-73 for his Centerfield Defense had 2547 hits upon arrival in the Land of the Rising Sun. In 1977 he won the Pacific League player of the month for June but got hurt in early July and with less than 300 ABs he hit 25 HR‚Äôs and batted over .300 for 1977. He also had a fine 1978 with the Crown Lighter Lions before coming back to the Majors to finish his career with the Angels in 1979. Davis over 2 seasons in Japan hit 43 HR‚Äôs and batted .300. Leron Lee played for the Lotte Orions from 1977‚Äì1987. He led the league in home runs and runs batted in his first season, and won the batting title in 1980. In 1978, he invited younger brother Leon Lee to play in Japan, and the brothers formed a feared power-hitting duo for the Orions. The African American sidekick role in the 1992 film Mr. Baseball (played by actor Dennis Haysbert) is believed to be based on the experiences of several African American players in Japan, including the Lee brothers. In 1979 Charlie Manuel led the Kintetsu Buffaloes to their first pennant win, hitting .324 with 37 home runs and 94 RBI, winning the home run title and the Pacific League Most Valuable Player award ‚Äî the first American to receive the league MVP honor since 1964. Wildly popular for his tenacious style of play and his power- hitting abilities, Manuel was dubbed \\"Aka-Oni\\" (The Red Devil) by fans and teammates.  1980s  In 1984, Hankyu Braves first-basemen Greg \\"Boomer\\" Wells hit .355, with 37 home runs, and 130 runs batted in, winning the NPB Triple Crown and the Most Valuable Player award. He was the first non-Japanese winner of the Triple Crown. In 1984, at 30 years old, Warren Cromartie became the first, and perhaps the most prominent, American player still in his prime to sign with a Japanese baseball team when he joined the Yomiuri Giants before the 1984 NPB season. In , Cromartie batted .378 with 15 home runs and 78 RBIs to be named MVP of the Central League, and lead his team to the Japan Series championship. In the deciding game of the series with the Kintetsu Buffaloes, Cromartie doubled in the fourth inning to ignite a three-run rally and homered in the seventh. First-basemen Randy Bass is often credited for single-handedly turning around the fortunes of the Hanshin Tigers, which resulted in the team's run and eventual victory of the Japan Series in . Winning the 1985 Most Valuable Player award, he also won four consecutive league batting titles; in , he nearly became the first player in Japan to bat .400, finishing the season with a .389 average, a record that still stands. Bass won consecutive batting Triple Crowns (1985 and 1986). In 1985, he was on a pace to break Sadaharu Oh's record of 55 home runs in a single season, but fell short by one, because in the last game of the season the pitcher from Oh's Yomiuri Giants threw only intentional walks (allegedly to prevent the Westerner from breaking Oh's record).Merron, J. \\"The Phoniest Records in Sports\\". (Feb 2003)., retrieved from ESPN.com on March 29, 2007 In Japan, his spectacular performance is a legend, and among Tigers fans he is nearly deified, being jokingly referred in conjunction with God and Buddha, \\"Kami-sama (God), Hotoke-sama (Buddha), Baasu-sama (Bass)\\" (sama is an honorary variation of \\"san\\", similar to \\"Sir\\" or \\"His holiness\\"). Kintetsu Buffaloes outfielder Ralph Bryant was one of the best left-handed power hitters in Japanese baseball history. In , Bryant hit 49 home runs to lead the Buffaloes to their third Pacific League championship. He won the season MVP award that year, and also tied Sadaharu Oh's career record for hitting three home runs in a game five times. He also struck out countless times, and holds the top four spots on the single-season strikeout records in Nippon Professional Baseball.  1990s  Following a brief Major League career, outfielder Alonzo Powell played for seven seasons in Japan. He was just the third player in Central League history, and the first foreign player, to win three straight batting titles, hitting .324, .355, and .340 from 1994 to 1996. He was also a two-time Central League All-Star. In 1995, Tokyo Swallows third-baseman Tom O'Malley hit .307 with 31 home runs and 87 RBIs. The Swallows won the Japan Series that year, and O'Malley was awarded both the season MVP award and the Japan Series MVP award. He hit .300 for six seasons in a row, a record among non-Japanese players in the Japanese professional leagues. Yokohama BayStars second-basemen Bobby Rose is remembered as one of the best foreign players in Japanese baseball. Rose hit over .300 for seven of his eight seasons in Japan. He also hit three cycles during his career, the most in Japanese baseball history. Rose had his best season in 1999, hitting 37 home runs with 153 RBIs and a .369 batting average. This remains the highest batting average in Japanese baseball among right- handed hitters, and his 153 RBIs ranks second-most in Japanese baseball history. He also led the league with 192 hits, which was a Central League season record. He led the league in hits for the second straight season in 2000, and had the second highest batting average in the Central League.  2000s  Tuffy Rhodes played thirteen years in NPB; he is the all-time home run leader for foreign-born players ‚Äî and tied for 11th overall ‚Äî with 474 homers in Japan. In the season, he hit his 55th homer to tie Sadaharu Oh's Japanese League single season home run record, set in . For the rest of the season, opposing pitchers intentionally walked Rhodes to prevent him from breaking Oh's record. (The following year, Alex Cabrera tied the record.) Rhodes' long career in NPB earned him free agency, in which he was treated as a \\"Japanese Player\\" and not bound to the restrictions of foreign players. Only three other non-Japanese players (Tai-Yuan Kuo, Alex Ram√≠rez, and Alex Cabrera) have achieved such a classification in NPB history. In April 2003, former NPB hitting star Leron Lee was promoted to manager, becoming the first African-American manager in Japanese baseball history. On May 17, 2003, the BlueWave faced the Nippon Ham Fighters, managed by Trey Hillman, for a battle between two American managers in Japan for the first time in 28 years (when Wally Yonamine's Chunichi Dragons faced Joe Lutz' Hiroshima Carp). In 2005, Yomiuri Giants closer Marc Kroon set the record for the fastest pitch ever in Japanese baseball, at 161 km/h (100 mph). In 2008, he broke his own record of pitching to 162 km/h (101 mph). In 2005, Chiba Lotte manager Bobby Valentine led the Marines to their first Pacific League pennant in 31 years after emerging victorious in a close playoff with the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks. The Marines won the Japan Series in a four-game sweep of the Hanshin Tigers. Following their Japan Series championship, the Marines won the inaugural Asia Series by defeating the Samsung Lions of the Korea Baseball Organization in November 2005. For his efforts, Valentine was awarded the Golden Spirit Award and the Matsutaro Shoriki Award ‚Äî both firsts for a non-Japanese individual. Trey Hillman's Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters won the Pacific League championship in 2006, and returned to defend their title in 2007. It was the first pennant for the franchise in 25 years when they won the championship in 2006, and the repeated success in 2007 was accomplished despite the loss of key players such as Michihiro Ogasawara and Hideki Okajima. His team won the Japan Series and Asia Series in 2006. The team set a franchise-record 14-game winning streak during the 2007 season. Following the example of Chiba Lotte Marines manager Bobby Valentine, Hillman showed his appreciation towards fans by speaking in broken Japanese sentences. After the game in which the Fighters won the pennant in 2006, he shouted \\"Shinjirarenai!\\", the Japanese phrase stands for \\"Unbelievable\\", to the fans gathered in Sapporo Dome. He repeated the phrase after winning the Nippon Series, and repeated it again after winning the Asia Championship. Like the Boston Red Sox's \\"The Impossible Dream\\", Hillman's \\"Shinjirarenai\\" became the most popular term describing the Fighters' success in 2006. On October 19, 2007, Hillman signed a multi-year contract to manage the Kansas City Royals. He was the first Major League Baseball manager to be hired based on his Japanese baseball record.Neel, Eric. \\"Could one of these guys be your team's next manager?\\" ESPN Magazine, 17 June 2008.  2010s  In 2010, with 214 hits, outfielder Matt Murton of the Hanshin Tigers broke the NPB single-season hit record, and became only the fourth player in Nippon Professional Baseball history to have a 200-hit season.JapanTimes In 2015, relief pitcher Dennis Sarfate recorded 43 saves, a new record for most single-season saves in the Pacific League. On April 2, 2017, Sarfate recorded his 178th save in Japan, setting a new record for most saves by a foreign pitcher in Nippon Professional Baseball history. On July 4, 2017, Sarfate recorded his 200th save, becoming the sixth pitcher in NPB history to reach that threshold and the first foreign pitcher. On September 5, 2017, Sarfate earned his 47th save of the season, breaking the record for most single-season saves in Japanese baseball history. He finished the season with 54 saves. Sarfate earned two saves and a win in the 2017 Japan Series, and won the Japan Series Most Valuable Player Award.  Notable American players in Nippon Professional Baseball  *George Altman (7 seasons, 1968‚Äì1974) ‚Äî compiled career NPB records of 205 home runs and 656 RBI, along with a .309 batting average and a .561 slugging percentage. *Gene Bacque (8 seasons, 1962‚Äì1969) ‚Äî retired from NPB with 100 wins, a 2.34 ERA, and 826 career strikeouts. *Randy Bass (6 seasons, 1983‚Äì1988) ‚Äî a marginal Major League player for six seasons, Bass took advantage of the differences between Japanese and American styles of pitching, and immediately became the Hanshin Tigers' star slugger. Finished his NPB career with a .337 batting average, a .660 slugging percentage, 202 home runs, and 486 RBI. *Jack Bloomfield (7 seasons, 1960‚Äì1966) ‚Äî career NPB batting average of .315, with a .372 on-base percentage. *Ralph Bryant (8 seasons, 1988‚Äì1995) ‚Äî retired from NPB with 259 career home runs and 641 RBI. *Warren Cromartie (7 seasons, 1984‚Äì1990) ‚Äî upon his arrival in Japan, Cromartie's manager, legendary Japanese slugger Sadaharu Oh, noticed a hitch in Cromartie's swing. He had Cromartie take batting practice with a book under his elbow to correct it. The trick must have worked, as he had ten game-winning RBIs in his first season, and belted over thirty home runs in each of his first three seasons. He originally intended to retire at the end of the 1989 season, but his success prompted him to spend one more season with the Giants. *Orestes Destrade (5 seasons, 1989‚Äì1992, 1995) ‚Äî played five seasons for the Seibu Lions, where he led the league in home runs three consecutive years. *Marc Kroon (6 seasons, 2005‚Äì2010) ‚Äî former all-time leading foreigner in career saves with 177; All-Star led the Central League in saves in 2008 with 41, and won a championship in 2009 with the Yomiuri Giants. *Leon Lee (10 seasons, 1978‚Äì1987) ‚Äî best season came in 1980, when he hit .340, with 41 home runs and 116 RBIs. Career NPB totals include a .308 batting average, a .530 slugging percentage, 268 home runs, and 884 RBI. *Leron Lee (11 seasons, 1977‚Äì1987) ‚Äî at .334, holds the Japanese record for career batting average. Career NPB totals include a .320 batting average, a .542 slugging percentage, 283 home runs, and 912 RBI. *Jim Lyttle (7 seasons, 1977‚Äì1983) ‚Äî the MVP of the 1980 Japan Series, he compiled NPB totals of 166 home runs and 529 RBI. * Gene Martin (6 seasons, 1974‚Äì1979) ‚Äî career NPB totals include 189 home runs (averaging over 30 per season) and 498 RBI. *Charlie Manuel (6 seasons, 1976‚Äì1981) ‚Äî career NPB totals include a .303 batting average, a .604 slugging percentage, 189 home runs, and 491 RBI. *Tom O'Malley (6 seasons, 1991‚Äì1996) ‚Äî as a member of the Hanshin Tigers, he won the Central League golden glove award in , and led the league in on-base- percentage from 1992 to 1995, averaging 20 HRs and a batting average over .300 each season. He introduced Jim Paciorek to the Tigers in 1992, and managed to put the struggling Tigers in second place that year. O'Malley won the batting title in , but left the Tigers in after having issues with manager Katsuhiro Nakamura. He was quickly picked up by the Yakult Swallows in , and played his best season that year, winning both the season MVP award and the Japan Series MVP award. *Steve Ontiveros (6 seasons, 1980‚Äì1985) ‚Äî played for the Seibu Lions, compiling a .312 lifetime batting average and a .394 on-base percentage. *Rodney Pedraza (5 seasons, 1999‚Äì2003) ‚Äî saved 117 games for the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks. *Jim Paciorek (6 seasons, 1988‚Äì1993) ‚Äî Paciorek had actually traveled to Japan during his college years to play in the Japanese college baseball league. After spending several years in the minors, Paciorek played in 48 games for the Milwaukee Brewers in 1987, but then chose to sign with the Yokohama Taiyo Whales in 1988. He ranked second in the league with a .332 average, and won the outfield Best Nine Award that year. He remained one of the league's best hitters, and won the Central League batting title in 1990. Paciorek ended the season with a batting average over .300 for the fourth straight year in 1991, but was cut from the team for hitting only 11 home runs. The Whales had made a bad decision in cutting Paciorek, as he had his best season in 1992 playing with the Hanshin Tigers. Paciorek had joined the Tigers at the suggestion of Tom O'Malley, and he led the league in hits to win a Best Nine Award at first base. He also won the Central League golden glove award. In six NPB seasons, Paciorek had a .315 career batting average. * Alonzo Powell (7 seasons, 1992‚Äì1998) ‚Äî the first foreign player to win three straight batting titles, hitting .324, .355, and .340 from 1994 to 1996. He was also a 2-time Central League All-Star, and finished his NPB career with a lifetime .313 batting average. * Roger Repoz (5 seasons, 1973‚Äì1977) ‚Äî Former Yankees, A's and Angels outfielder was a top slugger for Yakult, hitting 110 homers in four years with the club. He was selected as Best Nine in 1975. *Tuffy Rhodes (13 seasons, 1996‚Äì2005, 2007‚Äì2009) ‚Äî granted free agency by the Boston Red Sox after the season, Rhodes signed with the Kintetsu Buffaloes in the Pacific League. He hit 288 home runs in eight seasons with the Buffaloes. After two years with the Yomiuri Giants (for whom he hit 72 homers), in 2006 he tried to return to the major leagues with the Cincinnati Reds but was released by the team in spring training. He returned to Japan in 2007, signing a one-year contract with the Orix Buffaloes. Rhodes' comeback was a spectacular one, batting .291 and hitting 42 home runs to go with 96 runs batted in. The next season, teamed up with fellow gaijin slugger Alex Cabrera, Rhodes hit 40 home runs and drove in 118 runs. Combined, Cabrera and Rhodes, who earned the nickname \\"Caburo\\" late in the season, slammed 76 home runs and drove in 222 runs. Rhodes' 118 RBI also led the league as the Buffaloes made an improbable run to the playoffs, finishing second in the Pacific League and making their first playoff appearance since their 1996 Japan Series victory. Rhodes finished his NPB career with 464 home runs, a record total for a foreign-born player. *Dave Roberts (7 seasons, 1967‚Äì1973) ‚Äî career NPB totals of 183 home runs and 492 RBI, along with a .524 slugging percentage. *Tony Roig (6 seasons, 1963‚Äì1968) ‚Äî shortstop met the long-ball expectations for American ballplayers by hitting 126 home in six seasons with the Nishitetsu Lions and Kintetsu Buffaloes of the Pacific League. * Bobby Rose (9 seasons, 1992‚Äì2000) ‚Äî after playing only 73 Major League games, the second baseman signed with the Yokohama BayStars in 1992. He led the Central League in RBIs and doubles in his first year (1993), and played in all 130 regular season games from 1993 to 1995. Rose continued his success, showing incredible clutch hitting skills, and greatly contributed to his team's championship in 1998. He won the Central League golden glove award in 1998 at second base. After leading the league in hits for the second straight season in 2000, Rose suddenly announced his retirement in the off-season. The main reasons for his abrupt departure seem to be that his family wanted to return to the United States, and the BayStars also lacked the financial backing needed to renew his massive contract. * Dennis Sarfate (7 seasons, 2011‚Äìpresent) ‚Äî relief pitcher who holds several NPB records, including most single-season saves and most saves by a foreign pitcher. *John Sipin (9 seasons, 1972‚Äì1980) ‚Äî second baseman made five All-Star teams, gaining incredible popularity in Japan, with his huge mat of hair and beard inspiring the nickname \\"Lion-Maru\\" (after the character in the children's television series Kaiketsu Lion-Maru). Sipin was highly entertaining on and off the field, making entrances with extravagant outfits, or fielding ground balls with his batting helmet on. *Daryl Spencer (7 seasons, 1964‚Äì1968, 1971‚Äì1972) ‚Äî career NPB totals include 152 home runs and a .536 slugging percentage. *Joe Stanka (7 seasons, 1960‚Äì1966) ‚Äî retired from NPB with 100 career victories, a 3.03 ERA, and 887 strikeouts. *Greg \\"Boomer\\" Wells (10 seasons, 1983‚Äì1992) ‚Äî over 10 NPB seasons he compiled a .317 batting average and a .555 slugging percentage, with 277 home runs and 901 RBI. *Terry Whitfield (3 seasons, 1981‚Äì1983) ‚Äî excelled for the Seibu Lions, putting up high offensive numbers. In 1981, he batted .316 with 22 home runs and 100 runs batted in. That season he won a Best Nine Award. In 1982, he batted .272 with 25 home runs and 71 runs batted in. And in 1983, he batted .278 with 38 home runs and 109 runs batted in. That year Whitfield was named a Pacific League All-Star and won another Best Nine Award, the second time in three years. *Wally Yonamine (12 seasons, 1951‚Äì1962) ‚Äî played for the Yomiuri Giants and the Chunichi Dragons. A multi-skilled outfielder, Yonamine was noted for his flexible batting style and aggressive baserunning. *Matt Winters (5 seasons, 1990‚Äì1994) ‚Äî outfielder signed with the Nippon Ham Fighters and quickly emerged as the team's best power hitter, hitting over 30 home runs each of his first four seasons in Japan. He recorded the second-most home runs in the league for three consecutive years, behind Cuban slugger Orestes Destrade. He also attracted attention from fans for his avid personality; he frequently participated in between-inning dance performances, and performed magic tricks whenever a game was stopped due to rain. His antics and clutch- hitting made him one of the most popular players in the league. Winters later worked as a scout and coach in the minor leagues before becoming a scout for the Nippon Ham Fighters. Winters' career NPB stats include 160 home runs, 428 RBI, and a .525 slugging percentage. *Tyrone Woods (6 seasons, 2003‚Äì2008) ‚Äî in six seasons, the first baseman compiled 240 home runs and 616 RBI. Earlier in his career he played for the Doosan Bears of Korea's KBO League, and in 2003 Woods became the first man to lead a league in homers in both Korea and Japan.  Notable American managers and coaches  *Don Blasingame ‚Äî after retiring from the Nankai Hawks after three seasons in 1970, \\"Don Blazer\\" joined the team's coaching staff for the next eight seasons. In 1978, he became the third American (after Wally Yonamine and Joe Lutz) to manage in NPB when he took over the Hiroshima Toyo Carp. He then managed the Hanshin Tigers for one-and- a-half seasons before returning to the Nankai Hawks from 1981 to 1982. As manager for the two teams, he compiled a record of 180-208-28 (ties are played in Japanese baseball). *Marty Brown ‚Äî played for the Hiroshima Toyo Carp from 1992 to 1994, then was brought back to manage the Carp from 2006‚Äì2009; managed the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles in 2010. *Terry Collins ‚Äî managed the Orix Buffaloes in 2007‚Äì2008. *Leron Lee returned to Japan to serve as the Orix BlueWave's hitting coach for the 2003 NPB season and was hired as manager later that season. Lasted one season as BlueWave manager. *Tom O'Malley ‚Äî returned to Japan during the Hanshin Tigers spring training camp, and served as a batting coach throughout the season. He was also a mentor for non- Japanese players, including George Arias, Jeff Williams, Trey Moore, and Jerrod Riggan, who contributed to the Tigers' championship in . O'Malley resigned from his coaching job after Senichi Hoshino resigned from his managerial position. He scouted players in the major and minor leagues for the Hanshin Tigers until 2009, and traveled to Japan during spring training to offer advice to non-Japanese players. He has appeared in various television commercials in the local Kansai region (Hanshin Electric Railway Co., Ltd.), and posters featuring O'Malley could be found in Koshien Stadium. *Bobby Valentine ‚Äî in 1995, the former Texas Rangers manager took over as manager of the Chiba Lotte Marines. That season, the team surprised most Japanese baseball fans by finishing in second place (69‚Äì58‚Äì3), a remarkable feat for a team that had (at that time) not won the Japanese Pacific league pennant since 1974. However, Valentine's first tenure ended when he was fired abruptly after a single season due to the personal conflict with general manager Tatsuro Hirooka, despite having a two-year contract. In 2004, Valentine began his second stint as manager of the Chiba Lotte Marines. In 2005, he led the Marines to their first Pacific League pennant in 31 years and a four-game sweep of the Hanshin Tigers in the Japan Series. In 2008, Valentine was the subject of the ESPN Films documentary The Zen of Bobby V. The film followed Valentine and his 2007 Chiba Lotte Marines team. The Zen of Bobby V. was an official selection at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival. The Marines decided to let Valentine go after the 2009 season after an extensive smear campaign led by club president Ryuzo Setoyama, which ironically backfired and resulted in an overflow of support for Valentine by local fans. In the end, Valentine was fired, even though a petition to extend his contract was presented to the organization with 112,000 signatures.

It was among the first publications to be published by women.The Revolution, a weekly newspaper founded by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, had begun publication two years earlier in 1868. It lasted until June 10, 1876.  History  Following Woodhull and Claflin's stock brokerage, the sisters founded Woodhull & Claflin's Weekly using funds from that endeavor. After the weekly's scandals in 1872, landlords refused to rent and the publication briefly ceased circulation. At its height, the publication had national circulation of 20,000.  Content  The Weekly published a variety of articles on such topics as women's suffrage, spiritualism, vegetarianism, free love, and socialism. Most content was written by Woodhull, Claflin, Colonel James Harvey Blood, and Stephen Pearl Andrews. The publication initially carried four pages of advertising, but by 1872, advertisers began dropping off despite threats. The Weekly also blackmailed celebrities and politicians, justifying the articles by saying women must protect themselves if laws and the justice system wouldn't. Throughout its run, the publication chiefly promoted Woodhull's political and reform ambitions, making it the primary propaganda vehicle for Woodhull when she ran for president in 1872. On December 30, 1871, the Weekly was the first in the United States to publish Karl Marx and Frederich Engels's The Communist Manifesto, in English. Woodhull and Claflin felt that the document was important in the context of the progress that the International Workingman's Association was making at the time.  Henry Ward Beecher scandal  On November 2, 1872, Woodhull & Claflin's Weekly published a story featuring Henry Ward Beecher's affair with Theodore Tilton's wife, Elizabeth Richards Tilton. The article made detailed allegations that America's most renowned clergyman was secretly practicing the free-love doctrines that he denounced from the pulpit. The story created a national sensation, and issues were said to have changed hands at 40 dollars apiece. Later that day, Woodhull, Claflin and Col. Blood were arrested and charged with publishing an obscene newspaper and circulating it through the United States Postal Service. In the raid, 3,000 copies of the newspaper were found. It was this arrest and Woodhull's acquittal that propelled Congress to pass the 1873 Comstock Laws. On May 17, 1873, the entire Beecher article was reprinted.Horowitz, Helen Lefkowitz. Rereading Sex. New York: Random House, 2002. In 1874, Woodhull, Claflin and Col. Blood were brought to court again and sued for libel against Luther C. Challis who was also featured in the same issue. The wealthy broker who knew the women when they were on Wall Street was accused of seducing two young girls. The trial lasted ten days and the trio were found not guilty by the jury.

Life Ogborne claimed that her father was Sir John Eliot, 1st Baronet, but her mother was a dealer in tea and the relationship to Eliot is unproven. She married the engraver John Ogborne on 20 March 1790 at St Pancras. Her new husband and father-in-law were both artists. The couple had one son, John Fauntleroy Ogborne (1793‚Äì1813). They lived at 58 Great Portland Street in London, where they were landlords to Euphemia Boswell. The son, John, qualified as a surgeon, but died in his late teens in 1813; and the couple then took up local history. Elizabeth wrote the first part of a History of Essex, her husband supplying engravings. They were assisted by Thomas Leman and possibly Joseph Strutt. The first ‚Äì and, as it turned out, only ‚Äì volume of the History was published in 1817. The book received good reviews in the Gentleman's Magazine, and Ogborne was commended for her learning and precision. However, sales were poor, and the couple ended their days living on charity.

Menorca.jpgMap of Menorca. Localitzaci√≥_de_les_Illes_Balears.pngLocation of the Balearic Islands, off the Mediterranean coast of Spain. The remains which form part of the site belonged to the Talaiotic culture from the Bronze and Iron Ages, although the site continued being occupied during the first centuries of the Roman conquest of the island, since Roman materials can be found on the surface that date back to the first phase of the Roman occupation of Menorca (end of the 2nd and 1st centuries BC). The site could have been reoccupied during the Middle Ages, as is suggested by the location of numerous fragments of Muslim pottery which are scattered around the surface too. The site presents a great state of preservation as several of its structures show. The most significant ones are three talayots or truncated-shape towers built with the cyclopean construction technique, the sanctuary, several hypogea, a large pit possibly for the storage of goods, and other remains, such as a stretch of a wall, among others. The easternmost talayot has an oval layout and its base is 19 meters in diameter. Its fa√ßade is somewhat concave and is oriented to the South. This fa√ßade still preserves an access that leads to an inner chamber whose roof, which consists of large stone blocks that taper toward the top part, is partially preserved. Approximately 200 meters away from this structure the rest of the remains which form part of the settlement are located. In that zone there is a large oval-shape solid talayot which has a maximum width of 20 meters and a maximum height of 5 meters. Its southern side could have presented a set of steps, something that has been already attested in other talayots from other settlements, such as the one in Cornia Nou. This talayot is abutted by a wide wall with a preserved height of 1'5 meters. There is also a third talayot of smaller dimensions and a circular layout. Its northern side has an access to an inner chamber, which is nowadays filled up by rubble from the upper part of the structure. Moreover, this northern side is abutted by a rectangular building whose function has not been determined yet. However, the most important building from Sa Cudia Cremada lies very close to the two talayots that have been just described. it is the settlements sanctuary or Taula enclosure, which present an apse-shaped layout oriented to the South and also built in the cyclopean technique. Its fa√ßade is slightly concave and its entrance seems to be blocked off. Since archaeological excavations haven‚Äôt been carried out yet in this building, the internal structure is still unknown. However, it is supposed to have the T-shape monolithic monument called Taula, which is always present in this type of religious buildings. Sacudiacremadahypogeum.JPGHypogeum or artificial cave necropolis from Sa Cudia Cremada Also there are more structures in the area, such as a large stretch of a cyclopean wall that follows an EW orientation, a large pit covered by a stone slab, a large standing stone, which possibly belongs to a building that is still uncovered by the sediment, and several hypogea or artificial caves. The latter ones were carved through the natural bedrock and used as collective burial sites.

There are no more Beguines living there, but since 1927 it functions as a convent for Benedictines, founded by canon Hoornaert. In the same year the houses at the west side were also reshaped and enlarged into the Monasterium De Wijngaard, a priory of Benedictine nuns. History Already before 1240 a community of pious women settled at the domain 'de Wingarde' (old Dutch for vineyard), in the South of the city. This name probably refers to low-lying meadows. The beguinage was founded around 1244 by Margaret of Constantinople, after she requested permission to Walter van Marvis, bishop of Tournai, to move over the tomb chapel on the Burg of Bruges to the Wijngaard. In 1245 it was recognised as an independent parish. In 1299 it came under direct authority of king Philip the Fair and it was entitled as \\"Princely Beguinage\\". Benedictine nun The complex includes a gothic beguinage church and about thirty white painted houses dating from the late 16th, 17th and 18th century. Practically all of these are built around a central yard. The main entrance with gate can be reached via the three-arched stone bridge, the Wijngaard Bridge. In a bay the image of the holy Elizabeth of Hungary can be seen, who was the patron of many beguinages. De Wijngaard is also devoted to Saint Alexius. The entrance gate was built in 1776 by master mason Hendrik Bultynck. The first Beguine house next to the entrance is furnished as a museum and the exhibition includes paintings, 17th and 18th century furniture and lacework, among others. A second gate gives access to the Sas House, via the Sas Bridge.

She also plays the mridangam and the nagaswaram. She has seven decades of experience in playing the veena. She hails from a family of accomplished musicians that include maestro Lalgudi Jayaraman and her ancestors are direct disciples of Saint Thyagaraja. She is known for her own unique \\"gayaki\\" style. She is huge advocate for the guru-shishya (gurukula) tradition. She has been the guru for numerous artists like Jayanthi Kumaresh (veena) and Usha Rajagopalan (violin). She is also the founder of the Sri Satguru Sangita music school and has over 25 years of active teaching service through the institution. Early days and personal life Padmavathy was initiated into music when she was five by her father Lalgudi Gopala Iyer. She learnt the nuances of playing the veena from him. Her first performance was at the age of twelve. Her ancestors are the direct disciples of one of the greatest composers of Carnatic Music, Saint Thyagaraja. Padmavathy's spouse Ananthagopalan is also a veena and violin exponent. Ananthagopalan teaches playing these instruments to students. Her elder brother was the late violin maestro, vocalist and composer Padma Bhushan Lalgudi G. Jayaraman. Her younger sisters Lalgudi Rajalakshmi and Lalgudi Srimathi Brahmanandam are also violinists. Career Padmavathy plays the veena in the \\"gayaki\\" style wherein she delivers the nuances in the musical instrument like in the vocal rendition. Vidhwan S Balachander was a huge influence on her and she considered him to be her \\"Manaseeka\\" guru (meaning reverentially within one's mind). She observed all the stalwarts and eventually came up with her own unique style wherein every swara is given its due in a raaga. She is an 'A' grade artist and who features regularly in All India Radio and popular Television networks. She has set to tune and Sanskrit works such as Lalita Sahasranamam, Saundaryalahari, Mooka panchasati for the benefit of her students. She has numerous international performances and tours to her credit. Since 1990 she has toured the United Kingdom, the United States, Malaysia and Singapore. In some of these tours she has been accompanied by Jayanthi Kumaresh. She is currently focused on creating more talented veena artists and working towards greater acceptance of veena performances in sabhas (performance halls) that other musical instruments and vocal performances currently enjoy. Books She authored and published two books Shadjam and Rishabam in collaboration with the Singapore Indian Fine Arts Society for students of music. She has also authored a book for the beginners in Carnatic Music titled Abhyasa Manjari. Gurukulam Padmavathy is a highly respected teacher. Her students are spread across the globe and are successful performers of the veena, the violin and vocal forms. She is a big advocate of the gurkula approach for learning music. She has been teacher to numerous students and many have benefitted from the gurukul form of residential learning. Jayanthi Kumaresh, her niece and student for over 22 years is a veena exponent. Usha Rajagopalan, a violinist is her student. Maalavika Sundar, an upcoming classical and light music singer is her student for over 20 years. Design and Maintenance Padmavathy has over 30 veenas in her possession. She is very conversant with the technical nuances of the construct of the instruments and maintains them on her own. She has also made changes to the traditional methods of fixing string and replacing the frets. She has also designed a portable veena that can be dismantled and carried in a knapsack the help of Natesa Achary. This is a helpful innovation as transporting the veena is a huge challenge for artists and is often seen as an impediment for locations where they artists can perform. Sri Satguru Sangita Vidyalaya Based on the suggestion given by vidhwan S Balachander, she established a school exclusively for music in 1988 known as Sri Sadguru Sangita Vidyalaya at Anna Nagar. She has trained more than a thousand students over the last 25 years. Students at the school go through a seven-year course that covers music theory as well.

Marginal land is land that is of little agricultural value because crops produced from the area would be worth less than any rent paid for access to the area.William Baumol, Alan Blinder, Economics: Principles and Policy (2011), p. 409. Although the term marginal is often used in a subjective sense for less-than-ideal lands, it is fundamentally an economic term that is defined by the local economic context. Thus what constitutes marginal land varies both with location and over time: for example, \\"a soil profile with a set of specific biophysical characteristics reported as ‚Äúmarginal‚Äù in the US corn belt may be one of the better soils available in another context\\". Changes in product values ‚Äì such as the ethanol-demand induced spike in corn prices ‚Äì can result in formerly marginal lands becoming profitable. Marginal lands can therefore be more difficult to delineate as compared to \\"abandoned crop lands\\" which reflect more clearly definable landowner-initiated land use changes.Baxter, Ryan E., Kirby E. Calvert. (2017). Estimating Available Abandoned Cropland in the United States: Possibilities for Energy Crop Production Annals of the American Association of Geographers 107(5)1162-1178. https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/24694452.2017.1298985 Land may be marginal for a number of reasons, including poor water supply, poor soil quality, pollution from previous industrial activities, terrain challenges such as excessive slope, or excessive distance from means of transportation.David Pimentel, Global Economic and Environmental Aspects of Biofuels (2012), p. 92. Switchgrass production on marginal land. Experimental plots being mowed for harvest at Cornell University (Ithaca, New York USA) in November 2016. The mixed vegetation strip to the right of the tractor shows the lower productivity of the fallow grassland that covered the site prior to planting of switchgrass in 2011. Marginal land is not entirely useless for human purposes. For example, certain breeds of free-roaming livestock, such as the English Leicester sheep, are able to forage on such land. There are also some plants that can be grown in land that would be considered marginal for most agricultural uses. For example, Cucurbita foetidissima, the buffalo gourd, is well adapted to marginal agricultural lands such as sandy loam soils which have to be well-drained. Land that is marginal for conventional row-crop production is often well-suited to perennial crops, including low-input crops grown as bioenergy or bioproduct feedstocks such as switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), shrub willow (Salix spp.), and giant miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus), allowing production of these crops without inducing competition for prime farmlands.

It has often been dated to around 60 AD on the (possibly wrong) assumption that the theme of the dialogue reflects Seneca's own deteriorating political situation at court.Fritz-Heiner Mutschler in Brill's Companion to Seneca: Philosopher and Dramatist, pages 153-4 [Retrieved 2015-3-14] Title and contents The title when translated into English means on the tranquility of the mind (or) soul. The word animi is translated, in a general sense, as the rational soul, and in a more restricted sense, as the mind as a thing thinking, feeling, willing. T. M.

The superior position ho sophos (the sage) inhabits, of detachment from earthly (terrena) possibilities of future events of a detrimental nature, is the unifying theme of the dialogues.R Bett - A Companion to Ancient Philosophy - p.531 (edited by Mary Louise Gill, Pierre Pellegrin)[Retrieved 2015-3-19] (ed. Bett was source of term ho sophos) Compared with the other two works, the intention of De Tranquillitate Animi is more therapeutic.M. T. Griffin - Seneca on Society: A Guide to De Beneficiis, page 146. Oxford University Press, 14 Mar 2013 [Retrieved 2014-3-14] The work opens with Serenus asking Seneca for counsel, and this request for help takes the form of a medical consultation. Serenus explains that he feels agitated, and in a state of unstable immobility, \\"as if I were on a boat that doesn't move forward and is tossed about.\\" Seneca uses the dialogue to address an issue that cropped up many times in his life: the desire for a life of contemplation and the need for active political engagement. Seneca argues that the goal of a tranquil mind can be achieved by being flexible and seeking a middle way between the two extremes. If we want to achieve peace of mind, Seneca recommends an austere life, oblivious to excessive and useless luxury. He advises us to choose our companions carefully, since if we choose those that are corrupted by the vices, their vices will extend to us (chapter 7). Austerity is the main treatment for peace of mind: we have to learn to know how to contain ourselves, curb our desires, temper gluttony, mitigate anger, to look at poverty with good eyes and to revere self-control (chapter 8). Seneca compares those who have a lot and do not know how to enjoy it to a person who owns a large library of books for mere display (chapter 9). In chapter 11, Seneca introduces the figure of the Stoic sage, whose peace of mind (ataraxia) springs directly from a greater understanding of the world. The sage's complete security and self-sufficiency exclude the unhealthy passions (apatheia), i.e disturbances which cannot upset the person who is, by definition, rational. Only reasoning, caution, and foresight can create in someone the ideal atmosphere of peace. The philosopher, while preserving his peace of mind, does not hate humanity for its injustice, vileness, stupidity and corruption. The times we live in are no worse than the preceding ones, it is not reasonable to waste time raging about these evils, it is more reasonable to laugh at them (chapter 15). Thus the right treatment is to follow nature, find the right balance between sociability and solitude, labour and leisure, sobriety and intoxication, and to \\"watch over our vacillating mind with intense and unremitting care\\" (chapter 17). Later history The first extant copy of the work is as part of the codex Ambrosianus (no. 90), of the Ambrosianus library in Milan, dating from the 11th century A.D.

Cook (June 9, 1963 ‚Äì August 19, 2009) was an American ethnobotanist, humanitarian, and educator who traveled the world studying plants and learning from the healers of various traditions while offering classes with a unique exchange model of 'give what you can; receive what you need'.  Personal life  Cook considered himself a citizen of the world. He touched a large number of people and instilled in them a deep love of the natural world as well as an empowered sense of self. Cook‚Äôs life and passion for living consciously and simply led him to become a repository for plant knowledge. He studied internationally with herbalists, shamans, vaidyas, green witches, doctors, professors, and medicine men and women around the world who initiated him into many ways of understanding plants as medicine. During that time, Cook led hundreds of workshops on re-skilling, specifically through plant identification and botanical family relations. He facilitated mead circles; taught at schools and in homes, gardens and the woods; spoke at conferences; and played a prominent role at educational gatherings around the world. He was a phenomenal teacher. After hearing Frank share his way of seeing the world, many were inspired to connect with nature in some way ‚Äì to eat something wild every day, let their food be their medicine, practice simple living, show up on plant walks, make mead and wild ferments, or create their own herbal remedies for the family. Cook taught about the edible plants in yards and woods. He showed people what plants were medicine and gave medicines he had made from them. He awakened a vibrant herbal movement and graced communities with old knowledge of traditional healers, reminding people to appreciate the whole plant and see plants as allies. He encouraged the pursuit of locally abundant analogue plants to replace the endangered, over-harvested species of the world and to walk the green path. However, Cook did more than just enlighten people about plants. He expanded minds and aroused higher consciousness through his travel journals, his botany talks, and his way of living by donation and by taking people to their edges and asking questions such as, \\"What plants will be with us in this planetary culture rising?\\", \\"How will people show up to help their community transition into these changing times?\\", and \\"How can we best move forward?\\" He firmly believed that we are in the midst of great changes on the planet and that it is our awareness and daily choices that will determine what quality of a future we have as people of one interconnected world. Cook spoke often of how we were quickly becoming one world. His central questions in this respect were: \\"What plants will be in our global gardens and stories?\\" \\"What will our global healing system look like?\\" \\"What are the roles of the human species in the web of life?\\" Cook was very much engaged in a multitude of projects when he passed, full of visions, work and inspiration. He was known to say, \\"I am done with end users,\\" meaning that as we learned this knowledge and way of being he was teaching, it was now our responsibility to pass it on. Cook died of an advanced case of neurocysticercosis, which formed cystic lesions in his brain.  Teaching  From the late 1990s until his death, Cook studied and taught with a wide range of well-known and respected plant teachers including: Dr. James A. Duke, 7Song, Doug Elliott, Alan Muskat, Juliet Blankespoor, Chuck Marsh, Christopher Hobbs, CoreyPine Shane, Greenlight, Daniel Nicholson, John Olmstead, and Sandor Katz. Cook also taught at the Appalachia School of Holistic Herbalism in Asheville, NC as well as online classes using the book Botany in a Day, workshops abroad and led plant walks at Wild Roots and Rainbow Gatherings.  Green Path  Cook also taught at yearly Rainbow Gatherings and founded Green Path in 2006.  Travel  Frank Cook was well traveled, visiting Costa Rica, Southern Africa, Peru, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and more.  Legacy  Frank Cook's life sowed the seeds for the non-profit organization Plants and Healers International which works to \\"network people together regionally and globally for plant walks, transition skills, green path gatherings, and travel to indigenous cultures\\".

Drone strikes are part of a targeted killing campaign against jihadist militants; however, non-combatant civilians have also been killed in drone strikes. Determining precise counts of the total number killed, as well as the number of non-combatant civilians killed, is impossible; and tracking of strikes and estimates of casualties are compiled by a number of organizations, such as the Long War Journal (Pakistan and Yemen), the New America Foundation (Pakistan), and the London-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism (Yemen, Somalia, and Pakistan). The \\"estimates of civilian casualties are hampered methodologically and practically\\";Counting Drone Strike Deaths, Columbia Law School Human Rights Clinic (October 2012). for example, \\"estimates are largely compiled by interpreting news reports relying on anonymous officials or accounts from local media, whose credibility may vary.\\" Total numbers Many scholars, such as Charles J. Dunlap, Geoffrey S. Corn, and Cynthia Marshell, have pointed out systematic weaknessess in counting civilian casualties from non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the media and press outlets- citing the inherent fact they lack (among many things), pre/post strike HD FMV that the US Government has access to. Indeed, according to an Iraq/Syria civilian casualties (CIVCAS) allegation tracker, declassified from CENTCOM - it can be seen how such information often discredits NGO reporting. A declassified, independent, internal review conducted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff - examines data from 2015 to 2017, on all airstrike and artillery data, affirmed delegation of Target Engagement Authority did not increase the rise of CIVCAS events and that Commanders throughout the chain of command exercised thorough oversight, Positive Identification, written guidance were sufficient and adequate in mitigation of civilian casualty risk, including in Areas Outside of Active Hostilities. Leaked documents from the Drone Papers, by The Intercept, have confirmed CT missions (including kinetic air strikes, including dones), during Operation Haymaker in Afghanistan, between 16 September 2011 to 16 September 2012 resulted in 14 CIVCAS events out of 2,082 total missions (0.67%). According to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, between January 20, 2009 and December 31, 2015 and 2016 reports, as well as many other government sources: \\"Non-combatants are individuals who may not be made the object of attack under applicable international law. The term ‚Äúnon-combatant‚Äù does not include an individual who is part of a belligerent party to an armed conflict, an individual who is taking a direct part in hostilities, or an individual who is targetable in the exercise of U.S. national self-defense. Males of military age may be non-combatants; it is not the case that all military-aged males in the vicinity of a target are deemed to be combatants.\\" These reports also cover number of strikes, combatants and non-combatants killed. Between 2009 and 2015, out of 473 strikes between 64‚Äì116 non-combatant deaths occurred. However during that period, the Obama Administration did count all military-age males in strike zones as combatants unless explicit intelligence exonerated them posthumously. These numbers are independently confirmed by then-Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Dianne Feinstein, in a hearing on the 7th of Feb 2013, \\"But for the past several years, this committee has done significant oversight of the government's conduct of targeted strikes and the figures we have obtained from the executive branch, which we have done our utmost to verify, confirm that the number of civilian casualties that have resulted from such strikes has typically been in the single digits.\\" Leaked CIA documents provided to the Washington Post, further confirm the number of CIVCAS events, \\"One table estimates that as many as 152 combatants were killed and 26 were injured during the first six months of 2011. Lengthy columns with spaces to record civilian deaths or injuries contain nothing but zeroes.\\" According to the Long War Journal, which follows US anti-terror developments, as of mid-2011, drone strikes in Pakistan since 2006 had killed 2,018 militants and 138 civilians.Roggio, Bill, and Alexander Mayer, \\"Charting the data for US airstrikes in Pakistan, 2004 ‚Äì 2016\\", Long War Journal, 5 July 2011. Retrieved 11 July 2011. The New America Foundation stated in mid-2011 that from 2004 to 2011, 80% of the 2,551 people killed in the strikes were militants. The Foundation stated that 95% of those killed in 2010 were militants and that, as of 2012, 15% of the total people killed by drone strikes were either known civilians or unknown. The Foundation also states that in 2012 the rate of known civilian and unknown casualties was 2 percent, whereas the Bureau of Investigative Journalism say the rate of civilian casualties for 2012 is 9 percent.Counting civilian casualties in CIA's drone war , Foreign Policy The Bureau, based on extensive research in mid-2011, claims that at least 385 civilians were among the dead, including more than 160 children. It has been reported that 160 children have died from UAV-launched attacks in Pakistan and that over 1,000 civilians have been injured. Moreover, additional reporting has found that known militant leaders have constituted only 2 percent of all drone-related fatalities. These sources run counter to the Obama administration's claim that \\"nearly for the past year there hasn't been a single collateral death\\" due to UAV-based attacks. The New America Foundation estimates that for the period 2004-2011, the non-militant fatality rate was approximately 20%. President Donald Trump, on March 6, 2019, signed an executive order revoking the requirement that U.S. intelligence officials publicly report the number of civilians killed in Counter-Terrorism missions in Areas Outside of Active Hostilities. It's worth noting, however, civilian casualties by global US operations are still reported and made public, pursuant to Section 1057 of the National Defense Authorisation Act of 2018. The Trump administration had previously ignored a May 2018 deadline for an annual accounting of civilian and enemy casualties required under Executive Order 13732 signed in 2016 by Barack Obama.  Afghanistan After more than 30 UAV-based strikes hit civilian homes in Afghanistan in 2012, President Hamid Karzai demanded that such attacks end, but the practice continues in areas of Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter has criticized such use of UAVs: \\"We don't know how many hundreds of innocent civilians have been killed in these attacks ... This would have been unthinkable in previous times.\\"  Pakistan In October 2013, the Pakistani government revealed that since 2008, civilian casualties made up 3 percent of deaths from drone strikes. Since 2008, it alleges there have been 317 drone strikes that killed 2,160 Islamic militants and 67 civilians. This is less than previous government and independent organization calculations of collateral damage from these attacks. S. Azmat Hassan, a former ambassador of Pakistan, said in July 2009 that American UAV attacks were turning Pakistani opinion against the United States and that 35 or 40 such attacks killed 8 or 9 top al-Qaeda operatives.Newsweek, 8 July 2009. Anita Kirpalani, \\"Drone On. Q&A;: A former Pakistani diplomat says America's most useful weapon is hurting the cause in his country.\\" Retrieved on 3 August 2009.  Yemen An attack by the US in December 2013, in a wedding procession in Yemen, killed 12 men and wounded at least 15 other people, including the bride. US and Yemeni officials said the dead were members of the armed group Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), but witnesses and relatives told Human Rights Watch the casualties were civilians. Witnesses and relatives told Human Rights Watch that no members of AQAP were in the procession and provided names and other information about those killed and wounded. They said the dead included the groom's adult son and the bride received superficial face wounds. The local governor and military commander called the casualties a ‚Äúmistake‚Äù and gave money and assault rifles to the families of those killed and wounded ‚Äì a traditional gesture of apology in Yemen. A few days after the incident, Yemeni MPs voted for a ban against the use of drones in Yemen, though it is unclear what effect this will have on drone usage. Criticism There are a number of vocal critics of the use of UAVs to track and kill terrorists and militants. A major criticism of drone strikes is that they result in excessive collateral damage. David Kilcullen and Andrew Exum wrote in the New York Times that drone strikes \\"have killed about 14 terrorist leaders\\". It has also killed an unknown number of militants. But, according to Pakistani sources, they have also killed some 700 civilians. Gr√©goire Chamayou's analysis, of one three hour long surveillance and attack operation on a convoy of three SUVs that killed civilians in Afghanistan in February 2010, shows a typical, if notorious, case. Throughout the operation there is a sense of the drone controllers‚Äô desperation to destroy the people and destroy the vehicles ‚Äî whatever the evidence of their clearly civilian nature. The transcript is full of statements like ‚Äúthat truck would make a beautiful target‚Äù; ‚ÄúOh, sweet target!‚Äù; ‚Äúthe men appear to be moving tactically‚Äù; and ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre going to do something nefarious‚Äù. It is difficult to reconcile these figures because the drone strikes are often in areas that are inaccessible to independent observers and the data includes reports by local officials and local media, neither of whom are reliable sources. Critics also fear that by making killing seem clean and safe, so-called surgical UAV strikes will allow the United States to remain in a perpetual state of war. However, others maintain that drones \\"allow for a much closer review and much more selective targeting process than do other instruments of warfare\\" and are subject to Congressional oversight. Like any military technology, armed UAVs will kill people, combatants and innocents alike. Noted sociologist Amitai Etzioni, writing in a 2013 Military Review article concluded \\"the main turning point concerns the question of whether we should go to war at all.\\" See also *Casualty recording *Global policeman * International law * List of attacks on civilians attributed to United States government forces References Category:War casualties Category:American military aviation Category:Drone strikes ","title":"Civilian casualties from U.S. drone strikes"},{"id":"45671103","text":"Team Heizomat Rad-Net () was a UCI Continental team founded in 2008 and based in Motten, Germany.

On the pediment is the emblem of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, the facade is decorated with six massive Doric half-columns, and there are arched windows on the second floor. It was originally planned to decorate the facade with stucco embellishments, but because of a contemporary movement for simplification (some might say oversimplification) in Soviet architecture these were eliminated. In the 1980s, the appearance of the building was changed to fit the mode of those times; the historical appearance of the building was restored in 2001. At night, the building is illuminated with colored spotlights in the colors of the Russian flag. The Puppet Theater *The Puppet Theater, at 2 Liberty Square was originally built in 1958 as the House of Culture. The 400-seat (later expanded to 500-seat) theater features six full Doric columns in front and stucco embellishments on the pediment. In 1983 the building was, on the initiative of Soviet puppeteering titan Sergey Obraztsov, turned into the permanent home of the Pilgrim puppet theater troupe which had been founded in 1973 by Roman Renz, director of the Kuibyshev Puppet Theater and a People's Artist of Russia; the Pilgrim troupe's first artistic director had been Savely Uralov, succeeded in 1980 by Alexander Rosengarten, who embarked the troupe on tours of cities throughout the Soviet Union (it continues to tour widely).

The building was erected in 1957-1958 to a 1956 design by the precursor to Lengiprogor (), since 1991 named the Urban Institute (Russia) (full name Russian State Institute of Urban Research and Design, ). The design was the outcome of the struggle to eliminate architectural extravagances, which was won by the simplifiers, resulting in particular in a lack of stucco embellishment. The building does feature four Corinthian columns.

Unlike many Turkish artists of her time who were inspired by impressionism and classical art movements, she was an important proponent of Cubism in Turkey. This influence is especially seen in her self- portraits, portraits and still-life paintings.Baran  Biography  Her father was the President of the Ottoman Court of Appeals. Due to a serious illness in infancy, she had to undergo liver surgery at the age of five and suffered from complications for the rest of her life. She attended \\"Notre Dame de Sion French High School\\", a private school for girls in Constantinople,Biography and appreciation @ Turkish Paintings, where she learned to speak English and French. Self-portrait In 1919, at the beginning of the Turkish War of Independence, she was sent to Rome, where she took her first art lessons from her aunt. The following year, she was in Paris, studying with Namƒ±k ƒ∞smail, a family friend. Once she was old enough, her family sent her to Berlin to begin formal studies. Although she had a recurrence of her disease that required surgery on her lungs, she passed the entrance exams for the Prussian Academy of Arts and became a student of Arthur Kampf. Despite her family's problems (including her father's abandoning of her mother for a self-imposed exile in Egypt), she did well at the Academy. In 1924, some of her portraits were published in a local art magazine. She returned home after the war and enrolled at the \\"ƒ∞nas Sanayi-i Nefise Mektebi\\" (School of Fine Arts) where she studied with Feyhaman Duran and ƒ∞brahim √áallƒ±. It was at this time, after her mother's death from tuberculosis in a Swiss sanatorium, that she started using her mother's family name \\"Asaf\\" instead of Salih. She was not at the Art School for long, however, when she won a scholarship from the Ministry of National Education to study in Europe. This took her back to Germany; to the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, where her teacher was Lovis Corinth. In 1926, she had a showing at the \\"Galatasaray Exhibition\\", a major venue for new artists that was held annually from 1916 to 1951 in Istanbul.Hale Asaf memorial page from the Istanbul Women's Museum. From 1927 to 1928 she was back in Paris at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re, studying with Andr√© Lhote and taking private lessons from , a noted ceramic artist, who became her fianc√©. Shortly after, they returned to Turkey. View of Bursa Life in Bursa They settled in Bursa where he had found a teaching position. She also became a teacher at the girls' Normal School (a teacher's college) and the \\"Necati Bey Girls' Art Institute\\". In 1929, she and Oygar were among the founders of the \\"M√ºstakil Ressamlar ve Heykeltra≈ülar Birliƒüi\\" (Independent Painters and Sculptors Association). Because of her cosmopolitan upbringing, she did not adapt well to the provincial atmosphere in Bursa. In one unsettling incident, she fainted after being harassed by a crowd at a bazaar; apparently because they were offended by one of her paintings. She was able to leave Bursa by exchanging jobs with the artist . He took her position at the girls' school and she took his at the \\"ƒ∞stanbul Devlet G√ºzel Sanatlar Akademisi\\" (Istanbul State Academy of Fine Arts). Her unhappiness and depression continued, however and, in 1931, she returned to Paris alone. By the end of the year, she required more surgery. During her convalescence, she met the Italian writer who operated the \\"Galerie-Librarie Jeune Europe\\" and he offered her the position of Director there. Later, they lived together. The gallery closed in 1934 and Aniante's books were banned in some parts of Europe because of his opposition to Benito Mussolini, so the couple's financial situation deteriorated. They were temporarily kept afloat when Albania's King Zog I paid 5,000 Francs for a portrait. By this time, however, Asaf's chronic illness had turned into cancer and she died in the Spring of 1938. Some of her paintings were destroyed during World War II. It is uncertain what happened to the ones that were in Aniante's possession when he died in 1983. A few were sold to Turkish collectors. A survey was conducted from 2001 to 2002 and, altogether, fewer than thirty of her works have been accounted for, although this may be due to a lack of cooperation from the collectors.

She was a certified teacher of book-keeping and office- practice.New York Red Book (1983‚Äì1984; pg. 112) In 1969, she became the Director of the department created by the New York City Board of Education and put in charge of the automation of the payrolls. She also entered politics as a Democrat. Anna Jefferson was a member of the New York State Senate (22nd D.) in 1983 and 1984. In 1984, the Democratic 22nd Senate district organization denied Jefferson a re-nomination, and instead nominated Velmanette Montgomery for the seat. Jefferson tried to challenge Montgomery in the Democratic primary but her petition was rejected ultimately by the New York Court of Appeals. The cover sheet of Jefferson's petition showed 5,074 as the total number of signatures while the petition was signed by only 3,831 registered Democrats. Jefferson claimed that a campaign worker made a simple mistake with a calculator, and only 3,000 signatures were necessary to get on the primary ballot. Nevertheless, the court ruled that this formal error invalidated the petition as a whole.A CLERICAL ERROR COSTS CANDIDATE PLACE ON TICKET by Frank Lynn, in The New York Times on August 30, 1984 She died on June 24, 2011.New York State‚Äôs First Black Female State Senator Dies at 85 in Our Time Press, of Brooklyn, on June 30, 2011 References Category:1926 births Category:2011 deaths Category:Politicians from Columbia, South Carolina Category:Politicians from Brooklyn Category:New York (state) Democrats Category:New York (state) state senators Category:Women state legislators in New York (state) Category:New York University Stern School of Business alumni Category:African- American state legislators in New York (state) Category:African-American women in politics Category:Girls' High School alumni Category:People from Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant, Brooklyn ","title":"Anna V.

In 2006, Shape magazine named Lichtenstein one of ten \\"Women Who Shaped the World\\". Education Lichtenstein earned a B.S. in nutrition from Cornell University, M.S. in Nutrition from the Pennsylvania State University, and M.S. and D.Sc. in nutritional biochemistry from Harvard University. She completed her post-doctoral training at the Cardiovascular Institute, Boston University School of Medicine. Positions Lichtenstein is the Stanley N. Gershoff Professor of Nutrition Science and Policy at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy of Tufts University. She is also director and senior scientist of the Cardiovascular Nutrition Laboratory at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging, and professor of medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine. Lichtenstein is currently a member of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences. She served on multiple National Academy of Sciences committees, most recently the Review of Dietary Reference Intakes for Sodium and Potassium. She is executive editor of the Tufts Health and Nutrition Letter. Research interests Lichtenstein has spent her research career assessing the interplay between diet and heart disease risk factors. In her capacity as director of the Cardiovascular Nutrition Laboratory, Lichtenstein oversees research projects on a wide range of nutrition and cardiovascular disease related topics. Her research interests have included trans fatty acids; soy protein and isoflavones; sterol and stanol esters; modified vegetable oils with different fatty acid profiles, glycemic indexes and biomarkers of nutrient and food intake. Investigations have been conducted in animal models, cell systems, humans, and in population-based studies. Systematic review methods are also applied to the field of nutrition. Diet guidelines for Americans Lichtenstein was vice-chair of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services. She also served on the 2000 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. This committee develops a scientific report that informs the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Lichtenstein is the primary author of the American Heart Association's Diet and Lifestyle Recommendations, and served on the task forces on practice guidelines for the 2013 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology‚Äôs Guideline on the Treatment Of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults and Guideline on Lifestyle Management to Reduce Cardiovascular Risk. Popular press Lichtenstein is a frequent contributor to the media, which can sometimes struggle to report nutrition stories accurately when the science is preliminary.Walter Willett explains that nutrition is important to everyone but the press can be confusing, in: For example, she provided a cautionary note to The New York Times when a 2014 meta-analysis found that saturated fat was not implicated in heart disease. She told Anahad O'Connor that it would be unfortunate if the study resulted in people eating too much butter and cheese. NPR said she wrote a letter to the editor at The New York Times correcting Mark Bittman when he announced that \\"Butter Is Back\\" and that she cited a 2013 review by the American Heart Association that recommends limiting saturated fat. And she explained for The Washington Post that it would be a shame if people overconsumed grass-fed beef in the false hope that it contains a generous amount of omega-3 fatty acids when in fact it contains very little. She gave a summary of the 2015 scientific report for the U.S. dietary guidelines to Hari Sreenivasan for PBS Newshour. Publications Lichtenstein is the author of nearly four hundred peer-reviewed articles and numerous book chapters. In 2005 she co-authored Strong Women, Strong Hearts with Miriam E. Nelson and Lawrence Lindner. She is associate editor of the Journal of Lipid Research. Awards and honors In 2018 Lichtenstein received the Alumni Award of Merit from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and the Supelco Research Award from the American Oil Chemists Society, the first woman to receive the award since its inception in 1968. She received an Honorary Lifetime Membership Award in Recognition of Extraordinary Expertise and Contributions to Clinical Lipidology from the National Lipid Association, and was elected as a Fellow of the American Society for Nutrition. In 2019 she received the Conrad A. Elvehjem Award for Public Service in Nutrition from the American Society for Nutrition.

Built c. 1860, it is the only known house to have foundations and wall exteriors fashioned entirely out of slate. It was built by the Brownville and Piscataquis Slate Company, a local quarrying operation, for its superintendent, and is believed to be unique within New England for the use of material and level of Italianate styling it presents. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Description and history The Slate House is set on a parcel north of the central village of Brownville. It is a two-story structure, roughly square in shape, with a low- pitch hip roof with bracketed eaves. A shed joins the main house to a carriage house at the southeast corner. A wooden trim water table separates the foundation from the first floor, and the front corners of the building have wide wooden pilasters. The west-facing front has three symmetrically-arranged bays, with paired sash windows flanking the centered entrance on the first floor, and single sash windows flanking a round-arch window above the entrance. The house has a wooden frame, which rests on a foundation composed of stacked pieces of slate. The main entrance is accessed by steps fashioned from larger pieces of slate. The front and side facades are covered with scalloped slate shingles. The attached shed and carriage house are also wood- frame structures, but are finished in board-and-batten siding. The interior of the house has retained much of its original finish. Construction of the house was traditionally dated to about 1848, but architectural evidence and the history of the slate quarry suggest a construction date in the early 1860s. Originally called the Crocker Quarry, operations began at Brownville's quarry in 1843 or 1844. Samuel Crocker, the Boston businessman who owned, formed the Brownville and Piscataquis Slate Company in 1855, which reported production 7,000 squares of slate roofing in 1860. The first occupant of this house is believed to be William Sparrow, who served as the quarry's superintendent in the early 1860s. Documentary evidence suggests the house was built by the quarry company as a means to demonstrate varied uses of its material. The house remained part of the quarry property until 1924, when it was sold into private hands; the quarry itself was permanently closed in 1910. Houses built of slate are only known regionally to have been built near slate quarries in Vermont, where all known instances lack the styling of this one. The material was not without problems as a wall finish‚Äîthe cost to heat the house prior to the addition of insulation to its walls was a high 35 cords of wood.

Only by keeping to the middle way does one walk on and live.\\" The term was further refined by Nahuatl-speaking people in Mexico (Aztecs) during the 16th century. During this time, they were being colonized by the Spaniards and the concept of being \\"in between\\" was useful to describe how the experience felt. Some attribute the concept directly to the colonized Aztec, and others have attributed anthropologist, Miguel Leon-Portilla, as first describing the concept. Leon-Portilla further describes how indigenous people who were conquered by the Spanish created their own \\"in between\\" culture. They would leave behind aspects of their culture that they could not synthesize into the new culture. In the arts, nepantla is a creator's imaginary world that encompasses historical, emotional and spiritual aspects of life. Nepantla as a term might also refer to living in the borderlands or being at literal or metaphorical crossroads. Nepantla can also describe individuals or groups who are today in conflict with a larger, perhaps more globally reaching culture or ideology. Nepantla has also been identified as a tool for political change. Individuals who live within two different \\"worlds\\" or \\"cultures\\" can act as \\"fulcrum\\" to engage in political change. Nepantla as a concept has also been identified as a painful experience, where a person's sense of self has been \\"shattered.\\" It can also signify a personal state of \\"invisibility and transition.\\" Writer Gloria E. Anzald√∫a described nepantla as time where individuals experience a loss of control and suffer anxiety and confusion as a result. Nepantla can be described as a \\"liminal\\" space, where multiple forms of reality are viewed at the same time. This concept can be useful when addressing multicultural groups of people where trying to come to a consensus isn't always easy. Allowing individuals to examine concepts that seem to compete and understanding both is also a process of using nepantla.  Quotes  \\"The world is in a constant state of Nepantla.\\"‚ÄîMaria E.

All have been classed as burlesquesHenk Versnel, Coping with the gods: wayward readings in Greek theology, Brill 2011, pp.329-30 that show disrespect to the god involved and some scepticism concerning the efficacy of religious statues as objects of worship.Michael Wojciechowsky, ‚ÄúAncient criticism of religion‚Äù, in Deuterocanonical Additions of the Old Testament Books: Selected Studies, Walter de Gruyter 2010, p.68 Statues of Hermes differed according to function and several are referenced in these stories. Only one fable became generally retold in later times, although two others also achieved some currency. 1 Hermes and the sculptor The fable appears as number 88 in the Perry IndexAesopica] and was to become a favourite in Europe from the Renaissance on. It is directed against self- conceit in general and concerns a visit to a statue maker made in human disguise by the god Hermes. Finding that Jove, the king of the gods, was set at a low price and his queen at only a little more, he felt sure that, since he was their messenger, his own statue must command much more. When he asked about it, however, the sculptor told him that if he would buy the other two statues he could have that one free. A Neo-Latin poem on the theme appeared in Gabriele Faerno's Centum Fabulae (1563) with the moral that 'Many who fancy themselves are set at nothing'.Mercurius et statuarius, p.79 In England prose versions appeared in the collections of Roger L'Estrange (1692)\\"Mercury and the Statuary\\", fable 169 and Samuel Croxall (1722).\\"Mercury and the carver\\" fable 156 In all of these, the name of the Greek god is changed to Mercury, his Latin equivalent. There were also two English verse retellings. In Edward Arwaker's Truth in Fiction (1708), the story is subtitled \\"Vain-glory mortified\\" and is a much more circumstantial account. Statues of the gods are described as currently ‚Äòa drug on the market‚Äô to explain the low price asked and, in addition, the statue of Juno is cheaper since she is a woman.Book 4, Fable 7, p.289 In 1820, Jefferys Taylor wrote a sprightly version for children in which the sculptor assures Mercury that his statue merely serves as a make- weight when a set of the gods is bought.Aesop in Rhyme, pp.30-1 Illustrations of the tale, starting from the miniature in the Greek Medici Manuscript of about 1470, invariably feature the god pointing out his statue to the sculptor.Laura Gibbs Flickr site An English copper engraving by David Jones for the specially commissioned Seven Fables of Aesop (1928) shows an up-to- date sculptor at work on the statue.\\"Hermes and the sculptor\\", the fourth print at the Martin Tinney Gallery site The Australian linocut by John Ryrie is more sly in its updating. The god wears a collar, tie and smart overcoat as he enters into negotiation with the aproned workman. It is only the detail of sandals on his feet and the wings fluttering from beneath the trousers at his ankles that give his identity away.Chrysalis Gallery 2 Hermes and the dog The fable is numbered 308 in the Perry Index and is a broad piece of Greek scatalogical humour.Aesopica There is a poetical version in the Greek of Babrius, but thereafter written accounts do not seem to continue. The Victorian translator of his work, Rev. John Davies, omitted it from his Fables of Babrius (1860),Fable 48, Elfinspell transcription although the story is harmless enough. A dog of a pious turn of mind salutes the god's four-sided herma, a statue of the kind used to mark boundaries and stages along a road. When the animal announces its intention to anoint him, the god hastily begs it not to and says he does not need to be honoured any further. 3 The sculptor‚Äôs dream The story is numbered 307 in the Perry IndexAesopica and there are poetical versions in the Greek of BabriusRev. John Davies, Fables of Babrius, fable 30 and the Latin of Avianus, although the latter account is told of Bacchus.\\"The Pedlar and the Merchant\\", Fable 23 The type of statue involved in this case would be of the god as a handsome young man. Two customers approach the statuary, one wishing to place his work in the tomb of his son, one proposing to use it for private worship. Deciding to sleep on the matter, he is visited by Hermes in a dream and is told that he has in his hands the decision to make him either a dead man or a divinity. Although the fable is light-hearted, the 2nd century physician and philosopher, Galen, gave it a more serious turn by applying the story to human potentiality. In a work on ethics, he tells the fable and then continues by commenting that similarly ‚ÄúYou have a choice between honouring your soul by making it like the gods and treating it contemptuously by making it like the brute beasts‚Äù.The work only exists now in an Arabic translation, Purple Motes site 4 The wish-fulfilling image An 18th century Viennese statue of Hermes the wealth-bringer The fable numbered 99 in the Perry IndexAesopica was not translated into English until it appeared in the substantial collection of Roger L'Estrange under the title ‚ÄúAn image expos‚Äôd to sale‚Äù.Fable 446 A sculptor hawks his newly finished statue at market by declaring that this is a wonder-working god and will profit its owner. When asked why he is selling such a valuable asset, the huckster replies that he is in need of immediate funds while Hermes takes his time in granting favours. Later English versions include \\"The Seller of Images\\" in George Fyler Townsend's Aesop's Fables (1867)Aesopica and V.S. Vernon-Jones' new translation as \\"The Image Seller\\" in 1912.Aesopica 5 The statue and the treasure The story is numbered 285 in the Perry IndexAesopica and was versified in Greek by Babrius, drawing the moral that evil men will only comply when insulted.Fable 119 In this case, the wealth-bringing Hermes does not deliver the expected benefits and his frustrated worshipper smashes the image on the floor. When a flood of gold coins pours from the head, the man reproaches the kind of personality that will not render good for good but does so when ill-treated. While Babrius specifically named the god involved, Hieronymus Osius did not when he versified the fable in Latin,Fable 203 while Pantaleon Candidus specifically states that he does not know in his Latin poem,Homo et statua.Fable 10 Neither did William CaxtonBook 6.6 and Roger L'EstrangeFable 105 say who it is in their English prose versions, which end with reflections on misdirected worship. Jean de la Fontaine is equally reticent about the god's identity in his L‚Äôhomme et son idole de bois (The man and his wooden idol, Fables IV.8).English translation It has been surmised that one explanation for the scepticism of these last two fables was that Hermes was the god of trade and merchants and the Greeks had a certain ambivalence towards wealth making. Christos A. Zafiropoulos, Ethics in Aesop's Fables: The Augustana Collection, Brill 2001, p.111 The 10th century Byzantine Greek lexicon known as the Suda explains what form of statue is involved here. \\"They say Hermes was responsible for profit and an overseer of the businesses: consequently they set up the statue of him weighing a purse.\\"Quoted on Theoi.com] It is to such sculptures that the statue on the stairs of the Winter Palace of Prince Eugene in Vienna can be referred, although it is itself ambiguous. The sculptor rests with chisel in hand on the statue's right as it looks down towards another similarly dressed individual on the other side who raises his hand towards the god. It might therefore remind viewers of the first of the fables here, which was well known. But it is the purse held well away in the god's right hand which seems to be drawing the gaze of the man below, whose hand is cupped as if in supplication. The statue can therefore be read alternatively as referencing either of the last two fables here.

Poore, (1859 ‚Äì 1940) was an American painter and illustrator, known for incorporating human and animal figures into his landscape and genre paintings. He was also a lecturer and critic, and a prolific author on art and composition. Painter and teacher Poore was born on March 21, 1859, in Newark, New Jersey, to Rev. Daniel Warren Poore and Susan Helen Poore n√©e Ellis. He spent his childhood in California, and then studied at the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in 1883. That same year, The New York Times identified him as \\"a promising young Philadelphia painter,\\" and wrote approvingly of his illustrations for a new edition of The Night Before Christmas. Poore studied privately with Peter Moran in Philadelphia, at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts under Thomas Eakins, then at the National Academy of Design in New York City.Henry Rankin Poore, from Philadelphia Sketch Club. He studied further at the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris, where his teachers included √âvariste Vital Luminais and William-Adolphe Bouguereau. He exhibited The Night of the Nativity at the Salon of 1889.The Laurelled Chefs-d'Oeuvre d'Art from the Paris Exhibition and Salon (Philadelphia: Gebbie & Co., 1889), [no page numbers]. Returning to the United States, he opened a studio in Philadelphia, shared with illustrator Joseph Pennell.Joseph and Elizabeth R. Pennell Papers, Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas at Austin. Poore had gone on summer sketching trips to the American Southwest during college, and some of his illustrations were used in The Story of the American Indian (1887).Elbridge S. Brooks, The Story of the American Indian: His Origin, Development, Decline, and Destiny (Boston: Lothrop, Lee & Sheppard Company, 1887). He returned to New Mexico in 1891, sponsored by the U.S. government, to study the Pueblo Indians and report on their living conditions. He painted hunting scenes in England in 1893, including Queen Victoria's stag hounds at Ascot Heath. Poore made his reputation as a \\"Horse and Hound\\" painter, but his subjects ranged widely. One critic wrote of a retrospective of his works: \\"In his long career ... he wielded a versatile brush and his exhibition reveals a catholicity of view which embraces with equal enthusiasm the hunting field, the New England farmer and the character revealed by the face before the portrait painter.\\" He taught at the Chautauqua Summer Art School in western New York, and served as its director from 1896 to 1902. He was one of the founders of the summer artists' colony at Old Lyme, Connecticut. He lectured at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts beginning in 1904. Honors and awards The National Academy of Design awarded Poore its Second Hallgarten Prize (for Foxhounds) in 1888. The American Art Association awarded him its 1889 grand prize of $2,500 for The Night of the Nativity. He exhibited that painting and The Bridge--Close of a City Day at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. He exhibited Foxhounds at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, and was awarded a bronze medal. He exhibited In Holland, The End of the Trail and A Frosty Morning at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, and was awarded a silver medal. His exhibit at the 1910 International Exposition in Buenos Aires was awarded a gold medal. Poore exhibited works in the annual exhibitions of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, most years between 1878 and 1936.Peter Hastings Falk, The Annual Exhibition Record of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (Madison, CT: Sound View Press, 1989), vol. 2, p. 385; vol. 3, p. 375. The National Academy elected Poore an associate member in 1888. He was a member of the Philadelphia Sketch Club and the Philadelphia Art Club. In New York City, he was a member of the Lotos Club and Salmagundi Club. His work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics.

He recommended both painters and photographers to consider how to use the fundamental forms he presented to draw the viewer \\"into the picture\\", including, in one critic's summary, \\"left-right balance and the aesthetic application of triangles, circles, crosses, S-curves, and rectangles\\".

It tells the story of a Danish military company in Afghanistan that is fighting the Taliban while trying to protect the civilians, and how the commander is accused of having committed a war crime. The film was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 88th Academy Awards. Plot A Danish soldier in a squad patrolling Helmand province sets off an IED. He dies from horrific injuries while his commander, Claus, can do little to help back at base camp. After that Claus resolves to join his men on every patrol. After treating an injured little girl, the Afghan family comes to the Danish base because the Taliban has threatened to kill them for asking for help. Claus makes the decision to send them back to their village. Meanwhile, back in Denmark, Claus' wife Maria is trying to hold everyday life together, with a husband at war and three children missing their father. The strain their father's absence takes on the family is seen as the burdens of parenting fall on Maria herself. The next day, Claus and his men return to the village only to find the Afghan family they had helped earlier murdered in their home. Without warning, an ambush by insurgent forces ensues. Claus, in the confusion of battle, calls in an airstrike on a nearby compound, though he knows he lacks proper identification (PID) of the enemy combatants. This decision allows the Danish troops to retreat from their position without any loss of life. However, back at base, Claus is charged with the killing 11 innocent civilians and is sent home. The grave consequences of these accusations shake him and his family. Claus' defense lawyer asserts that he needs to claim that he had PID in order to avoid a prison sentence. Though he plans to admit his guilt, Maria angrily admonishes him for not thinking of his children's lives without a father. He decides to claim he called in an airstrike because he had PID. Evidence mounts as Claus' men testify in court. His close friend and comrade, who had known him since boot camp, testifies that Claus, despite being a good officer, was feeling the strain of leadership and making rash decisions. In the witness box, Claus maintains his position. After being probed by the prosecution, he angrily declares that anyone who has never been in combat can never understand what it takes to make life and death decisions. Unexpectedly, Claus' former radio operator testifies that he identified muzzle flashes in the compound, giving Claus a plausible reason to call the airstrike. Though this evidence is dubious, it is enough to convince the judge and sub-committee that Claus had a legitimate PID. Later while tucking his young son into bed, Claus notices how his son's feet resemble those of the murdered little girl in Helmand. He sits alone outside looking at the night sky.

With the rise of the ISIS, Tufail has been tracking the reactions in the Muslim community and highlighting the calls for reform from within the community.Ahmad, Tufail. Muslim Liberals Vs ISIS, New Indian Express, 3 March 2015. In early 2016, Tufail Ahmad's book Jihadist Threat To India -- The Case For Islamic Reformation By An Indian Muslim was published in India. The book was launched by Shri Kiren Rijiju, India's federal minister for home affairs, at a ceremony held at the Vivekananda International Foundation (VIF) in New Delhi on March 31, 2016. At the book launch, other eminent personalities who spoke alongside Rijiju included: former Indian Army chief General N.C. Vij, former Research & Analysis Wing (RAW) chief Shri Vikram Sood, former Indian Army commander Lt.-Gen. Ata Hasnain, and Pakistan affairs expert Sushan Sareen. Speaking at the launch of his book, Ahmad accused the Indian state of handing over its responsibility of teaching Muslim children to madrassas (Islamic seminaries) which he described as counter-liberty movements; and while stressing the need for Islamic Reformation, he called for teaching mathematics, economics and physics to Muslim girls from Grade 1 through Grade 12. In a review of his book, American Indologist Dr. David Frawley described the author in these words: \\"Tufail Ahmad is a powerful and provocative voice for reform in Islamic society and in India in particular. He is also a key expert on national security issues in India, which is under siege by jihad.\\"  Advocacy of Reform  On 30 November 2016, Tufail Ahmad unveiled a 12-point document, in which he proposed a \\"blueprint\\" for a Uniform Civil Code for India. The document was named \\"the Universal Bill of Rights for the Indian Citizen\\" and was written by Ahmad in collaboration with two others, Satya Prakash and Siddharth Singh. Effectively, Tufail Ahmad is the first Indian to have authored a Uniform Civil Code to further debate about this subject among Indians. In January 2018, Ahmad critiqued The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2017 passed by the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament. Ahmad said the bill fell short of reform for Muslims. With the aid of Smita Dikshit, a legal counsel practicing in the Supreme Court, Ahmad authored an alternative bill to raise awareness about Muslim issues called The Muslim Family Reforms Bill, 2018.  Reception  Tufail Ahmad's employer, MEMRI, is alleged to be a pro-Israeli organisation that selectively presents Muslim sources to show them in a negative light.Brian Whitaker, Selective Memri, The Guardian, 12 August 2002.

Yuristy was inducted as a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts in 2014. Life and career Yuristy was born in 1936 in Goodeve, Saskatchewan. He earned a BA from the University of Saskatchewan in 1959. He continued his studies at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison earning an MSc in Art in 1967. Yuristy returned to the University of Saskatchewan as instructor from 1967 to 1971. In 1969 and 1971, he also was employed as workshop coordinator at the Emma Lake Artist's Workshops. David Gilhooly arrived in Regina in the fall of 1969 to begin a two-year period teaching ceramics at the University of Regina. His California Funk work contrasted sharply with the more formal abstraction dominant in the department at his arrival. Yuristy and his colleague Joe Fafard were sympathetic to the concerns addressed by Gilhooly's approach and began to incorporate them into their own work. Fafard included a portrait of Yuristy in the series of plaster busts he made of his department colleagues in 1970 and Gilhooley included a casserole referencing Yuristy in his show Baboons Viewing an Exhibition of Frog Art from the same year. Yuristy set up a studio in Silton, Saskatchewan in 1970 where he worked on ink drawings of both animals and humans travelling in imaginary vehicles. Fafard suggested that Yuristy might take these drawings and turn them into actual constructions. This led to a successful application to fund the creation of playground structures and the eventual formation of the Creative Playground Workshop. Yuristy designed and built playground sculptures in the form of animals in Ottawa, Spokane (for Expo 74), Churchill, Vancouver (for Expo '86), Swift Current, Saskatoon and Regina. Fafard introduced Yuristy to working in clay in 1972 and he included Yuristy's work in the 1973 show 'The Regina Ceramists' which drew national attention to the Regina ceramics scene. Over the next few years, this led to exhibition opportunities outside of Saskatchewan for Yuristy with other Regina artists even though he later put aside his work in clay to concentrate on large public sculpture, painting and printmaking. Notably this included the national survey exhibition 'Canada Trajectoires 73' organized by the Canada Council and held in Paris at le Mus√©e d'art moderne de la Ville de Paris. In 1981 the Dunlop Art Gallery organized 'Russell Yuristy, Sculpture 1971‚Äì1981 in Photographs and Drawings', which toured to the Swift Current National Exhibition Centre. Yuristy began teaching at the University of Ottawa in 1986 and later at the Ottawa School of Art. He moved to Montreal in 1993 and then returned to Ottawa in 1998.

After helping to raise the three daughters of her widowed brother, in her forties she became involved in the pacifist movement. She founded the Wisbech Local Peace Association, which grew to have 6,000 members. She was active at a national level with the Peace Society and worked with pacifist groups in several other countries. She funded and edited the journal Peace and Goodwill: a Sequel to the Olive Leaf for almost fifty years, and funded publication of an Esperanto version of the Bible. She was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize on four occasions. Background Priscilla Hannah Peckover was born on 27 October 1833 in Wisbech, Isle of Ely, Cambridgeshire. She was the third of eight children of Algernon Peckover (1803‚Äì1893) and Priscilla Alexander (‚Äì1883). Her brother was Alexander Peckover, 1st Baron Peckover (1830‚Äì1919). Her family were wealthy Quaker bankers and philanthropists. She was privately educated, although for a short period she went to school in Brighton. She devoted herself to raising her three nieces after her brother Alexander's wife Eliza died in 1862. On 20 November 1877 Peckover was recorded a minister of the Society of Friends. Local activism in Wisbech When Priscilla Peckover was in her forties she began to actively participate in the peace and reform movements. After the girls had grown up, she moved to Wisteria House in Wisbech, to be her home for the rest of her life. In 1878 she learned of E.M. Southey's work with the Women's Peace and Arbitration Auxiliary of the Peace Society. Peckover was indignant when she learned that only 200 women belonged to the organization. The Auxiliary approved her proposal for a short declaration, \\"I believe all war to be contrary to the mind of Christ ... and am desirous to do what I can to further the cause of Peace\\", to be signed by \\"women of all ranks\\". She began a door-to-door campaign asking for signatories to the declaration, with a one penny subscription. Peckover's declaration was later translated into French, German, Polish and Russian. Peckover founded the Wisbech Local Peace Association (WLPA) in 1879 to encourage women to campaign for peace through arbitration and disarmament. Christian beliefs were the justification for condemning war. Peckover proved to be an extremely effective organizer at the grass roots level. Her background led her to use collaborative and conciliatory methods, in contrast to the more defensive and less cooperative approach of the Peace Society. The WLPA had 6,000 members after ten years. In 1888 Peckover converted her group into a \\"Local Peace Association Auxiliary\\". The implication was that the Peace Society was not providing the national leadership needed to support local peace activism. Peace Society leader Lewis Appleton organized the International Arbitration and Peace Association (IAPA) in 1880. Unlike the Peace Society the IAPA accepted defensive war, was not restricted to Christians and claimed to be international. It also allowed women on the executive committee. In the spring of 1882 E.M. Southey, the main founder of the Ladies Peace Association, persuaded her group to disaffiliate from the Peace Society and join the IAPA. Peckover played a central role in organizing a new ladies auxiliary of the Peace Society that was launched on 12 July 1882. During the 1880s the Peace Society stagnated. Its Ladies' Peace Association was much more dynamic, and claimed 9,217 members by the summer of 1885, of which 4,000 belonged to Peckover's Wisbech group. In 1889 Peckover was invited to join the executive committee of the Peace Society. Instead, she chose to become one of the society's vice-presidents. Other activities Fredrik Bajer. Peckover translated and published his work in English. In the 1880s and 1890s Peckover traveled to various international conferences and worked for the Peace Society, its women's Auxiliary, the International Peace Bureau and the IAPA. Peckover made contact with groups in France, Germany, Scandinavia, Italy, Switzerland, Spain, and Denmark. Other Local Peace Association branches were founded elsewhere in Britain and as far abroad as New Zealand and Japan, but the Wisbech branch remained the largest and the centre of the movement. Louis Barnier of N√Æmes, who founded the precursor of the French Peace Through Law Association in 1887, met Peckover while he was a student in England. From the Quakers he became converted to the concept of peace through arbitration. Peckover met Fredrik and Matilde Bajer at a Nordic Women's meeting in 1888. She paid Matilde Bajer's expenses so that she could participate in international peace meetings. Peckover launched the quarterly Peace and Goodwill: a Sequel to the Olive Leaf in 1882, and edited and funded the journal for the rest of her life. The journal called for a court of nations, and for the reduction and eventual elimination of armed forces. It mainly discussed absolute Christian pacifism and the peace movement, but also included criticism of the oppressive practices of the British Empire. The WLPA published many tracts giving short tales that illustrated moral points. Peckover translated various Danish works on pacifism into English, including works by Fredrik Bajer and Wilhelm Carlsen. Peckover became handicapped with rheumatism at the start of the 20th century. For the last thirty years of her life she did not travel much and spent most of her time on her journal and the WLPA. Peckover was also President of the Ladies' Temperance Committee, which distributed literature in Wisbech and the neighboring suburb of Walsoken. Peckover was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1903, 1905, 1911 and 1913, but did not receive the award. During World War I (1914‚Äì18) she continued to support the pacifist cause and was a signature of the Open Christmas Letter in 1914. Priscilla and her sister Algerina Peckover (1841‚Äì1927) provided financial assistance for the preparation and publication in Britain in 1926 of an Esperanto version of the Bible. Priscilla Hannah Peckover died on 8 September 1931 in Wisbech, aged 97.

The original version was released in 2013 and built on top of AngularJS and Apache Cordova. However, the latest release was re-built as a set of Web Components, allowing the user to choose any user interface framework, such as Angular, React or Vue.js. It also allows the use of Ionic components with no user interface framework at all.https://blog.ionicframework.com/introducing-ionic-4-ionic- for-everyone/ Ionic provides tools and services for developing hybrid mobile, desktop, and Progressive Web Apps based on modern web development technologies and practices, using Web technologies like CSS, HTML5, and Sass. In particular, mobile apps can be built with these Web technologies and then distributed through native app stores to be installed on devices by utilizing Cordova or Capacitor.  History  Ionic was created by Drifty Co. in 2013. After releasing an alpha version of the framework in November 2013, a 1.0 beta was released in March 2014, a 1.0 final in May 2015, and several 2.0 releases in 2016. Since January 2019, Ionic 4 allows developers to choose other frameworks apart from Angular like React, Vue.js, and web components.  Services and features  Ionic uses Cordova and, more recently, Capacitor plugins to gain access to host operating systems features such as Camera, GPS, Flashlight, etc. Users can build their apps, and they can then be customized for Android, iOS, Windows, Desktop (with Electron), or modern browsers. Ionic allows app building and deployment by wrapping around the build tool Cordova or Capacitor with a simplified 'ionic' command line tool. Ionic includes mobile components, typography, interactive paradigms, and an extensible base theme. Using Web Components, Ionic provides custom components and methods for interacting with them. One such component, virtual scroll, allows users to scroll through a list of thousands of items without any performance hits. Another component, tabs, creates a tabbed interface with support for native- style navigation and history state management. Besides the SDK, Ionic also provides services that developers can use to enable features, such as code deploys, automated builds. Ionic also provides its own IDE known as Ionic Studio. Ionic also provides a command-line interface (CLI) to create projects. The CLI also allows developers to add Cordova plugins and additional front-end packages, enable push notifications, generate app Icons and Splash screens, and build native binaries.  Supported platforms  For Android, Ionic supports Android 4.4 and up. For iOS, Ionic supports iOS 10 and up. Ionic 2 supports the Universal Windows Platform for building Windows 10 apps. Ionic Framework, based on Angular.js, supports BlackBerry 10 apps.  Performance  Ionic apps run with a mixture of native code and web code, providing full access to native functionality if necessary, with the bulk of the UI of the app built with standard web technology. Ionic utilizes native hardware acceleration features available in the browser (such as CSS animations), and optimizes rendering (avoiding expensive DOM manipulation). Ionic leverages CSS transitions and transforms for animation as a way to leverage the GPU and maximize available processor time.  Installation  Ionic is an npm module and requires Node.js.https://ionicframework.com/getting-started  References   External links  * * Category:Ajax (programming) Category:Free software programmed in JavaScript Category:HTML5 Category:JavaScript libraries Category:Software using the MIT license Category:Rich Internet application frameworks Category:Software frameworks ","title":"Ionic (mobile app framework)"},{"id":"45671600","text":"Grzegorz Stƒôpniak (born 24 March 1989) is a Polish professional racing cyclist, who currently rides for UCI Continental team .

It is located on the west side of the same-named island, south of the village of Sunset. Designed by William Ralph Emerson and built in 1897, it was for one year the summer home of the famous landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted in a bid to improve his failing mental health. Olmsted, then retired and severely affected by senility, was later committed McLean Hospital in Massachusetts, where he died in 1903. The house is a high-quality example of Shingle style architecture; it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description and history The Olmsted house is perched on rocky crag above a cove on the west side of a peninsular lobe of Deer Isle south of the village of Sunset. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, roughly T-shaped, with a hip roof across its main block and a gable section that projects over the rocky shore. The house rests in part on a fieldstone foundation and in part directly on the bedrock of the shore. The house is characterized by numerous porches, gables, dormers, and projecting sections, with expansive use of windows to give fine views accorded by its location. The impetus for the house's construction came from Frederick Law Olmsted's wife Mary. The Olmsted had traveled to England in a bid to combat his increasing senility, but he became depressed by the English climate. Mary asked their son Frederick Jr. to build them a summer retirement home in Maine. The younger Olmsted retained Boston architect William Ralph Emerson, already noted for his Shingle style designs and work in Maine, to design the house, which was built in 1897. His plans included landscape work which was intended to stimulate the elder Olmsted's decreasing mental faculties. The Olmsteds moved in in 1897, but he was not happy, and his condition continued to deteriorate. The following year he was committed to McLean Hospital in Massachusetts, where he died in 1903.

They were formed after a schism in the Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners (LGSM) movement, in November 1984. Members of the organisation were involved in picket line protests against the delivery of coal to the factories by strikebreakers.  History  LAPC originated when a number of LGSM members decided they needed a women-only space for lesbians, due to issues concerning sexism, misogyny and lesbophobia among males in the LGSM movement. Ray Goodspeed, an LGSM member, says that: \\"The men in the meetings were generally like men in most meetings,\\" and according to founders of LAPC, when the issues of a lesbian-only organisation were discussed in LGSM, \\"they [LGSM members] often snorted with derision\\". LAPC was also formed as a group to give women a voice, as with Women Against Pit Closures, to help bring feminist ideas into a working men's sphere, such as a miners' institute. Some women said they were intimidated by the gay men who made up the bulk of LGSM membership.All Out! Dancing in Dulais (film) quoted in 1984. Politics: Lesbians Against Pit Closures sourced at http://www.gayinthe80s.com/2014/09/1984-politics-lesbians-against-pit- closures/ Aug 20/2015 The alliances which the campaign forged between LGBT and labour groups also proved to be an important turning point in the progression of LGBT issues in the United Kingdom. Miners' labour groups began to support and endorse and participate in various LGBT pride events throughout the UK; at the 1985 Labour Party conference in Bournemouth, a resolution committing the party to support LGBT equality rights passed for the first time due to block voting support from the National Union of Mineworkers; and miners' groups were among the most outspoken allies of the LGBT community in the 1988 campaign against Section 28.  Activities and fundraising  LAPC used similar fundraising tactics to LGSM, such as collecting outside lesbian bars, clubs and other establishments. They also put on women-only benefit concerts and attempted to \\"involve other people in what [they were] doing,\\" such as collecting outside supermarkets. With LGSM, they were a part of a short promotional film about the two group's unified work during the Miners' Strike called All Out! Dancing in Dulais.  Depiction in Pride  The film Pride, which depicted the unity of LGSM and the Onllwyn mining community in Wales, also mentioned the LAPC splinter organisation.

She was a cellist with the Grammy-winning string band Carolina Chocolate Drops but left to focus on her solo career. Background Both of McCalla's parents were born in Haiti. Her father Jocelyn McCalla was the Executive Director of the New York-based National Coalition for Haitian Rights from 1988 to 2006 and is credited as translator on her album Vari-Colored Songs. Her mother R√©gine Dupuy arrived in the United States at age 5, and is the daughter of Ben Dupuy who ran Ha√Øti Progr√®s, a New York-based Haitian socialist newspaper. McCalla's mother went on to found Dwa Fanm, an anti- domestic violence human rights organization. McCalla's younger sister, Sabine McCalla, is also a musician in New Orleans.

Accessed January 15, 2020. \\"Leyla McCalla has traveled a winding path as a musician, from the European classical canon to the folkways of her Caribbean heritage. Born into a Haitian-American family in Queens, she was raised in Maplewood, and brought up in the New Jersey public school system.\\" where she attended Columbia High School. She lived in Accra, Ghana for two years as a teen. After a year at Smith College, she transferred to New York University to study cello performance and chamber music. In 2010 she then moved to New Orleans where she honed her craft playing music on the streets of the French Quarter. In addition to cello, she also plays banjo and guitar. Career From 2011 to 2013, McCalla was a member of the Carolina Chocolate Drops. As of 2019 she is a member of Our Native Daughters. As of 2017, McCalla was touring with her New Orleans-based trio, which also included her Qu√©b√©cois husband Daniel Tremblay on guitar, banjo, and iron triangle (ti fer); and Free Feral on vocals and guitar. As of 2019 into 2020, McCalla has been touring with her Leyla McCalla Quartet, which also includes New Orleans musicians Dave Hammer (electric guitar), Shawn Myers (drums/percussion), and Pete Olynciw (electric and acoustic bass). First album McCalla's critically acclaimed album Vari-Colored Songs is a tribute to Langston Hughes which includes adaptations of his poems, Haitian folk songs sung in Haitian Creole, and original compositions. McCalla says the first song she wrote for the album was \\"Heart of Gold\\" because it provided \\"a window into Hughes' thinking\\". McCalla chose to dedicate this work to Hughes because she says \\"reading his work made me want to be an artist.\\" McCalla started working on the album 5 years prior to its release. Commentators have noted the influence of Louisiana musical traditions such as old Cajun fiddle melodies and trad-jazz banjo on the album. Members of the Carolina Chocolate Drops appear on the album. The album was financed at least in part through a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter which exceeded its goal of $5,000 to raise $20,000. Personal life As of 2019, McCalla is married to fellow musician, and electrician, Daniel Tremblay. They live in the New Orleans area and have three children.

It is also called NSPUM (). The scope weighs 2 kg and measures 458 mm √ó 186 mm √ó 99 mm (length √ó height √ó width). It is attached onto a matching side rail on the weapon after which a lever on the scope is pressed to hold it in place. The 1PN58 comes in a metal container with room for extra batteries, battery charger and the other accessories, weighing 7.3 kg in total. Optics The scope gathers light into a refractor which can be protected with an aperture cover. The center of the cover has a circular aperture with dark glass allowing the scope to be used in light conditions that would otherwise saturate the light intensifier. For zeroing the sight the left side of the scope has two perpendicular knobs, of which the elevation knob has a detachable scale. The scope comes with seven different, detachable elevation scales, one for each of the supported weapons. The eyepiece has a detachable soft rubber eyecup. The scope has a magnification of 3.5. Light Intensifier and Reticle On the left below the aperture the device has a brightness knob. Apart from powering on and off the device, this knob controls the brightness of the reticle allowing for the reticle to be visible without outshining the target. The reticle has markings that match targets of various heights from 0.3 m to 2.7 m at distances ranging from 100 m to 970 m. This is similar to the reticle of the 1PN51. Power The light intensifier is powered by a pack of 5 D-0,55S () rechargeable cells, providing up to 7 V. The scope requires 6.25 V. The current drawn is 7 mA. The D-0,55S battery pack is used by a range of devices including 1PN51 and 1PN51-2 and has a separate charging device. The charging device has a switch to select one of 12 V or 27 V input and two red control lamps, one to indicate that power is available and one to indicate that charging is complete. Supported Weapons 1PN58 mounted on a RPK-74N2 As of 1991 the 1PN58 can be used with the following weapons (weapons on the same line share the elevation scale): SVDN2, AK-74N2 (AKS-74N2), PKMN2 (PKMSN2), RPG-7N2 (RPG-7DN2), AKMN2 (AKMSN2), RPK-74N2 (RPKS-74N2), RPKN2 (RPKSN2), AK-103N2 (AK-103N2).

H. hydrogeninformans was first discovered by Melanie Mormile, professor of biological sciences at Missouri University of Science and Technology and her team, from Soap Lake, Washington. Microbiology Halanaerobium hydrogeninformans is obligatory anaerobic, Gram negative, non motile, non-sporulating, elongated rod bacterium, that can tolerate the extreme conditions of both high salinity and alkalinity of its environment, with optimal growth at pH 11, 7% NaCl. It belongs to phylum Firmicutes, it can ferment a variety of 5- and 6-carbon sugars derived from hemicelluloses and cellulose including cellobiose, and forms the end products hydrogen, acetate, and formate. Genome structure The H. hydrogeniformans genome sequence was determined through a combination of Illumina and 454 technologies. The total genome size is 2,613,116 bp. The genome is 33.1% G+C and contains 2,295 candidate protein-encoding gene models. The genome contains four separate rRNA operons, each containing a 5S, a 16S, and a 23S rRNA gene, with 99.9 to 100% identity between 16S rRNA genes. Applications As the price of fossil fuels increases and reserves diminish, biofuel production is seen as a viable contribution to current, as well as future energy demands, Halanaerobium hydrogeninformans can use several pure sugars for hydrogen production, Hence, this bacterium can potentially increase the efficiency and efficacy of biohydrogen production from renewable biomass resources.

The primary body of the binary system has a rotation period of 3.3 hours, while the secondary's orbital period remains unknown.  Orbit and classification  is a member of the Apollo asteroids, a group of near-Earth object with an Earth-crossing orbit. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.0‚Äì2.8 AU once every 2 years and 7 months (939 days; semi-major axis of 1.88 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.48 and an inclination of 13¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at with its official discovery observation at Catalina Station in December 2014.  Close encounters  It passed by Earth on 27 March 2015 at 06:21 UTC at a distance of , or 11.7 lunar distances, and a relative speed of . next encounter with Earth will be in 2033, at a distance of approximately .  Satellite  The Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex was scheduled to observe this object on 20 March 2015, at which time it was expected they could obtain coarse radar images and continuous wave spectra, which may help determine the asteroid's composition. These observations showed a small companion less than 150 meters across orbiting the asteroid, with an unknown orbit.  Numbering and naming  This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 25 September 2018 (). As of 2018, it has not been named.

It is found in the Atlantic Ocean. It was first described by the Danish missionary and naturalist Otto Fabricius in 1780. Description Beroe cucumis has a transparent, sac-like body, often somewhat compressed, and reaches a maximum length of about . The wide mouth is at one end. The body has eight longitudinal rows of cilia that extend from the aboral end (opposite end to the mouth), three quarters of the way along the animal. The cilia are arranged on short transverse plates and beat in synchrony to propel the animal through the water, giving a shimmering effect. The general body colour is pink, especially along the rows of cilia, and the plates are bioluminescent. There is a figure of eight shaped ring of small papillae around the aboral tip. Gastrovascular channels extend from the stomach through the body wall beneath the rows of cilia, and these have short side branches, which distinguishes Beroe cucumis from the otherwise similar Beroe gracilis. Juveniles of the two species are indistinguishable. Distribution Beroe cucumis is found in the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea, including the Skagerrak and the Kattegat. It sometimes occurs in the Mediterranean Sea. It is a pelagic, open water species and its depth range is not known. Ecology Beroe cucumis is a predator and mostly feeds on other comb jellies, particularly Bolinopsis infundibulum; these are pulled into the large mouth and swallowed whole. The comb jelly Mnemiopsis leidyi is an invasive species originally native to the western Atlantic coastal waters that was introduced into the Black Sea in the 1980s, with deleterious results to the ecosystem. Since then it has spread to the Caspian Sea, the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. In the Black Sea, some measure of control was achieved when another predatory comb jelly, Beroe ovata, was introduced. Mnemiopsis leidyi was first recorded in the Mediterranean Sea in 1990 and in 2009, large swarms were present in some areas. Beroe cucumis is native to the northern Atlantic Ocean and sometimes occurs in the Mediterranean Sea, and it is being monitored to see if it can provide some level of control of M. leidyi. In 2012, Beroe cucumis was found off the coast of Israel for the first time, and there is proof that it preys on M. leidyi, as an individual was found with a partially digested M. leidyi in its stomach.

Early life Smith was born in 1929 in West Head, Cape Sable Island, Nova Scotia (NS). He spent his youth living with his parents, Lottie (Steadman) and Benjamin Smith, and two siblings, Sidney Smith and Dellas Smith Nickerson, on Cape Sable. Gerald's early education (Grades 1 - 6) consisted of correspondence courses administered by the NS Department of Education. When he reached Grade 7 his father purchased a home in Clark's Harbour on Cape Sable Island so that the children could attend school on the mainland. The family home on Cape Sable was part of the Cape Sable Light Station, a lighthouse facility, which was operated by the Canadian Department of Transport. Benjamin was the Head Lightkeeper of the station. Gerald's childhood on Cape Sable exerted a strong influence on his career as it was there that he was exposed to the raw Atlantic Ocean and the lighthouse that served as subject matter for his early work and continued to provide a major influence on his work throughout his career. After graduating from Clark's Harbour High School in 1947 Gerald enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force where he served for five years as a Radar Technician achieving the rank of Leading Aircraftsman (LAC). During a stopover in Moncton, NB he had the opportunity to see an art show featuring the works of the Group of Seven painters which was showing in the lobby of the local CN hotel. This exhibit awakened a long-held interest in painting and he began to accumulate art books and to spend his furlough days visiting galleries in Montreal and the Ontario region where he was stationed. In 1953 he voluntarily left the Air Force after five years of service and returned to Nova Scotia where he found employment as a Radar Technician with Fairey Aviation in Eastern Passage, NS. He later transferred to the position of Technical Illustrator with the same company. In this capacity he was involved in illustrating military hardware including the \\"Beartrap,\\" a hauldown system that was designed by that company for installation on smaller naval ships to aid helicopter landings on rolling and pitching flight decks. As his interest in art continued to occupy his mind he enrolled in evening classes at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design where he was encouraged by the Principal, Donald MacKay, to pursue an academic career. Academic and Teaching Career In 1973, Gerald was accepted into the Fine Arts Program at Mount Allison University. He graduated in 1976 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree (with Distinction) after receiving many awards including the Wood and Gairdner Scholarships. In 1977 he moved his family to Saskatoon, SK where he received a Graduate Student Scholarship for enrollment into the Master of Arts Program at the University of Saskatchewan. In 1979 he graduated with a Master of Arts in Studio Painting. Following this he took up a number of teaching positions throughout Saskatchewan through the University of Saskatchewan's Extension Department. From 1978 to 1987 he taught painting and drawing in Melfort, Hudson Bay and Yorkton, Saskatchewan. Under the auspices of the University of Saskatchewan he wrote and starred in a series of fourteen cable television shows in which he demonstrated various painting techniques. This series appeared on Saskatoon Telecable 10 in 1979. In 1985, his wife's career with Agriculture Canada took Anna and Gerald to Regina and then on to Ottawa in 1987. In 1988 Gerald joined the faculty at the Ottawa School of Art (OSA) at the Downtown Campus at 35 George Street. There he taught painting and drawing for 24 years until his retirement in 2012 at age 83. Family Gerald met his future wife, Anna Oliver at the Cape Sable Light Station through a long-time friend, Betty-June Smith (Richardson), who was married to Gerald's brother Sidney, the Assistant Keeper at the station. Gerald and Anna were married in Yarmouth, NS in August 1957. They settled in Dartmouth, NS where they raised four children (Roxanne ‚Äìb.1958, Karen ‚Äìb.1960, Jeffrey ‚Äì b.1961 and Melanie ‚Äì b.1964). Influences The lighthouse at Cape Sable was equipped with a 3rd order Fresnel lens that when illuminated would cast off refracted light into the lantern room. Many of Gerald's abstract paintings borrow from his experiences viewing the coloured light produced by this lens. Other influences include the works of Ellsworth Kelly, Chuck Close and Sandro Botticelli. Exhibitions Gerald Smith's work is found in many public collections including the: Canada Council Art Bank, City of Ottawa, Mendel Art Gallery, University of Saskatchewan, St. Thomas Moore Gallery, Gairdner Fine Art Collection, Victoria General Hospital, Archelaus Smith Museum and over 200 private and public collections. Body of Work Gerald Smith was very prolific though his long career that saw the creation of over original 800 original works of art most of which were landscape, figure and abstract paintings in oil and acrylic. He also produced a number of sculptural works in wood and stone but their production declined following the end of his academic career due to lack of studio space. His success as a painter was connected to his fine drawing skills and which can be seen in the hundreds of figure drawings (primarily figure and still life) that he produced. Notable works Moon Crater (1974 ‚Äì triptych) was one of the first abstracts that Gerald produced. It consisted of three 48\\" √ó 48\\" acrylic panels that when assembled comprised a series of coloured bands that transition from red to yellow, yellow to blue and from blue to red. Although the individual panels appear to represent an impact structure with a round central uplift and raised rim the comparison to the basic design of the glass panels in a Fresnel lens can also be understood. At the Mendel #1 (1981) comprises a 47\\" √ó 57\\" oil on canvas painting of two figures (posed by his son Jeffrey and Karen Faul) in a gallery setting. This painting served as the first of 29 similarly themed works comprising figures in gallery settings with real or imagined art works and sculptural elements filling the space that Gerald produced from 1981 through to 1997. Michelle (1995 ‚Äì inventory no. 95.1) comprises a 66\\" √ó 50\\" oil on canvas painting of the head of female model rendered in fine detail from the neck up. Gerald produced a total of 26 similar themed images of large heads from 1995 to 2011 including: John Mlacak (2003, inventory no. 2003.1), Yves Larocque (2003, inventory no. 2003.3) and Jeremy Smith (2007, inventory no 2007.2). The Journey (2002 ‚Äì inventory no. 2002.1) comprises a 72\\" √ó 480\\" oil on canvas mural that was commissioned for Kanata Baptist Church in Kanata, ON. The painting depicts the migration of Abraham and a group of followers from Ur (Babylonia) to Canaan. The painting comprises a group of more than 40 figures walking or riding from right to left. The models were mostly drawn from fellow artists, students at the OSA and family members. Floating Circle #6 (a.k.a. The Little Wow) (2007, inventory no. 2007.4) comprises one of a series of seven 40\\" √ó 40\\" or smaller acrylic on canvas abstracts with a round central element with horizontal bars or wedges set against or comprising an element in a background of bars and wedges. Most of these panels were all produced over a two-year period from 2005 to 2007. Comparisons can be made to early abstract pieces including Moon Crater, Saturn Transition 1 and Saturn Transition 2 (both produced in 1974) but more importantly the idea for these works were drawn from the artists consideration for the refracted light and the geometric design of concentric coloured circles of light that were observed in the Fresnel lens at the Cape Sable light station.

In 1979 Fields won silver medals at the Pan American Games and the Soviet Spartakiad. He won his specialty at the 1980 U.S. Olympic Trials, but missed out on Olympic participation due to the American boycott. Early career Fields attended Washingtonville High School in Washingtonville, New York, where he set school records in both high jump and triple jump. Originally, he jumped as Ben Fields; he adopted the spelling \\"Benn\\" later in his career to make his name more distinctive. In 1972, his senior year at Washingtonville, Fields suffered from a bruised back but recovered fast enough to enter the New York State high school championship meet as one of the favorites in the high jump; he won the state title with a jump of 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m). After graduating from Washingtonville Fields entered the State University of New York at New Paltz, setting a SUNY Athletic Conference record as a freshman in 1973 and sharing third place at that year's NCAA College Division championships. SUNY New Paltz dropped its track and field program after that year, with Fields moving to Seton Hall University as a result. While at Seton Hall, he won the 1975 Penn Relays high jump with a jump of 7 ft in (2.17 m) and placed fourth at that year's NCAA Division I Championships; he also won the 1975 IC4A high jump title as Seton Hall claimed the team championship. In 1976, his final year at Seton Hall, Fields placed eighth at the NCAA championships and seventh at the national (AAU) championships. At that summer's U.S. Olympic Trials Fields no-heighted in the final, failing to qualify for the American team. Later career Fields continued high jumping after graduating from Seton Hall, dedicating himself to qualifying for the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, Soviet Union. In 1977 he placed fourth at the AAU championships with a jump of 7 ft 3 in (2.21 m) and was ranked #7 in the United States by Track & Field News for his first national top 10 ranking. At the 1978 AAU meet Fields cleared 7 ft in (2.24 m) to place shared second, losing only to former world record holder Dwight Stones and tying with former world indoor record holder Franklin Jacobs. He set his personal best, 2.30 m (7 ft in), in Valpara√≠so on November 1, 1978; Track & Field News ranked him third in the United States and sixth in the world that year. Fields won the national indoor championship title at the 1979 AAU indoor championships, jumping a meeting record 7 ft in (2.25 m) and edging out Jacobs and James Frazier on fewer misses; Stones, the previous year's champion, had been declared a professional and thus wasn't eligible to jump. At the outdoor championships Jacobs in turn won from Fields on countback as both cleared 7 ft 5 in (2.26 m); Jacobs, who had had a mediocre outdoor season until then, only narrowly missed at 7 ft 7 in. That summer Fields represented the United States at the Pan American Games in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and then the Soviet Spartakiad in Moscow; he won silver medals in both meets. At the Pan American Games he only cleared 2.19 m (7 ft in), but still placed second behind Jacobs; at the Spartakiad, which as a dress rehearsal for the following year's Summer Olympics was inviting non-Soviet athletes for the first time, he jumped 2.24 m (7 ft in) and lost to the Soviet Union's Aleksandr Grigoryev on more misses. Fields's best jump in 1979 was 2.27 m (7 ft in), which he jumped in Bratislava on June 7; he defeated world record holder Vladimir Yashchenko in that competition. Fields remained in good shape in 1980 and was disappointed with the American decision to boycott the Olympics in Moscow. He skipped that year's national championships, but eventually decided to compete at the Olympic Trials (which were held separately); in windy conditions, he won the Trials with a jump of 7 ft 5 in (2.26 m), but due to the boycott he and the other qualifiers didn't get to compete at the Olympics. Track & Field News ranked him a career-best fifth in the world that year, and first in the United States; it was his only national #1 ranking. Although Fields was never world- ranked again after 1980, he continued his jumping career. At the 1982 U.S: outdoor championships, he placed second behind Milton Ottey, a Canadian. As the top United States jumper, he was the American champion. 1982 marked the last time Fields was ranked in the national top ten; he attempted to qualify for the Olympics again at the 1984 Trials, but no-heighted in the qualification round. Recognition Fields qualified for the 1980 U.S. Olympic team but was unable to compete due to the boycott. He did however receive one of 461 Congressional Gold Medals created especially for the spurned athletes. Fields was inducted in the Seton Hall Pirates Hall of Fame in 1982 and in the New Paltz Hawks Hall of Fame in 2005.

Salkoff (born March 3, 1944) is an American neuroscientist and currently a professor of Neuroscience and Genetics at Washington University School of Medicine Lawrence B. Salkoff Early life and education Salkoff received his Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree in Economics in 1967 from University of California-Los Angeles. After graduation he volunteered in the United States Peace Corps working in Colombia, South America from 1967-1970. Upon Salkoff's return to the United States he studied at the University of California, Berkeley, where he received his PhD in Neurogenetics in 1979. Subsequently, Salkoff trained as a Postdoctoral Associate in Neurogenetics at Yale University, in the laboratory of Professor Robert Wyman with consultation and aid from Professor Charles F. Stevens. Career Salkoff's career began in 1978 before much detail was known about ion channel structure using Drosophila as a model system. As a graduate student he worked on the shibire mutant and characterized its defects in synaptic transmission. Cloning of the extended family of potassium channel genes. The structure of potassium channels which shape the electrical activity in the nervous system was unknown when Salkoff was a graduate student. It was believed that one way to obtain the protein structure of a potassium channel was to identify a gene encoding the channel protein in a genetically tractable organism, and then combine newly developed tools in biophysics, molecular genetics, DNA sequencing in eukaryotes, and molecular cloning, to clone and sequence the gene and functionally express the encoded channel in a heterologous expression system. To this end, as a postdoctoral researcher, Salkoff adapted the voltage clamp technique to the fruit fly Drosophila which had been used by Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley to reveal the ionic basis of the nerve action potential. This enabled the direct observation of ion currents in a genetically tractable organism. This technique was then used to show that the Drosophila Shaker gene was the structural gene for a potassium channel, a claim which was based on several genetic criteria and confirmed by biophysical analysis of the expected ion channel current phenotype. Thus, mutations of a structural gene should produce loss of function mutations where the gene product is absent or non-functional, gain of function mutations where the functional properties of the gene product is changed, and position effect mutations where a breakpoint near the gene reduces expression of a normal gene product. All three classes of mutations were characterized by Salkoff, e.g. 1. Loss-of-function mutant ( ShrKO120) which removed the Shaker K+ current. 2\\\\. Gain-of-function mutant (Sh5) (which changed the inactivation kinetics of the current, 3\\\\. Position effect conferred by the W32 X-chromosome breakpoint. Salkoff also combined voltage-clamp technique with genetic analysis to reveal the location of the Shaker gene on the Drosophilia polytene chromosome map. These studies validated the Shaker gene as the structural locus of a potassium channel and guided a chromosomal ‚Äúwalking‚Äù strategy to the physical location of the Shaker locus. It also had the effect of directing great attention to Drosophila as a model system combining molecular genetics with biophysical tools and enabled the study of ion channel biology using a comprehensive approach not possible in other systems. Salkoff found that the W32 chromosomal broke within or close to the Shaker gene. This study showing the location of the Shaker gene on the physical chromosome map facilitated the cloning of the Shaker potassium channel. Based on these findings Salkoff began a genomic DNA \\"walk\\" along the chromosome to clone the Shaker gene in conjunction with Patrick H. O'Farrell and Lily Jan but moved to Washington University before the project was finished. The project was completed by several laboratories. The cloning and functional expression of a family of voltage-gated K+ channels conserved in all animals brought order to the field of electrophysiology, and validated the use of simple animal models in the field of membrane excitability. After the initial cloning of the Shaker gene by several laboratories. Salkoff's laboratory used the Shaker cDNA as a stepping stone [using the technique of low stringency hybridization] with which to clone and functionally characterize the extended gene family of voltage-dependent potassium channels which in addition to Shaker, was designated Shab (Kv2), Shaw (Kv3) and Shal (Kv4). The Salkoff lab then showed that all families were conserved in mammals and were independent current systems (that did not form heteromultimers between families One or more of these genes expressing voltage-dependent potassium currents are expressed in virtually all vertebrate and invertebrate neurons. Salkoff's studies showed that an ‚Äúessential set‚Äù of ion channels was conserved throughout the animal kingdom and was even present in primitive metazoan forms such as jellyfish, thus proving that the electrical properties of the nervous system developed early in evolution. This work contributed to one of the fundamental revelations of modern biology, that the basic genes and proteins that form complex animal life are highly conserved, having evolved only once, and presumably present in LUCA, the Last universal common ancestor to all current metazoan life. In addition to the cloning and characterization of voltage-dependent potassium channels, Salkoff's lab also cloned and functionally characterized the ‚ÄúSLO‚Äù family of high conductance potassium channels. The discovery of a high conductance sperm¬¨specific potassium channel turned out to be the key to understanding membrane potential changes that occur during sperm capacitation; a knockout strain of the SLO3 potassium channel in mouse has turned out to be a valuable tool to investigate membrane potential dependent aspects of sperm physiology.

S.P.L.O.T. was created by Marcilio Mendonca during his Ph.D. at the University of Waterloo, Canada, in 2008-2009. Since then, the academic website has been visited by numerous researchers and research groups worldwide thereby helping to advance the Software Product Lines field. S.P.L.O.T's source code (as well as its main library SPLAR) are freely available on GitHub and have been successfully extended by others to address different research needs. A common task in Software Product Lines is the analysis of feature models. Analysis tasks can include checking the validity of the feature model (i.e., whether the model has at least one valid configuration), counting valid configurations, detecting 'dead' features, and so on. S.P.L.O.T. offers an analysis tool that can help practitioners to analyse and reason on feature models. Likewise, software variants in Software Product Lines can be configured by means of selecting/deselecting features in a feature model. This task can be tedious and time-consuming, especially in large scale, given that constraints in the feature model might prevent configuration actions. S.P.L.O.T. offers a configuration tool that supports semi-automatic feature model configuration. As features are selected/deselect in the model S.P.L.O.T. configurator automatically propagates decisions (i.e., further selection/deselection of features) to abide to the constraints in the model. S.P.L.O.T. also contains the world's largest repository of feature models thanks to the open model adopted allowing anyone to create and share a model with the SPL research community. As of March, 2015, more than 620 feature models are available for download on S.P.L.O.T.'s repository. Many other tools are available to support Software Product Lines including FaMa, FeatureIDE, Pure::Variants, Ahead, and others.

Through its story, the book claims, contrary to scientific data, that contracting measles is beneficial to health, and that vaccines are ineffective. The book was first published in 2012, but came to attention in 2015 following a measles outbreak that began at Disneyland during December of the previous year. Many commentators have criticised the book because of the dangers associated with contracting measles, and because its title is reminiscent of George's Marvellous Medicine, by Roald Dahl, who was a prominent advocate of vaccination in his later years, following the death of his daughter Olivia from measles in 1962. The book has also received attention for the numerous negative reviews it has received on Amazon.com. Premise and plot The book contends that contracting measles is beneficial for children, with the book's product description describing the disease as \\"quite benign\\" and \\"beneficial to the body\\". In the story, a girl named Tina, who has never been vaccinated, returns to school after the winter break and discovers that her friend Melanie is at home with measles. Tina's mother encourages Tina to visit Melanie, because catching measles would be a good thing for Tina. Tina tells her mother that the other children are frightened of getting measles, but her mother reassures her by explaining that catching measles is a good thing for most children: \\"Many wise people believe measles make the body stronger and more mature for the future\\". She suggests some carrot juice and melon might help Melanie recover. She says that being scared of the disease is \\"a bit like being scared of the dark\\". Her mother explains that Tina has not been vaccinated because of some illness her older brother had after receiving his vaccinations. Melanie's mother explains that Melanie had been vaccinated against measles and it did not work; the doctor said that Melanie's measles were the worst case he had ever seen. Melanie explains to Tina that the spots do not hurt or itch, and shows Tina her spotty tummy. The two girls spend the day playing together and end the day with a hug. A week later Tina is back to school, without measles. Her mother attributes this to her eating the right foods, playing in the fresh air and drinking much water. Jared, a vaccinated boy, ends up being the one that gets measles; Tina's mother blames this on his bad eating habits and \\"the accompanying image is of an annoyed Jared laying in bed covered in spots with a hamburger, chips (labeled 'MSG-enriched, GM- full'), ... soda, cupcake, chocolate bar on his bedside table\\". The book also criticizes childhood vaccines as ineffective, and Messenger states in the book that she has raised three children \\"vaccine-free and childhood disease-free\\". The scientific data Independent data shows that measles causes the most vaccine-preventable deaths of any disease, resulting in about 96,000 deaths in 2013, and the vaccine is 97% effective after two shots. Measles is highly contagious ‚Äì before immunisation in the United States there were between three and four million cases annually ‚Äì and the fatality rate is approximately 0.2% of those infected. Most of those who are infected and who die are less than five years old. Recently published scientific research shows that, contrary to the message in the book, \\"the risk associated with measles infection is much greater than the sum of its observable symptoms\\" because a measles infection leaves children \\"...vulnerable to other pathogens that they might have been protected from before their bout with the virus\\". This is caused by the measles virus wiping out parts of the body's immune system's memory. \\"Two months after the unvaccinated children recovered from measles, the team found that the virus had erased 11‚Äì73% of their antibodies against other bacteria and viruses. ...The kids who received the MMR vaccine showed no reduction in these antibodies.\\" Reception Although the book was first published in 2012, it received considerable attention after the Disneyland measles outbreak began in December 2014, which led to many people looking for the book in order to criticise it. The book has been criticized because measles is responsible for thousands of deaths every year. Most reviews have been negative: for example, the president of the Australian Medical Association, Steve Hambleton, said: \\"Last time I saw a kid with measles with the rash they were carried into the surgery and the child looked like a rag doll. The mother was terrified. It's still fatal. About one in 10,000 children will die because of encephalitis\\". \\"Even in 'industrialised countries', measles can cause encephalitis, seizures, blindness, heart and nervous system disorders, and (rarely) death\\". Dr. David Gorski, a renowned doctor, writes: \\"I'm sure children with whooping cough who are coughing so hard that they can't catch their breath for hours on end, with haemophilus influenzae type B who develop pneumonia or meningitis, with polio who develop paralysis, or with measles who develop pneumonia or subacute sclerosing panencephalitis will feel happy to 'embrace childhood disease', at least those who don't end up dead, who can't embrace anything other than the grave.\\" William Sears says: \\"Complications of the disease include pneumonia and encephalitis, swelling of the brain, that can result in deafness or mental retardation. I've seen a case of measles encephalitis and it's not pretty. There's nothing awesome about it at all\\". Quite a few of the reviews contain statistics of illnesses in recent years. Sears states that it is very easy to catch measles: \\"Before the vaccine that eradicated the disease from this country by 2000, 'hundreds of thousands of kids got measles every year'... The CDC claims that, if exposed, 90% of unvaccinated people who come in contact with an infected person will get the disease. 'And for 1 out of every 1,000 children who contract it, the disease is fatal.'\\" \\"The World Health Organization says measles is 'one of the leading causes of death among young children even though a safe and cost-effective vaccine is available'. There are about 140,000 deaths a year, mostly in poor countries. In Australia measles deaths are now rare because the disease has been controlled though widespread vaccination. When it does occur, the danger comes from complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis. Dr. Hambleton said while \\"there were occasional adverse reactions to the vaccination, it was far more dangerous to actually experience the disease.\\" In Pakistan, the World Health Organization reported 64 deaths from measles in 2011 and 306 deaths in 2012. \\"Many Pakistanis\\", reported Al Jazeera, \\"especially in rural areas, view vaccination campaigns with suspicion as a western plot to sterilize Muslims.\\" David Gorski states that this clearly is an anti-vaccine book aimed at children who are told to \\"embrace childhood disease\\", eat healthy, and get plenty of sleep and sunshine. He feels that the anti-vaccine parents are hiding their children in the herd of vaccinated children and that if these parents had experienced polio and smallpox like \\"our grandparents had\\", they would not be so eager to refute vaccinations now. He thinks that Messenger's belief that her first child's death (from an unreported cause) was vaccine related, and that her three younger children are healthy because they are not vaccinated, is just confirmation bias, and that statements from Messenger like, \\"My unvaccinated children are alive and well and my vaccinated child is dead! That's what I know and live with every day\\" are difficult to combat with numbers, but it is still important to keep trying. Gorski continues: \\"The death of a single child, whatever the cause, is a tragedy. If we want to see a lot more of these tragedies, all we have to do is to be complacent and let the vaccination rate fall too far below herd enormity.\\" Messenger has said she was trying to give parents and children more knowledge. \\"Only people who are not in favour of a free press or free speech would [want it banned]\\", she said. \\"Natural health says that measles is a good thing for a reasonably healthy child to have\\". The Australian Vaccination-Skeptics Network (AVN) stated on their webpage that Messenger was \\"concerned that the public are being misled by medical professionals. They are trying to say that vaccination is safe and effective and it is neither one of those things\\". The AVN praises the book for its \\"beautiful\\" illustrations, and \\"simple, colourful text\\". It discusses not only the fact that measles is usually benign in healthy, well-nourished children, but the importance of proper nutrition including vitamin A from orange fruits and vegetables\\". Roald Dahl book Another reason for the criticism is because the book's title resembles that of the book George's Marvellous Medicine, by Roald Dahl, who was a strong proponent of vaccination. Dahl's daughter, Olivia, died from measles in 1962 and he later wrote an account of her death. Dahl later became an outspoken pro-vaccination advocate. \\"Today a good and safe vaccine is available to every family and all you have to do is to ask your doctor to administer it\\", writes Dahl in 1988 in a pleading appeal to parents to vaccinate their children against measles. Actress Patricia Neal, Olivia's mother, interviewed in 1997 recounts the horribleness of a death of a child and says: \\"Less than a week after coming down with the virus, she [Olivia] developed measles encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain\\". Olivia's sister, Lucy, interviewed in 2015 by CBS, states that her father did not understand why people choose not to vaccinate their children against measles, \\"because he didn't have the choice\\". In Dahl's public letter he stated it is \\"'almost a crime' for some parents not to immunize their children\\". \\"I do agree with that\\", Lucy states; \\"I think that it is a crime\\". One reviewer commented that \\"I can only assume the author Stephanie Messenger was unaware of the incredibly offensive nature of the title\\". Amazon reviews The book has received numerous negative reviews on Amazon.com; as of February 2015, the book had over 1,000 one-star ratings on this website. Melanie's Marvelous Measles was written in 2012, but because of measles outbreaks across America in 2015, attention has been refocused on combating the anti-vaccine message. \\"So, the Internet is doing what the Internet does best: trolling the hell out of Messenger's deeply flawed book through Amazon comments\\". Amazon has chosen to use a disclaimer on the book description, \\"noting that it is 'provided by the publisher/author of this title and presents the subjective opinions of the publisher/author, which may not be substantiated'\\". By January 2013, Yahoo! reported that \\"of the 83 reviews of the book, 71 Amazon users gave it one star, and posted negative feedback.\\" \\"The Amazon reader reviews are reassuringly vicious, pointing out that a similar book about 'Peter's Pleasant Polio' probably wouldn't get published\\". \\"Certainly, reviewers of the book on the Amazon website don't agree with Messenger's interpretation of history. Many people have left comments on the website, telling their own stories of spending time in hospitals as a child in an oxygen tent, and of siblings who died from complications arising from measles\\". The reviews are mostly either one-star or five-star; in an act of unity, most of the five-starred reviews are parodies of the title, or over-the-top cynical commentaries on the book's anti- vaccination message. News.com.au describes the Amazon comments as people mocking the book. In January 2015, Melanie's Marvelous Measles is continuing to receive harsh reviews on Amazon, \\"(where the story rates 1.9 stars out of 5), with commenters (sic) calling its message 'ignorant and dangerous'. One pediatric nurse wrote that the book was 'appalling'; another said it was 'new- age propaganda'. One (sarcastic) reviewer even rated the book five stars and wrote 'It made me realize things like Ebola should be embraced'\\". Book withdrawn from sale from Australian bookstore Although it was originally available in Australia through Messenger's website, the book was promoted in Australian bookstores by a US publisher. Steve Hambleton, President of the Australian Medical Association, stated that publishers \\"should be ashamed of themselves\\" and asked that the book be pulled from sale. Bookworld (formerly Borders) CEO James Webber stated that \\"it was a 'sensitive issue' but their policy was to allow controversial content unless it was actually illegal\\". \\"This is one of tens of millions of titles that we list on the site, however [it] is not the type of book that we would ever consider actively promoting in any way\\", he said. Eventually, due to pressure from customers, Bookworld decided to pull Melanie's Marvelous Measles. A spokesman told News.com.au: \\"In this case we listened to our customers and believe they have a fair argument and have removed the titles from both pages\\".

He was opposed by Macedon and a coalition of Greek city-states (poleis), most notably Sparta. The war ended in a joint victory by Macedonia and Sparta. After being defeated by the Roman Republic in the Pyrrhic War in 275 BC, Pyrrhus ( 297‚Äì272 BC) decided to turn his attention to Greece. He declared war on Antigonus Gonatas ( 283‚Äì239 BC) of Macedon and in a rapid campaign, managed to defeat him and make himself king of Macedon. In 272 BC, Pyrrhus agreed to assist the disgruntled Spartan prince, Cleonymus, who requested his assistance in securing the Spartan throne. Pyrrhus advanced with his army through central Greece and upon reaching the Peloponnese, he marched against Sparta. The city was sparsely defended at the time as the majority of its army had been taken to Crete by King Areus I ( 309‚Äì265 BC). The Spartans led by Crown Prince Acrotatus were able to withstand a series of Epiriote assaults until Macedonian reinforcements and Areus' army arrived to relieve the defenders. Following the arrival of the relieving force, Pyrrhus lifted the siege and prepared to winter in Laconia. However, he was approached by an Argive citizen who requested his assistance in overthrowing the government of Argos. Seeking to take advantage of the opportunity, Pyrrhus took his army to Argos, being harried along the way by the Spartans. Whilst attempting to seize Argos by night, Pyrrhus was set upon by his Argive opponents as well as the Spartans and Antigonus' Macedonians. In the ensuing m√™l√©e, Pyrrhus was slain. His death prompted the capitulation of his army and the reestablishment of a Macedonian hegemony over Greece. Prelude Map depicting the campaigns of Pyrrhus in southern Italy and Sicily and the location of the Kingdom of Epirus in Greece Following entreaties from the Greek polis of Tarentum in 281 BC, Pyrrhus, the king of Epirus in northern Greece, invaded Italy with an army of 25,500 and 20 war elephants. The aim of the expedition was to combat the aggression of the Roman Republic, which was increasingly annexing the Greek cities of Magna Graecia. Upon arriving in Italy in 280 BC, Pyrrhus assumed command of an army consisting of the Greeks of Magna Graecia. Adding these forces to his own from Epirus, he engaged and defeated the Roman army at the Battle of Heraclea, near Tarentum in 280 BC. The Epiriote victory caused a number of native groups such as the Samnites and the Lucanians, who were also fearful of Roman expansionism to join Pyrrhus. Subsequently, Pyrrhus advanced towards Rome and at the Battle of Asculum he vanquished another Roman army. Despite having bested the Romans in their battles, Pyrrhus had sustained heavy casualties. With his Italian allies wavering, Pyrrhus decided to abandon his campaign against Rome. At this point in time, Pyrrhus had two options available. Firstly, he could return to Greece where the throne of Macedon had been left vacant by the death of King Ptolemy Keraunos at the hands of the Gallic invaders of Greece. Pyrrhus had coveted the Macedonian throne and had briefly held it from 287 BC to 285 BC. Alternatively, he could respond to the appeal of the Greek poleis of Sicily which were requesting his assistance to combat Carthaginian aggression. Ultimately, in 278 BC, Pyrrhus decided to direct his army against the Carthaginians in Sicily. Pyrrhus was highly successful in his campaign against Carthage and by 275 BC had managed to restrict them to the settlement of Lilybaeum in the far west of the island. Despite these victories, Pyrrhus' despotic disposition and pretensions alienated his Sicilian allies who began to abandon him. In light of these developments, Pyrrhus decided to return to mainland Italy to continue his war against Rome. The Epiriotes attacked the Roman army but after the inconclusive Battle of Beneventum, he returned to Epirus. Despite Pyrrhus leaving a garrison there, Tarentum succumbed to Rome in 272 BC. War against Macedon A Macedonian coin depicting King Antigonus II of Macedon ( 283‚Äì239 BC), who managed to reclaim his kingdom after defeating Pyrrhus On his return to his homeland, Pyrrhus found himself in a difficult position. His Italian sojourn had emptied his coffers and crippled his army, leaving him reliant on Sicilian mercenaries who required payment. In order to secure funds to pay his troops, Pyrrhus planned a war against Antigonus II Gonatas, the new king of Macedon. Citing Antigonus' refusal to provide him with aid during his Italian expedition as a casus belli, Pyrrhus invaded Macedon in the spring of 274 BC. He was accompanied by an army consisting of 8,000 infantry and 500 cavalry although their numbers were probably augmented by Gallic mercenaries. It has been speculated that by invading Macedon, Pyrrhus was acting as the agent of the monarchs of Ptolemaic Egypt, Ptolemy II and Arsinoe II, however N. G. L. Hammond posits that this is highly unlikely. Initially, Pyrrhus had simply viewed his incursion into Macedon as an opportunity to plunder. However, the capture of numerous towns and the defection to his side of 2,000 Macedonian soldiers caused him to make his objective the seizure of the Macedonian throne. Antigonus marched with his army to western Macedon and was confronted by Pyrrhus at the Battle of the Aous. Pyrrhus began the engagements by slaughtering Antigonus' Gallic rearguard before securing the surrender of the Macedonian war elephants. Demoralised by these sudden reverses, the Macedonian phalangites responded to Pyrrhus' appeals and defected to the Epiriote side. Abandoned by his army, Antigonus managed to escape to Thessaloniki with a small force of cavalry. He was able to entrench himself there, protected by his strong navy which enabled him to maintain links with his possessions in Greece. Antigonus' flight left Pyrrhus in complete control of the Macedonian hinterland and Thessaly in central Greece. However, not all of Macedon surrendered to the Epiriote king and he was compelled to send his general, the Spartan Prince Cleonymus to capture Edessa. Despite initially being welcomed with enthusiasm by the Macedonians, he managed to alienate his new subjects when his Gallic troops ransacked the royal Macedonian tombs at Vergina. By late 274 BC or early 273 BC, Pyrrhus secured the occupation of Macedonia and returned to Epirus, leaving his son Ptolemy to govern the region. Advance into the Peloponnese A map depicting the Peloponnese. Pyrrhus advanced from Achaia in the north to Sparta before turning back north-east towards Argos. Following his Macedonian triumph, Pyrrhus was approached by his officer Cleonymus. The Spartan convinced the Epiriote king to aid him in a scheme to seize control of his homeland. Cleonymus' reasons for seeking to attack Sparta were twofold. Firstly, he was angry that he had been overlooked for the Agiad kingship of Sparta in favour of his nephew, Areus II. Plutarch ascribes Cleonymus' failure to secure the throne to his arbitrariness and violent nature. Furthermore, Cleonymus had become a target of ridicule in Sparta by the fact that his new wife, Chilonis, was engaging in an affair with Acrotatus, the son of Areus. Pyrrhus' motivation for agreeing to assist Cleonymus is more complex. By installing Cleonymus on the throne, the Epiriote would secure Sparta as an ally. Additionally, by invading the Peloponnese, Pyrrhus would be able to subdue any cities which had remained loyal to Antigonus. In doing so, he could prevent Antigonus using the peninsula as a base from which to launch a counter-attack on Macedon. The size of the force assembled by Pyrrhus is indicative of his intention to extend his hegemony into the Peloponnese. The Epiriote king mustered an army consisting of 25,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry as well as 24 war elephants. In 272 BC, Pyrrhus marched his army through Central Greece to the city of Pleuron from where they were ferried across the Gulf of Corinth to the Peloponnese. This suggests that the invasion was supported by the Aetolian League, a powerful confederate in Central Greece which was allied with Pyrrhus and hostile to Antigonus. Antigonus attempted to exploit Pyrrhus' absence from Macedon by launching an invasion to reclaim his kingdom. However, his attack on Macedon was unsuccessful as he was defeated in battle by Pyrrhus' son, Ptolemy. Unperturbed by Antigonus' offensive, Pyrrhus advanced into the Peloponnese where he was welcomed in Achaia. The Epiriote army marched to Megalopolis, a central Peloponnesian city which lay on the border with Sparta. Several of Sparta's neighbours, namely Megalopolis, Elis and many of the Achaians poleis, supported Pyrrhus invasion as they would profit from the reduction of Spartan influence in the region. While his force was camped at Megalopolis, Pyrrhus received ambassadors from Messene, Athens, the Achaian League and Sparta. In response to the Spartans' inquires as to the reasons for his Peloponnesian incursion, Pyrrhus managed to dupe the envoys. He told the Spartans that he had come to liberate any cities still held by Antigonus and that he hoped to send his sons to Sparta to obtain a traditional education at the agoge. However, when the emissaries returned to Sparta, Pyrrhus advanced into Laconia. He advanced south, following the course of the Eurotas River and ravaging the lands of the Spartan perioeci. It may have been at this time that Pyrrhus assigned Cleonymus a series of independent commands as he is recorded as subjugating the city of Alifeira in Elis as well as sacking Zarax in the Parnon region of Laconia. Pyrrhus' perfidy was met with anger in Sparta and ambassadors were immediately sent to Pyrrhus to rebuke him. Siege of Sparta A bust of Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, at the National Archaeological Museum of Naples. Pyrrhus' ambition and recklessness led to his untimely death at Argos. The Spartans were caught unawares by Pyrrhus' invasion. Areus had taken the majority of the Spartan army with him to Crete, where he was campaigning on behalf of Gortyn at the request of Ptolemaic Egypt. The result was that the settlement was lightly defended. Arriving at Sparta as night fell, Cleonymus advised Pyrrhus to attack the city immediately. However, the Epiriote declined to as he was fearful of the damage that would be wrought by Gallic troops if they entered the city at night and moreover expected the sparsely defended city to surrender in the morning. Repulse of Pyrrhus from Sparta. The Spartan council of Elders, the gerousia, suggested that the Spartan women be sent to Crete for their protection. They were dissuaded from doing so by Arachidamia, the former queen and grandmother of the Eurypontid King Eudamidas II who convinced them that the women could assist in the city's defence. In order to guarantee the fighting men some rest, the women and the elderly began bolstering defences. Aware that Pyrrhus had elephants with him, the defenders dug a large trench and sunk wagons into the ground at its flanks in order to hinder the Epiriote advance. Moreover, messengers were sent both to summon Areus back and to request aid from Antigonus, despite the fact the Sparta and Macedon had traditionally been hostile. Pausanias, the Greek geographer, claims that Sparta received some aid from Messene and the pro- Spartan faction at Argos. The Epiriotes launched their first assault against the city at daybreak. However, they were unable to get a firm footing because of the trench and were repulsed by the defenders, who were encouraged by the women. In order to circumvent this obstacle. Pyrrhus ordered a 2,000 picked force of Gauls and Chaonians commanded by Ptolemy to attempt to go around the trench. Finding their path blocked by the wagons, they began to pulling them out of the ground. Aware of the danger, Acrotatus used a series of depressions to attack this force from the rear and managed to the push the Epiriote flanking group into the trench after inflicting heavy casualties upon them. Unable to make an impact on the defences, Pyrrhus ordered his troops to withdraw to their camp at nightfall. A coin depicting King Areus of Sparta (309 BC-265 BC), whose arrival with reinforcements saved Sparta from Pyrrhus After receiving a favourable omen during the night Pyrrhus renewed his assault. An effect of the shortage of warriors was that the Spartan women were active in providing the defenders with missiles and refreshments as well as taking away the wounded. In an attempt to nullify the Spartans' advantage, the Epiriotes tried to fill up with trench with debris and bodies but were prevented from doing so by the Sparta. Responding to this Spartan counter- attack, Pyrrhus personally led a charge against the Spartan lines and succeeded in entering the city, spreading panic amongst the defenders. However, at this point his horse threw him after it was wounded by a javelin in the belly. Pyrrhus' fall threw his companions into a state of dismay, permitting the Spartans to rally and they managed to slay many of the companions in a barrage of missiles. Despite this, Pyrrhus was taken safely back to his camp. Prompted by this unsuccessful foray, Pyrrhus order his army to return to its camp. He now expected the Spartans seek terms as the severity of their casualties would make the defence unsustainable. However, Sparta was saved by the arrival of unexpected reinforcements. In the interim, Antigonus had launched another offensive in northern Greece and succeeded in evicting Pyrrhus' garrisons from Macedon (this possibly accounts for the presence of Ptolemy in Pyrrhus' army). Having reclaimed his kingdom, Antigonus moved south into the Peloponnese, probably using the sea route to avoid a confrontation with the Aetolian League. Upon his arrival in Corinth, he sent his general Ameinias the Phocian with a group of mercenaries to assist the Spartans. The arrival of the Macedonia mercenaries was closely followed by Areus' return from Crete with 2,000 men. Enheartened by the arrival of these reinforcements, the defenders prepared to face Pyrrhus' next assault. The Epiriotes launched an attack in the morning but after this was repelled Pyrrhus became convinced of the futility of the situation and ordered his men to lift the siege. March to Argos A map of the southern and central Peloponnese (the southernmost area of Greece) showing important cities of the region. Pyrrhus retreated with his army into the Laconian hinterland with the purpose of wintering there before making another attempt against Sparta. However, as his troops were ravaging the surrounding countryside, he received news that Antigonus was marching on Argos from Corinth on his way to trap Pyrrhus in Laconia. Pyrrhus was approached by Aristeas, the leader of the democratic faction in Argos, who sought Epiriote support to counter the pro-Macedonian aristocratic party of Argos led by Aristippos. Accepting Aristeas' proposal, Pyrrhus began his march north to the Argolis. Pyrrhus' advance on Argos did not go smoothly as his army was constantly harassed by vengeful Spartan troops led by Areus. By setting up ambushes and occupying strategic positions along the Epiriote line of retreat, the Spartans were able to inflict heavy casualties on Pyrrhus' rearguard of Gauls and Molossians. In an attempt to restore the wavering morale of his rear, Pyrrhus sent Ptolemy to assume its command. Pyrrhus hoped that the presence of his son amongst the troops would stiffen their resolve and enable to him to extricate the remainder of his troops from the narrow pass through which they were passing. Ptolemy's position was attacked by a picked Spartan war band under the command of Evaclus. In the ensuing struggle, Ptolemy was slain by the Spartans causing his remaining troops to rout. The victorious Spartans pursued the fleeing Epiriote rearguard until they were checked by some Epiriote infantry. Upon hearing of his son's death and the collapse of his rearguard, Pyrrhus summoned his Molossian cavalry and charged the Spartans. In the battle that followed, Pyrrhus killed the Spartan leader Evaclus with his own hand and succeeded in annihilating the pursuing Spartan troops. After this skirmish, the Epiriotes continued their march to Argos. However, upon reaching his destination, he found that Antigonus had arrived at Argos first and camped to the city's north. The Macedonian presence compelled Pyrrhus to pitch camp at Nauplion to the south of Argos. Pyrrhus attempted to goad Antigonus into fighting a pitched battle on the plain in front of Argos but the Macedonian king was unmoved. The Argives sent ambassadors to both kings, beseeching them to respect the city's neutrality. Antigonus agreed to the Argives' terms and gave his son as a hostage in order to demonstrate his sincerity. While Pyrrhus agreed to retreat from Argos, he failed to give a pledge and as a result was regarded with suspicion. Battle of Argos A depiction of Pyrrhus and his war elephants. He brought 24 elephants with him to invade the Peloponnese. Pyrrhus' use of elephants in the Battle of Argos led to his demise. During the night, Pyrrhus was able to enter Argos. While Pausanias recounts that he did so by force, Plutarch asserts that Diamperes Gate had been left open for the Epiriotes by Aristeas. Hammond opines that it is more likely that Aristeas admitted Pyrrhus into the city. Although Pyrrhus' Gauls were able to occupy the Argive agora, the rest of the army was delayed due to the war elephants being too large to pass through the gate. In order for them to enter, the towers need to be taken off their backs and reattached once they were inside the city. Furthermore, Pyrrhus left the majority of his army outside the city walls under the command of his son Helenus. This delay gave the Argives enough time to reach their citadel, the Aspis, and seek aid from Antigonus. The Macedonian king responded immediately, advancing towards the city walls and sending a relief force inside under the command of his son Halcyoneus. The situation further deteriorated for Pyrrhus when Areus entered Argos with a force of 1,000 lightly armed Cretans and Spartans. The Argives, assisted by their Spartan and Macedonian allies, launched a counter-attack on Pyrrhus' Gallic troops in the agora and threw them into a state of panic. Due to the labyrinthine layout of the city and the darkness, both Pyrrhus' advancing troops and those of his opponents become scattered throughout Argos. The result was that Pyrrhus, entering the city at the head of his cavalry to assist the Gauls, was unable to effectively communicate his commands to his soldiers. Realising the difficulty of his situation, Pyrrhus ordered his army to retreat from Argos as day broke. Understanding that the gates were too narrow for his army to exit in an orderly fashion, Pyrrhus ordered Helenus to tear down part of the wall and to be prepared to fend off any enemy counter- attacks against the retreating troops. However, the instructions brought by the messenger were unclear and instead of organising the retreat, Helenus advanced with the rest of the army into Argos. With the majority of his troops streaming in through the gates, Pyrrhus' line of retreat was blocked off. The disorder was exacerbated when Pyrrhus' largest elephant fell and blocked the gateway and another elephant started running amok after his mahout was felled. The weight of the enemy's assault pushed Pyrrhus and his troops from the agora and compelled them to fight in the narrow street leading to the Diamperes Gate. In the fighting which ensued, Pyrrhus was wounded by a spear wielded by an Argive. As Pyrrhus turned to strike down his assailant, he was hit on the head by a roof tile thrown by his attacker's mother. Pyrrhus was either killed by the force of the tile's impact or, alternately, having fallen dazed from his horse he was decapitated by one of Antigonus' Macedonian soldiers, Zopyrus. Pyrrhus' head was brought by Halcyoneus to Antigonus, who expressed dismay when he saw it and upbraided his son for acting in such a barbarous manner. Upon Pyrrhus' death, Epiriote resistance crumbled and Antigonus accepted the surrender of Helenus, giving him Pyrrhus' body for burial. Aftermath The expedition into the Peloponnese was a disaster for Epiriote ambitions. Although Helenus was permitted by Antigonus to return to his homeland with the remainder of his army, Epirus ceased to be a regional power. Pyrrhus' son and successor, Alexander II of Epirus was granted generous terms by the Macedonian king. Epirus was able to keep Pyrrhus' conquests of Tymphaea, Parauaea and Atintania in western Macedon. Antigonus realised that an independent Epirus was essential in order to act as a buffer against the Illyrians to the north. Antigonus emerged from the conflict as the unchallenged ruler of Macedon and the leading power in Greece. After his victory in Argos, Antigonus was able to install his supporter Aristippos as tyrant of the city and appointed various pro-Macedonian leaders as tyrants in other Greek cities. His support for tyrants over democratic rulers would lead to growing resentment amongst the Greek cities against Macedon. On his journey north to Macedon, Antigonus succeeded in placing garrisons in the cities of Chalcis and Eretria on the important island of Euboia with the outcome being that he further consolidated his power in Greece. The Spartan-Macedon alliance proved to be transient. Angered by Macedon's supremacy and full of ambition, Areus formed a coalition with several Greek poleis, most notably Athens. In the resulting Chremonidean War, Areus was slain by his former ally Antigonus in a battle on the Isthmus of Corinth in 265 BC. The war ended in a defeat that was so crushing for Sparta that it would not rise as a regional power again until the reign of Cleomenes III thirty years later.

On April 23, 1988, within minutes of the grand opening of a new Save-On-Foods store, a portion of the roof collapsed sending the rooftop parking deck and 20 automobiles crashing into the produce section below. There were no fatalities and 21 people were treated in hospital.Report of the Commissioner of Inquiry, 1988. Retrieved 2017-09-28 In the years following the collapse, recommendations from a commission of inquiry resulted in significant changes to the practice of architecture and engineering throughout British Columbia. Collapse At 9:00 AM on the morning of April 23, 1988, customers were let into the store as part of a grand opening sale for senior citizens. Within 10 minutes an employee noticed water spraying from an overhead pipe that had burst. It was buckling under pressure from a roof beam that was twisting out of shape above a steel column. The 4.5 minute-long structural failure was heard and witnessed by many of the store occupants, including several who took photographs of the twisting and crushed beam. Evacuation alerts were issued through the public address system and the store was emptied in less than 5 minutes. The mayor of Burnaby, Bill Copeland, who presided over the opening ceremonies, assisted in directing the evacuation of approximately 600 customers and 307 employees.The History of Metropolitan Vancouver - 1988. Retrieved 2015-03-06 Four structural bays of the roof, measuring , collapsed into the produce section. One store employee was trapped under the debris and was removed by first responders using forklifts; he suffered a crushed pelvis. Several people were blown off their feet by the rushing air from the collapse. Background and cause The $100 million Station Square development project was begun in 1985 by Georgilas Investments. In 1986 Station Square/Wesbild purchased the as-yet unbuilt project. The supermarket facility was a $5.4 million part of the newly constructed mixed- use Station Square, complex in the Metrotown area of Burnaby, a suburb of Vancouver.Beams downsized at big store where roof collapsed, engineer says, Associated Press, printed in the Spokane Chronicle, December 16, 1988. Retrieved 2015-03-14 The facility was owned and developed by Wesbild Enterprises and Station Square Developments Inc.. Urban Design Group were the architects. Amako Construction Ltd. was the general contractor. Two structural engineering firms were involved: Tamm Tacy and Associates and MSS Group who were engaged during construction to provide additional structural verification. Save-On-Foods, then owned by the Overwaitea Foods division of Jim Pattison Industries (now Jim Pattison Group), was a tenant, not the owner or developer of the building. Before construction started, one of the contractors bidding on the work proposed adding car parking onto the roof. The owner asked the architects and engineers to determine if this was feasible; they did and recommended changes to the design of the structure for additional support and to provide access by way of a moving walkway. The structural failure was a direct result of the failure of the roof beam to support the weight of the rooftop parking structure and automobiles above. It was determined that the steel beam was undersized for its intended purpose and did not have bracing required to resist buckling above where it was supported on the column. Several factors were determined by the Commissioner of Inquiry into the collapse to have contributed to the collapse. These included, in part or in combination, errors on the part of the engineers, contractors, and steel supplier/mill. It has also been argued that then-industry standard procedures in engaging and valuation of engineering services and certification of contractors' work were also contributing factors. Beam size During the design phase, the thickness of the roof beam that failed was reduced by 27% to a size incapable of supporting the loads above, even with lateral bracing. The reasons for this change have not been determined. \\"The beam was greatly under designed. The beam column assembly lacked essential lateral supports. Failure was inevitable. If not under April 23 loads, then under full service loads.\\" November 1987, during construction, a beam in the area of the moving walkway deflected and caused the residential structure above to tilt approximately from vertical. The structural engineers reviewed the design in this area and recommended additional columns, stronger beams, and concrete reinforcing be added. This was done. In December 1987, Wesbild/Station Square hired the MSS Group to conduct a review of the engineering design in this area. They made recommendations, including remedial work to beams with insufficient capacity, to which Tamm Tacy concurred. Both firms later certified that this remedial work has been completed by the contractor. In March 1988 the MSS Group was hired by the tenant, Save-On-Foods, to conduct a structural review of the entire project due to concerns about deflections of roof beams above the store. MSS found two beams to have \\"insufficient capacity\\" and made recommendations for correction. Both engineering firms, the architects, developer, and contractor took steps to initiate this action. The following day Tamm Tacy advised that this remedial work would not be necessary due to the steel mill who had fabricated the beam provided documentation indicating the actual capacity of the beam was significantly greater than documentation used during design. MSS Group advised that the beam was therefore \\"satisfactory to resist the design loadings imposed\\" and \\"this information is a blessing for all concerned\\". Two types of failure occurred: beam bending with buckling of the lower beam flange, and buckling of the beam-column assembly. The first was determined to be the most probable prime failure and the second the less probably prime cause. The beam that failed was a 24 inch () deep wide flange steel beam. Failure occurred at the point where it was supported on top of a steel column. One end of the beam was continuously supported (on other columns) and the other end was cantilevered (not supported on other columns). With the weight of the cars parking on the roof, the beam began to buckle and was photographed to have rotated approximately 90 degrees from the vertical to the horizontal position above the supporting column. For an estimate 4 1/2 minutes, the roof deck and supporting joists sagged and functioned as a form of suspension bridge. Concrete topping The concrete topping on the roof deck was increased from to thickness. The design of the supporting roof joists were increased to account for this increased dead load, but the beam was not. Rooftop sidewalk The width of the rooftop sidewalk was increased from to . The engineer's design called for this to be concrete over styrofoam; the contractor built the extra width of solid concrete. This increase in dead load was not known to the architects and engineers at the time and so no change to supporting structure was investigated. Steel strength The MSS Group recommended strengthening the beam above the column by adding a beam bracket with web stiffeners. This change was not implemented when Tamm Tacy advised that mill certificates obtained from the steel sub- contractor indicated to be 25% higher strength than expected. It was later determined that this type of data is not a truly representative sampling of the steel as fabricated and so is not a valid measure of actual strength. Lateral bracing Lateral bracing can increase the capacity of beams. It can be provided by roof joists or beam web stiffeners. The engineering drawings did not indicate lateral bracing to be provided at the column where the collapse occurred. The engineers did not study the reduced capacity of the beam due to lack of lateral support. Scope of work There was a misunderstanding of who was to determine the need for lateral bracing. The steel subcontractor stated they did not provide web stiffeners to the beam as they weren't indicated on the engineering drawings. Tamm Tacy stated they believed the decision to provide the stiffeners resided with the steel subcontractor's detailer. Live load miscalculation Engineers at the MSS Group made incorrect assumptions about the live loads on the roof deck in checking the design. Industry practices The Commissioner of Inquiry noted three common practices of the development and construction industry were cause for concern: fast-tracking, bidding for professional services, and fragmentation of contractual responsibility. The Fast-track construction process obtaining permits and commencing construction on a portion of the project before the design is fully completed. This process, where \\"time is money\\", can involve significant design changes being made during construction. This can create confusion and delay and significantly increase opportunities for error.Fast-track construction becomes the norm, Barbara Knecht, Architectural Record.

Major recommendations included: Structural reviews It was noted that contrary to the perception of the general public, engineering design, verification, and monitoring of construction lies with professional engineers hired for the project, not the building inspectors. The report recommended that the BC Building Code and Engineers Act be amended to require that structural calculations and drawings be submitted when applying for a building permit; detailed review should be conducted on a random sampling; where warranted the designs should be submitted for detailed review to the professional engineers' governing body; and review costs should be born by municipal levies on building permits. Professional letters of assurance The building code should include province-wide, standard Letters of Assurance, documents that the registered professionals (architects and engineers) responsible for the design would certify that the design conforms to the building codes, will be retained for construction review and, at the end of construction, to certify that the construction conforms with the approved construction documents and codes. This recommendation was implemented in the 1992 edition of the British Columbia Building Code.Modern Building Regulatory System, White Paper, February 2012, British Columbia Ministry of Housing.

The panel noted inadequate design of the roof structure, including the support beams, failure to inspect the construction of the roofs assembly, and failure to direct or check the work on the project of the engineer in training who was directly managing the project. The panel also found that the engineers‚Äô code of ethics had been breached by one of the firm's partners signing and applying his professional seal to plans and specifications that he had not prepared or supervised.

During this time period Maywood/Los Angeles assembled both Mercury and Lincoln branded vehicles (Lincoln-Mercury Division of Ford Motor Company). Mercury was produced from 1948 to 1957, Lincoln from 1949 to 1956. In 1955 it was deemed that the Maywood plant's facilities were not sufficient for the increased amount of production being called on by the demand for new cars on the West Coast of the United States. A new location was selected in nearby Pico Rivera, California and designated at Los Angeles #2. It started operation at the start of August 1957, but due to unfinished paint booths the Maywood plant remained in operation so that Edsel bodies could be sent over from Los Angeles #2 and painted, then trucked back where they were trimmed out and final assembly would take place. In mid-August 1957 all operations ceased at Los Angeles #1. The plant's address was 5801 South Eastern Avenue, in Commerce near Maywood. It was across the street from the Chrysler Los Angeles Assembly plant. The factory was closed and demolished when operations at both the Maywood Assembly and Long Beach Assembly were combined in the new Los Angeles Assembly factory in Pico Rivera, California which opened in the summer of 1957.

After failing to win in eight races on the flat he made an immediate impact when switched to hurdle races, winning his first six races over obstacles including the Summit Junior Hurdle and taking third place in the Triumph Hurdle. After winning only once in the next three years he established himself as a leading staying hurdler in 1999 with wins in the Stayers' Hurdle, Champion Stayers Hurdle and Long Walk Hurdle. He ran his last race in April 2001 and was retired with a record of ten wins and fourteen places from thirty-two starts. Background Anzum was a bay gelding with no white markings bred by the Herefordshire-based Cobhall Court Stud. He was sired by Ardross, an outstanding stayer who won thirteen Group races including two runnings of the Ascot Gold Cup and was British Horse of the Year in 1982. As a breeding stallion he made an impact as a sire of National Hunt horses including the Champion Hurdler Alderbrook, Young Kenny (Scottish Grand National), Avro Anson (Dipper Novices' Chase) and Burgoyne (West Yorkshire Hurdle): he is also the paternal grandsire of Coneygree. Anzum's dam Muznah was a fairly useful racehorse, winning two of her nine races and achieving a Timeform racing of 92 in 1983. She was a great-great- great granddaughter of the broodmare Lost Soul whose other descendants included Hethersett, Neasham Belle and Doyoun. Muznah had previously foaled the Top Novices' Hurdle winner Jazilah and went on to produce the Grade 2 winning hurdler Sh Boom. As a foal, Anzum was sent to the November sale at Doncaster and was bought for 3,400 guineas by David Minton Bloodstock. A year later, he was offered for auction at Tattersalls and was sold for 9,800 guineas to Margaret O'Toole. During his racing career, the gelding was owned by The Old Foresters Partnership. He was initially sent into training with David Nicholson (best known as a trainer of steeplechasers) in Gloucestershire. Racing career Flat racing career Anzum made little impression in four races as a two-year-old in 1993, producing his best effort on his final appearance when he finished third in a ten furlong maiden race at Nottingham Racecourse in October. He failed to win in four attempts as a three-year-old, but showed some signs of ability in maidens and minor handicap races, never finishing worse than third. His best effort probably came when he finished second to the future Chester Cup winner Silence In Court over fourteen furlongs at Nottingham in May. 1994/1995 National Hunt season: novice hurdle races Anzum made his debut over obstacles in a novice hurdle at Bangor-on-Dee Racecourse on 28 October in which he was ridden by Warren Marston and won by nine lengths from Symbol of Success. Marston was again in the saddle when the gelding won a similar event at Newbury Racecourse on 9 November, beating Khatir by nine lengths at odds of 13/8. Two weeks later, ridden by Adrian Maguire he started odds-on favourite at Nottingham and completed his hat-trick, beating Tulu by one and a half lengths. On 10 December, Anzum was moved up in class for the Grade 2 Summit Junior Hurdle at Lingfield Park Racecourse in which he was ridden by Robert Massey. Starting the 10/11 favourite in a seven-runner field on heavy ground, he took the lead approaching the second last and held off the late challenge of the Toby Balding-trained Brave Tornado to win by three-quarters of a length. Anzum took his winning run to five at Warwick Racecourse in January when Marston rode him to a six length win in the Red Rose Novices' Hurdle at odds of 4/9. The gelding's winning streak stretched to six in February when he led from the start in the Stroud Green Hurdle at Newbury and won by twenty lengths from the filly Karline Ka. On 16 March 1995, Anzum raced for the first time at the Cheltenham Festival where he was one of twenty-six four-year-olds to contest the Grade 1 Triumph Hurdle. Ridden by Marton he started the 9/1 third favourite behind Balanak (winner of the Dovecote Novices' Hurdle and Silver Wedge (Queen's Vase, Tolworth Hurdle). After losing ground at the fourth hurdle he made steady progress in the closing stages without ever looking likely to win and finished fourth behind Kissair, Silver Wedge and the subsequently disqualified Dr Leunt. On his final appearance of the season he was sent to Ireland and finished sixth behind Shaihar in the Champion Four Year Old Hurdle at Punchestown. 1995/1996 National Hunt season Anzum appeared only twice in the 1995/1996 National Hunt season. He finished seventh behind Jibber The Kibber in the Silver Trophy Handicap Hurdle at Chepstow Racecourse in November and third in a handicap hurdle at Sandown in December. 1996/1997 National Hunt season After a break of almost a year, Anzum returned in a handicap hurdle over two and three quarter miles at Haydock Park on 26 November 1996. Carrying 160 pounds he was prominent from the start and stayed on well in the closing stages to take the lead in the final strides and won by a head from Burnt Imp with Dally Boy a head away in third. In February he carried top weight of 164 pounds in a two and half mile handicap at Chepstow and finished third behind Brave Tornado and Moorish. Two years after his defeat in the Triumph Hurdle, Anzum returned to the Cheltenham Festival to contest the Stayers' Hurdle over three miles. Starting a 25/1 outsider he was ridden by Richard Johnson in a field which included Escartefigue, What A Question (Long Distance Hurdle), Urubande (Aintree Hurdle), Trainglot (Cesarewitch Handicap), Ocean Hawk (Long Walk Hurdle), Pridwell and Derrymoyle (Tipperkevin Hurdle). Anzum was not among the early leaders and made several jumping errors but stayed on strongly on the run-in to finish second, two and half lengths behind Karshi and two lengths ahead of Paddy's Return. 1998/1999 National Hunt season Anzum missed the whole of the 1997/1998 season before returning in the Grade 1 Long Walk Hurdle at Ascot in December 1998 in which he started a 40/1 outsider and came home seventh of the eight finishers behind Princeful. In January he started at odds of 40/1 in a seven runner field for the Cleeve Hurdle at Cheltenham and finished fifth, more than fifty lengths behind the winner Lady Rebecca. Anzum began to show improvement in his next race, the Rendlesham Hurdle at Kempton Park Racecourse on February. Carrying a relatively light weight of 147 pounds he stayed on well in the closing stages to finish second, eight lengths behind his stablemate Pharanear, with the joint-favourites Pridwell and Ocean Hawk finishing fourth and sixth respectively. On his third appearance at the Cheltenham Festival, Anzum was ridden by Richard Johnson when he started a 40/1 outsider for the 28th running of the Stayers' Hurdle. The 2/1 joint-favourites were Deano's Beeno (winner of the premier Long Distance Hurdle) and Le Coudray a leading French hurdler who had recently been transferred to the Irish stable of Aidan O'Brien. Lady Rebecca, Paddy's Return and Ocean Hawk were also in the field as well as Juyush (Ascot Hurdle), Turnpole (Cesarewitch) and Kerawi (Christmas Hurdle). Racing on good to soft ground, Anzum was not among the early leaders, came under pressure from the seventh hurdle and was only eighth at the third last at which point Deano's Beeno, who had led up to that point, began to weaken and was overtaken by the Irish mare Sallies Girl. On the final turn Lady Rebecca took the lead from Sallies Girl as Le Coudray made rapid progress on the outside and Anzum began to make progress. Lady Rebecca landed in front over the last but was overtaken by Le Coudray who looked certain to win before Anzum produced a very strong late run to take the lead in the final strides and win by a neck. Lady Rebecca finished third ahead of Sallies Girl and Juyush. Nicholson said: \\"I watched the race from the lawn and when they passed me I thought he might get second, but as I went towards the winner's enclosure Arthur Moore told me I'd won it.\\" In April, Anzum was sent to Ireland to contest the Champion Stayers Hurdle at Punchestown Racecourse and started 7/1 third favourite behind Le Coudray and the mare Marello, with the other runners being Mister Morose (November Novices' Chase), Pharanear and Khayrawani (Coral Cup). In contrast to the tactics previously employed, Johnson sent Anzum into the lead from the start and held off several challenges before staying on strongly on the run-in to win by two and a half lengths from Khayrawani. 1999/2000 National Hunt season Anzum began his next campaign in the Long Distance Hurdle at Newbury on 27 November in which he started at odds of 11/2 and finished third, beaten eighteen lengths and a neck by Deano's Beeno and the six-year-old gelding Just Nip. When David Nicholson retired in December, his assistant Alan King took over the stable. On 18 December, Anzum faced Deano's Beeno yet again in the Long Walk Hurdle at Ascot in a six-runner field which also included Pharanear, Ivor's Flutter, Boss Doyle (Mildmay Novices' Chase) and Count Campioni. Anzum tracked Deano's Beeno before taking the lead at the twelfth hurdle and drew well clear of his rival over the last two obstacles to win by seventeen lengths. Anzum started 5/4 favourite for a Grade 2 event at Haydock in January but after making the early running he was overtaken three hurdles out and finished third behind Behrajan and Merry Masquerade. He missed that year's Cheltenham Festival owing to the prevailing firm ground. 2000/2001 National Hunt season Anzum was off the racecourse for just over a year, during which time he was moved to the stable of Richard Phillips at Adlestrop, before returning for the Cloeve Hurdle at Cheltenham on 27 January 2001. Starting the 25/1 outsider against six opponents he finished third behind Lady Rebecca and Mister Banjo with Barton in fifth. On 31 March at Ascot he started 13/8 favourite for the Grade 2 Weatherbys Hurdle and finished second to the Martin Pipe-trained mare Maid Equal to whom he was conceding thirteen pounds. The 2001 Cheltenham Festival had been abandoned owing to the 2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak, but a series of substitute championship races were run at Sandown at the end of April. Anzum contested the Distance Championship, a substitute for the Stayers' Hurdle and started 8/1 third fourth choice in the betting behind Baracouda, Bacchanal and Behrajan. He was never in serious contention and finished last of the eleven runners behind Baracouda.

The Bruttians marched with an army against Croton, and as the lower parts, which were inhabited by the people, were open and easy of access, they soon gained possession of them. Aristomachus, however, as if he had nothing to do with the Bruttians, withdrew to the arx, where the nobles were assembled and defended themselves. The Bruttians in conjunction with the people of Croton besieged the nobles in the arx, and when they found that they made no impression, they applied to Hanno the Elder for Carthaginian assistance. He proposed to the Crotoniats to receive the Bruttians as colonists within the extensive but deserted walls of their city. But all the Crotoniats, with the exception of Aristomachus, declared that they would rather die than submit to this. As Aristomachus, who had betrayed the town, was unable to betray the arx also, he saw no way but to take to flight, and he accordingly went over to Hanno. The Crotoniats soon after quitted their town altogether and migrated to Locri. Livy XXIV 2, 3.

Ugly Stik is best known for its fishing rods. Shakespeare, originally called William Shakespeare, Jr. Company, was founded by William Shakespeare, Jr. in 1897 in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The William Shakespeare, Jr. Company changed its name to Shakespeare in 1915, then moved its base of operations to Columbia, South Carolina in 1970. In 1976, Shakespeare introduced the Ugly Stik rod. About One of the characteristics of the Ugly Stik rod that made it such a success when it was first introduced was the way it was built. Shakespeare used the Howald process, which was first used in the ‚ÄúWonderod‚Äù in 1947. This rod was invented by Dr. Arthur M. Howald, and it would forever change the way Shakespeare would build rods. The process used by Howald in building this Wonderod was perfected by Shakespeare, and was used in building the first Ugly Stik rods. The rods made using this method included ‚Äúan internal spiral fiberglass core and parallel glass fibers impregnated with pigmented polyester resin‚Äù, which was then covered in several layers of tape to hold these components together while they ‚Äúcured in an oven‚Äù. The tape was then removed with high pressure water jets. Ugly Stik rods today are still made using the Howald process, but materials and methods have been tweaked considering the changes in technology since 1976. The modern Ugly Stik rods can be bent into a circle without snapping, which can be credited to the Howald process. The construction process of Ugly Stik rods means a finished product that is sturdy and stiff, yet flexible. Sensitivity is also a large part of Ugly Stik‚Äôs success, as newer models are also built using graphite in the center of the fiberglass wraps. While the fiber glass provides the strength and stiffness that fishing demands, the graphite provides sensitivity. Ugly Stik got its name from the \\"ugly\\" appearance of their first rods. The first Ugly Stik rods were very large, featured metal handles, the graphite color showed through the blank, and the wraps were black with white pinstripes. Over the years, the appearance of Ugly Stik rods evolved into the now recognizable ‚Äúred and yellow basket weave‚Äù design near the handle, a shiny jet-black finish, and a clear tip. Shakespeare did not just manufacture fishing tackle. During World War I, their ‚Äúfactory was converted to manufacture mortar fuses and automobile carburetors‚Äù. In World War II, Shakespeare manufactured controls for tanks, automobiles, and aircraft. ‚ÄúShakespeare also manufactured the first fiberglass radio antennas, golf club shafts, pool cues, archery equipment, and numerous industrial materials‚Äù. From 1968 to 1986, Shakespeare manufactured trolling motors. Today, Shakespeare also sells non-fishing related Ugly Stik products, such as car decals, hats, glasses, and clothing.

He was a German (Teutonicus in contemporary records), appointed by the Emperor Henry V to bring Tuscany back under imperial control. During the long Investiture Controversy, the Tuscan countess Matilda of Canossa had taken the ecclesiastical side against the emperor and imperial influence in the Tuscan margraviate was at low ebb upon her death in 1115. Conrad was the second in a series of 12th-century German appointees who proved too weak to restore imperial control and whose tenures are associated with the rise of self- government in the Tuscan cities‚ÄîFlorence, Genoa, Lucca, Pisa and Siena. Origins His family and his place of birth are unidentified, although two conflicting lines of evidence both point to Bavaria. While in Tuscany, he donated land to the Bavarian abbey of Saints Ulrich and Afra. The land in question suggests he might have been a relative of the counts of Scheyern (or Scheiern). On the other hand, a note was added to the back of a diploma of King Conrad III confirming the donation to Ulrich and Afra, and which seems indicated that the margrave was a ministerialis originally from a village named Weilach, near Schrobenhausen. Conrad's obscurity has been likened to that of Werner, also appointed by Emperor Henry V to important positions in Italy. Henry appointed Conrad margrave after the death of Margrave Rabodo in battle against Florence in 1119. Like his predecessor, Conrad did not enjoy the loyalty of the Tuscans‚Äîwho perceived him as a foreigner‚Äîand the resources to sustain imperial power in the margraviate. Given their obscure backgrounds, probably neither Rabodo nor Conrad were equipped with the administrative experience or the local knowledge required for ruling such a rich and populous province as Tuscany. Prior to 1115, Tuscany was ruled by a local dynasty with extensive allodial properties to support it. Rule in Tuscany There is no record of exactly when Conrad was appointed margrave. It must have been after the death of his predecessor in 1119 and before the first document naming him as ruling in Tuscany in 1120. He arrived in Tuscany with a small attachment of Germans, but he soon managed to raise an army and make a tour of his margraviate \\"dispensing justice\\" (pro iustitia facienda). At the time, the settlement of the extensive Cadolingi inheritance had not yet been resolved. Count Hugh, last of the Cadolingi, had died five years earlier in 1113. By his will he divided his extensive possessions, which spanned all the counties of Tuscany, with part going to his creditors and the other part to his widow, Cecilia, provided that she did not remarry. She did remarry and her four sons by Hugh disputed the inheritance with her second husband. The Tuscan communes and Bishop Benedict I of Lucca also claimed portions. Conrad was dragged into a conflict with the latter over lands he claimed were imperial fiefs and which the bishop claimed should belong to the diocese. The Tuscan cities had taken advantage of the Investiture Controversy to increase their autonomy. Lucca and Pisa were identified strongly with the imperial cause, while Florence was identified with that of the church. The cities were also developing strong rivalries. Coastal Pisa and Genoa competed for trading monopolies, and Florence and Siena were traditional rivals in central Tuscany. In this situation, Conrad generally favoured Lucca above the rest and spent the years 1120‚Äì22 in wars with Florence. In 1120, Conrad granted a privilege to Lucca at the expense of Pisa. In this privilege, consuls appear for the first time representing the city of Lucca. The formal recognition Conrad gave to the consuls‚Äîthe title itself only appears in Lucchese records for the first time the previous year (1119)‚Äîplaced the communal government that the city had been building up since the 1080s on a more solid foundation. The local aristocracy likewise aligned with the cities and for or against the empire. Conrad gave his support to the Guidi counts, allies of Lucca, against the Alberti counts, allies of Florence. In October 1120, with the help of the leading Guidi count, Guido Guerra II, and the commune of Lucca, Conrad besieged the castle of Pontormo, which was being claimed as a fief by the Alberti. With Conrad's support, the Guidi also built a fortified town bordering Alberti lands by compelling the residents of the territory around the pieve (baptismal church) of Sant'Andrea in Empoli to move nearer the church and to construct a wall and towers there for their defence. In April 1121, Conrad was encamped around Passignano in the Val di Pesa, probably engaged in military action against the Alberti. He did not by this show of force secure any influence in Florence. With the resolution of the Investiture Controversy by the Concordat of Worms (23 September 1122), the Florentine commune and the Alberti seem finally to have accepted Conrad's authority. In October 1122, Conrad presided over a placitum, a large assembly for hearing cases and dispensing justice, outside Florence. This is possibly the last placitum held by a Tuscan margrave. On 24 October, a provost and canon of the Florentine church appeared before the tribunal. The priests charged one Bonifacio di Tegrimo with having unlawfully occupied a parcel of land. Conrad found in their favour. Since this occurred within the limits of the Florentine contado (county) and during the episcopate of the Alberti bishop Goffredo, it is likely that the Florentines had made their peace with the margrave after more than three years of warfare with Conrad and his predecessor. This apparent d√©tente does not seem to have affected the Guidi, who nevertheless remained on good terms with Conrad. By 1123 certain cattani (captains) loyal to the Guidi had occupied the rocca (hilltop castle) of Fiesole overlooking Florence. While Count Guido and Conrad were absent from Tuscany (1123/4), the Florentines attacked Fiesole and besieged it. The siege dragged on for three years before the Fiesolans were starved into submission and their Etruscan walls razed to the ground (1125/6). Guido died in 1124, probably before ever returning to Tuscany. Conrad apparently made no move to defend Fiesole. In the late 1120s, Conrad supported Genoa in its war with Pisa, and he tried to cultivate an alliance with Florence in order to draw them away from their support for Pisa. It is in this context that, in 1127, he granted Bishop Goffredo the right to be provided lodging (albergaria) in the parish (plebatus) comprising Campoli, Decimo and Bossolo. Conrad also took the side of Lucca in the city's economic war with Pisa, and in 1128 he sided with the Siena against Pisa, and assisted the Sienese to capture the castle of Bolgheri from the Pisan noble family of the Gherardeschi. The last record of Conrad's rule dates to 1129, but there is no record of his death nor of a successor in Tuscany prior to 1131. In that year the margrave of Tuscany was one Rampret (Rempotto). Conrad issued more private diplomas than any other 12th-century margrave of Tuscany. In later sources he is sometimes confused with King Conrad II of Italy (died 1101). Imperial agent in Italy As a loyal German and high-ranking imperial official in Italy, Conrad several times acted outside of Tuscany on behalf of the emperor. After the canonically-elected Pope Callistus II established himself in Rome in 1120, Conrad was urged to go to the aid of the Antipope Gregory VIII, who had the backing of the emperor. In 1121, he and his nephew Frederick went to Sutri to protect the antipope, who had fled Rome, and was being besieged by Callistus. There they were joined by Werner, margrave of Ancona, but were unable to prevent Gregory from being captured by papal forces on 22 April and imprisoned in the monastery of La Cava. In 1124, Conrad was absent from Tuscany while he intervened in the Romagna on behalf of Count Guido, who was at war with the counts of Cuneo. There is evidence from a charter of 31 March 1121 and another of 4 September 1129, that Conrad perhaps exercised some public authority in the Romagna. In these charters he claimed to be \\"[by divine right] duke of Ravenna and chief and margrave of Tuscany\\" ([Conradus divina gratia] Ravennatum dux et Tusci[a]e preses et [ac] marchio). This may indicate that his authority was extended at some point into the former exarchate of Ravenna, but other than a pair of charters and the brief war with Cuneo (in which Guido Guerra was killed), there is no other record of Conrad as \\"duke of Ravenna\\". Henry V died in 1125 and, since left no son, the succession was disputed. It is unknown whether Conrad backed either of the main candidates, Lothair of Supplinburg or Conrad of Hohenstaufen. The latter is known to have tried to gain support in Italy after Lothair's election in 1127, but there is no indication that the margrave of Tuscany supported him.

The band also announces to tour Japan in April!  History of F.O.D.   Origins of F.O.D. F.O.D. started in 2008 as a Green Day cover band. The Belgian music website Musiczine describes how the Antwerpen based formation started out 'with the goal of playing the album Dookie in its entirety'. Their name is a reference to a song on the 1994 album Dookie, called F.O.D. (short for 'Fuck Off and Die...').  Dance To This (2011), Ontario (2013)  After 3 years of playing Green Day songs to various crowds in Belgium and Europe, F.O.D. started writing their own material. This resulted in the 2011 EP release 'Dance To This', followed by a 2013 album release 'Ontario'. Both were released by record label Thanks But No Thanks Records. Belgian newspaper Gazet van Antwerpen reports that 1.000 copies of 'Ontario' were pressed. 'Ontario' was also available on 12\\" vinyl. This version included two bonus tracks: 'Water Falls' and 'Everything'.  Tricks Of The Trade (2014)  On 23 September 2014, F.O.D. released their second album, called Tricks Of The Trade.

As before it was released worldwide, on same 4 record labels: Funtime Records (Belgium), Effervescence Records (Europe), Bird Attack Records (North America) and Bells On Records (Japan). 'Harvest', a darker album, written in the slipstream of a divorce. The melodies are still there, more soaring than ever, but the overall mood is a bit less happy, the music a bit more aggressive. Again the band releases the album at their own festival.  Punkrock 4 Life (2017)  On November 8th 2017, F.O.D. released a new single for charity: ‚ÄúHope For A Moment‚Äù by F.O.D. & Friends.

The special features Brett Gelman as a demented version of himself, along with several guests, who also play fictionalized characters of themselves. Gelman and Woliner had frequently collaborated on other projects before producing the special. On its broadcast on April 24, 2014, the special was positively received by critics. A sequel, titled Dinner with Family with Brett Gelman and Brett Gelman's Family, aired February 13, 2015, featuring Gelman as he reenacts his childhood to his parents on their anniversary. Plot Brett Gelman hosts a dinner party with Dale Dickey, Gilbert Gottfried, Alex Karpovsky, Fred Melamed, Alison Pill, and Lance Reddick. Gelman shows himself to have an evil side as the party goes on. When the guests have enough, he reveals this to be a prank. Karpovsky leaves, however, Joey Fillipiano (Anthony Atamanuik) warns that there is no escape. In order to bond better, following his misbehavior, he makes the remaining five reveal their innermost secret to each other in clandestine. After they receive their entr√©es, Gelman tells that he has devised a play starring each of the remaining five. He blackmails them with a recording of their telling of secrets‚Äîand threatens to tie them up just as Karpovsky has been‚Äîif they fail to comply. The five recite the play, but Gelman stops it, unamused. When police sirens sound, he instructs the guests to ambush the officers using the handguns they are given. It turns out to be a chimpanzee dressed in a police uniform, and everyone is relieved until a henchman informs Gelman that they are short a gun. Gottfried, who has it, threatens to shoot Gelman. Gelman convinces him to hand over the gun, with which he then uses to murder Gottfried. Gelman forces Melamed to bury his corpse outside with a shovel. He uses it to attack Gelman, along with the rest. Afterward, Gelman wakes up and explains he must have had a psychotic episode. He laments the murder of Gottfried before revealing this to be a farce and that what he has done was planned from the start. He decides to let them go, informing that he will be following them for the rest of their lives. Production Dinner with Friends was created and written by Brett Gelman and Jason Woliner (the latter is also the director). The two had been frequent collaborators for several years since they met at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre. Gelman stars on Eagleheart, for which Woliner writes and directs. On the set of the show, Woliner came up with the plot of the special, which had Gelman deliver a stand-up to a table of six. When they pitched the idea to Adult Swim, they suggested to scrap the stand-up part. The half-hour special was filmed in two days. Gelman and \\"friends\\" star as fictionalized characters of themselves. Gelman considered his character, which he developed on his Gelmania podcast and UCB performance of the same name, exaggerated, yet somewhat identical, to his own. Woliner and Gelman were inspired by the works of Lars von Trier and Michael Haneke, as well as Dinner for Five. He saw it as a combination of Dinner for Five and The Shining, as well as of Saw. He categorized the special as comedy horror and a play, though he sought to clarify that it was entirely scripted. Gelman chose to star the guests for their wide range of talent, calling Gottfried a \\"heartbreaking\\" drama actor despite being a comedian by trade. Broadcast and reception Dinner with Friends premiered on Adult Swim on April 24, 2014. This broadcast was seen by 1.3 million viewers, receiving a Nielsen rating of 0.6 for adults in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic. In this same demographic, it was the seventeenth most viewed of the top 100 cable shows. In GQ, Jen Ortiz called it \\"surreal\\" and \\"hilarious\\". Sydney Bucksbaum of Zap2it wrote that viewers should watch it with an open mind, discarding expectations and inhibitions, because \\"you have never seen anything quite like this, and you probably won't ever see anything quite like it again\\". Bradford Evans of Splitsider called its pacing stand-out and its blending of horror and comedy exceptionally unique, writing that it was \\"genuinely suspenseful and frightening in parts\\". In LA Weekly, Liz Ohanesian compared its pacing to Eagleheart, making for plot twists \\"more bizarre than an audience member can anticipate\\". Sequels A sequel aired February 13, 2015. Titled Dinner with Family with Brett Gelman and Brett Gelman's Family, it features Gelman as he hosts a dinner party with his parents (Barry Primus and Barbara Gruen) for their anniversary. When he reenacts scenes from his childhood on-stage with actors playing the part of his parents (Tony Roberts and Patti LuPone), the dinner takes a terrifying turn as suicide, incest, and drug addiction are revealed in Gelman's past and present. Plans for a sequel were discussed as early as the first one approached its air date. Gelman found that the dinner format made for a more traumatic environment once horror was introduced because of its inherent tranquility. The producers reached out to Roberts and LuPone's agents, to which the actors expressed enjoyment at the script, though Roberts was repulsed at first. Gelman wrote in a cover letter to Roberts and LuPone that he and Gelman would avoid shock humour, instead aiming for a dialog about dysfunctional families in a hyperbolic manner. On this topic of families, the two chose it as big theme of life, and so he wanted to go for a darker direction compared to the last. He found that continuity was limited, with the exception of Atamanuik's character, while also referring to it as a companion piece of the last. The debut broadcast of Dinner with Family was seen by 1.1 million viewers, receiving a Nielsen rating of 0.5 for the aforementioned demographic of Dinner with Friends and becoming the twenty- sixth most viewed of the top 100 cable shows in it. Garrett Martin of Paste called both the sequel and the original \\"hilarious and incredibly hard to watch\\". A second sequel, Dinner in America with Brett Gelman, premiered on July 1, 2016. Its guests include Loretta Devine, Shareeka Epps, Joe Morton, and Mack Wilds.

Nadezhda said: \\"I live and write with love to my crazy time‚Äù. She was a philologist and a musician by education, a playwright by vocation. Although she died at the age of 44, she was referred to as ‚ÄúThe most gifted screenwriter of the perestroika epoch‚Äù.60 anniversary of the birth of Nadezhda Kozhushanaya, Russia-K, 15 March 2012  Biography and creative work  Childhood  Nadezhda Kozhushanaya (Yamshanova), was born in Sverdlovsk (Yekaterinburg). Her father was Pavel Ivanovich Yamshanov (the Chief Engineer of a laboratory of the Uralmash plant), who had a rich library of art books and fiction. Her mother was Glafira Mihailovna Yamshanova (Smirnova) (a teacher at a local Metallurgical Technical College). Her parents divorced when Nadezhda was eight. From an early age Nadezhda wrote her own stories and fairy tales. Her story \\"Pustiak\\" was based on her first dramatic experience of reading aloud for the class .  University  After school 1968 Nadezhda went to A.M. Gorky Ural State University to study philology. She actively took part as an actress and an accompanist in student theatres of the University and Ural State Academy of Architecture and Arts. She composed music and easily played in the piano, guitar and accordion that gave a nudge to the decision to study in the Urals Mussorgsky State Conservatoire, but her mother made a requirement that Nadezhda should graduate the University first. In preparation to her thesis, Nadezhda worked in the museum of Muranovo, where she also gave guided tours about Fyodor Tyutchev. After graduation, according to the common Soviet practice, she was posted as a teacher of Russian to a remote village of Kunara, Sverdlovsk Oblast. In 1975 Nadezhda married Boris Kozhushany and moved to Moscow, where her husband studied at the Moscow Architectural Institute.  Moscow  In Moscow, first she had a clerical job (later she wrote comic stories about it). Plays and other works of this period almost did not survive, but it was the time when she created her own style. Nadezhda said: ¬´Everything that I wrote is needed to be read aloud¬ª. On 1 December 1980 her daughter Ekaterina was born. In 1982‚Äì1984 Nadezda studied at the High Courses for Scriptwriters and Film Directors in Moscow as a Screenwriter. After her admission interview, Valentin Chernykh, one of the leaders of the courses, formulated his reluctance to take Nadezhda as: ‚ÄúShe is a person with the character like Gennady Shpalikov, Vladimir Vysotsky, Oleg Dahl.

She also appears in the anime adaptation where she is voiced by Ami Koshimizu. Himari's character design was created simply, but Matra became bogged down on other things such as naming of the main heroine. In the story, Himari is shown to be a bakeneko or demon cat, a type of Japanese spirit known as a y≈çkai. Reception of her character by English- language media has been mostly positive with writers often calling her a good lead character based on her traits. In both the anime and manga series she is the descendant of a y≈çkai that was spared rather than being killed by a demon slayer family. As a result, she and her ancestors have sworn to protect its members. Yuto Amakawa, being the current heir to the family, is thus under her care. As the series progresses she shows that she deeply cares for and loves Yuto, but struggles with demons within herself. At the end of the series, Yuto saves Himari and confesses his love back to her. The anime differs from the manga when it comes to the final battle at the end. Creation and conception alt=Voice actress Ami Koshimizu smiling in a photo taken at Waseda University in November 2008 When creating Himari, author Milan Matra opted to go for an easily drawn character. He soon came up with her design, but became stuck in regards to her name and her style of speech. Eventually he decided on the name Himari and an old-fashioned speech style. Himari was originally going to have short hair in the final chapter but Matra decided to go with long hair, and use the short haired designs for her evil side, Black Himari, which appears earlier in the series. Matra describes Himari's appearance on the cover of the first volume as the \\"first he had ever done\\". In order to attract readers, Matra stated that he drew Himari in a way that was unusual for her character whom is usually serious. He described her smile as \\"gentle\\" which is something that would never be seen in the story itself. Himari also has a sister named Hime who was originally going to be a male character. Matra made the change saying that he did not want his readers to wrap their hearts around two different male characters which would have also impacted Himari's storyline. When asked at a book fair in Taiwan why he chose a cat to represent the main character, Matra replied that he thinks that cats in general are cute. In the story, Himari states that her mother died while giving birth to her while her father might have been another species of demon cat, or possibly a stray. Himari's character is voiced by Ami Koshimizu in the anime adaptation. She was chosen for the role during a series of interviews, then was photographed along with the other chosen cast for promotional shots. Koshimizu described her feelings about Himari in another interview when asked what she liked best. She said that while Himari has great mental abilities and can fight, she is still a girl who cares about various things. Koshimizu went on to say that it was difficult to \\"add or subtract\\" Himari's feelings about being a y≈çkai. In addition to voicing Himari, Koshimizu also sings the ending song called BEAM my BEAM after each episode. Appearances In the manga Himari first appears in chapter one of the manga \\"The Cat, The Girl, and The Allergy\\". After saving Yuto from an ayakashi, she later introduces herself to him and explains that he comes from a family of demon slayers. She goes on to say that at some point one of the members of his family spared and tamed one of her ancestors, choosing compassion rather than reward, and as a result she vows to protect him. Himari soon takes on the last name \\"Noihara\\" in order to blend in more, Yuto comments that the name is the area from where his grandparents were from. Aside from the ancestor reasoning, Himari shows strong feelings towards Yuta, asking him out on a date and letting him choose her clothing among other things. It is later revealed that Himari was an important person to Yuto during his childhood which helps their relationship grow. Being a y≈çkai, Himari finds herself torn between her desire to protect Yuto, and her nature as a bloodthirsty demon cat. Through research, Shizuku informs Yuto that Himari's ancestors were the type of evil y≈çkai that killed and ate humans, saying that Himari takes pleasure in the hunt and loses herself to the bloodlust. Initially, Himari does not realize when she loses control, describing it as if her heart was swallowed up into a black pool. Himari eventually acknowledges that she is a beast after a fight with Kuesu, but she is tended to by Yuto. In response Himari kisses him, saying that it is a \\"gift of mercy\\" for letting her stay by his side. Towards the end of the series in the fight against Tamamo-no-Mae, Himari bites her, absorbing most of her demonic powers. This results in Himari losing control of her darker demonic half, which eventually becomes visible to those around her. The series ends after Yuto enters into Himari's subconscious, and saves her before her darker half takes full control of her heart. In the anime Himari's appearance in the anime follows that of the manga with the difference being the ending. She first appears in episode one \\"Cat and Girl and Allergy\\", where, as in the manga, she saves Yuto from an ayakashi and explains to him who she is and why she is protecting him. The ending of the anime differs from the manga when it comes to the final battle. Tama the nine-tailed fox is defeated by Himari, who chose to give in to her darkness (her vicious ayakashi side/energy) while fighting her. Yuto hugs Himari, turning her back to her good self, and uses his light ferry to turn her into \\"Super Himari\\". With this added power, Himari goes to defeat Shuten-douji and wins, ending the anime after a characters reunion. When referring to Himari in the anime, distributor Kadokawa describes her character as old-fashioned with a demonic nature, who likes to snuggle. Reception Reception of Himari's character in English- language media has been mostly positive. T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews called Himari an okay character when she is not threatening Yuto or getting upset at the other girls that he has around him. While referencing the anime adaptation, Erin Finnegan from Anime News Network called the character designs in general \\"solid\\", aside from Yuto. Paul Jensen, also from Anime News Network said that Himari is a good \\"demon girl with a dark side\\" heroine character. Jensen did say though that the overall character designs are starting to show their age seven years after the series' first release. Chris Beveridge from Mania reviewed the third volume of the manga series which included a glimpse into her character. In the review he describes Himari's kiss scene in which she wants to experience what a kiss is like for the first time. Chris commented; \\"There's a pleasant innocence about her as she works through it and finds the situation turning to her favor for actually trying it\\". In contrast, Ross Liversidge of UK Anime Network reviewed the first volume of the manga in which he called Himari's character overly \\"stereotyped\\". Ross also said that although she is \\"kick-ass\\" while using her sword, she has no idea about modern life. Chris Kincaid from Japan Powered called Himari's anime appearance \\"interesting\\". In his review he compares her character to Inuyashas manga title character as she has a protector mentality, but is \\"torn between the human world and her demon nature\\".

He mapped remote areas of the American West for the United States Geological Survey (USGS). His maps coincided with the development of those areas into national parks. He is one of the founders of the Association of American Geographers and served as its president. Matthes resolved a dispute about formation of the Yosemite Valley and his findings on glaciers introduced the terms nivation and Little Ice Age. Childhood Fraternal twins Fran√ßois and Gerard were born in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, to distinguished parents. Father, Willem Ernst Matthes [1842 - 1906], was partner of the successful firm Matthes and Bormeester, importers of colonial rubber, indigo and hemp from the Dutch East Indies. He was also a director of Natura Artis Magistra, president of Felix Meritis, founder of a riding academy and Lieutenant Colonel for the National Guard artillery unit in Amsterdam. Fran√ßois's mother, Jonkvrouw Johanna Susanna (van der Does de Bije) Matthes [1851 - 1934], was a descendant of Jan van der Does, who had led the led the resistance against the Spanish during the Siege of Leiden. The couple had married in Amsterdam . Their home was a mansion on the Heeren Gracht near Vijzelstraat. The twins were their only children. During a vacation at Biarritz in France, the boys discovered that boulders strewn along the shore contained fossils. They broke open rocks with small hammers and carried their favorite fossils back to their room. When it came time to depart for home, their collection had grown so heavy that their mother insisted it all be left. At a young age, both boys were instructed in technical drawing with pencil, charcoal and ink on tracing linen with T-square and triangle. The art of Frederic Remington was a drawing inspiration to Fran√ßois, as his surviving sketch books attest with pages of animals, in particular horses. Around age eight, the boys exhibited symptoms of malaria. The disease was common in Amsterdam from mosquitoes freely breeding in the canals but the vector relationship was not yet understood. The family doctor recommended that the boys be removed for a few years to recover up into the Alps. The decision to go turned into their permanent departure from their Amsterdam home. During breaks from school over the next years, the family would vacation at various alpine resorts. One momentous destination for Fran√ßois was Bossons Glacier at Mont Blanc. Willem, during short visits, also taught the boys mountaineering and their favorite climb was Dent de Jaman. A gift of General Dufour series cloth-mounted military maps came with their father's personal training. They would orient with the maps during excursions into the mountains to collect insects. Education In 1884, the twins left for Switzerland with their mother to attend a school for foreign students at Courgevaux. They took residence for a year in a wing of a nearby castle and learned the French language. During the next two years (1885‚Äì87) they relocated to Montreux where they included German language among their classes to prepare for studies in Frankfurt, Germany. At Frankfurt, the boys acquired their fourth language, English. Willem had directed his sons to learn \\"live\\" languages and avoid both Latin and Ancient Greek. The boys attended the technical high school Klingerschule and were lodged at the residence of one their instructors with four other classmates. They took courses fundamental to their anticipated engineering degrees from a German university. A visiting Harvard professor persuaded both boys to go instead to the United States. In September, 1891 the brothers embarked to the United States but a violent storm disabled their ship. They arrived in New York days behind schedule. The semester was in progress when they sought admission to Massachusetts Institute of Technology. When their entrance exam scores indicated the brothers were only deficient in American history, President Francis Walker intervened on their behalf and entered them into a civil engineering curriculum. Fran√ßois reciprocated Walker's aid by writing a tribute, The Military Career of General Walker, for the college yearbook. A professor, who had been affiliated with the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, steered the brothers into taking geodetic courses. Their newest language English presented no obstacle. They delivered oral presentations to the school's Civil Engineering Society. Fran√ßois spoke on topics such as Draining of the Zuiderzee and Use of Mattresses in Dike Construction. Both boys were also active members of the Agassiz Association of Boston due to their interests in entomology. They donated their collection of insects from Switzerland to the Boston Society of Natural History. Among talks Fran√ßois delivered to the group were Coleoptera, Parasitic Insects and Insect Life in Water. During the 1892 summer break, both brothers vacationed in the White Mountains resuming their alpine pastimes - camping, mountaineering, orienteering, collecting insects. Through the summer of 1893, they were employed by an insurance company to make drawings of various industrial fire- protection equipment. They also travelled to Chicago to visit the World's Columbian Exposition. For the summer of 1894 they attended a M.I.T. field school in the Adirondack Mountains learning to map with an alidade and plane table and to measure stream flow of the Ausable River with various current meters. Graduation for the brothers on came with honors and a Bachelor of Science degree. In 1896, both became citizens of the United States. Topographic Years On , Matthes started his first job as an instrument man and draftsman for the city engineer's office of Rutland, Vermont. He helped create detailed topographic surveys within the city. One year later, he joined the United States Geological Survey and remained for the next fifty-one years until his retirement. From through , he remained in New England as a traverse man. He then was promoted to field assistant and worked in the Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). For a time, he performed as the acting head draftsman, in charge of revision work in the field. On , after passing the federal Civil Service examination, he advanced in grade to assistant topographer. The Geological Survey had determined to map little known remote areas of the western United States and Matthes' assignments over the next years were: * 1898: during summer, resumed the survey, started by H.S. Wallace, of the Cloud Peak quadrangle in Wyoming. * 1899: during summer, finished the Cloud Peak quadrangle in Wyoming. * 1900: during spring, a hydrographic reconnaissance of the Blackfoot Indian Reservation in Montana. * 1900: during summer, the Chief Mountain quadrangle in Montana. * 1900-01: during winter, the Bradshaw Mountains quadrangle in Arizona. * 1901: during summer, the Browning quadrangle in Montana. * 1902: during summer, started the Grand Canyon quadrangle in Arizona. * 1902-03: during winter, the Jerome quadrangle in Arizona. * 1903: during summer, completed the Grand Canyon quadrangle in Arizona. * 1904: Matthes began a postgraduate degree in geology at Harvard University, majoring in geomorphology under Professor William Morris Davis. He also lectured under an Austin Teaching Fellowship about topographic methods to advanced geology students. * 1905: during spring, with only a few weeks left to complete his degree, Matthes was offered the opportunity to map the Yosemite Valley in California. Due to the short season for field work in the Sierra Nevada mountain range, Matthes immediately accepted the assignment and abandoned his degree. * 1905: during summer, started the Yosemite quadrangle, which presented him with more difficulties than had the Grand Canyon. * 1906: during spring, Matthes was assigned to Berkeley, California to assist Grove Karl Gilbert study transportation of sediment in rivers. On April 18, both men witnessed the devastation across the bay caused by the San Francisco earthquake. Their study postponed, Gilbert was appointed to the California State Earthquake Investigating Commission and directed Matthes to map the San Andreas Fault. His maps were published by the commission in their two volume findings. * 1906: during summer, completed Yosemite quadrangle. * 1907-13: through these years, Matthes served as Inspector of Topographic Surveys for the Western United States. He would, during summer, visit the scattered field parties and, during winter, supervise the drafting and inking of their field manuscripts in Washington, DC.. * 1910: during summer, started the Mount Rainier quadrant in Washington. * 1911: during summer, continued Mount Rainier, but completed only the southwestern quarter due to poor visibility from bad weather and forest fires. That was his last major field assignment for the Topographic Branch. As party chief at the Wyoming quadrangle, Matthes' effectively organized his crew and equipment for long pack trips through remote areas, physically strenuous to access and traverse. His techniques in working the alidade and plane table \\"contributed notably to the effectiveness of mapping rugged mountain areas\\". On he was promoted to the rank of full topographer. Matthes believed topographers should not merely draw lines but also study the geology of the land forms to produce relevant maps. To that end, Matthes wrote his first scientific publication during the winter of 1899 entitled Glacial Sculpture of the Bighorn Mountains, Wyoming which served as a standard reference and in which Matthes applied the first usage of the term \\"nivation\\". His geologic writing was not a customary effort for topographers and his descriptive style was critiqued by the USGS but the popularity of his narratives continues today. Marriage Edith Lovell Coyle [ - ] was born and raised in Washington, DC. Her father was Randolph Coyle [ - ] who had served as Assistant District Attorney for the District of Columbia until his death. Her mother Mary Lovell (Radford) Coyle [ - ] was the daughter of Rear Admiral William Radford. Edith's schooling and European travels with her aunt, Sophie Radford de Meissner, allowed conversations with Matthes in German and French as well as English. Fran√ßois and Edith were married at noon on . Reverend George Freeland Peter performed a small ceremony at the Washington, D.C. home of Stephen Kearny Radford, uncle to Edith. Walter Mendenhall acted as the best man for Matthes. Later that day, the couple departed for the state of Washington so Matthes could resume mapping Mount Rainier. Edith accompanied Matthes to his remote expeditions and contributed as his assistant. Normally, their commute to work was by horseback, but when the terrain was not too rugged, she delivered him by car and returned for him in the evening. To alleviate concern for her safety, despite the remoteness, she waited with the doors locked and a geologist's pick beside her for defense. They had no children. Geologic years Matthes had written and lectured about geomorphology during his topographic years. A series of geological essays about the Yosemite Valley which he had contributed to the Sierra Club Bulletin were popular. On the Geological survey moved Matthes from the Topographic to the Geographic Branch, the first ever such transfer. During his geologic years, he would still resort to contour lines in his field notes to depict the land forms he studied. His first assignment and main focus over the next sixteen years was to determine the origin of the Yosemite Valley, a specific request to the USGS from the Sierra Club. Matthes referred to the area as the Incomparable Valley. A formation controversy raged over Josiah Whitney‚Äôs block-fault hypothesis and John Muir‚Äôs belief that glaciers were largely responsible. In the fall of 1930, Matthes' report Geologic History of the Yosemite Valley (USGS Professional Paper 160) resolved the debate. Professor Kirk Bryan wrote \\"Occasionally in the history of science there appears a work so excellent, so comprehensive, that it becomes immediately a classic\\". Demand for this title exceeded any previous USGS Professional Paper and a first printing edition is coveted by collectors. Special assignments would interrupt his research in the Sierra Nevada Range: * During World War I he was sent to military sites Camp McClellan, Alabama and Camp Gordon, Georgia to describe their geologic environments. * Just after the war, he participated in the Joseph LeConte lecture series on three consecutive days in Yosemite starting . The first and third days were conducted at an indoor pavilion but the second lecture was delivered at Glacier Point, above the valley floor. * From 1928 to 1934, he worked geologic problems along the Mississippi Valley in the Midwestern United States. As chairman of the Committee on Glaciers of the American Geophysical Union, he began and oversaw a program to collect photographs and measurements of glaciers in the United States. Matthes annually published a detailed summary and analysis of glacial data in the Transactions magazine from 1932 through 1946. The year-to-year changes became an authority for \\"the elusive record of pre-historic, post- Pleistocene fluctuations of climate\\". In 1935 and through 1936, Matthes began reconnaissance of Sequoia National Park in a cooperative assignment with the National Park Service. His data was urgently needed, so pending a later detailed formal report, Matthes summarized his findings in three volumes with his annotated photographs. The Sequoia Albums proved invaluable to the park service but The Geologic History of Mount Whitney was the only other publication he completed from his investigation. In 1937 Matthes resumed studies in Yosemite and reached the east front of the Sierra Nevada. There, he determined the eastern escarpment had been formed during early Pleistocene faulting, placing the origin more recent than had been previously calculated. He returned to the area over the next two years to gather supporting evidence. In July 1939 as part of the meeting of the Cordilleran Section of the Geological Society of America, Matthes led an excursion party into the Yosemite Valley and out to the eastern escarpment. That was Matthes' last visit to the Sierra Nevada. When Matthes returned home to Washington, D.C. in the fall of 1939, the war in Europe had commenced. The International Association for Scientific Hydrology drafted Matthes as their secretary and he also became the secretary of the International Commission of Snow and Glaciers, another division of the Association. For most of 1941, Matthes wrote a chapter for the Physics of the Earth books series from the National Research Council. His text was cited in the June 1949 edition of the Quarterly Journal by the Royal Meteorological Society as \\"a masterly summary of the characteristics and behavior of glaciers\\". In the article, Matthes stated that most of the glaciers in the western United States are not remnants from the Pleistocene Era, as had been previously held, but rather are \\"modern\\" and formed within the last 4000 years. He identified this phenomenon as the Little Ice Age. From 1942 through 1947, Matthes tasks were determined by the Military Geology Unit effort and his English translation skills for European languages. One of his final tasks for the USGS was a re-examination of William Herbert Hobbs's doctrine of a permanent glacial anticyclone situated over the Greenland ice sheet versus the use of Greenland as a military airbase. Retirement The statutory retirement age for employees of the Geological Survey is 70 years, but to meet the demands from World War II, Matthes continued an additional three years until his official retirement on . Fran√ßois and Edith remained in Washington, D.C. a few more months before traveling by automobile to their new home in El Cerrito, California, high on the Berkeley Hills facing the Golden Gate Bridge. There, Matthes began organizing his works until, in February 1948, he accepted the role of planner for the Committee on Snow and Glaciers sessions to be held as part of the International Scientific Congress scheduled to meet in Ohio in August. On , Matthes had a heart attack. He died and a candlelight service was conducted at his home four days later. On in Yosemite National Park, his ashes were committed to The Incomparable Valley. Recognition In 1920 he was decorated Chevalier (Knight), Order of Leopold II by King Albert of Belgium. During the autumn of 1919, Matthes had provided commentary for the King and his party during a tour of the Yosemite Valley. Matthes was active in the Boy Scouts of America. In 1915, he became the scoutmaster for a Washington, DC, troop. In 1920, he took a group of Eagle Scouts cross-country to tour Yosemite. In 1931 Matthes was presented the Silver Beaver Award for \\"distinguished service to boyhood\\". Surveying was an original Merit Badge in 1911 and Matthes wrote the mapping section of the Surveying Badge Pamphlet. In 1933 during the Sixteenth International Geological Congress, an excursion took attendees into the Grand Canyon. The geologists afterwards signed their names to a panoramic view of the canyon and sent it to Matthes with the message \\"We have been using your maps and have marveled at them. There are no other such topographic maps in all the world.\\" In 1947 during the commencement ceremony for University of California, Berkeley, he was presented an honorary LL.D. degree by University President Robert Gordon Sproul. On he received the first Distinguished Service Award (DSA) from the United States Department of the Interior which oversees the USGS. The citation reached Matthes a month before his death but his gold medal, with a bison standing before a range of mountain peaks, did not arrive in time. Julius Krug, United States Secretary of the Interior, wrote in the citation \\"Mr. Matthes made many valuable and exceptionally well-written contributions to glacial geology and geomorphology and became recognized internationally as an outstanding glacial geologist. A bibliography of his published works includes nearly 100 items.\\" In 1949 the Sierra Club, of which Matthes had served as honorary vice-president, named Matthes Crest and Matthes Lake in his honor. The Cryosphere Specialty Group of the Association of American Geographers (AAG) sponsors the Fran√ßois √âmile Matthes Award. This award was first presented in 2007 and given to meritorious individuals for their Lifetime Time Achievements in Cryospheric Science. Matthes was one of the founders of the AAG, served as its treasurer between 1913 and 1919, and as the president in 1933.

Slade, or , meant a bog or open space between woods and or banks, and isabel meant dirty or greyish brown, referring to the colour of the soil there. The Isabella Plantation was established in the early 19th century when Lord Sidmouth, who was Deputy Ranger of Richmond Park and a former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, fenced it as an area of woodland to keep the park's deer out. After World War II it was transformed into a woodland garden. It is now organically run, resulting in a rich flora and fauna.

He is best known for his sculptures depicting animals and famous athletes, made from recycled objects. Early life and education Larsen was born in Birmingham, Alabama, to Aurelio and Harry Larsen on August 29, 1959. His father was a professor of forestry and wildlife at Auburn University. As a child he would glue together small sculptures made of rocks for his mother. He studied industrial design at Auburn University for a year before moving to New Jersey to work as an airbrush artist painting surfboards. In 1983 he returned to Auburn University and graduated in 1987 with a degree in illustration. Fine art Larsen's work has been labeled Repo-Renaissance by the American Sport Art Museum and Archives. A derivative of the Found Object movement, Repo-Renaissance \\"combines the highly developed technical skills of classical artists in portraying the grace and power of natural bodies with contemporary social attitudes and ecological awareness.\\" Larsen's first solo exhibit was at the Mobile Museum of Art in December 2007. Titled \\"A Bruce Larsen Christmas\\", the exhibit was reviewed by the Press-Register as \\"Think of it as the view beneath Santa's snow beard. David Lynch meets Tim Burton, with a hint of Charles M. Schulz. Dark and edgy, yet playful.\\" A costume contest was held during the show's opening; a small original sculpture by Larsen the prize. In 2008 Larsen was chosen by the Alabama State Arts Council to be part of a cultural exchange between Alabama and Italy. Larsen and fellow Alabama artist Charlie Lucas traveled to the city of Pietrasanta for two weeks, where they created artwork from local materials they found for an exhibit housed in the church of Sant'Agostino. In 2009 Larsen was named the Sport Artist of the Year by the United States Sports Academy. The Academy is home to large sculptures by Larsen, depicting sports scenes and famous athletes including Mark Spitz, Nastia Liukin, and Valeriy Borzov. In recent years Larsen has worked with the non-profit organization Riverkeeper, creating their annual Big Fish award, given to individuals and companies committed to environmental protection. In 2011 he began working with the Hangout Music Festival, who use his artwork each year to decorate around the festival and backstage. Film Larsen is known for his work in film creating animatronic animals and creatures, primarily horses. He has also created numerous movie props, such as the knife in Rage, and the mirror in Oculus. Inspired by the film Alien, Larsen began creating his own monster costumes in college, winning a pound of gold at a Halloween costume contest for a costume made out of duct tape. After graduating from Auburn University he worked as an animator and prop fabricator for television commercials in Atlanta. Pursuing his original interest in building monsters he then worked on several small budget films, including Basket Case 3, creating special effects and small animatronics. In 2004 he spent 3 months in Kazakhstan building a mechanical horse for the historical epic Nomad, the Warrior. In 2013 he designed and created the monster for Mike Flanagan's Before I Wake.

During the American Civil War, Liverpool Landing's location at a bend in the Yazoo River made it an important defensive location for Confederate Army forces. Rugged, brush-covered hills rose abruptly on the eastern bank of the river, and one hill named \\"Rudloff Ridge\\" was selected for a defensive position. In June 1862, Confederate forces constructed a log chain raft across the Yazoo River at Liverpool Landing, in order to obstruct the movement of large Union Army ships. The New York Times described the raft as \\"a perfect lock against ascending boats\\". The Confederate vessels Arkansas, General Clark, General Earl Van Dorn, Livingston, Mobile, and Polk were sent to defend the raft.

An author of a number of books, he is perhaps best known as the originator of the historical revisionist thesis that the D√°l Riata (the Gaelic people who later founded Scotland) did not originate from Ireland.Campbell, Ewan. \\"Were the Scots Irish?\\" in Antiquity No. 75 (2001). pp. 285‚Äì292. He has also authored works about Dunadd and Forteviot. \\"Were the Scots Irish?\\" The traditional narrative of Scottish history, is that the kingdom of D√°l Riata was founded by Gaels from Ulster in Ireland, who crossed the Irish Sea after being squeezed by the ascent of Conn C√©tchathach's descendants (a kindred, but competing line). This position is upheld in medieval Gaelic texts such as the Duan Albanach, which attributes to the a descent from S√≠l Conairi of the √ârainn. This is held to be the means by which the Gaelic language came to northern Britain and where the clans who founded Scotland (i.e. - the MacAlpines) first entered the region. During the 2000s, advances in DNA studies confirmed the D√°l Riata Scots as belonging to Haplogroup R1b, with the marker L1335 associated specifically with them. Campbell authored a paper in 2001, named Were the Scots Irish?, in the Antiquity, which attempted to challenge the relationship between the Gaels of Ireland and those of D√°l Riata. He stated that there is no archeological or placename evidence of a migration or takeover. This lack of archeological evidence was previously noted by English archaeologist Leslie Alcock. Archeological evidence shows that Argyll was different from Ireland, before and after the traditionally held migration, but that it also formed part of the Irish Sea province with Ireland, being easily distinguished from the rest of Scotland.Campbell, Saints and Sea-kings, pp. 8‚Äì15; Foster, Picts, Gaels and Scots, pp. 9‚Äì10; Broun, \\"D√°l Riata\\"; Clancy, \\"Ireland\\"; Forsyth, \\"Origins\\", pp. 13‚Äì17. Campbell suggests that Argyll and Antrim formed a \\"maritime province\\", united by the sea and isolated from the rest of Scotland by the mountainous ridge called the Druim Alban. This allowed a shared language to be maintained through the centuries; Argyll remained Gaelic-speaking while the rest of Scotland became Brittonic-speaking. Campbell argues that the medieval accounts were a kind of dynastic propaganda, constructed to bolster a dynasty's claim to the throne and to bolster D√°l Riata claims to territory in Antrim. This view of the medieval accounts is shared by other historians. Works *Saints and Sea-Kings: The First Kingdom of the Scots (1999).

Originally launched for cargo and cattle, it was fitted with third-class accommodation for 675 passengers in 1899, launching its first passenger voyage on 28 February from Liverpool to Queenstown to Boston. Departing Boston on one of these voyages on 5 August 1899, the Ultonia hit a ledge just outside the main channel of Boston Harbor at Nantasket Roads, which was the typical route at the time. This area is now called the Ultonia Ledge, located a mile and a half southeast of Boston Light, and is as shallow as at mean lower low water according to modern nautical charts. This event spurred the alteration of ships' courses in the area to avoid the ledge, the dredging of Nantasket Roads to a depth of to be safe for large steamships, and also the later dredging of the wider northern approach via President Roads, which is the now the main channel for large ships entering or exiting Boston Harbor.

Whereas in the first field, her interests go towards medicinal chemistry, identification of novel targets and novel therapeutic concepts e. g. in the field of cancer and obesity, the second field is related to biomaterials, novel approaches to modify proteins and concepts for improved enzyme catalysis. Career Annette G. Beck-Sickinger studied chemistry (diploma in 1986) and biology (diploma in 1990) at the University of T√ºbingen (Germany) and received her Ph. D. under the supervision of G. Jung (Organic Chemistry, University of T√ºbingen). She was working as research fellow with R. A. Houghten (Scripps Clinic & Research Foundation, La Jolla, USA 1988) and T. W. Schwartz (Rigshospitalet Kopenhagen, Denmark 1992) and performed a post- doctorate with E. Carafoli (Laboratory of Biochemistry, ETH Z√ºrich, 1990-1991). She was appointed as assistant professor of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry at ETH Z√ºrich (1997-1999). Since October 1999, she is full professor of Biochemistry and Bioorganic Chemistry at the University of Leipzig. In 2009 she spent a sabbatical at Vanderbilt University (Nashville, TN) as visiting professor. Annette Beck-Sickinger was a member of the Board of the German Chemical Society (Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker, 2004-2012; Vice- President 2006-2008) and of the DFG panel ‚ÄûBiochemistry‚Äú (2004-2012). Since 2017 she is member of the Board of the German Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (gbm) and Vice-President. She was a member of the German Council of Science and Humanities (Wissenschaftsrat) from 2012-2018, and has been awarded with many prices including the Leonidas Zervas Award of the European Peptide Society, the gold medal of the Max-Bergmann-Kreis, the Leipzig Science Award (2016) and the Albrecht Kossel Price of the German Chemical Society (2018). She was honoured with the membership of the Saxonian Academy of Science in 2009 and in 2012, she became an elected member of the German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. In 2017, she was awarded with the Saxonian Order of Merit. She is a member of the German Chemical Society, the Saxonian Academy of Sciences and the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. She is known for her work on peptide signaling; she has coauthored reference works on combinatorial chemistry as applied to peptides and has participated in International Union of Pharmacology projects on standardization of nomenclature for G protein-coupled receptor peptide ligands. Controversy In March 2015, Beck-Sickinger was at the center of a controversy related to comments made during correspondence with an internship applicant in which she stated she would not accept any male students from India. The University declined to publish e-mails between Prof. Dr. Annette Beck-Sickinger and the student from India. However, the rector of the university, Prof. Dr. Beate Sch√ºcking as well as the students council of the university had the opportunity to review all relevant e-mails. Two independent statements have been published claiming that the mail published by the Indian student was faked as it only contained parts of the email conversation and that the student was declined for formal reasons. Germany's ambassador to India wrote a letter condemning Beck-Sickinger and, stating: ‚ÄúYour oversimplifying and discriminating generalisation is an offence to women and men ardently committed to furthering women's empowerment in India; and is an offence to millions of law-abiding, tolerant, open-minded and hard-working Indians.

There are three distinct varieties of this species, each with a different leaf size and shape, different distributions and somewhat different habitat preferences. Description Melaleuca tuberculata grows to a height of . Its leaves are arranged alternately, long, wide and are linear to narrow oval in shape. The flowers are arranged in heads up to in diameter, at or near the ends of the branches, with one to seven groups of flowers, each with three individual flowers. There are hairy brown bracts at the base of the flowers and the flower buds are covered with white, woolly hairs. The flowers appear from August to December, varying slightly with each variety, and are pale to mid- pink or mauve. The stamens are arranged in bundles of five around the flower, with six to ten stamens in each bundle, the bright yellow anthers contrasting with the mauve filaments. The cup-shaped base of the flower (the hypanthium) is hairy and long. The woody capsules are long and wide. The three varieties can be distinguished on the basis of the sizes of their leaves: *var. arenia - long, wide; *var. macrophylla - long, wide; *var. tuberculata - long, wide. Esperance Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca tuberculata was first formally described in 1844 by Johannes Conrad Schauer in Plantae Preissianae. The specific epithet (tuberculata) is derived from the Latin word meaning \\"full of lumps\\" \\"in reference to the prominent oil glands on the leaves\\". Distribution and habitat Melaleuca tuberculata occurs in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest and Mallee biogeographic regions. It grows in a variety of soils over ironstone or laterite, on undulating plains and high areas. The distribution of the varieties is as follows: *var. arenia - the Bendering‚ÄìKulin‚ÄìHyden‚ÄìPingaring district; *var. macrophylla - from the Kulin‚ÄìJerramungup district eastwards to the Grass Patch ‚Äì Israelite Bay district. *var. tuberculata - Brookton‚ÄìNarrogin district eastwards to the Esperance ‚Äì Israelite Bay district.

The regiment had been formed using dubious methods, with personnel recruited from various nationalities in Albania and the Ottoman Empire. The troops, who had arrived on Malta in 1806, were unhappy with their rank and pay. The mutiny lasted for eight days, during which several people were killed and the fort was damaged. The mutiny was put down, and the ringleaders were executed. It is considered the most serious mutiny of the Napoleonic Wars. Background The Froberg Regiment was founded in December 1803 by the French royalist Gustave de Montjoie, who claimed he was the German Count Froberg. He was given permission by the Secretary at War to raise a regiment for service on Malta, which he did in Albania and the Christian parts of the Ottoman Empire. It consisted of men with various nationalities, including Germans, Poles, Swiss, Albanians, Bulgarians, Greeks and Russians. Froberg's recruiting methods were problematic: according to Adam Neale in his Travels Through Some Parts of Germany, Poland, Moldavia and Turkey, \\"the most unprincipled deceit and falsehood were employed to obtain recruits\\". The regiment's 513 men arrived on Malta in 1806. The regiment was commanded by Major Schumelketel and Lieutenant Schwartz, the latter of whom had supervised the dubious recruiting process. Soon after their arrival, some of the men of the regiment began to complain: they had been promised high rank with good pay, but were forced to work as privates at lower wages. While the men were quarantined at the Lazzaretto on Manoel Island, they demanded to be sent back to Corfu. They withdrew their demands after Schwartz threatened to stop their food rations, which itself created more discontent. After the release from quarantine, the soldiers were allowed to go into the capital Valletta, where they quarrelled amongst themselves and with the locals. To prevent unrest, the Commander of the British Forces in Malta, William Villettes, confined them to Fort Ricasoli, a large fortification at the entrance of the Grand Harbour. In November 1806, Villettes appointed Lieutenant-Colonel James Barnes as the regiment's commander, but this only increased their resentment. Mutiny Land front of Fort Ricasoli The mutiny broke out on 4 April 1807, while Lieutenant-Colonel Barnes was in Valletta. It involved 200 Greeks and Albanians who killed Lieutenant Schwartz, Captain De Wattville, Gunner John Johnstone and a number of privates. They also wounded Major Schumelketel and three other officers. They removed the British flag and replaced it with the Russian ensign, closed the fort's gates and raised the drawbridge. The mutineers took the regimental officers and their families hostage, and forced about 20 British artillerymen to aim the fort's guns and mortars at Valletta. The revolt was led by a Greco-Bulgarian named Caro Mitro. Some men who had escaped from the fort informed the British of the mutiny. The Royal Maltese Regiment and the 39th (Dorsetshire) Regiment of Foot took positions on the glacis of the fort, while the guns of Fort Saint Elmo and Fort Saint Angelo were trained on Ricasoli. In a message, the mutineers demanded to be discharged and to be sent home, with money and a pardon from Villettes. They threatened to open fire on Valletta, but Villettes refused their demands and ordered them to surrender. On the second day, more guns were trained towards Ricasoli, but no further action was taken since Villettes intended to starve out the mutineers in a siege. A second message from the rebels demanded food and provisions, again threatening to bombard Valletta, but their demands were again ignored. On the third day, the mutineers sent one of the hostages, an officer, with a message from the mutineers, which was ignored once again. The officer told the British authorities of conditions in the fort, but had to return since they had kept his wife. Shortly afterwards the rebels began fighting among themselves, and a faction which was ready to surrender hoisted the white flag; another faction took it down. Seeing there was disagreement among the rebels Villettes sent a delegation to negotiate with them, but they still refused to surrender. On the fifth day, 8 April, the families of the officers held hostage were released since the mutineers were running out of food. The rebels sent an ultimatum threatening to destroy the fort unless provisions were sent. When it expired they sent another in which they threatened to kill all the remaining hostages. Meanwhile, there was more infighting between the rebels, and a group of Germans and Poles managed to open the gates of the fort. While most of the mutineers escaped and surrendered, some twenty others remained inside behind the re-closed gates. On 10 April, the remaining mutineers fired on Valletta, though they caused no injury. Villettes then ordered that the fort be stormed. A party of 40 men under Lieutenant de Clermont, who was himself part of the Froberg Regiment, scaled the fort and took control of it, taking no losses in the process. The fort fell but six rebels retreated into the gunpowder magazine, threatening to blow it up. After two days, they blew up the magazine's 600 barrels of gunpowder, and killed three British sentries. In the ensuing confusion the six rebels managed to escape to the countryside. Aftermath Floriana Parade Ground, where the rebel leaders were executed. Four of the six rebels who got away after blowing up the magazine were captured after two days, and were hanged immediately. Villettes put the ringleaders on trial: 24 or 25 were found guilty and condemned to death. The executions were carried out at the Floriana Parade Ground in the presence of the rest of the Froberg Regiment, which was now imprisoned. The first fifteen mutineers were divided into three groups of five: each group was hanged by the following group. The last group was not hanged, but instead executed by firing squad with the remaining prisoners. Some did not die immediately and tried to escape, and although most were recaptured and executed, two ran away and died after jumping off the bastions. Meanwhile, the mutineers' leader Caro Mitro together with his friend Nicola d'Anastasi had managed to escape, but they were captured on 25 or 26 April by Maltese soldiers near Baƒßar iƒã-ƒäagƒßaq. They were hanged on the same day and were buried in a trench beneath the Bastioni della Salnitriera. Qalet Marku, where the mutineers' leader Caro Mitro was captured on 25‚Äì26 April A board of inquiry was set up between 20 and 22 April, and their investigation uncovered the dubious recruiting of the regiment. They ordered it to be disbanded in June 1807. About 350 men were discharged and repatriated to the Balkans; others, who wanted to remain in British service, were reassigned to the Regiments of De Roll, Chasseurs Britanniques, and De Watteville. The government also published an eight-page report about the mutiny, entitled Rapporto di quanto √® accaduto nel Forte Ricasoli dalli 4 fino alli 11 d'Aprile 1807 (Report of what happened at Fort Ricasoli from 4 to 11 April 1807), which was probably written by Vittorio Barzoni. Count Froberg (Gustave de Montjoie), the regiment's founder, was in Constantinople when he heard about the mutiny. He fled the city, knowing that his recruitment methods had been uncovered, but, according to Neale, a group of Cossacks captured him in a remote village and \\"literally cut [him] to pieces\\". The fort itself was badly damaged; besides the magazine, most of St. Dominic Demi-Bastion had been destroyed. The damaged demi-bastion was never rebuilt to its original design, but repair works to the damaged parts of the fort cost over ¬£4523. The fort was again badly damaged in World War II, and today it is in a dilapidated state and threatened by coastal erosion.

A single action turns on the lights and they remain on for long enough to ascend or descend the stairs. The lights then turn themselves off automatically.  Operation  In a single occupancy domestic dwelling it is usual to provide multiple switching locations. The lights may be turned on or off from either the top, bottom or intermediate floors of the staircase. They remain on until turned off manually. In a multiple occupancy dwelling, the drawback is that the cost of shared lighting is usually paid by the landlord. Individual tenants turn lights on, but have little reason to turn them off. Particularly so in the days of incandescent lamps this could be an appreciable cost. For this reason shared dwellings favour timers for staircases instead. The lights are turned on by a push-button switch on any floor. They remain on automatically for an adequate time to climb the stairs, then turn themselves off. To provide longer lighting times when required the button may be pressed repeatedly. For this reason any timer should be a retriggerable monostable, i.e. the off delay lasts from the time of the last button press. There may also be a switch, sometimes a key switch, that can turn the lights on indefinitely for tasks such as cleaning.  Pneumatic timers  The first staircase timers were pneumatic pushbuttons. A large push-button, distinctly larger than a normal electrical switch, is pressed manually. An internal mechanism provides the delay. The internal piston is depressed by the button and holds the electrical contacts closed. This piston is spring-loaded to return upwards but is prevented from returning quickly by a pneumatic dashpot. This dashpot provides the timing function.  Electronic timers  DIN rail mounted electronic lighting timer An electronic timer allow simple push- buttons to be used. One timer is installed controlling the lights and any number of push-buttons, without pneumatic timers and connected in parallel, are used to trigger it. With many push-buttons, the cost savings for equipment may be substantial.  Occupancy detectors  Combined PIR sensor and lightswitch PIR sensors may be used to control lighting in such areas. They avoid the need to press a push-button but otherwise operate as for electronic timers. As PIR sensors are not perfectly reliable a timer is needed to avoid the lights flashing off and on as the occupier moves out of detector range. The timer interval is short though compared to a push-button timer; it times the interval between sightings of the occupier, not the time of occupancy. Such sensors are also used for restrooms. Owing to the variability of occupancy time in a restroom, a simple fixed timer was unworkable. This ability to cope with variably occupancy times is also useful when stairwells, lift lobbies and corridors must grant disabled access as they no longer discriminate in favour of an assumed transit time for an able-bodied person.

Guttenbeil-Likiliki has urged equality in women's economic and educational empowerment, in their political involvement and representation, in land reform, protection from violence, and has advocated for the ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women for over a decade. On 9 March 2015, her advocacy came to fruition when the Tongan government agreed that it was prepared to ratify the convention. Guttenbeil-Likiliki was twice nominated for the U.S. Secretary of State International Women of Courage Award (2012,2013) recognising her work in advocating for women and childrens rights in Tonga. Early life Ofa-Ki- Levuka Louise Guttenbeil was born in New Zealand, to Tongan born parents who migrated to New Zealand during the early 1970s to work in the industrial boom that called for low skilled migrant workers. Guttenbeil-Likiliki has 3 older siblings who were all born in Tonga however raised mostly in New Zealand. She returned to the island in 2000. She obtained a B.A. and an M.A. in Film, TV and Media Communications (Hons) from the University of Auckland. She earned a post graduate diploma in International Broadcast Journalism from the Thomson Foundation in collaboration with the University of Cardiff, Wales. Her Bachelor of Laws was completed at the University of the South Pacific and Likiliki is currently pursuing a Master of Laws with an emphasis on legal reform in relation to Temporary Special Measures or increasing women's representation in parliament. She has worked as a DJ for Kool 90FM - Radio Tonga 2, also as Senior Presenter, Senior Producer and Marketing manager for Radio & TV Tonga, and was the host of Juice Music produced by Television Tonga. She also was a co-host with Arnold Manu of Tonga's indigenous music video program, Talamahe'a. Activism Beginning around 2005, Guttenbeil- Likiliki founded and worked as coordinator of the Women‚Äôs Action Group for Change, urging the government to allow women to participate in government consultations regarding education, poverty reduction and economic development. In 2008, she was advocating for alternative energy solutions as a method of reducing cost to women and children for basic utilities. In 2009 Guttenbeil- Likiliki and 16 of the 17 staff members employed at the Tonga National Centre for Women and Children (TNCWC) walked off of their jobs and created the Women and Children Crisis Centre. The move was predicated by a desire to retain the autonomy of an NGO without governmental oversight. The founding group of men and women, with Guttenbeil-Likiliki as the director, created an organization to educate and advocate for the elimination of domestic violence and provide support for victims. The organization operates a 24-hour temporary safe house, assists victims with counseling, support, and advocacy. She has spoken out about the levels of violence in the region, noting a 2009 report indicated 79% of Tongan women had been the victims of physical or sexual violence and 2012 Ma'a Fafine Mo e Famili (MFF) study showed 75% of Tongan women have experienced violence from males. After two years of pressing for legal protections in 2013, the Tongan parliament passed a Family Protection Bill which required victims to be informed of their rights and legal procedures, allowed police to issue immediate emergency protection orders, and established a monitoring committee. In 2012, Guttenbeil-Likiliki strongly supported land reform proposals for the progress of equality in Tongan society. Recalling that in its history, Tonga has had only 4 women elected to govern since the 1950s political representation and participation in governance are critical areas where change is needed to Guttenbeil-Likiliki. In 2014, Tonga appointed the first ever justices of the peace. Guttenbeil-Likiliki was one of the initial 19 people selected as justice of the peace and she represents her home district of Tongatapu. She has been an advocate for the ratification of CEDAW for the past 11 years and on 9 March 2015, that dream became a reality when the Tongan government agreed to ratify the Convention. Though the signing was to be with reservations, Guttenbeil-Likiliki saw the move as a positive one which will signify that the government is amenable to making changes. After over a month of delays in the ratification, Guttenbeil-Likiliki, expressed that the ratification was being used for political ends, with claims being made that ratification would lead to gay marriage and legalized abortion, neither of which are part of the Convention. For their work in promoting women's rights in Tonga the Women and Children Crisis Centre was awarded the South Pacific Commission (SPC) Human Rights Award in 2010. Personal information 'Ofa Guttenbeil married Nasili Likiliki in 2002 and has four children. She and her husband are the owners and operators of Coconut Productions, which has produced videos for the Women and Development Centre to explain official government policy in a family-friendly format. In 2014 her film Dear Tita won the Best Project from the Masterclass Pan-Pacific Media Project.

John Fund, Inc., 573 U.S. ___ (2014), is a United States Supreme Court case regarding class action certification for a securities fraud claim. Under the fraud-on-the-market theory, the Court had to inquire as to if markets are economically efficient. The Court presumed they are.  Background  Halliburton CEO Dick Cheney arranged a merger with competitor Dresser Industries, which had been directed for decades by Prescott Bush.https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2004-10-03/dresser-the-halliburton- cast-off-that-could Halliburton publicly promoted the merger as a \\"win-win\\", and plaintiffs, including the Archbishop of Milwaukee, bought equity in Halliburton off the stock market.Archdiocese of Milwaukee Supporting Fund, Inc. v.

SEC Rule 10b-5 securities fraud requires a private plaintiff to prove that her economic loss was caused by reliance on the defendant's material misrepresentation.The Supreme Court, 2013 Term ‚Äî Leading Cases, 128 Harv. L. Rev. 291 (2014). Certification for a class action requires class members to have common questions of law or fact that predominate the controversy. Common reliance on public information is presumed if plaintiffs bought off a well developed market under the fraud on the market theory developed in Basic Inc. v. Levinson. Halliburton argued that before the class could be certified the plaintiffs also needed to prove their loss was caused by Halliburton's falsehoods. The District Court agreed and denied class certification, meaning that the plaintiffs would each individually have to bring their claims. The denial was affirmed by the Fifth Circuit.Archdiocese of Milwaukee Supporting Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co., 597 F.3d 330 (5th Cir. 2010) [2010 BL 36008] In his first argument before the Court since Bush v. Gore, David Boies represented plaintiffs. In Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co. the Supreme Court vacated and remanded. Finding the fraud on the market presumption only addresses members‚Äô common reliance, the Court held that plaintiffs did not need to prove loss causation when seeking class certification.Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co., 131 S. Ct. 2179, 563 U.S., 180 L. Ed. 2d 24 (2011).(Halliburton I) On remand Halliburton argued that because its falsehoods had no effect on its stock price plaintiffs could not have commonly relied on the falsehoods. The district court found that argument could only be made later during trial, granted class certification, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed.718 F.3d 423 (2013) Halliburton petitioned the Supreme Court for another writ of certiorari, this time arguing that the fraud on the market precedent should be overruled, and the petition was granted.  Opinion of the Court  Chief Justice Roberts, joined by five other justices, finds no special reason to overrule Supreme Court precedent. Addressing Halliburton's contention that the Basic presumption is a ‚Äújudicial construct‚Äù that differs from fraud in securities filings, Roberts notes that because this point was made by the dissenters in Basic, it has already been rejected. Furthermore, Roberts notes that stare decisis has special force because Congress is free to change the Basic presumption, and subsequently has chosen not to do so despite two major securities fraud reforms. Roberts then turns to market capitalism‚Äôs fundamental economic theory. The efficient market hypothesis holds that the ideal market price fully reflects all available information. The Court in Basic Inc. v. Levinson (1988) had relied on the hypothesis to presume that any false information about a stock would be reflected in the stock‚Äôs market price and, therefore, be relied upon by investors that bought the stock off the market. A contentious core tenet of the Chicago school of economics the hypothesis has proven difficult to disprove and, in 2013 the Nobel Prize in Economics was jointly awarded to Eugene Fama, the hypothesis‚Äôs creator, and Bob Shiller, the hypothesis‚Äôs primary critic.https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic- sciences/laureates/2013/popular-economicsciences2013.pdf Halliburton argued that its misrepresentations did not impact its stock price because the efficient market hypothesis is empirically false and capital markets are not fundamentally efficient. Roberts rejects this contention, finding that information does, in fact, effect stock price.Halliburton II, 134 S. Ct. 2398 at 2410 citing Shiller, We‚Äôll Share the Honors, and Agree to Disagree, N.Y. Times, Oct. 27, 2013, p. BU6 (‚ÄúOf course, prices reflect available information‚Äù). While Halliburton may not have traded in an ideal frictionless market, Roberts finds that ‚Äúin making the presumption rebuttable, Basic recognized that market efficiency is a matter of degree and accordingly made it a matter of proof.‚Äù Halliburton also argued that presuming reliance on market price is wrong because investors are actually indifferent to price. Value investing was offered as an example of traders who invest believing that the true value of a company is different from its market price. Roberts rejects this, finding, no, value investors are not indifferent to price and, in fact, their investment strategy presupposes the market price will eventually move towards a more accurate valuation. Other than overruling Basic, Halliburton had alternatively asked that instead of asking plaintiffs to prove the stock traded in a well developed market, plaintiffs should be required to directly prove price impacts from the falsehoods. Roberts notes that the Basic presumption is actually a presumption of price impact and a presumption of reliance, and that the same reasons justify both presumptions. Instead of burdening plaintiffs, Roberts decides that defendants should be able to rebut the reliance presumption with evidence of a lack of price impact before class certification. Noting that the same evidence may already be proffered to show market efficiency and the publicity of misrepresentations, Roberts sees nothing gained and much lost by forbidding direct price impact evidence. The case was then vacated and remanded to give Halliburton the opportunity to prove the absence of price impact.  Concurrence and Concurrence in Judgment  Concurring Justice Ginsburg, joined by Justice Breyer and Justice Sotomayor, note that moving the price impact inquiry to the class certification stage may broaden the scope of discovery. Concurred in judgment only, Justice Thomas was joined by Justice Scalia and Justice Alito. Deriding ‚ÄúBasic‚Äôs muddled logic and armchair economics‚Äù Thomas believes he may overrule such precedent when it is ‚Äúbadly reasoned‚Äù. The conservative justices then reject the efficient market hypothesis. They find that ‚Äò‚Äúoverwhelming empirical evidence‚Äù now suggests that even when markets do incorporate information, they often fail to do so accurately‚Äù.134 S. Ct. at 2421 quoting Lev and de Villiers, Stock Price Crashes and 10b-5 Damages: A Legal, Economic and Policy Analysis, 47 Stan. L.Rev. 7, 20-21 (1994). Deriding ‚Äúthe Court‚Äôs rather superficial analysis‚Äù, Thomas concludes that investment decisions are ‚Äúmade with indifference to price and thus without regard for price ‚Äúintegrity‚Äù‚Äù. Because false statements do not effect market prices and investors are indifferent to the price they pay anyway, Thomas sees the Basic presumption as doing no good and much harm. Noting that on merits only six defendants have successfully rebutted individual plaintiffs‚Äô reliance on price integrity, Thomas fears that the Basic presumption in practice is ‚Äúlargely irrebuttable‚Äù.134 S. Ct. at 2424 citing Grundfest, Damages and Reliance under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 69 Bus. Lawyer 307, 360 (2014) What's worse for Thomas, the huge damages resulting from securities fraud creates ‚Äúsubstantial in terrorem settlement pressures‚Äù for large publicly traded companies to pay deceived shareholders.134 S. Ct. at 2424 fn.7 citing Nagareda, Class Certification in the Age of Aggregate Proof, 84 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 97. 99 (2009). Concluding that reliance in security fraud is ‚Äúinherently individualized‚Äù, Thomas would overrule Basic and require every deceived shareholder to sue separately.

He was shot and killed and political motives were suspected. The RENAMO party organised protests.  Biography  Gilles Cistac was born in 1961 in the French city of Toulouse. He studied public law in Toulouse and graduated there in 1998.  Move to Mozambique  In 1993 Cistac came as an advisor to Mozambique working for the French embassy providing assistance to the Mozambican state in creating a new electoral law. After a short stay back in France, he moved to Mozambique in 1995. Since then he worked as a law professor at Eduardo Mondlane University. Until his death, he was the vice-chair of the investigation department of the law faculty of the university. It was his efforts that led to the creation of the Centro de Estudos sobre a Integra√ß√£o Regional (CEDIR), a small investigation unit working on the harmonisation of the law in the SADC member states. In 2009, Cistac received the French order of merit Ordre des Palmes Acad√©miques in the rank of a knight (Chevalier) for his work on decentralisation in Mozambique. The \\"Ordre des Palmes Acad√©miques\\" is the highest French order of merit in the science area. In 2010 Cistac acquired the Mozambican citizenship additionally to his French citizenship. March honouring Gilles Cistac in Maputo on March 7, 2015. In front, Ivone Soares, leader of the RENAMO parliamentary group in the National Parliament.  Death  In the morning of the March 3, 2015 Gilles Cistac wanted to enter a taxi in front of a caf√© in the Polana neighbourhood, when a car passed by and hit Cistac intentionally by three shots. A few hours later, Cistac died in Maputo's central hospital. The main opposition party, RENAMO, as well as certain oppositional and international media houses blamed radical forces of the ruling FRELIMO party for Cistac's death, while the FRELIMO denied having any relation to this. A few days later, several marches in several Mozambican cities honoured Cistac. Embassies of different states, as of France, the European Union and the United States, condemned the homicide and demanded a fast and effective investigation of it. Cistac's homicide was seen as a further step in increasing Mozambique's political crisis since 2013.  Public activities  Gilles Cistac was known as a sharp critic of the ruling FRELIMO party, he published his opinion in several oppositional media, despite the fact that he claimed to be independent and not affiliated to any political party. He criticised the constant violation of human rights in Mozambique, the appropriation of the state bureaucracy by the FRELIMO, the concentration of the state's executive power and the weak public prosecution. After the general elections in 2014 the main opposition party, RENAMO, protested heavily against the results. Especially, the RENAMO claimed to govern the provinces, in which the party won the majority of votes. At the moment, the central government nominates the governors of the provinces. RENAMO leader Afonso Dhlakama demanded the creation of so-called \\"Autonomous Provinces\\" and a subsequent constitutional devolution. The FRELIMO party, especially Mozambique's president Filipe Nyusi, denied these requests and called them \\"unconstitutional\\". Gilles Cistac contradicted Nyusi and said that, according to Mozambique's constitution, it was possible to create subaltern hierarchies. Cistac prepared a legislative proposal for the RENAMO, which is going to be discussed in the national Parliament. After publishing his opinion about the possibility of creating \\"Autonomous Provinces\\" several media close to the FRELIMO party criticised him for his opinions. The spokesperson of the FRELIMO, Dami√£o Jos√©, called Cistac a \\"liar\\" and being \\"dishonest\\", as well as blaming him not being thankful to the Mozambican people who accepted him \\"friendly\\".

Career In 1984 Lashlie became a probation officer in the Hutt Valley, and in 1985 she was appointed as a prison officer at Rimutaka Prison, becoming the first woman in that role in a New Zealand men's prison. She was later the manager of Christchurch Women's Prison for almost four years until September 1999. Lashlie was appointed as a transition manager for the Nelson Specialist Education Service (SES) in 2000, but in April 2001 she was controversially removed from that position following a speech in which she spoke about a hypothetical five-year-old boy who was \\"blond, with the most angelic face you can imagine and he is coming to prison ... and he is probably going to kill someone on his way.\\" Her sacking led to the Minister of Education, Trevor Mallard, ordering an inquiry into the matter by the State Services Commission. As a result of the commission's report, the chairman of SES, Graham Lovelock, lost his job. During the controversy, Lashlie was approached by Nelson College headmaster Salvi Gargiulo to advise the school on discipline in its boarding houses. The work with Nelson College led to the \\"Good Man\\" project, where Lashlie worked with teenagers in 25 boys' schools in New Zealand, and advised parents on how to raise boys through her book He'll be OK. She spoke widely on the subject in New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and the United States. Reputation and legacy Lashlie was the subject of a 2018 Amanda Millar documentary Celia. The documentary followed that last year of Lashlie life, using archive footage and interviews with colleagues. The Celia Lashlie Trust was launched in October 2018. The Trust's purpose is to work on issues to affect social change, with a particular focus on working with women and at- risk families.  Personal life  Born in Taihape in 1953, Lashlie married at age 19 and had two children. Following the end of her marriage, she became a solo mother and completed a Bachelor of Arts in anthropology and MƒÅori. Lashlie was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in late 2014, and she died in Wellington on 16 February 2015.

An Introduction to New Zealand Painting 1839-1980 Collins, 1982 Style and subject Her paintings were generally of landscapes, botany, and flowers. She always painted in situ and never painted from notes. Sometimes, she would have several paintings on the go from the same location, each with different weather. Lovell-Smith's painting style is characterised by bold design, broad flat areas of colour, and an almost poster-like style. She emphasised basic patterns and shapes, sometimes exaggerating the intensity of colours. At the time, some critics responded to it by saying it went \\"counter to good tradition\\" or that it smacked of commercial art., while others defended her saying: Lovell-Smith can be understood as part of a movement of New Zealand artists in the 1930s, including Olivia Spencer-Bower, Rita Angus, and Alfred Cook, whom art writers A.R.D Fairburn, James Shelley and '\\"Conrad\\" recognised as providing a \\"new manner\\" of painting better representing New Zealand and its light. This included the removal of romantic or golden mist and soft warm colour, and a move towards clear hard light, and displaying sheer, sharp, more linear forms.Pound, Francis.

She received the title of Hero of the Soviet Union on 15 May 1946 for completing 914 night bombing missions against Axis forces.  Early life  Aronova was born in 1920 to a Russian peasant family; her father, who was a railway employee, abandoned the family in 1936. Her mother worked as a washerwoman and was poorly educated, but Aronova went on to complete secondary school in 1938, and became a recipient of the Voroshilov Sharpshooter badge. She then applied to the air force, but was rejected. She was eventually accepted into the Saratov Institute of Agriculture and studied at the local OSOAVIAKhIM aeroclub in her spare time before moving to Moscow, after which she continued flight training at the Moscow aeroclub until the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. She became a member of the Communist Party in 1942.  World War II  Several months after Germany invaded the Soviet union with the launch of Operation Barbarossa, Marina Raskova was granted permission to form three women's aviation regiments. After joining the military in October 1941 she began navigation training at Engels Military Aviation School, and in May 1942 she was deployed to the Souther front with the 588th Night Bomber Regiment. Throughout the war she saw combat throughout the Eastern front including on the Ukrainian and Byelorussian Fronts as well as the Battle of the Caucuses, Crimea, Kuban, Kerch, Poland, and Germany, gaining 1,148 flight hours at night and flying 914 combat sorties. During a bombing mission on 28 March 1943 over the village of Kievskaya in Krasnodar she was wounded by a shell fragment fired by ground-based anti-aircraft artillery. Despite her injury she continued navigating so the plane could safely. When she went to the hospital seventeen shrapnel fragments were removed from her body, but she returned to flying in May less than two months later. That same year she attended an accelerated piloting course and became certified to fly as a pilot on the Po-2 and soon began flying missions as a pilot. Her bombing missions destroyed an estimated four artillery batteries, three searchlights, three ferries, two warehouses of fuel and ammunition, and eight cars.  Later life  From May to October 1945 Aronova remained in Poland where her regiment was assigned until it was disbanded in October 1945, but Aronova remained in the military until 1962. After graduating from the Military Institute of Foreign Languages in 1952 she held various positions in the Communist party and the Soviet government, becoming a senior officer in the Ministry of Internal Affairs in May 1953. She later worked for the KGB starting in 1954 where she encrypted agency correspondence, attaining the rank of Major in 1960 before retiring in 1961. After retiring from the military she wrote a book about her experiences in the war titled –ù–æ—á–Ω—ã–µ –≤–µ–¥—å–º—ã (\\"Night Witches\\") which was published in 1969.

After trying unsuccessfully at Ophir and Abercrombie, he returned to Sydney to be apprenticed to a cabinet maker. After another abortive attempt on the goldfields, he worked as a salesman. In 1860 he married Jane Marshall in Sydney; they would have seven children. In 1861 Barnes went to the goldfields at Lambing Flat to support the family store at Cootamundra; Barnes and his younger brother took over the business in 1875. He was also the local hotelier and postmaster, and was Cootamundra's first mayor in 1884. In 1887 he retired from business and turned his attention to politics, winning election to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1889 as the Protectionist member for Gundagai. He served in that capacity until the reduction in the Assembly's size in 1904, when he was defeated running for Cootamundra. Barnes then retired from public life and moved to Sydney, dying at Hurstville in 1915.

Phillips (July 9, 1923 ‚Äì March 15, 2019) was an American meteorologist notable for his contributions to geophysical fluid dynamics. In 1956, he developed a mathematical model that could realistically depict monthly and seasonal patterns in the troposphere, which became the first successful general circulation model of climate. Phillips was born in Chicago, Illinois. His parents, Alton Elmer Anton Phillips and Linnea (Larson) Phillips, were the children of Swedish immigrants to the United States. He enrolled at the University of Chicago in 1940, intending to study chemistry, but the start of World War II and the influence of Carl-Gustaf Rossby inspired him to join the Army Air Corps in 1943. After graduating from the meteorological cadet program at Chanute Field as fourth in a class of 391, he served in the Azores and then at Westover Field until October 1946. He returned to the University of Chicago after the war, earning his bachelor's degree in 1947, his master's in 1948, and his PhD in 1951. Shortly before completing his PhD, Phillips accepted a position on the research staff of the Electronic Computer Project at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. In 1956, he was recruited by the Department of Meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, eventually becoming department head. In 1974, Phillips left MIT to join the National Weather Service at the National Meteorological Center, where he served as the principal scientist of the NMC Development Division. When he retired, the Nested Grid Model was popularly known as \\"Norm's Great Model.\\" Phillips died at Grace House in Windham, New Hampshire on March 15, 2019. He published his last academic paper, on the Foucault pendulum, at the age of 90.  Awards  In 1956, his seminal paper, \\"The general circulation of the atmosphere: a numerical experiment,\\" was recognized with the first Napier Shaw Memorial Prize from the Royal Meteorological Society. Phillips was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1976. He and his colleague Joseph Smagorinsky were awarded a Benjamin Franklin Medal (Franklin Institute) in 2003. Phillips was also an honorary member of the American Meteorological Society, and a recipient of their highest honor, the Carl-Gustaf Rossby Research Medal. Works * Phillips, Norman A.

Verse 16 : Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. NKJV * \\"The word of Christ\\": may mean \\"the word spoken by Christ\\" (\\"Christ's message\\" in GNB), or \\"the message about Christ\\" (CEV, \\"about the Messiah\\" in HCSB). Some Greek manuscripts read \\"God\\" (, for examples, Codex Alexandrinus, Ephraemi Rescriptus, 33), or \\"Lord\\" (; only Codex Sinaiticus* and Freerianus), but all others have \\"Christ\\" ().

A model on the \\"mutual responsibilities of slaves and masters within the Christian fellowship\\" can be viewed in the Epistle to Philemon, where the slaves and masters are brothers in Christ. Slaves (or employees in modern days) to non-Christian masters should work more faithfully, because they are above all the servants of Christ, committed to please him, not the masters, or not fear the earthly masters but in reverence for Christ as the heavenly master (verse 23), and therefore linking the quality of their service to the reputation of Christ or Christianity.

It was commissioned that year by Thomas Cromwell, agent for Henry VIII, as a betrothal painting following the death of the English Queen Jane Seymour. It shows the then sixteen-year-old Christina of Denmark, widowed Duchess of Milan. She was not a great beauty, but had a striking manner and strength of character. Although Henry was taken by her representations, the marriage proposal did not go ahead; not least because she was aware of Henry's earlier treatment of his wives, and said \\"If I had two heads, I would happily put one at the disposal of the King of England\\". Art historian Derek Wilson wrote that the portrait \\"is the loveliest paintings of a woman [Holbein] ever painted, that is, it is one of the finest female portraits ever painted.Wilson (2006), 250 It was acquired in 1909 by the National Gallery, London, where it is on permanent display.\\" Key facts: Christina of Denmark, Duchess of Milan\\".

Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum Following the 1537 death of the English Queen Jane Seymour, Holbein was commissioned to paint portraits of noblewomen eligible to marry Henry VIII. Christina was Duchess of Milan, and widowed to Francesco II Sforza, who had died in 1535 when she was just thirteen. Thomas Cromwell sent Holbein and the ambassador Philip Hoby to Brussels to meet with her. He was tasked with providing a straightforward, exact portrait of the girl.B√§tschmann (1999), 192 They arrived in Denmark on 10 March 1538, where on the 12th Christina sat for the portrait for three hours between 1:00 and 4:00 pm.\\" Christina of Denmark, Duchess of Milan\\". National Gallery, London. Retrieved 14 March 2015 Holbein would have been able to converse with her in his native German. That afternoon he made preparatory sketches of her head; the final oil painting was completed at some point shortly after his return to England. Henry was so taken with the initial colour drawings for the portrait ‚Äîwhich showed only her head‚Äî that, according to the imperial ambassador Eustace Chapuys, \\"since he saw it he has been in much better humour than he ever was, making musicians play on their instruments all day long\\". Various political and practical obstacles related to her close ties with the Lutheran church thwarted the match. On the basis of the drawing, he commissioned that Holbein extend it to a full length oil panel. Christina herself was against marriage arrangement; she was only sixteen years old and made no secret of her distaste for Henry, who by this time had a reputation around Europe for his mistreatment of wives. She is credited with saying; \\"If I had two heads, I would happily put one at the disposal of the King of England\\".Wilson (2006), 251 Description Christina stands in full length in a frontal pose. She is set against a turquoise background, reminiscent of 15th century Burgundian art. She is dressed in black mourning clothes even years after the death of her husband, as was the custom for women involved in a noble Italian marriage. Her black gown is lined with brown fur. She throws a shadow against the wall behind her, a further strip of shadow appears on the right hand side, thrown by an unseen source. Her expression is lively and engaged. She is given bright red lips, whose colour is echoed by the red ring on her fingers. Her youth is conveyed through her half smile, oval face, shy expression and dimples. Although the portrait is filled with indicators of her nobility, she has taken off her gloves, allowing an informal, intimate atmosphere. She is given almost perfect white skin, the tones of which are offset against the black overcoat.  Notes  Sources * B√§tschmann, Oskar. Hans Holbein.

Following the Civil War, during the Reconstruction era, the city was founded by John C. Williams, formerly of Detroit, who purchased the land in 1876, and by Peter Demens, who was instrumental in bringing the terminus of the Orange Belt Railway there in 1888. St. Petersburg was incorporated on February 29, 1892, when it had a population of only some 300 people. It was named after Saint Petersburg, Russia, where Peter Demens had spent half of his youth. A local legend says that John C. Williams and Peter Demens flipped a coin to see who would have the honor of naming the city.A founding grandfather lives in lore. Monica Davey. St. Petersburg Times (Florida). Largo-Seminole Times; Pg. 6. May 23, 1994. Peter Demens won and named the city after his home, while John C.

A. Davis turned on St. Petersburg's first electrical service in 1897 and its first trolley service in 1904. The city's first major industry was born in 1899 when Henry W. Hibbs (1862‚Äì1942), a native of Newport, North Carolina, established his wholesale fish business at the end of the railroad pier, which extended out to the shipping channel. Within a year, Hibbs Fish Company was shipping more than of fish each day. Dredging of a deeper shipping channel from 1906 to 1908 opened St. Petersburg to larger shipping. Further dredging improved the port facilities through the 1910s. By then the city's population had quadrupled to 4,127. In 1914, airplane service across Tampa Bay from St. Petersburg to Tampa and back was initiated, generally considered the first scheduled commercial airline flight. The company name was the St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line, and the pilot was Tony Jannus, flying a Benoist XIV flying boat. The Tony Jannus Award is presented annually for outstanding achievement in the airline industry. Jannus Live, a local music/entertainment venue on Central Avenue in downtown, is also named after him. The city population continued to multiply during the 20th century, booming in the 1940s and 1950s and through the 1970s as the town became a popular retirement destination for Americans from midwestern cities, reaching 238,647 in the 1980 census. By that time, however, the population had leveled off, and has grown by only 10,000 since then. In the decade from 2000 to 2010, the population of the city dropped by approximately 4000 residents, while in the same period the population of Florida increased by over two and a half million residents. In 2014, the New York Times proclaimed that St. Petersburg is \\"one of the top places to go\\" in the world.

He attended Cornell University and earned his master's degree in 1948. In 1951, he obtained his Ph.D. in agricultural economics from the University of Minnesota. Berg enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1943, served in the Battle of the Bulge, and was involved in the funeral service for General George Patton. In 1944 he attended the Bretton Woods Conference as a prominent graduate student from Cornell. From June 1945 to August 1946 he was Food and Agricultural Officer at Supreme Headquarters, Allied Powers, Europe. Upon his return to South Dakota State, he became a member of the 44 Kings‚Äîan organization of World War II veterans. From 1957 to 1963, he served as professor and head of the Department of Agricultural Economics at the University of Minnesota. In 1963 he was appointed dean of the Institute of Agriculture at the U. of M. In 1975, Dr. Berg became president of South Dakota State University, where he served until 1984. The first graduate of State to be named president, Berg came to South Dakota State University after serving as the Director of the Indonesia Project of the Midwest University Consortium for International Affairs from 1973 to 1975. He had also served many years as the U.S. Agricultural Attach√© in various countries around the world, in addition to his time spent as an educator at the University of Minnesota. Berg was president during a very difficult time. He was constantly beset by major budget cuts, but managed to create lasting programs. One area that marked a great change in the university's history was the internationalizing of the campus. Programs were set up in Syria, Botswana, Senegal, and Mauritania, and the number of international students on campus grew. Berg was also an early proponent of the reciprocity program with Minnesota and strengthened ties with Sinte Gleska University on the Rosebud Reservation in southwestern South Dakota. In addition, he oversaw the groundwork for the first endowed chair for the university, the Ethel Austin Martin-Edward Moss Martin Chair in Human Nutrition, created scholarships for students from varied backgrounds, and contributed to endowments for arts and science facilities. .

AD 200) *Codex Vaticanus (325-350) *Codex Sinaiticus (330-360) *Codex Alexandrinus (400-440) *Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (c. 450; complete) *Codex Freerianus (c. 450; extant verses 1-2, 11-13) *Codex Claromontanus (c. 550) Exhortations for masters Verse 1 : Masters, give your bondservants what is just and fair, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven. NKJV Concluding Exhortations (4:2‚Äì6) Verse 6 : Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one. NKJV * \\"Let your speech be always with grace\\": that is, \\"in grace, or concerning grace\\"; let 'grace', such as 'the work of grace on souls', 'the wonders of grace' and 'the glory of the grace of God', be the subject of conversation among believers. Moreover, the speech should be in a 'graceful way', that is, \\"always\\" with a cheerful face and in a courteous manner. * \\"Seasoned with salt\\": The Syriac version reads, \\"as if it was seasoned with salt\\". 'Grace' to 'speech' is as 'salt' to 'meat'; therefore \\"grace, prudence, and holiness\\", as 'salt' (), make conversation about the grace and doctrines of God more acceptable to a spiritual man; and as salt preserves flesh from being bad, so grace along with speech makes it pure and good, which corresponds to Paul's view that nothing corrupt should proceed out of the mouths of believers (). * \\"How you ought to answer\\": The Syriac and Arabic versions render it, \\"and know ye how\\" and make it to be a fresh exhortation to the believers to share the spiritual knowledge, that they may be able to respond properly and pertinently, with meekness and fear, for those asking a reason of the hope that is in them.John Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible, - Colossians 4:6 Final Greetings (4:7‚Äì18) Ruins of Laodicea, 2015. Ruins of Hierapolis, 2006. In the beginning of the final greetings, Paul introduces the bearers of this epistle ‚Äì Tychicus and Onesimus ‚Äì in a 'chiastic pattern' (verses 7‚Äì9). Six men who were with Paul at that time, excluding Timothy (the co-author of this letter), sent their greetings; five of these ('Jesus who is called Justus' is the exception) also sent their greetings to Philemon in a separate epistle. Verses 10‚Äì11 :Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you, with Mark the cousin of Barnabas (about whom you received instructions: if he comes to you, welcome him), and Jesus who is called Justus. These are my only fellow workers for the kingdom of God who are of the circumcision; they have proved to be a comfort to me. NKJV *\\"Aristarchus\\": is known from some references in the Acts of the Apostles (19:29; 20:4; 27:2). *\\"Mark\\": is mentioned multiple times in the New Testament: in Acts 12:12, 25; , and 2 Timothy 4:11. *\\"Who are of the circumcision\\": denoting the \\"Christians of Jewish origin\\". Verse 12 : Epaphras, who is one of you, a bondservant of Christ, greets you, always laboring fervently for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God. NKJV *\\"Epaphras\\": Paul's co-worker, a native of Colossae. Verse 13 : For I bear him witness that he has a great zeal for you, and those who are in Laodicea, and those in Hierapolis. NKJV * \\"Laodicea and ... Hierapolis\\": two neighboring cities of Colossae in the Lycus valley of Western Anatolia (Asia Minor, now Turkey), in the land of Phrygia (). A population of 11,000 Jewish males is estimated to be in Laodicea in Paul's day, since Antiochus III placed a large colony of Jews to that area in 200 BC. Verse 14 :Luke the beloved physician and Demas greet you. NKJV Only from this verse Luke is known to be a doctor and based on the separation from the Jewish Christians mentioned in verse 11, he is identified as a \\"Gentile Christian\\". It is noted in 2 Timothy 4:10 that Demas has left Paul for \\"this world\\". Verse 18 : This salutation by my own hand‚ÄîPaul. Remember my chains. Grace be with you. Amen. NKJV *\\"By my own hand‚ÄîPaul\\": Paul is known to regularly use amanuensis (secretaries) to write his letters (cf. Romans 16:22), so to authenticate these letters, he put his own handwriting in this last paragraph (cf. ; ; ; ).
