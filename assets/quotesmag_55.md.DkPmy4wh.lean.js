Born at Brixton Hill, Surrey, England, Levi arrived in South Australia at the age of sixteen, aboard the Eden in 1838 with his parents Nathaniel Philip Levi and Sarah Levi (n√©e Goldsmid), and their five other children. He was involved in pastoral and mercantile businesses in the north of South Australia and became a well known and influential businessman. His pastoral interests involved sheep and cattle in various partnerships, many of which in the period 1855‚Äì1870 involved Alfred Watts (1815‚Äì1884). His shipping interests included, with Jacob Smith, a share in the Port Adelaide tug Goolwa. He was in 1863 one of the founders and a trustee of the Adelaide Club, where a portrait of him still hangs today. In 1853, Levi purchased Vale House, located near the River Torrens, east of Adelaide (now in the suburb of Vale Park). Over the next 96 years, it became one of the centres of social activity of Adelaide society. In 1870 Levi's Company disposed of many of its properties including Moolooloo and Wirrealpa, Oulnina and Wadnaminga, Mount Margaret and Booleroo Station. Together these properties were stocked with over 70,000 sheep and 3,000 cattle. He died at Vale House and was buried in the Jewish section of the West Terrace Cemetery, where his father was the first to be interred. His estate passed on to other members of his family, and in 1948, his niece left Vale House to the Town of Walkerville. He is remembered by Levi Caravan Park, which bears his name.

The song was written by Aguilera, Kalenna Harper, John Hill and Switch, while production was done by the latter two. \\"Bionic\\" is an electronic number and has garnered comparisons to works by artists including Santigold and Janet Jackson. Aguilera performed \\"Bionic\\" as an introduction to \\"Not Myself Tonight\\" on a number of occasions, including the 2010 MTV Movie Awards, The Today Show and VH1 Storytellers. Upon the release of Bionic, the song peaked on the US Billboard Hot 100 at number 66, and on the Korean Gaon International Download Chart at number 23.  Background and recording  After the birth of her son, Aguilera stated in an interview with Ryan Seacrest that her forthcoming album would include a totally new aspect of herself as an artist, because of the pregnancy with her son. During an interview with People in 2008, Aguilera stated that she was going to start recording new material for her forthcoming album at her home in Beverly Hills. On the album, entitled Bionic, Aguilera was inspired by electronic and electronica music, which she heard a lot during her pregnancy. Aguilera also commented about the album during an interview with Ryan Seacrest, \\"It's really a fun, fun record. Really futuristic. I was inspired by a lot of electronic music, electronic artists, and so you'll hear all those elements\\". She added, \\"[There are] different textures and things with my voice that I was really playing around with and having fun with on this record that I never even knew I could do, vocally\\". \\"Bionic\\" was recorded at three places: Dubsided recording studio in Los Angeles, California, Dreamland Studios and Mad Decent Mausoleum in Philadelphia. Aguilera's vocals were recorded at The Red Lips Room in Beverly Hills, California. The track was written by Aguilera, Kalenna Harper, John Hill and Switch. Hill and Switch also produced and provided musical instruments to \\"Bionic\\". Composition and critical reception \\"Bionic\\" is an electronic song and lasts for a duration of (three minutes and twenty-one seconds). It features \\"twitchy space-ace\\" rhythms, rapping verses and talks about an \\"echo-laden\\" invitation to \\"jet off to the new millennium\\". In the middle of the song, Aguilera spells out her name, \\"X-x-x-t-t-t-i-i-i-n-n-n-n-n-a\\". During the chorus, she sings, \\"Bionic, so damn Bionic, gonna get you with my electronic supersonic rocket, ay\\". Becky Bain of Idolator wrote that \\"This track showcases more of the adventurous new directions Christina said she hoped to try on this album. We like it!\\" She further compared \\"Bionic\\" to works by Santigold. Michael Cragg from MusicOMH wrote that the song \\"sounds just like a Santigold track, which is no bad thing\\". PopMatters critic Omar Kholeif simply described the track as \\"a thumping\\" number, while Melinda Newman of HitFix deemed it \\"a futuristic song, with interesting beats\\". Newman also compared \\"Bionic\\" to Janet Jackson's \\"Rhythm Nation\\", \\"but not nearly as captivating\\". A reviewer from Daily Star described the song as \\"a raunchy, dub-flecked treat, reminiscent of Rihanna and Santigold\\". Live performances On June 6, 2010, Aguilera performed \\"Bionic\\" for the first time at the 2010 MTV Movie Awards, held at Gibson Amphitheatre in Los Angeles, California. There, she sang the track as the introduction to \\"Not Myself Tonight\\" and \\"Woohoo\\". During the performance of \\"Bionic\\", she sported curly platinum hair and was dressed in a \\"diamond- encrusted one-piece\\" while sitting on a \\"gilded throne\\". Caryn Ganz from Rolling Stone opined that the way Aguilera began the performance was similar to Madonna during the latter's Sticky & Sweet Tour (2008-09). Then, Aguilera walked on the stage and \\"leather-clad\\" back-up dancers in silver and black outfits began to perform a dance routine. The performance was met with mainly negative reviews and failed to gain impact from media outlets. Tamar Anitai for MTV Buzzworthy was not impressed toward her performance, summarizing it \\"was all about her \\"I-I'm-still-a-diva\\" vocals, frenzied stage show, and adult-only innuendo... And then this happened\\". In a positive view, James Montgomery for MTV News praised her looking as \\"a 23rd-century queen\\" and the show \\"got millions of people all hot and bothered\\". On June 8, 2010, Aguilera performed \\"Bionic\\" as the introduction to \\"Not Myself Tonight\\" on The Today Show, along with \\"Beautiful\\", \\"Fighter\\" and \\"You Lost Me\\". Selected as the opener of the show, she performed in her \\"hinestone tights\\" and \\"red hot pants\\". Following the highly criticized performance at the 2010 MTV Movie Awards, Aguilera's performance at The Today Show was well received by most critics. James Dinh for MTV News named it \\"aggressive\\", while Erika Brooks Adickman for Idolator called the performance a \\"hot-mess show wardrobe\\". Simon Vozick-Levinson for Entertainment Weekly, however was mixed towards the \\"Bionic\\" and \\"Not Myself Tonight\\" part. He wrote that the two songs aren't \\"memorable\\", yet praising her vocals: \\"definitely better voice than she was\\". Aguilera also appeared on music television series VH1 Storytellers and sang \\"Bionic\\" and \\"Not Myself Tonight\\", with \\"Beautiful\\" as the follow-up. The singer's performances during the show were later aired on June 13, 2010.

The Florida Supreme Court adopted the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure in March 1954. The proper abbreviation for the rules is Fla.R.Civ.P. The rules may be amended, or new rules added, from time to time and upon the approval of the Florida Supreme Court.  Scope  The rules apply to all civil actions and special statutory proceedings in circuit and county courts, except probate court, family court, and small claims court.  Personal Jurisdiction in Florida  For a court in Florida to have personal jurisdiction over a defendant, Florida statutory requirements must be met and federal Constitutional limits must be complied with.  Florida Statutory Requirements for Personal Jurisdiction  Florida statutes allow for personal jurisdiction over defendants who: # Reside in Florida (and are natural persons), # Are served with process in Florida, # Consent to jurisdiction, # Make a general appearance without timely objection, # Are a corporation incorporated in Florida, # Are a corporation with their principal place of business in Florida, or # Whose acts trigger Florida's Long Arm Statute.  Constitutional Limits on Personal Jurisdiction  See Constitutional limits on personal jurisdiction.  In Rem and Quasi In Rem Jurisdiction  In rem jurisdiction affects the interests of all persons in a thing. In rem jurisdiction may be exercised in a limited class of cases, when the court has control over the thing itself, like with a suit to quiet title to land in Florida. Quasi in rem jurisdiction affects the interest of specified persons in a thing. The court must have physical power over the property itself, like by attachment, and the constitutional minimum contacts standard must be met.  Subject Matter Jurisdiction in Florida  For a court in Florida to have subject matter jurisdiction, Florida statutory requirements must be met and federal Constitutional limits must be complied with. The Florida Constitution vested the judicial power in four types of courts:Fla. Const. of 1968, Art. V, ¬ß 1 (1998).  County Court  * Has jurisdiction over all law matters less than $30,000 (except ones within the exclusive jurisdiction of circuit court), cases in equity less than $30,000, landlord-tenant eviction actions, real property possession actions, uncontested or simplified divorce proceedings, and homeowners' associations disputes.  Circuit Court  * (Usually) has appellate review of county court decisions. Is the trial court of general jurisdiction, so it hears cases at law and equity, ejectment actions, real property title or boundary actions, etc.Fla. Const. of 1968, Art. V, ¬ß 5(b) (1972).  District Courts of Appeal (DCA)  * Once a circuit court decision is final, it can be heard as a matter of right by the DCA unless the matter is exclusively in the supreme court's jurisdiction.  Supreme Court of Florida  * Appellate court with limited jurisdiction. Appeal may be discretionary or may be a matter of right.  Venue in Florida  Typically, venue is proper only in the county where the defendant resides when the action begins, where the cause of action arose, or where property in litigation is located. If multiple defendants reside in different counties, venue can be in any one of their counties of residence.Fla. Stat. ¬ß 47.011  Change of Venue  See Change of venue and Fla.R.Civ.P. 1.060. Transfers of Actions.Fla.R.Civ.P. 1.060. Transfers of Actions.  Choice of Forum  Fla.R.Civ.P. 1.061 prescribes Choice of Forum rules.Fla.R.Civ.P. 1.061. A defendant can file a forum non conveniens motion to dismiss a cause of action within 60 days of service of process. Under Rule 1.061(a), a trial court, in its discretion, can dismiss an action \\"on the ground that a satisfactory remedy may be more conveniently sought in a jurisdiction other than Florida\\" when it finds there is an adequate alternative forum which private interest factors favor. If the competing private factors are balanced, public interest factors can tip the scales in favor of the alternative forum.  Process  Fla.R.Civ.P. 1.070 - Process, explains Service of Process including Personal Service and Service by Publication.Fla.R.Civ.P. 1.070- Process When a complaint is filed at the clerk of court (commencing the action), the clerk or judge will automatically issue a summons letting the defendant know about the claim and that if defendant does not respond, defendant will lose by default. Service of process may be made by an officer or an appointed, competent, uninterested person. The process server should make proof of service through affidavit.  Pleadings and Motions  Florida recognizes just seven different pleadings in Fla.R.Civ.P. 1.100:Fla.R.Civ.P. 1.100(a). 2020. Accessed May 30, 2020. # Complaint (or if designated by statute/rule, \\"Petition\\") # Answer # Reply (if the answer contains a defense, the opposing party must file a reply to avoid it) # Answer to a counterclaim # Answer to a crossclaim (if the answer contains a crossclaim) # Third-party complaint (if someone who was not an original party is summoned as a third-party defendant) # Third-party answer Motions are not pleadings. Motions are applications to the court for an order. They must be in writing unless during a hearing or trial.Fla.R.Civ.P. 1.100(b). 2020. A motion has to state with particularity the grounds for it, and must explain the relief or order it seeks.  Parties = Interpleader  See Fla.R.Civ.P. 1.240. Interpleader.  Joinder of Parties  For Joinder, Misjoinder and Nonjoinder of Parties, see Fla.R.Civ.P. 1.250.  Class Actions  Fla.R.Civ.P. 1.220 deals with Class Actions. Florida's approach to class actions is similar to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23.

Racism reached its peak during the Nazi regime which eventually led to a program of systematic state-sponsored murder known as The Holocaust. According to reports by the European Commission, milder forms of racism are still present in parts of German society. 19th and early 20th centuries Herero people chained up in 1904 When Germany struggled to become a belated colonial power in the 19th century, several atrocities were committed, most notably the Herero and Namaqua Genocide in what is now Namibia. The German authorities forced the survivors of the genocide into concentration camps. Many white Germans were afraid of miscegenation because they believed that it would \\"taint\\" the purity of German blood. Many multiracial children were sterilized and taken from their mothers to become wards of the state. There was a big push to get these multiracial German children adopted by Black Americans because they were seen as having no place in Germany. A great deal of racial propaganda arose regarding the conception of these children. Although there was only one confirmed case, it was said that the white mothers of these children were raped by Black French and American soldiers. Eugen Fischer, a German professor of medicine, anthropology and eugenics conducted \\"medical experiments on race‚Äù in these camps, including sterilizations and injections of smallpox, typhus and tuberculosis. He advocated the genocide of alleged \\"inferior races\\" stating that \\"whoever thinks thoroughly about the notion of race, cannot arrive at a different conclusion\\". The Herero genocide has commanded the attention of historians who study complex issues of continuity between this event and the Nazi Holocaust.A Historical Companion to Postcolonial Literatures - Continental Europe and its Empires, page 240 Edinburgh University Press 2009 According to Clarence Lusane, an Associate Professor of Political Science at the American University School of International Service, Fischer's experiments can be seen as testing ground for later medical procedures used during the Nazi Holocaust. Against the Polish population The Germanization policies against the Polish population in Germany were largely concentrated in territories conquered from Poland during the Partitions of Poland, but they were also enforced in Silesia, Pomerania and Masuria. They were motivated by racism. The Third Reich and the Holocaust Corpses at the Buchenwald concentration camp After the Nazis came to power in 1933, racism became a part of the official state ideology.Christian Geulen: Geschichte des Rassismus, C.H. Beck, M√ºnchen 2007, 97f Shortly after the Nazis came to power, they passed the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service which expelled all civil servants who were of \\"non-Aryan\\" origin, with a few exceptions.The Nazi Germany Sourcebook: An Anthology of Texts, ed Roderick Stackelberg, Sally A. Winkle, Routledge, Article 3.12b First Regulation for Administration of the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service The Nazis passed the Nuremberg Laws in 1935. The first law known as the \\"Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour\\" forbade sexual relations and marriages between people of \\"German blood\\" and Jews. Shortly afterwards, the Nazis extended this law to include \\"Gypsies, negroes or their bastards\\".Burleigh, p. 50 Although the Nazis preached racial supremacy, in several books and pamphlets they stated that they were preaching racial consciousness rather than supremacy such as: The Nazis believed that race determined everything and they told the Germans to be racially conscious. In the 1930s and 1940s, Nazi Germany's military conquest of Europe in the Second World War was followed by countless acts of racially motivated murder and genocide. In its broad definition, the term Holocaust refers to an industrially run programme of state-sponsored murder by Nazi Germany, a genocide of different groups and the murder of individuals, whom the German authorities at this time defined as belonging to an \\"inferior race\\", as having \\"life unworthy of life\\" or advocating beliefs that were disturbing to their politics. The affected cultures use their own expressions such as: The Shoah (Hebrew: , HaShoah, \\"catastrophe\\"; Yiddish: , Churben or Hurban,\\"Holocaust,\\" Encyclop?dia Britannica, 2009: \\"the systematic state-sponsored killing of six million Jewish men, women and children, and millions of others by Nazi Germany and its collaborators during World War II. The Nazis called this \\"the final solution to the Jewish question ...\\" in the Jewish context, the Porajmos [Àåp…î Åm…îs] (also Porrajmos or Pharrajimos, literally \\"devouring\\" or \\"destruction\\" in some dialects of the Romani language) used by Gypsies, or the Polish word \\"Zag≈Çada\\" (literally meaning \\"annihilation\\", or \\"extinction\\") often used by Poles as a synonym of the word Holocaust.Niewyk, Donald L. The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust, Columbia University Press, 2000, p.45: \\"The Holocaust is commonly defined as the murder of more than Jews by the Germans in World War II.\\" The Holocaust was one of many outbreaks of antisemitism, a term coined in the late 19th century in Germany as a more scientific-sounding term for Judenhass (\\"Jew-hatred\\"). Scientific theories on antisemitism are divided into what degree it can be subsumed under racism and to what degree it can be subsumed under other causes and mechanisms. Incidents in reunified Germany More than 130 people were killed in racist street violence in Germany, in the years between 1990 and 2010, according to the German newspaper Die Zeit. Die Zeit: Rechte Gewalt Only some of the most publicly noted cases are listed below. In particular, after German reunification in the 1990s a wave of racist street violence claimed numerous lives, with notable incidents including the arson attack in M√∂lln and the Riot of Rostock-Lichtenhagen in 1992, the Solingen arson attack of 1993, and the attack on No√´l Martin in 1996. In 2006, a black German citizen of Ethiopian descent named as Ermyas M., an engineer was beaten into a coma by two unknown assailants who called him \\"nigger\\" in an unprovoked attack that has reawakened concern about racist violence in eastern Germany. He was waiting for a tram in Potsdam, near Berlin, when two people approached him shouting \\"nigger\\". When he objected, they attacked him with a bottle and beat him to the ground. Also in 2006, German-Turkish politician Giyasettin Sayan, a member of Berlin's regional assembly, was attacked by two men who called him a \\"dirty foreigner\\". Sayan, who represents the Left party, suffered head injuries and bruising after his attackers struck him with a bottle in a street in his Lichtenberg ward in the East of the city. In August 2007, a mob consisting of about 50 Germans attacked 8 Indian street vendors during a town festival in the town of Muegeln near Leipzig. The victims found shelter in a pizzeria owned by Kulvir Singh, one of those being chased, but the mob broke through the doors and destroyed Singh's car. All eight were injured and it took 70 police to quell the violence In 2009, the murder of Marwa El-Sherbini caused considerable public reaction in Germany and other countries. Al- Sherbini, a 32-year-old Egyptian national, was stabbed to death in a Dresden courtroom on July 1, 2009 by Alex Wiens, an ethnic German immigrant from Russia. She had been in court to testify against Wiens who had previously racially insulted her for wearing a headscarf. Her husband, Egyptian academic Elwy Ali Okaz, was critically wounded in the attack when he tried to take on Wiens, being stabbed by him and shot by court security who thought he was the attacker. There is evidence that, in 2015, Professor Annette Beck-Sickinger at the University of Leipzig in Germany rejected Indian candidates on the basis of racism and stereotyping. The incidents were so severe - amid shock that they were perpetrated by an apparently 'educated' woman - that Germany's ambassador to India wrote a strongly worded letter condemning the professor, stating: \\"Your oversimplifying and discriminating generalization is an offense ... to millions of law-abiding, tolerant, open-minded and hard-working Indians,\\" he wrote. \\"Let's be clear: India is not a country of rapists.\\" General reports The European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) noted in 2001, in its second report on the situation of the approximately 9% non- citizen population after German reunification: Civil rights activist Ika H√ºgel-Marshall has complained that she and others found it difficult to be regarded as German due to their ethnic background. She co- founded the Afro-Deutsch movement in the 1980s to raise awareness of Germans with African ancestry. The movement was designed \\"to resist marginalization and discrimination, to gain social acceptance, and to construct a cultural identity for themselves.\\" According to the United Nations, people with a migrant background also \\"are under-represented in important institutions, including the political system, the police and the courts\\". Public debate Critics say that a lingering xenophobia in parts of German society is being ignored. A representative from the country's Jewish Council argued that Germany is lacking a coordinated \\"nationwide action plan\\" when it comes to right-wing extremism. The German government was quick to condemn attacks, fearing that the developments could tarnish the country's image. A former government spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye said that dark-skinned visitors to Germany should consider avoiding the eastern part of the country where racism runs high. \\"There are small and medium-sized towns in Brandenburg, as well as elsewhere, which I would advise a visitor of another skin color to avoid going to. It is also reported that German police 'routinely ignore racist attacks'. SPD politician Sebastian Edathy said \\"People with dark skin have a much higher risk of being a victim of an attack in eastern Germany than in western Germany.\\" He also accused municipalities in the east of not investing enough in the prevention of right-wing extremism.\\" Undercover journalist G√ºnter Wallraff traveled across Germany for more than a year wearing a dark-haired curly wig and his white skin painted black, in a documentary film titled Black on White. He said that \\"I hadn't known what we would discover, and had thought maybe the story will be, what a tolerant and accepting country we have become, unfortunately I was wrong.\\" Racist organizations in Germany German white power skinhead Despite widespread rejection of Nazi Germany in modern Germany, there have been Neo-Nazi activities and organizations in post-war Germany. At times these groups face legal issues. Hence the Volkssozialistische Bewegung Deutschlands/Partei der Arbeit, Action Front of National Socialists/National Activists, Free German Workers' Party, and the Nationalist Front were all banned. The National Democratic Party of Germany has been accused of Neo-Nazi or Neo-Fascist leanings but historian Walter Laqueur writes that it cannot be classified that way.Laqueur, Walter, Fascism: Past, Present, Future, p.110 ReferencesExternal links=Official reports *Report of the UN Special Rapporteur on Contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance on his visit to Germany, 2010 *European Commission against Racism and Intolerance ‚Äî 4thj report on Germany *CERD concluding observations on Germany, 2008 *Racism in Germany and its impact on the Turkish minority *Germany: freedom to speak on racism under threat *\\"Germany's 'Brown Babies' Must Be Helped!

Early works included manufacturing glasshouses and other major orders included all the bronze windows for Barry's new Houses of Parliament, London, in 1845 - 57. The company moved to new works in Halford Lane, Smethwick (now part of the Metropolitan Borough of Sandwell) in 1905. Following the First World War (1914 - 1918) the company became involved in the development of 'standard metal windows, along with other companies such as Crittall of Braintree, Essex. Their metal windows were fitted to buildings such as the Bank of England, London, the League of Nations Building, Geneva, ICI House, London & the Iraq Parliament House in Baghdad. In 1925 the company, who had long exported to the North American market, acquired the International Casement Company, Jamestown, New York that became Hopes Windows Inc., in 1930. Hope's 1930 catalogue Hope's Gearings, along with their metal glazing systems, were fitted to many major industrial plants such as the Ford Dagenham assembly plant at Dagenham, Essex, and power stations such as Cliff Quay, Ipswich, Suffolk. In 1930 the company opened a hot-dip galvanising plant in Wednesbury, Staffordshire and this was, in the post-WW2 period, to become the main plant for metal window production.A short History of Henry Hope & Sons, 1818 - 1958; H Hope; Smethwick; 1958 In 1965 the company merged with old rivals \\"Crittall Windows Ltd\\" of Braintree and the combined \\"Crittall Hope Ltd\\" is still, after various takeovers and de- mergers, in business although now no longer carrying the name of Hope.

Achenbach was a member of the Nazi Party prior to 1945 and served in the German Embassy in Paris during World War II, where he was responsible for rounding up 2,000 Jews as hostages. Early life and World War II Achenbach, a Protestant by faith, attended High School in Gelsenkirchen. Subsequently, he studied law in Paris, Berlin, Hamburg and Bonn. After the first state examination in 1931, he pursued further studies and graduated in 1936, and began working as Managing Director of the Adolf Hitler Fund, involved with the collection of donations. He became a formal member of the Nazi party in 1937. Achenbach joined the German foreign service in 1939 and served at the German Embassy in Paris. During the German occupation of France (1940‚Äì1944), he was from June 1940 to May 1943, head of the embassy's Political Department, and a close collaborator of German ambassador Otto Abetz. In that framework, Achenbach was also responsible for implementing the deportation of the Jews. In 1944/45 he was a soldier and after the war he led American investigators to believe that the German embassy in France had been a stronghold of the conspiracy against Hitler.So seine Einlassungen gegen√ºber US-Ankl√§ger Robert Kemper 1947 laut Vernehmungsprotokoll, Stadtarchiv N√ºrnberg, Akte A6.

Fischer Taschenbuch Verlag, Zweite aktualisierte Auflage, Frankfurt am Main 2005, S. 10. and successfully defended both Alexander von Falkenhausen and Eggert Reeder at their trial for war crimes in Belgium in 1951. In the early 1950s, Achenbach advocated for the amnesty of the German war criminals. Towards this goal, in 1951, he organized a lobby group which employed Werner Best, former deputy chief of the SD, and Franz Six, one of the leader of mobile killing units in the Soviet Union and a convicted war criminal. These activities led to a scandal in 1970 when he initially failed to make it as a Commissioner in the European Economic Community because of public pressure.Torben Fischer, Matthias N. Lorenz (Hg.): Lexikon der ‚ÄûVergangenheitsbew√§ltigung‚Äú in Deutschland. Bielefeld 2007, S. 103. In 1974, Achenbach's involvement in the Holocaust became public knowledge and he was forced to resign from this position. Political career Achenbach (middle) (1972) After the war, Achenbach joined the Free Democratic Party, and served as a foreign affairs spokesman until April 1953. Within the FDP in North Rhine-Westphalia, he was considered the right hand of the State Chairman Friedrich Middelhauve and was responsible for fundraising from industry donations. He was assisted by his contacts from his time as CEO of the Foundation Adolf Hitler Fund, including Hugo Stinnes, Jr., Heinz Wilke, Wolfgang Diewerge, etc., all of whom were former Nazis. From 1953 to 1959 he was Chairman of the FDP Ruhr District Association and from 1970 to 1973 of the Ruhr District Association West. He also belonged for several years to the Landtag of the North Rhine-Westphalia. From 1957 to 1976 he was a member of the Bundestag and from December 7, 1971 to 1972, Achenbach served as Vice Chairman of the FDP. Throughout much of the 1960s and 1970s he was involved in foreign policy and defense. From 1969 to 1974 for instance he was Chairman of the Committee on Relations with African Countries and Madagascar, and then until 1976, a member of the Committee on Development and Cooperation. As an active member of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Bundestag until 1976, he was responsible for the Franco-German Supplementary Agreement to Transition signed in 1971, and successfully prevented its ratification until 1974.

The selection is taken from the 281 recordings listed on the Bach Cantatas Website , beginning with the first recording by a symphony orchestra and choir to match, conducted by Albert Coates. Beginning in the late 1960s, historically informed performances paved the way for recordings with smaller groups, boys choirs and ensembles playing period instruments, and eventually to recordings using the one-voice-on-a-vocal-part scoring first argued for by Joshua Rifkin in 1982.  History  The work was first recorded by symphonic choirs and orchestras. From the late 1960s, historically informed performances (HIP) tried to adhere more to the sounds of the composer's lifetime, who typically wrote for boys choirs and for comparatively small orchestras of Baroque instruments, often now called \\"period instruments\\". Some scholars believe that Bach used only one singer for a vocal part in the choral movements, termed \\"one voice per part\\" (OVPP). On some of these recordings, the solo singer is reinforced in choral movements with a larger orchestra by a ripieno singer (OVPP+R). The first complete recording of the work was conducted by Albert Coates in 1929. Robert Shaw led the first American recording in 1947. Some recordings are documents of live concerts, such as a 1968 performance conducted by Karl Richter at the Moscow Conservatory Grand Hall. The same year, the first HIP recording appeared, conducted by Nikolaus Harnoncourt, followed by Johan van der Meer's version with the Groningse Bachvereniging in 1975 which was recorded live in Utrecht at the Holland Festival. The first OVPP recording appeared in 1982, conducted by Joshua Rifkin.  Table of selected recordings  The sortable listing is taken from the selection provided by Aryeh Oron on the Bach-Cantatas website. Soloists Bach composed the work for five soloists: soprano I and II, alto, tenor and bass. The soloists are listed in the table in the order SATB. Some recordings arranged the music for four soloists, the movements in which soprano II (SII) is requested, are divided, sung by soprano I (SI) and alto (A). * Christe eleison: A for SII in the duet with SI * Laudamus te: SI or A in the aria for SII Some recordings divide the two bass solos on two singers because of their very different tessitura: * Quoniam tu solus sanctus: the aria requires a bass with a strong low register * Et in spiritum sanctum: the aria requires a bass with a high range which would today be termed a baritone The composition has a movement for two choirs SATB, Osanna. In recordings with one voice per part (OVPP), the soloists are normally listed in the order SSAATTBB. For some recordings, only the singers doing solo work are named.

On 17 August captured the French privateer Messager in sight of Nimrod, commanded by William Marsh. In January 1805 head and prize money from the proceeds of Messager was due to be paid.

In January 1814, while serving in the blockade of Brest, Nimrod was present when captured the brig Henriette. This gave rise to a court case in which Clarence claimed sole prize rights and the other vessels in the blockading squadron claimed shares. The Court ruled that as a matter of principle: \\"When a prize is taken coming out of a blockaded port, by one of the blockading squadron stationed off the mouth of the harbour, the other ships of the squadron, although stationed at some distance, are entitled to share.\\" However, when the case came up for a hearing on the evidence, the court rejected the squadron's claim on the grounds that Henriette did not come out from Brest but rather was a small coaster traveling between Legue and Croisi that had taken shelter in Cannonet Bay.

The exact composition of the recipe is guarded by butchers as a trade secret and therefore varies from village to village. Pinkel with a high meat content is also described as Fleisch-Pinkel (\\"meat pinkel\\") or Oldenburger Pinkel. Pinkel is traditionally filled into the edible small intestines of pigs, although today edible artificial casings are also used.

Wrong input polarity has caused massive overheating of the chip and melted the plastic casing. Electronic components have a wide range of failure modes. These can be classified in various ways, such as by time or cause. Failures can be caused by excess temperature, excess current or voltage, ionizing radiation, mechanical shock, stress or impact, and many other causes. In semiconductor devices, problems in the device package may cause failures due to contamination, mechanical stress of the device, or open or short circuits. Failures most commonly occur near the beginning and near the ending of the lifetime of the parts, resulting in the bathtub curve graph of failure rates. Burn-in procedures are used to detect early failures. In semiconductor devices, parasitic structures, irrelevant for normal operation, become important in the context of failures; they can be both a source and protection against failure. Applications such as aerospace systems, life support systems, telecommunications, railway signals, and computers use great numbers of individual electronic components. Analysis of the statistical properties of failures can give guidance in designs to establish a given level of reliability. For example, power-handling ability of a resistor may be greatly derated when applied in high-altitude aircraft to obtain adequate service life. A sudden fail-open fault can cause multiple secondary failures if it is fast and the circuit contains an inductance; this causes large voltage spikes, which may exceed 500 volts. A broken metallisation on a chip may thus cause secondary overvoltage damage.STFA 2001: proceedings of the 27th International Symposium for Testing and Failure Analysis: 11‚Äì15 November 2001, Santa Clara Convention Center, Santa Clara, California, p. 267 Thermal runaway can cause sudden failures including melting, fire or explosions. Packaging failures The majority of electronic parts failures are packaging-related. Packaging, as the barrier between electronic parts and the environment, is very susceptible to environmental factors. Thermal expansion produces mechanical stresses that may cause material fatigue, especially when the thermal expansion coefficients of the materials are different. Humidity and aggressive chemicals can cause corrosion of the packaging materials and leads, potentially breaking them and damaging the inside parts, leading to electrical failure. Exceeding the allowed environmental temperature range can cause overstressing of wire bonds, thus tearing the connections loose, cracking the semiconductor dies, or causing packaging cracks. Humidity and subsequent high temperature heating may also cause cracking, as may mechanical damage or shock. During encapsulation, bonding wires can be severed, shorted, or touch the chip die, usually at the edge. Dies can crack due to mechanical overstress or thermal shock; defects introduced during processing, like scribing, can develop into fractures. Lead frames may contain excessive material or burrs, causing shorts. Ionic contaminants like alkali metals and halogens can migrate from the packaging materials to the semiconductor dies, causing corrosion or parameter deterioration. Glass-metal seals commonly fail by forming radial cracks that originate at the pin-glass interface and permeate outwards; other causes include a weak oxide layer on the interface and poor formation of a glass meniscus around the pin. Various gases may be present in the package cavity, either as impurities trapped during manufacturing, outgassing of the materials used, or chemical reactions, as is when the packaging material gets overheated (the products are often ionic and facilitate corrosion with delayed failure). To detect this, helium is often in the inert atmosphere inside the packaging as a tracer gas to detect leaks during testing. Carbon dioxide and hydrogen may form from organic materials, moisture is outgassed by polymers and amine-cured epoxies outgas ammonia. Formation of cracks and intermetallic growth in die attachments may lead to formation of voids and delamination, impairing heat transfer from the chip die to the substrate and heatsink and causing a thermal failure. As some semiconductors like silicon and gallium arsenide are infrared-transparent, infrared microscopy can check the integrity of die bonding and under-die structures. Red phosphorus, used as a charring-promoter flame retardant, facilitates silver migration when present in packaging. It is normally coated with aluminium hydroxide; if the coating is incomplete, the phosphorus particles oxidize to the highly hygroscopic phosphorus pentoxide, which reacts with moisture to phosphoric acid. This is a corrosive electrolyte that in the presence of electric fields facilitates dissolution and migration of silver, short-circuiting adjacent packaging pins, lead frame leads, tie bars, chip mount structures, and chip pads. The silver bridge may be interrupted by thermal expansion of the package; thus, disappearance of the shorting when the chip is heated and its reappearance after cooling is an indication of this problem. Delamination and thermal expansion may move the chip die relative to the packaging, deforming and possibly shorting or cracking the bonding wires. Contact failures Electrical contacts exhibit ubiquitous contact resistance, the magnitude of which is governed by surface structure and the composition of surface layers. Ideally contact resistance should be low and stable, however weak contact pressure, mechanical vibration, corrosion, and the formation of passivizing oxide layers and contacts can alter contact resistance significantly, leading to resistance heating and circuit failure. Soldered joints can fail in many ways like electromigration and formation of brittle intermetallic layers. Some failures show only at extreme joint temperatures, hindering troubleshooting. Thermal expansion mismatch between the printed circuit board material and its packaging strains the part-to-board bonds; while leaded parts can absorb the strain by bending, leadless parts rely on the solder to absorb stresses. Thermal cycling may lead to fatigue cracking of the solder joints, especially with elastic solders; various approaches are used to mitigate such incidents. Loose particles, like bonding wire and weld flash, can form in the device cavity and migrate inside the packaging, causing often intermittent and shock-sensitive shorts. Corrosion may cause buildup of oxides and other nonconductive products on the contact surfaces. When closed, these then show unacceptably high resistance; they may also migrate and cause shorts. Tin whiskers can form on tin-coated metals like the internal side of the packagings; loose whiskers then can cause intermittent short circuits inside the packaging. Cables, in addition to the methods described above, may fail by fraying and fire damage. Printed circuit board failures Severe PCB corrosion from a leaky PCB mounted Ni-Cd battery Printed circuit boards (PCBs) are vulnerable to environmental influences; for example, the traces are corrosion-prone and may be improperly etched leaving partial shorts, while the vias may be insufficiently plated through or filled with solder. The traces may crack under mechanical loads, often resulting in unreliable PCB operation. Residues of solder flux may facilitate corrosion; those of other materials on PCBs can cause electrical leaks. Polar covalent compounds can attract moisture like antistatic agents, forming a thin layer of conductive moisture between the traces; ionic compounds like chlorides tend to facilitate corrosion. Alkali metal ions may migrate through plastic packaging and influence the functioning of semiconductors. Chlorinated hydrocarbon residues may hydrolyze and release corrosive chlorides; these are problems that occur after years. Polar molecules may dissipate high-frequency energy, causing parasitic dielectric losses. Above the glass transition temperature of PCBs, the resin matrix softens and becomes susceptible contaminant diffusion. For example, polyglycols from the solder flux can enter the board and increase its humidity intake, with corresponding deterioration of dielectric and corrosion properties. Multi-layer substrates using ceramics suffer from many of the same problems. Conductive anodic filaments (CAFs) may grow within the boards along the fibers of the composite material. Metal is introduced to a vulnerable surface typically from plating the vias, then migrates in presence of ions, moisture, and electrical potential; drilling damage and poor glass-resin bonding promotes such failures. The formation of CAFs usually begins by poor glass-resin bonding; a layer of adsorbed moisture then provides a channel through which ions and corrosion products migrate. In presence of chloride ions, the precipitated material is atacamite; its semiconductive properties lead to increased current leakage, deteriorated dielectric strength, and short circuits between traces. Absorbed glycols from flux residues aggravate the problem. The difference in thermal expansion of the fibers and the matrix weakens the bond when the board is soldered; the lead-free solders which require higher soldering temperatures increase the occurrence of CAFs. Besides this, CAFs depend on absorbed humidity; below a certain threshold, they do not occur. Delamination may occur to separate the board layers, cracking the vias and conductors to introduce pathways for corrosive contaminants and migration of conductive species. Relay failures Every time the contacts of an electromechanical relay or contactor are opened or closed, there is a certain amount of contact wear. An electric arc occurs between the contact points (electrodes) both during the transition from closed to open (break) or from open to closed (make). The arc caused during the contact break (break arc) is akin to arc welding, as the break arc is typically more energetic and more destructive. The heat and current of the electrical arc across the contacts creates specific cone & crater formations from metal migration. In addition to the physical contact damage, there appears also a coating of carbon and other matter. This degradation drastically limits the overall operating life of a relay or contactor to a range of perhaps 100,000 operations, a level representing 1% or less than the mechanical life expectancy of the same device. Semiconductor failures Many failures result in generation of hot electrons. These are observable under an optical microscope, as they generate near-infrared photons detectable by a CCD camera. Latchups can be observed this way. If visible, the location of failure may present clues to the nature of the overstress. Liquid crystal coatings can be used for localization of faults: cholesteric liquid crystals are thermochromic and are used for visualisation of locations of heat production on the chips, while nematic liquid crystals respond to voltage and are used for visualising current leaks through oxide defects and of charge states on the chip surface (particularly logical states). Laser marking of plastic-encapsulated packages may damage the chip if glass spheres in the packaging line up and direct the laser to the chip. Examples of semiconductor failures relating to semiconductor crystals include: * Nucleation and growth of dislocations. This requires an existing defect in the crystal, as is done by radiation, and is accelerated by heat, high current density and emitted light. With LEDs, gallium arsenide and aluminium gallium arsenide are more susceptible to this than gallium arsenide phosphide and indium phosphide; gallium nitride and indium gallium nitride are insensitive to this defect. * Accumulation of charge carriers trapped in the gate oxide of MOSFETs. This introduces permanent gate biasing, influencing the transistor's threshold voltage; it may be caused by hot carrier injection, ionizing radiation or nominal use. With EEPROM cells, this is the major factor limiting the number of erase-write cycles. * Migration of charge carriers from floating gates. This limits the lifetime of stored data in EEPROM and flash EPROM structures. * Improper passivation. Corrosion is a significant source of delayed failures; semiconductors, metallic interconnects, and passivation glasses are all susceptible. The surface of semiconductors subjected to moisture has an oxide layer; the liberated hydrogen reacts with deeper layers of the material, yielding volatile hydrides. Parameter failures Vias are a common source of unwanted serial resistance on chips; defective vias show unacceptably high resistance and therefore increase propagation delays. As their resistivity drops with increasing temperature, degradation of the maximum operating frequency of the chip the other way is an indicator of such a fault. Mousebites are regions where metallization has a decreased width; such defects usually do not show during electrical testing but present a major reliability risk. Increased current density in the mousebite can aggravate electromigration problems; a large degree of voiding is needed to create a temperature-sensitive propagation delay.Microelectronics failure analysis: desk reference By Electronic Device Failure Analysis Society. Desk Reference Committee, ASM International, 2004 p. 79 Sometimes, circuit tolerances can make erratic behaviour difficult to trace; for example, a weak driver transistor, a higher series resistance and the capacitance of the gate of the subsequent transistor may be within tolerance but can significantly increase signal propagation delay. These can manifest only at specific environmental conditions, high clock speeds, low power supply voltages, and sometimes specific circuit signal states; significant variations can occur on a single die. Overstress-induced damage like ohmic shunts or a reduced transistor output current can increase such delays, leading to erratic behavior. As propagation delays depend heavily on supply voltage, tolerance-bound fluctuations of the latter can trigger such behavior. Gallium arsenide monolithic microwave integrated circuits can have these failures:Chapter 4. Basic Failure Modes and Mechanisms, S. Kayali * Degradation of IDSSWhat is IDSS of a FET Transistor? by gate sinking and hydrogen poisoning. This failure is the most common and easiest to detect, and is affected by reduction of the active channel of the transistor in gate sinking and depletion of the donor density in the active channel for hydrogen poisoning. * Degradation in gate leakage current. This occurs at accelerated life tests or high temperatures and is suspected to be caused by surface-state effects. * Degradation in pinch-off voltage. This is a common failure mode for gallium arsenide devices operating at high temperature, and primarily stems from semiconductor-metal interactions and degradation of gate metal structures, with hydrogen being another reason. It can be hindered by a suitable barrier metal between the contacts and gallium arsenide. * Increase in drain-to-source resistance. It is observed in high-temperature devices, and is caused by metal-semiconductor interactions, gate sinking and ohmic contact degradation. Metallisation failures Micro-photograph of a failed TO3 power transistor due to short circuit Metallisation failures are more common and serious causes of FET transistor degradation than material processes; amorphous materials have no grain boundaries, hindering interdiffusion and corrosion. Examples of such failures include: * Electromigration moving atoms out of active regions, causing dislocations and point defects acting as nonradiative recombination centers producing heat. This may occur with aluminium gates in MESFETs with RF signals, causing erratic drain current; electromigration in this case is called gate sinking. This issue does not occur with gold gates. With structures having aluminium over a refractory metal barrier, electromigration primarily affects aluminium but not the refractory metal, causing the structure's resistance to erratically increase. Displaced aluminium may cause shorts to neighbouring structures; 0.5-4% of copper in the aluminium increases electromigration resistance, the copper accumulating on the alloy grain boundaries and increasing the energy needed to dislodge atoms from them. Other than that, indium tin oxide and silver are subject to electromigration, causing leakage current and (in LEDs) nonradiative recombination along chip edges. In all cases, electromigration can cause changes in dimensions and parameters of the transistor gates and semiconductor junctions. * Mechanical stresses, high currents, and corrosive environments forming of whiskers and short circuits. These effects can occur both within packaging and on circuit boards. * Formation of silicon nodules. Aluminium interconnects may be silicon-doped to saturation during deposition to prevent alloy spikes. During thermal cycling, the silicon atoms may migrate and clump together forming nodules that act as voids, increasing local resistance and lowering device lifetime. * Ohmic contact degradation between metallisation and semiconductor layers. With gallium arsenide, a layer of gold-germanium alloy (sometimes with nickel) is used to achieve low contact resistance; an ohmic contact is formed by diffusion of germanium, forming a thin, highly n-doped region under the metal facilitating the connection, leaving gold deposited over it. Gallium atoms may migrate through this layer and get scavenged by the gold above, creating a defect-rich gallium-depleted zone under the contact; gold and oxygen then migrate oppositely, resulting in increased resistance of the ohmic contact and depletion of effective doping level. Formation of intermetallic compounds also plays a role in this failure mode. Electrical overstress Most stress-related semiconductor failures are electrothermal in nature microscopically; locally increased temperatures can lead to immediate failure by melting or vaporising metallisation layers, melting the semiconductor or by changing structures. Diffusion and electromigration tend to be accelerated by high temperatures, shortening the lifetime of the device; damage to junctions not leading to immediate failure may manifest as altered current‚Äìvoltage characteristics of the junctions. Electrical overstress failures can be classified as thermally-induced, electromigration-related and electric field- related failures; examples of such failures include: * Thermal runaway, where clusters in the substrate cause localised loss of thermal conductivity, leading to damage producing more heat; the most common causes are voids caused by incomplete soldering, electromigration effects and Kirkendall voiding. Clustered distribution of current density over the junction or current filaments lead to current crowding localised hot spots, which may evolve to a thermal runaway. * Reverse bias. Some semiconductor devices are diode junction-based and are nominally rectifiers; however, the reverse-breakdown mode may be at a very low voltage, with a moderate reverse bias voltage causing immediate degradation and vastly accelerated failure. 5 V is a maximum reverse-bias voltage for typical LEDs, with some types having lower figures. * Severely overloaded Zener diodes in reverse bias shorting. A sufficiently high voltage causes avalanche breakdown of the Zener junction; that and a large current being passed through the diode causes extreme localised heating, melting the junction and metallisation and forming a silicon-aluminium alloy that shorts the terminals. This is sometimes intentionally used as a method of hardwiring connections via fuses. * Latchups (when the device is subjected to an over- or undervoltage pulse); a parasitic structure acting as a triggered SCR then may cause an overcurrent-based failure. In ICs, latchups are classified as internal (like transmission line reflections and ground bounces) or external (like signals introduced via I/O pins and cosmic rays); external latchups can be triggered by an electrostatic discharge while internal latchups cannot. Latchups can be triggered by charge carriers injected into chip substrate or another latchup; the JEDEC78 standard tests susceptibility to latchups. =Electrostatic discharge= Electrostatic discharge (ESD) is a subclass of electrical overstress and may cause immediate device failure, permanent parameter shifts and latent damage causing increased degradation rate. It has at least one of three components, localized heat generation, high current density and high electric field gradient; prolonged presence of currents of several amperes transfer energy to the device structure to cause damage. ESD in real circuits causes a damped wave with rapidly alternating polarity, the junctions stressed in the same manner; it has four basic mechanisms: * Oxide breakdown occurring at field strengths above 6‚Äì10 MV/cm. * Junction damage manifesting as reverse-bias leakage increases to the point of shorting. * Metallisation and polysilicon burnout, where damage is limited to metal and polysilicon interconnects, thin film resistors and diffused resistors. * Charge injection, where hot carriers generated by avalanche breakdown are injected into the oxide layer. Catastrophic ESD failure modes include: * Junction burnout, where a conductive path forms through the junction and shorts it * Metallisation burnout, where melting or vaporizing of a part of the metal interconnect interrupts it * Oxide punch-through, formation of a conductive path through the insulating layer between two conductors or semiconductors; the gate oxides are thinnest and therefore most sensitive. The damaged transistor shows a low-ohmic junction between gate and drain terminals. A parametric failure only shifts the device parameters and may manifest in stress testing; sometimes, the degree of damage can lower over time. Latent ESD failure modes occur in a delayed fashion and include: * Insulator damage by weakening of the insulator structures. * Junction damage by lowering minority carrier lifetimes, increasing forward-bias resistance and increasing reverse-bias leakage. * Metallisation damage by conductor weakening. Catastrophic failures require the highest discharge voltages, are the easiest to test for and are rarest to occur. Parametric failures occur at intermediate discharge voltages and occur more often, with latent failures the most common. For each parametric failure, there are 4‚Äì10 latent ones. Modern VLSI circuits are more ESD-sensitive, with smaller features, lower capacitance and higher voltage-to-charge ratio. Silicon deposition of the conductive layers makes them more conductive, reducing the ballast resistance that has a protective role. The gate oxide of some MOSFETs can be damaged by 50 volts of potential, the gate isolated from the junction and potential accumulating on it causing extreme stress on the thin dielectric layer; stressed oxide can shatter and fail immediately. The gate oxide itself does not fail immediately but can be accelerated by stress induced leakage current, the oxide damage leading to a delayed failure after prolonged operation hours; on-chip capacitors using oxide or nitride dielectrics are also vulnerable. Smaller structures are more vulnerable because of their lower capacitance, meaning the same amount of charge carriers charges the capacitor to a higher voltage. All thin layers of dielectrics are vulnerable; hence, chips made by processes employing thicker oxide layers are less vulnerable. Current-induced failures are more common in bipolar junction devices, where Schottky and PN junctions are predominant. The high power of the discharge, above 5 kilowatts for less than a microsecond, can melt and vaporise materials. Thin-film resistors may have their value altered by a discharge path forming across them, or having part of the thin film vaporized; this can be problematic in precision applications where such values are critical. Newer CMOS output buffers using lightly doped silicide drains are more ESD sensitive; the N-channel driver usually suffers damage in the oxide layer or n+/p well junction. This is caused by current crowding during the snapback of the parasitic NPN transistor. In P/NMOS totem-pole structures, the NMOS transistor is almost always the one damaged. The structure of the junction influences its ESD sensitivity; corners and defects can lead to current crowding, reducing the damage threshold. Forward-biased junctions are less sensitive than reverse- biased ones because the Joule heat of forward-biased junctions is dissipated through a thicker layer of the material, as compared to the narrow depletion region in reverse-biased junction. Passive element failures=Resistors A resistor removed from a high voltage tube circuit shows damage from voltaic arcing on the resistive metal oxide layer. Resistors can fail open or short, alongside their value changing under environmental conditions and outside performance limits. Examples of resistor failures include: * Manufacturing defects causing intermittent problems. For example, improperly crimped caps on carbon or metal resistors can loosen and lose contact, and the resistor-to-cap resistance can change the values of the resistor * Surface-mount resistors delaminating where dissimilar materials join, like between the ceramic substrate and the resistive layer. * Nichrome thin-film resistors in integrated circuits attacked by phosphorus from the passivation glass, corroding them and increasing their resistance. * SMD resistors with silver metallization of contacts suffering open-circuit failure in a sulfur-rich environment, due to buildup of silver sulfide. * Copper dendrites growing from Copper(II) oxide present in some materials (like the layer facilitating adhesion of metallization to a ceramic substrate) and bridging the trimming kerf slot. =Potentiometers and trimmers= Potentiometers and trimmers are three-terminal electromechanical parts, containing a resistive path with an adjustable wiper contact. Along with the failure modes for normal resistors, mechanical wear on the wiper and the resistive layer, corrosion, surface contamination, and mechanical deformations may lead to intermittent path-wiper resistance changes, which are a problem with audio amplifiers. Many types are not perfectly sealed, with contaminants and moisture entering the part; an especially common contaminant is the solder flux. Mechanical deformations (like an impaired wiper-path contact) can occur by housing warpage during soldering or mechanical stress during mounting. Excess stress on leads can cause substrate cracking and open failure when the crack penetrates the resistive path. Capacitors Capacitors are characterized by their capacitance, parasitic resistance in series and parallel, breakdown voltage and dissipation factor; both parasitic parameters are often frequency- and voltage-dependent. Structurally, capacitors consist of electrodes separated by a dielectric, connecting leads, and housing; deterioration of any of these may cause parameter shifts or failure. Shorted failures and leakage due to increase of parallel parasitic resistance are the most common failure modes of capacitors, followed by open failures. Some examples of capacitor failures include: * Dielectric breakdown due to overvoltage or aging of the dielectric, occurring when breakdown voltage falls below operating voltage. Some types of capacitors \\"self-heal\\", as internal arcing vaporizes parts of the electrodes around the failed spot. Others form a conductive pathway through the dielectric, leading to shorting or partial loss of dielectric resistance. * Electrode materials migrating across the dielectric, forming conductive paths. * Leads separated from the capacitor by rough handling during storage, assembly or operation, leading to an open failure. The failure can occur invisibly inside the packaging and is measurable. * Increase of dissipation factor due to contamination of capacitor materials, particularly from flux and solvent residues. =Electrolytic capacitors= In addition to the problems listed above, electrolytic capacitors suffer from these failures: * Aluminium versions having their electrolyte dry out for a gradual leakage, equivalent series resistance and loss of capacitance. Power dissipation by high ripple currents and internal resistances cause an increase of the capacitor's internal temperature beyond specifications, accelerating the deterioration rate; such capacitors usually fail short. * Electrolyte contamination (like from moisture) corroding the electrodes, leading to capacitance loss and shorts. * Electrolytes evolving a gas, increasing pressure inside the capacitor housing and sometimes causing an explosion; an example is the capacitor plague. * Tantalum versions being electrically overstressed, permanently degrading the dielectric and sometimes causing open or short failure. Sites that have failed this way are usually visible as a discolored dielectric or as a locally melted anode. Metal oxide varistors Metal oxide varistors typically have lower resistance as they heat up; if connected directly across a power bus, for protection against electrical transients, a varistor with a lowered trigger voltage can slide into catastrophic thermal runaway and sometimes a small explosion or fire. To prevent this, the fault current is typically limited by a thermal fuse, circuit breaker, or other current limiting device. MEMS failures Microelectromechanical systems suffer from various types of failures: * Stiction causing moving parts to stick; an external impulse sometimes restores functionality. Non-stick coatings, reduction of contact area, and increased awareness mitigate the problem in contemporary systems. * Particles migrating in the system and blocking their movements. Conductive particles may short out circuits like electrostatic actuators. Wear damages the surfaces and releases debris that can be a source of particle contamination. * Fractures causing loss of mechanical parts. * Material fatigue inducing cracks in moving structures. * Dielectric charging leading to change of functionality and at some point parameter failures. Recreating failure modes In order to reduce failures, a precise knowledge of bond strength quality measurement during product design and subsequent manufacture is of vital importance. The best place to start is with the failure mode. This is based on the assumption that there is a particular failure mode, or range of modes, that may occur within a product. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the bond test should replicate the mode, or modes of interest. However, exact replication is not always possible. The test load must be applied to some part of the sample and transferred through the sample to the bond. If this part of the sample is the only option and is weaker than the bond itself, the sample will fail before the bond.

Resolution 1295 was adopted in the aftermath of the Fowler Report, which detailed how countries worldwide were violating sanctions against UNITA. Resolution=Observations The Security Council expressed its alarm at the continuing civil war in Angola and its impact on the civilian population. It reiterated that the primary cause of the crisis in Angola was the failure of UNITA, under the leadership of Jonas Savimbi, to comply with obligations under the , Lusaka Protocol and relevant Security Council resolutions. In this regard, it demanded that UNITA immediately and unconditionally complete the demilitarisation of its forces and co-operate in the extension of state authority throughout Angola. The Council noted that the measures against UNITA were intended to promote a political settlement of the conflict by restricting its ability to achieve goals through military means. There were violations of the measures relating to the provisions of arms and related materiel, petroleum and petroleum products, diamonds, funds and financial assets and travel and representation against UNITA. The preamble of the resolution also expressed concern at the provision of military assistance to UNITA and presence of foreign mercenaries. It welcomed decisions by the Chairman of the Committee established in Resolution 864 to improve the effectiveness of the sanctions, and of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and Southern African Development Community (SADC) supporting measures against UNITA. Acts The resolution, proposed by Canada, was divided into several sections concerning different aspects of the measures against UNITA. =Violation of sanctions against UNITA= Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council stressed the importance of all states complying with measures imposed against UNITA in previous Security Council resolutions. The Secretary-General Kofi Annan was required to establish a monitoring mechanism consisting of up to five experts to investigate alleged violations of the sanctions against UNITA for a period of six months. They were instructed to provide a report on their findings by 18 October 2000 with a view to improving the measures. The Council would then, upon the receipt of the report, consider ways of improving the sanctions and action under the United Nations Charter for states involved in the violation of the measures. =Trade in arms= All countries were urged to be vigilant so as to avoid the transfer of weapons to unauthorised users or destinations and were encouraged to ensure effective monitoring in this regard. Countries were also invited to consider to convene conferences with states where weapons were manufactured or exported for the purposes of ending illicit flows of weapons into Angola. Representatives from SADC were invited to participate. =Trade in petroleum and petroleum products= The convening of a conference on methods of curbing the illegal supply of petroleum or petroleum products into Angola was encouraged by the Council, such as monitoring of supplies of oil in the area and the role of SADC in this process. SADC was invited to monitor the border areas with Angola counter arms smuggling and was asked to take the lead against the illegal fuel supplies to UNITA. =Trade in diamonds= The Council was concerned that the trade in diamonds was a major source of funding for UNITA. Diamond trading countries were asked to impose severe penalties for possession of diamonds in violation of Resolution 1173. Belgium had announced steps in that direction and it was called upon to restrict UNITA's access to the diamond market and other countries were asked to adopt similar measures. =Funds and financial measures= Countries were encouraged to hold a conference on ways to strengthen the implementation of the financial measures imposed against UNITA. They were asked to work with financial institutions on their territory to identify funds and assets and the freezing of such funds. =Travel and representation= It was important that all countries continued with travel bans against UNITA officials and their families, and to withdraw travel documents to those residing in their territory. The Committee and Government of Angola was asked to update the list of such persons subject to travel restrictions. =Additional steps= SADC countries were asked to consider additional measures for air traffic in the region for detecting illegal flight activities across borders and were invited to co-operate with the International Civil Aviation Organization in this respect. The resolution called upon countries near Angola to enact domestic legislation making it a criminal offence to violate measures against UNITA imposed by the Security Council. The Secretary-General was invited to strengthen co-operation between the United Nations and regional and subregional organisations, including Interpol to monitor and enforce the sanctions. The Council welcomed international support for the measures against UNITA and underlined the important role that SADC would play in the implementation of the sanctions.

All seven crew members on board the BAC One-Eleven were killed. Accident The accident occurred during a test flight of the first prototype BAC One-Eleven (registration G-ASHG) which had taken off from Wisley Airfield with seven crew on board, piloted by Mike Lithgow. The aircraft was on its fifth test flight to assess stability and handling characteristics during the approach to-and recovery from-a stall with the centre of gravity in varying positions. From an altitude of and with the flaps extended 8¬∞, the aircraft entered a stable stall with it descending at a high rate in a horizontal attitude, eventually striking the ground with very little forward speed. The aircraft broke up on impact at Cratt Hill, near Chicklade, a small village in southern Wiltshire and caught fire, killing all seven crew on board. The aircraft was on its fifth stalling test of the day, and the crash occurred 23 minutes after takeoff from Wisley. The crew were Lt. Cdr. M J Lithgow OBE, Chief Test Pilot; Capt. R Rymer (Test Pilot); B J Prior (Aerodynamicist); C J Webb (Designer); R A F Wright (Senior Observer); G R Poulter (Observer) and D J Clark (Observer). Cause The cause of the accident was the aircraft entering a stable stalled condition, recovery from which was impossible due to the wings blocking the airflow over the elevators on the tail. This was the first accident to be attributed to the phenomenon known as deep stall, peculiar to rear engine T-tailed aircraft.Report on the Accident to B.A.C. One-Eleven G-ASHG at Cratt Hill, near Chicklade, Wiltshire on 22nd October 1963, Ministry of Aviation C.A.P. 219, 1965 Aftermath Once the condition of deep stall was recognized, relatively simple preventative measures were introduced, including stick-shakers indicating an approaching stall and stick-pushers which automatically operate the elevators and physically lower the nose before the stall is reached, while the tailplane and pitch controls are still effective. Memorial In October 2013 a stone memorial was dedicated at the crash site, listing the seven victims. The ceremony was attended by the CO of the Royal Navy Historic Flight; Lord Margadale (the owner of the land); and families of the crew members.Chris von Patzelt, 'BAC ONE-ELEVEN G-ASHG REMEMBERED', Hindon and Chicklade Parish magazine, December 2013, p. 4.

The series starred Vincent Zhao, Max Mok, Kristy Yang and Yang Ruoxi in the lead roles. Plot Wentian and Wanxin are the sons of the Jianwen Emperor of the Ming dynasty. They were separated at birth when the emperor's uncle, Zhu Di, launched a coup to seize the throne from his nephew. The emperor forced Wentian and Wanxin to consume the magical Water and Fire orbs respectively and ordered his bodyguards to bring the infant princes out of the palace before he disappeared mysteriously. In the midst of the chaos, Wanxin was taken away by the eunuch Chu Tianxing, who serves Zhu Di, while Wentian was delivered to safety by the bodyguards. Wentian was raised by Mi Jiutou, one of the bodyguards, and he grows up to become a gregarious martial artist who values friendship and righteousness. On the other hand, Wanxin, who was raised as Chu Tianxing's godson, develops a cruel, cold and power-hungry personality under the influence of his evil godfather. The orbs in their bodies often cause them to experience strange fits of agony ‚Äî Wentian suffers from chills while Wanxin feels like he is on fire. However, their prowess in inner energy have also increased due to the power of the orbs. Wentian and Wanxin meet each other by coincidence and strike up a friendship, becoming sworn brothers in the process and without knowing each other's true identities. Both Wentian and Wanxin fall in love with Bai Yutong, a maiden from a wealthy family who disguises herself as \\"Golden Swallow\\", a bandit who robs the rich to help the poor. Xiaowan, Mi Jiutou's daughter, is also in love with Wentian. Their love relationships become more complicated. Wentian and Wanxin eventually realise that they are actually brothers. In a dramatic twist of events, Wanxin is castrated on his godfather's order. He becomes emotionally scarred and gradually becomes consumed by his darker personality. After Chu Tianxing is killed by an enemy, Wanxin takes over his godfather's place and follows in the latter's brutal and ruthless ways. Meanwhile, Wentian masters a set of martial arts, based on different styles of Drunken Fist, with each style named after a type of alcoholic drink. The warm effect of alcohol helps him to suppress the cool energy from the Water Orb, relieving him of his agony. He roams the jianghu as a youxia to uphold justice and help the poor with his new skills, earning himself the nickname of \\"Drunken Hero\\".

Maynard served as a cabinet minister under Premiers William Aberhart and Ernest Manning in various portfolios from 1936 to 1955. Political career Maynard first ran for a seat in the Alberta Legislature in the 1935 general election. He contested the Beaver River electoral district under the Social Credit banner and defeated three other candidates, including incumbent Henry Dakin and former MLA John Delisle. Premier William Aberhart appointed him to the Executive Council of Alberta as a Minister without portfolio on May 12, 1936. Less than a year later, on January 20, 1937, Aberhart promoted Maynard to Minister of Municipal Affairs. On June 1, 1943, Ernest Manning, who had recently succeeded Aberhart as premier, promoted Maynard to Attorney General. He remained in that portfolio until his defeat in his home riding of St. Albert in the 1955 general election at the hands of Liberal candidate Arthur Soetaert. Maynard's defeat left the Social Credit government without any lawyers in caucus; Premier Ernest Manning then took the post of Attorney General himself. In 1962 Maynard attempted a return to politics by running in the electoral district of Edmonton East for the federal Social Credit party in that year's federal election. He finished a distant second to Progressive Conservative incumbent William Skoreyko. Maynard ran against Skoreyko again in the 1963 election, but fared even more poorly, finishing a distant third. Many years later, in 1985, Maynard ran as an independent in a provincial by- election in the Edmonton-Whitemud electoral district. He finished in fifth place out of six candidates, losing to Premier Don Getty.

Travers was educated at Tonbridge School, entered the Royal College of Art in 1904, and took his Diploma in Architecture in 1908. At the RCA he studied architecture under Arthur Beresford Pite and stained glass under Christopher Whall. He worked for a time until 1911 as an assistant to Ninian Comper. Travers was perhaps the most influential British stained glass artist in the second quarter of the twentieth century. From 1919 until 1926 he rented a studio at Lowndes & Drury's The Glass House, Fulham. Lowndes & Drury continued to cut, fire, glaze and fix his windows after he established his own studio. Travers was awarded the Grand Prix for stained glass at the International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts (French: Exposition internationale des Arts d√©coratifs et industriels modernes) in Paris in 1925. That same year he succeeded Christopher Whall, who died in 1924, as chief instructor in stained glass at the Royal College of Art: a position he held until his death. Martin Travers was an original, versatile, modern interpreter of earlier artistic styles, and his windows were designed and made with a particular sensitivity to their architectural setting. Fine five-light and tracery east windows can be seen at St Andrew's, Catford, 1921 ‚Äì still showing the marked influence of Christopher Whall ‚Äì and St George's, Headstone, Harrow, 1937, in his mature, refined style. Travers' name is often connected with the Anglo-Catholic movement in the Church of England, especially that part of the movement which favoured a continental Baroque style of church furnishing. In the 1920s he designed and constructed a number of spectacular Baroque reredos for various Anglican churches, often employing affordable materials such as plywood, whitewood, papier mache, embossed wallpaper, and tinted varnished foil to achieve the desired effect; which has meant that some of this work has not weathered well. Notable examples of his furnishings in central London are the re-fashioned reredos in St Mary's, Bourne Street, Pimlico, c. 1920, and the remarkable Churrigueresque altarpiece in St Augustine's, Queen's Gate, South Kensington, 1927. After his involvement at the International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts ‚Äì which gave rise to the term Art Deco ‚Äì much of Travers' furnishing output had an Art Deco flavour. As a graphic artist he is best known for his illustrations for the booklets and cards published by the Society of SS. Peter and Paul. Travers' chief assistants were Joseph E Nuttgens (glass-painting, c 1920‚Äì1922), Francis Spear (glass painting, 1922-24), John E Crawford (glass- painting, sculpting, carving and decorating furnishings, some designing, 1924‚Äì1948) and Lawrence Lee (glass-painting, 1946‚Äì1948).

Biography  Petr Zenkl was born as the eighth son of a small businessman, originally a tailor, in the South Bohemian town of T√°bor. All of the children helped their father in his business and strived to earn money. The father was Czech patriot, thus the children joined the Sokol movement.

From 1911 Zenkl was active in local politics in Prague, more precisely in Karl√≠n, which was until 1921 an independent town before its incorporation to Prague. In 1911 he became a member of the Karl√≠n town council, and in 1919 became a mayor of Karl√≠n. He lost his position when Karl√≠n was incorporated into Prague in 1921-1922.

Registration card of Petr Zenkl as a prisoner at Dachau Nazi Concentration Camp Shortly after the Nazi German occupation of Prague (March 1939) Zenkl was arrested and jailed in the Pankr√°c Prison. From there he was transported to the Dachau concentration camp and, after three weeks, to the Buchenwald concentration camp, where he was liberated together with other inmates by the army of U.S. General George S. Patton. Zenkl is mentioned in Edward R Murrow's report of Buchenwald on 11 April 1945, when a man turned to him in a barracks and said \\"You remember me, I am Peter Zenkl, onetime mayor of Prague\\". The two had indeed met before, but given such harsh treatment as Zenkl had endured, he was unrecognizable.Radio broadcast by Edward R Murrow With American military help, he was able to fly through Frankfurt am Main and Paris to London, where he learned that his place as Mayor of Prague had been taken by the communist V√°clav Vacek. He was also informed that he had been elected chairman of his Czechoslovak National Social Party by the Revolutionary Committee of the party. He took over his position as a mayor in August 1945, replacing Vacek, and fulfilled his duties until May 1946, when elections took place and V√°clav Vacek was installed to the office again. After the elections, as a chairman of the second strongest party (after the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia) he became the Deputy Prime Minister of the Czechoslovak government in May 1946. In September 1947 Zenkl, together with minister Jan Masaryk and fellow National Socialist minister of justice Prokop Drtina, were victims of communist-orchestrated intimidation, when they received boxes containing explosives.LeCaine Agnew 2004, 229. In February 1948 Zenkl resigned, together with other non-communist government ministers, to convince the communist Minister of Interior V√°clav Nosek to cancel unconstitutional measures, which Nosek instituted during his ministry.Milena ≈†tr√°feldov√°: ƒåe≈°i v zahraniƒç√≠ at the Czech Radio After the communist coup d'√©tat of 1948 Zenkl was under constant surveillance by the communist State Security apparatus. He managed, however, to escape with his wife to the West in August 1948. In subsequent years he became the head of the Czechoslovak political exile movement. In 1949-1974 he was a chairman of the exile Council of Free Czechoslovakia, based in Washington, D.C.. After the fall of communism in 1989, his remains were transferred from the United States to the Vy≈°ehrad Cemetery in Prague.

Negative has been contrast enhanced. The historical records for the Shroud of Turin can be separated into two time periods: before 1390 and from 1390 to the present. The period until 1390 is subject to debate and controversy among historians. Prior to the 14th century there are some allegedly congruent but controversial references such as the Pray Codex. It is often mentioned that the first certain historical record dates from 1353 or 1357.William Meacham, The Authentication of the Turin Shroud, An Issue in Archeological Epistemogy, Current Anthropology, 24, 3, 1983 ArticleBBC article 31 January 2005 However the presence of the Turin Shroud in Lirey, France, is only undoubtedly attested in 1390 when Bishop Pierre d'Arcis wrote a memorandum where he charged that the Shroud was a forgery.Emmanuel Poulle, ‚Ä≥Les sources de l'histoire du linceul de Turin. Revue critique‚Ä≥, Revue d'Histoire Eccl√©siastique, 2009/3-4, p. 776.Abstract The history from the 15th century to the present is well documented. In 1453 Margaret de Charny deeded the Shroud to the House of Savoy. As of the 17th century the shroud has been displayed (e.g. in the chapel built for that purpose by Guarino GuariniArchitecture for the shroud: relic and ritual in Turin by John Beldon Scott 2003 page xxi) and in the 19th century it was first photographed during a public exhibition. There are little definite historical records concerning the shroud prior to the 14th century. Although there are numerous reports of Jesus' burial shroud, or an image of his head, of unknown origin, being venerated in various locations before the 14th century, there is little but reliable historical evidence that these refer to the shroud currently at Turin Cathedral.Humber, Thomas: The Sacred Shroud. New York: Pocket Books, 1980. A burial cloth, which some historians maintain was the Shroud, was owned by the Byzantine emperors but disappeared during the Sack of Constantinople in 1204.Emmanuel Poulle, ‚Ä≥Les sources de l'histoire du linceul de Turin. Revue critique‚Ä≥, Revue d'Histoire Eccl√©siastique, 2009/3-4, pp. 747‚Äì781.Abstract Barbara Frale has cited that the Order of Knights Templar were in the possession of a relic showing a red, monochromatic image of a bearded man on linen or cotton.Barbara Frale, The Templars and The Shroud of Christ, page 99 (Maverick House, 2011; ), Frale citing Charles Du Fresne, Glossarium Mediae et Infimae Latinitatis, page 447 (Graz: Akademische Druck- u. Verlagsanstalt, 1954). Historical records seem to indicate that a shroud bearing an image of a crucified man existed in the possession of Geoffroy de Charny in the small town of Lirey, France around the years 1353 to 1357. However, the correspondence of this shroud with the shroud in Turin, and its very origin has been debated by scholars and lay authors, with claims of forgery attributed to artists born a century apart. Some contend that the Lirey shroud was the work of a confessed forger and murderer.Mercer dictionary of the Bible by Watson E. Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard 1998 page 822 Professor Nicholas Allen of South Africa on the other hand believes that the image was made photographically and not by an artist. Professor John Jackson of the Turin Shroud Centre of Colorado argues that the shroud in Turin dates back to the 1st century AD.BBC News March 21, 2008 Shroud mystery refuses to go away The history of the shroud from the 15th century is well recorded. In 1532, the shroud suffered damage from a fire in the chapel where it was stored. A drop of molten silver from the reliquary produced a symmetrically placed mark through the layers of the folded cloth. Poor Clare Nuns attempted to repair this damage with patches. In 1578 the House of Savoy took the shroud to Turin and it has remained at Turin Cathedral ever since.The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia:Q-Z by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1995 page 495 Repairs were made to the shroud in 1694 by Sebastian Valfr√® to improve the repairs of the Poor Clare nuns.Architecture for the shroud: relic and ritual in Turin by John Beldon Scott 2003 page 26 Further repairs were made in 1868 by Clotilde of Savoy.Holy Shroud of Turin by Arthur Stapylton Barnes 2003 page 62 The shroud remained the property of the House of Savoy until 1983, when it was given to the Holy See, the rule of the House of Savoy having ended in 1946. A fire, possibly caused by arson, threatened the shroud on 11 April 1997.NY Times April 12, 1997 Shroud of Turin Saved From Fire in Cathedral In 2002, the Holy See had the shroud restored. The cloth backing and thirty patches were removed, making it possible to photograph and scan the reverse side of the cloth, which had been hidden from view for centuries. The Shroud was exhibited to the public from August 8 to August 12, 2018. Prior to the 14th century This 10th-century image shows Abgarus of Edessa displaying the Image of Edessa. The oblong cloth shown here is unusual for depictions of the image, leading some to suggest that the artist was influenced by seeing the Shroud. The Gospel of the Hebrews, a 2nd-century manuscript extant in about 20 lines states 'and after He had given the linen cloth to the servant of the priest he appeared to James' Although there are numerous reports of Jesus' burial shroud, or an image of his head, of unknown origin, being venerated in various locations before the fourteenth century, there is no historical evidence that these refer to the shroud currently at Turin Cathedral. The Gospel of John states that: \\"Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes [othonia] lie, and the napkin [soudarion], that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself\\" (John 20:6‚Äì7, KJV). The Gospels of Matthew (27:59), Mark (15:46), and Luke (23:53) all refer to a singular \\"sindon\\" (fine linen cloth) which was wrapped (entulisso) around Jesus' body. In other Greek usage the word \\"sindon\\" refers to a wrapping such as a toga (Mark 14:51‚Äì52) or a mummy wrapping (Herodotus 2, 86). The Image of Edessa was reported to contain the image of the face of Jesus, and its existence is reported since the sixth century. Some have suggested a connection between the Shroud of Turin and the Image of Edessa.Wilson, pp. 148‚Äì175 No legend connected with that image suggests that it contained the image of a beaten and bloody Jesus. It was said to be an image transferred by Jesus to the cloth in life. This image is generally described as depicting only the face of Jesus, not the entire body. Proponents of the theory that the Edessa image was actually the shroud, led by Ian Wilson, theorize that it was always folded in such a way as to show only the face, as recorded in the apocryphical Acts of Thaddeus from around that time, which say it was tradiplon ‚Äì folded into four pieces.Andrzej Datko: The Book of Relics; chapter: The Shroud of Turin, p.351. Cracow, 2014 Ian Wilson, under 'Reconstructed Chronology of the Turin Shroud'p287 Ian Wilson, 1978, The Turin Shroud, Penguin Books (1979) first published by Doubleday & Company Inc., (1978) Under the title The Shroud of Turin recounts that the 'Doctrine of Addai' mentions a 'mysterious portrait' in connection with the healing of Abgar V. A similar story is recorded in Eusebius' History of the Church bk 1, ch 13,Trans. G A Williamson, Ed Andrew Louth, Eusebius, The History of the Church, Penguin Books which does not mention the portrait. Three principal pieces of evidence are cited in favor of the identification with the shroud. Saint John of Damascus mentions the image in his anti-iconoclastic work On Holy Images, describing the Edessa image as being a \\"strip\\", or oblong cloth, rather than a square, as other accounts of the Edessa cloth hold. However, in his description, St. John still speaks of the image of Jesus' face when he was alive. In several articles, Daniel Scavone, professor Emeritus of history at the University of southern Indiana, puts forward a hypothesis which identifies the Shroud of Turin as the real object that inspires the romances of the Holy Grail.D. Scavone: \\"Joseph of Arimathea, the Holy Grail, and the Edessa Icon,\\" Arthuriana vol. 9, no. 4, 3‚Äì31 (Winter 1999) (Article and abstract) ;Scavone, ‚ÄúBritish King Lucius, the Grail, and Joseph of Arimathea: The Question of Byzantine Origins.‚Äù, Publications of the Medieval Association of the Midwest 10 (2003): 101‚Äì42, vol. 10, 101‚Äì142 (2003). To the contrary, Averil Cameron, expert of Late Antique and Byzantine History at the University of Oxford, denies the possibility of the Turin shroud being identified with the Image of Edessa. Among the reasons are too big differences in the historical descriptions of the Image of Edessa compared to the shroud.Averil Cameron, The Sceptic and the Shroud London: King's College Inaugural Lecture monograph (1980) The Image of Edessa has according to her its origin in the resistance to the Byzantine iconoclasm.Averil Cameron, The mandylion and Byzantine Iconoclasm. in H. Kessler, G. Wolf, eds, The holy face and the paradox of representation. Bologna, (1998), 33‚Äì54 The surrender of the Image of Edessa to the Byzantine parakoimomenos Theophanes by the Edessenes, from the Madrid Skylitzes. On the occasion of the transfer of the cloth to Constantinople in 944, Gregory Referendarius, archdeacon of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, preached a sermon about the artifact. This sermon had been lost but was rediscovered in the Vatican Archives and translated by Mark Guscin in 2004. This sermon says that this Edessa cloth contained not only the face, but a full-length image, which was believed to be of Jesus. The sermon also mentions bloodstains from a wound in the side. Other documents have since been found in the Vatican library and the University of Leiden, Netherlands, confirming this impression. \\"Non tantum faciei figuram sed totius corporis figuram cernere poteris\\" (You can see not only the figure of a face, but [also] the figure of the whole body). (In Italian) (Cf. Codex Vossianus Latinus Q69 and Vatican Library Codex 5696, p. 35.) The Pray Codex. Shroud proponents cite it as evidence for the shroud's existence before the fourteenth century, citing an L-shaped patch near the hands, which would correspond to four burn holes in the relic. Also, the weave of the cloth in the lower panel suggests to them the unusual weave of the shroud. Critics point out that there is no evidence that the rectangle is a shroud rather than a tombstone, that the holes are not just decorative elements, and that there is no image on the alleged shroud. An illustration of what appears to some to be the Shroud of Turin complete with the distinctive \\"L-shaped\\" burn marks and what is interpreted by some to be fishbone weave is depicted in Codex Pray, an Illuminated manuscript written in Budapest, Hungary between 1192 and 1195.Wilson, Ian.(1986)The Mysterious Shroud, Garden city, New York; Doubleday & Company. p.115Bercovits, I. (1969) Dublin: Irish University Press. Illuminated Manuscripts in Hungary In the Budapest National Library is the Pray Manuscript, the oldest surviving text of the Hungarian language. It was written between 1192 and 1195 (65 years before the earliest carbon-14 date in the 1988 tests). One of its illustrations shows preparations for the burial of Christ. The picture supposedly includes a burial cloth in the post-resurrection scene. According to proponents, it has the same herringbone weave as the Shroud, plus four holes near one of the edges. The holes form an \\"L\\" shape. Proponents claim this odd pattern of holes is the same as the ones found on the Shroud of Turin. They are burn holes, perhaps from a hot poker or incense embers.Wilson, I., \\"The Evidence of the Shroud\\", Guild Publishing: London, 1986, p.114 and http://www.newgeology.us/presentation24.html On the other hand, Italian Shroud researcher Gian Marco Rinaldi interprets the item that is sometimes identified as the Shroud as a probable rectangular tombstone as seen on other sacred images, alleged holes as decorative elements, as seen, for example, on the angel's wing and clothes. Rinaldi also points out that the alleged shroud in the Pray codex does not contain any image.G.M.Rinaldi, \\"Il Codice Pray\\", http://sindone.weebly.com/pray.html Furthermore, it would be most unlikely that anyone who had seen the Shroud would have shown Christ being buried without any sign of the wounds that are so graphically shown on the Shroud. In 1204, a knight named Robert de Clari who participated in the Fourth Crusade that captured Constantinople, claims the cloth was among the countless relics in the city: \\"Where there was the Shroud in which our Lord had been wrapped, which every Friday raised itself upright so one could see the figure of our Lord on it. And none knows ‚Äì neither Greek nor Frank ‚Äì what became of that shroud when the city was taken.\\"Robert de Clari, The History Of Them That Took Constantinople, chapter 92 , in Edward N. Stone, Three Old French Chronicles of the Crusades (University of Washington Publications in the Social Sciences, volume 10; 1939). (The apparent miracle of the cloth raising itself may be accounted for as a mistranslation: the French impersonal passive takes the form of a reflexive verb. Thus the original French could equally well be translated as the cloth was raised upright. De Clari's matter of fact delivery does not suggest that he witnessed anything out of the ordinary.) However, the historians Madden and Queller describe this part of Robert's account as a mistake: Robert had actually seen or heard of the sudarium, the handkerchief of Saint Veronica (which also purportedly contained the image of Jesus), and confused it with the grave cloth (sindon).Madden, Thomas, and Donald Queller. The Fourth Crusade: The Conquest of Constantinople. University of Pennsylvania Press, 1997. Second edition. page 139. In 1205, the following letter was allegedly sent by Theodore Angelos, a brother of Michael I Komnenos Doukas, to Pope Innocent III protesting the attack on the capital. From the document, dated 1 August 1205 in Rome: \\"The Venetians partitioned the treasures of gold, silver, and ivory while the French did the same with the relics of the saints and the most sacred of all, the linen in which our Lord Jesus Christ was wrapped after his death and before the resurrection. We know that the sacred objects are preserved by their predators in Venice, in France, and in other places, the sacred linen in Athens.\\" (Codex Chartularium Culisanense, fol. CXXVI (copia), Bilioteca del Santuario di Montevergine)\\"The letter was rediscovered in the archive of the Abbey of St. Caterina a Formiello, Naples; it was folio CXXVI of the Chartularium Culisanense, now destroyed, a copy of which came to the Naples as a result of close political ties with the imperial Angelus-Comnenus family from 1481 on. The Greek original had been lost.\\" in: ; see also: a photo of the document According to Emmanuel Poulle, a French medievalist, although the Mandylion is not the Shroud of Turin, the texts \\"attest the presence of the Shroud in Constantinople before 1204\\". But it was claimed that the letter of Theodore and other documents contained in the Chartularium are a modern forgery.A. Nicolotti, , in ¬´Giornale di storia¬ª 8 (2012). Unless it is the Shroud of Turin, then the location of the Image of Edessa since the 13th century is unknown but may well have been among the relics sold to Louis IX and housed in the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris until lost in the French Revolution. Some authors suggest that the shroud was captured by the knight Otto de la Roche who became Duke of Athens, sometimes adding that he soon relinquished it to the Knights Templar. It was subsequently taken to France, where the first known keeper of the Turin Shroud had links both to the Templars as well the descendants of Otto. Some speculate that the shroud could have been a major part of the famed \\"Templar treasure\\" that treasure hunters still seek today. The association with the Templars seems to be based on a coincidence of family names; the Templars were a celibate order and so unlikely to have children after entering the Order. 14th and 15th centuries The fullest academic account of the history of the Shroud since its first appearance in 1355 is John Beldon-Scott, Architecture for the Shroud: Relic and Ritual in Turin, University of Chicago Press, 2003. This study is indispensable for its many illustrations that show features of the Shroud images now lost. The pilgrim medallion of Lirey (Drawing by Arthur Forgeais, 1865) The 14th century attribution of the origin of the shroud refers to a shroud in Lirey, France dating to 1353‚Äì1357. It is related that the widow of the French knight Geoffroi de Charny had it displayed in a church at Lirey, France (diocese of Troyes). According to the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia: > On 20 June 1353, Geoffroy de Charny, Lord of Savoisy and Lirey, founded at > Lirey in honour of the Annunciation a collegiate church with six canonries, > and in this church he exposed for veneration the Holy Winding Sheet. > Opposition arose on the part of the Bishop of Troyes, who declared after due > inquiry that the relic was nothing but a painting, and opposed its > exposition. Clement VI by four Bulls, 6 Jan., 1390, approved the exposition > as lawful. In 1418 during the civil wars, the canons entrusted the Winding > Sheet to Humbert, Count de La Roche, Lord of Lirey. Margaret, widow of > Humbert, never returned it but gave it in 1452 to the Duke of Savoy. The > requests of the canons of Lirey were unavailing, and the Lirey Winding Sheet > is the same that is now exposed and honoured at Turin.\\" In the Museum Cluny in Paris, the coats of arms of this knight and his widow can be seen on a pilgrim medallion, which also shows an image of the Shroud of Turin. During the fourteenth century, the shroud was often publicly exposed, though not continuously, because the bishop of Troyes, Henri de Poitiers, had prohibited veneration of the image. Thirty-two years after this pronouncement, the image was displayed again, and King Charles VI of France ordered its removal to Troyes, citing the impropriety of the image. The sheriffs were unable to carry out the order. Full-length image of the Shroud of Turin In 1389, the image was denounced as a fraud by Bishop Pierre D'Arcis in a letter to the Avignon Antipope Clement VII, mentioning that the image had previously been denounced by his predecessor Henri de Poitiers, who had been concerned that no such image was mentioned in scripture. Bishop D'Arcis continued, \\"Eventually, after diligent inquiry and examination, he discovered how the said cloth had been cunningly painted, the truth being attested by the artist who had painted it, to wit, that it was a work of human skill and not miraculously wrought or bestowed.\\" (In German:.) The artist is not named in the letter.English translation of Memorandum contained in Ian Wilson, The Turin Shroud, p. 230-235 (Victor Gollancz Ltd; 1978 )Joe Nickell, Inquest on the Shroud of Turin: Latest Scientific Findings, Prometheus Books, 1998, The letter of Bishop D'Arcis also mentions Bishop Henri's attempt to suppress veneration but notes that the cloth was quickly hidden \\"for 35 years or so\\", thus agreeing with the historical details already established above. The letter provides an accurate description of the cloth: \\"upon which by a clever sleight of hand was depicted the twofold image of one man, that is to say, the back and the front, he falsely declaring and pretending that this was the actual shroud in which our Saviour Jesus Christ was enfolded in the tomb, and upon which the whole likeness of the Saviour had remained thus impressed together with the wounds which He bore.\\" Despite the pronouncement of Bishop D'Arcis, Antipope Clement VII (first antipope of the Western Schism) did not revoke the permission given earlier to the church of Lirey to display the object,Emmanuel Poulle, \\"Le linceul de Turin victime d'Ulysse Chevalier [The Turin shroud victim of Ulysse Chevalier]\\", Revue d'Histoire de l'Eglise de France, t. 92, 2006, 343‚Äì358.

It was later moved to Saint-Hippolyte-sur-Doubs. After Humbert's death, canons of Lirey fought through the courts to force the widow to return the cloth, but the parliament of Dole and the Court of Besan√ßon left it to the widow, who traveled with the shroud to various expositions, notably in Li√®ge and Geneva. The widow sold the shroud in exchange for a castle in Varambon, France in 1453. The new owner, Anne of Cyprus, Duchess of Savoy, stored it in the Savoyard capital of Chamb√©ry in the newly built Saint- Chapelle, which Pope Paul II shortly thereafter raised to the dignity of a collegiate church. In 1464, Anne's husband, Louis, Duke of Savoy agreed to pay an annual fee to the Lirey canons in exchange for their dropping claims of ownership of the cloth. Beginning in 1471, the shroud was moved between many cities of Europe, being housed briefly in Vercelli, Turin, Ivrea, Susa, Chamb√©ry, Avigliana, Rivoli, and Pinerolo. A description of the cloth by two sacristans of the Sainte-Chapelle from around this time noted that it was stored in a reliquary: \\"enveloped in a red silk drape, and kept in a case covered with crimson velours, decorated with silver-gilt nails, and locked with a golden key.\\" In 1543 John Calvin, in his Treatise on Relics, wrote of the Shroud, which was then at Nice, \\"How is it possible that those sacred historians, who carefully related all the miracles that took place at Christ‚Äôs death, should have omitted to mention one so remarkable as the likeness of the body of our Lord remaining on its wrapping sheet?\\" He also noted that, according to St. John, there was one sheet covering Jesus's body, and a separate cloth covering his head. He then stated that \\"either St. John is a liar,\\" or else anyone who promotes such a shroud is \\"convicted of falsehood and deceit\\".John Calvin, 1543, Treatise on Relics, trans. by Count Valerian Krasinski, 1854; 2nd ed. Edinburgh: John Stone, Hunter, and Company, 1870; reprinted with an introduction by Joe Nickell, Amherst, N.Y.: Prometheus Books, 2009. 16th century to present In his painting of the shroud in a Descent from the cross scene, Giulio Clovio made an error and showed the right hand crossed over the left, c. 1540.The Shroud of Christ by Paul Vignon, Paul Tice 2002 page 21 The history of the shroud from the middle of the 16th century is well recorded. The existence of a miniature by Giulio Clovio, which gives a good representation of what was seen upon the shroud about the year 1540, confirms that the shroud housed in Turin today is the same one as in the middle of the 16th century. In 1578 the House of Savoy took the shroud to Turin and it has remained at Turin Cathedral ever since.How and why the shroud was transferred to Turin was studied by Filiberto Pingone, historian of the House of Savoy, who wrote the very first book on the Linen. See Filiberto Pingone, La Sindone dei Vangeli (Sindon Evangelica). Componimenti poetici sulla Sindone. Bolla di papa Giulio II (1506). Pellegrinaggio di S. Carlo Borromeo a Torino (1578). Introduzione, traduzione, note e riproduzione del testo originale a cura di Riccardo Quaglia, nuova edizione riveduta (2015), Biella 2015, pp. 260, . In 1532, the shroud suffered damage from a fire in the chapel where it was stored. A drop of molten silver from the reliquary produced a symmetrically placed mark through the layers of the folded cloth. Poor Clare Nuns attempted to repair this damage with patches. Some have suggested that there was also water damage from the extinguishing of the fire. However, there is some evidence that the watermarks were made by condensation in the bottom of a burial jar in which the folded shroud may have been kept at some point. In 1578, the shroud arrived again at its current location in Turin. It was the property of the House of Savoy until 1983, when it was given to the Holy See, the rule of the House of Savoy having ended in 1946. In 1988, the Holy See agreed to a radiocarbon dating of the relic, for which a small piece from a corner of the shroud was removed, divided, and sent to laboratories. (More on the testing is seen below.) Another fire, possibly caused by arson, threatened the shroud on 11 April 1997, but fireman Mario Trematore was able to remove it from its heavily protected display case and prevent further damage. In 2002, the Holy See had the shroud restored. The cloth backing and thirty patches were removed. This made it possible to photograph and scan the reverse side of the cloth, which had been hidden from view. Using sophisticated mathematical and optical techniques, a ghostly part- image of the body was found on the back of the shroud in 2004. Italian scientists had exposed the faint imprint of the face and hands of the figure. The Shroud was publicly exhibited in 2000 for the Great Jubilee, and in 2010 with the approval of Pope Benedict XVI, and in 2015 with the approval of Pope Francis. Another exhibition is scheduled for 2025. Detailed comments on this operation were published by various Shroud researchers. In 2003, the principal restorer Mechthild Flury-Lemberg, a textile expert from Switzerland, published a book with the title Sindone 2002: L'intervento conservativo ‚Äî Preservation ‚Äî Konservierung (). She describes the operation and the reasons it was believed necessary. In 2005, William Meacham, an archaeologist who has studied the Shroud since 1981, published the book The Rape of the Turin Shroud () which is fiercely critical of the operation. He rejects the reasons provided by Flury- Lemberg and describes in detail what he calls \\"a disaster for the scientific study of the relic\\". Historical attributions=Christian iconography Similarities between traditional icons of Jesus and the image on the shroud have been suggested. This image shows the mosaic Christ Pantocrator from the Daphni Monastery in Athens. Art historian W.S.A. Dale proposed that the Shroud was an icon created for liturgical use, and suggested an 11th-century date based on art-historical grounds. Analysis of proportion The man on the image is taller than the average first-century resident of Judaea and the right hand has longer fingers than the left, along with a significant increase of length in the right forearm compared to the left.Angier, Natalie. 1982. Unraveling the Shroud of Turin. The image of the man from the front is taller than the image of his back. Discover Magazine, October, pp. 54‚Äì60. Analysis of optical perspective Further evidence for the Shroud as an art object comes from what might be called the \\"Mercator projection\\" argument. The shroud in two dimensions presents a three-dimensional image projected onto a planar (two-dimensional) surface, just as in a photograph or painting. This perspective is consistent with both painting and with image formation using a bas relief. Variegated images Banding on the Shroud is background noise, which causes us to see the gaunt face, long nose, deep eyes, and straight hair. These features are caused by dark vertical and horizontal bands that go across the eyes. Using enhancement software (fast Fourier transform filters), the effect of these bands can be minimized. The result is a more detailed image of the shroud.\\"The double superficiality of the frontal image of the Turin Shroud\\", Giulio Fanti and Roberto Maggiolo, Journal of Optics A: Pure and Applied Optics, June 2004  Burial posture  The burial posture of the shroud, with hands crossed over the pelvis, was used by Essenes (2nd century BC to the 1st century AD), but was also found in a burial site under a medieval church with skeletons which were dated pre-1390 and post Roman.https://doncasterarchaeology.co.uk/Documents/The%20Corn%20Exchange.doc as of 25 July 2008as of 25 July 2008 ‚Äì showing Roman rule ended before then Leonardo da Vinci In June 2009, the British television station Channel 5 aired a documentary that claimed the shroud was forged by Leonardo da Vinci. Recently a study stated that the shroud of Turin had been faked by Leonardo da Vinci. According to the study, the Renaissance artist created the artifact by using pioneering photographic techniques and a sculpture of his own head, and suggests that the image on the relic is Leonardo's face which could have been projected onto the cloth, The Daily Telegraph reported. History Today article In an article published by History Today in November 2014, British scholar Charles Freeman analyses early depictions and descriptions of the Shroud and argues that the iconography of the bloodstains and all-over scourge marks are not known before 1300 and the Shroud was a painted linen at that date, with the paint having disintegrated leaving a discoloured linen image underneath. He also argues that the dimensions and format of the weave are typical of a medieval treadle loom. As it was unlikely that a forger would have deceived anyone with a single cloth with images on it, Freeman seeks an alternative function. He goes on to argue that the Shroud was a medieval prop used in Easter ritual plays depicting the resurrection of Christ. He believes it was used in a ceremony called the 'Quem Quaeritis?' or 'whom do you seek?' which involved re-enacting gospel accounts of the resurrection, and is represented as such in the well-known Lirey pilgrim badge. As such it was deservedly an object of veneration from the fourteenth century as it is still is today.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/23/turin-shroud-jesus- christ-medieval-easter-ritual-historian-charles-freeman See also * Conservation-restoration of the Shroud of Turin * Fringe theories about the Shroud of Turin * Radiocarbon dating of the Shroud of Turin References Category:Shroud of Turin Category:Tourist attractions in Turin ","title":"History of the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"26626333","text":"John Anthony Dyson, Lord Dyson, (born 31 July 1943) is a former British judge and barrister.

It is a major axis for long distance passenger and freight trains between the Ruhr and the north and east of Germany. It is the part of the trunk line built by the Cologne-Minden Railway Company (German, old spelling: C√∂ln-Mindener Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, CME) from K√∂ln Deutz to Minden. It was opened in 1847 and has been modernized and developed several times since then. History Trunk line in Bielefeld Line in Porta Westfalica in 1967 prior to the electrification The route was opened on 15 October 1847 by the Cologne-Minden Railway Company (CME) as the last part of its trunk line, extending the line previously completed from Deutz (near Cologne) to D√ºsseldorf, Duisburg, Dortmund and Hamm. It connected with the Royal Hanoverian State Railways‚Äô Hanover‚ÄìMinden line, which was opened the same day. The CME's line was originally laid with two tracks, although some sections were put into operation before the second track was finished. Because of its importance for Prussia‚Äôs east‚Äìwest transport and for international transport at the beginning of the 20th century, the line was made a four-track line. Many crossings were replaced with underpasses, and railway stations were rebuilt in order to provide space for the route. Operationally, the line is run as two separate two track routes, the one having the VzG number 1700, being built and maintained for passenger services and allowing speeds up to 200 km/h, whilst the route with the VzG number of 2990 is used mainly for freight and has a maximum speed of 120 km/h. Between Ahlen until shortly east of G√ºtersloh route 2990 uses the two southernmost tracks, whilst 1700 comprise the northernmost pair; west of Ahlen and east of G√ºtersloh route 1700 uses the southernmost pair of tracks. The lines were electrified in the mid-1960s. High-speed test track  The first Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan (1973) identified the Dortmund‚ÄìHannover‚ÄìBrunswick line as one of eight railway development projects. Already in the same year a 28 km long section of track between G√ºtersloh and Neubeckum was made available for high-speed trials for speeds up to 250 km/h. Locomotive 103 118 with special gear ratios achieved a maximum speed of 252.9 km/h in September 1973. Vehicles were also built to test catenary for high- speed operations. The minimum curve radius was 3,300 metres and maximum cant was 120 mm. Experiments were carried out on different types of track (including slab track), catenary and turnouts. Upgrading for high-speed  In 1980, it became one of the first lines in Germany upgraded for high speeds lines when a 58.0 kilometre long section between Hamm and Brackwede (near Bielefeld) was upgraded for scheduled services at 200 km/h. In mid-1985, a test train hauled by locomotive103 003 with special gear ratios between Brackwede and Neubeckum reached a speed of 283 km/h, a rail speed record in Germany. On 26 November 1985, at 11:29, an InterCityExperimental train fully occupied with passengers on the line between Gutersloh and Hamm reached a speed of 317 km/h. This was a new German record for rail vehicles and a world record for rail vehicles using three-phase power. Bridges =Schildesche viaduct  Schildesche Viaduct A remarkable bridge on the trunk line is the viaduct in the Bielefeld suburb of Schildesche. The original viaduct was completed in 1847 was double track with 28 spans and in 1917 a largely identical viaduct was built next to it. During World War II it was badly damaged on 14 March 1945 by a Grand Slam bomb dropped by an Avro Lancaster of No. 617 Squadron RAF, after 54 attacks by smaller bombs failed to destroy it. After the war, one line was reopened with a temporary steel strut for freight traffic, while passenger trains used a winding bypass built as a diversionary route prior to the bombing, known as the \\"rubber railway\\". In 1965 the viaduct was reopened, the two-track viaduct for the ‚Äúpassenger route‚Äù having been repaired with concrete spans replacing the destroyed masonry spans, and the other using a provisional steel-frame construction built from old Wehrmacht pioneer materials. In 1983, the ‚Äúfreight route‚Äù viaduct was fully repaired, featuring the same concrete architecture used for the passenger route‚Äôs bridge. Weser bridge  The Weser bridge in Rehme (Bad Oeynhausen) a suburb was destroyed by an air raid on 23 March 1945. The bridge was rebuilt after the war with only two tracks, creating a two-track bottleneck between Bad Oeynhausen station and the Neesen yard (in Porta Westfalica). This situation ended only with the construction of a new Weser bridge in December 1984. Services There is an hourly Intercity-Express trains service on line 10 from Berlin, via Hannover to Hamm, where trains are split (or are combined, in the reverse direction). Services continue to Dortmund, Essen, Duisburg, K√∂ln Messe/Deutz and Cologne/Bonn Airport or Hagen, Wuppertal and Cologne (some continue to Koblenz and Trier). Other InterCity and ICE trains also run. Regional-Express trains run on line RE6 (Rhein-Weser-Express, Minden‚ÄìCologne/Bonn Airport) every hour and other services operate on sections of the route.

More concentrated in Ghazni Province, they have also a significant presence in Paktia. During the 19th century they joined in the Ghilji revolt and many were summarily sent into internal exile. Somewhat inexplicably, they allied themselves for a time with the Harakat-i Islami, originally a Shia faction, during the anti-Soviet campaign.Gilles Dorronsoro, Revolution Unending: Afghanistan, 1979 to the Present. New York: Columbia University Press, 2005. 167 In fact, there were two Mujaheddin parties named Harakat-i Islami Afghanistan, while one was a Shi'ite faction, the other and far more significant party was originally a 'united front' of mainly Hezb-i Islami and Jamiat-i Islami, that collapsed after only a few months, leaving behind a significant party that was in many ways a precursor to the present day Taliban movement. A majority of the Andar tribe were affiliated with this 'Harakt-i Islami' and it is notable that the leader of this united front and later party, Mawlawi Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi was Andar by tribe. Similarly, the senior Mawlawi Mansoor was Andar too. Mansoor's son Saifurrahman Mansoor was later an important figure and military leader in the Taliban movement. Andars living in the Andar District of Ghazni Province (Afghanistan) and surrounding areas consist of five main clans: Jalalzai, Lakankhel, Brahimzai, Bazikhel and Peerkhail. The Andar were organized by an elder referred to as Khanay Baba around early 19th century and started an armed conquest of reclaiming the present Paktia and Ghazni areas from the Hazara ethnic group. This also coincided with the Afghan British wars and when Amir Abdul Rahman reached a compromise with the British, he further supported Andar (and other supporting Pashtoon tribes) to reclaim the Daya, Malistan and Ajiristan districts from Hazaras. During this era, a military commander known as Sepah Salar (highest military rank in the then army) Sher Ahmad Khan was notable for leading many years of successful conquests. In the meantime, Andars participated in the ongoing war against the British. Famous among the Andar military leaders in the war against the British were Mullah Mushk-e Alam in Ghazni area and Haji Abdul Razaq in Waziristan. Both men are still remembered as great leaders to this day. Traditionally, the Andar specialized in construction and maintenance of qanats.

His maternal grandfather was Thoroughbred trainer John P. Mayberry who won the 1903 Kentucky Derby. Career During the 1970s and 1980s, Lang wore several hats in the racing business but was perhaps best known in his roles as general manager of the Maryland Jockey Club tracks, Pimlico and Laurel.

In his later years, Lang served as a consultant and commentator for numerous tracks and media outlets. Chick Lang was credited with bringing the Preakness national attention when the Kentucky Derby overshadowed it. He tirelessly promoted the Baltimore race, and traveled to the Kentucky Derby with signs reading, \\"Next Stop Preakness\\". He once floated hundreds of yellow and black balloons over the Kentucky Derby Parade. Lang started as a successful jockey's agent and worked at Pimlico from 1960 to 1987, holding the positions of director of racing, vice president, and general manager.

It was founded in 1923 by six painters in Sydney, and was modeled after the Royal Watercolour Society and the American Watercolor Society. History The AWI's first exhibition occurred in 1924. A students' exhibition began in 1930. Until 1974, the AWI met in a variety of places and the annual exhibitions were held in different galleries. In that year, it received a grant enabling the AWI to rent space in a building on Sydney's Sussex Street. A reciprocal exhibition with the American Watercolor Society occurred in 1975, and in 1977, an AWI exhibition toured New Zealand. The international presence expanded to include Mexico City, Mexico; Spain; Vancouver, Canada; Hong Kong; and Korea (4th Asian Grand Watercolour Festival, Busan Biennale). The founding members were J. Bennett, Alfred James Daplyn, Albert Henry Fullwood, Benjamin Edwin Minns, Martin Stainforth and Charles Ephraim Smith Tindall. Invited foundation members included Albert Collins, John Eldershaw, Hans Heysen, Norman Lindsay, Sydney Long, Arthur Streeton, John D Moore, J. W. Tristram and Blamire Young. Past presidents include George Duncan and Hal Missingham. Other notable members include Ronald Steuart, winner of the 1958 Wynne Prize, and Robert Wade, winner of the 1986 \\"Advance Australia Medal\\" for outstanding contribution to Australian watercolour. While membership was by invitation, it was not a requirement for exhibiting at the annual exhibition, such as the example of Heysen. Jean Isherwood's first exhibited work with the AWI. in 1934. was a small painting, but thereafter, she became a frequent exhibitor in major art exhibitions. In 2006, ten percent of the membership were recipients of honours awarded by the Australian state (Australia Honours). Publications AWI published its first book, Australian Watercolour Institute: 75th anniversary 1923-1998 on the occasion of its 75th anniversary in 1998. Its second book, The Australian Watercolour Institute: A Gallery of Australia's Finest Watercolours, was published in 2006. The 2006 edition reproduces over 150 contemporary Australian watercolour works, as well as forty historical ones, and includes essays that document Australia's watercolouring history.

The selection is taken from the 241 recordings listed on bach-cantatas as of 2015.  History  The work was first recorded by symphonic choirs and orchestras. From the late 1960s, historically informed performances (HIP) tried to adhere more to the sounds of the composer's lifetime, who typically wrote for boys choirs and for comparatively small orchestras of Baroque instruments, often now called \\"period instruments\\". Some scholars believe that Bach used only one singer for a vocal part in the choral movements, termed \\"one voice per part\\" (OVPP). On some of these recordings, the solo singer is reinforced in choral movements with a larger orchestra by a ripieno singer (OVPP+R).  Table of selected recordings  The sortable listing is taken mostly from the selection provided by Aryeh Oron on the Bach-Cantatas website. The information lists for one recording typically: * Conductor / choir / orchestra, sometimes several choirs * Soloists in the order Evangelist (tenor), Vox Christi (Voice of Jesus, bass), soprano, alto, tenor (if the tenor arias are performed by a different tenor than the evangelist), bass (if the bass parts are performed by a different bass than the voice of Jesus). * Label * Year of the recording * Choir type *# Large choirs (red background): Bach (choir dedicated to Bach's music, founded in the mid of the 20th century), Boys (choir of all male voices), Radio (choir of a broadcaster), Symphony (choir related to a symphony orchestra) *# Medium-size choirs, such as Chamber choir, Chorale (choir dedicated mostly to church music) *# One voice per part (green background): OVPP or OVPP+R (with ripienists reinforcing the soloists in some chorale movements) * Orch. type (orchestra type) *# Large orchestras (red background): Bach (orchestra dedicated to Bach's music, founded in the mid of the 20th century), Radio (symphony orchestra of a broadcaster), Symphony *# Chamber orchestra *# Orchestra on period instruments (green background) References Sources  * St. John Passion Commentary, musical examples, list of recordings, and other information on bach-cantatas Category:Discographies of compositions by J.

Accident The aircraft took off from Heathrow at 05:54 GMT but minutes into the flight the flight crew reported engine problems and requested a return to Blackbushe Airport. The crew was cleared by Air Traffic Control to descend to 3000 feet, but they were unable to maintain this altitude and continued descending. A Mayday call was made from the aircraft at 0632 GMT, shortly before it crashed into a row of houses on Kelvin Gardens, Southall, Middlesex.Aviation Safety Network. The aircraft burst into flames on impact, killing all three crew members as well as four people on the ground, a mother and three children. Witnesses reported that they saw one of the crew waving outside of the aircraft just before the aircraft crashed.British Pathe newsreel, 4 September 1958. Cause According to the Public inquiry which investigated the accident, the probable cause of the accident was that \\"the aircraft was allowed to lose height and flying speed with the result that the pilot was no longer able to exercise asymmetric control.\\" While the reasons for the loss of power and the subsequent loss of height and speed were not known, the public inquiry found a number of serious flaws in the operation of Independent Air Travel and the maintenance of the aircraft. Maintenance had been carried out on one of the aircraft propellers at Heathrow on the night before the accident by personnel who were not qualified to carry out the work. The aircraft was overloaded and the pilot had not had adequate rest, having effectively been on duty for 31 hours 30 minutes compared with the 16 hours required by the regulations (This took advantage of a loophole in regulations that allowed crew to carry out flights during \\"rest\\" hours if no passengers or cargo was carried.Flight 28 August 1959, p.91.). Check flights, which should have tested the pilot's ability to handle the aircraft at high weights and with one engine out were found to be \\"perfunctory\\" and did not adequately prove the pilot's ability to handle the aircraft with one engine failed. The report stated that \\"it is quite clear...that the policy of this company was to keep its aircraft in the air at all costs and without any real regard for the requirements of maintenance.\\" and that \\"it is not difficult for employers who are not unduly concerned to observe the regulations, to drive their employees and . . . to induce them to disregard the regulations designed to ensure safety in the air.\\" References * \\"Morning Disaster\\".

After attending school, and attending an arts and crafts college, Altenhain took over as the holder of the management of a printing company. There is a street named after him today in Sprockh√∂vel where his printing company was located. Altenhain joined the German Democratic Party (DDP) in 1918 and remained with it during the merger with the Young German Order in 1930. From 1925 to 1933, Altenhain was one of the official representatives of Ha√ülinghausen, from 1926 to 1933 a member of the Kreisausschuss Ennepe-Ruhr code, and from 1929 to 1933 one of the Councilors of Ha√ülinghausen. From 1927 to 1929 and 1946, he served a member of the county council and was also a deputy member of the Zonenbeirat under the British zone of occupation at the end of the war whilst serving as the mayor of the city in 1945 and 1946. After World War II, Altenhain was involved in the creation of the Liberal Democratic Party in Westphalia, which on 7 January 1946 in Opladen led to the formation of the Free Democratic Party (FDP). At its founding congress, he was elected as one of six vice-chairmen, confirmed in June 1947. He was also chairman of the FDP-Westphalia and, after the formation of the Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia in May 1947 its chairman. However, this role was short-lived as he was seen too left wing, and was replaced in August 1947 in a vote by Friedrich Middelhauve.

Pavlov: June 28-July 4, 1950. Academy of Sciences of the USSR Academy. University Press of the Pacific (July 1, 2001) Google preview. The session was organized by the Soviet Government headed by Joseph Stalin in order to fight Western influences in Russian physiological sciences. During the session, a number of Ivan Pavlov's former students attacked another group of his students (Leon Orbeli, Pyotr Anokhin, Aleksey Speransky, Ivan Beritashvili) whom they accused of deviating from Pavlov's teaching. As the result of this session, Soviet physiology self-excluded itself from the international scientific community for many years.Windholz G (1997) 1950 Joint Scientific Session: Pavlovians as the accusers and the accused.

Pavlov's The Work of the Digestive Glands.  Preceding events  The Pavlovian session followed a sequence of Stalin's interferences in academic affairs during the post-war time: * In 1947, Georgy Aleksandrov asked Stalin to review his textbook for university students entitled \\"History of West European Philosophy\\".G.F. Aleksandrov, Istoria Zapadnoevropeiskoi Filosofii (Moscow, Leningrad: Izdatel'stvo Akademii Nauk SSSR, 1946). Stalin criticized the book as an attempt to analyze philosophy from a pro-Western position rather than using the principles of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism.M. G. Iaroshevskiy \\"Pavlovska&ia; Sessiya\\" 1950 g. i Sud'by Sovetskoi Fiziologii,\\" Voprosy Istorii Estestvoznaniya i Tekhniki, No. 3, (1988): 129‚Äì136. See pp. 129‚Äì130. * In 1948, Stalin strongly supported Lysenko's work on the inheritance of acquired characteristics in plants which has now been discredited. Lysenko's research was thought to hold the promise of strengthening the Soviet Union's agriculture. * In 1949, Stalin declared an opposition to cosmopolitism.V.V. Fanardzhian. L. A. Orbeli i Ob'edinennaia Sessiya Dvukh Akademii (1950 g.), Fiziologicheskii Zhurnal SSSR im. I. M. Sechenova 76(12) (1990): 1816‚Äì1822. Great Soviet Encyclopedia defined cosmopolitism as a \\"reactionary bourgeois ideology of rejecting national traditions and national sovereignty by preaching indifferent relationship to one's country and national culture and advocating the establishment of a 'world government' and 'world citizenship.' \\"B.A. Vvedenskiy, ed. Bol'shaya Sovetska&ia; Entsiklopediya. 2nd ed., vol. 23, (Moscow: Gosudarstvennoe Nauchnoe Izdatel'stvo \\"Bol'shaya Sovetskaya Entsiklopediya, 1953). See p. 113. * In 1949, Stalin commented on the issues of linguistics, in particular he criticized the view that language was a derivative of an economic base.J. Stalin, Marxism and Linguistics (NY: International Publishers, 1951). Stalin also stated that \\"no science can develop and flourish without a battle of opinions, without freedom of criticism.\\" The interference in physiology, psychology and psychiatry was initiated in the summer of 1949 when Stalin instructed the Minister of Health Yefim Smirnov to hold a session on Pavlov's teachings. On 28 September 1949, on the eve of the 100th anniversary of Pavlov's birth, Yuri Zhdanov reported to Stalin about the \\"serious trouble\\" with the development of Pavlov's teaching and put the blame on Orbeli, Beritashvili, and arrested Stern. In replying to this report, Stalin wrote: \\"In my opinion, the greatest harm to Academician Pavlov's teaching was done by Academician Orbeli... The sooner Orbeli will be exposed and the more thoroughly his monopoly will be eliminated, the better. Beritov and Stern are not so dangerous because they oppose to Pavlov openly and thus facilitate the reprisal of science against these amateurs of science... Now something about the tactics of the struggle against the opponents of Academician Pavlov's theory. At first, it is necessary to stealthily collect Academician Pavlov's supporters, organize them, assign roles, and only after this to gather the session of physiologists... where it will be necessary to give decisive battle to the opponents. Without this, it can fail. Remember: the enemy should be firmly beaten, with reliance on complete success.\\" Georgy Malenkov supervised the organization of the meeting.  Keynote speeches  Four keynote speakers outlined the main topics of the session: Sergey Vavilov, the President of the USSR Academy of the Sciences; Ivan Petrovich Razenkov, the Vice-President of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences; Konstantin Bykov, the Director of the General Physiological Department at the Institute of Experimental Medicine; and Anatoly Grigorievitch Ivanov-Smolenskiy, a psychiatrist.  Vavilov's speech  In his inaugural address, Sergey Vavilov, praised Stalin and Pavlov for their materialistic approach to the problem of relationship between the material and mental. He stated that Pavlov was a great scientist whom Stalin and the Soviet Government esteemed very highly. Vavilov noted that Soviet physiologists had made great achievements since Pavlov's death, but some did not follow Pavlov's teaching and even attempted a revision of Pavlov's views. Open or concealed opposition to Pavlov's materialistic theory was expected and quite understandable for bourgeois scientists who suggested that Pavlov's theory of conditioned reflexes should be shelved and only his experimental methods might be useful. However, even Soviet scientists did very little to develop important trends suggested by Pavlov. For example, experts who participated in a broad discussion of materialistic linguistics in Pravda did not even mention the role of Pavlov's theory in the study of language. Vavilov explained that the goal of the joint session of physiologists and psychiatrists was to conduct \\"a critical and self-critical examination of how matters stand with regard to the development of Pavlov's legacy in the Soviet Union\\". He concluded: \\"There can be no doubt that it is only a return to Pavlov's road that physiology can be most effective, most beneficial to our people and most worthy of the Stalin epoch of the building of Communism. Glory to Pavlov's genius! Long live the leader of peoples, our great scientist and preceptor in all our major undertakings, Comrade Stalin!\\"  Razenkov's speech  Ivan Razenkov spoke after Vavilov. He emphasized the importance of opposing the \\"reactionary idealist trend\\" in physiology following the example of Trofim Lysenko who contributed to a \\"decisive victory\\" of Ivan Vladimirovich Michurin's teachings over Weismannism-Morganism. Razenkov praised Pavlov's contribution to practical medicine and criticized Pavlov's students for not applying the progressive ideas of Pavlov and Ivan Sechenov to theoretical and practical medicine. He blamed Pavlov's immediate disciples and successors: L.N. Fydorov, the former director of the Institute of Experimental Medicine, Leon Orbeli, the director of the Pavlov Institute of Evolutionary Physiology, Pyotr Anokhin, the head of the Moscow Institute of Physiology, and Aleksey Speransky, the head of the Institute of General and Experimental Pathology. According to Razenkov, these scientists did not fight hard enough to defend Pavlov's materialist theory against the assaults of Western idealist physiologists, such as Sherrington, Lashley and Fulton, and Pavlov's opponents in Russia, such as Beritov. Razenkov also expressed some self-criticism for not conforming with the Party and the Government's expectation of the Academy of Medical Sciences. He informed that the Government had created a new scientific institution, the Institute of Physiology of the Higher Nervous System, to advance Pavlov's teachings, and Pavlov's faithful disciple Konstantin Bykov had been named the director of that institute. Razenkov emphasized the importance of the application of the work conducted by Bykov and his colleagues to clinical practice. He concluded his speech with a praise to the \\"peerless scientist, Comrade Stalin\\".  Bykov's speech  The next keynote speaker, Konstantin Bykov, asserted that medical science must be built on the foundation of correct humanitarian sciences in addition to biology and psychology. He praised the triumph of Michurian biology based on the philosophy of materialism. He also praised the \\"decisive blow struck at reactionary idealist theories\\" by Pavlov. Bykov divided the history of physiology and psychology into two periods: idealistic pre-Pavlovian stage and Pavlovian materialistic stage. Bykov condemned the West-European theories of the pre-Pavlovian stage which explained complex nervous phenomena based on idealistic analytical physiology. The authors of these theories failed to recognize class roots of scientific views. According to Bykov, Pavlov made a transition from analytical to synthetic thinking. He discovered a new class of reflexes, conditioned reflexes. He then developed the theory of higher nervous activity. Under the Soviet System, Pavlovian physiology could develop and flourish. However, some of Pavlov's students failed to follow his theory of higher nervous function and instead diverted to irrelevant issues. Even worse, they accepted Western theories. Bykov named Pavlov's disciples who correctly followed the theories of their teacher: Anatoly Ivanov-Smolenskiy and Ezras Asratovich Asratian. Then, he named the ones who deviated from the right path: Orbeli, Anokhin, Speransky and their coworkers. In particular, Orbeli followed idealist sensory theories of Ewald Hering and Wilhelm Wundt and even claimed that they had similarities with Pavlov's materialist theory. Orbeli's associates A.G. Ginetsinskiy and A.V. Lebedinskiy wrote a textbook for physicians \\"Principles of the Physiology in Man and Animals\\".A.G. Ginetsinskiy and A.V. Lebedinskiy. Principles of the Physiology in Man and Animals. Leningrad: Gosudarstvennoe Izdatel'stvo Meditsinskoiy Literatury, 1947. in which they treated Pavlov's results as inferior to Western studies. In Anokhin's case, Bykov noted that, although Anoknin had deviated from Pavlov's ideas when Pavlov was still alive, there was still some hope for him and he might correct his mistakes and contribute to Soviet physiology. Bykov praised the contributions of Pavlov's ideas to medicine, emphasized the importance of following the right direction of Pavlov's teachings and resisting false Western theories. Finally, he spoke about Stalin's work that suggested improvement of science through criticism and self-criticism. Ivanov- Smolenskiy's speech In his long speech, Anatoly Ivanov-Smolenskiy reviewed of Pavlov's achievements in the development of the theory of higher nervous activity. According to Ivanov-Smolenskiy, Pavlov's contribution to psychiatry was \\"of immense value\\" as opposed to the failure of foreign scientists who did not achieve anything important. Ivanov-Smolenskiy then praised some Russian physiologists and condemned the others. He praised L. A. Andreev and M. K. Petrova as the followers of Pavlov's legacy. He accused Anokhin, Kupalov, and Orbeli. Anokhin was blamed for suggesting that Pavlov's theory was isolated from foreign science and needed improvement, for leaning toward Sherrington's concept of integration, and for criticizing Pavlov's conception of cortical inhibition. Kupalov was accused of distorting Pavlov's conceptualization of reflexes. Ivanov-Smolenskiy characterized Orbeli's views of the relation between subjective experience and objective reality as anti-Pavlovian because ‚Äî unlike Pavlov who believed that subjective, psychological experience was superimposed on the objective experience of the environment ‚Äî Orbeli separated the subjective and objective and adhered to psychophysiological parallelism. Orbeli was also blamed for diverging from Pavlov's deterministic position on the mechanisms of higher nervous activity. Responses In the sessions that followed the keynote speeches, a number of speakers continued to attack the accused Pavlovians, and the accused confessed to their errors and expressed apologies. Asratian's speech Ezras Asratian spoke on June 29. According to him, several Pavlovians failed the expectations of the Communist Party and the Soviet government. In particular, they failed to pursue research in several important fields, for example cortical localization of functions and fixation of inherited conditioned reflexes in the next generation. They also failed to challenge the anti-Pavlovian theories of Western physiologists.  Consequence  In 1982, M.G. Yaroshevsky, criticizing the Pavlovian session, wrote that, in fact, Ivanov-Smolenskiy and his disciples did nothing but pervert the kernel of Pavlovian teaching, substituting for it a mechanistic view of the brain activity. These so-called scholars of Pavlov emasculated the ground of his theory and extremely damaged the prospects of Soviet science. A precursor of later abuses in psychiatry in the Soviet Union and the most somber event in the history of Russian-Soviet psychiatry was the so-called 'Joint Session' of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences and the Board of the All-Union Neurologic and Psychiatric Association, held in the name of Ivan Pavlov in October 1951, considered the matter of several leading neuroscientists and psychiatrists of the time (for example, Grunya Sukhareva, Vasily Gilyarovsky, Raisa Golant, Aleksandr Shmaryan, Mikhail Gurevich) who were charged with practicing 'anti-Pavlovian, anti-Marxist, idealistic, reactionary' science damaging to Soviet psychiatry. These talented psychiatrists had to admit publicly to their wrong beliefs and mistakes and promise to profess only Pavlov's teaching. During the Joint Session, scientists falsely acknowledged their 'wrongdoings' and gave up their beliefs, out of fear. But in the closing speech, the lead author of the policy report Andrei Snezhnevsky stated that they \\"have not disarmed themselves and continue to remain in the old anti-Pavlovian positions\\", thereby causing \\"grave damage to the Soviet scientific and practical psychiatry\\", and the vice president of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences accused them that they \\"diligently fall down to the dirty source of American pseudo-science\\". The fear and less than noble ambitions of the accusers including Irina Strelchuk, Vasily Banshchikov, Oleg Kerbikov, and Andrei Snezhnevsky were also likely to make them serve in the role of inquisitors. Not surprisingly, many of them were advanced and appointed to leadership positions shortly after the session. The Joint Session also affected neuroscience in such a way that the best neuroscientists of the time, such as academicians Pyotr Anokhin, Aleksey Speransky, Lina Stern, Ivan Beritashvili, and Leon Orbeli, who headed various scientific directions at that time, were labeled as anti-Pavlov, anti-materialist and reactionaries, and discharged from their positions. These scientists lost their laboratories, and some were subjected to tortures in prisons. The Moscow, Leningrad, Ukrainian, Georgian, and Armenian schools of neuroscience and neurophysiology were damaged, at least for a while. The Joint Session ravaged productive research in neurosciences and psychiatry for years to come. It was pseudoscience that took over. After the joint meeting of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences and the USSR Academy of Sciences (Pavlovian Session of 1950), pathophysiology of higher nervous activity was established as a new discipline mandatory for all of the USSR psychiatrists who underwent retraining in accordance with this concept. According to the postulates of pathophysiology of higher nervous activity, the development of all mental disorders was explained in terms of the changed relations between the excitation and inhibition, their interference and different phases of the inhibition. Psychological approaches during diagnosing, treating and explaining the mechanisms of mental disorders have been banned and virtually excluded from the practice of psychiatrists. This ban was based on the ideological concept of labeling all psychological theories of personality, especially psychoanalytic ones, as reactionary and idealistic. After the joint session of the Academy of Sciences and the Academy of Medical Sciences on June 28 ‚Äî July 4, 1950 and during the session of the Presidium of the Academy of Medical Sciences and the Board of the All-Union Society of Neuropathologists and Psychiatrists on October 11‚Äì15, 1951, the leading role was given to Snezhnevky's school. The 1950 decision to give monopoly over psychiatry to the Pavlovian school of Professor Andrei Snezhnevsky was one of crucial factors of the onset of political psychiatry. The Soviet doctors, under the incentive of Snezhnevsky, devised 'Pavlovian theory of schizophrenia' on the strength of which they diagnosticated this illness in political oppositionists.

The battle was fought between Finnish forces‚Äîusing war materiel provided by Germany‚Äîand Soviet forces. To date, it is the largest battle in the history of the Nordic countries. The battle marked a point in the Soviet offensive when the Finnish forces first prevented the Soviets from making any significant gains.Jowett, P., Snodgrass, B. Finland at War 1939‚Äì45 Osprey Publishing. 2006.Baryshnikov (2006) Earlier at Siiranm√§ki and Perkj√§rvi the Finns had halted advancing Soviet forces.Lunde (2011) pp. 286‚Äì287 The Finnish forces achieved a defensive victory against overwhelming odds. After the Soviets had failed to create any breakthroughs at Tali-Ihantala, Vyborg Bay, or Vuosalmi, the Soviet Leningrad Front started the previously planned transferZolotarev (1999), pp. 97‚Äì98, 368Moisala & Alanen (1988) pp. 152‚Äì154 of troops from the Karelian Isthmus to support Narva Offensive, where they were encountering particularly fierce resistance.

The River Vuoksi can be seen originating from near the city Imatra. Parts of Karelia, as they are traditionally divided. After the initial Finnish advance of 1941, the Continuation War was stabilized to trench warfare with very little activity on either side. When the Siege of Leningrad was lifted in January 1944, the Stavka received orders to plan an offensive against Finland to push it out of the war. The Soviet attack on the Finnish front commenced on the Karelian Isthmus on June 9, 1944, (coordinated with the Allied Invasion of Normandy). Three Soviet armies were pitted there against the Finns, among them several experienced Guard formations. The attack soon breached the Finnish front line of defence in Valkeasaari on June 10, and the Finnish forces retreated to their secondary defence line, the VT-line (which ran between Vammelsuu and Taipale). The Soviet attack was supported by a massive artillery barrage, air bombardments, and armoured forces. The VT-line was breached in Sahakyl√§ and Kuuterselk√§ on June 14; and after a failed counterattack in Kuuterselk√§ by the Finnish armoured division, the Finnish defence had to be pulled back to the VKT-line (Viipuri ‚Äì Kuparsaari ‚Äì Taipale). The abandonment of the VT-line was followed by a week of retreat and delaying battles. The Soviet offensive was crowned when the city of Viipuri (Russian: Vyborg) was captured by the Soviets on June 20 after only a short battle. Despite the Red Army's great success in smashing two Finnish defense lines and capturing a substantial piece of territory in just ten days, it had failed to destroy the Finnish army which was able to concentrate its depleted forces on the VKT-line, and had time to get reinforcements from the other main front north of Lake Ladoga. Baron Mannerheim, the Finnish commander in chief, had asked for German help on June 12, and on June 16 the Flight Detachment Kuhlmey (a composite ad hoc wing of about 70 dive bombers and ground attack fighters, with a fighter and an air transport component) arrived in Finland. A few days later the battalion-sized 303 Assault Gun Brigade and the 122nd Division Greif also arrived; but after that the Germans offered only supplies, the most important of which were Panzerfaust anti-tank weapons. During one engagement the Finns destroyed 25 Soviet tanks with the Panzerfaust weapons.Jowlett & Snodgrass p. 14 On June 21 the Stavka ordered the Leningrad Front to breach the defensive line and advance to Lake Saimaa. On June 21 the Finnish government asked the Soviets about the possibility for peace and accompanying Soviet conditions. The Soviet response arrived on June 23; it demanded a signed statement to the effect that Finland was ready to surrender and was asking for peace, but the Finnish government rejected this. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop arrived on June 22 and demanded a guarantee that Finland would fight to the end as a precondition of continued German military support. President Ryti gave this guarantee as a personal undertaking.

The 21st Army did not commit all of its forces simultaneously but instead kept some of the forces in reserve and committed them only after the initially committed formations had spent their offensive capability and required rest and refit. Also, at the beginning of the battle, some of the Soviet forces that later took part in the battle were deployed on nearby sections of the front, such as the 108th Rifle Corps with its three divisions being deployed to Vyborg and the Vyborg Bay area.

Altogether approx 1600 combat aircraft, of which periodically up to 80 % were used against the Finnish forces in June 1944 (the rest securing the southern shore of Gulf of Finland against German Luftflotte 1). The terrain The Battle of Tali-Ihantala was fought in a small area (100 km2) between the northern tip of Vyborg Bay and the River Vuoksi around the villages of Tali and Ihantala, 8‚Äì14 km north-east from Vyborg. The Soviet forces were concentrated on the area east of the city of Vyborg, from where the attack started, through the southern village of Tali, northwards to Ihantala (Petrovka). This was the only suitable exit terrain for armoured forces out of the Karelian Isthmus, 10 km wide, broken by small lakes and limited by Saimaa Canal on the west and the River Vuoksi on the east.

Battle Squadron Kuhlmey's Stukas returning from mission in Karelian Isthmus in late June 1944. The fighting in the area began on June 20. June 20‚Äì24 The first days were a defensive battle that the Finnish 18th Division (6th and 48th Infantry Regiment and 28th Independent Battalion) and 3rd Brigade (4 battalions) and the 3rd battalion of the 13th Regiment (Swedish speaking) fought against the Soviet 97th and 109th Corps and 152nd Tank Brigade. The defenders were hit especially hard by artillery and air attacks, but managed to put up a strong defense that stalled the Soviet advance long enough for Finnish reinforcements to join the battle. June 25‚Äì26 The action of June 25 started at 06:30 with a one-hour Soviet heavy artillery bombardment and air attack, followed by a major Soviet offensive from Tali village at 07:30. The Soviets' goal in the attack was to reach Imatra-Lappeenranta-Suurp√§√§l√§ before June 28. The 30th Guards Rifle Corps had now also joined the battle. The Soviet army tried to break through along both sides of Lake Leitimoj√§rvi. The attack on the eastern side of the lake was stopped after three kilometers by the Finnish 4th Division. On the west side, the Soviet infantry of the 45th Guards Division and the 109th Corps got stuck in defensive positions around the hills of Konkkalanvuoret defended by the Finnish regiment JR48. However, the Soviet 27th Tank Regiment was able to force their way to the Portinhoikka crossroads. The Soviets also attacked with the 178th Division over the Saarela Strait, which was defended by Finnish regiment JR6's 1st battalion, but the attack was thrown back here as well. Meanwhile, the Soviet 97th Corps attacked the Finnish 3rd Brigade's positions but gained little ground. At this stage the situation was very critical for the Finns, whose units were at risk of being cut off and surrounded. This would inevitably have led to the defeat of the Finnish IV Corps and the loss of the VKT line. The Finns were able to organize a counterattack with the reserves of the 18th Division, parts of the 17th Division, and some battle groups from the 4th Division. Later that afternoon, the Finnish armored division joined the battle and managed to push the Soviet attackers on the west side of the Lake Leitimoj√§rvi back to their starting point. The Soviet 27th Tank Regiment was annihilated except for six tanks that were captured by the Finns. June 27‚Äì30 More Finnish units joined the battle along with the German 303rd Sturmgesch√ºtz brigade. The Finnish units had been spread out and mixed in the battle, which made the organization of a concentrated defence difficult. The Finnish units were therefore reorganized into two battle groups, BG Bj√∂rkman and BG Puroma. The Soviets also reinforced their forces with the 108th Corps. At this stage, the Soviet forces included at least one armored brigade, two armored breakthrough regiments, and four assault gun regiments (around 180 AFVs if full strength). The Finns tried to regain the initiative by attacking the four Soviet divisions (46th Guard, 63rd Guard, 64th Guard, 268th Division and the 30th Guards Tank Brigade) ‚Äì that had broken through east of Leitimoj√§rvi ‚Äì from three directions, in order to make a \\"motti\\" of the Soviet divisions. The two battle groups, Bj√∂rkman and Puroma, did manage to advance to within one kilometer of each other but failed to surround the Soviet divisions who had set themselves up into a hedgehog defense around Talinmylly. The Finnish attack failed because of heavy Soviet resistance especially with massed tanks and artillery, and because communication between several Finnish battalions broke down during the attack. Colonel Puroma said after the war that the one thing he regretted was the failure to make a motti out of Talinmylly. The attack gave the Finnish defenders 72 hours of respite at the same time as the fresh Finnish 6th and 11th Divisions reached the battlefield. Several tank battles took place during this fighting. On June 28, air activity was high on both sides as Finnish bombers and German Stukas pounded the Soviet formations and the Soviet 276th Bomber Division hit the Finnish troops hard. On June 28, the Finnish commander Oesch gave the order for Finnish units to withdraw back to the line of Vakkila-Ihantalaj√§rvi-Kokkoselk√§-Noskuanselk√§ (still within the VKT line), but they became caught up in a new Soviet offensive. In sector of 18th Division, in Ihantala one powerful barrage by 14 Finnish artillery battalions (~170 guns and howitzers) destroyed or damaged at least 15 Soviet tanks.Rautonen, 1959: \\"Kentt√§tykist√∂n suorittama panssaritorjunta ep√§suorin ammunnoin\\" (Sotakorkeakoulu, diplomity√∂) http://digi.narc.fi/digi/view.ka?kuid=64315707 June 29 was the hardest and worst day for the Finns during the whole battle, and defeat was not far off. The Finnish forces finally managed to restore the line on June 29 after very bloody fighting. On June 30, the Finnish forces retreated from Tali. The heaviest fighting took place between July 1 and July 2 when the Finns lost some 800 men per day. Ihantala: July 1‚Äì9 The ensuing Finnish concentration of artillery fire was the heaviest in the country's military history.Maanpuolustuskorkeakoulun historian laitos, Jatkosodan historia 1‚Äì6, 1994 It was based on the famed fire correction method of Finnish Artillery General Vilho Petter Nenonen, which enabled easy fire correction and quick changes of targets. At the critical Ihantala sector of the battle, the Finnish defenders managed to concentrate their fire to the extent of smashing the advancing Soviet spearhead. The clever fire control system enabled as many as 21 batteries, totaling some 250 guns, to fire at the same target simultaneously in the battle; the fire controller did not need to be aware of the location of individual batteries to guide their fire, which made quick fire concentration and target switching possible. The Finnish artillery fired altogether over 122,000 rounds of ordnance. This concentration was considered a world record at the time.(In fact with 8 days period Finns fired more rounds in Vuosalmi and if taking 5 days period record of artillery rounds was fired in U-line, Nietj√§rvi) These fire missions managed to halt and destroy Soviet forces that were assembling at their jumping off points. On thirty occasions the Soviet forces destroyed were larger than battalion size. According to Bitva za Leningrad 1941‚Äì1944 (\\"The Battle of Leningrad\\") edited by Lieutenant General S.P. Platonov: \\"The repeated offensive attempts by the Soviet Forces failed ... to gain results. The enemy succeeded in significantly tightening its ranks in this area and repuls[ing] all attacks of our troops ... During the offensive operations lasting over three weeks, from June 21 to mid-July, the forces of the right flank of the Leningrad front failed to carry out the tasks assigned to them on the orders of the Supreme Command issued on June 21.\\" By this time the Finnish army had concentrated half its artillery in the area, along with the army's only armoured division, with StuG III assault guns as its primary weapon, and the German 303 Sturmgesch√ºtz Brigade (it destroyd only one Soviet AFV). The defenders now finally had the new German anti-tank weapons that were previously kept in storage. The Finnish also made good use of German Panzerschreck anti-tank weapons. With these weapons the Finnish destroyed a large number of Soviet tanks-including 25 in one afternoon engagement. During 1 July near the village of T√§htel√§ field artillery of 6th Divisions damaged 4 tanks and during next day 2 July artillery of 6th Division destroyed 5 tanks in Vakkila, T√§htel√§ and Ihantala. Rautonen, 1959: \\"Kentt√§tykist√∂n suorittama panssaritorjunta ep√§suorin ammunnoin\\" (Sotakorkeakoulu, diplomity√∂) On July 2 the Finns intercepted a radio message that the 63rd Guards Rifle Division and 30th Armored Brigade were about to launch an attack on July 3 at 04:00 hours. The following morning, two minutes before the supposed attack, 40 Finnish and 40 German bombers bombed the Soviet troops, and 250 guns fired a total of 4,000 artillery shells into the area of the Soviets. On the same day, beginning at 06:00, 200 Soviet planes and their infantry attacked the Finnish troops. By 19:00 the Finnish troops had restored their lines. On July 6 the Soviet forces had some success, despite the Finnish 6th Division having 18 artillery battalions and one heavy battery for their defence. However, the Soviets were thrown back the following day, and their counterattacks at 13:30 and 19:00 that day did not amount to anything. By July 7, the focus of the Soviet attacks was already moving to the area of Vuoksi, and the Soviets now began transferring (remnants of) their best troops to the Narva front in Estonia, to fight the Germans and the Estonians. From July 9, the Soviet troops no longer attempted a break-through. Nevertheless, some fighting continued. During period from 21 June to 7 July Soviets forces were able to fire 144,000 artillery and 92,000 mortar rounds, surprisingly near the numbers of Finnish artillery. This suggests that Soviet forces have had some logistics issues. Soviet field artillery of rifle divisions was also relatively light when 70-75% of guns were 76 mm while only 30% of Finnish field artillery was light. According to Soviet statistics the average fired field artillery shell in 1944 was just 12.5 kilos. In Tali-Ihantala, just like in Vuosalmi and U-line Finns concentrated one minute barrages where average weight of shells were 20-24 kilos. During period from 20 June to 7 July Finnish artillery ammo expenditure in sector of 18th Division, 6th Division and 3rd Brigade was total 113,500 rounds, in sector of 4th Division 24,600 and in sector of 3rd Division 25,150 rounds. Total 163,250 rounds of Finnish field artillery.

Losses Finnish sources estimate that the Soviet army lost about 600 tanks in the Battle of Tali- Ihantala, mainly to air attacks, artillery, and close defence weapons. Between 284 and 320 Soviet aircraft were shot down. The Finnish army reported that 8,561 men were wounded, missing, and/or killed in action. According to Finnish historian Ohto Manninen, the Soviets reported their losses as about 18,000‚Äì22,000 killed or wounded, based on the daily and 10-day summary casualty reports of the Soviet 21st Army. The uncertainty about casualties rises from the fact that 25 percent of the forces of the 21st Army didn't participate in the battle.Manninen, Ohto, Molotovin cocktail, Hitlerin sateenvarjo, 1994, , Painatuskeskus In addition to the losses of the Soviet 21st Army, the 6th Rifle Corps of the Soviet 23rd Army that attacked east of the 21st Army closer to Vuoksi waterway suffered 7905 casualties, of which 1458 were killed in action (KIA) and 288 missing in action (MIA), without taking the losses of its supporting formations into account. Impact The cease-fire between the Soviet Union and Finland began at 07:00, September 4, 1944, although for the following 24 hours the Red Army failed to comply with it.Part 12 End of Hostilities for the Continuation War According to historians Jowett & Snodgrass, Mcateer, Lunde, and Alanen & Moisala, the Battle of Tali- Ihantala, along with other Finnish victories (in the battles of Vyborg Bay, Vuosalmi, Nietj√§rvi, and Ilomantsi) achieved during the period, finally convinced the Soviet leadership that conquering Finland was proving difficult, and not worth the cost;Macteer (2009) p. 184Moisala & Alanen (1988) pp. 154‚Äì155, 258‚Äì261 the battle was possibly the single most important battle fought in the Continuation War, as it largely determined the final outcome of the war, allowing Finland to conclude the war with relatively favorable termsJakobson, Max, S√§kerhetspolitik och historia, 2007, , Hjalmarson & H√∂gbergs Bokf√∂rlag AB, Essay pp. 164‚Äì177 Avv√§rjningsegern, defensive victory and continue its existence as an autonomous, democratic, and independent nation.Lunde (2011) p. 379Moisala & Alanen (1988) p. 260 Finnish researchers state that Soviet sources, such as POW interviews, prove that the Soviets intended to advance all the way to Helsinki.Moisala & Alanen (1988) pp. 85, 152‚Äì154 There also existed an order from Stavka to advance far beyond the borders of 1940. According to Lunde, one of the reasons leading to the Soviet failure was the Finns were able to intercept the Soviet radio messages and to forewarn and prompt the Finnish Army to put up a firmly resolved defense.Lunde (2011) p. 306 Also, the existence of the Finnish Salpa Defence Line was an important factor in the peace negotiations in autumn 1944.http://www.battlevault.com/Events/Wolfkrieg-09/WK-09%20Player%20List_files/German/Rob_Prince_Hist.pdf Russian historian Nikolai Baryshnikov contests this mainstream view and has argued that such views exaggerate the significance and misrepresent the outcome of the Finnish defensive battles of 1944, including the Battle of Tali-Ihantala. According to him, conquering Finland was not one of the known goals of the Soviet offensive. According to General Shtemenko, the goal was to create a threat to Helsinki and other major political and economic centers in Finland, not conquer the country. According to Baryshnikov, after transferring most of their available forces to the Karelian Isthmus and receiving significant aid from Germany, the Finns managed to slow down and stop the Soviet offensive on the Isthmus before it reached the [1940 post- Winter War] Finnish border. This boosted the morale of the Finnish troops, who were previously constantly retreating. According to Baryshnikov, Finnish propaganda soon started talking about a victory, and after the war this claim of achieving a victory in stopping the Soviets from conquering Finland became an official theme in Finnish historiography. Baryshnikov's view is not supported by the vast majority of historians. Related operations On June 22, Soviet forces began a wide-front push into Eastern Poland and Belorussia. At the same time, the Soviet 59th Army attacked the islands in Vyborg Bay from July 4 on, and after several days of fighting forced the vastly outnumbered Finnish forces out from most of the islands while suffering heavy losses. However, the Soviet attack aimed at crossing Vyborg Bay was a failure as the Soviet troops were thrown back by the German 122nd Division of the V AK.Lunde (2011) p. 307Moisala & Alanen (1988) pp. 143‚Äì147 The Soviet 23rd Army attempted to start the crossing of the River Vuoksi on July 4 at Vuosalmi, but due to the Finnish defense at √Ñyr√§p√§√§ Ridge, it was unable to start the crossing before July 9.Moisala & Alanen (1988) pp. 147‚Äì152 Even with the crossing completed, the Soviet forces consisting of elements from three Soviet divisions were not able to expand the beachhead against the defending Finnish 2nd Division, which was later reinforced.Lunde (2011) pp. 308‚Äì309 The unsuccessful Soviet breakthrough attempts continued there until July 21. In addition to Tali-Ihantala, the Finnish front line held fast at Kivisilta and Tienhaara to the north of Vyborg Bay.Lunde (2011) p. 289Moisala & Alanen (1988) p. 134 There was further heavy fighting on the northeast side of Lake Ladoga, and in the Battle of Ilomantsi the Finns were able to encircle two Soviet divisions, though most of the troops were able to escape.Lunde (2011) p. 299Moisala & Alanen (1988) pp. 127‚Äì129 On July 12, Soviet troops received an order to stop their attempts to advance and to dig in. Soon, Finnish scouts noticed trains with empty cars advancing towards Vyborg to take troops away from the Finnish front. They were needed for the great push towards Berlin. The Finnish government declined further negotiations in late June and did not ask for peace until the Soviet offensive had been stopped. The Finnish government instead used the Ryti- Ribbentrop agreement to strengthen Finnish forces.Lunde (2011) pp. 303‚Äì304, 309, 314 Only after the Soviet offensive had been stopped on all primary fronts, was President Ryti ready to resign on July 28. He, together with leading social-democrat V√§in√∂ Tanner, requested that Commander-in-Chief Mannerheim accept the candidacy for president, thus freeing Finland from the Ryti-Ribbentrop agreement, which had only been made as a personal pledge of President Ryti. Finland then could ask the Soviet Union for peace.

It is situated in Padang Bulan, in the Medan Baru subdistrict of Medan, close to the City Centre, with a total area of 122 hectares. Due to an increase in the number of students, a new campus is being constructed in Kwala Bekala, about 15 kilometers away from the original campus, on an area of about 300 hectares.http://www.usu.ac.id/en/campus-location.html The rectors of the university serve an eight-year renewable term. USU was established as a Foundation Universitet North Sumatera on June 4, 1952. Initially, the foundation provided only one department, which was the Faculty of Medicine, established on August 20, 1952, now commemorated as the anniversary of USU. The first President of Indonesia, Sukarno, inaugurated USU on November 20, 1957, as the seventh state university in Indonesia. History The history of the University of North Sumatra began with the founding of North Sumatra Universitet Foundation on June 4, 1952. The establishment of the foundation was spearheaded by the Governor of North Sumatra to meet the wishes of the people of North Sumatra, Indonesia, in particular, and society, in general. The Foundation was managed by a Board, chaired by the Governor of North Sumatra, with the following composition: * Abdul Hakim Harahap (Chairman) * Dr. T. Mansoer (Vice Chairman) * Dr. Soemarsono (Secretary / Treasurer) * Members: ** Ir. R. S. Danunagoro ** Drh. Sahar ** Drg. Oh Tjie Lien ** Anwar Abubakar ** Madong Lubis ** Dr. Maas. J. Trees ** Drg. Barlan ** Soetan Paruhum Pane The desire to establish a public university in Medan began before the World War II, but it was not approved by the Dutch colonial government who ruled Indonesia at the time. During the Japanese occupation after the fall of the Dutch colonialism, some prominent people in the Indonesian medicine field, such as Dr. Pirngadi and Dr. T. Mansoer, drafted a plan for a medical school. After Indonesia declared its independence on August 17, 1945, the government appointed Dr. Mohd. Djamil in Bukit Tinggi as the chairman of the committee to establish the plan. However, another revolutionary war in 1947, that required the restoration of the sovereignty of the Indonesian government, delayed this plan. Then the North Sumatra Governor, Abdul Hakim, took the initiative to encourage the residents of North Sumatra province to raise the money to build the first public university in the region. On December 31, 1951, the preparatory committee to found the university was formed, chaired by Dr. Soemarsono. The members of the committee included Dr. Ahmad Sofian, Ir. Danunagoro, and Mr. Djaidin Antique as the secretary. Aside from the committee, the Leadership Council Foundation was also established. In its early years, the Organization of USU was consisted of the Board of Curators, the University President, the Assembly President and Assessors, the University Senate, and the Faculty Board. As a result of the cooperation, moral and material assistance from the entire community of the North Sumatera province at that time, including the Special Territory of Aceh, the Faculty of Medicine was successfully established on August 20, 1952. It was first housed in a building on Seram Street, with twenty-seven students, among them were two females. Afterward, the establishment of the Faculty of Law and Public Administration followed in 1954. The Faculty of Teaching and Science Education was found in 1956, along with the Faculty of Agriculture. On November 20, 1957, the first President of the Republic of Indonesia, Sukarno, inaugurated the University of North Sumatra (with \\"USU\\" as the acronym in the local language). It became the seventh state university in Indonesia. The inauguration date was set as the Dies Natalis USU (the anniversary of the University of North Sumatra), and commemorated every year until 2001. At the suggestion of several members of the University Senate, the date of the anniversary of the University of North Sumatra was then reviewed. The University Senate eventually decided that the date of the USU anniversary should be commemorated on August 20, considering that the university had conducted its very first lecture on August 20, 1952. With the approval of the Ministry of National Education, the University of North Sumatra commemorated its 50th anniversary on August 20, 2002. In 1959, the university started the Faculty of Engineering and the Faculty of Economics in Medan. It was also inaugurated by President Sukarno. A year later, in 1960, the university opened the Faculty of Economics and the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Husbandry in Kutaradja, Banda Aceh. Less than a decade after being founded, USU was already running seven departments: five faculties in Medan, North Sumatra, and two faculties in the Aceh province. So much progress had been achieved within a short time, with the implementation of various programs. Today the University of North Sumatra provides more than one hundred study programs, consisted of various levels of higher education, covered in ten faculties and one graduate department. During the process, some departments of the university have become the embryos of three public universities, namely the Syiah Kuala University in Banda Aceh, Aceh Province (the expansion of the Faculty of Economics and the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Husbandry); the Medan College of State Teachers and Trainings (the expansion of the Faculty of Teaching and Science Education); and the Medan Polytechnic College (the Polytechnic College of the University of North Sumatra).

Sir Henry Mather Jackson, 2nd Baronet, KC, DL (23 July 1831 ‚Äì 8 March 1881) was a British Liberal Party politician who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Coventry from 1867 to 1868, and from 1874 to 1881, when he became a High Court judge. Early life Jackson was the eldest son of the Sir William Jackson, 1st Baronet (1805‚Äì1876) of Birkenhead, a businessman who made his first fortune from palm oil imports, a second fortune in property development, before becoming an industrialist and railway entrepreneur and later a Liberal MP. His mother was Elizabeth n√©e Hughes, from Liverpool. He was educated at Harrow and at Trinity College, Oxford, where he graduated in 1853 with a B.A. in Classics. He was called to the bar in 1855 at Lincoln's Inn, and took silk in 1873. His address was listed in 1881 as Llantilio Court, Abergavenny, Monmouthshire. The house was located at Llantilio Crossenny, about six miles east of Abergavenny. Jackson had bought it in 1873 from Henry Morgan-Clifford, the former MP for Hereford, and after his death it remained the home of his son Sir Henry Mather Jackson, 3rd Baronet. The house was demolished in 1930, leaving only the foundations and undercroft, although the landscaped park remains. Llantilio Court and the baronetcy were inherited by his son, the 3rd Baronet, who was appointed in 1916 to a tribunal to consider appeals in Monmouthshire against conscription under the Military Service Act 1916. As Chairman of the Monmouthshire Appeals Tribunal, the third baronet was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in June 1918, for \\"services in connection with the war\\". Political career Jackson first stood for Parliament at the 1865 general election, when he was unsuccessful in his native borough of Birkenhead. After the death in 1867 of Morgan Treherne, one of the two MPs for Coventry, Jackson won the resulting by-election on 23 July 1867.Craig, op. cit., p. 100 The result was declared void after an election petition, but fellow Liberal Samuel Carter was elected in his place. When he and Jackson stood again at the 1868 general election, both seats were won by Conservatives. Jackson was returned to the House of Commons at the 1874 general election, and was re-elected in 1880. He was commissioned in June 1876 as a Deputy Lieutenant of Monmouthshire, a position also held from May 1885 by his son, Sir Henry Mather Jackson, 3rd Baronet.

The ship was laid down on 31 December 1943, launched on 21 August 1944, and completed and commissioned in December 1944. The ship served in World War II as a convoy escort in the Atlantic, and afterwards in the Indian Ocean. Decommissioned in May 1946, the ship was sold to New Zealand in 1948, and renamed '. The ship saw active service during the Korean War, and was finally sold for scrap in 1965. Service history After sea trials Loch Katrine joined the 20th Escort Group based at Derry on 25 January 1945 and was deployed as escort for a Gibraltar convoy. On her return in February the ship was transferred to 24th Escort Group as the Senior Officer's ship for further Gibraltar convoys until the German surrender in May. The Group was then deployed in the North-Western Approaches to escort surrendering U-boats to Lisahally as part of \\"Operation Deadlight\\". Loch Katrine returned to Derry to refit before departing in July with to join the East Indies Escort Force. The ships arrived at Colombo on 4 August, and took part in preparations for planned landings in Malaya (\\"Operation Zipper\\"). On 7 September Loch Katrine was at Singapore for the formal surrender ceremonies. Local convoy escort duties and patrols occupied her until December, when she sailed to Batavia to support military operations in Dutch East Indies. In 1946 she was deployed for convoy escort in the Malacca Strait and Bay of Bengal during repatriation operations, and carried out Air-Sea Rescue duty. In March she departed for the UK, arriving back at Portsmouth on 29 April to decommission, and was placed in Reserve. In 1947 her Pennant number was changed to F625. Loch Katrine was sold to the Royal New Zealand Navy for ¬£234,150 in 1948, and after refitting was commissioned into RNZN service at Portsmouth on 7 May 1949, and was renamed on the 16 May.

Turner's works, and his brothers were the artists Frederick Goodall (1822‚Äì1904), a Royal Academician, and Walter Goodall (1830‚Äì89). His sister Eliza Goodall (1827‚Äì1916) was also an artist. Edward Angelo was apprenticed to his father's office and his own artistic talents came to the fore in his teens when he won a silver medal, and praise from Clarkson Stanfield RA, at the Society of Arts for a picture of the landing of the Lord Mayor at Blackfriars Bridge. His work was exhibited at the Royal Watercolour Society. British Guiana Moritz Richard Schomburgk was commissioned by the Prussian government to map British Guiana's boundaries, accompanied by his brother Robert, who was to collect natural history specimens for the Royal Museum and the Botanical Gardens in Berlin. Richard was stricken by yellow fever shortly after his arrival in British Guiana. He and the expedition artist, W.L. Walton, returned to England. Goodall was chosen in 1841 as a replacement artist, receiving a salary of 150 pounds per annum and payment of his passage to Guiana. Goodall was to sketch the people, landscape, plants and animal life. The botanical watercolours that Goodall had made were exhibited in Berlin, and the sketches of the indigenous tribes, in London and Paris. All the illustrations were later donated to the Colonial Office, made their way to the Department of Manuscripts at the British Museum, and are now at the British Library.British Library, Add MS 16936-16939.

Biography Born in Mie Prefecture, Japan, Makoto Nagao graduated from Kyoto University in 1959, and received a master's degree in engineering in 1961 and a Ph.D. in engineering in 1966 from the university. In Kyoto University, he became an assistant professor in 1967, an associate professor in 1968, and a professor in 1973. He served as the 23rd president of Kyoto University (1997‚Äì2003). After retirement from the university, he was appointed to the director of National Diet Library in 2007 and held the position until 2012.

He is the first president of the Asia-Pacific Association for Machine Translation (AAMT), and in each year from 2006, AAMT Nagao Award is awarded to individuals or groups who made contribution to machine translation. Work Makoto Nagao is one of the first scientists who developed practical machine translation (MT) systems. Between 1982 and 1986, he led the Mu project which aimed at translations for technical papers and became the first successful MT system between English and Japanese. In addition, example-based machine translation, an important approach for MT, is the method proposed by him in the early 1980s. In 1984 he introduced the analogy principle into the machine translation, which is adapted to the translation between two totally different languages, such as Japanese and English. He is also a pioneer of natural language processing (NLP) for the Japanese language. In 1994, he created KNP, a dependency analyzer for Japanese, with Sadao Kurohashi.Sadao Kurohashi and Makoto Nagao. 1994. KN Parser : Japanese Dependency/Case Structure Analyzer.

It is responsible for formulation and implementation of promotional and developmental measures for growth of the industrial sector, keeping in view the national priorities and socio-economic objectives. While individual administrative ministries look after the production, distribution, development and planning aspects of specific industries allocated to them, DPIIT is responsible for the overall industrial policy. It is also responsible for facilitating and increasing the foreign direct investment (FDI) flows to the country. The Department in its current form came into being on 27 January 2019, when the erstwhile Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion was renamed to Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) after internal trade was added to its mandate. The current Minister is Piyush Goyal while the top bureaucrat is Secretary Guruprasad Mohapatra. History The Department was originally established in 1995, and was reconstituted in the year 2000 with the merger of Department of Industrial Development. DPIIT is the nodal Department in Government of India for coordinating and implementing programmes with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) in India. The Department also coordinates with apex Industry Associations such as Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Confederation of Indian Industry, ASSOCHAM in their activities relating to promotion of industrial cooperation and to stimulate FDI into India. Responsibilities=Stimulating InvestmentsNew Industrial Policy= It is currently working to frame a new industrial policy, to be the third such policy in India since its independence in 1947. However, the deadline for completing the policy has been repeatedly pushed back since January, 2018. =India Investment Grid= The department has created an online portal called the India Investment Grid (IIG), an interactive investment portal providing details of sectors, states and projects in which domestic and foreign investors may sink in capital. in association with Invest India,https://www.investindia.gov.in/ India's national investment and facilitation agency. The initiative not only allows investors across the globe to easily search, identify and track investment worthy projects, but also allows promoters to highlight their projects along with requirements like funds, technology and collaboration needs with global audience. Boosting Startup growth The department is the nodal body for the Startup India initiative, which aims to make India a hub for startups. It aims to discard restrictive States Government policies within this domain, such as License Raj, Land Permissions, Foreign Investment Proposals, and Environmental Clearances. According to the government, the focus areas include reduction in patent registration fees, freedom from mystifying inspections for first 3 years of operation, freedom from Capital Gain Tax for first 3 of operation, as well as self-certification compliance. The government has loosed the norms for startups and their backers to seek exemption from Angel Tax. But the tax remains. Almost 14,000 startups have been registered by DPIIT through its portal. Framing E-Commerce Rules The department is currently framing the e-commerce policy, a set of rules aimed at streamlining and regulating the digital business ecosystem. Intellectual Property Rights DPIIT is also responsible for intellectual property rights relating to patents, designs, trademarks, and Geographical indication of goods and oversees the initiative relating to their promotion and protection. Criticism=Falling FDI growth However, the Department has faced criticism for not publishing FDI figures since June, 2018, despite the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) providing it with regular inputs. Earlier, this data was published every quarter. This happens at a time the country has seen inbound FDI dropping for the first time under the Narendra Modi government, Business Standard newspaper has revealed. The DPIIT compiles total investment inflows with the data from the RBI as well as its own databases. The last time they published this data was in August last year; that was for the April‚ÄìJune period. Officials at the department refused to explain why the data had not been released. Low Startup competitiveness Media has pointed out the policy has failed to boost job growth while most startups were unable to receive what they wanted most, tax exemptions.

The policy has been criticised as a way of dismissing committed and loyal soldiers and to avoid providing suitable pensions or redundancy compensation. Motivation Manning control was created to allow the army to maintain a balance of experience and to ensure that there were opportunities for talented soldiers to progress through the ranks. It was originally designed to review soldiers' careers at six, nine and 12-year points of service and to free up the promotional logjam in the junior NCO ranks of corporal and lance-corporal. If a soldier was not progressing through the ranks they may be redeployed or dismissed. The regulations are defined in para 9.413 of Queen's Regulations 1975. A similar system is used by the United States Armed Forces, which insists that certain ranks be held for no longer than a set amount of time, with lack of promotion in that time being used as grounds for dismissal. History Manning Control was first introduced in the late 1950s to reduce the numbers of soldiers in the British Army after conscription ended. It was suspended in the 1970s and 80s. The policy resumed in 1993 after 34,600 redundancies in the UK Armed Forces with almost half from the army taking redundancy after the Cold War. The Territorial Army (TA) was also cut from 57,000 to around 40,000 people. The redundancies caused under-manning in various trades and a huge black hole in the Ministry of Defense (MOD) budget as many more soldiers opted for the attractive redundancy package than expected. Weeks later, soldiers who had taken the redundancy package were back in uniform at the request of the MOD for a short period, to ameliorate what was hoped to be a temporary manpower shortage. The contract used was an S/Type contract used primarily for the TA soldier and called a Type S contract if a TA member wished to serve with a regular battalion. Soldiers who joined the Army in the 90s signed on for 22 years, with an option to leave after three, six or nine years. At the end of their 22 years, they receive an immediate pension for life. Lists of soldiers subject to Manning Control were being sent by APC Glasgow, the Army administrative wing, even when there was a well reported shortfall in Army manning. Soon more and more soldiers were falling victim to the \\"Brown envelope\\" as it was known. Soldiers who are regarded as excellent in their reports were pressured into leaving the Army \\"voluntarily\\" or signing a new \\"S-type engagement\\" contract and giving up the prospect of an immediate pension when they left. Forms such as the AFB130A application against the soldiers discharge were negated from the process, preventing the soldier from making a representation against the Manning Control order until it was too late. The absence of the form also hid the real number of soldiers subject to Manning Control from the Defence Analytical Services Agency as most soldiers would \\"jump ship\\" rather than it be known on their record of service that they were forced out. This was later admitted by Geoff Hoon the secretary of state for defence in a letter to Paul Keetch the Liberal Democrat defence spokesman. Controversy A soldier from the Parachute Regiment, Corporal Paul Biddiss, was told in November 1999 by his Commanding Officer Lt Col Kennett that he would be manning controlled. He refused to sign off his old contract as it was alleged he should never have been subject to the system; it is believed he was the first soldier to refuse. He won his fight against the system and is still a serving soldier. This was the turning point for Manning Control due mainly to the treatment Cpl Biddiss and his family were alleged to have endured during the Manning Control process. This generated media attention to what was until then an unknown system of mass discharging of soldiers, allegedly for their pension rights. On 29 Apr 2002, Michael Smith, defence correspondent of The Daily Telegraph, Tom Newton Dunn, defence editor of the Daily Mirror and Andrew Gilligan from the Radio 4 Today programme, publicized the case of Cpl Paul Biddiss, in a combined effort and with the campaigning solicitor Thomas Reah, who later went on to help establish the British Armed Forces Federation under the leadership of Douglas Young. Tom Reah campaigned for the change in pension rights for the partner of an SAS soldier who was killed rescuing British hostages in Sierra Leone. The Liberal Democrats defence spokesman Paul Keetch called for the immediate suspension of the scheme, known as \\"manning control\\" and an inquiry into its administration. Mr Breed from the Liberal Democrats defence team stated that During the next few months more and more stories were being reported about alleged abuse of the system by former soldiers. During Parliamentary questions the Ministry of Defence admitted that hundreds of medically unfit soldiers were thrown out of the Army rather than being given medical discharges, in an apparent contravention of its own rules. The Army admitted it had used Manning Control to throw out soldiers who should have been Medically Discharged. The admission came in a written answer from Adam Ingram, the Armed Forces minister, who said 259 soldiers, who were medically downgraded to a point where they could no longer carry out their roles, had been sacked since 1997. A number of the medically unfit soldiers were sacked under the \\"manning control\\" system that allowed the Army to discharge soldiers it did not want. Medically Discharged. It was used to discharge hundreds of soldiers who had done nothing wrong, in an apparent attempt to ensure they did not qualify for an immediate pension. An unnamed serving soldier told Channel 4 News he believed the Army was forcing servicemen to ‚Äújump before they are pushed‚Äù in a bid to save money\\". The Army was facing a class action by hundreds of former soldiers alleging that they were sacked or forced out under the manning control system to stop them attaining the length of service that would have entitled them to an immediate pension. Soon after, Manning Control was suspended but it is expected to be reintroduced, raising questions as to whether soldiers wounded in Afghanistan will find themselves \\"brown-enveloped\\". In December 2007, BAFF discovered a plan to sack Gurkhas early to reduce their pension rights using Manning Control. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) is facing legal action over plans to cut the pensions of Gurkhas by sacking them three years before they are due to leave the army. The move, which means the MoD will avoid having to pay an ordinary Gurkha soldier more than ¬£200,000, is to be challenged in the courts by the British Armed Forces Federation (BAFF). When Bill Rammell, the Secretary of State for Defence, was asked in parliament how many soldiers subject to manning control are (a) awaiting discharge and (b) have been discharged since 2007, he responded \\"No soldiers have been discharged under Manning Control Points since 2002, and no soldiers are awaiting discharge\\". Prime Minister David Cameron, answering MPs' questions following his Statement on the SDSR, gave the assurance that the resulting reductions in the numbers of service personnel would not involve the use of manning control instead of \\"proper redundancy payments\\". Against a historic background of injustice to some individuals during earlier times of financial stringency and forces downsizing, BAFF welcomes this important confirmation by the PM and looks to the MoD and service authorities to ensure that it is not overlooked in practice.

Players control their character via pointing and clicking on the screen in various areas to navigate the player character to the point where they click. Most items are activated either simply by running into them, or by pressing a button that will appear when the point is reached (when outside of battle). Battles are presented in two ways, Mecha battles and energy blade battles, both battle styles are similar to a traditional RPG in that much of its game play revolves around fighting enemies in a turn based system. Mecha Battles features a set of many types of attacks but the player must spend energy points to use them. G.E.A.R.S. University Houses G.E.A.R.S. University Houses are groups that the players can join so they can participate in competitive activities. There are three houses available for players to join: house WolfBlade holds G.E.A.R.S. warriors and heroes, house of RuneHawk is a refuge for science and magic alike, and house of MystRaven is for tricksters who enjoy pranks and shenanigans. Plot The player controls a mecha pilot from an unknown location and the game begins with the player on a starship that's heading towards the planet Loreon so he/she can attend G.E.A.R.S. University in Soluna City. After joining the university the player is educated and trained in the art of mecha and energy blade combat. The player soon discovers the threat that is posed by the Shadowscythe empire, who plans to assimilate the entire Galaxy, so the player sets out to stop the Shadowscythe evil plans. Holiday events MechQuest has several recurring holiday events. These include New Years Day, Valentine's Day, April Fools' Day Halloween(named \\"Mogloween\\" in game), Christmas (named Frostval in game), Friday the 13th, Talk Like a Pirate Day and Thanksgiving. Critical reception Nic Stransky complimented the graphics and simplicity of the game, but wrote that melee could feel inconsistent and that players may wish for more strategy.

Contents  \\"The Daisy\\" tells of happy little daisy who is taken up with a plot of earth to line the bottom of a bird cage where a lark is held captive. When he dies and is given an elaborate funeral by the children, she is cast into the road and forgotten. She alone loved the lark, took joy in his song, and felt his suffering as her own. \\"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\\" (Den standhaftige tinsoldat) is the story of a tin soldier who loves a paper ballerina. He falls from the parlor window, and, after sailing in a paper boat down a storm drain, is swallowed by a fish. Eventually he is returned to the parlor table where still stands the ballerina. A boy throws the soldier into the fire and a draught carries the ballerina to his side. They perish together; he is melted into a tin heart. In \\"The Wild Swans\\" (De vilde svaner), a princess mutely undergoes the most dreadful trials in order to free her eleven brothers from a spell cast by an evil queen. When suspicions are aroused that she is a witch, she is sentenced to death but rescues her brothers at the last moment. Able then to speak, she tells her story and the king marries her.

He performance as a judge found him more favour with his electorate, for in 1637 he was elected to the parliament (Sejm) where he presided for many years. He also became a podkomorzy (chamberlain) of Kiev and exerted significant influence in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth politics. He worked to enhance his family fortune, centred in Horoszki, and through acquisitions and other means his estates grew to include 14 cities and 50 villages with 7600 serfs, so by 1648 he had the second largest territory in the Ukraine, after the Wi≈õniowiecki family. A Polish Brethren, Niemirycz defended his fellow Arians in court and in parliament in the 1640s,Williams, George Huntston (1980). The Polish Brethren: Documentation of the History and Thought of Unitarianism in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and in the Diaspora, 1601-1685. and supported a fellow Protestant George II R√°k√≥czi as candidate for the Polish-Lithuanian throne in 1648, when king W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Vasa died in the mist of war. Because of the Cossack Uprising of 1648 he had to evacuate his family to Warsaw, and took limited part in fighting against the rebellious Cossacks and serfs, advocating moderation (along the lines of Kiev voivode Adam Kisiel). He returned to his estates in 1649 but the massacre of Polish army by the Cossacks and Crimean Tatars at Batoh (Battle of Batih) in 1652 forced him to evacuate again, this time to his estates in Volhynia. During the Deluge, like many Polish‚ÄìLithuanian nobles and magnates (both Catholic and Protestant), he embraced the Swedish invaders in 1655, clearly in hopes of improving the Protestant position in the Commonwealth and reconquering his estates in the Ukrainian palatines.Stone, Daniel (2001). The Polish-Lithuanian State, 1386-1795. Seattle: University of Washington Press. His pleadings for improvement of Polish Brethren cause with the Swedish king Charles X Gustav of Sweden failed and he eventually switched side to the Cossacks side. He took place in the preparation of the Treaty of Radnot (partition of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth amongst five signatories: Charles X Gustav, Gy√∂rgy R√°k√≥czi II of Transylvania, Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, and Bogus≈Çaw Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç), signed in 1656. In 1657 he moved to Cossack Ukraine and Cossack hetman Khmelnytsky had his estates restored to him. He supported Ivan Vyhovsky, as Khmelnytsky's successor, and signed in Korsun, jointly with Ivan Bohun and Ivan Kovalivsky, an agreement between Sweden and Cossack Hetmanate in 1657.Kotljarchuk, Andrej (2006). In the Shadows of Poland and Russia. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Sweden in the European Crisis of the mid-17th Century. S√∂dert√∂rns H√∂gskola. During that time, when he envisioned a semi-independent duchy of Ukraine as a new element of Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth and where there was no place for a Polish Brethren statesman, Nemirycz decided to convert to Orthodoxy and he encouraged his fellow Polish Brethren to do the same in an infamous (Skrypt), Exhortation to all Dissidents from the Romish Religion to Take Refuge in the Bosom of the Greek Church. He was a co-author of the Treaty of Hadiach, signed in 1658, which established the Grand Duchy of Ruthenia, transforming the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth into the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian‚ÄìRuthenian Commonwealth. He drafted the treaty, and, as the Chancellor of the Grand Duchy of Ruthenia, headed the Ukrainian delegation to the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian parliamentary session for ratification, where it was ratified. In 1659 the Muscovite Tsardom refused to accept the new Commonwealth and invaded Ukraine, but Russian army was defeated at the battle of Konotop, but through conspiracies, betrayals, and money Russian achieved the cancellation of Vyhovsky‚Äôs hetman position by the Cossacks of \\"black council\\", and caused a rebellion of the serfs and pro-Russian Cossacks and these rebels killed Yuri Nemyrych in a minor engagement, allegedly he was stabbed 70 times in the chest. Thus ingloriously died a statesman, whom Moscow named the greatest heretic and outlaw. Gudzyk, Klara (2007). Sad date. The Day Weekly Digest, 2007. Family He and his sole wife El≈ºbieta S≈Çupecka, Rawa coat of arms, (died 1660) had three children: Tomasz (died young), Barbara (she had two husbands), and finally Teodor Nemyrych(1648‚Äì1700), who finally restored family estates but never achieved any prominence and whose family converted to Roman Catholicism.

AdventureQuest Worlds has events on special occasions. A new event is added to the game every other Friday. Some events are one time only while others are seasonal events that appear once every year. Often, participants in these events can procure event-specific items not available at any other time in the game. There is an anniversary on October 10 which enables the players to partake in the birthday-themed events and have access to the Underground Lab. Some events feature live events with guest stars like Korn, Voltaire, One-Eyed Doll, George Lowe, Paul and Storm, Jonathan Coulton, the cast of Ctrl+Alt+Del, Ayi Jihu, ArcAttack, They Might Be Giants, Andrew Huang, Mia J. Park, The Cr√ºxshadows, Dreamers, and Michael Sinterniklaas as the voice of Deady. The game is set in a universe similar to those in AdventureQuest, DragonFable, and MechQuest. It was established that the Eternal Dragon of Time allowed the dragonslayer Galanoth to slay him which resulted in the hourglasses within the Dragon of Time's heart to shatter and the sands that represented the three worlds within each hourglass to merge resulting in the AdventureQuest Worlds universe being created. The goal of the game is to adventure through Lore, move on to higher levels, face the 13 Lords of Chaos, and fight Drakath: Champion of Chaos. As the story progresses, the player meets the Queen of Monsters who chose Drakath to be her Champion, and Malgor, the Queen's rival that wishes to end the constant cycle of war and conflict on Lore. Plot=Prologue The player character, known simply as 'Hero' arrives in the midst of a war between two factions, the Evil and the Good. Summoned by the Good army, the hero is tasked to aid in the battle against the undead led by , commander and ruler of Evil. In the town of Oaklore, undead forces have begun plaguing its residents. Among other soldiers, the hero faces off against the undead attacking Oaklore and makes their way to an elite Evil soldier known as the Dread Dragon deeper in battle. Having defeated the Dread Dragon, the hero continues their journey to Swordhaven, capital of Lore where King Alteon, leader of the Good army and his remaining forces fend against another invasion by the undead. Relentless assaults by the undead allows Sepulchure and his elite group of undead to enter the castle and battle the king, Alteon. Drakath, later introduced as the Champion of Chaos, interrupts the personal combat and strikes the two away from each other infecting them with a sickness known as Chaorruption. Agitated by the sudden interruption, Sepulchure decides to attack Drakath in spite of his weakened state and fails as Drakath counters and eventually kills him. The hero and corrupted Alteon watching the scene unfold are spared by Drakath. Sepulchure's death alerts his daughter Gravelyn. Now the new ruler of the Evil forces, the grieving empress swears to avenge her father's death by defeating Drakath. With a common enemy, this led to the truce between the Good and Evil empires. 13 Lords of Chaos Saga There are already signs of corruption in the nearby forest and marsh causing the player to capture the Chaorrupted Wolves, Chaorrupted Bear, and Chaos Spiders alongside some antidote-based plants to be studied. Drakath forms the 13 Lords of Chaos by recruiting the mage Escherion, the Drow Dragonlord Vath, the Y≈çkai Shogun Kitsune, the Werepyre Wolfwing, and singer Kimberly Freeman. They are instructed to unleash their Chaos Beasts upon Lore, which the player has to defeat one by one. The 7th Lords of Chaos Ledgermayne later rebels against Drakath and instead moves towards causing Lore's destruction. When the hero fights him, Drakath suddenly deals the finishing blow and reveals that he will be saving Alteon and the hero for last, before fleeing. Then the players take on the Chaos Djinn Tibicenas in the Sandsea. In Bloodtusk Ravine, mass confusion and hysteria (partly due to the Chaos Lords Xing and Xang interfering) arises between the Horcs and the Trolls as it is revealed that one of the Lords of Chaos is among them and is sending Chaorrupted monsters to them. It is soon revealed that the Troll Krellenos is the Lord of Chaos in question, but he is quickly killed by Khasaanda, who absorbs his Chaorruption and becomes the new Chaos Lord. Khasaanda, seeking vengeance, begins to hunt down Drakath. Drakath quickly shows up, and offers the hero the choice of either sparing Khasaanda to continue her goal to kill Drakath, or to defeat her due to being a Chaos Lord that could potentially disrupt Lore. Khasaanda then goes off to find Drakath herself, regardless of the choice made. The hero then ventures into the Span, where they meet the chronomancer Iadoa. Iadoa has recently been made the a new Lord of Chaos, but he is trying to use his time to mentor the hero before he succumbs to the Chaorruption. Iadoa tells the story of Galanoth slaying the Eternal Dragon of Time to the hero, while motivating them to finally defeat Drakath. Iadoa ultimately fails to resist the Chaorruption, and is soon forced to be defeated by the hero. After a period of time, Maximillian Lionfang kidnaps the hero's allies, viewing them to be against the forces of Good. Gravelyn and the hero then intervene and rescue them via leading an attack on his tower. Lionfang is ultimately defeated, but not before he is made into the eleventh Chaos Lord by Drakath. Lionfang then attacks Falguard, seeking the Tears of the Mother to end Chaos. While he is briefly tricked into retrieving a fake replica, he soon retrieves the real vial of the Tears and throws it at Drakath. As the Champion of Chaos and not a mere Chaos Lord, Drakath shrugs it off. Lionfang, in a fit of fury, accuses the hero of lying and fights them. After the conflict, the hero soon discovers that Drakath plans to activate runes on the Chaos Portal upon the defeat of each Chaos Lord in order to free his master, the Queen of Monsters. Lionfang is then sent falling, but his body is nowhere to be found. The hero then ventures into the Mirror World, where they learn that the Xang in Lore is, in fact, the Xang from the Mirror Realm, rendering both Xing and Xang evil and causing an imbalance. Right as Xing and Xang are about to merge into Xiang, the hero manages to send Lore's Xang through the portal, causing balance to return with the help of Mirror Drakath. The fusion is still successful, but during the final fight with Xiang, Xang takes over and attempts to help the hero, before Xing regains control. This ultimately ends with Xiang's defeat. Meanwhile in Swordhaven, Alteon begins to succumb to his own Chaorruption from the clash in the intro, and soon becomes the 12th Lord of Chaos. Alteon then lays waste to Swordhaven, before he begs the hero to kill him to put an end to his destruction. The hero then ventures up to Mount Doomskull to confront Drakath once and for all, fighting off hordes of Chaorrupted monsters in the process while noting that the 13th Lord of Chaos hasn't shown up yet. The seemingly final confrontation ends with Drakath being the victor, and he Chaorrupts the hero as the 13th Lord of Chaos. The hero, driven mad by the Chaorruption, attacks various locations in Lore. They soon manage to awaken their Chaos Beast, the Eternal Dragon of Time. Using some of its abilities, they summon all of the previous Chaos Beasts to lead Lore to its destruction. However, the hero becomes so mad with power that they ultimately decide to vanquish the Chaos Beasts they summoned and usurp Drakath. Drakath then reveals that the hero and the Eternal Dragon of Time are one and the same, before killing the hero. The hero, now trapped within Death's realm, makes a deal with Nulgath to defeat Death himself and thus become the new Death. Meanwhile, Gravelyn and the rest of the alliance lead an attack on Drakath's forces. With the deal's conditions fulfilled, the hero escapes and confronts Drakath for the final battle. During the final conflict, Drakath manages to kill the first Chaos Lord Escherion (who was turned into a frog) and Khasaanda, the last Chaos Lords that needed to be defeated in order to complete the ritual to summon the Queen of Monsters. When in the Chaos Realm, the hero fights the revived Chaos versions of the 13 Lords of Chaos including their clone as the 13th Lord of Chaos. Drakath is ultimately defeated, but is left alive by the hero within the Chaos Realm (and is later revealed to have escaped to fight the Queen's forces). The hero then ventures out of the portal, entering a world terrorized by the Queen. Queen of Monsters: Ancient Evils saga Now that the Queen of Monsters has been freed, she plans to raise each of the eight Elemental Titans that are scattered across the shattered continent of Drakonus. The Elemental Titans were created by the Elemental Avatars to represent them. As not all of the Elemental Titans were consent with their roles where they stepped on lesser creatures and fought dragons, the Elemental Avatars put the Elemental Titans to sleep in the different parts of Drakonus. The Queen of Monsters plans to use her minions to awaken all eight of the Elemental Titans so that a new era can begin. During the struggle with one of her generals, Tyndarius, Sepulchure's spirit regenerates and possesses the fire dragon Akriloth's body. After this fusion is defeated, his spirit leaves, with another fragment awakening within Gravelyn's Doomblade. After Phedra: Elemental Titan of Fire and Gaiazor: Elemental Titan of Earth are awakened, a minion of the Queen of Monsters asks if they would awaken the Elemental Titan of Darkness. The Queen of Monsters dismisses that idea and states that they will take \\"another path,‚Äù which is later revealed to be the Queen‚Äôs army of Infernals from the Infernal Realm stealing Celestial weaponry in order to make themselves more powerful. The Infernal army then invades Lore, ultimately forcing Gravelyn, the hero, and their allies to escape as both Shadowfall and Swordhaven are invaded. Throne of Darkness saga The Mysterious Stranger gathers Vaden the Death Knight, Vath's daughter Xeight, Ziri the Sneevil Daemon, Drakel Warlord Pax, Pharaoh of the Black Hole Sun Sekt, and Queen Scarletta Tyrall at their castle lair to learn about their encounters with the players. Following the story of the sentient table Plank who mentioned how he, Dr. Dryden Darkwood, and their Trolluk servant Skudly had captured the players, the Mysterious Figure is seemingly revealed to be Dr. Dryden Darkwood as they tell the assembled villains that they have the hero in their dungeon. When the players defeat Dr. Darkwood and Skudly, they borrow Dr. Darkwood's hooded robe and pose as him in order to listen to the villains' story. Upon unmasking themselves, the players defeat the vengeful villains and return their cursed items to them in exchange that they listen to his proposition to help them against a greater darkness. The villains agree to the terms while Plank has an idea on who the threat is. The final image shows Sepulchure's helm. Book of Monsters saga At the time when the players are fighting the Queen of Monsters' forces, a rift opens in the Neverglades as the Elder Monster called Extriki the Destroyer emerges and renders the surrounding areas toxic. When the players defeat, capture, and interrogate the toxic monster Zognax, it tells the players that Extriki and the monsters that came from the Rift thrive on toxic and can't survive in non- toxic location. In addition, Zognax states that Extriki is one of the Queen of Monsters' earlier children. With help from the Heart of the Grove from Brightoak, the players are able to weaken Extriki and slay it. Then the players deal with Kolyaban the Reshaper who is the Queen of Monsters' oldest daughter and the first Darkblood as she reshapes some creatures and the pet vendor Aria. Her appearance causes a Darkblood civil war where the players free Aria from Kolyaban's control and defeat Kolyaban who escapes. Aria, meanwhile, meets with the Avatar of Nature, who eventually grants her the ability to reshape herself as the Champion of Nature. Shadows of War saga After a period of months, another rift suddenly opens, with the hero being sent to investigate while storming the Queen of Monsters' lair. They immediately stumble upon Malgor and his Shadowflame army, the former of which reveals that the hero killed the Queen of Monsters as Malgor holds her head, but the hero is unable to recall these events. Malgor then offers the hero to join him in his goal to unify everyone into his forces and put an end to the cycle of war in Lore. Varga: Goddess of War intervenes and rescues the hero, before mentoring them on having them remember some of their abilities as the Eternal Dragon of Time they forgot. After besting Malgor's minion Shadowknight Gar, the hero then begins to gather allies that were previously working for Malgor‚Äôs army while fighting off hordes of his forces throughout Lore. They gain allies like the Pirate Queen Teja, the Kittarian cat burglar Jinx, and the Spirit Mage Mahou. Reception Kotaku's Mike Fahey praised the idea of using advertisements when the player died. Pete Davison, from GamePro, also noted the advertisements at death, calling it an \\"interesting\\" idea.

The Belles are Oxford University's original all-female a cappella group. Established in 1995 to combat Oxford's male dominated music scene, the Belles are known for their 'sassy attitude' and 'kickass arrangements' of girl power anthems. Since 1995, the Belles have enjoyed success on both a national and international level, having been on tours to New York City and Los Angeles as well as completing annual runs at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. The group performs on a regular basis in and around Oxford and London, primarily at balls and charity events,The Oxford Belles perform at 'Wadstock' occasionally with other Oxford University a cappella groups such as The Oxford Gargoyles and Out of the Blue.The Oxford Belles perform with The Oxford Gargoyles, 2003‚Äì2004 The Oxford Belles perform with Out of the Blue  History  The Belles were formed in 1995 by Helen Whiteley, a year-long visiting student from the University of Virginia, who had previously sung with The Virginia Belles. Helen was eager to continue the a cappella tradition, hugely popular in the US, on the east side of the Atlantic. In the 2008 quarterfinals of the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella, the Belles were awarded prizes for Best Choreography (for their rendition of Blondie's \\"One Way Or Another\\"), and Lauren Bensted was awarded the prize for Best Arrangement. In the semi-finals, Joanna Langilie's solo in \\"One Way Or Another\\" was highly commended.2008 results for International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella In 2009, the Belles reached the final of The Voice Festival UK (VF-UK), which established them for that year as the most successful all-female a cappella group in the UK.Results from the 2009 VFUK competition In 2009, the group travelled to New York.The Oxford Belles busking in Times Square on WorldNews There, they were offered the opportunity to sing the American national anthem at Madison Square Gardens,\\"The Oxford Belles performing at Madison Square Gardens\\", WorldNews, 6 October 2009. and also performed at the Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital.

Function  Heart-type Fatty Acid-Binding Protein (H-FABP) is a small cytoplasmic protein (15 kDa) released from cardiac myocytes following an ischemic episode. Like the nine other distinct FABPs that have been identified, H-FABP is involved in active fatty acid metabolism where it transports fatty acids from the cell membrane to mitochondria for oxidation. See FABP3 for biochemical details. The intracellular fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) belongs to a multigene family. FABPs are divided into at least three distinct types, namely the hepatic-, intestinal- and cardiac-type. They form 14-15 kDa proteins and are thought to participate in the uptake, intracellular metabolism and/or transport of long-chain fatty acids. They may also be responsible in the modulation of cell growth and proliferation. Fatty acid-binding protein 3 gene contains four exons and its function is to arrest growth of mammary epithelial cells. This gene is also a candidate tumor suppressor gene for human breast cancer.  Interactions  FABP3 is known to interact with TNNI3K in the context of interacting with cardiac troponin I. The protein also interacts with, VPS28, KIAA159,NUP62, PLK1, UBC, and Xpo1. In HIV, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the immunosuppressive domain (amino acids 574-592) of HIV-1 gp41 downregulates the expression of fatty acid binding protein 3 (FABP3) in peptide-treated PBMCs. Clinical significance=Diagnostic potential  H-FABP is a sensitive biomarker for myocardial infarction and can be detected in the blood within one to three hours of the pain. The diagnostic potential of the biomarker H-FABP for heart injury was discovered in 1988 by Professor Jan Glatz (Maastricht, Netherlands). H-FABP is 20 times more specific to cardiac muscle than myoglobin, it is found at 10-fold lower levels in skeletal muscle than heart muscle and the amounts in the kidney, liver and small intestine are even lower again. H-FABP is recommended to be measured with troponin to identify myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndrome in patients presenting with chest pain. H-FABP measured with troponin shows increased sensitivity of 20.6% over troponin at 3‚Äì6 hours following chest pain onset. This sensitivity may be explained by the high concentration of H-FABP in myocardium compared to other tissues, the stability and solubility of H-FABP, its low molecular weight; 15kDa compared to 18, 80 and 37kDa for MYO, CK-MB and cTnT respectively, its rapid release into plasma after myocardial injury ‚Äì 60 minutes after an ischemic episode, and its relative tissue specificity. Similarly this study showed that measuring H-FABP in combination with troponin increased the diagnostic accuracy and with a negative predictive value of 98% could be used to identify those not suffering from MI at the early time point of 3‚Äì6 hours post chest pain onset. The effectiveness of using the combination of H-FABP with troponin to diagnose MI within 6 hours is well reported.  Prognostic potential  In addition to its diagnostic potential, H-FABP also has prognostic value. Alongside D-dimer, NT-proBNP and peak troponin T, it was the only cardiac biomarker that proved to be a statistically significant predictor of death or MI at one year. This prognostic information was independent of troponin T, ECG and clinical examination. The risk associated with raised H-FABP is dependent upon its concentration. Patients who were TnI negative but H-FABP positive had 17% increased risk of all cause mortality within one year compared to those patients who were TnI positive but H-FABP negative. Currently these TnI positive patients are prioritised for angioplasty, and the TnI negative patients are considered to be of a lower priority, yet the addition of the H-FABP test helps identify patients who are currently slipping through the net and allows physicians to more appropriately manage this hidden high risk group. If both biomarkers were negative, there is 0% mortality at 6 months, in the authors own words this ‚Äúrepresents a particularly worthwhile clinical outcome, especially because it was observed in patients admitted into hospital for suspected ACS.‚Äù H-FABP indicates risk across the ACS spectrum including UA, NSTEMI or STEMI where low H-FABP concentrations confer low risk whereas high H-FABP concentrations indicate patients who are at a much higher risk of future events.  H-FABP in other diseases  H-FABP has been proven to significantly predict 30-day mortality in acute pulmonary embolism. H-FABP is more effective than Troponin T in risk stratifying Chronic Heart Failure patients. H-FABP is beginning to create interest with researchers who have found emerging evidence that indicates a role in differentiating between different neurodegenerative diseases.  H-FABP Point of care testing  To obtain diagnostic and prognostic information a precise and fully quantitative measurement of H-FABP is required. Commercial tests include a Cardiac Array on Evidence MultiStat; and an automated biochemistry assay (both by Randox Laboratories Ltd.).

He was also a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, and at the time of the dissolution of Nazi Germany, the last adjutant to Adolf Hitler of the army (Heeresadjutant). Career Johannmeyer was born in Iserlohn, Westphalia, on 27 July 1915.Eberle&Uhl;, p. 536 After Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1933, he joined the SS(No. 262992). In 1936, he was assigned to the 64th Infantry Regiment as Cadet (Fahnenjunker) and within 2 years, he rose to the rank of Leutnant.http://www.lexikon-der- wehrmacht.de/Personenregister/J/JohannmeyerW.htm World War II On the Eastern Front, the 503rd Infantry Regiment was involved in the defensive battle of Nevel (south of Pskov Oblast, near Belorussia). In this sector, Johannmeyer distinguished himself with notable action during the fighting in March 1943, and was awarded the 329thCarius, pp. 56-57 Oak Leaves (Eichenlaub) to the Knight's Cross on 18 November 1943. On 25 November, his battalion attacked Soviet positions near the town of Sergeytsevo (northwest of Nevel) with the aid of the 502nd Heavy Tank Battalion in a forest. Otto Carius, a Tiger I tank commander of the battalion, recalled in his memoirs that Johannmeyer was struck by sniper fire in the lungs from a Soviet marksman hidden in tree foliage. Initially, Johannmeyer was thought to have a limited chance of survival, but he managed to survive. Carius wrote 'he was relieved to hear from Johannmeyer while he was in hospital in 1944'. Johannmeyer was absent from his official Oak Leaves award ceremony as his condition was still considered critical. Shortly thereafter, on 1 December, Johamnmeyer was promoted to the rank of major. On 1 March 1944, Johannmeyer was called to a training course for senior officer adjutants, and 3 months later was transferred to the OKH (Oberkommando des Heeres, Army High Command). From August 1944 onwards, he served in the Army Personnel department (Heerespersonalamt), with the rank of Oberstleutnant i.G. (im Generalstab). Hitler's Adjutant In 1945, Johannmeyer was transferred to the F√ºhrerhauptquartier (FHQ) in Berlin, located at the time in the Reich Chancellery, as Army Adjutant (Heeresadjutant), replacing Heinrich Borgmann. Johannmeyer was present at the conferences held twice a day (3:00 pm and at midnight) in the Chancellery's greenhouse, and later at those held in the F√ºhrerbunker. On Hitler's order, Johannmeyer flew to East Prussia to \\"clarify\\" the situation developing as the Soviets advanced through the Baltic States. Hitler always considered reports by army generals unrealistic, and refusing to accept that the Eastern Front was collapsing, relied on his adjutants to relay \\"positive news\\". Johannmeyer, upon his return, reported that the army was in an alarmingly desperate state, especially after the formation of the Courland pocket and the pocket around K√∂nigsberg. Hitler refused to allow any means of withdrawal. When Johannmeyer referred to the civilian deaths occurring due to the massive evacuation of the eastern territories, Hitler replied in anger: Johannmeyer was among the occupants of the F√ºhrerbunker, Hitler's underground headquarters in encircled Berlin. Johannmeyer was present at Hitler's last birthday ceremony on 20 April 1945. During the night of the 28‚Äì29 April, Hitler ordered three copies of his political testament be hand-delivered to Field Marshal Ferdinand Sch√∂rner in Czechoslovakia, Karl D√∂nitz in Schleswig- Holstein, and Paul Giesler in Tegernsee by Johannmeyer, SS-Standartenf√ºhrer Wilhelm Zander - Bormann's adjutant, and Chief Press Secretary (Stellvertretender Pressechef) Heinz Lorenz, respectively. The three officers said their farewell to Hitler and were each handed a white dossier containing the testament by Martin Bormann at approximately 4:00 am on 29 April. Armed with automatic weapons, and in uniform, the trio left Berlin later that day attempting to break through Soviet lines to deliver the testament to their respective objective. Oberstleutnant Gra√ümann was tasked with ferrying Johannmeyer in a Fieseler Fi 156 Storch from Pfaueninsel, Wannsee, back to Field Marshal Sch√∂rner's headquarters - who at this time was still unaware of his appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the Army. He took off at around midnight on 1‚Äì2 May 1945, but was unable to land in Berlin, having to return and make an emergency landing in the Erzgebirge.

Bromley piloted a two-seater Bristol F.2b Fighter for No. 22 Squadron. The observers that manned the rear guns for Bromley were John Howard Umney, for ten victories, and Charles George Gass, for two. World War I Bromley enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force while in Montreal on 17 September 1915. His enlistment papers denote his father, living in Vancouver, as his next of kin. He was five feet seven inches tall, with dark hair and complexion, and gray eyes. He joined the 4th Overseas University Company. His first overseas assignment was as a sapper in the Canadian engineers. Bromley joined the Royal Flying Corps as a cadet, and was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant (on probation) on 17 May 1917. He flew solo on 16 July 1917, and was confirmed in his rank and appointed a flying officer on 16 October. He was subsequently assigned to No. 22 Squadron RFC. On 8 November 1917, he and his observer were badly shot about in a dogfight and forced to land. Bromley's first success in aerial warfare took place on 6 May 1918, when he drove a German Albatros D.III down out of control. He ran off a string of a dozen victories in little less than a month, with his last wins coming on 5 June. His final total included five enemy planes destroyed, and seven driven down out of control. Bromley was transferred to the unemployed list on 20 May 1919. Post-war life Bromley returned to North America aboard the SS Scandinavian, disembarking in New York on 20 July 1919. After family visits, he returned to employment managing the Simmons mattress factory in Calgary. He married his fianc√©e, Elizabeth Ayling, in October 1920. They had a daughter together three years later. In April 1928, Bromley went missing for two weeks. His body was eventually found on the Simmons factory roof in a crouched position. The cause of death was unknown. His death date was determined to be 14 April 1928. Edwin Claude Bromley was buried in Burnsland Cemetery in Calgary.

The one-off special, based on Charles Dickens' 1843 novella A Christmas Carol, is about Nan visited by three ghosts on Christmas night in her council flat. Plot=The Beginning Jamie comes to visit Nan in her council flat, only to find she's been sitting in the dark with the heating off to save money. She is visited by some carollers (played by Madness) and an old friend who she does the lottery with. This doesn't please her, but she doesn't buy the lottery and she keeps it in a jar for herself to save. \\"Northern Bob\\", his family and their dog, Tim, are hoping to stay for the night and have Christmas dinner with Joannie. They give her an alternative Christmas present by making a donation in her name to the Mobile Library of Sudan. She eventually throws them out. In the night, the ghost of Jake Taylor, her deceased husband, comes through her closet to tell her she'll be visited by three more ghosts. Christmas Past The first ghost she is visited by is the Ghost of Christmas Past (Ben Miller), who is really rubbish at his haunting tricks. He takes her to her house when she was a little girl. They see her mother putting her to bed to be ready for Father Christmas. She leaves him out a mince pie and a glass of milk. In the morning, Father Christmas left the younger Joannie a tangerine. She opens her mouth and \\"Nan\\" is born. Then he takes Joannie to the 1950s when she sees her and Jake failing to arrange a date together. Then he takes her to the 1970s, where Joannie and Jake are very unhappily married. Christmas Present The next ghost to appear is the Ghost of Christmas Present (David Tennant). He comes on with his mobile playing the \\"Ghostbusters Theme\\", which doesn't impress Nan. He shows her \\"Northern Bob\\" and his family living in the streets having crisps for their Christmas dinner, which chokes Tim to death. Christmas Future The last ghost to visit her is the Ghost of Christmas Future (Roger Lloyd-Pack) who appears in an advert on her TV, which again doesn't impress her. He takes her to the following year where she sees her lottery friend's numbers coming up. She pretends to go into the convenience store to get the money, but she comes back out and gives them ¬£1 each, claiming that there were thousands of winners but it turns out that she hadn't gotten the lottery ticket and the other ladies chase her down the street. Jamie has a baby son, Ludvig Brian Taylor, by his German wife Stephanie, but doesn't invite Nan to the christening as he wants her to have nothing to do with the baby. She ends up living in a home where nobody comes up to see her, and everyone hates her. At her funeral, nobody turns up except Jamie, Stephanie and their son, who don't pay any attention at all. The Ghost explains to Nan that if she doesn't change her ways, she will spend the rest of her life alone. Nan wakes up the following morning in her flat. The End She tells Jamie to get to the convenience store to buy her stuff for a Christmas banquet. She invites Bob and the family (and lets them stay for the night), and her Lottery friends. The carollers come back and sing \\"Baggy Trousers\\". When everyone is in bed, she picks up a packet of crisps and shouts for Tim and offers one to him implying she hasn't changed at all.

The centre opened on 26 March 2010, after taking two years to build the ¬£13.3m venue, which is the first on-demand white water centre in the UK. The facility was designed by the French company, HydroStadium, who designed similar courses for the Sydney, Athens and Beijing OlympicsWales Online Ride those rapids at new centre in the bay The centre offers on-demand white water rafting and canoeing and a flat-water pond for warm-up and initial training. Off-site activities include gorge walking and surfing.CIWW About History During construction of the Cardiff International White Water Prior to the 1999 completion of the Cardiff Bay Barrage, Cardiff Bay and the tidewater sections of the Rivers Ely and Taff were a saltwater estuary which filled and emptied twice daily with tides as high as . At low tide, moored boats were stranded on mud flats. The barrage converted the estuary into a permanent freshwater lake, maintained at the level of the former high tide. The shoreline of this new lake is the location of the CIWW. Plans for the CIWW were revealed and approved in 2006 and the centre was originally due to open in 2008, with an original estimated cost of ¬£8.4m and funding support from the Welsh Assembly Government, Sportlot, the Welsh Canoe Association and the Heritage Lottery fund.Wales Online White water centre plans revealed In November 2008, a 180-tonne crane was constructed on the site in order to start work on a temporary dam that held back the water while four large pumps were installed. The crane was then floated on a pontoon in the River Ely to create a retained water pool separating the course from the river. An estimated 50,000 people are expected to use it each year.BBC News Crane starts ¬£13m canoe centre Canoe Slalom Competition The gates used on 10 June for the final race of the first event of the 2012 ICF Canoe Slalom World Cup. The CIWW centre was developed by Cardiff Council for full international and Olympic competition use. The first event of the International Canoe Federation's 2012 World Cup, held on 8 June through 10 June, was used by several nations to finalize their selection of athletes for the 2012 London Olympics. The 23-gate course for the final race on 10 June had seven upstream gates, six downstream gates in eddies, and an unusual set of three flush gates forming a zig-zag chicane. Downstream gates 13, 14, and 15 had all six of their poles in a straight line, evenly spaced, with the racers required to start from the left and pass each pole on alternating sides.

She was a former member and authority of Denishawn, the eclectic company, founded by Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn in 1915. She performed with companies ranging from modern-dance groups to the Radio City Music Hall Rockettes. Early life Sherman was born in Beloit, Wisconsin on June 14, 1908 to Horace Humphrey Sherman, an advertising writer, and Florentine St. Clair, an opera singer. The family moved to New York City in 1921, where Jane began studying dancing, after she saw a St. Denis program that included \\"Brahms Waltz and Liebestr√§ume\\", a solo that inspired her to study at the New York Denishawn School. Career= Dancing From 1927 to 1928, she joined the Ziegfeld Follies and toured with the troupe, and later returned to modern dance as a member of the Humphrey-Weidman Company in 1928.

After the initial invasion in 1911, the Italian control over much of the country remained ineffective. In the face of the armed Arab opposition, mainly in Cyrenaica under the leadership of Omar Mukhtar, Italian forces under the Generals Pietro Badoglio and Rodolfo Graziani waged punitive pacification campaigns which turned into brutal and bloody acts of repression. The Frontier Wire, a barbed wire fence was built from the Mediterranean to the oasis of Al- Jaghbub to sever lines critical to the resistance. Soon afterwards, the colonial administration began the wholesale deportation of the people of the Jebel Akhdar to deny the rebels the support of the local population. The forced migration of more than 100,000 people ended in concentration camps in Suluq, El Magrun, Abyar and El Agheila where tens of thousands died in squalid conditions. Overall, five main and ten smaller concentration camps were established. Badoglio proposed to convert the camps into permanent settlements, but this was prevented by the dismal living and economic conditions in the camps. Estimates of deaths in concentration camps Estimates of the people who died in these camps vary. It is estimated that the number of Libyans who died - killed either through combat or mainly through starvation and disease - is at a minimum of 80,000 or even up to one third of the Cyrenaican population. Ilan Papp√© estimates that between 1928 and 1932 the Italian military \\"killed half the Bedouin population (directly or through disease and starvation in camps).\\"Ilan Papp√©, The Modern Middle East. Routledge, 2005, , p. 26. Italian historian Emilio Gentile estimates 50,000 deaths resulting from the suppression of resistance. In his book Cerinaica today, Dr. Todesky, who in 1931 was the director of the Italian Army Health Services, states \\"From May 1930 to September 1930 more than 80,000 Libyans were forced to leave their land and live in concentration camps they were taken 300 at a time watched by soldiers to make sure that the Libyans go directly to the concentration camps\\" and \\"By the end of 1930 all Libyans who live in tents were forced to go and live in the camps. 55% of the Libyans died in the camps.\\" 2008 cooperation treaty On 30 August 2008, Gaddafi and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi signed a historic cooperation treaty in Benghazi. Under its terms, Italy will pay $5 billion to Libya as compensation for its former military occupation. In exchange, Libya will take measures to combat illegal immigration coming from its shores and boost investments in Italian companies. The treaty was ratified by Italy on 6 February 2009, and by Libya on 2 March, during a visit to Tripoli by Berlusconi.

Caeso was the son of Marcus Fabius Ambustus, the Pontifex Maximus, and brother to Numerius and Quintus. With his two brothers, Caeso was sent as ambassador to the Gauls, when the latter were besieging Clusium, and participated in an attack against the besieging Gauls. The Gauls demanded that the three should be surrendered to them for violating the law of nations. When the Roman Senate refused to give up the guilty parties, the Gauls marched against Rome, which they sacked after the battle of the Allia.Livy, v. 35, 36, 41Plutarch Camillus 17 Many scholars believe the entire story of the events at Clusium to be fiction, as Clusium had no real reason to appeal to Rome for help, and the Gauls needed no real provocation to sack Rome. The story, it is hypothesized, exists to provide an explanation for an otherwise unmotivated attack on Rome, and to depict Rome as a bulwark of Italy against the Gauls.

He is best known for being the author of \\"The Total German Shepherd Dog\\" and \\"Canine Hip Dysplasia and Other Orthopedics Disorders\\". He also tours the world conducting lectures and seminars on canine health as well as judging UKC, Sieger, and other registry shows. Early German Shepherd Career Lanting owned his first German Shepherd Dog in 1947, but did not begin breeding them until 1966, when he moved to Toledo, Ohio. He also began showing his dogs in obedience and breed conformation trials. He started to get the attention of other owners and he was often hired to handle their dogs in both rings. He spent most weekends during the 1960s and 1970s showing dogs in the Great Lakes region of the USA and Canada. AKC judge In 1979, Lanting began judging AKC shows. He was AKC-licensed to judge German Shepherds, Rottweilers, Boxers, greyhounds, and whippets and later got international judging licenses from national kennel clubs overseas. He has judged and lectured in more than 30 countries. A letter to AKC dated May 6, 2000, from Darrell Hayes asked for an explanation of Lanting's alleged advertising in the February 2000 Plumb Creek show in Colorado. Lanting had placed information about a colleague in Pakistan who was looking to import a working Rottweiler and a Labrador Retriever to improve the gene pools in that country. AKC claimed that Lanting was using his judging privileges to his advantage and was in violation of AKC's \\"no trafficking\\" rule (\\"buy, sell, and in any way trade in or traffic in dogs as a means of livelihood in whole or in part‚Äù (Chapter 7, Section 1, Rules, March 2001)). Lanting denies these allegations, stating his sole motive was to altruistically help serious breeders in that country to improve their dogs. On May 15, 2000, the AKC temporarily suspended Lanting's judging privileges and in November 2000 he was suspended indefinitely. At the February 10, 2006, board of directors meeting, the board received a request from Lanting for reinstatement. The board voted to reinstate his AKC judging privileges effective May 15, 2015. Non AKC Judging Fred still judges SV / Sieger style shows (German shepherds). He is also approved to judge for the KC (UK) German shepherds, Rottweilers, Boxers, Whippets, Greyhounds, and Shibas as well as a UKC all-breed judge. Fred is currently an internationally licensed judge with the Dog Club of China and an internationally licensed all breed conformation judge for several other registries. Seminars Fred currently conducts seminars on canine hip dysplasia (and other orthopedic issues) including genetic prevention, nutrition, diagnosis and treatment, and more. He also presents seminars on an analytical approach to evaluating dogs (from picking puppies to conformation judging), Schutzhund training and problem solving, anatomy, and the evolution of the American German Shepherd Dog.

History=Opening The line was built in the late 1870s without an Act of Parliament to serve the newly constructed Whitburn Colliery and was opened as a private railway in May 1879. Apart from the colliery and those working there the line served the Lighthouse limestone quarry, a paper manufactory, and local farms. The line opened to the public on 19 March 1888. Nationalisation On 1 January 1947 the coal company was vested in the National Coal Board so the railway became the first nationalised passenger line in Britain.

It was adapted by Rod Serling from a novel by Whit Masterson, who also wrote the novel that was the basis for Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. The film was photographed by veteran Floyd Crosby and scored by jazz composer Kenyon Hopkins.. Plot Andy Paxton (Boone) is an arrogant, obnoxious pop idol who is about to be divorced by his wife Lissa (Eden) and constantly abuses his staff, including his bodyguard ‚Äì ex-cop Hub, his manager Vecchio, and his valet, Bake. Andy begins an engagement at the Huntington Hartford Theater in Los Angeles. Hub and he arrive home to find a maid hysterical ‚Äì his infant son Bobby has been kidnapped and the son's nurse murdered. The ransom note has the code word \\"canary\\" and they summon the police, led by Lt Bonner (Klugman). Andy does not tell the police about the code word out of fear that his son may be killed. A second message arrives demanding $200,000 ransom, which Andy manages to raise, and the money is delivered to an isolated beach, but nobody comes to meet him. Hub takes Andy to a lonely inn and tortures a woman into giving them the address of a man who might have been in touch with the kidnappers. They find the man, but he is dead. After Bake is found murdered, Andy receives further instructions by telephone from the kidnapper, and realizes that Hub is one of the few people who know their unlisted number. Andy and Lissa return to the inn and rescue their baby, and Andy shoots the mentally deranged Hub as police cars surround the inn.

The film was always envisioned as a vehicle for Pat Boone, who had made a number of movies for Fox; he had a three-picture deal with the studio at fee of $200,000 per movie, which would be credited to his production company, Cooga Mooga Productions. Rod Serling, then at the height of his Twilight Zone fame, was paid $125,000 to write the script. With a star and writer of that caliber, the film was originally estimated to have a budget between $1.5 and 2.0 million and be shot over 10 weeks. Ann-Margret was mentioned as a possibility for the female lead. Film becomes low-budget Peter Levathes was fired in the wake of cost over-runs on Cleopatra, and Darryl F. Zanuck took over the studio. Zanuck called a halt to all productions at the studio, literally shutting down the backlot on 26 July 1962. Zanuck was obliged to pay a fee to Boone and Serling. By this stage, the studio also had commitments to Barbara Eden and Steve Forrest (the latter at a fee of $25,000). Zanuck assigned the film to Robert L. Lippert's company, Associated Producers Inc, who specialized in making lower-budget films for Fox. Zanuck gave Lippert $100,000 to finish the film and a shortened schedule. (Maury Dexter, who produced the film for Lipper, puts this figure at $250,000 in his memoirs.) The New York Times reported that Boone \\"fears that the 10-day shooting schedule will deny it the artistic and production values it might have had with the 10-week shooting schedule he expected\\" ‚Äì he decided to proceed with the film anyway.Mark Thomas McGee, Talk's Cheap, Action's Expensive: The Films of Robert L. Lippert, Bear Manor Media, 2014 p 271-272 Filming Filming began on 10 December 1962. Some shooting was done for the film on the Fox lot, which was otherwise closed. During production, the title was changed to The Yellow Canary. The cast included Jeff Corey, who had been blacklisted and not made a movie for a number of years. Boone had been taught by Corey and he pressured the studio into casting him. In a September 2012 interview at the UCLA Film and Television Archive, Boone stated that the film was slated for a ridiculously short 12-day schedule. When they were wrapping the last day with several key scenes left to be filmed, Boone paid $20,000 out of his own pocket to buy one more day of shooting. He felt strongly about the film because it gave him the chance to play \\"a bad guy for a change.\\" Maury Dexter later recalled: > The film was a nice production, but didn‚Äôt really come off. It did nothing > at the box office and the critics panned it. Serling, Boone, Forrest, and > Eden were all play-or-pay contracts, so... [Fox] preferred to play instead > of paying off the commitments. (Probably should not have thrown good money > after bad.) I produced the show, and with due respect to all concerned, the > production overshadowed the drama.Maury Dexter, Highway to Hollywood, p 110 Reception According to Diabolique magazine: > Boone whined about Fox's cheapness, but Zanuck was right.

Listed at 5' 11\\" , 175 lb. , he batted and threw right handed. Izquierdo was a solid defensive catcher but a modest hitter. Besides his brief stint with the Twins, Izquierdo worked in baseball for almost four decades as a player, coach, manager and scout, spending 23 seasons in the Minor Leagues‚Äîfive of them in the Mexican League‚Äîand also playing winter ball in Venezuela. Born in the neighborhood of Pueblo Nuevo in Matanzas, Izquierdo was originally a middle infielder and third baseman with good range and ability to turn and complete a double play. Eventually, he made the conversion to catcher successfully, to become one of the best defensive backstops Cuba ever produced.Gonz√°lez Echevarr√≠a, Roberto (1999). The Pride of Havana: A History of Cuban Baseball. Oxford University Press. . According to those who saw him play, Izquierdo was magnificent at all the intangible things that a catcher does, like calling the game, working the pitch counts, framing pitches and blocking home plate, which combined with a fine defense and a strong and secure throwing arm. Izquierdo entered the Cuban League with the Elefantes de Cienfuegos, playing for them during the 1954‚Äì1955 season before joining the Alacranes de Almendares from 1955 through 1961.Figueredo, Jorge S. (2011). Cuban Baseball: A Statistical History, 1878-1961. Macfarland & Company. . Almendares won easily the 1958-1959 pennant. As the league champions, the team represented Cuba in the 1959 Caribbean Series held in Caracas, where he guided a pitching staff that included Mike Cuellar, Art Fowler, Camilo Pascual and Orlando Pe√±a, while the Cuban team captured the competition with a 5‚Äì1 record. Izquierdo started his organized baseball career in 1951 with the Galveston White Caps of the Gulf Coast League, playing for them three years before joining the Winston-Salem Twins of the Carolina League in 1954. He then signed a contract with the Cleveland Indians organization in 1955, and was assigned to its Double-A affiliate Keokuk Kernels. He hit a .302 average with a .427 slugging percentage along with 29 doubles, five triples and seven home runs in 119 games for Keokuk. After that he moved around for a while, playing in the Baltimore Orioles and Cincinnati Reds Minor League systems from 1956 through 1961. In 1957 Izquierdo reported to the Havana Sugar Kings, which played in the International League as the Triple A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds, while playing their home games at Gran Estadio de La Habana. The Sugar Kings won the League championship in 1959, and then ended up winning the 1959 Little World Series over the Minneapolis Millers of the American Association in seven thrilling games.Rippel, Joel (2003). 75 Memorable Moments in Minnesota Sports. Minnesota Historical Society Press. . By 1960, Izquierdo attended the Sugar Kings spring training camp following his winter season in Cuba. On July 13 of this year, the International League announced that the Havana Sugar Kings would play the remainder of their home season in Jersey City, New Jersey, because of the increasingly strained relations between the United States and Cuba governments following the Cuban Revolution of 1959.PBS Stealing Home ‚Äì Cuban Baseball Yesterday. PBS.org. Retrieved on August 28, 2015. As a result, Izquierdo and the other 10 native Cuban players decided to remain with the Jersey City Jerseys in its new home.1960 Havana Sugar Kings/Jersey City Jerseys. Baseball Reference. Izquierdo later played for the Twins organization during five seasons spanning 1963‚Äì1967. Overall, he hit .273 with five home runs and 161 RBI in 515 minor league games. In 16 games for Minnesota, he posted an average of .269 (7-for-26) with two doubles, two RBI and four runs scored. Izquierdo then moved to the Houston Astros organization and was assigned to their Triple-A affiliate Oklahoma City 89ers from 1968 to 1969, where he served as a coach and utility man.

In July 1969, Izquierdo was suspended for the remainder of the American Association season and fined $750 as the result of his part in a bat- swinging incident with catcher Ted Simmons, by then a 19-year rookie who played for the Tulsa Oilers. Izquierdo had just scored one run for Oklahoma and was clearing the plate area of a bat when he and Simmons exchanged words. They then engaged in a shoving match and Simmons suffered a bruised thumb while trying to wrest the bat from Izquierdo.

Its second run paired it as a double feature with Counterpoint. Plot Sgt. Ryker (Lee Marvin) is an American soldier charged with treason during the Korean War, he is court-martialled and prosecuted by Capt. David Young (Bradford Dillman) and convicted and sentenced to death. Ryker's wife, Ann (Vera Miles), insists that her husband received an inadequate defense. She believes his story that he had been on a secret mission, assigned by a superior officer who has since died and can no longer vouch for him. Capt. Young believes Ryker is guilty, but he too thinks Ryker received an inadequate legal defense. He persuades the commanding general to give Ryker a new trial. The general reluctantly does so, however he insists that this time Young must serve as Ryker's defense counsel. Ryker has already resigned himself to his fate, and has to be persuaded to go along with the re-trial. As it unfolds all the evidence is damning to Ryker, the best Young can do is establish that Ryker's version of events is not impossible. The defense is also undermined by several of Ryker's lies and omissions, which are exposed during testimony at the trial, and also by Ryker's occasional fits of temper. A further complication ensues when a romantic attachment develops between Young and Ryker's wife. Ryker is furious when he realizes it has happened, and the general on hearing about it tells Young he will be court-martialled as soon as Ryker's trial is over. The prosecutor, Maj. Whitaker, unearths new evidence damning to the defendant's case, and all seems lost. At the last minute, however, Young learns some information from a Sergeant Winkler which verifies some aspects of Ryker's claim, and which when followed up on by Young, is enough to compel that Ryker be set free.

After starting as a family business in France in 1939, it has since become a subsidiary of Suez Environment, employing 4,600 people in 70 countries, and generating annual revenues of ‚Ç¨1.520 billion (2010 figures). History Founded by Gilbert Degr√©mont in 1939 on the outskirts of Paris, as a follow-up of his father Emille Degr√©mont's water treatment company established 1904 at Le Cateau-Cambr√©sis, the Degr√©mont company soon entered the international market, with contracts in countries such as Egypt, Iran, Indonesia and Peru. In 1972, the company merged with SGEA to become Lyonnaise des Eaux, which later became part of the Suez Group. Today, it is a subsidiary of Suez Environmenthttp://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=20970096 and has operations worldwide. Gilbert Degr√©mont‚Äôs grandfather, Adalbert, had already set up a mechanical engineering plant in the North of France in 1870, which was converted by his son, Emile, into a water treatment business. After completing an engineering degree in agronomics, Gilbert launched the Degr√©mont company that is still in existence today. Drinking water Degr√©mont is involved in the production of drinking water from groundwater or surface water in industrialized countries and the developing world. Its activities also include the desalination of seawater or brackish water for use as either drinking water or in irrigation. In all cases the water it produces is expected to meet the regulatory standards in operation in the relevant country. Degr√©mont has built 3,000 plants drinking water treatment plants around the world, and 250 desalination plants. To produce drinking water, it uses a range of different technologies such as settling, flottation, media filters, membrane ultrafiltration, ozone purification or ultraviolet disinfection systems. Its desalination plants use the reverse osmosis technology. Sewage and sludge treatment The company is also involved in the treatment of sewage and sludge, which is a growing problem for urban areas in particular. It relies on a range of different technologies including physical, chemical or biological treatments, ozonization, membrane bioreactors, sand filters etc. Most wastewater is treated for use in irrigation or for use in industrial cooling systems. Degr√©mont has built 2,500 sewage treatment plants with the capacity to recycle 2.4 million cubic meters per day. Sludge treatment is focused, first, on reducing the volumes of sludge produced and, second, processing it for reuse, mainly in agriculture. This is done through digestion, incineration, thickening, dewatering or drying, all of which can also lead to biogas recovery for use in energy production. Activities Degr√©mont estimates that 1 billion people are served by its 10,000 facilities around the world. These include 3,000 drinking water plants and 2,500 water treatment stations for urban wastewater. It carries out its activities using a number of different business models. * It designs, finances and builds facilities for the production of drinking water and for the treatment and recycling of sewage and sludge. This includes desalination plants that notably use reverse osmosis technology to create drinking water from seawater. * It can also operate those facilities for its customers in the public or private sector when contracted to do so. * Under its Build-Operate- Transfer contracts, Degr√©mont is responsible for financing and running facilities during the contract period (up to 25 years). Ownership is then transferred to the customer. * It sells equipment to facilities owned or run by third parties. Company culture Since 1951, Degr√©mont has published The Water Treatment Handbook, a book containing the company‚Äôs combined knowledge of water chemistry and water treatment. There have been 10 French editions and 7 English editions (Lavoisier), and it has been published in 10 languages in total. The company encourages its managers to participate in numerous international conferences and congresses, where they share Degr√©mont technologies. Degr√©mont has obtained GoodCorporation certification, a responsible business practice assessment system looking at the way an organisation is managed in relation to its employees, its customers, its suppliers, its shareholders, the environment and even its contribution to the community. R&D; Degr√©mont spent ‚Ç¨13.5 million on R&D; in 2010, and has filed over 500 patents since its creation. Recent investments have focused on improving the energy performance of plants and ultrafiltration membranes.

She was situated in a fish tank in the open (east) end of the Orange Bowl, and was trained to jump in the tank when a touchdown or field goal was scored.  History  From 1964‚Äì1967 NBC aired a popular series starring a dolphin named \\"Flipper,\\" which was set in southeast Florida and the Bahamas. The Dolphins used in the show lived at the Seaquarium on Key Biscayne. There were four different dolphins who played Flipper named Susie, Kathy, Patty, and Squirt. In 1966, The Miami Dolphins became an expansion franchise in the American Football League. Given the location, team name, and popularity of the TV show, it was decided that the new team mascot would be named \\"Flipper\\", and they would use a live Dolphin from the show as the team mascot. Team owner Joe Robbie struck a deal with both the City of Miami and the Miami Seaquarium to have one of the dolphins perform at home games. This required transporting the aquatic mammal to and from the game each Sunday. It was decided that Patty would be the dolphin used because she was comfortable travelling while the others were not. Following the 1968 season, \\"Flipper\\" was no longer used as the team mascot. Owner Joe Robbie decided to cut ties with the mascot because both the City of Miami and the Seaquarium decided they would not continue to pay for tank repairs and transportation costs.

The Security Council welcomed the signing of a Communique of the second round of negotiations in Geneva, in which the memorandum of understanding was stressed and the importance of both parties to abide by their obligations. The parties were also in favour of a United Nations peacekeeping force or other forces in the region, subject to authorisation by the United Nations. The Council took note of talks to be held in Moscow on 8 February 1994, and the intention of the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and his Special Representative to convene a new round of negotiations on 22 February 1994. The seriousness of the situation in Georgia, where nearly 300,000 displaced persons from Abkhazia were present, was recognised. The parties were summoned as soon as possible to resume negotiations and indicate their willingness to find a solution, in which the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia had to be respected. At the same time it was stressed that progress must be made on the political status of Abkhazia. The mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) was extended until 7 March 1994, with a view to increasing its strength if necessary. Two options proposed by the Secretary-General on the establishment of a peacekeeping mission in Abkhazia, Georgia, were noted and he was also requested to report on progress in the third round of negotiations and any circumstances under which such a force would be needed. This would be dependent on progress made in the talks. The resolution recognised that all refugees and displaced persons had the right to return and all parties should fulfil their commitments in this regard and agree a timetable. All attempts to change the demographic composition of Abkhazia by repopulating it by persons not previously resident there were condemned. Finally, all parties were urged to respect the ceasefire and guarantee the safety of United Nations personnel, and Member States were urged to contribute donations to Georgia to help it overcome the consequences of the conflict.

According to the Roman author Vegetius (Epitoma rei militaris II.25), each legion had 55 carroballistae (one per century) which were arrow/bolt-shooter of the cheiroballistra type. Vegetius tells us that each carroballista was carried by mules and operated by one contubernium (i.e. ten soldiers commanded by one decanus). Surviving representation of a carroballista are from the bas-reliefs of Trajan's Column (Scene XL and Scenes LXV/LXVI) and the Column of Marcus Aurelius.  Structure  The structure of the carroballista machine is identical to that of the cheiroballistra or manuballista. It seems so that the technical innovations introduced by the adoption of the cheiroballistra by the Roman Army at the end of the 1st century AD made the use of the cart possible. In fact, the light but stout metal spring-frame and the wider space in the frontal part of the machine given by the arched strut conferred a greater manoeuvrability to the whole ballista.  Shooting position  Roman cart-mounted ballista (Trajan's Column) Roman cart-mounted ballista on the Column of Marcus Aurelius According to the Trajan's column representation (Scene XL), the carroballista was manoeuvred by one man mounted on the cart with the ballista and by another man positioned behind the cart and operating probably some sort of winch handle. The presence of the mules in front of the cart suggests that the carroballista could be easily moved through the battle-field whilst shooting bolts. This interpretation is not unanimously accepted by scholars. It is not certain that the ballistae are actually shooting. The whole representation could be simply an image of carts transporting ballistae to their destination nest on the battle-field. But it is a matter of fact that the bolts or arrows are here depicted in a ready-to-be-shot position, and this is strange or impossible or even extremely dangerous for the artillerymen if the ballistae are simply being transported in this position to be then dismounted and deployed on the battle-field. In another section of the Trajan's column (Scene LXVI) the simple transportation of the ballista is depicted and now we have no arrows or bolts ready to be released on the ballista, the ballista is empty, and no artilleryman is manoeuvring the machine. An artilleryman is pulling the cart near the wheel and this suggests that the whole machine must have been quite a heavy structure.  Structure of the cart  A four-wheeled ballista drawn by armoured horses, from an engraving illustrating a 1552 edition of De Rebus Bellicis. It is sure that the cart was pulled by two mules or horses and that the size was probably that of standard Roman carts, i.e. c. 5 Roman feet (c. 147,85 cm) width (as depicted in the Trajan's Column, Scene XL and Scene LXVI), but the whole design of the cart is uncertain. There are many hypotheses about the structure of the cart and probably different models of the same machine seem to have been in use at the same time: * a simple two- wheels standard cart used to transport the ballista to its final emplacement on the field; * a special two-wheels cart [i.e. carroballista] with a ballista mounted on the cart and with the frontal part positioned towards the mules; * a special ballista simply mounted on two wheels and without cart (Trajan's Column Scene LXVI) and probably transported with the frontal part positioned rear, like Modern Era cannons, or forward and with a Transport-hook or Transport-hooks at the frontal position (see again Trajan's Column, Scene LXVI).About this hypothesis and a proposal of reconstruction of a carroballista of this type, see W. Soedel and V. Foley, Scientific American, March 1979, pp. 150‚Äì160. * a special four-wheels cart with a mounted ballista, as described in the book De Rebus Bellicis. Many scholars do not have an opinion about this problem, due to scarce evidence, as clearly stated by Alan Wilkins.  References  Sources *J. P.

President Clinton signed the ADAA into law in October 1996. While still obligated to public health concerns, the Act intends more rapid drug approval and medicated feed approval to assist the animal health industry. Overview The Animal Drug Availability Act specifies the conditions in which the U.S. Secretary of Health can refuse the application of a new drug. The possibility of an unconsidered hazard is not a permitted ground for refusing an application. The implications of the act include: * more relaxed controls on field studies unless requested and justified by the Center for Veterinary Medicine; * a strict demand for proof of efficacy; * a definition of adequate and well controlled procedures for field trials; * supporting labeling focused on the range of recommended or acceptable dosages; * the creation of Veterinary Feed Directive drugs as a new category of animal drugs. Details= Antibiotics in agriculture before ADAA statute  Antibiotic use was once common practice before the ADAA approved the use of antibacterials in animal feed. For 1985 the estimated annual antibiotic use in the U.S. are as follows. Cows were given 1 million pounds of antibiotics, 0.55 million pounds for swine, and 0.67 million pounds for poultry as therapeutic use, constituting legitimate bacterial infection treatment. Quantities for subtherapeutic use specified as; increase the daily body weight gain, improve the food-to-weight gain ratio, and increase the voluntary intake of food equals 3.1 million pounds in cows, feeding swine with 11 million pounds, and poultry with 2 million pounds. For each of these livestock species the subtherapeutic use is substantially higher: this contributes unnecessarily to possible microbial resistance. Those quantities preceded the ADAA, so approving veterinary feed including antibiotics for market contributed to progressing livestock medication. In 2003 the over 24 million pounds of antibiotics used for subtherapeutic use were distributed as follows: 10.3 million pounds for swine, 10.5 million pounds fed to poultry, and 3.7 million pounds given to cows.  Antibiotic resistant bacteria  The Union of Concerned Scientists estimate healthy hogs receive 5 million pounds of two tetracycline antibiotics, this is 60% greater than the total volume of antibiotics given to sick humans. Medical doctors advise appropriate use of antibiotics, specifically finishing the full antibiotic regimen with consequence of the strongest survivors recuperating and worsening the infection. Antibiotics create an environment appropriate for bacteria to evolve resistant strains, since when faced with death any survivors have become more appropriately adapted. This is the same principle as Darwinian evolution by natural selection. The development of resistant bacteria strains can be attributed to antibiotic use because resistance to the drugs was previously unobserved. The World Health Organization states: ‚ÄúShortly after the licensing and use in livestock of fluoroquinolone, a powerful new class of antimicrobials, fluoroquinolone-resistant Salmonella and Campylobacter isolations from animals, and humans increased.‚Äù Most production for fast food incorporates antibiotics, but there has been a push by major companies including McDonald's, Subway and Carl's Jr. to discontinues fluoroquinolone use in associated feedlots.  Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus infection  VRE infection has been positively correlated to avoparcin use; around the time of Americas ADAA in 1996 Denmark banned this specific growth promoter and found the flocks at slaughter had a decreased occurrence of VRE to 12% in 1998 from 82% in 1995.

Between the end of 408 and the beginning of 409 he was praefectus urbi of Rome. During this time, Alaric I besieged Rome for the first time. Pompeianus proposed to ask the pagan gods to protect the city. For this reason it is often assumed that he was a pagan, but Zosimus calls him a Christian. It was probably he who proposed to confiscate the properties of Valerius Pinianus and his wife Melania the Younger; but before the Roman Senate could discuss this proposal, Pompeianus was killed in the Roman Forum by an angry mob, which had rioted because of the shortage of food caused by the siege.

New York 1954, vol. 1, p.173) (born c. 1572; fl. 1590s, death date unknown) was a Native Nahua guide and explorer. He was the only known survivor of the Umana and Leyba expedition to the Great Plains in 1594 or 1595. In 1599 he guided Vicente de Zaldivar and in 1601 Governor Juan de O√±ate on expeditions to the plains. Background Jusepe was born in Culiacan, Mexico, about 1572. He spoke Nahuatl and was illiterate. He surely spoke some Spanish, but may not have been fluent as his testimony was later recorded with the help of an interpreter.Hammond, George P. and Rey, Agapito, eds. Don Juan de Onate, Colonizer of New Mexico, 1595-1692. Albuquerque: U of NM Press, Vol 5, 1953, 416-419 Jusepe's is the only account of the Umana/Leyba expedition. Jusepe probably took the surname of his employer (or owner), Antonio Gutierrez de Umana. In 1593 Gutierrez was recruited by Umana to join him on an expedition (entrada) to what would become New Mexico. Umana collected additional soldiers and servants in Santa Barbara, Chihuahua, the northernmost settlement of New Spain, and the expedition journeyed north to New Mexico. At the time there were no Spanish settlers in New Mexico. Gutierrez and Umana remained about one year among the Pueblo people, mostly in San Ildefonso near the Rio Grande. Umana and Leyba expedition The expedition of Umana and his partner, Francisco Leyba de Bonilla (also reported in the literature as Humana and Leyva), was carried out without the permission of Spanish authorities. The members of the expedition included both Spanish soldiers and indigenous Mexicans, although there is no indication of how many people accompanied Umana and Leyba. The sole source of information about this expedition is Gutierrez, who told the story in an official inquiry with O√±ate in 1599. Umana and Lebya left New Mexico, probably in 1595, to explore eastwards, presumably in search of large cities and rich kingdoms rumored to be just over the horizon. Their route from San Ildefonso led them by the pueblo at Pecos, New Mexico, and out onto the Great Plains of what is today Texas, where they met the Apache. They found numerous rancher√≠as, some of them abandoned, and herds of bison. Gutierrez said they found abundant water in many marshes, springs, and arroyos, as well as great numbers of plum trees and nuts. Gutierrez said they traveled toward the north and the farther they went, the more abundant were the bison. After some 45 days they came to two large rivers, and beyond was a very large indigenous settlement that extended for 10 leagues (about 26 miles or 42 kilometers) and was two leagues wide. One of the two rivers flowed through the settlement. Gutierrez gave a brief description of the \\"Great Settlement.\\" which may have been Etzanoa near the much later Arkansas City, Kansas. The houses were built on a frame of stakes, with straw roofs. They were built close together, separated by narrow pathways, and in some places between the houses were fields of maize, pumpkins, and beans. The people of the settlement received the Spanish in peace, and provided them with food. They depended upon Bison hunting as well as agriculture. Three days travel north of this settlement, they came upon a \\"multitude of buffalo\\", but no more indigenous settlements. Discord between the leaders broke out. After spending an afternoon and morning apparently writing up his account of the dispute, Umana called Leyba to his tent and stabbed him to death with a butcher knife. Umana told his soldiers that Leyba had threatened him. The expedition then continued, reaching a very large river ten days beyond the Great Settlement. The river was one-fourth of a league wide, about two-thirds of a mile or just more than a kilometer, deep and sluggish. \\"They did not dare to cross it.\\" It was here that five of the Mexicans, including Gutierrez, deserted the expedition. Three became lost on the plains, and local indigenous people killed another. Gutierrez was taken captive by Apaches and lived with them for a year, until he escaped or was set free and made his way back to New Mexico. By this time O√±ate and a large group of settlers had arrived in New Mexico, and Gutierrez took up residence at the San Juan Bautista Pueblo. On February 16, 1599, O√±ate interviewed him concerning the Umana and Leyba expedition, and his story was recorded. According to later accounts, Umana and the other members of the expedition were killed by indigenous people 18 days beyond the Great Settlement.Bolton, Herbert Eugene, Spanish Exploration in the Southwest, 1542-1706. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1916, 261 Zaldivar expedition On September 15, 1599, Sergeant Major Vicente de Zaldivar Mendoza led a group of about 60 soldiers east to the Great Plains from New Mexico. Gutierrez served as the guide and interpreter as he had learned the Apache language during his sojourn with them. The objective of the expedition was to procure much-needed meat for the settlers and to see if the bison could be captured and domesticated.Bolton, 223-232 Gutierrez most likely led Zaldivar on the same route that he had taken with Umana and Leyba. They crossed the Pecos River, caught catfish in the Gallinas River, and six leagues (15 miles or 24 kilometers) hence, came across Apaches and a rancheria. Zaldivar and Gutierrez established friendly relations with the Apaches. Continuing, they saw their first bison probably near present-day Conchas. Perhaps near Logan, the Spaniards and them Mexican associates built a corral and attempted to drive bison into it from a plain where they apparently saw \\"100,000\\" of them. What ensued was a comedy of errors, as the bison proved impossible to capture. However, Zaldivar procured a quantity of dried meat, and after exploring more of eastern New Mexico, near the present day border with Texas, he returned to the Spanish settlements, arriving November 8, 1599. O√±ate follows Umana and Leyba's route In 1601, Juan de O√±ate, the founder of New Mexico and governor of the new colony, led a large expedition to the Great Plains, relying on Gutierrez as a guide. Gutierrez led O√±ate to the same areas he had visited with Jumana and Leyba. O√±ate and Gutierrez followed the Canadian River through the Texas Panhandle. Upon reaching Oklahoma, they encountered sand dunes that made the passage of their oxcarts difficult, so O√±ate chose to turn north away from the Canadian to journey onward to the \\"Great Settlement.\\"Bolton, 250-267 En route, he came across a large encampment of friendly indigenous people he called Escanjaques. They were enemies of the people in the Great Settlement, whom O√±ate called \\"Rayados\\", because they tattooed or painted their faces. Rayado means \\"striped\\" in Spanish. Unlike the response to Umana and Leyba, the people of the Great Settlement fled on O√±ate's arrival and, fearing an attack on his 70 Spanish and an unknown number of Mexican soldiers, O√±ate turned back toward New Mexico. The Escanjaques also turned hostile, attacking O√±ate, fighting a prolonged battle with him. The cause of the battle is uncertain, but may be because O√±ate had kidnapped several boys to be taken back to New Mexico to be instructed in the Christian faith and to serve as interpreters.Bolton, 264 The account of O√±ate's expedition permits us to speculate about the location of the Great Settlement, possibly called Etzanoa, by its inhabitants. It was probably either at the site of present-day Wichita, Kansas, or along the Walnut River in Arkansas City, Kansas. Archaeological discoveries favor the Walnut River.Vehik, Susan C. \\"Onate's Expedition to the Southern Plains: Routes, Destinations, and Implications for Late Prehistoric Cultural Adaptations\\", Plains Anthropologist, Vol. 31, No, 111, 1986, 13-33 The large river Intriguing in Gutierrez's account of the Umana and Leyba expedition is the mention of a large river found about ten days north of the Great Settlement. The river that best fits Gutierrez's description is the Missouri, perhaps near Kansas City. The Missouri is about 500 yards (450 meters) wide at this point, not as wide as Jusepe estimated, but the largest river that could be reached by foot in about 10 days from the Great Settlement.Fitzpatrick, Tony, \\"Lewis and Clark data show narrower, more flood- prone River.\\" http://news.wustl.edu/news/Pages/8070.aspx This would mark the first known visit of Europeans to the Missouri River. What does not fit very well with this possible route is Gutierrez's comment that three days beyond the Great Settlement that they came upon \\"such a multitude of buffalo that the plain - which was level, for there are no mountains -- was so covered with them that they were startled and amazed at the sight.\\" If the Great Settlement were at Wichita or Arkansas City, three days travel toward the Missouri River would place the expedition in the rocky and rolling Flint Hills, not a plain. Moreover, in historic times, buffalo were most abundant in the shorter grass prairies west of Longitude 97 rather than the tall grass prairies to the east. Thus, the contradictions in Gutierrez's account continue to incite speculation among historians. Possibly, the \\"large river\\" was the Kansas which, during high water, would have been deep and wide. The Platte River in Nebraska has also been suggested, but that would require a major recalculation of the route of Umana, Leyba, and O√±ate as well as the location of the Great Settlement.Bolton, 201 Gutierrez Gutierrez was one of many, usually anonymous, indigenous Mexican soldiers, servants, and slaves who aided the Spanish in their explorations. Nothing more is known of him after the return of the O√±ate expedition to New Mexico in November 1601.

RICCO Monthly Film Bulletin; London Vol. 42, Iss. 492, (Jan 1, 1975): 178. Plot A murder charge is dropped against San Francisco black militant Frankie Steele (Thalmus Rasulala), who is represented by liberal attorney Joe Ricco (Dean Martin). Two police officers are then gunned down. An eyewitness, the young son of a friend of Ricco's, identifies Steele as the man he saw leaving the scene of the crime. Ricco is a lonely widower. He has a loyal secretary (Cindy Williams) and a dog. His closest friend is George Cronyn (Eugene Roche), the detective in charge of the case. Cronyn is irate that Steele got away with killing a woman, Mary Justin, resulting in the deaths of two of his fellow officers. Cronyn and his men raid a hideout of Steele's organization, the Black Serpents. But while Steele manages to get away, a racist cop named Tanner kills the unarmed Calvin Mapes and plants a gun on him, then arrests his brother, Purvis Mapes (Philip Michael Thomas). Their sister, Irene Mapes (Denise Nicholas), who works in an art gallery, asks Ricco if he would be Purvis's lawyer. He agrees and uncovers evidence that Tanner was at fault. In exchange, Ricco persuades Purvis to reveal where the fugitive Frankie Steele can be found. Irene invites Ricco to the opening of a new art exhibit. Ricco also meets a woman, Katherine (Geraldine Brooks), with whom he becomes romantically involved. A sniper tries to shoot Ricco in his home. A neighbor, an old woman with poor eyesight, sees a man who once again resembles Steele. After a second attempt on his life, Cronyn assigns a cop named Barrett to tail Ricco wherever he goes. It makes no sense to Ricco, though, that Steele would want to kill his own lawyer. Ricco shakes the tail because he promised Purvis Mapes not to reveal Steele's whereabouts. He goes to a church and finds Steele, who denies killing the cops but blurts out that he did indeed murder the woman Mary Justin. A fistfight between the two men results, landing Ricco in the hospital. Regretting that he got a guilty man off, Ricco apologizes to Mary Justin's brother, who doesn't accept it, angrily accusing Ricco of being \\"an accessory.\\" The racist cop Tanner is then found murdered. Ricco is relieved when Cronyn's men apprehend Steele. He goes to the black-tie affair at the art gallery, taking Katherine as his date and letting Barrett tag along. A sniper appears and takes aim. He hits Katherine by mistake, then shoots Barrett as well. Ricco grabs the cop's gun and gives chase. The killer wounds more cops before a shot by Ricco drops him. It is clearly Steele, but when the body is examined, it turns out to be Mary Justin's brother wearing a disguise.

For example, the polynomial (x+1)(y+1)(x+y+2)/2 defines the Witten zeta function of SU(3) but the linear form x+1 has y-coefficient equal to zero.

Brewers Quay is a converted Victorian brewery on the south side of Hope Square near the Old Harbour in Weymouth, Dorset, southern England. Much of the complex dates from 1903‚Äì04, when it was built as the Hope Brewery for John Groves & Sons Ltd. It was later taken over by Devenish Brewery in 1960 and opened in 1990 as an indoor shopping complex with around twenty specialty shops together with heritage and science exhibits, until it closed in 2010. From 2013-17, the building housed an antiques emporium. It currently awaits redevelopment. Brewers Quay has been a Grade II listed building since 1974. The building is located at Hope Square, which holds a range of cafes, bars, bistros, while close by is the Tudor House Museum, and facing out to sea is Nothe Fort and its gardens. Brewery and conversion into tourist attraction The Courtyard Restaurant of Brewers Quay. Hope Square had been used for brewing since at least 1252. There was good access to spring water from Chapelhay, while barley fields were located at Radipole. By the 18th century, there were three separate breweries in the area; each being under the ownership of the Flew family, William Devenish and the Davis Brewery. In the early 19th century, the Flew family sold their brewery to Devenish, and in 1960, Groves also sold theirs to Devenish. Devenish continued to produce beer from Brewers Quay until 1985. Following its closure, Devenish and Weymouth & Portland Borough Council launched a major plan to transform the now-vacant building into a shopping centre with a pub and restaurant. Devenish spent ¬£4.5 million on refurbishing the building. Opened in June 1990, the new complex was hailed as \\"the Covent Garden of Dorset\\". The success of Brewers Quay resulted in various awards and commendations, including the Come to Britain Trophy, a Commitment to the Environment Award, a Civic Society award and major commendation from Business and Industry. 100,000 people visited the building in 1990, with the number increasing to 750,000 in 2010. The building also housed the award-winning Timewalk exhibition and Weymouth Museum, and in 1992, a hands-on science centre named Discovery was opened. Redevelopment attempts (1990s-2012) The Shopping Village of Brewers Quay. Brewers Quay seen in 1987 when it was the Devenish Brewery. Plans for residential development at the site were scrapped after talks between Devenish and the council. Despite the success of the new shopping centre, Devenish suffered operational losses and ultimately decided to sell the building to Greenalls plc in the mid-1990s. A succession of owners followed, selling Brewers Quay approximately every 3‚Äì4 years. The site to Scottish & Newcastle in the late 1990s, to Spirit Group in 2004 and Punch Taverns in 2007. A lack of investment in the building since the early 1990s had resulted in growing repair costs, while the council refused to consider residential uses of the building. As a result, Brewers Quay was seen as unsaleable. Punch Taverns attempted a redevelopment plan, Brewery Quarter, in 2008. However, they failed to secure any interested developers or operators for the plans, which included the creation of a boutique hotel. Faced with increasing costs and losses, the site was sold to a local investment group, Brewers Quay Investment LLP, in 2010. By the end of the year, Brewers Quay was closed and plans for its future commenced. The investment group's plans centred around converting Brewers Quay into an 85-bed hotel, while including space for luxury apartments, a museum and other attractions, shops and a restaurant. The project was predicted to cost ¬£15 million and was expected to be completed in time for the 2012 Summer Olympics. However, in 2011-12, the group ultimately decided that the plans were not viable. The calculated costs of redevelopment were greater than expected, while there had been limited interest in the retail space. In 2012, the owners decided to generate some income from the building by leasing space for a bar and restaurant named Salt Pop Up Bar & Kitchen, which was open in time for the Olympics. Later in 2012, an art gallery was also opened in a front space of the building, where it remained until early 2013. Use as an antiques emporium and new redevelopment plans (2013-17) In March 2013, Brewers Quay reopened primarily as an antiques emporium, holding approximately 50 traders. Space was made for Weymouth Museum and a new D-Day Museum, while an Italian restaurant, Il Porto, was also opened. Although this generated revenue from the ground and first floor levels of the building, the upper levels remained vacant. In 2015, the owners made new plans to redevelop the building. This included space for 35 residential units, retail units, Weymouth Museum and \\"wet weather/exhibition space and cultural experience space\\". The plans were approved in November 2016. However, in late 2016, the building was sold to Versant Developments & Homes, who announced their intentions of redeveloping the building along similar lines. The emporium closed in July 2017.

Weymouth Museum is a museum in Weymouth, Dorset, England. It is located within Brewers Quay on the south side of Hope Square near Weymouth Harbour. The museum currently uses temporary space to display a small part of its collection prior to carrying out planned expansion and redevelopment plans. History Weymouth Museum was founded in 1972 and originally occupied the former Melcombe Regis Boys' School at Westham Road.https://web.archive.org/web/20070822143614/http://www.brewers- quay.co.uk/ Following the school's closure in the 1960s, it was used to host a temporary local history exhibition in 1971, which had been set up by Jack West of Weymouth Library. The success of the exhibition led to the building becoming the home of the permanent Weymouth Museum in 1972. Later in 1987, plans were revealed for the area's redevelopment, which included transforming part of the harbour into Weymouth Marina. The museum had to vacate the former school, which was set to be demolished, in January 1989. After a period of uncertainty over the future, Weymouth Museum relocated to Brewers Quay, a former brewery which was being transformed into an indoor shopping complex by Devenish Brewery and Weymouth & Portland Borough Council. A 25 year agreement between Devenish and the Friends of Weymouth Museum group was signed and the museum's collection was moved to the new location.https://moderngovdcp.dorsetforyou.gov.uk/documents/s4472/Progress%20report%20Weymouth%20Muesum%20-%20appendix.pdf Brewers Quay opened in June 1990 and Weymouth Museum initially operated alongside the Timewalk exhibition, which took visitors on a journey covering the town's history and maritime connections from the 14th century onwards. The museum later separated from the exhibition in 1999 so that it could be converted into a charitable trust, and re-opened in 2000. However, as Brewers Quay had been suffering operational losses since its opening, a succession of new owners of the building disrupted the museum's plans. Brewers Quay was sold to a local investment group, Brewers Quay Investment LLP, in 2010, and the building then closed for redevelopment. Space was set to be retained for the museum, however the new owners ultimately decided that their plans were not viable. Brewers Quay reopened primarily as an antiques emporium in 2013, which saw temporary space provided for the museum, which re-opened in December that year. Weymouth Museum closed again in 2016, with the Brewers Quay emporium closing in 2017. In January 2016, Weymouth and Portland Borough Council gave approval of Weymouth Museum Trust's plans to relocate and expand the museum within Brewers Quay as part of the building's wider redevelopment project. The trust revealed its intentions to gain some of the estimated ¬£300,000 project cost from the Heritage Lottery Fund, while the council pledged ¬£94,000. In March 2018, the museum reopened using temporary exhibitions to display a small proportion of its collection within Brewers Quay.

Gujarati cinema, informally referred to as Dhollywood or Gollywood, is the Gujarati language film industry. It is one of the major regional and vernacular film industries of the cinema of India, having produced more than one thousand films since its inception. During the silent film era, many individuals in the industry were Gujaratis. The language-associated industry dates back to 1932, when the first Gujarati talkie, Narsinh Mehta, was released. Until the independence of India in 1947, only twelve Gujarati films were produced. There was a spurt in film production in the 1940s focused on saint, sati or dacoit stories as well as mythology and folktales. In the 1950s‚Äì1960s, the trend continued with the addition of films on literary works. In the 1970s, the Government of Gujarat announced a tax exemption and subsidies which resulted in an increase in the number of films, but the quality declined. After flourishing through the 1960s‚Äì1980s, the industry saw a decline through 2000 when the number of new films dropped below twenty. The Gujarat state government announced a tax exemption again in 2005 which lasted until 2017. The industry has been partially revived in the 2010s due first to rural demand, and later to an influx of new technology and urban subjects in films. The state government announced a policy of incentives in 2016. Etymology Bollywood, the sobriquet for the Hindi language film industry based in Mumbai (then called Bombay), inspired the nickname Dhollywood for the Gujarati film industry due to its profuse use of the dhol, a double-headed drum. It is also referred to as Gollywood, a portmanteau derived from Gujarat and Bollywood. History=Silent film era (1913‚Äì1931) Still from left Cinema show times written in typical Gujarati style; (above) Screen-1 Show ‚Äì 12, 3, 6, 9 (below) 12, 3, 6, 9 Even before the advent of talkies there were several silent films closely related to the Gujarati people and their culture, and many directors, producers and actors who were Gujarati and Parsi. Between 1913 and 1931 there were twenty leading film company and studios owned by Gujaratis‚Äîmostly in Bombay (now Mumbai)‚Äîand at least forty-four leading Gujarati directors. The silent film Bilwamangal (also called Bhagat Soordas, 1919) was directed by Rustomji Dhotiwala, a Parsi Gujarati, based on a story by Gujarati writer Champshi Udeshi. This full-length (132 minutes, ) film was produced by Elphinstone Bioscope Company of Calcutta (now Kolkata in West Bengal), and is considered Bengali. Suchet Singh established the Oriental Film Manufacturing Company of Bombay with the help of Hajimahamad Allarakha, an editor of the popular Gujarati magazine Visami Sadi, in 1919. The silent film Narsinh Mehta (1920), produced by Oriental, featured the Gujarati song \\"Vaishnav Jan To\\", which was sung by the audience and musicians in cinema halls with relevant scenes on screen. Dwarkadas Sampat, an early Gujarati film producer, began his involvement with the film industry in Rajkot. He bought a projector and held film shows. He later established Patankar Friends & Company with S. N. Patankar for film productions. Raja Sriyal was the company's first film, but it was not released due to a defective print. Kach-Devyani (1920), directed by Patankar, featured garba dancing, marking the first appearance of Gujarati culture in films. Sampat later founded the Kohinoor Film Company. Kohinoor's first film, Sati Parvati (1920), which also depicted Gujarati culture, was directed by Vishnupant Divekar and featured Prabha, an actress from Rajkot, in the lead role of Parvati. Bhakta Vidur (1921), directed by Kanjibhai Rathod, was implicitly political: The film featured Sampat in the lead role of Vidur, who donned a Gandhi cap, an allusion to the Indian independence movement led by Mahatma Gandhi. The film had a Gujarati song sung by Vidur's wife, \\"\\", referred to the spinning wheel (rentio) on the flag of the Indian National Congress at that time. It was the first film banned in India by British authorities. It was re-released in 1922 under the title Dharm Vijay. Pavagadhnu Patan (The Fall of Pavagadh, 1928) was directed by Nagendra Majumdar and produced by Indulal Yagnik. Yagnik was an independence activist who later headed the Mahagujarat Movement demanding a separate Gujarat state. Yagnik produced ten films under various banners. Kohinoor produced many films in the silent film era, including social problem films in a period dominated by mythological films. Katorabhar Khoon (1920) was its first social film. Manorama (1924) was directed by Homi Master and was based on Hridaya Triputi, an autobiographical poem by the Gujarati poet Kalapi. Gul-E-Bakavali (1924), written by Mohanlal G. Dave and directed by Rathod, ran successfully for fourteen weeks. Manilal Joshi, an experimental Gujarati director, directed Abhimanyu (1922), which was produced by the Star Film Company, and later Prithivi Vallabh based on the novel of the same name by Gujarati author K. M. Munshi. The Krishna Film Company, established in 1924 and owned by Maneklal Patel, produced forty-four films between 1925 and 1931. The Sharda Film Company was established in 1925, financed by Mayashankar Bhatt and run by Bhogilal Dave and Nanubhai Desai. Bhatt also financed Dadasaheb Phalke's Hindustan Cinema Film Company. Early talkies (1932‚Äì1947) Before the 1931 release of the first full-length Indian sound film, Alam Ara, a short Gujarati sound film, Chav Chavno Murabbo, was released on 4 February 1931 in Bombay. It included the song Mane Mankad Karde (\\"A Bug Bites Me\\"), the first sound in any Indian film. The film was produced by Maneklal Patel, with lyrics and dialogue by Natwar Shyam. The title, literally \\"Chew Chew's Marmalade\\", refers to having to chew marmalade to swallow it and probably has no specific connection to the plot. Before the first full-length Gujarati sound film, Narsinh Mehta (1932), two short Gujarati sound films were released with Hindi talkies. The two-reel short Krishna‚ÄìSudama, produced by the Imperial Film Company, was released with Hindi talkie Nek Abala. Another two-reel short, Mumbai ni Shethani was premiered along with Madan's Shirin Farhad on 9 January 1932 at Wellington Cinema, Bombay. It was produced by Theatres of Calcutta and was based on the story written by Champshi Udeshi. The film starred Mohan, Miss Sharifa and Surajram and included the Gujarati song Fashion ni Fishiari, Juo, Mumbai ni Shethani. The release of the first full-length Gujarati talkie, Narsinh Mehta on 9 April 1932 marks the true beginning of Gujarati cinema. It was directed by Nanubhai Vakil, produced by Sagar Movietone, and starred Mohanlala, Marutirao, Master Manhar, and Miss Mehtab. It was of the 'saint' genre and was on the life of the saint Narsinh Mehta. It was followed in 1932 by Sati Savitri, based on the epic story of Savitri and Satyavan, and in 1935 by the comedy Ghar Jamai, directed by Homi Master. Ghar Jamai starred: Heera, Jamna, Baby Nurjehan, Amoo, Alimiya, Jamshedji, and Gulam Rasool. It featured a 'resident son-in-law' and his escapades as well as his problematic attitude towards the freedom of women. Gunsundari was made three times from 1927 to 1948. The film was such a success in its first appearance in 1927, that director Chandulal Shah remade it in 1934. It was remade again in 1948 by Ratilal Punatar. Gunsundari is the story of a poor Indian woman who is disliked by her husband for her moral stand. The woman finally lands on the street where she meets a person who is just like her‚Äîa social outcast. The story ends there. However, the three versions include some changes to reflect their times. There were twelve films released between 1932 and 1940. No Gujarati films were produced in 1933, 1937 or 1938. From 1941 to 1946 there was no production, due to the rationing of raw materials during World War II. Post-independence (1946‚Äì1970) Poster of Gada no Bel (1950), directed by Ratibhai Punatar, was based on the play by Prabhulal Dwivedi. After the independence of India in 1947, there was a surge in the production of Gujarati films. Twenty-six films were produced in 1948 alone. Between 1946 and 1952, seventy-four films were produced including twenty-seven films related to saint, sati or dacoit stories. These stories were designed to appeal to rural audiences familiar with such subjects. Several films produced during this period were associated with myths or folktales people were familiar with. Vishnukumar M. Vyas directed Ranakdevi (1946) based on the legend of Ranakdevi. Nirupa Roy made her debut as an actress in the film and later succeeded in the Hindi film industry playing the role of a mother in various films. Meerabai (1946) was a remake of the Hindi film directed by Nanubhai Bhatt starring Nirupa Roy. Punatar directed Gunsundari (1948) also starring Nirupa Roy. Kariyavar (1948), directed by Chaturbhuj Doshi, introduced Dina Pathak to the film audience. Doshi also directed Vevishal (1949), an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Jhaverchand Meghani. Punatar's Mangalfera (1949) was a remake of the Hindi film Shadi (1941) produced by Ranjit Movietone. Other popular Gujarati films were Vadilona Vanke (1948) directed by Ramchandra Thakur; Gada no Bel (1950) directed by Ratibhai Punatar based on the play by Prabhulal Dwivedi; and Leeludi Dharati (1968) directed by Vallabh Choksi based on the novel of the same name by Chunilal Madia. Liludi Dharati was the Gujarati cinema's first colour film. Between 1951 and 1970, there was a decline in film production with only fifty-five films produced during this period. Malela Jeev (1956) was directed by Manhar Raskapur based on the novel of same name by Pannalal Patel which was scripted by the novelist himself. Raskapur and producer-actor Champshibhai Nagda produced several films including: Jogidas Khuman (1948), Kahyagaro Kanth (1950), Kanyadan (1951), Mulu Manek (1955), Malela Jeev (1956), Kadu Makrani (1960), Mehndi Rang Lagyo (1960), Jogidas Kuman (1962), Akhand Saubhagyavati (1963) and Kalapi (1966). Akhand Saubhagyavati was the first Gujarati film financed by the Film Finance Corporation (now the National Film Development Corporation) and starred Asha Parekh in the lead role. Kanku (1969), directed by Kantilal Rathod, was based on the short story by Pannalal Patel originally written in 1936 and later expanded into a novel in 1970. Kanku won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Gujarati at the 17th National Film Awards, and its actress Pallavi Mehta won an award at the Chicago International Film Festival. Sanjeev Kumar, a popular Hindi film actor, acted in: Ramat Ramade Ram (1964), Kalapi (1966) and Jigar ane Ami (1970). Jigar ane Ami was adapted from the novel of same name by Chunilal Vardhman Shah. Vidhata (1956), Chundadi Chokha (1961), Ghar Deevdi (1961), Nandanvan (1961), Gharni Shobha (1963), Panetar (1965), Mare Jaavu Pele Paar (1968), Bahuroopi (1969) and Sansarleela (1969) were adapted from Gujarati literary works. Rise and decline (1970‚Äì2000) Mallika Sarabhai, Gujarati actress Upendra Trivedi, one of the most successful Gujarati actors and producers. Ketan Mehta who directed Bhavni Bhavai which won two National Awards Following the Mahagujarat Movement, the separate linguistic states of Gujarat and Maharashtra were formed from the Bombay State on 1 May 1960. This had a great impact on the Gujarati film industry as Bombay, the centre of film production, fell in Maharashtra. There was a lack of major film production houses and studios in Gujarat resulting in a decline in the quality and number of films. In the 1970s, the Government of Gujarat announced subsidies and tax exemptions for Gujarati films resulting in a spurt in film production. A studio was established in Vadodara in 1972. The state policy which benefited producers cost the state in 1981‚Äì1982 for the thirty- nine films produced during that period. An entertainment tax exemption of was announced for producers who completed films. This policy resulted in an influx of people interested in monetary benefits who did not have any technical or artistic knowledge, thus the quality of films declined substantially. After 1973 a large number of films were produced focused on deities and dacoits. In 1980, the tax exemption was reduced to 70% but the remaining 30% was given to producers for assistance in other ways.

The Gujarat Film Development Corporation (GFDC) established to promote Gujarati films was closed in 1998. The quality of the films declined due to the focus on recovering the financial investments and profits as well as not adapting to changing times, technology and demographics. Low budget films with compromised quality targeted rural audiences while urban audiences moved to television and Bollywood films with quality content as they had a fair understanding of the Hindi language. Revival (2001‚Äìpresent) Fewer than twenty films a year were produced in the early 2000s. In 2005, the Government of Gujarat announced a 100% entertainment tax exemption for U and U/A certified films and 20% tax on A certified films. The government also announced subsidy for Gujarati films. There was an increase in the number of films produced after 2005 due to the tax exemption and the rise in demand for films in rural north Gujarat, especially Banaskantha district. The demand was fueled by the working class population demanding local musical and linguistic styled films which were mostly released in single screen cinemas. The number of films produced per year was over sixty in 2009 and 2010. In 2012, the Gujarati cinema produced a record number of seventy-two films. Maiyar Ma Manadu Nathi Lagtu (2001) directed by Jashwant Gangani, starring Hiten Kumar, was well received. The film's sequel was released in 2008.

His six films for rural audiences earned . He was called the superstar of Gujarati cinema by various media. Hiten Kumar, Chandan Rathod, Hitu Kanodia, Mamta Soni, Roma Manek and Mona Thiba are popular among rural audiences. The Better Half (2008) directed by Ashish Kakkad failed commercially but drew the attention of critics and an urban audience. It was the first Gujarati film on super 16 mm format and the first released in multiplexes. Little Zizou, a 2009 film in Hindi, Gujarati, and English, written and directed by Sooni Taraporevala, won the Silver Lotus Award or Rajat Kamal in the National Film Award for Best Film on Family Welfare category at the 56th National Film Awards. Muratiyo No. 1 (2005) and Vanechandno Varghodo (2007), both starring Devang Patel, were big budget films but had moderate collections. In August 2011, the Gujarati film industry reached a milestone, having produced over a thousand films since the beginning of the talkies. Veer Hamirji (2012) was an historical film which was shortlisted for Indian representation at the Oscars. The Good Road (2013), directed by Gyan Correa, won the Best Feature Film in Gujarati at the 60th National Film Awards and later became the first Gujarati film ever selected to represent India at the Oscars. The film won the Best Feature Film Jury Award at the Indian Film Festival, Houston in October 2013. Kevi Rite Jaish (2012) and Bey Yaar (2014), both directed by Abhishek Jain; became commercially and critically successful drawing an urban audience. The success of these films drew new actors, directors and producers to the Gujarati film industry which resulted in a spurt in film productions. Gujjubhai The Great and Chhello Divas were declared hit films of 2015. The box office collection of Gujarati films increased from in 2014 to in 2015. Total 65 and 68 films were released in 2014 and 2015 respectively. Total number of screens playing Gujarati films rose from 20‚Äì25 in 2011 to about 150‚Äì160 in 2015. The subsidy by the Government of Gujarat was discontinued in August 2013. Three years later, in February 2016, a new incentive policy was announced which was focused on the quality of films. Films are graded in four categories, A to D, based on technical aspects, production quality, film components, and box office performance. The producers are provided with assistance of for A grade, for B grade, for C grade and for D grade films or 75% of production costs whichever is lower. A film can also receive additional incentives for its performance at film festivals and awards nominations/wins. The multiplexes are also directed to have at least forty-nine screenings of Gujarati films per year. The entertainment tax exemption for Gujarati films released in Gujarat ended with an introduction of the Goods and Services Tax in July 2017. The industry continued to grow due to improvement in production quality, increased use of technology, increased film marketing and new subjects targeted at youth. About 50 to 70 films are released each year between 2016 and 2018. The International Gujarati Film Festival made its debut in New Jersey, US in August 2018. Wrong Side Raju (2016), Dhh (2017), Reva (2018) won the Best Feature Film in Gujarati awards at the 64th, 65th and 66th National Film Awards respectively. Hellaro (2019) became the first Gujarati film to win the National Film Award for Best Feature Film at the 66th National Film Awards. Chaal Jeevi Laiye! (2019) became the highest-grossing film of Gujarati cinema grossing over . On 15 March 2020, all theatres in Gujarat were ordered to be closed following COVID-19 pandemic. Subjects The scripts and stories of the Gujarati films include relationship and family oriented subjects, as well as human aspirations and Gujarati family culture. There were a large number of films based on mythological narratives and folklore produced in the early years of Gujarati cinema. The lives of popular saints and satis of Gujarat, like Narsinh Mehta and Gangasati, were made into films. They were targeted at rural audiences familiar with the subjects. The early filmmakers also included subjects dealing with social reforms. There were social films associated with family life and marriage such as Gunsundari and Kariyavar. The historical, social and religious subjects dominated through 1940s and 1950s. Several Gujarati films were adapted from Gujarati novels and stories such as Kashino Dikro. There was a spurt again in the 1970s for saint/sati films. In 1980s and 90s, the films were influenced by the Hindi cinema and several action and romance films were produced. In the early 2000s, films were targeted chiefly at rural audiences demanding local narratives with local linguistic style. Following 2005, urban subjects were introduced leading to a revival of Gujarati cinema. In recent times, the films which are more relevant to audiences are being produced. Though the comedies continue to succeed at the box office, the films were produced exploring other genres as well. The films focused on large Gujarati diaspora are also produced. Archives About one thousand and thirty Gujarati films were made between 1932 and 2011 but very few are archived. At the National Film Archive of India (NFAI), only twenty Gujarati films including two Parsi-Gujarati films, Pestoneei (1987) directed by Vijaya Mehta and Percy (1989) directed by Pervez Merwanji, are archived. No silent films or talkies of 1930s and 1940s survived.

The Timewalk was an exhibition and visitor attraction located in Brewers Quay, Weymouth, Dorset. It opened in 1990 and closed in 2010. One of Weymouth's most popular attractions, Timewalk took visitors on a journey covering the town's history and maritime connections from the 14th century onwards. It was told by the brewery cat, Miss Paws, and her eight feline ancestors. The attraction aimed to \\"recreate the sights, sounds and smells, of six hundred years of maritime history\\". After being introduced to Miss Paws, visitors were taken around a series of nineteen dioramas depicting various historic scenes, including the Black Death pandemic, the Spanish Armada's attempted invasion, the English Civil War, the use of Portland stone by Sir Christopher Wren for the rebuilding of London after the Great Fire of 1666, Weymouth's Royal Patronage by King George III, local smuggling and Weymouth's important tourism trade following its railway link opened in 1857. The final part of the attraction was Brewery Days, which covered the history of brewing in Hope Square from 1821. It featured the characters Mr Malt, Mr Hops and Mr Yeast which were known as the Brewery Bunch. Adults were able to taste some real ale in the Drum and Dancer Tasting Bar. History Following the closure of Devenish Brewery, Devenish and Weymouth & Portland Borough Council launched a major plan to transform the building into Brewers Quay, a shopping complex with a pub, restaurant and indoor visitor attractions. Opened in June 1990, the new ¬£4.5 million complex included Timewalk and Weymouth Museum, both of which covered the history of Weymouth. The project designer was John Sunderland, and that year, Timewalk won the British Tourist Authority's \\"Come to Britain Trophy\\". Timewalk was one of the area's most popular attractions. In 2004, it was praised as part of the Rough Guide to Britain's entry for Weymouth. In a borough report by the council, Timewalk's annual visitor numbers for 2004 was 41,000. In the summer of 2007, VisitBritain announced that Weymouth was the most searched location on their websites, which was said to have been boosted by both Timewalk and the Sea Life Park. In 2010, Timewalk closed when Brewers Quay shut for redevelopment by Brewers Quay Investment LLP. As part of their plans, it was announced that Timewalk would not be included in the redevelopment, with the attraction being described as \\"no longer justifiable\\" due to dwindling visitor numbers.http://wam.westdorset- dc.gov.uk/WAM/doc/DESIGN%20AND%20ACCESS%20STATEMENT.pdf?extension=.pdf&contentType;=application/pdf&id;=1016031 Instead, a new wet weather attraction was announced as its replacement. However, the plans stalled and in 2013, Brewers Quay re-opened as an antiques emporium. Following its closure, the Timewalk figures were placed in storage within the building. In 2016, Weymouth Museum gave 18 figures to the emporium, who retained some while others were sold.

In addition to helping to facilitate research, a significant proportion of the devices are also used for clinical practice, in accordance with the applicable legislation and the terms of the grants that were used to acquire those devices / equipment. FNUSA-ICRC has participated and continues to participate in several national and European research networks, e.g. CZECRIN/ECRIN (national and European networks for academic clinical trials), ELIXIR (a network for exchanging data in life science), European Sleep Apnea Database, and EATRIS (a network for conducting research in translational medicine). The Centre is taking part in 14 international projects funded by the European Horizon 2020 program.  Research results  Starting in mid-2011, FNUSA-ICRC‚Äôs research activities brought about e.g. the following results by the end of 2018: Nearly 1,700 scientific publications, mostly in reputable international scientific journals Two patents granted and three additional patent applications pending 7 registered designs and utility models for new medical devices and instruments registered with the Industrial Property Office of the Czech Republic 11 prototypes of new diagnostic devices 6 software programs for conducting research or clinical practice 15 international scientific awards such as the Young Investigator Award, Best Innovation Award, Danubius Young Scientist Award and Novartis Discovery Award The Czech Head Kapsch Award for one of the research team leaders  An International team  FNUSA-ICRC has attracted researchers and students from 35 countries who have come to Brno e.g. from Argentina, Brazil, Italy, Mexico, Germany, Portugal, Poland, Austria, Slovakia, Slovenia and the UK to build international research teams. To date, several international training projects for doctors, scientists, students and medical personnel have been implemented within the Centre. These include short-term and long-term study periods at prestigious foreign institutions and visits by foreign specialists to Brno, during which the participants share their experience and take part in research projects. Foreign students of medicine, biology and biomedical engineering programs come to Brno for study periods at FNUSA-ICRC.  Benefits of the Centre  The establishment and existence of FNUSA-ICRC has brought the following benefits to society in Brno, the Czech Republic and throughout the world: The construction of three new buildings has allowed St. Anne‚Äôs University Hospital to move several clinical departments into modern facilities. Some of the diagnostic and therapeutic devices that have been purchased for research are also partially being used for clinical care (in accordance with national and European regulations). Almost every employee of the Centre has had the opportunity to spend some time at foreign research institutions and bring new know-how and experience back to Brno. Every year, FNUSA-ICRC is visited by dozens of foreign experts who share their knowledge with the Centre‚Äôs personnel and students of Brno-based universities, as well as personnel from other research centers. Dozens of public lectures, seminars and workshops organized by the Centre are open to scientists and doctors from other research centers and hospitals, as well as to students. FNUSA-ICRC researchers have contributed to the research and development activities of many industrial enterprises. The patients of St. Anne‚Äôs University Hospital and several other collaborating hospitals have had the opportunity to participate in clinical trials of new drugs and medical devices that are not yet on the market. In respect of cutting-edge technology, FNUSA-ICRC works with many leading academic research institutions and companies from all over the world, thus helping to build a positive image of Brno and the Czech Republic abroad.  Academic partners  FNUSA-ICRC collaborates with a number of major foreign institutions such as Mayo Clinic (USA), The University of California San Diego (USA), Karolinska Institutet and Lund University (both Sweden), The University of Calgary (Canada), The University of South Florida (USA) and others. In addition, other major Czech institutions such as Masaryk University, Brno University of Technology, the University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences in Brno, the Institute of Biophysics and the Institute of Scientific Instruments of the Czech Academy of Sciences also work closely with FNUSA-ICRC The most important partnership thus far has been the collaboration with the Mayo Clinic (USA), whose employees were involved as early as the initial development of the FNUSA-ICRC concept in 2001‚Äì2006. Mayo Clinic specialists act as mentors to several FNUSA-ICRC research teams and, to-date, more than 170 joint articles have been published in foreign scientific journals, and 2 joint US patent applications have been filed.  Collaboration with industry  Collaboration with industry ‚Äì including, above all, pharmaceutical companies, contract research organizations and health technology manufacturers ‚Äì takes several forms. FNUSA-ICRC conducts clinical investigations of new drugs and clinical trials of medical devices. It is a ‚ÄòPrime Site‚Äô preferred partner to the US-based company IQVIA, the world‚Äôs largest intermediary of clinical investigations. In addition, FNUSA-ICRC conducts custom research for both large multinational companies and small local businesses. The volume of contract research continues to increase by almost 100% every year. FNUSA-ICRC also has joint research grants with industrial partners from the Czech Republic and abroad. Furthermore, the commercialization of the first results from FNUSA-ICRC research is being prepared.  Financing of the Centre  Phase 1, 2011‚Äì2015: St. Anne‚Äôs University Hospital received a grant from the EU Structural Funds, under the Operational Programme Research and Development for Innovation, in the amount of CZK 2.3 billion to build FNUSA-ICRC. This grant was supplemented by a subsidy from the national budget, the budget allocation of the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic, for constructing buildings for FNUSA-ICRC, clinic 3 of the University Hospital, a medical library and other premises. In addition, the University Hospital also invested more than CZK 600 million of its own funds in the construction. In the 2011‚Äì2015 period, FNUSA-ICRC received additional grants for research, education, and international cooperation totaling CZK 910 million. Phase 2, 2016-2020 In the 2016‚Äì2020 period, 57% of the cost of operating the Centre is being covered by the state budget of the Czech Republic, the budget allocation for the Ministry of Education of the Czech Republic, the National Sustainability Programme. In the previous phase, the European Union specified establishing this fund as a precondition to be awarded grants from the EU Structural Funds. The Centre must acquire the remaining 43% of the Centre‚Äôs operating and development costs from other sources. To date, more than 80 new grants and 30 projects from industrial partners have been obtained. Supplementary income amounting to at least 43% of the total budget has thus been successfully secured. St. Anne‚Äôs University Hospital covers remaining costs that cannot be covered by any grant sources, which amount to 1‚Äì2% per year. Some of the grants that have been obtained will run until 2022 or 2023 ‚Äì a part of the funding for the post-2020 period has thus already been secured.  Clinical care  FNUSA-ICRC strives to create a harmonious environment in which the patient-health professional relationship is based on a personalized approach, mutual trust and respect, while upholding ethical and moral principles and values. At the same time, international cooperation opens up opportunities to use the latest treatment methods.

Biography  Born in Kuroishi, Aomori Prefecture, he studied English literature at Waseda University and became interested in socialism. In 1913 he learnt Esperanto from Vasili Eroshenko, as a result of a chance meeting, and soon became a leader of the proletarian Esperanto movement, and a member of the \\"La Semanto\\" group in 1921. He visited the USSR in 1927 for the celebrations of the tenth anniversary of the revolution. In January 1931 he helped found the national organization, Japana Prolet- Esperantista Unio (JPEU), with about 150 members, and with Akita as president. He translated Eroshenko's writings into Japanese, and wrote a textbook on Esperanto. The rise of militarism in Japan led to difficulties for Akita; in the autumn of 1933 he was detained for several weeks, and forced to write a long statement about his activities.Janus-faced justice: political criminals in imperial Japan.

Torsten went to Minneapolis and soon got into the rock scene but couldn't get away from that cities powerful funk movement led by Prince, The Time, Andr√© Cymone and others. Back in Sweden they both felt the urge to start a funk band. Torsten had previously played the bass in various punk/rock bands, and Emrik had done some singing in different choirs and also had a leading part in a musical. They recruited their old skateboard pal Christian on drums, a neighbour on bass, Emrik's friend David on Moog and Prophet synthesizers, and Torsten switched to guitar. Torsten came up with the name during a skate session. In 1987 they became the first Swedish band to be interviewed on the Swedish radio show Soul Corner, a radio program covering African-American music. The early Stonefunk sound was guitar-driven rock funk influenced by Jimi Hendrix, Rose Royce and Sly Stone. In 1987 they were considered one of Gothenburg‚Äôs most energetic and exciting live bands and they recorded their first single, \\"Turn it Up\\", released in May 1988 on small indie label Radium. In autumn 1989 they started to work on their first full-length album, Hard as Kryptonite, with producer Christian Falk (later known for his work with Neneh Cherry, Blacknuss all-stars and Robyn). During the recording of the album, the group was joined by toastingstyle-rapper Papa Dee, who brought in more evident hip hop influences than there were on the two previous singles.\\"Inget Snack om Saken, nu √§r Papa Dee en av de Tunga!\\", Frontface magazine issue 3 2008, p. 2a.

In 1990 the group switched labels to Warner, who decided to remix Hard as Kryptonite for an international release entitled Harder than Kryptonite. This remixed version of the album had a jazz-hip hop/Native Tongues direction and new added rap verses. Papa Dee also left the band and embarked on a solo career. The band decided to recruit rapper MC Cane (Marc Eastmond), with whom they recorded a brand new De La Soul-inspired new single entitled \\"Can U Follow\\". The song became a huge dance-floor hit and the video was shown on MTV Europe on a regular basis. The album Harder than Kryptonite was released all around Europe in 1991 and Stonefunkers also embarked on their first European tour, visiting the Nordic countries and Germany. With MC Cane still the main rapper the band recorded the 12\\" single LPC (Lucky People Center), a celebration of percussionist Jean-Louis Huhta club nights of the same name. The actual club featured Ambient house/Trance genres of music but this single was yet another Native Tongues inspired hip hop track. The single was a hit on Swedish radio. In 1992 they started to work on their next album with producer Henryk Lipp. By this time MC Cane had left for a career in graphic design, and today works for one of Sweden's most prestigious and award-winning advertising agencies, Forsman & Bodenfors.Fredrik Hansson, \\"M√•nadens print\\", resume.se October 2007, 6 December 2007.

The album No problem ‚Äô94 (non-believers stand back!) was a huge hit in the spring of ‚Äô93 and spawned two big hit singles, \\"M-rock theory\\" and \\"Funkadeena\\". The recording stint with Warner came to an end in 1994 and Stonefunkers were signed to Stockholm Records subsidiary Breakin‚Äô Bread. They recorded the next album in Haarlem, the Netherlands and also toured the Benelux countries extensively. The effort made in the Netherlands came out in the form of a Material-heavy P-funk-influenced album. The album contained the singles \\"Wreck the show\\" and \\"Individuality\\" but never made an impact in Sweden. The response to the album was greater abroad and Stonefunkers embarked on yet another tour that took them to Austria, Switzerland and other countries.

In 406 BC, he and his forces captured the Volscian city of Anxur (modern Terracina) by securing the high ground above the town, from which they were able to launch attacks against its walls. When the town's defenders attempted to respond to these harassing attacks, the remainder of Numerius' forces used escalade to scale the walls and enter the town. After the victory, his forces began to torture the inhabitants of the city in retaliation for the Volscian massacre of the Roman garrison at Verruga in which the Roman prisoners had been horribly tortured. Numerius eventually showed mercy, and around 2500 Volscians were permitted to surrender with their lives. Numerius was consular tribune in 406 BC,Livy, Ab Urbe Condita iv. 58 and again in 390. It was in his second consulship that he and his two brothers were sent as ambassador to the Gauls who were besieging Clusium. During this mission he participated in an attack against the besieging Gauls. The Gauls demanded that the three should be surrendered to them for violating the law of nations. When the Roman Senate refused to give up the guilty parties, the Gauls marched against Rome, which they sacked after the battle of the Allia.Livy, Ab Urbe Condita v. 35, 36, 41Plut.

Devenish Brewery, also known as J. A. Devenish & Co. Ltd, was a brewery in Weymouth, Dorset, England, that was founded in 1821 by William Devenish. It primarily operated from Weymouth's Hope Square, but also had a facility at Redruth, Cornwall. Devenish was sold to Greenalls in 1993. History Devenish Brewery originated with the Flew Brewery, which had operated from Hope Square since 1742. William Devenish acquired a lease of the brewery in 1821 and then purchased it three years later. The brewery retained the Flew name until 1851, when it was changed to J. A. Devenish & Co. Ltd. The company acquired the Cornish Brewery Co. Ltd at Redruth in 1934 (later renamed Devenish Redruth Brewery Co Ltd in 1960) and the Weymouth-based rival Groves & Sons Ltd in 1960. Devenish faced financial difficulties by the 1980s, and brewing ceased at Hope Square in November 1985. Following its closure, Devenish and Weymouth & Portland Borough Council launched a major plan to transform the building into a shopping centre with a pub and restaurant. Devenish spent ¬£4.5 million on refurbishing the building and transforming it into Brewers Quay, which opened in June 1990. The new complex was hailed as \\"the Covent Garden of Dorset\\" and received numerous awards and commendations. Meanwhile, in February 1986, Devenish merged with Inn Leisure, and brewing was concentrated at the Redruth facility.

Infinite product representation The multiple gamma function has an infinite product representation that makes it manifest that it is meromorphic, and that also makes the positions of its poles manifest.

He fought in the Torstenson War, Second Northern War, and the Scanian War, and led the snaphane militia in guerilla warfare against Sweden in occupied Zealand from 1658 to 1659. He was popularized under the name G√∏ngeh√∏vdingen () in 1853, when his exploits were fictionalized under that name by Danish author Carit Etlar. The historicity of his aliases has since been disputed. Historical account Little is known for certain about the youth of Svend Poulsen. He was probably born around 1610 in north-western Scania or southern Halland.Kim A. Wagner, Fra Svend Poulsen til G√òNGEH√òVDINGEN, \\"SIDEN SAXO\\", vol. 2, 2003, pp.14-21 He was a soldier in the army of Christian IV during the 1625-1629 Danish intervention in the Thirty Years' War, and also served in the Dutch Army. He was made an officer in the Danish army in the Torstenson War from 1643 to 1645.Svend Poulsen G√∏nge at Gyldendals √Öbne Encyklop√¶di He was a citizen of Laholm in Halland, even after it came under Swedish reign in 1645. During the 1657‚Äì1658 Dano-Swedish War of the greater Second Northern War theatre, Poulsen commanded a company of dragoons in April 1657, in the defence of √Ñngelholm in Scania against Sweden. He took part in a number of skirmishes, and was promoted captain in December 1657. After the cession of Scania and Halland at the Treaty of Roskilde of 1658, Svend Poulsen and his dragoons moved to Zealand, where they were ordered to disband. Poulsen led his dragoons once more at the outbreak of the 1658‚Äì1660 Dano-Swedish War, and integrated his company into the defence of Copenhagen. Poulsen himself was sent into occupied Zealand in order to organize a guerilla warfare resistance. On August 22, 1658, a decree ordered the peasants of Zealand to assist Poulsen in harassing the Swedish occupying forces. He assembled a company of snaphane militia within the month of August, though he lacked substantial support from the local populace. He led several successful charges against smaller Swedish contingents, but was finally forced to retreat. He returned to Copenhagen, and later rejoined the regular army. He was probably a part of the city defence during the Assault on Copenhagen in February 1659. He left the army at the conclusion of the war in 1660, and was given the desolate Lundbyg√•rd manor at Pr√¶st√∏. The manor caused Poulsen financial hardships, and in 1666 he appealed for Frederick III to help him, and was in turn granted an additional manor. His financial situation did not improve. Poulsen had to abandon Lundbyg√•rd due to tax debts in 1673. He was granted a lifelong state pension that year, and settled in a smaller residence. He rejoined the army of Christian V for the Scanian War from 1675 to 1679, and first served on Stevns, before he was promoted to the rank of major and commanded a dragoon company in Scania. Some doubt has been cast on his status as major and exact role in the Scanian War. He died around 1680, an old man weakened by illness. Name He was born Svend Poulsen around 1610. A 1673 protocol has the earliest reference to him as \\"Svend Poulsen Gynge\\", Gynge being the contemporary Danish name for the two G√∂inge () hundreds in Scania. Danish historians in the 19th century, used the Gynge name to establish Svend Poulsen as hailing from G√∏nge and leading G√∏nge soldiers, both in Scania in 1657 and on Zealand in 1658. This made him known by the extended name of Svend Poulsen G√∏nge,Bricka, Carl Frederik, Dansk Biografisk Lexikon, vol. XIII [Pelli - Reravius], 1899. \\"Poulsen, Svend\\", J. A. Fridericia, pp.258-259. as well as the fictional construction G√∏ngeh√∏vdingen (). In 1853, Danish author Carit Etlar published the novel Gj√∏ngeh√∏vdingen, a fictional account of Svend Poulsen's exploits as a snaphane during the 1658‚Äì1660 Dano- Swedish War. The book was hugely popular, and G√∏ngeh√∏vdingen stuck as the prevailing alias for Svend Poulsen in Denmark. It has since been argued, that Svend Poulsen wasn't necessarily linked to G√∏nge at all. In the 109 primary sources pertaining to Svend Poulsen, only three mention the Gynge/G√∂inge name; none of these three are written by Svend Poulsen himself. Likewise, the men in his 1657 dragoon company were from Halland and not G√∏nge. The 1658 snaphane company on Zealand were made up of locals and did not contain any G√∏nge people, who served the army elsewhere. The authors of the 19th century historical accounts of Svend Poulsen were also unclear on the historicity of their claims, rehashing each other's myths and fictions, while transforming Svend Poulsen into a G√∏nge leader. His only documented link to G√∏nge prior to 1673, seems to be fighting in Scania during the 1657‚Äì1658 Dano-Swedish War, in close proximity to G√∏nge. In fiction Etlar's Gj√∏ngeh√∏vdingen popularized Svend Poulsen as a righteous and brave leader figure, and he has since been portrayed in a number of fictional works: *G√∂ingeh√∂vdingen, 1953 film, played by Edvin Adolphson *G√∏ngeh√∏vdingen, 1961 film, played by Jens √òsterholm *Dronningens vagtmester, 1963 film, played by Jens √òsterholm *G√∏ngeh√∏vdingen, 1990 musical, played by Kim HarrisJens Kistrup, \\"Kulsoen og kaptajnen p√• scenen\\", Berlingske Tidende, April 28, 1990 *G√∏ngeh√∏vdingen, 1992 TV series, played by S√∏ren PilmarkBonanza - G√∏ngeh√∏vdingen at Danmarks Radio Additionally, Orla Klausen published the comic book series G√∏ngeh√∏vdingen of five albums from 1989 to 1993.ORLA KLAUSEN at Bibliografi.dk In 1998, Nils Hartmann published the children's book G√∏ngeh√∏vdingen.NILS HARTMANN at Bibliografi.dk ReferencesFurther reading *Kim A.

Route description  Highway 805 is a route located northwest of North Bay which serves as a resource access road. There are no established communities along the highway, but access to Sturgeon River Provincial Park and Obabika Lake Provincial Park is provided from trails that branch off of Highway 805. The route begins at a junction with the northern terminus of Highway 539A next to the Sturgeon River, and travels north from that point. Owing to the rugged terrain of the Canadian Shield, the winding highway crosses between Sudbury District and Nipissing District several times, but generally serves as the boundary between the two. On an average day, only 100 vehicles travel along the route. Highway 805, unlike most other tertiary highways, is maintained during the winter months.

He however completed his early education with great distinction and received a M.A. (Bombay University 1945) and PhD (Karnatak University 1955) in Kannada. He started his career as a professor of Kannada at Basaveshwar College, Bagalkot. He soon joined the emerging department of Kannada in Karnatak University, Dharwad as a reader, and went on to build a full-fledged Institute of Kannada studies.Kannada Institute in Karnatak University In recognition of his contribution to the institute, the institute was named after Dr. Hiremath posthumously. He and his team at the institute gathered an extensive collection of rare manuscripts and conducted research. This effort resulted in publication of several important Kannada works especially in the field of Vachana Sahitya. Hiremath had post-doctoral training in Modern Linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley, USA on a Rockefeller Foundation senior fellowshipRockefeller fellowship to Hiremath for a period of 3 years. He was later instrumental in setting up the study of Linguistics at Karnatak University and participated in several Dravidian Linguistics conferences.

It was their first studio album in sixteen years, their last being Indian Summer from 1992. Background For Go West's 20th anniversary, the duo undertook a UK tour in 2005, and at the same time they had started working on the songs for what would become futurenow. On the tour the duo incorporated some of the new songs to get reception from their fans. The long-awaited album was released in June 2008, containing seven new songs and three older tracks. The album was entirely written and produced by Cox and Richard Drummie. It was recorded at redfish studios and Les Ballons du Chien. futurenow saw the band gravitating to a more guitar-based sound. It was met with mixed reviews and its critics relentlessly questioned the band's decision to be the producers of their own album as opposed to handing over the responsibility to a production veteran. The album did not chart in the UK. In 1993 the band performed live at Birmingham's NEC, and this concert was later released as a live album in 2001. Released by Blueprint Records, two new studio songs were included; \\"All Day, All Night\\" and \\"Hangin' On For Dear Life\\". Both of these tracks would later be added to the futurenow album, and at the time of the live album's release \\"All Day, All Night\\" was released as a single. Directly released from futurenow were two singles within the UK. \\"Let Love Come\\" had become a live favourite and therefore the first single from the album. It was initially released as a promotional single sent out to Radio stations, then sold exclusively through Townsend Records. \\"Only Love\\" was released as the second CD single. On the band's 2007 DVD Twenty One, which featured a live concert from 2006, a number of futurenow songs were performed live; \\"Let Love Come\\", \\"All Day, All Night\\", \\"Never Enough\\", \\"Lolita\\", \\"Faded\\", \\"Glow\\", \\"Stars Don't Shine\\". In a 2010 interview with Cox for This is Not Retro, Cox spoke of the album's lack of success, and how this led to him taking the role as a singer in Manfred Mann's Earth Band instead of recording a new Go West album. He revealed \\"For one reason and another Richard and I weren't on the same page about making another album in the middle of last year, and after not being very lucky with radio support for the 'Futurenow' album Richard was a little demoralised while I was wanting to be immediately writing songs and recording another album. So it seemed that we weren't going to be making another record any time soon and I then got a call from Jimmy Copley, who was playing drums for Manfred, because a situation had arisen and he wanted to know if I'd be interested. At the time it seemed that the Go West train had pulled into a station for the time being so I thought I'd try and see if I could make these two things work concurrently.\\" Release The album was released as an MP3 download on such sites as Amazon and iTunes. It was also issued as a digipack CD, through Borough Music, manufactured and distributed under exclusive license to Borough Music Limited via Blueprint. On 21 January 2009, a CD version was released in Japan. Blueprint licensed the album to BMG Japan, Phantom Sound & Vision. Including the four-page inlay that was featured with the UK CD version, the Japanese release also featured a -page booklet with liner notes in Japanese and lyrics in English and Japanese.

Once those affairs were put in order he retired again. In 1939, at the age of 61 and with the paper's fortunes again at a low ebb, McKay and a band of investors took financial control, with McKay was once more appointed editor. With the outbreak of World War II its circulation revived briefly, before falling sales forced its closure in 1950. Personal In 1907 he married Dorothy Hope Sidney. He puffed cigarettes endlessly.

Without direct informed knowledge of autism, a complex disorder, members of the public are influenced by rumors and misinformation presented in the mass media and repeated on social media and the internet. These misinformed beliefs persist even when contradicted by scientific evidence. Folk epidemiology persists because people seek, receive, and preferentially believe information that is consistent with their existing views; misjudge the reliability of their sources of information, and are misled by anecdotal evidence; and tend not to revise their opinions even when their original sources of information are shown to be wrong. The scientific consensus is the MMR vaccine has no link to the development of autism, and that the vaccine's benefits greatly outweigh its risks. Folk beliefs that the MMR vaccine causes autism led to a sharp drop in rates of vaccination in the UK and Ireland after 1998 and corresponding increases in the incidence of vaccine-preventable childhood illnesses, disability, and death.  MMR vaccine and autism  In 1998 Andrew Wakefield published a fraudulent article in a The Lancet, a prominent British medical journal, claiming that the MMR vaccines caused autism. Although the article was later retracted, the idea that vaccines cause autism became a major news story. Alt URL By the time that scientists had shown the narrative to be false, it had become part of the folk epidemiology of autism. The narrative was easy to understand and apparently consistent with anecdotal evidence of children receiving autism diagnoses shortly after having been vaccinated. Doctors were highly critical of the media coverage for triggering a decline in vaccination rates. The false belief has persisted despite a public information campaign aimed at making parents aware that by refusing vaccinations they are putting their children at risk of contracting infectious diseases that are frequently fatal. Mass media Observers have criticized the involvement of mass media in the controversy alleging that the media provided Wakefield's study with more credibility than it deserved. Endorsements by celebrities such as Jenny McCarthy and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. were highly publicized. Later commentary faulted the coverage for giving a misleading impression of the degree to which the evidence supported a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Consequences The scientific consensus is that the MMR vaccine has no link to the development of autism, and that the vaccine's benefits greatly outweigh its risks. The false belief that the MMR vaccine causes autism led to a sharp drop in rates of vaccination in the UK and Ireland after 1998, creating a major public health risk. Lower vaccination rates were followed by increases in the incidence of measles and mumps, and the resulting cases of permanent disability and death. Public fears about vaccination have consumed resources that might otherwise have advanced research into the real causes of autism. There have been thirteen studies that properly followed the scientific method and contained large numbers of participants that failed to connect autism to the MMR vaccine. There have been seven well-constructed studies that have attempted to link autism to thiomersal in vaccines and were unsuccessful. Special interest groups continue to push for more research on the link between vaccines and autism. Further research motivated by the folk epidemiology of autism would represent a lost opportunity to investigate autism's true causes.

The declaration marked Haiti's becoming the first independent Black nation in the Western Hemisphere. Notably, the Haitian declaration of independence signalled the culmination of the only successful slave revolution in history. Only two copies of the original printed version exist. Both of these were discovered by Julia Gaffield, a Duke University postgraduate student, in the UK National Archives in 2010 and 2011. They are currently held by The National Archives, Kew. The declaration itself is a three-part document. The longest section, \\"Le G√©n√©ral en Chef Au Peuple d‚ÄôHayti\\", which is known as the \\"proclamation,\\" functions as a prologue. It has one signatory, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, the senior general and a former slave. Due to Dessalines being illiterate and unable to speak French, his secretary Louis Boisrond-Tonnerre then read out the proclamation, followed by the act of independence, which were both written by the latter.Madiou, Thomas. Histoire D'Ha√Øti. Port Au Prince: Imprimerie De JH Courtois, 1847. Print. This declaration was later followed by an independence day speech from Dessalines‚Äîrecited in Haitian Creole‚Äîin which he denounced France.Madiou, Thomas. Histoire D'Ha√Øti. Port Au Prince: Imprimerie De JH Courtois, 1847. 3:146 In particular, the declaration demands vengeance against the French White Creoles, who committed atrocities against the African-Haitian population. Dessalines claimed that: > \\"It is not enough to have expelled the barbarians who have bloodied our land > for two centuries; ‚Ä¶ We must, with one last act of national authority, > forever assure the empire of liberty in the country of our birth; we must > take any hope of re-enslaving us away from the inhuman government ‚Ä¶. In the > end we must live independent or die.\\" These words presaged the 1804 Haiti massacre, which was supervised by Dessalines. Philippe Girard, a Guadeloupean academic, has noted that the document is multi-layered with references to six different audiences: \\"the French, Creoles, Anglo-Americans, Latin Americans, mixed-race Haitians, and black Haitians\\". Moreover, the Haitian declaration was important because it marked the end of a revolution, not the beginning, unlike most revolutionary struggles prior to the mid-twentieth century. Also, the primary motive behind this revolution was not independence, but rather racial equality and emancipation. Although the declaration repeatedly alluded to \\"freedom from slavery\\", there was no mention of \\"republican rights\\" within the text. As a result, the new nation under Dessalines came to be known as the l‚Äô√âtat d‚ÄôHa√Øti (The State of Haiti), rather than the Haitian Republic. Following independence, Dessalines accorded all power to himself as the \\"head of state\\", which was made possible by the support of the 17 senior officials that signed the third section of the declaration.  Social context  The central issue for the Haitian revolution was independence, specifically freedom from their enslavement under France. In its social and political complexity, the Haitian Revolution resembled the simultaneous revolution in France, since the demand of the revolutionaries was secession from the ruling-class of France.Akamefula, Tiye, Camille Newsom, Burgey Marcos, and Jong Ho. \\"Causes of the Haitian Revolution.\\" Haitian Revolution. September 1, 2012. Accessed March 25, 2015. http://haitianrevolutionfblock.weebly.com/causes-of-the-haitian- revolution.html. Moreover, unlike mainland colonies, Haiti was an easily blockaded Caribbean island with a small population, which made independence a less viable option for them. For the black slaves, a revolution and the subsequent declaration of independence was a route to emancipation and racial equality, following the re-establishment of slavery in 1802 by Napoleon Bonaparte. This decision, in particular, catalyzed the revolution among the slaves who had become more content after the abolition of slavery in 1793. This motive resonated with Dessalines, who was a slave himself. Hence, the eventual declaration in 1804 made several mentions of emancipation and freedom from the \\"cruelties of the French\\", rather than a de jure claim of independence. A similar attempt to attain independence was carried out on the night of 21 August 1791, when the slaves of Saint Domingue rose in revolt and plunged the colony into civil war. Within the next ten days, slaves had taken control of the entire Northern Province in an unprecedented slave revolt. However, the Legislative Assembly in France granted rights to the free people of colour, in addition to dispatching 6,000 French soldiers to the island.Blackpast.com [2], Haitian Revolution 1791‚Äì1804 As a result, a complete secession from France was not undertaken at the time, and only came into effect after slavery was brought back. For the white Creole revolutionaries, the declaration of independence connoted to political autonomy. Nevertheless, the ensuing 1804 Haiti massacre meant that their aims were not fulfilled, and Haiti became the first black sovereign state.Taber, Robert D. \\".\\" 13, no. 5 (2015): 235‚Äì50. doi:10.1111/hic3.12233. (2015). \\"Navigating Haiti's History: Saint-Domingue and the Haitian Revolution\\". History Compass. 13 (5): 235‚Äì50. doi:10.1111/hic3.12233 The massacre‚Äîwhich took place in the entire territory of Haiti‚Äîwas carried out from early February 1804 until 22 April 1804. During February and March, Dessalines travelled among the cities of Haiti to assure himself that his orders were carried out. This ensured that the social and political power then rested with the blacks and those of mixed-descent, thereby completely changing the status quo post-independence. As such, emancipation gave Dessalines an avenue to exercise revenge on the former slave-owners, who were systematically persecuted.Girard 2011, pp. 321‚Äì322.  Declaring Independence  On 1 January 1804, Dessalines, the new leader under the dictatorial 1801 constitution, declared Haiti a state in the name of the Haitian people. Dessalines' secretary Boisrond-Tonnerre stated, \\"For our declaration of independence, we should have the skin of a white man for parchment, his skull for an inkwell, his blood for ink, and a bayonet for a pen!\\". Incidentally, it is claimed that Boisrond-Tonnerre was chosen to author the declaration by Dessalines due to this statement itself. Dessalines assigned all power to himself, by taking the title \\"governor-general for life,\\" which he replaced nine months later with \\"emperor\\". His establishing of a de facto dictatorship was, in fact, implied within the declaration text as well: > \\"Remember that I sacrificed everything to rally to your defense; family, > children, fortune, and now I am rich only with your liberty; my name has > become a horror to all those who want slavery. Despots and tyrants curse the > day that I was born. If ever you refused or grumbled while receiving those > laws that the spirit guarding your fate dictates to me for your own good, > you would deserve the fate of an ungrateful people.\\" Additionally, there is no assertion of \\"republican rights\\", or any \\"rights\\" whatsoever within the declaration. Instead, the idea of independence in this context was restricted to freedom from slavery, not liberalisation. This can be traced from the 1791 slave rebellion to the 1801 constitution by Loverture, who created an authoritarian society that transferred absolute control from the French to Dessalines. The militaristic rule of Dessalines‚Äîwith the support of 17 of the 37 senior army officers that denounced France‚Äîbore similarity to the French Revolution that culminated with the ascent of Napoleon as a dictator in France. Furthermore, even though it was successful, Dessalines opted for a revolution only \\"in one country\\". This has been linked with the need to assuage his British neighbours' fears of rebellion, due to Britain‚Äôs navy controlling the sea-lanes at the time.David Geggus, \\"The Influence of the Haitian Revolution on Blacks in Latin America and the Caribbean,\\" in Blacks, Coloureds and National Identity in Nineteenth-Century Latin America, ed. Nancy Naro (London, 2003), 46.13 In three conciliatory paragraphs that contrast with the strident tone of the rest of the document, Dessalines asks his countrymen to: > \\"Ensure, however, that a missionary spirit does not destroy our work; let us > allow our neighbours to breathe in peace; may they live quietly under the > laws that they have made for themselves, and let us not, as revolutionary > firebrands, declare ourselves the lawgivers of the Caribbean, nor let our > glory consist in troubling the peace of the neighbouring islands. Unlike > that which we inhabit, theirs has not been drenched in the innocent blood of > its inhabitants; they have no vengeance to claim from the authority that > protects them.\\" Despite this, however, the Haitian Revolution and its consequent independence were unlike other revolutions of the time. The general post-independence autocratic tradition in Haiti differentiated it from most other Latin American societies that became republics following a revolution, with the exception of a select few that became monarchies. It was only after the assassination of emperor Dessalines in 1806, that the freed slaves‚Äîalso signatories of the declaration‚Äîwent on to establish Haiti's first republic. The Act of Independence was supposed to be held at the National Archives building in Port-au-Prince and it was there until the government of Fabre Nicolas Geffrard until it was sold to a German who wanted to exhibit in the British Museum. After the 2010 earthquake, in April 2010, a Canadian graduate student at Duke University was studying in London found the only surviving copy in the British National Archives.

Rationale To automate a business process, the required solution logic is based on the corresponding business work-flow and the business rules. Although the business specific logic can be derived from the business domain, however, in order to complete the automation of the business process, some general purpose logic is normally required that cannot be derived from the business domain. Such logic usually offers low level generic functionality that is commonly required to automate multiple business processes e.g. logging incoming service request messages for metering purposes. As different business processes are analyzed, the corresponding general purpose utility logic is identified and delivered as part of the main business processing solution logic (within the same service). Although this method works fine for fulfilling the short-term project requirements, it gets difficult to keep different services, each containing some level of utility logic, in-sync in the long run when it comes to making a change to the contained utility functionality e.g. due to an upgrade of the underlying technology resources (databases, legacy systems). On the other hand, it not only denormalizes the service inventory,Service Inventory due to the redundancy of the utility logic, but also loses the opportunity of making such general purpose logic available for reuse to automate multiple business processes. To address the above issues,Mauro. et al. Service Oriented Device Integration ‚Äì An Analysis of SOA Design Patterns. [online], pp.1‚Äì10, 2010 43rd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2010. Date accessed: 6 April 2010. the Utility Abstraction design pattern dictates the separation of generic processing logic from the business process-specific logic into a separate group of services known as the utility services.Service Layer Types Usage Abstracting Utility Functions Processes A, B and C all contain utility functions which can be of interest to other services. As a result, five different utility functional contexts are created and the related functionality from each process is added to the most relevant functional context. Doing so also eliminates any redundant functionality. This design pattern provides practical guidelines for designing the utility service layer as advocated by the service layers design pattern. These utility services are designed by analyzing the common processing requirements of business services (services that contain business process- specific logic) and then developing the required functionality represented by a meaningful functional context.The kind of the functionality provided. The service boundary of a service is represented by a particular functional context. The functional contexts of utility services would tend to be more technology oriented as compared to entity services as utility services mostly provide technology interfacing functionalityBernhard Borges, Kerrie Holley and Ali Arsanjani.Service-oriented architecture[Online].Date accessed: 17 April 2010. e.g. a wrapper service that talks to a legacy database or a service that provides data conversion functionality between different formats.Dennis Wisnosky.Principles and Patterns at the U.S. Department of Defense[Online].Date accessed: 18 April 2010. It is important to understand that the functional contexts identified for the utility services need to correctly represent the functionality contained within utility services. This places an increased burden on correctly identifying such functional contexts which may prove difficult as the contained functionality is not directly linked to a particular business context and hence cannot be easily categorized into meaningful functional contexts. Some of the suggestions include: * Setting the functional boundary according to the specific technology to which the utility service provides an interface e.g. a utility service for talking to an ERP system. * Identifying the functional boundary according to the category of utility functions e.g. a utility service that performs encryption and decryption of messages. The utility services are mostly used as helper services from multiple business process-specific logic, each having specific requirements, consequently it is better to design utility services that are based on targeted and specific functional contexts rather than vague functional contexts that pack a range of functions. This is important as it not only helps to keep the maintenance overhead of such services to a minimum but also increases the reuse potential of utility functionality because the service consumers can easily identify the required generic functionality as it is not bundled up in a broad functional context that does not correctly represent all of its contained functionality. The application of Canonical ExpressionCanonical Expression design pattern can further enhance the effectiveness of such targeted functional contexts by advocating the use of standardized naming conventions that correctly describe these functional contexts. Considerations By moving the utility logic into separate services, inter-service communication is increased that can introduce latency as well as increased processing overhead. Similarly, due to the distribution of generic logic, the overall design of the service compositionService Composition will become complex and difficult to maintain.

For other information on the region, see Huntingdonshire. The English county of Huntingdonshire has existed since Anglo-Saxon times. Anglo-Saxon times The earliest English settlers in the district were the Gyrwas, an East Anglian tribe, who early in the 6th century worked their way up the Great Ouse and the Cam as far as Huntingdon. After their conquest of East Anglia in the latter half of the 9th century, Huntingdon became an important seat of the Danes, and the Danish origin of the shire is borne out by an entry in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle referring to Huntingdon as a military centre to which the surrounding district owed allegiance, while the shire itself is mentioned in the Historia Eliensis in connection with events which took place before or shortly after the death of Edgar. About 915 Edward the Elder wrested the fen-country from the Danes, repairing and fortifying Huntingdon, and a few years later the district was included in the earldom of East Anglia. Religious foundations were established at Ramsey, Huntingdon and St Neots in the 10th century, and that of Ramsey accumulated vast wealth and influence, owning twenty-six manors in this county alone at the time of the Domesday Survey. In 1011 Huntingdonshire was again overrun by the Danes and in 1016 was attacked by Canute. A few years later the shire was included in the earldom of Thored (of the Middle Angles), but in 1051 it was detached from Mercia and formed part of the East Anglian earldom of Harold. Shortly before the conquest, however, it was bestowed on Siward, as a reward for his part in Godwins overthrow, and became an outlying portion of the earldom of Northumberland, passing through Waltheof, Earl of Northumbria and Simon de St Liz, Earl of Northampton to David I of Scotland. After the separation of the earldom from the crown of Scotland during the Bruce and Balliol disputes, it was conferred in 1336 on William Clinton; in 1377 on Guichard d'Angle; in 1387 on John Holland; in 1471 on Thomas Grey, afterwards marquess of Dorset; and in 1529 on George, Baron Hastings, whose descendants hold it at the present day. Norman conquest The Norman conquest was followed by a general confiscation of estates, and only four or five thanes retained lands that they or their fathers had held in the time of Edward the Confessor. Large estates were held by the church, and the rest of the county for the most part formed outlying portions of the fiefs of William's Norman favourites, including that of Count Eustace of Boulogne. Though not to be confused with Eustace the sheriff of Huntingdonshire, of whose tyrannous exactions bitter complaints are recorded. Kimbolton was fortified by Geoffrey de Mandeville and afterwards passed to the families of Bohun and Stafford. The Hundreds of Huntingdonshire were probably of very early origin, and that of Norman Cross is referred to in 963. The Domesday Survey, besides the four existing divisions of Norman Cross, Toseland, Hurstingstone and Leightonstone, which from their assessment appear to have been double hundreds, mentions an additional hundred of Kimbolton, since absorbed in Leightonstone, while Huntingdon was assessed separately at 50 hides. The boundaries of the county have scarcely changed since the time of the Domesday Survey, except that parts of the Bedfordshire parishes of Everton, Pertenhall and Keysoe and the Northamptonshire parish of Hargrave were then assessed under Huntingdonshire. Huntingdonshire was formerly in the Diocese of Lincoln, but in 1837 was transferred to Ely. In 1291 it constituted an archdeaconry, comprising the deaneries of Huntingdon, St Ives, Yaxley and Leightonstone, and the divisions remained unchanged until the creation of the deanery of Kimbolton in 1879. At the time of the Domesday Survey Huntingdonshire had an independent shrievalty, but from 1154 it was united with Cambridgeshire under one sheriff, until in 1637 the two counties were separated for six years, after which they were reunited and have remained so to the present day. The shire court was held at Huntingdon. Medieval In 1174 Henry II captured and destroyed Huntingdon Castle. After signing the Great Charter John sent an army to ravage this county under William, Earl of Salisbury, and Falkes de Breaut√©. During the Wars of the Roses Huntingdon was sacked by the Lancastrians. The county resisted the illegal taxation of Charles I and joined in a protest against the arrest of the five members. In 1642 it was one of the seven associated counties in which the king had no visible party. Hinchingbrooke House, however, was held for Charles by Sir Sidney Montagu, and in 1645 Huntingdon was captured and plundered by the Royalist forces. The chief historic family connected with this county were the Cromwells, who held considerable estates in the 16th century. 19th century Norman Cross, on the Great North Road, marks the site of the place of confinement of several thousand French soldiers during the Napoleonic wars.

It is named after the Skalnat√© Pleso Observatory in Slovakia where it was produced. The first versions were published by the Czechoslovak Astronomical Society in 1948; later that year, Sky Publishing Corporation acquired the copyright and began publication in the United States. The charts were hand-drawn by Anton√≠n Beƒçv√°≈ô. At the time it was first published, the Atlas Coeli was unique in that it contained essentially all non-stellar objects (star clusters, galaxies etc.) that were visible in an 8-inch telescope, in addition to stars brighter than magnitude 7.75. Until the mid-1970s when it went out of print, the Atlas was extremely popular among amateur astronomers, especially those engaged in comet hunting and the study of variable stars. The Atlas Coeli was also widely used by professional astronomers. Many astronomical observatories still contain copies. Description The Atlas Coeli covers both hemispheres with 16 charts. The coordinate system is referred to equinox 1950.0 and the scale is 1¬∞ = 0.75 cm. There are six charts of the equatorial regions on a rectangular graticule, covering declinations from +25¬∞ to -25¬∞; four charts for each hemisphere with straight, converging hour circles and concentric, equally-spaced declination circles covering declinations 20¬∞ - 65¬∞; and, for each hemisphere, a circumpolar chart covering declination 65¬∞ to the pole. All stars brighter than 7.75 magnitude are included, for a total of 32,571. The stellar magnitudes are indicated by circles with graded sizes. Double and multiple stars are identified and visual binaries are differentiated from spectroscopic binaries. All known variable stars are identified, including novae that had maxima brighter than magnitude 7.75 (totalling 443). 249 star clusters are shown and their relative size indicated. All known globular clusters are shown. 1,130 extragalactic systems are included as are many Galactic objects including planetary nebulae. Bright and dark diffuse nebulae are shown, and the actual outlines of those larger than 10' in diameter are painstakingly drawn. The Milky Way and prominent obscuring clouds within it are indicated by isophotic lines. Constellation boundaries are clearly but unobtrusively drawn. The celestial equator and ecliptic are indicated. The brightest radio sources are also shown. The Atlas Coeli is famous for its clean appearance and for the wealth of data it contains. The drawing is beautifully and precisely done and the printing is excellent. Many other star charts have been strongly influenced by the style of the Atlas Coeli. For instance, the popular Sky Atlas 2000.0 of Wil Tirion adopted the symbols for various types of objects, the division of scales, and the script directly from the Atlas Coeli.Becvar's Atlases Origin The Atlas Coeli was created in the period 1947-1948 at the Skalnat√© Pleso Observatory in Slovakia (then Czechoslovakia) under the direction of Anton√≠n Beƒçv√°≈ô, based on an idea of Czechoslovakian amateur astronomer Josef Klepe≈°ta. Much of the work was carried out by a volunteer group of students at the Observatory; the final plotting of the Atlas, which was entirely hand-drawn, was the work of Beƒçv√°≈ô. Positional and magnitude data were taken from a number of existing catalogs, including the Henry Draper catalog, the Aitken New General Catalog of Double Stars, and the Boss General Catalog. About ten photographic atlases were used as well. To plot each of the objects, one of 20 stencil patterns was selected and positioned. It was also necessary to compute the shift in the apparent position of each of the objects to epoch 1950.0. About 3,000 man-hours of work were involved. The Catalogue of Atlas Immediately after publication of the Atlas Coeli, a supplement was produced called the Atlas Coeli II - Katalog 1950.0. The Catalogue contains data and descriptions of approximately 12000 objects plotted in the Atlas . All stars to magnitude 6.25 are included as well as a large number of the non-stellar objects. Stellar data includes the 1950.0 coordinates with their annual variations; proper motion; apparent magnitude (Revised Harvard Photometric [RHP, or HR] system); absolute magnitude; spectral type (Mt. Wilson scheme); parallax; radial velocity; standard name of star and its constellation; and notes indicating if the star is double or variable. The Catalogue includes a number of other tables with data on double and multiple stars, galactic and extragalactic nebulae, and radio sources. Novel star names Paul Kunitzch found 14 Proper Names of stars that are first attested in the catalogue, and for which he was unable to find any clues as to their origin. For two more he suggested etymologies, but without antecedents in the literature.

For the others, there is no apparent explanation in Latin, Greek or Arabic. Kunitzch spent fifteen years trying to trace the origins of these names in earlier sources and by contacting Czechoslovak astronomers who might know of former collaborators of Beƒçv√°≈ô's, but without success. Amateur astronomers German Hans Vehrenberg and English Patrick Moore follow these names. As of early 2019, the IAU had accepted Achird, Hassaleh, Hatysa, Heze, Kraz, Sarin and Segin as official names for those stars. Publication history A six-color improved version of the Atlas was published by the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences in 1956. The copyright to publish the Atlas outside of Czechoslovakia was purchased by Sky Publishing Corporation in 1949. Under this copyright, the Atlas was published in a series of editions, from a luxurious, full-color version to a black-and-white version of size . Pursuant to Beƒçv√°≈ô's request, royalties were used to purchase special astronomical photographic plates for the Skalnat√© Observatory. Beƒçv√°≈ô went on to create a number of other atlases: Atlas Eclipticalis (the celestial region between ‚àí30¬∞ and +30¬∞ declination on 32 maps), Atlas Borealis (the celestial region north of declination +30¬∞ on 24 maps), and Atlas Australis (the celestial region south of declination ‚àí30¬∞ on 24 maps). Stellar clusters and nebulae are not plotted, but a six-color press was used to distinguish six basic spectral classes of stars. These atlases were especially helpful in the early days of position measurements of artificial satellites.

Norway had begun humanitarian aid to the Congo since at least 1963. In 1963 Norway was one of only six nations that Congo approached with a request for military aid, asking for help to build a navy.

Vidar Helgesen, the Norwegian Secretary of State said: \\"In spite of some hopeful signs in the peace process and the establishment of a transitional government in the capital, Kinshasa, the humanitarian situation in the eastern part of the country is precarious.\\" In 2004 all previous debt was forgiven.

It was published by Midas Interactive Entertainment in Europe two years later and sold as a \\"budget\\" title. Gameplay Typical view. Skier's speed and altitude are shown along with player's air points, personal records and time left. The player takes control of one of four different skier models; two male models and two female ones. Each model can be equipped with one of 11 different pairs of skis, each with their own statistics including Max Speed, Performance, Stability and Response. Then the player can ski on five different international slopes which include Italy, Austria, Japan, Switzerland and Canada in order of increasing difficulty. The game offers two modes, Alpen mode, which is single player and has the player racing against the clock, and Versus mode, which allows two players to compete on the same slope. During a game, the player is required to race downhill to the finish line before the clock runs out. Along the way there are jump points where the skier can pull off stunts and moves in mid-air which grant the player Air Points upon successfully landing. Winding paths, gaps and slopes of varying steepness provide a constant challenge to the skier as he or she travels to the finish line. Each slope is divided into 3 sectors, and each one is timed differently with different counters for Air Points. The player wins a game by reaching the finish line before time runs out. Upon finishing a slope, the player has the option to view a replay of the run and then reaches a Results screen which report the time taken to complete each sector of the slope along with how many Air Points were attained in each one with a total. The player is then brought to a rankings screen which shows the best runs of the slope the player originally picked to play on. An option is also given to save a ghost replay of the run or in case one already exists, to update it.

The column continued in the paper throughout these name changes. Rabbi Philip R.

Epstein, Eulogy for Rabbi Philip R. Alstat, Rabbinical Assembly Proceedings, Vol. 39, 1977, pp103-105. that Alstat wrote, Strange to Relate revealed fascinating and little-known information about Judaism, its history, its people, and their intersection with American and World events. The columns appeared in both English and Yiddish papers, including The American Examiner, and The New York Jewish Week. Quoting poetry, literature, and the latest news stories, ranging from scientific discoveries to international events, he wrote articles about the often surprising and usually unanticipated \\"Jewish connections\\" in the news. Content and titles The subjects of the column were wide-ranging, dealing with facts about the Bible and its stories, the American and world Jewish communities, and historic events in the secular and Jewish calendars. Some examples include: * the Jewish festival of Hanukkah is recorded in the Catholic Bible's Book of Maccabees, but not in the Hebrew Bible; * the ancient Jewish prayer for the New Moon had to be changed after the first lunar moon landing‚Äîtaking out the phrase, \\"but we have never touched you\\"; *after WWII, German money helped print a 17-volume edition of the Talmud‚Äîwhen the Survivors' Talmud (also known as the U.S. Army Talmud, because it was dedicated to the U.S. Army) was published, based on the realization that many Jews in the displaced persons camps were as hungry for Jewish books as they were for food; * there were scientific theories offered by a Russian about the way an unusual alignment of the planets caused the splitting of the Red Sea; * Talmudic rabbis, not Benjamin Franklin, invented the lightning rodJewish Youth Journal, February 1938, quoting Tosephta of Tractate Sabbath, Ch VI, \\"It is proper to place an iron rod over chicken coops in order to protect them against thunder and lightning\\". * one of the first proposals for the Great Seal of the United States was the image of the Israelites crossing through the divided waters of the Red Sea, with Moses standing at the other end, with his hands raised to the sky.

Sample columns=Hebrew and HarvardThe Jewish Examiner, June 9, 1939. The photo of Alstat that accompanied hundreds of his columns. In view of the difficulties encountered in introducing Hebrew as a subject in the high schools and colleges of New York City, one would never suspect that there was a time when the sacred tongue was readily accorded a place of honor in American higher education. This early American reverence for Hebraic scholarship was imported by the Puritans on the Mayflower from its European sources, the general cultural renaissance and the Protestant Reformation. Here in America it was then intensified by the extreme Puritan piety which regarded the Hebrew Scriptures as the direct revelation of God's will. Consequently, when Harvard, the oldest of America's colleges, was founded in 1636 for the training of ministers, it was inevitable that Hebrew should play a significant role as a required course of study for the B.A. degree, in the daily scriptural lessons, and in oratorical and declamation contests (For 38 years, 1722‚Äì1760, it was taught by Judah Monis, a baptized Jewish hardware merchant of Cambridge, Mass.) Moreover, at the Commencement Exercises in 1685, both the President of Harvard, Increase Mather, and his son, Nathanael, delivered their orations in Hebrew. However, the task of mastering this difficult semitic language proved so unpopular with the students that in 1825 the faculty was constrained to make the study of Hebrew optional (which innovation was incidentally the beginning of the elective system at Harvard). In recent years, two Jewish philanthropists, Jacob H. Schiff and Lucius N. Littauer, attempted to revive interest in Hebraism at Harvard by endowing respectively, a Semitic Museum and a chair in Jewish literature and philosophy.Alstat included two references at the end of this column: Rabbi Isidore S. Meyer, in \\"Publications of American Jewish Historical Society,\\" XXXV, pp145-70; and Dr. David De Sola Pool, in \\"Publications of American Jewish Historical Society,\\" XX, pp. 31-83. Maryland Once Denied Its Jews Right to Hold OfficeThe Jewish Examiner, December 1, 1939 Very few people, either Jewish or gentile, know that there was once a state in the Union where Jews were denied complete equality until 1826. That place was the State of Maryland. Though it was one of the thirteen original colonies that raised the flag of revolution against British tyranny, though its representatives were among the signatories to the Declaration of Independence which in 1776 declared that \\"all men were created equal,\\" yet intolerance and religious bigotry persisted for half a century longer. Through the colonial period (1634‚Äì1776) the Jews of Maryland were legally (de jure) not only without any civil rights, but even subject to the penalty of death for merely professing Judaism. Actually (de facto), however, they were tacitly granted undisturbed domicile and gradually allowed certain undefined rights. With the adoption of a state constitution in 1776, the official association of the government and the Christian church was ended. The new law abolished the death penalty for professing Judaism and even granted to Jews the right to vote, but virtually denied them the right to hold office. For in the minds of the people, citizenship and church membership were still so closely identified that those elected or appointed to political office were required by law to take an oath ending with the doctrinal affirmation \\"of belief in the Christian religion.\\" Beginning with 1797, the Jews of Maryland were naturally persistent in their efforts for the removal of all their civil disabilities; but the House of Delegates was equally consistent in rejecting their petitions and defeating the bills designed to bring them relief. Thus the struggle continued, with the aid of influential Christians the pre press of the country, till February 26, 1825, when the House of Delegates, by a vote of 26 to 25, finally passed a bill which provided that Jewish citizens taking the oath of office shall substitute for the affirmation of \\"belief in the Christian religion,\\" another declaration of belief in a future world of rewards and punishments. When this law became effective in 1826, the Jewish emancipation in Maryland was complete. Subsequently, constitutional conventions abolished the religious test altogether.This column included a reference to Prof. J.H.Hollander, in the Jewish Encyclopedia, VIII, pp359-62. Reprints and citations His columns were frequently quoted by rabbis throughout the country in sermons and columns. Additionally, in letters to the editor and personal correspondence, readers would write about \\"their indebtedness to him for their revived interest in Torah and the people of Israel.\\". The columns were frequently reprinted in the works of others during his lifetime, and long after his death. For example, this story of the 13th century Jewish philosopher, Abraham Abulafia, was included in the 1995 collection, A Treasury of Jewish Anecdotes:Lawrence Jeffrey Epstein, A Treasury of Jewish Anecdotes, Jason Aronson, NY:1995, p9, reprinted from Jewish Week, August 30, 1975. > In the summer of 1280, Abraham Abulafia went to Rome to convert the Pope to > Judaism.

Between the end of World War I and 1939, it was part of Poland. It was a significant Jewish shtetl until 1942, when nearly all of its Jewish citizens were murdered in the town square. History The first record of Ilya was in 1473, where it is mentioned as belonging to Bogdan Sakovich, governor of Braslaw for the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1564, Ilya is first mentioned as a town. According to the 1650 inventory, the location included a market square and three streets, 93 yards and 10 public houses. There was also a newly built church, as the previous church burned down shortly before the inventory. Monument in Ilya to the participants of the January Uprising, According to the 1882 Geographical Dictionary of the Kingdom of Poland, the town began as a manor of a Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç prince, and as early as 1634, there was both a Christian church and Jewish synagogue. According to folklore, the prince named his manor and a nearby rivulet \\"Ilya\\" after a dream in which the prophet Elijah (Ilya) came to him. By the 19th century, there was also a yeshiva in Ilya. There is a prominent Catholic church in the village, Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, designed by August Klein completed in 1909. The church survived as a dairy during the Soviet era, but was restored in 1993. Citizens of the town participated in the January Uprising, rebelling against the Russian Empire. A monument was erected to honor the participants in the 1920s. Holocaust By the 20th century, Ilya had a strong Jewish community. After the Soviet invasion of Poland in World War II, the area was annexed back to the Soviet Union. The area fell to the Nazis after Operation Barbarossa, and the Jews of Ilya were forced into a ghetto. On 17 March 1942, 750 to 900 Jews were murdered by Nazi soldiers. The village was burned to the ground in 1944, just before the area was liberated. This episode of Ilya's history was featured in the American adaptation of the TV series Who Do You Think You Are? in 2010. American actress Lisa Kudrow (best known for her role as Phoebe Buffay on the sitcom Friends) traces her family roots to Ilya, where her paternal grandmother, Gertrude \\"Grunia\\" Farbermann, had emigrated from. Her paternal great-grandmother (Grunia's mother), Mera Mordechowicz (–ú–µ—Ä–∞ –ú–æ—Ä–¥–µ—Ö–æ–≤–∏—á), however, stayed, and was among the citizens murdered. In the episode, Kudrow goes to the market square, where the Jews of Ilya had been marched to a pit in the middle of the town. There, German soldiers lined them up two or three at a time at the edge of the pit and shot them, resulting in them falling into it. According to a witness statement which she reads from during the programme, oil was then poured over the stricken victims and a fire was ignited. Locals were said to have heard the screams from those who survived shooting dying in the flames for hours afterwards. In 1962, the Association of Ilya Descendants in Israel published a Yizkor Book, The Book of Ilya, on the history of the shtetl.

He was one of the few people that Stalin looked up to because of his \\"astonishing, outstanding talents\\" and a person whom Stalin called himself a \\"disciple\\" to. Biography=Early years The son of a Gori priest, Lado met Stalin while living in Gori and quickly joined the church school that he attended. He had been attending a better school, the Tiflis Seminary, but had been sent back to the church school after orchestrating a protest and a strike at the Seminary. It was due to Lado's early influence that Stalin first wanted to become an administrator in order to make a better difference. Lado also took Stalin, when Stalin was only thirteen, to a bookstore and bought him a copy of On the Origin of Species by Darwin. Joining the Mesame Dasi Afterwards, while Stalin was attending the Tiflis Seminary at an older age, Lado tried to enter the Kiev Seminary after having gotten himself and all 82 of the other students expelled from the Tiflis Seminary from their strike four years earlier. He was able to enter the Kiev Seminary, but quickly suspicion fell on him and he was arrested. Then he was let out again on police surveillance, but managed to get away from their watch and return to Tiflis, where he met up with Stalin once more. He then showed Silibistro \\"Silva\\" Jibladze, a rather famous man who, in years past, had beaten up the rector of the Tiflis Seminary, to Stalin. Jibladze, Noe Jordania, and some others, had formed a group known as the Mesame Dasi, the \\"Third Group\\", in 1892. The group was a socialist party made up of Georgians. They had all come together in Tbilisi and taken over the newspaper known as Kvali, using it to spread revolutionary messages to the workers in the area. Stalin wished to help with the newspaper and went to the leader of the group, Jordania, to ask to do so. He was swiftly and rudely denied. Lado, disliking Jordania's attitude almost as much as Stalin, took Stalin to the Russian workers' circles that had been forming in Tbilisi. It was here, thanks to Lado, that Stalin would begin to become a true revolutionary. Organizing worker strikes During the latter part of 1899, Lado began organizing a full-scale strike by the workers in Tbilisi and he was eagerly assisted by Stalin. They began the strike on New Year's Day and Lado managed to bring the city to a grinding halt by having the train drivers join him in the strike. However, this was not just let go by the government, as the secret police had been watching their activities for a while. Stalin was arrested by them in January 1900 under the pretense that his father, Beso, had not been paying his taxes in his local village. But the revolutionary group was able to work together to raise the money for his bail. When he finally returned, both Lado and Stalin continued to work on organizing strikes. Later years On May Day of 1900, Stalin began to organize a secret meeting of the revolutionaries, considering it was the day that labor usually demonstrated. However, even with his meticulous secrecy, he was found out and the secret police first came to Lado, but he managed to escape to Baku, leaving Stalin to take his place. No arrests came of the incident, though Stalin did become marked by the police as a leader of the group. In 1901, Lado began to work with Abel Yenukidze in order to print a radical newspaper called Brdzola, \\"Struggle\\". They were able to begin printing it on an illegal printing press in Baku. Death and legacy Finally, in 1903, Lado was arrested in Baku and put in the Metekhi Fortress, a political prison run by the Tsars. While he was there, one day, he had begun yelling \\"Down with Autocracy\\" at the guards and, in return, one of them shot him in the heart. Afterwards, there was no ceremony at his burial, but both Dzhugashvili and Lado's younger brother spoke at his funeral. His brother said that Lado's last words were, \\"They will pay dearly for my death.\\" Because of the great respect and admiration that Stalin held for Lado, one of the few people he ever considered an equal, he had a collection of articles created in 1938 that were dedicated completely to Lado, including a paean made by Lavrentiy Beria. In addition, commemorative articles continued to be made by various newspapers from 1938 onward, until the end of the war, and, in 1953, a monograph was made to immortalize his exploits. In the town of Arali, a statue of Lado was erected in front of the House of Culture. There also used a be a collective farm nearby the town that was named after Lado.

The film was written, directed and produced by Dan Setton, with Tor Ben Mayor and Danny Paran in conjunction with Spiegel TV of Germany and Rai 3 of Italy. It was the first Israeli film to win an International Emmy Award, which it received in the category of Best Documentary.Charlie Rose Interview with Dan Setton , April 27, 1998. Production Paran and Setton had collaborated in the past on a number of Holocaust-themed films, including The Hunt for Adolf Eichmann (1994), Mengele: The Final Account (1995), Revenge (1996) and In the Fuehrer's Shadow (1997) about Martin Bormann. Setton later said that they were looking for a topic for one last film about the Holocaust before they moved on to different subject matter when they came across an article by Amos Nevo in the newspaper Yediot AhronotBarry Davis, \\"Kapo\\" in Arts and Entertainment, p. 22, the Jerusalem Post, date unknown. Paran was shocked to learn that in the early days of Israel, Holocaust survivors persecuted the kapos that they identified, and that dozens of trials were held against the kapos. In one instance, a kapo was even sentenced to death under the same law that would later be used to prosecute Adolf Eichmann, but he died in prison before the sentence could be carried out.Yoav Birenberg, ◊ê◊û◊ô ◊û◊©◊ú◊†◊ï, (\\"Our own Emmy\\"), in Yediot Ahronot, 22 November 2000. Though Paran was the child of Holocaust survivors, he had always regarded the kapos as victims and found the effort to judge them to be \\"a total distortion of reality.\\" He and Setton did not intend to judge them in their film. Paran said, \\"In our view, the people guilty for this horror are, of course, the Germans and not the Jews.\\" Israeli journalist Ilana Dayan, on whose show the film was first screened, later said, \\"This is not a film that judges or analyzes the phenomenon. This is a film that introduces the phenomenon.\\" Nevertheless, the stories often shocked the film's creators. Setton says that he suffered from insomnia long after finishing the film. The plan was to combine eyewitness testimonies and interviews with legal documents describing the prosecution of kapos for collaboration with the Nazis. Paran and Setton also interviewed Haim Cohn, a justice of the Supreme Court of Israel, who had tried a former kapo in the 1960s. In their search for interviews, the filmmakers traveled around the world looking for people who were prepared to admit that they were kapos in the concentration camps. Many of the prospective interviewees refused to take their calls. Others were more willing to tell their side of the story. In Australia, the filmmakers met with Magda, who headed a subcamp of 30,000 Jewish women in Auschwitz. She claimed that she only did good to the prisoners, and that if she beat them or punished them, it was only to save their lives‚Äî\\"not to exterminate them.\\" Reception Response to the film was mixed among both Jewish and non-Jewish audiences. Setton said that at a screening before a Jewish audience in Munich, the younger members of the audience were pleased that someone had dared to broach the subject, while older audience members were outraged. Only a censored version of the film was aired on German television in fear of a hostile reaction by the viewing audience. In France, opposition to the film was so severe that La 25e Heure, the show on which it was screened, was taken off the air. Nevertheless, the film received the International Emmy Award for Best Documentary Film in 2000. It was the highest honor ever received by an Israeli film at the time.

The Security Council reaffirmed its decision to continue the mandate of the UNOSOM II mission until 31 May 1994, with the aim of completing its mission by March 1995. It was important that all parties abided by the obligations they entered into agreements, particularly as agreements signed in Addis Ababa were the basis for resolving the conflict. Concern was expressed at the build up of weapons by Somali factions in several areas of the country. The continuing incidents of fighting and banditry against aid workers and peacekeepers were condemned and disarmament in order to establish peace was stressed. The Council commemorated those who had died and reiterated the importance that was attached to their safety. Furthermore, it was important that district and regional councils, a national council, police and a legal system were founded, with the commitment of the international community in this process was stated. Determining that the situation in Somalia continued to constitute a threat to international peace and security, acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, revised the mandate of UNOSOM II as follows: :(a) assisting with the implementation of peace agreements, particularly in relation to disarmament and respect for the ceasefire; :(b) protecting ports, airports and other essential infrastructure and communication lines; :(c) delivering humanitarian aid; :(d) assisting in the reorganisation of the police and judiciary; :(e) helping in the repatriation and resettlement of displaced persons and refugees; :(f) assisting in the political process in Somalia to achieve a democratically elected government; :(g) protecting personnel from the United Nations and international humanitarian organisations. It also strengthened the mission to 22,000 personnel. The safer regions of Somalia were given priority in reconstruction, as was the process of demining with the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros- Ghali requested to ensure the start of as soon as possible. After reaffirming the continuing arms embargo on the country, the Council urged Somali parties to co-operate with each other and UNOSOM II, respecting the ceasefire and refraining from violence against United Nations and humanitarian personnel. The Secretary-General was in requested to establish contact with Somali parties after consultations with the Organisation of African Unity and the Arab League to agree on a timetable for the implementation of the Addis Ababa Agreements.

It is found in southwest Western Australia. Description Adenanthos cacomorphus grows as a small lignotuberous shrub up to one metre (3 ft) high. The soft and hairy leaves are more or less triangular in shape with 3 to 5 (occasionally up to 7) apical lobes. The single pink flowers consist of a bright pink perianth about 2.5 cm (1 in) long, and a style up to 3.5 cm (1.6 in) long. They are seen over the warmer months from November to March. It resembles its close relative A. cuneatus, but has more deeply lobed leaves and a different flower colour. Taxonomy Botanical specimens of this species had been collected as far back as 1969, but the species was not published until 1978, when Irish botanist Ernest Charles Nelson issued a thorough revision of Adenanthos. He published this species based on a type specimen collected by Kenneth Newbey in Fitzgerald River National Park in 1974. Studies of the species' pollen prior to publication had shown that some pollen grains were \\"grossly misshapen\\", lacking their usual triangular shape, and having more than the usual three pores. He therefore chose the specific epithet cacomorpha from the Ancient Greek kakos (\\"ugly\\"), and morphe (\\"form\\"). Nelson followed George Bentham in dividing Adenanthos into two sections, placing A. cacomorphus into A. sect. Adenanthos because its perianth tube is straight and not swollen above the middle. He further divided the section into two subsections, with A. cacomorpha placed into A. subsect. Adenanthos for reasons including the length of its perianth. However Nelson discarded his own subsections in his 1995 treatment of Adenanthos for the Flora of Australia series of monographs. By this time, the ICBN had issued a ruling that all genera ending in -anthos must be treated as having masculine gender, so A. cacomorpha became A. cacomorphus. The placement of A. cacomorphus in Nelson's arrangement of Adenanthos may be summarised as follows: :Adenanthos ::A. sect. Eurylaema (4 species) ::A. sect. Adenanthos :::A. drummondii :::A. dobagii :::A. apiculatus :::A. linearis :::A. pungens (2 subspecies) :::A. gracilipes :::A. venosus :::A. dobsonii :::A. glabrescens (2 subspecies) :::A. ellipticus :::A. cuneatus :::A. stictus :::A. ileticos :::A. forrestii :::A. eyrei :::A. cacomorphus :::A. flavidiflorus :::A. argyreus :::A. macropodianus :::A. terminalis :::A. sericeus (2 subspecies) :::A. √ó cunninghamii :::A. oreophilus :::A. cygnorum (2 subspecies) :::A. meisneri :::A. velutinus :::A. filifolius :::A. labillardierei :::A. acanthophyllus A. cacomorphus has many characteristics shared with or intermediate between two species with which is co-occurs, A. cuneatus and A. flavidiflorus. There are considered its closest relatives, and it is possible that A. cacomorphus originated as a hybrid between them. Distribution and habitat It is endemic to southern Western Australia, restricted to the Fitzgerald River National Park and surrounds. Adenanthos cacomorphus is found in kwongan growing on sand or sandy gravel. Conservation It is classified as Priority Two - Poorly Known on the Western Australia Department of Environment and Conservation's Declared Rare and Priority Flora List. That is, it is a taxon which is known from few populations, at least some of which are not believed to be under immediate threat. Cultivation It is not known in cultivation, as it is fairly rare, and offers no advantages over the similar and more common A. cuneata.

Since 1991, he took up several ministerial jobs, including Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Minister of Culture and Information, and Minister of Communications. As Adviser to the President of Peace Affairs, he achieved in 2002 his most prominent contribution when he signed the Machakos Protocol with Salva Kiir, the current First Vice President of Sudan and Chairman of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement, which paved the way for the signing of the final Comprehensive Peace Agreement between North and South Sudan in 2005. Atabani has chaired several boards of directors, including those of Sudan News Agency, the National Council for Culture and Arts, and Sudan Academy for Communication Sciences and Information Training. In 2004, Atabani founded Future Trends Foundation (FTF), which is a think-tank in Sudan, active in strategic studies and leadership training. Atabani was a key figure in the National Congress Party (NCP). He was elected Secretary- General of the party from 1996 to 1998 and was, three times, a Member of the National Assembly of Sudan for the NCP. Until October 2013, he was an elected member of the Leadership Bureau of the NCP, an Adviser to the President, and the Leader of the NCP Caucus (Majority) in the Parliament. When South Sudan gained its independence in 2011, the government in Khartoum lost some 70% of its annual revenue from the oil industry, which is located mostly in the South, and by the summer of 2013, the government was forced to make cuts in public spending to accommodate its reduced budget. One initiative was to end the subsidy on fuel supplies, but the means was somewhat clumsy, with a single hike that raised fuel prices by about 60%, but also had a knock-on effect on many other basic commodities, due to increased transport costs. The result was that the poor took to the streets, in a series of large-scale demonstrations that were also poorly handled by the government, with large numbers of protesters being shot dead by the authorities. Atabani was the lead-signatory among 31 reformers who sent a memorandum to the president, deploring the killings and advising a different response the situation. The government was not appreciative and the NCP members were suspended. In October 2013, the 31 signatories, led by Dr. Atabani, announced that they were resigning from the NCP, to found a new party. The key figures, alongside Dr. Atabani, included former Sports Minister Hassan Osman Riziq and the assembly- member Fadlallah Ahmed Abdallah. International influence Fluent in Arabic and English and conversational in French, Dr Atabani has contributed many essays and lectures, in Arabic and English, on political philosophy and on current affairs. He has visited about fifty countries around the world and has participated in many summits, including those of the Arab League and the African Union. He is a recipient of the Order of the Republic and of the Order of Political Accomplishment.

Arm√©e Juive was originally called the Mouvement des Jeunesses Sionistes (M.J.S.) and later evolved into the Organisation Juive de Combat (O.J.C.). Their intention was to protect threatened Jews and take their fighting skills back to Israel to defend the creation of a Jewish State there. At its height, it had over 2,000 members and was primarily concerned with helping Jews escape to Spain via the Pyrenees. The first members of the AJ were recruited from a Torah study group headed by Rabbi Paul Roitman (1920). They included Arnold Mandel, Elie Rothnemer Claude Strauss (writer Claude Vig√©e) and Maurice Hausner. They received funds to finance their activities from Marc Jarblum, the socialist president of the refugee Zionist Organization of France which operated from Switzerland.

Absolute Capital Management (ACM), a hedge fund managed by Homm, once reached a volume of up to three billion US dollars, but collapsed in 2007. Investors are said to have lost 200 million US dollars. Charged with investment fraud in the U.S., he disappeared in 2007. The FBI, SEC and DEA put him on the wanted list. He was arrested in Italy in 2013 after hints from the FBI and faced extradition to the United States. He was subsequently released and currently resides in Germany. He has not been extradited despite a warrant from the U.S. and Switzerland because Germany, like the U.S. and many other countries, does categorically not extradite its own citizens to foreign countries. The only exceptions are in the case European Arrest Warrants, whereby a citizen may be extradited to another EU country only, or arrest warrants by an international court that Germany is a member of, whereby a citizen may be extradited to the location of the court for the purposes of a trial (Art. 16 GG). Early life Florian Wilhelm J√ºrgen Homm was born on 7 October 1959 in Oberursel, a small town near Frankfurt, Germany. His father was self made and had set up a large business including that of welding pipes and installing bathroom fittings, something that did not interest young Florian. Instead, Florian was influenced by his great uncle Josef Neckermann, a successful businessman at whose mansion the entire family would attend weekly gatherings every Sunday. In an interview with Deutsche Welle, Homm described being impressed by his great uncle and with the idea of being wealthy. Homm attended high school in the United States, at Bentley High School (Livonia, Michigan). He subsequently entered Harvard College, graduating in the class of 1982, and he then earned an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1987. Subsequently, he worked for Merrill Lynch, Fidelity Investments and Julius B√§r. Investment activities Homm began his working career in finance at Merrill Lynch and thereafter worked for Fidelity Investments and Julius B√§r before founding his own company. In an interview with DW describing his early impressions of the finance industry, Homm described that he was never interested in the mathematical formulae behind investing. He felt that institutions were taking the wrong approach and needed to take a more holistic approach to investing in stocks. At Fidelity, Homm worked for and trained under fund manager Peter Lynch. He returned to Frankfurt where he served as the senior vice president at the German division of Julius B√§r. In 1993, Homm founded his own company Value Management & Research AG (VMR) in Frankfurt. His company went public in 1998 and made most of its fortune in the period from 1998 to 2000. By December 1999, the company's value had risen seven-fold, while the dot com bubble was getting inflated. He drew attention due to his personal charm, brashness and glamour, with some of his stocks known informally as \\"Homm stocks\\". In 2004 he invested in stock of the German soccer club Borussia Dortmund, through his Cayman Island-based company. With a financial commitment of 20 million euros, he basically saved the club and also contributed to the overthrow of the club management by means of the conditions attached to the payment. In 2005 he co- founded Absolute Capital Management Holdings (ACMH), a hedge-fund company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, which was listed on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange. During this time, Homm enjoyed a great deal of media attention due to the high yields of the hedge fund and was named Hedge Fund Leader of The Year by the investment magazine Alternative Investment News. ACMH managed around three billion euros at the peak of this period. According to his autobiography, Homm in 2006 profitably invested in the Berlin brothel Artemis. Homm again gained much media attention in 2007 when he demanded that the German telecommunications provider freenet AG be split up. In addition, he also took a stake in the TUI travel agency. Resignation, charges and pursuit In September 2007, Homm abruptly announced his resignation as the head of Absolute Capital Management and disappeared. After his resignation, Homm was accused by the remaining management of his company of having valued many of the assets much higher than their actual value. He was supposedly on the run with over 150 million euro. The Absolute Capital Management stock lost 93% of its value up until June 2008. On 25 February 2011, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed civil charges against Florian Homm and Todd M. Ficeto. According to the complaint, Homm's various companies engaged in secretly coordinated bogus trades of penny stocks to drive up the stocks' prices and thereby the value of his hedge fund, a technique known as \\"portfolio pumping\\". On 6 March 2013, Homm was criminally charged with investment fraud in federal court in Los Angeles. According to the complaint, he had caused $200 million in losses. On 8 March, he was arrested in Florence, Italy, where he had gone to meet his ex- wife and son, who live in Florida. The Italian police had been tipped off by the FBI. Homm's lawyers fought extradition by pointing to his suffering from multiple sclerosis. After an expert testified that the disease was at an early to intermediate stage and did not prevent incarceration, the Court of Cassation in Rome ruled on 9 January 2014 that he could be extradited. On 23 June 2014, Homm was released from prison in Italy, after a court ruled that the period he could be held for extradition had expired. He returned to his native Germany.Absolute Capital Founder Homm Released From Italian Jail Bloomberg L.P.. Retrieved 16 March 2015. Germany does not extradite German citizens.

Brady (real name George Patrick Brady, September 7, 1867 ‚Äì November 6, 1903) was a sailor in the United States Navy who received the Medal of Honor for his heroic actions during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Biography George Patrick Brady was born on September 7, 1867, in Ireland and enlisted in the United States Navy at the age of 17 on November 30, 1884. He had risen to the rank of Chief Gunner's Mate by the time of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898. Brady was aboard the torpedo boat during the Battle of Cardenas on May 11, 1898, off the coast of Cuba. During the battle, the Winslow was damaged by Spanish gunfire. Brady assisted in sustaining fire on the Spanish, made efforts to repair the ship's steering gear and helped maintain its watertight integrity to prevent it from sinking. For his heroism he was awarded the Medal of Honor by the Navy on September 3, 1899. In addition to being awarded the Medal of Honor, he was also promoted to the warrant officer rank of Gunner on June 27, 1898 in recognition of his heroism. Register of the Navy of the United States to January 1, 1903. Government Printing Office. Washington. pg. 74. His first assignment following his promotion was to the armored cruiser USS New York. He was reassigned to the Naval Torpedo Station in Newport, Rhode Island on 21 November 1900. Brady committed suicide while serving on board the U.S.S. Monongahela at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine on November 6, 1903. He stated shortly before his suicide that \\"the pain was unbearable\\", but it is unclear if his pain was physical or emotional.http://www.newportri.com/features/medal-of- honor/article_9858f2db-4fb4-5242-9386-96bf853872a4.html He was buried in the Island Cemetery in Newport, Rhode Island, where his wife and children lived. As his tombstone did not indicate that he had received the Medal of Honor, this fact was not discovered until January 2013 when Charles Mogayzel of Pawtucket, Rhode Island was able to find Brady's burial site. Representatives of the U.S. Navy and local veterans organizations dedicated a Medal of Honor grave marker at Brady's grave on Memorial Day later that year. http://www.newportri.com/features/medal-of- honor/article_9858f2db-4fb4-5242-9386-96bf853872a4.html His name in records pertaining to the Medal of Honor is \\"George F. Brady\\", and the name on his tombstone is \\"George P. Brady\\". The reason for this discrepancy is probably that his name was mis-transcribed when his Medal of Honor citation was written.

Much of the distinctive vocabulary of the Sussex dialect has now died out, although a few words remain in common usage and some individuals still speak with the traditional Sussex accent. The Sussex dialect is a subset of the Southern English dialect group. Historically, there were three main variants to the dialect: west Sussex (west of Shoreham and the river Adur), mid Sussex (between the Adur and Hastings) and east Sussex (from Hastings eastwards). There were also differences between downland and Wealden communities. In particular, the people of the Weald were thought to have the most impenetrable accents. The Sussex dialect shows remarkable continuity: the three main dialect areas reflect the historic county's history. The west and mid dialect areas reflect the ancient division of Sussex between East and West, which until the creation of the rape of Bramber in the 11th century lay along the river Adur. The eastern dialect area reflects the unique history of the Hastings area, which was home to the kingdom of the Haestingas until the 8th century. Sussex dialect words have their sources in many historic languages including Anglo-Saxon, Old Dutch, a dash of 14th-century Middle French, and a little Scandinavian. Many words are thought to have derived from Sussex's fishermen and their links with fishermen from the coasts of France and the Netherlands. Features=Accent Below is a set of features of pronunciation in the dialect used across Sussex: * before double d becomes in such words as ladder * before double is pronounced in words as fallow * before t is expanded into ea; rate, mate, plate, gate * before ct becomes , as in satisfaction * before ct becomes , as in affection, effect and neglect * is pronounced as in such words as sheep, week, or field * is pronounced as , and thus mice, hive, dive are pronounced * sometimes becomes , as in pet for pit or spet for spit *io and oi change places respectively, so violet and violent become and , while boiled and spoiled are bioled and spioled *o before n is expanded into o√§ in such words as pony, don't, and bone to be pronounced a po√§ny, do√§nt, and bo√§n * is pronounced as , so that cord and morning become carn and marning; perhaps in a card-cord merger *Father-bother merger: becomes in such words as rod and cross, which sound like rad and crass * (ou) is elongated into aou in words like hound, pound and mound so they are pronounced haound, paound and maound *The final ow is pronounced er, as faller for fallow *Double t is traditionally pronounced as or , so that little and butter sound like liddle and budder; see Intervocalic alveolar flapping *Th-stopping: is invariably : these and them become dese and dem * in its turn is occasionally changed into , turning fodder into fother *Metathesis of final \\"sp\\" in such words as wasp, clasp, and hasp, pronounced as wapse, clapse, and hapse *Words ending in have an additional syllable in the possessive case and the plural; therefore, instead of saying \\"the birds had built their nests near the posts of Mr. West's gate,\\" a Sussex boy would traditionally say \\"the birds had built their nestes near the postes of Mr. Westes' gate;\\" see reduplicated plural In the 19th century, William Durrant Cooper found that the people in eastern parts of Sussex spoke many words with a French accent. For instance, the word day was pronounced dee, and mercy as in the French merci. In Rye, the word bonnet was pronounced bunnet and Mermaid Street was pronounced Maremaid Street. Gender Gender is almost always feminine. There is a saying in Sussex dialect that 'Everything in Sussex is a She except a Tom Cat and she's a He.' Pronouns In the western variant of the Sussex dialect, 'en' and 'un' (sometimes written as 'n) were used for 'he' and 'it' and 'um' was used for 'them.'

Some phrases common to Sussex were common in New England as well, such as \\"you hadn't ought to\\" or \\"you shouldn't ought\\", the use of \\"be you?\\" for \\"are you?\\" and \\"I see him\\" for \\"I saw him.\\" There are also significant links with the dialect of East Sussex and the dialect of African Americans in the southern United States. In particular, the use of dem, dat, and dese for them, that, and these was common in the 19th century both in Sussex and in the southern United States. Other phrases that may appear to be Americanisms were widely used in Sussex dialect. Examples include the use of \\"the fall\\" for autumn, \\"mad\\" for \\"angry,\\" \\"I guess,\\" and \\"I reckon\\". Significant numbers of Sussex people moved to the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries. Even earlier than that, founder of the Province of Pennsylvania, Quaker William Penn, left Sussex for New England with around 200 Sussex Quakers. For several years before the voyage in 1681, Penn lived at Warminghurst Place in Sussex, worshipping near Thakeham. Later, there was also a major migration from Sussex to Ohio in 1822. Future prospects The Sussex dialect and accent are facing extinction. Commuting is on the increase in Sussex, caused by the lack of local employment opportunities coupled with high housing expenses and proximity to London. This has caused people with other accents to move to Sussex and the corresponding loss of the southern dialect.

It assumes a Heisenberg model of magnetism, and explains the differences in exchange energy of transition metals as due to the ratio of the interatomic distance a to the radius r of the 3d electron shell.http://www.nitt.edu/home/academics/departments/physics/faculty/lecturers/justin/students/magnetic/exchange/ When the magnetically important 3d electrons of adjacent atoms are relatively close to each other, the exchange interaction, J_{ex}, is negative, but when they are further away, the exchange interaction becomes positive, before slowly dropping off. The idea of relating exchange energy to inter-atomic distance was first proposed by John C. Slater in 1930, and illustrated as a curve on a graph in a review by Sommerfeld and Bethe in 1933. For a pair of atoms, the exchange interaction wij (responsible for the energy E) is calculated as:Soshin Chikazumi, Physics of Ferromagnetism, Oxford University Press, New York, 1997, p. 125, w_{ij}= - 2 J_{ex} S_i \\\\cdot S_j where: J_{ex} = exchange integral; S = electron spins; i and j = indices of the two atoms. The Slater curve does produce realistic results, predicting Iron, Cobalt and Nickel to be the elements with ferromagnetic ordering. The curve is of practical use as a simple way of estimating J_{ex} based on the average atomic separation. However, more recent evaluations with realistic calculations of the exchange interactions show significantly more complex physics when treating the interactions of different atomic orbitals in an atom separately, rather than as a single unit.

Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons. The characters were created by Chuck Jones. Ralph Wolf has virtually the same character design as another Chuck Jones character, Wile E. Coyote‚Äîbrown fur, wiry body, and huge ears, but with a red nose in place of the Coyote's black one; (usually) white eyes instead of the Coyote's yellow ones; and, occasionally, a fang protruding from his mouth. He also shares the Coyote's appetite and persistent use of Acme Corporation products, but he covets sheep instead of roadrunners and, when he speaks, does not have the upper-class accent or the egotistical bearing of the Coyote. Another crucial difference is that of personality: Ralph does not have the fanatical drive of the Coyote in pursuing his prey, preferring to abandon his chase at the end of the working day. Sam Sheepdog, by contrast, is a large, burly Berger de Brie (Briard) with white or tan fur and a mop of red hair that usually covers his eyes. He very rarely runs and tends to be sedentary in his movements. He does, however, possess sufficient strength to incapacitate Ralph with a single punch once he catches him. Original appearances Inspired by the Friz Freleng cartoon The Sheepish Wolf of a decade earlier (October 17, 1942),\\"The Sheepish Wolf\\". www.bcdb.com, May 13, 2012 Chuck Jones created Ralph and Sam for a series of shorts. The first of these was Don't Give Up the Sheep, released on January 3, 1953. The cartoon proved a success, prompting Jones to repeat the formula five more times between 1954 and 1962. In 1963, ex-Jones animators Phil Monroe and Richard Thompson also starred the duo in their cartoon Woolen Under Where. The series is built around the satiric idea that both Ralph and Sam are blue collar workers who are just doing their jobs. Most of the cartoons begin at the beginning of the workday, in which they both arrive with lunch pails at a sheep-grazing meadow, exchange pleasant chitchat, and punch into the same time clock. Work having officially begun with the morning whistle at 8:00 AM, Ralph repeatedly tries very hard to abduct the helpless sheep and invariably fails, either through his own ineptitude or the minimal efforts of Sam (he is frequently seen sleeping), who always brutally punishes Ralph for the attempt. In many instances, there are also multiple copies of Ralph and particularly Sam. At the end-of-the-day whistle at 5:00 PM, Ralph and Sam punch out their time cards, again chat amiably, and leave, presumably only to come back the next day and do it all over again, or sometimes continue where they left off at the day previous. Or another sheepdog and wolf arrive for work to continue where the other two left off at, as they clock out and head home. Both Ralph and Sam are performed by voice actor Mel Blanc. In A Sheep In The Deep, the workday is interrupted by a lunch break, which they also conduct amiably. The operation seems to run 24 hours a day or at least into another shift, as when Ralph and Sam \\"punch out\\" they may also run into their nighttime replacements, Fred and George, respectively. In some of their earlier appearances, Ralph and Sam are named inconsistently: in particular Sam's shift replacement sometimes addresses him as \\"Ralph\\". Shorts * Don't Give Up the Sheep (1953) Has MCMLI in opening. - Sam is referred to as Ralph. * Sheep Ahoy (1954) - Sam is referred to as Ralph, Ralph is referred to as George, and George is referred to as Sam. * Double or Mutton (1955) * Steal Wool (1957) - Remake of Don't Give Up the Sheep * Ready, Woolen and Able (1960) * A Sheep in the Deep (1962) * Woolen Under Where (1963) Derivative appearances Sam and Ralph have appeared in a handful of Warner Bros. projects since the closing of the studio's animation department. Sam has a cameo in the 1988 film Who Framed Roger Rabbit during the final scene (Ralph does not appear, however), and they occasionally feature in the Looney Tunes comic books published by DC Comics. * Sheep, Dog 'n' Wolf (also known as Sheep Raider) for the original Sony PlayStation and PC, published by Infogrames, is a faithful adaptation of the series' sheep-abducting schemes. The Road Runner makes a cameo appearance in the training level and also in the final level, racing in the desert against Ralph. Ironically, neither Ralph or Sam speak within this game. * Sam Sheepdog appeared in the Taz-Mania episode \\"Mutton for Nothing\\" voiced by Jim Cummings. In this episode, Taz was sent by the \\"Predators \\"R\\" Us\\" temp agency to cover for Ralph Wolf while he is on vacation. Taz tries unsuccessfully to steal the sheep from Sam Sheepdog. A bit of character confusion is at play in this episode, as Sam references Ralph as being \\"that coyote\\". * Sam makes a cameo appearance in the film Space Jam. Though he is mostly seen in the background in the audience during the final basketball match between the Tune Squad and the Monstars, he is seen putting on rabbit ears while cheering for Bugs Bunny and is later visibly shocked when one of the players is squashed by a Monstar named Pound. * Ralph and Sam make a brief cameo in the 2003 feature film Looney Tunes: Back in Action. In the movie, Ralph and Sam are sitting at the same table eating lunch. When Ralph reveals to Sam that he finally caught a sheep, Sam grabs him by the neck and continually punches him in the face. * Sam Sheepdog makes an appearance in Bah, Humduck! A Looney Tunes Christmas. * Sam Sheepdog appears in The Looney Tunes Show opening. * Ralph and Sam appear in Looney Tunes Cartoons with Ralph voiced by Jeff Bergman and Sam voiced by Fred Tatasciore. Pop culture references Sam and Ralph hearing the lunch break whistle in A Sheep in the Deep. On the episode \\"Donut Run\\" of the television program Veronica Mars, Veronica greets rival private detective Vinnie Van Lowe with \\"Mornin' Sam,\\" and he replies, in kind, \\"Mornin' Ralph.\\" Chris Rock mentions Ralph and Sam in his book Rock This!. According to the text, a white classmate of Rock's who racially harassed him in high school not only resurfaced years later as his chauffeur, but also attempted to be amicable and suggested that they get together for coffee. Rock employs the \\"time clock\\" concept to racial tensions in schools by asserting that his tormentor was simply playing the role that he was dealt. The NewsRadio episode \\"Twins\\" played with the reference in reverse. Bill McNeal and Jimmy James pass each other while stepping through Dave's window. Jimmy (the station owner) says, \\"Mornin' Sam,\\" Bill (the office troublemaker) replies, \\"Mornin' Ralph,\\" and Jimmy comments, \\"I love that joke.\\" A deleted scene for the Family Guy episode \\"Tales of a Third Grade Nothing\\" featured Peter Griffin as Sam Sheepdog at the time clock with Ralph Wolf. In the episode \\"Blood in the Water\\" of the USA Network legal drama Suits, Louis Litt compares his relationship with Harvey Specter to \\"Sam and Ralph\\" in a conversation with Mike Ross. He explains that for years, Harvey and he would butt heads during office hours, but at the end of the day they would still be on friendly terms. Litt finishes the analogy by saying that recently Specter had changed and that it now feels like Harvey's \\"always on the clock.\\" Journalist Mark Leibovich mentions Ralph and Sam in an October 2016 New York Times Magazine profile of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, as a metaphor for candidates during previous, more predictable presidential campaigns. The names of Ralph and Sam have been applied to two sets of characters in the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic comic book series, who engage in similar dialogue to Ralph and Sam. The first set are a pair of royal guards‚Äîa typical Pegasus and a bat-winged variant‚Äîwhile the second set are a pair of identical Storm Guards, minions of the primary antagonist of My Little Pony: The Movie. During a scene in the Tomb Raider video game Shadow of the Tomb Raider (Porvenir Oil Fields), two members of the Trinity organization can be overheard greeting one another with an \\"Evening Ralph, Evening Sam\\" exchange.

The film stars Adriano Celentano, Edwige Fenech, Renato Salvatori, Sylva Koscina, Pippo Santonastaso, Gianni Magni and Elisabetta Viviani. It was filmed in Italy. Plot Asso, an ace poker player, has just married his long-time love, Silvia, the most coveted woman in his neighborhood. For her sake, he promises to give up poker, but the unexpected arrival of a notorious player in town and his wife's permission push him into one last game, which he wins. But as he tries to return home the following morning, he is apprehended by Sicario, one of his closer acquaintances and a professional assassin who has been hired to do away with Asso himself. Shot multiple times, Asso dies but returns as a ghost out of worry for leaving his wife behind without any means of supporting herself. Because of their close bond, Silvia can see and hear him, but to anyone else Asso is invisible. After managing to convince his wife that he really is dead, he tries to get her remarried so she won't end up on the streets, and his choice falls on the feeble but rich banker Luigi Morgan. Morgan is of course delighted to win the attention of such a beautiful lady, but this invites the jealousy of Bretella, Asso's rival over Silvia's hand. As it turns out, Bretella had commissioned Sicario to assassinate Asso and now tries to hire him again to finish off Morgan. Shaken by remorse over killing Asso, Sicario refuses and even promises to go to the police, whereupon Bretella kills him and decides to do the job himself. However, after getting a short leave of absence from Hell, Sicario reveals Bretella's true intentions to Asso, who rushes to Morgan's protection. While he cannot prevent Bretella from kidnapping the banker, by taking Police Commissioner Rinaldi for a forced ride and thus catching the attention of the police he does manage to prevent Morgan from getting killed and get Bretella arrested. In his desperation, however, Morgan has started praying to his dead wife for salvation, and once rescued, he revokes his courtship of Silvia due to what he perceives to be his wife's grace. Alone once more (save for Asso's company), Silvia learns of the arrival of a gifted young card player who is a dead look-alike of Asso. Once she falls for him, Asso fades away and goes to Heaven, where God himself invites him to a round of poker and, following Asso's defeat, a rematch in about three thousand years.

The company was founded in 1984 by James Beckett as Beckett Publications. History James Beckett was a statistics professor before launching Beckett Media. In the 1970s, Beckett was responsible for some of the baseball card industry's earliest price guides, which offered more detail on the prices of specific cards than the newsletters that had previously been read by collectors. He founded Beckett Publications in 1984. In January 2005, Beckett sold the company to Apprise Media, which wanted to expand its niche and enthusiast media holdings. The company was renamed Beckett Media as part of the sale. On 26 January 2005, Apprise Media hired Peter A. Gudmundsson as the company CEO. Less than four years after the Apprise Media acquisition, Beckett Media was rumored to again be for sale in May 2008, with five unspecified companies considering purchasing the company. In 2008, the company was sold to Eli Global, a multinational corporation based in Durham, North Carolina, founded in 1991 by Greg Lindberg. In 2010, the company began an overhaul of its online presence. On 8 March 2010, the company announced that it was partnering with SeatGeek as part of its website enhancement. Through the partnership, sports ticket search engine SeatGeek links will be included on all of the site's major sports team and leagues pages that allow viewers to directly access SeatGeek's ticket search system for that team. Products=Magazines Beckett Media publishes price guides and other books related to collectibles and distributes sports memorabilia. One of the company's early publications was Beckett Baseball Card Monthly, which had a peak readership of around one million.Jamieson, pp. 149‚Äì151. In 2008, Beckett converted its four monthly price guides for football, baseball, hockey, and basketball cards, into seasonal titles. Beckett Sports Card Monthly became its only monthly sports related magazine with its premiere in April 2008. The company also publishes four magazines covering non-sports collectible card games, such as Magic: The Gathering, and hobby/entertainment topics such as anime and manga. In 2005, the various titles had a combined circulation of 800,000 copies. In 2008, the circulation varies between 500,000 and 700,000, and the company began cutting back on its monthly publications to reduce overhead. While the plan was successful, it also earned the company flack from consumers and caused a continuing decrease in sales. In 2003, virtual pets site Neopets selected Beckett Media as the publisher of its new monthly Neopets: The Official Magazine. The bi-monthly magazine premiered in September 2003, and was canceled in January 2008 after 26 issues. Beckett replaced the issues remaining in pre-paid subscriptions with their new bi-monthly magazine, Plushie Pals.Letter to subscribers sent by Beckett media Aimed at plushie collectors, Plushie Pals includes pricing guides for a range of plushie lines, including Neopets, Webkinz, Shining Stars, TY Beanie Babies, and Pok√©mon. In October 2009, Beckett replaced Plushie Pals with a new magazine, FUN! Online Games, which focuses on various kid and family oriented online game sites, including Webkinz, Club Penguin, Neopets, Disney Online and Wizard 101. According to the company, in its first month it had 100,000 readers. The company made its first foray into the video game arena in 2006, with the creation of Beckett Massive Online Gamer. The first issue was released in May 2006 and included information for players of various massively multiplayer online games (MMORGs), products related to the games, and articles on lifestyle and entertainment topics. Internet sales Beginning in 1995, Beckett used the internet to facilitate sales of collectibles and sports cards. The company had affiliations with dealers of collectibles, and its website contained a searchable inventory of products, which consumers were able to buy from the sellers through links on Beckett's site. As of 2005, $13 million worth of products were sold through this system, and 165 dealers had affiliations by the following year. Sports card grading The company's publications introduced an early grading system for cards, which provided a way to gauge their condition. Six levels were spelled out, from mint to poor condition.Jamieson, p. 150. Beckett Media runs a sports card grading service, Beckett Grading Services, which is the exclusive grader and authenticator of Topps Vault trading cards. Beckett Media launched an autograph authentication company in 2016. The company, Beckett Authentication Services, is now considered one of the leading autograph authentication companies. Fanspot.com In November 2005, the company began working to create a social networking website for casual sports fans. In April 2006, they launched the resulting site, FanSpot.com, at the 2006 National Sports Collectors Convention. By the end of the month, the site had 1800 registered users. By the end of 2008 user activity on the site ceased completely, though the most parts of the site were still active. By 2013, Fanspot had shut down.

The term can refer to these warp entities and their influence, the servants and worshippers of these entities, or even the parallel universe in which these entities are supposed to reside. The most powerful of these warp entities are those known as the Chaos Gods, also sometimes referred to as the Dark Gods, Ruinous Powers, or the Powers of Chaos. Similarities exist between the Warhammer idea of Chaos and the concept of Chaos from Michael Moorcock's Elric saga,Warhammer 1st Edition which also influenced D&D;'s alignment system. Further similarities can be seen with the godlike extradimensional Great Old Ones of horror writer H. P. Lovecraft's stories. Realm of Chaos The first version of Realm of Chaos is a two-volume publication by Games Workshop concerning the forces of Chaos. The hardback books contain background material and rules for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (1st edition), Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader and Warhammer Fantasy Battle (3rd edition). It consists of the 1988 book Slaves to Darkness and the 1990 follow-up The Lost and the Damned. Each of the two volumes describe the background and associated rules for a pair of antagonistic Chaos gods but each also had material that was germane to Chaos in general in the game settings. Both were written by Rick Priestley, Bryan Ansell, Mike Brunton and Simon Forrest although many more people contributed material, both writings and illustrations. The cover art of Slaves to Darkness was painted by John Sibbick and The Lost and the Damned by Les Edwards. The process in sketching and designing the cover for The Lost and the Damned was investigated within the volume. This was not the case for Slaves to Darkness. The second version of Realm of Chaos was a boxed set released in 1995 covering all of the rules for the Chaos armies (Beastmen, Warriors, and Daemons) in Warhammer Fantasy. The box also contains the magic spell cards and items for the army. Slaves to Darkness Slaves to Darkness features extensive descriptions of the gods Khorne and Slaanesh, complete with a pantheon of their Daemons and rules for including these in tabletop battles as demonic armies. It also features rules on the creation of Chaos Champions and their warbands, Daemon weapons, demonic possession and the Horus Heresy of WH40K. To give flavour for the background and attributes of followers of Chaos it contained material such as a list of over 120 \\"Chaos Attributes\\" - mutations that the followers of Chaos were often afflicted by. This included some mutations that were advantageous, such as those that made the mutant extra strong or taller, and those that confer a disadvantage, such as ones that made the mutant small, weak or stupid. Other mutations were purely cosmetic, such as giving the mutant brightly coloured skin or eyes on stalks, whilst some mutations were clearly comical, such as one that gave the mutant a silly walk (possibly inspired by the Monty Python sketch The Ministry of Silly Walks) and even a mutation that bestowed the \\"gift\\" of uncontrollable flatulence. It introduced the Imperium's Daemonhunters of the Ordo Malleus and their associated Space Marine chapter - the Grey Knights. The volume is also notable for having provided the first complete and coherent narrative of the Horus Heresy, an event which, albeit mentioned as the background justification of the internecine battles featured in the 1/300 scale boxed wargames Adeptus Titanicus and Space Marine, lacked a proper explanation in the WH40K milieu at large. The Horus Heresy firmly locked the concept of chaos and demon influence in the SF universe of WH40K for good, establishing, as a consequence, that the \\"Realm of Chaos\\" was actually the Warpspace that interstellar farers had to traverse in order to defeat the relativistic distances involved in space voyage. The link between the Warhammer and Warhammer 40,000 worlds is explicitly stated in the first pages of the book. The Lost and the Damned The Lost and the Damned covers the background material and Daemons for the other two major Chaos gods Tzeentch and Nurgle. In addition, it contains rules that allow players and game masters to create their own gods and appropriate Daemons. The additional section introduced important elements for Warhammer 40,000, giving background on the early life of The Emperor as well as rules for the Sensei, immortal children the Emperor fathered during his thousands of years of life before he ascended the Golden Throne, who are champions of the cause of \\"good\\". The Sensei have since been written out of the Warhammer 40,000 background, although an explanation for their extermination was given as an Easter egg of sorts in the third edition of the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook. Both volumes also have army lists for Chaos armies and painting guides for miniature figures. They also introduce the idea of daemonic battles, which consist of armies formed primarily from daemons and other immortal followers of Chaos and fought within the realms of Chaos itself. Each was heavily illustrated and interspersed with many short stories related to Chaos. The Lost and the Damned featured the tale of the Horus Heresy's climax and an illustration of the Emperor's climactic battle with Horus. The two books contained a significant amount of violence and sex (although the latter was implied rather than explicit), particularly Slaves to Darkness, which featured Khorne, the god of violence and killing, and Slaanesh, god of pleasure and sensation. Though in the UK Slaves to Darkness carried the note \\"suggested for mature readers\\" on its cover, The Lost and the Damned did not. Labelling it as \\"mature content\\" was a guide for vendors as sales to minors was not legally restricted. Slaves to Darkness features grotesque illustrations by artists such as Ian Miller, Adrian Smith, John Blanche, Tony Ackland and Tony Hough. As the subject matter of the book focused on the gods of violence and pleasure, the illustrations were likewise violent or perverse. The Lost and the Damned featured much more toned down artwork, although some was reused from Slaves to Darkness. Games Workshop stopped publishing the books within a few years. It has been suggested that this was because, in the mid-1990s, Games Workshop began to try to appeal to younger gamers (hence diluting the mature content), rather than only to adults, and the explicit violence of the Realm of Chaos books was seemingly inappropriate for the younger market. Another suggestion is a more prosaic explanation: the Warhammer Fantasy game was revised and re-released in its fourth edition in 1992, an edition which rendered the rules in all the third edition supplements, including Realm of Chaos, obsolete. Warhammer 40,000 was revised along similar lines in 1993. The books are consequently quite rare, with The Lost and the Damned being much the rarer of the two. The reason for this is that a copy of Slaves to Darkness was required to use much of the material in The Lost and the Damned, whereas the former book could be used on its own, and was also released two years earlier than its companion volume. Hence Slaves to Darkness was reprinted twice after its initial release whereas The Lost and the Damned received only a single print run. For more extended and deeper reference lore material on the nature of the Hordes of Chaos, the Realm of Chaos books have been replaced by the newer volume The Liber Chaotica, published by Black Library Publishing. Conceptual origins Warhammer Fantasy, Warhammer Age Of Sigmar, and Warhammer 40,000 depict universes that are out of spiritual and emotional balance. The concept of Chaos Gods has been more or less integral to both ever since they were first conceived. The Chaos Gods in Warhammer are essentially deities worshipped and feared by various groups and that is what makes these groups followers of Chaos. In this idea there is evidently a strong influence from the English fantasy writer Michael Moorcock. Many different Chaos Gods were named in the various early miniature catalogues released by Citadel in the early eighties. But it was never clearly explained what the fictional pantheon looked like. The idea of \\"Four Great Powers of Chaos\\", i.e. Chaos Gods, was first introduced in the two Realm of Chaos sourcebooks released 1988 and 1990 respectively. To date these remain the original and amongst the most detailed pieces of work published by Games Workshop regarding Chaos. The Black Library \\"artbooks\\" of the Liber Chaotica series (released from 2001 to 2006) and Black Industries' Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay supplement, the Tome of Corruption: Secrets from the Realm of Chaos (published 2006) contain as much detail as the original Realms of Chaos sourcebooks (and, in the case of the Liber Chaotica, taken directly from the original books), but with the various additions and changes to the Chaos imagery that GW has introduced over the years ‚Äì although these latter two books focus mainly upon Chaos as perceived through the Warhammer Fantasy imagery. A major factor in both universes about Chaos is that all four of the gods represent things that are good in moderation, but are taken to extremes. For example, Nurgle is the god of life, but the unrestrained, unwholesome life, such as a tumor or festering infection. Chaos Gods The main four Chaos Gods appear in both Warhammer 40,000 and Warhammer Fantasy. The two settings are not actually related to each other despite their names, but in concept the Chaos Gods are similar in both.  Khorne  Khorne: the Chaos God of bloodlust, war, rage, blood, honour in battle, and skulls. Khorne's followers favour close combat and melee weapons, abhorring wizards (in Warhammer Fantasy) or psykers (in Warhammer 40,000), considering them to be below a true warrior and gaining undue advantages from their spells. Khorne is also the god of courage and honor, but these trappings are, more often than not, eventually discarded in favor of the primary goal of killing. While he blesses his followers by granting them strength and martial prowess, Khorne does not truly care from what or whom the blood flows, so long as the blood continues to spill. His Dark Tongue name, \\"Kharneth\\", means Lord of Blood. Khorne is a god who rules from his Skull Throne, revelling in violence and murder. He always inspires his followers to great rage and bloodlust. People may pray to Khorne for great strength but usually end up serving him as a vessel of murder and violence. His material form is a mighty, humanoid being wearing brass armor and sitting atop an enormous throne of skulls, his face twisted in an unnaturally wide smile. His holy number is 8 and his main enemy god is Slaanesh. Those who worship Khorne are strong warriors seeking to earn his favor by slaying mighty beasts and slaughtering mass populations. His main daemons are the Bloodletters (his soldiers), Flesh Hounds (his beasts), and Juggernauts (his daemonic, metal-armoured steeds). They are led by massive Greater Daemons called Bloodthirsters. His realm is described to be a giant killing field with warriors constantly fighting and dying at his feet. His followers often use \\"blood for the Blood God, skulls for the Skull Throne!\\" chanted once or repeatedly as their battle cry.  Tzeentch  Tzeentch: the Chaos God of change, fate, ambition, planning and schemes, lies, politics, sorcery, mutation, hope, and knowledge. Tzeentch's followers are powerful sorcerers who prefer to channel the energies of the Winds of Magic (Warhammer Fantasy), or the Warp (Warhammer 40,000) to kill opponents at a distance rather than get close to enemies or combat them directly. Tzeentch is also the god of progress and understanding, but these principles are abandoned in his plots and plans, his only goal to control and manipulate. Tzeentch may bless his followers with multiple eyes that can see into the next plane of reality, or with avian-like wings, but he still weaves even their fates into his great webs. Tzeentch's Dark Tongue name, \\"Tzeeneth\\", means Master of Change. Tzeentch is always scheming, his every action feeding into his great, winding plots and plans that only he can comprehend. Tzeentch controls and changes the fates of all and weaves them intricately into his devious web of manipulation and greed. People might pray for sight through lies and knowledge, but when Tzeentch listens, he always grants these wishes in twisted ways. He has no material form, as it constantly shifts and changes. His holy number is 9 and his main enemy god is Nurgle. Those who worship Tzeentch are sorcerers and magicians hungry for knowledge and pursuing a greater understanding of the universe. His main daemons are the Horrors (his soldiers), Flamers and Screamers (his beasts), and Discs (his flying, metal discs). They are led by avianoid Greater Daemons called Lords of Change. His realm is described as a crystalline maze that constantly shifts and distorts, leading people who enter it into unimaginable levels of madness. His followers do not normally use a battle cry, instead muttering about \\"the plans\\" during battle.  Nurgle  Nurgle: the Chaos God of decay, plague, despair, disease, endurance, tolerance, joy, acceptance, compassion, empathy, entropy, death, and rebirth. Nurgle's followers draw most of their power in combat from the deadly, putrid diseases they carry and their blights given by these diseases which quite literally energize the followers and even \\"blessed\\" sorcerous technologies they use. Nurgle is also the god of life and rebirth, but these traits are buried under decay and blight due to the War in Heaven and the horrific state of the galaxy's peoples. Nurgle gifts his followers with poxes, boils, rashes, sores and other blights and assorted diseases, but unlike his brethren, he takes pride and happiness in any who follow in his blighted footsteps. His Dark Tongue name, \\"Nurghleth\\", means the Lord of Decay. His power comes from the inevitability of death and decay, and Nurgle is often referred to as 'Grandfather Nurgle', as entropy is the most ancient of forces, and he is the only one who cares for his followers. Nurgle thrives in death and decay, growing more powerful as great plagues spread, and his servants seek only to spread disease. Nurgle also prides himself on the achievements of his followers, \\"gifting\\" them with hideous diseases while sheltering them from pain, fear, disgust, and horror and his followers rejoice in their blessings, shrugging off lethality and disfigurement in a state of rapturous undeath without dying. People in sickness might pray to Nurgle for relief, but rather than heal the sick, Nurgle helps them endure their illness by removing their pain and misery, all the while exacerbating their physical degeneration (though with the best intentions as they were not specific in their prayers). His physical form is a large blob of putrid sickness and disease. His holy number is 7 and his main enemy god is Tzeentch. Those who worship Nurgle are those suffering and wanting freedom from sickness and pain, unaware that they are rapidly becoming more sick yet feeling less pain. His main daemons are the Plaguebearers (his soldiers), his Nurglings (smaller, minuscule versions of himself), his Beasts, and his Rot Flies (his flying, disgusting beasts). They are led by Greater Daemons known as Great Unclean Ones, which are physically manifestations of himself in the material world and so terrible that most mortals are instantly driven insane just by looking at one. His realm is described to be a massive rotting garden filled with death and decay. It is said that he has captured the Eldar (Elven) goddess Isha, who whispers the cures of Nurgle's plagues to those in the material realm.  Slaanesh  Slaanesh: the Chaos God of excess, pleasure, pain, extremes, hedonism, desire, beauty, perfection, excellence, and love. In both settings, they are the youngest of the four gods; they are typically considered androgynous, and while they are often referred to as being male, in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, the Eldar races consider them to be female. Their Dark Tongue name, \\"Slaaneth\\", means the Prince of Pleasure. Their followers seek only to indulge in whatever fleeting whims and desires they feel, and they tend to become graceful, beautiful warriors who harbor selfish, cruel souls. In the Warhammer 40,000 background, they were birthed from the excesses and hedonism of the Eldar society. Their birth created a psychic shockwave that spread across the galaxy, killing most of the Eldar population and their gods; the survivors split into the various Eldar factions. It also created the largest warp storm in the Milky Way, the Eye of Terror, which later became the main residence of the scattered Chaos Space Marines. The fall of the Eldar empire paved the way for the rise of the Imperium of Man. In Warhammer Fantasy, his followers are partly responsible for the corruption of an important Elven leader named Malekith, and the subsequent schism that led to the formation of the Dark and High Elf races. His physical form is an androgynous being of the most physical beauty. His holy number is 6 and his main enemy god is Khorne. Those who worship Slaanesh are those who either wish to achieve the most popularity amongst their fellow men or the most ecstatic pleasure, pleasure beyond imaginable. His main daemons are the Daemonettes (his soldiers), the Fiends (his beasts), and his Steeds (his serpentine mounts). They are led by Greater Daemons called the Keepers of Secrets, lithe creatures with unholy beauty. His realm is described to be a massive castle in the middle of seven circles, each representing one of the classical seven deadly sins. People cannot make it through without succumbing to some type of flaw.  Age of Sigmar  In addition to these Chaos Gods, Warhammer: Age of Sigmar (the sequel game to Warhammer Fantasy) features a number of new members who have ascended to the Chaos Pantheon: * Malice: the Chaos God of anarchy, also known as Malal in early Warhammer canon, is one of the most disputed and lesser known of the Chaos Gods. He represents the anarchical nature of chaos, and so seeks to displace his fellow gods completely. While he does not appear in Warhammer: Age of Sigmar or Warhammer Fantasy, there is a Chaos Space Marine warband in Warhammer 40,000 called the Sons of Malice, which are his followers. His holy number is 11. * The Great Horned Rat: the Chaos God of blight and pestilence, is a recent addition to the Chaos Pantheon, only found in the universe of Warhammer: Age of Sigmar. After the destruction of the Old World and the capture of Slaanesh, the god of the chaos race known as the Skaven, the Horned Rat, was renamed the Great Horned Rat and made a Chaos God. He longs for the destruction of civilization and desires for the respect and becoming the equal of his brother gods, who look down upon him. His physical form is a gigantic anthropomorphic rat. His holy number is 13. The only ones who worship him are the race called the Skaven, half-rat, half-man monstrosities who formerly lived under the earth of the Old World, now spread throughout the Mortal Realms. His main daemons are the Skaven themselves (his soldiers) and their monstrous beasts and machines that they have created. They are led by \\"enlightened\\" priests called Grey Seers and large Greater Daemons called Verminlords, gigantic rats armed with armor and large weaponry. * Hashut: the Chaos God of darkness. Known as the Father of Darkness, Hashut is the god worshiped by the Chaos Dwarfs, now stylized as the Legion of Azgorh. He is described to have a brazen bull head and rules a great city called Zharr-Naggrund, the City of Fire and Desolation. His main followers are the chaos dwarfs and he has some daemons, notably bovine-like monstrosities such as the Lammasu and the Great Taurus. Chaos Space Marines Cosplay of Chaos Space Marine In the table-top wargame Warhammer 40,000, the Chaos Space Marines or Chaos Marines, are Space Marines who serve the Chaos Gods. They are also referred to as the Traitor Legions, primarily in background material written from the perspective of the Imperium. The background shown in both Codex: Space Marines (Haines and McNeill, 2004) and Codex: Chaos Space Marines (Chambers et al., 2002) states that the Chaos Marine Legions were nine of the twenty Legions of Space Marines who fought in the Great Crusade for the Imperium of Man. At this time the Warmaster Horus, first among the Primarchs, and the Luna Wolves Legion (later the \\"Sons of Horus\\") were corrupted by Chaos and instigated the galaxy-wide civil war known as the Horus Heresy. Further background to the Chaos Space Marines is explored in detail in the 'Horus Heresy' series of novels. After the death of Horus and the end of the Heresy, the remnants of the nine Legions along with the other Imperial forces that had joined Horus escaped to a warp-infested area of the galaxy connected directly to the Immaterium that is known as the Eye of Terror. Due to the nature of Chaos, and the temporal instability of the Warp, the very same Chaos Marines who revolted against the Emperor continue to fight against the Imperium. The Legions have kept their old names, with the exception of the Sons of Horus who were renamed the Black Legion by their new leader, Abaddon the Despoiler. Besides Horus, two other Chaos Primarchs were believed to have been killed during or shortly after the Heresy (Konrad Curze of the Night Lords and Alpharius of the Alpha Legion.) The six surviving Primarchs have since become Daemon Princes. These daemonic Primarchs rarely take part in the affairs of their Legions or any part of the Warhammer 40,000 universe. For example, Magnus the Red, Primarch of the Thousand Sons is the most powerful of all the Daemon Prince sorcerers. Yet he rarely enters the battlefield, even though prior to the Horus Heresy he always took part in his Legion's battles and was a determined warrior. Angron however, Primarch of the World Eaters, led an invasion force in what was to become the First War of Armageddon. Some of the Legions have pledged a particular loyalty to one of the four Great Chaos powers but the eight Blood Lords are loyal to Angron alone. The same is the case with the Death Guard, where the Primarch Mortarion's war council is known as the Lords of Decay. Abaddon the Despoiler has taken charge of the Sons of Horus, now known as the Black Legion. Abaddon is the only Chaos Marine since Horus to be able to command the loyalty of all nine Traitor Legions (albeit, temporarily after intense bargaining), and has led thirteen Black Crusades against the Imperium of Man. Black Crusades A Black Crusade comprises a large number of Chaos-aligned forces, from traitor space marine legions to heretical imperial citizens. It is believed to be the one true path to gain the favor of the Chaos Gods. A Black Crusade can be dedicated to a particular Chaos God in order to invoke their blessing and appease the Warmaster's or the heretics' patron. However, one should be careful in dedicating a Black Crusade to a particular Chaos God or multiple Chaos Gods as the Gods are protective of their champions' achievements and jealous of each other. Since M32 (the 32nd Millennium), there have been a total of 13 Black Crusades. *13th Black Crusade: Arguably, the thirteenth Black Crusade is the most (if not only totally) successful Black Crusade yet, with others believing that it signals the end times for the Warhammer universe. It began during the year 999 of M41, when multiple sightings of space hulks were reported. Abaddon the Despoiler (the Warmaster of the 13th Black Crusade) raises a vast armada from the depths of the immaterium, and initiates the largest clash between Imperial and Chaos forces since the Horus Heresy. In the end, this calamity resulted in massive casualties on both sides, with the forces of Chaos prying the powerful fortress world of Cadia out of the hands of the Imperium, a feat that had never succeeded before. Cadia is known as having the only known stable warp- route out of the Eye of Terror, and in addition to its substantial imperial military presence also contains the Cadian pylons ‚Äì massive structures that are responsible (unbeknownst to the Imperium until the 13th Black Crusade) for restricting the Eye of Terror's growth. These artifacts are revealed to have been built by the Necrons, and were thus strategically critical for Abaddon's forces if the crusade was to make any meaningful headway. During the final battle on Cadia, Abaddon commands that a blackstone fortress (an ancient Xenos space station that predates the Imperium, possibly even created by the Old Ones) is flung to the surface of the world, destroying Cadia (and thus the Cadian pylons) and creating the Great Rift, known as the Cicatrix Maledictum by the Imperium, a massive galactic-scale dimensional tear in reality to the warp which destroyed countless inhabited star systems. Social upheaval in the wake of the Great Rift also means that virtually every world of the Imperium, even Terra, is engulfed by conflict.Codex Adeptus Astartes - Grey Knights (8th Edition), pp. 18-19 Forces of the Chaos Space Marines Each of the Chaos Space Marine Legions specializes in a different type of warfare; each of the major Chaos Gods have a legion dedicated to them. The rules for the Chaos Space Marines are currently in their 8th edition, previously being one of the few codices that had not been updated during 7th edition (although both the Black Legion supplements and the Crimson Slaughter supplements have been updated). The Chaos Space Marine Traitor Legions are as follows: * Emperor's Children, once the III Legion of the twenty original Space Marine legions. Their primarch, Fulgrim, was dedicated towards the pursuit of perfection and was said to have given a speech so eloquent that his legion was given the honor of bearing the Emperor's Aquila as their symbol. During one of the Emperor's Children's missions against a xenos race called the Laer, Fulgrim was possessed by a daemon trapped within his sword. He later freed himself and joined Horus as leader of one of the original traitor legions. Driven by hubris and pride, the Emperor's Children later became devotees of the Chaos God Slaanesh, making extensive use of armed with exotic sonic weaponry. * Iron Warriors, once the IV Legion of the twenty original Space Marine legions. Their primarch, Perturabo, grew increasingly jealous of his brother primarchs, particular Rogal Dorn, primarch of the Imperial Fists. Specialists of siege warfare, they often came into conflict with the Imperial Fists, who also specialized in siege warfare. After a series of unrecognized, gruelling attrition battles in which the Iron Warriors became more and more disillusioned, they turned to Chaos and willingly joined Horus against their brother marines. After a series of civil wars they have split apart into numerous warbands, with Perturabo himself achieving daemonhood and retiring to Medrengard, his personal planet filled with large metal fortresses belching smoke and fire. They possess a large number of daemon engines and Obliterators, hulking monstrosities of flesh and metal who can create any weapon they desire from their bodies. * Night Lords, once the VIII Legion of the twenty original Space Marine legions. Their primarch, Konrad Curze (more commonly known as Night Haunter), grew up in the dark world of Nostramo, and took power over the planet's populace by executing and flaying all the criminals that stood in his way. The Night Lords became the most terrifying of the Space Marine legions; whole rebellious worlds surrendered at the knowledge of their arrival. Their primarch was also cursed with multiple visions, including one foreshadowing his own death, thus leading him further into insanity. After discovering that Nostramo had returned to anarchy after his campaign of terror to pacify them along with the fact that the Nostroman psychopaths who replaced the legion's losses were polluting the Night Lords, he ordered the destruction of his home world before fleeing to join Horus. After the Horus Heresy, he allowed himself to be killed by an Imperial assassin, wanting to prove that even the Emperor was willing to resort to such dishonorable actions. Unknown to the rest of his legion, Curze secretly despised his own legion, as they were made up of murderers and killers. The Night Lords currently are a united group of marines specializing in terror attacks, and so possess a large number of Raptors, chaotic versions of jet pack equipped assault marines. * World Eaters, once the XII Legion of the twenty original Space Marine legions. Their primarch, Angron, grew up in the gladiator pits of Nuceria, and plotted a mass rebellion against the planet's rulers. The Emperor rescued him at the last moment, however, leading to his army's destruction and a deep rooted resentment of the Emperor for denying him an honourable death alongside his gladiator brethren. Refusing to accept his legion, he killed the first seven captains before the eighth, Kharn, managed to earn his respect. Christened the World Eaters, Angron's legion was known for their relentless savagery in battle. Having been under Imperial pressure and already bloodthirsty thanks to the mental implants known as the Butcher's Nails, they willingly joined Horus and partook in his rebellion against the emperor. The legion's unity was shattered when their Champion Kharn attacked his comrades in a rage for accepting a ceasefire with another Chaos Legion during a civil war, leading to infighting that caused them to split into smaller warbands. Angron later achieved daemonhood, and currently resides in the Warp. The World Eaters now are devoted to the Chaos God Khorne, boasting more than any other legion. * Death Guard, once the XIV Legion of the twenty original Space Marine legions. Their primarch, Mortarion, was raised by a warlord on a planet filled with noxious fumes, before rebelling against his adoptive father and finding solace with the enslaved populace of the planet. Having been saved by the Emperor from the warlord and denying him his chance to kill him, Mortarion gained a legion who specialized in biological warfare. Having been disillusioned by the Emperor's goals and believing him nothing more than a drunken tyrant, he was brought into Horus's rebellion and joined Horus as one of the four original legions who betrayed the Emperor. Known for their incredible fortitude, the Death Guard fought across the most noxious and hazardous war zones unscathed. Having been tricked by Typhus, the First Captain, into the Warp and besieged by plagues from all sides, Mortarion swore devotion to the Chaos God Nurgle and the Death Guard became fully swollen with disease and death. Having achieved daemonhood later on in history, Mortarion retreated to the Plague Planet which he now spends his time creating new plagues for his master. The Death Guard is composed largely of , specialists in biological warfare and disease. * Thousand Sons, once the XV Legion of the twenty original Space Marine legions. Their primarch, Magnus the Red, was distrusted by all the other Space Marine legions, in particular the Space Wolves, because of his frequent use of magic and the powers of the Warp. Upon learning of Horus' corruption, Magnus sought to warn the Emperor with forbidden warp powers; only to unknowingly breach the Emperor's secret Webway portal Project. To make things worse, the Emperor refused to believe Horus turned traitor and sent the Space Wolves to apprehend the Thousand Sons for trial. Unfortunately, the Space Wolves were tricked by Horus into purging the Thousand Sons on their homeworld of Prospero. With his cities burning and his soldiers being slaughtered, Magnus had no choice but to swear fealty to the Chaos God Tzeentch, escaping into the Warp. Because of their frequent use of the Warp's magical energies, the Thousand Sons were cursed with frequent mutations, thus they historically numbered usually no more than a thousand Space Marines before Magnus' arrival. After a period of stability due to Magnus' use of warp powers, the mutations returned tenfold after turning to Chaos. In order to stop these mutations, their chief librarian Azhek Ahriman secretly cast a powerful spell which stopped the mutations while enhancing the powers of all psychic marines. However, the spell inadvertently turned the non-psychic marines into dust and bound their souls inside their Power Armors; reducing them to semi-distant automatons known as Rubric Marines. Of all Chaos Space Marine legions the Thousand Sons possesses by far the most Chaos Sorcerers. * Black Legion, once the XVI Legion of the twenty original Space Marine legions. Formerly the Luna Wolves, their primarch, Horus Lupercal, was the first primarch discovered by the Emperor and was raised alongside his birth father, becoming the Emperor's most trusted primarch. After all the other primarchs were discovered, Horus was named the Warmaster and was granted command of all the Space Marine legions. He renamed his own legion the Sons of Horus, but a twinge of doubt existed in him as the Emperor kept secrets from Horus regarding the reason why the Emperor left the Great Crusade. After an accident which resulted in the Word Bearers manipulating Horus to fall under Chaos's sway, Horus openly declared a rebellion against the Emperor, instigating the Horus Heresy. After a series of attacks, most notably the purging of loyalists from the traitor legions on Isstvaan III and the decimation of the loyalist legions on Isstvaan V, Horus finally faced off against his father on Horus's flagship, the Vengeful Spirit, and was killed by the Emperor. In shame, the Sons of Horus painted their armor black, renamed themselves the Black Legion, and fled back into the warp. Now Ezekyle Abaddon, the former First Captain of the Sons of Horus, has sought to reunite all the forces of chaos under him in a bid to destroy the Imperium, christening himself the Despoiler. He has launched thirteen Black Crusades against the Imperium, the most recent being the setting of the current 40K universe. * Word Bearers, once the XVII Legion of the twenty original Space Marine legions. Their primarch, Lorgar Aurelian, venerated the Emperor as a god, but was censured and made an example of because the Emperor rejected religious superstition through the \\"Imperial Truth\\". Having grown disillusioned, Lorgar ventured into the Warp to seek new gods to believe in, discovering new masters in the Chaos Gods, who claimed they were vital to humanity's survival, and became the first legion to fall to Chaos. They orchestrated Horus's corruption and the entire Horus Heresy. Lorgar himself later achieved daemonhood, and the Word Bearers remain relatively intact post-heresy due to their strong belief in the dark gods and cohesive nature of the legion, but are currently split between Kor Phaeron (former 1st captain) and Erebus (chief dark apostle). Currently they make extensive use of daemons and possessed Space Marines, and possess large numbers of Dark Apostles, priests who guide the members of the Word Bearers further in to the veneration of the Chaos Gods. * Alpha Legion, once the XX Legion of the twenty original Space Marine legions. The last primarch to be discovered, Alpharius had a secret unknown to everyone: he actually had a twin named Omegon. The Alpha Legion was primarily used for secret missions, as they were known for their use of deception and subterfuge. It is said that after being revealed the future by an alien race, Alpharius joined Horus in his betrayal of the Emperor as a secret bid to finally eradicate Chaos from the universe. After the Heresy one of the two primarchs was said to have been killed by Guilliman, the primarch of the Ultramarines, while another may have been secretly killed by Rogal Dorn on Pluto. However, knowing the Alpha Legion's frequent lies and dissent, no one knows if one of them really survived or whether both survived. The Legion frequently uses Chaos Cultists for infiltration and sabotage, spreading throughout the universe in a web of lies and deceit. Alongside the Traitor Legions, there have been many Space Marine Successor Chapters who have also fallen under the sway of Chaos. Some of the most notable ones are as follows: * Red Corsairs, once the Astral Claws, their chapter master Lufgt Huron, power-hungry and seeking to create a legion-sized force of Astartes, led several other chapters in a rebellion against the Imperial into what would later been known as the infamous Badab War. After being injured and nearly killed, Huron fled to the Warp alongside his chapter and were rechristened the Red Corsairs, with their leader becoming Huron Blackheart, the Tyrant of Badab. The Red Corsairs have amassed a massive pirate fleet, becoming a force to be reckoned with, rivalling that of the ancient traitor legions. *Crimson Slaughter, once the Crimson Sabres, their chapter master Sevastus Kranon led their chapter on a crusade in the Warp, severing all connections with other Space Marine chapters though remaining loyal to the Imperium. After a massacre on Umidia however, the chapter was cursed by the Chaos God Khorne and forced to suffer painful hallucinations of all the people they killed. Driven mad by these unending visions, the Crimson Sabres found a moment of peace in their minds when conducting genocides. Forsaking the Imperium and renaming themselves the Crimson Slaughter, this warband is featured in Warhammer 40,000's starter set, Dark Vengeance, led by the Chaos Lord Kranon the Relentless. *The Judged. In an event that will be known as the Abyssal Crusade, thirty Space Marine chapters were sent into the Warp on a mission under the influence of an Imperial Saint named Basillius (later revealed to be a Chaos worshipper and executed), with only one managing to return. The rest of these chapters became Chaos warbands or were completely killed. Some notable warbands are the Death Shadows, the Iconoclasts, and the Vectors of Pox. The legions are often featured in short stories and novels published by Games Workshop's publishing arm, The Black Library. Since the Horus Heresy, many Space Marine Chapters have been corrupted in one way or another by Chaos. No specific rules exist for renegade chapters, allowing players to adapt other rules to represent their forces. According to the records of the Ordo Malleus (the Inquisition branch body responsible for protecting the Imperium from Chaos and daemons), approximately 50 chapters have turned renegade after the Horus Heresy; however, the accuracy of this number is doubtful. Examples of given Space Marine chapters include the Sons of Malice, the Damned Company of Lord Caustos, the Violators, the Steel Cobras, the Thunder Barons, the Sons of Vengeance, the Silver Guards, etc. Beside those chapters the forces of chaos are also strengthened by individual corrupted companies or detachments from loyalalist Space Marine chapters; forming smaller warbands or joining other renegade chapters. Differences between Chaos Space Marines and Space Marines The Chaos Space Marines have the same origins as the Space Marines. Due to their allegiance to Chaos, Chaos Marines can be mutated or willingly possessed (except for the Thousand Sons Rubric Marines), thus making themselves into monsters, faster or otherwise superior to the Space Marines and other inhabitants of the Warhammer 40k universe. Chaos Marines have extended lifespans due to the time-warping effects of the Eye of Terror, and the fact that space marines as a whole are unable to die of old age, and their millennia of experience gives them levels of mastery with more advanced skills and tactics that Loyalist Space Marines do not have. However, they are inhibited by their own anarchic nature, limited numbers, and constant infighting. If they were to organize and form an army equivalent to the tactical army of the Imperium, they would be a greater threat than they are now. Abaddon of the Black Legion seeks to unite all of the Chaos forces and lead them to a last Black Crusade against the Imperium. However, due to the hostility of chaos space marines toward each other, other legions and warbands, it took Abaddon 13 Black Crusades to finally cause significant damage towards the Imperium by launching a full-scale attack and occupation of Cadia. Chaos Marines are equipped with the power armour and weapons they had when they initially betrayed the Imperium, which are broadly the same as those used by Space Marines (although some differences now exist). The current setting of the Warhammer 40,000 game is about 10,000 years after the Horus Heresy, and, while the Imperium has made some technological advancements, Chaos Marines have far more limited access to the handful of new inventions that have appeared on the galactic scene. For example, Iron Warriors are known for capturing and using Imperial tanks. This is not a strong differentiating factor though, as the Imperium merely replicates or rediscovers technology designed during the \\"Golden Age of Technology\\" (also known as the \\"Dark Age of Technology\\") and has very little understanding of it; thus there have been very few developments during the last 10,000 years. Other tie-ins * The death metal band Debauchery released several tracks/albums with references to the World Eaters. Most notable is the track \\"KILL MAIM BURN!\\". * The British death metal band Bolt Thrower released a song titled \\"World Eater\\" on their album Realm of Chaos. The entire album is, in fact, themed around the Warhammer 40,000 concept of Chaos, as evidenced by the Games Workshop-produced artwork of the original printing, and song titles such as \\"Plague Bearer\\", \\"Dark Millennium\\", and \\"Through The Eye Of Terror\\". *American Doom Metal band Cirith Ungol released the songs \\"Chaos Rising\\" and \\"Join the Legion\\" on their 1991 album Paradise Lost. Warhammer 40,000 Parallel to realspace, where mortal creatures live, is the Warp, a realm of pure psychic energy. This realm is influenced by the thoughts, emotions, and urges of all sentient beings. The psychic energies sometimes coalesce into sentient entities. The most powerful of these entities are the four Chaos Gods. They are served by a host of daemons and constantly seek to expand their influence over humanity. In essence, the mortals of the galaxy are molested by monsters spawned by their own collective id. Though they are often at odds with each other, the Chaos Gods' common goal is to crush the worship of the God-Emperor and convert and consume the sentient inhabitants of the material universe (although ironically this would mean the end of the Chaos gods). Chaos is a malevolent force that twists the bodies and minds of mortals exposed to it. Followers of Chaos are often lunatics who sport hideous mutations. Many humans worship the Chaos Gods in the hopes of alleviating their misery, advancing their ambitions, or gaining access to magical power, perhaps not understanding the terrible price they will ultimately pay. By far the people most vulnerable to Chaos influence are those with psychic ability. Unless they are carefully trained to resist daemonic possession, psykers can become living conduits by which daemons can enter the mortal world and wreak havoc. There are no \\"good\\" gods in Warhammer 40,000, or at the least the good ones are greatly weakened, if not completely destroyed. The God-Emperor barely survives in a persistent vegetative state after a terrible battle with his son Horus who was corrupted by Chaos, and he is powerless to remedy the brutality, corruption, and ignorance that plagues his empire. After the Eldar gave birth to Slaanesh, their pantheon are all either dead or can do little to help their beleaguered people: most were killed by Slaanesh shortly after its birth, Cegorach (the Laughing God, an archetypical trickster) and Khaine (god of war and bloodshed) both fled, Isha (The Eldar Goddess of Fertility, Life, Healing and Growth) is captured by Slaanesh, and later \\"rescued\\" by Nurgle. Since she is captured by Nurgle and fed the diseases he concocts, the best she can do is whisper the cures for his diseases into the material universe. The Necrons were cursed to undeath by their gods, and eventually rebelled against them. The Ork deities are as anarchic, violent and cruel as they are, while the Tau and Tyranids have none at all. Positive human feelings like love, altruism, valor, and invention are perverted by the Chaos Gods. For instance, Nurgle might represent acceptance and mercy, as he genuinely adores his worshippers and considers his plagues to be blessings. Tzeentch represents innovation and change, and a human who delves in science, invention, or social change risks becoming corrupted and mutated by his influence. Khorne thrives on violence of any sort, including that used by the Imperium to fight his own cultists. Chaos is the root cause of most of the galaxy's problems. While Slaanesh gestated in the Warp, widespread warp storms cut off interstellar travel, leading to the collapse of the glorious human civilizations of old. When Slaanesh was finally born, the psychic shockwave slaughtered most of the Eldar race, leaving a tiny fraction of nomadic survivors. The Emperor of Mankind tried to reunite humanity, to bring it into a new golden age, but the Chaos Gods seduced and corrupted roughly half his Space Marine followers in an event known as the Horus Heresy and he was felled in battle, and his empire plunged into a dark age that has endured for 10,000 years. Warhammer Age of Sigmar Chaos stems from the Realm of Chaos, a mysterious dimension of raw magical energy and the home of the four Chaos Gods. Long ago, massive amounts of raw Chaos energy spilled forth into the world, its mutating power giving rise to many monsters such as trolls and the Skaven. Most forms of magic practiced by wizards use some form of refined Chaos energy, which are classified as the Winds of Magic. For instance, when Chaos energy filters through the natural world, it transforms into the Green Wind of Magic, which Jade Wizards and Druids can use for healing spells. Jade Wizards are at their most powerful wherever life is most abundant, and at their weakest where life is sparse (deserts, winter, etc.). Dark Magic makes use of unrefined Chaos energy and is thus the most dangerous.

Professional and political careers After Figueroa's undergraduate studies, he moved to New Hampshire and worked as a community organizer, going door-to-door to organize Latinos regarding employment and educational issues. Following law school, Figueroa moved to Hartford and served as an Assistant Attorneys General, where he litigated day care center abuse cases and violations of environmental laws. Subsequently, he won election to the Connecticut General Assembly from Hartford's Third District. After three terms, he left the legislature to become the president and general counsel of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund (now \\"LatinoJustice PRLDEF\\"), a national civil rights group based in New York City. After nearly a decade in New York City, he returned to Connecticut as head of Universal Health Care Foundation of Connecticut. At the foundation he oversaw the effort to pass a Connecticut universal health care bill. The legislative undertaking was successful. Governor Jodi Rell vetoed the bill; Figueroa's group organized the coalition that successfully lobbied the legislature to override the veto.

Lentini (Sicilian: Lintini, Ancient Greek: ŒõŒµŒøŒΩœÑŒØŒΩŒøŒπ; Latin: Leontium), historically Leontini or Leontinoi, is a town and comune in the Province of Syracuse, South East of Sicily (Southern Italy). History The city was founded by colonists from Naxos as Leontini in 729 BC, which in its beginnings was a Chalcidian colony established five years earlier. It is virtually the only Greek settlement in Sicily that is not located on the coast, founded around 6 miles inland. The site, originally held by the Sicels, was seized by the Greeks owing to their command on the fertile plain in the north. The city was reduced to subject status in 494 BC by Hippocrates of Gela, who made his ally Aenesidemus its tyrant. In 476 BC, Hieron of Syracuse moved the inhabitants from Catana and Naxos to Leontini. Later on, the city of Leontini regained its independence. However, as a part of the inhabitants efforts to retain their independence, they invoked more than once the interventions of Athens. It was mainly the eloquence of Gorgias of Leontini which led to the abortive Athenian expedition of 427 BC. In 422 BC, the Greek city-state of Syracuse supported the oligarchs against the people and received them as citizens, Leontini itself being forsaken. This led to a renewed Athenian intervention. Initially as a diplomatic one, the exiles of Leontini joined the envoys of Segesta in persuading Athens to undertake the great Sicilian Expedition of 415 BC. After the failure of the Expedition, Leontini became subject to Syracuse once more. The city's independence was guaranteed by the treaty of 405 BC between Dionysius and the Carthaginians, but it was soon lost again. The city was finally stormed by Marcus Claudius Marcellus in 214 BC. In Roman times it seems to have been of small importance. It was destroyed by the Saracens in 847 AD, and almost completely ruined by the earthquake of 1693. Until the middle of the 20th century, Lentini was regarded by travellers as a malarial stopover to Syracuse of minor historical importance. The ancient city is described by Polybius as lying in a valley between two hills, and facing north. On the western side of this valley there was a river flowing with a row of houses on its western bank below the hill. At each end was a gate, the northern gate leading to the plain, the southern, at the upper end, leading to Syracuse. On each side of the valley there was an acropolis, lying between precipitous hills with flat tops, over which buildings extended. The eastern hill still has the remains of a strongly fortified medieval castle, in which some writers are inclined (though wrongly) to recognize portions of the Greek masonry. Excavations were made in 1899 in one of the ravines in a Sicel necropolis of the third period; explorations in the various Greek cemeteries resulted in the discovery of some fine bronzes, notably a lebes. Main sights Lentini's sights include: *The Baroque Chiesa madre Santa Maria la Cava e Sant'Alfio (\\"Mother Church of St. Mary of the Pit and St. Alphius\\"), built from 1693 by Vincenzo Vella da Malta. It has a basilica plan with three naves; the three-order facade is from the 18th century. The central portal has scenes of the martyrdom of Saints Alphius, Philadelphus and Cyrinus. The interior holds a Byzantine icon from the 12th century. *The Chiesa of Santissima Trinit√† e San Marziano (\\"Church of the Holy Trinity and St. Marcian\\"), which was built over the ruins of the 16th century Palazzo La Palumba. It has a noteworthy pavement in ceramics of Caltagirone (18th century) and a polyptych of Antonello da Messina's school. The high altar tabernacle is made of lapis lazuli. *The Chiesa dell'Immacolata (\\"Church of the Immaculate\\") from the 17th century. Inside there are a Romanesque lion sculpture, a Christ at the Column and the tombstone of Queen Mary (1402). *The Chiesa di S.Luca (\\"Church of St. Luke\\"). It has a notable painting of Saint Francis of Assisi, speaking by Jacopo Bassano and other artworks. Next to the church are the remains of the Castle of Frederick II, the hypogeum of St. Lucy with 14th-century frescoes, the Crucifix Grottoes with frescoes from the 12th‚Äì17th centuries and the ruins of the old parish church of St. Peter (16th century). *The 18th-century church of San Francesco di Paola, with a rare organ and artworks from churches which were destroyed by the 1693 earthquake. *The Lago di Lentini or Biviere, which extends not far away from the city, once drained but rebuilt in the 1970s in the old location. The lake is rich in vegetation and fauna. Economy Lentini's economy is mainly based on agriculture and, to a lesser extent, on woodcraft and handicraft production. The city is also known for the production of the blood orange, specifically the types tarocco, moro, and sanguinella. Climate Lentini's climate is Mediterranean, with mild winters and hot summers. During the coldest months, the average temperature during the day is around 15 ¬∞C, while the warmest months see average daytime temperatures that reach 34 ¬∞C. In summer, temperatures reach 40 ¬∞C every year and temperatures over 45 ¬∞C are not unheard of. Winter also encounters temperatures over 15 ¬∞C yearly, with temperatures over 20 ¬∞C also occurring, but less frequently. Occasionally, winter lows go down to 0 ¬∞C, but rarely go under 0 ¬∞C. Summer lows normally do not go under 17 ¬∞C but can occasionally go down to 15 ¬∞C. While the climate is relatively dry all year round, there is a marked difference between precipitation days in summer, that experiences rain very rarely, and in winter, where rain occurs more frequently.

The wars were caused by Iranian tribes migrating into Central Asia and the inability of the Seleucids to properly defend or hold together their vast empire.  Background  In 323 BC, the Seleucid Empire was founded by Seleucus I Nicator, a general of Alexander the Great. Stretching from Syria to the Indus River and comprising most of Alexander's realm, the Seleucid state was the most powerful of the Diadochi kingdoms that sprang up after Alexander's death. Quickly however, the Seleucids ran into trouble trying to maintain such an extended realm, facing constant warfare against the other Hellenistic states in the west and with unrest amongst their Iranian peoples in the east. Taking advantage of the Seleucids' preoccupation with the wars against a Celtic invasion of Asia Minor in the west, and the chaos of the Third Syrian War around 245 BC, Diodotus and Andragoras, the Seleucid satraps of Bactria and Parthia respectively, declared their remote provinces independent states. However, in around 238, the Parni, an Iranian tribe from the central Asian steppes under Arsaces, invaded Andragoras' domain, defeated and killed him, and took over the land. The Parni then became known as the Parthians taking their name from the Seleucid province that they had conquered. They then began to try and conquer as much of the eastern Seleucid empire as possible, taking the city of Hekatompylos, by 238, which became their capital. They were joined in this by the now independent province of Bactria. The Seleucid king Seleucus II was at the time too busy fighting a war against Ptolemaic Egypt and so the Seleucids lost most of their territory east of Persia and Media.  Campaigns of Seleucus II Callinicus  After the death of his father, Antiochus II, in 246 BC, Seleucus II succeeded him as ruler, but was unable to respond to the Parthian raids in the Eastern portion of the empire due to war with Ptolemaic Egypt and, subsequently, his younger brother, Hierax, who attempted to establish himself as the independent ruler of Asia Minor. Eventually, the two brothers reached a truce and Seleucus was able to begin an expedition against the Parthians. Despite achieving initial success, expelling the Parthians from Parthia and Hyrcania, Seleucus II was likely defeated and possibly captured by the Parthians, who were possibly aided by Diodotus II, the ruler of Bactria. After his release, Seleucus returned to Asia Minor to once again deal with Hierax, who had resumed hostilities against his brother.  Campaigns of Antiochus III  Antiochus III was an ambitious Seleucid king who had a vision of reuniting Alexander the Great's empire under the Seleucid dynasty. In 209 BC, he launched a campaign to regain control of the eastern provinces, and after defeating the Parthians in battle, he successfully regained control over the region. The Parthians were forced to accept vassal status and now only controlled the land conforming to the former Seleucid province of Parthia. However, Parthia's vassalage was only nominal at best and only because the Seleucid army was on their doorstep. For his retaking of the eastern provinces and establishing the Seleucid borders as far east as they had been under Seleucus I Nicator, Antiochus was awarded the title great by his nobles. Luckily for the Parthians, the Seleucid Empire had many enemies, and it was not long before Antiochus led his forces west to fight Ptolemaic Egypt and the rising Roman Republic.  Rise of the Arsacids and the end of the Seleucid Empire  Seleucid power began to weaken after the defeat of Antiochus III at the hands of the Romans at the Battle of Magnesia which effectively broke Seleucid power and in particular the Seleucid army. After this defeat, Antiochus began an expedition into Iran, but was killed in Elyma√Øs. The Arsacids then took power in Parthia and declared their full independence from the Seleucid Empire. In 148 BC, the Parthian king Mithridates I invaded Media which was already in revolt against the Seleucid empire, and in 141 BC the Parthians captured the major Seleucid city of Seleucia (which was the eastern capital of the Seleucid empire). These victories gave Mithridates control over Mesopotamia and Babylonia. In 139 BC the Parthians defeated a major Seleucid counterattack, breaking the Seleucid army, and captured the Seleucid King, Demetrius II, thus effectively ending Seleucid claims to any land east of the Euphrates river. In order to recover this territory, Antiochus VII Sidetes, launched a counter offensive against the Parthians in 130 BC, initially defeating them twice in battle. The Parthians sent a delegation to negotiate a peace agreement, but ultimately rejected the terms proposed by Antiochus. The Seleucid army was then dispersed into winter quarters. Seeing an opportunity to strike, the Parthians, under Phraates II, defeated and killed Antiochus at the Battle of Ecbatana in 129 BC, and proceeded to destroy and capture the rest of his massive army, thus ending the Seleucids' attempt to retake Persia. The loss of so much territory sent the already enfeebled empire into a decline from which it could never recover. The Seleucid Empire became a rump state which consisted of little more than Antioch and the surrounding lands. The only reason the Seleucid Empire continued to exist is because the Parthians saw it as a useful buffer against the Roman Empire. When Pompey led a Roman expedition into Syria, he annexed the Seleucid Empire, and the stage was set for the Roman‚ÄìParthian Wars.  Legacy  The westward expansion of Parthia during the war would eventually lead to clashes with the Roman Empire. The Roman‚ÄìParthian Wars would embroil these ancient empires until the 3rd century.

Biography Fiksman was born in the Bessarabian town of Orgeev in the Russian Empire (now Orhei, Moldova), the eldest son of the grocer Meer Fiksman and his wife Haya. His early years were spent in Chisinau, where his parents had moved by early 1903. There he studied in a cheder and a state school for Jews. At fourteen he began publishing poetry in local periodicals, and in 1918 he edited the magazine Molodaya mysl' [Young thought], taking the pen name Dovid Knut, perhaps from the word knut, meaning 'whip, lash', used in both Russian and Yiddish as a symbol of oppression and slavery.Maxim Shrayer, An Anthology of Jewish-Russian Literature: 1801‚Äì1953 (M.E. Sharpe, 2007: ), p. 446. In 1920, when Bessarabia became part of Romania, the family moved to Paris, where Dovid had factory and other jobs during the day and studied French at the night school of the Alliance fran√ßaise, opened his own eatery in the Latin Quarter, studied in the Department of Chemistry of the University of Caen in Normandy, and worked as an engineer. He also took part in the cultural life of emigre Paris, helping to organize the \\"Exhibition of Thirteen\\" in July 1922, joining the Union of Young Poets and Writers, and coediting the magazine Novy dom [New home]. He contributed poems to many √©migr√© publications, and his first collection, Moikh tysyachiletii [My millennia], appeared in 1925 and was \\"well received for its Biblical intonation and verbal vibrancy\\"; his second, published in 1928, was reviewed sympathetically by Vladimir Nabokov, who praised its \\"energetic verses\\" but complained about lapses of taste.Shrayer, Anthology of Jewish- Russian Literature, pp. 446‚Äì47. In the early 1930s, Knut separated from his first wife, Sarra Groboys, the mother of his son Daniel, and became close to Ariadna (Ariane) Scriabine (1906‚Äì1944, known as \\"R√©gine\\" in the Resistance), the daughter of the Russian composer Alexander Scriabin. At the same time he was becoming increasingly involved with Jewish activism, and he and Ariadna visited Palestine from August to December 1937; while he was there, Haaretz published one of his poems in Hebrew translation.Shrayer, Anthology of Jewish- Russian Literature, p. 447. He edited the Jewish newspaper L'Affirmation from January 1938 to September 1939, attacking writers and intellectuals who showed sympathy for anti-Semitism. In September 1939 he was mobilized into the French army. Ariadna had become passionately devoted to the Jewish cause; they were married in March 1940 and she converted to Judaism at that time.Ne les oublions pas: SCRIABINE √©pouse FIKSMAN Ariane . The next month they moved to Toulouse, where along with others they established a secret organization called La main forte [The strong hand], which became the Arm√©e juive (AJ or Jewish Army), a World War II resistance movement. In December 1942, pursued by the Gestapo, Knut escaped to Switzerland; Ariadna gave birth to his son Yosi in May 1943. She was ambushed and killed by members of the French Militia while holding an AJ meeting at her flat in Toulouse in July 1944, two weeks before the city was liberated. Knut returned to Paris in the fall of 1944, working at the Centre de documentation juive contemporaine. In 1946 he became editor of the magazine Le Monde juif [Jewish world], and the next year he married actress Virginia Sharovskaya (who became Leah Fiksman). In 1949 he published a substantial volume of selected poems; that same year he and his family left France and moved to Israel. He lived in Tel Aviv and taught Hebrew at an ulpan in Kiryat Motzkin. He died in 1955 from cancer of the brain. Temira Pachmuss summed up his work in this way: > The originality of Knut's poetic talent, his personal intonation, and his > fresh, unusual conceptions are obvious. He was very successful with ternary > meters which he employed in slow, sorrowful, or exultant poetic meditations > on the fate of the Jewish people. These poems were treasured by a devoted > circle of sophisticated readers in Paris. Some of Knut's poetry is dedicated > to the Jewish-Russian town of Kishinev[...] Several of Dovid Knut's > descriptions‚Äîof the Jewish funeral service, for example‚Äîare especially vivid > and haunting. [...] His lyrics are, in general, very energetic, emotional, > even passionate, loud, and even solemn.[...] > > Biblical themes, eroticism with biblical overtones, and vigorous diction > are also salient traits of Knut's poetics. The pathos and verbal > intoxication of his early poetry led to several serious artistic > deficiencies[...] But his later works are humane, simple, sincere, and > restrained. Paris Nights is the best of Knut's collections of verse. Here > the cumbrous imagery and \\"excessive noise and crash\\"[...] are absent.

Fl. Great Plains i‚Äìvii, 1‚Äì1392. University Press of Kansas, Lawrence Its leaf shape is the origin of its name, which is Latin for maple-leaf grape, but it is widely referenced in literature by the synonym, Vitis longii. Vitis acerifolia is second in cold-hardiness among grapes only to Vitis riparia. Unlike other cold hardy grapes, it will grow long into fall if weather is clement, but can harden off remarkably fast in a cold snap. This makes it ideally suited for North American winter weather which often include sudden fluctuations in temperature, and is superior in this regard to its rival for second place in cold hardiness among grapes, Vitis amurensis, which is notorious for coming out of hibernation during a warm spell only to be damaged by a sudden frost. Aside from cold hardiness, Vitis acerifolia provides many potential benefits for the breeding of hybrid grapes. It strongly resists drought, is resistant to phylloxera, is easy to root, has seeds that germinate all at once and it has good to excellent general resistance to other common grape diseases. While berries and clusters are generally small and seedy, it lacks the 'off flavors' of many other North American Vitis species, having neither the harsh labrusca aftertaste nor the characteristic herbaceous flavor of Vitis riparia, nor the blackcurrant-like flavor common to post oak grapes or the harsh peppery taste of many other native Texas grapes. Low acidity and very early ripening are also important characteristics for potential grape breeders. It also yields strongly colored juice, lending its parentage to the Canadian variety 'Vincent' and similar varieties, which have concentrations of up to a dozen times more coloring than vinifera varieties used for the same purpose. Since red wines are fermented on the skins and this is the source of 'off' flavors in hybrid wines, it is notoriously difficult to produce cold hardy, quality red wine grape varieties. There are even fewer capable of adding strong coloration to weaker-colored juice varieties. Acerifolia hybrids show much promise in this area. Although it has no inherent resistance to Pierce's disease, an important and deadly disease of grapes in the southern parts of the United States and Central America, it seldom suffers from this disease due to being almost totally unpalatable to the common insect vector of the disease, the glassy-winged sharpshooter (Homalodisca vitripennis). This is apparently due to the pubescence of the leaves repelling the insect.

The not-so-good Mayor Franklyn adopts Lois as his personal assistant when she bursts into his office one day and strongly advises him to cut the pressure to shut down porn shops or he will lose the vote of New York's youth.

After reviewing the status of the ONUMOZ mission, the importance of the General Peace Agreement and its timely implementation by all parties was reiterated. Positive developments were welcomed though there were still some delays. A request by the Government of Mozambique and RENAMO was noted regarding observation of police activities and in this regard, the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros- Ghali recommended the establishment of a police component of ONUMOZ with a view to reducing the military component. A police component of up to 1,144 personnel was established. The Secretary-General was requested to prepare for the withdrawal of part of the military component and to draw plans for the completion of the ONUMOZ mandate by November 1994, when an elected government is in office. Timetables were also to be drawn for the withdrawal of military observers after demilitarisation had taken place and for the drawdown of military forces in the transportation corridors when the new national defence force was operational. Recent positive developments including the commencement of the assembly of troops, dismantling of paramilitary militias, the electoral law and the appointment of the National Electoral Commission, were welcomed. At the same time there was concern at delays including the demobilisation and the formation of a national army. The two parties were called on to implement the peace agreement, and in particular the ceasefire and demobilisation and cantonment of forces. They were also asked to prepare for elections no later than October 1994. The international community was asked to help contribute to the demobilisation of troops and the training of the new defense army in Mozambique. It was also important to ensure the return of refugees and displaced persons. The Secretary-General was requested to ensure maximum economy in the operations of ONUMOZ, with the Council awaiting his next report on progress and the timetable by which ONUMOZ's mandate will be reviewed.

Phillips thus combines two of the common strategies used in song translation.Translating poetic songs: An attempt at a functional account of strategies, Low P, Target, Volume 15, Number 1, 2003 , pp. 91-110(20), Publisher: John Benjamins Publishing Company First published in 1979 and updated in 1996, it is considered indispensable by many Anglophone students of lieder. It is cited in the bibliography of the Harvard Dictionary of Music article on the lied form, and it is a frequently cited source of English translations of the popular German lieder and has been endorsed by such authorities as Dame Janet Baker.

Dooley (Tim Conway) tries to romance Nicki Dixon (Stella Stevens) to get the money, but he finds out she's a lunatic who tries to kill him when he reminds her of her ex. Later, they borrow an envelope of money from the mob, who expect them to pay back within a week.

It was the first naval battle of the Hundred Years' War and the first recorded European naval battle using artillery, as the English ship Christopher had three cannons and one hand gun. The battle featured a vast French fleet under admirals Hugues Qui√©ret and Nicolas B√©huchet against a small squadron of five great English cogs transporting an enormous cargo of wool to Antwerp, where Edward III of England was hoping to sell it, in order to be able to pay subsidies to his allies. It occurred near Arnemuiden, the port of the island of Walcheren (now in the Netherlands, but then part of the County of Flanders, formally part of the Kingdom of France). Overwhelmed by the superior numbers and with some of their crew still on shore, the English ships fought bravely, especially the Christopher under the command of John Kingston, who was also commander of the squadron. Kingston surrendered after a day's fighting and exhausting every means of defence. The French captured the rich cargo, took the five cogs into their fleet and massacred the English prisoners.

It stars Michael Madsen as a psychopath who takes the occupants of a remote diner hostage, only to realize that one of them is more dangerous than the gunman. Amber Benson stars as Noreen, a waitress at the Diner.  Plot  Several people are gathered at a diner‚ÄîNoreen, a friendly and talkative waitress; Lonnie, a dim-witted cop; Jimmy, the short-tempered owner; Billy and Starr, a young couple on their way to elope; John, a meek salesman on his way to New York City; and Hank, a quiet regular. A radio is playing, and the group hears of an entire family murdered gruesomely in a neighboring county. Noreen, shocked, becomes increasingly agitated and nervous after an aggressive man in a black leather jacket enters. Noreen covertly asks Lonnie to investigate the newcomer, but Lonnie brushes aside her concerns. After Noreen spills the man's coffee, Hank urges Lonnie to do something. When Lonnie questions him, the man becomes antagonistic and belittles Lonnie, who pulls his gun on the man. Lonnie sheepishly apologizes when Hank reports the man's vehicle does not match the police reports. As the patrons relax, the man leaves the diner, only to return with a shotgun and pistol. After he kills Lonnie and Jimmy, he takes the rest of the diner hostage. He orders Noreen to collect all the wallets and cell phones, and he forces Hank to dispose of the corpses. The gunman catches Noreen trying to sneak a cell phone, and threatens to kill her if she does it again. Hank quietly proposes that they rush the gunman, as he has used up several rounds already, but Noreen and John refuse. The lovers, frightened, huddle at another table. A new customer enters the diner, introduces himself as Mr. Greene, and seems minimally surprised by the situation. He hands the gunman a suitcase full of money and addresses him as \\"Smith\\". When Greene attempts to leave, the gunman takes him hostage and demands answers. After being severely beaten, Greene eventually reveals that he is a corrupt land developer who hired a professional hit man to kill the neighboring family when they refused to sell their land to build a shopping mall. With no heirs to the family's life insurance policy, Greene would buy the land from the bank. Disgusted, the gunman kills Greene for not giving enough information and reasons that one of the people in the diner must be the hit man. Noreen begs him to let them go, but the gunman says that he intends to see the situation through. He also tells her he uses extreme methods to extract information from certain people. The gunman immediately discounts Noreen and the young couple. He first interrogates Hank, who, after being shot in the leg, reveals that he is an ex-soldier who is cheating on his wife. After being shot, he admits that he has sex with women and men at truck stops, gas stations, and bathrooms. Satisfied that Hank has held nothing back, the gunman kills him. He then handcuffs and interrogates John, who quickly gives up his pretense of being a salesman. John matter-of-factly recounts killing the family but rejects comparisons between himself and the gunman, whom he calls insane, and that John tells the gunman he was at the wrong place at the wrong time when Lonnie started harassing him for information. The gunman threatens to torture John, but John coolly laughs it off as pointless, as he will not reveal any details about his employers except that they are powerful and well-connected. John turns around his interrogation, and the gunman reveals that he is also ex-military, forced out because of mental instability and jailed for two years. With the situation now reversed, the gunman unsuccessfully attempts to bargain with John. Convinced that whatever he does will result in him being marked for death by the organization, and knowing he will never stop running or hiding, the gunman panics and kills the young couple. As the gunman prepares to kill John, Noreen lunges at him with a knife and slashes his throat. John gratefully asks her to free him, but when she hesitates, he again drops his friendly demeanor and tries to cruelly bully her into surrendering. Noreen admits that she has trouble standing up for herself and that she is afraid of change but surprises him by instead shooting him with the last round in the pistol. Rather than call the police, she plays music on the Jukebox, takes the money and walks out of the diner.

The Sacred Band of Stepsons series of fantasy novels and stories take place in a myth-like milieu that mixes historical places such as Nisibis, Mygdonia and Chaeronea; warriors such as Theagenes (commander of the Theban Sacred Band at Chaeronea); gods such as Enlil, Maat and Harmonia; philosophers such as Heraclitus and Thales; cavalry tactics and customs such as homosexuality in the militaries of ancient Greece with those that exist only in fantasy. The exploits of the Stepsons are chronicled in eleven short stories and nine novels (as of 2012). In a fantasy context, this series explores the difficulties facing war-fighters in personal relationships and the enduring questions surrounding the military's historical mixing of homosexuals and heterosexuals in combat.  Evolution of the fictional Sacred Band of Stepsons  The Sacred Band of Stepsons first appeared as shock troops in the Thieves' World series in 1981 with the story, \\"A Man and His God,\\" a historical fantasy novella based on the Sacred Band of Thebes, an elite Theban homosexual war-band (Hier√≤s L√≥khos) during the 4th century B.C. Because Thieves' World was a \\"shared universe\\" where many writers could use the same characters, others wrote stories featuring the Stepsons and their immortal commander, Tempus. Notable authors who wrote stories featuring characters from the Sacred Band of Stepsons include Chris Morris, Robert Asprin, Lynn Abbey, Andrew Offutt, and C. J. Cherryh. For nearly a decade, Janet Morris wrote stories and novels, some with Chris Morris, about Tempus and his Sacred Band. Morris's first Sacred Band of Stepsons novel, Beyond Sanctuary, was the first \\"authorized\\" Thieves' World spin-off novel and was published in hardcover by Baen Books and then the Science Fiction Book Club. Beyond Sanctuary was reviewed by Library Journal and by Publishers Weekly. Next came \\"Beyond the Veil,\\" also a Baen hardcover and Science Fiction Book Club Selection. Beyond the Veil was reviewed by Kirkus Reviews and by Fantasy Review. The Baen hardcover and Science Fiction Book Club publication of Beyond Wizardwall completed publication of the trilogy. Three additional Stepsons novels and a short story per year followed until 1990, when the Morrises ceased production until 2010. In the latest Stepsons novels, The Sacred Band (2010), The Fish the Fighters and the Song-girl (2012), the Stepsons rescue twenty-three couples of the historical Sacred Band of Thebes at the Battle of Chaeronea and bring them, with their Greek Fates and gods, to Sanctuary and out again. The Sacred Band and eight other related novels were reviewed by Black Gate.  History, myth, and philosophy meet fantasy  Classical correspondences abound, as analyzed in detail by Edgeworth. The Band's commander, Tempus, rides a Tros horse, akin to the Iliad's man-devouring white horses from Troy. Tempus's leopard-skin mantle and boar's-tooth helmet, his choice of panoply and mount and food and drink, and many other allusions and references hark back to Homer's Iliad. Edgeworth discusses Tempus's choices in detail: The web of connectivity to classical sources in this series is extensive. As Edgeworth explores at length, the authors mix historicity, philosophy and myth. Tempus quotes the philosophers Heraclitus and Thales and some other characters call him 'Tempus Thales.' The milieus in which the Stepsons find themselves sometimes resemble but seldom duplicate our own. Paired Sacred Banders such as Critias and Straton have historical counterparts in ancient Greece; the witch who stalks Nikodemos through many novels and stories is called Roxane, who shares that name with the wife of Alexander the Great of Macedon. Many other parallels exist, along with a wealth of detail evoking our classical world. And yet, as Edgeworth points out, knowledge of the ancient world and its history is not necessary to understand the stories, which can be read purely as fantasy.  Composition  The Sacred Band of Stepsons is a multinational force, and eventually includes twenty-three couples from the Sacred Band of Thebes who fought at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC. Like the historic Sacred Band of Thebes (378-338 BC), the Stepsons serve as an elite strike force. Unlike today's prevailing vision of the Theban Sacred Band, the Stepsons mix pairs and individual war-fighters in a single unit. Both Sacred Bands adhere to the ancient military model of the Sacred Bands, special units who prize honor above all and die in battle rather than desert their partners, lovers or beloveds.  Constitution of the Stepsons  The Sacred Band of Stepsons was developed by their fictional commander, Tempus, from an original ten pairs of lovers and friends, plus thirty single mercenaries. These original pairs of Stepsons followed the social model of the Sacred Band of Thebes, and so did other pairs recruited subsequently. Edgeworth says of Tempus's Sacred Band: In Tempus's Band, heterosexual Stepsons and Sacred Band pairs fight side by side. There is no requirement to be part of a couple to serve among the Stepsons, and single mercenaries initially outnumbered the Sacred Band pairs. The Stepsons are principally a cavalry (hippeis) squadron, not heavy infantry (hoplites) as the Theban Sacred Banders primarily were. While the three-hundred-strong Theban Sacred Band was constituted by Theban law-givers and maintained by the Theban state (according to Plutarch's \\"Life\\" of Pelopidas), the Sacred Band of Stepsons is loyal only to its members and its commander, Tempus. Among the Stepsons, fathers and sons and Platonic couples, as well as single male and female fighters, can serve. In this mixed company, couples and individual cavalry and infantry fighters are recruited as circumstances required. To this end, the Stepsons rescued twenty-three pairs from the doomed Theban Sacred Band at the Battle of Chaeronea and integrated the survivors into their force. At full strength, the Stepsons number as many as three hundred and sixty fighters and have fought in three major campaigns.  Reception  Library Journal's Jackie Cassada said in her 1985 review of Beyond Sanctuary: \\"The first novel to emerge from the Thieves' World stories features one of the notorious city of Sanctuary's most complex and problematical residents: Tempus, a warrior who cannot die and cannot enjoy his immortality. Sworn to defend the Rankan Empire from its northern enemies, Tempus leads a band of mercenaries, wizards, and an extraordinary woman against the mages of Wizardwall. While showing a fine flair for the sword-and-sorcery genre, Morris succeeds as well in making her more-than-human characters more than entertaining.\\" Kirkus Reviews said of Beyond the Veil: \\"sword and sorcery reign supreme...main thrust here concerns the effort of immortal, sleepless, accursed Tempus, the junior wizard Randal, the knightly Critias to counter the evil conspiracies of the spirited witch Roxane -- a power struggle complicated by an assortment of slaves, walking undead, rogues, slavering beasties, aloof wizards, pregnant warriors, vile devils, demonic avatars, and meddlesome gods...absorbing and enjoyable fantasy.\\" Black Gate said of The Sacred Band: \\"This is not sword and sorcery, this is not elves and dwarves and high-concept fantasy‚Ä¶ The Sacred Band has the sharp edge of reality, the harshness, the bitterness and the danger of the real world. Love, loyalty, honor ‚Äî these are the ideals by which these characters live and die. This novel is epic in scope. It is mythic by heritage. It is positively Homeric.\\" Robert W. Cape, Jr., in Classical Traditions in Science Fiction wrote of Tempus (1987; 2011), Tempus Unbound (1989; 2017) and The Sacred Band (2010) \\"A fantasy series about the Sacred Band of Stepsons, an elite army modeled on the fourth-century B.C.E. Sacred Band of Thebes. The stories explore the fraught personal relationships of mixed hetero- and homosexual troops, only sometimes paired, as they fight for their commander, the immortal Tempus. Morris includes archaeological and historical details, from physical items to social practices, religion, and philosophy, to create a fantasy world that is, in many ways, more historically accurate than many popular accounts of antiquity.\\"  Novels  * Beyond Sanctuary, (1985) * Beyond the Veil, (1985) * Beyond Wizardwall, (1986) * Tempus, (1987) * City at the Edge of Time, (1988) (with Chris Morris) * Tempus Unbound (1989), (with Chris Morris) * Storm Seed (1990), (with Chris Morris) * The Sacred Band (2010), (with Chris Morris) * The Fish the Fighters and the Song-Girl (2012), (with Chris Morris)  Short stories  * ‚ÄúVashanka‚Äôs Minion,‚Äù Tales from the Vulgar Unicorn (1980), Asprin, ed. * ‚ÄúA Man and His God,‚Äù Shadows of Sanctuary (1981), Asprin, ed. * ‚ÄúWizard Weather,‚Äù Storm Season (1982), Asprin, ed. * ‚ÄúAn End to Dreaming,‚Äù Whispers #5 (1982), Schiff, ed. * ‚ÄúHigh Moon,‚Äù Face of Chaos, (1983), Asprin and Abbey, ed. * ‚ÄúWhat Women Do Best,‚Äù Wings of Omen (1984) (with Chris Morris), Asprin and Abbey, ed. * ‚ÄúHell to Pay,‚Äù The Dead of Winter (1985) Asprin and Abbey, ed. * ‚ÄúPower Play,‚Äù Soul of the City (1986) (with Lynn Abbey and C.

Obenchain wrote the book under the pen name Eliza Calvert Hall, a pseudonym that she frequently used when writing her fictional works. Set in rural western Kentucky in the late nineteenth century, the book recounts an elderly quilt-maker Aunt Jane's memories of life in the rural south as told to an unnamed younger woman visitor. The collection under the title Aunt Jane of Kentucky was first published together in 1907. The book appeared in at least thirty-three editions and reached approximately one million readers.Available free as an e-book for download at Project Gutenburg. The most famous reader was perhaps United States President Theodore Roosevelt who suggested reading the book to listeners during a 1908 speech: \\"I cordially recommend the first chapter of Aunt Jane of Kentucky as a tract in all families where the menfolk tend to selfish or thoughtless or overbearing disregard to the rights of their womenfolk.\\" Beulah Strong, an artist trained in Paris and teaching at Potter College in Bowling Green, Kentucky, used the description of Aunt Jane at the beginning of the story, \\"Sally Ann's Experience,\\" as her model for the book's frontispiece. Strong created fourteen more pen and ink illustrations to open nine of the stories and to serve as tail-pieces at the end of five stories. Stories *I. Sally Ann's Experience *II. The New Organ *III.

The popularity of the story resulted in it being reprinted in Cosmopolitan multiple times, and printed in various other popular newspapers and magazines around the world. After its inclusion in Aunt Jane of Kentucky (Boston: Little, Brown, and Company, 1907) the demand for the story remained high, so Little, Brown, and Company republished it in 1910. In an Introduction to the 1910 republication of the story, Obenchain describes it as \\"a plain tale of plain people told in the plain dialect of a plain old woman.\\". In 1995 Aunt Jane of Kentucky was reprinted by the University Press of Kentucky as a paperback with a new foreword by Bonnie Jean Cox, University of Kentucky Libraries.

The church is located near Batalha Square. Completed in 1739, the church was built in a proto-Baroque style and features a retable by the Italian artist Nicolau Nasoni and a fa√ßade of 1932 azulejo tilework. The church is named in honour of the Visigoth, Ildephonsus of Toledo, bishop of Toledo from 657 until his death in 667.  History  Prior to the building of the church of Saint Ildefonso, a chapel, known as Santo Alifon, stood on the site. Its construction date is unknown, but several early texts mention its existence. The earliest known reference to the site and the original chapel is in a work by a bishop of Porto, Vicente Mendes, dated 1296. The aged chapel, in danger of collapsing, was demolished in 1709 and construction began on the new church that year. The building took thirty years to complete, finally inaugurated and blessed on 18 July 1739. The first stage of construction was completed in 1730, when the main body was finished and the tympanum, bearing the date M DCC XXX (1730), was placed. The second construction phase, from 1730 to 1739, saw the erection of the two bell towers, and the fa√ßade and narthex were finalised. The architect of the Igreja de Santo Ildefonso is unknown, although records exist giving the names of the carpenters, masons, and locksmith who worked on the building. Extensively repaired following a severe storm in 1819, the church also suffered damage from artillery fire on 21 July 1833 during the Siege of Porto. Over the years the church has undergone structural modifications and improvements, including the replacement of stained glass windows in 1967. The new ones were created by the artist Isolino Vaz. During 1996 renovation works to the narthex, an area that corresponds to the original chapel's churchyard, nineteen graves were discovered. Features and usage Constructed of granite, the shape of the church's main body is that of an elongated octagon, with decorative plaster ceilings. The fa√ßade, also granite, is regular and mostly plain, with two bell towers and a rectangular recess where a figure of the patron saint of the church stands. The bell towers include decorative cornices and dentils. Each tower is topped with masonry spheres, a stone cross, and a metalwork flag. A monolithic obelisk stands to the left of the church, although it initially was erected on a set of steps extending toward Rua de 31 de Janeiro. Originally positioned to align with the bell tower of nearby Cl√©rigos Church, it was moved to its present location when the steps were altered in 1924 to accommodate shops. Two notable features of the church are the retable and the blue-and-white tiling. The artist and architect Nicolau Nasoni designed the retable, which was created and installed by architect Miguel Francisco da Silva in 1745. Approximately 11,000 azulejo tiles cover the fa√ßade of the church, which were created by artist Jorge Cola√ßo and placed in November 1932. The tiles depict scenes from the life of Saint Ildefonso and figurative imagery from the Gospels. The church sits near Porto's Batalha Square, a historic, mostly pedestrian, public space that is frequented by tourists. The church receives many visitors each year, and mass is held there daily.

In 2015, the restored version of the film was presented at the 26th Singapore International Film Festival as Bugis Street Redux. Synopsis Sixteen-year-old Lien, portrayed by Vietnamese actress Hiep Thi Le, is the main protagonist. Despite having worked for a time as a servant in a household whose \\"young master\\" adored her in her hometown of Malacca in West Malaysia, the young girl comes across as having led a surprisingly sheltered life. She journeys to Singapore to seek employment as a maid in the Sin Sin Hotel along Bugis Street. She seems thoroughly content for a time to possess a na√Øve, romanticised view of the rambunctious goings-on at the hotel where she witnesses \\"the sad departure of an American gentleman\\" from the home-cum-workplace of \\"his Chinese girl\\". The guest is actually a presently-sober but angry American sailor who has belatedly discovered that the Singaporean Chinese prostitute he picked up in Bugis Street and spent a drunken night with happens to be a trans woman. Before long, the new employee Lien finds out that many of the long-term lodgers of the budget establishment, whose room rental rate is S$3, whether it be for an hour or the entire day and night, are trans women. Although her first reaction to seeing someone with breasts and a penis is one of revulsion which causes her to contemplate fleeing the neighbourhood, she instead listens to and heeds the cajoling and advice of Lola, the trans hotel resident who has treated her well from the start of her stint. She comes to accept the unique, complex personalities of the unorthodox community, who in turn also begin to accept her. As she learns to look beyond the surface, she is rewarded with the generous friendship of the cosmopolitan and sophisticated Drago, who has returned from Paris to minister to his/her dying but loving and tolerant mother. While Lien learns the ways of the world via her encounters with Meng, the slimy, often underdressed boyfriend of Lola, as well as night-time escapades on the town with the Sin Sin Hotel's other denizens, she begins to see beauty in unlikely places and to grow despite the presence of ugliness in an imperfect world.

It is most commonly considered to be a clade of non-dinosaur dinosauriforms, and the sister group of dinosaurs. Some studies have instead suggested that most or all silesaurids comprised a paraphyletic grade of early dinosaurs ancestral to traditional ornithischians. Silesaurids have a consistent general body plan, with a fairly long neck and legs and possibly quadrupedal habits. However, they occupied a variety of ecological niches, with early silesaurids (such as Lewisuchus) being carnivorous and later taxa (such as Kwanasaurus) having adaptations for specialized herbivory. As indicated by the contents of referred coprolites, Silesaurus may have been insectivorous, feeding selectively on small beetles and other arthropods. Classification Silesauridae is typically considered the sister group to Dinosauria. The group was named in 2010 by Max C. Langer et al. They defined it as a branch-based clade of all archosaurs closer to Silesaurus opolensis than to either Heterodontosaurus tucki or Marasuchus lilloensis. At around the same time, Sterling J. Nesbitt et al. (2010) independently named Silesauridae as a node- based clade consisting of Lewisuchus, Silesaurus, their last common ancestor and all their descendants. Currently, both definitions encompass the same group of animals. Nesbitt et al. noted that the earlier definition by Langer et al. did not include a diagnosis, and so was not sufficient to create a ranked family-level name according to the ICZN. Therefore, the family Silesauridae is attributed to Nesbitt et al. (2010) while the clade Silesauridae is attributed to Langer et al. (2010). The fossils range in age from the Anisian to the Norian stages of the Triassic, about 245 to 203 million years ago. The cladogram below follows the phylogenetic analysis of basal ornithodirans conducted by Christian Kammerer, Sterling Nesbitt and Neil Shubin (2012) with clade terminology from Cau (2018) and Martz and Small (2019). A large phylogenetic analysis of early dinosaurs and dinosauromorphs carried out by Matthew Baron, David Norman and Paul Barrett (2017) and published in the journal Nature recovered Silesauridae as a monophyletic sister group to Dinosauria. The study also recovered the taxon Agnosphitys within the clade Silesauridae, close to Lewisuchus and its synonymous taxon Pseudolagosuchus.
