It was approved by 61.2% of voters. Election officials announced on May 5 that the proposition had collected sufficient signatures to qualify for the ballot. The measure is known by its supporters as the VOTERS FIRST Act for Congress. The Congressional Redistricting Initiative: * Added the task of re-drawing congressional district boundaries to the California Citizens Redistricting Commission (CCRC) created by Proposition 11. * Defined a \\"community of interest\\" as \\"a contiguous population which shares common social and economic interests that should be included within a single district for purposes of its effective and fair representation. Examples of such shared interests are those common to an urban area, an industrial area, or an agricultural area, and those common to areas in which the people share similar living standards, use the same transportation facilities, have similar work opportunities, or have access to the same media of communication relevant to the election process.\\" Ballot language was filed by Charles Munger, Jr., who was also Proposition 20's largest financial supporter. Munger, the son of billionaire Charlie Munger, was a supporter of Proposition 11 in 2008, which created a new way for political districts to be drawn for California's state legislators and its state Board of Equalization. A competing initiative that also qualified for the November 2 ballot, California Proposition 27 (2010), sought to repeal Proposition 11. Proposition 20 and Proposition 27 each had a so-called \\"poison pill\\" provision. This means that if they both received a majority vote, the proposition that received the highest majority vote is the law that would go into effect. Since Proposition 20 passed but Proposition 27 did not, neither provision was triggered. Ballot language ; Ballot title : ; Official summary : Removes elected representatives from the process of establishing congressional districts and transfers that authority to recently authorized 14-member redistricting commission Democrats, Republicans, and representatives of neither party. ; Summary of estimated fiscal impact : No significant net change in state redistricting costs. Congressional re-districting If this initiative had not succeeded, the next Governor of California and members of the California State Legislature would have chosen how to draw lines for however many U.S. Congressional districts California is determined to be entitled to after the 2010 census. Estimates are that California will have somewhere between 52 and 54 seats in congress after those census calculations are completed. From 2000 to 2010, the population in California has undergone a major shift eastward, with people moving to California's inland areas from its coastal enclaves. This means that California's congressional district boundaries will certainly undergo major upheaval after the 2010 census. As one example, the San Francisco Bay Area grew less than 1% since the last redistricting, while the Central Valley area has grown by 21%. Los Angeles County has grown 5%, while San Diego, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and Imperial Counties have grown by 17%. Another notable factor is that California's population hasn't grown relative to the population of the rest of the United States, and may even have proportionally shrunk. There were fears at the time that California could lose one or two seats in Congress. In the end California's representation in Congress remained the same, which was the first time the state had not increased its congressional representation since the reapportionment following the 1920 census. Constitutional changes Proposition 20 amended three sections of Article XXI of the California Constitution. The three sections are: * Section 1 of Article XXI * Section 2 of Article XXI * Section 3 of Article XXI Support=Supporters Charles Munger launched the campaign to qualify the Congressional Redistricting Initiative for the 2010 ballot. Munger was also a key supporter of 2008's Proposition 11, having given about $2 million to that effort. The New York Times characterized Proposition 20's supporters as \\"an unlikely collection of election-reform groups, civil rights nonprofits and former officials from both major parties who say that the current system of redistricting has left politicians unaccountable.\\" Supporters of Proposition 20 included: * California Chamber of Commerce * California State Conference of the NAACP * AARP * California Common Cause * IndependentVoice.Org * Bay Area Council * Arnold Schwarzenegger and Gray Davis A full list of the supporters of Proposition 20 is available from the \\"Yes on Proposition 20\\" website. Arguments in favor Arguments were submitted to the official California Voter Guide on behalf of a \\"yes\\" vote on Proposition 20, as were rebuttals to the arguments provided by Prop 20 opponents. The signers of these arguments were: * David Pacheco, the California President of AARP * Kathay Feng, the executive director of California Common Cause * John Kabateck, the executive director of the California chapter of the National Federal of Independent Business * Alice Huffman, President, the California chapter of the NAACP * Julian Canete, the executive director of the California Hispanic Chambers of Commerce * Richard Rider, chairman of the San Diego Tax Fighters The arguments made on behalf of Proposition 20 focus on these themes: * Proposition 20 will create fair U.S. congressional districts, which will in turn make California's representatives to the U.S. Congress more accountable and responsive, as well as making it easier to vote them out of office. * Proposition 20 ends the current system of members of the California State Legislature being in a position to draw the U.S. Congressional district boundaries \\"for their friends in Congress‚Äîdistricts that virtually guarantee Members of Congress get reelected even when they don‚Äôt listen to voters.\\" Also, \\"Right now, legislators and their paid consultants draw districts behind closed doors to guarantee their friends in Congress are reelected. Sacramento politicians pick the voters for their friends in Congress, rather than voters choosing who will represent them.\\" * Proposition 20 is a simple and intuitive extension of a ballot initiative that California voters already approved, California Proposition 11 (2008). * Under the current system, politicians have used their redistricting powers to bring about unfair results, and Proposition 20 will put an end to that. For example, \\"In the last redistricting, Latino leaders sued after a California Congressman had 170,000 Latinos carved out of his district just to ensure he‚Äôd get reelected. Now he‚Äôs leading the charge against 20!\\" Opposition Opposition to Proposition 20 is primarily driven by the supporters of Proposition 27. Donors against State Rep. Charles Calderon, a $100,000 donor to the \\"Yes on 27\\" campaign. Two campaign committees have officially registered in opposition to Proposition 20. Through September 22, neither of the committees specifically aimed at Proposition 20 had received any contributions to speak of. They are: * The \\"No on 20\\" campaign committee. * The \\"California Coalition for Leadership and Accountability in Budget and Redistricting, Yes on 25 & 27, No on 20\\" campaign committee. However, due to the fact that California Proposition 27 contains \\"poison pill\\" language with respect to Proposition 20, any money spent to promote a \\"yes\\" vote on Proposition 27 amounts to money spent to hurt Proposition 20, and vice versa. That main campaign committee endorsing a \\"yes\\" vote on California Proposition 27 has raised millions of dollars, including a substantial amount of money from 17 members of the California's delegation to the U.S. Congress as well as members of the California State Legislature. Arguments against Arguments were submitted to the official California Voter Guide urging a \\"no\\" vote on Proposition 20, as were rebuttals to the arguments provided by Prop 20 supporters. The signers of these arguments were: * Daniel H. Lowenstein, a professor at UCLA and a former chairman of the California Fair Political Practices Commission. * Mark Murray, the executive director of \\"Californians Against Waste\\" * Hank Lacayo, president of the \\"Congress of California Seniors\\" * Aubry L. Stone, president of the California Black Chamber of Commerce * Carl Pope, chairman of the Sierra Club The themes of the main arguments they make against Proposition 20 (and in favor of Proposition 27) are: * Proposition 20 will be \\"a waste of taxpayer dollars\\". * Proposition 20 is said by its opponents to turn back the clock on redistricting law. Proposition 20 mandates that all districts (including Assembly, Senate, and Congress) must be segregated by income level and mandates that all districts be segregated according to 'similar living standards' and that districts include only people 'with similar work opportunities.'\\" Editorial opinion=Yes on Prop 20 Newspapers that have editorialized in favor of Proposition 20 include: * Contra Costa Times: * Lompoc Record: * The Long Beach Press-Telegram: * Los Angeles Daily News: * The Los Angeles Times: * North County Times: * The Orange County Register: * Riverside Press Enterprise: * San Bernardino Sun: * San Diego Union-Tribune: * Santa Rosa Press Democrat: * Santa Cruz Sentinel: * San Gabriel Valley Tribune: * Ventura County Star: No on Prop 20 * Sacramento Bee: Path to the ballot 694,354 signatures were required to qualify the initiative for the ballot. Supporters turned in 1,180,623 signature in mid-March 2010, and election officials announced on May 5, 2010 that after an inspection process, the signatures met or exceeded the minimum threshold for ballot qualification. The petition drive management company hired to collect the signatures was National Petition Management. NPM was paid $1,937,380 (through May 6) for their signature-gathering services.

When Constantine's co-ruler, the Empress Theodora died in 1056, Monomachos tried to usurp the throne but failed miserably, was exiled and became a figure of fun in the empire.  Career  Theodosios Monomachos was the grandson of another Theodosios Monomachos, an important bureaucrat under Basil II and Constantine VIII and the nephew of Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos, ruler of the Byzantine Empire.Norwich, pg. 327 In 1056 he was serving as president of the Byzantine Senate, an important administrative role reserved for senior members of the aristocracy.Finlay, pg. 530 Bid for the throne=Background Gold tetarteron showing Christ on the left and Theodora as sole ruler on the right Constantine IX died on 11 January 1055 without a legitimate heir. As he lay dying, he was persuaded by his councillors to ignore the rights of the elderly Empress Theodora and to pass the throne to the doux (Duke) of the Theme of Bulgaria, Nikephoros Proteuon. The plan was forestalled by Theodora, who vigorously asserted her right to rule. Theodora came out of retirement, convened the Senate and was proclaimed \\"emperor\\" by the imperial guard, shortly before Constantine died.Garland pp. 165‚Äì66Treadgold pg. 596 Theodora was in good health, active and disinclined to face her own mortality, despite being seventy-six years old. The patriarch Michael Keroularios advocated that Theodora should advance a subject to the throne through marriage to her, something which would have assured the succession. Theodora refused to consider a token marriage and refused to name an heir to the throne. Theodora became gravely ill with an intestinal disorder in late August 1056. On 31 August her advisors selected Michael Bringas, an aged civil servant and former military finance minister, to be emperor. According to Michael Psellus (1017/18‚Äì1078/96) his main attraction was that \\"he was less qualified to rule than he was to be ruled and directed by others\\". Theodora was unable to speak but her ministers decided that she had nodded at an appropriate moment; the Patriarch refused to believe it.Finlay, pg. 529Norwich, pg. 327 Failed putsch Gold tetarteron of Emperor Michael VI When Theodosios Monomachos heard that Theodora was dying he assumed that he would be selected as the next emperor. Hearing of the stalemate he decided to force the issue. He armed his household slaves and stormed the prison, arming the inmates. With this core of support and assisted by his son he rallied a mob behind him and marched through the streets of Constantinople to the Palace. There his supporters in the imperial court hoped to present their colleagues with a fait accompli, similar to that of Theodora's the year before.Skylitzes 481. 47‚Äì55Finlay, pg. 530Norwich, pg. 327 When the Varangian Guard, the imperial bodyguards, heard of this they formed up outside the Palace to stop him. They were reinforced by a hastily mustered group of sailors from the nearby imperial docks. Monomachos lost heart and headed for Hagia Sophia, the main cathedral, to enlist the support of the Patriarch.Norwich, pg. 327 By the time he arrived, many of his followers had drifted away. Horrified at the near riot on the streets, the Patriarch had barred the cathedral doors against him.Norwich, pg. 327 The Patriarch hurried to the Palace, where Bringas was crowned as Michael VI; Theodora died later the same day. Theodosios and his son were captured sitting on the outside steps of the church, abandoned by all. Surprisingly, this action was treated as street theatre rather than treason; Michael VI merely banished them to Pergamum. This increased the new emperor's popularity with the citizens of the city; they openly mocked Theodosios, composing insulting verses about his failed coup and calling out \\"The moron Monomachus did whatever he thought of\\". He was remembered on the streets of Constantinople as \\"Monomachus the moron\\".Zonaras 18.1.14Norwich, pg. 327  References  Sources =Primary Sources * John Zonaras, Extracts of History * John Skylitzes, Synopsis of Histories Secondary Sources * George Finlay, History of the Byzantine Empire from 716 ‚Äì 1057, William Blackwood & Sons, 1853 Edinburgh; London  Category:11th-century Byzantine people Category:Byzantine usurpers Theodosios Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown ","title":"Theodosios Monomachos"},{"id":"29149008","text":"The entrance to 130 West 30th Street, designed by Cass Gilbert, the location of the synagogue's first permanent home.

They trained him for a number of years. He directed a wartime propaganda short Freedom Comes High (1943) and was dialogue director in Dixie (1943). He was given his first chance to direct a feature film in 1944. He made a highly auspicious debut with The Uninvited, an atmospheric and memorable ghost story set on the misty coast of south-west England, starring Ray Milland and Gail Russell. The film was very favourably received and subsequently acquired the status of a classic of its genre. Allen again worked with Russell twice, in Our Hearts Were Young and Gay (1945), a comedy, and on The Unseen (1945), a film with a similar supernatural theme which is often considered the unofficial follow-up to The Uninvited. He was borrowed by RKO in Those Endearing Young Charms (1945) - a big hit at the time.

Allen later said that he found Milland a pleasure to work with, and the two teamed up again in Sealed Verdict (1948), a topical drama dealing with the prosecution of Nazi war criminals in the American-occupied zone of post-war Germany. Allen did some second unit directing on The Great Gatsby (1949) with Alan Ladd. He then made a pair of Alan Ladd vehicles, Chicago Deadline (1950) and Appointment with Danger (1951).

Life Ayres was of very humble origin, and the date and place of his birth are unknown. Coming up from the country a poor lad, he became footman to Mr. William Ashhurst (or Ashurst), alderman of London, then resident at Hornsey, who was knighted in 1689, and lord mayor of London in 1693-94. His master, taking a great liking to him, sent him to school, where he gained skill in writing and arithmetic. He continued some years in Ashurst's service, but marrying a fellow-servant with ¬£200, he was enabled to set up as a teacher of writing and accounts in St. Paul's Churchyard, where his industry and ability soon procured him so many scholars that his income from teaching alone was nearly ¬£800 a year. About 1680 he commenced the execution and publication of calligraphic works which made him famous as one of the great reformers in the writing commonwealth, and the introducer into this country of the beautiful Italian hand. Robert More, in his essay on the First Invention of Writing, prefixed to his own Specimens of Penmanship (1716?), says: \\"The late Colonel Ayres (a disciple of Mr. Topham) introduced the bastard Italian hand amongst us, which by the best masters has been admitted, naturalised, and improved. Nor is it a diminution of our characters which survive him that therein the colonel was the common father of us all. He earned the glory of English penmanship far beyond his predecessors.\\" Ayres continued teaching and publishing scholastic works until his sudden death, from apoplexy, while regaling some friends at Vauxhall. The date of this occurrence is not known; but it was before 1709, as Rayner, his scholar, who published his Paul's Scholar's Copy Book in that year, alludes to his death. His contemporaries speak of him as \\"colonel\\" and \\"major\\", in reference, apparently, to his position in some of the city bands. Publications The works which he issued from the Rolling Press were: * The Accomplished Clerk, a Copy Book shewing the natural Freedom of y Pen in Writing all the usual hands of Eng [sic], by John Ayres. Sold at the Hand and Pen in St. Paul's Churchy'd. This was engraved by the celebrated John Sturt, and apparently issued about 1680, since in 1700 he reproduced the work as (2) The Accomplished Clerk Re-graved, and in the preface speaks of his \\"first essays, twenty years before, to introduce the engraving of writing, and overcome the ditticulty of making the graver come up nicely for the nature and freedom of the pen\\". (Only three of the twenty-five plates were from the original work.) * A work which seems to have been a second issue of his first book, The Accomplished Clerk, or Accurate Penman, dedicated to his former teacher, Mr. Thomas Topham, and dated 25 April 1683. The last of these twenty-five specimens is a fine instance of the softness, delicacy, and ornamental beauty of the new Italian hand. * The Tradesman's Copy Book, or Apprentice's Companion, showing Varieties of Receipts, Bills, &c.; written in all the modish Running-hands now used, 20 pi. ob. 4to, 1687. * The Youth's Introduction to Trade; an Exercise Book * The Paul's School Round- hand, Strong Running-hand, and Mercantile Round-hand, engraved by Sturt, 1700. * Alamode Secretarie, or Practical Penman, a Writing Book, also engraved by Sturt, 28 long 8vo pl. * The Penman's Daily Practise, Shewing much Variety of Command of hand, which he calls \\"a cyfering book\\", 34 plates of alphabets and tables of arithmetic, engraved by Sturt (n.d.). * The Writing Master, or Tutor to Penmanship, 50 large plates of all the Varieties of English Writing (n.d.). * A Striking Copy Book, 14 plates of capital-letters. * Materot Redivivus, the Italian Mr., Shewing the great Variety and beauty of the Italian hand, 1690. (Materot was the famous penman of Paris.) * The grandest, however, of all his works was A Tutor to Penmanship or the Writing Master, which he dedicated to King William III in a most pompous and yet interesting address. It was in two parts, with 48 large obl. fol. plates. Engraved by John Sturt, who also puts forward a long and curious address. The preface is dated 15 Jan. 1697-8. Ayres's portrait was in this work, also in the Accomplished Clerk (No. 3 above); but in the British Museum copies these works from Sturt's graver are wanting. There are only five of these famous books of penmanship in our national collection. Ayres also published Arithmetic made Easie for the Use and Benefit of Tradesmen, 1693, dedicated to his former master, Sir William Ashurst, Knt. The second edition, \\"much corrected and enlarged\\", 1695, is in 12mo, 190 pp. There were many editions before and after his death;, the twelfth, published in 1714, has additional pages on bookkeeping by Charles Snell, his fellow-pupil and former rival in the reform of the art of writing, with whom it was said he had many bickerings in the course of their joint career. Ayres's poorly executed effigies is given in the later editions of his Arithmetic.

(\\"The project of building the Saint Mary of Huesca cathedral was initiated during the time of James I of Aragon (1213‚Äì1276).\\") is a Roman Catholic church in Huesca, in Aragon, north-eastern Spain. It is the seat of the Bishop of Huesca. Its architecture is Gothic, and its construction began in the late 13th century and was finished in the early 16th century. Construction The project of building the Cathedral of Huesca was initiated during the time of James I of Aragon (1213‚Äì1276), which is rather late when compared to other churches in the area, which date back to the Romanesque period. This is because in Huesca, Christian worship took place for almost two centuries in the mosque building, until the late 13th century. As the newly consecrated bishop of Huesca, the nephew of James I (James Sarroca), the king considered Christian worship in the mosque inappropriate. So in 1273, he proposed the building of a new gothic cathedral, which was on the increase in Europe, on top of the old mosque (of which just a horseshoe arch in the cloister area, which could have been used entry to the minaret tower of the mosque). But several lawsuits delayed the start of construction until 1294. The initial design proposed a construction of three naves, with five chapels at the front and a transept. The interior of the cathedral Situated next to the old mosque the Wasqah Taifa, it came up in the 12th century. The small Romanesque church was dedicated to Saint Mary of Joy. It comprises a frame with three archivolts: a segmented interior and external columns at the entrance. The innermost archivolt is decorated with Zamoran coils. Alight by a pair of two pairs of pilasters and chapels, with their corresponding shafts, with simple interior decoration. A part of the original Romanesque cloister is attached to the north side of the temple of which only the north and east bays and the southern part remain. The west bay was destroyed to build the Gothic cloister of Pope Luna, extending the south and north bays of the Romanesque. The general design of the temple consists of a Latin cross with side chapels and three naves of four sections as well as the transept. The front was built with five apses between 1294 and 1309. The north wall of the transept was also constructed, with its round-arched doorway the annexe, which was used for the vestry (the \\"Old Sacristy) and for archiving. Construction of the lateral naves took place between 1296 and 1304 Later he built the side chapels by his own initiative. Apostles. Between 1327 and 1348 the simple groin vaults in the side naves were put up and the central nave and the transept were covered with a wooden roof. The front of the cathedral, which is the work of the builder Guillem Ingl√©s is an outstanding piece of Gothic sculpture. Consisting of seven archivolts that are home to sixteen figures, fourteen virgins, ten angels and eight prophets. The typanum is dominated by a statue of the Virgin and Child, and the sides by the Magi and the resurrected Christ with Mary Magdalene. In the same period of the 15th century, thanks to the initiative of Pope Luna, Benedict XIII, part of a Gothic cloister was created, with the aim of restoring and replacing the old Romanesque one. The only part that was actually built was the corridor on the south side. The rest is now incomplete in what is now the Medieval Art Hall of the Cathedral Museum. At the beginning of 1520, Damian Forment was commissioned to erect the cathedral's main altarpiece. Made of alabaster, the body is a large triptych of three scenes depicting the Passion of Christ. Bell tower and spire Idealized reconstruction of the spire. The bell tower was built between 1369 and 1423, first time up four floors. This was by the contractors Juan de Algui√±ero and Juan de Quadros, and in its last stage of building, Pere Jalopa completed it, topping the tower with a beautiful pentagonal spire. Unfortunately this disappeared during the Republican siege of the city during the Spanish Civil War of 1936. This beautiful spire tower that used to rise one third higher than its current height, for various reasons has not been reconstructed. However there are plans for a rebuilding project, restoring the Cathedral's imposing stature that it once had.

The album was to be her official solo debut album (after the cancellation of her other album, Cold as Ice), it was also expected to be Charli's big comeback. The album spawned a total of five buzz singles but none of them managed to chart. Because of the lack of charting performance from her singles and with no promotion from her label, the album was shelved. Background and recording After striking a deal with Murder Inc. CEO Irv Gotti, Charli Baltimore began recording the album in 2001 under the label. Most of the material from the album was recorded in Soundtrack Studios, Manhattan, New York City, New York. During recording sessions, former label- mates claimed that Charli would have numerous songs completed and the quantity of them would be more than what producers, Irv Gotti and Chink Santana would have instrumental beats finished for her. At one point, a power outage occurred at the studio, where she and producers were working at, and shortly after the incident was resolved, Charli had recorded a total of 12 songs within that same night. In 2002, it was revealed that she had named her album, The Diary; she had confirmed it was inspired by Diary. Charli briefly explained to MTV in a 2002 interview about the concept of the album: Singles The album spawned five buzz singles in hopes of creating buzz for the album: * \\"No One Does It Better\\", featuring former labelmate, Ashanti, was released in June 2002 as the first buzz single for the album.

The focus of this Chiang Mai festival is at the public garden of Suan Buak Haad at the southwest corner of the moat. The road next to the moat all around the park is closed to traffic, and vendors of plants, flowers, orchids and garden decorations set up their stalls there.  Suan Buak Haad city park  Suan Buak Haad is a pleasant public space, with formal gardens arranged around a series of pools and bridges. There is a children's play area, and places where refreshments are available. For the weekend of the Flower Festival the park is transformed, with colorful displays of flowers, miniature trees, and local orchids, all set out for the judges to choose the best of each species. There are also displays by landscape specialists, featuring waterfalls, patios and various schemes of garden decoration. There are stands representing gardens from neighbouring countries, and stands selling local products. Flower Festival parade The Flower Festival Parade has typically started early on Saturday morning, but in 2014, the festival parade ran as an afternoon/evening affair. The flower parade lines up along Charoen Muang Road, all the way from the Nawarat Bridge to the train station. At 16:00 the parade starts and moves up Tha Phae Road to Tha Phae Gate. It then turns left and follows the moat around to Suan Buak Haad. Typically, the flower parade moves very slowly, and stops frequently. Western-style marching bands from local schools and local drumming groups are interspersed among the floats. Dancers in traditional costumes perform Thai dances, and often those taking part in the flower parade hand out flowers to the spectators. Miss Chiang Mai Flower Festival Many of the girls atop the gaily decorated floats and carriages are candidates for the Miss Chiang Mai Flower Festival competition. By late afternoon the really serious part of the festival, choosing the Chiang Mai Flower Festival Queen, begins. Loud rock music and liquid refreshments aid the deliberations. The party goes on into the evening until the Flower Festival Queen is chosen.

Life and career Williams was born in Mobile, Alabama, in 1911, and by 1918 had moved with his family to Los Angeles. He was a leader of the Harlem Dukes band in the 1940s. While performing at gigs, he came up with the idea of recording other artists. In 1949, Williams founded the Blue Records label. Two years later he changed the name to Dootone. One of the first artists he recorded on Dootone was a violinist named Johnny Creach, who years later would become popular as Papa John Creach. In 1954, he recorded a local group called The Penguins, who would have a huge hit with \\"Earth Angel\\". While the label would record a wide variety of music, it would be best known for a series of comedy recordings by Redd Foxx. Williams saw the comedian perform at the Brass Rail, a local Los Angeles nightclub, and signed Foxx to a recording contract.

The coup rendered powerless the democratically elected government of Yun Bo-seon and ended the Second Republic, installing a reformist military Supreme Council for National Reconstruction effectively led by Park, who took over as Chairman after General Chang's arrest in July. The coup was instrumental in bringing to power a new developmentalist elite and in laying the foundations for the rapid industrialization of South Korea under Park's leadership, but its legacy is controversial for the suppression of democracy and civil liberties it entailed, and the purges enacted in its wake. Termed the \\"May 16 Military Revolution\\" by Park and his allies, \\"a new, mature national debut of spirit\\", the coup's nature as a \\"revolution\\" is controversial and its evaluation contested. Background and causes The background to the coup can be analysed both in terms of its immediate context, and the broader setting of the development of post-liberation South Korea. While the Second Republic presented South Korea with a singularly problematic economic and political climate which encouraged a military intervention, the direct roots of the coup stretch back to the late Rhee period, and more recent historians such as Yong- Sup Han argue that the frequently recurring image of the coup as an inevitable direct response purely to the vagaries of a new regime paralyzed by endemic instability is over-simplistic. South Korea under Syngman Rhee From 1948, South Korea was governed by President Syngman Rhee, an anti-Communist who used the Korean War to consolidate a monopoly on political power in the republic. Rhee represented the interests of a conservative ruling class, the so-called \\"liberation aristocrats\\" who had risen to positions of influence under American occupation. These \\"liberation aristocrats\\" formed the bulk of the political class, encompassing both Rhee's supporters and his rivals in the Democratic Party, which advanced a vision of society broadly similar to his own. Rhee eliminated any significant source of real opposition, securing for example the execution of Cho Bong-am, who had campaigned against him in the presidential elections of 1956 on a platform of peaceful reunification and had attracted some 30% of the vote, an unacceptably high level of support for an opposition candidate. Even such significant opposition figures as Cho, however, can be considered to have been part of the broad conservative consensus of the governing class, which rested on a traditionalist, Confucian worldview that saw \\"pluralism in ideology and equality in human relationships [as] foreign concepts\\", and which upheld the value of paternalist government and the power of extensive networks of political patronage. Rhee, under this traditionalist model, was the foremost \\"elder\\" in Korean society, to whom Koreans owed familial allegiance, and this relationship was strengthened by the ties of obligation that connected Rhee to many in the ruling class. One result of the rule of the \\"liberation aristocrats\\" was the stalling of development in South Korea, in marked contrast to the situation in nearby Japan. Where South Korea had been intensively developed under the Japanese colonial system, Rhee's presidency saw little significant effort to develop the South Korean economy, which remained stagnant, poor and largely agrarian. The lack of development under Rhee provoked a growing nationalistic intellectual reaction which called for a radical restructuring of society and a thorough political and economic reorganization, rejecting the American model being pursued by the governing elite. Park Chung-hee, the later leader of the May Coup who at that time was a second-tier army officer with decidedly ambiguous political leanings, was heavily influenced by this unfolding intellectual reaction. Social and economic problems of the Second Republic After rigged elections in March 1960, growing protests developed into the April Revolution, and Rhee was pressured by the United States into a peaceful resignation on April 26. With Rhee out of the way, a new constitution was promulgated establishing the Second Republic, and legislative elections on June 29 resulted in a landslide victory for the Democratic Party, with Rhee's Liberals reduced to a mere two seats in the newly constituted lower house of the National Assembly. The Second Republic adopted a parliamentary system, with a figurehead president as head of state; executive power was effectively vested in the prime minister and cabinet. Democrat Yun Bo-seon was elected as president in August, with former Vice-President Chang Myon becoming prime minister. The April Revolution The Second Republic was beset with problems from the start, with bitter factionalism in the ruling Democratic Party competing with implacable popular unrest for the government's attention. The South Korean economy deteriorated under heavy inflation and high rates of unemployment, while recorded crime rates more than doubled; from December 1960 to April 1961, for example, the price of rice increased by 60 percent, while unemployment remained above 23%. Widespread food shortages resulted. Chang Myon, meanwhile, representing the Democratic Party's \\"New Faction\\", had been elected Prime Minister by the thin margin of three votes. Purges of Rhee's appointees were rendered ineffective in the public eye by Chang's manipulation of the suspect list to favour wealthy businessmen and powerful generals. Although Rhee had been removed and a democratic constitution instituted, the \\"liberation aristocrats\\" remained in power, and the worsening problems facing South Korea were proving insurmountable for the new government. The breakdown of South Korean politics and the administrative purges racking the army combined to demoralise and discourage the Military Security Command, which was charged with the maintenance of the chain of command in the military and weeding out insubordination. The reluctance of the Military Security Command to act allowed plans for a coup to unfold, and so the problems of the Second Republic not only provided a justification and an intellectual movement for a coup, but also directly enabled the coup to be organised and realised. Factionalism in the military A direct factor in paving the way to the coup was factionalism in the South Korean army itself, one of the largest in the world at the time with 600,000 soldiers. The army had been given a distinctive identity by the dual Japanese and subsequently American training that many of its members had received, \\"combin[ing] the Japanese militarist ethos with the American spirit of technical efficiency to expand its mission from defending the country against communist aggression to that of helping it build itself into a modern nation\\". Reformist junior officers viewed the senior generals as having been corrupted by party politics, and the problem was compounded by a bottleneck in promotions caused by the consolidation of the positions of the senior commanders of the army after the end of its rapid expansion in the Korean War. The army was also divided along regional lines and between factions of officers who had graduated from the same school. Of the latter, the most influential were the competing factions who had graduated from the Japanese Military Academy and from the Manchurian officers' school at Xinjing respectively, while more lower-ranked officers were divided by their class of graduation from the post-liberation Korean Military Academy. Park Chung-hee had attended all three institutions, and was uniquely positioned to lead what would become the coup coalition, with his extensive ties among both the senior commanders of the army and the younger factions. After the overthrow of the Rhee regime and the institution of the Second Republic, the reformists, led by KMA alumni, began to call for the senior commanders to be held to account for complicity in the rigging of the 1960 and 1956 presidential elections. Park Chung-hee, relatively high-ranking as Major General, threw himself into the spotlight by declaring his support for the reformists and demanding the resignation of Army Chief of Staff Song Yo-chan on May 2. On September 24, sixteen colonels, led by Kim Jong-pil, demanded the resignation of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Choi Yong-hui in an incident known as the \\"revolt against seniors\\" (). By this point, initial plans for a coup were already advanced, and the \\"revolt against seniors\\" removed an important potential enemy. Planning and organization=Central organization The first plan for a military coup to evolve was the so-called \\"May 8 plan\\", a plan calling for a putsch on May 8, 1960. This plan was discussed and formulated at the start of 1960 by reformist officers including Park, and was aimed at unseating Rhee from the presidency. This plan never moved significantly beyond being an idea, and was soon superseded by the April Revolution. From May to October 1960, however, Park assembled a variety of officers to organize a new plan for a coup, largely on the basis of his ties with other graduates of the Manchurian Military Academy. He also secured the loyalty of the editor of the Pusan Daily News, aiming to ensure a propaganda basis for the coup. By October, Park had gathered nine core members, tasking his close associate Kim Jong-pil with the role of general secretary. Fortuitously in November, Park was transferred from his post at Pusan to Seoul, and at a meeting on November 9 at his Seoul residence, the core group decided that they would manipulate the anti-corruption movement within the military to support their aims. Furthermore, it was decided that Park would focus on building support for the coup among other generals, while the other core members would recruit younger officers and construct revolutionary cells within and outside Seoul. By Chang Do-yong's account, however, on January 12, 1961, it was discovered that Park had been placed on a list of 153 officers scheduled to be moved to the Reserve Army in May. This discovery would likely have accelerated the plans for the coup. The historian Kim Hyung-A suggests by contrast that it is possible that Chang, as Army Chief of Staff, deliberately spread the rumors of Park's imminent removal in order to provide political cover for the coup; he concludes that \\"it is obvious that Park had received extraordinary support from someone in power\\". Immediate preparation Army Chief of Staff Chang Do-yong Over the course of the next half-year, the coup plans became an open secret within the military. Park failed in winning over the army's Counter-Intelligence Command and the armored Ninth Division, but neither organization reported the plans to higher authorities, allowing the planning to proceed unimpeded. As 1960 drew to a close, moreover, Park began parallel talks outside of his core group, structuring a loose network of supporters for his plan; among those brought in by these talks was Major General Lee Chu-il, with whom Park agreed that once the coup had taken place, the new Army Chief of Staff Chang Do-yong would be placed as head of the Revolutionary Council in order to get the entire army's support. In March 1961, the core group met at the Chungmu-jang Restaurant in Seoul, and fixed the date April 19 for the coup, expecting significant disturbances on that day due to its being the anniversary of the revolution that had overthrown Rhee's regime. Park also secured the financial backing of prominent businessmen, amassing a total of 7.5 million hwan. Finally, on April 10, 1961, Park took the initiative in revealing the details of the plan to Chang himself. Chang's subsequent ambivalent response was decisive in allowing the coup to take place. While he turned down the leadership position offered to him, he neither informed the civilian government of the plan, nor ordered the arrest of the conspirators. This allowed Park to present Chang as an \\"invisible hand\\" guiding the organization of the coup. According to Han, this ambivalence was most likely because Chang had calculated that the coup organizers had by this time gathered too much momentum to stop, though this analysis assumes Chang's earlier non-involvement. The date of April 19 passed without the expected disturbances, however, and the planners rescheduled the coup for May 12. Failed coup of May 12 and emergency planning At some time shortly after this, the May 12 plan was finally leaked by accident to the military security forces, who reported it to Prime Minister Chang Myon and Defense Minister Hyeon Seok-ho. Chang Myon was dissuaded from commissioning an investigation by the intervention of Army Chief of Staff Chang Do-yong, who convinced him that the security report was unreliable. Pervasive unrealized rumours of the imminence of a military coup also contributed to Chang Myon's decision, and the report on the May 12 plan was dismissed as a false alarm. The coup organizers responded by aborting the May 12 plan and fixing a new, and final, date and time, 3am on May 16. Course of events The plot was leaked once again early in the morning of May 16, and this time immediate action was taken. The Counter-Intelligence Command raised an alert that a mutiny was underway, and a detachment of military police was sent to round up the suspected perpetrators. Park moved to the Sixth District Army Headquarters to take personal control of the coup operations and salvage the plan. Park gave a speech to the assembled soldiers, saying: The speech was so successful that even the military police who had been dispatched to arrest the mutineers defected to their cause. With the Sixth District Army now secure under his control, Park chose Colonel Kim Jae-chun to organize the vanguard of the occupation of Seoul and dispatched a message to Chang Do-yong, instructing him to definitively join the coup or suffer the consequences of association with the civilian government. He then departed for Special Forces Command, where he issued instructions to cross the Han River and occupy the presidential residence at the Blue House. Meanwhile, an artillery brigade occupied the central Army Headquarters and secured the downtown areas of Seoul north of the Han. By 4:15am, after a brief exchange of fire with loyalist military police who were guarding the bridge across the Han, Park's forces had occupied the administrative buildings of all three branches of government. They proceeded to seize the headquarters of the Korean Broadcasting Company, issuing a proclamation announcing the Military Revolutionary Committee's seizure of power: General Lee Han-lim, the only commanding officer to declare public opposition to the coup The broadcast went on to outline the policy objectives of the coup, including anti-communism, strengthening of ties with the United States, the elimination of political corruption, the construction of an autonomous national economy, Korean reunification, and the removal of the present generation of politicians. The proclamation was issued in the name of Chang Do-yong, who was referred to as the Chairman of the Committee, but this was without his prior approval. When dawn broke, a marine corps unit under Kim Yun-geun crossed the Han River and took control of the Blue House as instructed. The civilian government rapidly imploded. Prime Minister Chang Myon had fled Seoul on hearing of the coup, and President Yun Bo-seon accepted the coup as a fait accompli. Yun continued to serve as nominal head of state until 1963, though stripped of all effective power. Commander Lee Han-lim of the First Army had prepared to mobilize the reserves to suppress the coup, but backed down to prevent an opportunity for a North Korean attack. He was arrested two days later. Twenty heavily armed divisions now stood in support of the coup in Seoul, preventing any realistic chance of its suppression. After three days of hiding, Chang Myon reappeared to announce the resignation of the entire cabinet, and ceded power to the new junta. Army cadets marched through the streets proclaiming their support for the coup. Chang Do-yong now accepted his appointment as chairman of the Committee, granting it the final stamp of authority that it required. The May 16 coup was now complete. Aftermath=Consolidation and power struggle The leaders of the Military Revolutionary Committee pictured on 20 May, four days after the coup: Chairman Chang Do-yong (left) and Vice-Chairman Park Chung-hee (right) The business of consolidating a new government began soon after the coup had been completed. Martial law was immediately put into force. On May 20, the Military Revolutionary Committee was renamed the Supreme Council for National Reconstruction (SCNR), and the following day a new cabinet was instituted. General Chang, the chairman of the committee, remained Army Chief of Staff, but also took on the additional offices of Prime Minister and Defense Minister, becoming formal head of the administration. The SCNR was formalized as a junta of the thirty highest-ranking military officers initially arranged in fourteen subcommittees, and assumed a wide-ranging responsibility that included the powers to promulgate laws, appoint cabinet posts, and oversee the functioning of the administration as a whole. The constitution of the new cabinet was the subject of an intense internal power struggle, however, and over the course of the next two months Park soon engineered a rapid transfer of power into his own hands. On June 6, the SCNR promulgated the Law Regarding Extraordinary Measures for National Reconstruction, which stripped Chang of his posts of Defense Minister and Army Chief of Staff. Much of this law was drafted by Yi Seok-che, who was operating under instructions from Park to \\"eliminate\\" Chang. Four days later, on June 10, the Supreme Council for National Reconstruction Law was enacted, which specified that the Deputy Chairman of the SCNR would be Chairman of its Standing Committee, granting Park additional powers. Finally, on July 3, Chang himself was arrested on a charge of conspiracy to carry out a counter-coup, and the June 10 law was amended to allow Park to assume the office of Chairman both of the SCNR and its Standing Committee. United States response Part of the immediate task of the coup leaders was to secure American approval for their new government. This approval came quickly, as on May 20, President John F. Kennedy dispatched a message to the SCNR confirming the friendship between the two countries. Carter B. Magruder, commander-in-chief of the United Nations Command, simultaneously announced the return to the ROK Army of all rights of operational command. By May 27, the coup leaders were confident in American support and dissolved the martial law they had imposed on the day of the coup. On June 24, American Ambassador Samuel D. Berger arrived in Seoul, and reportedly informed Park that the United States was interested in publicly supporting his government, but required the cessation of \\"purges and recriminations\\". Finally, on July 27, Secretary of State Dean Rusk announced the United States' official recognition of the SCNR government at a press conference. State building A significant development occurred soon after the coup with the planning and subsequent establishment of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA). Members of the Military Revolutionary Committee were briefed on May 20 by Kim Jong-pil on the intended functions of this new agency. The KCIA was realized on June 10 with the enactment of Law No. 619, which brought the agency into being under the direction of Kim Jong-pil. The KCIA would be Park's central power base throughout his leadership of South Korea, and it served an important function from the outset, granting Kim and Park the ability to remove Chang from the Council and to initiate a series of wide-ranging purges of civilian institutions. The KCIA was supported in this latter work by the Inspection Committee on Irregularities in the Public Service. The purges of state ministries were escalated by the announcement on July 20 of a policy programme aiming at the forced retirement of almost 41,000 \\"excess\\" bureaucrats and the reduction of the number of civil servants by 200,000. With the establishment of the KCIA and the commencement of extensive purges, Park's triumph in the power struggles that followed in the immediate aftermath of the May coup set the stage for the consolidation of Park Chung- hee's developmental regime. Legacy and evaluation The May 16 coup was the starting point of a series of military regimes that would last in some form until 1993. It also provided a precedent for the December Twelfth and the May Seventeenth coups of Chun Doo-hwan, Park's effective successor. With the development of a concerted opposition under Park and its evolution into the Gwangju Democratization Movement after 1980, the coup became the subject of much controversy, with many opponents of the military regime, such as Kim Dae Jung, looking back on the coup as an unjustified act of insurrectionary violence that toppled South Korea's first genuinely democratic government. Others point to the positive legacy of the coup, however, such as the 1994 Freedom House analysis which refers to the rapid industrialization that followed the coup and the \\"uncorrupt\\" nature of Park's rule. Name In official discourse before 1993, the coup was referred to as the \\"May 16 Revolution\\" (), but under the reforming non-military administration of erstwhile opposition leader Kim Young-sam, the event was re-designated as a coup or military insurrection (). Park had described the \\"May Revolution\\" as an \\"unavoidable ... act of self-defense by and for the Korean people\\", and in the historiography of the military regimes, the Revolution was presented as having been the result of the will of the nation as a whole. Kim Young-sam's re-designation of the event rejected this analysis, and was accompanied by the corresponding recognition of the April 1960 demonstrations as the \\"April Revolution\\". This reading was cemented in 1994‚Äì95 with curriculum reforms and the issuing of history textbooks applying the new labels.

The Tall Man first appeared in the first Phantasm in 1979, and his most recent appearance in the film Phantasm: Ravager in 2016. In all of his appearances, the Tall Man has been portrayed by Angus Scrimm.  Creation and conception  According to Don Coscarelli (director of the first four Phantasm films), the idea was to create a horror film about a boy inside a funeral home because he thought the way Americans handled dead bodies was mysterious. Angus Scrimm was chosen to portray the main villain because when Coscarelli and Scrimm worked together in a previous film Scrimm was able to frighten a kid by just staring at him while raising one eyebrow (this action later becomes one of the Tall Man's most iconic behaviors).https://web.archive.org/web/20131105114832/http://www.forteantimes.com/features/interviews/116/don_coscarelli.html Coscarelli also got the idea to feature flying spheres as Tall Man's minions. According to him, the idea came from his dream as a teen where he was being chased down corridors by a flying chrome ball. Later, when he wrote the Phantasm screenplay, he modified the spheres so they were able to drill and drain the blood from its victims. Fictional character biography Originally, the Tall Man was a mild-mannered 19th century mortician by the name of Jebediah Morningside. After years of performing funerals and burying the bodies of those who had died, he began to develop a fascination with any possible connection between our world and the world of the dead. Jebediah's research eventually led him to construct a machine that enabled him to travel through time and space. After going through the portal for the first time, travelling to a destination unknown, he promptly returned, irrevocably changed and henceforth known as the Tall Man.Phantasm IV: Oblivion (1998) Characterization The Tall Man appears as a tall and older white-haired man usually posing as a mortician. Subsequent to his transformation from Jebediah Morningside, he has only ever been seen to wear a tailored black suit, befitting his assumed profession. He seems to speak only rarely, preferring instead to rely on facial expressions, particularly the raising of one eyebrow, the latter of which in particular has become an icon of the character. Powers and weapons The Tall Man has superhuman strength, and has been seen lifting a man or even an entire (occupied) coffin with only one arm and little effort. He has also been seen to possess telekinetic abilities, able to control both inanimate objects and people with only the use of his mind. Despite his mundane outward appearance, any parts of the Tall Man's body that are severed or otherwise amputated from the whole have been known to subsequently transform into hostile insect-like creatures, or to bleed a yellow colored substance (possibly his blood, but probably intended to represent embalming fluid.)Phantasm (1979) He also has the ability to shapeshift into other people including women in order to trick potential victims. The Tall Man routinely surrounds himself with various accomplices, ranging from apparently willing human aides to resurrected corpses and other demonic creatures. His main source of assistance comes in the form of corpses that he exhumes from the graveyards under his control; after digging up the cadavers, he crushes the body to the size of a dwarf, removes the brain and reanimates the body. Despite their diminutive stature, these dwarves (also known as \\"Lurkers\\") constitute the majority of the Tall Man's forces, alongside foes wearing gas masks (also known as \\"Gravers\\"). The Tall Man also utilizes flying metallic spheres (also known as \\"Sentinels\\") that conceal within them many offensive weapons, including blades, drills, lasers and circular saws. The spheres, which have come to be considered the Tall Man's signature weapons, contain (and are apparently controlled by) the shrunken brains removed from the Lurkers. Later, Tall Man also utilizes some kind of alien virus. When a human is infected, the victim's head will explode and the virus will spread.Phantasm Ravager (2016) Though he has thus far been impossible to permanently kill, the Tall Man can be hurt. It has been shown on more than one occasion that he has an extreme aversion to cold; Mike Pearson, another main character in the Phantasm films, says that this might possibly be because the realm he comes from is very warm. He has also displayed a vulnerability to certain pitches of sound, which can temporarily immobilize him. On those occasions when his body has sustained mortal injury, an identical new Tall Man has immediately emerged from his portal, ready to continue on unfazed from where his predecessor left off.Phantasm III: Lord of the Dead (1994) Influence * The character Captain Phasma from Star Wars series was named so because according to J.J. Abrams (director of The Force Awakens), the metallic appearance of Captain Phasma reminded him about Tall Man's metallic spheres.https://ew.com/article/2015/08/12/star-wars-force- awakens-character-names/6/ * The popular creepypasta character Slender Man is inspired by Tall Man.

Features and location The lagoon has a surface area of approximately and a catchment area of . When full, the Terrigal Lagoon covers an area of around . A large part of the upper catchment area of Terrigal Lagoon is rural land, most of which has been cleared. The lower slopes in the vicinity of the lagoon contain extensive urban development.

The North Arm of the creek drains an area of approximately and the West Arm . Wamberal Lagoon and Avoca Lake located to the north and south respectively, are a short distance away.  Research of the Terrigal Lagoon  From 2005 to 2008 a study, led by Dr. John Marsdale from the University of Newcastle, completed a region-wide survey of waterways. As part of the study, the investigation included the availability of sunlight for plants, turbidity levels, population density of plants and animals residing in the lagoon area, potassium levels, oxygen levels, and water pH levels. The research team found that abiotic features in the area greatly affected biotic organisms within the lagoon. Marsdale's team also found that the light level available to shrubbery in the lagoon lessened over during the course of the study due to growth of taller trees taking critical sunlight from the smaller grounded plants. Marsdale discovered disturbingly high potassium levels in the area in comparison to elsewhere in the region. The potassium levels were effecting not only the fish in the lagoon but also the multitudes of plants that lined the waters edge. The team also found that there was an overall decrease in the distribution of species in the lagoon area particularly concerning animals and some fish species. 278x278px See also * List of lakes of Australia ReferencesExternal links * Category:Lagoons of Australia Category:Coastline of New South Wales Category:Central Coast (New South Wales) Category:Lakes of New South Wales ","title":"Terrigal Lagoon"},{"id":"29150140","text":"Aloiampelos tenuior, formerly Aloe tenuior, the fence aloe, is a bushy, multi- branched succulent plant from the grasslands and thickets of the Eastern Cape, Kwazulu Natal and Mpumalanga, South Africa.

Taxonomy and etymology Determination of the taxonomy of Coenocorypha snipe has been hindered by lack of material, erroneous locality data, misidentified specimens and confused nomenclature.Higgins & Davies (1996). The South Island snipe was formerly considered to be a subspecies of the Subantarctic snipe (Coenocorypha aucklandica), but has since been elevated to a full species, with fossil material from the South Island referred to it.Worthy et al. (2002).Baker et al. (2009). The specific epithet honours ornithologist Tom Iredale. The MƒÅori name, \\"tutukiwi\\", which may be applied to other Coenocorypha snipes, alludes to the bird's fancied resemblance to a miniature kiwi.Oliver (2005). Distribution and extinction The South Island snipe is extinct. Its prehistoric distribution comprised the South Island and Stewart Island, including some smaller islands off Stewart Island. It became extinct on both South Island and Stewart Island following the occupation of New Zealand by Polynesians (the ancestors of the MƒÅori people) and the associated introduction of Pacific rats (Rattus exulans). It survived on at least nine small islands until the late 19th and 20th centuries but was progressively extirpated on them following introductions of rats and other exotic predators, as well as weka, with the last records coming from Big South Cape and Pukaweka Islands in the early 1960s. The final chapter of the story of the South Island snipe came with the accidental introduction of black rats to Big South Cape Island, and the consequent attempt in 1964 by the New Zealand Wildlife Service, including Brian Bell and Don Merton, to rescue the snipe by transferring individuals to a rat-free island. Two birds were caught on 30 August and placed in an aviary. However, they were difficult to care for because of their need for a continuous supply of live food, and both died on 1 September. Since then there have been no acceptable records of the species. Subsequently, some 40 years later on 16 April 2005, 30 Snares snipes, then considered to be conspecific though a different subspecies, were translocated successfully by the New Zealand Department of Conservation to Putauhinu Island, only 1.5 km west of Big South Cape Island and a former home of South Island snipe, after the rats were eradicated there.Charteris & Miskelly (2005). Description The snipe was similar to other Coenocorypha snipe, a small (21‚Äì24 cm in length), chunky and cryptically patterned wader with bars, stripes and spots in shades of brown ranging from buffy-white to nearly black, with longitudinal stripes on the face and crown. It had a long bill, with a short neck, legs and tail. The outer tail feathers were narrow and stiffened, a modification to produce the distinctive roaring sound of the nocturnal \\"hakawai\\" aerial display. The species differed from others in the genus by details of plumage patterning and shading ‚Äì in having a scalloped breast and flanks with rufous and cinnamon tinges. Behaviour One of the few people to make any kind of field study of the South Island snipe was naturalist Herbert Guthrie-Smith who reported on a 1923 visit to Big South Cape Island in his book Sorrows and Joys of a New Zealand Naturalist (1936): > \\"Snipe begin to lay about the end of October and continue during the early > November.

Supp. 1278 (S.D.N.Y. 1985), aff'd in part, 781 F.2d 198 (Fed. Cir. 1986) As a result, Rise gel was withdrawn from the market. The company also successfully sued The Gillette Company for infringement based on its Foamy brand gel.Gillette Co. v. S. C. Johnson & Son, Inc., 919 F.2d 720 (Fed. Cir. 1990). Foamy, which had long been the best- selling shaving cream, had introduced a gel version in 1983 to compete with Edge. The trial court in the Gillette lawsuit found that Edge accounted for more than 20% of the market for shaving products at the time of trial, and the appellate court described the Edge gel product as \\"an overwhelming commercial success\\". Despite the lawsuit, Foamy gel remained on the market because by the time of the trial court's decision, S. C. Johnson's patent had expired. By 1993, Edge had reached 30% of the shaving cream and gel market, leading the category. Sale to Energizer Holdings S. C.

Its natural range lies just to the west of the related Aloiampelos ciliaris, and it occurs in bushy fynbos and dry thickets, and clustered on rocky outcrops at all altitudes. Its range extends westwards into the Baviaanskloof mountains. Description The red flowers of Aloiampelos gracilis often appear on multi-branched racemes Its thin stems grow tall and erect from its base on the ground, often reaching 2 m in length, and branching near the base. When it is not climbing on other vegetation or fences, the mass of semi-erect stems forms a shrubby bush. Its narrow, succulent leaves are dull-green with tiny, soft, white teeth along the margins, and it normally flowers from May, through to August. It can easily be distinguished from other species in the genus by its long (45 mm), thin, bright red flowers which appear on multi-branched racemes.Smith, G.F. & Van Wyk, B.-E. 2008. Aloes in Southern Africa. Struik, Cape Town. Detail of Aloiampelos gracilis rosette Distribution Aloiampelos gracilis is naturally restricted to a relatively small area around the city of Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, and extends westwards into the Baviaanskloof mountains. This region is a transition zone in the Cape Floral Kingdom, between the Fynbos vegetation of the Western Cape, and the Albany thickets of the Eastern Cape.http://redlist.sanbi.org/species.php?species=2206-103 Aloiampelos gracilis is adapted to this transitional fynbos, though due to its popularity as an ornamental garden plant it is now also grown in gardens around southern Africa.Reynolds, G.W. 1950. The aloes of Southern Africa. Balkema, Cape Town. Due to its natural vegetation being prone to seasonal fires, this plant has evolved the ability to re-sprout from its rootstock after being burnt. Relatives and subspecies The rare and declining Langeberg rambling-aloe, Aloiampelos decumbens, which grows far to the west in the Langeberg mountains in the Western Cape, is sometimes described as being merely an isolated subspecies of Aloiampelos gracilis.http://www.succulents.co.za/aloes/rambling- aloes/aloe-gracilis.php Aside from A. decumbens, this plant's closest relative is Aloiampelos striatula, a larger and more robust plant that occurs further inland in the Eastern Cape mountains. However Aloiampelos gracilis can easily be distinguished by its erect (rather than recurved) leaves, its sparse, multi-branched racemes of red flowers, and its relatively thinner stem.

It is the only member of the genus Calectasia that is not endemic to Western Australia. Description Calectasia intermedia is a rhizomatous perennial herb growing to a height of about as an undershrub. The rhizome is about long, horizontal and buried about deep and there are no stilt roots. The stems have many side branches and bear leaves with few hairs. Each leaf is about 5.7-16.8 x 0.5-0.8 mm (0.2-0.7 x 0.02-0.03 in) and tapers to a short, sharp point on the end. The base of the petals (strictly tepals) form a tube long, while the outer parts spread outwards to form a blue, papery star-like pattern which does not fade with age. In the centre of the star are six yellow stamens forming a tube which turns orange-brown with age. The thin style extends beyond the stamens. Flowers appear from September to October. Taxonomy and naming Calectasia intermedia is one of eleven species in the genus Calectasia. It was formally described in 1856 by German botanist Otto Wilhelm Sonder, based on plant material collected by Ferdinand von Mueller in the Grampians in Victoria. The description was published in the journal Linnaea: ein Journal f√ºr die Botanik in ihrem ganzen Umfange, oder Beitr√§ge zur Pflanzenkunde. The specific epithet (intermedia) is from the Latin intermedius \\"coming between\\", referring to its apparent intermediate appearance between C. cyanea and C. grandiflora, the only two other species recognised at the time. Distribution and habitat C. intermedia occurs from Bordertown in the far south-eastern corner of South Australia including the Calectasia Conservation Park, east to the Grampians and Little Desert, south- western Victoria. It grows in open Eucalyptus woodland on sandy soil and in heath. Its distribution is sporadic, due to the clearing of its habitat but it is not considered to be at risk.

Plain language avoiding metaphor and set in bleak landscapes results in a dark and morally complex mood, depicting a tension between the apparently still and bland social surface and the murder, misogyny, rape, and racism it depicts as lying underneath. It contrasts with the whodunit style such as the English country house murder mystery. The popularity of Nordic noir has extended to film and television, such as The Killing, The Bridge, Trapped and Bordertown. Origins There are differing views on the origins but most commentators agree that the genre had become well established as a literary genre by the 1990s; Swedish writer Henning Mankell who has sometimes been referred to as \\"the father of Nordic noir\\"Nordic noir author Henning Mankell loses battle with cancer notes that the Martin Beck series of novels by Maj Sj√∂wall and Per Wahl√∂√∂ \\"broke with the previous trends in crime fiction\\" and pioneered a new style: \\"They were influenced and inspired by the American writer Ed McBain. They realized that there was a huge unexplored territory in which crime novels could form the framework for stories containing social criticism.\\"Mankell, Henning (2006). Introduction to Roseanna. HarperCollins. Kerstin Bergman notes that \\"what made Sj√∂wall and Wahl√∂√∂'s novels stand out from previous crime fiction ‚Äì and what made it so influential in the following decades ‚Äì was, above all, the conscious inclusion of a critical perspective on Swedish society.\\"Bergman, Kerstin (2014). Swedish Crime Fiction: The Making of Nordic Noir. Mimesis International. Henning Mankell's books on \\"Kurt Wallander\\" made the genre a mass phenomenon in the 1990s. Norwegian author Karin Fossum's books on \\"Inspector Sejer\\" were also highly influential and widely translated.Barry Forshaw, Nordic Noir: The Pocket Essential Guide to Scandinavian Crime Fiction, Film & TV, Oldcastle Books, 2013 British author Barry Forshaw suggested that Peter H√∏eg's atmospheric novel Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow was \\"massively influential\\" as the true progenitor of the \\"Scandinavian New Wave\\" and, by setting its counter-intuitive heroine in Copenhagen and Greenland, that it inaugurated the current Scandinavian crime writing wave. One critic opines, \\"Nordic crime fiction carries a more respectable cachet... than similar genre fiction produced in Britain or the US\\". Language, heroes and settings are three commonalities in the genre, which features plain, direct writing style without metaphor. The novels are often police procedural, focusing on the monotonous, day-to-day work of police, often involving the simultaneous investigation of several crimes. Examples include The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and its sequels by Stieg Larsson, Henning Mankell's Kurt Wallander detective series, and Maj Sj√∂wall and Per Wahl√∂√∂'s Martin Beck novels. Until the 2010s, the genre had no particular name, but was sometimes referred to descriptively as \\"Nordic crime fiction\\" or \\"Scandinavian crime fiction\\". Within the Nordic countries themselves, this is still the case. The terms \\"Nordic noir\\" and \\"Scandinavian noir\\" are used largely interchangeably in English; whereas Scandinavia consists of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, North Germanic-speaking countries that are linguistically, ethnically and culturally closely related to one another while the Nordic countries are a broader group that also include countries in the traditional Scandinavian sphere of political and cultural influence, such as Finland, which is mainly Finnish- speaking and culturally distinct from Scandinavia. In the English-speaking world, the term \\"Nordic noir\\" was coined by the Scandinavian Department at the University College of London and gained further usage in the British media in the 2010s beginning with the airing of the BBC documentary called the Nordic Noir: the Story of Scandinavian Crime Fiction. The Guardian also referred to The Killing as Nordic noir. These factors underscore that the term is considered typical of a phenomenon seen as uniting the viewpoint of foreign eye towards recognizable Nordic context. Nordic noir remains a foreign term, as it is not used in the Nordic countries. Features Some critics attribute the genre's success to a distinctive and appealing style, \\"realistic, simple and precise... and stripped of unnecessary words\\". Their protagonists are typically morose detectives or ones worn down by cares and far from simply heroic. In this way, the protagonists' lives cast a light on the flaws of society, which are beyond the crime itself. This is associated with how this genre often tackles a murder mystery that is linked with several storylines and themes such as the investigation of the dark underbelly of modern society. This is demonstrated in the case of the Insomnia films, which featured crime- solving linked to the decline of the Nordic welfare state. A description of Nordic noir cited that it is typified by a dimly lit aesthetic, matched by a slow and melancholic pace, as well as multi-layered storylines. It often features a mix of bleak naturalism and disconsolate locations, with a focus on the sense of place where bad things can happen. These were the distinguishing emotions of the series Bordertown, which were further combined with an atmosphere arising from the fear of Russia. The works also owe something to Scandinavia's political system where the apparent equality, social justice, and liberalism of the Nordic model is seen to cover up dark secrets and hidden hatreds. Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy, for example, deals with misogyny and rape, while Henning Mankell's Faceless Killers focuses on Sweden's failure to integrate its immigrant population.Marc Sidwell, \\"Sweden turns the page and Scandinavian noir explains why\\" , City AM, August 28, 2012 Television The term \\"nordic noir\\" is also applied to films and television series in this genre, both adaptations of novels and original screenplays. Notable examples are The Killing, The Bridge, Trapped, Bordertown and Marcella. Critic Boyd Tonkin has suggested that the British but heavily Scandinavian-influenced Shetland Isles and Outer Hebrides have produced authors in an allied, if not precisely identical tradition. Exponents include Ann Cleeves, whose Shetland books have been adapted for television, and Peter May's Lewis Trilogy. The relatively slower narrative pace of UK crime dramas Broadchurch, The Missing and River is also credited to a \\"Scandinavian noir\\" influence. Subtitled original programmes have proven more popular with British audiences. International adaptations such as Sky Television's French/British The Tunnel (adapted from the Swedish/Danish The Bridge) have their own identity whilst retaining a stylistic and thematic affinity with the original series. While American cinema brought the English language movie version of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo to a worldwide audience, receiving plaudits and was a box- office success, the American adaptations such as The Killing have fared less well critically and have proven less popular in terms of audience reaction than original productions, an example being the enduring interest in Arne Dahl's Intercrime series, originally titled The A Team, and its TV adaptations.

These theories hold that sensory systems incorporate information about the statistical properties of the natural world into their design and relate incoming stimuli to this information, rather than analyzing sensory stimulation into its components or features.  Empirical accounts of vision  Visual perception is initiated when objects in the world reflect light rays towards the eye. Most empirical theories of visual perception begin with the observation that stimulation of the retina is fundamentally ambiguous. In empirical accounts, the most commonly proposed mechanism for circumventing this ambiguity is \\"unconscious inference,\\" a term that dates back to Hermann von Helmholtz. According to Hatfield, Ibn al-Haytham was the first to propose that higher-level cognitive processes (\\"judgments\\") could supplement sense perception to lead to an accurate perception of distance, suggesting that these \\"judgments\\" are formally equivalent to syllogisms.Hatfield, Gary. Perception as Unconscious Inference. Accessed from http://repository.upenn.edu/ircs_reports/9/ . Ren√© Descartes extended and refined this account. George Berkeley departed from this tradition, putting forth the new idea that sensory systems, rather than performing logical operations on stimuli to reach veridical conclusions (i.e. these light rays come with certain orientations relative to each other, therefore their source is at a certain distance), make associations. For instance, if certain co- occurring sensory attributes are usually present when an object is at a given distance, an observer would see an object with those attributes as being at that distance. For Helmholtz, Berkeleyan associations form the premises for inductive \\"judgements,\\" in al-Haytham's sense of the term. Helmholtz was one of the first thinkers on the subject to augment his reasoning with detailed knowledge of the anatomy of sensory mechanisms. Helmholtz also collected a lot of knowledge from physiology, experimental psychology, anatomy, and pathology to expand his idea about the anatomy of sensory mechanisms. In current works Helmholtz's use of the term is construed as referring to some mechanism that augments sense impressions with acquired knowledge or through application of heuristics. In general, contemporary empirical theories of perception seek to describe and/or explain the physiological underpinnings of this \\"unconscious inference,\\" particularly in terms of how sensory systems acquire information about general statistical features of their environments (see natural scene statistics) and apply this information to sensory data in order to shape perception. A recurring theme in these theories is that stimulus ambiguity is rectified by a priori knowledge about the natural world. Wholly empirical approach to visual perception The wholly empirical approach to perception, developed by Dale Purves and his colleagues, asserts that percepts are determined solely by evolutionary and individual experience with sensory impressions and the objects from which they derive. The success or failure of behavior in response to these sensory impressions tends to increase the prevalence of neural structures that support some ways of interpreting sensory input while decreasing the prevalence of neural structures that support other ways of interpreting sensory input. This strategy determines qualities of perception in all visual domains and sensory modalities. Accumulating evidence suggests that the perception of color,Perceiving Colour. Lotto RB, Purves D.

Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 127(1): 491-503. (2010). may be determined by empirically derived associations between the sensory patterns humans have always experienced and the relative success of behavior in response to those patterns.  The wholly empirical strategy  The wholly empirical theory of perception differs from other empirical theories by recognizing the severity of the inverse problem in optics. As an example, imagine that three hoses are used to fill a bucket with water. If how much water each hose has contributed is known, it is straightforward to calculate how much water is in the bucket. These kinds of problems are known as ‚Äúforward‚Äù problems, which are easy to solve. But if all that is known is the amount of water in the bucket instead, it is impossible to figure out with just this information how much water came from each hose; it is impossible to work ‚Äúbackwards‚Äù from the bucket to the hoses. This is an example of an inverse problem. Solutions to these problems are rarely possible, although they can sometimes be approximated by imposing assumption-based constraints on the ‚Äúsolution space‚Äù. Navigating the world on the basis of sensory stimulation alone represents an inverse problem in the realm of biology. When light reflected from a linear object falls on the retina, the object in 3-D space is transformed into a two-dimensional line. A distant line can form the same image on the retina as a shorter but close line. It is impossible to work backwards to know the real distance, length, and orientation of the source of the projected line. Despite this fact, observers usually manage to behave effectively in response to sensory stimulation. The inverse optics problem presents a quandary for traditional approaches to perception. Advocates of feature detection (known today as neural filtering) propose that the visual system performs logical computations on retinal inputs to determine higher-level aspects of a perceptual scene such as contrast, contour, shape and color percepts. Given the inverse problem, it is hard to imagine how these computations would be useful as they would have little or nothing to do with properties of the real world. Empirical approaches to perception propose that the only way for organisms to successfully overcome the inverse problem is to exploit their long and varied past experience with the real world. The wholly empirical approach states that this experience is the sole determinant of perceptual qualities. It asserts that the reason observers see an object as dark or light is that in both the individual's past and the past of the species it was advantageous to see it in that manner.  Color  Color vision is dependent on activation of three cone cell types in the human retina, each of which is primarily responsive to a different spectrum of light frequencies. While these retinal mechanisms enable subsequent color processing, their properties alone cannot account for the full range of color perception phenomena. In part this is because illuminance (the amount of light shining on an object), reflectance (the amount of light an object is predisposed to reflect), and transmittance (the extent to which the light medium distorts the light as it travels) are conflated in the retinal image. This is problematic because, if color vision is to be useful, it must somehow guide behavior in line with these properties. Even so, the visual system only has access to retinal input, which does not distinguish the relative contributions of each of these factors to the final light spectra that stimulate the retina. According to the empirical framework, the visual system solves this problem by drawing on species and individual experience with retinal images that have signified different combinations of illuminance, reflectance, and transmittance in the past. Only those associations that led to appropriate behavior were retained through evolution and development, leading to a repertoire of neural associations and predispositions that ground color perception in the world. Simultaneous color contrast. The smaller squares are identical in color but look different depending on context. One way to test this idea is to see if the frequency of co-occurrence of light spectra predicts simultaneous color contrast effects. Fuhui Long and PurvesNatural scene statistics as the universal basis for color context effects. Long F, Purves D. Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences 100(25): 15190-15193. (2003). showed that by sampling thousands of natural images, analysis of associations between target colors and the colors of their surrounds could explain perceptual effects like those seen on the right. Rather than explaining the diverging color percepts as unfortunate byproducts of a normally veridical color perception mechanism, the different colors humans see are simply the byproducts of the species' and the individual's exposure to the distribution of color spectra in the world.  Brightness  The checker shadow illusion. Squares A and B are identical in luminance returns but look differently bright depending on context. ‚Äô‚ÄôBrightness‚Äô‚Äô refers to a subjective sense that the object considered is emitting light. Whereas the perceptual correlates of color are the frequencies of light that compose the light spectrum, the perceptual correlate of brightness is luminance (the intensity of light emitted by an object). While it may seem obvious that the sensation of brightness is straightforwardly related to the amount or intensity of light coming to the eyes, researchers studying perception have long known that brightness is not caused solely by the luminance incident on the retina.Fechner G.T., Adler, H.E., Howes, D.H. & Boring, E.G., (1966) Elements of Psychophysics (Holt Rinehart and Winston, New York). A common example is simultaneous brightness contrast (shown to the right), in which the two identical target diamonds appear to have different brightnesses. In the empirical account, the same general framework used to rationalize simultaneous color contrast applies to simultaneous brightness contrast. The visual system associates luminance values and their given contexts with the success or failure of ensuing behavior, leading to percepts that often (but only incidentally) reflect properties of objects rather than their associated images. The checker shadow illusion strongly supports this view of how brightness perception works. Although other frameworks have either no explanation for this effect or explanations that are highly inconsistent with their explanations for similar effects, the empirical framework supports that the perceived brightness differences are due to empirical associations between the targets and their respective contexts. In this case, because the ‚Äúlighter‚Äù targets would typically have been shadowed, humans perceive them in a way that is consistent with their having a higher reflectance despite their presumably low levels of illuminance. This approach is considerably different from computational ‚Äúcontext‚Äù-driven approaches, as the target/context relationships are contingent and world-based, and therefore cannot be generalized to other cases in any meaningful way.  Line length  Perception of line length is confounded by another optical inverse problem: the further away a line is from the observer, the smaller the projected line will be on the retina. Different orientations of a line relative to the observer may obscure true line length as well. Straight lines are erroneously reported as longer or shorter as a function of their angular orientation, as demonstrated by the vertical‚Äìhorizontal illusion. While no generally accepted explanations of this phenomenon have been offered previously, the empirical approach has had some success in explaining the effect as a function of the distribution of lines in natural scenes.Howe and Purves (2002). PNAS 99(20): 13184-13188. Catherine Howe and Purves (2002) analyzed natural scene photographs to find projected lines that corresponded to straight line sources. They found that the ratios of the actual length of the lines to the projected lines on the retina, when classified by their respective orientations on the retina, almost perfectly matched subjective estimation of line length as a function of angle relative to the observer. For example, horizontal lines on the retinal image typically have turned out to issue from relatively short physical sources, while lines at about 60 degrees relative to the observer typically have signified longer physical sources, which explains why individuals tend to see a line at 60 degrees as longer than a horizontal line. While there is no way for the visual system to know this a priori, the fact that it seems to take this knowledge for granted in its construction of length estimation percepts strongly supports the wholly empirical view of perception.  Motion  Perception of motion is also confounded by an inverse problem: movement in three-dimensional space does not map perfectly onto movement on the retinal plane. A distant object moving at a given speed will translate more slowly on the retina than a nearby object moving at the same speed. As mentioned previously, size, distance, and orientation are also ambiguous given only the retinal image. As with other aspects of perception, empirical theorists propose that this problem is solved by trial-and-error experience with moving stimuli, their associated retinal images, and the consequences of behavior. One way to test this hypothesis is to determine if it can explain the flash lag illusion, a visual effect in which a flash superimposed on a moving bar is falsely seen to lag behind the bar. The task for empirical theorists is to explain why individuals perceive the flash in this way and why the perceived lag increases with the speed of the moving bar. To investigate this question, William Wojtach and his team simulated a three- dimensional environment full of moving virtual particles.An empirical explanation of the flash-lag effect. Wojtach W.T., Sung K., Truong S., Purves D. (2008) Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences 105(2): 16338-16343. They modeled the transformation from three dimensions to the two- dimensional image plane and tallied up the frequency of occurrence of particle speeds, particle distances, image speeds, and image distances, where image means the path projected across the computer-modeled ‚Äúretina‚Äù. The probability distributions they obtained predicted the magnitude of the bar-flash disparity well. The authors concluded that the flash-lag effect was a signature of the way brains evolve and develop to behave appropriately in response to moving retinal images.

This democratic organization, whose directions are set in the general meetings of its members, is administered by a board of directors made up of the presidents of the 14 regional boards. Affiliated with the Union des producteurs agricoles (UPA), the PLQ works to defend and promote the general interests of its members. The some 6,000 dairy farms in Quebec collectively market nearly 3 billion litres of milk through the Joint Plan (1980) of Quebec milk producers. Producers have delegated the PLQ with the responsibility of negotiating all sales conditions with processor representatives on their behalf. Producers and processors negotiate and work together through marketing agreements and various related committees on the issues of plant supplies, milk quality rules and raw material prices. The prices are negotiated on the basis of a Canadian target price that takes into account the most efficient producers‚Äô costs. Since the costs of transporting milk from farms to plants are assumed by milk producers, Les Producteurs de lait du Qu√©bec also negotiate these conditions with processors under a provincial agreement. Historic Milk producers joined forces in 1983 within the 'F√©d√©ration des producteurs de lait du Qu√©bec (FPLQ), a federation of 14 syndicates that included two federations: the fluid milk producers (1970) and the industrial milk producers (1966). On May 1, 2014, the F√©d√©ration des producteurs de lait du Qu√©bec became Les Producteurs de lait du Qu√©bec. Out of concern for a lighter administrative load and consistency with their provincial joint marketing plan, the 14 regional syndicates and the Federation disbanded to form a single legal entity. It went from a federation of 14 member syndicates to one single organization where all producers are direct members. Due to this transformation, it was necessary to change the name. The mission of Les Producteurs de lait du Qu√©bec is still to represent and collectively market the milk of all milk producers, and its structure is still set up for regional representation, but it is now based on the new UPA territories. The new organization, Les Producteurs de lait du Qu√©bec, is appropriately named since the some 6,000 dairy farms in Quebec are now its direct members.

It is situated north-east of Carnoustie and west of Arbroath. Panbride Kirk Etymology The name Panbride may be Pictish in origin, and derived from the element *pant meaning \\"a hollow\\". History The first recorded owners of the Barony of Panbride was the Morham family, whose ancestral name was Malherbe. They are first mentioned in relation to Panbride in the registers of Arbroath Abbey in a charter of John Morham made in the mid 13th century. It is thought that they had possession of the land until 1309 when Robert I conferred the land to his Brother in Law, Alexander Fraser, Lord Chamberlain of Scotland. Fraser died at the Battle of Dupplin Moor in 1332 and it is thought that David II conferred the barony (at least in part) to the Boyce family in 1341. The lands of Panbride were fragmented and passed through a number of hands from that point, and were gradually acquired by the Carnegie family, later to become the Earls of Northesk, in the 16th century. The lands were forfeited following the Jacobite rebellion but were bought back by James Carnegie in 1764. Carnegie used the lands to purchase lands near his main estate and the barony of Panbride passed to William Maule, linking Panbride with Panmure. Panbride church's minister in 1717 was father of the next minister who was the father of the next - and he was the father of Rev. David Trail who was also the minister. A record for one family in the church of Scotland. David Trail died in 1850 but his daughter Ann Agnes Trail went on to found a convent in Edinburgh. Between the census years of 1801 and 1831, the parish's population fell by some 20% from 1583 to 1268, due largely to the removal of several villages in the name of Agricultural improvement.

Biography Marianne Baillie was born Marianne Wathen to the English actor George Wathen (1762‚Äì1849) and Marianne Norford,Bury St. Edminds, St. James parish records, baptisms 1558‚Äì1800, (1915), Suffolk Green Books, Paul & Matthew, London, p. 403Guy of Warwick, &c.;, 1817, pp. 42, 43, and 64 daughter of Dr. William Norford (1715‚Äì1793). She married Mr. Alexander Baillie \\"some years previous\\" to 1817.Guy of Warwick, pp. 47, 66, and 72 Her brother Augustus Wathen (1796‚Äì1844) married Elizabeth Jane Leslie, daughter of the Earl of Rothes. Mrs. Baillie's first contribution to literature was a small volume, entitled Guy of Warwick, a Legende, and other Poems, Kingsbury, 1817. A very limited edition was printed by Mr. Baillie at his private printing- press, and, in 1818, a second edition was in demand. Some of the poems in this work were afterwards reproduced in a volume privately printed in London in 1825, and \\"not published\\", entitled Trifles in Verse. The preface is written by Mr. Baillie, who says that after the year 1817 \\"hard times came\\". Early in 1818, the Baillies found a \\"shelter\\" and a \\"calm retreat\\" at Twickenham, where they received kindness from Lady Howe, whose second husband, Sir Wathen Waller, would seem to have been a relative of Mrs. Baillie. It was from Twickenham that the Baillies set out for a continental tour, crossing the Channel from Dover to Calais on 9 August 1818, and returning 8 October following. The literary result of this journey appeared in a volume inscribed by the author to the Right Hon. John Trevor, who had been British minister at Turin from 1783 to 1798; of whom Mrs. Baillie spoke after his death as a \\"paternal friend\\".Trifles in Verse, pp. 40 and 41 The title of the volume was First Impressions on a Tour upon the Continent in the Summer of 1818, through Parts of France, Italy, Switzerland, the Borders of Germany, and a Part of French Flanders, 8vo, London, 1819. In the same year Mrs. Baillie wrote a poetical Farewell to Twickenham. After spending some time in Devonshire, she entered in June 1820 upon a residence of about two years and a half in Portugal. There she wrote a series of letters to her mother, afterwards published, with an inscription to the Earl of Chichester, \\"to whose kindness they owe their existence,\\" in two volumes, entitled Lisbon in the Years 1821, 1822, and 1823, 8vo, London, 1824; second edition 1825. Several of her poems, published first in her letters, and afterwards in Trifles in Verse, describe the beauties of Cintra. The Baillies returned to England in October 1823, and settled in London. Mrs. Baillie died in 1831.

On 27 June 2015, Pope Francis named him the Prefect of the newly established Secretariat for Communications. He was expected to give greater prominence to new media and decrease the significance of the Vatican's radio and print operations. He predicted the reorganization of existing departments would be \\"tear-inducing\\" for some of the 650 employees affected as duplicate processes were eliminated and greater coordination introduced. He also encountered institutional rivalries both within his departments and in other parts of the Roman Curia.

Naming and classification Aloe perfoliata was formerly known as Aloe mitriformis. The physical appearance of this aloe varies greatly depending on environment, and consequently various sub-populations have previously often been mistaken for being separate species. The South African National Biodiversity Institute now recognizes that these are all members of the same species, Aloe perfoliata, comprising what were previously known as Aloe mitriformis, Aloe distans, Aloe comptonii, Aloe albispina and Aloe flavispina among others. This species is the most widespread of a group of closely related \\"Creeping Aloes\\" (Mitriformes), including the cliff-hanging aloes A. meyeri and A. dabenorisana(stemless), as well as spotted Aloe arenicola of the South African west coast and the unusual Aloe pearsonii of the Richtersveld desert. Appearance Rubble Aloes growing down a cliff-face in the Western Cape In their natural habitat, these aloes have long, prostrate, branching stems of up to 2 meters. Instead of growing upright, they tend to sprawl along the ground and over rocks. While most of the plant lies along the ground, the terminal leaf-bearing head is often erect, facing upwards to the sun. The leaf margins are armed with harmless, little white teeth. The Rubble Aloe is extremely variable-looking, depending on its environment, making it difficult to identify sometimes. Plants growing in full sun develop tightly arranged bluish leaves, while those in the shade have more widely spaced green leaves. During dry conditions, the leaves assume a red colour. The thick, fleshy leaves often curve inwards during times of drought ‚Äì making the rosette look rather like a mitre (until recently this species was known as Aloe mitriformis because of this resemblance). The rubble aloe flowers profusely in summer Unlike most aloes, which flower in winter, the Rubble Aloe flowers in summer. The red flowers appear on stalks, which (befitting the variable nature of this species) vary from being rounded to being cone-shaped. Distribution Aloe perfoliata is indigenous to the Western Cape and some adjacent areas in the Northern and Eastern Cape of South Africa. Here it typically occurs in mountainous rocky Fynbos, overflowing into neighboring Karoo and Albany Thicket vegetation.Raimondo, D., von Staden, L., Foden, W., Victor, J. E., Helme, N. A., Turner, R. C., Kamundi, D. A. and Manyama, P. A. 2009. Red List of South African Plants. Strelitzia 25. South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria. They are usually found in groups among rubble and rocky outcrops (hence their Afrikaans name, \\"Puin Aalwyn\\", or \\"Rubble Aloe\\"), growing in clay or sandy soil. These resilient plants tend to prefer flat, rocky places but it is not uncommon to see them hanging on vertical cliff faces. Subspecies * A. perfoliata subsp. mitriformis: Occurs from Nieuwoudtville as far as Montagu. * A. perfoliata subsp. comptonii: Occurs from Montagu in the west, as far as Uitenhage in the east. Plants relatively more compact, large and stemless, with elongated green to blue-ish leaves. * A. perfoliata subsp. distans: Occurs around Saldanha in the Western Cape. Smaller, faster-growing plants with spotted green leaves on their long rambling stems.

Cultivation A very tough and compact species, it can be grown on embankments, rocky slopes and walls, and it easily survives through both very hot summers and snow in the winter. These aloes are also used in arid gardens as they flower in the summer (unlike most aloes), but require full sun for maximum flowering. The species can easily be propagated by taking stem cuttings, dried for a day or two and planted in sand. Aloe \\"nobilis\\" hybrid A hybrid, of Aloe perfoliata with Aloe brevifolia, is very commonly used in landscaping around the world, and is often nicknamed \\"Aloe nobilis\\". It is frequently confused with Aloe perfoliata itself, but the \\"nobilis\\" hybrid is a much smaller plant, and has much smaller rosettes. It is usually a light green colour.D. L.

Mikulich ()Nikolaev and L. Chernavina (). Biography Veselitskaya was born in 1857 into a military family in Yegoryevsk. Her father was an instructor of the Alexander Cadet Corps. She was educated at the Pavlovsk Institute, where she studied teaching, graduating in 1874. She then enrolled in the Saint Petersburg pedagogical courses, graduating in 1876. She married a Russian Army officer soon after graduating. Her first literary efforts were simple tales for young people, including In the Family and In the School, Family Evenings, and Of Children's Reading.Wright p. vii She published her first novel Mimi's Marriage in the journal The Herald of Europe in 1883. She attained the height of her popularity with the publication in 1891 of Mimi at the Springs, set in the Caucasus. Leo Tolstoy, commenting on what C. Hagberg Wright called \\"the penetrating and pitiless\\" analysis of Mimi's character, said that \\"The author must be a man, as no woman would be so frank in writing of her own sex.\\"Wright p. viii Nikolai Leskov said of the novel \\"a tale... fresh, alive and very relevant... the manner of writing is extremely skillful and pleasant.\\" The last novel in the trilogy, Mimi Poisons Herself appeared in 1893, also published in The Herald of Europe.Wright p. xiii Veselitskaya's personal life wasn't happy; she suffered through the divorce of her parents and the subsequent break-up of her family. This apparently caused her to pay keen attention to the subject of women's lives, domestic conflict and turmoil, and the relationships of men and women. Many of her stories lacked depth, but she published several truthful and impressive short works written under the influence of Leo Tolstoy and his philosophy, dealing with the terrible suffering of the poor and other manifestations of social injustice. In the first two decades of the 20th century she occasionally published short stories and novellas, but after 1917, she withdrew from literary work and turned increasingly to making translations. She translated the works of Alphonse Daudet, Victor Hugo, and others. As a young woman she met with Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Vsevolod Garshin. She later collaborated with the editors of Severny Vestnik, Liubov Gurevich and A. Volynsky. She had a friendly relationship with Nikolai Leskov, and visited Leo Tolstoy at his home in Moscow, which was located close to hers, and was friendly with his daughters and his personal friends Vladimir Chertkov, and others, and his biographer Pavel Biryukov. She didn't agree with Tolstoy's religious views, but shared his socio-critical views. She produced a considerable body of works including the Mimi trilogy, novellas, short stories, translations, and literary memoirs. Her autobiographical book Meetings with Writers, published in 1929, tells of her friendships with Tolstoy and others. She spent her last years living in the town of Pushkin, where she taught music at a school for orphans.  English translations  *Mimi's Marriage, (novel), T.

Raging Fighter plays similarly to other 2D versus fighting games during its release, which the player's character fights against his or her opponent in best two-out-of- three matches in a single player tournament mode with the computer or against another human player. However, unlike most modern-fighting games released at the time, instead of three to six buttons like in most other modern-fighting games, there are two buttons: one for punching, the other for kicking. Depending on what direction the player presses when he or she punches or kicks, the player can throw a different punch or kick with different properties that would be useful in different situations. For instance, if the player is crouching, he or she has three low kicks to utilize. This was a method Konami used to seriously make the most out of the Game Boy's two buttons. There are four different game modes: Practice, Story, Tournament and Versus. There are also seven playable characters, each individually rated in strength, speed, defense, mobility, and endurance. An in-game meter can be filled out in the one-player tournament mode by not using long-range moves against the opponents.

Virgin Mary on the wall of the Vallibona main church honoring the traditional bonds between the towns of Vallibona (Valencian Community) and Pena-roja (Pe√±arroya de Tastavins) over the hills in Matarranya, Aragon. Ilercavonia (, ) is an ancient comarca of Spain formerly populated by the ancient Iberian tribe known as Ilercavones. It is a greater comarca made up of smaller ones. The ties between the people of the region transcend ancient kingdom and later provincial borders. History The name 'Ilercavonia' to refer to the territory occupied by the Ilercavones Iberian tribe appears in ancient Greek and Roman texts and documents.Mem√≤ria de la prospecci√≥ arqueol√≤gica l/110kv Asc√≥ - SE Tortosa The northern limits of this territory were in Serra de la Llena, the northeastern in Coll de Balaguer, the western in Mequinensa and the southern in the area of a river mentioned as 'Oduba' in Roman documents, which could be either the Millars River, or another river further south along the coast closer to Sagunt. This geographical zone corresponds roughly to the present-day Maestrat/Maestrazgo, Matarra√±a/Matarranya and Terres de l'Ebre comarcas. During the Middle Ages the territory of Ilercavonia found itself located at the confluence of the kingdoms of Valencia, Catalonia and Aragon. Since that time, and until the mid-20th century, the Diocese of Tortosa would give a certain basic recognition to the people of this ancient region who, despite having had no historic political representation of their own, share common geographic, economic, cultural and linguistic ties. The traditional Aragonese parishes of the Diocese of Tortosa, however, were segregated during General Franco's dictatorship, following the Concordat of 1953 between the Francoist regime and the Vatican.Stanley G. Payne, Franco's Spain, London 1968 Besides the lack of recognition and effective representation, this greater comarca has suffered much from a lack of development and investment since the mid-20th century, when the only railway line connecting the region with Aragon, the RENFE line from Tortosa to Alca√±iz and Zaragoza, was terminated in 1973.El Punt - El cruel divorci entre Tortosa i el tren This line was dismantled as a result of a 1962 World Bank report advising the Spanish State to concentrate investment in the great lines and to abandon the less profitable railways connecting rural areas. The bulk of the development in eastern and northeastern Spain was henceforward diverted to the cities of Barcelona and Valencia in detriment of this region.

A History of Ancient Tenures of Land in North Wales and the Marches, 2nd ed, 1910, p.245 Much of the village dates from the later 19th century, after industrial expansion in the area, but it appears on the 1873 Ordnance Survey of Denbighshire as \\"Pentre\\" and \\"Pentre isaf\\" (\\"lower village\\"). These place names, rather than \\"Pentre Broughton\\", appear on maps until the second half of the 20th century, and the village is still often referred to simply as \\"Pentre\\" by local residents. Pentre Broughton's church, St. Paul's, was built in 1888-89, though it was not consecrated until 1909, shortly before Broughton was made a separate parish in its own right.Broughton, St. Paul, GENUKI The church was designed by the architect Howel Davies of Wrexham.St Paul's, Broughton, Church Plans Online Many of the villages' residents worked in coal mining, or in the Brymbo Steelworks which until its closure in 1990 dominated the view to the north of the village.

The Constitution was thoroughly planned by several government officers and agencies over a period of almost seven years amid increasing democratic reforms in Bhutan. The current Constitution is based on Buddhist philosophy, international Conventions on Human Rights, comparative analysis of 20 other modern constitutions, public opinion, and existing laws, authorities, and precedents. According to Princess Sonam Wangchuck, the constitutional committee was particularly influenced by the Constitution of South Africa because of its strong protection of human rights. Background On 4 September 2001, King Jigme Singye Wangchuck briefed the Lhengye Zhungtshog (Council of Ministers, or Cabinet), the Chief Justice, and the Chairman of the Royal Advisory Council on the need to draft a formal Constitution for the Kingdom of Bhutan. The King expressed his desire that the Lhengye Zhungtshog and the Chief Justice should hold discussions on formulating the Draft Constitution. While Bhutan did not have a formal Constitution, the King believed all the principles and provisions of a Constitution were covered under the various written laws and legislation which guided the actions of the King and the functioning of the Royal Government, the judiciary and the National Assembly of Bhutan. Nevertheless, with the country and the people having successfully achieved a high level of development and political maturity, the time had come for a formal Constitution for the Kingdom of Bhutan. Royal Government of Bhutan appointed Indian constitutional lawyer K. K. Venugopal to serve as the Constitutional adviser for drafting of the Constitution of Bhutan. The King emphasized that the Constitution must promote and protect the present as well as the future well-being of the people and the country. He stated the Constitution must ensure that Bhutan had a political system that would provide peace and stability, and also strengthen and safeguard Bhutan's security and sovereignty. The King decided the Lhengye Zhungtshog should, therefore, establish a committee to draft the Constitution for the Kingdom of Bhutan. The King said that the Drafting Committee should comprise government officials, National Assembly members, and eminent citizens who were well qualified, had a good understanding of the laws of Bhutan, and who would be able to contribute towards drafting the Constitution. On November 30, 2001, the King inaugurated the outset of its drafting with a ceremony. By 2005, the Royal Government had circulated copies of the draft among the civil service and local governments in order to receive locals' feedback. Provisions of the Constitution of Bhutan The provisions of the Constitution of Bhutan appear below, grouped into thematic order for the convenience of the reader. Government of Bhutan under the 2008 Constitution Basic provisions The Constitution defines the Kingdom of Bhutan as a democratic constitutional monarchy belonging to the people of the Kingdom. The territory of Bhutan is divided into 20 Dzongkhags (Districts) with each consisting of Gewogs (Counties) and Thromdes (Municipalities). Dzongkha is the national language of Bhutan, and the National Day of Bhutan is December 17.Constitution of Bhutan , Art. 1 The Constitution is the supreme law of the State and affirms the authority of legal precedent: > All laws in force in the territory of Bhutan at the time of adopting this > Constitution continues until altered, repealed or amended by Parliament. > However, the provisions of any law, whether made before or after the coming > into force of this Constitution, which are inconsistent with this > Constitution, shall be null and void. The Supreme Court of Bhutan is the guardian of the Constitution and the final authority on its interpretation. Rights over natural resources vest in the State and are thus properties of the State and regulated by law. Throughout the Constitution, retirement is mandated for most civil servants upon reaching age 65. Notably, this includes the reigning King whenever possible.Constitution of Bhutan , Art. 2 The monarchy and the royal family Reigning Monarch Druk Gyalpo Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck The Constitution confirms the institution of monarchy. The Druk Gyalpo (King of Bhutan) is the Head of State and the symbol of unity of the Kingdom and of the people of Bhutan. The Constitution establishes the \\"Chhoe-sid-nyi\\" (dual system of religion and politics) of Bhutan as unified in the person of the King who, as a Buddhist, is the upholder of the Chhoe-sid (religion and politics; temporal and secular). In addition, the King is the protector of all religions in Bhutan.Constitution of Bhutan , Art. 3 The King is also the Supreme Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces and the Militia of Bhutan. The King is not answerable in a court of law for his actions, and his person is sacrosanct. However, the King is mandated to protect and uphold the Constitution \\"in the best interest and for the welfare of the people of Bhutan.\\" Furthermore, there are Constitutional provisions for involuntary abdication in the event the King violates the Constitution. The Constitution entitles the King and the royal family to annuities from the State in accordance with law made by Parliament; all rights and privileges including the provision of palaces and residences for official and personal use; and exemption from taxation on the royal annuity and properties. The Constitution also limits the membership of the royal family to reigning and past Monarchs, their Queens and their Royal Children born of lawful marriage. Article 2 Section 26 states that Parliament may make no laws nor exercise its powers to amend the provisions regarding the monarchy and Bhutan's government as a \\"Democratic Constitutional Monarchy\\" except through a national referendum. =Royal prerogatives= Under the Constitution, the King, in exercise of his Royal Prerogatives (and as Head of State), promotes goodwill and good relations with other countries by receiving state guests and undertaking state visits to other countries. The King may also award titles, decorations, dar for Lhengye and Nyi-Kyelma (conferring a red scarf of rank and honour with the title of \\"Dasho\\") in accordance with tradition and custom. Also among the Royal Prerogatives are the grants of citizenship, amnesty, pardon and reduction of sentences; and land \\"kidu\\" and other \\"kidus\\" (benefits). The King may, by Royal Prerogative, command bills and other measures to be introduced in Parliament. Furthermore, bills of Parliament are ultimately subject to veto and modification by the King, however he must assent to bills resubmitted after joint sitting and deliberation. The King may also exercise powers \\"relating to matters which are not provided for under this Constitution or other laws.\\" =Succession and retirement= Druk Gyalpo Ugyen Wangchuck, founder of the Wangchuck Dynasty The Constitution establishes the law of succession of the Golden Throne of Bhutan. Under this Section, title to the throne vests in the legitimate descendants of King Ugyen Wangchuck, enshrined on December 17, 1907. Title may pass only to children born of lawful marriage, by hereditary succession to direct lineal descendants in order of seniority upon the abdication or demise of the King. Article 2 Section 6 provides that upon reaching age 65, the King must retire (abdicate) in favor of the Crown Prince or Crown Princess, provided the royal heir has reached age 21. There is a stated preference that a prince take precedence over a princess, however this is subject to the exception that if there are \\"shortcomings in the elder prince, it is the sacred duty of the King to select and proclaim the most capable prince or princess as heir to the Throne.\\" Title to the throne may also pass to the child of the Queen who is pregnant at the time of the demise of the King if no lineal heir exists. Such is an example of semi-Salic law. If there are no present or prospective lineal heirs, title passes to the nearest collateral line of the descendants of the King in accordance with the principle of lineal descent, with preference being given for elder over the younger. Title may never pass to children incapable of exercising the Royal Prerogatives by reason of physical or mental infirmity, nor to anyone whose spouse is a person other than a natural born citizen of Bhutan. The successor to the Throne receives dar (a scarf that symbolizes the conferring of rank) from the Machhen (the holy relic) of Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal at Punakha Dzong, and is crowned on the Golden Throne. Upon the ascension of the King to the Throne, the members of the royal family, the members of Parliament, and the holders of offices requiring appointment by the King must take an oath of allegiance to the King. Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, the unifier of Bhutan =Regency= The Constitution provides a procedural framework for a Council of Regency. A Council of Regency is established when the King has temporarily relinquished, by Proclamation, the exercise of the Royal Prerogatives; or when it has been resolved by at least ¬æ of the total number of members of Parliament in a joint sitting that the King is unable to exercise the Royal Prerogatives by reason of temporary physical or mental infirmity; or the King abdicates or dies and the successor to the throne has not attained the age 21. These provisions are effective until the royal heir presumptive reaches age 21 and becomes Regent by right. When the successor to the throne reaches age 21, or when the King resumes the exercise of the Royal Prerogatives, notice must be given by Proclamation. However, when the King regains the ability to exercise the Royal Prerogatives, notice is given to that effect by resolution of Parliament. The Council of Regency collectively exercises the Royal Prerogatives and the powers vested in the King. The Council of Regency is composed of 6 members: one senior member of the royal family nominated by the Privy Council (below), the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice of Bhutan, the Speaker, the Chairperson of the National Council, and the leader of the Opposition Party. =Privy Council= The Constitution establishes a Privy Council of four persons, consisting of two members appointed by the King, one member nominated by the Lhengye Zhungtshog (Council of Ministers), and one member nominated by the National Council. The Privy Council is responsible for: all matters pertaining to the privileges and conduct of the King and the royal family; rendering advice to the King on matters concerning the Throne and the royal family; all matters pertaining to crown properties; and any other matter as may be commanded by the King. =Royal appointments= Under Article 2 Section 19, the King appoints a significant number of high-level Government officers: Judicial appointees, the Auditor General, and the Chairs of Anti-Corruption, Civil Service, and Election Commissions are holders of Constitutional Office. The King appoints most of the upper Judicial branch: the Chief Justice of Bhutan and the Drangpons (Associate Justices) of the Supreme Court; the Chief Justice and Drangpons (Associate Justices) of the High Court. These judicial appointments are made from among the vacant positions' peers, juniors, and available eminent jurists in consultation with the National Judicial Commission (below). Dungkhag Court jurists are not appointed by the King. The King also appoints, from lists of names recommended jointly by the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice of Bhutan, the Speaker, the Chairperson of the National Council, and the Leader of the Opposition Party, four kinds of high-level Government: the Chief Election Commissioner and other members of the Election Commission; the Auditor General of the Royal Audit Authority; the Chairperson and other members of the Royal Civil Service Commission; and the Chairperson and other members of the Anti-Corruption Commission. The term for each position is 5 years. Referenced for incorporation are the Bhutanese Audit Act, Bhutanese Civil Service Act, Bhutanese Anti-Corruption Act, and Attorney General Act; references to existing Election Laws also appear throughout the Constitution. The King appoints positions other than Constitutional Officers on the advice of other bodies. He appoints the heads of the Defence Forces from a list of names recommended by the Service Promotion Board. The King appoints the Attorney General of Bhutan, the Chairperson of the Pay Commission, the Governor of the Central Bank of Bhutan, the Cabinet Secretary, and Bhutanese ambassadors and consuls on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. The King also appoints Dzongdags to head Local Governments, and other secretaries to the Government on the recommendation of the Prime Minister who obtains nominations from the Royal Civil Service Commission on the basis of merit and seniority and in accordance with other relevant rules and regulations. The King appoints the Secretary General of the respective Houses on the recommendation of the Royal Civil Service Commission. The King also appoints the Je Khenpo (below) as the spiritual leader of Bhutan. Finally, as indicated above, the King appoints 2 of the 4 members of the Privy Council. =Voluntary and involuntary abdication= The Constitution provides substantive and procedural law for two paths of abdication for reigning monarchs: voluntary and involuntary. As stated above, the King may relinquish the exercise of Royal Prerogatives, and such relinquishment may be temporary. The Constitution provides that the King must abdicate the throne for willful violations of the Constitution or for suffering permanent mental disability. Either must be upon a motion passed by a joint sitting of Parliament. The motion for abdication must be tabled for discussion at a joint sitting of Parliament (presided by the Chief Justice of Bhutan) if at least ‚Öî of the total number of the members of Parliament submits such a motion stating its basis and grounds. The King may respond to the motion in writing or by addressing the joint sitting of Parliament in person or through a representative. If, at such joint sitting of Parliament, at least ¬æ of the total number of members of Parliament passes the motion for abdication, then such a resolution is placed before the people in a National Referendum to be approved or rejected. If the National Referendum passes in all the Dzongkhags in the Kingdom, the King must abdicate in favour of the heir apparent. Heritage of BhutanBuddhism= Bhutanese Buddhist monk looking out of the window of a monastery. The Constitution states that Buddhism is the spiritual heritage of Bhutan. Buddhism is described as promoting the principles and values of peace, non-violence, compassion and tolerance. The Constitution places upon religious institutions and personalities the responsibility to promote the spiritual heritage of Bhutan while also ensuring that religion remains separate from politics in Bhutan. Religious institutions and personalities are explicitly required to remain above politics. The sole Constitutional exception is the King under the Chhoe- sid-nyi (dual system of religion and politics). Thus, while religion and politics are officially separate, the Buddhist Drukpa Lineage is the state religion of Bhutan. The King appoints the Je Khenpo on the recommendation of the Five Lopons (teachers). The Je Khenpo must be a learned and respected monk ordained in accordance with the Druk-lu tradition, having the nine qualities of a spiritual master and accomplished in ked-dzog. The Je Khenpo appoints, on the recommendation of the Dratshang Lhentshog (Commission for the Monastic Affairs), the Five Lopons from among monks with the nine qualities of a spiritual master and accomplished in ked-dzog (stages of development and completion in Vajrayana practice). The membership of the Dratshang Lhentshog comprises 7 people: the Je Khenpo as Chairman; the Five Lopons of the Zhung Dratshang (Central Monastic Body); and the Secretary of the Dratshang Lhentshog who is a civil servant. The Zhung Dratshang and Rabdeys (monastic bodies in the dzongs other than Punakha and Thimphu) are to receive adequate funds and other facilities from the State. =Culture of Bhutan= Pungtang Dechen Photrang Dzong and the Mo Chhu The Constitution codifies Bhutanese culture in legal terms. The State must endeavour to preserve, protect and promote the cultural heritage of the country, including monuments, places and objects of artistic or historic interest, Dzongs (fortresses), Lhakhangs (monasteries), Goendeys (monastic communities), Ten-sum (sacred images, scriptures, and stupas), Nyes (sacred pilgrimage sites), language, literature, music, visual arts and religion to enrich society and the cultural life of the citizens. It must also recognize culture as an evolving dynamic force and endeavour to strengthen and facilitate the continued evolution of traditional values and institutions that are sustainable as a progressive society. The State must conserve and encourage research on \\"local\\" arts, custom, knowledge and culture.Constitution of Bhutan , Art. 4 The Constitution allows Parliament to enact any such legislation as may be necessary to advance the cause of the cultural enrichment of Bhutanese society. Satellite image of Bhutan in April 2002 Article 5 pertains to the environment. The Constitution states that every Bhutanese is a trustee of the Kingdom's natural resources and environment for the benefit of the present and future generations and declares it the fundamental duty of every citizen to contribute to protection, conservation, and prevention of all forms of ecological degradation including noise, visual and physical pollution. This Article mandates the adoption and support of environment friendly practices and policies.Constitution of Bhutan , Art. 5 The Government itself pledges to protect, conserve and improve the pristine environment and safeguard the biodiversity of the country; prevent pollution and ecological degradation; secure ecologically balanced sustainable development while promoting justifiable economic and social development; and ensure a safe and healthy environment. To this end, it promises that a minimum of 60 percent of Bhutan's total land shall be maintained as forest for all time. Parliament may enact environmental legislation to ensure sustainable use of natural resources, maintain intergenerational equity, and reaffirm the sovereign rights of the State over its own biological resources. Parliament may also declare any part of the country to be a National Park, Wildlife Reserve, Nature Reserve, Protected Forest, Biosphere Reserve, Critical Watershed and such other categories meriting protection. Citizenship The Constitution provides three categories of citizenship. First, \\"natural born citizens\\" are children of two citizen parents. This is an ambilineal jus sanguinis citizenship law.Constitution of Bhutan , Art. 6 Second, \\"citizens by registration\\" are those who can prove domicile in Bhutan by December 31, 1958 by showing registration in the official record of the Government of Bhutan. Third, \\"citizens by naturalization\\" are those who have applied for, and were granted, naturalization. Naturalization requires applicants to have lawfully resided in Bhutan for at least 15 years; have no record of imprisonment for criminal offences within the country or outside; can speak and write Dzongkha; have a good knowledge of the culture, customs, traditions and history of Bhutan; and have no record of having spoken or acted against the Tsawa-sum. They must also renounce the citizenship, if any, of a foreign State on being conferred Bhutanese citizenship; and take a solemn Oath of Allegiance to the Constitution as may be prescribed. The grant of citizenship by naturalization takes effect by a Royal Kasho (written order) of the King. The Constitution prohibits dual citizenship. If citizens of Bhutan acquire another citizenship, their Bhutanese citizenship is terminated. The Constitution confers the power to regulate all matters relating to citizenship to Parliament, subject to the Citizenship Acts. Fundamental rights The Constitution, in Article 7, guarantees a number of Fundamental Rights, variously to all persons and to citizens of Bhutan.Constitution of Bhutan , Art. 7 All the citizens of Bhutan have the right to life, liberty and security of person and is not deprived of such rights except in accordance with the due process of law.

This is an explicit statement of the presumption of innocence. All persons have the right to consult and be represented by a Bhutanese jabmi (attorney) of their choice (right to counsel). Bhutanese citizens have the right to freedom of speech, opinion and expression; the right to information; the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; the right to vote; the right to freedom of movement and residence within Bhutan; the right to equal access and opportunity to join the Public Service; the right to own property (but not the right to sell or transfer land or any immovable property to non-citizens, except as allowed by Parliament); the right to practice any lawful trade, profession or vocation; the right to equal pay for work of equal value; the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of association, other than membership of associations that are harmful to the peace and unity of the country; and the right not to be compelled to belong to any association. The Constitution guarantees freedom of the press, radio and television and other forms of dissemination of information, including electronic. However, the State may subject persons to reasonable restriction by law, when it concerns the interests of the sovereignty, security, unity and integrity of Bhutan; the interests of peace, stability and well-being of the nation; the interests of friendly relations with foreign States; incitement to an offence on the grounds of race, sex, language, religion or region; the disclosure of information received in regard to the affairs of the State or in discharge of official duties; or the rights and freedom of others.

All persons have the duty to uphold justice and to act against corruption; to act in aid of the law; and to respect and abide by the provisions of the Constitution.Constitution of Bhutan , Art. 8 Bhutanese citizens must preserve, protect and defend the sovereignty, territorial integrity, security and unity of Bhutan. Bhutanese citizens must render national service when called upon to do so by Parliament. They have the duty to preserve, protect and respect the environment, culture and heritage of the nation; and to foster tolerance, mutual respect and spirit of brotherhood amongst all the people of Bhutan transcending religious, linguistic, regional or sectional diversities. State policy Article 9 defines the principles of state policy. By the language of the Constitution, some provisions of the mandate are obligatory, while others listed in Article 9 are precatory, stating that \\"the State shall endeavour\\" to fulfill certain guarantees. =Social policy= The State must provide free education to all children of school going age up to grade 10, ensure that technical and professional education is made generally available, and ensure that higher education is equally accessible to all on the basis of merit.Constitution of Bhutan , Art. 9 It must also provide free access to basic public health services in both modern and traditional medicines; and encourage free participation in the cultural life of the community, promote arts and sciences and foster technological innovation. The State must also encourage and foster private sector development through fair market competition and prevent commercial monopolies. The State endeavours to apply State Policy to ensure a good quality of life for the people of Bhutan in a progressive and prosperous country that is committed to peace and amity in the world. It strives to promote conditions that will enable the pursuit of Gross National Happiness. The State also endeavours to guarantee human rights. It endeavours to create a civil society free of oppression, discrimination and violence; based on the rule of law, protection of human rights and dignity. It also endeavours to ensure the right to work, vocational guidance and training and just and favourable conditions of work. It strives to provide education for the purpose of improving and increasing knowledge, values and skills of the entire population with education being directed towards the full development of the human personality. The State endeavours to take appropriate measures to eliminate all forms of discrimination and exploitation against women and children; and to promote those conditions that are conducive to co-operation in community life and the integrity of the extended family structure. The State further endeavours to ensure fundamental rights listed under Article 7; to provide justice through a fair, transparent and expeditious process; to safeguard legal aid to secure justice; and to protect the telephonic, electronic, postal or other communications of all persons in Bhutan from unlawful interception or interruption. These are further guarantees of due process and privacy. Crossing into religion, the State strives to create conditions that will enable the true and sustainable development of a good and compassionate society rooted in Buddhist ethos and universal human values. =Economic policy= The Constitution declares the State's economic endeavours. The State endeavours to develop and execute policies to minimize inequalities of income, concentration of wealth, and promote equitable distribution of public facilities among individuals and people living in different parts of the Kingdom. Thus, the State's policy in carrying out its objectives is somewhat Buddhist-socialist. The State also endeavours to achieve economic self-reliance and promote open and progressive economy; to ensure the right to fair and reasonable remuneration for one's work; to ensure the right to rest and leisure, including reasonable limitation of working hours and periodic holidays with pay; and to provide security in the event of sickness and disability or lack of adequate means of livelihood for reasons beyond one's control. The State also endeavours to ensure that all the Dzongkhags are treated with equity on the basis of different needs so that the allocation of national resources results in comparable socio-economic development. The Constitution defines the Government's role in finance, trade and commerce. It authorizes the Government to raise loans, make grants, or guarantee loans. It also sets up a regulatory framework for the Consolidated Fund, Bhutan's general public assets.Constitution of Bhutan , Art. 14 Branches of government The Constitution mandates the separation of the legislative, executive and judicial branches except to the extent provided for by the Constitution. The legislative branch is the bicameral Parliament of Bhutan. The executive branch is the Lhengye Zhungtshog (cabinet), headed by the Prime Minister and supported by subsidiary government agencies. The politically independent judicial branch is the Royal Court of Justice, which is reviewed by the Supreme Court of Bhutan. Within these branches of government, only members of the executive and the National Assembly (the lower house of Parliament) may hold political party affiliations. =Legislative branch and operation= View of Tashichoedzong, Thimphu, seat of the Bhutanese government since 1952. Parliament consists of the King, the National Council and the National Assembly.Constitution of Bhutan , Art. 10 Bhutan's international territorial boundaries and internal Dzongkhag and Gewog divisions may be altered only with the consent of at least ¬æ of the total number of members of Parliament. The National Council of Bhutan is the upper house, or house of review in the bicameral legislature. It consists of 25 members: one directly elected from each of the 20 Dzongkhags (Districts) and 5 appointed by the King. The National Council meets at least twice a year. The membership elects a Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson from its number. Members and candidates of the National Council are prohibited from holding political party affiliation.Constitution of Bhutan , Art. 11 The National Assembly of Bhutan is the lower house of parliament. It consists of a maximum of 55 members directly elected by the citizens of constituencies within each Dzongkhag (District). Under this system of proportional representation, each constituency is represented by one National Assembly member; each of the 20 Dzongkhags must be represented by between 2‚Äì7 members. Constituencies are reapportioned every 10 years. The National Assembly meets at least twice a year, and elects a Speaker and Deputy Speaker from among its members. Members and candidates may be members of political parties.Constitution of Bhutan , Art. 12 The Constitution details procedures for the passing of bills and other procedural requirements of governance. Bhutanese legislation must be presented bicamerally, at times in joint sitting of the National Council and National Assembly, however bills may pass by default without vote when none is conducted before the close of the present session. Bills are ultimately subject to veto and modification by the King, however the King must assent to bills resubmitted after joint sitting and deliberation by the National Council and National Assembly.Constitution of Bhutan , Art. 13 The National Assembly may, with support of at least ‚Öì of its members, motion of no confidence in the Government. If the vote passes with at least ‚Öî support, the King must dismiss the Government. The Constitution defines the rights and duties of the opposition party in Parliament.Constitution of Bhutan , Art. 18 It also lays a framework for the formation, function, and dissolution of interim governments.Constitution of Bhutan , Art. 19 =Executive= Executive power is vested in the Lhengye Zhungtshog (Council of Ministers, or Cabinet), which consists of the Ministers headed by the Prime Minister. The Constitution sets forth the procedure of the formation of government and its ministries, providing for the post of Prime Minister and the other Ministers of Bhutan. The King recognizes the leader or nominee of the party that wins the majority of seats in the National Assembly as the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is limited to two terms of office. Other Ministers are appointed from among National Assembly members by the King on advice of the Prime Minister. All Ministers must be natural-born citizens of Bhutan. There is a limit of two Ministers from any one Dzongkhag.Constitution of Bhutan , Art. 17 The number of other Ministers is determined by the number of Ministries required to provide efficient and good governance. Creation of an additional ministry or reduction of any ministry must be approved by Parliament. The Lhengye Zhungtshog must aid and advise the King in the exercise of his functions as Head of State including international affairs, provided that the King may require the Lhengye Zhungtshog to reconsider such advice. The Prime Minister must keep the King informed from time to time about the affairs of the State, including international affairs, and must submit such information and files as called for by the King.Constitution of Bhutan , Art. 20 The Lhengye Zhungtshog must assess the state of affairs in Government and society, at home and abroad; define the goals of State action and determine the resources required to achieve them; plan and co-ordinate government policies and ensure their implementation; and represent the Kingdom at home and abroad. The Lhengye Zhungtshog are collectively responsible to the King and to Parliament. The Executive cannot issue any executive order, circular, rule or notification inconsistent with, modifying, varying or superseding the laws of Bhutan. =Judiciary= Article 21 pertains to the judiciary. The duty of the Judiciary of Bhutan is to safeguard, uphold, and administer justice fairly and independently without fear, favour, or undue delay in accordance with the rule of law to inspire trust and confidence and to enhance access to justice. The judicial authority of Bhutan is vested in the Royal Court of Justice, comprising the Supreme Court, the High Court, the Dzongkhag Courts, the Dungkhag Courts, and such other courts and tribunals as may be established by the King on the recommendation of the National Judicial Commission.Constitution of Bhutan , Art. 21 The Supreme Court of Bhutan, which comprises the Chief Justice and four Drangpons, is the highest appellate authority to entertain appeals against the judgments, orders, or decisions of the High Court in all matters. The Supreme Court is a court of record. The Chief Justice of Bhutan, Drangpons (Associate Justices) of the Supreme Court are appointed by the King. The term of office of the Chief Justice of Bhutan is five years (or until attaining age 65). That of the Drangpons of the Supreme Court is ten years (or until attaining age 65). Where a question of law or fact is of such a nature and of such public importance that it is expedient to obtain the opinion of the Supreme Court, the King may refer the question to the Supreme Court for its consideration, which hears the reference and submit its opinion to him. The Supreme Court may, on its own motion or on an application made by the Attorney General or by a party to a case, withdraw any case pending before the High Court involving a substantial question of law of general importance relating to the interpretation of this Constitution and dispose of the case itself. The Chief Justice and Drangpons of the High Court of Bhutan are appointed by the King. The term of office of the Chief Justice and the Drangpons of the High Court is 10 years (or until attaining age 60). The High Court of Bhutan, which comprises a Chief Justice and eight Drangpons, is the court of appeal from the Dzongkhag Courts and Tribunals in all matters and exercises original jurisdiction in matters not within the jurisdiction of the Dzongkhag Courts and Tribunals. The judges of the Dzongkhag and Dungkhag Courts are not appointed by the King. Every person in Bhutan has the right to approach the courts in matters arising out of the Constitution or other laws subject to guarantee as fundamental rights. The Supreme Court and the High Court may issue such declarations, orders, directions or writs as may be appropriate in the circumstances of each case. By command of the King and upon the recommendation of the National Judicial Commission, Drangpons of the Supreme Court and the High Court may be punished by censure and suspension for proven misbehaviour that does not deserve impeachment in the opinion of the Commission. Parliament may, by law, establish impartial and independent Administrative Tribunals as well as Alternative Dispute Resolution centres. The King appoints the four members of the National Judicial Commission. The Commission comprises the Chief Justice of Bhutan as Chairperson, the senior most Drangpon of the Supreme Court, the Chairperson of the Legislative Committee of the National Assembly, and the Attorney General. Local governments The grouping of Dzongkhags into four zones (dzongdey), Eastern, Southern, Central and Western, is no longer official. Article 22 establishes Local Governments that are \\"decentralized and devolved to elected Local Governments to facilitate the direct participation of the people in the development and management of their own social, economic and environmental well-being.\\" The stated objectives of all Local Governments are to ensure that local interests are taken into account in the national sphere of governance by providing a forum for public consideration on issues affecting the local territory; to provide democratic and accountable government for local communities; to ensure the provision of services to communities in a sustainable manner; to encourage the involvement of communities and community organizations in matters of local governance; and to discharge any other responsibilities as may be prescribed by law made by Parliament.Constitution of Bhutan , Art. 22 Local Governments receive financial resources from the National Government in the form of annual grants to ensure self-reliant and self-sustaining units of local self-government and to promote holistic and integrated area-based development planning. Local Governments are entitled to levy, collect, and appropriate taxes, duties, tolls, and fees in accordance with procedures provided for by Parliament by law. Local Governments are also entitled to own assets and incur liabilities by borrowing on their own account subject to such limitations as may be provided for by Parliament by law. Such is an example of a decentralized economy. The Constitution divides Local Government into three tiers: Dzongkhag Tshogdu (District Council at the highest local level), Gewog Tshogde (County Committee at the intermediate local level) and Thromde Tshogde (Municipal Committee at the most local level). Each body sits for five-year terms. There are 20 Dzongkhags (Districts) in all of Bhutan, each headed by a Dzongdag appointed by the King as the chief executive supported by civil servants. Each Dzongkhag is also represented by a Dzongkhag Tshogdu (District Council). Membership of the Dzongkhag Tshogdu depends on the number of Gewogs within the Dzongkhag. Each Gewog is represented on the Tshogdu by two members, its Gup and Mangmi (below). Two further members of the Tshogdu are one elected representative from the Dzongkhag Thromde (District municipality) and one elected representative from Dzongkhag Yenlag Thromde (satellite towns). The Dzongkhag Tshogdu elects a Chairperson from among its members and meets at least twice a year. Dzongkhags are divided into Gewogs (Counties or Blocks), numbering 205 in all of Bhutan. These are in turn subdivided into Chiwogs for election purposes. Each Gewog is represented by a Gewog Tshogde (County Committee), headed by a Gup (Head of Gewog) and a Mangmi (deputy), both of whom are directly elected by citizens. Other Tshogpas (Representatives) are directly elected by citizens of Chiwogs. The membership of each Gewog Tshogde must comprise between 7‚Äì10 members and meet at least three times annually. On the most local level, a Thromde Tshogde (Municipal Committee) is headed by a Thrompon (Mayor), who is directly elected by the voters of the Dzongkhag Thromde. The powers and functions of the Thrompon are defined by Parliament. The other members of the Thromde Tshogde are elected directly by citizens divided into constituencies. Like the Gewog Tshogde, the Thromde Tshogde must comprise between 7‚Äì10 members and meet at least three times annually. The Constitution establishes a ‚Öî quorum requirement in order to conduct any business on Local Government levels. It also defines local electoral procedure in terms of Parliamentary Electoral Laws. Notably, candidates and members of the Local Governments are banned from political party affiliation. Political parties Article 15 sets up a regulatory framework for political parties, however the Constitution provides partisan elections only for the National Assembly. Two political parties are elected to the National Assembly, established through a primary election in which all registered political parties may participate. The majority is the ruling party, while the second party among the plurality forms the opposition. Defection from one party to another is prohibited to sitting members.Constitution of Bhutan , Art. 15 Political parties must promote national unity and progressive economic development and strive to ensure the well-being of the nation. Candidates and parties are prohibited from appealing to regionalism, ethnicity and religion to incite voters for electoral gain. Political parties must be registered by the Election Commission. Registration requires their members to be Bhutanese citizens and not otherwise disqualified, and that membership not be based on region, sex, language, religion or social origin. Registration requires parties be broad-based with cross-national membership and support and be committed to national cohesion and stability. Members of all parties must declare allegiance to the constitution and uphold the sovereignty, security, and unity of the Kingdom. Furthermore, parties are required to advance democracy and the social, economic, and political growth of Bhutan. Parties are prohibited from receiving any money or assistance other than those contributions made by its registered members, and the value of such contributions is regulated by the Election Commission. Parties are prohibited from receiving any money or assistance from foreign sources, be it governmental, non-governmental, private organizations or from private parties or individuals. Political parties may be dissolved only by declaration of the Supreme Court. The Constitution establishes grounds for dissolution of political parties. If party objectives or activities are in contravention of the Constitution; if a party has received money or assistance from foreign sources; or if the Election Laws are violated, the Supreme Court may declare that party dissolved. Furthermore, Parliament may proscribe other laws with the effect of disqualifying political parties. Once dissolved, political parties may not comprise any members. Parliament regulates the formation, functions, ethical standards, and intra-party organization of political parties and regularly audits their accounts to ensure compliance with law. Article 16 delineates the rules of public campaign financing.Constitution of Bhutan , Art. 16 Elections Article 23 defines the Constitutional requirements for elections in Bhutan. The Constitution calls for universal suffrage by secret ballot of all citizens over age 18 who have been registered in the civil registry of their constituency for at least one year and not \\"otherwise disqualified from voting under any law in force in Bhutan.\\" In order to vote, Bhutanese citizens must furnish their Citizenship Card.Constitution of Bhutan , Art. 23 Parliament makes, by law, provisions for all matters relating to, or in connection with, elections including the filing of election petitions challenging elections to Parliament and Local Governments, and the Code of Conduct for the political parties and the conduct of the election campaign as well as all other matters necessary for the due constitution of the Houses of Parliament and the Local Governments. In order to provide for informed choice by the voter, candidates for an elective office must file, along with a nomination, an affidavit declaring: the income and assets of candidates, spouses and dependent children; biographical data and educational qualifications; records of criminal convictions; and whether candidates are accused in a pending case for an offense punishable with imprisonment for more than one year and in which charges are framed or cognizance is taken by a court of law prior to the date of filing of such a nomination. To qualify for an elective office, candidates must be Bhutanese citizens; must be registered voters in their own constituencies; be between ages 25 and 65 at the time of nomination; must not receive money or assistance from foreign sources whatsoever; and fulfill the necessary educational and other qualifications prescribed in the Electoral Laws.

Disqualifications are adjudicated by the High Court on an election petition filed pursuant to law made by Parliament. Audits and commissions The Constitution provides for several independent government bodies analogous to agencies. Under Article 2 Section 19 (above), the King appoints the members of these agencies on advice from the civil government, namely the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice of Bhutan, the Speaker, the Chairperson of the National Council, and the Leader of the Opposition Party. The term for each position is 5 years. Referenced for incorporation by respective sections are the Bhutanese Audit Act, Bhutanese Civil Service Act, and Bhutanese Anti-Corruption Act; references to existing \\"Election Laws\\" also appear throughout the Constitution. The independent Election Commission is responsible for the preparation, maintenance, and periodical updating of electoral rolls, the election schedule, and the supervision, direction, control, and conduct of elections to Parliament and Local Governments, as well as holding of National Referendums, in a free and fair manner. It is also responsible for the delimitation of constituencies for election of the members of Parliament and Local Governments.

It also provides that the Commission must operate under the Civil Service Act of Parliament.Constitution of Bhutan , Art. 26 The Constitution also codifies and explains the function of the Anti-Corruption Commission. It is headed by a Chairperson and comprises two members.

The series is the third instalment in a series of four television series about the history of the early Qing dynasty. It was preceded by Xiaozhuang Mishi (2003) and Huang Taizi Mishi (2004), and followed by Secret History of Kangxi (2006), all of which were also produced by You Xiaogang. Plot The series is based on the life of Nurhaci, the founder of the Qing dynasty. Nurhaci started his life of a warrior-king by uniting the Jurchen (later Manchu) tribes under his rule. In addition to suppressing the threat of internal conflict, Nurhaci attacks the Ming Empire's territories in northern China. Nurhaci helped to build a strong foundation for his son and successor, Huangtaiji, who eventually conquers the Ming Empire and establishes the Qing Empire. He also is entangled between five women in his life, and this is highlighted in the series. The five women are Menggu, Naqiya, Dongge, Abahai, and Tunggiya Qingya. Dongge is a renowned beauty from the plains and loves both Nurhaci and his brother Surhaci. Tunggiya Qingya is Nurhaci's primary consort and the mother of Cuyen and Daisan. Menggu is the mother of Hong Taiji and a beautiful woman with a mysterious past. Abahai was his favorite during his later years and the mother of Dodo, Dorgon, and Ajige. Naqiya was the former wife of Li Rubai, but Nurhaci later wed Naqiya to Surhaci.

He is remembered in Scotland for his missions in 1543 and 1560 in support of the Auld Alliance. Mission of 1543 After the death of James V, Scotland was ruled by Regent Arran. His regency was challenged by David Beaton and Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox. Lennox even threw doubt on Arran‚Äôs legitimacy. His grounds were the complex legal circumstances of Arran's father‚Äôs second marriage. Into this troubled situation Francis I of France sent a diplomatic mission and military aid to support the alliance between France and Scotland. The Auld Alliance was threatened by an agreement, the Treaty of Greenwich, which would lead to Mary, Queen of Scots marrying Prince Edward. The French envoys, Jacques de la Brosse, with his colleague, the lawyer, Jacques M√©nage, seigneur de Caigny, and the Papal Legate Marco Grimani, Patriarch of Aquileia, brought money and munitions to Dumbarton Castle on 6 October 1543, and unwittingly delivered them to Lennox.Dickinson, Gladys, ed., Two Missions of de la Brosse (Scottish History Society, 1942), 3-9. According to the later narratives of Claude Nau and John Lesley, they arrived in 5 ships with 60,000 crowns. Nau and Lesley wrongly give the name of the legate as the nuncio, Pierre Francis Contareni, Patriarch of Venice, but mention another colleague, 'James Anort', meaning James Stewart.Stevenson, Joseph, ed., The History of Mary Stewart by Claude Nau (Edinburgh, 1883), 333: Cody ed., Leslie's History of Scotland, vol. 2 (STS, 1895), 270-271. There were seven ships and James Stewart of Cardonald, a Scots Guard officer who escorted La Brosse and M√©nage, told Beaton that the envoys were, \\"na grett personages\\" who had brought, \\"sellvar and artellyery monesyzonis pekes and halberdes.\\"Sanderson, Margaret HB., Cardinal Beaton (John Donald, 1986), 194: Annie I. Cameron, Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine (SHS: Edinburgh, 1927), 34. La Brosse and M√©nage then met with Arran, Mary of Guise, and Beaton, mostly at the Palace of Stirling Castle. On 24 November 1543, they sent a report of their mission to Francis I of France with 23 articles detailing what they had seen, heard and resolved.Dickinson (1942), 47. Much of this concerns the activities of Lennox, who was to be humoured in his ambition to marry Mary of Guise.Dickinson, (1942), 39. La Brosse and M√©nage undertook to search the registers of the Scottish Parliament in order to find a loophole to invalidate the Treaty of Greenwich.Dickinson, (1942), 43. Ralph Sadler, the English ambassador, has no comment on these proceedings, he had taken refuge at Tantallon Castle and Arran sought his expulsion from Scotland.State Papers Henry VIII, vol. 5 part 4 (London, 1836), 348-350: cf. Letters and Papers Henry VIII. Mary of Guise's mother, Antoinette de Bourbon recommended he should become the tutor of Mary's son, Francis, Duke of Longueville.Marguerite Wood, Balcarres Papers, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1923), 113-114. Jacques was still in Scotland in December 1545, and left on Scottish business to meet Francis I at Saint-Germains in February 1546. Jacques said Antoinette was there, with nothing to occupy her except hunting and designing buildings.Cameron, Anne, The Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine (SHS, 1927), 159: Balcarres Papers, vol. 1 (1923), 124. Mission of 1558 - 1560 Jacques de la Brosse served as a soldier at Metz, in Italy and at Calais. From 1558, during the Scottish Reformation, Jacques was stationed in Scotland as a captain of French troops. He was made a knight of the Order of Saint Michael. Jacques and Nicolas de Pellev√©, Bishop of Amiens, wrote letters summoning the rebelling Lords of the Congregation to attend the Queen Regent in October 1559. As there was no response by 13 November, Francis II of France and Mary instructed them to offer a pardon to all who would submit and punishment to those remaining obstinate. (A similar commission which also included Jean de Monluc, Bishop of Valence, was issued on 1 April 1560)Labanoff, A, Lettres de Marie Stuart, vol. 1, 72-75, (in French): Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (1898), 344, (English summary) When the English were preparing to intervene in the Scottish Reformation crisis in January 1560, Jacques wrote to the Duke of Norfolk, saying that he could not believe a rumour in Edinburgh that Norfolk was lieutenant-general to attack the French and aid the Protestant rebels. An English fleet, commanded by William Winter began to harass shipping in Firth of Forth. An English herald, Chester Herald, William Flower denied all knowledge of the raider to Mary of Guise on 16 February 1560. Jacques and Henri Cleutin spoke in defiance to Flower, and he asked if Jacques would be an envoy into England. Jacques replied he had heard the English army were coming into Scotland and he would then \\"give them the looking upon.\\" At the conclusion of hostilities on 15 July 1560, Jacques signed a guarantee for the French evacuation of Leith.Calendar of the State Papers relating to Scotland, vol. 1 (1898), 208, 253, 263-264, 288, 322, 344, 449-50. French troops had invested the town of Leith and it was besieged by a Scottish and English army. A French journal of the siege and events from 22 January 1560 to 15 June, by an anonymous author, mentions the activities of Jacques de la Brosse in passing. La Brosse advised Henri Cleutin, sieur d‚ÄôOisel, on tactics on 6 April,Dickinson, (1942), 99. and Guise on diplomacy.Dickinson, (1942), 103. The journal, edited in its original French and translated by Gladys Dickinson in her Two Missions of de la Brosse is an important source for the Siege of Leith and corroborates details found in English letters and Knox‚Äôs History of the Reformation. Jacques married Fran√ßoise de Moussy-la-Contour-de- Puybaillard, their children included a daughter Euchariste.Dictionnaire de la noblesse, 2nd ed., vol. 3, Paris (1771), 373. Jacques became a knight of the Order of Malta.Histoire des Chevaliers hospitaliers de Saint-Jean de J√©rusalem, vol 7, 180. He was killed at the battle of Dreux in 1562. Pierre de Bourdeille, seigneur de Brant√¥me wrote that Jacques was the most graceful and gracious man-at-arms that was ever seen.Oeuvres, mentioned by Merriman, Marcus, (2000).

It is grown as an ornamental in gardens for its attractive glossy foliage and its clusters of tiny, scented, white flowers. It is the only one of 24 species of Cunonia to occur outside of New Caledonia in the Pacific. Appearance The cream-coloured sprays of flowers Cunonia capensis is a beautiful specimen tree, especially for southern African gardens. Its foliage is glossy, with tints of red, and it produces sprays of dense, fragrant, cream-coloured flowers from February to May (late austral summer to autumn). The flowers are bisexual and attract butterflies and honey bees. The fine seeds appear in tiny two-horned capsules, and are dispersed by birds and by wind. The large stipules which enclose the growth tip are pressed together in a spoon-like structure, giving the tree one of its common names, the butterspoon tree. Detail of the glossy, red-tinted leaves This evergreen garden tree does not grow well in arid conditions, as it prefers a slightly more temperate climate, and requires a great deal of water in its first few years. It tolerates some frost and it is very fast-growing - provided it has sufficient water. In the open sun it typically reaches about 5 meters, but in forests it can reach a height of up to 10 meters. Distribution A giant specimen growing beside a forest path on Table Mountain Cunonia capensis naturally ranges from Cape Town and the Western Cape of South Africa, eastwards all the way to Swaziland and southern Mozambique. It typically grows in the indigenous Afromontane forests of southern Africa, and especially beside rivers. In its natural range it greatly favours moist spots or areas with high rainfall. The genus Cunonia has a disjunct natural distribution, with 24 species occurring only on the island of New Caledonia in the Pacific, and a single species (Cunonia capensis) in southern Africa. Cultivation Small Cunonia capensis trees in cultivation in a botanical garden Cunonia capensis is increasingly cultivated across southern Africa as an ornamental specimen tree. It is cultivated for its glossy foliage which is tinted with red, and its sprays of cream flowers. It grows well full sun and as well as shade, and it can be planted near buildings because it has a gentle, non- invasive root-system. This has recently made it popular in built-up areas. It requires a moist environment though, as trees planted in arid areas would require frequent watering, especially while still small. This has however also made it a very suitable tree for marshy, water-logged gardens, or the banks of rivers. The tree is usually cultivated from its tiny seeds, and the young plants need ample water and some shelter from direct sunlight. It is one of the fastest growing trees in southern Africa.

Pandit (Sambanand Monappa Pandit; 25 March 1916 ‚Äì 30 March 1993) was one of the most popular and much sought-after painters of his times, especially in the school of Realism in contrast to the contemporaneous net- traditionalist Bengal Renaissance and other Indian modern art movements. Most of his subjects oscillated between events from classical Indian literature including the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, the Puranas, and the contemporary cinema of his times. He infused a rare blend of artistic virtuosity and filmi glamour to his portrayal of romantic characters like Radha-Krishna, Nala- Damayanti, and Viswamitra-Menaka as also the many heroes and heroines of Hindi cinema. In addition to his critically acclaimed masterpieces he also illustrated many popular film posters, film magazines and various other publications in what can collectively be termed as calendar art. His works remain hugely popular even today.Deccan Herald, Thursday, 8 January 2009 http://archive.deccanherald.com/Content/Jan82009/state20090107111270.asp His mythological paintings and calendar art have been collected widely. He is also widely celebrated in the Indian calendar industry for his \\"realistic\\" depiction (albeit inspired by contemporary Indian cinema) of themes from Hindu mythology. In these paintings he emphasised the physical forms of the heroes, heroines, gods and goddesses in marked contrast to traditional and classical styles of Indian painting. In his paintings, Pandit depicted his subjects as handsome, muscular, valorous men and sensuously beautiful, voluptuous women set in surroundings suggestive of cinema settings and sceneries. A poster painting by S M Pandit of Krishna fluting to a doe eyed Radha at the break of dawn. Brief biography Born on 25 March 1916, in Gulbarga district of Karnataka state, Pandit became a student of Shankar Rao Alandkar who was also a Sir. J. J. School of Arts product. Subsequently he took his diploma from the Madras School of Art. He came to Mumbai in 1935 and joined Nootan Kala Mandir for further studies under the guidance of Shri G S Dandavathimath and appeared for his Diploma at Sir. J.J. School of Arts where he was taught by renowned teachers like Shri K.B Chudekar. His headmaster at the Sir J.J. School was the famous artist M. V. Dhurandhar known for his use of naturalistic techniques to depict scenes from Indian mythology, History and Classical Literature, a style he inherited from Raja Ravi Varma, and passed on to Pandit. Pandit was also greatly influenced by Capt. W.E. Gladstone Soleman, the then Director of Art in Sir J J School of Arts Mumbai. Pandit subsequently completed his Diploma with distinction. Career in art As S. M. Pandit father's financial condition was very poor, his aunt sold her gold bangles which fetched her Rs 50 and gave money to Pandit to move Bombay for his further studies and career. This was a great turning point for him, Pandit soon made his mark in the commercial world of advertising, as also calendar and film art. He began his commercial career in 1938‚Äì39, by painting MGM showcards for Bombay's Metro Theater. He and a few other artists set up the Young Artists Commercial Arts Studio in Bombay, designing the publicity for Franz Osten's 1938 Bombay talkies film Bhabhi. They also became the first Indians to create painted show-cards featuring Hollywood greats, Greta Garbo, Norma Shearer, and Joan Crawford for the MGM. During this period, Pandit also innovated the use of quicker drying Gouache on cloth over oil paints in creating his film posters. Pandit left the Studio to join Ratan Batra's advertising agency, which had as its clientele many of the new indigenous industrial houses like Mafatlal, Kohinoor, Khatau, etc. Pandit also met Baburao Patel, the editor of Filmindia magazine around this time and began designing and illustrating the cover pages for Filmindia which continue to be popular even to this day. By 1944, Pandit set up his own studio called Studio S. M. Pandit in Bombay's Shivaji Park where he produced film publicity for Prabhat Studios, Raj Kapoor, Sohrab Modi, among many others. In the studio Pandit collaborated with another young artist from Goa, Raghubir Mulgaonkar (1922‚Äì76) who continued to gratefully acknowledge the immense influence that Pandit had in developing his oeuvre. During this time, Pandit designed the posters and other publicity material for such films as Dr. Kotnis Ki Amar Kahani,Cinema India: The Art of Bollywood http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/exhibitions/cinema_india.php 1946; Barsaat,100 yrs of Indian cinema through scrapbook memories- a visual tribute http://madhusreechatterjee.wordpress.com/2013/12/24/100-yrs-of-indian-cinema- through-scrapbook-memories-a-visual-tribute/ 1949, etc.Cinema India: The Art of Bollywood ‚Äì V & A exhibition https://collections.vam.ac.uk/exhibition/cinema-india-the-art-of- bollywood/337/ Pandit continued to work for Filmindia in his characteristic style typified by poster paintings with glamorous appeal, dramatic expression and bold graphic composition which influenced his other body of works including the religious and mythological paintings which continue to be his lasting legacy. Pandit had started painting mythological subjects in the 1950s on orders from the Bombay Fine Arts Press and Nagpur's Shivraj Fine Arts Press. While the influence of Raja Ravi Varma and M. V. Dhurandhar are more than evident in these paintings, it is also true that the 'Filmi' influence in the characterisation of 'made-up' protagonists with highlights shimmering on their hair and lips, muscular Tarzan-like gods and Disney-like detailing of flowers and animals is equally important.Figures of Locality and Tradition: Commercial Cinema and the Networks of Visual Print Capitalism in Maharashtra ‚Äì Article by Kajri Jain in the book 'Bollyworld: Popular Indian Cinema Through A Transnational Lens' edited by Raminder Kaur & Ajay J. Sinha ‚Äì Sage Publications India Pvt Ltd In a certain sense, Pandit inherited the \\"naturalistic\\" or the \\" realistic\\" stye of painting from Raja Ravi Varma. However Pandit along with Mulgaonkar, took a further step by subjecting the new forms of religious and mythic imagery inaugurated by Raja Ravi Varma, to the technical innovations of his times in tune with the demands of the market, particularly in relation to film and calendar art. Further, the \\"realism\\" or \\"naturalism\\" of his paintings and posters particularly with reference to mythological and religious subjects should be seen in the context of his realistic departure from the canonical iconography traditionally prescribed for such subjects which was by and large followed in the classical and traditional styles of Indian painting.The Cambridge Companion to Modern Indian Culture https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0521516250 It is also in the same context, that we can explain a certain amount of stasis and continuity in the imagery of Gods and Goddesses, begun by Raja Ravi Varma and subsequently insisted upon by the rapidly expanding markets in the calendar and poster art of C. Kondiah Raju, the Nathdwara artists and further down with Pandit and other contemporary artists of the genre. Many of the Hindu religious images of the calendar art era have been subsequently adopted and innovated, wholly or in part by the present day Hindutva propaganda. Among his other masterpieces is the life size portrait of Swami Vivekananda at Kanyakumari. Pandit has also painted several other portraits of Prominent persons and leaders, including the portrait of Mahatma Gandhi now at the New Council Hall, Mumbai. Rewards and recognition Needless to say, recognition and rewards came in ample measure to Pandit. In his own time, he was recognised as the foremost artist in the Genre by many of his contemporaries'Photos of the Gods': The Printed Image and Political Struggle in India By Christopher Pinney and continues to influence artists even to the present day.Atul Dodiya at NGMA ‚Äì platform-mag http://www.platform-mag.com/art/atul-dodiya.html He was awarded a medal at the International exhibition in Toronto in 1944 for one of his cover designs.

In 2009, Transnet Freight Rail placed the first of 110 Class 19E single-cab dual-voltage 3 kV DC and 25 kV AC electric locomotives with a Bo-Bo wheel arrangement in service on the Coalink line from Ermelo to Richards Bay.Railways Africa, 29 Aug 2008: First 19E LocoSouth African Railway News, 9 Apr 2009: TFR Class 19E Test Train / Information Manufacturer The dual- voltage 3 kV DC and 25 kV AC Class 19E is the product of a joint venture by Mitsui for the design, Toshiba for the electrical equipment, Union Carriage and Wagon (UCW) for the bodies and the RSD division of DCD-Dorbyl for the bogies. It was locally manufactured by UCW in Nigel, Gauteng. Road testing on the Class 19E started in August 2008.Railways Africa, 29 Aug 2008: First 19E LocoToshiba Review Feature article (Japanese)Railways Africa, 1 Sep 2006: 220 Bogies on Order Characteristics The Class 19E was the first South African AC locomotive to incorporate regenerative as well as rheostatic electric braking. While regenerative braking was used on all South African mainline locomotives dating back all the way to the introduction of the Class 1E in 1925, the notable exception being the Class 18E, all earlier 25 kV and 50 kV AC South African locomotives made use of rheostatic braking only.Toshiba Review, 2008, Vol 63 No 9 The locomotive uses Toshiba-made 3-phase AC motors, powered through Insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) control. It is a dual-voltage locomotive, designed to operate on either 3 kV DC or . Like the earlier Classes 7E1, 7E4, 9E, 11E, 15E and 18E electric locomotives, these engines have driving cabs at one end only since they would only be utilised in multi-unit consists.Railways Africa, 2 Aug 2009: Visit to UCW As on the dual- voltage Classes 20E and 21E, the main electric circuit is automatically selected in either AC or DC mode based on the voltage of the overhead contact wire feeding the locomotive. To facilitate automatic trouble-free transition on the run, the locomotive is equipped with onboard voltage detectors, while the overhead wire is equipped with two wooden isolators and a length of neutral wire to separate the AC and DC feeds. The neutral section is connected to the rails, which serve as the return conductor on electrified lines.Class 20E manual: Part 1: Locomotive Profile and Technical Data The transition process requires that the locomotive should be switched off automatically before it reaches the isolators and the unpowered overhead wire section, and automatically restarted after exiting from under the unpowered wire. This is done by a pair of track magnets, one on either side of the neutral overhead wire and spaced apart. The two magnets are mounted with their polarities reversed in relation to each other and they activate a magnetic relay, located underneath the locomotive, to do the switching off and restarting. By July 2009, Transnet Freight Rail (TFR) had taken delivery of the first three Class 19E locomotives, and UCW intended to deliver between six and eight new units per quarter.Railways Africa, 9 Jul 2009: Loco Delivery Delays Service The Class 19E locomotives were placed in service on the long Coalink line from Ermelo to Richards Bay to haul export coal from forty-four coal mines in Mpumalanga to the Richards Bay Coal Terminal (RBCT), the export coal harbour in Richards Bay, KwaZulu-Natal.

It is Duncan's second novel and a sequel to Vellum: The Book of All Hours. It was first published in the United Kingdom by Pan Macmillan in February 2007 and, later that same month, in the USA by Del Rey, an imprint of Random House.Hal Duncan (2007), Ink - The Book of All Hours 2, Pan-Macmillan, - US edition: Del Rey, February 2007, Introduction The Vellum is a reality of which Earth is only a small part. It can be reprogrammed using something called the Cant, and this is what some deities from ancient myths, called the Unkin, have done. One group of Unkin see themselves as Angels, and have set up a Covenant promising to reject any ancient deity looking to regain his or her past glory; they are at the time of the narration getting ready for a final war. A group of newly born Unkin (one can become an Unkin through certain unspecified events in his or her life) who refuse to take part in such war are the main characters: Thomas Messenger, a homosexual young man who‚Äôs trying to disappear into the Vellum where he‚Äôll never be found; Jack Carter, a Covenant spear- carrier sent to kill Thomas but in love with him; Joey Pechorin, a Russian Army officer and torture expert; also present, although less than in Vellum, are Seamus Finnan, an Irish angel hiding out in the desert; Phreedom Messenger, Thomas's sister and a trailer park biker trying to avoid conscription and Don MacChuill, a brash Scotsman. Besides the myths and legends referred to, there are also several very vivid references to history, with some of the characters living through events such as the Glasgow 1919 Battle of George Square. The seven main characters are archetypes of characters from myths and legends: Jack, also known as Jack Flash, Spring Heeled Jack, Iacchus and Captain Jack Carter (a legendary World War I hero in one of the parallel worlds in which the novel is set); Thomas Messenger, also known as Puck, Tamuz and Matthew Shepard; Phreedom Messenger, known as Anna, Anaesthesia and Inanna; Guy Fox, who is also Guy Fawkes (although closer to his representation in V for Vendetta than to the historic character), Guy Reynard, the Prussian Baron Reinhardt); Joey Pickering (also Pechorin, Joey Narchosis and Judas); Don MacChuill (also Don Coyote, Don Quixote) and Seamus Finnan (Shammus, Finnegan, Prometheus, Samuel Hobbsbaum, Sammael). From a psychoanalytic point of view, the seven main characters can also be seen as the Super-ego as guiding conscience (Guy/Reynard), the wild and libidinous Id (Jack), the Anima and Animus as a triple goddess/god figure (Phreedom), the ‚Äúinner child‚Äù of the Self (Thomas), the Ego that has to deal with society and reality (Seamus), the Shadow as the dark side (Joey), and the wise hermit or old soldier as an image of age and experience (Don). The homosexual theme is also strongly referred to, especially in the character of Thomas/Puck and his relationship with Jack. Puck is explicitly identified with Matthew Shephard. The main characters' story is framed within the story of the Book of All Hours, a tome in which Metatron, the scribe of the Covenant, has inscribed the destiny of the whole Vellum; the book has been stolen by Guy Reynard, who uses it to travel through the Vellum. This frame story appears in short sections called Errata, at the end of each chapter. The events in the novel are described in a non-linear order, with several skips ahead and back in time. In the first part of the novel, \\"Hinter's Knights\\", Euripides's The Bacchae is not only referenced but (loosely) enacted by the characters on a stage, while the second part, \\"Eastern Mourning\\", hints more or less subtly to various passages of the Bible, more specifically the Old Testament, with a particular focus on the story of Sodom (Genesis 11-14 and 19) and on the Binding of Isaac (Genesis ). Reception The reception to Ink varied. Some critics found it confusing, although most admitted its stylistic value, while others appreciated its experimental nature. Awards Ink has been shortlisted for the 2011 T√§htivaeltaja Awards, assigned to the best science fiction novel released in Finland (and in Finnish) during the previous year.

After the Golm and the K√ºckelsberg, the Streckelsberg is the third highest elevation on the island. The Streckelsberg is located half a kilometre southeast of the former fishing village and present-day seaside resort of Koserow directly on the Baltic Sea shore. To the southeast is the village of K√∂lpinsee; the B 111 federal road and Usedomer B√§derbahn railway run past the hill to the southwest.  Geology  View from Streckelsberg in 1954 The Streckelsberg was formed during the last ice age as a push moraine. At that time over 16,000 years ago large parts of central and northern Europe were covered by a massive ice sheet. During the gradual retreat of the ice, there were repeated smaller advances of the glacier that led to the formation of moraines. The Streckelsberg was formed during such an advance, when the glacier pushed loose sedimentary rock in front of it, piling it up. When the ice retreated further, the first Baltic proglacial lake was formed from the meltwaters and rising sea levels, later the Yoldia Sea and Ancylus Lake were created and, ultimately, the Baltic Sea in its present shape. Originally, the Streckelsberg was much larger than it is today, both in terms of size and height. Through erosion processes the Streckelsberg soon shrank, particularly as a result of breakers from the Baltic Sea. Wave and wind erosion has reduced the Streckelsberg by in the last 300 years. This process still continues, despite coastal protection measures taken in 1995, including groynes, two breakwaters, a triple protective wall and the dumping of artificial sand. In strong storms, parts of the cliff frequently break off and slump down onto the beach.  Geological history of the island of Usedom and the Streckelsberg  The landscape of Northern Germany was formed as a result of several cold stages. Huge masses of ice advanced from Scandinavia to central Germany. In doing so they moved rocks of all sizes (glacial erratics) ahead of them into what is present-day Germany. The island of Usedom was created a result of the latest ice age, the Weichselian Glaciation, which reached its climax about 18,000 years ago. After huge ice masses (inland ice sheets) had melted, characteristic landforms were left behind. These are the ground moraines (areas that had been pushed ahead of the advancing ice masses), the terminal moraines (heaps of rock and earth material pushed up and compressed into hills at the southern edge of the inland ice block into hills) and the sandur (sands washed out of the terminal moraines as the ice melted, which were deposited on the southern side of the terminal moraines). The Streckelsberg is such a terminal moraine, with an area of sandur to the south as far as the Achterwasser lagoon. The Baltic Sea on the north side of the Streckelsberg can be regarded as a giant terminal moraine lake. 7000 to 5000 years ago the island did not exist in its current form. Only the terminal moraines, also known as island or geest cores stuck out from the waters of the Baltic Sea. The Baltic Sea carried off material from these island cores with the force of waves and prevailing currents, depositing it on their leeward sides, so that spits began to be formed. These spits grew as more material was deposited to form sand bars, so that the area between the island cores fully silted up. Examples of such sedimentation zones are the Pudaglasenke and the lowland area between Peenem√ºnde and Zinnowitz, and between Zinnowitz and Koserow.  Flora  The vegetation of the area is divided into layers like any natural habitat in the temperate climatic zone. On the field layer are mosses and fungi (penny bun or cep, honey fungus), in addition there is the herbaceous layer, which is characterized by various species depending on the season. In spring when the soil is warmed up quickly by sunlight, spring flowers like hepatica appear, which conjure up blue carpets on the forest floor, followed by anemone. As the temperatures rise, leaves sprout on the trees. The level of sunlight under the trees reduces and species such as Spring Vetchling, Lily of the Valley, May Lily, Moschatel, Herb Paris and Woodruff appear, which flourish under conditions of low light. As the foliage becomes denser, shade-loving summer flowers appear. The first ones are the remaining native orchids of our deciduous forests. On the Streckelsberg: Common Twayblade, Lesser Butterfly-orchid, Bird's-nest Orchid and Red helleborine. Rather less colourful summer flowers in the beech woods are the Small Balsam, Common Figwort, Wood Avens, Wall Lettuce, Baneberry and Enchanter's-nightshade. Characteristic grasses of the herbaceous layer of the beech forest are False Brome, Wood Melick and Giant Fescue. The overlying shrub layer consists of bushes and saplings, such as Elder, Rowan, Fly Honeysuckle, Common Honeysuckle, Dewberry, Raspberry, Blackthorn, Common Ivy, Alpine Currant, Hazel, Goat Willow, Bird Cherry, three species of wild rose, Common Buckthorn and Viburnum. There are also young trees of the species Norway Maple, Sycamore and Silver Birch. The tree layer is dominated by beech trees that are more than 180 years old and, on the slopes of the hill, by equally ancient Scots Pines.  Afforestation of the Streckelsberg by Senior Forester Schr√∂dter  Senior Forester (Oberf√∂rster) Schr√∂dter afforested the Streckelsberg in 1818 and 1819 in its present form with beech trees in order to better protect the hill and the village of Koserow behind it from the harsh sea winds and from drifting sand. Schr√∂dter was born in 1753 in Klein Behnitz (in the March of Brandenburg). After several years of training he became a royal court and district hunter (Hofj√§ger and Revierj√§ger). From 1810 he was the district forester in Zinnowitz. After the afforestation of the Streckelsberg, he became the senior forester in the Neupudagla Forest District in 1819. He died in 1828. The Wolgast Gazette (Wolgaster Anzeiger), No. 61 of 21 May 1900, reported that: \\"Schr√∂dter rendered great service in the spheres of forestry and sand dunes. He knew, in a masterly way how to anchor and cultivate the bare, infertile sands on the beach at Koserow, with which the wind played games. In particular, he did a great job of afforesting the Streckelsberg at the seaside resort of Koserow, which is now protected by the woods against the harsh sea winds and unwelcome sand drifts. The Schr√∂dter Stone (Schr√∂dterstein), an undressed granite rock has, in gold letters on a polished plate the words:  Fauna  The wildlife of the area corresponds to the various layers of vegetation. On and in the earth live the sand lizard and common lizard, the mole, the common shrew, the tundra vole and red fox. In the tree layer the beech marten and red squirrel may be seen. The herb and shrub layer are home to many species of songbird. The main bird species on the Streckelsberg are the robin wren, great tit, blue tit, chiffchaff, red- breasted flycatcher, willow warbler, blackcap and lesser whitethroat. The somewhat larger blackbird and song thrush also live on the Streckelsberg. In the tree layer there are golden oriole, chaffinch, stock dove, tawny owl, wood pigeon, hooded crow and goshawk. Bats also have their summer homes in tree hollows and cracks. Depending on the biodiversity of the flora, many insect species live on Streckelsberg. In addition to various butterflies there are also beetles, including the capricorn beetle, sawyer and longhorn beetle, whose larvae live on dead wood. ;Waterfowl From the walking trail on the top of the cliffs on the Streckelsberg a wide variety of water birds may be seen including: Mallard, black-headed gull, common gull, herring gull, great black- backed gull, great crested grebe, coot, cormorant and mute swan. Regular migrants from their breeding grounds north of Usedom that may be seen in shallow water are the tufted duck, scaup, eider duck, goldeneye, long-tailed duck, red-breasted merganser and common merganser.  Nature conservation  On 12 December 1957 Streckelsberg was designated as a nature reserve, which today is the Usedom Island Nature Park. The state of the terrain is classified as satisfactory, because parts of it are used for forestry  Koserow Observation Tower  The Koserow Observation Tower was a Wehrmacht observation tower on the Streckelsberg built in the late 1930s for observers of air raids (e.g., on the ports of Swinem√ºnde and Szczecin). The tower's observation deck later had a cinetheodolite for the optical tracking of missile tests from Peenem√ºnde-West (e.g., V-1 flying bomb) and the Peenem√ºnde Army Research Center (V-2 rocket).

Jean Boulanger, a French line-engraver, son of the painter Olivier Boulanger and cousin to the painter of the same name, was born at Amiens in 1608 and baptized in Troyes in Champagne on 24 January 1608; he had five children with Marie Judon. He was documented in Paris in 1645 and resided in the parish of Saint-Etienne-du-Mont.Aceto, op. cit., p. 406. He seems to have attached himself at first to an imitation of the style of Fran√ßois de Poilly. An engraving, dated 1669-93, an impression of which is at the British Museum, representing the Holy Family with St John the Baptist, was engraved by Jean Boulanger and published by Fran√ßois de Poilly.

He later took up a mode of engraving similar to that of his contemporary Jean Morin, but which he greatly improved, of finishing the flesh and naked parts of his figures with dots, instead of strokes, or with a mixture of both. This gave a very soft and mellow effect; but as he finished the draperies and backgrounds with rather a harsh use of the graver, there was a want of union in the effect of his plates. Notwithstanding this defect, his prints have considerable merit, and are justly held in esteem. He died in Amiens about 1680.Aceto, op. cit., p. 306, citing a document in Archives Nationales, Paris, discovered by Maxime Pr√©aud.

It can result from major shifts in intrinsic and extrinsic properties of organisms, including morphology and behaviour in relation to other organisms, or shifts in the global environment, which can cause secular or long-term cyclic changes in preservation. Introduction The fossil record exhibits bias at many different levels. At the most basic level, there is a global bias towards biomineralizing organisms, because biomineralized body parts are more resistant to decay and degradation. Due to the principle of uniformitarianism, there is a basic assumption in geology that the formation of rocks has occurred by the same naturalistic processes throughout history, and thus that the reach of such biases remains stable over time. A megabias is a direct contradiction of this, whereby changes occur in large scale paleobiologic patterns. This includes * Changes in diversity and community structure over tens of millions of years * Variation in the quality of the fossil record between mass and background extinction times * Variation among different climate states, biogeographic provinces, and tectonic settings. It is generally assumed that the quality of the fossil record decreases globally and across all taxa with increasing age, because more time is available for the diagenesis and destruction of both fossils and enclosing rocks, and thus the term \\"megabias\\" is usually used to refer to global trends in preservation. However it has been noted that the fossil record of some taxa actually improves with greater age. Examples such as this, and other related paleobiological trends, clearly indicate the action of a megabias, but only within one particular taxon. Hence, it is necessary to define four classes of megabias related to the reach of the bias, first defined by Kowalewski and Flessa. Within-taxon megabias A change in the quality of a single taxon's record. It may happen whenever evolutionary, environmental, or geologic trends affect the taxon's fossilization potential. Among-taxon static megabias This occurs when the fossilization potential varies from group to group. Among-taxon megabiases include both static and dynamic distortions. A static megabias is constant through time. For example, flatworms have always had a poor record relative to mollusks because mollusks as a taxon are almost always biomineralizing, whereas flatworms are almost never biomineralizing. Among- taxon dynamic megabias A dynamic megabias occurs when the fossilization potential of one group relative to that of another group changes through time. For example, lingulide brachiopods had a lower fossilization potential than articulate brachiopods, but only in the early Paleozoic. This has changed through time, governed by changes in bathymetry and lateral shifts in lithofacies associated with basin evolution. By the Middle Ordovician, articulates had diversified to become important components of all marine environments except the deep basin; inarticulates were most important in offshore and basinal settings. By moving away from the main taphonomic window, the inarticulates sacrificed their fossilization potential whilst not necessarily decreasing their biological diversity. Global megabias A global megabias is one that occurs over the whole world, though not necessarily in all depositional environments. There are numerous documented examples of this, many of which concern the Cambrian explosion and the Ediacaran fauna, both divisive subjects within the paleobiological community. Darwin commented on the Cambrian explosion,He did not refer to it as the \\"Cambrian Explosion\\", however. The term Cambrian had not yet been coined. it being a great problem in his eyes, and speculated that it may be due to an increased propensity for preservation in the Cambrian and a reduced potential beforehand. Cambrian reduction of phosphatization Many fossils, such as the Cambrian Small Shelly Fauna (SSF), are preserved through secondary phosphatization. Such preservation can boost the diversity estimates in three ways: * By preserving fossils that might otherwise be destroyed * By preserving fine anatomical structures that enhance taxonomic resolution. Small anatomical details will show differences between two specimens that would otherwise be lumped within the same group; in this way, an inflated measure of diversity is given * By allowing easy collection. Phosphatized organisms are incredibly easily to extract by acid maceration, allowing large numbers of specimens to be collected with ease. The number of phosphatic facies deposits decreases significantly from the early- to mid-Cambrian. Most probably, this is the cause for the pattern of SSF diversity decline after the Botomian extinction. Whilst there may well have been a significant extinction worldwide of small shelly fossils, a significant decrease in the abundance of phosphatized facies may have caused the decline in SF diversity to appear much more severe than it really was. Overabundance of Konservat-Lagerst√§tten It has been noted after the last 20 years that Exceptional Faunas, a particular class of Konservat-Lagerst√§tten exemplified by Burgess shale deposits, are statistically overabundant considering their age and style of preservation. This problem is also known as the \\"Post-Cambrian closure of the deep-water slope-basin taphonomic window\\". It seems that the cause of this may have been ecological, at least in the root cause; a post-Cambrian changes in the amount of bioturbation in deeper-water low oxygen environments increased sedimentary porosity and thus enhanced microbial activity and accelerated rates of decay. These higher rates of decay after the Cambrian meant that many soft bodied organisms were destroyed before the opportunity for preservation arose.

He was one of the small group of Harsdorff's students from the Academy who were largely responsible for the rebuilding of Copenhagen after the fires. These builders formed a close-knit group, reinforced by their membership of the civil guard and fire corps. They married each other's daughters and widows and acted as godfathers at christenings. Huge fortunes were made as they bought plots of land, built them up and sold them again. Hallander was an enormously productive speculator and builder. He was one of the main contributors to the classical architecture of Copenhagen, predominant in large sections of the city centre. Most of his buildings are now listed. Personal life He married Emilie T√∏nnesen, daughter of skipper Jan Jansen T√∏nnesen and Bodil Hansdatter. He is buried in Assistens Cemetery.

His most famous work, Shahr-e Ghesseh, is an allegorical satire written in the form of a musical play using elements of Iranian folklore, for which he also composed the music. Bijan Mofid (playwright/director) was one of very few serious modern Iranian artists whose writing has reached beyond the intelligentsia to a broad general audience. Life He was born in Tehran in 1935. After teaching for several years at the University of Tehran, he founded a theater workshop, where many of Iran's finest actors received their training. The workshop's major production was Bijan's own City Of Tales (Shahr-e-Ghesseh), a profound satire that weaves social comment through adaptations of traditional music and folk tales. It toured for 3 years, was made into an award-winning film and is recognized as a classic of Iranian literature. Bijan's work as playwright and director has had a continuous and controversial presence in Iranian theater, both on the popular stage and in experimental productions. Nine of his plays have been produced and published and their songs recorded. He directed over fifty productions for radio and television in addition to his stage work; his rare appearances as an actor included the lead role in Arbie Ovanesian's acclaimed production of Suddenly... at the 1992 [?] Nancy International Theatre Festival. The wide popular audiences drawn by Mofid's work earned him an unprecedented degree of immunity from censorship. But his relationship with the Shah's regime consisted of a balancing act between continuous harassment from the secret police and the embarrassment of official recognition and reinterpretation of his work During and after the Iranian Revolution, political groups across the entire spectrum attempted to claim his work as representative of their ideals, but he remained independent and withdrew his plays from production when their integrity was threatened. As the resistance to the Islamic regime grew, recordings of songs from his plays were played on the rooftops of Tehran, identifying Mofid with the opposition. As a result, he lived underground for several months and eventually escaped to the United States. From 1982 until his untimely death in 1984, Bijan directed several productions in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York as well as the first production of his own work in translation, Dragonfly. He took these opportunities to rewrite some of his work that had suffered most heavily from censorship in Iran.

Background Map of Alabama during the War of 1812. The site of the Canoe Fight is located in the center. After the Fort Mims massacre militias were formed in present-day southern Alabama to protect settlers while they were gathering the fall harvest. Red Stick warriors continued to attack settlers in the area. Captain Samuel Dale, who was recovering from wounds received at the Battle of Burnt Corn, volunteered to lead a group of 30 Mississippi Territory volunteers and 40 volunteers from the surrounding area to drive away the Red Stick warriors. On November 11th, the party left Fort Madison headed southeast towards the Alabama River. They crossed the river at French's Landing (near modern Gainestown) in two canoes and continued northward along the river. Six to eight men remained in the canoes under the command of Jeremiah Austill, while the remainder of the force marched up the southern bank of the river. Austill spotted a canoe with Red Sticks coming down the river, who soon reversed direction. Firing was then heard near the mouth of Randon's Creek as Dale and his volunteers ambushed a band of warriors who were preparing food, killing one. The volunteers began gathering the food and supplies the warriors left behind. Due to difficulty marching up the east bank, Dale ordered the men to cross the river to the west bank. All but twelve men, including Dale, Austill, and James Smith crossed the river. These twelve were preparing some of the captured food when they heard the men from the west bank warn they were surrounded by warriors. Battle The volunteers rushed to the river bank but neither canoe had returned from ferrying the other soldiers. They also spotted a canoe with eleven Red Stick warriors descending the river. When the warriors noticed the volunteers, they immediately reversed direction. For an unknown reason, the warriors who had surrounded the soldiers from the east never attacked. Two warriors in the canoe jumped into the river and swam towards the bank. Smith shot and killed one of the warriors. Captain Dale called for eight of the soldiers on the opposite bank to paddle over in the larger of the two canoes. When these soldiers saw the number of warriors in the canoe, they retreated. The smaller canoe, paddled by a free black named Caesar, had arrived on the eastern shore. Dale decided to take the smaller canoe into the river to meet the warriors and asked Austill and Smith to accompany him. With Caesar paddling, all three soldiers attempted to fire at the warriors. Austill and Dale's guns failed to fire due to the primer being wet and Smith's shot missed. Caesar continued to paddle towards the warriors' canoe. Before the canoes rammed into each other, the warrior chief reportedly exclaimed \\"Now for it, Big Sam!\\", (\\"Big Sam\\" being Dale's nickname among the Creeks). Accounts of the ensuing struggle differ: most accounts report that Austill was struck in the head by the chief with his gun stock. After recovering, Austill was then struck with a war club. Caesar held the boats together while both sides exchanged blows using their rifles as clubs. Austill used the war club that he was attacked with to kill one of the warriors. At one point during the struggle, Dale jumped into the warriors canoe. In addition to bludgeoning the warriors, Dale also used a bayonet during the fight. All nine warriors who remained in the boat were killed. The four volunteers all survived, with only Austill receiving significant wounds. After bodies were thrown overboard into the river, the remaining warriors on the east bank began shooting at the small canoe's occupants. Dale, Austill, Smith and Caesar reached the nine other soldiers on the east bank and were able to return to the west bank unharmed. The company marched two more miles up the west bank, then returned to Fort Madison. Aftermath The victory was not of strategic importance in the overall Creek War. Dale became a hero and was afterwards known as \\"The Daniel Boone of Alabama.\\" He went on the serve in the Alabama General Assembly and as a brigadier general of the Alabama militia. He later moved to Lauderdale County, Mississippi and died in Daleville, Mississippi. Jeremiah Austill served as a clerk for the Mobile County Court then moved to a plantation in Clarke County where he died in 1879. James Smith continued to fight in skirmishes during the Creek War then moved to Mississippi prior to his death. No additional historical information is recorded about Caesar. The exact site of the skirmish is unknown. The canoe fight occurred near where Randon's Creek joins the Alabama River. The site where the warriors surrounded the twelve militiamen on the east bank has been confirmed and is located on private property.Braund 2012, p. 263.

Its name was changed again to the Teatro Ponchielli in 1907 after the famous native of Cremona, Amilcare Ponchielli. In 1986 the theatre was purchased by the city of Cremona which renamed it once again as it is known today. The opening performance took place on 4 October and featured performances on the city-owned Stradivarius \\"Il Cremonese\\" and Guarneri \\"del Gesu\\" violins of 1715 and 1734 respectively.

Taxonomy and etymology Examination of the taxonomy of Coenocorypha snipe has been hindered by lack of material, erroneous locality data, misidentified specimens and confused nomenclature.Higgins & Davies (1996). The North Island snipe was described in 1955 by Walter Oliver as a subspecies of the Subantarctic snipe (Coenocorypha aucklandica), but has since been elevated to a full species, with fossil material from the North Island referred to it.Worthy et al. (2002).Baker et al. (2009). The specific epithet and older common name refer to the type locality. Distribution and extinction The North Island snipe is extinct. Its prehistoric distribution comprised the North Island where subfossil remains have been found in several places. It became extinct on the mainland of North Island following the occupation of New Zealand by Polynesians (the ancestors of the MƒÅori people) and the associated introduction of Pacific rats (Rattus exulans). It survived on at least one small island, Little Barrier Island in the Hauraki Gulf, until 1870 where the type (and only existing) specimen was taken.Miskelly (1987). According to Oliver, ‚ÄúAbout 1870 two snipe were seen on Little Barrier Island by Captain Bennett of the schooner Mary Ann. One was captured alive but died in captivity, the other escaped. The captured specimen was presented to the Auckland Museum by Mr T.B. Hill and is the basis of the following account.‚ÄùOliver (1955). Description Oliver described the North Island snipe as being generally similar to other Coenocorypha snipes. He added that it differed from the South Island snipe in the ‚Äúgreater area of buffy white on chin and throat, the absence of bars on the lower abdomen, the crescent-shaped markings on the upper abdomen and the less rufous general coloration‚Äù.

Early life His father, Thomas Hamond Bartholomew, was the chief engineer of the Aire and Calder Navigation, which was the transport hub of the expanding Yorkshire industry based on Leeds, Sheffield and the Yorkshire coalfields, from 1825 to 1853. William was born at Lake Lock, Stanley, West Yorkshire and was appointed as engineer of the company at the age of 22, on the death of his father at a period when the company was generating up to 150% dividends to its shareholders. At the age of 29 he married Maria Wilson with whom he had two daughters and a son. Canal Engineer and Inventor During his time as engineer he oversaw the rebuilding of the navigation with all the locks being lengthened to cope with increased tonnages, an unusual event in British canal history, and paving the way for future increases in the 20th century. As early as 1852 he proposed that steam boats be introduced on the navigation as cargo- carrying tugs and in 1857 he introduced the first two such tugs. In the 1860s he proposed and supervised the expansion of the ship lock at Goole and patented a scheme for compartment boats commonly known as Tom Puddings. This improved the efficiency of carrying coal from the coalfields at Knottingley, eventually allowing 4 men to control 800 tons of cargo. By 1913 there were over 1,000 of these boats in use transporting 1.5m tons of coal annually. He constructed mechanical hoists at Goole so that the contents of the boats could be transferred to ships mechanically, one of the first such transhipment schemes in the world. In the 1880s he carried out the Ouse improvement project, training the banks between Goole and Trent Falls with thousands of tons of stone. The Victoria entrance to Goole docks was opened to take boats up to long. One of his last functions was to direct the construction of the Sheffield and South Yorkshire New Junction Canal between 1896 and 1905.

He was elected in 1870 as a member of the London School Board, and was re-elected in 1873. In 1873http://www.hamfc.co.uk/history.htm? he purchased the large mansion house and estate of Hanworth Park, near London. At the 1885 general election he unsuccessfully contested the new Bermondsey division of Southwark, losing by only 83 votes (1.2% of the total) to the sitting Liberal MP Thorold Rogers. He had been selected by the local Conservative Association in preference to John Dumphreys, who had been put forward as a Conservative working man's candidate. However, he defeated Rogers at the 1886 election, taking the seat with a swing of 3.4%. In 1888, he chaired a committee set up to raise funds for the establishment of a series of South London Polytechnics. The first of the three institutes was Goldsmiths College in New Cross, which opened in 1891, followed in 1892 by the Borough Road Polytechnic, of which Lafone became a governor. By 1892 he had become a Justice of the Peace (JP) for Middlesex, but at the 1892 general election he lost his seat in Parliament to the Liberal Party candidate Reuben Barrow, on a swing of 7.9%. He stood again in 1895, with the active support of the local Liberal Unionist Party. On election day, his campaign was assisted by many loans of carriages, including from the Duke of Norfolk, the Duke of Richmond, the Earl of Yarborough, Lord Iveagh, and Baroness Burdett-Coutts. The sitting Liberal MP, Reuben Barrow, was supported by processions of workingmen, but Lafone regained the seat with a majority of 360 votes (4.4% of the total). Lafone retired from Parliament at the 1900 general election, on account of his \\"advanced age\\"; he was by then 79 years old. Marriage and progeny In 1852 Lafone married Jane Boutcher, daughter of William Boutcher of Grateley in Hampshire. She died on 9 April 1885. Death He died aged 90 on 26 April 1911, at his mansion house Hanworth Park having been ill for about four months.

He designed the core Indian fonts used in Microsoft Windows. Early life Joshi was born into a middle class Indian family. He was brought up in the town of Kolhapur, Maharashtra. He developed an interest in alphabets, their shapes, styles and design. In 1952, he decided to study art at Sir J.J. Institute of Applied Art, Mumbai. During this time he found a scarcity of typefaces in Indian languages. He took up extra classes at the Government Institute of Printing Technology, located within the institute premises, where he learned that Indian typefaces were intricate and had many problems in typesetting. He participated in the first exhibition on Indian typefaces at the college. Professional life His first professional experience was with D.J. Keymer & Co. (now O&M;) in 1956. In 1961, he joined ULKA Advertising (now DraftFCB+Ulka) as Art Director. He started designing campaigns on issues regarding Family Planning and Farmers and to unite the entire country, he designed the campaigns in various Indian languages. His efforts were questioned, but he stuck to his philosophy and thought process. He created some stunning logos including the Welcome Group,http://www.dsource.in/resource/logo-design/logos/classic-logos-india capturing the ethos of an Indian welcome and Punjab National Bank, aptly utilizing the alphabet P in Punjabi. He designed several advertisements for Nerolac Paints and Crompton Greaves using Indian calligraphy, designed exclusive menus for the Taj Group and stationery for Chimanlals.http://www.indianexpress.com/old/ie/daily/19980318/07750664.html He brought the concept of multilingual ad campaigns in India, opening up to languages crossing states. The first ever such campaign was the Ashok Jain Campaign. Tryst with Types Influenced by the books of Italian Masters like Arrighi, he found a new world of calligraphy to explore. He applied it to the Indian context and explored Indic scripts in Calligraphic styles. He studied the rarest manuscripts in Indic languages, of which his inspiration was a book titled Bharatiya Pracheen Lipimala by an Indian Author Ojha. This book brought to him the world of ancient scripts, like Brahmi, Sharda, Kautilya and Gupta scripts. After an intense research on these scripts, in 1966, he designed his first two fonts. One of his challenging works was the design of the Adi Shankaracharya stamp on the occasion of Shankaracharya (Philosopher) Commemoration. There were conflicts about highlighting the picture of the saint, Prof Joshi found the solution as a logo for the philosophy itself of Advaitvad (non-dualism). This stamp was released on 17 May 1989. Teaching Design He was a professor of Calligraphy, Type Design and Typography at IDC, IIT, Mumbai from 1983 - 1996.

He was a pioneer of early treatment for babies with Down syndrome through stimulation and diet. He collaborated on this with Jerome Lejeune, the French geneticist who discovered that Down syndrome is caused by an extra chromosome 21. He was also a campaigner for integrated mainstream education for children with Down syndrome, and against the use of term 'mongolism' to refer to the syndrome. By coincidence, later he and his wife themselves had a child with Down syndrome.  Biography  Brinkworth was born on 25 July 1929 in Eastington, Stonehouse, Gloucestershire. When a small child he became friendly with two adults in the village who had Down syndrome, which influenced his later work. Brinkworth trained as a teacher, his first teaching posts being at a Grammar School in Gloucestershire, a Catholic Secondary School in Birmingham and Turners Green Secondary School for Boys in Birmingham. At the latter he specialised in remedial teaching for students with learning difficulties. He was then appointed as Head of the Remedial Department of Great Barr Comprehensive School in Birmingham. There he developed a theory that many of the problems of pupils with learning difficulties were caused by their inadequate stimulation in infancy.  Career  In 1959 Brinkworth read of the finding by Lejeune that Down syndrome was the result of an extra chromosome At the time, there was much speculation about the relative influence of heredity or environment on children's performance. Brinkworth tested the relative effects of these factors by giving environmental stimulation to very young children with Down syndrome, to see if their performance could be improved and the consequences of their genetic condition counteracted. Brinkworth was already fluent in French, and he had met and married a French woman, Jackie. He contacted Lejeune and began a fruitful collaboration with the French doctor in research into the treatment of children with Down syndrome through environmental means ‚Äì diet and stimulation. By great coincidence, in 1965 Brinkworth and Jackie had a child, whom they named Francoise, born with Down syndrome. Brinkworth then enrolled for a Diploma in Child Psychology course at the University of Birmingham, for which he carried out a controlled experiment. Five babies with Down syndrome were visited for four hours each week for six months, with the parents being given detailed instructions for stimulation and diet. The babies were tested against matched control babies with Down syndrome who had not received the visits, at ages six, twelve and eighteen months. Marked benefit was shown for the babies who had received the visits. The results were written up in Brinkworth's dissertation at the University of Birmingham, 1967, with the title 'The Effects of Early Training on the Mongoloid Infant.' Brinkworth began producing sheets of advice and instructions for exercises to families who contacted him. By 1969 he was in contact with 130 families with babies with Down syndrome. In that year he produced, with Dr. Joseph Collins, a 70-page booklet \\"Improving Mongol Babies,\\" published by the Northern Ireland Region of the National Society for Mentally Handicapped Children (now MENCAP). Use of the word 'Mongol' to describe people with Down syndrome was prevalent at the timet. It derived from the first systematic description of the syndrome in 1867 by Dr John Langdon Down, after whom the syndrome is now named. Down's paper was entitled 'Observations on an Ethnic Classification of Idiots', and attriuted the characteristics of people with Down syndrome to an affinity with a supposed Mongolian ethnic identity. Brinkworth was an outspoken critic of the term.' and he campaigned against its use. Immediately after publishing his booklet he dropped the term, and the Association he founded shortly afterwards was called 'The Down's Babies Association'. Future editions of his booklet were titled 'Improving Babies with Down's Syndrome'. The subtitle of the booklet was' Introducing Them to School. 'At the time (until the 1971 repeal of the 1949 Education Act), children with learning difficulties, including almost those with Down syndrome, were classified as 'unsuitable for education in school'. They were catered for in 'Junior Training Centres' run by Health Authorities. The subtitle of Brinkworth's booklet reflected his belief that children with Down syndrome could and should be educated within mainstream education. Realising the need to formalise his work and have a base to which parents could bring their children for assessment and advice, Brinkworth founded the Down's Babies Association in 1970 with headquarters at Quinborne Community Centre in Birmingham. By 1982 it had a membership of 3,500 families. As the children of the early members grew up, the name was changed first to 'The Down's Children's Association' and later to 'The Down's Syndrome Association.' In the early years, Brinkworth continued to produce what he called 'schedules' of detailed instructions to parents on physical, verbal and social stimulation and on diet, and several further editions of the book were published. Other researchers took up his ideas with similar positive results. Parents have described how valuable his work has been to them. A great boost was given to the work of the Association by a BBC TV programme shown in the Open Door series in 1976. This showed examples of Brinkworth's work and featured his own daughter Francoise. A highly positive image of children with Down syndrome was portrayed, countering the negative picture often painted by the medical profession. A high point in the film is when one of the children says, \\"I like laughing, it‚Äôs like a song to me.\\" Brinkworth ends the film with the words, \\"It‚Äôs not only in his chromosomes that we can call the mongol child the child with something extra.\\" In the early 1980s, Brinkworth established a 'National Centre for Down's Syndrome' at Birmingham Polytechnic. Later, the Association moved its headquarters to London and a Director was appointed, Brinkworth becoming Education Adviser to the Association. He was awarded an MBE for his services to people with Down syndrome and their families. Brinkworth's daughter Francoise developed many skills, passing her driving test, learning to read music and play the piano, becoming fluent in French, and living independently in a flat. In 1986, Brinkworth and Francoise featured on a 30-minute video, being interviewed about their experiences and views under the title Current Perspectives on Down's Syndrome, produced by the Media Resource Centre, Darwin, Australia. Brinkworth was a staunch Roman Catholic and he, like Jerome Lejeune, was vehemently opposed to screening and abortion as a means to prevent Down syndrome. In 1980, Brinkworth was the British representative, along with Lejeune, on a Vatican working party on people with learning difficulties. He helped to draft a speech which Pope John Paul gave for the 1981 International Year of Disabled Persons. Increasing ill health forced Brinkworth's retirement from formal involvement in the Down's Syndrome Association, and he left in 1988. He died after a long period of heart disease on 29 October 1998, aged 69. This is how Brinkworth ends the piece he wrote called 'Towards a full and independent life' for a Down's Children's Association information sheet in 1982: > \\"For those who are cast up as strangers on our shores, we owe a duty of > hospitality and tolerance. Our neighbours, the 'children with something > extra', demand much of their parents in early life, but they have much to > give in return. In enabling them to develop to their fullest potential we > also serve ourselves, as an increasing number of these children grow up to > play a modest but useful part in the life of the nation\\".

The rush to the hills resulted in masses of stones being extracted from the ground to make way for new fields complete with dry stone walls and huts.On the rush to Proven√ßal hills in the 17th and 18th centuries, see Roget Livet, L'habitat rural et les structures agraires en Basse-Provence, th√®se de Lettres, Paris, 1962, Aix-en- Provence, √©d. Ophrys, 1962. The author delves into the case of the region of Saint-Saturnin-l√®s-Apt, a community to the West of Gordes. The potsherds found in the huts and fields during the restoration work of the 1970s are characteristic of the earthenware manufactured in the Apt, Vaucluse, region in the 18th-19th centuries.Pierre Viala, Le village des bories √† Gordes dans le Vaucluse, Ed. Le village des bories, Gordes, 1976, 16 p., p. 4. Building material Group of buildings No 4 as per Pierre Viala‚Äôs classification, with, from left to right, a dwelling with silkworm-breeding facility, a sheep shelter-cum-byre, and a store house. The huts were built using locally extracted, 10 to 15 cm-thick, limestone slabs, going by the name of ‚Äúlauses‚Äù or ‚Äúclapes‚Äù.Christian Lassure, ¬´ Les Cabanes ¬ª √† Gordes (Vaucluse) : architecture et √©dification, in L'architecture vernaculaire rurale, suppl.

Structure and form Out of the 28 stone buildings still extant on the site, * 20 belong to the so-called ‚ÄúGordoise nave‚Äù, i.e. a rectangular or trapezoid edifice in the form of an upturned keel, either free standing or abutting on another edifice, * 3 have a rectangular or square plan, with a corbelled vault in the form of a cupola or a half dome, * 2 have a semi-circular vault of voussoirs as well as a cupola-shaped vault of voussoirs (the two oven houses with their ovens), * 2 have a circular or horse-shoe-shaped plan (ruined buildings), * 1 is a conventional first-floor house under a one-sided roof of canal tiles.Christian Lassure, ¬´ Les Cabanes ¬ª √† Gordes (Vaucluse)..., op. cit.,. ¬´ Classification selon la structure et la morphologie ¬ª, pp. 146-151. The prevalence of the ‚ÄúGordoise nave‚Äù, together with the use of mortarless masonry, lends the hamlet a certain architectural unity.Christian Lassure, ¬´ Les Cabanes ¬ª √† Gordes (Vaucluse)..., 'op. cit., pp. 146-151. . The ‚ÄúGordoise Nave‚Äù Interior of the sheep shelter-cum-byre of Group No 4. Functionally, the ‚ÄúGordoise nave‚Äù appears to have been a multi-purpose edifice used as seasonal dwelling, barn, grain store house, byre, sheep shelter, silkworm house, tool shed, treading house with vat. The buildings‚Äô layout and functions The ‚ÄúVillage des Bories‚Äù comprises several ‚Äúgroups‚Äù of ‚Äúcabanes‚Äù which are distributed across the areas North and South of a lane that runs through the site.Pierre Viala, ¬´ Le village des bories... ¬ª, op. cit., plan p. 3. A ‚Äúgroup‚Äù is to be seen as a reunion of two or more edifices, either abutting against, or adjoining, one another, or in proximity, usually round a small yard. It would be wrong, however, to think that each group belonged to a single family. A study of the Napoleonic and modern land registers has shown that some groups did belong to two separate owners or that the same person could own one building in a group and another building in another group.Christian Lassure, ¬´ Les Cabanes ¬ª √† Gordes (Vaucluse)..., op. cit., note 6, pp. 158-159. The site also contains two threshing yards but no wells or water storage tanks (the nearest well, 100 metres away from the centre of the grouping, is dry).Pierre Viala, ¬´ Le village des bories... ¬ª, op. cit., p. 4. Witnesses to Proven√ßal agricultural history Based on an analysis of the buildings‚Äô functions, the evidence provided by both land registers, the testimonies of Gordes villagers, and vestigial tree stumps, cereals (wheat, rye) were grown in the area in the 19th century, along with olive, almond and mulberry trees (the latter for silkworm rearing) and vines. There was also a cottage industry of leather sole making.Pierre Viala, ¬´ Le village des bories... ¬ª, op. cit., p. 10. Also, some stone huts may have belonged to people living in a nearby village other than Gordes, a pattern that was not uncommon in the Provence of old.Considering that harvesting and threshing in the early 20th century required 12 days‚Äô work, being the owner of a ‚Äúcabanon‚Äù (small hut), ‚Äúgrangeon‚Äù (small barn) or ‚Äúbastidon‚Äù (small building) in an outlying plot of land, was no small advantage for a ‚Äúforain‚Äù (outsider).

The site claims that the ‚ÄúVillage des Bories‚Äù has been ‚Äúinhabited continuously for something like 3000 years, with the bories dating as far back as the Bronze age‚Äù although the claim is not borne out by historical and archaeological research.

He was the leader of Clyde Lucas and His California Dons.  Early years  Lucas grew up in Los Angeles, California and was of \\"Chicano\\" (American Mexican) background. He began his career as a singer and trombonist in the Herb Wiedoeft orchestra, and launched his own band in the early 1930s. The band was versatile, playing a range of styles including popular Mexican tunes, Swing, Hawaiian and Hillbilly. The typical line-up at that time included four saxophones, two trumpets and a four-piece rhythm section, often with violins. Musicians were expected to be able to play more than one instrument. In 1934, the Morrison Hotel and the Terrace Garden, both in Chicago, employed Lucas and his Dons. As the thirties progressed, \\"Clyde Lucas and his California Dons\\" grew in popularity, releasing records and playing on the radio. The band also recorded background music for some of the early talkies. In September 1938, Paramount Pictures released an 11-minute movie \\"short\\" called Lights, Action, Lucas, featuring the band. Other headliner shorts released around this time included Listen to Lucas (1938), Meet the Maestros (1938) and Clyde Lucas and His Orchestra (1939)  1940s  Gloria Wood, a popular singer from the 1940s through to the 1970s made her first recordings with the Clyde Lucas band. Singles released for Elite Records in 1941 included Sometimes and Somebody nobody knows, with flip sides Rose O'Day and When roses bloom again. Other singles from Elite that year included Shrine of St. Cecelia, I said No and Deep in the Heart of Texas. In 1942 Lucas released a cover of Glenn Miller's A string of pearls, but reviews were not favorable. The band did not appeal to every musical taste. One radio announcer \\"accidentally\\" said \\"You are listening to the mucous of Clyde Lucas\\". However, in 1943 Billboard Magazine reported that Lucas had abandoned the schmaltzy California Dons, with its strong violin section, and was now heading a more modern swing ensemble. The band was still heavy on brass, with five saxophones and five other brass instruments besides rhythm and drums. A newcomer to the scene named Loren Helberg was featured as a tenor sax soloist, and the vocalist Teeny Riley had replaced Patty Ross. The band continued to play in hotels and at balls through the 1940s. Lucas's band played in the July 1941 Police Ball and Reception in Troy, New York. In September 1942 the band was playing at the Hotel Claridge in Memphis, Tennessee and getting good reviews. In September 1943 the band was at the Tune Town Ballroom in St. Louis, Missouri. In December 1945 the band was playing the Biltmore Hotel in Providence, Rhode Island. The band eventually disbanded towards the end of the forties.

Career  Born , Constantine Angelos Doukas was a son of Isaac Angelos Doukas, and hence a grandson of Constantine Angelos and first cousin of the Byzantine emperor Isaac II Angelos (). The name or origin of his mother is unknown. In 1192/93, Isaac II named him fleet commander (doux tou stolou) and governor of Philippopolis, an area then suffering from the ongoing Vlach‚ÄìBulgarian rebellion. The contemporary historian Niketas Choniates writes favourably of Constantine, noting that he was able to train his troops well and to command loyalty from them, and that although naturally impetuous \\"in the manner of lion cubs\\", he was also willing to listen and be restrained by the advice of the more experienced professionals placed under his command. Constantine was able to check the rebels' raids against the region of Philippopolis and Berrhoe, so that the rebels \\"cowered in fear of him and were more panic-stricken at the sight of him than of the emperor\\". His success on the battlefield emboldened Constantine, however, and he started aiming to usurp the throne. He began sounding out his subordinate commanders and other men of prominent birth from the wider region, and had himself proclaimed emperor. Immediately he set out with his supporters for Adrianople, seat of his brother-in-law, the Grand Domestic of the West, Basil Vatatzes. Evidently trusting that Vatatzes would join him, Constantine sent ahead letters informing his brother-in-law of his actions. Vatatzes, however, rejected Constantine's actions as folly and refused to join him. The usurper reached , at the border between the provinces of Philippopolis and Adrianople, but there his own supporters seized him and took him prisoner. Constantine's followers handed him over to the emperor, claiming that they had been pressured into supporting his usurpation against their will. Isaac II harboured his doubts about their sincerity, but chose to overlook their part in the failed uprising. In the end, only Constantine was punished, by being blinded. According to Choniates, this deed greatly encouraged the Bulgarian rebels, who had feared Constantine's ability and much preferred the ineffective Isaac II to remain on the throne, if possible, for ever. Constantine's subsequent fate, or whether he was married and had any offspring, is unknown.

He studied at Clarendon House School and graduated from the University of London in 1868. At the age of 22, he worked with Thomas Henry Huxley in Huxley's zoological demonstrations, forming a teaching collection and organising laboratory practicals. Huxley's work on crayfish kindled in Parker an interest in crustaceans, and he went on to study the marine \\"crayfish\\" (spiny lobsters) of New Zealand, together with his student Josephine Gordon Rich, who later married William Aitcheson Haswell. On 23 December 1874, Thomas Jeffery Parker married Charlotte Elizabeth Rossell in Bramley, Yorkshire. In 1880, they emigrated to New Zealand. Parker become Professor of Zoology at the University of Otago in Dunedin, succeeding Frederick Hutton.

Parker Fin whale displayed in Otago Museum 2010 Parker sent a display of a series of skulls to the Melbourne International Exhibition in 1880, which was later reused in the New Zealand and South Seas Exhibition in Dunedin. The display used coloured wires and painted bones to show the evolution of the vertebrate skull. Indeed, Parker was noted by a Tuapeka Times correspondent as having a \\"mania for skeletons...[and] has procured some splendid and interesting specimens of birds and fish.\\" In 1883, Parker obtained a fin whale specimen from Captain William Jackson Barry, who had himself bought and exhibited it in Nelson. The fin whale skeleton is still a central feature of the current Maritime Gallery. Parker was made a Fellow of the Royal Society on 7 June 1888. In his later years, Parker suffered from diabetes, and he died on 7 November 1897 at Warrington. After his death, Parker was succeeded at the University of Otago by William Blaxland Benham. Works Parker produced more than 40 scientific papers. They include nine papers on moas published between 1889 and 1895, and a 100-page monograph on the history of the kiwi, which was later condensed into two articles in the New Zealand Journal of Science. Parker identified a new species of sea cucumber (Chirodota dunedinensis, now Taeniogyrus dunedinensis) soon after arriving in Dunedin.

He invented a Murata's method for the serodiagnosis of syphilis, and studied leprosy. He worked at the Osaka Prefectural Sotojima Sanatorium and was the director between 1926 and 1933. He treated leprosy patients as respectable persons. After the Sotojima Incident, in which communists were against religious societies, he resigned as the director of the sanatorium. Later, he personally studied leprosy at his house, and died in 1974. Life He was born in K≈çchi Prefecture in 1884. When he was studying laws, he was interested in leprosy since a woman he knew developed leprosy. He asked Kensuke Mitsuda for advice, and studied medicine at Tokyo University following his advice. He worked in the Institute of Infectious Diseases and invented Murata's method for serodiagnosis of syphilis. In 1926 he assumed the post of the director of Osaka Prefectural Sotojima Sanatorium. In 1928, he was one of the founders of the Japanese Leprosy Association, together with Mitsuda.Hosaku Sakurai: In memory of Masataka Murata, Lepra 44, 1, 1975. The Sotojima Incident and the Typhoon Muroto When Murata assumed the post of director, the sanatorium was a troubled place riddled with gambling, and the public morals were very low. First he improved the meals (daily cost improved from 13 sen to 22 sen) and allowed some patient control. In 1932, communism arose in the sanatorium, and his attitude toward the autonomy of patients was mistaken for his favoring communism. After severe questioning by the police, he decided to quit in 1933. Later he studied leprosy, without taking up any post. He released communists giving each person 10 yen for peace. In 1934, the sanatorium met the very severe Muroto typhoon, and many patients and workers died. Survivors were sent to other sanatoriums, and the new Oku-Komyoen Sanatorium was established in 1938 in Nagashima neighboring the Nagashima Aiseien Sanatorium, the successor to the Sotojima Hoyoen.

V. Burlingham was a British coachbuilding business based in Blackpool, Lancashire from 1928 until 1960 when they were taken over by London-based rivals Duple Motor Bodies. Duple initially renamed Burlingham as Duple (Northern) but in 1969 they closed their Hendon factory and concentrated production in Blackpool. Duple coach bodies were built in the former Burlingham premises until Duple itself was liquidated in 1989. History=Beginnings Herbert Victor Burlingham moved to Blackpool in 1928 and after deciding to set up as a coachbuilder initially leased premises in Bloomfield Road and Bond Street in Blackpool. Like rivals Thomas Harrington Ltd in Hove and Plaxton in Scarborough, H. V. Burlingham understood that a seaside resort offered advantages for the highly seasonal trade in luxury coach bodies in that the workforce were able to take other jobs during the summer when there was no work for them building coaches. General coach building was the initial purpose of Mr Burlingham's business and the first body constructed was a van for a local butcher but coach bodies were soon the company's main product, initially of the 'all weather' style common at the time which comprised a steel-reinforced wooden frame panelled in aluminium with windows capable of winding fully down and a full length folding canvas roof. An option common on many builders' coaches at the time was a luggage rack mounted on the rear of the roof, but Burlingham were early in offering coaches fitted with a toilet compartment, which was a long way from being the standard fitment in long distance coaches it is now. Burlingham coaches soon began to make a name for themselves and unlike many coachbuilders of the period whose clientele was very localised, Burlingham were soon selling not only to Lancashire coach firms but to Scottish Motor Traction of Edinburgh, Walter Alexander of Stirling and Glenton Tours of London amongst others. Output in these early years kept outgrowing factory space, and in 1929 the original sites were relinquished in favour of a workshop in Bank Road, Marton, which was used until 1931. A factory was constructed at Preston New Road on the outskirts of the town in late 1929. After the Marton workshop was sold further premises were bought in Newhouse Road, these being used both to build components and to repair and recondition bodies. Under new ownership In 1930 Herbert Victor Burlingham, who had been a sole trader, decided to sell the business to two local businessmen, Richard Eaves and Harry Lowcock. They set up H. V. Burlingham Ltd on 25 November 1930 with a registered share capital of ¬£26,000. after which H. V. Burlingham himself set up in business as a caravan manufacturer in Garstang. Mr Eaves became the managing director and took great pride in motivating the design team. Styles were developed into the era of the saloon coach often now fully enclosed, windows only dropping to half depth and a sliding aluminium or folding canvas roof section optional. Pioneering styling features often appeared on Burlingham designs, including the use of curved sightseeing windows above the main windows. By the end of 1931 there was again pressure on space so a further site was acquired at Vicarage Lane. This was used for body assembly and from then until eventual closure finishing was undertaken at the Preston New Road factory, which also manufactured sub assemblies. Once Vicarage Lane came on stream Newhouse Road was solely devoted to servicing existing bodies. To extend business bus bodies were also offered. Among the first were a batch of central-entrance 33-seaters on Leyland Lion chassis for Blackpool Corporation. By the time of the 1932 sales brochure double-deck designs had been prepared, Blackpool Corporation again being the first customer, taking four rear entrance 48-seaters in that year. By 1935 Blackpool Corporation and Burlingham had developed streamlined fully fronted centre-entrance bodies, single- and double-deck, open- and closed-top, which were as futuristic as the corporation's English Electric and Brush tramcars. Also in 1935 the first export Burlingham bodies are reported for an Egyptian customer, and also that year a batch of very conservative- looking bodies were constructed for John Fishwick & Sons of Leyland. These were on Leyland Titan TD4 chassis and were to the Leyland outline as produced on Titan from 1929 to 1932, incorporating Leyland components. In following years Fishwick were persuaded to take a more modern outline as built for Ribble. Among the more radical coaches of the time was a 25-seater on a normal-control Leyland Cub chassis for Marshall of Blackpool, which had a streamlined near-full width bonnet with concealed radiator, similar in shape to the Chrysler Airflow car. Duple had used a similar idea on a special airmail van for the Royal Mail (famous as a Dinky Toy) a year or so before the Marshall's coach but were never to apply the style to a coach body. Another mid-1930s design to give coachbuilders a chance to be creative was the Maudslay SF40, with its set-back front axle and design for modern full-width bodywork. Burlingham produced a number of very flamboyant styles on this body. Like Duple, Burlingham were prepared to build to practically any outline the customer requested, and as a result in 1939 Duple were building (1936) Burlingham outline coaches on Bristol chassis for Black and White Motorways whilst Burlingham built to (1937) Duple outlines on Bedfords for Bournemouth Corporation in 1938 and 1939. Among trademark Burlingham features however were ornate shaped window frames and the use of decorative stained glass work, often used when toilet compartments were fitted to coaches but also used to illuminate the stairwells of the pre-war Blackpool centre-entrance double- deckers. From 1937‚Äì8 a revised coach style began to evolve with no canopy over the bonnet of half cabs and a near semi-circular window to the sliding forward entry door with the main applied decoration a slim curved side-flash, the whole coach curving gracefully in the idiom of the post-1936 Duple design, but being distinctively Burlingham in its sharper details, and especially in its rear aspect which was v-shaped in plan about the centre-line of the divided rear window. This was adapted to suit normal control chassis such as the Austin K4 and even used in a centre-entrance version on the Maudslay SF40 but, like the contemporary Duple style it was to become better known after World War Two. In wartime By the end of 1940 Burlingham were instructed to cease coach building and concentrate on war work. For the duration Preston New Road works and the assembly shop at Vicarage Lane were to produce airframe assemblies for Vickers Wellington medium bombers, which were assembled at a Vickers shadow factory on the site of today's Blackpool Airport. As well as this work the Newhouse Road workshop built mobile canteens on Austin chassis for the armed forces and produced a limited number of utility-design bodies for half-cab single-deckers. Although such chassis were not produced under the utility scheme some chassis were assembled from remaining stock parts or from export orders impossible to deliver, and in 1941-2 Burlingham built bus bodies for 15 such chassis and in 1943-5 again built bodies to replace worn out or war-damaged ones. Customers included Barton Transport, East Kent and United Automobile Services. During early 1945, before other coachbuilders, Burlingham were allowed to reintroduce compound curvature to the rear-dome of its bus body designs, as it had a crude, but effective, pressing machine for this task, unlike other coachbuilders, who required skilled panel beaters to do the work. Post war prosperity Like all other coachbuilders, Burlingham had a bulging order book at the end of the War, many operators having placed orders for completion as soon as peacetime conditions applied. The first post-war coach was completed in January 1946 and was very similar to the 1939 design, but featured an extra window pillar in each body side. Burlingham was justifiably cautious. as adequately seasoned timber for framing was very hard to obtain at the time. During 1946, a standard single-deck and double-deck bus body was introduced. The double-decker was basically the Ribble-type pre-war outline, whilst the single-decker could be best described as the utility frame re-clothed with traditional refinements such as compound curvature on front and rear domes and outswept skirt panels. Output of all three types was large, with many operators, such as Ribble and Walter Alexander, not only buying new chassis (for which a substantial waiting list had built up) but also sending pre-war vehicles to Burlingham for new bodies. By late in 1948, Burlingham was able to begin to move away from its enforced policy of rigid standardisation, helped by a couple of longstanding and influential customers. Local British Electric Traction subsidiary Ribble Motor Services was responsible for the largest share of inter-urban routes in Lancashire, and wished to make more efficient use of its crews on limited-stop services running from the great industrial conurbations in the South, Centre and East of the county, to the seaside resorts in the West. As a result, they commissioned a double-deck lowbridge coach body with 49 seats on 30 Leyland Titan PD1/3 chassis, to the newly authorised 8-foot width. These had full fronts, electrically operated platform doors and coach trim, as well as luxury seating; the outline was generously curved, as were the window outlines. These became famous as the first of Ribble's 'White Lady' coaches. Ribble also took the same outline but with a half cab and 53 bus seats for service duties over the next few years. Scottish Motor Traction, seeking to publicise the return of peacetime standards on its Edinburgh-London coach service, chose a special Burlingham body for display at the 1948 Commercial Motor Show. This was mounted on the new AEC Regal III coach chassis and had a full front, with the AEC radiator hidden behind a chrome grille arrangement, the whole front of the coach tapering in plan, so that a single full-width windscreen with opening upper section could be fitted, rather than the traditional vertically divided style (as on pre-war fully fronted designs). The ensemble was completed by bulbous front and rear wings and a pair of low-set rectangular headlights. No other bodies were quite like that show coach, but it pointed the way to the future. Incidentally, SMT took Ribble-style double-deck bodies from Burlingham on 20 AEC Regent III chassis in 1950, which incorporated Ribble's post-war style of destination and number-blind glazing, to an irregular hexagonal outline ‚Äì basically a triangle with the corners chopped off. This style of destination glazing spread over the next few years to become the double-deck standard throughout the Scottish Bus Group until the 1980s. By mid-1949 further bespoke styles were being built. Burlingham had not built trolleybus bodies during the boom in popularity of such vehicles in the 1930s, but received a contract from Portsmouth Corporation to body 15 British United Traction (BUT) 9611T two-axle vehicles in 1949. These followed the operator's ideas on appearance and were generally less bold in outline than the Ribble-style double-deckers, but the operator's idea of enclosing the support gantries for the trolley-booms inside the roof-structure resulted in a top-heavy look, whilst the plentifully lined- out livery and features like an offside destination indicator added to their archaic aspect. In contrast, the pre-war Blackpool Corporation/Burlingham style double-decker was actually in advance of much of what had been produced until this time and Blackpool waited until 1949 for chassis, so it could get what it wanted from Leyland. This was a unique variant of the Titan PD2 with 8-foot width, air brakes, a straight frame rather than a dropped frame aft of the axle and modified positioning of equipment, and a re-profiled nearside frame member, to especially adapt all 100 of this Titan PD2/5 sub-type for their Burlingham fully fronted centre-entrance bodies. These were, though wider, similar to the final pre-war examples of the style in having powered sliding entrance doors and concealed radiators but omitting the stained glass illumination of the stairwell. Similar options were now offered on the standard coach, becoming available in two widths, with a full front that kept the traditional radiator outline, or in the case of the Foden the manufacturer's grille, or in a version with a decorative frontage like the SMT show coach, but with wider cab front and normal glazing. SMT took some half- cab bodies on pre-war Leyland Tiger and AEC Regal chassis, with full canopies over the half-cab to display a bus-style destination aperture. The majority of Burlingham coaches went on the full-sized heavyweight half-cab coaches of the day, but some bodies were built on the normal-control Commer Commando and Leyland Comet models. Not everyone took to the new Ribble style, so for some customers a version of the pre-war Ribble outline was kept available until the early 1950s. Salford Corporation took aspects of the 'white lady' design and hybridised them with features of their standard post-war body, the resultant bodies combining straight staircases and other Salford body features with the generously radiused windows that were becoming a Burlingham trademark. Unlike Thomas Harrington Ltd, Metro Cammell Weymann, Saunders-Roe or Duple, Burlingham did not build up an extensive export trade. In 1950, a batch of Leyland Tiger LOPS4/3s went to the operator of the Cordoba-Roasario-Buenos Aires express service in Argentina; these showed only a few Burlingham details in their fully fronted straight-waisted coachwork. The only other export customer was the Johannesburg municipality, who took some old-style highbridge double-deck bodies on Daimler chassis in 1951. The Argentinean coaches did, however, break important new ground for Burlingham, in that they used all- steel rather than steel-reinforced ash framing. Metal framing was to be a major facet of Burlingham's new range of bodies for the new underfloor-engined single-deckers such as the Royal Tiger and the AEC Regal IV. The coach with the bird on the side At the 1950 Earls Court Show Burlingham had two new coach designs on Royal Tiger and AEC Regal IV chassis, both shown with a luxury 37-seat seating plan in their central-entrance bodies, when 39 or 41 would have been the more likely choice of all but the most-upmarket customers. The designs were related, having similar detailing and windscreens, and an identical cast chromium-plated frontal motif, but the AEC had traditional teardrop-shape wheel-arch mouldings and a straight waist rail with vertical window pillars, whilst the Leyland had a curved waist rail, window pillars angled back from the vertical and an ellipsoid moulding sweeping from the front to the rear of the coach; this feature was known internally as the 'tank panel' because of its resemblance in shape to a World War One tank. This second coach was finished in the livery of its customer Woods of Blackpool, who traded as Seagull Coaches. Show visitors asked Burlingham for the style with the seagull on the side, and this (despite some chagrin at Woods) soon evolved into the marque name for the style. The previous body was still available for vertical-engined heavyweights but also to the new 30 ft length, and only in full-front form, with the tank-panel and front chrome motif as options. 1951 would be last season of a style with its origins in the late 1930s. For the Seagull, though, it was the start of a prosperous decade. In 1994 it came second in the Classic Bus reader poll to find the most attractive coach body style of all time. It was by far the most successful type of coach body for the early underfloor-engined chassis, selling well on Royal Tiger, Regal IV and Daimler Freeline chassis, Daimler choosing the Seagull style for LKV218, its coach demonstrator. Two were also fitted to Foden rear-engined coaches. From 1952 variants were introduced for vertical-engined chassis, starting with a style for the initial Bedford SB, a 35-seat version with a lengthened rear overhang. Shortly afterwards Scottish Omnibuses (as SMT had become) requested a version to fit Bedford OB chassis converted to forward control; these were known as 'baby Seagulls' and went to SOL and its Highland Omnibuses subsidiary. SOL also took Seagulls to rebody formerly half-cab AEC Regal IIIs. Others who ordered very large numbers of the style were Ribble and many other BET group members and independent coach operators, the largest customer from that sector being Wallace Arnold. A small Wiltshire Coachbuilders, Heaver of Durrington who were best known for Albion Victor buses supplied to Guernsey Railways and Guernsey Motors, constructed two 'NewMark' coaches in 1953 on a Leyland Royal Tiger and in 1955 on a Daimler Freeline, these being a near exact copy of the Seagull. 1950s buses Burlingham also produced a service bus body for the new chassis; this had a simple outline but generally came with the brightwork motif on the front and with optional chrome trim strips along the sides. Among the stranger examples were a batch for Bournemouth Corporation in 1953, which had a double-deck- style open rear entrance and a front exit with doors. The open platform did not work well with an underfloor-engined bus and as in Sheffield, Edinburgh, Pontypridd and West Bromwich, the Bournemouth buses were converted to front entrance layout. Manchester Corporation started a spell as a Burlingham customer with the purchase of a batch of split-level coaches for its airport service: the first six were on Leyland Royal Tiger chassis in 1953 and, like the contemporary British European Airways' AEC Regal IVs, carried the roof line from the raised rear passenger section through to the front of the bus. Of this batch three were completed at Blackpool and the other three were sent as framed chassis to be finished by S. H. Bond of Wythenshawe. Three similar bodies came on Tiger Cub chassis in 1956. Manchester then took double-deck bodies which were similar to the mid-1950s Ribble outline but highbridge with a more upright front to fit the maximum number of seats in a 27-foot-long bus. These were taken on 62 BUT 9612T trolleybuses and 80 Daimler CVG6 and Leyland Titan PD2 buses. Ribble's mid-1950s design had a sliding rear platform door. After the large order in 1949/50 Blackpool took no more new buses until 1956, when it took five rear-entrance Titans with full fronts. These were highbridge with open platform but of similar styling to the Ribble vehicles. The single- deck body was developed for lighter-weight underfloor-engined chassis such as the Leyland Tiger Cub, AEC Reliance and Guy Arab LUF from 1953. For urban operators starting to experiment with driver-only operation a centre exit door was optionally available, this was specified by Sunderland and Reading Corporation amongst others. In 1956 double-deckers were allowed to be as long as single-deckers (30 ft or 9.2m), and a double-decker could now seat 72. Ribble were immediately attracted to the idea and placed 105 Burlingham 72-seat highbridge bodies on Titan PD3/4 chassis into service during 1957/58. These had full fronts and a sliding entry door just behind the front wheel. Wolverhampton Corporation took one identical body on a Guy Arab IV whilst another but with half-cab and exposed radiator went to Samuel Morgan of Armthorpe Yorkshire. Scout Motor Services bought 5 PD3s similar to the Ribble models in 1958/59 but with half-cabs, these buses passing to Ribble upon their purchase of the Scout business in 1961. Sunderland District Omnibus Co took a batch of 13 rear-entrance exposed-radiator Titan PD3 in 1958, and Western SMT took lowbridge rear-entrance tin-front PD3s in 1960 these were the last double-deck motorbus bodies built in Blackpool. The single-deck bus body styles began to diverge from the mid fifties with some operators such as Sheffield Transport looking for more coach-like vehicles while Reading sought a design better suited to moving large numbers of standing passengers. Before the end of Burlingham's independence, there was an important development with trolleybuses, as Glasgow Corporation ordered a batch of ten single-deck 50-seaters on BUT RETB1 chassis. These were Burlingham's only electrically powered single-deckers and the longest single-deckers yet seen in Britain. Diminishing returns Burlingham sought to facelift the Seagull every two years or so to keep up with rival coach builders but every time a change was introduced some of the original purity of line went with it. Whilst late Seagulls on Reliance or Tiger Cub chassis could still look good, the Seagull Mk 7 was launched at the 1958 motor show but only 20 were built on underfloor heavyweight chassis, the versions for Bedford SB, Commer Avenger or Ford Thames Trader PSVs began to assume a very strange appearance, the strangest perhaps being the version known internally as 'The Pig' which was fitted with a shallow two-piece wrap-around windscreen. Launched in 1958, it was at the limits of glazing technology, yet less than a year later Plaxton and Duple had designs with deeper and better looking windscreens supplied by the same company. Burlingham realised there was nowhere left to take the style, which by now had reverted to steel reinforced timber frames for the lightweights and from 1959 launched a new range of bodies. These were the Seagull 60 for front- engined lightweights and the Seagull 70 for underfloor-engined chassis. By August 1960, Duple Motor Bodies Limited had acquired 100% of the share capital of H. V. Burlingham Ltd at a price of ¬£550,000. Afterlife Although H. V. Burlingham was renamed Duple (Northern), existing body designs continued to be sold under the Burlingham name, these included more Reliance standee buses for Reading, a final batch of double-deck trolleybuses on Sunbeam F4A to a forward entrance design, also for Reading and two restyles of the body for lightweight coaches, the Seagull 61 and the Gannett. After that, some further Blackpool designs were introduced, primarily the Continental, Alpine Continental and the Firefly/Dragonfly, but these were badged as Duple (Northern) Products. Burlingham had ceased to be. Preservation Examples of Burlingham Buses and coaches survive in preservation, including most marks of Seagull (including at least one 'pig') TBS21, one of the Glasgow single-deck trolleybuses is about to take its place in Glasgow's brand new Riverside Transport Museum when it opens in spring 2011. The Ribble Vehicle Preservation Trust have 1955 PD2/12 1467 under restoration and 1957 PD3/4 1523 in their care. Scale models Corgi have produced the Seagull in both 1/50 and 1/76 scales. There have also been white metal kits of the Manchester, Reading and Glasgow trolleybus styles and the final Ribble Titan outline. And a 1/76 kit of the postwar single deck bus is also available. Oxford Die Cast are to make the sun saloon full-fronted vertical-engined coach style available in 1.148 scale during 2011. On Screen The 1980s Miss Marple series in an episode called Sleeping Murder featured a fictitious coach firm called Daffodil Coaches, its fleet included a preserved Bournemouth Corporation Tiger PS2. In a novel In Jasper Fforde's 2007 comic novel First Among Sequels. The heroine of the novel, Thursday Next, finds herself in the laboratories of her arch-enemy, the industrial monolith Goliath Corporation who decided they would develop a vehicle to transport coach parties of rich tourists into novels: \\"In the centre of the room and looking resplendent in the blue and yellow livery of some forgotten bus company was a flat-fronted single deck coach that to my mind dated from the fifties‚Ä¶ \\"Why base it on an old coach?\\" I asked‚Ä¶ \\"If you're going to travel, do it in style.

I looked up. Above the vertically-split windscreen was a glass-covered panel that once told prospective passengers the ultimate destination of the bus. I expected it to read 'Bournemouth' or 'Portsmouth' but it didn't. It read: 'Northanger Abbey'‚Ä¶ \\"The Austen Rover is a standard Leyland Tiger PS2/3 under a Burlingham body,\\" she began, touching the coachwork fondly, \\"but with a few‚Ä¶modifications.

The associated multiple rocket launcher was known as the 7.3 cm F√∂hn-Ger√§t.  Design  The Henschel Hs 297 F√∂hn was intended to be used in large barrages to defend targets against low- flying ground attack aircraft. Several launchers were also found at likely river crossing sites at Satzvoy, Unkel and Hahn to provide ground fire. The use of dual-purpose sights on the launchers confirms this role. For mass deployment in the Volkssturm, the launcher was officially termed the Volk-Fla- R-Werfer - an abbreviation of Volkssturm-Flugabwehr-Raketenwerfer (\\"Volkssturm anti-aircraft rocket launcher\\"). By February 1945 fifty units were delivered, which were provided to troops for testing. Twenty-four of the launcher racks were assigned to the 3./FlakLehruVersAbt 900 (o) (\\"3rd Anti-Aircraft Training and Testing Division\\") in the Remagen area and were used for the first time on 2 March 1945 against Allied fighter-bombers. A few days later, after American forces captured the Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen, some of the launchers (classified as secret) fell intact into the hands of the Americans. The specimens found were either emplaced statically, with the pedestal bolted to a foundation or were mounted on a circular folding platform which was carried on a two-wheeled trailer. The projector could be fired from the trailer, but its traverse was limited. To achieve full 360¬∞ of traverse it was necessary to remove the launcher from the trailer, support it on the jacks, then unfold the circular platform and fasten the pedestal to the foundation. The elevation scale was marked from -10¬∞ to +90¬∞ but the launchers that were evaluated post- war could not be depressed below 0¬∞ or elevated above +30¬∞. An elevating hand- wheel controlled both the launch rack and sight with the two moving in unison. The launcher could also be locked in both traverse and elevation. Two styles of sights were provided; the main sight was a pivoting-ring type that was graduated for both ground and anti-aircraft targets. While the secondary sight was an open sight with a rear V notch and triangular front post sight. The range limits were for anti-aircraft use or for ground fire.German and Japanese Solid-Fuel Rocket Weapons, pg.27-28 & 50 The launcher consisted of a square framework holding 35 launch racks, a pedestal mount with a shielded operators station, plus traverse and elevation mechanisms. The launch racks were supported on pipes which run both horizontally and vertically and are fitted to a metal framework trunnioned to two vertical arms extending upwards from the pedestal base. Each launch rack was provided with a firing pin for a percussion cap which ignited its rocket. A single cocking handle on the left- rear of the launcher cocked all 35 firing pins and all rockets were launched at the same with no provision for single fire. Two safety devices were provided; the first was a button on the trigger handle which had to be released before the weapon could be fired, the second was a safety lever on the rear of the racks which when set to safe caused a metal surface to block the trigger linkage.  Rockets  The Raketen Sprenggranate was a spin- stabilized rocket with a length of and a weight of . The projectile was similar to the 7.3 cm Propagandawerfer 41 but instead of being filled with propaganda leaflets the Raketen Sprenggranate had an explosive warhead with dual fuzes. The first fuze was a nose-mounted percussion fuze that would explode on contact with a target while the secondary fuze was a time-delayed base fuze that was initiated during ignition of the rocket motor. When the fuze burnt out it would flash through an orifice in the base of the warhead which would detonate the main charge. The warhead for the rocket was ogival in shape and was threaded internally to receive the rocket motor. The explosive filling was a preformed charge of of RDX/TNT/wax pressed in a block and wrapped in wax paper. The rocket motor consisted of a cylindrical body and a cup-shaped base plate. The body was screwed into the warhead at the forward end and into the base plate at the rear. The body contained a single stick of solid fuel propellant which was ignited by a percussion cap which fit in a pocket drilled in the center of the base plate. Exhaust gasses were forced through seven straight inner venturis and seven angled outer venturis which imparted spin. In addition to its anti-aircraft and surface to surface roles the Raketen Sprenggranate also armed the Bachem Ba 349 Natter manned vertical take-off rocket interceptor. Twenty-four rockets were housed in the Ba 349's nose-cone. It is believed the Ba 349 was never used in combat, though the rocket weapon system was extensively ground-tested.

When used to describe aircraft radio cockpit radio systems, the control panel is often called the radio head. In wireless system technologies such as GSM, CDMA, UMTS, LTE the radio equipment is remote to the BTS/NodeB/eNodeB. The equipment is used to extend the coverage of a BTS/NodeB/eNodeB in challenging environments such as rural areas or tunnels. They are generally connected to the BTS/NodeB/eNodeB via a fiber optic cable using Common Public Radio Interface protocols. CableFree 4G/5G Remote Radio Head (RRH) with 2x2 MIMO, 2x20W RF power and CPRI fibre interface RRHs have become one of the most important subsystems of today's new distributed base stations. The RRH contains the base station's RF circuitry plus analog-to-digital/digital-to-analog converters and up/down converters. RRHs also have operation and management processing capabilities and a standardized optical interface to connect to the rest of the base station. This will be increasingly true as LTE and WiMAX are deployed. Remote radio heads make MIMO operation easier; they increase a base station's efficiency and facilitate easier physical location for gap coverage problems. RRHs will use the latest RF component technology including Gallium nitride (GaN) RF power devices and envelope tracking technology within the RRH RF power amplifier (RFPA).http://www.abiresearch.com/research/product/1008995-remote-radio-heads/ RRH protection in fiber to the antenna systems Fourth generation (4G) and beyond infrastructure deployments will include the implementation of Fiber to the Antenna (FTTA) architecture. FTTA architecture has enabled lower power requirements, distributed antenna sites, and a reduced base station footprint than conventional tower sites. The use of FTTA will promote the separation of power and signal components from the base station and their relocation to the top of the tower mast in a Remote Radio Head (RRH). According to the Telcordia industry standard that establishes generic requirements for Fiber to the Antenna (FTTA) protection GR-3177,GR-3177, Generic Requirements for Remote Radio Head Protection Used in Fiber to the Antenna (FTTA) Systems, Telcordia. the RRH shifts the entire high-frequency and power electronic segments from the base station to a location adjacent to the antenna. The RRH will be served by optical fiber and DC power for the optical-to-electronic conversion at the RRH. RRHs located on cell towers will require Surge Protective Devices (SPDs) to protect the system from lightning strikes and induced power surges. There is also a change in electrical overstress exposure due to the relocation of the equipment from the base station to the top of the mast. Protection from lightning damage RRHs can be installed in a low-profile arrangement along a rooftop, or can involve a much higher tower arrangement. When installed at the highest point on a structure (whether a building or a dedicated cell tower), they will be more vulnerable to receiving a direct lightning strike and higher induced lightning levels, compared with those installed in a lower profile manner below the upper edges of the building. As noted in GR-3177, while surges can be induced into the RRH wiring for lightning striking the nearby rooftop or even the base station closure, the worst case will occur when a direct strike occurs to the antenna or its supporting structure. Designing the electrical protection to handle this situation will provide protection for less damaging scenarios... it can also be use in optical fiber communication but different type.

On October 8, 2013, Animation Arts announced that a sequel for Lost Horizon is in development. Lost Horizon 2 was released on October 2, 2015 and it takes place 20 years after the events of the first game. Gameplay Plot  In 1936, in the Khembalung Valley in Tibet, a detachment of British soldiers, sent out on an expedition by the British government to map the country, are ambushed by soldiers of the Third Reich at a monastery when they attempt to aid the monks there. Richard Weston, the son of the governor in Hong Kong and the expedition's leader, loses most of his men in the fighting while protecting the head monk as he leads them to a secret chamber, including Thomas Finch, who becomes separated from both Richard and the monk when the chamber's door seals shut. Before he dies, the monk hands Richard a key and instructs him that it must not be found. Richard discovers that the chamber contains carvings and much more that are not Asian in origin. Despite what he sees, he works to find a way out, and uses the key on a stone pedestal in the chamber, creating a portal. Richard vanishes with the key when he passes through it, with the portal closing behind. A few hours later, when the Germans have finished securing the monastery, their leader, Hanna von Hagenhild, a German countess and a scientist in the Thule Society, orders that the expeditions' source for the maps of the region in Hong Kong is to be eliminated along with any notes, with Triads used to do the dirty work, in order to avoid further disruptions in their work. A week later in Hong Kong, Fenton Paddock, the pilot of a cargo plane and formerly of the British Army after being dishonourably discharged, after narrowly escaping death at the hand of the Tong branch of the Triads, after interfering in their smuggling business, is summoned to Lord Weston, Hong Kong's governor. Fenton finds himself hired to look into Richard's disappearance along with the rest of his team as an outsider, as the British government can't afford to do so without causing a diplomatic incident with China. Seeking maps of Tibet from his former employee, Yen Wuang, along with his notes on an expedition he took in the area, Fenton encounters his niece, Kim, while searching for them, before being forced to take her with him when the Tong pursue them for the maps and notes. While en route to Tibet, Fenton explains to Kim why he was removed from the army, and why he is heading to Tibet. Before reaching a village on their route, a German fighter plane shoots them down. After recovering from the crash, the pair look to Yen's notes for a safe place to rest from the cold, learning that he had visited the region with a British explorer, a Professor Arthur Hayes, in 1922, seeking a monastery supposed to be a mere myth. Determined to find it but noticing a truck driving through the mountains, the pair discover a German encampment near to the monastery, and rescue Thomas in the process. When the pair make their way into the monastery and the secret chamber within it, Fenton and Kim learn that Richard disappeared through a gate within it, and that to get in themselves, they need a second key that is hidden in another part of the world. Hagenhild, however, captures them both, with plans to pursue Hayes who holds an item that is needed to find the second key on a special map in their possession. Fenton manages to escape, but loses Kim in the process of trying to rescue her, believing her to be dead. In Marrakesh, Morocco, Fenton works to free Professor Hayes, when he learns he had been arrested over tax problems with the French colony. After working hard to raise bail money to release him, Hayes reveals what he knows about the monastery and his expedition. Through his conversation, he reveals that the monastery hides the legendary Shambala, which contains an immense power. After their talk he decides to give Fenton the artifact in his possession, a green gemstone shaped like a dragon's eye. Agents of the Third Reich, however, make an appearance, killing Hayes and making off with the artifact, forcing Fenton to follow them back to Berlin, in which the city is in the process of hosting the 1936 Olympic Games. Needing entry to a local museum where the piece was taken along with the map he learnt of from Hagenhild, Fenton gains entry to the Olympic stadium and helps a friend in the games to win gold, while posing also as a member of the press. Infiltrating the lower levels of the museum during a party for Olympic winners, he finds out that the Piri Reis map he needs to find out the location of the second key, is actually being stored in Wewelsburg castle in Germany. Paddock, who recovers the gemstone, takes a train into the countryside, and infiltrates the castle. Upon finding the map, he combines the artifact with the Piri Reis map, finding out that the second key is located in the Gujarat area of India. After dealing with a tiger problem, he finds the key at an old temple submerged under water, along with murals showing a man in a British uniform, helping the people of the temple, much to Fenton's confusion. Fenton returns to Hong Kong to enlist Weston's support to stop the Germans, but he finds the governor has made a deal with them in exchange for his son's safety. Fenton and the key are taken back to the monastery by the Germans, where it is revealed that Kim is still alive and is being held prisoner. Forced to open the gate in the chamber by Hagenhild, Fenton, Kim, Hagenhild, and the rest of German soldiers, disappear, with Fenton separated from them. Awakening in a chamber, he finds himself meeting Richard, who appears like a ghost but reveals that both he and Fenton are in Shambala, and that he is in the past. Realising that Hangenhild is after the power of Shambala, Fenton works with Richard to assemble a talisman to use the power himself to stop them. Creating a dragon from the power of his thoughts, Fenton directs it to attack the soldiers, while Kim, who breaks free of her bonds, fights Hagenhild and kills her. With the threat over, Fenton and Kim promise Richard to inform his father of what has become of him, before sharing an embrace together.

Biography=Early years Tony Gilbert was born in Poplar, London to a large Jewish family in 1914. As a young man, Gilbert served as an apprentice in the fur industry, working as a nailer.John Bain, \\"Tony Gilbert,\\" grahamstevenson.me.uk/ Retrieved 11 October 2010. In the early 1930s, the diminutive Gilbert was the victim of anti-semitic violence when he was attacked on the streets by members of the British Union of Fascists. Gilbert awoke from his beating in the hospital, more fervent than ever in his opposition to fascism. During the Spanish Civil War, Gilbert joined the International Brigades and went to Spain, serving as a courier for Loyalist forces fighting in defense of the Second Spanish Republic. During his Spanish activity, he shared responsibility for the capture of his unit by rebel forces when an incorrect decision was made at a fork in the road and the unit was marched into a trap. Gilbert apparently avoided being shot shortly after being captured, when a car full of American journalists arrived at the scene. He was a prisoner of war from March 1938 until the war ended later that year. At the start of World War II, Gilbert worked in Yorkshire as a coal miner before returning to London and joining the army. After the war Gilbert worked on the railway, where he became active in the National Union of Railwaymen. During the war he had been awakened to the interrelated problems of racism and colonialism and he became politically active in East London as a public speaker on these matters. In 1953, Gilbert married Shelia Murch, with whom he had two daughters. The couple separated in 1963 due to the tension of family life and the demands of his developing political career and beliefs. Political career In 1954 the Movement for Colonial Freedom (MCF) was established, an anti-colonial political group which held consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council,Edward H. Lawson and Mary Lou Bertucci, Encyclopedia of Human Rights. London: Taylor and Francis, 1996; pg. 968. with Gilbert involved as an active member of the leadership of this organisation from its inception. The MCF was closely associated with the left wing of the Labour Party and attempted to unite small British groups and individuals in a campaign against the political and economic domination of colonial subjects of the British empire.Rachel Kemsley (archivist), Liberation (Movement for Colonial Freedom) Administrative/Biographical History, School of African and Oriental Studies, University of London, revised July 2002. Retrieved 12 October 2010. The MCF included a standing committee to address issues relating to racism in Britain as well as a Trade Union Committee aimed to foster the union movement in the colonial countries. The MCF was funded by membership dues, including those of individuals and affiliated organisations, and was sponsored by as many as 100 Members of Parliament. In October 1970 the Movement for Colonial Freedom changed its name to Liberation at the behest of its president, Fenner Brockway.John Percy, \\"The Liberation Archive,\\" Working Class Movement Library, 2004. wcml.org/ Retrieved 11 October 2010.

He joined the Nazi Party on 1 May 1933. Between June and August 1943 in the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp, Bickenbach and his assistant, Helmut R√ºhl, conducted a series of tests by poisonous gas in gas chamber experiments with phosgene. More than 50 prisoners, mainly gypsies transferred for medical experiments from Auschwitz, were murdered in the course of these experiments.Ernst Klee: Auschwitz, die NS-Medizin und ihre Opfer, Frankfurt am Main, 1997, S. 378ff. After the war Otto Bickenbach was arrested on the 17th of March 1947 and summarily deported to France to face trial. In the following interrogation, Bickenbach and his associate Eugen Haagen denied responsibility for the experiments and stated they were solely following the orders of Heinrich Himmler. Even so, it became clear that Bickenbach and his associates had free rein when it came to the methodology behind the experiments, and their parts in the crimes were found satisfactory enough to take them to trial. In January 1954, Bickenbach was sentenced to a life sentence of forced labour but was pardoned following a retrial in 1955, being found repentant and ideologically sound by a military court in Metz. Bickenbach returned to Germany and there established his own medical practice, his return to medicine cemented by support from the medical board in Cologne who in 1966 came to the verdict that he had not violated his professional ethics despite his actions during the war.CERTIFICATE IT 15/62 see Ernst Klee:People Encyclopedia of the Third Reich.

At age 27, Irene Hickson became one of the oldest players signed by the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League for its inaugural season. Although averaging .171 lifetime, she was known as an opportune hitter with runners in scoring position during the late innings.

A member of two champion teams, she won the batting title in the 1943 championship series and in 1946 set an all-time record with five walks received in a single game.Encyclopedia of Women and Baseball ‚Äì Leslie A.

Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2000. Format: Paperback, 294pp. Language: English. Early life Hickson was born and raised in Chattanooga, Tennessee. An all-around athlete, in the mid 1930s she pitched and caught for semi-professional softball teams in Georgia, Tennessee and North Carolina. She was credited for hitting 25 home runs in 1939 and also formed part of several State Championship teams. Besides this, in 1938 Hickson became the only girl boxer to fight in Chattanooga. She also competed and won every field and track event ever held at the Warner Park Zoo, including 50-yard dash, relay race, throwing, long jump. and horseshoes. Being a woman and coming from a low-income family, she found a part-time job as a spinning doffer at a yarn processing company. But her ambition was to play ball as long and as well as her idol Ty Cobb and be a catcher like Mickey Owen of the Brooklyn Dodgers. Hickson later played for a men's team in Chattanooga, where baseball scout Jimmy Hamilton was impressed with her talent.Encyclopedia of Women and Baseball AAGPBL career In 1943 Hamilton invited Hickson to an All-American Girls Professional Baseball League tryout. After making the league at tryouts held in Wrigley Field that May, Hickson was allocated to the Racine Belles, a team managed by Johnny Gottselig. She played for them until Racine lost the franchise after the 1950 season. She was dubbed Choo-choo, a wordplay presumably inspired in the popular song Chattanooga Choo Choo, which include her birthplace, and because of the way she ran the bases, like a small wood-burning steam locomotive. During her eight years in the league, she was considered by her teammates to be a leader and a positive influence in their dugout. In 1943, Hickson shared catching duties with Dorothy Maguire, while the Belles claimed the first Championship Title in the league's history. This team was characterized by strong pitching, fine defensive play, timely hitting and speed on the bases, enough to win the first half with a 33‚Äì10 mark and finish the regular season with an overall record of 55 wins and 38 losses. Mary Nesbitt, a knuckleball lefty and first sacker, posted a 26‚Äì13 record and hit .280 in 73 games, while Joanne Winter finished with an 11‚Äì11 mark to give Racine a strong one-two pitching staff. By other side, Margaret Danhauser, Eleanor Dapkus, Maddy English, Sophie Kurys, Edythe Perlick and Claire Schillace, carried the offensive load and provided a solid defense. In the best-of-five Series, Racine defeated the Kenosha Comets, winners of the second half, 3 games to 0, to clinch the AAGPBL title. Hickson excelled behind the plate in the Series and topped all hitters with a .417 average (5-for-12). Early in the season, Nesbitt and Hickson were referred as the Belles Chattanooga Battery, because both were discovered by scout Hamilton in there. On July 1 of that year took effect the first All-Star Game of the league, which coincidentally became the first night game ever played at Wrigley Field. The contest was played under temporary lights between two teams composed of Belles and Comets players against South Bend Blue Sox and Rockford Peaches players.The Diamond Angle ‚Äì An interview with Mary NesbittESPN Page 2 ‚Äì Reel Life: A League of Their Own - Article by Jeff Merron After that, the Belles missed the playoffs for the next two years. Then, managed by Leo Murphy the team returned to post season action from 1946 through 1949. With original roster mostly intact in these seasons, the Belles clinched the title in 1946. Racine won first place with a league-best 74‚Äì38 record, captured the semifinal round by beating South Bend in four games, and took the lead in the finals over the 1945 champion Rockford, four games to two. Racine's Winter collected four wins in all series, including three against Rockford, despite allowing 19 base runners in a 14-inning, 1‚Äì0 shutout victory in decisive Game Six. The only run in the marathonic game came in the bottom of the 14th, when Kurys hit a single off Mildred Deegan, then stole second base, and scored on an RBI- single by Betty Trezza. Unfortunately for Deegan, she was the pitching star of the over-all series, beating Grand Rapids and Racine twice each and winning four straight before the Belles finally stopped her in the final game. Meanwhile, Hickson exemplified the kind of women who played hardball in the league, heroically catching throughout the ten playoffs games with a broken finger on her throwing hand.SABR Project ‚Äì Edythe Perlick biography by Jim Sargent The Belles moved from Racine, Wisconsin to Battle Creek, Michigan before the 1951 season. As a result, Hickson, Kurys, Dapkus, English, Perlick and Winter were emotionally disappointed and rejected the move. During eight years, the Belles were a close-knit team, always like a family away from home. The girls thought that all would be different, like a new team, maybe a new manager and, specially, a new location. A longtime resident of Racine, Hickson decided to stay close to home and played one more season with Kenosha.A League Of My Own: Memoir of a Pitcher for the All-American Girls ‚Äì Patricia I. Brown. Publisher: Macfarland & Company, 2003. Format: Paperback, 216pp. Language: English. Life after baseball Following her baseball career, Hickson ran a restaurant called Home Plate. Then she worked during 22 years for the Zayre department store chain. Irene Hickson is part of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York. The exhibition was unveiled on November 5, , in honor of the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League rather than individual baseball personalities. After that, filmmaker Penny Marshall premiered her 1992 film A League of Their Own, a fictional history centered in the first season of the AAGPBL, which brought a rejuvenated interest to the historic girls league. Hickson died of natural causes at her home in Racine at the age of 80.

There are distinct differences between Commercial and Residential Playgrounds. Residential Playgrounds, though safe, are typically made out of lumber and do not have safety guidelines set up by different associations. The safety of the Commercial Playgrounds is governed by several different organizations. They include: Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), National Program for Playground Safety,http://www.uni.edu/playground/ A.S.T.M. International,http://www.astm.org/index.shtml ADA Accessibility Guidelines, and National Child Care Association.http://www.nccanet.org/ One can usually find commercial playgrounds at public parks, fast food restaurants, indoor play places, schools, and churches. Prices for a commercial playground depend on size and the type of components on them. The prices range from typically $10,000 to $150,000.  Commercial Playgrounds  Commercial Playgrounds are indoor or outdoor structures meant to handle large volumes of traffic. The playgrounds are designed with both safety and fun in mind to ensure a good time for the children and peace of mind for parents and guardians. In the past few decades the commercial playground industry grew tremendously. Commercial playgrounds started as slides and climbing structures being put next to one another and then eventually being combined. Since those early days Commercial playgrounds have grown into a multimillion-dollar industry with playgrounds having multiple levels, climbing structures, slides, play panels, and stations.  Commercial Playground Safety  Commercial Playground Safety is not taken lightly by the commercial playground industry or customers alike. In order to make sure Commercial playground companies make the safest playgrounds they are governed by industry and multi-industry organizations and associations. As stated in the opening paragraph they include: Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), National Program for Playground Safety, IPEMAhttp://www.ipema.org/ and A.S.T.M. International. *CPSC (Consumer Product Safety Commission) helps govern playground safety by informing the public of unsafe playground practices and unsafe playground equipment. The CPSC also hands out booklets that inform consumers how to have their children play safe. The CPSC also created a book of guidelines for public playground safety in 1981 that has shaped the commercial playground industry and their safety efforts. *NPPS (National Program for Playground Safety) governs playground safety by helping the public create safe and developmentally appropriate play environments for children.

The core of the exhibition originally came from the collections of Ferdinand Franz Wallraf (1748‚Äì1824) and Matthias Joseph de No√´l (1782‚Äì1849), and the exhibition was soon expanded through endowments. The museum's original location was a Neo- Gothic building on the Hansaring, built in 1900, but this was destroyed by bombs in 1943.\\"Angewandte Kunst vom Mittelalter bis zur Gegenwart \\", Museum f√ºr Angewandte Kunst, October 12, 2007.

Building The plain, red-brick Schwarz-Bernhard building stands on the site of a former Conventual monastery, whose shape is still traced by the ground plan and the square inner courtyard. The late-Gothic Minoritenkirche on the south side still survives. The inner courtyard wall on the north side has been almost entirely glazed, acting as a \\"shop window\\" for the museum.

It is distributed under the GNU General Public License by the Studio Smart Agent Technologies and hosted at SourceForge. It is written in Java, uses a MySQL database and comes with an administration tool. History The development of easyrec, an implementation of the Adaptive Personalization approach, started in the course of several research and development projects conducted by the Studio Smart Agent Technologies in close cooperation with international companies. During the year of 2008 the core functionality of easyrec was developed forming the basis of research prototypes focusing on the music domain (e.g. MusicExplorer). In June 2009 a beta version of easyrec, containing basic administration features, was integrated into a movie streaming portal for evaluation purposes. Furthermore, in September 2009 easyrec was awarded a special recognition in the category ‚ÄúAward for Innovations ‚Äì IT Innovations for an economic upswing‚Äù by the jury of the Austrian state prize for multimedia and e-business. After a comprehensive refactoring phase and the integration of the evaluation results easyrec was published on SourceForge on 18 February 2010. In course of the CeBIT tradeshow 2011 in Hanover easyrec has been awarded the German ‚ÄúINNOVATIONSPREIS-IT 2011‚Äù. Principles The following five primary goals guided the development of easyrec. * It should be a ready-to-use application, not another algorithmic framework * It should be easy to use, concerning installation, integration and administration * It should be robust and scalable for serving real world applications * It should be free of charge, so that anyone can profit from personalization features * It should rely on a community-driven development Uses Although easyrec is a domain-agnostic, general purpose personalization system, the current Web service API is customized for providing online shops with item recommendations. Especially for small and medium enterprises, easyrec provides a low barrier entrance to personalization. Features Screenshot: Overview Screenshot: Rules A major feature of easyrec is a set of usage statistics and other business relevant information presented via an administration and management interface. Furthermore, the easyrec administrator is supported by a variety of administration and configuration functions including the manual import or adaptation of business rules. Integrators or developers benefit from the lightweight Web service APIs (REST and SOAP) as well as from the guided installation wizard. Concerning personalization functionality easyrec is providing the following services * unpersonalized recommendations of the form \\"other users also bought/viewed/...\\", etc. * personalized recommendation depending on individual preferences * rankings such as \\"most bought items\\", \\"most viewed...\\", etc. Additionally, as an integration showcase, a MediaWiki extension was developed and is bundled with the application. Currently additional features like further recommender algorithms and a plugin-system are evaluated and prepared for integration into the easyrec system. Architecture The underlying architecture of easyrec is designed to be robust and scalable‚Äîseparating time-consuming computations from the task of online assembling of recommendations. easyrec is designed as a multi-layer system consisting of * a database layer as storage of user actions and pre- calculated business rules * an application layer for hosting online and offline recommendation services and * an API layer for various Web service interfaces. Moreover, the generator server contains different item association generators which create business rules that define a relation between two items. easyrec Architecture Examples These are examples of Web sites using the easyrec recommender system: * Flimmit * 2xFun * MusicExplorer * Mikawo * FlashGames180 * ColoradoCSAs.info FootnotesExternal links * Category:Recommender systems Category:Cross-platform software Category:Cross- platform free software Category:Free software programmed in Java (programming language) Category:Free application software Category:Free web software Category:Software projects Category:Web applications Category:MediaWiki extensions ","title":"Easyrec"},{"id":"29152426","text":"The Studio Smart Agent Technologies (SAT) is part of the Research Studios Austria ForschungsgesmbH, a non-profit research organization.

It takes its name from an old granite bridge over the River Camel, and lies on the border between the parishes of St Breward and St Tudy. Wenford Bridge was the terminus of a former railway line from Wadebridge that was originally built by the Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway in 1834. The line was built in order to facilitate the transport of sea sand for agricultural use from the estuary of the Camel to the local farms, and never carried passengers. Other traffic included granite and china clay from local quarries, and the line survived to carry the latter until 1983. Today the route of the line forms part of the Camel Trail, a recreational route for walkers, cyclists and horse riders. Pottery The influential studio potter Michael Cardew purchased the inn at Wenford in 1939 and converted it to a pottery where he produced earthenware and stoneware pottery. After his death his son Seth Cardew carried on the tradition until 2005 when he relocated to Spain.

Elyachar enlisted in the United States Army during World War II as a private, advancing to the rank of colonel in charge of military intelligence for General Dwight D. Eisenhower. His engineering skills came into play in the construction of vital railroad bridges that helped clear the way for General George S.

Real estate He resumed his real estate business after completing his military service, buying and building commercial and residential buildings, primarily in Manhattan. Eventually he built a portfolio that was worth as much as $100 million. A five-story residential building which he owned at 33 West 63rd Street, a tenement constructed in the 1890s, became the target of an effort by Paul Milstein to assemble a group of properties that would become the site of 1 Lincoln Plaza, a 43-story building that had both offices and apartments.

By 1987, Elyachar and his twin sons were not on speaking terms. He came into conflict with his sons over the disposition of a group of four properties that he owned in Manhattan, where Elyachar had variously given and retracted partial ownership of the buildings to his sons and daughter. Elyachar insisted that he retained ownership of the properties and sought to donate the buildings to the charitable causes he supported, while his sons claimed that they were part owners of the buildings, which they wanted to redevelop or convert to cooperatives. At that time, the properties were fully depreciated and earned more than $3 million in revenue, with annual profits of at least $1.5 million, according to documents filed in state and Federal courts.Scardino, Albert. \\"Family Feud Rends Real Estate Empire\\", The New York Times, February 23, 1987.

Personal life She was born in Alderley, Cheshire, the second of five children to Edward Stanley, later to be the Bishop of Norwich, and sister of Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, Dean of Westminster and Owen Stanley, the naval explorer. She was also a close friend of Sidney Herbert, and his wife. She was an ardent Puseyite. She converted to Catholicism in 1856. Nursing Mary Stanley was one of the women who answered the appeal which went out for nurses for the Crimea. She shared Florence Nightingale's interest in nursing, the two having become friends in 1847, and like Florence Nightingale, was an advocate of the Kaiserswerth plan for a time. However, while Nightingale was initially an admirer of the Sisters of Mercy and later became an admirer of Kaiserswerth, Stanley went the other way and this led to her conversion. Mary Stanley helped the government recruit the first group of nurses to go to Constantinople which included a group of nuns from the Irish Sisters of Mercy. She and Nightingale were assisted in their nursing endeavours by Cardinal Manning. With his aid Stanley led a second party of predominately Catholic nurses to the Crimea. The rift between her and Nightingale began when she arrived. Despite the reviews given by Nightingale of these nurses some went on to have stellar careers in nursing and the primary objection was probably due to the argument about who was in charge and a degree of mistrust of Catholics at the time. Published works Stanley wrote a book outlining the issues with getting trained women for the role of nurses in British hospitals; 'Hospitals and Sisterhoods' published in 1854. Her second book 'True to Life: A Simple Story' was published in 1873.

The cloister (Chiostro Grande) is of a late Renaissance design, while the Chiostro Piccolo features Roman marble columns. History Map showing the location of Certosa di San Giacomo on Capri east of Marina Piccola. Count Giacomo Arcucci, a secretary to Joan I of Naples, established the charterhouse in 1371. He later became a monk himself in 1386. In 1553 the monastery was restored and fortified and a tower was erected which collapsed in the 18th century. There was often conflict between the islanders and the monks, who owned land as well as grazing and hunting rights. During the 1656 plague in Capri, the monks sealed themselves off, whereupon the islanders threw their corpses over the wall of the monastery in retribution.

In 1988 he was Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and from 1989 in Brussels working in the Cabinet of Leon Brittan before returning to London in 1993. In 1995 he went on secondment to the French Ministry of Finance, returning to the Treasury in 1996. From 1998 to 2003 he worked in the Cabinet Office as Deputy Head of the European Secretariat and then moved to the Immigration and Nationality Directorate of the Home Office for a year. In 2004, Donnelly was promoted to be Director-General for Economics (later, for Europe and Globalisation) in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

In 2016 he announced plans to move non London based staff in BIS to London, out of step with other moves to decentralise the civil service. Questions were raised in Parliament about the rationale and evidence for this decision. Subsequent machinery of government changes limited the impact this had, although some staff had taken redundancy or moved to other positions before this was resolved. Donnelley has never apologised for this decision.

This was formerly a separate hamlet, and is now part of the town of Northampton. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church stands alongside the A45 road, adjacent to the grounds of the former Upton Hall. Early history St Michael's was built originally as a private chapel to the lord of the manor and it is thought that the present church was built between 1158 and 1189. Alterations were made to it between the 13th and 15th centuries, including the addition of the tower in the 14th century and a porch in 1594. The church was restored in 1892‚Äì93 by M. H. Holding. It was declared redundant on 1 January 1981, and was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 21 December 1988. Architecture=Exterior The church is constructed in coursed limestone rubble. It has dressings in limestone and ironstone, and lead roofs. Its plan consists of a nave with a south porch, a chancel, and a west tower. The tower is set within the west end of the nave, and has two- light bell openings on each side, a battlemented parapet, and a pyramidal roof with a finial and a wrought iron weathervane. On the west side of the tower, facing Upton Hall, is a stair turret, above which is an octagonal clock face. Over the nave and chancel walls is a plain parapet. The east window in the chancel has three lights and Decorated tracery. In the north wall is a small lancet window and, to the west of this, a two-light Perpendicular window that was inserted in 1892. On the south side of the chancel is a round-headed priest's door, and to the west of this are two-light windows. In both the north and south walls of the nave are Norman round-headed doorways. Also in the north wall is a three-light Perpendicular window, also from 1892, and two single-light round-headed windows. In the south wall are two-light Perpendicular windows, and on each side of the roof of the porch is a small quatrefoil window. The porch has a Tudor arched doorway. On the east side of the porch is a circular window, and there is a rectangular window on its west side. In the gable of the porch is a blank shield with the date 1592 to the left, the initials HC on the right and VK (for Valentine Knightley) above. In the west front of the church are lancet windows on each side of the tower, and a canted stair turret. There is a mass dial (a form of sundial) to the east of the priest's door, another in the west wall, and a third in the porch. Interior Internally there is no division between the nave and the chancel. The reredos, choir stalls, desks and pulpit are all made from Riga oak and were designed in 1899 by M. H. Holding. In the church is a 17th- century parish chest. The vestry contains a 17th-century communion table which was replaced by a new altar in 1907. In the south wall of the chancel is a recess that probably formerly contained a piscina. There are aumbries in the north and east walls. The stained glass in the east window dates from 1870. On the walls are four hatchments. There are a number of tombs and memorials in the church, many commemorating the Samwell family. These include a wall monument to Sir Thomas Samwell, 2nd Baronet who died in 1757. Also in the church is a tomb chest with alabaster effigies of Richard Knightley, who died in 1537, and his wife. In addition there is a slate wall memorial to James Harrington, the author of The Commonwealth of Oceana, who died in 1677 and is buried in St Margaret's, Westminster. External features The churchyard contains a number of old graves. One of these designated as a Grade II listed building; it is a headstone dated 1672, and is made from ironstone. In the area around the churchyard are mounds which are the remains of a deserted medieval village. Recent history and present day St Michael's continued to be a chapel of ease to St Peter's Church, Northampton, until 1966. It was closed for regular worship in 1980. The churchyard is maintained by a group of local people known as the Friends of St Michael's, and seasonal services continue to be held in the church. Quinton House School now occupies Upton Hall; the school helps with the upkeep of the church, and holds occasional services for the pupils.

Established in 2006 under the umbrella of the Stiftung Ordnungspolitik foundation, the cep is based in Freiburg.. It is headed by L√ºder Gerken, chairman of the executive board of the Stiftung Ordnungspolitik and the Friedrich-August-von-Hayek Foundation. Members of the board of trustees include Roman Herzog, Leszek Balcerowicz, Frits Bolkestein, Udo Di Fabio, J√ºrgen Stark, Holger Steltzner and Hans Tietmeyer. Aims and objectives cep works at the interface between science, politics and the public, and its aim is to consolidate, at EU level, policy which orients itself towards freedom and a free market economy while reducing regulation and red-tape to a minimum. As a centre of expertise, cep builds a bridge between EU politics and public awareness of EU politics in Germany. Through dialogue with academics, political decision-makers, the media and the public, cep develops strategies and concepts for the economic policy of the EU, monitors the EU‚Äôs most current political projects in a constructive and independent manner, and creates transparency and awareness for European policy and its impact on Germany. cep endeavours to inform the public about developments at EU level and the impact of EU policy, at the same time proposing concrete options for action. In addition, cep produces expert reports and analyses and advises politicians from all parties on EU economic policies. The academic foundation of the work are ordoliberal free market principles. The foundation strives to maintain and further develop the ordoliberal tradition of the Freiburg School of Economics. This school of thought was founded by Walter Eucken, substantially refined by Friedrich August von Hayek and put into political practice by Ludwig Erhard, the Minister for Economic Affairs who helped ignite the economic miracle in post-war Germany. The foundation drafts realizable policy options and advocates public discussion of ordoliberal concepts and ideas. To this end, it regularly organises lectures and panel discussion with well-known politicians, scientists and economists such as Angela Merkel, G√ºnter Oettinger, Wolfgang Sch√§uble, J√ºrgen Stark and Jens Weidmann.  Controversy  The cep published a study in early 2019 according to which Germany had benefited most from the common currency since its introduction. The researchers had compared the gross domestic product (GDP) of the euro states at various points in time with the GDP development of suitable non-euro countries, but without taking into account reforms in individual countries or the consequences of the European Central Bank's interest rate policy for the population. Experts therefore disputed the significance of the study, for example Clemens Fuest commented that economic growth in Germany and Italy was not due to the introduction of the euro. cep representatives rejected the criticism and referred to another study in which the \\"synthetic control method\\" had worked.

This type of bullying may be the result of the projection of the bully's own feelings of inadequacy onto the victim.S. White, An Introduction to the Psychodynamics of Workplace Bullying (2013) pp. 31‚Äì2 There can be cases where an employee is set up to fail because the stated goals of the task are considered harmful to the organization; an internal investigation is one example. Institutions may protect themselves by \\"going through the motions\\" of a sham investigation in which the findings conveniently fail to find any evidence of wrongdoing by the authorities involved with setting up the investigation. Another case where employees are set up to fail is because new employees or redundant employees are considered harmful or a threat to other employees resulting in their efforts to sabotage others work to maintain their positions if a future reduction in force is anticipated.

In 1750 her father moved to Ipswich, where his wife died in 1751. Ann taught herself to read and write, and studied all accessible travels, plays, and romances. In 1762 she married Candler, a cottager in Sproughton, a village about three miles out of Ipswich. From 1763 to 1766 Candler served in the militia (Poetical Attempts, p. 5), and this service, combined with the man's drinking habits, kept Ann and her growing family poor. In 1777 Candler enlisted in the line; Ann was forced to put four of her six children into the workhouse, and was herself upon a sick bed for eleven weeks. In 1780, after a brief visit to her husband in London, she took refuge in Tattingstone workhouse, where she gave birth to twin sons on 20 March 1781; she wrote one of her poems on their deaths a few weeks after. In 1783, when Candler came back discharged, she joined him for a time; but illness made them both return to the workhouse, whence Candler dismissed himself in six months, and Ann never saw him again. Ann Candler died on 6 September 1814, at Holton, Suffolk, aged 74. Works In the workhouse, Ann Candler worked on the short poems for which she is known. The Ipswich Journal published one in March 1785, \\"On the Death of a Most Benevolent Gentleman\\" (Metcalfe Russell of Sproughton); she wrote one in 1787 \\"To the Inhabitants of Yoxford\\"; one in 1788 to a woman who had befriended her, \\"An Invitation to Spring\\", and another spring song to the same woman in 1789. The Ipswich Journal (17 September 1814) attributed the following poems also to her; \\"A Paraphrase of the 5th chap. of the 2nd Book of Kings\\"; the \\"History of Joseph, in an Address to a Young Man\\"; and the \\"Life of Elijah the Prophet\\", which probably appeared in the Journal\\" from 1790 onwards. By 1800 it was proposed to publish a short volume of Ann Candler's work by subscription; and by 24 May 1802 she was under a roof of her own at Copdock, just by Sproughton, near a married daughter.

Biography=Early years Born in Esik, Kazakh SSR, Schmidtgal emigrated with his parents at the age of two from the former Soviet Union and settled in Schloss Holte- Stukenbrock in East Westphalia in North Rhine-Westphalia. He started to play football at FC H√∂velriege and move from there to the youth of SC Verl. On 27 August 2003, the second matchday of the Oberliga Westfalen, he made his debut for the first team in the 2‚Äì3 defeat against FC G√ºtersloh. In this season, where he was still a youth player, he came to a total of ten appearances. In the next season, he achieved a place in the starting eleven and came to 29 appearances. He showed above average performance and thus aroused the interest from clubs in higher leagues, among those VfL Bochum who signed him. Schmidtgal had previously for promotion to the Regionalliga, the then third division, the Verl side. VfL Bochum In Bochum, he played for the second team and did only train with the first team, which was playing in the Bundesliga. Rot-Wei√ü Oberhausen In summer of 2009, he left VfL Bochum and signed for Rot-Wei√ü Oberhausen the 2. Bundesliga. Greuther F√ºrth For the 2011‚Äì12 season he joined SpVgg Greuther F√ºrth with a two-year contract. Fortuna D√ºsseldorf In 2013, he moved on to Fortuna D√ºsseldorf. FSV Frankfurt In June 2015 he signed a two-year contract with FSV Frankfurt. International career In 2008 Bernd Storck, the newly appointed manager of the Kazakhstan national team, researched German players born in Kazakhstan. This research revealed Sergei Karimov, Juri Judt, Konstantin Engel and Heinrich Schmidtgal. On 3 September 2010, Schmidtgal made his debut for the Kazakhstan national team in a Euro 2012 qualifier against Turkey. Schmidtgal was not entitled by UEFA rules to play for the Kazakhstan national team in second qualifier game against Austria in Vienna, as Schmidtgal had not yet completed obtaining Kazakhstani citizenship and was only in possession of preliminary id (a provisional document not valid outside Kazakhstan). This issue was later resolved by Schmidtgal gaining dual citizenship (German- Kazakhstani).

His major works include anime Space Warrior Baldios, the Magical Princess Minky Momo series, and Pocket Monsters. He had a reputation for his witty dialogue and was known for the unusual next episode previews in the series he served as chief writer for. In Pok√©mon, he coined Team Rocket's iconic motto. He was also a member of the Writers Guild of Japan. His father, , served as Fukuoka Prefecture's lieutenant governor, local vice-minister and chairman of the local finance association. Career Shudo was born in Fukuoka Prefecture, but moved to Tokyo, Sapporo, and Nara Prefecture when he was a child because his father was a government official, and he attributes his dry, non- indigenous style to this experience. When he failed the college entrance exams, he read a specialized magazine that his younger sister had bought, Scenario, which led him to enroll in a screenplay institute with the funds he had saved up to go to prep school. He got recognized for the screenplays he had written there, and in 1969, at the age of 19, he made his debut as a scriptwriter in the 45th episode of the TV historical drama ≈åedo S≈çsam≈ç. However, he got tired of fixing scripts that he did not agree with and stopped writing altogether, claiming he got fed up with penning human drama pieces, so he spent the rest of his time working as a salesman for educational equipment and various ceremonial occasions, while at the same time helping out with sh≈çjo manga original stories and plots for TV dramas without taking credit for any of his work. Later, he roamed Europe with the money he had saved from his salesman job, and when he returned to Japan after running out, with the help of his acquaintance, screenwriter Fukiko Miyauchi, he returned to work as a scriptwriter in 1976 for an episode from Manga Sekai Mukashibanashi, an anime TV series produced by Dax International. Since then, he worked on Dax's several other serials, such as Paris no Isabelle and Manga Hajimete Monogatari. In the early 1980s, he also worked on Tatsunoko Production's works, but it was Magical Princess Minky Momo and GoShogun, both of which were produced at Ashi Productions, where he was in charge of everything from the original idea to story editing, that revealed his talent as an author.http://www.pelleas.net/aniTOP/index.php?title=title_59 He worked with Kunihiko Yuyama, the main director of both works, in the 1990s on the sequel to Minky Momo and later Pocket Monsters. In 1984, he won the Best Screenplay Award at the first Japan Anime Awards for Manga Hajimete Monogatari, Magical Princess Minky Momo, and Sasuga Sarutobi. He also worked as a novelist, with his best known work being the Eternal Filena series. In his later years, he contributed articles to the website Anime Style and worked on feature films. The materials for the major works he was involved in, such as screenplays, have been donated to the Odawara Public Library in Odawara, Kanagawa Prefecture, where he once used to live. Some of the materials held by the library are on permanent display at the Odawara Museum of Literature. On October 28, 2010, he collapsed after suffering a subarachnoid hemorrhage in a smoking room at JR-West Nara Station in Nara, Nara Prefecture, where he was visiting, and was rushed to the hospital. However, he passed away on the next day at the age of 61.

The 2017 anime movie, Pok√©mon the Movie: I Choose You!, credits Shudo as partial screenwriter in the staff roll, as he wrote the script for the first episode of the TV anime, which was used as the base for the early part of the film.

In 1962, he played in half a dozen first-class games for Somerset, but the life of a day- to-day county cricketer was not for him. He was born in Fulham, London and died at Deane, Hampshire. Cricket career Educated at Eton, Lomax had, according to his obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, \\"an Edwardian sense of style and 18th century zest\\". A middle-order right-handed batsman and an enthusiastic though irregular fast-medium bowler, Lomax was termed \\"a grand stroke-player\\" as a schoolboy cricketer in 1949 and did not change his hard- hitting methods much over the years. He started playing for Wiltshire in the Minor Counties in 1950 and made his first-class cricket debut in 1952 for the Free Foresters in a match against Cambridge University. Other individual matches for teams largely composed of amateurs followed in other seasons, and in the summer of 1961 he was a member of a tour organised and captained by former Surrey captain Stuart Surridge to Bermuda. Lomax's only full-time first-class cricket was a series of six games he played for Somerset at the start of the 1962 season which, according to one account, fulfilled \\"a long- cherished wish to sample county cricket\\". Batting in the lower middle order, he had one spectacular innings, making 83 in just 64 minutes, with three sixes and 10 fours, to bring Somerset within sight of an unlikely victory in the match against Hampshire at Taunton. But he left Somerset before the end of May 1962 and did not reappear in first-class county cricket. Lomax went back to Minor Counties cricket with Wiltshire across the 1960s, regularly captaining the side. In both 1965 and 1969, Wiltshire qualified, as one of the better- performing Minor Counties, for the knock-out phase of the Gillette Cup and though both matches were lost quite comfortably against first-class opposition, Lomax did well in both games. Against Nottinghamshire in 1965, he made 50 out of a Wiltshire total of 157. And his 63 out of 147 against Essex in 1969 included 16 off an over from England Test bowler Robin Hobbs and won Lomax the man of the match award. He played for Wiltshire until 1970. Outside cricket Lomax was a farmer at Baydon in Wiltshire and also had extensive interests in horse-racing and hunting. He was master of the Craven Farmers' Hunt and for some years held a racehorse trainer's licence, although the actually trainer was his first wife, Rosemary, who was at the time barred from holding a trainer's licence by the-then rules of the Jockey Club. The Lomaxes married in 1953 and were divorced in the early 1970s; a daughter, Sarah, was the wife of the racing driver James Hunt.

He is the owner of Spanish La Liga club Valencia CF and a minority investor / owner of English Club Salford City. Early life The son of a fishmonger, Lim and his six siblings grew up in a two- bedroom government flat in the Bukit Ho Swee public housing estate. Lim completed his secondary school education at the Raffles Institution. After National Service, he went to Perth to study at the University of Western Australia. To fund his university education, Lim worked part-time doing odd jobs as a taxi driver, cook and waiter. He graduated with a degree in accounting and finance and first worked as an accountant. Early career In the early 1990s, Lim invested about US$10 million in a start-up palm-oil company, Wilmar. In 2010, Lim cashed out at the peak of commodity prices and sold his Wilmar shares for US$1.5 billion. Known as the ‚ÄúRemisier King‚Äù due to his success in stocks, Lim explains that while there was an element of luck, it was also because he created a role for himself as a ‚Äúone man merchant bank‚Äù in the M&A; space in Indonesia in the late 80s. He became indispensable to both retail and high net worth investors. Lim quit the brokerage business in 1996 and became a private investor. He was able to escape the 1998 Asian Financial Crisis as he had liquidated most of his stocks and was holding cash.  Philanthropy  In June 2010 the Singapore Olympic Foundation (SOF) set up the SOF-Peter Lim Scholarship with a S$10 million donation from Lim. The gift is the single largest donation in Singapore from an individual towards sports development. The recipients are typically students who come from financially challenged backgrounds and have demonstrated a potential to excel in their respective sports. In 2019, Lim further pledged to continue supporting young local athletes for another 10 years from 2021 to 2030 by donating another S$10 million to the SOF-Peter Lim Scholarship. Since the inception of the scholarship, 2642 student-athletes have received scholarships amounting to $7.2 million. Lim further committed a separate $20 million to start a new community project focused on helping children from less privileged backgrounds, with the aim of helping them reach their potential. In 2014, Lim also endowed Nanyang Technological University with S$3 million to fund a professorship in peace studies at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies to protect and promote harmony in Singapore.

This combination of professions of historian and poet with a clerical post of some eminence may have significance to the thorny question of the origin of the hereditary learned families of late medieval Gaelic Ireland. Apart from Amlaoimh, however ... we have little evidence of an ecclesiastical dimension to Clann Fhir Bhisigh or its antecedents before its rise to prominence in the field of traditional learning.\\" His collateral descendant Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh (died 1671) recorded that he had brothers Giolla P√°draig mac Fir Bhisigh, ancestor of the Clann Fhir Bhisigh and of Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh, and possibly Lachtna, who is given as the ancestor of the √ì Lachtna / Loftus / Loughney family in Connacht. The abbey at Cong had been refounded by King Tairrdelbach of Connacht (1088‚Äì1156) sometime about 1130, having become an episcopal see at the Synod of R√°th Breasail in 1111. Its canons were of the Augustinian order. It was attacked and burned in 1114, 1135 and 1137.

In common law jurisdictions the general rule is that a witness is supposed to testify as to what was observed and not to give an opinion on what was observed. However, there are two exceptions to this rule: expert evidence and non-expert opinion given by laymen which people in their daily lives reach without conscious ratiocination.  General rule  In general, witnesses should testify only as to the facts observed and should not give opinion. The main rationale for such a rule is that the admission of opinion evidence would not assist, or might even mislead, the court and in particular the jury. This is because opinion evidence is usually irrelevant. Moreover, admission of such evidence would usurp the functions of the jury, which alone should be the tribunal of fact and draw its own inferences.  Expert evidence  An expert witness is a witness, who by virtue of education, training, skill, or experience, is believed to have expertise and specialised knowledge in a particular subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient that others may officially and legally rely upon the witness's specialized (scientific, technical or other) opinion about an evidence or fact issue within the scope of his expertise, referred to as the expert opinion, as an assistance to the fact-finder.Federal Rule of Evidence 702 (As amended April 17, 2000, effective December 1, 2000) Expert witnesses may also deliver expert evidence about facts from the domain of their expertise.Black's Law Dictionary, articles \\"Evidence\\", \\"Expert\\", \\"Witness\\" The facts upon which an expert opinion is based must be proved by admissible evidence.R v Turner [1975] QB 834 The duty of experts is to furnish the judge with the necessary scientific criteria for testing the accuracy of their conclusions, so that the judge or jury can form their own independent judgment by the application of these criteria to the facts proved.Davie v Edinburgh Magistrates  Non-expert opinion  Non-expert opinion refers to the opinion given in restricted circumstances by laymen or persons who do not possess any expertise. These circumstances mainly concern matters of everyday life where a person may be expected to give opinions and which opinions may be safely acted upon by others. Such circumstances cannot be definitively laid out in a closed list of cases.

Concept The concept employed by Shiply aims to utilise transport capacity that may be wasted in inefficient transport operations and as a consequence enables transport service providers to offer marginal prices to transport service requesters. Service requesters create accounts and list the items to be transported, stipulating the maximum they are prepared to pay and specifying whether they can be flexible on delivery/pickup dates or need the listed items moved subject to specified date parameters. The transport service providers bid the lowest amount they would accept to perform the transport service. A user feedback system is enabled in order to keep track of the reputation of the transport service providers and transport service requesters, this allows the transport service requesters the ability to frame their procurement decision on factors other than solely price. Registration is free for both transport service providers and transport service requesters. Transport service providers' bids are subject to a transaction based tiered fee structure, (in the UK this is between 3.9% and 9.9% -dependent on the amount of the transaction-with a minimum fee of ¬£6) the cost of which is borne by the transport service requesters. Transport service requesters may also be subject to an auction service fee. This fee amount is dependent on the shipment in question and is displayed before the transport service requester accepts a bid. In September 2010 Shiply had 17,500 transport service provider accounts, and helped voice their concerns over trade-related issues. History= Formation  Shiply was founded in March 2008 by Robert Matthams, in Manchester. He has said he had the idea of this business concept when a pool table he ordered was delivered to his university in Manchester. The driver complained that he would have to make the return journey to London empty, thereby wasting fuel and his own resources. eBay In March 2009 Shiply launched an eBay widget to be inserted by sellers into eBay auction listings. This - now part of the item listing process - gives prospective eBay bidders the option to import items they have won - or on which they are currently bidding - into Shiply.com. The widget allows them to enter their delivery post code and then Shiply imports other pertinent information into their listing. In January 2011, Shiply signed an exclusive agreement with eBay Motors UK, becoming the site‚Äôs transport partner. At that time, 50% of its business came from eBay users. Operations=Area covered Initially, only haulage companies from UK participated in the marketplace. In October 2009, the company expanded in Germany, opening a German website and allowing German haulage companies. In August 2010, when the company expanded to France, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain, 15% of shipments on Shiply already crossed national borders and 10% of its business came from the German website. Controversies= Legal dispute  On 24 February 2011 uShip and Shiply jointly announced a settlement regarding uShip's claims of trademark and copyright infringement. As part of the settlement, Shiply has agreed to redesign some parts of its web site, and pay an amount in compensation to uShip.  Misleading Advertising  On 19 December 2012, UK's ASA published an adjudication against Shiply Ltd about misleading advertising on www.shiply.com.https://web.archive.org/web/20140407075431/http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Non- compliant-online-advertisers/Shiply.aspx The ASA investigated whether www.shiply.com made it sufficiently clear that a credit policy applied to cancellations.

The station provides camera equipment, television studios and training that allow residents of King County to create and cablecast their own television shows for a small fee. The station is carried on Comcast and Broadstripe cable systems in King County and the greater Puget Sound region except for six cities covered by Puget Sound Access. History Seattle first acquired a Public-access television station in 1983. Known simply as Channel 29, the station was often referred to as Seattle Public Access Network. The station was operated out of the Northwest Access and Production Center and was owned by the cable company. In August 1999, Seattle Community Access Network was formed as a non-profit organization in order to take over station operations from TCI. Part of the reason for creating the organization was to handle complaints about adult material being aired on the channel by local producers. Overview Seattle Community Access Network provides television productions resources to residents in King County and the greater Puget Sound region for use in creating TV shows and local programming. SCAN's facility houses two television studios for producing TV programs. The facility also provides three editing booths, several television cameras and related equipment for local residents to use for producing TV shows. SCAN has 12 full-time and 3 part-time employees that run the facility and train residents on how to use the camera equipment and editing suites. The staff regularly hold classes to teach residents TV production and video editing. Part of SCAN's operations include a Youth Media program to help teach local youth how to become filmmakers. The production facilities are also utilized by Reel grrls program run by 911 Media Arts Center and the local YMCA. Funding SCAN is funded by cable TV subscribers in the form of Cable television franchise fees. These franchise fees are charged to cable subscribers each month and totalled $6,500,000 in 2009. The fees are passed by the cable company to the Seattle city government and placed in the Cable Television Franchise Subfund that pays for Public- access television, Educational-access television and Government-access television (GATV). These are known as PEG channels for Public, educational, and government access television. Starting in 2006, the Cable Television Franchise Subfund is managed by the Department of Information Technology (DoIT) and is used fund things other than PEG channels. SCAN's receives about 10% of the fund or about $650,000 for its yearly budget. Additional funding for the station comes from grants and donations that SCAN actively seeks and a small amount comes from the fees charged to citizens that use SCAN to create programs. Threats to operations There have been several threats to the station's operations over the years. From 1997, before SCAN was created, until 2006, the station aired TV shows with adult material that were produced by local residents. The most visible of these shows was Mike Hunt TV, which ran explicit pornography. The show drew considerable criticism as well as support. Several local residents objected and called into question the station's operations. In 2005, while the Seattle city government was renegotiating the franchise agreement with Comcast, there were concerns about the cable company trying to shut down the public access station. There were also concerns regarding how public, educational and government channels were handled and how many public access channels should be available. In September 2010, Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn's proposed budget for the city has cut the funding for the station from $650,000 per year to $100,000 per year. The budget must still be approved by the Seattle City Council before it takes effect. A controversial part of the budget is $400,000 of the Cable Television Franchise Subfund being used to upgrade email for the Seattle city government. SCAN's last day of broadcasting was June 30, 2011. Seattle Community Media began as operators of public access television in Seattle July 1, 2011. Programming SCAN has produced a number of television shows that have become part of Seattle culture and has partnered with Seattle public schools to cablecast local high school sporting events. The station also carries Free Speech TV shows such as Democracy Now!. Current shows Public Exposure: is a long running local government-accountability show. It has featured guests such as former Seattle Police Chief Norm Stamper. Goddess Kring: is an arts and entertainment show that has run for over a decade. The show featured a lot of nudity early in its run. Blues To Do: is a music variety show that has been on the air for many years and deals with all aspects of the blues. Psychic Speaks: is a live call- in psychic show that has been on nearly a decade. Shifterland: is a variety show starring Cookin' Kitty that has run for several years. BETA TV: is a comedy variety show from the Seattle Neutrino Project/Beta Society improv group. The group has also cablecast their movie Junkbucket on the station. Past shows Club Diversity: was a live show that featured culture and diversity in the Seattle area. Mike Hunt TV: was a pornography and political commentary TV show that caused a stir in Seattle. The show ran from 1997 until 2006 when it was taken off the air. The Make Josh Famous Half-Hour of Garbage: was a comedy variety show that ran for two years. Now See It Person To Person: Kurt Cobain Was Murdered: was a show that investigated the death of Kurt Cobain starring Richard Lee. The show ran for over a decade before it was taken off the air in 2008. The Vintage Vehicle Show: was a show about vintage cars and car shows hosted by Lance Lambert. The show is now syndicated and broadcast on 74 stations across the US and on TV networks in 27 foreign countries. Go-Kustom TV: aired from 2001 to 2004 on SCAN and featured kustom kulture artists, pin-ups, car builders and bands from around the Greater Seattle Area. The Show was created by D.A. Sebasstian and was recently re- booted with Season 5. Jerkbeast show: was a 2001 to 2002 live comedy tv show which featured a paper mache monster called the Jerkbeast. The show would have viewers call in and the Jerkbeast along with other crew members would insult and swear at the caller. Puget Sound Access Puget Sound Access is the public access channel for six cities in South King County which are Auburn, Burien, Kent, Renton, SeaTac and Tukwila. In March 2004, channel 77 stopped cablecasting SCAN and started cablecasting Puget Sound Access for the six cities in its cablecast area. PEG channels Seattle's current franchise agreement requires cable companies to provide eight channel slots for Public, educational, and government access (PEG) channels.

The concept was first scientifically published in 2010 (although models of comparable systems controlled by neural networks date back to 2003) and has so far remained largely theoretical. A prototype for the European Space Agency is now in development. A plantoid incorporates an inherently distributed architecture consisting of autonomous and specialized modules. Modules can be modeled on plant parts such as the root cap and communicate to form a simple swarm intelligence. This kind of system may display great robustness and resilience. It is conjectured to be capable of energy harvesting and management, collective environmental awareness and many other functions. In science fiction, while human-like robots (androids) are fairly frequent and animal-like biomorphic robots turn up occasionally, plantoids are quite rare.

Finding Stationary Subspaces in Multivariate Time Series Physical Review Letters 103, 214101. is a blind source separation algorithm which factorizes a multivariate time series into stationary and non-stationary components.  Introduction  In many settings, the measured time series contains contributions from various underlying sources that cannot be measured directly. For instance, in EEG analysis, the electrodes on the scalp record the activity of a large number of sources located inside the brain.Niedermeyer E, da Silva F L. Electroencephalography: Basic Principles, Clinical Applications, and Related Fields. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2004. These sources can be stationary or non-stationary, but they are not discernible in the electrode signals, which are a mixture of these sources. SSA allows the separation of the stationary from the non-stationary sources in an observed time series. According to the SSA model, the observed multivariate time series x(t) is assumed to be generated as a linear superposition of stationary sources s^\\\\mathfrak{s}(t) and non-stationary sources s^\\\\mathfrak{n}(t), : x(t) = A s(t) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} A^\\\\mathfrak{s} & A^\\\\mathfrak{n} \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} s^\\\\mathfrak{s}(t) \\\\ s^\\\\mathfrak{n}(t) \\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}, where A is an unknown but time-constant mixing matrix; A^\\\\mathfrak{s} and A^\\\\mathfrak{n} are the basis of the stationary and non-stationary subspace respectively. Given samples from the time series x(t), the aim of Stationary Subspace Analysis is to estimate the inverse mixing matrix A^{-1} separating the stationary from non-stationary sources in the mixture x(t).  Identifiability of the solution  The true stationary sources s^\\\\mathfrak{s}(t) are identifiable (up to a linear transformation) and the true non-stationary subspace A^\\\\mathfrak{n} is identifiable. The true non- stationary sources s^\\\\mathfrak{n}(t) and the true stationary subspace A^\\\\mathfrak{s} cannot be identified, because arbitrary contributions from the stationary sources do not change the non-stationary nature of a non-stationary source  Applications and extensions  Stationary subspace analysis has been successfully applied to Brain-computer interfacing,von B√ºnau P, Meinecke F C, Scholler S, M√ºller K-R.

The culmination of the training happens during the senior year when students have the choice to spend three days a week at an internship or be dually-enrolled at a local college. According to former C.O.O., Dr. Brian White, at CCCHS \\"students are nurtured in small classes and in a safe environment emphasizing success for all. Success may be defined differently by students and families, but for all it includes graduation from high school with the necessary skills to pursue a college, post-secondary or career path.\\" History Career Connections Charter High School was established in 1999 under basic principles set forth by the Boys and Girls Clubs of Western Pennsylvania. Their vision was to create a 9-12 high school that would provide an educational experience that prepared students for careers upon graduation. CCCHS grew in number from an original enrollment of 49 ninth grade students. CCCHS had 280 students in grades 9-12 before it closed due to the Pittsburgh Public Schools refusing to renew their charter. .

The company's first product was a specially-formulated bronze alloy hard enough to cut steel, aptly named Bronze ‚Äî a name derived from the new company's own identity. An early version of the company's present diamond-shaped logo saw the day. It has remained in use in substantially the same recognizable format ever since. The American Metal Products Company slowly expanded its activities into the production of aluminium bronze alloys as sand castings, forgings and centrifugal castings. The company was renamed \\"AMPCO METAL\\" in 1930, by which time it had built itself a reputation as a reliable producer of high quality alloys. The Second World War strongly increased the demand for copper-based alloys and industrial bronzes, especially in the field of aeronautics. By 1944, manufacturing operations had grown from 100 to 2,500 employees, and every American airplane carried AMPCO METAL parts somewhere in its structure‚Äîin its engines, landing gear, propellers or airframe. In the marine environment, AMPCO METAL propellers were manufactured for landing barges and ships, and generally, AMPCO METAL alloys could be found in most sectors of military operations. Innovation was an important part of company philosophy from the outset. From 1922 onward into the 1970s, intensive research was done on the development of special non- sparking, non-magnetic hand tools for highly specialised fields such as the petroleum and natural gas industries, fire fighting and prevention, and the non-ferrous-metal welding sector. Centrifugally-cast bronzes, special hard bronzes for tooling and die applications, nickel-aluminium bronzes, high- strength aeronautical alloys as well as high-conductivity welding electrodes were all flagship products in these diverse industries. From the late 1950s, AMPCO METAL developed an extensive sales and distribution network in different countries, primarily across Europe, in order to increase contact with its various markets. In the 1970s, AMPCO METAL became the first alloy producer certified by the ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers) and in the 1980s, the first company to use EPC (Evaporative Pattern Casting) manufacturing processes in copper-based alloy production. In 2003, AMPCO METAL launched a sales and marketing department in Tianjin, China. AMPCO METAL is now active on three continents and in twelve countries.

It houses the Lukiiko (Parliament) of the Kingdom of Buganda. The Kabaka of Buganda and the Katikkiro (Prime Minister) of Buganda also maintain offices in the building. The building serves as the administrative headquarters of the Buganda Kingdom. Location Bulange is on Namirembe Hill close to Namirembe Hospital, about northwest of the main gate of Mengo Palace in Kampala, Uganda's capital and largest city.

A straight road, approximately long, called Kabaka Anjagala Road (The-King-Loves-Me Road) leads from the main entrance of the Mengo Palace to the entrance of Bulange. History In the beginning, the Buganda Parliament convened inside one of the Kabaka's palaces and conducted business under the shade of one or more trees. Later, grass-thatched buildings served as the parliament buildings. Around the beginning of the 20th century, Prime Minister of Buganda, Apollo Kaggwa, contracted an Indian, Alidina Visram, to build a parliament building using bricks. As the kingdom's government grew in size, the need for a large-enough meeting hall forced the construction of the Bulange outside the King's Palace for the first time. While in exile in Scotland in 1953, Ssekabaka Muteesa II saw and admired the construction drawings of a building. He brought those drawings with him on his return from exile in 1955. He directed that the new Bulange be constructed according to those drawings. Construction began in 1955 and was completed in 1958 at a cost of ¬£5 million, fully funded by the Government of Buganda.

The film is about a middle-class school teacher who tries to keep his wife and children happy in inflationary times and dreams of buying a car. The movie also marks the return of the Kapoor pair as a lead couple on the silver screen. Although the duo had not acted in a film in over 30 years, they had previously acted in numerous hits during the 1970s. The directorial debut film was also the first live-action Hindi film to be distributed by Disney World Cinema. It went on to win the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi at the 58th National Film Awards. Plot The Duggals are a middle-class Punjabi family living in a one-bedroom apartment in Lajpat Nagar, Delhi. The middle-aged patriarch, Santosh Duggal (Rishi Kapoor), is a modest high-school mathematics teacher; his wife Kusum (Neetu Singh) is a stay-at-home housewife who quit her job at Santosh's insistence. They have two teenage children: a tomboyish college-going daughter, Payal (Aditi Vasudev), who narrates the film, and a high-schooler son, Sandeep (Archit Krishna), a.k.a. Deepu or Sandy. They lead a hand-to- mouth existence, penny-pinching at every opportunity. Santosh commutes using a dilapidated old scooter, nicknamed ‚ÄòDuggal Express‚Äô, from his home to the school and to a coaching centre, where he gains a supplementary income. Despite his best efforts to give his children a quality education, he always falls short of their expectations, who wish for a comfortable life despite their situation. One evening Santosh receives a phone call from his sister Urmi (Supriya Shukla), who informs him that her youngest nanad (sister-in-law) is getting married at their home in Meerut that weekend. This throws the children's plans of buying gadgets out the window, as their meagre budget is now further strained with the burden of travelling to Meerut and buying gifts for the groom's family. The following night, Urmi turns up at the Duggals‚Äô, and entreats the family to arrive at the wedding by car at any cost; if they show up on the scooter, she will have to face taunts from her family. Santosh immediately says that this is impossible, since he does not have the finances to arrange for borrowing a car, let alone buying one. However, Kusum promises a distraught Urmi that they will go to the wedding in a car, no matter what the expense. After a co-teacher at school proposes renting a car to Meerut, but at too high a price, Santosh turns to his jovial neighbour Farooqui (Akhilendra Mishra), who offers the Duggals his old Maruti Esteem. Payal drives the family to Meerut without any big hassle. The wedding is a success, and Urmi's family is pleased to see the Duggals. However, upon returning home, Payal reverses the car into a wall, damaging its rear bumper and tail-light. Farooqui is unperturbed by the damage expenses, but his wife Salma (Natasha Rastogi) loses her temper and challenges the Duggals to buy a car. Despite himself, Santosh takes up the challenge, and vows to buy a new car within fifteen days. Farooqui sympathises with Santosh and advises him to buy only a new car and not a second-hand car. Santosh visits a car dealership and is offered a Maruti Alto with an attractive offer, but he has to buy the car within five days to avail of the offer. Payal is displeased with the choice of car, as she wanted something more modern like her boyfriend's i10. She refuses to accompany her family for the Alto's test drive. Eventually she applies for a job at a call centre. Meanwhile, Deepu, who had been betting money on cricket matches, is shell-shocked when the betting ring is exposed and arrested; he destroys his phone, to his girlfriend's consternation. That night, an exuberant Payal tells Santosh about her new job's offer letter, but he is unhappy with his daughter sacrificing her education for some extra money. In a fit of rage, Payal tears up her offer letter, but then the family comes to know of the betting ring through a TV news report. Payal and Kusum are enraged, but Santosh is calm. He takes Deepu to distribute the betting money among street children. Having been refused a loan by both a school- teacher and the coaching centre's owner, Santosh is at his wits‚Äô end to pay the car's down payment. In desperation, he buys a thousand packets of 555 Brand detergent, in the hope that he gets to win a car through a lucky coupon found in one of the packets. The family spends considerable time ripping open cartons, cutting through packets and fishing out coupons, but the grand prize eludes them. Then Santosh chances upon an answer-paper of one of his students‚Äô, wherein the student requests him to award him at least passing marks; in return, for each mark awarded, Santosh will get one thousand rupees. Santosh and Kusum had seen the paper earlier but had brushed it aside; now Kusum wonders whether they are doing the right thing, but Santosh reassures her that, in a fast-paced, burgeoning Delhi where his students get high starting salaries, an aging teacher deserves at least a matchbox-sized car. Santosh and Payal proceed to a McDonald's restaurant, where the student's father has arranged to meet them along with him, his grandfather and his uncle. Meanwhile, Deepu is convinced, through another sting operation report on TV, that his father has fallen for a scam, and sets out alone for the restaurant. The men sit across Santosh and Payal. The grandfather asks him to show how many marks were awarded. Santosh is astounded to discover that the boy is his student Aryan. Just as Santosh is about to show the answer-sheet, Zafar Iqbal, an ex-student of his, arrives on the scene with his wife and small daughter, and thanks him for making him a successful person in life and a principled ‚Äògood boy‚Äô. Zafar tells Santosh that he and several other ex- students live in New York and recount memories of Duggal Sir. After he leaves, Santosh, clearly moved, refuses to take the money, telling Aryan that they will both have failed if he were to undeservedly pass him: Aryan for thinking that money can buy anything, and Santosh for being remembered for dishonesty. He is about to leave, when a furious Payal, on learning that Aryan had spray- painted lewd messages on Santosh's scooter, starts an uproarious fight between the Duggals (including Deepu, who has joined the scene) and Aryan's relatives. Both parties, splattered with sauce, flee the restaurant, with Aryan's SUV in hot pursuit of the ‚ÄòDuggal Express‚Äô as the latter speeds through the roads of Delhi. The Duggals have only just reached home when their pursuers arrive at their street, asking for their address and creating a ruckus. Farooqui informs a nervous Santosh about their presence. The Duggals come down and start apologising to them; Deepu had even been convinced that they were running a sting operation. However, their fears are unfounded: the grandfather introduces himself as Popley, the proprietor of Popley Sweets, and offers the Duggals twelve months‚Äô advance tuition fees to supplement their glaringly inadequate teaching income, which they reluctantly accept. He requests Santosh to teach Aryan to be a morally good boy, unlike his two wastrel sons. Payal and Deepu are now more proud than ever that their father is a teacher. The film ends with the Duggals enjoying their new Maruti Alto; as Payal teaches Santosh to drive it, they lament that they are now stuck in traffic jams, whereas they would have simply squeezed through them with their scooter. Of course, it is a small price for them to pay.

Although Neetu-Rishi pair had made a brief appearance in the Saif Ali Khan and Deepika Padukone starrer 2009 film Love Aaj Kal, Do Dooni Chaar was their first film as a lead pair, after a gap of 30 years as Neetu Singh had retired from film after her marriage to Rishi Kapoor in 1980. Later in an interview Neetu, revealed she had no intentions of signing on the film and agreed to listen to the script at the insistence of her husband, who has already been signed on. Upon hearing the script from the director Habib, she started imaging herself as \\"Kusum Duggal\\" and immediately agreed to the part. Theme The film deals with the issue of underpaid teachers, and their issue with their self-worth in the face of growing inflation and demands of their family. The middle-class school teacher who works overtime to support his income and to send his children to good schools ends up in a moral dilemma when it comes to fulfilling the needs of his ever unsatisfied teenage children. As per producer, Arindam Chaudhuri, \\"The common question the teacher asks when he looks at his student, who is just 25 and owns a car, is why at 55 he is still riding a scooter?\\" In the end, it is not just the teacher who redeems himself by not succumbing to taking bribes, but also his children who begin to see him in the true light and importance of being a teacher and an honest citizen. Filming Film was shot on locations across Delhi, in places like Kirori Mal College, Vinobapuri, Shalimar Bagh (Delhi), Khan Market, Chittaranjan Park, Mayur Vihar Phase - 3 and Noida.

Sir William Butlin conceived of its creation based on his experiences at a Canadian summer camp in his youth and by observation of the actions of other holiday accommodation providers, both in seaside resort lodging houses and in earlier smaller holiday camps. Construction of the camp began in 1935 and it was opened in 1936, when it quickly proved to be a success with a need for expansion. The camp included dining and recreation facilities, such as dance halls and sports fields. During World War II, the camp was subject to a short military occupation when it served as a Naval training base, reverting to being a holiday camp in 1946. Over the past 75 years the camp has seen continuous use and development, in the mid-1980s and again in the late 1990s being subject to substantial investment and redevelopment. In the late 1990s the site was re-branded as a holiday resort, and remains open today as one of three remaining Butlins resorts. Holiday camp conception In 1914, Billy Butlin was living in Toronto with his mother and stepfather, when he left school and went to work for Eatons department store. According to Butlin, one of the best aspects of working for the company was that he was able to visit their summer camp which gave him his first taste of a real holiday--indeed a taste of what was to become a very big part of his life. The onset of World War I led to his leaving Eatons and enlisting in the Canadian Expeditionary Force serving in Europe, but seeing little if any action.Dacre 1982, pp.43-45 After the war, Butlin made his way back to England where he used some of his last ¬£5 (2011:¬£) to purchase a stall in his uncle Marshall Hill's travelling fair.Scott 2001, p.6 As a showman, Butlin quickly became successful, one stall becoming several, and several becoming his own travelling fair.Dacre 1982, p.72 Butlin soon had fixed fairground sites as well as his travelling fair ‚Äì the first was at Olympia in London outside Bertram Mills' Circus. In 1925 he opened a set of fairground stalls in Barry Island, Wales where he observed the way landladies in seaside resorts would (sometimes literally) push families out of the lodgings between meals, and began to nurture the idea of a holiday camp similar to the one he had attended whilst an employee at Eatons. In 1927 Butlin leased a piece of land from the Earl of Scarbrough by the seaside town of Skegness, where he set up an amusement park with hoopla stalls, a tower slide, a haunted house ride and, in 1928, a miniature railway and Dodgem cars --these were the first bumper cars in Britain, as Butlin had an exclusive license to import them. Butlin's camp During the early 1930s Butlin joined the board of Harry Warner's holiday camp company (now Warner Leisure Hotels) and in 1935 he observed the construction of Warner's holiday camp in Seaton, Devon.Butler, Russell 2010, p.38 Butlin learned from the experience of Warner, and employed the workers who had constructed the Seaton camp to come to Lincolnshire to build his new camp at Skegness. listed in Skegnessleft Construction began in September 1935 with the local paper reporting the first sod being turned on the 4th of that month.Scott 2001, p.11 Butlin designed the camp himself and said of the camp, \\"my plans were for 1,000 people in 600 chalets with electricity, running water, 250 bathrooms, dining and recreational halls. A theatre, a gymnasium, a rhododendron bordered swimming pool with cascades at both ends and a boating lake.\\" However Butlin hired the architect Harold Ridley Hooper, to draw up the formal plans for the camp buildings. In the camp's landscaped grounds, there were to be tennis courts, bowling and putting greens and cricket pitches. The total cost of the project was ¬£100,000 (2011:¬£) and despite having suffered a financial shortfall during construction, the camp opened on schedule in 1936. One of the original 1936 chalet accommodation units is still present and is now a grade II listed building, recognising its historical significance. He opened his camp on 11 April 1936 (Easter Even). It was officially opened by Amy Johnson from Hull, who had been the first woman to fly solo from England to Australia. An advertisement costing ¬£500 (2011:¬£) was placed in the Daily Express, announcing the opening of the camp and inviting the public to book for a week's holiday. The advertisement offered holidays with three meals a day and free entertainment with a week's full board, at a cost of between 35 shillings (¬£1.75) and ¬£3 (2011:¬£), according to the time of year. The advert proved successful, and over the first summer season the capacity of the camp had to be increased from 500 to 2,000, to cope with the demand. When the camp opened, Butlin realised that his guests were not engaging with activities in the way he had envisioned, as most kept to themselves, and others looked bored. He asked Norman Bradford (who was engaged as an engineer constructing the camp) to take on the duty of entertaining the guests which he did with a series of ice breakers and jokes. By the end of the night the camp was buzzing and the Butlin's atmosphere was born. From that point on, entertainment was at the very heart of Butlin's and Bradford became the first of the Butlin's Redcoats. That night Butlin decided that for his camp to work he would require an army of people to carry out the same job as Bradford, and the role of Redcoat was formed. In 1938 Butlin won the contract to supply amusements to the Empire Exhibition in Glasgow.Scott 2001, p.21 After the exhibition was complete, Butlin returned with some of the infrastructure. His Clacton camp and Sheerness amusement park each received miniature railways,Scott 2001, p.24 while Skegness received a building in the shape of the \\"Butlin theatre\\" which was later renamed the \\"Gaiety\\". Butlin continued to increase the capacity of the camp until 3 September 1939 when the Second World War was declared. The next morning, the campers were sent home and the site was taken over by the Royal Navy for use as a training establishment. Wartime use The Petty Officer in charge meets trainee Belgian sailors as they arrive at HMS Royal Arthur Once the Navy took over, the camp became known as HMS Royal Arthur and was used to train sailors for the war effort. In order to operate as a military base, many of the bright external colours were painted over, the dance hall became an armoury, and the rose beds were dug up, to become sites for air raid shelters.Hailey 2001, p.201 While the outside was repainted, much of the interior d√©cor went unchanged. Speaking of his time there George Melly reported that Royal Arthur had \\"a certain architectural frivolity inappropriate to a Royal Navy Shore Establishment.\\" Melly went on to mention how the main reception still had a sky scene with clouds painted on the ceiling and a large artificial (though realistic) tree in the centre of it. He also noted that their meals were served from an approximation of an Elizabethan inn named \\"Ye Olde Pigge and Whistle\\".Lavery 2009, p.104 During the war, the German airforce bombed Royal Arthur 52 times, including one incident on 21 August 1940 when an attack led to damage or demolition of 900 small buildings.James, Cox 2000, p.139 By the end of the conflict however, the camp's condition was good enough that it took only 6 weeks for Butlin to repair the wartime damage and reopen the camp to the public on 11 May 1946. After reopening, some signs of military occupation remained with one observer noting that the blankets supplied to campers retained the insignia of HMS Royal Arthur.Donald 2006, p.36 Later history In 1947, Butlin had experimented with opening an airfield attached to his camp at Pwllheli. Patrons could fly in, to be collected by a Redcoat and transported to the camp. Flight Magazine reported that \\"flying visitors were unanimous in their praise of what they saw and experienced\\", noting that the experience contrasted to the poor reputations the camps were given in the media of the period. Welcoming the experiment as a success, Butlin announced his intention to open airfields at his other camps. The following year he opened his next airfield at Skegness and announced that visitors could fly to the camp on a service run by BEA from 26 June. The airfield also allowed Butlin's to offer services such as pleasure trips and sightseeing trips, as well as allowing private charters. In 1948 Butlin's also opened the Ingoldmells Hotel, which was situated outside the camp on the main road. In 1949, the hotel became the first in Skegness to have a television for the use of guests. Situated in the hotel's palm court function room, the TV was manufactured by R.G.D. but could be subject to interference from the hotel's refrigerator. Butlin's had a long history of combining amusements with transport, starting with their first miniature railway at the Empire Exhibition in 1938. Skegness was to receive its own miniature railway in 1962.Scott 2001, p.53 A chairlift system was installed at the same time.Scott 2001, p.90 In 1965, the camp became home to the UK's first commercial monorail system. According to Peter Scott, who has researched the history of Butlin's transport systems, Butlin apparently got the idea for the system from Disneyland. Construction began in 1964 with the cars being manufactured locally; the total cost of the system was ¬£50,000 (2011:¬£).Scott 2001, p.91 In 1974 a fire broke out in the kitchens of the Beachcomber Chinese restaurant leading to the complete destruction of the Princes building. In the Ballroom upstairs, a \\"Miss Personality Competition\\" was taking place when smoke was first spotted. The Redcoat in Charge of this event and the comp√®re acted quickly, and were able to evacuate the building with no loss of life. To compensate for the loss of the entertainment venue, the fenceline was moved to encompass the Ingoldmells Hotel, which then became another venue. A Spring Harvest parade at Butlins Skegness in the early 1990s In 1987, the resort benefited from a ¬£14 million (2011:¬£) investment and improvement scheme, following which the resort was known as Funcoast World. Around this time, many of the structures were subject to change with the demolition of many chalets and some central buildings including the Windsor dining hall and Empire theatre. The 1980s saw the removal of the miniature railway and chairlift system, but also saw the construction of a new indoor swimming pool named the Funsplash and an outdoor fun pool. As with its Bognor Regis and Minehead counterparts, the Skegness resort underwent further improvement work in 1998 with the construction of the Skyline Pavilion. This tented structure is described by tourism writer Bruce Prideaux as a \\"Baby Millennium Dome\\" even though it pre-dated the dome. The Pavilion contains entertainment facilities such as stages, bars, restaurants, shops and amusements.Prideaux 2009, p.81 The improvement programme also included the construction of 1,045 brand new accommodation units, making it the largest timber-frame construction project in Europe that year. At the same time, the company dropped its use of the possessive apostrophe, changing from Butlin's to Butlins; after the refurbishment the resort was renamed as Butlins Resort Skegness, as it remains to date. Butlins Resort Skegness Today the resort caters for over 400,000 visitors per year with 350,000 being resident and 70,000 visiting for the day. Along with the nearby Fantasy Island amusement park, the resort is the largest employer in the Skegness area, and currently employs 1,200 staff each year, 40 of which make up the Redcoat team. According to the national police profile of the local residents, a large proportion of the Butlins workforce is now Eastern European in origin. Over the years many of the attractions have been removed, including the monorail at the end of 2002. However the resort still retains several swimming pools and a funfair. Today it provides a range of activities such as rock climbing, fencing, and archery. It also provides a wide range of entertainment, aided by the formation of strategic partnerships with popular brands, including The X Factor, Britain's Got Talent, Thomas & Friends, Brainiac: Science Abuse, Guinness World Records, Bob the Builder, Pingu and Angelina Ballerina. Pop culture and other influences In 1962 the camp played a part in the formation of the rock band the Beatles, when Paul McCartney and John Lennon visited to meet Ringo Starr, who was playing drums with Rory Storm and the Hurricanes at the time, to offer Starr the drummer's position with The Beatles, who had just secured a recording contract.Hailey 2001, p.200 Storm's group had a summer booking at the camp, following on from the previous year.Harry 2005, p. 3 It was in 1960 whilst playing Butlin's Pwllheli camp that Richard Starkey developed his stage name Ringo Starr.Harry 2005, p. 5 The first song McCartney himself ever sang in public was \\"Long Tall Sally\\", at a Butlin's talent competition.White 2003, p. 114‚Äì115 For several years between 1956 and 1959, the comedian and TV presenter Dave Allen worked as a Redcoat at the camp. For Allen it was his first experience of fame (within the community of campers) and he found that he could not escape it, saying, \\"You can't get away once they know you--unless you lock yourself in your chalet. If you put on a moustache and dark glasses they'd think you were doing a stunt.\\"Fletcher 1974, p. 150 Other acts who have performed at the camp during the careers include Laurel and Hardy, T'Pau, and Suzi Quatro. In his 2010 book How to Land an A330 Airbus (And Other Vital Skills for the Modern Man), James May included a section entitled \\"How to Escape from Butlins\\" ‚Äì specifically, Butlins Skegness in the event of hostile forces using it as an internment camp.

Ancient Egyptian mathematics as discussed here spans a time period ranging from 3000 BC to ca. 300 BC. We only have a limited number of resources (problems) from ancient Egypt that concern algebra. Problems of an algebraic nature appear in both the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus (MMP) and in the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus (RMP) as well as several other sources. Fractions The mathematical writings show that the scribes used (least) common multiples to turn problems with fractions into problems using integers. The multiplicative factors were often recorded in red ink and are referred to as Red auxiliary numbers. Aha problems, linear equations and false position Aha problems involve finding unknown quantities (referred to as Aha) if the sum of the quantity and part(s) of it are given. The Rhind Mathematical Papyrus also contains four of these type of problems. Problems 1, 19, and 25 of the Moscow Papyrus are Aha problems. For instance problem 19 asks one to calculate a quantity taken 1 and ¬Ω times and added to 4 to make 10. In other words, in modern mathematical notation we are asked to solve the linear equation: :\\\\frac{3}{2} x + 4 = 10. Solving these Aha problems involves a technique called method of false position. The technique is also called the method of false assumption. The scribe would substitute an initial guess of the answer into the problem. The solution using the false assumption would be proportional to the actual answer, and the scribe would find the answer by using this ratio. Pefsu problems Many of the practical problems contained in the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus are pefsu problems: 10 of the 25 problems. A pefsu measures the strength of the beer made from a heqat of grain : \\\\mbox{pefsu} = \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{number loaves of bread (or jugs of beer)}}{\\\\mbox{number of heqats of grain}}. A higher pefsu number means weaker bread or beer. The pefsu number is mention in many offering lists. For example problem 8 translates as: : (1) Example of calculating 100 loaves of bread of pefsu 20 : (2) If someone says to you: ‚ÄúYou have 100 loaves of bread of pefsu 20 : (3) to be exchanged for beer of pefsu 4 : (4) like 1/2 1/4 malt-date beer : (5) First calculate the grain required for the 100 loaves of the bread of pefsu 20 : (6) The result is 5 heqat. Then reckon what you need for a des-jug of beer like the beer called 1/2 1/4 malt-date beer : (7) The result is 1/2 of the heqat measure needed for des-jug of beer made from Upper-Egyptian grain. : (8) Calculate 1/2 of 5 heqat, the result will be 2 : (9) Take this 2 four times : (10) The result is 10. Then you say to him: : (11) Behold! The beer quantity is found to be correct. Geometrical progressions The use of the Horus eye fractions shows some (rudimentary) knowledge of geometrical progression. One unit was written as 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + 1/64 + 1/64. But the last copy of 1/64 was written as 5 ro, thereby writing 1 = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + 1/64 + (5 ro). These fractions were further used to write fractions in terms of 1 / 2^k terms plus a remainder specified in terms of ro as shown in for instance the Akhmim wooden tablets. Arithmetical progressions Knowledge of arithmetic progressions is also evident from the mathematical sources.

It is a sweet snack made by mixing boiled potatoes with a special dabeli masala, putting the mixture in a ladi pav (burger bun), and serving it with chutneys made from tamarind, date, garlic, red chilies, etc. It is garnished with pomegranate and roasted peanuts. Dabeli literally means \\"pressed\\" in Gujarati language. It is said to be invented by one Keshavji Gabha Chudasama alias Kesha Malam, resident of Mandvi, and Mohan bavaji mandviKutch in the 1960s. When he started business he sold a dabeli at one anna or six paisa. His shop is still there in Mandvi and business is now carried by his next generations.http://whatscookingindia.com/kacchi-dabeli- recipe-dabeli-recipe-dabeli-masala-recipe/ Dabeli thus has its origin in Mandvi, a city of the Kutch region and even today dabeli masala made in the city are said to be most authentic. The dabeli is also, therefore, known as Kachchhi dabeli or Kutchi dabeli taking its cue from the region of its origin. Bhuj and Nakhatrana towns of Kutch are also known for authentic dabeli apart from Mandvi. Preparation # Combine the dabeli masala, meethi chutney and a little water (approx. 1 tbsp) in a bowl and mix well. # Heat the oil in a non- stick pan, add the prepared dabeli masala mixture, mix well and cook on a medium flame for 1 minute, while stirring continuously. # The bun is heated on a pan and then it is filled with the filling of boiled potato mixture, dabeli masala and chutney. Further notes *Dabeli masala, which is the main ingredient of the dish, is readily available in most of the cities all over India, sold under various brand names mainly manufactured and packed in Kutch. The dabeli masala made from Mandvi and Bhuj are preferred by people for their taste and authenticity. This dabeli masala is a dry-paste made from dried red- chillies, black-pepper powder, dried coconut, salt, clove, cinnamon, coriander, cumin, turmeric, elachi, badiyan, black-salt, tej-patta and other garam masalas is a specially prepared masala. The debeli masala once made or purchased from shops can be stored and used for over a period of six to twelve months. *Chutney is an essential part of almost all type of Indian cuisine and these type of chutneys can be prepared in advance and stored and used for at least a fortnight. Now-a-days specially preserved chutney packets are available also in shops in major cities of India and are exported to other countries by some Indian food companies. * Sev referred above is a type of Indian farsan, which is readily available in farsan shops in all over India and also in other countries, where it is being exported by companies like Haldiram's and others. Cooking time *With ready-made dabeli masala, chutneys made-in-advance, Sev readily available, roasted pea-nuts, pomegranate and boiled potato, dabeli hardly takes 8‚Äì10 minutes to be prepared and as such has become a popular Indian fast food. Popularity Kutchi dabeli fillings Dabeli today is famous not only in Kutch and Gujarat but also throughout Maharashtra, parts of Telangana, Karnataka, Rajasthan and many other States of India. Dabeli stalls can be found in metropolitan cities like Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Nasik, Bangalore, Pune, Delhi, Nagpur, Hyderabad, Nizamabad, Raipur, Bilaspur, Jabalpur, Indore, Bhopal, Udaipur, Jaipur, Aurangabad, etc. besides all major cities, towns and tourist spots of Gujarat.

After their commissioning, Budapest and the two other Monarch-class ships made several training cruises in the Mediterranean Sea in the early 1900s. Budapest and her sisters formed the 1st Capital Ship Division of the Austro-Hungarian Navy until they were replaced by the newly commissioned pre-dreadnought battleships at the turn of the century. In 1906 the three Monarchs were placed in reserve and only recommissioned during the annual summer training exercises. After the start of World War I, Budapest was recommissioned and assigned to 5th Division together with her sisters. The division was sent to Cattaro in August 1914 to attack Montenegrin and French artillery that was bombarding the port, and they remained there until mid-1917. Budapest and her sister were sent to Trieste in August and bombarded Italian fortifications in the Gulf of Trieste. The ship was briefly decommissioned in early 1918 and became an accommodation ship, but she was fitted with a large siege howitzer for shore bombardment shortly afterwards and recommissioned. A shortage of ammunition caused the gun to be removed before it could be used, and Budapest reverted to her previous role. The ship was awarded to Great Britain by the Paris Peace Conference in 1920. The British sold her for scrap, and she was broken up in Italy beginning in 1921.  Description and construction Right elevation and plan of the Monarch class; the shaded area is armored. At only maximum displacement, the Monarch class was less than half the size of the battleships of other major navies at the time and were officially designated as coast defense ships. The Austro-Hungarian government believed that the role of its navy was solely to defend her coast. Budapest had an overall length of , a beam of and a draft of . Her two 4-cylinder vertical triple-expansion steam engines produced a total of using steam from 16 Belleville boilers. These gave the ship a maximum speed of . Budapests maximum load of of coal gave her a range of at a speed of . She was manned by 26 officers and 397 enlisted men, a total of 423 personnel. The armament of the Monarch class consisted of four Krupp K/94 guns mounted in two twin-gun turrets, one each fore and aft of the superstructure. The ships carried 80 rounds for each gun. Their secondary armament was six ≈†koda guns located in casemates in the superstructure. Defense against torpedo boats was provided by ten quick-firing (QF) ≈†koda guns and four 47-millimeter QF Hotchkiss guns. The ships also mounted two torpedo tubes, one on each broadside. Each torpedo tube was provided with two torpedoes. In 1917 a ≈†koda 7 cm K10 anti-aircraft gun was installed. The ship's nickel-steel waterline armor belt was thick, and the gun turrets were protected by of armor. The casemates had thick sides while the conning tower had of armor. Budapests deck armor was thick. The Monarch-class ships were ordered in May 1892 with Budapest and Wien to be built at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipyard in Trieste. Both ships were laid down on 16 February 1893, the first ships in the class to be laid down. Budapest was launched on 27 April 1896 by Countess Marie Sz√©ch√©ny√≠-Andr√°ssy, wife of the Governor of Fiume, and commissioned on 12 May 1898.  Service history = Peace time  A painting from Alexander Kircher showing SMS Wien and the other ships of the Monarch class on maneuvers Budapest and her sisters formed the Navy's 1st Capital Ship Division (I. Schwere Division), and Budapest conducted the first wireless telegraphy trials in the Navy when she was briefly fitted with a Marconi radio in December 1898. In late 1899 the division made a training cruise to the Eastern Mediterranean where they made port visits in Greece, Lebanon, Turkey and Malta. In early 1902 they made another training cruise to the Western Mediterranean with port visits in Algeria, Spain, France, Italy, Corfu, and Albania. The ship was fitted with a Siemens-Braun radio early the following year. The ships of the division were inspected by Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the throne, in March 1903 at Gravosa. Shortly afterwards, Budapest, Wien, the battleship and the destroyer made a cruise to the Eastern Mediterranean. In 1904, the Monarch-class ships formed the 2nd Capital Ship Division, and they took part in the 1904 cruise of the Adriatic and Mediterranean Seas as well as training exercises in which the three s engaged the Budapest and her sisters in simulated combat. Those maneuvers marked the first time two homogeneous squadrons consisting of modern battleships operated in the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The Monarchs were relegated to the newly formed Reserve Squadron on 1 January 1906 and were only recommissioned for the annual summer exercises. They participated in a fleet review by Archduke Franz Ferdinand in September conducted in the Kolocepski Channel near ≈†ipan. The ships were briefly recommissioned at the beginning of 1913 as the 4th Division after the start of the Second Balkan War, but were decommissioned again on 10 March.  World War I  A map of the upper Adriatic Sea With the beginning of World War I the three Monarchs were recommissioned as the 5th Division. They were sent to the Bay of Kotor in August 1914 to attack Montenegrin artillery batteries on Mount Lovƒáen bombarding the Austro-Hungarian naval base at Cattaro and the fortifications defending it. Budapest and her sisters arrived on 13 August, but their guns could not elevate enough to engage all of the enemy artillery, which was reinforced by eight French guns on 19 October. The battleship was summoned to deal with the guns two days later, and she managed to knock out several French guns and forced the others to withdraw by 27 October. When the Austro-Hungarian army was finally able to launch an offensive into Montenegro in January 1916, SMS Budapest was on hand to assist the ground troops against Lovƒáen's defences. The battleship's 9.5 inch and 6 inch guns pounded Montenegrin positions and on January 10 the ground forces took the Lovƒáen Pass and the adjacent heights where the French gun positions had been. In order for its guns to elevate high enough to hit the Montenegrin lines at the top of the mountain Budapest had to be trimmed 7 degrees. The naval bombardment played a decisive role in breaking the morale of the mountain's defenders and Montenegro requested an armistice two days later. Budapest was subsequently called to action in the Adriatic on 15 May 1917 when an Austro-Hungarian force of three light cruisers and destroyer escorts, returning from a major attack on the Otranto Straits, were intercepted by a stronger force of Allied warships led by HMS Dartmouth. The armoured cruiser SMS Sanct George with two destroyers and four torpedo-boats under Kontra- Admiral Alexander Hansa headed off to support the beleaguered Austrian force. Upon receiving news from a naval flying boat that nine enemy ships were in the vicinity of the Otranto force, Hansa called for SMS Budapest which immediately put to sea with three high seas torpedo boats as escorts. Upon sighting the smoke from the approaching Austro-Hungarian warships the Allied ships turned away and returned to port. The Sanct George and the Budapest escorted their little fleet, as it had become, back to Cattaro. The Monarchs remained at Cattaro until mid-1917 to deter any further attacks. In August, Budapest and Wien were transferred to Trieste to serve as guard ships against Italian commando raids. Each ship was fitted with a anti-aircraft gun after their arrival on 26 August to counter intense Italian air attacks. Wien was damaged by a near miss on 5 September, and both ships withdrew to Pola on 12 September. They returned to Trieste on 30 October and sortied into the Gulf of Trieste on 16 November to attack Italian coastal defenses at Cortellazzo, near the mouth of the Piave River. Budapest and Wien opened fire at 10:35 at a range of about and knocked out most of the Italian guns after about a half- hour. Their bombardment was interrupted by several unsuccessful Italian air attacks before a more coordinated attack was made by five MAS torpedo boats and five aircraft around 13:30. This was also unsuccessful, and the last Italian coast defense gun was knocked out an hour later. The ships had sustained only minor damage from several hits and near-misses, and not a single sailor was wounded. Emperor Karl inspected Budapest on 19 November at Trieste. Anxious to revenge themselves against the Austro-Hungarians, the Royal Italian Navy (Regia Marina) planned an attack on the two ships in their berths in the Bay of Muggia, near Trieste, by MAS boats. On the night of 9/10 December, two MAS boats managed to penetrate the harbor defenses undetected, and fired torpedoes at Wien and Budapest. The torpedoes fired at the Budapest struck the mole of the seaplane station, but Wien was hit twice and capsized in five minutes, killing 46 of the crew. Budapest was scheduled for a shore bombardment on 12 December, but was postponed for a week by bad weather. Escorted by the light cruiser , six destroyers, nine torpedo boats and a dozen minesweepers, Budapest and the pre-dreadnought bombarded the Castellazzo fortifications on 19 December. The ship transferred to Pola two days later, and she was decommissioned on 11 March 1918. She became the accommodation ship for the submarine staff (Wohnschiff der U-Bootleitung). Just over a week later, Admiral Franz von Keil proposed that a 38-centimeter siege howitzer be installed to bombard the Castellazzo fortifications. Little time was wasted, and removal of the forward gun turret and its barbette began on 26 March. The installation of the gun was completed on 4 April although testing did not begin until 5 June when three shots were fired. The ship was recommissioned two days later with a reduced crew, and a practice shoot was conducted with unsatisfactory results on 6 August. Another training exercise scheduled for 20 August had to be cancelled for lack of ammunition. The howitzer was removed on 11 October and sent to the Army on 17 October. Budapest resumed her former role and remained at Pola. She was handed over to Great Britain as war reparations in January 1920 and broken up for scrap in Italy in 1921.

It is one of the three central prisons other than Thiruvananthapuram and Kannur situated in Kerala state. It is one of the most important correctional and detention centers in the state. As per Kerala Prison Rules, the prison is meant to detain convicted habitual prisoners on a long-term basis. The prison has separate buildings designated as special jail and sub-jail meant for short-term convicts and people on trial, respectively. History Thrissur was the capital of the Kochi Kingdom for a long time hence the State Prison was located here. The original Thrissur Prison existed in front of Sri Vadakkumnathan Temple around 300 years ago. At the request of the prisoners, \\"Kudamattom\\" was conducted at the prison during the festival of Thrissur Pooram during the reign of H.H. Sakthan Thampuran, the Maharaja of Kochi. In 1914 the temple authority requested to shift the prison and consequently it was demolished and shifted to Viyyur. Almost 1,000 acres of land from the property of H.H. Parukutty Nethyaramma Consort Queen of Kochi and Wife of Maharaja Rama Varma were handed over to establish the new prison at Viyyur. Later much of this original land went into use for other state purposes such as All-India Radio, Television, a police training facility, Fire Force center etc. After independence, the Government of Kerala, took over the facility and converted to a Central Prison intended to detain long term prisoners. Property The prison originally had almost 1000 acres of land; however, several state establishments were subsequently established on its premises. This reduced the land available for exclusive use by the prison to 147 acres. Out of which, the Central Jail occupies a space of 17 acres. The remaining land is used for other prison facilities and buildings. Central Jail The Central Jail is located in the center of the entire prison property, separated from the rest of the area via a circular perimeter wall almost high, with a central watch tower at its center. There are six blocks for confining prisoners situated as the petals of a flower pointing towards the office block. Among the blocks A, B, C and D are made for cellular confinement having 44 cells each. F and E blocks are dormitory type having four compartments and the latter is used for female prisoners as a separate enclosure. Besides the prisoners blocks, there are separate buildings such as the kitchen, stores, manufactory section, library, hospital ward, prayer hall (consists of temple, church and mosque) and outside the prison the barrack hall, staff mess, staff canteen and cattle sheds etc. are situated. The prison has a separate library building and a well stocked library which has around 10,000 books in English, Hindi and Tamil languages. The library is open from 9 am to 5 pm every day and also houses an open auditorium. Capacity Kerala prison rules prescribe that every prisoner in a ward shall be allowed not less than 3.72 m2 of floor area and 17 m3 of breathing space. Accordingly, every cell of A, B, C and D blocks can accommodate two prisoners (measurement of a single cell 4.1 m √ó 2.3 m √ó 3.10 m (height) i.e. 9.43 m2 floor area and 12.53 m3 breathing space) and in F & E blocks (dormitories) 100 prisoners each. This means that in total 420 male prisoners and 100 female prisoners can be housed at Central Prison, Viyyur. The average prison population is around 630 male prisoners and 30 female prisoners. This reveals that male blocks are consistently overcrowded at around 50% over the authorised capacity.

S√∂dermanland Runic Inscription 352 or S√∂ 352 is a Viking Age memorial runestone located at Linga, which is about two kilometers south of J√§rna, Stockholm County, Sweden, which was in the historic province of S√∂dermanland. The inscription depicts a ship with an anchor and a portion of the runic text uses same-stave bind runes on the ship mast. Description This inscription consists of runic text carved on two serpents that bracket the image of ship, whose upper mast forms a Christian cross, with the text continued on the top and back of the stone. The inscription is classified as being carved in runestone style Fp, which is the classification for runic bands that end in serpent heads depicted as seen from above. A runestone with a similar design is S√∂ 158 in √ñsterberga, and it is believed that the same runemaster carved both S√∂ 158 and S√∂ 352 along with the nearby inscriptions S√∂ 350 at Valsta and S√∂ 351 in √ñverj√§rna. p. 197. Ship images appear on several Viking Age runic inscriptions, but the image on S√∂ 352 is unusual in that it apparently depicts a rope and anchor below the ship. The anchor does not appear to be made of iron, which was used only in the larger, more expensive ships, but is either a stone or made of stone and wood with rope lashings. Other runic inscriptions from the Viking Age which depict ships include DR 77 in Hjermind, DR 119 in Spentrup, DR 220 in S√∏nder Kirkeby, DR 258 in B√∂sarp, DR 271 in Tullstorp, DR 328 in Holmby, DR EM85;523 in Fars√∏, √ñg 181 in Ledberg, √ñg 224 in Stratomta, √ñg M√ñLM1960;230 in T√∂rnevalla, S√∂ 122 in Skresta, S√∂ 154 in Skarp√•ker, S√∂ 158 in √ñsterberga, S√∂ 164 in Sp√•nga, S√∂ 351 in √ñverj√§rna, Vg 51 in Husaby, U 370 in Herresta, U 979 in Gamla Uppsala, U 1052 in Axlunda, U 1161 in Altuna, and Vs 17 in R√•by. Three stones, the H√∏rdum and L√•ngtora kyrka stones and U 1001 in Rasbo, depict ships but currently do not have any runes on them and may never have had any. The runic text is in the younger futhark and states that the stone was raised by Helgulfr as a memorial to his kinsman by marriage named √ûorfastr, and by D√≠sa, who was the sister of √ûorfastr. The runes [b]ru√æur sin meaning \\"her brother\\" are carved along the mast of the ship under the cross using bind runes. A bind rune is a ligature that combines one or more runes into a single rune. Because the runes are vertically separated along a common stave, runologists further classify these bind runes as being same-stave runes. The use of these runes here is considered to have been ornamental. Although the stone is considered to be Christian due to the cross and ship imagery, two of the names in the text have theophoric name elements, with √ûorfastr referring to the Norse paganism Norse pagan god Thor and D√≠sa a nickname related to D√≠s, which refers to a protective female deity. Inscription Line A is on the front side of the stone with the serpent and ship images, line B is on the top, and line C is on the back. Transliteration of the runes into Latin characters :A : ailkuf Ä : rais√æi : stin : √æansi : [at] : √æurfast : mag : sin : tisa : at bru√æur sin ...

It is located on High Rock Road adjacent to the Mason‚ÄìDixon line. In 1877, the site was opened as an amusement park and resort area by the Western Maryland Railway (WM). During the summer months the railroad offered frequent train service on its \\"Blue Mountain Express\\" from Baltimore to Pen Mar. The WM also ran trains from Hagerstown, Maryland to Pen Mar. By the turn of the century, the Pen Mar area had become one of the most popular resort destinations in the eastern United States. Weekday crowds in the summer were often 4,000 to 5,000. The single day park attendance reached close to 20,000 visitors. Many hotels and over 100 boarding houses were built to accommodate the visitors to Pen Mar. Prominent among these lodgings was the Blue Mountain House, built by the WM in 1883, which accommodated 400 guests. High Rock, c. 1916 The WM sold the park in 1930, and the park closed entirely in 1943. By that time the park had contained a roller coaster, carousel, miniature train and railroad station, a dining hall seating 450 people, and a dance pavilion. Dining Hall in 1898 The park was reopened as a county park in 1977. In 1980 a group of citizens from both Pennsylvania and Maryland raised funds to build a multipurpose, public pavilion at the site of the original dance pavilion. The county currently sponsors dance concerts with live music in the pavilion during the spring, summer and fall seasons. Other attractions include recreation areas in the county park; the Appalachian Trail, which passes through the area; and nearby High Rock Summit in South Mountain State Park.

Early life Major General Abrar Hussain was born on 2 September 1918 in a Taluqdar family of Oudh. He was educated at La Martinere School and Colvin Taluqdars' College, Lucknow, where he excelled in both academics and sports. His excellent personal conduct and exemplary character led the College Principal to declare him as \\"the best boy who has passed through my hands in 10 years.\\" These qualities would continue to be the hallmark of Abrar Hussain for the rest of his eventful life. In 1939, he graduated in History, Political Science and English Literature from Allahbad University. On the outbreak of World War II, he joined the Indian Military Academy at Dehradun and was commissioned into the British Indian Army on 31 July 1940 and posted to 2nd Battalion of 10th Baluch Regiment (now 7 Baloch).Arif, Gen KM. (18 April 1992). A General to Remember. The Muslim. His brother (later Brigadier) Noor Ahmad Hussain, served as an aide-de-camp (ADC) to Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah.http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=8183&Cat;=13 World War II In October 1940, 2/10th Baluch was dispatched to Malaya in anticipation of the impending war with Japan. On 8 December 1941, Japan invaded Malaya and rapidly overran the British forces, who surrendered on Singapore Island on 15 February 1942. Among the Allied Prisoners of War was 2/10th Baluch, who had given an excellent account of themselves despite the Allied defeat. The Japanese separated Indian officers and men from the British and subjected them to intense propaganda and pressure to join the Japanese- sponsored 'Indian National Army' (INA). The Baluchis mostly stood firm. Prominent among them was Lieutenant Abrar Hussain, who refused to betray his Honour. The Japanese sent him along with 150 recalcitrant Gurkhas for use as coastal mine-breaching suicide troops on successive island landings. After three such landings, the group arrived on the island of New Britain in the South Pacific, where they were used for building airstrips. Led by their gallant commander, the group remained defiant despite severe privations and cruelty of their Japanese captors. By 1945, the Allies had severely disrupted Japanese communications in the South Pacific resulting in starvation among the Japanese, who reportedly had turned to cannibalism. Lieutenant Abrar not only managed to survive, but also demanded and received the surrender of the thousand-strong Japanese garrison. :In December 1945, an Australian force arrived in New Britain and were astonished to find it in Allied hands, even if the commander and his men were skeletons in rags, carrying Japanese weapons.Ellis, Capt Jim. (3.4.1992). Major-General Abrar Hussain. The Times of London. For his exemplary conduct, personal bravery and strength of character, Lieutenant Abrar Hussain was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). Career in Pakistan Army On the independence of Pakistan in 1947, Abrar Hussain opted for Pakistan. In 1949, he graduated from the Command and Staff College, Quetta. His varied appointments in Pakistan Army included Command of 17 Baluch (now 19 Baloch), instructor at Staff College and staff appointments at General Headquarters, Rawalpindi as Deputy Director Military Operations, Deputy Director and then Director Staff Duties. Here, he was directly involved from 1955 to 1958 in the induction of US military equipment for modernisation of four infantry and one and a half armoured divisions. He was promoted Brigadier in 1956. As Military Secretary from 1958 to 1964, he was also president of the Army Reforms Committee. Promoted Major General in 1964, he was given the task of converting 100 (Independent) Armoured Brigade Group into 6 Armoured Division. The fact that he was an infantry officer and yet had been entrusted with the raising of an armoured formation, speaks volumes of the esteem in which he was held by the Army High Command. He would soon vindicate that confidence in the coming war with India. The 6 Armoured Division was still a paper formation without a division's normal complement of fighting or supporting elements. There were only two armoured regiments and one infantry battalion, while there were no integral brigade headquarters in the division.Jilani, Capt AA. (September 1992). The Valiant Warrior. Pakistan Army Journal. The main thrust of the Indian offensive was in the Sialkot Sector, where they attacked with three infantry and one armoured divisions. Facing them was the overstretched 15 Infantry Division. As enemy intentions became clear, and he made inroads towards Chawinda, 6 Armoured Division was inducted into the battle. The 24 Infantry Brigade was provided to General Abrar, and with these meagre resources, he was ordered stop the enemy. For some time, the situation for Pakistan was critical. It was here that his strength of character, calmness and indomitable spirit provided the inspiration to his outnumbered and outgunned troops, who stood firm in the face of overwhelming odds. Some of the fiercest tank battles since World War II were fought on the Battlefield of Chawinda but every attempt by the Indians to breakthrough was foiled. In the words of General KM Arif, who was then a staff officer in 6 Armoured Division: :The Battle of Chawinda produced moments of extreme anxiety and pressure. General Abrar remained composed during the battle, never losing sense of balance and cool nerves. On three occasions when some others got adversely affected, he stood firm and provided leadership of high quality. On 11 September, the enemy attacked the Chawinda defences held by a weak force which had taken over the responsibility only hours earlier. The attackers and defenders suffered considerable losses in the encounter. This was the worst situation faced by 6 Armoured Division in the war. Inspiring the division from the front, Abrar went to the critical part of the frontline, relieved the force with an infantry brigade and stabilised the situation before returning to his Headquarters. By 22 September, the war would end in ceasefire. Major General Abrar Hussain and his 'Men of Steel' had saved the day for Pakistan. For his inspiring leadership and skilful conduct of operations, he was awarded the Hilal-i-Jurat. He remains one of Pakistan's most successful field commanders. In 1968, General Abrar was commanding the Command and Staff College, Quetta, when he asked for early retirement due to some irreconcilable differences with GHQ. Typical of him, he never complained or uttered any grievances. On 16 April 1975, in retirement, General Abrar suffered a stroke which paralysed the right side of his body and impeded his speech. He battled against the affliction for seventeen long years with the same quiet dignity and fortitude with which he had lived his life. On 15 March 1992, the grand old soldier and gentleman; one of Pakistan's greatest military heroes, faded away from this world. NotesFurther reading * Ahmad, Lt Col Rifat Nadeem. (2010).

Located 60 kilometers from Mexico City, and 30 from Toluca. The community is famous for the wool knit and woven items that are made by the local artisans. Each weekend takes place a market of textile handicrafts in the main street. History The construction of the main temple began in 1679 and ended in 1789, as it is indicated by an inscription in the South Tower of the temple. Demographics In 1990 it has a population of 2812 inhabitants and 6385 in 2000, which represents the 10.9% of the total population of the municipality. Government Gualupita belongs to the municipality of Tianguistenco, and therefore belongs to the Eleventh District Court whose seat is Tenango de Arista; the sixth State electoral district with headquarters in Santiago Tianguistenco and 35th federal electoral district in the city of Tenancingo. Local community is governed by its delegates. Economy Most economic activity is produced by artisanal and industrial textiles trade. Agriculture and livestock are little practised activities. On Saturday the community organizes a \\"tianguis\\" where fresh fruits and vegetables are sold. On Sunday, the local people sells artisanal and industrial clothes. Handicrafts Woven items are made on colonial style wood looms many of which have been in families for generations. Textile arts here date back at least to 1472 using fibers from the maguey plant.

The cuneiform lu sign is a common, multi-use sign, a syllabic for lu, and an alphabetic sign used for l, or u; it has many other sub-uses, as seen in the Epic of Gilgamesh over hundreds of years, and the 1350 BC Amarna letters. Its other uses show other syllabic and alphabetic forms that it can be used for: other vowels, or consonants; (in Akkadian d can replace t, and b and p are also interchangeable). There are also four sumerogrammic sub-forms for \\"lu\\" in the Epic of Gilgamesh, LU, and UDU, and DAB and DIB; LU transposes to Akkadian language, \\"lull√ª\\", for English language, (primitive) man;Parpola, 197l.

The usage numbers for lu (sign no. 537) in the Epic of Gilgamesh are as follows:Parpola, 197l. The Standard Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, Sign List, pp. 155-165, Sign No. 537, lu, p. 164. dab-(2) times, dap-(4), dib-(1), lu-(293), tep-(1), t√†b-(1), tib-(4), DAB-(4), DIB-(1), LU-(9), UDU-(1).Parpola, 197l. The Standard Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, Sign List, pp. 155-165, no. 537, Lu, p. 156. The lu cuneiform sign is within a small group of signs that are composed of 1- or 2-vertical strokes (at right or left), the other signs being no. 535 Ib (cuneiform), no. 536 ku (cuneiform) (only 1-vertical, left and right), no. 575 ur (cuneiform), and g√°b (cuneiform). Besides ≈°a usage in word components of verbs, nouns, etc., it has a major usage between words. In Akkadian, for English language \\"who\\", it is an interrogative pronoun; in the Akkadian language as ≈°a, (as \\"that\\", \\"what\\"; (\\"that (of)\\", \\"which (of)\\"Parpola, 197l. The Standard Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, Glossary, pp. 119-145, ≈°a, p. 139.), in English it used for who, what, which, etc..  ≈†a, and Ka, the stroke differences  The difference in the construction of the signs ka and ≈°a are as follows: \\"ka\\" when scribed in the Amarna letters often shows the distinctiveness of the right section of the sign, versus the left section. For ≈°a, the right section is constructed with two wedge strokes 100x24px (one scribed above the other), between the two verticals, at right. For ka, the right side mostly, in the Amarna letters has two verticals, 100x24px100x24px with two horizontals 100x24px that cross both of them; (the right side is like a two-step ladder shape‚Äî(for Hittite ka:‚Äî100x24px)). A good example of ≈°a, is shown for EA 365, Reverse (top half), where the 2-wedge strokes of ≈°a between the 2-right verticals is clear. (Note, the ≈°a of EA 365 appears to have 3-horizontals at left (differing lengths), then the 2-verticals with the 2-wedge strokes, at right.)  ≈†a Usage numbers = Epic of Gilgamesh  The usage numbers for lu (sign no. 537) in the Epic of Gilgamesh are as follows:Parpola, 197l. The Standard Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, Sign List, pp. 155-165, Sign No. 019, ≈°a, p. 161. ≈°a-(66) times. There are no other sub-uses or sumerogramic uses for ≈°a in the Epic of Gilgamesh.  Amarna letters  Cuneiform ≈°a is common in the Amarna letters, found easily between words (as the pronoun), and especially in word constructs. Since it is similar in appearance to cuneiform ka, the large difference is that ka can easily be found as a suffix to words, for example in the Canaanite sub-corpus of letters as \\"Servant-Yours\\", 100x24px100x24px, (ARAD-ka).

In his review of Noel T. Boaz's, Evolving Health: The Origins of Illness and How the Modern World is Making Us Sick, Corruccini states,  Research at Newton plantation  Not long after Corruccini's arrival in Carbondale, he commenced a collaborative research study with Jerome Handler focusing on slave populations who were buried in Barbados circa 1660-1820, a collaboration that would span over a decade and result in numerous publications. Handler joined the faculty at Southern Illinois University-Carbondale in 1962, first as an instructor, and later as a tenured professor after he earned his PhD in anthropology from Brandeis University in 1965. Corruccini and Handler's first publication together on the Newton sugar plantation was based on a study of the slaves' dentition. This and subsequent research was funded by associations such as the National Science Foundation, the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research, Southern Illinois University Office of Development and Research, and the National Geographic Society.

New York Times career  He was posted as a foreign correspondent in West Germany from 1964‚Äì1968, with responsibilities for covering East and West Germany, Scandinavia, and Czechoslovakia; then posted to Tokyo, from 1968‚Äì1970, with responsibilities for covering Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand. Returning to the U.S., he then covered economics and labor for the NY Times‚Äôs Washington Bureau. He was White House correspondent during the Nixon and Ford administrations. Mr. Shabecoff served as The NY Times‚Äôs environmental correspondent from 1977 to 1999. He has been described as ‚Äúa pioneer‚Äù for breaking new ground in defining environmental news and setting a standard for coverage that earned him the sobriquet of ‚Äúdean of environmental journalism.‚Äù He left the NY Times in 1999. He then founded and, for five years, served as publisher of Greenwire, the daily online digest of worldwide environmental news coverage, which remains today a leading source of environmental news. It was bought in 2000 by Environment & Energy Publishing. He was one of the founding members of the Society of Environmental Journalists. He has been a contributing author to American Government, by Charles Hamilton, and The Presidency Reappraised, Thomas Cronin and Rexford Tugwell, editors. Mr. Shabecoff has appeared on Meet the Press, Face the Nation, Washington Week in Review, CNN News, The Diane Rehm Show, C-SPAN, National Public Radio, and the BBC.  Books  A Fierce Green Fire, published by Hill & Wang, in 1993 (and published as paperback by Island Press, 2003) was his first full-length book. It is the definitive history and analysis of American environmentalism, from its early seeds in efforts to preserve wilderness through its maturity as a social, political and cultural movement; it offers the hope that ‚Äúwe will be able to save ourselves from the grave dangers we have created by our destructive use of the natural world.‚Äù That was followed by A New Name for Peace: International Environmentalism, Sustainable Development and Democracy, published by the University Press of New England in 1996, which provides a history of international environmentalism from its beginnings, and uses the 1992 Rio Earth Summit to analyze the successes and failures of environmental actions worldwide; concluding that peace must be based on mutual care for the planet and the well-being of others with whom we share it. Earth Rising: American Environmentalism in the 21st Century, published by Island Press in 2000, analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of the American environmental movement, calling for a broader, more inclusive movement with a role in reforming education, politics, the economy and science to transform the future. In that book, he argued that environmental concerns can not be met without confronting other issues, mainly social and economical. He thus underlined the failure to \\"recognize and acknowledge that the decline of the environment is not an issue distinct from other flaws in our society\\" and that environmentalists \\"are in the same boat with other groups of Americans who are thwarted and victimized by the status quo,\\" and \\"[t]hey will have to play a role in changing our political and economic systems.\\"Philip Shabecoff, Earth Rising, p. 179 (2000).

The inventory in a warehouse such as this one decreases via a stochastic process due to sales until it gets replenished by a new order. In applied probability, a regenerative process is a class of stochastic process with the property that certain portions of the process can be treated as being statistically independent of each other. This property can be used in the derivation of theoretical properties of such processes. History Regenerative processes were first defined by Walter L. Smith in Proceedings of the Royal Society A in 1955. Definition A regenerative process is a stochastic process with time points at which, from a probabilistic point of view, the process restarts itself. These time point may themselves be determined by the evolution of the process. That is to say, the process {X(t), t ‚â• 0} is a regenerative process if there exist time points 0 ‚â§ T0 < T1 < T2 < ... such that the post-Tk process {X(Tk + t) : t ‚â• 0} * has the same distribution as the post-T0 process {X(T0 + t) : t ‚â• 0} * is independent of the pre-Tk process {X(t) : 0 ‚â§ t < Tk} for k ‚â• 1. Intuitively this means a regenerative process can be split into i.i.d. cycles. When T0 = 0, X(t) is called a nondelayed regenerative process. Else, the process is called a delayed regenerative process. Examples *Renewal processes are regenerative processes, with T1 being the first renewal. *Alternating renewal processes, where a system alternates between an 'on' state and an 'off' state. *A recurrent Markov chain is a regenerative process, with T1 being the time of first recurrence. This includes Harris chains. *Reflected Brownian motion is a regenerative process (where one measures the time it takes particles to leave and come back).

Dynamo played Bayer Uerdingen in the quarter finals, winning the first leg at home 2‚Äì0, with Lippmann scoring the opening goal. However, in a match dubbed 'The Miracle of the Grotenburg', Dynamo Dresden led 5‚Äì1 on aggregate at half-time before, in the space of 30 second half minutes, Uerdingen scored six goals to win 7‚Äì5 on aggregate. Following the match in Krefeld, Lippmann escaped from the team's hotel, committing the act of Republikflucht. Lippmann was handed a one-year suspension from football. Despite Dynamo Dresden's elimination in the quarter- finals, Lippmann was the joint top scorer in the European Cup Winners Cup.
