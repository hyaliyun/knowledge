Sex advice columns may take the form of essays or, more frequently, answers to questions posed by readers. Sex advice columns can usually be found in alt weekly newspapers, women's magazines, health or fitness magazines, and student newspapers. While some are written by trained sexologists, many are penned by people lacking credentials in human sexuality and relationships, yet willing to divulge their opinions or personal bedroom antics. The television series Sex and the City protagonist Carrie Bradshaw was a sex columnist, which author Candace Bushnell modeled after herself in her original non-fiction book based on a column of the same name. The show, which first aired in 1998, is credited with the increase of sex columnists found in college campus newspapers and blogs,Some pertinent articles in the media: * Patterson, Randall, \\"Students of Virginity\\", New York Times Magazine, March 30, 2008. Refers to Lena Chen's Harvard blog. \\"Perhaps no one at Harvard represents the hookup culture better than Lena Chen, a student sex blogger ... Chen's viewpoint, as she explained it to me, was not complicated. 'For me, being a strong woman means not being ashamed that I like to have sex,' she said. And 'to say that I have to care about every person I have sex with is an unreasonable expectation. It feels good!

After James Truman became editor-in-chief and transformed Details into a men's magazine, he offered Radakovich a column in September 1990.

It consists of three distinct parts, each of which is covered in a separate article: the Hayle Estuary, the sand-dune system of Porth Kidney Sands and the coastal headland at Carrack Gladden. Geography Hayle Estuary and Carrack Gladden SSSI is on the southern shore of St Ives Bay and to the west of the town of Hayle. The estuary of the River Hayle is the most south-westerly in Britain and adjacient to important bird migration routes which cross the Land's End peninsula. Part of the estuary, at Ryan's Field and Carnsew Pool, is owned by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). Two long distant footpaths transverse or are close to the boundary of the SSSI. The South West Coast Path follows the coast from Carrack Gladden to North Quay, Hayle, while St Michael‚Äôs Way also follows the coast at Carrack Gladden as far as Griggs Quay. The St Ives Bay Line also follows part of the boundary. Birdlife As the Hayle Estuary is the most south westerly in Britain it is important for wintering wildfowl, waders and gulls as well as for vagrants from North America. The most numerous ducks on the estuary are Eurasian teal and Eurasian wigeon, with a few gadwall and smaller numbers of common goldeneye and red-breasted mergansers. Waders in winter include some red knot, spotted redshank, common greenshank and common sandpiper among the more common species. Little egret are also present. In passage times the numbers of waders increase and North American vagrant species are recorded with some regularity, the most frequent being pectoral sandpiper, white-rumped sandpiper and long- billed dowitcher. =Industry= Hawke's Point Mine (also known as Wheal Fanny Adela) was in operation between 1851 and 1870, producing 670 tons of copper, 1 ton of ochre and some tin. The main workings were at Carrack Gladden and tunnels can still be seen from the beach. The workings at Hawke's Point was reopened in 1883, employing nineteen men. An old adit narrowly missed a copper lode and cobalt was also found. ‚Ä≥Mine materials, Machinery and Effects‚Ä≥ were sold by auction on 31 October, 1884. Lots included a long wood-built house with galvanised iron roof, horse-whim, portable forge, stone crusher, etc. References External links * English Nature SSSIs site * Summary and site details Category:Hayle Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Cornwall Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest notified in 1951 ","title":"Hayle Estuary and Carrack Gladden SSSI"},{"id":"2539733","text":"Peter D. Adkison is an American game designer and businessman who is the founder and first CEO of Wizards of the Coast (1993‚Äì2001). During Adkison's tenure, Wizards of the Coast rose to the status of a major publisher in the hobby game industry. Wizards achieved success with its creation of Magic: the Gathering, which started the collectible card game genre. It also distributed the Pok√©mon trading cards, and later acquired TSR, publisher of the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game, releasing a successful new edition. Adkison is the current owner of Gen Con, a major yearly game convention in the Midwest. In 1999, Adkison sold Wizards of the Coast to Hasbro, remaining with the company until January 2001. As a longtime fan of role-playing games (RPGs), Adkison has become an advocate for indie RPGs. His own game design work includes The Primal Order, a \\"capstone system\\" for use with any of a number of different role-playing games. Background As a child, Adkison enjoyed playing strategy games and war games, and in 1978, was exposed to Dungeons & Dragons, which \\"blew [him] away.\\" His friend, Terry Campbell, suggested the idea of starting a game company to Adkison and his friends using the name \\"Wizards of the Coast\\", based on a guild of which one of their player characters was a member. In the early 1980s, Adkison self-published a wargame for fantasy role- playing games called Castles & Conquest, using the \\"Wizards of the Coast\\" brand. In 1981, he created a Dungeons & Dragons campaign titled Chaldea, which he continues to run today. As of 2002, Adkison was running two Dungeons & Dragons campaigns and playing in three. He enjoys a wide variety of games including Magic: the Gathering, Twitch, The Settlers of Catan, Robo Rally, Call of Cthulhu, Vampire: The Masquerade, and the Legend of the Five Rings Roleplaying Game. While working at Hidden City Games, his public biography from 2005 claimed that he was married to Melissa Reis Adkison. In 2014, Adkison married Dee Fenton.State of Colorado marriage license No. 2014-1619 Career Adkison received a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from Walla Walla College in 1985. He also has a MBA degree from the University of Washington. From 1985 to 1991, he worked as a systems analyst for Boeing. While working for Boeing, he became involved in the founding of Wizards of the Coast. Adkison suggested to his friend, Ken McGlothlen, that they start a company, and Wizards of the Coast was soon founded on May 23, 1990. The company began working on its first project ‚Äì Adkison's own The Primal Order ‚Äì immediately, although it was not released until April 1992. Adkison asked game designer Richard Garfield to develop a game that would be cheaper to produce than Garfield's proposed board game RoboRally; Garfield developed his idea to combine baseball cards with a card game into what would eventually become Magic: The Gathering (1993). With that game's success, Adkison began working full-time for Wizards of the Coast. As TSR was facing financial insolvency, Ryan Dancey of Five Rings Publishing Group brokered a deal for the purchase of TSR and then brought it to Adkison; Wizards of the Coast announced their purchase of TSR on April 10, 1997. Adkison paid about US$30 million for TSR, including payment of debts, and bought Five Rings Publishing as part of the deal. Adkison appointed Mary Kirchoff to manage TSR's book publishing division, and Bill Slavicsek the head of RPG research and development; he also made Lisa Stevens the brand manager for the RPGA and Greyhawk, and put Ryan Dancey in charge of TSR's business and marketing concerns. He improved TSR's relationship with Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson by making favorable financial and legal arrangements with them. Adkison also restored the company's relationship with Margaret Weis, Tracy Hickman, and R.A. Salvatore. Adkison was planning a third edition of Dungeons & Dragons even during the TSR acquisition, and put Bill Slavicsek in charge of the design team, later naming Jonathan Tweet the new leader of the third edition project. Adkison was an old friend of Christian Moore from Last Unicorn Games, and when that company was having its own financial troubles, Wizards of the Coast purchased it in July 2000. Peter Adkison at Origins Game Fair 2003 Hasbro purchased Wizards of the Coast in 1999. Adkison began working on a Dungeons & Dragons MMORPG based on a design from Richard Garfield and Skaff Elias. According to game designer Ed Stark, Adkison said, \\"Look, computer gaming is the future of roleplaying. We've got to get involved in this.\\" However, Hasbro folded up the D&D; computer rights into Hasbro Interactive and then sold them to Infogrames, leaving Wizards with no rights to publish D&D; computer games; Adkison thus tendered his resignation, effective December 31, 2000. In January 2001, Adkison sold Wizards of the Coast to Hasbro and entered \\"semi-retirement\\", engaging in rock-climbing and \\"lying around\\". In May 2002, Adkison purchased Gen Con from Hasbro, which he had been attending since 1992. Adkison claims to have \\"always loved\\" Gen Con. As of 2005, Adkison is the CEO of Hidden City Games, publishers of the Bella Sara collectible card game for girls. As of 2013, he has started a production company known as Hostile Work Environment LLC. Accolades In 1999, Pyramid magazine named Peter Adkison as one of The Millennium's Most Influential Persons \\"at least in the realm of adventure gaming\\".

Buncio : 10 September 1988 ‚Äì 15 May 2011) was a Filipino motorcycle racer and four-time Philippine national superbike champion. He died after a race accident in Clark, Pampanga Philippines on 15 May 2011. Family From Mandaluyong City, Buncio is the son of Gregorio \\"Yoyong\\" Buncio, a motorcycle racer, mechanic, and modifier. His mother is Mylene Buncio. He has four other siblings, namely Lourdes, Shara, Jacquelyn, and Barny. Early life and career Buncio's father gave him the name \\"Maico\\" from a European motorcycle brand. At the age of three, he had started to learn riding motorcycles before bicycles. His training began early under the mentoring of his experienced father. Buncio started his motocross competition career at the age of eight. He won first place in the 1996 FBO Motorcross Series 50cc category for ten years old and below held at the TRAKSNIJAK Race Track in Tagaytay City. At the age of 14, Buncio represented the Philippines in Perris, California at the FMF Memorial Day Motorcross Races, winning first place in the Mini Class 85cc for the 14 years old and below category. Education Buncio took up Bachelor of Science in Commerce, Major in Entrepreneurship at the University of Santo Tomas. Buncio was a consistent honor student since elementary and studied in OB Montessori until high school. He also finished his computer New Media Design Course from Phoenix One Knowledge Solutions in Makati on his latter years. Career Buncio was the sole representative of the Philippines in the 2004 Yamaha ASEAN Cup held at Shah Alam, Malaysia, where he raced against competitors from Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Indonesia. He won the fourth overall title for the country despite having to start from the back of the grid and having to race against five representing riders each from the other competing countries. This feat earned him the title Rookie of the Year from the organizers of said event. Yamaha rider Buncio dominated the underbone racing 150 cc category for four years since 2006 before placing second to Suzuki rider Johnlery Enriquez in the 2010 event sponsored by Motorcycle Taipei Research Team and PAGCOR Sports. Buncio also broke records at the 3.2-kilometer Batangas Racing Circuit with a lap time of one minute, 49 seconds (400cc Superbike category) and two minutes, seven seconds (Underbone category). 2007 was the \\"most memorable\\" for Buncio when, at the age of 19, he broke the winning streak of ten-time Rider of the Year, Jolet Jao in the 2007 Shell Advance Superbikes Series. Buncio held the Superbike National Champion title for the next three years. He also finished a race in the AMA Superbike 600cc class in Laguna Seca U.S.A. on September 2008. In 2009, Buncio was chosen as the endorser for Accel Sports Sporteum Philippines Inc. Buncio was also awarded the Golden Wheel Awards Driver of the Year in 2010 and 2011. He has ridden mostly Yamaha bikes in his entire career with Factory Yamaha and YRS until he signed for Team Suzuki Pilipinas in late 2010 Maico was also a businessman, opened his own YRS Motorcycle Racing shop in Caloocan, and was a race director of the Moto ROC underbone race series. He is a big fan of Valentino Rossi of MotoGP and always dreamed to compete in international motorcycle racing. He often carries his trademark logo and the iconic race number \\"129\\" usually in a form of a sticker on his apparel and motorcycles. Death Maico Buncio fell a high speed accident on 15 May 2011 during the Superbike qualifying race at the Clark International Speedway Racing Circuit. While passing a semi-straight right hand sweeper on the speedway, Buncio's Suzuki GSX-R 600 motorbike slid and crashed into the run-off section. He was thrown off his bike and landed on an unfinished barrier in the race track. Buncio crashed onto a protruding steel rod of the barrier, which punctured his internal organs, fatally damaging his kidney and liver. Buncio was thrown off some 100 meters from his bike and was impaled on a protruding reed bar in an unfinished barrier on the Clark Speedway Circuit. He was rushed to a nearby hospital in Mabalacat and transferred to the UST Hospital in the wee hours of 15 May and was pronounced dead at 3:57 PM on the same day due to massive internal bleeding. The father of the late superbike champion Maico Buncio raised questions over the first aid procedure done on the rider during his fatal crash at the Clark Speedway Circuit. He said that the Aeromed's medical response team pulled the victim's body from the steel bar. This, he said, might have caused his son's death. The bar punctured his body and damaged his kidney and liver. Instead of cutting the steel bar to free Maico, the AeroMed emergency staffers decided to pull the young motorcycle champion free from his entanglement. This, they learned later, caused massive internal damage to Maico's organs and prompted him to scream in pain. Dr. Reynante Mirano, chief of St. Luke‚Äôs Hospital Emergency Medicine, said that instead of pulling Buncio‚Äôs body from the protruding metal, the medics should have cut the steel bar. Maico Buncio left a memorable quote to his fellow riders \\"Never stop riding, because I didn't.\\" Buncio's wake was held in the Loyola Memorial Chapels in Makati City and he was laid to rest in the Loyola Memorial Park in Marikina City on 21 May 2011. A motorcade organized by his fellow riders marked his funeral procession.

Biography =1979‚Äì1983= Bianchi was inspired by the music of Tangerine Dream, Conrad Schnitzler and Throbbing Gristle. He wrote about music for Italian magazinesInterview in Flowmotion issue 4, October 1982 before beginning to release his own cassettes under the name of Sacher-Pelz in August 1979.Kraus, Stephan. Maurizio Bianchi: A neurotronic ABYSS OF SOUND within meningitic twilights. Axis Archives, 1999. He released four cassettes as Sacher-Pelz before switching to his own name or simply \\"MB\\" in 1980. Bianchi corresponded with many of the key players in the industrial music and noise music scenes including Merzbow, GX Jupitter-Larsen, SPK, Nigel Ayers of Nocturnal Emissions and William Bennett of Whitehouse. After this exchange of letters and music, his first LPs were released in 1981. Symphony For A Genocide was released on Nigel Ayers' Sterile Records label after Bianchi had sent Ayers the money to press it. Each track on the LP was named after a Nazi extermination camp. The cover featured photographs of the Auschwitz Orchestra, a group of concentration camp prisoners who were forced to play classical music as people were herded into the gas chambers. The back cover included the text \\"The moral of this work: the past punishment is the inevitable blindness of the present\\". Also in 1981, William Bennett, head of the band Whitehouse and the British Come Org. label, offered Bianchi a record contract, which Bianchi signed unchecked. It was based on a \\"joke contract\\" that Steven Stapleton of Nurse With Wound had sketched. The contract assumed all rights to Bianchi's work. After delivery of the tapes Bennett edited-in speeches by Nazi leaders, and instead of the relatively unsensational name MB, it was published under the alias Leibstandarte SS MB, named after the SS unit that worked as bodyguards to Adolf Hitler. By 1983 and the release of the Plain Truth LP on U.K. power electronics label Broken Flag, Bianchi had become a Jehovah's Witness.Underwood, Steve. The Broken Flag Story in As Loud As Possible issue 1, p90, 2010 At the end of 1983 Bianchi announced his withdrawal from music, stating \\"The end is very near, and we have a very short time to recognise our mistakes and to redeem ourselves... I stopped doing music, and now my life is going towards its full awareness\\".from a letter to Subterranean Records (USA) quoted in Kraus, Stephan. Maurizio Bianchi: A neurotronic ABYSS OF SOUND within meningitic twilights. Axis Archives, 1999. =1998‚Äì2009= In 1998, encouraged by Alga Marghen label head Emanuele Carcano, who offered him a label of his own, Maurizio Bianchi resumed making music. The label was EEs'T Records, through which he released new editions of old MB albums and many new recordings. Bianchi then proceeded to work on over a hundred new projects both solo or in collaboration with other Italian and international artists including Atrax Morgue, Aube, Francisco L√≥pez, Mauthausen Orchestra, Merzbow, Ryan Martin and Philip Julian/Cheapmachines. Bianchi has worked with record labels including Dais Records, the Carrboro, North Carolina based Hot Releases and the Italian Menstrual Recordings to re-release some of his out-of-print material. On August 19, 2009, for unspecified personal reasons, Maurizio Bianchi decided again to completely stop making music. This decision was soon after reversed; Maurizio Bianchi continued to release new music. Sample In 2005, a 2-CD-Set named Blut und Nebel was released, consisting of a remix of his first ten LPs.

A fadeaway or fall-away in basketball is a jump shot taken while jumping backwards, away from the basket. The goal is to create space between the shooter and the defender, making the shot much harder to block. The shooter must have very good accuracy (much higher than when releasing a regular jump shot) and must use more strength (to counteract the backwards momentum) in a relatively short amount of time. Also, because the movement is away from the basket, the shooter has less chance to grab his own rebound. Because the shooting percentage is lower in fadeaway (because of the difficulty of the shot) and because it's harder for the shooter to get his own rebound, many coaches and players believe it is one of the worst shots in the game to take. However, once mastered, it is one of the hardest methods of shooting for defenders to block. The threat of a fadeaway forces a defender to jump into the shooter, and with a pump fake, the shooter can easily get a foul on the defender. Only a handful of great NBA players have been successful shooting fadeaways. Michael Jordan was one of the most popular shooters of the fadeaway. Wilt Chamberlain, Patrick Ewing, LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Hakeem Olajuwon, Dwyane Wade, Karl Malone, Larry Bird, Carmelo Anthony, DeMar DeRozan, and LaMarcus Aldridge are also well known for using this move. The even more difficult one-legged fadeaway has become Dirk Nowitzki's signature move and has been called by LeBron James the second most unstoppable move ever, only behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's skyhook.

It is of special interest in decision theory, and for the Bayesian interpretation of probability theory. Historically, it arose as a variant of the necktie paradox. The problem typically is introduced by formulating a hypothetical challenge of the following type: It seems obvious that there is no point in switching envelopes as the situation is symmetric. However, because you stand to gain twice as much money if you switch while risking only a loss of half of what you currently have, it is possible to argue that it is more beneficial to switch.See the problem statement for a more precise statement of this argument. Introduction =Problem= Basic setup: You are given two indistinguishable envelopes, each of which contains a positive sum of money. One envelope contains twice as much as the other. You may pick one envelope and keep whatever amount it contains. You pick one envelope at random but before you open it you are given the chance to take the other envelope instead. The switching argument: Now suppose you reason as follows: The puzzle: The puzzle is to find the flaw in the very compelling line of reasoning above. This includes determining exactly why and under what conditions that step is not correct, in order to be sure not to make this mistake in a more complicated situation where the misstep may not be so obvious. In short, the problem is to solve the paradox. Thus, in particular, the puzzle is not solved by the very simple task of finding another way to calculate the probabilities that does not lead to a contradiction. Many proposed solutions Many solutions have been proposed. Some simple, some very complex. Commonly one writer proposes a solution to the problem as stated, after which another writer shows that altering the problem slightly revives the paradox. Such sequences of discussions have produced a family of closely related formulations of the problem, resulting in a voluminous literature on the subject.A complete list of published and unpublished sources in chronological order can be found in the talk page. To keep this article short, only a small fraction of all proposed ideas for a solution are mentioned below. No proposed solution is widely accepted as definitive. Despite this it is common for authors to claim that the solution to the problem is easy, even elementary. However, when investigating these elementary solutions they often differ from one author to the next.  Simple resolution  The total amount in both envelopes is a constant c = 3x, with x in one envelope and 2x in the other. If you select the envelope with x first you gain the amount x by swapping. If you select the envelope with 2x first you lose the amount x by swapping. So you gain on average G = {1 \\\\over 2} (x) + {1 \\\\over 2} (-x) = {1 \\\\over 2}(x - x) = 0 by swapping. Swapping is not better than keeping. The expected value \\\\operatorname{E} = \\\\frac 1 2 2x + \\\\frac 1 2 x = \\\\frac 3 2 x is the same for both the envelopes. Thus no contradiction exists. The famous mystification is evoked by the mixing up of two different circumstances and situations, giving wrong results. The so-called \\"paradox\\" presents two already appointed and already locked envelopes, where one envelope is already locked with twice the amount of the other already locked envelope. Whereas step 6 boldly claims \\"Thus the other envelope contains 2A with probability 1/2 and A/2 with probability 1/2.\\", in the given situation, that claim can never be applicable to any A nor to any average A. This claim is never correct for the situation presented, this claim applies to the Nalebuff asymmetric variant only (see below). In the situation presented, the other envelope cannot generally contain 2A, but can contain 2A only in the very specific instance where envelope A, by chance, actually contains the smaller amount of \\\\frac{\\\\text{Total}}{3}, but nowhere else. The other envelope cannot generally contain A/2, but can contain A/2 only in the very specific instance where envelope A, by chance, actually contains 2\\\\frac{\\\\text{Total}}{3}, but nowhere else. The difference between the two already appointed and locked envelopes is always \\\\frac{\\\\text{Total}}{3}. No \\"average amount A\\" can ever form any initial basis for any expected value, as this does not get to the heart of the problem.  Other simple resolutions  A common way to resolve the paradox, both in popular literature and part of the academic literature, especially in philosophy, is to assume that the 'A' in step 7 is intended to be the expected value in envelope A and that we intended to write down a formula for the expected value in envelope B. Step 7 states that the expected value in B = 1/2( 2A + A/2 ) It is pointed out that the 'A' in the first part of the formula is the expected value, given that envelope A contains less than envelope B, but the 'A', in the second part of the formula is the expected value in A, given that envelope A contains more than envelope B. The flaw in the argument is that same symbol is used with two different meanings in both parts of the same calculation but is assumed to have the same value in both cases. A correct calculation would be: :Expected value in B = 1/2 ( (Expected value in B, given A is larger than B) + (Expected value in B, given A is smaller than B) ) If we then take the sum in one envelope to be x and the sum in the other to be 2x the expected value calculations becomes: :Expected value in B = 1/2 (x + 2x) which is equal to the expected sum in A. In non-technical language, what goes wrong (see Necktie paradox) is that, in the scenario provided, the mathematics use relative values of A and B (that is, it assumes that one would gain more money if A is less than B than one would lose if the opposite were true). However, the two values of money are fixed (one envelope contains, say, $20 and the other $40). If the values of the envelopes are restated as x and 2x, it's much easier to see that, if A were greater, one would lose x by switching and, if B were greater, one would gain x by switching. One does not actually gain a greater amount of money by switching because the total T of A and B (3x) remains the same, and the difference x is fixed to T/3. Line 7 should have been worked out more carefully as follows: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{E}(B) &= \\\\operatorname{E}(B\\\\mid A < B) P(A < B) + \\\\operatorname{E}(B\\\\mid A > B) P(A > B) \\\\ &= \\\\operatorname{E}(2A\\\\mid A < B) \\\\frac 1 2 + \\\\operatorname{E}\\\\left(\\\\frac 1 2 A \\\\mid A > B\\\\right) \\\\frac 1 2 \\\\ &= \\\\operatorname{E}(A \\\\mid A < B) + \\\\frac 1 4 \\\\operatorname{E}(A \\\\mid A >B) \\\\end{align} A will be larger when A is larger than B, than when it is smaller than B. So its average values (expectation values) in those two cases are different. And the average value of A is not the same as A itself, anyway. Two mistakes are being made: the writer forgot he was taking expectation values, and he forgot he was taking expectation values under two different conditions. It would have been easier to compute E(B) directly. Denoting the lower of the two amounts by x, and taking it to be fixed (even if unknown) we find that :\\\\operatorname{E}(B) = \\\\frac 1 2 2x + \\\\frac 1 2 x = \\\\frac 3 2 x We learn that 1.5x is the expected value of the amount in Envelope B. By the same calculation it is also the expected value of the amount in Envelope A. They are the same hence there is no reason to prefer one envelope to the other. This conclusion was, of course, obvious in advance; the point is that we identified the false step in the argument for switching by explaining exactly where the calculation being made there went off the rails. We could also continue from the correct but difficult to interpret result of the development in line 7: :\\\\operatorname{E}(B) = \\\\operatorname{E}(A\\\\mid A < B) + \\\\frac 1 4 \\\\operatorname{E}(A \\\\mid A >B) = x + \\\\frac 1 4 2x = \\\\frac 3 2 x so (of course) different routes to calculate the same thing all give the same answer. Tsikogiannopoulos presented a different way to do these calculations. It is by definition correct to assign equal probabilities to the events that the other envelope contains double or half that amount in envelope A. So the \\"switching argument\\" is correct up to step 6. Given that the player's envelope contains the amount A, he differentiates the actual situation in two different games: The first game would be played with the amounts (A, 2A) and the second game with the amounts (A/2, A). Only one of them is actually played but we don't know which one. These two games need to be treated differently. If the player wants to compute his/her expected return (profit or loss) in case of exchange, he/she should weigh the return derived from each game by the average amount in the two envelopes in that particular game. In the first case the profit would be A with an average amount of 3A/2, whereas in the second case the loss would be A/2 with an average amount of 3A/4. So the formula of the expected return in case of exchange, seen as a proportion of the total amount in the two envelopes, is: ::E=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{+A}{3A/2}+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{-A/2}{3A/4}=0 This result means yet again that the player has to expect neither profit nor loss by exchanging his/her envelope. We could actually open our envelope before deciding on switching or not and the above formula would still give us the correct expected return. For example, if we opened our envelope and saw that it contained 100 euros then we would set A=100 in the above formula and the expected return in case of switching would be: ::E=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{+100}{150}+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{-50}{75}=0 = Nalebuff asymmetric variant = The mechanism by which the amounts of the two envelopes are determined is crucial for the decision of the player to switch or not his/her envelope. Suppose that the amounts in the two envelopes A and B were not determined by first fixing contents of two envelopes E1 and E2, and then naming them A and B at random (for instance, by the toss of a fair coin). Instead, we start right at the beginning by putting some amount in Envelope A, and then fill B in a way which depends both on chance (the toss of a coin) and on what we put in A. Suppose that first of all the amount a in Envelope A is fixed in some way or other, and then the amount in Envelope B is fixed, dependent on what is already in A, according to the outcome of a fair coin. Œôf the coin fell Heads then 2a is put in Envelope B, if the coin fell Tails then a/2 is put in Envelope B. If the player was aware of this mechanism, and knows that they hold Envelope A, but don't know the outcome of the coin toss, and doesn't know a, then the switching argument is correct and he/she is recommended to switch envelopes. This version of the problem was introduced by Nalebuff (1988) and is often called the Ali-Baba problem. Notice that there is no need to look in Envelope A in order to decide whether or not to switch. Many more variants of the problem have been introduced. Nickerson and Falk systematically survey a total of 8.  Bayesian resolutions  The simple resolution above assumed that the person who invented the argument for switching was trying to calculate the expectation value of the amount in Envelope A, thinking of the two amounts in the envelopes as fixed (x and 2x). The only uncertainty is which envelope has the smaller amount x. However, many mathematicians and statisticians interpret the argument as an attempt to calculate the expected amount in Envelope B, given a real or hypothetical amount \\"A\\" in Envelope A. (A mathematician would moreover prefer to use the symbol a to stand for a possible value, reserving the symbol A for a random variable). One does not need to look in the envelope to see how much is in there, in order to do the calculation. If the result of the calculation is an advice to switch envelopes, whatever amount might be in there, then it would appear that one should switch anyway, without looking. In this case, at Steps 6, 7 and 8 of the reasoning, \\"A\\" is any fixed possible value of the amount of money in the first envelope. This interpretation of the two envelopes problem appears in the first publications in which the paradox was introduced in its present-day form, Gardner (1989) and Nalebuff (1989). It is common in the more mathematical literature on the problem. It also applies to the modification of the problem (which seems to have started with Nalebuff) in which the owner of Envelope A does actually look in his envelope before deciding whether or not to switch; though Nalebuff does also emphasize that there is no need to have the owner of Envelope A look in his envelope. If he imagines looking in it, and if for any amount which he can imagine being in there, he has an argument to switch, then he will decide to switch anyway. Finally, this interpretation was also the core of earlier versions of the two envelopes problem (Littlewood's, Schr√∂dinger's, and Kraitchik's switching paradoxes); see the concluding section, on history of TEP. This kind of interpretation is often called \\"Bayesian\\" because it assumes the writer is also incorporating a prior probability distribution of possible amounts of money in the two envelopes in the switching argument. = Simple form of Bayesian resolution = The simple resolution depended on a particular interpretation of what the writer of the argument is trying to calculate: namely, it assumed he was after the (unconditional) expectation value of what's in Envelope B. In the mathematical literature on Two Envelopes Problem a different interpretation is more common, involving the conditional expectation value (conditional on what might be in Envelope A). To solve this and related interpretations or versions of the problem, most authors use the Bayesian interpretation of probability, which means that probability reasoning is not only applied to truly random events like the random pick of an envelope, but also to our knowledge (or lack of knowledge) about things which are fixed but unknown, like the two amounts originally placed in the two envelopes, before one is picked at random and called \\"Envelope A\\". Moreover, according to a long tradition going back at least to Laplace and his principle of insufficient reason one is supposed to assign equal probabilities when one has no knowledge at all concerning the possible values of some quantity. Thus the fact that we are not told anything about how the envelopes are filled can already be converted into probability statements about these amounts. No information means that probabilities are equal. In steps 6 and 7 of the switching argument, the writer imagines that that Envelope A contains a certain amount a, and then seems to believe that given that information, the other envelope would be equally likely to contain twice or half that amount. That assumption can only be correct, if prior to knowing what was in Envelope A, the writer would have considered the following two pairs of values for both envelopes equally likely: the amounts a/2 and a; and the amounts a and 2a. (This follows from Bayes' rule in odds form: posterior odds equal prior odds times likelihood ratio). But now we can apply the same reasoning, imagining not a but a/2 in Envelope A. And similarly, for 2a. And similarly, ad infinitum, repeatedly halving or repeatedly doubling as many times as you like. Suppose for the sake of argument, we start by imagining an amount 32 in Envelope A. In order that the reasoning in steps 6 and 7 is correct whatever amount happened to be in Envelope A, we apparently believe in advance that all the following ten amounts are all equally likely to be the smaller of the two amounts in the two envelopes: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 (equally likely powers of 2). But going to even larger or even smaller amounts, the \\"equally likely\\" assumption starts to appear a bit unreasonable. Suppose we stop, just with these ten equally likely possibilities for the smaller amount in the two envelopes. In that case, the reasoning in steps 6 and 7 was entirely correct if envelope A happened to contain any of the amounts 2, 4, ... 512: switching envelopes would give an expected (average) gain of 25%. If envelope A happened to contain the amount 1, then the expected gain is actually 100%. But if it happened to contain the amount 1024, a massive loss of 50% (of a rather large amount) would have been incurred. That only happens once in twenty times, but it is exactly enough to balance the expected gains in the other 19 out of 20 times. Alternatively we do go on ad infinitum but now we are working with a quite ludicrous assumption, implying for instance, that it is infinitely more likely for the amount in envelope A to be smaller than 1, and infinitely more likely to be larger than 1024, than between those two values. This is a so-called improper prior distribution: probability calculus breaks down; expectation values are not even defined. Many authors have also pointed out that if a maximum sum that can be put in the envelope with the smaller amount exists, then it is very easy to see that Step 6 breaks down, since if the player holds more than the maximum sum that can be put into the \\"smaller\\" envelope they must hold the envelope containing the larger sum, and are thus certain to lose by switching. This may not occur often, but when it does, the heavy loss the player incurs means that, on average, there is no advantage in switching. Some writers consider that this resolves all practical cases of the problem.. But the problem can also be resolved mathematically without assuming a maximum amount. Nalebuff, Christensen and Utts, Falk and Konold, Blachman, Christensen and Utts, Nickerson and Falk, pointed out that if the amounts of money in the two envelopes have any proper probability distribution representing the player's prior beliefs about the amounts of money in the two envelopes, then it is impossible that whatever the amount A=a in the first envelope might be, it would be equally likely, according to these prior beliefs, that the second contains a/2 or 2a. Thus step 6 of the argument, which leads to always switching, is a non-sequitur, also when there is no maximum to the amounts in the envelopes. =Introduction to further developments in connection with Bayesian probability theory= The first two resolutions discussed above (the \\"simple resolution\\" and the \\"Bayesian resolution\\") correspond to two possible interpretations of what is going on in step 6 of the argument. They both assume that step 6 indeed is \\"the bad step\\". But the description in step 6 is ambiguous. Is the author after the unconditional (overall) expectation value of what is in envelope B (perhaps - conditional on the smaller amount, x), or is he after the conditional expectation of what is in envelope B, given any possible amount a which might be in envelope A? Thus, there are two main interpretations of the intention of the composer of the paradoxical argument for switching, and two main resolutions. A large literature has developed concerning variants of the problem... The standard assumption about the way the envelopes are set up is that a sum of money is in one envelope, and twice that sum is in another envelope. One of the two envelopes is randomly given to the player (envelope A). The originally proposed problem does not make clear exactly how the smaller of the two sums is determined, what values it could possibly take and, in particular, whether there is a minimum or a maximum sum it might contain... However, if we are using the Bayesian interpretation of probability, then we start by expressing our prior beliefs as to the smaller amount in the two envelopes through a probability distribution. Lack of knowledge can also be expressed in terms of probability. A first variant within the Bayesian version is to come up with a proper prior probability distribution of the smaller amount of money in the two envelopes, such that when Step 6 is performed properly, the advice is still to prefer Envelope B, whatever might be in Envelope A. So though the specific calculation performed in step 6 was incorrect (there is no proper prior distribution such that, given what is in the first envelope A, the other envelope is always equally likely to be larger or smaller) a correct calculation, depending on what prior we are using, does lead to the result E(B  A = a) > a for all possible values of a.. In these cases it can be shown that the expected sum in both envelopes is infinite. There is no gain, on average, in swapping. = Second mathematical variant = Though Bayesian probability theory can resolve the first mathematical interpretation of the paradox above, it turns out that examples can be found of proper probability distributions, such that the expected value of the amount in the second envelope given that in the first does exceed the amount in the first, whatever it might be. The first such example was already given by Nalebuff. See also Christensen and Utts (1992)..... Denote again the amount of money in the first envelope by A and that in the second by B. We think of these as random. Let X be the smaller of the two amounts and Y=2X be the larger. Notice that once we have fixed a probability distribution for X then the joint probability distribution of A,B is fixed, since A,B = X,Y or Y,X each with probability 1/2, independently of X,Y. The bad step 6 in the \\"always switching\\" argument led us to the finding E(BA=a)>a for all a, and hence to the recommendation to switch, whether or not we know a. Now, it turns out that one can quite easily invent proper probability distributions for X, the smaller of the two amounts of money, such that this bad conclusion is still true. One example is analysed in more detail, in a moment. As mentioned before, it cannot be true that whatever a, given A=a, B is equally likely to be a/2 or 2a, but it can be true that whatever a, given A=a, B is larger in expected value than a. Suppose for example that the envelope with the smaller amount actually contains 2n dollars with probability 2n/3n+1 where n = 0, 1, 2,‚Ä¶ These probabilities sum to 1, hence the distribution is a proper prior (for subjectivists) and a completely decent probability law also for frequentists. A famous example of a proper probability distribution of the amounts of money in the two envelopes, for which E(BA=a)>a for all a. Imagine what might be in the first envelope. A sensible strategy would certainly be to swap when the first envelope contains 1, as the other must then contain 2. Suppose on the other hand the first envelope contains 2. In that case there are two possibilities: the envelope pair in front of us is either {1, 2} or {2, 4}. All other pairs are impossible. The conditional probability that we are dealing with the {1, 2} pair, given that the first envelope contains 2, is :\\\\begin{align} P({1,2} \\\\mid 2) &= \\\\frac{P({1,2})/2}{P({1,2})/2+P({2,4})/2} \\\\ &= \\\\frac{P({1,2})}{P({1,2})+P({2,4})} \\\\ &= \\\\frac{1/3}{1/3 + 2/9} = 3/5, \\\\end{align} and consequently the probability it's the {2, 4} pair is 2/5, since these are the only two possibilities. In this derivation, P({1,2})/2 is the probability that the envelope pair is the pair 1 and 2, and Envelope A happens to contain 2; P({2,4})/2 is the probability that the envelope pair is the pair 2 and 4, and (again) Envelope A happens to contain 2. Those are the only two ways that Envelope A can end up containing the amount 2. It turns out that these proportions hold in general unless the first envelope contains 1. Denote by a the amount we imagine finding in Envelope A, if we were to open that envelope, and suppose that a = 2n for some n ‚â• 1. In that case the other envelope contains a/2 with probability 3/5 and 2a with probability 2/5. So either the first envelope contains 1, in which case the conditional expected amount in the other envelope is 2, or the first envelope contains a > 1, and though the second envelope is more likely to be smaller than larger, its conditionally expected amount is larger: the conditionally expected amount in Envelope B is :\\\\frac{3}{5} \\\\frac{a}{2} + \\\\frac{2}{5} 2a = \\\\frac{11}{10}a which is more than a. This means that the player who looks in Envelope A would decide to switch whatever he saw there. Hence there is no need to look in Envelope A to make that decision. This conclusion is just as clearly wrong as it was in the preceding interpretations of the Two Envelopes Problem. But now the flaws noted above do not apply; the a in the expected value calculation is a constant and the conditional probabilities in the formula are obtained from a specified and proper prior distribution. =Proposed resolutions through mathematical economics= Most writers think that the new paradox can be defused, although the resolution requires concepts from mathematical economics. Comment on Christensen and Utts (1992) Suppose E(BA=a)>a for all a. It can be shown that this is possible for some probability distributions of X (the smaller amount of money in the two envelopes) only if E(X)=\\\\infty. That is, only if the mean of all possible values of money in the envelopes is infinite. To see why, compare the series described above in which the probability of each X is 2/3 as likely as the previous X with one in which the probability of each X is only 1/3 as likely as the previous X. When the probability of each subsequent term is greater than one-half of the probability of the term before it (and each X is twice that of the X before it) the mean is infinite, but when the probability factor is less than one- half, the mean converges. In the cases where the probability factor is less than one-half, E(BA=a) for all a other than the first, smallest a, and the total expected value of switching converges to 0. In addition, if an ongoing distribution with a probability factor greater than one-half is made finite by, after any number of terms, establishing a final term with \\"all the remaining probability,\\" that is, 1 minus the probability of all previous terms, the expected value of switching with respect to the probability that A is equal to the last, largest a will exactly negate the sum of the positive expected values that came before, and again the total expected value of switching drops to 0 (this is the general case of setting out an equal probability of a finite set of values in the envelopes described above). Thus, the only distributions that seem to point to a positive expected value for switching are those in which E(X)=\\\\infty. Averaging over a, it follows that E(B)=E(A)=\\\\infty (because A and B have identical probability distributions, by symmetry, and both A and B are greater than or equal to X). If we don't look into the first envelope, then clearly there is no reason to switch, since we would be exchanging one unknown amount of money (A), whose expected value is infinite, for another unknown amount of money (B), with the same probability distribution and infinite expected value. However, if we do look into the first envelope, then for all values observed (A=a) we would want to switch because E(BA=a)>a for all a. As noted by David Chalmers, this problem can be described as a failure of dominance reasoning. Under dominance reasoning, the fact that we strictly prefer A to B for all possible observed values a should imply that we strictly prefer A to B without observing a; however, as already shown, that is not true because E(B)=E(A)=\\\\infty. To salvage dominance reasoning while allowing E(B)=E(A)=\\\\infty, one would have to replace expected value as the decision criterion, thereby employing a more sophisticated argument from mathematical economics. For example, we could assume the decision maker is an expected utility maximizer with initial wealth W whose utility function, u(w), is chosen to satisfy E(u(W+B)A=a) for at least some values of a (that is, holding onto A=a is strictly preferred to switching to B for some a). Although this is not true for all utility functions, it would be true if u(w) had an upper bound, \\\\beta<\\\\infty, as w increased toward infinity (a common assumption in mathematical economics and decision theory). Michael R. Powers provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the utility function to resolve the paradox, and notes that neither u(w)<\\\\beta nor E(u(W+A))=E(u(W+B))<\\\\infty is required. Some writers would prefer to argue that in a real-life situation, u(W+A) and u(W+B) are bounded simply because the amount of money in an envelope is bounded by the total amount of money in the world (M), implying u(W+A) \\\\leq u(W+M) and u(W+B) \\\\leq u(W+M). From this perspective, the second paradox is resolved because the postulated probability distribution for X (with E(X)=\\\\infty) cannot arise in a real-life situation. Similar arguments are often used to resolve the St. Petersburg paradox. = Controversy among philosophers = As mentioned above, any distribution producing this variant of the paradox must have an infinite mean. So before the player opens an envelope the expected gain from switching is \\"‚àû ‚àí ‚àû\\", which is not defined. In the words of David Chalmers, this is \\"just another example of a familiar phenomenon, the strange behaviour of infinity\\". Chalmers suggests that decision theory generally breaks down when confronted with games having a diverging expectation, and compares it with the situation generated by the classical St. Petersburg paradox. However, Clark and Shackel argue that this blaming it all on \\"the strange behaviour of infinity\\" does not resolve the paradox at all; neither in the single case nor the averaged case. They provide a simple example of a pair of random variables both having infinite mean but where it is clearly sensible to prefer one to the other, both conditionally and on average. They argue that decision theory should be extended so as to allow infinite expectation values in some situations. Smullyan's non-probabilistic variant The logician Raymond Smullyan questioned if the paradox has anything to do with probabilities at all. He did this by expressing the problem in a way that does not involve probabilities. The following plainly logical arguments lead to conflicting conclusions: #Let the amount in the envelope chosen by the player be A. By swapping, the player may gain A or lose A/2. So the potential gain is strictly greater than the potential loss. #Let the amounts in the envelopes be X and 2X. Now by swapping, the player may gain X or lose X. So the potential gain is equal to the potential loss. =Proposed resolutions= A number of solutions have been put forward. Careful analyses have been made by some logicians. Though solutions differ, they all pinpoint semantic issues concerned with counterfactual reasoning. We want to compare the amount that we would gain by switching if we would gain by switching, with the amount we would lose by switching if we would indeed lose by switching. However, we cannot both gain and lose by switching at the same time. We are asked to compare two incompatible situations. Only one of them can factually occur, the other is a counterfactual situation‚Äîsomehow imaginary. To compare them at all, we must somehow \\"align\\" the two situations, providing some definite points in common. James Chase argues that the second argument is correct because it does correspond to the way to align two situations (one in which we gain, the other in which we lose), which is preferably indicated by the problem description. Also Bernard Katz and Doris Olin argue this point of view. In the second argument, we consider the amounts of money in the two envelopes as being fixed; what varies is which one is first given to the player. Because that was an arbitrary and physical choice, the counterfactual world in which the player, counterfactually, got the other envelope to the one he was actually (factually) given is a highly meaningful counterfactual world and hence the comparison between gains and losses in the two worlds is meaningful. This comparison is uniquely indicated by the problem description, in which two amounts of money are put in the two envelopes first, and only after that is one chosen arbitrarily and given to the player. In the first argument, however, we consider the amount of money in the envelope first given to the player as fixed and consider the situations where the second envelope contains either half or twice that amount. This would only be a reasonable counterfactual world if in reality the envelopes had been filled as follows: first, some amount of money is placed in the specific envelope that will be given to the player; and secondly, by some arbitrary process, the other envelope is filled (arbitrarily or randomly) either with double or with half of that amount of money. Byeong-Uk Yi, on the other hand, argues that comparing the amount you would gain if you would gain by switching with the amount you would lose if you would lose by switching is a meaningless exercise from the outset. According to his analysis, all three implications (switch, indifferent, do not switch) are incorrect. He analyses Smullyan's arguments in detail, showing that intermediate steps are being taken, and pinpointing exactly where an incorrect inference is made according to his formalization of counterfactual inference. An important difference with Chase's analysis is that he does not take account of the part of the story where we are told that the envelope called Envelope A is decided completely at random. Thus, Chase puts probability back into the problem description in order to conclude that arguments 1 and 3 are incorrect, argument 2 is correct, while Yi keeps \\"two envelope problem without probability\\" completely free of probability, and comes to the conclusion that there are no reasons to prefer any action. This corresponds to the view of Albers et al., that without probability ingredient, there is no way to argue that one action is better than another, anyway. Bliss argues that the source of the paradox is that when one mistakenly believes in the possibility of a larger payoff that does not, in actuality, exist, one is mistaken by a larger margin than when one believes in the possibility of a smaller payoff that does not actually exist. If, for example, the envelopes contained $5.00 and $10.00 respectively, a player who opened the $10.00 envelope would expect the possibility of a $20.00 payout that simply does not exist. Were that player to open the $5.00 envelope instead, he would believe in the possibility of a $2.50 payout, which constitutes a smaller deviation from the true value; this results in the paradoxical discrepancy. Albers, Kooi, and Schaafsma consider that without adding probability (or other) ingredients to the problem, Smullyan's arguments do not give any reason to swap or not to swap, in any case. Thus, there is no paradox. This dismissive attitude is common among writers from probability and economics: Smullyan's paradox arises precisely because he takes no account whatever of probability or utility. Conditional switching As an extension to the problem, consider the case where the player is allowed to look in Envelope A before deciding whether to switch. In this \\"conditional switching\\" problem, it is often possible to generate a gain over the \\"never switching\\" strategy\\", depending on the probability distribution of the envelopes.  History of the paradox  The envelope paradox dates back at least to 1953, when Belgian mathematician Maurice Kraitchik proposed a puzzle in his book Recreational Mathematics concerning two equally rich men who meet and compare their beautiful neckties, presents from their wives, wondering which tie actually cost more money. He also introduces a variant in which the two men compare the contents of their purses. He assumes that each purse is equally likely to contain 1 up to some large number x of pennies, the total number of pennies minted to date. The men do not look in their purses but each reasons that they should switch. He does not explain what is the error in their reasoning. It is not clear whether the puzzle already appeared in an earlier 1942 edition of his book. It is also mentioned in a 1953 book on elementary mathematics and mathematical puzzles by the mathematician John Edensor Littlewood, who credited it to the physicist Erwin Schroedinger, where it concerns a pack of cards, each card has two numbers written on it, the player gets to see a random side of a random card, and the question is whether one should turn over the card. Littlewood's pack of cards is infinitely large and his paradox is a paradox of improper prior distributions. Martin Gardner popularized Kraitchik's puzzle in his 1982 book Aha! Gotcha, in the form of a wallet game: Gardner confessed that though, like Kraitchik, he could give a sound analysis leading to the right answer (there is no point in switching), he could not clearly put his finger on what was wrong with the reasoning for switching, and Kraitchik did not give any help in this direction, either. In 1988 and 1989, Barry Nalebuff presented two different two-envelope problems, each with one envelope containing twice what is in the other, and each with computation of the expectation value 5A/4. The first paper just presents the two problems. The second discusses many solutions to both of them. The second of his two problems is nowadays the more common, and is presented in this article. According to this version, the two envelopes are filled first, then one is chosen at random and called Envelope A. Martin Gardner independently mentioned this same version in his 1989 book Penrose Tiles to Trapdoor Ciphers and the Return of Dr Matrix. Barry Nalebuff's asymmetric variant, often known as the Ali Baba problem, has one envelope filled first, called Envelope A, and given to Ali. Then a fair coin is tossed to decide whether Envelope B should contain half or twice that amount, and only then given to Baba. Broome in 1995 called the probability distribution 'paradoxical' if for any given first-envelope amount x, the expectation of the other envelope conditional on x is greater than x. The literature contains dozens of commentaries on the problem, much of which observes that a distribution of finite values can have an infinite expected value.

It was originally played during the off-season, but now it is played during the wrap-around season's December break. The event began in 1989, and is hosted by legendary golfer Greg Norman. The tournament was named the Shark Shootout from 1991 to 2010, after the player's nickname. The first eleven editions of the tournament were played at Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks, California (1989‚Äì99). It was then played for one year at Doral Resort & Spa, on the Norman designed Great White Course, before moving to Tibur√≥n Golf Club in Naples, Florida in 2001, where it is played over the Norman designed Gold Course. Format The Shootout is a 3-day, 54-hole stroke play event in which teams of two compete. The format since 2014 has been: * First round ‚Äì scramble ‚Äì also known as ambrose or best-shot; each player in a team tees off on each hole, and the players decide which shot was best. Every player then plays their second shot from within a clublength of where the best shot has come to rest (and no closer to the hole), and the procedure is repeated until the hole is finished. * Second round ‚Äì greensomes (i.e. modified alternate shot) ‚Äì also known as Scotch Foursomes, follows the same format as foursomes (teams use only one ball per team, taking alternate shots until the hole is completed) except that both players tee off on every hole. The better ball is chosen and alternate strokes are then played to complete the hole. * Final round ‚Äì better ball (i.e. fourball) ‚Äì Each golfer plays their own ball from where it lies throughout the round. A team's number of strokes for a given hole is that of the lower scoring team member. It is also known as best ball or, more properly, better ball. Broadcasting history The event was originally broadcast in the United States by the USA Network and CBS, with USA broadcasting the first round on a tape-delayed basis, and CBS handling the second round live. Not all the country saw the final round live, as CBS's commitment to the NFL only allows part of the country to see the round as it takes place, with the rest of the U.S. seeing the event beginning at 4 p.m. Eastern Time. In 2007, the event was moved to December, and was broadcast live by both Golf Channel and NBC. It remained on these networks through 2013. In 2014, weekend coverage moved to Fox, for which host Norman is an analyst. The telecast served as a prelude to Fox's coverage of the 2015 U.S. Open. In 2017, weekend coverage returned to NBC.

It is a sequel to Singleton's 1984 seminal The Lords of Midnight and has similar game mechanics but adds more detail and complexity with the number of characters and locations increased. In Doomdark's Revenge, the hero of the first game, Luxor the Moonprince, goes into the savage wastes of Icemark to save his son Morkin and defeat the evil Empress Shareth, daughter of his enemy Doomdark. Despite what the title suggests, Doomdark himself, who was killed in the first game, does not actually return in the sequel. Like its predecessor, Doomdark's Revenge was a major critical success and a commercial hit. It was supposed to be followed the sequel titled Eye of the Moon in 1989, which was never finished. Another sequel, Lords of Midnight: The Citadel, was eventually released in 1995. Gameplay Luxor's Moonring allows the player to view the world through the eyes of any character that is already in alliance or who has been recruited to Luxor's cause and, in each game day, the player may select characters in turn and move them around the Icemark, seeking objects, allies or enemies. The game has five factions to be recruited or fought: the Fey, Barbarians, Dwarfs, Giants, and Icelords. The main difference between Revenge and The Lords of Midnight is that the lords now all move and react independently, no longer content to sit in their castles and wait to be recruited. The enemy leader, Shareth, also moves around, attempting to recruit armies and lords to her cause, so a major part of the game involves recruiting sufficient forces to counter hers. This makes the relationship between lords very important, as some are vassals of others, and may only be recruited by their lieges. Recruiting a liege does not automatically recruit all his vassals, nor their respective vassals but it offers additional armed strength as well as access to the Lord's city or fortress. Lords may also cooperate, recruit and fight each other independently, making the world much more dynamic than the previous game. Hostile fortresses or cities may be sacked and taken ownership of, which become important sources of manpower as they slowly generate troops that can be used to replace those lost in battle elsewhere. The Icemark is a varied environment with forests, mountain ranges, plains and hills, all of which offer some resistance to the distance which may be travelled in each game 'day.' The land also features pits, palaces, huts, temples, gates and fountains which may contain creatures or magic that harms the player or provides respite and refreshment. These features may also provide access to the underground tunnel world beneath the Icemark which would otherwise inaccessible. Within the Icemark, there are many magic items to be found, most belonging to a single lord and having 'power in battle'. Also, there are useful objects in the form of magic crowns, which may aid in the task of recruiting Lords. Runes may provide protection or the ability to be swifter in travel; in some cases, these objects may summon enemies or allow travel to a particular location. Doomdark's Revenge reverses the first game's victory conditions by giving the computer only a single goal, the death of the main protagonist Luxor. The player has many possible levels of victory, ranging from the simple rescue of Luxor's son Morkin from Shareth's spell of enchantment and retreat to Midnight, to the complete destruction of Shareth and the safe return home of Luxor, Morkin, as well as Luxor's companions Rorthron and Tarithel. Plot After Doomdark the Witchking was destroyed in the first game, word reaches his daughter, Shareth the Heartstealer, the dreaded Empress of the Frozen Empire of Icemark who is as evil as she is beautiful and powerful. Enraged by the news, she decides to take revenge on the chief architect of her father's downfall, Luxor the Moonprince, by bewitching and kidnapping his son Morkin. The game revolves around Luxor and his companions Rorthron the Wise and Morkin's beloved Tarithel the Fey, and their attempts to rescue Morkin and defeat Shareth. Canonically, Tarithel found Morkin and broke Shareth's spell with a single kiss. Shareth's armies have been defeated and she herself has been slain in the great final battle. However, Shareth's and Morkin's union has created a son named Anderlane, who was later born from a surrogate mother. Release The game's publisher Beyond Software offered a prize‚Äîmodels of the major characters in an Icemark setting‚Äîto the first player who revealed the \\"Watchwords of Midnight\\", an inscription on Luxor's Moon Ring that would be shown upon ultimate victory. The conditions for this to happen was if the player could bring all the major characters including Morkin to the Gate of Varenorn and eliminate Shareth. The first to do so was then-15-year-old Richard Harris from Lowestoft in November 1984. Harris, however, had to wait for the models for 14 months‚Äîuntil January 1986‚Äîbecause the publisher had not expected anyone to \\"finish the game so quickly\\". Doomdark's Revenge was adapted into a Fighting Fantasy-style gamebook type game by Beyond Software's Clive Bailey and Terry Pratt that was serialized in three parts in Computer and Video Games magazine. The first part, published in the December 1984 issue, follows Luxor to the Frozen Gates that lead into Icemark. In the second part, Tarithel makes her way through Icemark to the pit of Alazorne, where Morkin is held captive. In the final part, the freed Morkin sets on his own quest to find and kill the evil Shareth. A novelisation of Doomdark's Revenge was announced,https://www.drewwagar.com/announcements/doomdarks-revenge-the- official-novel/ but has not progressed past first draft stage. First draft - \\"in progress\\" Reception Doomdark's Revenge was very well received by game critics and public alike. Amstrad Action gave it a review score of 95%, making it their ninth best game of all time. In 1993, readers of Your Sinclair voted it the 71st best game of all time. The Eye of the Moon Originally the series was conceived as a trilogy, with the third part titled The Eye of the Moon. The sequel is even mentioned in the game's manual: \\"The third part of the trilogy, possibly the most exciting yet, is still to come, when Mike will send Morkin down to the warmer lands which lie below Midnight itself, to find the Eye of the Moon.\\" The Eye of the Moon was to be a magical crystal, or jewel, that allowed its owner to look into the future. According to Singleton \\"Luxor is dying, it's some years on and he's reached the end of his tether, and he wants to see what is going to happen to Midnight in the future. So Morkin goes off in search of the magical jewel called the Eye of the Moon which enables people to see into the future, so that Luxor can then rest in peace.\\" Some of Singleton's plans included a game canvas four times bigger than the original Lords of Midnight, divided into twelve kingdoms set south- west of the original game, dynamic full-color graphics with black masking to hide any color clashes, unique graphics for all castles, unique, generated, full-scale facial graphics for all characters, a more convincing name generator, interior scenes of keeps and citadels, et cetera. There were even tentative plans to implement a multiplayer mode, using the already existing mic/ear sockets to exchange data. Despite having already created a substantial amount of new game code, Singleton was involved in numerous other game projects at the time and thus put the game on hiatus. In a July 1985 article published in July 1985 in Computer Gamer, Singleton disclosed quite a lot of details of the game. The game was to have 16,000 locations and 131,000 unique views, created with a new technique called Randscaping. The Randscaping engine made every view unique. In multiplayer mode, the two players would each control either Morkin or Tarithel on their quest to find the fabled jewel. His new Midnight Identikit could create personalized faces for all the 256 NPCs roaming the canvas. Some of the NPCs were to have unique capabilities; for instance, one character would have the magic ability to flatten mountains, and was to be a critical recruitment for one of the mini-quests, allowing the player access beyond an impassable mountain range to retrieve an item. Another NPC could control the weather, and so on. At the start of the game, the player(s) would only be able to control Morkin and Tarithel, recruiting more characters to their cause as the game progresses. The recruited characters could be made part of teams headed by a character chosen by the player, making moving the characters around the playing field a lot easier. The last attempt by Singleton to get the game released was in April 1989. Today there exists no authentic material for The Eye of the Moon. Some presentation mock-ups were created by Singleton; all still available screenshots‚Äîif any‚Äîare from these faked mock-ups. While the most serious intention of both Singleton and publisher Domark indeed was to create this third part, the sequel was later indefinitely shelved, partly due to Mike Singleton's other commitments and partly due to the original publisher being bought out by Telecomsoft. Because of this, the new management wanted to change the terms of agreement, demanding two distinct versions of the game‚Äî8-bit and 16-bit versions‚Äîinstead of one. Singleton refused the new agreement. The Eye of the Moon has since been mentioned for a possible upcoming release. With Mike Singleton again involved, a significant amount of work had already taken place. However, with the death of creator Singleton, all developments on the possible sequel have ceased, with the consensus that \\"it shall always remain a myth or a legend\\". Doomdark's Revenge would, however, be followed many years later by another sequel, Lords of Midnight: The Citadel.

For example, in California, when a couple fills out a marriage license application, they have the option of checking the box as to whether the marriage is \\"confidential\\" (Record will be closed, and not opened to public once recorded) or \\"public\\" (record will become public record once recorded). Essentially, if the marriage record is public, a copy of the record can be ordered from the county in which the marriage occurred.\\"Article from Public Records 101\\" History Since the earliest organised societies, with taxation, disputes, and so on, records of some sort have been needed. In ancient Babylon records were kept in cuneiform writing on clay tablets. In the Inca empire of South America, which did not have writing, records were kept via an elaborate form of knots in cords, quipu, whose meaning has been lost. In Western Europe in the Late Middle Ages public records included census records as well as records of birth, death, and marriage; an example is the 1086 Domesday Book of William the Conqueror.\\"The Domesday Book\\", BBC The details of royal marriage agreements, which were effectively international treaties, were also recorded. The United Kingdom Public Record Office Act, which formalised record-keeping by setting up the Public Record Office, was passed in 1838.\\"History of the Public Records Acts\\", The National Archives Public records * Records of law court proceedings * Marriage records * Mug shot Access to public records Although public records are records of public business, they are not necessarily available without restriction, although Freedom of Information legislation (FOI) that has been gradually introduced in many jurisdictions since the 1960s has made access easier. Each government has policies and regulations that govern the availability of information contained in public records. A common restriction is that data about a person is not normally available to others; for example, the California Public Records Act (PRA) states that \\"except for certain explicit exceptions, personal information maintained about an individual may not be disclosed without the person's consent\\".California Public Records Act CA Codes (gov:6250-6270) - Official California Legislative Information In the United Kingdom, Cabinet papers were subject to the thirty-year rule: until the introduction of FOI legislation, Cabinet papers were not available for thirty years; some information could be withheld for longer. the rule still applies to some information, such as minutes of Cabinet meetings. Some companies provide access, for a fee, to many public records available on the Internet. Many of them specialize in particular types of information, while some offer access to different types of record, typically to professionals in various fields. Some companies sell software with a promise of unlimited access to public records, but may provide nothing more than basic information on how to access already available and generally free public websites. Each year news media, civic groups, libraries, nonprofits, schools and other interested groups sponsor \\"Sunshine Week.\\" Sunshine Week occurs in mid-March, coinciding with James Madison's birthday and National Freedom of Information Day on the 16th. The purpose of the week is to highlight the idea that \\"government functions best when it operates in the open.\\" In many states, state legislatures are often exempt from public- records laws that apply to state executive officials and local officials. In 2016, the Associated Press made a request for the emails and daily schedules of state legislative leaders (speakers of state Houses and presidents of state Senates) in all 50 states; a majority denied the request. =Court records= Of particular significance was the evolution of the common-law right \\"to access court records to inspect and to copy\\". The expectation inherent in the common law right to access court records is that any person may come to the office of the clerk of the court during business hours and request to inspect court records, with almost instantaneous access. Such right is a central safeguard of the integrity of the courts. Any decision to conceal court records requires a sealing order. The right to access court records is also central to liberty: There is no conceivable way to exercise the Habeas Corpus right, deemed by the late Justice BrennanWilliam J. Brennan, Jr. as \\"the cornerstone\\" of the United States Constitution, absent access to court records as public records. In the United States the common law right to \\"access court records to inspect and to copy\\" was reaffirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in Nixon v Warner Communications, Inc (1978), where the court found various parts of the right to access court records as inherent to the First, Fourth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments. In the United States access to court records is governed by Civil Rights in the Amendments to the United States Constitution, not by the Freedom of Information Act. As court records become increasingly more accessible online, concerns about the undermining of private information has become a significant issue. In the past, obtaining court records required people to physically go to a courthouse and request documents, making privacy concerns essentially obsolete. However, with the relative ease at which people can now access these records, highly sensitive information (i.e. victim names, social security numbers, etc.) are at risk of being publicly exploited. =In the United States= Access to U.S. national public records is guided by the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Requests for access to records pursuant to FOIA may be refused by federal agencies if information requested is subject to exemption, or some information may be redacted (deleted). In addition to the national FOIA, all states have some form of FOI legislation. For example, Colorado has the Colorado Open Records Act (CORA);Colorado Open Records Act in New Jersey the law is known as the Open Public Records Act (OPRA).Open Public Records Act There are many degrees of accessibility to public records between states, with some making it fairly easy to request and receive documents, and others with many exemptions and restricted categories of documents. One state that is fairly responsive to public records requests is New York, which utilizes the Committee on Open Government to assist citizens with their requests.Committee on Open Government A state that was fairly restrictive in how they respond to public records requests is Pennsylvania, where the law formerly presumed that all documents are exempt from disclosure, unless they can be proven otherwise.Pa.'s open secret By Dimitri Vassilaros(July 27, 2007)- Pittsburgh Tribune-Review This was changed by a 2008 bill that went into effect in 2009. The California Public Records Act (California Government Code ¬ß¬ß6250-6276.48) covers the arrest and booking records of inmates in the State of California jails and prisons, which are not covered by First Amendment rights (freedom of speech and of the press). Public access to arrest and booking records is seen as a critical safeguard of liberty. Uses of public records With the advent of the Internet and the information age, access to public records in the United States to anyone who wishes to view them has dramatically increased. Third parties such as the information broker industry make regular use of public records to compile readily accessible profiles on millions of people, and may make a profit from the service of recompiling and mining the data. Public record data is used for multiple purposes, such as ensuring that child support payments are made as determined by the courts,Office of Child Support Enforcement FY 2005 Annual Report to Congress May 2008 assisting credit bureaus in keeping accurate dataFTC.gov and helping to pay pension benefits to retirees.Waysandmeans.house.gov Access to criminal records in the United States Individual criminal histories are generally considered to be public records in the United States and are often accessed via criminal history background checks, but \\"access and use of FBI-maintained criminal history record information has been traditionally limited and controlled in large measure to protect the privacy of the individuals to whom the records pertain.\\"THE ATTORNEY GENERAL‚ÄôS REPORT ON CRIMINAL HISTORY BACKGROUND CHECKS, U.S. Department of Justice, Office of the Attorney General, June 2006, p. 95. The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act imposes \\"fair information-practice requirements by consumer reporting agencies that report public record information, such as criminal history records, for employment purposes,\\" and some state consumer-protection laws impose more restrictive regulations.THE ATTORNEY GENERAL‚ÄôS REPORT ON CRIMINAL HISTORY BACKGROUND CHECKS, U.S. Department of Justice, Office of the Attorney General, June 2006, pp. 1-2. According to the Reporters' Committee for Freedom of the Press, in the United States, arrest records \\"are generally open to the public unless they concern an active or ongoing investigation. A few states restrict the information that can be obtained from an arrest record, especially when it concerns individuals who were never charged, were acquitted or had their records expunged. Again, the determination will often result in a balancing test comparing the public's interest in disclosure against the individual privacy interest.\\" By contrast, protective custody and juvenile delinquency records are exempted from most state open-records laws, such that access is \\"limited to the juvenile, his or her parents or guardians, or other parties directly involved in a legal matter.\\"Juvenile Records, Reporters' Committee for Freedom of the Press.

Inspired by Jules Verne's play Journey Through the Impossible, and modeled in style and format on M√©li√®s's earlier, highly successful A Trip to the Moon, the film is a satire of scientific exploration in which a group of geographically minded tourists attempt a journey to the sun using various methods of transportation. The film was a significant international success at the time of its release, and has been well-received by film historians. Plot The travelers board the Auto-Crazyloff car Note: Since the film is silent and has no intertitles, the proper names and quotations below are taken from the English-language description of the film published by M√©li√®s in the catalog of the Star Film Company's New York Branch. A society of geographical enthusiasts, the Institute of Incoherent Geography, plans to make a world tour in such a way as to \\"surpass in conception and invention all previous expeditions undertaken by the learned world.\\" At a meeting headed by President Polehunter, \\"assisted by Secretary Rattlebrain, by the Archivist Mole, by the Vice-president Humbug, the members of the office, Easily-fooled, Daredevil, Schemer, etc., etc.,\\" the sumptuously dressed ladies and gentlemen of the Institute listen to Professor Daredevil's plan for the world tour, but reject it for being out-of-date. The president then welcomes the eccentric engineer Crazyloff. He explains his project for a new \\"impossible\\" voyage, using \\"all the known means of locomotion‚Äîrailroads, automobiles, dirigible balloons, submarine boats‚Ä¶\\" The unusual plan is accepted enthusiastically, and preparations begin. When work is complete, the machines and travelers are loaded onto a train and are sent to the Swiss Alps, where the travelers will begin their journey. They first board a touring automobile, the Auto-Crazyloff, and journey through the mountains. In an attempt to run at high speed over the summit of the Rigi, the travelers crash at the bottom of a precipice. They are saved by mountaineers and rushed to a Swiss hospital, where they make gradual but chaotic recoveries. The expedition travels to the Sun After they have finished recovering, the travelers board a train with their other vehicles attached to it, and make a second attempt at running over a summit: this time, the Jungfrau. Getting higher and higher every minute, with dirigible balloons tied to the train, they rise into space and are swallowed by the Sun. The travelers land with a crash on the Sun's surface. They are happy to be alive, but the heat is too much for them. Crazyloff directs the travelers to seek shelter in the train's gigantic icebox, but this plan goes too far in the other direction: moments later, the whole group has been frozen solid. Crazyloff finds a bundle of straw among the debris and starts a fire on the surface of the Sun to melt the ice. The travelers thaw out and are happily shepherded into the expedition's submarine. Crazyloff launches it off a cliff on the Sun, and it plummets through space to fall into an ocean on Earth. After a few minutes of underwater sightseeing, a boiler problem causes the submarine to explode. The travelers are thrown up into the air, landing safely at a seaport amid the wreckage of the submarine. They return in triumph to the Institute of Incoherent Geography, where a grand rejoicing is held for them. =Epilogue= An optional 50-meter-long epilogue, \\"Suppl√©ment Voyage √† travers l'impossible\\" (advertised in the US as Supplementary Section of the \\"Impossible Voyage\\"), was sold separately. The epilogue begins in Crazyloff's study, where he is criticized by the Institute of Incoherent Geography for losing so much transportation equipment during the voyage. At the top of the Institute's tower, he presents his plan for recovering the equipment: a powerful magnet able to attract the automobile lost in Switzerland, the train that was eaten by the Sun, and the submarine destroyed at sea. The plan is a success and is celebrated at a banquet where Crazyloff is applauded by his scientific colleagues. The epilogue was believed lost until the 1970s when the M√©li√®s scholar John Frazer discovered and examined it in the archives of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences among surviving negatives from Star Film's New York offices. However, a 2008 M√©li√®s filmography by Jacques Malth√™te lists the supplement as lost. Cast *Georges M√©li√®s as the engineer Crazyloff (in French, Mabouloff; \\"maboul\\" is French for \\"crazy\\" or \\"crackpot\\") *Fernande Albany as Mrs. Polehunter, the institute president's wife (in French, Madame Latrouille, wife of President Latrouille; \\"avoir la trouille\\" is French for \\"to be scared or nervous\\"), one of the travelers *May de Lavergne as a nurse in the Swiss hospital *Jehanne d'Alcy as a villager at the seaport Production Engraving of the play Journey Through the Impossible, one of M√©li√®s's inspirations The original French title of the film, Le Voyage √† travers l'impossible, comes from a stage spectacular of the same name, written in 1882 by Jules Verne. M√©li√®s was probably inspired by memories of this play, but otherwise the film bears little connection to it; the plot structure appears to be inspired more closely by a previous M√©li√®s hit, A Trip to the Moon. The Impossible Voyage was made during the summer of 1904. The film, running to 374 meters (about 20 minutes at silent-film projection speeds), was M√©li√®s's longest to date, and cost about 37,500 (7,500) to make. In its staging and design, the film is symmetrical with A Trip to the Moon: while the astronomers' progress toward the moon in that film is consistently depicted as left-to-right motion, the Institute of Incoherent Geography's progress toward the sun in The Impossible Voyage is consistently right-to-left. While most of the film was shot inside M√©li√®s's glass studio, the scene at the foot of the Jungfrau was filmed outdoors, in the garden of M√©li√®s's property in Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis. The factory set in the second scene recalls the Hall des Machines at the Paris Exposition of 1900. Techniques used for special effects include stage machinery (including scenery rolling horizontally and vertically), pyrotechnics, miniature effects, substitution splices, and dissolves. Release Another title card used for the film The film was released by M√©li√®s's Star Film Company and numbered 641‚Äì659 in its catalogues, where it was advertised as an Invraisemblable √©quip√©e d'un groupe de savants de la Soci√©t√© de G√©ographie incoh√©rente; pi√®ce fantastique nouvelle en 40 tableaux. (The optional supplementary section was sold separately and numbered 660‚Äì661.) The earliest known English-language catalogues give the title as An Impossible Voyage in the United States and Whirling the Worlds in Britain. The French catalogue descriptions give French names for many of the characters: the engineer is Mabouloff, and the Institute's membership includes Professor Latrouille (its president), Madame Latrouille, Madame Mabouloff, Secretary Foulard, Archivist Lataupe, Vice-President Patoche, and Professor Ventrouillard (who proposes the unaccepted project at the beginning of the film). The American catalogue gives Anglicized names (see Plot section above), while Mabouloff/Crazyloff's servant is called Bob in both languages. A print of the film (though not the supplemental epilogue) was deposited for American copyright at the Library of Congress on October 12, 1904. As with at least 4% of M√©li√®s's entire output, some prints were individually hand-colored and sold at a higher price. In the late twentieth century, a surviving hand-colored copy was donated to M√©li√®s's family by the Czech Film Archive. Reception A surviving print of the film The Impossible Voyage was one of the most popular films of the first few years of the twentieth century, rivaled only by similar M√©li√®s films such as The Kingdom of the Fairies and the massively successful A Trip to the Moon. The film critic Lewis Jacobs said of the film: Film scholar Elizabeth Ezra highlights the film's sharp social satire, noting how the rich but inept members of the Institute \\"wreak havoc wherever they go, disrupting the lives of bucolic mountain climbers, alpine villagers, factory workers and sailors,\\" and arguing that this conflict between upper classes and working classes is mirrored by other contrasts in the film (heat and ice, sun and sea, and so on). Popular culture *Queen's 1995 music video \\"Heaven for Everyone\\" contains footage of The Impossible Voyage, as well as M√©li√®s' best- known film Le Voyage Dans La Lune.

The city formed part of Roman Hispania in the beginning of the 1st century BC. In AD 713, the city was taken by Muslim Berbers (Moors) from the Visigoths and in the 11th century, it was conquered by King Alfonso VI of Castile. Following this, the walls, parts of which still stand, were constructed to repel frequent Arab incursions that took place until the end of the Reconquista.

Written by Harry Julian Fink, the film is about a Union cavalry officer who leads a contentious troop of Army regulars, Confederate prisoners, and Indian scouts on an expedition into Mexico during the American Civil War to destroy a band of Apaches who have been raiding United States bases and settlements in the New Mexico territory. Major Dundee was filmed in various locations in Mexico. The movie was filmed in Eastman Color by Path√©color, print by Technicolor. Plot During the American Civil War, Union cavalry officer Major Amos Dundee (Charlton Heston) has been relieved of his command for an unspecified tactical error at the Battle of Gettysburg (it is implied that he showed too much initiative) and sent to head a prisoner-of-war camp in the New Mexico Territory. After a family of ranchers and a relief column of cavalry are massacred by an Apache war chief named Sierra Charriba (Michael Pate), Dundee, seizes the opportunity for glory, sends out his scout Samuel Potts (James Coburn) to locate Charriba and begins raising his own private army. He attempts to recruit Confederate prisoners led by his former friend turned rival from West Point, Captain Ben Tyreen (Richard Harris). Tyreen bears a grudge against Dundee and refuses his request. Before the war, Dundee cast the deciding vote in Tyreen's court-martial from the U.S. Army prior to the American Civil War for participating in a duel, leading to Tyreen's dismissal from the service and his later becoming an officer in the Confederate Army. Dundee begins building his army. Among them are Tim Ryan (Michael Anderson Jr.) who is the only survivor of the massacre, as well as a horse thief, a drunken mule-packer, a vengeful minister, and a small group of black soldiers who were formerly slaves. Dundee reluctantly appoints the inexperienced Lieutenant Graham (Jim Hutton) as his second in command. Eventually, Tyreen changes his mind and accepts Dundee's offer. He binds himself and his men to loyally serve Dundee, but only until Charriba is \\"taken or destroyed.\\" When the diverse factions of Dundee's force are not fighting each other, they engage the Apaches in several bloody battles. Though they rescue several young children captured by the Apaches, the Americans lose most of their supplies in an ambush, forcing them to raid a village garrisoned by French troops supporting Emperor Maximilian of Mexico. However, there is little to loot, and Dundee ends up sharing some of his dwindling food with the starving Mexicans. Beautiful resident Teresa Santiago (Senta Berger), the Austrian widow of a doctor executed for his support of the rebels under Benito Ju√°rez, causes further tensions between Dundee and Tyreen as they compete for her attention. Dundee makes it easy for his French prisoners to escape. When they return with reinforcements as he had expected, Dundee surprises them in a night attack and makes off with badly needed supplies. After the successful raid, the men of the command begin to get along. However, one of the Confederates, O.W. Hadley (Warren Oates) attempts to desert. Dundee is forced to order his execution, which again divides the men. Teresa and Dundee then have a brief affair. In an unguarded moment with her, he is attacked by the Apaches and wounded in the leg, forcing him to seek medical help in French-held Durango. The doctor successfully removes the arrow, but Dundee has to remain there to recuperate. He is tended by a pretty Mexican, whom he eventually takes to bed. When Teresa comes upon them unexpectedly, her relationship with Dundee comes to an abrupt end. Dundee starts drinking heavily as a result. Graham leads a small group of men to sneak into town to distract the French while Tyreen shames Dundee into resuming his mission. Charriba proves difficult to pin down, so Dundee pretends to give up and starts back for the United States. The Apaches give chase and end up in a trap. Charriba is killed by Ryan during the ambush. With their bargain concluded, Dundee and Tyreen prepare to resume their personal battle, but the vengeful French appear, forcing the two men to set aside their differences. With the French having positioned a portion of their force on the American side of the Rio Grande, blocking Dundee's forces from crossing into U.S. territory, the two cavalry forces charge each other at the Rio Grande, with major loss of life on both sides. Tyreen sees a French soldier seize the U.S. regimental colors, and seemingly moved by a patriotism he had thought dead, he takes back the captured American flag, and hands it over to Dundee ‚Äì only to be shot in the stomach. With his last strength, he rides off to singlehandedly delay a second detachment of French cavalry while the others escape across the Rio Grande. Most of the men under Dundee's command have been killed, with only himself, Graham, Potts, Ryan, Sergeant Gomez, the Confederates Chillum and Benteen, and a few other soldiers escaping. As Dundee's force heads home, the narration notes that it's now April 19, 1865, and the soldiers are still unaware that the Civil War is over and President Lincoln has been assassinated.

However, contrary to claims by the production team at the time, it was not actually based on a true story. The film's novelization was written by Richard Wormser. During the Minnesota Dakota War of 1862, Union forces in that state were forced to recruit Confederate prisoners from Texas to make up for their meager numbers in fighting the Indians. Unlike the movie, where there is much animosity between the Union and Confederate troops in Dundee's command, the rebels, called \\"Galvanized Yankees\\", fought well and without much complaint. Both Union and Confederate forces also battled Apache, Navajo, and Comanche Indians throughout the war along the U.S.-Mexico border, making the scenario of the movie at least somewhat plausible. Before the film's production, Peckinpah had been working on a Custer project, based on the novel by Hoffman Birney The Dice of God, but later abandoned it for this film. (His screenplay was filmed by Arnold Laven, as The Glory Guys). Critics of the film have also pointed out similarities between this and Herman Melville's classic novel Moby-Dick. Many of the characters are similar to those from that book, with Dundee as Captain Ahab, Tyreen as Starbuck, Ryan as Ishmael, and other minor characters, with Sierra Charriba and his Apache tribe substituting for the whale, as is the general plot line (an obsessive idealist drives himself to destruction, disregarding the effects on others). These references to Moby- Dick were likely intentional on the part of the screenwriters. Some have also pointed out similarities of the plot to the Vietnam War, which are highly unlikely to have been intentional, as the war had not significantly escalated at the time of the film's production. The opening scene at the Rostes Ranch and the funeral after the first skirmish with the Indians were inspired by scenes from The Searchers, while the scene in which Dundee's troop exits Fort Benlin, each faction of the command singing its own distinct song, is a deliberate parody of an equivalent scene in Fort Apache. The characterization of Dundee, particularly his personality as a martinet and his relationship with Tyreen, has been related to John Wayne's character in Howard Hawks' Red River. The Mexican Civil War setting recalls Robert Aldrich's Vera Cruz. The film also includes several references to David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia ‚Äì the execution of Hadley, and Dundee's drunken exile in Durango, closely mirror sequences from this film. The film \\"seems a direct reaction to [John] Ford's Fort Apache ... with Charlton Heston cast as a more psychotic, more bluntly careerist version of Ford's Lt. Col. Owen Thursday (Henry Fonda),\\" according to a NY Times review of the film at the time of the 2013 Blu-ray release. Reviewer Dave Kehr went on to write that Peckinpah \\"plays Heston's square- jawed intransigence against the aristocratic refinement of a Southern officer (overplayed by ... Harris)\\" and that Peckinpah \\"would essentially reshape this material into The Wild Bunch four years later, wisely dividing Dundee's divided character into two separate figures\\" played then by Robert Ryan and William Holden.Kehr, Dave, \\"Early Salvos From 'Bloody Sam'\\", New York Times, May 12, 2013. The Blu-ray DVD includes both the 1965 and 2005 cuts. Retrieved May 14, 2013. Production =Screenplay= Peckinpah found the script in late 1963. The early draft by Fink focused on Trooper Ryan and presented the film as a typical adventure story. Peckinpah largely discarded this, and working closely with acclaimed screenwriter, Oscar Saul (A Streetcar Named Desire) began making the movie into a complex character study about Dundee, making him a glory-hungry officer who would do anything to gain fame and recognition. He had the support of Heston, who had seen and enjoyed Peckinpah's previous film, Ride the High Country, and was eager to work with the director. Actor R.G. Armstrong, who had a small part as a Reverend who tags along with the expedition, referred to the 156 minutes version of the film as \\"Moby-Dick on horseback\\". =Principal photography= The production of the movie was very troubled. Peckinpah was often drunk on the set, and was supposedly so abusive towards the cast that Heston had to threaten him with a cavalry saber in order to calm him down: he even charged Peckinpah on horseback at one point, leading the director to panic and order the camera crane he was working on to be raised fast. Peckinpah also fired a large number of crew members for very trivial reasons throughout the shoot. Columbia studio executives feared that the project was out of control, and that Peckinpah was too unstable to finish the picture, so they cut the shooting schedule of the film by several weeks. Heston gave up his entire salary for the film in order to keep Peckinpah on the project ‚Äì a gesture rarely equaled in Hollywood history. The studio, however, forced Peckinpah to wrap up shooting very abruptly. Heston alleged that Peckinpah, towards the end of the shoot, simply became drunk and wandered off the set, and that he (Heston) had to finish directing many portions of the movie himself. =Post-production= The length of Peckinpah's original cut has been disputed. According to some sources, including the 2005 DVD commentary, the original cut was 4 hours 38 minutes long, which was initially edited down to 156 minutes. Included in the unseen longer cuts were several slow-motion battle scenes inspired by Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai. The movie was also fairly gory for the standards of 1965, and more bloody and violent scenes were cut out. A bombastic musical score by Daniele Amfitheatrof was added to the film despite Peckinpah's protests, as was the title song, \\"The Major Dundee March\\", sung by Mitch Miller and his Sing-Along Gang. One of the most bizarre parts of the score was the use of an electronically altered sound ‚Äì three anvils of different lengths played-back at half-speed every time Charriba or the Apaches would be seen or even mentioned. \\"Until the Apache is taken or destroyed\\" was one of the film's catch phrases. At the film's initial release, it was 136 minutes long. After a disastrous premiere ‚Äì the movie was almost universally panned by critics ‚Äì an additional thirteen minutes were cut out, despite the protests of Peckinpah and producer Jerry Bresler. Some feel that these cuts ruined the movie's scope and created significant plot holes, though others argue that these plot holes exist even in the extended version. Major Dundee helped cement Peckinpah's image as a renegade filmmaker, which he would enhance with the conflicts on his later films, such as The Wild Bunch, Straw Dogs, Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, and Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia. Others, namely Peckinpah's biographer David Weddle (author of If They Move ... Kill 'Em! The Life and Times of Sam Peckinpah), argue that Peckinpah is just as much to blame for the final product as Columbia and Jerry Bresler. Since its release on DVD, Dundee has begun to get recognition and notice from the public at large, and not just Western fans. =Filming locations= * Chilpancingo, Guerrero, Mexico * Estudios Churubusco, Mexico City, Distrito Federal, Mexico (studio) (interiors) * Cuautla, Morelos, Mexico (exteriors) * Durango, Mexico * El Saltito waterfall, Nombre de Dios, Durango, Mexico * Guerrero, Mexico * La Marquesa National Park, Mexico City, Distrito Federal, Mexico (ranch: Rostes) * Marquesas, Mexico * Mescala, Mexico * Mexico City, Distrito Federal, Mexico * Morelos, Mexico * Rio Balsas, Guerrero, Mexico (finale: battle) * Tehuixtla, Morelos, Mexico (exteriors) * Tequesquitengo, Morelos, Mexico (exteriors) * Jonacatepec, Morelos, Mexico * Tlayacapan, Morelos, Mexico * Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n, Mexico * Vista Hermosa, Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n, Mexico (exteriors) Restored version In April 2005, the New York City based Film Forum premiered an \\"expanded\\" version featuring several restored scenes, along with a new musical score by Christopher Caliendo. This expanded version was actually the 136-minute cut authorized by producer Jerry Bresler before he left Columbia Studios. Recently unearthed in Sony Pictures' archives, the restored version played in selected cities in North America and has been released on a Region 1 DVD. All of the cuts were edited out of the released version at the last minute; it is highly unlikely that Peckinpah's director's cut will ever be fully restored. Restored scenes are listed below. These include both brief inserts and additions to existing scenes, as well as four major scenes restored to the film. * Ryan plays \\"Taps\\" as soldiers bury the victims of the massacre. * After Dundee, Potts, and the other Union troopers survey the massacre at the Rostes Ranch, Tyreen and his Confederates attempt to escape through a mountain stream. They are trapped by troops from the fort and Dundee's command. The next scene shows Dundee announcing to the fort's prisoners his need for volunteers. The scene introduces the character of Tyreen, who is only awkwardly introduced in the theatrical version, and provides the reason why he and his men are to hang later in the film (they killed a guard during their escape attempt). * Tyreen's men refuse to wear the Union jackets provided to them by Dundee. * Children watch Dundee's expedition leaving Fort Benlin. * The wrestling match between Potts and the scout Riago is much longer, with Dundee chiding Potts because the artillery bet on him. * Paco, one of Potts' Indian scouts, is killed by Apaches before the river ambush. * The fiesta scene in the Mexican village is longer, with Potts leering at a pretty girl, who snubs him (which would have led to the knife fight scene detailed below), and Teresa trying to comfort a crying baby. * Dundee recovers from his leg wound in Durango, while being tended to by Melinche (Aurora Clavell), eventually falling in love with her. * Dundee and his officers ‚Äì Tyreen, Potts, Lt. Graham, and Sgt. Gomez ‚Äì find an Apache trail marker, and then debate strategy on how to fight Charriba. At the end of the scene, we learn the fate of Apache scout Riago, who had earlier in the film been accused of being an agent of Charriba's by Dundee and others. In the restored version, he is found crucified in a tree. In the theatrical version, his character disappeared without a trace. Available as extras on the DVD are an unfinished knife fight scene between Potts and Gomez in a Mexican village, a longer version of Teresa and Dundee's interlude at the lake, and several silent outtakes ‚Äì including a master shot which would have opened the massacre scene at the beginning, of Lt. Brannin and his men riding past a sheep farmer to the Rostes Ranch. For the 2005 restored version, a new score was composed by Christopher Caliendo. This score was composed and recorded with a small studio orchestra to authentically sound the way director Peckinpah might have approved it had he been alive at the time of the film's restoration, and the way the music might have been done in its original 1965 release as opposed to today's larger orchestra-type scores. The new score is regarded by some critics as being better than the original, which was disliked by film experts and featured the title song performed by the Mitch Miller Sing-a-Long Gang, though many concede the new music is far from perfect; for example, there has been criticism of Caliendo's decision to leave unscored several sequences which did have music in the original version. Reception Upon its theatrical release, Major Dundee received generally negative reviews while acknowledging the film's potential. In his review in The New York Times, Eugene Archer wrote that the film had \\"an interesting cast, a superior visual texture, unexpected bits of character revelation and a choppy continuity that finally negates its impact.\\" He praised Peckinpah for \\"seeking a fresh approach to the Western\\" and acknowledged that the director \\"displays a fine eye for panoramic vistas.\\" Archer concludes: Many of the flaws identified by film critics in 1965 were addressed in the 2005 restored version, and film reviews of the DVD are much more positive. In his review in Alt Film Guide, Dan Schneider called Major Dundee \\"a near-great film that has a checkered history\\" and \\"likely the most gritty and realistic Western ever made.\\" On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 97% approval rating based on 32 reviews with an average rating of 7.3/10, and a 67% positive audience rating based on 3,480 user ratings. The site's critics consensus declares the film \\"a Western-type with big war scenes, shot with bombast typical of Sam Peckinpah\\". Metacritic, another review aggregator, reports a score of 62/100 based on 12 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".

Biography Dodge was born in Niles, Michigan, where his father ran a foundry and machine shop. John and his younger brother, Horace, were inseparable as children and as adults. The origins of the Dodge family lie in Stockport, England, where their ancestral home still stands. In 1886, the Dodge family moved to Detroit, where John and Horace took jobs at a boiler maker plant. In 1894 they went to work as machinists at the Dominion Typograph Company in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. While John was the sales-minded managerial type, his brother Horace was a gifted mechanic and inveterate tinkerer. Using a dirt-proof ball bearing Horace invented and patented, in 1897 Dodge arranged a deal for the brothers to join with a third-party investor to manufacture bicycles. Within a few years, they sold the bicycle business and in 1900 used the proceeds of the sale to set up their own machine shop in Detroit. In their first year of business, the Dodge brothers' company began making parts for the automobile industry. In 1902 the Dodge brothers won a contract to build transmissions for the Olds Motor Vehicle Company upon which they built a solid reputation for quality and service. However, the following year they turned down a second contract from Olds to retool their Detroit plant at Hastings Street and Monroe AvenueLocation of former Dodge workshops to build engines for Henry Ford in a deal that included a share position in the new Ford Motor Company. By 1910, John Dodge and his brother were so successful they built a new plant in Hamtramck, Michigan. For ten years (1903‚Äì1913), the Dodge brothers' business was a Ford Motor Company supplier, and Dodge worked as vice president of the Ford company. He left Ford in 1913, and in 1914 he and Horace formed Dodge Brothers to develop their own line of automobiles. They began building motor trucks for the United States military during the arms buildup for World War I, and in October 1917 they produced their first commercial car. At war's end, their company produced and marketed both cars and trucks. He was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1997. Because of his temper and often crude behavior, the red-haired Early history of the Dodge brothers Dodge was seen as socially unacceptable to most of the well-heeled elite of Detroit. Nevertheless, his wealth made him an influential member of the community and he became active in Republican Party politics in Michigan. Family The Dodge brothers were the sons of machinist Daniel Rugg Dodge (1819‚Äì1897) and Maria Duval Casto (1823‚Äì1906). Maria was Daniel's second wife. They had an elder full sister: Della Lone (1863‚Äì1936) and older half brother Charles Frontier Dodge (1855‚Äì1926), and half sister Laura Belle (1858-?) from Daniel's first marriage to Lorinda Gould (1820‚Äì1860). John Dodge married Canadian Ivy Hawkins (1864‚Äì1901) in September 1892. They had three children: *Winifred (1894‚Äì1980) *Isabel Cleves (1896‚Äì1962) *John Duval Dodge (1898‚Äì1942) Following Ivy (Hawkins) Dodge's death from tuberculosis, he secretly married Isabelle Smith (who was his housekeeper) in Walkerville, Ontario, on December 8, 1902. They separated in 1905 and quietly divorced in 1907; the marriage was kept secret until after the death of his third wife. Shortly after the divorce from Isabelle, Dodge married his secretary, Matilda Rausch (1883‚Äì1967). Dodge had three more children with Matilda: *Frances Matilda (1914‚Äì1971) *Daniel George (1917‚Äì1938) *Anna Margaret (1919‚Äì1924) In 1908, John Dodge and Matilda purchased the land for Meadow Brook Farms near Rochester, Michigan. At Meadow Brook, their eldest child, Frances, developed a love of horses that led her to acquire Castleton Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, and turn it into one of the leading horse breeding operations in the United States. Dodge's daughter Isabel established Brookmeade Stable. It became a major participant in Thoroughbred horse racing and owned several Champions, including the U.S. Racing Hall of Fame horses Cavalcade and Sword Dancer. Five years after Dodge's death in 1920, Matilda married Alfred Wilson and they built the Meadow Brook Hall at the Rochester estate. His great grandson is film producer John F Dodge III. Death and legacy Dodge brothers mausoleum John and Horace contracted influenza and pneumonia while in New York City during the 1918 flu pandemic. John died on January 14, 1920, at the Ritz-Carlton, aged 55. He was interred in the Egyptian-style family mausoleum in Detroit's Woodlawn Cemetery guarded by two Sphinx statues. Horace died the following December, and in 1925 their widows sold the Dodge Brothers automobile business to Dillon Read, investment bankers, for $146 million (equivalent to $ in ). Dodge's newborn daughter Anna Margaret died of the measles before age five. His son Daniel drowned in the waters off Manitoulin Island after falling overboard while being transported to hospital following an accident involving dynamite. He had just recently married, at age 21. After Dodge's death, Matilda married Alfred Wilson and adopted two children with him, Richard and Barbara Wilson. Matilda Dodge Wilson was Lieutenant Governor of Michigan briefly in 1940 under Republican Governor Luren Dickinson. In 1957, the Wilsons donated their Meadow Brook Farm, including Meadow Brook Hall, Sunset Terrace and all its other buildings and collections, along with $2 million (equivalent to $ in ), to Michigan State University to establish an extension campus. In 1963, the Michigan State University-Oakland was renamed Oakland University.

Biography A child prodigy who excelled in his Torah studies even as a young boy, Goldstein was the grandson of Rabbi Aharon, the chief rabbi of Breslov in Rebbe Nachman's day, and the son of Rabbi Zvi Aryeh, the succeeding rabbi of Breslov. He grew up in the town of Breslov. However, in his youth he shied away from Reb Noson. Once Reb Noson said to him, \\"Nachman, who knows? Maybe the reason Rebbe Nachman worked so hard to bring your grandfather to Breslav was because of you?\\" After that, Goldstein became a follower of Reb Noson, and after the latter's death, became very involved with Reb Noson's works. Goldstein raised his daughter's son, Abraham Sternhartz, after the latter was orphaned of his parents as a young child. As the grandson of Reb Noson's leading disciple and at the same time a great-grandson of Noson through his father's line, Sternhartz was privy to all the family traditions and stories about Rebbe Nachman's closest disciple. These formed the basis for his definitive collection of Breslov oral traditions, entitled Tovot Zichronot. Publications Goldstein was the first to write a learned commentary specifically on Rebbe Nachman's teachings, giving scholarly legitimacy to the Breslov movement after the death of Reb Noson in 1844. Many of today's English-language translations of Breslover works were only made possible because of the Tcheriner Rav's meticulous research and elucidation. He collected and published Noson's eight-volume magnum opus, Likutey Halachot, as well as an expanded version of Noson's Likutey Etzot (Advice) with additional material from Rebbe Nachman's teachings, under the title, Likutey Etzot HaMeshulash. Altogether, the Tcheriner Rav authored about 20 works, including halakhic responsa. Some were only seen by Breslover Hasidim in manuscript form before they were lost during World War II. The ones that survive are: *Parparaot LeChokhmah--a commentary that illuminates many complex concepts and structures in Likutey Moharan *Zimrat HaAretz--a commentary that connects each lesson in Likutey Moharan to the Land of Israel *Yekara DeShabbata--a commentary that relates each lesson in Likutey Moharan to the Sabbath day *Yerach HaEitanim--a commentary that relates each lesson in Likutey Moharan to Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur and Sukkot *Nachat HaShulchan--a commentary that describes the connection between numerous chapters of the Shulchan Aruch and the first lesson of Likutey Moharan *Rimzey Ma'asiyyot--a commentary on Sippurey Ma'asiyot (Rabbi Nachman's Stories) Goldstein also produced a collection of source texts for Sefer HaMiddot (The Aleph-Bet Book-- a collection of aphorisms on character traits), tracing Rebbe Nachman's references throughout the Bible, Talmud and Midrash. He also compiled teachings of the Baal Shem Tov and the Maggid of Mezeritch and their major disciples under the titles Leshon Hasidim and Derekh Hasidim. References *Kramer, Chaim (1989).

Alameda Wharf) was a railroad station and ferry wharf at the foot and west of present-day Pacific Avenue and Main Street in Alameda, California, on the eastern shore of San Francisco Bay with ferry service to San Francisco. It was built in 1864 and operated by the San Francisco and Alameda Railroad. In 1869, it served as the original west coast terminus of the U.S. First Transcontinental Railroad, until the opening of Oakland Pier two months later. The western terminus was inaugurated September 6, 1869, when the first Western Pacific through train from Sacramento reached the shores of San Francisco Bay at Alameda Terminal, thus completing the first transcontinental railroad to the Pacific coast. History Alameda Shore (Joseph Lee, ) depicts the ferry Sophie MacLane (left) approaching Alameda Wharf on August 25, 1864. In 1863, Alfred A. Cohen, a San Francisco lawyer, along with his associates, formulated plans to build a railroad and wharf to carry passengers not only to Alameda, but also by ferry to San Francisco. In 1864, he built a 3,750-foot-long wharf, starting from a spot near today's Pacific Avenue and Main Street westward, into the Bay at that time, and ending at part of today's Alameda Point where the USS Hornet sits anchored. On August 25, 1864, Cohen inaugurated passenger service, for 25 cents, from the wharf at Vallejo and Davis Street in San Francisco, via the leased river packet Sophie MacLane, to the Alameda Wharf and then five miles to his San Francisco and Alameda Railroad High St station. In September 1864, he leased the slightly larger Contra Costa. As business grew, he replaced the leased boat, in February 1866, with his very own ferry boat, the Alameda. =First transcontinental train= After the Pacific Railroad Act of 1862 authorized construction of the First transcontinental railroad and telegraph line, the first construction activity took place in 1863 eastward from Sacramento on the Central Pacific Railroad line. In October 1864, the Central Pacific Railroad assigned all the rights of the Pacific Railway Acts to the Western Pacific Railroad for the route between Sacramento and San Jose, including land grants. The plan was that the transcontinental railroad would follow the Western Pacific from Sacramento to San Jose and then connect with the San Francisco and San Jose Railroad (SF&SJ;), completed in 1864, to San Francisco. By 1866, Western Pacific had built of track north and east from San Jose, reaching halfway into Niles Canyon, to about Farwell near MilePost33. The Western Pacific used 500 Chinese laborers to grade and construct the rail line into the rugged canyon with its tight curves and narrow banks. Construction was then halted because of disagreements between the railroad‚Äôs contractors and its financiers. In 1868, Central Pacific Railroad, a subsidiary of which had acquired the Western Pacific and Oakland Point, restarted work on the Western Pacific Railroad line starting at Sacramento working southward, as well as near Lathrop and Livermore, using upwards to 2,000 Chinese laborers. The new plan was to connect with Oakland and Oakland Point with its ferry service to San Francisco. After the golden spike ceremony at Promontory Summit, work resumed in June 1869 in Niles Canyon with track laying towards Livermore. Also in June 1869, J. H. Strobridge came to Niles (then Vallejo Mills and now part of Fremont) to oversee the construction of the new line, with his crew of up to 600 Chinese laborers, heading towards Oakland. By midsummer, Governor Stanford made known his hopes that the line be finished in time for the opening of the State Fair on September 6th. Thus in September 1869, a temporary connection was made at a junction called Simpson's or Melrose at San Leandro with the old tracks of San Francisco and Alameda Railroad, which led to the SF&A; Alameda Wharf with ferry service to San Francisco. On September 6, 1869, the first Western Pacific train reached the shores of San Francisco Bay at Alameda Terminal, thus achieving the transcontinental Pacific Railroad envisioned in the 1862 Pacific Railroad Act. According to the Daily Alta California, this first through train left Sacramento at 10 am, got delayed by some construction trains, exited Niles Canyon late at 9:30 pm, and an hour later arrived at Alameda Terminal to a cheering crowd. Continuing passengers boarded the ferry Alameda and crossed the Bay to the Davis St Wharf in San Francisco. Two months later, Central Pacific Railroad switched the western transcontinental terminus to its expanded Oakland Pier, which was inaugurated on November 8, 1869, in another round of celebration. Alameda then went back to local train service only. In 1870 the SF&A; was absorbed into Central Pacific and in 1873 the original SF&A; pier was abandoned. Present day California Historical Landmark #440: NW corner of Lincoln Ave and Webster St in Alameda The railroads and their wharfs are gone from Alameda. The last rails were removed in 1960 from Lincoln Ave (formerly Railroad Ave and along which the SF&A; rails ran). The achievement of the first transcontinental railroad reaching Alameda Terminal on September 6, 1869 is marked by a plaque in the Naval Air Station Alameda and a California Historical Landmark (CHL #440) nearby. The GPS coordinates of the two markers are given respectively by 37.786779,-122.30292 (plaque); and 37.77535,-122.276891 (CHL #440). On 6 September 2019, a \\"golden spike\\" ceremony was held in Niles Canyon, where the Western Pacific tracks laid in 1866 was linked with the Central Pacific tracks laid in 1869, commemorating the 150th anniversary of the 6 September 1869 completion of the first transcontinental railroad to the Pacific coast terminus at Alameda Terminal. Also, the mayor of the City of Alameda issued a proclamation recognizing \\"the outstanding contributions of the many Chinese immigrants who helped make the Transcontinental Railroad a reality\\".

Distance-vector routing protocols in computer networks use route poisoning to indicate to other routers that a route is no longer reachable and should not be considered from their routing tables. Unlike the split horizon with poison reverse, route poisoning provides for sending updates with unreachable hop counts immediately to all the nodes in the network. When the protocol detects an invalid route, all of the routers in the network are informed that the bad route has an infinite (‚àû) route metric. This makes all nodes on the invalid route seem infinitely distant, preventing any of the routers from sending packets over the invalid route. Some distance-vector routing protocols, such as RIP, use a maximum hop count to determine how many routers the traffic must go through to reach the destination. Each route has a hop count number assigned to it which is incremented as the routing information is passed from router to router. A route is considered unreachable if the hop count exceeds the maximum allowed. Route poisoning is a method of quickly forgetting outdated routing information from other router's routing tables by changing its hop count to be unreachable (higher than the maximum number of hops allowed) and sending a routing update. In the case of RIP, the maximum hop count is 15, so to perform route poisoning on a route its hop count is changed to 16, deeming it unreachable, and a routing update is sent. If these updates are lost, some nodes in the network would not be informed that a route is invalid, so they could attempt to send packets over the bad route and cause a problem known as a routing loop. Therefore route poisoning is used in conjunction with holddowns to keep update messages from falsely reinstating the validity of a bad route. This prevents routing loops, improving the overall efficiency of the network. References * The TCP-IP Guide, RIP Special Features For Resolving RIP Algorithm Problems, by Charles M.

In 2010, the team also had the distinction to play in the Premier Basketball League (PBL) under the name Capitanes de Puerto Rico. The team began play in the league in 1946. Home games are held at Manuel Iguina Coliseum, which the team shares with the Capitanes de Arecibo men's volleyball team. The team has won seven BSN Championships (1959, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2016 and 2018) and has had a total 16 finals appearances, being a runner-up 9 times (1932, 1946, 1948, 1961, 1966, 1992, 2007, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2017). Capitanes is the only team to participate in all editions of the FIBA Americas League, having entered the final four twice (finishing 2nd in 2010 and 3rd in 2013). History =Early years= In 1946, coached by Wilfredo Franco, Tingo D√≠az, Piro M√©ndez and for a pre-Olympic tournament, the Capitanes emerged. A group of young athletes, mostly from Arecibo, like: Manuel Gilberto (Petaca) Iguina, Quic√≥n Iguina, Abdiel de la Rosa, Alberto Renta, Joaqu√≠n Balaguer, Armando Villamil, y Pipe Ben√≠quez showed themselves to be a part of it and dominated the sport in Puerto Rico, finishing in second place. On August 19, 1959, the Capitanes won their first basketball championship against the Rio Piedras Cardinals at the Rodr√≠guez Olmo Stadium in Arecibo. They were coached by Lou Rossinni, and the heroes of that series were Jaime Frontera, Francisco Pancho Padilla, Felipito Col√≥n, Bill MacCadney, Jos√© (Fufi) Santori Coll, Mois√©s Navedo, Jos√© Rodr√≠guez G√≥mez, Eddie Mart√≠nez, Jos√© V√°zquez, Jos√© Aponte, Angel Morales, Jaime Miranda, Joe Phillip Padilla hijo, Ram√≥n Siraguza, Enrique Miranda, and Sit√≠n Garc√≠a. This team is the only team in BSN history to have gone the entire season, including the playoffs, undefeated. In 1992, coached by Alfred ‚ÄúButch‚Äù Lee, the Capitanes returned to the BSN Finals with elite players Ferdinand Morales, Rafael Hernandez, Giovanni Col√≥n, Fitz Roy Brow, Juan Griles, Orlando Febres, Bryan and Mark Santiago, losing a hard-fought series against the Ponce Lions. =Restructuring= The Capitanes in 2002 wrote another page in the history of their city and the BSN when the so-called \\"kids\\" broke the predictions of the media and basketball analysts by taking a semi-final series to Game 7 with young talents Giovanni Jim√©nez, Rick Apodaca, Buster Figueroa, Pachy Cruz and David Cortes; and veterans F√©lix Javier Perez, Javier Rol√≥n and Oscar Chiaramello. In 2005, general manager Regino Babilonia hired Carlos Mario Rivera as head coach and the Captains again won the BSN Championship (4-0) over the Bayam√≥n Cowboys. In 2007, with David Rosario at the command of the Captain Ship, and the fiery players Rafael ‚ÄúPachy‚Äù Cruz, √Ångel ‚ÄúBuster‚Äù Figueroa, David Cortes, Carlos Payano and Marcus Fizer as reinforcement, the Capitanes returned to the BSN Finals. In a historic, sold- out Game 7 at the Jose Miguel Agrelot Coliseum, where 75% of the attendees were from Captain Correa City, the Arecibo Captains came back from a 20-point fourth-quarter deficit to force an overtime. In a hard-fought and emotional series of plays and calls, the Captains came up just short of another championship. During the 2008 season, the Capitanes advanced again to the finals against the Carolina Giants. The series went to seven games, with both teams winning three games at home. Arecibo won the seventh game, 99-94, for the third championship in the franchise's history. √Ångel Figueroa was selected the Finals' Most Valuable Player. =2005 Championship= It was forty-six years since the Captains succeeded in that first championship. That was on August 19, 1959. They came short in 1966 when they lost in overtime against Ponce and in a seventh game finals held at the court of Manuel Carrasquillo Herpen Country Club. In 1992 the attorney Hiram Ruiz saw the Lions come from behind in the series to thwart another major celebration in Arecibo. In 2005, there were doubts. However, unlike the team of 1959, the 2005 edition played with many ups and downs during the regular season and also in the \\"round robin\\", for example beating the best in the league but losing to last-placed teams. The reason for not dominating as expected was the failure of the team's \\"Refuerzo\\" (reinforcement player), former rebounding leader and prolific scorer, center Nick Davis, who did not meet the team and fan's expectations, as well as his following replacements until the arrival of Richard Lugo. In the \\"round robin\\" the Captains won five and lost as many games. The team was torn between changing Dickey Simpkins or staying with the player that looked more like a fifth man with the added reinforcement that was hurt. With all that were chosen as a finalist in the analyzes that the Cowboys favored above all others for having excelled in the second stage of the tournament. Unlike the 1959 champion who went undefeated, these Captains had to earn their stripes. The Captains got a breaks with the elimination of Ponce. The Lions were the best team that could match-up with the Captains and successfully handle the full-court press. The Captains then faced a remodeled Santurce, with former Nigerian NBA player Olumide Oyedeji. The series became complicated and unpredictable. It was then that Edgar Padilla appeared on the scene. Bayam√≥n could not run with Arecibo and Flor Melendez knew that he could control the tempo of the game in the first two games of this final series. Both were very close games. Despite these woes, the Vaquero fans hoped Bayamon would come back. This was dispelled as soon as Richard Lugo was able to play for the Captains in game three. After the Cowboys rallied to win game four and force a fifth game, the Captains closed out the series in game five. Larry Ayuso scored 40 points on offense and played defense well in that closing game. =2008 Championship= On June 28, 2008, Capitanes de Arecibo defeated Gigantes de Carolina in 7 games to win their third championship, Angel Luis Figueroa scored 33 points and Roberto Jose Hatton scored 20 points. √Ångel Figueroa was selected the Finals' Most Valuable Player. =2010 Championship= The reconquest of the National Superior Basketball League Championship is a fact. The Arecibo Capitanes are the new Champions of the BSN. The national title was achieved Saturday, July 3, 2010, at the Rub√©n Rodr√≠guez Coliseum in Bayam√≥n at night. Incidentally, the Capitanes became the first team in the history of the BSN, to win a seventh and deciding game as the visiting team. The final score of the game it was 73 - 62. The match had to be stopped and subsequently confiscated, because the team's fans of Bayam√≥n, began throwing objects onto the court and the game could not be terminated. We the game was stopped, there was still 1:42 on the clock, but Arecibo had absolute control of the game. It is noteworthy that this is the second Championship won by the Capitanes in the past three tournaments of the BSN. At the beginning of the meeting the atmosphere was worthy of a seventh game. Donta smith immediately began the annotations for Bayam√≥n, but Larry Ayuso did not remain with folded arms. In the first five minutes of action, Ayuso had already made three triples. Then, when the clock struck 4:48, Danilo Pinncok managed a basket that gave them the first lead in the game 13 - 12. After this move Bayam√≥n managed to take advantage on the board 19 - 17. All this so that in the next moves, Guillermo D√≠az scoring three free throws and Danny Santiago make a dunk that brought the Capitanes to dominate the first quarter 22 - 19. The start of the second period for Arecibo was very explosive. The Capitanes opened with a push of 7-0, thanks to a triple by Larry Ayuso and two consecutive baskets by Danilo Pinnock. At that time, Arecibo took off on the scoreboard 29 - 19. Incidentally, those were the first points of a rally that did Danilo Pinnock. He scored eight consecutive points for Arecibo. The Vaqueros tried to answer with some baskets of Christian Dalmau and Robert Traylor, but the Capitanes managed to close strong at the half. After twenty minutes of action the Capitanes had twelve-point advantage, 43 - 31. During that first half, Larry Ayuso and Danilo Pinnock combined to make between them, thirty-three points. Captains also dominated the rebounds 20 - 11. Also they were perfect from the free throw line. The second half began with an offensive push for the Vaqueros. They managed six points, but Guillermo D√≠az was able to answer with triple when subtracted 7:53 on the clock. To this, Danilo Pinncok added two free throws, but Bayam√≥n answered with a triple by Christian Dalmau. On the next play, Danny Santiago make a triple with 4:45 detracted. Then, Bayam√≥n answered with five straight points, but Danilo Pinncok score four straight points and David Cort√©s scored two points to keep Arecibo in front. When subtract only 45 seconds of the period, Larry Ayuso achieved another triple. Arecibo closed the quarter 62 - 50 for Arecibo. The fourth quarter began with an exchange of baskets by both, but the Capitanes knew how to answer on every possession. Larry Ayuso achieved another triple with 7:32 left and the score was 68‚Äì57 at the time. Plays later, Carmelo Lee scored a field goal by Bayam√≥n, but this was answered immediately by the Capitanes. David Cort√©s managed a shot and Danny Santiago make another. In this way Arecibo was leading 72 - 60, while still detracted 3:45 left in the game. Bayam√≥n managed to score three extra points, before they culminate the event. This was so because on the last play of the game, Danny Santiago achieved an impressive steal. After the steal, Andr√©s Rodr√≠guez gets the ball and he received a hard foul that led him to the free throw line. Before Andr√©s Rodr√≠guez could make his attempts, the fans from Bayam√≥n began a relentless rain of objects and this forced the League officials to confiscate the game in Arecibo's favor. At that time, there is still 1:42 to play, but the game was largely dominated by Arecibo 73 - 62. Thus, the Arecibo Capitanes won their fourth championship of the BSN (1959, 2005, 2008 and 2010). The best scorers for the team Bayam√≥n were: Christian Dalmau with 22 points and Carmelo Lee with 11. While for Arecibo, four players were in double figures.

Then followed by: Danilo Pinnock who scored 21 points, Daniel Santiago with 11 points and Guillermo Diaz, who had 11 points, 10 rebounds and five assists. =2011 Repeating as Champions= On August 1, 2011 Capitanes de Arecibo defeated Piratas de Quebradillas in 5 games (4-1) to win their fifth National Superior Basketball Championship. Guillermo D√≠az was chosen as the Most Valuable Player.¬°El Back to Back es un hecho! The Back to Back is a fact!

For the second time during the Final Series, the Captains came out strong in the offensive side of the court. Consecutive triples Larry Ayuso and David Cortes took off immediately to Arecibo on the scoreboard. To make matters worse, Danilo Pinnock prescribed another triple and this allowed Arecibo took off 13 by 6. Quebradillas did not remain with arms folded and responded with two straight triples David Huertas. These triples came to the Pirates 13 by 12. Seconds later, the Captains got their second run offensive night, being at this time a 9-0. After the first ten minutes of action, Arecibo was ahead on the scoreboard 24 by 18.

Players =Current roster= Premier Basketball League (2010) The PBL began its third season in 2010 with nine teams. The Capitanes were one of three expansion teams. For PBL play, the Capitanes take the name of Puerto Rico rather than their home city. The Capitanes established two different talent pools. As well as the original BSN team, they had a roster for PBL play that included selections in that league's player draft. Their subsequent first signings were Andr√©s Rodr√≠guez and Bonzi Wells. Other international players signed by the Capitanes during the off-season were El√≠as Larry Ayuso, Angelo Reyes and Walter Hodge. Antonio L√°timer and Jos√© Rosario completed the signings, while Hodge left during the season to join the Cangrejeros. Their performance earned the team constant inclusion in MLN Sports' basketball rankings, debuting in the fourth spot. During the undefeated streak, David Rosario was named PBL Coach of the Month for January. The team won its first series against the Maryland GreenHawks, with scores of 109:100 and 99:91. The Capitanes subsequently won their first contests against the Manchester Millrats (116:104) and Vermont Frost Heaves (114:103), establishing a lead in the league's standings. The Capitanes' next game was against the team that held the second place in the standing, the Lawton-Fort Sill Cavalry (3-0), winning with scores of 101:94. The team won its first contests against the Buffalo Stampede (114:89), Halifax Rainmen (108:101) and Quebec Kebs (93:86). After two weeks of inactivity, the Capitanes began a series of away games defeating the GreenHawks 111:93. On March 21, 2010 the game between the Rainmen from Halifax and the Capitanes was played after the game had been canceled due to bad weather the previous time it had been scheduled. The score was 106:94, Capitanes. =Expulsion from the PBL= In March 2010, the PBL announced that it was forced to expel the franchise due to an alleged failure to adhere to its rules & guidelines. Among the violations cited were, failing to appear at road games, failure to pay amount owed to the league, and lack of communication with league officers. At the moment, the team held the second best record in the league and had secured a spot in the playoffs. The Capitanes responded by hiring one of Puerto Rico's top litigation attorneys, Lee Sepulvado of the law firm Sepulvado & Maldonado. The team's lawyers filed a complaint seeking a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction before federal court in Puerto Rico. The PBL hired O'Neill & Borges, one of Puerto Rico's top law firms and was represented by attorney Salvador Antonetti Stutts whom attended Harvard Law School and is a former Solicitor General of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. After the attorneys conducted oral arguments before Federal Judge Juan Perez Gimenez the court entered a temporary restraining order against the PBL instructing the league to immediately reinstate the Capitanes and allow them to participate in the 2010 playoffs. Shortly thereafter the PBL agreed to the issuance of a preliminary injunction order formally reinstating the team. The matter received extensive media coverage and the PBL was forced to accept its wrongdoing by setting aside the expulsion of the team. The Capitanes vehemently denied the charges and all along insisted their only goal was to win in the basketball court and not the legal court.  International performance  =2007 FIBA Americas League= As runners-up of the 2007 BSN season, the Capitanes were selected to represent Puerto Rico in the first edition of the FIBA Americas League, along with the BSN-champion Santurce Crabbers.

A tributary of the Columbia River, the creek flows for approximately from the Thrush Pond between Eagle Butte and Tanner Butte to its mouth near Bonneville Dam. The East Fork Eagle Creek is a major tributary that begins at Wahtum Lake and joins the main stem approximately 2/3 the way between the Thrush Pond and the Columbia River, separated by Indian Mountain. Drainage basin The Eagle Creek drainage basin is the largest of any creek in the western or central Gorge. The watershed is bounded by Tanner Ridge to the west, the Benson Plateau and Chinidere Mountain to the east, and Indian Mountain and Waucoma Ridge to the south. Another major tributary is Opal Creek, flowing from Tanner Butte to just above Tenas Falls. Waterfalls Eagle creek is notable for its numerous waterfalls. From the mouth upstream, the most notable are Metlako Falls, Punch Bowl Falls, Skoonichuk Falls, Grand Union Falls, Twister Falls, and Sevenmile Falls. Noteworthy waterfalls on Eagle Creek's many tributaries include Sorenson Falls, Loowit Falls, Four Mile Falls, Tenas Falls, Wy'east Falls, and Tunnel Falls. Recreation The Eagle Creek Trail #440 on the cliffs above Eagle Creek Eagle Creek is an extremely popular recreation destination. The Eagle Creek Trail #440 runs for along the creek from the Historic Columbia River Highway State Trail to a junction with the Pacific Crest Trail near Wahtum Lake, and its lower reaches comprise one of the most popular trails in the Gorge. Multiple other trails are also present on the surrounding ridges and mountains, providing connections to the rest of the Gorge's trail network. History A bridge across Eagle Creek to carry the Oregon Portage Railroad, the first railroad in Oregon. The Eagle Creek watershed was severely impacted the Eagle Creek Fire of 2017, which started near Punch Bowl Falls after a 15-year old kid threw a firecracker into the canyon following a prolonged period without precipitation. Due to the increased risk of landslides, debris flows, and other hazards, recreation in the area remains closed .

Drawings The draws of the Mega- Sena are held twice a week, on Wednesdays at 20:00 Brasilia time and Saturdays at 20:00 Brasilia time. The Wednesday draw is televised (with a 25-minute delay) on RedeTV at 20:25 of that day. The drawings consist of picking balls from 2 spinning spherical cages. They are picked in pairs, in order to form a 2 digit decimal number from 01 to 60. The first cage has balls ranging from 0 to 5 for the first digit, and the other one Passos balls ranging from 0 to 9 to be used in the second digit. In the event of the number 00 showing up, it will be replaced by the number 60 for Meu purposes. When 6 unique 2 digit numbers are drawn, the drawing is concluded. Betting Contestants may bet in the range of 6 to 15 numbers, out of 60, and scoring 4, 5 or 6 points will grant prizes. Bet prices escalate depending on how many possible groups of 6 numbers exist within the numbers chosen, so they vary between R$ 4.50 for 6 numbers (only 1 game possible) to R$17,517.50 for 15 numbers (5005 games possible). The chances of winning the biggest prize when placing a minimum bet are 1 in 50,063,860. Contestants can choose to play a \\"Surpresinha\\" entry, which will generate their numbers randomly. They can also opt to enter these numbers for 2, 4 or 8 consecutive draws in advance and / or compete with the same bet by 2, 4 or 8 consecutive contests (‚ÄúTeimosinha‚Äù) There is also official syndicates (‚ÄúBol√£o‚Äú) by the Caixa. These syndicates allow you to create a larger bet and share it between your family and / or friends in various share amounts / fractions (‚Äúcotas‚Äù). For Mega-Sena, the minimum syndicate bet can be R$ 10.00, with the minimum share of the being R$ 4.00, and the number of participants in the syndicate can be between a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 100.How to Play Mega Sena Prizes Raw prizes correspond to 46% of raw income from bets. Out of this figure: * 35% will go to people who scored 6 numbers or, if nobody scores 6 numbers, it'll accumulate for the next drawing. * 19% will go to people who scored 5 numbers. * 19% will go to people who scored 4 numbers. * 22% will accumulate for a special drawing occurring once every 5 times. * 5% will accumulate for Mega Da Virada, the special New Years drawing (see below Income tax will deduct 13.8% from all the previous items. The net value for prizes is actually 32.2% of lottery earnings. Winners have 90 days to claim their prizes. Prizes below R$800 can be claimed at a lottery house. Prizes above R$800 must be claimed at the Caixa Econ√¥mica Federal bank. If the 90-day period expires, prize money is transferred to the national treasury and invested in educational programs. Beneficiaries The other 54% of lottery income is spent on costs and then redistributed to several social programmes. Mega da Virada A special drawing called Mega da Virada is held on New Year's Eve every year. The drawing is extremely popular among Brazilians because of its large jackpot. Regular Mega-Sena draws throughout the year put aside 5% of the proceeds for Mega da Virada. Record Mega da Virada jackpot is the 306,7 million jackpot from 2018 drawing. Unlike a regular draw, the Mega da Virada jackpot doesn't accumulate even if nobody scores 6 numbers. It instead goes to people who scored 5 numbers.

Examples =Ott√≥ Bl√°thy= A particularly extreme example by Ott√≥ Bl√°thy is illustrated in the adjacent diagram. In the initial position Black has all sixteen pieces remaining and White has just a single pawn on its starting square, yet it is White who will deliver checkmate. This position in Forsyth- Edwards Notation (FEN) is : 8/8/8/2p5/1pp5/brpp4/qpprpK1P/1nkbn3 w - - 0 1 The solution is: :1. Kxe1 Qa1 2. h3 Qa2 3. h4 Qa1 4. h5 Qa2 5. h6 Qa1 6. h7 Qa2 7. h8=N Qa1 8. Nf7 Qa2 9. Nd8 Qa1 10. Ne6 Qa2 11. Nxc5 Qa1 12. Ne4 Qa2 13. Nd6 Qa1 14. Nxc4 Qa2 15. Na5 Qa1 16. Nxb3 The fact that the black queen must be on a1 rather than a2 when White plays Nxb3 explains why 2.h4 does not work. Similarly, if the white knight takes a more direct route to the b3 square with 8.Ng6 Qa2 9.Ne5 Qa1 10.Nxc4? Qa2 11.Na5, Black can lose a move with 11...c4! 12.Nxc4 Qa1 13.Na5 Qa2 and there is no mate. This kind of precise timing is quite a common feature in this type of problem. =Tigran Gorgiev= The composer most closely associated with the grotesque is probably Tigran Gorgiev; here is one of his examples. This position in Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) is : 8/8/4N3/4Q3/1pp5/1p3N2/bpqp1p2/nrkrbK2 w - - 0 1 This time, White is to play and draw. This is achieved by sacrificing most of his already small force to compel Black to repeat moves: :1. Nf4 Qd3+ Otherwise 2.Ne2+ leads to mate. :2. Nxd3+ cxd3 3. Qc3+ bxc3 4. Ne5 Kc2 5. Nc4 Kc1 6. Ne5 and Black has nothing more than a draw by repetition. Note that only the squares c4 and e5 will do for the white knight; if, for example, 4.Nd4 then 4...Nc2 allows Black to free himself (this is not possible with the knight on e5 because of Nxd3#); and if, for example, 5.Nc6 then Black can free himself with 5...Rbc1 or 5...Rdc1 (not possible with the knight on c4 because of Na3# and Ne3# respectively). Moremover Similar play to that found in grotesques such as these may also be found in very long moremovers (problems with the stipulation \\"White to play and checkmate Black in no more than n moves\\", where n is very high, sometimes over 100, known as longmovers), of which Ott√≥ Bl√°thy was also a notable composer. To the right is a kind of problem quite closely related to these kinds of grotesques: this time it is White who has a clear material advantage, but it is difficult to make anything of it because of the locked pawn chain. This position in Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) is : 8/8/8/1k3p2/p1p1pPp1/PpPpP1Pp/1P1P3P/QNK2NRR w - - 0 1 At first glance it seems there is nothing to be done‚Äîon moves like Rg2, White cannot make progress unless Black captures‚Äîbut White does have one plan: to play Qa2 at an appropriate moment in order to threaten Qxb3. Doing this immediately does not work (Black simply promotes on a1 and it is Black who wins by ...Qa2‚Äìb3‚Äìc2 mate), but there is a way: :1. Kd1 Kb6 2. Ke1 Kb5 3. Rg2 Kb6 4. Re2 Kb5 5. Kf2 Kb6 6. Re1 Kb5 7. Rg1 Kb6 8. Rg2 Kb5 9. Rc1 Kb6 10. Ke1 Kb5 11. Re2 Kb6 12. Kd1 Kb5 13. Re1 Kb6 14. Rc2 Kb5 15. Kc1 Kb6 16. Qa2!! bxa2 17. b4! a1=Q 18. Rb2 Kb5 19. Rd1 Ka6 20. b5+ Kb6 21. Re1 Ka7 22. b6+ Kb7 23. Rd1 and Black must either give up his queen or allow the b-pawn to promote.

There she would become chairman of the Theory and Composition Department. She remained at the University of Alberta until her retirement. Her notable students include Larry Austin, Jan Randall, Allan Gilliland, and Allan Gordon Bell.  Musical career  Archer built a career as a musician and composer in addition to her teaching. She played percussion with the Montreal Women's Symphony Orchestra from 1940 to 1947, a time period when major municipal orchestras were not admitting women to their ranks. In addition to percussion, Archer played clarinet and strings, and worked in Montr√©al as an accompanist and organist. As a composer, Archer's prolific work of more than 330 compositions included traditional and more contemporary works for instrument and voice. Examples of her wide-ranging work include a 1973 comic opera, Sganarelle, the film score for a 1976 documentary, Someone Cares, and experimentations with electronic music.

The game simulates the World War II Battle of Midway and is primarily designed for two players. The onus of gameplay rests on the Japanese player who must attempt to bring forces to bear upon Midway Island. The United States player, though possessing a smaller force, has no such geographical constraints placed on his naval forces. Components =Search Boards= The bulk of the game is played out on duplicate boards, one per player, with full knowledge of friendly forces but limited knowledge of the opponent's. Knowledge of opposing forces is gained by air and sea reconnaissance. Unlike the 1964 version, the search boards use hexagonal spaces to remove questions of corner adjacency. =Battle Boards= Air- surface and surface-surface battles are held on boards representing a small patch of open ocean. Unit deployments are made at the start of each battle. =Counters= Double-sided cardboard counters with dimensions between 1/2\\" and 3/4\\" represent combat aircraft squadrons, aerial reconnaissance squadrons, capital ships, and surface escort squadrons. Additional counters are used for record keeping, particularly damage and suspected enemy locations. Gameplay =Aircraft Availability= At most, aircraft are available every other turn. After completing a mission, they must spend one turn refuelling and rearming before they can be used again. However, aircraft being fuelled on an aircraft carrier pose an extreme fire hazard if the carrier is attacked, a vulnerability reflected by the rules. =Search= While not required, aerial reconnaissance is usually necessary for victory. Dedicated reconnaissance squadrons (and combat squadrons, if necessary) fly circuitous routes across the search board. The controlling player may ask his opponent if ships are present in any space flown over. However, asking about every space flown over tends to reveal to the opponent where the plane originated from. Once ships are encountered, the controlling player may elect to spend extra fuel to refine the search results. Depending on success, the opponent may report simply that \\"ships are present\\", that \\"[up to double the actual number of ships] are present\\", or potentially an exact number of ships by class are present. =Battle= Readied combat air units may be dispatched against any target in range, even if no information beyond \\"ships are present\\" is known. At the start of a battle, the opponent's true force is revealed; however, the attacker may not elect to bring reinforcements or flee with his current force. Game mechanics encourage historic tactics such as fighter cover and multiple- direction assaults. Units may sustain six levels of damage before destruction; however, damage can occur at rates beyond one level of damage per attack. =Multiplayer= While designed primarily for two players, Midway is an excellent candidate for an umpired multiplayer game. For example, a four- player game might divide the United States forces into the historical Task Forces 16 and 17 while the Japanese forces could separate between the carrier group and the surface invasion force. In these games, the individual search boards are complete only for the forces under an individual player's control. Communication between allied players is limited (and subject to interception) and possibilities for confusion of friendly and opposing forces exist. The umpire serves to mediate all exchange of information and conduct all dice rolls in such games.

The dell was carved by a creek that includes two fairly substantial tumbling waterfalls. Due to the topography of the area, it is difficult to photograph the falls. As such, the bridge is what is normally pictured, and thus is arguably better known than the dell itself. The spelling of the dell's name tends to vary depending on the source. The official Oregon State Park site spells it with the apostrophe,http://www.oregonstateparks.org/park_168.php however the GNIS entry omits the apostrophe.

Early life and education Donoghue was born and raised in Washington, D.C., the second of four brothers born to Irish immigrant parents, Daniel and Rose (n√©e Ryan) Donoghue. On June 4, 1955, after receiving a Bachelor's Degree in Philosophy and a graduate degree in Sacred Theology from St. Mary's Seminary and University in Baltimore, Maryland and Roland Park, Maryland, and after ordination to the transitional diaconate, he was ordained to the priesthood for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington, by the then-Archbishop of Washington, Patrick O'Boyle, who was later a Cardinal. Service within the Church While originally planning to remain a parish priest, Donoghue was asked in 1964 to study for a Licentiate in Canon Law, and was then assigned to the Archbishop of Washington's Office (he did serve in a variety of parish assignments). For the next 18 years, he served on the staff under three successive Cardinals, all now deceased, who were Archbishops of Washington: Cardinals Patrick O'Boyle, William Wakefield Baum, and James Aloysius Hickey. From 1972 until 1983, he also filled the offices of Chancellor and Vicar General for that Archdiocese; in 1984 he also became Moderator of the Archdiocesan Curia, serving in that capacity until his episcopal consecration. He was consecrated and installed as a Bishop on December 18, 1984, following his appointment by Pope John Paul II, as the second Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Charlotte. In June 1993, he was appointed as the sixth Metropolitan Archbishop of Atlanta, Georgia by John Paul II, replacing the Most Reverend James P. Lyke, O.F.M., who had died of cancer on December 27, 1992, after only two years in office. He led the Archdiocese for over ten years. Donoghue retired as Archbishop on December 9, 2004, and was succeeded by Wilton D. Gregory, who had served as an Auxiliary Bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago. Death Donoghue died, on November 11, 2011, aged 83. His body lay in state at the Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Jesus until his Funeral Mass at 11:00 AM on November 17 at the Cathedral of Christ the King.

He played collegiately for Austin Peay State University and was named 1997 Ohio Valley Conference Player of the Year. Selected 34th by the Mavs in the 1997 NBA draft, the little-used small forward's NBA career was short-lived, consisting of just 39 games of the 1997‚Äì98 season. However, he did start two games in March 1998, in place of the injured Cedric Ceballos. His brief NBA career did feature one memorable game where he set the record for the shortest amount of playing time (less than 3 minutes) before fouling out, as part of a failed strategy to intentionally foul Dennis Rodman (a notoriously bad free throw shooter) to limit his scoring. His NBA career came to an abrupt end in 1998, after he was traded to the Phoenix Suns along with Martin M√º√ºrsepp, the draft rights to Pat Garrity, and a future first-round draft pick in exchange for point guard Steve Nash. Wells never played a game for the Suns. He was later traded to the Chicago Bulls, also for whom he never played. He later played for the LaCrosse Bobcats of the CBA, the Oklahoma Storm of USBL, the Memphis Houn'Dawgs of the ABA, and overseas in Greece and the Philippines. He played for the Harlem Globetrotters in 2004‚Äì05. From June 2005 through May 2015, Wells was an assistant men's basketball coach at Austin Peay. On May 28, 2015, his appointment to the staff of Jon Harris at SIU Edwardsville was announced. Trivia Bubba Wells holds the dubious distinction of being the player with the quickest disqualification due to personal fouls in an NBA regular season game. Wells fouled out in just three minutes. In a December 29, 1997 game against the Chicago Bulls, then-Mavericks coach Don Nelson employed a desperate tactic to limit the Bulls' offense. He inserted Wells into the game with the express purpose of fouling power forward Dennis Rodman, a notoriously poor free throw shooter, away from the ball. The plan failed, however, when Rodman hit 9-of-12 free throws and Chicago went on to win the game 111‚Äì105. Wells fouled out late in the third quarter after registering his sixth personal foul in a total of three minutes' playing time.Bubba Update , Austin Peay State University website, Fall 1998 This strategy of intentionally fouling a bad free throw shooter is sometimes called Hack-a-Shaq, since it was later famously used against Shaquille O'Neal. The previous record-holder was Dick Farley of the Syracuse Nationals who was disqualified in five minutes on March 12, 1956. Personal In August 2007, Wells married Tracee Jones, the former head women's basketball coach at Tennessee State University. The previous summer Wells served as a supporter to Jones on NBC TV game show, Deal or No Deal. Wells has a daughter, Alyiah, and a son, Chase.

One of the best-known landmarks of Edmonton, the conservatory consists of three city-operated greenhouses, public gardens, as well as four feature pyramids for display of plant species found across three biomes, with the fourth pyramid hosting a seasonal display. A fifth minor skylight pyramid lights up the central foyer. A donation from the Gladys and Merrill Muttart Foundation provided momentum for the conservatory's construction, with the remaining funding supplied by the Province of Alberta and the City of Edmonton. The conservatory is staffed and operated by the Edmonton Parks and Recreation Department. Architecture The conservatory's unusual structure, designed by architect Peter Hemingway, is composed of four glassed pyramids built around a central service core. The two larger pyramids are in area, and the two medium-sized ones are in size. Three of the pyramids are devoted to displays of plants from the tropical, temperate, and arid regions respectively, the fourth being used for shows that change with the seasons and which feature massed displays of ornamental flowering plants. Plants and shrubs of tropics inside of Muttart Conservatory Biomes The Temperate pyramid houses plants typical of temperate climates, from such zones as the southern Great Lakes, Australia, and even the mountainous areas of Asia. Near the entrance and fed by a stream is a bog area, with white water lilies and parrot's feather. The bog merges into a woodland with mostly eastern deciduous trees and low shrubs but including redwoods, cedars and pampas grass. Eucalyptus trees and flowering shrubs complement the Australian section. In the woodland floor and alpine section are many tiny flowering plants, some native to Alberta and others from all over the world. Carefully controlled environmental conditions allow the plants to go dormant in winter and burst into spring growth of green leaves and colourful blooms. The plants from the Arid pyramid come from hot and cold dry areas spanning five continents. They share an ability to thrive in environments with dry air, irregular moisture and wide day/night temperature fluctuations. In spring 2013, the Arid Pyramid featured an Agave Americana plant bloom which reached a height of 30 feet before reaching the top of the pyramid. This plant was planted a year after the Muttart Conservatory first opened. The Tropical pyramid provides an enormous diversity of species; under a canopy of tall palms, banana and weeping fig are orchids, various hibiscus and the bird of paradise. The plants come from tropical rainforests, evergreen forests or grasslands, and are often showy and bright. A waterfall cascades into the centre of the pyramid where small fish and water lilies make their home. This pyramid has also been home in the past to a kiwi bird and a sloth. On March 11, 2013, the bud to an imported Amorphophallus titanum plant (commonly known as the corpse flower) budded and bloomed here on April 22. The Feature pyramid offers seasonal displays that change several times per year, focusing on themed displays and seasonal celebrations. Other amenities at the facility are an outdoor gazebo, gift shop, and the Culina Muttart Caf√©. The caf√© serves several menu items made with locally-sourced ingredients, including herbs and salad greens grown on-site at the greenhouse. The facility, owned and operated by the City of Edmonton, is also a popular site for special events, such as weddings. The conservatory underwent a $6.3 million renovation that was completed in June 2009.

WTIX-FM is an oldies outlet serving the New Orleans area. The station is owned by Michael A. \\"Michael In The Morning\\" Costello (under the name Fleur de Lis Broadcasting) and operates at 94.3 MHz with an ERP of 100 kW. Its city of license is Galliano, Louisiana. Its studios are in Metairie and its transmitter is in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana. History Costello was program director at WRNO-FM from 1976 to 1991 and also hosted the morning show as \\"Michael In The Morning\\" (M&M;). Additionally, he hosted the Sunday night edition of The Rock 'N'Roll Hall Of Fame. He then acquired the former KLEB-FM from the Harold Callais family which was a country music outlet in 1995 and flipped it to its current oldies format. The station is modeled after the original Top 40 AM station WTIX, which was a very successful Top 40 outlet in New Orleans from the 1950s through the 1970s. He increased the transmitted power and moved the antenna from its original location to its present location in 1998 to better serve the New Orleans metro area. Mike Costello also handles GM, PD, and also hosts the morning show. Many of the jingles used on WTIX-FM are the originals used by WTIX/690 in the 1960s and 1970s. WTIX-FM also adapts a time-honored feature from the old WTIX: the \\"Chime Time\\", wherein a chime rang whenever jocks gave the time on the air. (Coincidentally, \\"Chime Time\\" was also the staple of Musicradio WABC in its heyday.) WTIX-FM's format, Oldies, is patterned after half of WTIX's late-1980s hybrid Talk/Oldies format (before the latter switched to All-Talk in 1988). Three of the WTIX-FM disc jockeys, \\"Hot\\" Rod Glenn, Bobby Reno, and Terry Knight, also had very minor and short-term ties to the original WTIX. Terry Knight left the station several years ago.

The Pinan kata originated in Okinawa and were adapted by Anko Itosu from older kata such as Kusanku and Channan into forms suitable for teaching karate to young students. When Gichin Funakoshi brought karate to Japan, he renamed the kata to Heian, which is translated as \\"peaceful and safe\\". Pinan is the Chinese Pinyin notation of Âπ≥ÂÆâ, which means also \\"peaceful and safe\\". Korean Tang Soo Do, one of 5 original kwan of Korea, but not taekwondo), also practice these kata; they are termed, \\"Pyong-an\\" or \\"Pyung-Ahn\\", which is a Korean pronunciation of the term \\"ping-an\\". History The Pinan kata were introduced into the school systems on Okinawa in 1895, and were subsequently adopted by many teachers and schools in the 1900s. Thus, they are present today in the curriculum of Shit≈ç-ry≈´, Wad≈ç-ry≈´, Sh≈çrin-ry≈´, Kobayashi-ry≈´, Kyokushin, Seido Juku, Shinki-Ryu, Sh≈çrei-ry≈´, Shotokan, Matsubayashi-ry≈´, Shukokai, Shindo Jinen Ryu, Kosho-ry≈´ Kempo, Kenyu Ryu, Kushin Ryu and several other styles. One of the stories surrounding the history of the Pingan kata claims that Itosu learned a kata from a Chinese man living in Okinawa. This kata was called \\"Chiang Nan\\" by the Chinese man. The form became known as \\"Channan\\", an Okinawan/Japanese approximation of the Chinese pronunciation. The original form of the Channan kata is lost. Itosu formed 5 katas from the long Channan Kata which he thought would be easier to learn. Funakoshi modified the Pinan forms on Heian forms, introducing his version of Kushanku (actually renamed Kanku Dai). The 5 kata were Pinans Shodan, Nidan, Sandan, Yondan, and Godan. Current practice The Pinans are taught to various beginner ranks according to their difficulty. The kata are all loosely based on an I-shaped embusen or shape. These kata serve as the foundation to many of the advanced kata within Karate, as many of the techniques contained in these kata are contained in the higher grade katas as well, especially Kusanku. In certain styles, Pinan Shodan and Pinan Nidan are inverted - what certain styles call Pinan Shodan is what others call Heian Nidan, and vice versa. For example, the kata Shotokan calls Heian Shodan, other styles, such as Shit≈ç-ry≈´ call Pinan Nidan. Another point to note is that Sh≈´k≈çkai teaches Pinan Nidan first, and Pinan Shodan second, believing Pinan Nidan to be the easier, more beginner-friendly kata. The order that is learnt in Wado-Ryu goes as follows, #Pinan Nidan, #Pinan Shodan, #Pinan Sandan, #Pinan Yondan and #Pinan Godan. In some Shito-Ryu dojos the order is different, as most Shito Ryu versions of Pinan Shodan are harder than the rest, so the order is as follows, #Pinan Nidan #Pinan Sandan #Pinan Yondan #Pinan Godan #Pinan Shodan See also * Karate kata * Kata * Taikyoku - The simplified versions of the pinan/heian kata.

The three races involved are the Caulfield Cup, Cox Plate and Melbourne Cup which is held on the first Tuesday of each November. There is no official Triple Crown for these Melbourne races, but racing fans consider these three Group 1 races to be the major interconnected component of the spring carnival package, while also acknowledging that only a superhorse could win them all in the same season to complete a grand slam. Only one horse has ever managed this feat, the great New Zealand galloper Rising Fast, in 1954. More recently, popular Might and Power won all three races, though not in the same year. The \\"Spring Grand Slam\\" in Melbourne is considered by some in the racing industry to be more difficult to win than the famous Triple Crown in the United States because the Australian races contain many more variables. The Triple Crown -- involving the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes -- is contested only by three-year-olds who race over distances between 1910 metres (Preakness) and 2400 metres (Belmont). The horses all carry the same weight (fillies a little less than colts and geldings), and none of the horses are being asked to race around the track in an unaccustomed direction. In Melbourne, the races are open to all horses aged three and over, and they race between 2,040 metres (Cox Plate) and 3,200 metres (Melbourne Cup). The weight carried by horses can vary immensely, both in each race and from race to race, because three different handicapping systems are employed.

The name comes from the total number of months' interest that is being calculated in a year (the first month is 1 month's interest, whereas the second month contains 2 months' interest, etc.). This is an accurate interest model only based on the assumption that the borrower pays only the amount due each month. If the borrower pays off the loan early, this method maximizes the amount paid (interest paid) by applying funds to interest before principal. In other words, in comparison to a simple interest loan, a rule of 78s loan will charge more interest if the loan is paid early.http://www.nortridge.com/blog/simple- interest-vs-rule-of-78s-math.shtml A simple fraction (as with 12/78) consists of a numerator (the top number, 12 in the example) and a denominator (the bottom number, 78 in the example). The denominator of a Rule of 78 loan is the sum of the digits, the sum of the number of monthly payments in the loan. For a twelve-month loan, the sum of numbers from 1 to 12 is 78 (1 + 2 + 3 + . . . +12 = 78). For a 24-month loan, the denominator is 300. The sum of the numbers from 1 to n is given by the equation n * (n+1) / 2. If n were 24, the sum of the numbers from 1 to 24 is 24 * (24+1) / 2 = 12 x 25 = 300, which is the loan's denominator, D. For a 12-month loan, 12/78s of the finance charge is assessed as the first month's portion of the finance charge, 11/78s of the finance charge is assessed as the second month's portion of the finance charge and so on until the 12th month at which time 1/78s of the finance charge is assessed as that month's portion of the finance charge. Following the same pattern, 24/300 of the finance charge is assessed as the first month's portion of a 24-month precomputed loan. Formula for calculating the earned interest at payment n: Earned Interest(n) = f \\\\times \\\\frac{2 (k-n+1)}{k (k+1)} where f is the total agreed finance charges, k is the length of the loan n is current payment number. Formula for calculating the cumulative earned interest at payment n: Cumulative Earned Interest(n) = f \\\\times \\\\frac{n (2k-n+1)}{k (k+1)} where f is the total agreed finance charges, k is the length of the loan n is current payment number. History The earliest official use of the Rule of 78s to calculate the unearned portion of a loan's finance charge was in Indiana in 1935. Most loans in 1935 were for small amounts at low interest rates for short periods of time. It reduced the cost of loan calculations in a pre-computer era and was well suited for the small, short, and low interest rate loans of the era. In the United States, the use of the Rule of 78s is prohibited in connection with mortgage refinancings and other consumer loans having a term exceeding 61 months.15 U.S.C. ¬ß 1615 On March 15, 2001, in the U.S. 107th Congress, U.S. Rep. John LaFalce (D-NY 29), introduced H.R. 1054,H.R. 1054, 107th Cong., A Bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act to expand protections for consumers by adjusting statutory exemptions and civil penalties to reflect inflation, to eliminate the Rule of 78s accounting for interest rebates in consumer credit transactions, and for other purposes a bill to eliminate the use of the Rule of 78s in credit transactions. The bill was referred to the House Committee on Financial Services on the same day.Search Results - THOMAS (Library of Congress) On April 10, 2001, the bill was referred to the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit, where it died with no further action taken. In the UK, as part of the Consumer Credit Act of 2005, the Consumer Credit (Early Settlement) Regulations 2004 (SI 2004/1483) http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2004/1483/regulation/4/made which does away with the Rule of 78 in consumer credit lending was issued and brought into effect on 31 May 2005.https://www.newlawjournal.co.uk/content/unfair-windfalls Precomputed Loan The Rule of 78s deals with precomputed loans, which are loans whose finance charge is calculated before the loan is made. Finance charge, carrying charges, interest costs, or whatever the cost of the loan may be called, can be calculated with simple interest equations, add-on interest, an agreed upon fee, or any disclosed method. Once the finance charge has been identified, the Rule of 78s is used to calculate the amount of the finance charge to be rebated (forgiven) in the event that the loan is repaid early, prior to the agreed upon number of payments. It should be understood that with precomputed loans, a borrower not only owes the lender the principal amount borrowed, but the borrower owes the finance charge as well. If $10,000 is lent and the precomputed finance charge is $3,000, the borrower owes the lender $13,000 at the time the loan is made, whereas a simple interest borrower owes the lender only the $10,000 principal and monthly interest on the unpaid principal. A simple explanation would be as follows: suppose that the total finance charge for a 12-month loan was $78.00. That figure is representative of the sum of digits by adding the numbers together, i.e., 12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 = 78. If a person repaid a consumer loan after 3 months, the financial institution would refund the sum of the \\"remaining\\" digits....(i.e. 9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 or $45.00. In essence, they would retain the first three (3) numbers...12,11,10 or $33.00. Thus the consumer would not receive as much of a refund if it were divided equally by 12 months ($6.50 per month). Under this scenario they would have received a refund of $58.50, which is more beneficial than the $45.00 refund.

It was originally released in June 1983, on the label Bellaphon, and is the two-year follow-up to his 1981 album Stop and Smell the Roses. The title is a play on new wave music.  Background and recording  After John Lennon's murder in December 1980, Starr returned home to England to live at Tittenhurst Park, which Starr had purchased from Lennon in 1973. In early 1982, Starr was eager to move on to his next solo project. Deciding that he needed more consistency this time around, he would work with only one producer, Joe Walsh, a former member of the recently disbanded Eagles. Walsh and Starr had known each other since the mid-1970s, having met and befriended each other in Los Angeles. Walsh immediately agreed to work with Starr and they met at Tittenhurst in February to begin writing material. Recording shortly afterwards begun and instrumental backing tracks for seven songs were recorded at Startling Studios, after Starr had previously converted Lennon's recording studio. Engineering duties were handled by Jim Nipor. These sessions were mainly done with a team consisting of Starr on drums and percussion, Walsh on guitar and backing vocals, Mo Foster on bass and keyboardists Gary Brooker and Chris Stainton. Sessions came to a halt when Walsh and Nipor went to California on 19 March. Sessions recommenced on 6 April for a few days until 16 April. On 15 April, Rolling Stone broke the news that Starr was \\"in London working on a new album with Joe Walsh acting as the producer.\\" Lead vocals were laid down from 19 to 23 April. Sometime in May, Starr requested permission to build a new building on his Tittenhurst Park land, which he would use for video and recording purposes, from Windsor and Maidenhead District Council. Sessions resumed from 31 May until 10 June; the next day, taking the masters recorded up to that point with him, Starr and his wife Barbara Bach flew from London to Los Angeles, and return on 14 June. The album was finished with a third batch of sessions from 24 June into early July. \\"Everybody's in a Hurry But Me\\" came about from a jam session between the Who's former bassist, John Entwistle, drummer and percussionist Ray Cooper and also Cream's former guitarist, Eric Clapton. \\"As Far as We Can Go\\", was originally recorded at Sweet Silence Studios, in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 23 July 1978. From that original rendition, only the vocal was used. Walsh re- recorded an entirely new track utilizing one of the latest technology synthesizers.  Release and aftermath  The album was originally titled It Beats Sleep. The portrait on the album cover was shot in a booth in northern England. As Starr's RCA contract had been cancelled, he needed to find a new label for Old Wave. Though it was just over a decade after the Beatles' dissolution, no major UK or US record company was interested in signing him. Starr would not accept that and was determined to have Old Wave released any way he could. The album was due to be released on the Boardwalk label, but never appeared due to the death of the label's head, Neil Bogart. RCA Canada ended up distributing the album in June 1983 in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, the Netherlands, Mexico, and Brazil; while in Germany, the album and lone single pulled from it, both released on 16 June, appeared on the Bellaphon label. The Canadian release of the album occurred on 24 June. However, Old Wave failed to achieve success in any of these territories, and would be Starr's last studio album until 1992's Time Takes Time. Two singles were pulled from the album: one in Germany, \\"In My Car\\", backed with \\"As Far as We Can Go\\", and the other in Mexico (\\"I Keep Forgettin'\\" b/w \\"She's About a Mover\\"). Walsh's 1987 album Got Any Gum? included a cover of \\"In My Car\\", which was released as a single and became a moderate hit. Four tracks from the album appear on Starr's US compilation Starr Struck: Best of Ringo Starr, Vol. 2 in 1989. The album was reissued on CD, on the same day as Stop and Smell the Roses (1981), in the US by The Right Stuff on 22 August 1994. A further release, on 6 September, as both CD and cassette deluxe editions, included a bonus track, the original 1978 version of \\"As Far as We Can Go\\". \\"In My Car\\" was re-released, this time on yellow vinyl, with \\"She's About a Mover\\" as the B-side, on The Right Stuff on 1 November 1994.

Many large websites run on clustered hosting solutions, for example, large discussion forums will tend to run using multiple front-end webservers with multiple back-end database servers. Typically, most hosting infrastructures are based on the paradigm of using a single physical machine to host multiple hosted services, including web, database, email, FTP and others. A single physical machine is not only a single point of failure, but also has finite capacity for traffic, that in practice can be troublesome for a busy website or for a website that is experiencing transient bursts in traffic. By clustering services across multiple hardware machines and using load balancing, single points of failure can be eliminated, increasing availability of a website and other web services beyond that of ordinary single server hosting. A single server can require periodic reboots for software upgrades and the like, whereas in a clustered platform you can stagger the restarts such that the service is still available whilst still upgrading all necessary machines in the cluster. Clustered hosting is similar to cloud hosting, in that the resources of many machines are available for a website to utilize on demand, making scalability a large advantage to a clustered hosting solution.

This was the third time that Canada has hosted the International AIDS Conference, after Montreal in 1989 and Vancouver in 1996. The main venue for the conference was the Metro Toronto Convention Centre (MTCC) in downtown Toronto. One of the entrances to the Metro Toronto Convention Centre during AIDS 2006 Front Street, just outside the conference centre. The conference theme was Time to Deliver. The conference was focused on the promises and progress made to scale-up treatment, care and prevention. In particular: *Accelerating research to end the epidemic *Expanding and sustaining human resources to scale-up treatment and prevention *Intensifying the involvement of affected communities *Building new leadership to advance the response Activities included cultural, youth and outreach programmes as well as a Global Village, which served as an international gathering place with displays of culture, food, community, and a marketplace. Events open to delegates and the public included The International AIDS Vigil, a public memorial to all those who have died of HIV/AIDS. The Vigil took place on at 9 pm on 17 August at Yonge-Dundas Square, Toronto. Well-known attendees and speakers included Governor General Micha√´lle Jean, Stephen Lewis (the United Nations special envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa), Bill and Melinda Gates (for the Gates Foundation), Richard Gere, Alicia Keys, and Bill Clinton. Harper controversy Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who decided not to attend the conference, was criticized by Conference co-chairman Dr. Mark Wainberg in his speech, saying, \\"We are dismayed that the prime minister of Canada, Mr. Stephen Harper, is not here this evening...The role of prime minister includes the responsibility to show leadership on the world stage. Your absence sends the message that you do not consider HIV/AIDS as a critical priority, and clearly all of us here disagree with you\\". Canadian Minister of Health Tony Clement attended in Harper's place. Harper's absence from the conference is the second time the Canadian head of government has decided not to attend the conference. In 1996, former Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien did not attend the conference. Asylum seekers controversy A second controversy, that followed Mr. Stephen Harper's choice to not attend, was the fact that 151 delegates who were in attendance refused to return to their home countries ‚Äì instead opting to seek asylum in Canada. This development seriously hurt the credibility of the conference and many suggested that the Prime Minister's office may have been justified in its decision to not have Mr. Harper in attendance.

The highway travels northeast from U.S. Route 101 (US 101) south of Cosmopolis to an interchange with US 12 in Montesano. SR 107 was created during the 1964 highway renumbering as the successor to a branch of Primary State Highway 9 (PSH 9), established earlier in 1937. Route description SR 107 begins at an intersection with US 101 in rural Grays Harbor County between Cosmopolis and Raymond. The highway travels north along the Little North River and east along the Chehalis River through the communities of Preachers Slough and Melbourne. SR 107 turns north in South Montesano and crosses the Chehalis River into the city of Montesano before the designation ends at a diamond interchange with US 12, while the roadway continues north as Main Street into the city. Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that between 2,300 and 5,800 vehicles per day used the highway, mostly in the Montesano area. History PSH 9 was created with the primary and secondary state highways in 1937, including a branch that connects the main highway and US 410 in Montesano to US 101 and PSH 14 near Artic. The current truss bridge over the Chehalis River between South Montesano and Montesano was built in the 1950s alongside two other bridges in the area by the Department of Highways. SR 107 was established during the 1964 highway renumbering to replace the PSH 9 branch and was codified in 1970. The new highway was truncated to its current terminus, a diamond interchange with US 12, after Montesano was bypassed by US 12 in 1967. The highway is closed occasionally by seasonal flooding, most recently in 1994 and 2008.

History =Early Years= On September 8, 1970, the station signed on the air as WVSL-FM in Slidell, Louisiana.Broadcasting Yearbook 1972 page B-92 It was owned by Bill Garrett Broadcasting, which also owned AM 1560 WBGS. The station switched formats in 1981 to Rhythmic Contemporary as WAIL 105. The station was acquired in 1974 by Phase Two Broadcasting, which changed the call sign to WLTS, with a soft adult contemporary sound.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1992 page A-153 Lite 105 spent 16 years in this format, although over time, the tempo did pick up from its original soft AC sound. In 1999, the station was acquired by Entercom, its current owner.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2003-2004 page D-206 The city of license was changed from Slidell to Kenner, where Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport is located. It switched to a Hot Adult Contemporary format as WKZN \\"105.3 The Zone.\\" =Switch to WWL Simulcast= On August 29, 2005, the station's transmitter was severely damaged during Hurricane Katrina, knocking it off the air. It returned to broadcasting with low power as a temporary simulcast of co-owned WWL 870. Other FM stations in New Orleans suspended their music formats during the storm's aftermath to rebroadcast news from local TV stations. In early October 2005, Entercom decided to switch two of its New Orleans FM station dial positions. 95.7 WTKL and WKBU Bayou 105.3 switched frequencies. The 105.3 frequency became WTKL with a classic hits format and the \\"Kool\\" name, formerly \\"Kool 95.7.\\" Only three weeks later, it was decided by Entercom to scrap the classic hits format and return 105.3 to the WWL simulcast. Entercom cited positive listener response to WWL being heard on FM and complaints about its removal from the FM dial. Some listeners said they wanted WWL programming to remain on FM due to issues receiving the AM station in the New Orleans Central Business District. The \\"Kool 105.3\\" format continued as an Internet-only webcast for a short time it was discontinued on FM. With 105.3 simulcasting WWL, Entercom asked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to switch the call letters to WWL-FM. Sister station 101.9 WLMG was the original home of the WWL-FM call sign, from 1970 to 1980, airing beautiful music at first, and then Top 40 hits.

Background Elizabeth I succeeded her half-sister Mary I as queen of England in 1558. Elizabeth's accession was disputed due to the questioned legitimacy of the marriage of her parents (Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn), and Elizabeth's own questioned legitimacy due to the Act of Succession 1536. Under Henry VIII and his advisor Thomas Cromwell, power was gradually shifted from regional institutions to royal control. This course was encouraged by Elizabeth's counsellors such as William Cecil and a policy of centralization was the approach favoured by Elizabeth herself at least in regards to the northern border region. Opponents of Elizabeth looked to Mary, Queen of Scots, the descendant of Henry VIII's sister Margaret. The claims were initially put forward by Mary's father-in-law, King Henry II of France, and Mary upheld them after her return to Scotland in 1561. Many English Catholics, then a significant portion of the population, supported Mary's claim as a way to restore Roman Catholicism. This position was especially strong in Northern England, where several powerful nobles were Roman Catholics; there had been similar risings against Henry VIII; the Pilgrimage of Grace of 1536 and Bigod's Rebellion of 1537. Supporters of Mary hoped for aid from France (among Scots) and possibly Spain (among English). Mary's position was strengthened by the birth of her son, James, in 1566 but weakened again when she was deposed in July 1567. Rebellion under Northumberland and Westmorland Brancepeth Castle The rebellion was led by Charles Neville, 6th Earl of Westmorland, and Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland. Seven hundred knights assembled at Brancepeth Castle.Evans, Gareth. \\"Raby Castle and the Rising of the North\\", Time Travel - Britain In November 1569 Westmorland and Northumberland occupied Durham. Thomas Plumtree celebrated Mass in Durham Cathedral.Butler's Lives of the Saints, Vol 1, P 17 From Durham, the rebels marched south to Bramham Moor, while Elizabeth struggled to raise forces sufficient to confront them. But, hearing of a large force being raised by the Earl of Sussex, the rebels abandoned plans to besiege York, and captured Barnard Castle instead. They proceeded to Clifford Moor, but found little popular support. Sussex marched out from York on 13 December 1569 with 10,000 men against the rebels' 6,000,\\"Protest in Tudor and Stuart times\\", BBC History and was followed by 12,000 men under Baron Clinton. The rebel earls retreated northward and finally dispersed their forces, fleeing into Scotland. Leonard Dacre's resistance A questionable role in the rebellion was played by Leonard Dacre, an early sympathiser of Mary. At the outbreak of the rebellion, he travelled to Elizabeth's court at Windsor to claim the heritage of his young nephew, the 5th Baron Dacre. After the latter's untimely death in 1569, this had descended to his sisters, all married to sons of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk. Dacre returned to Northern England, ostensibly a faithful partisan of Elizabeth, but his intentions remain unclear. After the retreat of the rebels, he seized Greystoke Castle and fortified his own Naworth Castle, where he gathered 3,000 Cumbrian troops and tried to keep up the appearance of good relations with the Queen. He held out against a siege of the royal army under Baron Hunsdon but then attacked the retreating army at Gelt River. Though Hunsdon was outnumbered, he charged Dacre's foot with his cavalry, killing 300‚Äì400 and capturing 200‚Äì300 men. Dacre escaped via Scotland to Flanders, where he died in exile. Reprisals Some of the rebels escaped into Scotland. Regent Mar wrote that Agnes Gray, Lady Home had been a busy worker to receive the rebels.William Boyd, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1905), pp. 701-2. Two of the leaders, the Earls of Northumberland and Westmorland, had fled into Scotland. Northumberland was captured by James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton, and turned over to Elizabeth in 1572, who had him beheaded at York. After having been hidden at Ferniehirst Castle, Westmorland escaped to Flanders, where he died impoverished. His family lost their ancestral homes and his wife, Jane Howard, also fled to the Continent. She lived the rest of her life under house arrest. Her brother, the Duke of Norfolk, was first imprisoned, then pardoned. He was imprisoned again following the Ridolfi plot in 1571 and finally executed in 1572. Norfolk's treason charges included \\"comforting and relieving of the English rebels that stirred the Rebellion in the North since they have fled out of the realm.\\" Altogether, 600 supporters of Mary were executed, while many others fled into exile. Queen Elizabeth declared martial law, exacting terrible retribution on the ordinary folk of the Yorkshire Dales, despite the lack of any popular support for the Earls' Rising, with her demand for at least 700 executions. The victims of this purge were, as a contemporary account said \\"wholly of the meanest sort of people\\", so that hardly a village escaped the sight of a public hanging. (Source: \\"Yorkshire Moors and Dales\\" Marian Sugden & Ernest Frankl, The Pevensey Press, 1987) In 1570, Pope Pius V had tried to aid the rebellion by excommunicating Elizabeth and declaring her deposed in the papal bull Regnans in Excelsis, but the document did not arrive until the rebellion had been suppressed. The bull gave Elizabeth more reason to view Catholics with suspicion. It inspired conspiracies to assassinate her, starting with the Ridolfi plot. In 1587, Elizabeth brought Mary, Queen of Scots, to trial for treason; she was convicted by the court and executed.

WEZB broadcasts in the HD Radio hybrid format. The HD2 subchannel carries Entercom's Channel Q service, primarily for LGBTQ listeners. History On September 1, 1945, 97.1 signed on the air.Broadcasting Yearbook 1950 page 162 This was WRCM, the FM simulcast of AM 990 WJMR (now WGSO) and sister station to WJMR-TV 12 (now WVUE channel 8), all owned by George J. Mayoral. Then, around 1966‚Äì67 after the TV station had already been sold, the Supreme Broadcasting Company bought the two radio stations and changed the call signs to WNNR and WNNR-FM. At the time, the stations were located in the Jung Hotel at 1500 Canal Street in downtown New Orleans. WNNR-FM had a power of only 20,500 watts from an antenna 310 feet atop the building, a fraction of its current wattage and antenna height. On January 2, 1972, EZ Communications acquired the FM station.Broadcasting Yearbook 1973 page B-87 It became WEZB, part of a chain of Beautiful Music stations such as WEZC Charlotte, WEZR Washington and others owned by EZ. While it was profitable, it was not able to best WWL-FM (now WLMG) in the easy listening format. Briefly in the 1970s when disco music became a popular genre, 97.1 became \\"Disco 97 FM\\" on Thursday, February 8, 1979. But the disco era was short, with WEZB switching to a rhythmic contemporary sound, called \\"FM 97, The Rhythm Of The City!\\" \\"We had a big party in the Atrium at the Hyatt Regency Hotel\\" says Jimmy Roberts, B97 FM's first BJ, the station's version of a DJ. On January 1, 1980, \\"Baby New Year was dropped from the ceiling and we switched over from being FM 97, The Rhythm Of The City! to The New B97 FM.\\"B-97's Alumni page on Facebook.com According to Jackson \\"Jack Da Wack\\" Tally, who was also one of B97 FM's first Bee Jocks, in early November 1979, the station slowly started to work more Top 40 music into the playlist and scaled back the rhythmic titles. By the end of that year, the staff was ready for the format change to B97 FM. This station would be a popular Top 40 outlet for years to come, much like \\"The Mighty 690, WTIX\\" was in the 1960s and 1970s. Kent Burkhart, consultant to EZ Communications at the time, states on his websitehttp://www.kentburkhart.com/kentburkhart49.htm Kent Burkhart.com that Dan Vallie was hired on by the company to change the ailing format of WEZB from disco and dance music to Top 40. Over the years, the name went through minor changes (i.e., \\"The New B97 FM\\", \\"New Orleans' B97 FM\\", \\"B97 FM\\", \\"97.1 The All New B-97 FM\\", and \\"B97 FM, All The Hits!\\"), the transmitting power was increased, and the antenna was moved to a taller location. B97 has been New Orleans' top rated Top 40 outlet for more than 40 years, except for two brief, failed experiments. The first format change was a decision by now-defunct EZ Communications, in which the station changed to a hot talk format in the summer of 1994. It featured The Howard Stern Show and other edgy talk programs. The decision to return to a music format came in Spring 1996. On June 7, 1996, the station stunted by playing Billy Ray Cyrus' \\"Achy Breaky Heart\\" repeatedly for seven hours. At noon that day, the station launched a hot adult contemporary - Adult Top 40 format using the same name \\"B97 FM.\\" The first song was Hootie & the Blowfish's \\"Only Wanna Be With You\\".http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1996/R&R-1996-06-14.pdf; On July 26, 1998, B97 FM returned to its heritage Top 40 contemporary hit radio (CHR) format. The station became more Rhythmic in its musical style. Then in 2002, it returned to its current, true Top 40 approach. In 1999, Sinclair Broadcast Group sold WEZB and 45 other radio stations to Entercom for $824.5 million.

The phrase in commendam was originally applied to the provisional occupation of an ecclesiastical benefice, which was temporarily without an actual occupant, in contrast to the conferral of a title, in titulum, which was applied to the regular and unconditional occupation of a benefice.Ott, Michael. \\"In Commendam\\". The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 25 July 2015 The word commendam is the accusative singular of the Latin noun commenda, \\"trust\\", or \\"custody\\", which is derived from the verb commendare (\\"to entrust\\"). Granting a benefice in commendam became most common with monasteries, and the commendatory abbot drew a portion of the revenue of the monastery but without fulfilling the duties of the abbot or even residing at the monastery. History The establishment of ecclesiastical benefices was a way of guaranteeing the financial stability of the Church. Real property and other goods donated to the Church were erected as a stable fund, and the revenue was attached to a particular office. The parish priest, bishop, or other minister would have the right to receive the income of the benefice to support himself and to cover the expenses related to his ministry. There is clear evidence that the granting of a benefice in commendam was practiced in the fourth century. In a letter written around 379,Christian Classics Ethereal Library, Writings of St. Ambrose, accessed 13 March 2019 Ambrose mentions a church which he gave in commendam, while he was Bishop of Milan: \\"Commendo tibi, fili, Ecclesiam quae est ad Forum Cornelii‚Ä¶donec ei ordinetur episcopus\\" (\\"I entrust unto thee, my son, the church which is at the Cornelian Forum‚Ä¶until a bishop is allotted to it\\").Ambrose, Epistle ii Temporarily unoccupied church property (ecclesiastical benefice) could be entrusted to the protection of a member of the church, to safeguard and manage it until order was restored and a new permanent holder of the position was granted in titulum. The patron would receive any revenues generated from the property in the meantime. Each of the early basilicas of Rome was under the guardianship of a patron. The benefice held in commendam could be used to provide a temporary administrator to a church or monastery that was at risk of financial ruin. It also provided a steady income for whoever was nominated, and St. Gregory the Great (590-604) gave vacant monasteries in commendam to bishops who had been driven from their sees by the invading barbarians, or whose own churches were too poor to furnish them a decent livelihood.Gregory, Epistles i, 40; ii, 38; iii, 13; vi, 21; in P. L., LXXVII, 493, 577, 614, 812. In the eighth century, the practice became widely abused when kings claimed the right to appoint abbots in commendam over monasteries, often nominating their own vassals, who were not monks but laymen, as a way of rewarding them. These abbots did not have spiritual care of the monks but did have the right to manage the temporal affairs of the monastery, and some were driven into financial ruin.Ott, Michael, Commendatory Abbot, Catholic Encyclopedia, Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908, accessed 25 July 2015 Abbey of La Chaise-Dieu, in commendam 1518‚Äì1640 When in 1122 the Investiture Controversy was settled in favor of the church, the appointment of laymen as abbots in commendam was abolished. Clergy, however, could still be appointed as commendatory abbots, and the practice was used to provide an income to a professor, student, priest, or cardinal. This cleric would name another man to fulfill the daily responsibilities of the office. The practice was open to abuse: favored cardinals began to receive multiple benefices, accepting them like absentee landlords, increasing their personal possessions to the detriment of the Church. The arrangements were no longer temporary and could be held for a lifetime. Monastic communities, from which these grants were taken, lost revenues and gained nothing in return, suffering from spiritual and temporal mismanagement. In 16th-century France, however, the Kings continued to appoint abbots and the nomination of the King‚Äôs close relatives to office became commonplace particularly in La Chaise-Dieu.\\"From 1518 to 1640 : The Abbey in Commendam\\", L'Abbaye de La Chaise-Dieu Following the Second Vatican Council, the Church drastically reformed and, in most cases, completely abolished the system of benefices. Church of England In the Church of England the stipends of bishops and other senior ecclesiastics were sometimes augmented by the stipends of sinecure benefices held in commendam. In 1719 Hugh Boulter succeeded to the deanery of Christ Church, which he held in commendam with the bishopric of Bristol.Britton, John.

It has been classified as a Group 1 carcinogen. Although no adequate studies of the relationship between exposure to NNN and human cancer have been reported, there is sufficient evidence that NNN causes cancer in experimental animals. NNN is found in a variety of tobacco products including smokeless tobacco like chewing tobacco and snuff, cigarettes, and cigars. It is present in smoke from cigars and cigarettes, in the saliva of people who chew betel quid with tobacco, and in the saliva of oral-snuff and e-cigarette users. NNN is produced by the nitrosation of nornicotine during the curing, aging, processing, and smoking of tobacco. Roughly half of the NNN originates in the unburnt tobacco, with the remainder being formed during burning. NNN can be produced in the acidic environment of the stomach in users of oral nicotine replacement therapies, due to the combination of dietary/endogenous nitrates, and nornicotine (either present as a minor metabolite of nicotine, or as an impurity in the product). Mechanism of Action NNN is metabolized by Cytochrome P450, which adds a hydroxy group to either the 2' or 5' carbon on the 5-membered ring. 2'-hydroxylation appears more prevalent in humans, while 5'-hydroxylation is more prevalent in non- primate animals. Upon hydroxylation, the 5-membered ring opens up, allowing the compound to bind to the base of one of the nucleotides. 358x358px  Synthesis  rightNNN is a derivative of nicotine that is produced in the Curing of tobacco, in the burning of tobacco (such as with cigarettes), and in the acidic conditions of the stomach. Nicotine is converted into Nornicotine via Nicotine N-Demethylase (NND), an enzyme found in the tobacco plant that works by removing the methyl group from the nitrogen on the 5-membered ring of nicotine. From there, Nornicotine undergoes nitrosation (the conversion of organic compounds into nitroso derivatives by gaining a Nitrosonium (N=O) group) on that same nitrogen, converting it to NNN. The nitrosonium group forms from Nitrous acid (HNO2) under acidic conditions present in the tobacco curing process. It can also be formed in the stomach when stomach acid reacts with nitrite ions that are typically used as a salt to preserve red meats and inhibit bacterial growth. Nitrous acid becomes protonated on its hydroxy group to form nitrosooxonium. This compound then splits off to form nitrosonium and water.  Symptoms  Symptoms of NNN are similar to those of nicotine poisoning and include irritation at the point of absorption (for example, the gums when dipping tobacco is used), nausea and vomiting, sleep disturbances, headache, and chest pain. The substance is also a known carcinogen, meaning that any exposure to the substance can lead to cancer and is proven to cause esophageal and nasal cancer in animals. There is no known \\"safe\\" levels of NNN ingestion in humans due to its carcinogenic activity. However, in mice, the median lethal dose (LD50) is 1g/kg. In cigarette smoke, NNN has been found in levels between 2.2-6.6 parts per million (ppm). The FDA has put limits of nitrosamines in other consumable products (such as cured meats) at levels below 10 parts per billion (ppb).

The supercilium is a plumage feature found on the heads of some bird species. It is a stripe which runs from the base of the bird's beak above its eye, finishing somewhere towards the rear of the bird's head.Dunn and Alderfer (2006), p. 10 Also known as an \\"eyebrow\\", it is distinct from the eyestripe, which is a line that runs across the lores, and continues behind the eye.Dunn and Alderfer (2006), p. 11 Where a stripe is present only above the lores, and does not continue behind the eye, it is called a supraloral stripe or simply supraloral. On most species which display a supercilium, it is paler than the adjacent feather tracts.Kaufman, Kenn (2011) A Field Guide to Advanced Birding , page 51 The colour, shape or other features of the supercilium can be useful in bird identification. For example, the supercilium of the dusky warbler, an Old World warbler species, can be used to distinguish it from the very similar Radde's warbler. The dusky warbler's supercilium is sharply demarcated, whitish and narrow in front of the eye, becoming broader and more buffy towards the rear, whereas that of the Radde's warbler is diffusely defined, yellowish and broadest in front of the eye, becoming narrower and more whitish toward the rear. The supercilium of the northern waterthrush, a New World warbler, differs subtly from that of the closely related (and similarly plumaged) Louisiana waterthrush. The Louisiana has a bicoloured supercilium which widens significantly behind the eye, while the northern has an evenly buffy eyebrow which is either the same width throughout or slightly narrower behind the eye.Dunn and Alderfer (2006), p. 394. A split supercilium divides above the lores. In some species, such as the jack snipe, the divided stripes reconnect again behind the eye.Hayman, Marchant and Prater (1986), p. 359 In others, such as the broad-billed sandpiper, the divided stripes remain separate.Hayman, Marchant and Prater (1986), p. 383 A supercilium drop is a feature found on some pipits; it is a pale spot on the rear of the which, although separated from the supercilium by an eyestripe, can appear at some angles to be a downward continuation of the supercilium.

Biography Adolf was born about 1157 as the second son of Count Eberhard of Berg-Altena and his wife Adelheid von Arnsberg. About 1177 he became a canon in Cologne. Later, in 1183, he became Dean of the Cathedral, and in the year 1191 Cathedral Provost. After the abdication of his uncle Bruno III of Berg he became Archbishop of Cologne in 1193, as Adolf I, or Adolf I von Altena. In March 1194 he received his episcopal consecration by Hermann II of Katzenelnbogen, Prince-Bishop of M√ºnster. In the same year Adolf was instrumental in arranging the release of King Richard I of England, whom he received with considerable solemnity in Cologne shortly afterwards, at the beginning of February 1194. He was a declared opponent of the plans for a hereditary empire of Emperor Henry VI and at Christmas 1195 refused Henry's wish for the election of his son Frederick Roger. He gave up his opposition in August 1197 for the secondary election of the candidate chosen in the meantime by the other Electors in Boppard. However, after the death of Henry VI, Adolf declared the election invalid, as the candidate was not baptised and the Emperor had put the Electors under pressure. In the ensuing dynastic struggle for the throne between the Hohenstaufen and the Welfs, he crowned on 12 July 1198 the Welf Otto of Brunswick in Aachen as King of the Romans (or German king). Shortly afterwards, Pope Innocent III, who had an interest in weakening the Hohenstaufen and in breaking their power (particularly in Italy), confirmed the election of Otto. On 6 January 1205 however Adolf then crowned the Staufen competitor for the crown, Philip of Swabia, as German king. Philip had already been crowned in 1198, although only in Mainz Cathedral, but he had nevertheless been crowned with the genuine Imperial Regalia and especially the Imperial crown.[Hugo Stehk√§mper: The Cologne Archbishop Adolf von Altena and the German Electoral Election (1195-1205), in: Theodor Schieder (ed.): Contributions to the History of the Medieval German Royalty, Historical Journal, Supplement NF 2, 1973, p. 5 -83.] The Pope, who had reserved himself the king's question himself, was irritated by the rumor of the page change and asked Adolf himself for a report. Since Adolf did not want to sacrifice his just hard-won right of the decisive vote in the royal election, a papal presentation, he did not respond to the papal request. However, he overestimated its importance by far. On 19 July 1205 Adolf was excommunicated by Pope Innocent III and declared deposed. Already in July, a new archbishop was elected in Cologne. Since one was still in the Rhineland but still in the Hohenstaufen line, his successor could barely prevail against him, so that it came to a schism in the archbishopric of Cologne. In 1207 Adolf von Altena was in Rome, where he tried against his successor and fought for his reinstatement as archbishop - without success. Only the murder of Philip of Swabia (21 June 1208) and the changed political situation led to a submission to the pope and a recognition of his successor for himself and his followers, for which he received an annual pension of 250 marks. Adolf, from then until his death, was active in the archdiocese of Cologne as an auxiliary bishop. However his see was not returned to him. Dietrich I von Hengebach was deposed by the papal legate, and in March 1212 he was appointed to head the diocese. While initially holding this to be reinstated, he soon realized that it was just a provisional lead. In fact, the Archdiocese was again in the schism, especially since Adolf now argued with Dietrich von Hengebach before the Pope for reinstatement. The verdict was in 1216 and in Cologne it came again to the election of the bishop. The new archbishop became his successor as cathedral provost, Engelbert II of Berg. He was one of his relatives and had always supported him during the time of the schism, including by handing over goods from the cathedral chapter. Until his death, in 1220, Adolf was again active as auxiliary bishop in the archbishopric of Cologne. He died on 15 April 1220 in Neuss.

Travels In the last decade of the 16th century, along with the Portuguese adventurer Diogo Veloso from Amarante, Blas Ruiz was the first European to ever set foot in Laos. Ruiz's journey to Laos started in Cambodia. In Cambodia, Ruiz met and befriended King Satha of Lovek and Veloso of Portugal. When Lovek was invaded by Ayutthaya, Satha was overthrown by his son and other nobles who allowed Ayutthaya to take control, forcing Ruiz to flee to the Spanish colony of the Philippines, the place where he began his adventure in Southeast Asia. Eventually Ruiz returned with Veloso, who had fled to the Portuguese colony of Melaka, to Lovek. When they arrived they learned Satha had fled to Lan Xang, an empire centered in modern- day Laos and consisting of Isan, Stung Treng, and small areas of Southern China and Vietnam. Ruiz and Veloso decided to journey to Laos and bring back Satha to restore his reign over Lovek. Ruiz and Veloso arrived in Vientiane, Lan Xang's administrative capital, in the summer of 1596. They were met with a procession showing off the city's immense wealth consisting of Asian Elephants, gold, jewels, silk, exotic snakes, bouquets of tropical flowers, chanting monks, Buddhist treasures and relics, music, and beautiful women. Ruiz and Veloso were also received with a great feast. But while they were in Vientiane they learned Satha had died from an illness he caught on his way from Cambodia to Laos. Saddened and angered by the news, Ruiz and Veloso returned to Lovek and started a rebellion to put one of Satha's political allies on the throne and free Cambodia from Ayatthaya. They managed to drive out Ayutthaya forces from parts of Cambodia and create a new state but led the new Cambodian state into a brief period of chaos. Eventually Ruiz returned to the Philippines. It is not known whether he died there, Spain, or somewhere else. In July 1593 king Satha I sent an embassy to Manila asking for Spanish military help to defend Cambodia. The embassy consisted of Portuguese Diogo Veloso, who had been living in his court since 1583, and Spanish Gregorio de Vargas Machuca. Satha I kept Spanish Blas Ruiz de Hernan Gonzalez as captain of his bodyguard. Veloso came back in February 1594, alone and without help. After Ayutthaya's attack on Cambodia, Veloso, Blas Ruiz and de Vargas Machuca found themselves in Manila. They continued to ask for help, and at last, Spanish Manila agreed to send 3 ships with 120 Spanish and Mexican soldiers, some Japanese and Filipino auxiliaries and some friars, under the commander Suarez Gallinato. The ship with Blas Ruiz was the only one that reached Cambodia. The one with Veloso was wrecked off the Mekong delta and Gallinato's ship was forced to go to Malacca due to the weather. Veloso rejoined Blas Ruiz at Phnom Penh in March 1596. At this point there is no evidence of their fate. They could be killed at Phnom Penh in July 1599 during a fight between Christians (Spanish and Filipinos) and Muslim Malay mercenaries of Barom Reacha II, who was Satha's son. Or they could return to Philippines. Satha had died in October 1597 after contracting disease after he fled to Lan Xang.

New York: Plume. .Perkins, John. 2005 [2004]. Confessions of an Economic Hit Man. Ebury Press. . The book provides Perkins' account of his career with engineering consulting firm Chas. T. Main in Boston. According to Perkins, his job at the firm was to convince leaders of underdeveloped countries to accept substantial development loans for large construction and engineering projects. Ensuring that these projects were contracted to U.S. companies, such loans provided political influence for the US and access to natural resources for American companies, thus primarily helping rich families and local elites, rather than the poor. Suggesting a system of corporatocracy and greed (rather than a unilateral conspiracy), Perkins claims the involvement of the National Security Agency (NSA), with whom he had interviewed for a job prior to joining Main. According to the author, this interview effectively constituted an independent screening which led to his subsequent hiring as an 'economic hit man' by Einar Greve, vice president of the firm (and alleged NSA liaison). According to Perkins, he began writing Confessions of an Economic Hit Man in the 1980s, but \\"threats or bribes always convinced [him] to stop.\\"  Content  The book heavily criticizes U.S. foreign policy and the widely-accepted notion that \\"all economic growth benefits humankind, and that the greater the growth, the more widespread the benefits.\\" Perkins suggests that, in many cases, only a small portion of the population benefits at the expense of the rest, pointing to, as an example, an increase in income inequality, whereby large U.S. corporations exploit cheap labor, and oil companies destroy local environment. Perkins describes what he calls a system of corporatocracy and greed as the driving forces behind establishing the United States as a global empire, in which he took a role as an \\"economic hit man\\" to expand its influence. Perkins' function, according to the book, was to convince the political and financial leadership of developing countries to accept enormous development loans from institutions like the World Bank and USAID. Saddled with debts they could not hope to pay, such countries would then be forced to acquiesce to political pressure from the United States on a variety of issues. Perkins argues that these nations were effectively neutralized politically, with their wealth gaps driven wider and their long-term economies crippled. In this capacity, Perkins recounts his meetings with some prominent individuals, including Graham Greene and Omar Torrijos.

Columnist Sebastian Mallaby of The Washington Post reacted sharply to Perkins' book: \\"This man is a frothing conspiracy theorist, a vainglorious peddler of nonsense, and yet his book, Confessions of an Economic Hit Man, is a runaway bestseller.\\" This charge is brought against Perkins despite the fact that he denounces conspiracy-thinking at numerous places in the book itself. Mallaby, who spent 13 years writing for the London Economist and wrote a critically well-received biography of World Bank chief James Wolfensohn,\\"Sebastian Mallaby  People.\\" The Washington Post. 2020. holds that Perkins' conception of international finance is \\"largely a dream\\" and that his \\"basic contentions are flat wrong.\\" For instance, he points out that Indonesia reduced its infant mortality and illiteracy rates by two-thirds after economists persuaded its leaders to borrow money in 1970. He also disputes Perkins' claim that 51 of the top 100 world economies belong to companies. A value-added comparison shows that 29 countries are in the top 100, while the rest are companies. Other sources, including articles in The New York Times and Boston Magazine, as well as a press release issued by the U.S Department of State (DOS), have referred to a lack of documentary or testimonial evidence to corroborate the claim that the NSA was involved in his hiring to Chas T. Main. In addition, the author of the DOS release states that the NSA \\"is a cryptological (codemaking and codebreaking) organization, not an economic organization\\" and that its missions do not involve \\"anything remotely resembling placing economists at private companies in order to increase the debt of foreign countries.\\" Economic historian Niall Ferguson writes in The Ascent of Money that Perkins's contention that the leaders of Ecuador (President Jaime Rold√≥s Aguilera) and Panama (General Omar Torrijos) were assassinated by U.S. agents for opposing the interests of the owners of their countries' foreign debt \\"seems a little odd.\\" This would be in light of the fact that, in the 1970s, the amount of money that the US had lent to Ecuador and Panama accounted for less than 0.4% of the total U.S. grants and loans, while in 1990, exports from the US to those countries accounted for approximately 0.4% of total U.S. exports (approx. ). According to Ferguson, those \\"do not seem like figures worth killing for.\\" However, Perkins maintains that the motives for such actions, rather than loans, would have been the securing of the Panama Canal as a permanent United States asset, and gaining access to Ecuadorian oil.Ferguson, Niall. 2008. The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World. London: Penguin Books. . pp. 294‚Äì95. Chas. T. Main's former vice president Einar Greve, who first offered Perkins a job at the firm, initially affirmed the overall validity of the book:Revere, C. T. 17 January 2005. \\"Tsunami aid may line US pockets.\\" Tucson Citizen. Retrieved 13 May 2020. . > Basically his story is true.‚Ä¶ What John's book says is, there was a > conspiracy to put all these countries on the hook, and that happened. > Whether or not it was some sinister plot or not is up to interpretation, but > many of these countries are still over the barrel and have never been able > to repay the loans. However, on being asked by another reporter about Perkins' account, Greve re- read the book and denied the validity of some of the claims, such as the NSA having any links to Main, or that Perkins was seduced by Claudine Martin.Tkacik, Maureen. 15 May 2005. \\"Economic Hit Man.\\" Boston Magazine. Boston: Metro Corp. Later years Perkins continued with writing four other books on the 'economic hit man' topic, focusing on other aspects: * A Game as Old as Empire: the Secret World of Economic Hit Men and the Web of Global Corruption (2007); * The Secret History of the American Empire: The Truth About Economic Hit Men, Jackals, and How to Change the World (2007);Perkins, John. 2007.

The epilogue to the 2006 edition provides a rebuttal to the current move by the G8 nations to forgive Third-World debt. Perkins charges that the proposed conditions for this debt forgiveness require countries to privatise their health, education, electric, water and other public services. Those countries would also have to discontinue subsidies and trade restrictions that support local business, but accept the continued subsidization of certain G8 businesses by the US and other G8 countries, and the erection of trade barriers on imports that threaten G8 industries. =Documentary film= In 2009, Stelios Kouloglou directed a Greek‚ÄìU.S. co-produced documentary titled Confessions of an Economic Hit Man, featuring interviews with Perkins filmed between 2007 to 2008. The film was shown at movie festivals around the United States. Numerous interview-style statements by John Perkins also appear in two other documentary films: Zeitgeist: Addendum (2008) and Four Horsemen (2012).

He and Spanish Blas Ruiz were the first Europeans to ever set foot in Laos. Veloso's journey to Laos started in Cambodia. In Cambodia, Veloso met and befriended King Satha of Lovek and Ruiz of Spain. When Lovek was invaded by Ayutthaya, Satha was overthrown by his son and other nobles who allowed Ayutthaya to take control, forcing Veloso to flee to Portuguese Malacca, the place where he began his adventure in Southeast Asia. Eventually Veloso returned with Ruiz, who had fled to Spanish Philippines, to Lovek. When they arrived they learned Satha had fled to Lan Xang, an empire centered in modern-day Laos and consisting of Isan, Stung Treng, and small areas of Southern China and Vietnam. Veloso and Ruiz decided to journey to Laos and bring back Satha to restore his reign over Lovek. They arrived in Vientiane, Lan Xang's administrative capital, in the summer of 1596. They were met with a procession showing off the city's immense wealth consisting of Asian elephants, gold, jewels, silk, exotic snakes, bouquets of tropical flowers, chanting monks, Buddhist treasures and relics, music, and beautiful women. Veloso and Ruiz were also received with a great feast. But while they were in Vientiane they learned Satha had died from an illness he caught on his way from Cambodia to Laos. Saddened and angered by the news, Veloso and Ruiz returned to Lovek and started a rebellion to put one of Satha's political allies on the throne and free Cambodia from Ayutthaya. They managed to drive out Ayutthaya forces from parts of Cambodia and create a new state but led the new Cambodian state into a brief period of chaos. Eventually Veloso returned to Malacca.

It enrolls approximately 2,700 students and was founded in 1960 by the Brothers of Christian Instruction as a liberal arts college. Walsh College became Walsh University in 1993. The university offers more than 70 undergraduate majors and seven graduate programs. Walsh has a satellite campus in Castel Gandolfo, Italy. History The school's namesake is Bishop Emmett Michael Walsh of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Youngstown. Walsh University was first founded as LaMennais College in Alfred, Maine in 1951 by the Brothers of Christian Instruction on an idea by Ferdinand Waldo Demara, who was then posing as a monk, to educate young men as brothers and teachers. LaMennais College continued in Alfred, Maine from 1951 until 1959. Because of a chance 1957 conversation between Brother Francoeur of La Mennais College and Monsignor William Hughes of Youngstown, Ohio about the Brothers' wish to move LaMennais College from Alfred, Maine, Bishop Walsh invited the Brothers to choose Canton, Ohio as the new location. Bishop Walsh donated $304,000 to the Walsh College project. In 1959 the present location of Walsh University began as of farm land on which two buildings were constructed, College Hall (Farrell Hall) and LaMennais Hall which continues to house the Brothers and international priest-students. The Founding Brothers include: Dacian J. Barrette, Thomas S. Farrell, Henry J. Vannasse, Edmond Drouin, Paul E. Masse, Robert A. Francoeur, and Alexis Guilbeault.

The Thea Bowman Scholars Program is designed to help African-American students achieve success and mature as leaders throughout their lifecycle at Walsh University. The program aligns with the University's mission and overall commitment to create an environment that is inclusive and supportive to the student's cultural, spiritual and personal development and their academic success. Students accepted into the Thea Bowman Scholars Program will have opportunities to explore various cultures, politics and history within the United States and abroad. Sister Thea Bowman visited campus on September 18, 1989. = STAR Chemistry = The STAR program at Walsh University is a National Science Foundation supported program designed to foster young science talent and prepare chemistry majors for the workforce. STAR Scholars are trained in: * Environmental Chemistry * Materials and Polymer Chemistry * Fuel and Energy Chemistry Study abroad programs Inspired by the example of global citizenship of the Brothers of Christian Instruction, the Walsh University Office of Global Learning provides opportunities for students to develop into leaders in service with an international perspective. Global Learning promotes study abroad programs led by Walsh faculty to various locations including: * Rome Experience ‚Äì The Walsh Rome Experience allows students to study the language, history, art, culture, literature and archaeology of Rome, Italy while Walsh University students experience Rome. Photo from the Walsh University Office of Global Learning.staying in the Walsh satellite campus in Castel Gandolfo. * Uganda Experience ‚Äì Since 2007, students and faculty have been visiting central and northern Uganda for study, research, service, and the sharing of culture. Considered Walsh's most immersive program, Walsh students have the opportunity to live and work with Ugandan counterparts at Kisubi Brothers University College near Lake Victoria and the Archdiocese of Gulu in the north. Using a sociological lens, students examine Ugandan history, traditions, social institutions, and present challenges for development in this service and reflection-oriented immersion experience. * Tanzania ‚Äì Students and faculty in this program explore the state of healthcare and nursing education in Tanzania while working alongside Tanzanian nurses and nursing students in this practical, cross-cultural experience. In addition to visiting hospitals and clinics, the group explores life in town of Moshi, the hills of Mount Kilimanjaro, and other natural splendors. * Haiti - Senior nursing students and faculty work in conjunction with Akron Children's Hospital in Port-au- Prince, Haiti. During this experience students participate in clinical rotations with St. Damien Pediatric Hospital and St. Luke's Adult Hospital. Past students have had the opportunity to observe a pediatric heart surgery, work with Haitian nurses and nursing students and learn from surgeons around the world. The Office of Global Learning and the Byers School of Nursing send students and faculty twice a year to Haiti. * Uruguay - Students and faculty travel to Maldonado Nuevo, Uruguay, where they spend time with the Brothers of Christian Instruction. During their time in Uruguay, students explore what it means to live out the Brothers' mission and work with students in their youth center. This service learning experience for education majors provides Walsh students the opportunity to take responsibility for the children's daily activities with an eye toward encouraging students to continue with their education, learning functional English, and supporting the youth center's activities as needed. * President's Pilgrimage - Students embark on a journey of faith with former Walsh President Richard Jusseaume and his wife Theresa (Frank) Jusseaume. The group travels through France and Italy for a two-week Pilgrimage that combines the benefits of studying abroad with a unique focus on the Catholic faith. During the trip, the group will visit and celebrate Mass at several devotional sites. * In addition, Walsh University has run faculty-led programs to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, Israel, England, France, Spain, and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Further, Walsh has cooperative agreements with agencies such as CAPA, allowing Walsh students to experience studies and/or internships abroad. Walsh University is a member of the Global Learning Consortium CCSA (Cooperative Center for Study Abroad) and Walsh Faculty and Students can participate in CCSA programs in Australia, The U.K., Ireland and other countries.  Athletics  Walsh has twenty athletic teams and competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association at the Division II level as a member of the Great Midwest Athletic Conference. The university's football team play their home games at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium, part of Johnson Controls Hall of Fame Village in Canton, Ohio. = Varsity teams = Walsh sponsors nine men's varsity teams: baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, lacrosse, tennis, and track & field. The school also sponsors nine women's varsity teams: basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis, track & field, and volleyball. = Mascot and colors = The team name is the \\"Cavaliers\\" and the athletics teams are represented by Sir Walter the Cavalier at events. Sir Walter also makes appearances at various school events outside of Athletics. A carved replica of Sir Walter stands outside the Cecchini Family Health and Wellness Complex and was created from an oak tree in 2016. The name Cavalier was chosen after the school newspaper, The Spectator, ran a contest in 1963 asking for possible team names. Sean Keenan, Walsh class of 1964, then a junior, submitted for \\"Cavaliers\\". He took home a $15 prize. School colors are maroon and gold. = National championships = Championships include: *The men's basketball team won the 2005 NAIA National Championship. *The women's basketball team won the 1998 NAIA National Championship. *The men's baseball team advanced to the 2007 NAIA World Series for the first time in school history.

Life and career  Cesare \\"Joe\\" Colombo was until 1949 educated at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera, the academy of fine arts, in Milano as a painter and studied afterwards until 1954 Architecture at Politecnico di Milano University. In 1951 he joined the Movimento Nucleare, founded by Sergio D¬¥Angelo and Enrico Baj. The following four years Colombo was active as a painter and sculptor of the abstract Expressionism and exhibited his works with other members in Milano, Torino, Verviers, Venice and Brussels. In 1955 Colombo joined the Art Concret group, but gave up his painting to promote his Design Career. Before he cooperated at an exhibition for the tenth Triennale of 1954 and documented the Ceramic Designs of an international meeting in Albisola. For his presentation Colombo created for example three exterior seatings which were combined with a \\"shrinelike\\" presentation of TVs. In 1959, Colombo had to take over the family company, which produced electric appliances, and started to experiment with new construction and production technologies. In 1962 Colombo opened his own interior design and architecture projects, mostly for lodges and skiing. Colombo designed products for Oluce, Kartell, Bieffe, Alessi, Flexform and Boffi. Colombo died in 1971 on his 41st birthday. Main works Joe Colombo, Portable storage system, 1969, Museum of Modern Art (New York City) Together with his brother Gianni, Colombo developed the idea of prismatic lamps like the lamp Acrilica(1962). His first design for Kartell was the chair No.4801 (1963‚Äì1967) which consisted of three assembled plywood elements. The flowing elements of his chair were a foretaste of his later plastic designs, like the chair universale No.4860 (1965‚Äì1967), which was the first seating for adults made of ABS. Moreover, Colombo produced innovative designs for furniture, lamps, glass, doorknobs, pipes, alarm clocks, and wristwatches. He created the professional camera Trisystem (1969), the air conditioner Candy (1970), dinnerware for Alitalia (1970; still in use), as well as an ergonomic and engined printing table. Since the beginning of his career Colombo was most interested in living systems. His early modular container Combi-Centre of 1963 is an example for that. This preference for furniture systems led to designs like Additional Living System (1967‚Äì1968) and the chairs Tube (1969‚Äì1970) and Multi (1970), which could be assembled in various positions to get a great number of sitting positions. They reflect Colombo's main goal, variability. His futuristic designs were integrated micro-living-worlds. His Visiona- Livingroom of the future was exhibited at the Visiona-Exhibition of 1969. This room consisted of \\"Barbella-like\\" space interiors where furniture became structure elements and vice versa. Traditional furniture was replaced by functional elements like the sitting cubes Night-Cell and Central-Living as well as the Kitchen-Box, to create a dynamic, multifunctional living space. The kitchen-box (1963), on wheels and measuring 90x75x75cm, containing a two- burner stovetop, oven, grill, refrigerator, cutting board, pull-out worktop, and storage for cookbooks, knives, and other tools, has recently been reissued, slightly enlarged (96 cm(h)x107cmx65cm), manufactured by Boffi Spa. For his own apartment Colombo designed the units Roto-living and Cabriolet-Bed (both 1969), followed by Total Furnishing Unit, which was presented at the exhibition Italy: The Domestic Landscape at the Museum of Modern Art, New York in 1972. It presented a complete \\"living-machine,\\" comprising kitchen, wardrobe, bathroom, and sleeping accommodation, on only 28 square meters. * The Elda Chair (1963) * The Brillio Chair (1971) * The Topo Lamp (1970) Exhibitions His work has been exhibited at museums, among them the Museum of Modern Art in New York.:) Awards In 1964 Colombo received the IN-Arch prize for his room conception of a hotel in Sardinia (1962‚Äì1964). In 1967 and 1968, he was awarded ADI (Associazione per il Disegno Industriale) prize. In 1970 he received the Compasso d'Oro award.

After garnering local fame as a model, she gained recognition for her contributions to Singaporean post-colonial literature and the anthropic philosophy conveyed in her works. Her first book, Excuse Me, Are You A Model?, is recognised as a significant milestone in the literary and cultural history of Singapore. Hicks later published a second book, Discuss Disgust, and many shorter pieces in press outlets, including a short-lived opinion column in a major Singaporean daily that was pulled due to public dissent from Singaporean traditionalists. Hicks died at age 29 on 19 December 1997 aboard SilkAir Flight 185 when it crashed into the Musi River on the Indonesian island of Sumatra, and according to the NTSB, is believed to be an act of suicide and mass murder by the Singaporean pilot. All 104 passengers aboard the flight died. After Hicks' death, numerous publications including the book Heaven Can Wait: Conversations with Bonny Hicks by Tal Ben-Shahar featured her life and thought. Although Hicks was deemed controversial by many during her lifetime because of her willingness to openly discuss human sexuality, Singaporean literary scholars today deem her voice as a pivotally important one for interpreting contemporary Singaporean society. Hicks' legacy today is one of an important transitional social figure between old and new Singapore during its period of broad-scale societal changes under the forces of globalisation. Her death resulted in the loss of a Singaporean national voice that was both growing and important yet internally conflicted. Criticisms by Singaporean traditionalists during her modelling and authoring careers continually vexed Hicks' conscience and helped drive her to re-evaluate her life. Hicks ultimately made a sustained series of traditionalist choices during the latter years of her life. Early life Hicks was born in 1968 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to a British father, Ron Hicks, and a Cantonese-speaking Singaporean-Chinese mother, Betty Soh. Her parents separated shortly after her birth and Soh relocated to Singapore in 1969 with her infant daughter. There, Hicks' formative social environment was multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, and included Malays, Indians, and Chinese of various dialect groups. Although Hicks was biracial, she identified as Chinese during her early childhood, speaking Cantonese and watching Chinese-language television at home. When Hicks was twelve, her mother accepted a job as a caretaker of a bungalow in Sentosa, Singapore, and they relocated to the island away from a Singaporean Housing and Development Board flat in Toa Payoh. Throughout her teens, Hicks lived with her mother on Sentosa Island, and intermittently with her (grandmother) with whom she enjoyed a particularly close relationship.Tan Gim Ean, \\"A Bonny way to tell the truth\\" New Straits Times, 30 May 1992, 28. Hicks never met her father. At aged sixteen, she traced his whereabouts through the British High Commission, with whom he was stationed on Singapore during Hicks' conception. Married with children from his new arrangement, and likely keeping his past muffled from his new family, Hicks' father returned word via fax to her that he wanted nothing to do with her. Despite Hicks' superficial joking whenever publicly questioned about it, her father's rejection of her remained deeply hurtful to Hicks throughout her life.Rahman, Sheila, \\"Don't judge a covergirl by her looks,\\" New Straits Times, 2 Sep 1990, 10. Hicks' early years were marked by \\"few friends\\". She stated she made no real friends after age 15‚Äîthat is, until she met Patricia Chan Li-Yin, a person who would become a pivotally important person to Hicks' life and career.Excuse Me, 7. Now a magazine editor and talent agent, Chan had retired from being a Singaporean sports hero, a decorated female swimmer. Finding fame =Discovery and first mentor= Chan \\"discovered\\" the nineteen-year-old Bonnie Hicks shortly after Hicks completed her A levels at the Hwa Chong Junior College. Hicks and Chan enjoyed a close, multi-leveled, complicated relationship that was both professional and personal. Hicks referred to Chan as \\"Mum\\", and some surmised that there was perhaps more to the relationship. Stemming from ambiguous statements Hicks later made in her first book, (e.g., \\"I was in love with Pat Chan\\"), Singaporeans widely speculated whether the two were involved in a lesbian relationship. While the statements in Hicks' book could be interpreted as indicating only an intimate mentoring relationship with Chan, whom Hicks clearly idealized and greatly admired, she continued to be ambiguous on the subject whenever questioned. This created a sense of mystery about herself, and contributed to ongoing buzz and publicity. =Modeling= Hicks' modelling career began with the September 1987 cover of a now-defunct Singaporean fashion monthly, GO. She followed this with multiple appearances on other covers, print advertisements, catwalk appearances in designer clothes, and in a music video for a top-10 hit by the Singaporean band The Oddfellows.For info on the band, see http://www.nlb.gov.sg/blogs/libraryesplanade/music/baybeats- observation-deck-band-profile-the-oddfellows/ A year into her modelling career, Hicks began writing about her life experiences and ideas stemming from her modelling. By age twenty-one she had completed her first book, Excuse Me, are you a Model? She continued to model for five more years and in 1992, at the age of twenty-four, released her second book Discuss Disgust. Hicks then left modelling to take a job as a department lead and copywriter in Jakarta, Indonesia. At the time, Hicks reiterated a statement she had made in her first book: that she had never wanted to be a model in the first place. Instead, her dream since age thirteen had been to be a writer. It was then that she had begun keeping a diary of her feelings and experiences, a practice she continued throughout her life. =Brief marriage= Before her move to Indonesia, Hicks was married briefly to a former member of the Republic of Singapore Air Force. Hicks left him for Richard \\"Randy\\" Dalrymple, an American architect, by whose side she died aboard SilkAir Flight 185. Hicks' first husband was a former colleague of the pilot of the plane in which Hicks perished. This connection would later become a troubling focus of the investigation into the crash that took Hicks' life‚Äîher murder, as was shown in the events that followed. Dalrymple's architecture in Singapore was featured in: Dalrymple, Richard. \\"Pavilions for a Forest Setting in Singapore.\\" Architectural Digest (4/91), 48 (4). Literary contributions and controversy =Excuse Me, Are You a Model?= Hicks published her first work Excuse Me, Are You a Model? in Singapore in 1990. The book is her autobiographical expos√© of the modelling and fashion world and contains frequent, candid discussion about her sexuality, a subject that was not traditionally broached in Singaporean society at the time. The work stirred significant controversy among Singaporeans who held traditional literary and moral standards. Traditionalists considered Hick's work a \\"kiss and tell\\" book that disclosed \\"too much too soon\\" from an independent woman still in her early twenties. Singaporean youth, on the other hand, had a starkly different view; twelve thousand copies were sold within two weeks, prompting the book's publisher to boast Hicks' work as \\"the biggest book sensation in the annals of Singapore publishing\\"‚Äîan accurate claim. During the years leading up to her death, Singaporean English literature scholars had begun to recognise more than just a simple generational divide in the reactions to Hicks' book, and were describing it as \\"an important work\\" in the confessional mode of the genre of post-colonial literature. Well before Hick's book was deemed \\"a significant milestone in Singapore's literary and cultural history,\\" Singaporean young people had already established a localized literary movement, following Hicks' lead. Local markets soon became inundated with the autobiographies of fame-seeking youth, many not yet in their twenties. =Discuss Disgust= In 1992, two years after Hicks' controversial entry into Singapore's literary scene, she published her second and last book, Discuss Disgust. The novella, literarily more sophisticated but never as popular as her first book, portrays the world as seen through the eyes of a child whose mother is a prostitute. In it, Hicks continued to openly discuss sexuality and in veiled terms even broached the taboo of sexual abuse, both subjects that were not normally spoken of openly in Singapore during the time.Interview and review by Koh, Buck Song, \\"Little girl lost\\", The Straits Times 21 March 1992. Adding fuel to the controversy surrounding Hicks, a widely read local traditionalist columnist dubbed it \\"another one of those commercial publications which pack sleaze and sin into its hundred-oddpages\\" (sic).Tan Gim Ean, \\"That's why mummy is a tart\\" New Straits Times, 30 May 1992, 28. While public understanding was greater than let on, traditionalist social pressures meant that few people publicly accepted the novella for what it actually was: Hicks' semi-autobiographical account of her own troubled childhood years, an only partially veiled yet immediately unsuccessful cry for the public to reinterpret her early adult years through the trauma-lens of her childhood. =\\"The Bonny Hicks Diary\\"= Hicks was also a frequent contributor to Singaporean and regional press outlets. Her frankly-written bi-monthly column in The Straits Times, \\"The Bonny Hicks Diary\\", in which she often discussed her childhood on Sentosa Island, further incited traditionalists' feelings that Hicks was an improper role model for young, impressionable girls, whom traditionalists felt were being morally corrupted by Hicks. Yielding to public pressure, spurred initially by a letter writing campaign to the paper, the Times pulled her column within a year. The paper's esteemed editor, Richard Lim, subsequently voiced regret over what he considered a politically motivated decision by the paper. Pushing back as far as practicable, Lim began running frequent \\"special\\" columns by Hicks. Having taken a mentoring interest in Hicks' development as a writer since her first publication, Lim was uniquely authoritative when he publicly noted the deepening of Hicks' writings as she matured. =Third Book?= At the time of Discuss Disgust's release, Hicks reported to The Straits Times that she had been working on a third book, one that centred on correspondence between herself and an unnamed female housemate. Hicks wrote of her social observations of the United States during a two-month visit, using it as a springboard to social commentary about Singapore. While the book idea further revealed Hicks' preference to write with a certain person in mind it never materialised, not even in draft form or as personal papers released posthumously . Life transition =Introspection= During Hicks' heyday, few had begun to adequately situate her life and works within the larger societal changes that had enveloped Singapore at the time under forces of rapid globalisation‚Äîchanges that, by then, were simply far to advanced and powerful to altogether stop the clock upon by the traditionally successful means of shaming and ostracising. For the most part, traditionalists simply reacted from gut-level fear against Hicks, or a simplified characterisation or straw man of her, whom they perceived as a \\"notorious\\" moral threat willing to degrade Singaporean society for personal fame and financial gain. Even though the criticisms were not entirely fair‚Äîthey certainly contained at least a kernel of truth‚Äîtheir accumulation had long been taking a toll upon Hicks' perseverance, eroding away at even her senses of identity, purpose, and wholeness, and thus her basic senses of faith, hope, and peace about the future. While she yet continued to milk opportunities for self-promotion, as Pat Chan had taught her to do, it was becoming clearer and clearer that Hicks had for some time been deep within a season of personal introspection, and had been laying plans for a significant life and career transition that appeared to be informed by the values of Singaporean traditionalists. Whilst she was perhaps conceding a victory to her traditionalist critics amid her life transition, her life change was caused at least as much by her own personal maturing away from the years and seemingly unrestrained values of her youth, although there was certainly an interplay of both external and internal forces that prodded her along. Overall, Hicks's self-promotional success efforts had begun to painfully wane, so she took pause and introspectively re-evaluated. Of this tumultuous period Hicks confessed, > I experienced great happiness and great sorrow in my life. While the great > happiness was uplifting and renewing, the sorrow ate at me slowly, like a > worm in the core of an apple. I realised then that stable happiness was not > mine until I could eliminate the sorrow too. The sorrow which I experienced > was often due to the fact that my own happiness came at a price. That price > was someone else's happiness. =New mentors, new growth= Despite Hicks' confession that she had harmed others along her path to fame, and her intention to reverse the trend, she all along had her supporters‚Äîthose who comprehended her on a level deeper than the mere fandom she had so often sought to instigate toward herself, and who saw in Hicks a young lady not trying to offend but to initiate critical conversations within a culture that was often far too resistant to anything beyond the familiar. To them, Hicks' anthropical philosophy of life that featured loving, caring and sharing was not only refreshing but important, perhaps more than even Hicks herself could appreciate at the time. A growing voice appeared to emerge clearly in her writings, and it attracted many Singaporeans and others, including some scholars. Two of the scholars would become pivotally influential new mentors to Hicks during her major traditionalist life transition, the ultimate result of which, as things would turn out, would be cut short by her untimely death. One of Hicks' new mentors was Tal Ben-Shahar, a positive psychologist and popular professor of psychology at the time at Harvard University. Hicks reached out to Ben-Shahar after being exposed to his writings, and the two corresponded about philosophical and spiritual matters for approximately one year, on up until Hicks' 1997 death. The correspondence later became basis for a 1998 book by Ben-Shahar, in which he narrated Hicks' profound growth during the year. Hicks had also become a student of Confucian humanism, and she was particularly attracted to the thought a second Harvard professor, Tu Wei-Ming, a New Confucian philosopher, who became a second new mentor to Hicks. Hicks attended Tu's seminars and the two corresponded over some months. With Tu's influence added to that of Ben-Shahar's, Hicks began to exhibit an increased New Confucian influence upon her thinking, and she soon turned in her occasional Straits Times columns to criticising Singaporean society from the theme. In one piece, she expressed dismay about the \\"lack of understanding of Confucianism as it was intended to be and the political version of the ideology to which we [as Singaporeans] are exposed today.\\" Just before Hicks' death she had submitted what Editor Richard Lim recognised as her most mature column ever to The Straits Times. The daily posthumously published \\"I think and feel, therefore I am\\", on 28 December 1997. In it Hicks argued, > Thinking is more than just conceiving ideas and drawing inferences; thinking > is also reflection and contemplation. When we take embodied thinking rather > than abstract reasoning as a goal for our mind, then we understand that > thinking is a transformative act. > > The mind will not only deduce, speculate, and comprehend, but it will also > awaken, will enlighten and inspire. > > Si, is how I have thought, and always will think. Tu asserts that Hicks' use of the Chinese character Si was \\"code language,\\" readily understood by her Chinese-speaking English readers, to convey New Confucian thought. The piece, Hicks' last, reflects the maturing and deepening engagement in philosophy and spirituality that she had clearly been enveloped in under tutelage of her new mentors during her last year of life. Redefining herself =Move to Indonesia= When Hicks penned Excuse Me, are you a Model?, her intent was to write a first book to which people would react. Whether those reactions were positive or negative was not her young mind's first concern. Only public indifference, the antithesis of public reaction, would impede her achievement of fame and popularity, she believed‚Äîa message Pat Chan had surely instilled in Hicks from the start. Hicks described her own early motivations: > I wanted to be something all young girls aspired to be, I wanted to be that > model that men lusted after, I wanted to be that model that people would > recognise on the streets. I wanted to be that model that clients would never > stop demanding for, I wanted to be that model, that face, that would launch > a thousand ships. I wanted to be a star.Excuse Me, 86. Although Hicks never fully attained her stardom goals, and although she later distanced herself from her goals on the matter, Singaporeans broadly took note of the nature of her early attempts at becoming famous. Few people found themselves able to respond to Hicks with a mere shrug, a fact that fueled not only her popularity among her supporters but the controversy that so doggedly followed her among her critics. While tasting the intense and transitory flavor of fame, Hicks' limited life experience could not have led her to anticipate the intensity of the negative reactions that would accompany her attempts under the spotlight, could not have allowed her to surmise the toll that the negative words and societal shunning would take upon her psyche over time. In many ways, her move to Indonesia, which coincided with her plea for greater public understanding as released in her second book, Discuss Disgust, was an attempt to escape the intense controversy she had experienced in Singapore over her first book, Excuse Me, Are You a Model? Whether her departure was something of a victory for traditionalists, a mere admission to herself of her limited constitution to withstand societal disapprobation, an outcome of simply her own maturation, or some combination of the three, cannot be known with certainty. What is clear, however, is that her hope through her move was to find a reprieve from the societal shunning she had been experiencing from traditionalists in Singapore; to move to a place where she could deepen and further redefine herself and perhaps undertake a larger and much wiser relaunching of herself in Singapore. It was never to be due to her untimely death. =Heading to university= Part of Hicks' plan was to attend university. Although Hicks publicly downplayed her lack of higher education, she privately expressed regret that she had not studied past her A-levels, a fact traditionalist critics had used against her and her writings with no small frequency. During the year leading up to her 1997 death, Hicks applied to numerous universities in Britain and the United States, including Harvard. During her application processes she called upon her Harvard mentors to exert influence on her behalf, which certainly helped overcome any negative effects that remained from Hicks' unremarkable academic record during her youth. At the time she applied, Hicks could present herself as an exceptional candidate to any university she wished to attend, a veritable shoo-in. Here was a young woman who had overcome a very difficult upbringing to become a nationally known model-turned-author, and whose mind, spirit, and insights had authentically impressed the two high-level academicians who had become the predominant mentors of her life transition and letter of recommendation writers. Hicks soon reported through the Singaporean press that she had received one university acceptance, refusing to say where, stating that she was awaiting other possible acceptances before ultimately deciding where to attend. =Marriage and family plans= In keeping with traditionalist Singaporean pressures placed upon her, Hicks had begun to mature her image regarding her personal relationships and sexual reputation, whether her actual deeds fully deserved the reputation or not. She made plans to marry, settle down, and have children. Shortly before her death, Hicks became engaged to her longtime boyfriend, Richard \\"Randy\\" Dalrymple, an American architect of some regional prominence because of his unique structures in Singapore and Jakarta, once featured in Architectural Digest.See for example the April 1991 and November 1993 issues. It was to celebrate Christmas with Dalrymple's family that Hicks and Dalrymple boarded SilkAir Flight 185 in Jakarta en route to Singapore, probably their first such visit to the home of Dalrymple's parents as an engaged couple. The young couple never arrived, died en route, as their flight crashed into the Musi River.  Death  Less than thirty minutes into SilkAir Flight 185 with Hicks aboard, the flight began a sudden, radical, high-speed nosedive at 35,000 feet toward the Musi River. The plane reached such a high velocity that it broke into pieces in the air before being scattered across the river's surface. Local fisherman immediately scoured the crash site for survivors, even though by all accounts the scene appeared devastatingly hopeless. Both Hicks and Dalrymple perished along with all of the rest of the passengers and crew. No one ever found even a single intact body.Dalrymple's architecture in Singapore was featured in: Dalrymple, Richard. \\"Pavilions for a Forest Setting in Singapore.\\" Architectural Digest (4/91), 48 (4). =Crash investigations= Hicks' personal effects, including her wallet and credit cards, were found by divers at the crash site and confirmed her death. SilkAir Flight 185 had crashed with such tremendous force that only six of the one hundred and four victims could be identified from the scant partially intact body parts.\\"The pilot who wanted to die \\", Sydney Morning Herald, 10 July 1999. The crash investigation revealed that Hicks' ex- husband was a Republic of Singapore Air Force friend of Tsu Way Ming, the Singaporean captain of SilkAir Flight 185. According to the recovered flight recorder, Tsu had walked into the first class area of the plane's cabin just minutes before the crash. It would have been hard for him to miss Hicks and Dalrymple seated together. Tsu was thought to have disabled the plane's flight recorder to prevent it from providing a clear record of the actions he was about to take. Additionally, investigators discovered that Tsu had longstanding personal problems and a string of troubling incidents as a pilot. Leading up to the time of the crash, he had been experiencing serious family and financial problems, in part due to gambling debts. A month earlier, Tsu had taken out a large life insurance policy on himself that went into effect just hours before the crash. =Crash conclusions= Indonesian authorities concluded that the crash had occurred for unknown reasons, resulting in nearly universal criticism that they had politicised the report so as not to strike fear into potential passengers of its fledgling national airline industry. An official investigation by the Singapore Police Force found \\"no evidence that the pilot, copilot or any crew member had suicidal tendencies or a motive to deliberately cause the crash of [the aircraft].\\"Singapore Police Force, Investigation into the Police Report lodged on 25 August 1999 by the Singapore-Accredited Representative to the National Transportation Safety Committee, 14 December 2000. (from archive.org) U.S. authorities,U.S. authorities investigate crashes that occur on foreign soil whenever Americans were aboard the plane. whose painstaking research had become the main basis of criticism of Indonesia's and Singapore's findings, took a confidently different view. Employing uncharacteristic brushes of rhetorical force and critical statements in their final report, they ruled the crash a suicide/homicide caused by the deliberate actions of SilkAir Flight 185's Captain Tsu Way Ming. He deliberately murdered everyone aboard while committing suicide, according to the U.S.'s investigation. As a result of Indonesia's findings, survivor benefits were paid in full to Captain Tsu Way Ming's wife and children. =Aftermath of death= Hicks' death at age twenty- nine shocked Singaporeans, as well as others around the globe, and prompted a swirl of activity as people sought to interpret the meaning of a life that had been suddenly cut short. Hicks' traditionalist critics as well as her allies both looked afresh, deeper, more carefully, and perhaps with a level of nuance she had prior deserved all along.See, for example, an essay by The Straits Times columnist Koh, Buck Song, \\"Bonny, you must wear a mini\\", 12 January 1998. Her life exceeded her own expectations. Legacy =Post-modern author= Hicks is a transitional yet often still-controversial figure who lived and died a tragic death amid an important period of debate over changes between traditional and globalised Singapore. Both in life and in death, her status as a writer came to eclipse her status as a model. Today she is most recognised for her contributions to Singaporean post-colonial literature that spoke out on subjects not normally broached in her society, and the anthropic philosophy contained in her writings. Describing the consensus of Singaporean literary scholars in 1995, two years before Hicks' death, Ismail S. Talib in The Journal of Commonwealth Literature stated of Excuse me, are you a Model?: \\"We have come to realize in retrospect that Hicks's autobiographical account of her life as a model was a significant milestone in Singapore's literary and cultural history\\". This recognition preceded Hicks' death, and in light of the controversy, and even the societal shunning she faced because of her early writings, took her and many around her by surprise. It also helped fuel the life transition she underwent prior her death. =Interpreting a life cut short= As answers and unanswered questions continued to trickle out from the flight investigations, literary scholars, both in Singapore and elsewhere, began their own investigations of Hicks' writings. Some did so anew, while others did so for the first time. Tu Weiming characterized Hicks' life and philosophy as providing a \\"sharp contrast to Hobbes' cynic[al] view of human existence\\", and stated that Hicks was \\"the paradigmatic example of an autonomous, free-choosing individual who decided early on to construct a lifestyle congenial to her idiosyncratic sense of self-expression\\". More than anything, Tu said, \\"She was primarily a seeker of meaningful existence, a learner\\". Singaporean post-colonial author Grace Chia interpreted Hicks' life with a poem, \\"Mermaid Princess\\", that parodies the traditional Scottish folk song, \\"My Bonnie Lies over the Ocean.\\" An excerpt of the poem characterises Hicks as one who: > spoke too soon > too loud > too much out of turn > too brutally honest > too empowered by your sense/x/uality > too much of I, I, I, I ‚Äì > I think > I know > I understand > I love > I, I, I, I. Richard Lim, the editor of The Straits Times, interpreted Hicks in a eulogy by recalling her life and contributions to the paper, and by publishing an excerpt of the famous essay \\"Whistling of Birds\\" by D. H. Lawrence. Lim began his piece with a line from the famous folk/rock song Fire and Rain by James Taylor. \\"Sweet dreams and flying machines, and pieces on the ground,\\" as if sung into his readers' memories in Taylor's highly somber tone, seemed to perfectly encapsulate much of the retrospective feeling across Singapore about Hicks' life and sudden death. On the first anniversary of her death, in December 1998, Tal Ben-Shahar published Heaven Can Wait: Conversations with Bonny Hicks, in which he wove together his and Hicks' year-long correspondence with his own philosophical musings. The book is an extended postmodern \\"conversation\\" between two seekers journeying intensely together in a quest for meaning and purpose. It takes its title from an article Hicks submitted to The Straits Times just days before her death, which ever after took on a hauntingly prophetic air. In it she wrote: \\"The brevity of life on earth cannot be overemphasized. I cannot take for granted that time is on my side‚Äîbecause it is not ... Heaven can wait, but I cannot\\". In an earlier Strait Times piece that memorialised her grandmother, Hicks confessed that she believed in life after death. =Non-racialism= Especially among Singaporean youth, who in the years since Hicks' death have become increasingly uncomfortable with their country's traditional backdrops of racialism, Hicks is recognized as a person who learned to cross cultural boundaries, who found a comfortable niche in the betwixt-and-between of contesting cultural traditions, and who lived as one who was race-blind to see people for who they really were. =Memorials= A memorial in honour of the victims of SilkAir Flight 185 stands beside the Musi River crash site in Indonesia. Another is at Choa Chu Kang Cemetery, Singapore. Bibliography * 'Excuse Me, are you a Model?'

It was written and directed by Anne Wheeler and produced by Alberta Motion Picture Development Corporation with the assistance of Allarcom Limited. Plot During World War II, Daisy Cooper (Rebecca Jenkins) returns home to her small Alberta town after she and her soldier husband, Teddy (Michael Ontkean), are split by the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong. While waiting for the war to end and to learn if Teddy is alive or dead, she joins a swing band as a singer to provide for her family, performing with them in many community halls. Daisy and her children initially live with her husband's parents, but later rent a house for themselves, as Daisy chafes under her in-laws' scrutiny. Daisy struggles to balance societal expectations of fealty and commitment to her children, while also struggling to financially support herself and her children by travelling and performing with the band. A trombonist in the band has a secret past and a not so secret yearning. Daisy struggles with an impossible choice as she hears that Teddy is returning home. Her husband's sister, a somewhat similar free spirit, befriends an Australian airman in Alberta to train in the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan.

During World War II, BTM constructed a number of \\"bombes\\", machines used at Bletchley Park to break the German Enigma machine ciphers. The company was formed in 1902 as The Tabulator Limited, after Robert Porter obtained the rights to sell Herman Hollerith's patented machines from the US Tabulating Machine Company (later to become IBM). By 1909, the company had been renamed the \\"British Tabulating Machine Company Limited\\". In 1920, the company moved from London to Letchworth, Hertfordshire; it was also at this point that it started manufacturing its own machines, rather than simply reselling Hollerith equipment. Annual revenues were ¬£6K in 1915, ¬£122K in 1925, and ¬£170K in 1937. In 1916 there were 45 staff; this increased to 132 in 1922, 326 in 1929 and 1225 in 1939. In return for the exclusive right to market Hollerith equipment in Britain and the Empire (excluding Canada), BTM paid 25% of its revenues to the American company by way of royalties. This became an ever-increasing burden as the years progressed; BTM attempted to renegotiate the agreement on several occasions, but it was only finally terminated in 1948. During World War II, BTM was called upon to design and manufacture a machine to assist breaking the German Enigma machine ciphers. This machine, known as a Bombe, was initially conceived by Alan Turing, but the actual machine was designed by BTM chief engineer Harold 'Doc' Keen, who had led the company's engineering department throughout the 1930s. The project was codenamed \\"CANTAB\\". By the end of the European war, over two hundred bombes had been built and installed. HEC computer BTM built a valve based computer called the HEC (Hollerith Electronic Computer). The first model (HEC 1) was built in 1951, an example is held by the Birmingham Museum.http://www.ourcomputerheritage.org/T1%20BTM's%20HEC%201%20computer.htm http://www.computerconservationsociety.org/HEC1.htm BTM went on to develop the HEC 2, 2M and 4 models, eventually building more than 100. The machines had a 2 kilobyte drum memory and 1000 valves, and could use punched cards for input and output, or drive a printer. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35924858http://www.gizmag.com/britain- computer-mass-produced-first-public/42595/ Merger In 1959 BTM merged with former rival Powers-Samas to become International Computers and Tabulators Limited (ICT). ICT later became part of ICL (International Computers Limited), which was later taken over by Fujitsu.

DeltaPlex Arena is a venue usable for not only sports and concerts but also trade shows, conventions, concerts and special events.The DeltaPlex Arena & Conference Center deltaplex.com, June 18, 2014 History The original building was constructed in 1952, and began life as the Stadium Arena. The building had an arched roof design with wooded arch supports instead of steel. The building housed many different tenants including two defunct IHL Hockey teams. The Grand Rapids Rockets in the 1950s (an NAHL team of the same name played in the building during the 1990s) and the Grand Rapids Owls in the late 1970s until 1980. During the 1960s and early 1970s it was home to Atlantic Mills Department Store. It was also home for a short time to a drive-in theater, known as the Stadium Drive-In Theater. For most of its life it was located at the corner of Turner Ave. and West River Drive. However, due to a reconstruction of West River Drive, the parking lot was enlarged and Turner Ave. ended at West River Drive. It was the Grand Rapids area's main indoor entertainment facility until the opening of Van Andel Arena in 1996. In the mid-1990s the building was sold to the Langlois Family. After the purchase an extensive, ground-up restoration and remodeling regimen followed and the newly christened DeltaPlex was born. The arena serves as the Grand Rapids chapter of Arena Racing. it also previously hosted the Grand Rapids Flight of the International Basketball League in 2008. In 2010, the DeltaPlex Arena was home to the West Michigan ThunderHawks of the Indoor Football League.

It connects Queen Charlotte Sound with Johnstone Strait and Discovery Passage and via them to the Strait of Georgia and Puget Sound. It forms part of the Inside Passage from Washington to Alaska. The term Queen Charlotte Strait is also used to refer to the general region and its many communities, notably of the Kwakwaka ºwakw peoples. Despite its name, Queen Charlotte Strait does not lie between Haida Gwaii (Queen Charlotte Islands) and the mainland; that body of water is named Hecate Strait. Etymology The Discovery ran aground in early August 1792 on hidden rocks in Queen Charlotte Strait near Fife Sound. Within a day the Chatham also ran aground on rocks about two miles away. Queen Charlotte Sound was named by James Strange on August 5, 1786, in honour of Queen Charlotte, the consort of King George III. Strange was the leader of a fur trading expedition of two vessels, the Captain Cook, under Captain Henry Lawrie, and the Experiment, under Captain John Guise. During a boat excursion up Goletas Channel, Strange saw an opening ahead and named it Queen Charlotte Sound. The body of water he named was what is today known as Queen Charlotte Strait. For some time Queen Charlotte Strait was also called Queen Charlotte Sound, until 1920 when the BCGNIS and Hydrographic Service distinguished between Queen Charlotte Sound and Queen Charlotte Strait. George Vancouver, who used the name in his maps and writings, wrote that the sound was named by Mr. S. Wedgeborough, in command of the Experiment under James Strange, but this is probably a mistake. Geography According to the BC Geographical Names, the northern boundary of Queen Charlotte Strait is defined as a line running Cape Sutil, at the north end of Vancouver Island, to Cape Caution on the mainland. The southern end of Queen Charlotte Strait is described as \\"several narrow channels north and east of Malcolm Island\\". The strait lies between the mainland and Vancouver Island portions of the Regional District of Mount Waddington, a form of regional municipal governance with power over zoning, building and sewer permits and inter-municipal integration. Most communities in the region, however, are Indian reserve communities of the Kwakwaka ºwakw peoples which are outside the jurisdiction of regional district governance. The traditional territories of most of the various Kwakwaka'wakw peoples overlap in the strait, which is a vital fishery resource and transportation link between their communities.

Eastern freshwater cod in turn are a species of Maccullochella cod found in east coast drainages and originating from Murray cod, Maccullochella peelii, that crossed the Great Dividing Range and entered east coast drainages from a river capture event between 0.62 and 1.62 million years ago (mean estimate 1.1 million years ago). Richmond River cod are extinct, from overfishing, habitat destruction including gross siltation, and whole-of-catchment scale bushfires and fish kills in the 1930s.

The Brisbane River Cod was known as the Bumgur (meaning blue cod) by the Jinibara people centred in the Kilcoy region and the junction of the Stanley and Brisbane Rivers. Their exact taxonomic status is not known, but based on several genetic studies it is suspected that Brisbane River Cod were a species intermediate between eastern freshwater cod (Maccullochella ikei) of the Clarence River and Richmond River systems in northern New South Wales and Mary River cod of the Mary River in central Queensland. All naturally occurring Maccullochella cod in east coast drainages ultimately originate from Murray cod, Maccullochella peelii that entered an east coast river system, likely the Clarence, via a natural river capture event somewhere between 0.62 and 1.62 million years ago (mean estimate 1.1 million years ago), as estimated by DNA divergence rates. Brisbane River cod are extinct, from overfishing, habitat destruction and siltation, and whole- of-catchment scale bushfires and ash fish kills in the 1930s. The Brisbane River has now been restocked with Mary River cod from the Mary River system. References * Anon. (2004). New South Wales Eastern (Freshwater) Cod (Maccullochella ikei) Recovery Plan.

Biography Albert Dubout was born in Marseille. After attending school at N√Æmes (where he met Jean Paulhan) he studied at the fine arts school in Montpellier where he met his first wife, Ren√©e Altier, and where his first drawings were published in the student journal ' in 1923. After moving to Paris, literary director Philippe Soupault was the first to hire him to illustrate a book, ' by Nicolas Boileau- Despr√©aux. Dubout continued on to illustrate numerous editions of books by Boileau, Beaumarchais, M√©rim√©e, Rabelais, Villon, Cervantes, Balzac, Racine, Voltaire, Rostand, Poe, and Courteline. He collaborated on numerous magazines and journals such as Le Rire, Marianne, Eclats de Rire, L'os √† Mo√´lle, Paris- Soir, and Ici-Paris. He also created movie and theatre posters as well as theatrical sets. He worked in advertising, painted oil canvases (over 70 in total) and illustrated many book covers and record sleeves. Albert Dubout also illustrated Gargantua and Pantagruel, oeuvres of the famous French satirist Rabelais. One of his favorite and perhaps unwilling models were an obese tobacconist and the small and scrawny tax collector who lived in the forties and fifties in Agde, Herault, France. In 1953, French president Vincent Auriol awarded him the Legion of Honour. His name also appeared that year in the Petit Larousse dictionary. In 1965, he illustrated the San-Antonio book series, at the request of author Fr√©d√©ric Dard. In 1967 he married his second wife, Suzanne Ballivet, who was also a painter. He divided his time in this period between M√©zy-sur-Seine, near Paris, and Palavas-les-Flots, on the south coast, until his death in 1976. In 1992, a museum about Dubout was dedicated in Palavas-les-Flots.

The novel is written as a first-person narrative by the main character, Liz Dunn. The novel centres on changes to Liz's life when someone from her past unexpectedly re-enters her life. It is written in a light, often comic, tone, but resonates on many deeper issues, including loneliness, family, religious visions and multiple sclerosis. Plot Two distinct plot movements are separated by a break in the narrative flow. The first part of the novel involves two retellings: the story of Liz Dunn‚Äôs trip to Europe and her pregnancy, and the story of the re-emergence into her life of her child, Jeremy, who is dying of multiple sclerosis. As a teenager, Liz goes on a trip to Europe, her one big expressive moment. On this trip, while drunk, she loses her virginity in Italy to a man she cannot remember. From this experience, she becomes pregnant with Jeremy, who is put up for adoption, and goes in and out of foster families for much of his young life. Jeremy arrives back into Liz‚Äôs life when she is at a low point of loneliness. His illness is terminal, and because of drug abuse, he has only a short time to live. Jeremy‚Äôs introduction into Liz‚Äôs life rattles the lonely world she has constructed, opening up her and her world. The first part of the novel, narrated by Liz, jumps between these two moments, constantly reminding the reader that these are moments in the past. There is a symbolic page break between the first section, which takes place in the past, and the second section, which takes place in the novel‚Äôs present. In the present, Jeremy has died. Liz finds a meteorite that she takes to be a very precious object. She sleeps with it under her pillow to keep it close. She eventually, through a list of circumstances, decides to travel to Europe to find Jeremy‚Äôs father, a trip which again leads her to a world of excitement, police and army incidents, and a reunion with Jeremy‚Äôs father. Characters =Liz Dunn= Liz Dunn is the protagonist of this novel. She is an overweight, lonely woman, who lives a removed solitary existence. Her apartment, for instance, can only accommodate one person. Coupland has spoken extensively about the character of Liz Dunn, claiming that she was his most realistic character. =Jeremy= Liz‚Äôs son Jeremy, who was sent out for adoption, has a terminal case of multiple sclerosis. He has traveled through the foster-care system of British Columbia, residing with many families who abused him. He eventually reconnects with Liz after finding her and registers her as his next of kin for emergencies. When he is hospitalized, Liz reconnects with her son. Jeremy is cheerful in the face of his condition, happy with the life that he has left to lead. He eventually becomes a successful mattress salesman in the time leading up to his death. He experiences visions of a post-apocalyptic future, which enthralls Liz. He envisions a future where crops have gone foul and farmers ask a divine voice for guidance. Inspiration =Loneliness= The inspiration for Eleanor Rigby was loneliness. Coupland suffered through a period in his early twenties he describes as being caused by loneliness.\\"Dealing with the X factor\\". \\"The Age\\", July 30, 2005. =The title= The novel is named after The Beatles' song of the same name. The song reference was inspired from a moment in Coupland's past. Coupland heard the song \\"on a friend's mother's record player. And the story threw me: 'Oh my God, what happened to her?' The lyrics didn't tell you much but in my head I always saw her as an only child of very old parents who didn't have a clue and she was left in a rectory and died without leaving any mark anywhere ... The book's not like that, of course, but it's the mood and the way Liz describes herself.\\" The song itself features in the narrative as it is Liz Dunn's email address.

A Rubber Chicken is a prop used in comedy. The phrase is also used as a description for food served at speeches, conventions, and other large meetings, and as a metaphor for speechmaking. Description Rubber Chicken in the back of a truck A Rubber Chicken is an imitation plucked fowl made in a latex injection mold.  Origins  The origin of the Rubber Chicken is obscure, but is possibly based on the use of Pig Bladders, which were inflated, attached to a stick and used as props or mock-weapons by jesters in the days before the development of plastic and latex. Chicken corpses were readily available; therefore jesters could employ them as variations of slapsticks. One account attributes the first use of a prop chicken to John Holmberg, the Swedish black-faced clown of the early 1900s. Holmberg would perform with his pockets full of fake food to mock the gluttony reportedly prevalent among the upper classes at the time.Buck Wolf, Flight of the Floppy Fowl, ABCNews.com, 2000. A claim that the symbol originated during the French Revolution with soldiers hanging a chicken from their muskets for luck is printed on the tag of rubber chickens manufactured by Archie McPhee. Food and speechmaking The term \\"Rubber Chicken\\" is used disparagingly to describe the food served at political or corporate events, weddings, and other gatherings where there are a large number of guests who require serving in a short timeframe. Often, pre-cooked chicken is held at serving temperature for some time and then dressed with a sauce as it is served. Consequently, the meat may be tough or \\"rubbery\\". Someone who \\"travels the Rubber Chicken circuit\\" is said to do so by attending or making speeches at many such gatherings, often as part of political campaigning. Rubber chickens in the news  * At the staging of Ionesco's The Killing Game, theatre critic Gerhard Stadelmaier was sworn at and had a Rubber Chicken thrown at him by actor Thomas Lawinky, who later offered his resignation.BBC News, Fake bird row hits German play, February 23, 2006. * In 2009, a film depicting a sex act on a Rubber Chicken was posted online by an AFL player.\\"Roos pull 'sick' video off net\\" The Age, April 8, 2009\\"AFL club North Melbourne investigates rubber chicken sex film\\", April 8, 2009 * In 2012, a team of students at NASA used a helium balloon to launch a Rubber Chicken (an observatory mascot) equipped with film badge dosimeters into a solar storm to take measurements of the radiation levels. *In 2018, Archie McPhee opened a Rubber Chicken Museum in Seattle featuring the world's largest and world's smallest rubber chickens.

Owned by iHeartMedia, Inc., the station serves the New Orleans metropolitan area. The WRNO-FM studios are located in Downtown New Orleans, while the station transmitter resides in the Bayou Bienvenue Central Wetland District near Chalmette. Besides a standard analog transmission, WRNO-FM broadcasts over two HD Radio channels, and is available online via iHeartRadio. The WRNO-HD2 digital subchannel, which airs a classic hip-hop format, also simulcasts over a low-power FM translator. History On October 17, 1967, WRNO first signed on.Broadcasting Yearbook 1969 page B-75 It was a stand-alone FM station, put on the air by Gulf South Broadcasters, with Joseph Costello III as the owner and general manager. The station had its studios at 3230 Patterson Drive. It was a network affiliate of the Mutual Broadcasting System and aired a progressive rock format. Although its previous slogan was \\"We're the Rock of New Orleans,\\" the station's call letters actually stand for \\"Westbank Radio New Orleans.\\" The station operated a popular business selling rock t-shirts, records and other music related items called the WRNO \\"Rock Shop\\" on the ground level of the studio. Since its inception in 1967, WRNO moved from progressive to album rock in the 1980s, and switched to Classic Rock in 1997. WRNO was also home to a popular shortwave radio service in the 1980s and 1990s called WRNO Worldwide, now owned by a Christian broadcaster. In 1998, WRNO was acquired by Centennial Broadcasting.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2000 page D-196 Then in 2002, the station changed hands again, acquired by San Antonio-based Clear Channel Communications, the forerunner to today's owner, iHeartMedia, Inc.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2010 page D-256 On November 13, 2006, at 4 AM, after signing off with The Doors' \\"The End,\\" WRNO flipped from rock music to a talk radio format as \\"The New 99.5FM.com.\\" As explained in the official mission statement posted at its website, \\"The station is committed to providing listeners with everything they need to know on the radio at 99.5 FM and on demand at thenew995fm.com.\\" On the same day sister station KHEV became \\"The Rock of New Orleans,\\" using it as the new slogan for that station's switch from Urban Gospel to Active Rock. On April 1, 2008, WRNO changed its slogan to \\"Rush Radio,\\" with all day repeats of The Rush Limbaugh Show. It also played a tape loop of Rush's theme song, the instrumental from My City Was Gone by The Pretenders, during times when the show was not playing. The stunt was to celebrate WRNO's acquisition of the show from longtime affiliate WWL. WRNO resumed its regular schedule on April 7, with Limbaugh heard from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. weekdays plus a repeat on Saturdays. The Limbaugh program had previously aired on WRNO Worldwide, which Limbaugh called \\"The EIB World Service\\" on the air (in joking reference to the BBC World Service).

He is well known for his work on the Fox action series 24 alongside the Showtime thriller Homeland, which he co-developed with Alex Gansa and Gideon Raff, and for the FX political drama Tyrant, which he co-developed with Craig Wright. He also produced the NBC science fiction thriller Awake. Life and career Gordon was born to a Reform Jewish familyTablet Magazine: \\"‚ÄòHomeland‚Äô and ‚Äò24‚Äô Creator Howard Gordon on Terror, Tyranny, and TV as Art\\" by Alana Newhouse and Liel Leibovitz September 30, 2013Jewish Journal: \\"Jews Get Geek on at Comic-Con\\" by Adam Wills July 22, 2009 in Queens, New York City and graduated from Roslyn High School. After graduating from Princeton with a major in creative writing in 1984, Gordon came to Los Angeles with fellow filmmaker Alex Gansa to pursue a career in writing for television. Both broke into the industry with single episodes of ABC's Spenser: For Hire. Their Spenser work turned industry heads, and the pair joined the series Beauty and the Beast as staff writers, and were later named producers. In 1990, the Gansa-Gordon team was signed to a two-year deal with Witt-Thomas Productions, during which they produced several pilots. One was an ABC project called Country Estates, which caught the attention of producer Chris Carter. Soon after, Carter invited Gordon and Gansa to join The X-Files as supervising producers; Gordon wrote or co-wrote several scripts each season, before departing from the series in 1997 to pursue other projects. After co-writing one episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Gordon created his own show, the short-lived Strange World in 1999. Strange World went to seed 13 episodes in, but Gordon and Strange World writer Tim Minear's services were quickly snapped up by Buffy creator Joss Whedon on another project: Angel. After two years with Angel, Gordon jumped ship in 2001 for FOX's successful 24, where he would write several episodes in Seasons 1 & 2, then crafted the entire story arcs for Seasons 3 and 4. Gordon temporarily left 24 in the middle of the 2004 season to re-join Minear, this time as co-creator of another FOX series, The Inside. Despite The Inside 's cancellation and short run, talk circulated of including the two Minear-Gordon series, Strange World and The Inside, on a special DVD set sometime in 2006. Beginning in 2006, Gordon became 24's showrunner, a title he held through its final season. In 2019, after a stint at Fox through Teakwood Lane Productions, he signed a deal with Sony. Gordon is also the author of the Gideon Davis novels. =Homeland= In 2010, after finishing 24, Gordon began co-developing (along with Gideon Raff and Alex Gansa) the thriller Homeland for Showtime. Based on the Israeli series Prisoners of War, it centers on a woman (Claire Danes) who works for the CIA and is convinced a recently returned American prisoner of war (Damian Lewis) has been turned by al-Qaeda. The show premiered Sunday, October 2, 2011, at 10/9 central. It has been met with major critical acclaim and maintained a steady viewership rating throughout its first season. Showtime premiered its fourth season on October 5, 2014.List of Homeland episodes In 2012, he won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series for writing the \\"Pilot\\" of Homeland and the series itself won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series. =Awake= In 2011, Gordon signed on to NBC's new Kyle Killen fantasy pilot Awake as an executive producer. When NBC picked the project up to series status, Gordon added writer and showrunner to his occupational duties on the show. The series only ran from March 1 to May 24, 2012 before it was cancelled. =Second Chance= Most recently, 2015 would see him working as an executive producer on the horror-drama series Second Chance for Fox Television Network. The pilot for Second Chance is based on a script written by Rand Ravich, who also worked as an executive producer on the series.

There are three subfamilies of klotho: Œ±-klotho, Œ≤-klotho, and Œ≥-klotho. Œ±-klotho activates FGF23, and Œ≤-klotho activates FGF19 and FGF21. When the subfamily is not specified, the word \\"klotho\\" generally means the Œ±-klotho subfamily. Klotho can exist in a membrane-bound form or a (hormonal) soluble, circulating form. Proteases can convert the membrane-bound form into the circulating form. The KL gene encodes a type-I membrane protein that is related to Œ≤-glucuronidases. Reduced production of this protein has been observed in patients with chronic kidney failure (CKF), and this may be one of the factors underlying the degenerative processes (e.g., arteriosclerosis, osteoporosis, and skin atrophy) seen in CKF. Also, mutations within this protein have been associated with ageing, bone loss and alcohol consumption. Transgenic mice that overexpress Klotho live longer than wild-type mice.  Function  Klotho is a transmembrane protein that, in addition to other effects, provides some control over the sensitivity of the organism to insulin and appears to be involved in ageing. Its discovery was documented in 1997 by Makoto Kuro-o et al. The name of the gene comes from Klotho or Clotho, one of the Moirai, or Fates, in Greek mythology. The klotho protein is a novel Œ≤-glucuronidase (EC number 3.2.1.31) capable of hydrolyzing steroid Œ≤-glucuronides. Genetic variants in KLOTHO have been associated with human aging, and klotho protein has been shown to be a circulating factor detectable in serum that declines with age. The binding of certain fibroblast growth factors (FGF's, viz., FGF19 and FGF21) to their fibroblast growth factor receptors, is promoted via their interactions as co-receptors with Œ≤-klotho. Œ±-klotho changes cellular calcium homeostasis, by both increasing the expression and activity of TRPV5 (decreasing phosphate reabsorption in the kidney) and decreasing that of TRPC6 (decreasing phosphate absorption from the intestine). Œ±-klotho increases kidney calcium reabsorption by stabilizing TPRV5.  Clinical significance  Œ±-klotho can suppress oxidative stress and inflammation, thereby reducing endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Blood plasma Œ±-klotho is increased by aerobic exercise, thereby reducing endothelial dysfunction. Œ≤-klotho activation of FGF21 protein has a protective effect on heart muscle cells. Obesity is characterized by FGF21 resistance, believed to be caused by the inhibition of Œ≤-klotho by the inflammatory cell signalling protein (cytokine) tumor necrosis factor alpha. Klotho is required for oligodendrocyte maturation, myelin integrity, and can protect neurons from toxic effects. Mice deficient in klotho have a reduced number of synapses and cognitive deficits, whereas mice overexpressing klotho have enhanced learning and memory. It has been found that the decreased klotho expression may be due to DNA hypermethylation, which may have been induced by the overexpression of DNMT3a. Klotho may be a reliable gene for early detection of methylation changes in oral tissues, and can be used as a target for therapeutic modification in oral cancer during the early stages. Klotho-deficient mice manifest a syndrome resembling accelerated human ageing and display extensive and accelerated arteriosclerosis. Additionally, they exhibit impaired endothelium dependent vasodilation and impaired angiogenesis, suggesting that klotho protein may protect the cardiovascular system through endothelium-derived NO production.  Effects on aging  Mice lacking either fibroblast growth factor 23 or the Œ±-klotho enzyme display premature aging due to hyperphosphatemia. Many of these symptoms can be alleviated by feeding the mice a low phosphate diet. Although the vast majority of research has been based on lack of klotho, it was demonstrated that an over-expression of klotho in mice might extend their average life span between 19% and 31% compared to normal mice. In addition, variations in the Klotho gene (SNP Rs9536314) are associated with both life extension and increased cognition in human populations. Klotho increases membrane expression of the inward rectifier ATP-dependent potassium channel ROMK. Klotho-deficient mice show increased production of vitamin D, and altered mineral-ion homeostasis is suggested to be a cause of premature aging‚Äëlike phenotypes, because the lowering of vitamin D activity by dietary restriction reverses the premature aging‚Äëlike phenotypes and prolongs survival in these mutants. These results suggest that aging‚Äëlike phenotypes were due to klotho-associated vitamin D metabolic abnormalities (hypervitaminosis). Klotho is an antagonist of the Wnt signaling pathway, and chronic Wnt stimulation can lead to stem cell depletion and aging.

The fall and rise of the English Bulldog. American Scientist; Research Triangle Park Vol. 84, Ed. 3, (May 1996): 220.The main locations in London for these exhibitions were the Westminster Pit, Beargarden and Old Conduit Fields. One of the breeders who spanned the transition period between the Old English Bulldog and the modern Bulldog was famous dog dealer Bill George. = Breeding = Old English Bulldog. Paris, 1863. Historians are fairly confident that the Old English Bulldog is derived from ancient war dogs, such as the old Mastiff or the extinct Alaunt dog. Others believe that the true origin of the breed is not entirely clear. Depictions in old prints show that the variety was without doubt a small Mastiff with a comparatively long head. The word 'Mastiff' was eventually dropped when describing these smaller Mastiffs, as the Mastiff proper was found too slow for bull-baiting. Eventually, the Greyhound was crossed into the breed, increasing the Mastiff's speed without losing the breed's ferocity. This step reduced the Old English Bulldog's size and weight, with the Greyhound's features seen in specimens of that time. = Description = Two other recognized members of the breed can be seen in the 1817 painting Crib and Rosa, with Rosa exemplifying the form and size of the ideal type of Old English Bulldog, albeit deficient in wrinkles about the head and neck and in substance of bone in the limbs. They are faster than regular bulldogs and have an average speed of . Many authors bring us descriptions about the extinct bulldog, but a description stands out as one of the most extensive by William Hamilton Maxwell: Kennel boy and bulldogs, 1843. A pure bulldog, 1859. Old English Bulldog. Paris, 1863. Prick ears. = Decline = Wasp, Child and Billy In England, the passage of the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835 caused a decline of bull-baiting and dog fighting, leading to a lack of interest in perpetuating the Old English Bulldog. Three dogs from the Duke of Hamilton's strain of Old English Bulldog, Wasp, Child, and Billy, were depicted in a painting and recognized as some of the last known members of the breed before it became extinct. Despite the laws making dog fighting illegal, the activity continued for many years. Breeders determined a cross between the Old English Bulldog and Old English Terrier created a superior fighting dog with increased quickness and dexterity. This new breed of dog, called the bull and terrier, was a precursor to the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Bull Terrier and American Pit Bull Terrier and accelerated the extinction of the Old English Bulldog.  Reincarnations  Several breeders are attempting to recreate this extinct breed, using known descendants of the Old English Bulldog lineage, with some success. As the breed went extinct long before DNA was recognized and little genetic material has survived, it is unclear how much the modern reincarnations of the breed resemble the original Old English Bulldog, and most of the recreations have purposely introduced differences in the breed compared to the original, most prominently reducing the breed's violent nature. One contemporary recreation of the breed started in the 1970s, using a breeding program developed for cattle at Ohio State University. The lineage has since split into two, known as the Olde English Bulldogge and the Leavitt Bulldog, the Leavitt Bulldog being a lighter, more athletic dog. These modern day versions, though possessing similar physical abilities, do not have the violent temperament of the Old English Bulldog. The line-breeding was done with a foundation of half Bulldog, and the other half consisting of one-sixth Bullmastiff, one-sixth American Bulldog and one-sixth American Pit Bull Terrier. = Others = There are several other recreations, including the Continental Bulldog.  Bulldog  Often confused with the Old English Bulldog, the Bulldog is noted for its sweet disposition; however, it has maintained little of the speed and agility that were the definitive characteristics of the Old English Bulldog.

Robert E. Lee attempted to capitalize on his first day's success. His Army of Northern Virginia launched multiple attacks on the flanks of the Union Army of the Potomac, commanded by Maj. Gen. George G. Meade. The assaults were unsuccessful, and resulted in heavy casualties for both sides. After a short delay to assemble his forces and avoid detection in his approach march, Lt. Gen. James Longstreet attacked with his First Corps against the Union left flank. His division under Maj. Gen. John Bell Hood attacked Little Round Top and Devil's Den. To Hood's left, Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws attacked the Wheatfield and the Peach Orchard. Although neither prevailed, the Union III Corps was effectively destroyed as a combat organization as it attempted to defend a salient over too wide a front. Gen. Meade rushed as many as 20,000 reinforcements from elsewhere in his line to resist these fierce assaults. The attacks in this sector concluded with an unsuccessful assault by the Confederate Third Corps division of Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson against the Union center on Cemetery Ridge. That evening, Confederate Second Corps commander Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell turned demonstrations against the Union right flank into full-scale assaults on Culp's Hill and East Cemetery Hill, but both were repulsed. The Union army had occupied strong defensive positions, and Meade handled his forces well, resulting in heavy losses for both sides, but leaving the disposition of forces on both sides essentially unchanged. Lee's hope of crushing the Army of the Potomac on Northern territory was dashed, but undaunted, he began to plan for the third day of fighting. This article includes details of many attacks on the Union left flank (Devil's Den, the Wheatfield, and the Peach Orchard) and center (Cemetery Ridge), but separate articles describe other major engagements in this massive battle of the second day: * Little Round Top * Culp's Hill * Cemetery Hill Background =Military situation= Opposing forces =Union= =Confederate= Lee's plan and movement to battle By the morning of July 2, six of the seven corps of the Army of the Potomac had arrived on the battlefield. The I Corps (Maj. Gen. John Newton, replacing Abner Doubleday) and the XI Corps (Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard) had fought hard on the first day, and they were joined that evening by the yet-unengaged troops of the XII Corps (Maj. Gen. Henry W. Slocum), III Corps (Maj. Gen. Daniel E. Sickles), and II Corps (Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock), and on the morning of July 2 by the V Corps (Maj. Gen. George Sykes). The VI Corps (Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick) was still 30 miles (50 km) away in Manchester, Maryland, on that morning. They assumed positions in a fish hook shape about three miles (5 km ) long, from Culp's Hill, around to Cemetery Hill, and down the spine of Cemetery Ridge. The Army of Northern Virginia line was roughly parallel to the Union's, on Seminary Ridge and on an arc northwest, north, and northeast of the town of Gettysburg. All of the Second Corps (Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell) and Third Corps (Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill) were present, and the First Corps (Lt. Gen. James Longstreet) was arriving from Cashtown; only Longstreet's division under George E. Pickett did not participate in the battle on July 2.Pfanz, Battle of Gettysburg, p. 21. Eicher, p. 521. Pfanz, Second Day, pp. 55-81. Robert E. Lee had several choices to consider for his next move. His order of the previous evening that Ewell occupy Culp's Hill or Cemetery Hill \\"if practicable\\" was not realized, and the Union army was now in strong defensive positions with compact interior lines. His senior subordinate, Longstreet, counseled a strategic move--the Army should leave its current position, swing around the Union left flank, and interpose itself on Meade's lines of communication, inviting an attack by Meade that could be received on advantageous ground. Longstreet argued that this was the entire point of the Gettysburg campaign, to move strategically into enemy territory but fight only defensive battles there. Lee rejected this argument because he was concerned about the morale of his soldiers having to give up the ground for which they fought so hard the day before. He wanted to retain the initiative and had a high degree of confidence in the ability of his army to succeed in any endeavor, an opinion bolstered by their spectacular victories the previous day and at Chancellorsville. He was therefore determined to attack on July 2.Pfanz, Battle of Gettysburg, p. 21. Pfanz, Second Day, pp. 26-29. Lee's plan for July 2 Lee wanted to seize the high ground south of Gettysburg, primarily Cemetery Hill, which dominated the town, the Union supply lines, and the road to Washington, D.C., and he believed an attack up the Emmitsburg Road would be the best approach. He desired an early-morning assault by Longstreet's Corps, reinforced by Ewell, who would move his Corps from its current location north of town to join Longstreet. Ewell protested this arrangement, claiming his men would be demoralized if forced to move from the ground they had captured.Pfanz, Second Day, pp. 61, 111-12. And Longstreet protested that his division commanded by John Bell Hood had not arrived completely (and that Pickett's division had not arrived at all).Pfanz, Second Day, p. 112. Lee compromised with his subordinates. Ewell would remain in place and conduct a demonstration (a minor diversionary attack) against Culp's Hill, pinning down the right flank of the Union defenders so that they could not reinforce their left, where Longstreet would launch the primary attack as soon as he was ready. Ewell's demonstration would be turned into a full-scale assault if the opportunity presented itself.Pfanz, Second Day, pp. 113-14. Lee ordered Longstreet to launch a surprise attack with two divisions straddling, and guiding on, the Emmitsburg Road.Pfanz, Second Day, p. 153. Hood's division would move up the eastern side of the road, Lafayette McLaws's the western side, each perpendicular to it. The objective was to strike the Union Army in an oblique attack, rolling up their left flank, collapsing the line of Union corps onto each other, and seizing Cemetery Hill.Harman, p. 27. The Third Corps division of Richard H. Anderson would join the attack against the center of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge at the appropriate time. This plan was based on faulty intelligence because of the absence of J.E.B. Stuart and his cavalry, leaving Lee with an incomplete understanding of the position of his enemy. He believed that the left flank of the Union army was adjacent to the Emmitsburg Road hanging \\"in the air\\" (unsupported by any natural barrier), and an early morning scouting expedition seemed to confirm that.Pfanz, Second Day, pp. 106-07. In reality, by dawn of July 2 the Union line stretched the length of Cemetery Ridge and anchored at the foot of the imposing Little Round Top. Lee's plan was doomed from its conception, as Meade's line occupied only a small portion of the Emmitsburg Road near the town itself. Any force attacking up the road would find two entire Union corps and their guns posted on the ridge to their immediate right flank. By midday, however, Union general Sickles would change all that.Hall, pp. 89, 97. =Sickles repositions= Sickles spurs ahead of his staff to inspect the front lines of his threatened III Corps at the tip of the Peach Orchard salient. Confederates can be seen massing for an attack by the fringe of trees in the distance. Painting (The battle of Gettysburg) by Edwin Forbes. When Sickles arrived with his III Corps, General Meade instructed him to take up a position on Cemetery Ridge that linked up with the II Corps on his right and anchored his left on Little Round Top. Sickles originally did so, but after noon he became concerned about a slightly higher piece of ground 0.7 miles (1,100 m) to his front, a peach orchard owned by the Sherfy family. He undoubtedly recalled the debacle at Chancellorsville, where the high ground (\\"Hazel Grove\\") he was forced to give up was used against him as a deadly Confederate artillery platform. Acting without authorization from Meade, Sickles marched his corps to occupy the peach orchard. This had two significant negative consequences: his position now took the form of a salient, which could be attacked from multiple sides; and he was forced to occupy lines that were much longer than his two-division corps could defend. Meade rode to the III Corps position and impatiently explained ‚ÄúGeneral Sickles, this is neutral ground, our guns command it, as well as the enemy‚Äôs. The very reason you cannot hold it applies to them.‚Äù Sears p. 263 Meade was furious about this insubordination, but it was too late to do anything about it--the Confederate attack was imminent.Eicher, pp. 523-24. Pfanz, Second Day, pp. 21-25. =Longstreet delayed= Longstreet's attack was delayed, however, because he first had to wait for his final brigade (Evander M. Law's, Hood's division) to arrive, and then he was forced to march on a long, circuitous route that could not be seen by Union Army Signal Corps observers on Little Round Top. It was 4 p.m. by the time his two divisions reached their jumping off points, and then he and his generals were astonished to find the III Corps planted directly in front of them on the Emmitsburg Road. Hood argued with Longstreet that this new situation demanded a change in tactics; he wanted to swing around, below and behind, Round Top and hit the Union Army in the rear. Longstreet, however, refused to consider such a modification to Lee's order.Pfanz, Second Day, pp. 119-23. Even so, and partly because of Sickles's unexpected location, Longstreet's assault did not proceed according to Lee's plan. Instead of wheeling left to join a simultaneous two-division push on either side of the Emmitsburg Road, Hood's division attacked in a more easterly direction than intended, and McLaws's and Anderson's divisions deployed brigade by brigade, in an en echelon style of attack, also heading more to the east than the intended northeast.Harman, pp. 50-51. Hood's assault The first wave of Hood's assault Longstreet's attack commenced with a 30-minute artillery barrage by 36 guns that was particularly punishing to the Union infantry in the Peach Orchard and the troops and batteries on Houck's Ridge. Maj. Gen. John Bell Hood's division deployed in Biesecker's Woods on Warfield Ridge (the southern extension of Seminary Ridge) in two lines of two brigades each: at the left front, Brig. Gen. Jerome B. Robertson's Texas Brigade (Hood's old unit); right front, Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law; left rear, Brig. Gen. George T. Anderson; right rear, Brig. Gen. Henry L. Benning.Eicher, pp. 524-25. Pfanz, Second Day, pp. 158-67. At 4:30 p.m., Hood stood in his stirrups at the front of the Texas Brigade and shouted, \\"Fix bayonets, my brave Texans! Forward and take those heights!\\" It is unclear to which heights he was referring. His orders were to cross the Emmitsburg Road and wheel left, moving north with his left flank guiding on the road. This discrepancy became a serious problem when, minutes later on Slyder's Lane, Hood was felled by an artillery shell bursting overhead, severely wounding his left arm and putting him out of action. His division moved ahead to the east, no longer under central control.Eicher, pp. 524-25. Pfanz, Second Day, pp. 167-74. There were four probable reasons for the deviation in the division's direction: first, regiments from the III Corps were unexpectedly in the Devil's Den area and they would threaten Hood's right flank if they were not dealt with; second, fire from the 2nd U.S. Sharpshooters at Slyder's farm drew the attention of lead elements of Law's Brigade, moving in pursuit and drawing his brigade to the right; third, the terrain was rough and units naturally lost their parade-ground alignments; finally, Hood's senior subordinate, Gen. Law, was unaware that he was now in command of the division, so he could not exercise control.Harman, pp. 55-56. Eicher, p. 526. The two lead brigades split their advances into two directions, although not on brigade boundaries. The 1st Texas and 3rd Arkansas of Robertson's brigade and the 44th and 48th Alabama of Law's brigade headed in the direction of Devil's Den, while Law directed the remaining five regiments toward the Round Tops.Eicher, p. 526. Pfanz, Second Day, p. 174. Confederate dead in the \\"Slaughter Pen\\" at the foot of Big Round Top. See W. Frassanito: \\"Gettysburg A Jounry in Time\\", pp. 174-176 Dead Confederate soldier in the \\"Slaughter Pen\\" at the foot of Big Round Top. See W. Frassanito: \\"Early Photography at Gettysburg\\", pp.287-289 Two pictures of a group of Confederate dead in woods near the \\"Slaughter Pen\\" at the foot of Big Round Top. See W. Frassanito: \\"Early Photography at Gettysburg\\", pp.289-294 =Devil's Den= Devil's Den was located at the extreme left of the III Corps line, manned by the large brigade (six regiments and two companies of sharpshooters, 2,200 men in all) of Brigadier General J. H. Hobart Ward, in Maj. Gen. David B. Birney's division. It was the southern end of Houck's Ridge, a modest elevation on the northwest side of Plum Run Valley, made distinctive by piles of huge boulders. These boulders were not the direct avenue of approach used by the Confederates. The 3rd Arkansas and the 1st Texas drove through Rose Woods and hit Ward's line head-on. His troops had lacked the time or inclination to erect breastworks, and for over an hour both sides participated in a standup fight of unusual ferocity. In the first 30 minutes, the 20th Indiana lost more than half of its men. Its colonel, John Wheeler, was killed and its lieutenant colonel wounded. The 86th New York also lost its commander. The commander of the 3rd Arkansas fell wounded, one of 182 casualties in his regiment.Adelman and Smith, pp. 22-23. Eicher, p. 527. Pfanz, Second Day, pp. 177-83. Meanwhile, the two regiments from Law's brigade that had split from the column advancing to the Round Tops pushed up Plum Run Valley and threatened to turn Ward's flank. Their target was the 4th Maine and the 124th New York, defending the 4th New York Independent artillery battery commanded by Captain James Smith, whose fire was causing considerable disruption in Law's brigade's advance. The pressure grew great enough that Ward needed to call the 99th Pennsylvania from his far right to reinforce his left. The commander of the 124th New York, Colonel Augustus Van Horne Ellis, and his major, James Cromwell, decided to counterattack. They mounted their horses despite the protests of soldiers who urged them to lead more safely on foot. Maj. Cromwell said, \\"The men must see us today.\\" They led the charge of their \\"Orange Blossoms\\" regiment to the west, down the slope of Houck's Ridge through a triangular field surrounded by a low stone fence, sending the 1st Texas reeling back . But both Colonel Ellis and Major Cromwell were shot dead as the Texans rallied with a massed volley; and the New Yorkers retreated to their starting point, with only 100 survivors from the 283 they started with. As reinforcements from the 99th Pennsylvania arrived, Ward's brigade retook the crest.Adelman and Smith, pp. 29-43. Eicher, p. 527. Pfanz, Second Day, pp. 185-94. The second wave of Hood's assault was the brigades of Henry Benning and George \\"Tige\\" Anderson. They detected a gap in Birney's division line: to Ward's right, there was a considerable gap before the brigade of R√©gis de Trobriand began. Anderson's line smashed into Trobriand and the gap at the southern edge of the Wheatfield. Trobriand wrote that the Confederates \\"converged on me like an avalanche, but we piled all the dead and wounded men in our front.\\" The Union defense was fierce, and Anderson's brigade pulled back; its commander was wounded in the leg and was carried from the battle.Sears, pp. 274-75. Two of Benning's Confederate regiments, the 2nd and 17th Georgia, moved down Plum Run Valley around Ward's flank. They received murderous fire from the 99th Pennsylvania and Hazlett's battery on Little Round Top, but they kept pushing forward. Capt. Smith's New York battery was under severe pressure from three sides, but its supporting infantry regiments were suffering severe casualties and could not protect it. Three 10-pound Parrott rifles were lost to the 1st Texas, and they were used against Union troops the next day.Adelman and Smith, pp. 46-48. Birney scrambled to find reinforcements. He sent the 40th New York and 6th New Jersey from the Wheatfield into Plum Run Valley to block the approach into Ward's flank. They collided with Benning's and Law's men in rocky, broken ground that the survivors would remember as the \\"Slaughter Pen\\". (Plum Run itself was known as \\"Bloody Run\\"; Plum Run Valley as the \\"Valley of Death\\".) Col. Thomas W. Egan, commanding the 40th New York, was called on by Smith to recover his guns. The men of the \\"Mozart\\" regiment slammed into the 2nd and 17th Georgia regiments, with initial success. As Ward's line along Houck's Ridge continued to collapse, the position manned by the 40th became increasingly untenable. However, Egan pressed his regiment onward, according to Col. Wesley Hodges of the 17th Georgia, launching seven attacks against the Confederate positions within the boulders of Slaughter Pen and Devil's Den. As the men of the 40th fell back under relentless pressure, the 6th New Jersey covered their withdrawal and lost a third of its men in the process.Gottfried, pp. 205-206; Adelman and Smith, pp. 46-48. The pressure on Ward's brigade was eventually too great, and he was forced to call for a retreat. Hood's division secured Devil's Den and the southern part of Houck's Ridge. The center of the fighting shifted to the northwest, to Rose Woods and the Wheatfield, while five regiments under Evander Law assaulted Little Round Top to the east. Benning's men spent the next 22 hours on Devil's Den, firing across the Valley of Death on Union troops massed on Little Round Top.Adelman and Smith, pp. 48-62. Of 2,423 Union troops engaged, there were 821 casualties (138 killed, 548 wounded, 135 missing); the 5,525 Confederates lost 1,814 (329, 1,107, 378).Adelman and Smith, p. 134. =Little Round Top= The Confederate assaults on Little Round Top were some of the most famous of the three-day battle and the Civil War. Arriving just as the Confederates approached, Col. Strong Vincent's brigade of the V Corps mounted a spirited defense of this position, the extreme left of the Union line, against furious assaults up the rocky slope. The stand of the 20th Maine under Col. Joshua L. Chamberlain against the 15th Alabama (Col. William C. Oates) is particularly storied, but heroes such as Strong Vincent, Patrick \\"Paddy\\" O'Rorke, and Charles E. Hazlett also made names for themselves. McLaws's assault Lafayette McLaws arranged his division on Warfield Ridge similar to Hood's on his right--two lines of two brigades each: left front, facing the Peach Orchard, the brigade of Brig. Gen. William Barksdale; right front, Brig. Gen. Joseph B. Kershaw; left rear, Brig. Gen. William T. Wofford; right rear, Brig. Gen. Paul Jones Semmes.Pfanz, Battle of Gettysburg, p. 33. Pfanz, Second Day, p. 152. Lee's original plan called for Hood and McLaws to attack in concert, but Longstreet held back McLaws while Hood's attack progressed. Around 5 p.m., Longstreet saw that Hood's division was reaching its limits and that the enemy to its front was fully engaged. He ordered McLaws to send in Kershaw's brigade, with Barksdale's to follow on the left, beginning the en echelon attack--one brigade after another in sequence--that would be used for the rest of the afternoon's attack. McLaws resented Longstreet's hands-on management of his brigades. Those brigades engaged in some of the bloodiest fighting of the battle: the Wheatfield and the Peach Orchard. =Wheatfield= Initial assault on the Wheatfield The area known as the Wheatfield had three geographic features, all owned by the John Rose family: the 20 acre (8 ha) field itself, Rose Woods bordering it on the west, and a modest elevation known as Stony Hill, also to the west. Immediately to the southeast was Houck's Ridge and to the south Devil's Den. The fighting here, consisting of numerous confusing attacks and counterattacks over two hours by eleven brigades, earned the field the nickname \\"Bloody Wheatfield.\\"Pfanz, Second Day, pp. 26-29. Eicher, p. 531. The first engagement in the Wheatfield was actually that of Anderson's brigade (Hood's division) attacking the 17th Maine of Trobriand's brigade, a spillover from Hood's attack on Houck's Ridge. Although under pressure and with its neighboring regiments on Stony Hill withdrawing, the 17th Maine held its position behind a low stone wall with the assistance of Winslow's battery, and Anderson fell back. Trobriand wrote, \\"I had never seen any men fight with equal obstinacy.\\"Sears, pp. 275, 286. Pfanz, Second Day, pp. 246-57. \\"Harvest of death\\" photograph by Timothy H. O'Sullivan of Union deadFrassanito, pp. 315-18, states that the location of where this photograph (his plate \\"104b\\") was taken is unknown, although he groups it with others near the Rose Farm and confirms that the dead are Union. By 5:30 p.m., when the first of Kershaw's regiments neared the Rose farmhouse, Stony Hill had been reinforced by two brigades of the 1st Division, V Corps, under Brig. Gen. James Barnes, those of Cols. William S. Tilton and Jacob B. Sweitzer. Kershaw's men placed great pressure on the 17th Maine, but it continued to hold. For some reason, however, Barnes withdrew his understrength division about to the north-- without consultation with Birney's men--to a new position near the Wheatfield Road. Trobriand and the 17th Maine had to follow suit, and the Confederates seized Stony Hill and streamed into the Wheatfield. (Barnes's controversial decision was widely criticized after the battle, and it effectively ended his military career.)Pfanz, Second Day, pp. 252-61. Dead confederates in a field on the Rose Woods. See Frassanito \\"Gettysburg a Journey in Time\\".pp.212-213. Soldier killed by artillery fire on the southwestern edge of the Rose Woods, near the WheatfieldThe Library of Congress file for this photograph is entitled \\"Federal soldier disembowelled by a shell.\\" Frassanito, p. 336, identifies it as \\"Dead Confederate soldier in the field at the southwestern edge of the Rose Woods.\\" Earlier that afternoon, as Meade realized the folly of Sickles's movement, he ordered Hancock to send a division from the II Corps to reinforce the III Corps. Hancock sent the 1st Division under Brig. Gen. John C. Caldwell from its reserve position behind Cemetery Ridge. It arrived at about 6 p.m. and three brigades, under Cols. Samuel K. Zook, Patrick Kelly (the Irish Brigade), and Edward E. Cross moved forward; the fourth brigade, under Col. John R. Brooke, was in reserve. Zook and Kelly drove the Confederates from Stony Hill, and Cross cleared the Wheatfield, pushing Kershaw's men back to the edge of Rose Woods. Both Zook and Cross were mortally wounded in leading their brigades through these assaults, as was Confederate Semmes. When Cross's men had exhausted their ammunition, Caldwell ordered Brooke to relieve them. By this time, however, the Union position in the Peach Orchard had collapsed (see next section), and Wofford's assault continued down the Wheatfield Road, taking Stony Hill and flanking the Union forces in the Wheatfield. Brooke's brigade in Rose Woods had to retreat in some disorder. Sweitzer's brigade was sent in to delay the Confederate assault, and they did this effectively in vicious hand-to-hand combat. The Wheatfield changed hands once again.Eicher, p. 531. Pfanz, Second Day, pp. 267-87. Sears, pp. 288-91, 303-04. Confederates seize the Wheatfield. Additional Union troops had arrived by this time. The 2nd Division of the V corps, under Brig. Gen. Romeyn B. Ayres, was known as the \\"Regular Division\\" because two of its three brigades were composed entirely of U.S. Army (regular army) troops, not state volunteers. (The brigade of volunteers, under Brig. Gen. Stephen H. Weed, was already engaged on Little Round Top, so only the regular army brigades arrived at the Wheatfield.) In their advance across the Valley of Death they had come under heavy fire from Confederate sharpshooters in Devil's Den. As the regulars advanced, the Confederates swarmed over Stony Hill and through Rose Woods, flanking the newly arrived brigades. The regulars retreated back to the relative safety of Little Round Top in good order, despite taking heavy casualties and pursuing Confederates. The two regular brigades suffered 829 casualties out of 2,613 engaged.Pfanz, Battle of Gettysburg, p. 31. Eicher, pp. 531-32. Sears, pp. 321-24. Pfanz, Second Day, pp. 26-29. This final Confederate assault through the Wheatfield continued past Houck's Ridge into the Valley of Death at about 7:30 p.m. The brigades of Anderson, Semmes, and Kershaw were exhausted from hours of combat in the summer heat and advanced east with units jumbled up together. Wofford's brigade followed to the left along the Wheatfield Road. As they reached the northern shoulder of Little Round Top, they were met with a counterattack from the 3rd Division (the Pennsylvania Reserves) of the V Corps, under Brig. Gen. Samuel W. Crawford. The brigade of Col. William McCandless, including a company from the Gettysburg area, spearheaded the attack and drove the exhausted Confederates back beyond the Wheatfield to Stony Hill. Realizing that his troops were too far advanced and exposed, Crawford pulled the brigade back to the east edge of the Wheatfield.Eicher, p. 535. Pfanz, Battle of Gettysburg, p. 31. Pfanz, Second Day, pp. 390-400. The bloody Wheatfield remained quiet for the rest of the battle. But it took a heavy toll on the men who traded possession back-and-forth. The Confederates had fought six brigades against 13 (somewhat smaller) Federal brigades, and of the 20,444 men engaged, about 30% were casualties. Some of the wounded managed to crawl to Plum Run but could not cross it. The river ran red with their blood. As with the Cornfield at Antietam, this small expanse of agricultural ground would be remembered by veterans as a name of unique significance in the history of warfare.Jorgensen, pp. 7-8. =Peach Orchard= McLaws attacks the Peach Orchard, Caldwell counterattacks in the Wheatfield. Barksdale routs Humphreys's division in the Peach Orchard. While the right wing of Kershaw's brigade attacked into the Wheatfield, its left wing wheeled left to attack the Pennsylvania troops in the brigade of Brig. Gen. Charles K. Graham, the right flank of Birney's line, where 30 guns from the III Corps and the Artillery Reserve attempted to hold the sector. The South Carolinians were subjected to infantry volleys from the Peach Orchard and canister from all along the line. Suddenly someone unknown shouted a false command, and the attacking regiments turned to their right, toward the Wheatfield, which presented their left flank to the batteries. Kershaw later wrote, \\"Hundreds of the bravest and best men of Carolina fell, victims of this fatal blunder.\\"Sears, pp. 284-85. Pfanz, Battle of Gettysburg, p. 32. Pfanz, Second Day, pp. 313-17. Meanwhile, the two brigades on McLaws's left--Barksdale's in front and Wofford's behind--charged directly into the Peach Orchard, the point of the salient in Sickles's line. Gen. Barksdale led the charge on horseback, long hair flowing in the wind, sword waving in the air. Brig. Gen. Andrew A. Humphreys's division had only about 1,000 men to cover the from the Peach Orchard northward along the Emmitsburg Road to the lane leading to the Abraham Trostle farm. Some were still facing south, from where they had been firing on Kershaw's brigade, so they were hit in their vulnerable flank. Barksdale's 1,600 Mississippians wheeled left against the flank of Humphreys's division, collapsing their line, regiment by regiment. Graham's brigade retreated back toward Cemetery Ridge; Graham had two horses shot out from under him. He was hit by a shell fragment, and by a bullet in his upper body. He was eventually captured by the 21st Mississippi. Wofford's men dealt with the defenders of the orchard.Sears, pp. 298-300. Pfanz, Second Day, pp. 318-32. As Barksdale's men pushed toward Sickles's headquarters near the Trostle barn, the general and his staff began to move to the rear, when a cannonball caught Sickles in the right leg. He was carried off in a stretcher, sitting up and puffing on his cigar, attempting to encourage his men. That evening his leg was amputated, and he returned to Washington, D.C. Gen. Birney assumed command of the III Corps, which was soon rendered ineffective as a fighting force.Pfanz, Battle of Gettysburg, p. 34. Sears, p. 301. Pfanz, Second Day, pp. 333-35. \\"Group of dead horses in Trostle's farm-yard\\": at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, photographed July 5 or July 6, 1863, by William H.

O'Sullivan The relentless infantry charges posed extreme danger to the Union artillery batteries in the orchard and on the Wheatfield Road, and they were forced to withdraw under pressure. The six Napoleons of Capt. John Bigelow's 9th Massachusetts Light Artillery, on the left of the line, \\"retired by prolonge,\\" a technique rarely used in which the cannon was dragged backwards as it fired rapidly, the movement aided by the gun's recoil. By the time they reached the Trostle house, they were told to hold the position to cover the infantry retreat, but they were eventually overrun by troops of the 21st Mississippi, who captured three of their guns.Sears, pp. 308-09. Pfanz, Second Day, pp. 341-46. Humphreys's fate was sealed when the Confederate en echelon attack continued and his front and right flank began to be assaulted by the Third Corps division of Richard H. Anderson on Cemetery Ridge. Anderson's assault Anderson's assault on Cemetery Ridge The remaining portion of the en echelon attack was the responsibility of Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson's division of A.P. Hill's Third Corps, and he attacked starting at about 6 p.m. with five brigades in line, commencing on the right with Brig. Gen. Cadmus M. Wilcox, followed by Perry's Brigade (commanded by Col. David Lang), Brig. Gen. Ambrose R. Wright, Brig. Gen. Carnot Posey, and Brig. Gen. William Mahone.Pfanz, Battle of Gettysburg, pp. 34-36. Eicher, p. 534. Pfanz, Second Day, pp. 351-63. The brigades of Wilcox and Lang hit the front and right flank of Humphreys's line, dooming any chance for his division to maintain its position on the Emmitsburg Road and completing the collapse of the III Corps. Humphrey displayed considerable bravery during the attack, leading his men from horseback and forcing them to maintain good order during their withdrawal. He wrote to his wife, \\"Twenty times did I [bring] my men to a halt and face about ... forcing the men to it.\\"Sears, pp. 307-08. Pfanz, Second Day, pp. 368-72. On Cemetery Ridge, Generals Meade and Hancock were scrambling to find reinforcements. Meade had sent virtually all of his available troops (including most of the XII Corps, who would be needed momentarily on Culp's Hill) to his left flank to counter Longstreet's assault, leaving the center of his line relatively weak. There was insufficient infantry on Cemetery Ridge and only a few artillery pieces, rallied from the debacle of the Peach Orchard by Lt. Col. Freeman McGilvery.Sears, p. 346. Pfanz, Second Day, p. 318. The long march from Seminary Ridge had left some of the Southern units disorganized, and their commanders paused momentarily at Plum Run to reorganize. Hancock led the II Corps brigade of Col. George L. Willard to meet Barksdale's brigade as it moved toward the ridge. Willard's New Yorkers drove the Mississippians back to Emmitsburg Road. Barksdale was wounded in his left knee, followed by a cannonball to his left foot, and finally was hit by another bullet to his chest, knocking him off his horse. His troops were forced to leave him for dead on the field, and he died the next morning in a Union field hospital. Willard was also killed, and Confederate guns drove back Willard's men in turn.Pfanz, Second Day, pp. 403-06. Sears, pp. 318-19. As Hancock rode north to find additional reinforcements, he saw Wilcox's brigade nearing the base of the ridge, aiming at a gap in the Union line. The timing was critical, and Hancock chose the only troops at hand, the men of the 1st Minnesota, Harrow's Brigade, of the 2nd Division of the II Corps. They were originally placed there to guard Thomas's U.S. Battery. He pointed to a Confederate flag over the advancing line and shouted to Col. William Colvill, \\"Advance, Colonel, and take those colors!\\" The 262 Minnesotans charged the Alabama brigade with bayonets fixed, and they blunted their advance at Plum Run but at horrible cost--215 casualties (82%), including 40 deaths or mortal wounds, one of the largest regimental single-action losses of the war. Despite overwhelming Confederate numbers, the small 1st Minnesota, with the support of Willard's brigade on their left, checked Wilcox's advance and the Alabamians were forced to withdraw.Eicher, p. 536. Sears, pp. 320-21. Pfanz, Second Day, pp. 406, 410-14; Busey & Martin, Regimental Losses, p. 129. According to Busey & Martin, the 1st Minnesota had an effective strength of 330, but Sears and Pfanz state that only 262 participated in the charge on July 2. The total regimental losses for the Battle of Gettysburg, including Pickett's Charge, were 67.9%. The third Confederate brigade in line, under Ambrose Wright, crushed two regiments posted on the Emmitsburg Road north of the Codori farm, captured the guns of two batteries, and advanced toward a gap in the Union line just south of the Copse of Trees. (For a time, the only Union soldiers in this part of the line were Gen. Meade and some of his staff officers.) Wright's Georgia brigade may have reached the crest of Cemetery Ridge and beyond. Many historians have been skeptical of Wright's claims in his after- action report, which, if correct, would mean he passed the crest of the ridge and got as far as the Widow Leister's house before being struck in the flank and repulsed by Union reinforcements (Brig. Gen. George J. Stannard's Vermont brigade). Others believe his account was plausible because he accurately described the masses of Union troops on the Baltimore Pike that would have been invisible to him if he had been stopped earlier. Furthermore, his conversations with General Lee that evening lend support to his claim. It is possible that Lee derived some false confidence from Wright about the ability of his men to reach Cemetery Ridge the following day in Pickett's Charge.Sears, pp. 322-23. Pfanz, Second Day, pp. 387-417. Eicher, p. 536. Wright told Lee that it was relatively easy to get to the crest, but it was difficult to stay there.Coddington, p. 459. A significant reason Wright could not stay was his lack of support. Two brigades were on Wright's left and could have reinforced his success. Carnot Posey's brigade made slow progress and never crossed the Emmitsburg Road, despite protestations from Wright. William Mahone's brigade inexplicably never moved at all. Gen. Anderson sent a messenger with orders to Mahone to advance, but Mahone refused. Part of the blame for the failure of Wright's assault must lie with Anderson, who took little active part in directing his division in battle.Pfanz, Battle of Gettysburg, p. 36. Sears, pp. 323-24. Pfanz, Second Day, pp. 386-89. Battle of East Cemetery Hill Lee ordered Lt. Gen. Ewell to launch a demonstration, or minor diversionary attack, on the Union right flank. He started the attack at 4 p.m. with an artillery bombardment from Benner's Hill, which caused little damage to the Union lines, but the counterbattery fire returned upon the lower hill was deadly. Ewell's best artillery officer, 19-year-old Joseph W. Latimer, the \\"Boy Major\\", was mortally wounded, eventually dying a month later. Ewell did not launch a conventional infantry attack until after 7 p.m., after Anderson's assault on Cemetery Ridge had crested.Pfanz, Battle of Gettysburg, p. 37. Eicher, p. 537. At around 8 p.m., two brigades of Jubal Early's division reached the Union artillery of East Cemetery Hill near the Baltimore Pike, but Union reinforcements drove them from the hill.Pfanz, Battle of Gettysburg, pp. 40-42. Eicher, pp. 538-39. Culp's Hill Maj. Gen. Edward \\"Allegheny\\" Johnson's Confederate division attacked Brig. Gen. George S. Greene's XII Corps brigade behind strong breastworks on Culp's Hill. The Confederates suffered severe casualties and gained only the portions of the Union line that had been vacated under orders that afternoon by General Meade to reinforce the left flank of his line against Longstreet.Pfanz, Battle of Gettysburg, pp. 37-40. Eicher, pp. 536-37. Council of war The battlefield fell silent around 10:30 p.m., except for the cries of the wounded and dying. Gen. Meade telegraphed to General-in-Chief Henry Halleck in Washington:Sears, pp. 341-42. James E. Kelly Meade made his decision late that night in a council of war that included his senior staff officers and corps commanders. The assembled officers agreed that, despite the beating the army took, it was advisable for the army to remain in its present position and to await attack by the enemy, although there was some disagreement about how long to wait if Lee chose not to attack. There is some evidence that Meade had already decided this issue and was using the meeting not as a formal council of war, but as a way to achieve consensus among officers he had commanded for less than a week. As the meeting broke up, Meade took aside Brig. Gen. John Gibbon, in command of the II Corps, and predicted, \\"If Lee attacks tomorrow, it will be in your front. ... he has made attacks on both our flanks and failed and if he concludes to try it again, it will be on our centre.\\"Sears, pp. 342-45. Eicher, pp. 539-40. Coddington, pp. 449-53. There was considerably less confidence in Confederate headquarters that night. The army had suffered a significant defeat by not dislodging their enemy. A staff officer remarked that Lee was \\"not in good humor over the miscarriage of his plans and his orders.\\" But in Lee's report, he showed more optimism:Official Records, Series 1, volume XXVII, part 2, p. 320. Years later, Longstreet would write that his troops on the second day had done the \\"best three hours' fighting done by any troops on any battle-field.\\"Pfanz, Second Day, p. 425. That night he continued to advocate for a strategic movement around the Union left flank, but Lee would hear none of it. He sent orders to Richard Ewell to \\"assail the enemy's right\\" at daylight, and he ordered Jeb Stuart (who had finally arrived at Lee's headquarters early that afternoon) to operate on Ewell's left and rear. Casualty figures for the second day of Gettysburg are difficult to assess because both armies reported by unit after the full battle, not by day. One estimate is that the Confederates lost approximately 6,000 killed, missing, or wounded from Hood's, McLaws's, and Anderson's divisions, amounting to 30-40% casualties. Union casualties in these actions probably exceeded 9,000.Pfanz, Second Day, pp. 429-31. An estimate for the day's total (including the Culp's and Cemetery Hill actions) by historian Noah Trudeau is 10,000 Union, 6,800 Confederate.Trudeau, p. 421. This is in comparison to approximately 9,000 Union and 6,000 Confederate casualties on the first day, although there were much larger percentages of the armies engaged the second.Trudeau, p. 272. Some estimates of total casualties for the day run as high as 20,000 and declare it the bloodiest day of the Battle of Gettysburg. It is a testament to the ferocity of the day's battle that such high casualty figures resulted even with much of the fighting not occurring until late in the afternoon and thereafter lasting about six hours. By comparison, the Battle of Antietam-- known famously as the bloodiest single day in American military history with nearly 23,000 casualties--was an engagement that lasted twelve hours, or about twice as long.Eicher, p. 363. On the night of July 2, all of the remaining elements of both armies had arrived: Stuart's cavalry and Pickett's division for the Confederates and John Sedgwick's Union VI Corps. The stage was set for the bloody climax of the three-day battle.Sears, p. 342. Notes References * Adelman, Garry E., and Timothy H. Smith. Devil's Den: A History and Guide.

SystemVerilog is based on Verilog and some extensions, and since 2008 Verilog is now part of the same IEEE standard. It is commonly used in the semiconductor and electronic design industry as an evolution of Verilog. History SystemVerilog started with the donation of the Superlog language to Accellera in 2002 by the startup company Co-Design Automation.Rich, D. ‚ÄúThe evolution of SystemVerilog‚Äù IEEE Design and Test of Computers, July/August 2003 The bulk of the verification functionality is based on the OpenVera language donated by Synopsys. In 2005, SystemVerilog was adopted as IEEE Standard 1800-2005.IEEE approves SystemVerilog, revision of Verilog In 2009, the standard was merged with the base Verilog (IEEE 1364-2005) standard, creating IEEE Standard 1800-2009. The current version is IEEE standard 1800-2017.1800-2017 - IEEE Standard for SystemVerilog--Unified Hardware Design, Specification, and Verification Language The feature-set of SystemVerilog can be divided into two distinct roles: # SystemVerilog for register-transfer level (RTL) design is an extension of Verilog-2005; all features of that language are available in SystemVerilog. Therefore, Verilog is a subset of SystemVerilog. # SystemVerilog for verification uses extensive object-oriented programming techniques and is more closely related to Java than Verilog. These constructs are generally not synthesizable. The remainder of this article discusses the features of SystemVerilog not present in Verilog-2005. Design features =Data lifetime= There are two types of data lifetime specified in SystemVerilog: static and automatic. Automatic variables are created the moment program execution comes to the scope of the variable. Static variables are created at the start of the program's execution and keep the same value during the entire program's lifespan, unless assigned a new value during execution. Any variable that is declared inside a task or function without specifying type will be considered automatic. To specify that a variable is static place the \\"\`static\`\\" keyword in the declaration before the type, e.g., \\"\`static int x;\`\\". The \\"\`automatic\`\\" keyword is used in the same way. =New data types= Enhanced variable types add new capability to Verilog's \\"reg\\" type: logic [31:0] my_var; Verilog-1995 and -2001 limit reg variables to behavioral statements such as RTL code. SystemVerilog extends the reg type so it can be driven by a single driver such as gate or module. SystemVerilog names this type \\"logic\\" to remind users that it has this extra capability and is not a hardware register. The names \\"logic\\" and \\"reg\\" are interchangeable. A signal with more than one driver (such as a tri-state buffer for general-purpose input/output) needs to be declared a net type such as \\"wire\\" so SystemVerilog can resolve the final value. Multidimensional packed arrays unify and extend Verilog's notion of \\"registers\\" and \\"memories\\": logic [1:0][2:0] my_pack[32]; Classical Verilog permitted only one dimension to be declared to the left of the variable name. SystemVerilog permits any number of such \\"packed\\" dimensions. A variable of packed array type maps 1:1 onto an integer arithmetic quantity. In the example above, each element of \`my_pack\` may be used in expressions as a six-bit integer. The dimensions to the right of the name (32 in this case) are referred to as \\"unpacked\\" dimensions. As in Verilog-2001, any number of unpacked dimensions is permitted. Enumerated data types (\`enums\`) allow numeric quantities to be assigned meaningful names. Variables declared to be of enumerated type cannot be assigned to variables of a different enumerated type without casting. This is not true of parameters, which were the preferred implementation technique for enumerated quantities in Verilog-2005: typedef enum logic [2:0] { RED, GREEN, BLUE, CYAN, MAGENTA, YELLOW } color_t; color_t my_color = GREEN; initial $display(\\"The color is %s\\", my_color.name()); As shown above, the designer can specify an underlying arithmetic type (\`logic [2:0]\` in this case) which is used to represent the enumeration value. The meta-values X and Z can be used here, possibly to represent illegal states. The built-in function \`name()\` returns an ASCII string for the current enumerated value, which is useful in validation and testing. New integer types: SystemVerilog defines \`byte\`, \`shortint\`, \`int\` and \`longint\` as two-state signed integral types having 8, 16, 32, and 64 bits respectively. A \`bit\` type is a variable- width two-state type that works much like \`logic\`. Two-state types lack the X and Z metavalues of classical Verilog; working with these types may result in faster simulation. Structures and unions work much like they do in the C programming language. SystemVerilog enhancements include the packed attribute and the tagged attribute. The \`tagged\` attribute allows runtime tracking of which member(s) of a union are currently in use. The \`packed\` attribute causes the structure or union to be mapped 1:1 onto a packed array of bits. The contents of \`struct\` data types occupy a continuous block of memory with no gaps, similar to bitfields in C and C++: typedef struct packed { bit [10:0] expo; bit sign; bit [51:0] mant; } FP; FP zero = 64'b0; As shown in this example, SystemVerilog also supports typedefs, as in C and C++. =Procedural blocks= SystemVerilog introduces three new procedural blocks intended to model hardware: \`always_comb\` (to model combinational logic), \`always_ff\` (for flip-flops), and \`always_latch\` (for latches). Whereas Verilog used a single, general-purpose \`always\` block to model different types of hardware structures, each of SystemVerilog's new blocks is intended to model a specific type of hardware, by imposing semantic restrictions to ensure that hardware described by the blocks matches the intended usage of the model. An HDL compiler or verification program can take extra steps to ensure that only the intended type of behavior occurs. An \`always_comb\` block models combinational logic. The simulator infers the sensitivity list to be all variables from the contained statements: always_comb begin tmp = b * b - 4 * a * c; no_root = (tmp < 0); end An \`always_latch\` block is meant to infer a level-sensitive latch. Again, the sensitivity list is inferred from the code: always_latch if (en) q <= d; An \`always_ff\` block is meant to model synchronous logic (especially edge-sensitive sequential logic): always_ff @(posedge clk) count <= count + 1; Electronic design automation (EDA) tools can verify the design's intent by checking that the hardware model does not violate any block usage semantics. For example, the new blocks restrict assignment to a variable by allowing only one source, whereas Verilog's \`always\` block permitted assignment from multiple procedural sources. Interfaces For small designs, the Verilog port compactly describes a module's connectivity with the surrounding environment. But major blocks within a large design hierarchy typically possess port counts in the thousands. SystemVerilog introduces concept of interfaces to both reduce the redundancy of port-name declarations between connected modules, as well as group and abstract related signals into a user-declared bundle. Additional concept is modport, that shows direction of logic connections. Example: interface intf; logic a; logic b; modport in (input a, output b); modport out (input b, output a); endinterface module top; intf i (); u_a m1 (.i1(i.in)); u_b m2 (.i2(i.out)); endmodule module u_a (intf.in i1); endmodule module u_b (intf.out i2); endmodule Verification features The following verification features are typically not synthesizable, meaning they cannot be implemented in hardware based on HDL code. Instead, they assist in the creation of extensible, flexible test benches. =New data types= The \`string\` data type represents a variable- length text string. For example: string s1 = \\"Hello\\"; string s2 = \\"world\\"; string p = \\".?!\\"; string s3 = {s1, \\", \\", s2, p[2]}; // string concatenation $display(\\"[%d] %s\\", s3.len(), s3); // simulation will print: \\"[13] Hello, world!\\" In addition to the static array used in design, SystemVerilog offers dynamic arrays, associative arrays and queues: int cmdline_elements; // # elements for dynamic array int da[]; // dynamic array int ai[int]; // associative array, indexed by int int as[string]; // associative array, indexed by string int qa[$]; // queue, indexed as an array, or by built-in methods initial begin cmdline_elements = 16; da = new[ cmdline_elements ]; // Allocate array with 16 elements end A dynamic array works much like an unpacked array, but offers the advantage of being dynamically allocated at runtime (as shown above.) Whereas a packed array's size must be known at compile time (from a constant or expression of constants), the dynamic array size can be initialized from another runtime variable, allowing the array to be sized and resize arbitrarily as needed. An associative array can be thought of as a binary search tree with a user-specified key type and data type. The key implies an ordering; the elements of an associative array can be read out in lexicographic order. Finally, a queue provides much of the functionality of the C++ STL deque type: elements can be added and removed from either end efficiently. These primitives allow the creation of complex data structures required for scoreboarding a large design. =Classes= SystemVerilog provides an object-oriented programming model. In SystemVerilog, classes support a single-inheritance model, but may implement functionality similar to multiple-inheritance through the use of so-called \\"interface classes\\" (identical in concept to the \`interface\` feature of Java). Classes can be parameterized by type, providing the basic function of C++ templates. However, template specialization and function templates are not supported. SystemVerilog's polymorphism features are similar to those of C++: the programmer may specifically write a \`virtual\` function to have a derived class gain control of the function. See virtual function for further info. Encapsulation and data hiding is accomplished using the \`local\` and \`protected\` keywords, which must be applied to any item that is to be hidden. By default, all class properties are public. Class instances are dynamically created with the \`new\` keyword. A constructor denoted by \`function new\` can be defined. SystemVerilog has automatic garbage collection, so there is no language facility to explicitly destroy instances created by the new operator. Example: virtual class Memory; virtual function bit [31:0] read(bit [31:0] addr); endfunction virtual function void write(bit [31:0] addr, bit [31:0] data); endfunction endclass class SRAM #(parameter AWIDTH=10) extends Memory; bit [31:0] mem [1< =Constrained random generation= Integer quantities, defined either in a class definition or as stand-alone variables in some lexical scope, can be assigned random values based on a set of constraints. This feature is useful for creating randomized scenarios for verification. Within class definitions, the \`rand\` and \`randc\` modifiers signal variables that are to undergo randomization. \`randc\` specifies permutation-based randomization, where a variable will take on all possible values once before any value is repeated. Variables without modifiers are not randomized. class eth_frame; rand bit [47:0] dest; rand bit [47:0] src; rand bit [15:0] f_type; rand byte payload[]; bit [31:0] fcs; rand bit [31:0] fcs_corrupt; constraint basic { payload.size inside {[46:1500]}; } constraint good_fr { fcs_corrupt  0; } endclass In this example, the \`fcs\` field is not randomized; in practice it will be computed with a CRC generator, and the \`fcs_corrupt\` field used to corrupt it to inject FCS errors. The two constraints shown are applicable to conforming Ethernet frames. Constraints may be selectively enabled; this feature would be required in the example above to generate corrupt frames. Constraints may be arbitrarily complex, involving interrelationships among variables, implications, and iteration. The SystemVerilog constraint solver is required to find a solution if one exists, but makes no guarantees as to the time it will require to do so as this is in general an NP-hard problem (boolean satisfiability).  Randomization methods  In each SystemVerilog class there are 3 predefined methods for randomization: pre_randomize, randomize and post_randomize. The randomize method is called by the user for randomization of the class variables. The pre_randomize method is called by the randomize method before the randomization and the post_randomize method is called by the randomize method after randomization. class eth_frame; rand bit [47:0] dest; rand bit [47:0] src; rand bit [15:0] f_type; rand byte payload[]; bit [31:0] fcs; rand bit corrupted_frame; constraint basic { payload.size inside {[46:1500]}; } function void post_randomize() this.calculate_fcs(); // update the fcs field according to the randomized frame if (corrupted_frame) // if this frame should be corrupted this.corrupt_fcs(); // corrupt the fcs endfunction endclass  Controlling constraints  The constraint_mode() and the random_mode() methods are used to control the randomization. constraint_mode() is used to turn a specific constraint on and off and the random_mode is used to turn a randomization of a specific variable on or off. The below code describes and procedurally tests an Ethernet frame: class eth_frame; rand bit [47:0] dest; rand bit [47:0] src; rand bit [15:0] f_type; rand byte payload[]; bit [31:0] fcs; rand bit corrupted_frame; constraint basic { payload.size inside {[46:1500]}; } constraint one_src_cst { src  48'h1f00 } constraint dist_to_fcs { fcs dist {0:/30,[1:2500]:/50}; // 30, and 50 are the weights (30/80 or 50/80, in this example) } endclass . . . eth_frame my_frame; my_frame.one_src_cst.constraint_mode(0); // the constraint one_src_cst will not be taken into account my_frame.f_type.random_mode(0); // the f_type variable will not be randomized for this frame instance. my_frame.randomize(); =Assertions= Assertions are useful for verifying properties of a design that manifest themselves after a specific condition or state is reached. SystemVerilog has its own assertion specification language, similar to Property Specification Language. The subset of SystemVerilog language constructs that serves assertion is commonly called SystemVerilog Assertion or SVA.SystemVerilog Assertion: Introduction SystemVerilog assertions are built from sequences and properties. Properties are a superset of sequences; any sequence may be used as if it were a property, although this is not typically useful. Sequences consist of boolean expressions augmented with temporal operators. The simplest temporal operator is the \`##\` operator which performs a concatenation: sequence S1; @(posedge clk) req ##1 gnt; endsequence This sequence matches if the \`gnt\` signal goes high one clock cycle after \`req\` goes high. Note that all sequence operations are synchronous to a clock. Other sequential operators include repetition operators, as well as various conjunctions. These operators allow the designer to express complex relationships among design components. An assertion works by continually attempting to evaluate a sequence or property. An assertion fails if the property fails. The sequence above will fail whenever \`req\` is low. To accurately express the requirement that \`gnt\` follow \`req\` a property is required: property req_gnt; @(posedge clk) req => gnt; endproperty assert_req_gnt: assert property (req_gnt) else $error(\\"req not followed by gnt.\\"); This example shows an implication operator \`=>\`. The clause to the left of the implication is called the antecedent and the clause to the right is called the consequent. Evaluation of an implication starts through repeated attempts to evaluate the antecedent. When the antecedent succeeds, the consequent is attempted, and the success of the assertion depends on the success of the consequent. In this example, the consequent won't be attempted until \`req\` goes high, after which the property will fail if \`gnt\` is not high on the following clock. In addition to assertions, SystemVerilog supports assumptions and coverage of properties. An assumption establishes a condition that a formal logic proving tool must assume to be true. An assertion specifies a property that must be proven true. In simulation, both assertions and assumptions are verified against test stimuli. Property coverage allows the verification engineer to verify that assertions are accurately monitoring the design. =Coverage= Coverage as applied to hardware verification languages refers to the collection of statistics based on sampling events within the simulation. Coverage is used to determine when the device under test (DUT) has been exposed to a sufficient variety of stimuli that there is a high confidence that the DUT is functioning correctly. Note that this differs from code coverage which instruments the design code to ensure that all lines of code in the design have been executed. Functional coverage ensures that all desired corner and edge cases in the design space have been explored. A SystemVerilog coverage group creates a database of \\"bins\\" that store a histogram of values of an associated variable. Cross-coverage can also be defined, which creates a histogram representing the Cartesian product of multiple variables. A sampling event controls when a sample is taken. The sampling event can be a Verilog event, the entry or exit of a block of code, or a call to the \`sample\` method of the coverage group. Care is required to ensure that data are sampled only when meaningful. For example: class eth_frame; // Definitions as above covergroup cov; coverpoint dest { bins bcast[1] = {48'hFFFFFFFFFFFF}; bins ucast[1] = default; } coverpoint f_type { bins length[16] = { [0:1535] }; bins typed[16] = { [1536:32767] }; bins other[1] = default; } psize: coverpoint payload.size { bins size[] = { 46, [47:63], 64, [65:511], [512:1023], [1024:1499], 1500 }; } sz_x_t: cross f_type, psize; endgroup endclass In this example, the verification engineer is interested in the distribution of broadcast and unicast frames, the size/f_type field and the payload size. The ranges in the payload size coverpoint reflect the interesting corner cases, including minimum and maximum size frames. =Synchronization= A complex test environment consists of reusable verification components that must communicate with one another. Verilog's 'event' primitive allowed different blocks of procedural statements to trigger each other, but enforcing thread synchronization was up to the programmer's (clever) usage. SystemVerilog offers two primitives specifically for interthread synchronization: mailbox and semaphore. The mailbox is modeled as a FIFO message queue. Optionally, the FIFO can be type-parameterized so that only objects of the specified type may be passed through it. Typically, objects are class instances representing transactions: elementary operations (for example, sending a frame) that are executed by the verification components. The semaphore is modeled as a counting semaphore. General improvements to classical Verilog In addition to the new features above, SystemVerilog enhances the usability of Verilog's existing language features. The following are some of these enhancements: *The procedural assignment operators (<=, =) can now operate directly on arrays. *Port (inout, input, output) definitions are now expanded to support a wider variety of data types: struct, enum, real, and multi-dimensional types are supported. *The for loop construct now allows automatic variable declaration inside the for statement. Loop flow control is improved by the continue and break statements. *SystemVerilog adds a do/while loop to the _while_ loop construct. *Constant variables, i.e. those designated as non-changing during runtime, can be designated by use of const. *Variable initialization can now operate on arrays. *Increment and decrement operators (\`x++\`, \`++x\`, \`x--\`, \`--x\`) are supported in SystemVerilog, as are other compound assignment operators (\`x += a\`, \`x -= a\`, \`x *= a\`, \`x /= a\`, \`x %= a\`, \`x <<= a\`, \`x >>= a\`, \`x &= a\`, \`x ^= a\`, \`x = a\`) as in C and descendants. *The preprocessor has improved \`define macro-substitution capabilities, specifically substitution within literal-strings (\\"\\"), as well as concatenation of multiple macro-tokens into a single word. *The fork/join construct has been expanded with join_none and join_any. *Additions to the \`timescale directive allow simulation timescale to be controlled more predictably in a large simulation environment, with each source file using a local timescale. *Task ports can now be declared ref. A reference gives the task body direct access to the source arguments in the caller's scope, known as \\"pass by reference\\" in computer programming. Since it is operating on the original variable itself, rather than a copy of the argument's value, the task/function can modify variables (but not nets) in the caller's scope in real time. The inout/output port declarations pass variables by value, and defer updating the caller-scope variable until the moment the task exits. *Functions can now be declared void, which means it returns no value. *Parameters can be declared any type, including user-defined typedefs. Besides this, SystemVerilog allows convenient interface to foreign languages (like C/C++), by SystemVerilog DPI (Direct Programming Interface). Verification and synthesis software In the design verification role, SystemVerilog is widely used in the chip-design industry. The three largest EDA vendors (Cadence Design Systems, Mentor Graphics, Synopsys) have incorporated SystemVerilog into their mixed-language HDL simulators. Although no simulator can yet claim support for the entire SystemVerilog , making testbench interoperability a challenge, efforts to promote cross-vendor compatibility are underway. In 2008, Cadence and Mentor released the Open Verification Methodology, an open-source class-library and usage-framework to facilitate the development of re-usable testbenches and canned verification- IP. Synopsys, which had been the first to publish a SystemVerilog class- library (VMM), subsequently responded by opening its proprietary VMM to the general public. Many third-party providers have announced or already released SystemVerilog verification IP. In the design synthesis role (transformation of a hardware-design description into a gate-netlist), SystemVerilog adoption has been slow. Many design teams use design flows which involve multiple tools from different vendors. Most design teams cannot migrate to SystemVerilog RTL- design until their entire front-end tool suite (linters, formal verification and automated test structure generators) support a common language subset.

The lyrics were written in 1905 by Arthur M. Alden, an OU student and son of a local jeweler in Norman. The tune is taken from \\"Boola Boola\\", the fight song of Yale University (which was itself borrowed from an 1898 song called \\"La Hoola Boola\\" by Robert Allen (Bob) Cole and Billy Johnson).Diane Scarponi, \\"'Boola Boola': Yale's fight song marks 100th anniversary\\", Associated Press in South Coast Today, November 19, 2000.

Excerpts available at Google Books.David W. Levy, The University of Oklahoma: A History (University of Oklahoma Press, 2005), , p. 143. Excerpts available at Google Books. Origin of the lyrics The phrase \\"Boomer Sooner\\" refers to the Land Run of 1889, in which the land around the modern university was settled. Boomers were people who campaigned for the lands to be opened (or tried to enter the lands) before passage of the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889. Sooners were land thieves who settled before the lands were officially opened, giving them an unfair advantage on finding, fencing, and claiming farm land. If the charge of early entry was proven, they would lose their claimed land. Uses The OU marching band plays the fight song when the team takes the field and when the team scores a touchdown, a field goal, makes a big play, or makes a play in general. They also play it along with other fight songs while the Oklahoma defense is on the field to encourage the crowd to get loud. Some fans have informally counted it being played between 70 and 90 times a game. ESPN writer Doug Ward has called the combined effect of \\"Boomer Sooner\\" and OU's horse-drawn Sooner Schooner wagon \\"as potent a one-two fight song/mascot punch as you'll find in college football.\\"Doug Ward, \\"Pilgrimage: Sooner and later (continued), ESPN.com, October 14, 2010. The day \\"The Pride\\" won On October 15, 1983 the University of Oklahoma football team visited Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma. The Sooner squad played poorly at first, and within 10 minutes Oklahoma State was winning by a score of 20-3. A policeman escorted Gene Thrailkill, the Oklahoma band director, off the field for not having a sideline pass. Before he was forced to leave, Thrailkill shouted to the band members, \\"I want you to start playing and don't stop 'til the team's ahead!\\" The band complied, and played \\"Boomer Sooner\\" non-stop roughly 300 times. The team responded by scoring 15 unanswered points against Oklahoma State. After an OSU fumble with 1:17 left in the game, Oklahoma scored a field goal to win 21-20. OU coach Barry Switzer awarded the game ball to the band (known as \\"The Pride of Oklahoma\\") for the non-stop effort and labeled it \\"The Day The Pride Won\\". In popular culture Professional wrestling announcer and Oklahoma native Jim Ross uses the fight song as his entrance theme. He also often uses the phrase \\"Boomer Sooner\\" to signify a good moment.Ray Dozier, The Oklahoma Football Encyclopedia (Sports Publishing LLC, 2006), , pp. 291-292. Excerpts available at Google Books.Mike Hlas, \\"Interview: Jim ‚ÄúJ.R.‚Äù Ross of the WWE talks Oklahoma Sooners football\\", The Gazette (Cedar Rapids, Iowa), December 21, 2011. In recent years, \\"Boomer Sooner\\" has been adopted as a chant at Sooner football and basketball games. One side of Owen Field or the Lloyd Noble Center chants \\"Boomer!\\" with the other side chanting \\"Sooner!\\" The chant has frequently been heard at recent Heisman Trophy presentations, led by 1978 Heisman winner Billy Sims. The tune of the song is also used for Albania's popular national song, \\"Shqip√´ri, atdhe i dashur!\\" (\\"Albania, dear fatherland!\\"), also known as the Alphabet Hymn. The tune was borrowed by Parashqevi Qiriazi, who penned patriotic lyrics to fit it, after the historic Congress of Manastir which decided the Albanian alphabet.

Two Toronto-bound friends from the same town persuaded Abraham to join them. Shortly after arriving in Toronto, Abraham was driving a horse and cart through residential and industrial areas of Toronto looking for scrap metal. By 1914, just before the war in Europe, Abraham had saved enough to bring his wife, Chippa Sura, and two young sons Joseph and Max to accompany him in Toronto.http://speeches.empireclub.org/62981/data?n=1 Abraham prospered and constructed the Runnymede Iron and Steel Company into a major steel fabrication company and real estate empire. His son, Max, who founded his own company, York Steel, had seven children, among them Larry, who studied economics at Cornell University.http://www.cjnews.com/culture/canada-150/larry-tanenbaum-toronto- sports-king Business activities =Construction and civil engineering= Tanenbaum is currently chairman and chief executive officer of Kilmer Van Nostrand Co. Limited, having served as president and CEO from 1968 to 2000. Under his direction, Kilmer developed into a multi-faceted civil engineering construction company whose operating divisions and subsidiaries covered road building and paving, ready-mix concrete, aggregates, heavy construction, trucking and pipe manufacturing. The heavy construction operations included projects in Canada, the United States and South America and specialized in constructing subways, elevated transit system guideways, bridges and tunnels including the design-build of the Toronto Zoo elevated transit system, the elevated transit system in Miami and subways in Caracas, Atlanta, Calgary and Toronto. In 1984 this unit was merged with Canadian Foundation Company Ltd. which itself was later merged with Bannister International. From that time through December 2000 Kilmer's road building, paving and aggregates operations were conducted through Kilmer's wholly owned subsidiary, The Warren Paving & Materials Group Limited. Tanenbaum served as chairman of Warren, which, until its merger with Lafarge North America, was Canada's largest asphalt paving and aggregate company with operations serving approximately 54 communities. Warren's activities also included major commercial aggregates operations, liquid asphalt trading and distribution and road maintenance. In December 2000 Warren was merged into Lafarge North America Inc., North America's largest diversified construction materials company and supplier of cement, aggregates and concrete, and other materials for residential, commercial, institutional and public works construction in the United States and Canada. As a result of this merger, Kilmer became a significant shareholder in Lafarge NA, and Tanenbaum served on the board and chaired its finance committee until the 2006 buyout by Lafarge SA. Today, Kilmer's roots in construction are expressed through innovative real estate development and leading edge public private partnerships (P3). Its Kilmer Brownfield Equity Fund reclaims contaminated land in the urban context, through sophisticated risk management and optimizing for highest and best use. Its Kilmer Developments is currently managing three P3's: The Quickload Container Examination Facility in Prince Rupert, B.C.; the 20 Ontario Highway Service Centre locations under the ONroute banner, in partnership with HMS Host and Canadian Tire; and in partnership with Dream, designed, financed and constructed the 2015 Pan Am Games Athletes‚Äô Village, which has been converted into condominiums as part of the Canary District Project. Kilmer is also part of the consortium that has acquired the passenger terminal operations at Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport. Kilmer has a long history of private equity investment, beginning in 1975 as a significant shareholder of CUC Broadcasting, where Tanenbaum served on the board of directors and the executive committee of the company. At the time of its sale in 1994 CUC was Canada's fifth largest cable company, with operations that included paging, publishing, satellite, and radio broadcasting. Most recently, Kilmer, in partnership with Heartland Coca-Cola Bottling out of Kansas, acquired the Coca-Cola bottling and distribution operations for all of Canada. The new operation, Coca-Cola Canada Bottling Limited, is owned by Tanbridge Partners LP, of which Tanenbaum is co-chairman. Kilmer's other current private equity investments include Chaleur Sawmills Limited Partnership, Fornebu Lumber Company Inc. and Cypress Five Star Inc., the Canadian franchisee of Five Guys Burgers and Blaze Pizza. In addition to its direct investing activities, in 2000 Kilmer founded Kilmer Capital Partners Limited, a private equity investment fund manager, which established two funds to provide equity capital to small and mid-market companies. Tanenbaum is chairman of Kilmer Capital. Kilmer Capital's investments have included Give and Go Prepared Foods Corp., McGregor Industries Inc., Unisync Corp. Inc., Vansco Electronics Ltd., Atelka Enterprises Inc., Altasciences Inc., Compact Power Inc. and Tribal Sportswear. Tanenbaum recently served as a member of the advisory council, Toronto Board of Trade. He also served as a member of the Ontario Investment and Trade Advisory Council; as a member of the advisory committee, Toronto Prosperity Initiative; and as a member of the independent fiscal review panel of the City of Toronto; and the Mayor's Economic Competitiveness Advisory Committee of the City of Toronto. =Sports= Tanenbaum has had a long-standing interest in the sports and entertainment area and to that end in 1991 he spearheaded the effort to bring an NBA franchise to Toronto. In 1996 an interest was acquired in the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey club and arena. In 1998 Tanenbaum was an active force in the acquisition of the Toronto Raptors basketball team and Air Canada Centre, which, with the Toronto Maple Leafs formed Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment. Tanenbaum is chairman of MLSE, chairman of the board of the National Basketball Association, and a governor and member of the executive committee of the National Hockey League, the NBA, and Major League Soccer (Toronto FC professional soccer club, which MLSE also owns). He is Co-Chair ‚Äì Toronto 2026 FIFA World Cup. He is a member of the board of the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto, Ontario. Philanthropy Tanenbaum's involvement in community associations includes the following: vice chair of Sinai Health System; co-chair of the Research Committee for the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute; vice-chair, Brain Canada; member, University Council, Cornell University; Honorary Board Member, Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Care; member of the advisory board, Montreal Neurological Institute; co-founder and board member, Tanenbaum Open Science Institute at MNI; member, Dean's advisory council, Schulich School of Business, York University; founding board member, executive committee member and member of the Global Leadership Council of Right to Play; founding member, Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs; and co- chair, Tomorrow Campaign (UJA). Personal life Tanenbaum is married and has two daughters and one son. Honours and awards In recognition of his contributions in the areas of philanthropy, volunteerism and sports, Tanenbaum was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada on October 25, 2007.

It is based on the novel Phileine zegt sorry by Ronald Giphart. Plot The story is about Phileine (Kim van Kooten) and her actor boyfriend Max (Michiel Huisman). He goes to New York City to improve his acting skills. Later on, without Max knowing it, Phileine also travels to New York. On the plane, she meets an American couple, Fabian and Lena, who offer to bring her to Max's house. Fabian gives Phileine his phone number to call him during her stay for a tour. Inside Max's house, Phileine meets his friends: the bespectacled Jules, the sick Leonard, the Flemish Gulpje, the terrible Joanna and weatherman LT (Louis Theodore). That same evening, a welcome party is held, but because of all the new impressions, drinks, and fatigue, Phileine goes to bed early. In the morning, she finds a note from Max that he had to leave early for rehearsal but that the two of them will have dinner together in the evening. Phileine goes to the living room and meets Gulpje. Soon, they decide to be best friends and have lunch. After lunch, Phileine calls Fabian for a tour. During that tour, Fabian gets a little bit too personal so she reminds him that he has a wife. Max can‚Äôt make it to diner because his rehearsal runs out. Phileine spends that night with the friends of Max. Together with Gulpje, she stirs the group up because they both like to joke around at the expense of others. On day two, Phileine attends the premiere of Romeo and Juliet. The play shows the sexual side of society, so it is played naked and shows sex and masturbation scenes. Part of the audience is so shocked that after the break, they call out their displeasure and leave the theater. Phileine is astonished but remains still in her seat until the end. At the after party, she tries to obtain explanations about what had happened on stage. She asks Max and the director Reginald, but neither gives her an answer. She quarrels with Max but settles the matter later in a pub. The next day, she goes with Gulpje to the restaurant where the scene from ‚ÄúWhen Harry Met Sally\\" was filmed. Phileine and Gulpje get the attention of two men and they invite them to their table. They want to show off their tricks and begin gently with panting and moaning. Initially the men find it funny, but when Phileine and Gulpje start screaming, the whole thing gets embarrassing and they run out the restaurant. A little later the women run into Jules and start a conversation about sexual harassment from men. After an insulting remark by Phileine, Jules departs. Only then does she discover that Jules is not female but male. Phileine goes to meet LT, the boyfriend of 'terrible Joanna', on his boat on the water. They have sex in 'revenge' for the escapade between Joanna and Max on stage. The next day, they decide to go to the last performance of the show. From the back of the theater, they see that Max is about to penetrate Joanna on stage. This time, Phileine will not let this happen and makes a huge scene by disrupting the play. Max tries to defend his action by explaining it as art. Phileine doesn‚Äôt accept this and gets the audience on her side in the argument. The day after, the newspapers are filled with what happened in the theater and Phileine is requested for a number of TV shows. She goes to David Letterman's show where she takes control over the show and wins the support of the audience. She is provided with money so she can stay the night in a hotel. The next day, Max is at her door to take her to an AIDS Gala of his friend Leonard. She doesn‚Äôt want to go with him, so he lifts her up over his shoulder and takes her to a taxi. The atmosphere between Phileine and the other people is hostile at the Gala. Except for Gulpje, Phileine has offended everybody else. Even Max is furious at her because he finds out she has slept with LT. Eventually Phileine realizes why everyone is mad at her. She gets on the stage and delivers a speech in which she says sorry for the first time in her life to everyone who she has treated rudely. She ends the speech with: \\"Sorry that I exist.\\" Cast * Kim van Kooten - Phileine * Michiel Huisman - Max * Hadewych Minis - Gulpje * Tara Elders - Lala * Kenan Raven - LT * Mads Wittermans - Christiaan * Leona Philippo - Joanna * Liesbeth Kamerling - Fleur * Roeland Fernhout - Jules  External links  * (in Dutch) * Category:2003 films Category:2003 romantic comedy-drama films Category:Dutch films Category:Dutch-language films Category:English-language films Category:Films based on Dutch novels Category:Films set in the Netherlands Category:Films set in the United States Category:Dutch romantic comedy-drama films Category:2003 comedy films Category:2003 drama films ","title":"Phileine Says Sorry"},{"id":"2540715","text":"Tremissis from M√©rida, minted during his reign.

It was the birthplace and childhood home of William Howard Taft, the 27th President of the United States and the 10th Chief Justice of the United States. It is a two-story Greek Revival house built circa 1835. History William Howard Taft's father, Alphonso Taft, came to Cincinnati from Vermont in 1838 to establish a law practice. He moved his family to this house a little over a decade later. Alphonso Taft became an early supporter of the Republican Party in Cincinnati. He lived in this house with his family and parents. He would eventually serve as the 31st United States Secretary of War and the 35th United States Attorney General. The house is believed to have been built in the early 1840s by a family named Bowen. Alphonso bought the house at 60 Auburn Street (now 2038 Auburn Avenue), with its accompanying 1.82 acres, for $10,000 on June 13, 1851. Mount Auburn was once a popular area to live for upper-class Cincinnatians, as it allowed those of higher incomes to escape the sweltering heat and humidity of downtown Cincinnati summers. The Taft residence, a Greek Revival domicile, was relatively modest compared to other nearby residences, which were a mix of Second Empire, Italianate, and Georgian Revival.William Howard Taft National Historic Site - Things To Do (U.S. National Park Service)National Park Service - The Presidents (Taft National Historic Site) Alphonso's wife Fanny Phelps Taft died a year after the family moved to the Mount Auburn residence, in June 1852. In December 1853 Alphonso remarried, choosing a schoolteacher from Massachusetts named Louise Torrey. Louise Taft would give birth to their second child, William Howard Taft, in the house on September 15, 1857, presumably in the first-floor nursery in the rear ell. (The first child had died at age fourteen months from whooping cough.) Alphonso had six children living in the house, two by Fanny (three others had died beforehand) and four by Louise. The house was used for social events. Visitors included many local and state dignitaries, including future President James A. Garfield. Rugs in the parlor were often rolled up for dancing. Family activities took place in the library; Alphonso was an avid book collector. William would live in the house until he went to Yale University in 1874. Afterward, the Taft family would spend less time in the house, starting when Alphonso served in the Ulysses S. Grant administration. In 1877 a fire damaged the second floor and roof. Alphonso and Louise would lease the house in 1889, moving to California because the climate was thought to be beneficial for those with declining health. William had married in 1886, and the rest of the Taft sons had moved out by this point as well. In May 1891 Alphonso died in San Diego, California, and was buried in Cincinnati; the tenants of the Auburn house allowed the mourners to gather at the house for the funeral. Louise eventually was able to sell the house outright, after ten years of trying, in 1899 to Judge Albert C. Thompson, after returning to her home town of Millbury, Massachusetts, to live with her sister. William Howard Taft's Boyhood Home-Reading 1 Post-Taft ownership View of the house, 1970 Within five years of the house leaving the Taft family, the front veranda was removed, replaced by a one-story porch. Other modifications were the addition of a conservatory and the demolition of outbuildings, including a stable. Upon Thompson's death the house was sold by his widow to Colonel Ernest H. Ruffner in 1912. Upon Ruffner's death it was sold by his daughter. The William Howard Taft Memorial Association was formed on July 7, 1937, in hopes of buying the property, but went without support of the Taft family, as Robert Taft thought it would look too opportunistic to memorialize the house his father grew up in, and thus failed in acquiring the $12,000 to buy it. In the 1940s the building was used as apartments, with the new owner Elbert R. Bellinger once considering selling it to become a funeral parlor for local blacks. Taft family political fortunes faltered with Robert's death in 1953, and with Charles Phelps Taft II available to spearhead the movement, the William Howard Taft Memorial Association eventually acquired the house for $35,000 (the assessment price), instead of the $75,000 Bellinger was demanding for it.William Howard Taft NHS: An Administrative History (Chapter 2) Street view of the house By 1961, the house was in poor condition and needed restoration, to the tune of $92,500. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964. A ceremony on September 15, 1964 (William's 107th birthday), celebrated the home becoming a National Historic Landmark. The association gained full title to the house in 1968 and in 1969 transferred it to the National Park Service, which currently operates the site as a historic house museum, so that its future upkeep is ensured. The United States government took the property title on November 1, 1970.

The first is the original home owned by William Howard Taft's parents, Alphonso and Louise Taft. It has been restored to look as it did during the time William lived there. All the family portraits and many of the books on display belonged to the Taft family. The first floor has five rooms restored: William's birthplace, and four rooms representative of the period. The furniture is period pieces and did not necessarily belong to the Tafts. The second floor contains exhibits on the accomplishments of William. The second building is the National Historic Site's Visitor Center, officially called the Taft Education Center. It has offices, a National Park giftshop, an audio- animatronic exhibit of William's son Charles Phelps Taft II fishing and telling stories about his father and other members of the Taft family, and a short biographical film on William Howard Taft.

Etymology and origins Paschimottanasana illustrated in an 1830 manuscript of the Jogapradipika The name comes from the Sanskrit words paschima (‡§™‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö‡§ø‡§Æ, pa≈õcima) meaning \\"west\\" or \\"the back of the body\\"; uttana (‡§â‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§æ‡§®, uttƒÅna) meaning \\"intense stretch\\" or \\"straight\\" or \\"extended\\"; and asana (‡§Ü‡§∏‡§®, ƒÅsana) meaning \\"posture\\" or \\"seat\\". The pose is described in the 15th-century Hatha Yoga Pradipika, chapter 1, verses 28-29.  Description  The pose is entered from Dandasana (the seated Staff Pose) by bending forward from the hips without straining and grasping the feet or lower legs. A strap may be placed around the feet and grasped in the hands if the back is stiff. The head may be rested on a folded blanket or bolster, which may be raised on a small stool if necessary. People who have difficulty bending their backs should exercise caution when performing this asana. Variations Urdhva Mukha Paschimottanasana is a balancing form of the pose, legs and hands pointing upwards. Parivritta Paschimottanasana is the reversed or twisted form of the pose, the body twisted to one side and the hands reversed, so that if the body is turned to the left, the right hand grasps the left foot, the right elbow is over the left knee, and the left hand grasps the right foot. Trianga Mukhaikapada Paschimottanasana has one leg bent as in Virasana. Ardha Baddha Padma Paschimottanasana has one leg crossed over the other as in Padmasana.

He ruled from 603 to 610. Rise to power The first mention of Witteric in history was as a conspirator with , the Arian bishop of M√©rida, to reestablish Arianism in 589. While Sunna was sent into exile, it is unknown what happened to Witteric.Lives of the Fathers of Merida, 5.10; Peter Heather, The Goths (Oxford: Blackwell, 1996), pp. 282f In the spring of 602, Witteric was given command of the army with the job of expelling the Byzantines. However, when it came time to do so in the Spring of 603, Witteric instead led his troops against King Liuva II, counting on the support of a faction of nobles in opposition to the dynasty of Leovigild. He invaded the royal palace and deposed the young king. Witteric cut off the king's right hand, and then had him condemned and executed in the summer of 603.Isidore of Seville, Historia de regibus Gothorum, Vandalorum et Suevorum, chapter 57. Translation by Guido Donini and Gordon B. Ford, Isidore of Seville's History of the Goths, Vandals, and Suevi, second revised edition (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1970), p. 27 Reign During his reign, the Visigoths fought the Byzantines. However, Isidore of Seville is dismissive of Witteric's accomplishments, writing that \\"although he frequently fought battles against the Roman soldiers, he did not win any adequate glory except for capturing some soldiers at Sagunto with the help of his generals.\\" The campaign against Sagunto probably took place in 605.Isidore, chapter 58; translated by Donini and Ford, p. 27 It was probably during his reign, as well, that Bigastrum (near Cartago Nova) was taken, as its bishop appears in a council of Toledo in 610. In the twelfth year of his reign, king Theodoric II sent for bishop Aridius of Lyons and the constable Eborin to ask Witteric for his daughter Ermenburga's hand in marriage. Although the envoys gave their word that she would not be disowned by Theodoric, and she was received by Theodoric in Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne (606), his grandmother, the regent Brunhilda and Theodoric's sister Teudila (or Teudilana) did not provide a welcoming reception. Theodoric then disgraced Ermenberga by sending her back without her dowry. Incensed, Witteric entered into a quadruple alliance with Theodobert II of Austrasia, Clotaire II of Neustria, and Agilulf of the Lombards to effect his deposition and death. Despite their mutual fear of Theodoric, their alliance did not accomplish anything; according to Fredegar, \\"Theodoric got wind of it [the alliance] but treated it with utter contempt.\\".J. M. Wallace-Hadrill, translator, The Fourth Book of the Chronicle of Fredegar with its Continuations (Westport: Greenwood Press, 1960), p. 21 Assassination  In April 610, a faction of Catholic nobles conspired against Witteric and assassinated him during a banquet. His body was dragged ignominiously through the streets and he was later buried without the honors corresponding to his status.Rachel L. Stocking, Bishops, Councils, and Consensus in the Visigothic Kingdom, 589-633 (University of Michigan Press, 2000), p. 119. The nobles then proclaimed Gundemar, Duke of Narbonne, king.

The film, based on an early 18th century court record from Cape Town, explores the romantic relationship between two prisoners, one black and one white, at Robben Island in South Africa in the 18th century.Michelle MacArthur, Lydia Wilkinson and Keren Zaiontz (eds.) Although the film premiered at the 2003 Toronto International Film Festival, it did not have a general theatrical release until 2005. Plot Set in 18th-century South Africa, the film dramatizes the true story of Claas Blank (Rouxnet Brown) and Rijkhaart Jacobsz (Neil Sandilands), two prisoners on Robben Island. Herder Claas Blank was serving 10 years for \\"insulting a Dutch citizen\\" and Rijkhaart was a Dutch sailor convicted of committing \\"unnatural acts\\" with another man. The two men, initially hostile to each other, form a secret relationship, using trips to a private water tank to bond. Their relationship had a racial component, as Jacobsz was a white Dutchman, while Blank was a black Khoi. Virgil Niven (Shawn Smyth), a Scottish botanist, befriends Blank for his knowledge of South African flora, including the protea. It is suggested that he may have had a sexual interest in Blank. In 1735, Blank and Jacobsz were executed for sodomy by drowning, after jealousy by other inmates caused problems. The film ends with an extract from the speech Nelson Mandela made at his sentencing hearing in 1964, before he was imprisoned on Robben Island.Gary M. Kramer  Analysis  The film explores unanswered questions, such as why prison officials tolerated the relationship for a full decade before Blank and Jacobsz were executed. In an interview packaged with the DVD release, John Greyson notes the real Blank and Jacobsz began their relationship when they were both teenagers‚ÄîBlank having been imprisoned on Robben Island at age 16‚Äîand were actually known to be a couple for twenty years before they were charged with sodomy and executed, when they were both nearly 40. Intentional anachronisms, such as transistor radios, electric typewriters and jeeps, are used in the film to illustrate Greyson's larger theme that homophobia and racism of the type that led to Blank's and Jacobsz' executions remain very much present in the world. These twentieth-century objects, including contemporary (c. 1964) dress on many occasions, appear in juxtaposition with eighteenth-century items. The eighteenth-century prison commandant, for example, is replaced by a former subordinate who wears a twentieth-century guard's uniform and is often accompanied by a fierce-looking Alsatian on a short lead. A wet bag, a torture devise from Apartheid South Africa, is seen.

Dennis Harvey of Variety stated that the \\"film has enough erotic and exotic content to win arthouse viewers\\" but it \\"lacks lush aesthetics and impassioned complexity, ending up a tad remote\\". Giving the film 3 out of 4 stars, Ken Fox of TV Guide said \\"the postmodern touches never detract from what is at heart a deeply moving love story\\". Dave Kehr of the New York Times stated \\"a heavy, pretentious and derivative film\\" and it had been \\"gussied it up with fantasy sequences and formal games that distract from the dramatic core\\".

It is one of the most widely consumed cooking oils and the second most consumed vegetable oil.https://www.statista.com/statistics/263937/vegetable-oils-global- consumption/ As a drying oil, processed soybean oil is also used as a base for printing inks (soy ink) and oil paints. History Chinese records dating prior to 2000 B.C. mention use of cultivated soybeans to produce edible soy oil. Ancient Chinese literature reveals that soybeans were extensively cultivated and highly valued as a use for the soybean oil production process before written records were kept. Production Soybean oil, meal and beans To produce soybean oil, the soybeans are cracked, adjusted for moisture content, heated to between 60 and 88 ¬∞C (140‚Äì190 ¬∞F), rolled into flakes, and solvent-extracted with hexanes. The oil is then refined, blended for different applications, and sometimes hydrogenated. Soybean oils, both liquid and partially hydrogenated are sold as \\"vegetable oil,\\" or are ingredients in a wide variety of processed foods. Most of the remaining residue (soybean meal) is used as animal feed. In the 2002‚Äì2003 growing season, 30.6 million tons (MT) of soybean oil were produced worldwide, constituting about half of worldwide edible vegetable oil production, and thirty percent of all fats and oils produced, including animal fats and oils derived from tropical plants.United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Statistics 2004 . Table 3-51. In 2018‚Äì2019, world production was at 57.4 MT with the leading producers including China (16.6 MT), US (10.9 MT), Argentina (8.4 MT), Brazil (8.2 MT), and EU (3.2 MT). Composition Per 100 g, soybean oil has 16 g of saturated fat, 23 g of monounsaturated fat, and 58 g of polyunsaturated fat. The major unsaturated fatty acids in soybean oil triglycerides are the polyunsaturates alpha-linolenic acid (C-18:3), 7-10%, and linoleic acid (C-18:2), 51%; and the monounsaturate oleic acid (C-18:1), 23%. It also contains the saturated fatty acids stearic acid (C-18:0), 4%, and palmitic acid (C-16:0), 10%. The high-proportion of oxidation-prone polyunsaturated fatty acid is undesirable for some uses, such as cooking oils. Three companies, Monsanto Company, DuPont/Bunge, and Asoyia in 2004 introduced low linolenic Roundup Ready soybeans. Hydrogenation may be used to reduce the unsaturation in linolenic acid. The resulting oil is called hydrogenated soybean oil. If the hydrogenation is only partially complete, the oil may contain small amounts of trans fat. = Comparison to other vegetable oils =  Applications  = Food = Soybean oil is mostly used for frying and baking. It is also used as a condiment for salads. = Drying oils = Soybean oil is one of many drying oils, which means that it will slowly harden (due to free-radical based polymerization) upon exposure to air, forming a flexible, transparent, and waterproof solid. Because of this property, it is used in some printing ink and oil paint formulations. However, other oils (such as linseed oil) may be superior for some drying oil applications. = Medical uses = Soybean oil is indicated for parenteral nutrition as a source of calories and essential fatty acids. = Fixative for insect repellents = While soybean oil has no direct insect repellent activity, it is used as a fixative to extend the short duration of action of essential oils such as geranium oil in several commercial products. Trading Soybean oil is traded at the Chicago Board of Trade in contracts of 60,000 pounds at a time. Prices are listed in cents and hundredths of a cent per pound.

Vyssotsky, Robert Morris Sr., and M. Douglas McIlroy. (Dennis Ritchie is sometimes incorrectly cited as a co-author, but was not involved.) The game was developed at Bell Labs, and played on an IBM 7090 mainframe there. The game was only played for a few weeks before Morris developed an \\"ultimate\\" program that eventually brought the game to an end, as no-one managed to produce anything that could defeat it. Description The game consisted of a program called the umpire and a designated section of the computer's memory known as the arena, into which two or more small programs, written by the players, were loaded. The programs were written in 7090 machine code, and could call a number of functions provided by the umpire in order to probe other locations within the arena, kill opposing programs, and claim vacant memory for copies of themselves. The game ended after a set amount of time, or when copies of only one program remained alive. The player who wrote the last surviving program was declared winner. Up to 20 memory locations within each program (fewer in later versions of the game) could be designated as protected. If one of these protected locations was probed by another program, the umpire would immediately transfer control to the program that was probed. This program would then continue to execute until it, in turn, probed a protected location of some other program, and so forth. While the programs were responsible for copying and relocating themselves, they were forbidden from altering memory locations outside themselves without permission from the umpire. As the programs were executed directly by the computer, there was no physical mechanism in place to prevent cheating. Instead, the source code for the programs was made available for study after each game, allowing players to learn from each other and to verify that their opponents hadn't cheated. The smallest program that could reproduce, locate enemies and kill them consisted of about 30 instructions. McIlroy developed a 15-instruction program that could locate and kill enemies but not reproduce; while not very lethal, it was effectively unkillable, as it was shorter than the limit of 20 protected instructions. In later games the limit on protected instructions was lowered because of this. The \\"ultimately lethal\\" program developed by Morris had 44 instructions, and employed an adaptive strategy. Once it successfully located the start of an enemy program, it would probe some small distance ahead of this location. If it succeeded in killing the enemy, it would remember the distance and use it on subsequent encounters. If it instead hit a protected location, then the next time it gained control it chose a different distance. Any new copies were initialized with a successful value. In this way, Morris's program evolved into multiple subspecies, each specifically adapted to kill a particular enemy.

Despite its family-oriented marketing, Air Baron plays far more like a wargame than a typical family money-driven game like Monopoly. Air Baron is for two to six players, adjusting the playable area and victory conditions accordingly. Gameplay Air Baron challenges players to build an airline empire in the United States by amassing a plurality of market share and liquid assets. Players seek to gain dominance or control of hubs in order to amass market share. Dominance of a hub is gained by controlling the majority of associated domestic spokes; it carries a moderate income potential and market share gain. Control of a hub is gained by controlling all of the associated domestic spokes; it doubles the income potential and market share gain of dominance. Any uncontrolled domestic spoke may be purchased at face value. Takeovers of controlled spokes require a higher fee and an opposed dice roll versus the controlling player. Several factors contribute both positively and negatively to each player's dice total. If, at the end of his turn, a player has a combined total of market share and cash equal to or greater than the victory margin, he wins. =Play order= At the start of each round, one color-coded chit per player is placed in a cup. The chits are drawn sequentially to determine the current order of play. While the order of play in an individual round is generally unimportant, the interval between turns for a single player is a significant consideration. =Starting cash on hand= Starting cash is determined by die roll. To offset the advantage of first play, each player receives cumulatively more money during the initial turn. =Income= Every purchased spoke, plus all hubs, have a unique chit placed in a cup. At the start of every turn, the player randomly draws two chits, paying the owner appropriately. Chits are replaced at the end of each round. =Additional purchases= Beyond the primary domestic spokes, players can also purchase foreign spokes and jumbo jets. Foreign spokes benefit opposed takeovers at the associated hubs. Jumbo jets provide similar bonuses on the domestic spoke where deployed, or they can be held in reserve for later use in an opposed takeover. Additionally, spokes with jumbos pay double the usual rate. =Offensive operations= Normally players are limited to one purchase or takeover attempt per turn. However, players can declare a state of Fare Wars that allow an indefinite number of domestic takeover attempts provided: *The player has sufficient funds *The player does not fail an attempt While in Fare Wars, players receive an additional takeover dice roll bonus. Profits, however, are not earned while in Fare Wars. Since the state can only be entered or exited at the beginning of a player's turn, the randomized play order has a major impact on the potential for income loss. =Optional rules= Several optional rules, including strikes, crashes, government loans, and bidding, are provided as part of an advanced version. These rules may be added to the basic game collectively or individually as desired.

Reign Sisenand was the governor of Septimania, when the nobles revolted against the Visigothic king, Suintila, over the latter's confiscations of lands and distribution of privileges between the nobility and clergy. Sisenand joined the rebellion and overthrew Suintila with the aid of Dagobert I, King of the Franks, to whom Gothic nobles offered a plate of pure gold in return, weighing 500 pounds. The plate was allegedly a gift that Aetius, a Roman general, gave to Thorismund, then king of the Visigoths, in 451. After successfully overthrowing Suintila and capturing Zaragoza on 26 March 631, Sisenand proclaimed himself king. The victory of Sisenand also represented the triumph of the nobility over the common people, although the greatest beneficiary was the clergy, who took advantage of the weariness of the other contenders to enhance their own influence. Upon assuming the throne, he had Suintila, the previous king, declared a tyrant for his many crimes, iniquity, and accumulation of wealth at the expense of the poor; he also removed all taxes on the clergy. Between 632 and 633, there was apparently an attempted uprising within the kingdom, led by Iudila, only attested to by two coins from M√©rida and Granada bearing the inscription IUDILA REX.. The revolution failed, and Iudila was later killed. In order to obtain ecclesiastical conformity, on 8 December 633, Sisenand convoked the IV Council of Toledo, which drew up civil and ecclesiastical laws within the Visigothic kingdom, including the death penalty, excommunication, and condemnation to perpetual perdition for those rebelling against the king. Similar penalties were approved for those who wished to dispense with such law of choice. However, the council did not concede any hereditary right to the king; the next king would be elected by the bishops and magnates from one of their own. Sisenand died a natural death in the city of Toledo on 12 March 636. Chintila was chosen by the bishops to succeed him.

It is a traditional fishing boat, but newer uses include \\"Jukung Dives\\", using the boat as a vehicle for small groups of SCUBA divers. The double outrigger jukung is but one of many types of Austronesian outrigger canoes that use the crab claw sail traditional throughout Polynesia. Whilst this sail presents some difficulties in tacking into the wind, actually requiring to jibe around, a jukung is superb in its reaching ability and jibe-safe running. They are usually highly decorated and bear a marlin-like prow. People in Kalimantan also named their boat Jukung. It is used for transport in daily activities such as going to the office, to school, or shopping in pasar terapung (The Floating Market, a very famous tourist attraction). Currently there is a modern version of jukung made from High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) pipe in Indonesia. Advertised as unsinkable, the main body is made of a closed HDPE pipe that contains sealed air as the source of its buoyancy.  Type of jukung  * Jukung gede (in Balinese language gede means large). A large type of jukung used for transporting 4-5 cows from Bali to Nusa Penida in Lombok strait, often seen in Kusamba beach.Horridge (1981). p.189. * Jukung payangan. This is the big and famous fish catcher from salompeng. The hull is about 15 m long with 5 crewmen. Payang itself refers to a type of seine used by local fishermen. * Jukung polangan. The usual type of jukung at Sepulu, with projecting rear end, boom- spar and five seats (called polangan). The front and back \\"fins\\" were carved and painted with gold. The hull is using Madurese jukung style. The great Jukung race A jukung on a beach, from the Tropenmuseum archives (c. 1970) In the late 1980s there was a seafaring journey of over 1000 nautical miles in open outrigger ‚Äòjukung‚Äô canoes by nine crews, who sailed from Bali to Darwin across the Timor Sea. Crews were from New Zealand, Australia, USA, England, Japan, France, Germany, The Netherlands and Indonesia. This was a three-month expedition masterminded by Bob Hobmann, filmed and made into a documentary called \\"Passage out of Paradise\\"; it was featured by the National Geographic Society as \\"The Great Jukung Race\\". It was the first ever expedition of this kind, following purported Austronesian sailing routes in craft dating 7,000 years old. The expedition started in Bali, where once crews were familiar with sailing their Jukungs they embarked on a two-month adventure following the ancient sailing routes (1,000 yrs BC), along the eastern Islands via Komodo Island. They completed the journey with a treacherous 5 day sail across the Arafura Sea to Darwin, via the Tiwi Islands. Challenges experienced were storms requiring numerous boat repairs, waterspouts, excessive exposure to sun, heat, or rain, adverse currents & whirlpools. Hazards included drifting onto war-torn Timor, unpredictable behaviour/welcome from remote villagers, salt water boils, wound infections, malnutrition, near misses with night-time freighters, sightings of sperm whales and giant white sharks. Some sailors were viciously attacked by hornets while preparing to leave a remote beach camp. The crews rebelled & unanimously decided to sail as a group, as opposed to racing the final leg of the journey, for safety. As a result, all sailors miraculously survived a cyclone >110 km/hr winds in their tiny (6 ft long, 50 cm wide) primitive bamboo/rope jukungs, although the Australian crew was lost for 2 days, located by the Australian coastguard, with a smashed jukung washed up on an island. The fleet of 9 jukungs and 18 international sailors were given a traditional welcome by local Melville Island Aborigines, and successfully reached their final destination of Darwin, Australia.

Among these is the 9th century Laguna Copperplate Inscription found in 1989, deciphered in 1992 to be Kavi script (Pallava alphabet) with Sanskrit words;Postma, Antoon. (1992), The Laguna Copper-Plate Inscription: Text and Commentary, Philippine Studies, 40(2):183‚Äì203 the golden Agusan statue (Golden Tara) discovered in another part of Philippines in 1917 has also been linked to Hinduism. Hinduism today There is some growth in the religion as of late, although most temples cater to the same communities. Actual adherents of Hinduism are mostly limited to communities that include indigenous and native peoples, expatriate communities, as well as new converts. There are various ISKCON groups and popular Hindu personalities and groups such as Sathya Sai Baba, and Paramahansa Yogananda (SRF), Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar (Ananda Marga) that can be found. The Ramakrishna Mission is also present as the VedƒÅnta Society of the Philippines.http://www.belurmath.org/branch-centres/ Hindu based practices like Yoga and meditation are also popular. There are also notable archery ranges named after characters in the Ramayana and the Mahabharata called \\"Kodanda Archery Range\\" (named after Lord Rama's bow Kodanda) and \\"Gandiva Archery\\" (named after Arjuna's bow Gandiva). One source estimated the size of the Indian community in the Philippines in 2008 at 150,000 persons.Most of whom are Hindus and Christians. At present, however, it is limited primarily to the immigrant Indian community, though traditional religious beliefs in most parts of the country have strong Hindu and Buddhist influences. Over the last three decades, a large number of civil servants and highly educated Indians working in large banks, Asian Development Bank and the BPO sector have migrated to Philippines, especially Manila. Most of the Indian Filipinos and Indian expatriates are Hindu, Sikh or Muslims, but have assimilated into Filipino culture and some are Catholic . The community regularly conducts philanthropic activities through bodies such as the Mahaveer foundation, The SEVA foundation and the Sathya Sai organization. Most Hindus congregate for socio-cultural and religious activities at the Hindu Temple (Mahatma Gandhi Street, Paco, Manila), the Indian Sikh Temple (United Nations Avenue, Paco, Manila), and the Radha Soami Satsang Beas center (Alabang, Muntinlupa City, Metro Manila). The late \\"priest\\" (scripture reader in Sindhi and Gurumukhi) of the Hindu Temple, Giani Joginder Singh Sethi, was active in interfaith affairs, accepted visits by school students, and organised the first major translation of Guru Nanak's Jap Ji into Filipino (Tagalog), translated by Usha Ramchandani and edited by Samuel Salter (published 2001). There are two Hindu temples in Manila city-Hari Ram Temple (Paco) and Saya Aur Devi Mandir Temple (Paco).  History  Expansion of Hinduism in Southeast Asia. The Laguna Copperplate Inscription (above) found in 1989 suggests Indian cultural influence in the Philippines by late 9th century AD, likely through Hinduism in Indonesia, prior to the arrival of European colonial empires in the 16th century. Golden Agusan image statue of Hindu-Buddhist Tara deity, 1000‚Äì1200 CE. The archipelagos of Southeast Asia were under the influence of Hindu Odisha and Indonesian traders through the ports of Malay-Indonesian islands. Indian religions, possibly an amalgamated version of Hindu-Buddhist arrived in Philippines archipelago in the 1st millennium, through the Indonesian kingdom of Srivijaya followed by Majapahit. Archeological evidence suggesting exchange of ancient spiritual ideas from India to the Philippines includes the 1.79 kilogram, 21 carat gold Hindu goddess Agusan (sometimes referred to as Golden Tara), found in Mindanao in 1917 after a storm and flood exposed its location.Golden Tara Government of the Philippines The statue now sits in the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, and is dated from the period 13th to early 14th centuries. Juan Francisco suggests that the golden Agusan statue may be a representation of goddess Sakti of the Siva-Buddha (Bhairava) tradition found in Java, in which the religious aspect of Shiva is integrated with those found in Buddhism of Java and Sumatra. The Rajahnate of Butuan, in present-day Agusan del Norte and Butuan City, used Hinduism as its main religion along with indigenous Lumad nature-worships. A Hindu Tamil King of the Rajahnate of Cebu was also recorded.Juan Francisco (1963), A Note on the Golden Image of Agusan, Philippine Studies vol. 11, no. 3 (1963): 390‚Äî400 Another gold artifact, from the Tabon Caves in the island of Palawan, is an image of Garuda, the bird who is the mount of Vishnu. The discovery of sophisticated Hindu imagery and gold artifacts in Tabon Caves has been linked to those found from Oc Eo, in the Mekong Delta in Southern Vietnam. These archaeological evidence suggests an active trade of many specialized goods and gold between India and Philippines and coastal regions of Vietnam and China. Golden jewelry found so far include rings, some surmounted by images of Nandi ‚Äì the sacred bull, linked chains, inscribed gold sheets, gold plaques decorated with repouss√© images of Hindu deities.Anna T.

Journal of Southeast Asian Archaeology 17: 30‚Äì37 In 1989, a laborer working in a sand mine at the mouth of Lumbang River near Laguna de Bay found a copper plate in Barangay Wawa, Lumban. This discovery, is now known as the Laguna Copperplate Inscription by scholars. It is the earliest known written document found in the Philippines, dated to be from the 9th century AD, and was deciphered in 1992 by Dutch anthropologist Antoon Postma. The copperplate inscription suggests economic and cultural links between the Tagalog people of Philippines with the Javanese Medang Kingdom, the Srivijaya empire, and the Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms of India. Hinduism in the country declined when Islam was introduced by traders from Arabia which was then followed by Christianity from Spain. This is an active area of research as little is known about the scale and depth of Philippine history from the 1st millennium and before. Folklore, arts and literature Many fables and stories in Filipino Culture are linked to Indian arts, such as the story of the monkey and the turtle, the race between deer and snail (slow and steady wins the race), and the hawk and the hen. Similarly, the major epics and folk literature of Philippines show common themes, plots, climax and ideas expressed in the Mahabharata and the Ramayana.Maria Halili (2010), Philippine History, , Rex Books, 2nd Edition, pp. 46‚Äì47 According to Indologists Juan R. Francisco and Josephine Acosta Pasricha, Hindu influences and folklore arrived in Philippines by about 9th to 10th century AD.Mellie Leandicho Lopez (2008), A Handbook of Philippine Folklore, University of Hawaii Press, , pp xxiv ‚Äì xxv The Maranao version is the Maharadia Lawana (King RƒÅva·πáa of Hindu Epic Ramayana).Manuel, E. Arsenio (1963), A Survey of Philippine Folk Epics, Asian Folklore Studies, 22, pp 1‚Äì76  Language  With the advent of Spanish colonialism in the 16th century, the Philippines became a closed colony and cultural contacts with other Southeast Asian countries were limited, if not closed. In 1481, the Spanish Inquisition commenced with the permission of Pope Sixtus IV and all non-Catholics within the Spanish empire were to be expelled or to be \\"put to the question\\" (tortured until they renounced their previous faith). With the re-founding of Manila in 1571, the Philippines became subject to the King of Spain, and the Archbishop of New Galicia (Mexico) became the Grand Inquisitor of the Faithful in Mexico and the Philippines. In 1595, the newly appointed Archbishop of Manila became the Inquisitor-General of the Spanish East Indies (i.e., the Philippines, Guam, and Micronesia), and until 1898 was active against Protestants, Buddhists, Hindus and Muslims.

It is not known where his coronation took place, but some historians suggest Biograd as a possibility.http://crohis.com/knjige/Sisic%20-%20pregled/17.%20Petar%20Kresimir%20IV.PDF From the outset, he continued the policies of his father, but was immediately requested in letter by Pope Nicholas II first in 1059. and then in 1060 to reform the Croatian church in accordance with the Roman rite. This was especially significant to the papacy in the aftermath of the Great Schism of 1054, when a papal ally in the Balkans was a necessity. This was in accordance with the visit of the papal legate Mainardius in 1060, Kresimir and the upper nobility lent their support to the pope and the church of Rome. Ruins of Monastery of Saint John the Evangelist in Biograd na Moru. The lower nobility and the peasantry, however, were far less well-disposed to reforms. The Croatian priesthood was aligned towards Byzantine orientalism, including having long beards and marrying. More so, the ecclesiastical service was likely practiced in the native Slavonic (Glagolitic), whereas the pope demanded practice in Latin. This caused a rebellion of the clergy led by a certain priest named Vuk (Ulfus), who was referenced as newcomer to the kingdom in sources. Vuk had presented the demands and gifts of the Croats to the Pope during his stay in Rome, but was told nothing could be accomplished without the consent of the Split see and the king.≈†i≈°iƒá, p. 516 They protested against celibacy and the Roman Rite in 1063, but they were proclaimed heretical at a synod of 1064 and excommunicated, a decision which Kre≈°imir supported. Kre≈°imir harshly quelled all opposition and sustained a firm alignment towards western Romanism, with the intent of more fully integrating the Dalmatian populace into his realm. In turn, he could then use them to balance the power caused by the growing feudal class. By the end of Kre≈°imir's reign, feudalism had made permanent inroads into Croatian society and Dalmatia had been permanently associated with the Croatian state.Marcus Tanner, Croatia ‚Äì a nation forged in war ‚Äì Yale University Press, New Haven 1997 The income from the cities further strengthened Kre≈°imir's power, and he subsequently fostered the development of more cities, such as Biograd, Nin, ≈†ibenik, Karin, and Skradin. He also had several monasteries constructed, like the Benedictine monasteries of St John the Evangelist (1060) and St Thomas (c. 1066) in Biograd, and donated much land to the Church. In 1066, he granted a charter to the new monastery of St.Mary in Zadar, where the founder and first nun was his cousin, the Abbess ƒåika. This remains the oldest Croatian monument in the city of Zadar, and became a spearhead for the reform movement. During the same year, he gave his nephew Stephen Trpimiroviƒá the office of Duke of Croatia, which designated him as his co-ruler and successor.≈†i≈°iƒá, p. 518 In 1067, the northern part of the kingdom was invaded by Ulric I, Margrave of Carniola, who occupied a part of Kvarner and the eastern coast of Istria, the March of Dalmatia. As the king was at that time preoccupied with the liturgical issues and reforms in Dalmatia, these parts were eventually liberated by his ban Demetrius Zvonimir.Nada Klaiƒá, Povijest Hrvata u ranom srednjem vijeku, Zagreb 1975., p. 377-379 =Territorial policy= Croatian Kingdom during the reign of king Petar Kre≈°imir IV It was for the first time that the high ranking office of ban started to branch during his rule, as multiple bans were for the first time mentioned in 1067. It is known that, apart from the ban of Croatia, the banate of Slavonia existed during this period, which was at this time likely held by Kre≈°imir's successor Demetrius Zvonimir.≈†i≈°iƒá, p. 526 The city of ≈†ibenik is for the first time mentioned during his rule in 1066, which was his seat for some time and is for these reasons referred as \\"Kre≈°imir's city\\" in modern times.Foster, Jane (2004). Footprint Croatia, Footprint Handbooks, 2nd ed. p. 218. In 1069, he gave the island of Maun, near Nin, to the monastery of St. Kr≈°evan in Zadar, in thanks for the \\"expansion of the kingdom on land and on sea, by the grace of the omnipotent God\\" (quia Deus omnipotens terra marique nostrum prolungavit regnum). In his surviving document, Kre≈°imir nevertheless did not fail to point out that it was \\"our own island that lies on our Dalmatian sea\\" (nostram propriam insulam in nostro Dalmatico mari sitam, que vocatur Mauni).Kralj Petar Kre≈°imir IV. Around 1070, Kre≈°imir was rumored to have murdered his brother Gojslav, who had served as the ban of Croatia until 1070. Eventually, when the rumors reached abroad, Pope Alexander II sent one of his delegates to inquire about the death of Gojslav. Only after the monarch and 12 Croatian ≈æupans had taken oath that he did not kill his brother, the Pope symbolically restored the royal power to Kre≈°imir.Tomislav Raukar, Hrvatsko srednjovjekovlje, ≈†kolska Knjiga, Zagreb, 1997 pp. 47-48 He made Dmitar Zvonimir, the new Ban of Croatia, and subsequently elevated him as his principal adviser with the title Duke of Croatia. =Relations with Byzantium and the Normans= In 1069, he had the Byzantine Empire recognize him as supreme ruler of the parts of Dalmatia Byzantium had controlled since the Croatian dynastic struggle of 997. At the time, the empire was at war both with the Seljuk Turks in Asia and the Normans in southern Italy, so Kre≈°imir took the opportunity and, avoiding an imperial nomination as proconsul or eparch, consolidated his holdings as the regnum Dalmatiae et Chroatia. This was not a formal title, but it designated a unified political-administrative territory, which had been the chief desire of the Croatian kings. diocese of Rab. During Kre≈°imir's reign, the Normans from southern Italy first became involved in Balkan politics and Kre≈°imir soon came in contact with them. After the 1071 Battle of Manzikert, where the Seljuk Turks routed the Eastern Imperial army, the Diocleans, Serbs and other Slavs instigated a rebellion of boyars in Macedonia and in 1072, Kre≈°imir is alleged to have lent his aid to this uprising. In 1075, the Normans under Peter II of Trani invaded the Dalmatian possessions of Croatia from southern Italy, most likely at the command of the Pope, who had been in a quarrel with the king of Croatia over papal politics towards his kingdom.Croatia in the Early Middle Ages: A Cultural Survey, HAZU and AGM, Zagreb p. 204 - 205 During the invasion, the Norman count Amico of Giovinazzo besieged the island of Rab for almost a month (14 April to early May). He failed in his siege of Rab, but he managed to take the island of Cres on 9 May. It was during these clashes that the Croatian king himself was captured by Amico at an unidentified location. In return for liberation, he was forced to relinquish many cities, including both his capitals, as well as Zadar, Split, and Trogir. His followers, such as the Bishop of Cres, also collected a large ransom. However, he was not liberated. Over the next two years, the Republic of Venice expelled the Normans and secured the cities for themselves.N. Klaiƒá, I. Petricioli, Zadar u srednjem vijeku do 1409., Filozofski fakultet Zadar, 1976 =Death and succession= Near the end of his reign, having no sons, Peter Kre≈°imir designated Demetrius Zvonimir as his heir. It is uncertain whether Peter died in a Norman prison during the first half of 1075.Ferdo ≈†i≈°iƒá, Povijest Hrvata; pregled povijesti hrvatskog naroda 600 ‚Äì 1918 Zagreb According to Johannes Lucius, an usurper, Slavac, succeeded to the throne sometime in 1074 and reigned only for a year before Zvonimir succeeded.Ferdo ≈†i≈°iƒá, Povijest Hrvata u vrijeme narodnih vladara;;, 1925, Zagreb Johannes Lucius, De regno Dalmatiae et Croatiae Kre≈°imir was buried in the church of St. StephenThomas e. c. 55: \\"Ibi namque magnificus vir Cresimir rex. in atrio videlicet basilice Sancti Stephani tumulatus est cum pluribus aliis regibus et reginis\\" in Solin, together with the other dukes and kings of Croatia.

Dizzy Go! The Excellent Dizzy Collection is a video game compilation published by Codemasters in November 1993. The title includes three stand alone games, based on the video game character Dizzy created by the Oliver Twins. The compilation contains, Dizzy the Adventurer, Panic Dizzy and the previously unreleased Go! Dizzy Go!.  Background  After the failure of the Aladdin Deck Enhancer, Camerica was forced to close down, and Codemasters was in financial trouble. As a result, many staff left the Oliver twins' software company, Interactive Studios, who were unable to find replacements. Dizzy The Adventurer was freely bundled with the Aladdin, and three other titles were being developed for it; Dreamworld Pogie, Go! Dizzy Go! and Wonderland Dizzy. However, after the Aladdin was abandoned, the Oliver twins decided to release all four (when completed) on the Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear to bring in some extra revenue. However, Codemasters wasn't comfortable releasing each as a full priced stand alone title, so forced them to combine the games into a compilation, but only three would fit. They abandoned the non-Dizzy oriented game, Dreamworld Pogie, and intended to release the action game Go! Dizzy Go! and the two adventure games Wonderland Dizzy and Dizzy The Adventurer. However Codemasters marketing team informed the Olivers that they couldn't release two adventure games on the one compilation. They decided that the previously released Dizzy The Adventurer was the stronger title and didn't require any further development and, as a replacement for Wonderland Dizzy, the twins included the previously released Panic Dizzy. After The Excellent Dizzy Collection was released, the Oliver twins left Codemasters for another publisher and with the intellectual property split between Codemasters and the Oliver twins no more Dizzy games were ever produced, although both companies have since said they would like to revisit the series. Wonderland Dizzy was eventually released in 2015. Dreamworld Pogie remained unreleased until 2011 when an alpha build was somehow leaked online. An official release of the game finally occurred in 2017, following a successful Kickstarter campaign from the original creators.  Games  = Dizzy the Adventurer = Dizzy the Adventurer is an enhanced version of the previously released Dizzy Prince of the Yolkfolk that was bundled with the Aladdin Deck Enhancer for the Oliver twin's publisher (Codemasters/Camerica) ill-fated NES peripheral. The title had not previously been released on the Sega platforms so was originally going to be released as a stand-alone game but publisher Codemasters was uncomfortable releasing it at full price. = Panic Dizzy = The game was originally released as a stand- alone product, Dizzy Panic!, for the Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64, but was later included as a last-minute replacement for Wonderland Dizzy. Codemasters felt that two adventure games should not be included on the one compilation, so the Oliver Twins decided to leave Dizzy the Adventurer and replace Wonderland Dizzy (which was eventually released in October 2015) with Panic Dizzy to complement the other two game styles. = Go! Dizzy Go! = Go! Dizzy Go! was originally to be released on the NES for the Aladdin; however, due to its unexpected failure, the title was then planned for release as a stand-alone title for the Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear. However, the publisher, Codemasters, was uncomfortable releasing it separately at full price, so included it as part of The Excellent Dizzy Collection. Quattro Arcade, released for the NES in 1992, featured Go! Dizzy Go!. The game is an arcade-style puzzle game where the player must navigate the Dizzy through a series of mazes similar to the Adventures of Lolo games.

As with other types of aphasia, the symptoms that accompany PPA depend on what parts of the left hemisphere are significantly damaged. However, unlike most other aphasias, PPA results from continuous deterioration in brain tissue, which leads to early symptoms being far less detrimental than later symptoms. Those with PPA slowly lose the ability to speak, write, read, and generally comprehend language. Eventually, almost every patient becomes mute and completely loses the ability to understand both written and spoken language. Although it was first described as solely impairment of language capabilities while other mental functions remain intact, it is now recognized that many, if not most of those afflicted suffer from impairment of memory, short term memory formation and loss of executive functions. It was first described as a distinct syndrome by M.Marsel Mesulam in 1982. Primary progressive aphasias have a clinical and pathological overlap with the frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) spectrum of disorders and Alzheimer's disease. However, PPA is not considered synonymous to Alzheimer's disease due to the fact that, unlike those affected by Alzheimer's disease, those with PPA are generally able to maintain the ability to care for themselves, remain employed, and pursue interests and hobbies. Moreover, in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Pick's disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, progressive deterioration of comprehension and production of language is just one of the many possible types of mental deterioration, such as the progressive decline of memory, motor skills, reasoning, awareness, and visuospatial skills.  Causes  Currently, the specific causes for PPA and other degenerative brain disease similar to PPA are unknown. Autopsies have revealed a variety of brain abnormalities in people who had PPA. These autopsies, as well as imaging techniques such as CT scans, MRI, EEG, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and positron emission tomography (PET), have generally revealed abnormalities to be almost exclusively in the left hemisphere. Risk factors There have been no large epidemiological studies on the incidence and prevalence of the PPA variants. Though it most likely has been underestimated, onset of PPA has been found to occur in the sixth or seventh decade. There are no known environmental risk factors for the progressive aphasias. However, one observational, retrospective study suggested that vasectomy could be a risk factor for PPA in men. These results have yet to be replicated or demonstrated by prospective studies. PPA is not considered a hereditary disease. However, relatives of a person with any form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration, including PPA, are at slightly greater risk of developing PPA or another form of the condition. In a quarter of patients diagnosed with PPA, there is a family history of PPA or one of the other disorders in the FTLD spectrum of disorders. It has been found that genetic predisposition varies among the different PPA variants, with PNFA being more commonly familial in nature than LPA or SD. The most convincing genetic basis of PPA has been found to be a mutation in the GRN gene. Most patients with observed GRN mutations present clinical features of PNFA, but the phenotype can be atypical. Diagnosis =Diagnostic criteria= The following diagnosis criteria were defined by Mesulam: *As opposed to having followed trauma to the brain, a patient must show an insidious onset and a gradual progression of aphasia, defined as a disorder of sentence and/or word usage, affecting the production and comprehension of speech. *The disorder in question must be the only determinant on functional impairment in the activities of the patient‚Äôs daily living. *On the basis of diagnostic procedures, the disorder in question must be unequivocally attributed to a neurodegenerative process. Whether or not PPA and other aphasias are the only source of cognitive impairment in a patient is often difficult to assess because: 1) as with other neurologically degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, there are currently no reliable non-invasive diagnostic tests for aphasias, and thus neuropsychological assessments are the only tool physicians have for diagnosing patients; and 2) aphasias often affect other, non-language portions of these neuropsychological tests, such as those specific for memory. =Classification= In 2011, the classification of primary progressive aphasia was updated to include three clinical variants. Patients must first be diagnosed with PPA, and then divided into variants based on speech production features, repetition, single- word and syntax comprehension, confrontation naming, semantic knowledge, and reading/spelling. In the classical Mesulam criteria for primary progressive aphasia, there are two variants: a non-fluent type progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) and a fluent type semantic dementia (SD). A third variant of primary progressive aphasia, logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA) was then added, and is an atypical form of Alzheimer's disease. For PNFA, The core criteria for diagnosis includes agrammatism and slow, and labored speech. Inconsistent speech sound errors are also very common, including distortions, deletions, and insertions. In terms of comprehension, there are deficits in syntax and sentence comprehension due to grammatical complexity, but single- word and object comprehension is relatively maintained. The second variant, SD, presents with deficits in single-word and object comprehension. Naming impairments can be severe, specially for low-frequency objects, and can eventually lead to a more widespread semantic memory deficiency over time. The ability to read and write can also be impaired if there are irregularities between pronunciation and spelling. However, repetition and motor speech is relatively preserved. The logopenic variant involves impairments in word retrieval, sentence repetition, and phonological paraphasias, comparable to conduction aphasia. Compared to the semantic variant, single word comprehension and naming is spared, however, sentence comprehension presents difficulty because of length and grammatical complexity. Speech will include incomplete words, hesitations preceding content words, and repetition. However, these PPA subtypes differ from similar aphasias, as these subtypes do not occur acutely following trauma to the brain, such as following a stroke, due to differing functional and structural neuroanatomical patterns of involvement and the progressive nature of the disease. Treatment Due to the progressive, continuous nature of the disease, improvement over time seldom occurs in patients with PPA as it often does in patients with aphasias caused by trauma to the brain. In terms of medical approaches to treating PPA, there are currently no drugs specifically used for patients with PPA, nor are there any specifically designed interventions for PPA. A large reason for this is the limited research that has been done on this disease. However, in some cases, patients with PPA are prescribed the same drugs Alzheimer's patients are normally prescribed. The primary approach to treating PPA has been with behavioral treatment, with the hope that these methods can provide new ways for patients to communicate in order to compensate for their deteriorated abilities. Speech therapy can assist an individual with strategies to overcome difficulties. There are three very broad categories of therapy interventions for aphasia: restorative therapy approaches, compensatory therapy approaches, and social therapy approaches.Manasco, H. (2014). The Aphasias. In Introduction to Neurogenic Communication Disorders (Vol. 1, p. 91). Burlington, MA: Jones & Bartlett Learning. Rapid and sustained improvement in speech and dementia in a patient with primary progressive aphasia utilizing off-label perispinal etanercept, an anti-TNF treatment strategy also used for Alzheimer's, has been reported. A video depicting the patient's improvement was published in conjunction with the print article. These findings have not been independently replicated and remain controversial. Society In September 2016, it was reported that Terry Jones of Monty Python had been diagnosed with the condition. He later died from complications of the disease on January 21, 2020.

It was located near Tunbridge, Vermont. Funding for the camp was withdrawn only a year after its founding, along with the rest of the CCC, following the attack on Pearl Harbor, which brought the United States into World War II. The camp's namesake and inspiration was the pragmatic philosopher, William James, who delivered an influential address at Stanford University in 1906 with the title, \\"The Moral Equivalent of War\\". \\"A permanently successful peace-economy cannot be a simple pleasure-economy\\", James argued, \\"Martial virtues must be the enduring cement; intrepidity, contempt of softness, surrender of private interest, obedience to command, must still remain the rock upon which states are built.\\" To devote oneself to these martial virtues in the service of others, taking up the menial tasks of society like an army at war for the sake of peace, is a force equal to war, James argued. Rosenstock-Huessy took up this theme, calling the young men who enlisted in the Camp program, \\"soldiers\\". In 1945, Rosenstock-Huessy wrote in his book, The Christian Future: > Our peacemakers and planners must be supported by camps all over the globe, > where youth, recruited from every town and village all over the globe, > serves. This service must implement the global organization as the young > must experience what the old are planning before the old can have any > authority. Among those who had joined the short-lived work at Camp William James was a Dartmouth student, Page Smith, who later became an important American historian at the University of California, Santa Cruz. While on the faculty at UCLA, in 1962, Smith wrote a letter to Hubert Humphrey proposing an international version of the Camp William James experiment in the \\"moral equivalent of war\\". Humphrey passed along the idea to the US President, John F. Kennedy, and by 1963, the Peace Corps was created.

The Pregnant Guppy was the first of the Guppy line of aircraft produced by Aero Spacelines. The design inspired other later designs, such as the jet-powered Airbus Beluga and Boeing Dreamlifter. Development In 1960, U.S. airlines were disposing of their obsolete piston-engined Boeing 377 Stratocruisers in favor of the newer jet-engined airliners. NASA was finding that barge transport of their increasingly large space program components from manufacturers on the West Coast to test and launch sites on the East Coast was slow and expensive. Aircraft broker Leo Mansdorf was stockpiling surplus Stratocruisers at Van Nuys prior to resale, and ex-USAF pilot John M. Conroy realized the potential of these aircraft to transport the large but relatively light rocket components. Conroy presented his plans for an extensively modified Stratocruiser to NASA, where an official commented that the bloated aircraft resembled a pregnant guppy. Although NASA was lukewarm on the concept, Conroy mortgaged his house and founded Aero Spacelines International to build and operate the concept aircraft. Conversion work was undertaken by On Mark Engineering. The Pregnant Guppy (registered N1024V) was built from an ex-Pan Am airframe with a five-m section from an ex-British Overseas Airways Corporation aircraft (G-AKGJ) added immediately behind the wing. The wing, engines, tail, nose, and cockpit were unchanged, but a new upper fuselage of 6 m diameter was added, giving the aircraft a \\"triple-bubble\\" appearance in front view. The entire rear section (including tail surfaces) was detachable to allow cargo to be loaded directly into the fuselage. The aircraft first flew on September 19, 1962, piloted by Conroy and co-pilot Clay Lacy.http://www.allaboutguppys.com/ When Van Nuys traffic control realized that Conroy intended to take off, they notified police and fire departments to be on alert. However, the huge aircraft performed flawlessly, the only difference in handling being a slight decrease in speed caused by extra drag of the larger fuselage. Carrying the S-IV Saturn I rocket stage, the Guppy saved three weeks' transit time versus barge, for a cost of $16.00 (equivalent to $ today) per mile (). Operational history The Pregnant Guppy, with its tail removed, is loaded with a S-IV stage (1965) In the summer of 1963, the Pregnant Guppy began flying NASA cargo. Among its early duties was transporting the first and second stages of the Gemini program's Titan II from the Martin Co. in Baltimore, Maryland, to Cape Canaveral. As the space program grew through the late 1960s, this one aircraft clearly could not handle the whole transport load, so 25 more Stratocruisers and ex-USAF C-97s were purchased to construct four Super Guppy aircraft, which were even longer and larger than the original. The various Guppy aircraft served throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and beyond, initially transporting space components, and later, as NASA scaled down its operations after the success of the Apollo program, transporting airliner sections. The Pregnant Guppy was sold to American Jet Industries and registered N126AJ for scrap and it was finally scrapped at Van Nuys in 1979.

It is Laugier's feature film debut. The film stars Virginie Ledoyen, Catriona MacColl, Lou Doillon, and Dorina LazƒÉr. Plot In 1958, Anna Jurin accepts a job as a housekeeper of Saint Ange, a rusty and isolated orphanage located in the French Alps and owned by Madam Francard. The last batch of children have been sent elsewhere shortly after the mysterious death of a boy in the bathroom, which tarnishes the orphanage's reputation and threatens its closure. Other than Anna, the orphanage is now populated by only two people: the long-time cook Helenka and an adult orphan, Judith, who suffers from a mental disability and claims that there are other, unseen, children in the location. Throughout her stay, Anna experiences apparent supernatural phenomena. However, Helenka dismisses her worries as mere hallucinations, especially after she learns that Anna is pregnant due to a gang rape, a fact that she tries to hide at first. Anna learns that Judith is one of the many sent to Saint Ange in 1946 as a war orphan of World War II; because of shortages of supplies and logistics, Judith is the only survivor. Despite this explanation, Anna suspects that the orphanage deliberately killed and hid the children. She gains the trust of Judith by befriending and calming her when her kittens are apparently drowned by Helenka, enough for her to disclose that the children inhabit an area somewhere behind a mirror in bathroom, revealed to be an abandoned dormitory. Helenka tries to prevent them from heading to the area, but Judith knocks her unconscious. The two women proceed to the dormitory and find remains of toys and rotten food. Judith realizes that the children had really died and begs Anna to stop searching, but the latter insists on continuing and boards an elevator heading to the underground. Anna arrives at a sterile, hospital-like structure with clean white walls and brightly lit lamps. She is confronted by the children who rise from a series of murky baths, who surround her. Anna goes into a sudden labor and is helped to deliver the baby by the children. Sometime later, Francard and her assistant search for Anna in the underground, which is now damp, dark, and rust-walled. They find Anna and her baby on the floor, both dead. Deciding to leave them there, the two head upstairs to leave the premises alongside Helenka and Judith; it is implied that Anna has been hallucinating the phenomena due to the stress, as she is revealed to be the true culprit for the drowning of the kittens. However, before they leave, Judith throws away her medication, as Anna advised her earlier, and peeks into Anna's former bedroom, where she sees her and her baby, now as spirits of Saint Ange, alongside the dead children. Francard comes back for Judith and the film ends as the room is seen empty. Language According to Christophe Gans, the film was shot both in French and English.

Oil on canvas, 1855 Chintila (; 606 ‚Äì 20 December 639) was a Visigothic King of Hispania, Septimania and Galicia from 636. He succeeded Sisenand in a time of weakness and reigned until his death. Reign He was elected and confirmed by a convention of bishops and nobles in accordance with the 75th canon of the Fourth Council of Toledo. With his election, nothing changed and instability reigned. He never solved the many problems that plagued his time in office and, as the chroniclers of the age report, this included rebellions in Septimania and Gallaecia. In the three years of his reign, he permitted the bishops wide authority and they acted as monarchs de facto, if not de jure. He dedicated his time to councils, the Fifth Council of Toledo in June 636 and the Sixth Council of Toledo in June 638. These meetings covered many topics and legislated many new regulations. The king had to be chosen from among the nobility; never a tonsurado (cleric), member of the servile classes (peasants), or foreigners. They dictated the penalties for insurrection and determined that property acquired justly by the king could not be confiscated by his successor. Finally, they outlawed non-Catholics within the frontiers of the kingdom, which resulted in many forced conversions. Chintila died in 639 or 640 of natural causes and was followed by his son Tulga.

A dog's injured leg. The health of dogs is a well studied area in veterinary medicine. Infectious diseases that affect dogs are important not only from a veterinary standpoint, but also because of the risk to public health; an example of this is rabies. Genetic disorders also affect dogs, often due to selective breeding to produce individual dog breeds. Due to the popularity of both commercial and homemade dog foods, nutrition is also a heavily studied subject. Diseases Some diseases and other health problems are common to both humans and dogs; others are unique to dogs and other animals. Dogs are susceptible to various diseases; similarly to humans, they can have diabetes, epilepsy, cancer, or arthritis. =Infectious diseases= An infectious disease is caused by the presence of organisms such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites (either animalian or protozoan). Most of these diseases are spread directly from dog to dog, while others require a vector such as a tick or mosquito. Certain infectious diseases are a concern from a public health standpoint because they are zoonoses (transmittable to humans). Viral diseases Viral diseases in dogs can be serious, especially in kennels. Timely vaccination can reduce the risk and severity of an infection. The most commonly recommended viruses to vaccinate dogs against are: A rabid dog * Rabies * CDV (canine distemper) * CAV-2 (canine hepatitis virus or adenovirus-2) * Canine herpesvirus * Canine influenza * CPV-2 (canine parvovirus) *Kennel cough Bacterial diseases A number of Leptospira sp. bacteria atop a 0.1. ¬µm polycarbonate filter Bacterial diseases in dogs are usually not contagious from dog to dog; instead they are usually the result of wound colonization, opportunistic infections secondary to decreased resistance (often the result of viral infections), or secondary to other conditions (pyoderma secondary to skin allergies or pyometra secondary to cystic endometrial hyperplasia). These examples are not considered infectious diseases because they do not satisfy Koch's postulates ‚Äì for example Staphylococcus intermedius, a commonly isolated bacteria from skin infections in dogs, would not cause pyoderma when introduced to a healthy dog. In all likelihood that type of bacteria is already present on the skin of a healthy dog. There are some bacteria that are contagious from dog to dog. The most notable of these are Bordetella bronchiseptica, one of the causes of kennel cough, Leptospira sp, which cause leptospirosis, and Brucella canis, cause of brucellosis in dogs. There are also common tick-borne bacterial diseases, including Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by bacteria of the genus Leptospira. Humans and dogs become infected through contact with water, food, or soil containing urine from infected animals. This may happen by swallowing contaminated food or water or through skin contact, especially with mucosal surfaces, such as the eyes or nose, or with broken skin. In dogs, transmission most commonly occurs by drinking puddle, pond, or ditch water contaminated by urine from infected wildlife such as squirrels or raccoons. The liver and kidney are most commonly damaged by leptospirosis. Vasculitis can occur, causing edema and potentially disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Myocarditis, pericarditis, meningitis, and uveitis are also possible sequelae. Ixodes scapularis Brucellosis in dogs is caused by Brucella canis. It is a sexually transmitted disease, but can also be spread through contact with aborted fetuses. The most common sign is abortion during the last trimester or stillbirth. Other symptoms include inflammation of the intervertebral disc and eye (uveitis), and inflammation of the testicle (orchitis) and prostate (prostatitis) in males. Tick-borne diseases are common in dogs. Lyme disease, or borreliosis, is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and spread by Ixodes pacificus on the West coast of the United States and by I. scapularis (deer tick) in the rest of the U.S. Signs and symptoms include fever, joint swelling and pain, lameness, and swelling of the lymph nodes. It has been diagnosed in dogs in all 48 states of the continental U.S. Ehrlichia canis, which causes canine ehrlichiosis, and Rickettsia rickettsii, which causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever, are both spread by the American dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis, and the brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineous. Fungal diseases One of the most common fungal diseases in dogs is ringworm, or dermatophytosis, an infection of the skin, hair, or nails. There are three fungal species that cause ringworm in dogs. About 70 percent of infections are caused by Microsporum canis, 20 percent by M. gypseum, and 10 percent by Trichophyton mentagrophytes. Signs include hair loss and scaling of the skin. Treatment for localized ringworm is not always necessary as the disease is self-limiting, but the clinical course can be shortened by using topical miconazole or clotrimazole. Generalized infections, most commonly seen in immunocompromised dogs, can be treated with oral antifungal drugs such as griseofulvin or itraconazole. Infection can spread to humans. Blastomyces dermatitidis There are several fungal diseases that are systemic in nature, meaning they are affecting multiple body systems. Blastomycosis, caused by Blastomyces dermatitidis, is a fungal disease that affects both dogs and humans. It is transmitted through the inhalation of fungal spores. It is found mainly in the United States in the Mississippi River and Great Lakes areas. It has also been reported in four Canadian provinces; Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec. Signs include weight loss, cough, fever, enlarged lymph nodes, draining skin lesions, eye inflammation with discharge, blindness, and lameness. Because dogs are ten times more likely to become infected from the environment than humans, they are considered to be sentinels for the disease. Treatment requires a minimum 60‚Äì90-day course of oral antifungal medication or in severe cases intravenous antifungal injections. Histoplasmosis, caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, is a disease with a worldwide distribution. In the United States it is mainly found in the Mississippi and Ohio River areas, most commonly in bird and bat feces. Signs include weight loss, cough, fever, enlarged lymph nodes, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Coccidioidomycosis, caused by Coccidioides immitis, is found in arid and semi-arid regions of Central and South America, Mexico, and southwestern United States. Signs include weight loss, fever, cough, enlarged lymph nodes, and lameness. Parasites Veterinary parasitology studies both external and internal parasites in animals. External parasites, such as fleas, mites, ticks and mosquitoes can cause skin irritation and are often carriers of other diseases or of internal parasites. =External parasites= *Fleas and ticks of various species can be acquired and brought home by a dog, where they can multiply and attack humans (and vice versa). These two parasites are particularly important to note, now that tick-borne Lyme disease has become endemic throughout a large area, in addition to other similar diseases such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Although dogs do not seem to be as susceptible to such diseases as humans, similar rickettsial diseases have been spread by dogs to humans through such mechanisms as a dog killing an infected rabbit, then shaking itself off in the house near enough to its owners to fatally infect most of the family. *Various mites cause skin problems such as mange. *Mosquitos *Lice infestations (pediculosis) cause intense pruritus, scratching, and hair loss. The two species of chewing lice that affect dogs are Trichodectes canis and Heterodoxus spiniger. The dog sucking louse is Linognathus setosus. =Internal parasites= Dirofilaria immitis heart worms in a dog's heart *Parasites, particularly intestinal worms such as hookworms, tapeworms and roundworms, can be transmitted in a dog's feces. Some tapeworms have fleas as intermediate hosts: the worm egg must be consumed by a flea to hatch, then the infected flea must be ingested (usually by the dog while grooming itself, but occasionally by a human through various means) for the adult worm to establish itself in the intestines. The worm's eggs then pass in the feces, and the cycle begins again. Intestinal worms cause varying degrees of discomfort. *Heartworm is a dog parasitoid. It is hard to eliminate and can be fatal; prevention, however, is easily achieved using medication. As the name suggests, an infected mosquito injects a larva into the dog's skin, where it migrates to the circulatory system and takes up residence in the pulmonary arteries and heart, growing and reproducing to an alarming degree. The effects on the dog are quite predictable: cardiac failure leading to death. Treatment of an infected dog is difficult, involving an attempt to poison the healthy worm with arsenic compounds without killing the weakened dog, and may not succeed. Prevention is recommended via the use of heartworm prophylactics, which contain a compound that kills the larvae immediately upon infection without harming the dog. Often they are combined with other parasite preventives. *Hydatidosis is caused by the cestode Echinococcus. It is observed in dogs, wild canids, foxes, etc. Due to its importance as a zoonosis, prevention and treatment is crucial. Preventing hydatidosis is an easier task than treatment. Anthelmintics such as praziquantel may help prevent this condition. Prohibition of the feeding of uncooked offals may be the best prophylactic measure against these tapeworms. =Genetic diseases= Bilateral hip dysplasia Genetic conditions are a problem in some dogs, particularly purebreeds. For this reason many of the national kennel clubs require that dogs with certain genetic illnesses or who are deemed to be carriers cannot be registered. Some of the most common conditions include hip dysplasia, seen in large breed dogs, von Willebrand disease, a disease that affects platelets that is inherited in Doberman Pinschers, entropion, a curling in of the eyelid seen in Shar Peis and many other breeds, progressive retinal atrophy, inherited in many breeds, deafness, and epilepsy, known to be inherited in Belgian Shepherd Dogs, German Shepherd Dogs, Cocker Spaniels, and St. Bernards. Subaortic stenosis, or SAS, is a genetic ailment that causes a narrowing of the passage of blood between the heart and the aorta. This leads to heart problems and sometimes sudden death. It affects larger breeds such as the Newfoundland dog and the Golden Retriever. In some dogs, such as collies, the blue merle or harlequin coloring is actually the heterozygote of a partially recessive gene preventing proper development of the nervous system; therefore, if two such dogs are mated, on the average one quarter of the puppies will have severe genetic defects in their nervous systems and sensory organs ranging from deafness to fatal flaws. =Skin diseases= Canine atopy Skin diseases are very common in dogs. Atopy, a chronic allergic condition, is thought to affect up to 10 percent of dogs. Other skin diseases related to allergies include hot spots and pyoderma, both characterized by secondary bacterial infections, food allergy, ear infections, and flea allergy dermatitis. Canine follicular dysplasia is an inherited disorder of the hair follicles resulting in alopecia (baldness). Mange is an infectious skin disease caused by mites. Endocrine diseases such as hypothyroidism and Cushing's syndrome can also manifest as skin problems like alopecia or recurring bacterial infections. Another class of integumentary malady is hygromas, a swelling typically on or near the elbow joint. Nutrition may also play a role in skin disease, as deficiencies in certain nutrients may result in scaling, redness, oiling, balding, and/or itching of the skin.(See dog skin disorders for specific nutrients that impacts skin) Physical elements of certain dog breeds also affect susceptibility of individuals to skin problems, such as wrinkled skin or excessive skin folds. For instance, skin-fold dermatitis is a skin infection more prevalent in breeds such as the bulldog, cocker spaniel, and English Springer spaniel. =Orthopedic diseases= Orthopedic diseases in dogs can be developmental, hereditary, traumatic, or degenerative. Because of the active nature of dogs, injuries happen frequently. One of the most common of these is an anterior cruciate ligament injury, a condition which often requires surgery. Bone fractures are a frequent occurrence in outdoor dogs due to trauma from being hit by cars. Degenerative joint disease is common in older dogs and is one of the most likely reasons for prescription of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Hereditary orthopedic diseases are mainly found in purebred dogs. Hip dysplasia is a common problem that primarily affects larger breeds. Hip dysplasia is a defect in the shape of the hip joint which can, depending on the degree of hip luxation, be quite painful to the dog as it ages. Over time it often causes arthritis in the hips. Dysplasia can also occur in the elbow joint. Luxating patellas can be a problem for smaller breeds. It can cause lameness and pain in the hind legs. Developmental orthopedic diseases include panosteitis and hypertrophic osteodystrophy. Panosteitis occurs in large and giant breed dogs usually between the age of five and fourteen months and manifests as fever, pain, and shifting leg lameness. Hypertrophic osteodystrophy is also seen in young large and giant breed dogs and is characterized by pain, lameness, fever, and swelling of the long bone metaphysis. =Tumors and cancer= Kangal with cancer in the left foreleg. A 10-year-old female beagle with oral cancer. Both benign and malignant tumors are seen in dogs. Common benign tumors include lipomas, non-viral papillomas, sebaceous gland adenoma, and perianal gland adenomas. Frequently seen cancers include lymphoma, melanoma, mast cell tumors (which are considered to be potentially malignant, even though they may have benign behavior), and osteosarcoma (bone cancer). Certain breeds are more likely to develop particular tumors, larger ones especially. The Golden Retriever is especially susceptible to lymphoma, with a lifetime risk of 1 in 8. Boxers and pugs are prone to multiple mast cell tumors. Scottish terriers have eighteen times the risk of mixed breed dogs to develop transitional cell carcinoma, a type of urinary bladder cancer. =Gastrointestinal diseases= Due to the indiscriminate nature of a dog's appetite, gastrointestinal upset is a frequent occurrence in dogs. The most common symptoms are anorexia, vomiting, and diarrhea. Foreign body ingestion can lead to acute obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract, a very dangerous condition. Acute pancreatitis can also result from dietary indiscretion. Bloat and gastric torsion Gastric dilatation volvulus, or gastric torsion and bloat, primarily affects breeds with deep, narrow chests, such as Great Danes, St. Bernards, German Shepherds, Standard Poodles and Irish Setters. The stomach twists on its supporting ligaments, sealing off the exits, and the contents begin to generate gas pressure which is very painful and rapidly causes shock and necrosis of large areas of stomach tissue. It can be fatal within a few hours. Dogs who have experienced bloat are very susceptible to recurrences. Treatment involves stabilization and abdominal surgery to tack the dog's stomach down to prevent recurrence (gastropexy). =Eye diseases= Cherry eye Eye diseases are common in dogs. Cataracts, canine glaucoma, and entropion are seen in dogs. Canine-specific eye diseases include progressive retinal atrophy, Collie eye anomaly, sudden acquired retinal degeneration, and cherry eye. Injury to the eye can result in corneal ulcers. The frequency of bilateral glaucoma with a genetic base in purebred dogs is higher than in any species except humans. Cataracts in dogs either have a genetic base or can also be caused by diabetes. Nuclear sclerosis resembles a cataract but is actually a normal age- related change. =Vestibular disease= Signs of vestibular disease include head tilt, circling, nystagmus (an abnormal movement of the eyes), and difficulty or inability to stand. These clinical signs are similar to those seen in humans experiencing vertigo. Vestibular disease may have many causes. Elderly dogs are susceptible to an idiopathic (meaning due to unknown causes) form of vestibular disease commonly called \\"old dog vestibular disease\\" or idiopathic peripheral vestibular disease. The signs may improve rapidly or take a few days. Less commonly, vestibular signs can also be caused by inner ear disease, a brain tumor, a stroke, or other causes. The major risk with idiopathic peripheral vestibular disease is that the dog is often unable to eat, drink, or go outside to urinate or defecate. These cases must receive supportive therapy of intravenous fluids and nutrition; a light sedative is sometimes administered, as the dog may be very stressed by the experience. =Heart disease= Older, small breeds of dogs are prone to congestive heart failure due to degeneration of the mitral valve. This condition is known to be inherited in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. Degenerative valve disease is the most common form of heart disease in dogs. Mitral regurgitation leads to turbulent blood flow and increased pressure in the left atrium. This causes increased pressure in the pulmonary blood vessels and pulmonary edema (a build-up of fluid in the lungs). Decreased output of blood by the left ventricle causes the body to compensate by increasing sympathetic tone and activating the renin‚Äìangiotensin‚Äìaldosterone system (RAAS). Increased sympathetic tone leads to increased peripheral vascular resistance and increased heart rate and contractility of the heart muscle. Chronic elevation of sympathetic tone damages the heart muscle. Activation of the RAAS results in increased retention of water and sodium by the kidneys, blood vessel constriction, and other effects that result in increased blood volume. It also results in an increase in diastolic pressure and leads to pulmonary edema. Treatment for congestive heart failure has historically focussed on two types of drugs that address these concerns: diuretics (especially furosemide), which decrease blood volume, and ACE inhibitors, which interrupt the RAAS. Recently, pimobendan ‚Äì which increases the force with which the heart muscle contracts, and is also a vasodilator ‚Äì is being more widely used in the treatment of congestive heart failure caused by valvular disease. A major veterinary study, called the QUEST study (QUality of life and Extension of Survival Time), published in September 2008 found that dogs with congestive heart failure receiving pimobendan plus furosemide had significantly better survival outcomes than those receiving benazepril (an ACE inhibitor) plus furosemide. However, ACE inhibitors and pimobendan have different mechanisms of action, and many veterinary cardiologists recommend they be used concurrently. Within the past decade, a new surgical technique has been developed for mitral valve repair that replaces or strengthens the mitral valve chords with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) prostheses and tightens the mitral valve ring to reduce or eliminate regurgitation. Cardiomyopathy, or disease of the heart muscle, is also seen in dogs and is associated with large breeds (the exception being Cocker Spaniels, a medium-sized breed). Dilated cardiomyopathy is seen in Great Danes, Irish Wolfhounds, St. Bernards, Dobermanns, Boxers, and other large breeds. Dobermanns, in addition to heart muscle failure, are prone to ventricular arrhythmias. Boxer dogs are predisposed to a unique cardiomyopathy with clinical and histological changes analogous to human arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). The disease has been termed \\"Boxer cardiomyopathy\\" or \\"Boxer ARVC\\", and is characterized by development of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Affected dogs are at risk of syncope and sudden cardiac death. Myocardial failure and congestive heart failure are rare manifestations of this disease. In 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a report citing a possible link between certain diets and canine dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in dog breeds without the genetic predisposition. Researchers at University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine announced the results of their own study in early 2019, confirming the connection and identifying a particular concentration found among Golden Retrievers. Diet-related DCM is associated with grain-free and/or legume-rich diets, as well as \\"boutique\\" dog foods containing exotic ingredients (such as bison or kangaroo meat). In the treatment of dietary DCM, food change and taurine supplementation is typically indicated, in addition to traditional medical treatments as needed. =Other diseases and psychological issues= Other diseases affecting dogs include endocrine diseases, immune-mediated diseases, and reproductive diseases. Diabetes mellitus, Cushing's syndrome, Addison's disease, and hypothyroidism are the most common endocrine diseases. Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia is a devastating disease that causes severe anemia in dogs through red blood cell destruction by the immune system. It has been associated with vaccinations and certain drugs, although many cases are idiopathic. A similar but less severe immune disease is immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, characterized by destruction of platelets by the immune system. Clinical signs include bruising and petechiae (pinpoint bruising, often seen in the mouth). Common reproductive diseases include pyometra (distension of the uterus with pus), mammary tumors, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Psychological anxieties affecting dogs include noise phobia and separation anxiety. Toxic substances Some common sources of toxins that pets encounter include some plants, human medications and cosmetics, cleaning products, and even some foods. =Dangerous foods= Dalmatian with liver spotted coat Some foods consumed safely by humans are harmful to dogs: Chocolate Cocoa within chocolate contains theobromine, a chemical stimulant that, together with caffeine and theophylline, belongs to the group of methylxanthine alkaloids. Dogs are unable to metabolize theobromine effectively. If they eat chocolate, the theobromine can remain in their bloodstreams for days, and dogs may experience fast heart rate, severe diarrhea, epileptic seizures, heart attacks, internal bleeding, and eventually death. One ounce (oz) of milk chocolate contains 44 - 55 milligrams (mg) of theobromine, and baker's chocolate contains 393 mg of theobromine.Gfeller, R. & Messonnier, S. Handbook of Small Animal Toxicology and Poisonings. 2nd ed. Mosby. The lethal dose for 50% of dogs (LD50) is 100 ‚Äì 200 mg per kilogram (kg) of body weight, yet some dogs will exhibit signs of toxicosis after ingesting as little as 20 mg per kg. In case of accidental intake of chocolate, especially involving a smaller dog, contact a veterinarian or animal poison control immediately; it is commonly recommended to induce vomiting within two hours of ingestion. Treatment protocol also includes intravenous fluid therapy and/or administration of activated charcoal. Large breeds are less susceptible to chocolate poisoning, but can still die after eating four ounces. Certain preparation methods of chocolate with other food items may increase the resultant theobromine levels. Such common prepared items include chocolate- coated accessory-fruits such as strawberries and combinations including caster sugars such as chocolate cookies. of chocolate. Carob treats are often available as dog treats; these are unrelated to chocolate and are safe. Grapes and raisins Grapes and raisins can cause acute kidney failure in dogs (see also grape and raisin toxicity in dogs). The exact mechanism is unknown, nor is there any means to determine the susceptibility of an individual dog. While as little as one raisin can be toxic to a susceptible dog, some other dogs have eaten as much as a pound of grapes or raisins at a time without ill effects. The affected dog usually vomits a few hours after consumption and begins showing signs of kidney failure three to five days later. A mycotoxin is suspected to be involved, but one has not been found in grapes or raisins ingested by affected dogs. The reason some dogs develop kidney failure following ingestion of grapes and raisins is not known. The most common pathological finding is proximal renal tubular necrosis. Onions Onions cause hemolytic anemia in dogs (and cats). Allyl propyl disulfide has been reported as being considered to be the main cause of onion poisoning in dogs. Thiosulfate has also been implicated. Thiosulfate levels are not affected by cooking or processing. Occasional exposure to small amounts is usually not a problem, but continuous exposure to even small amounts can be a serious threat. Also garlic contains thiosulfate, even if to a significantly lesser extent, and it is also known to cause diarrhea and vomiting. Other signs of toxicosis include pale gums and intravascular hemolysis. Nutmeg Nutmeg is highly neurotoxic to dogs and causes seizures, tremors, and nervous system disorders which can be fatal. Nutmeg's rich, spicy scent is attractive to dogs which can result in a dog ingesting a lethal amount of this spice. Eggnog and other food preparations which contain nutmeg should not be given to dogs., Toxic Food Guide for Pets, Nutmeg and Cinnamon Toxicity in Dogs, Can I Give My Dog Nutmeg Macadamia nuts Macadamia nuts can cause non-fatal stiffness, tremors, hyperthermia, and abdominal pain. The exact mechanism is not known. Most dogs recover with supportive care when the source of exposure is removed. Hops Hops, a plant used in making beer, can cause malignant hyperthermia in dogs, usually with fatal results. Certain breeds, such as Greyhounds, seem particularly sensitive to hop toxicity, but hops should be kept away from all dogs. Even small amounts of hops can trigger a potentially deadly reaction, even if the hops are \\"spent\\" after use in brewing. Yeast Ingestion of yeast, for example in uncooked bread dough, can cause intestinal obstruction. The yeast can also cause fermentation internally, resulting in ethanol (alcohol) poisoning. Xylitol Xylitol is a sugar substitute used in chewing gum, chewable vitamins, candy, toothpaste, and other products. Although a small preliminary study indicated xylitol may be safe for dogs, other studies show significant toxicity. There have been cases of foods, candies and gums containing xylitol causing toxic or even fatal liver damage in dogs. Ingestion may cause hypoglycemia. =Common household substances= Some common household chemicals are particularly dangerous to dogs: * Antifreeze (ethylene glycol), due to its sweet taste, poses an extreme danger of poisoning to dogs and cats if ingested. Even a very small amount such as a tablespoon can easily prove fatal. The antifreeze itself is not toxic, but is metabolized via the liver to the toxins glycolate and oxalate, which cause intoxication and vomiting, metabolic acidosis, and finally acute kidney failure leading to seizures and death. By the time clinical signs are observed, the kidneys are usually too damaged for the dog to survive, so acting quickly is important. Immediate treatments include inducing vomiting by using apomorphine or dilute hydrogen peroxide solution (if this can be done shortly after ingestion), but these merely reduce the amount absorbed ‚Äì immediate veterinary treatment is still usually imperative due to the high toxicity of the compound. Medical treatments may include fomepizole (preferred treatment) which competes favorably with the toxin in the body, ethanol which competes favorably in the liver long enough to allow excretion to take place, activated charcoal to further reduce uptake of undigested product, and hemodialysis to remove toxins from the blood. Dogs should not be allowed access to any place in which an antifreeze leak or spill has happened until the spill is completely cleaned out. Some brands of antifreeze contain propylene glycol instead of ethylene glycol and are marketed as being less harmful or less attractive to animals. : * Alcohols like isopropanol and methanol are found in household products and ethanol in alcoholic beverages. They all pose toxicity to dogs. Isopropanol found in rubbing alcohol has twice the toxicity of ethanol; however, methanol found in windshield washer fluid does not have the same retinal and neuronal toxicity on dogs as it does to humans and primates due to the differences in the way its metabolite formic acid is processed. * Mouse and rat poison is commonly found in the house or garage. Dogs readily eat these poisons. The poisons work by depleting stores of Vitamin K in the body; without these stores, blood cannot clot properly. Clinical signs of poisoning include depression, weakness, difficulty breathing, bruising, and bleeding from any part of the body. These clinical signs often take 3 to 4 days to appear. A blood test will confirm that the blood is not clotting properly. If the poison has only recently been ingested (within 2 to 3 hours), the dog should be given apomorphine or hydrogen peroxide to induce vomiting. Activated charcoal can be given to absorb any remaining poison in the gastrointestinal tract. Then the dog is given Vitamin K supplementation for 3 to 4 weeks, depending on the type of poison. At the end of treatment, the clotting times should be tested again. The prognosis is good in these cases. However, if the dog is already showing signs of poisoning, it is too late to try to remove the poison from the body. A whole blood transfusion or plasma is given to treat the anemia and to try to control bleeding. Vitamin K is also given. The prognosis is poor in these cases. Mouse and rat poisons containing cholecalciferol cause hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia in dogs. Clinical signs include depression, loss of appetite, vomiting blood, weakness, and shock. Treatment is as above for recent exposure. When hypercalcemia occurs (which can take 1 to 2 weeks), treatment is with intravenous fluids (saline), diuretics, corticosteroids, and calcitonin. Long term prognosis is good once the dog is stabilized. * Snail bait ingestion can cause anxiety, muscle twitching, seizures, rapid heart rate, dilated pupils, hypersalivation, vomiting, diarrhea, and high fever due to the metaldehyde present. Treatment involves gastric lavage, intravenous fluid administration, and/or administration of activated charcoal. =Over- the-counter medications= Poisoning with pain medications is common. Aspirin, paracetamol/acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil), and naproxen (Aleve) can all cause severe clinical signs in dogs, including vomiting blood, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Specifically, aspirin can cause metabolic acidosis and bleeding disorders, acetaminophen can cause liver disease at high doses (the toxic dose is 150 mg per kilogram of body weight), ibuprofen can cause kidney disease, and naproxen can cause ulcers in the stomach, which can perforate. Treatment depends on the clinical signs and often involves inducing vomiting, gastric lavage, intravenous fluid diuresis, and supportive care. The antidote for acetaminophen toxicity is N-acetylcysteine.  Public health risks  Sarcoptes scabiei Most diseases that affect dogs or humans are not transferable between the two species. Diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans are termed zoonoses. A well-known zoonosis is rabies, a viral infection transmitted through a bite. A common bacterial zoonosis is leptospirosis, transmitted through urine. Some of the most important zoonoses are parasitic. Zoonotic intestinal parasites transmitted through contact with feces include Toxocara canis (the canine roundworm), which causes toxocariasis, visceral larva migrans, and ocular larva migrans, and hookworms, which can cause cutaneous larva migrans. Zoonotic skin parasites include scabies, caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. The most common zoonotic fungal disease is ringworm, caused in this case by Microsporum canis. Preventive medicine =Vaccinations= Vaccinations are an important preventive animal health measure. The specific vaccinations recommended for dogs varies depending on geographic location, environment, travel history, and the activities the animal frequently engages in. In the United States, regardless of any of these factors, it is usually highly recommended that dogs be vaccinated against rabies, canine parvovirus, canine distemper, and infectious canine hepatitis (using canine adenovirus type 2 to avoid reaction). The decision on whether to vaccinate against other diseases, including leptospirosis, Lyme disease, Bordetella bronchiseptica, parainfluenza virus, and canine coronavirus, should be made between an owner and a veterinarian, taking into account factors specific to the dog. =Dentistry= Dental disease is one of the most common diseases in dogs. Accumulation of plaque and subsequently tartar leads to gingivitis and then periodontitis (gum disease). Periodontitis leads to loss of the bony attachment of the teeth and tooth loss. Preventive measures include tooth brushing, providing an appropriate diet (avoiding tinned and other soft foods and providing dental chew treats) and dental scaling and polishing. Cavities are uncommon in dogs. =Heartworm, flea or tick preventives= Once-a-month topical products and oral medications are the most commonly used products to kill and prevent heartworm infection and flea or tick infestations. Nutrition and obesity Human food such as ice cream can lead to ill health and obesity in dogs. Feeding table scraps to a dog is generally not recommended, at least in excess. Just as in humans, a dog's diet must consist of the appropriate mix of nutrients, carbohydrates, and proteins to give them the minerals and vitamins that they need. Dogs get ample correct nutrition from their natural, normal diet; wild and feral dogs can usually get all the nutrients needed from a diet of whole prey and raw meat. In addition, a human diet is not ideal for a dog: the concept of a \\"balanced\\" diet for a facultative carnivore like a dog is not the same as in an omnivorous human. Dogs will usually eat all the scraps and treats they are fed: usually too much food. While not all human delicacies are acutely toxic to dogs (see above), many have the same chronically unfortunate results as they do for humans. This Australian Cattle Dog's obesity is a sign of Cushing's Syndrome. Obesity is an increasingly common problem in dogs in Western countries. As with humans, obesity can cause numerous health problems in dogs (although dogs are much less susceptible to the common cardiac and arterial consequences of obesity than humans are). According to a study published in the Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine, the prevalence of obesity in dogs is between 22 and 40 percent.Humans Not the Only Creatures Suffering from Obesity Newswise. Retrieved November 3, 2008. Obesity may also be caused by some diseases, such as Cushing's disease or hypothyroidism. =Dog treats= Dog treats are often given to pets as a reward or just to let them chew on a bone, which works their jaw muscles and helps keep their teeth clean. Although dog treats carry high benefits for dogs' teeth, they can also be a source of problems like obesity when given excessively, especially human table scraps. The type of food given has a direct bearing on the tendency of a dog to become overweight. Table scraps, treats, and even premium high-energy dog foods can contribute to obesity. Therefore, it is highly important to closely monitor the quantity of treats that a dog gets especially when the dog's activity is diminished. Dog treats are more likely to be linked to obesity in old dogs, since in their old age they are less likely to be active and exercising. Active dogs require and use more calories. =Coprophagia= Some dogs may attempt to consume feces. Some consume their own or other dogs' feces; others seem to prefer cat feces (which, due to the feline digestive system, are high in protein and consumed by many animals in the wild.) This can be harmful if the feces has any pathogens or parasites or contain excreted drugs. Vitamins and supplements It is not yet clear whether or not vitamins and supplements should be administered in dogs‚Äîopinions among veterinarians vary widely. While some think that vitamins and supplements are necessary and can improve the health of a dog, others believe that they are unnecessary and may harm the dog. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), dogs receive a complete and balanced diet from the commercially processed dog food alone. Pet owners who give their dogs homemade diets may incorporate extra vitamins and supplements. Between approximately 10 and 30 percent of dogs in the United States receive nutritional supplements. A survey of U.S. pet owners in 2006 found that the most commonly used supplements were multivitamins and chondroprotective agents. Overdoses of vitamins can be harmful in dogs. As an example, calcium in excess can cause bone problems, especially in the large-breed dogs. Over-supplementation of vitamins A and D can cause vitamin toxicity in dogs.Food for Small Dogs Excess vitamin A can cause dehydration, joint pain and can also harm the blood vessels, while too much vitamin D can cause muscular atrophy, or loss of appetite. Reproductive health =Spaying and neutering= Spaying (females) and neutering (males) refers to the sterilization of animals, usually by removal of the male's testicles or the female's ovaries and uterus, to eliminate the ability to procreate and reduce sex drive. Neutering has also been known to reduce aggression in male dogs, but has been shown to occasionally increase aggression in female dogs. Animal control agencies in the United States and the ASPCA advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be spayed or neutered so that they do not have undesired puppies. Because of the overpopulation of dogs in some countries, puppies born to strays or as the result of accidental breedings often end up being killed in animal shelters. Spaying and neutering can also decrease the risk of hormone-driven diseases such as mammary cancer, as well as undesired hormone- driven behaviors. However, certain medical problems are more likely after surgery, such as urinary incontinence in females and prostate cancer in males. The hormonal changes involved with sterilization are likely to somewhat change the animal's personality, however, and some object to spaying and neutering as the sterilization could be carried out without the excision of organs. It is not essential for a female dog to either experience a heat cycle or have puppies before spaying, and likewise, a male dog does not need the experience of mating before neutering. Female cats and dogs are seven times more likely to develop mammary tumors if they are not spayed before their first heat cycle. The high dietary estrogen content of the average commercial pet food may be contributing factors in the development of mammary cancer, especially when these exogenous sources are added to those normal estrogens produced by the body. Dog food containing soybeans or soybean fractions have been found to contain phytoestrogens in levels that could have biological effects when ingested longterm.

Oil on canvas, 1854 Tulga or Tulca (living 642) was Visigothic King of Hispania, Septimania and Galicia from 640 to 642, if his father died in December 640, as some sources state. Other sources have his rule beginning as early as 639 or ending as early as 641. He came after his father Chintila in another vain attempt to establish dynastic kingship. In 642, Chindasuinth, a Gothic warlord, who may have been as old as 79, commenced a rebellion. He had command of the frontier with the Basques. He saw the crown's weakness and a convention of nobles (landholding Goths) and the people (other Gothic inhabitants) at Pampalica (probably modern Pampliega) proclaimed him king without the support of the church. According to Sigebert of Gembloux, the rebel deposed Tulga in Toledo and tonsured him, sending him to live out his days in a monastery, since monks were ineligible for the elective throne. However, Saint Ildephonsus of Toledo says that the rebellion failed without the church's support and Chindasuinth succeeded only on the death of Tulga.

He has portrayed Captain Frank Lapidus on the ABC series Lost and the title role of Deputy Marshal Winston MacBride on The Marshal. Early life and education Fahey was born in Olean, New York, the sixth of 13 siblings in an Irish American family. His mother, Jane, was a homemaker, and his father, Frank Fahey, worked at a clothing store. Fahey was raised in Buffalo, New York, from the age of ten and attended Father Baker's high school there. Fahey left home at the age of 17, subsequently hitchhiking to Alaska. He later backpacked through Europe, and worked on an Israeli kibbutz. Career Fahey started performing when he won a full scholarship to dance at the Joffrey Ballet School at the age of 25. He performed in theaters across the United States and on Broadway. He landed his first major role in television playing Gary Corelli on the soap opera One Life to Live. In 1985, he received his first major role in film, playing Tyree in Silverado. In 1986, he starred in Psycho III as Duane Duke, a money desperate guitarist. That same year, Fahey guest starred on the Season 3 premiere of Miami Vice as gun dealer Eddie Kaye, famously destroying Detective Sonny Crockett's Ferrari Daytona. In 1990, Fahey starred alongside Marisa Tomei in the TV movie Parker Kane, and alongside Clint Eastwood in the Eastwood-directed White Hunter Black Heart. In 1992, he starred alongside Pierce Brosnan in The Lawnmower Man. In 1995, Fahey was the lead in the Trimark Pictures adventure film Eye of the Wolf, directed by Arnaud S√©lignac, based on the book \\"KAZAN\\" by James Oliver Curwood. In 1995, he starred as \\"Winston McBride\\" on ABC's The Marshal. In 1999, he played the main character in Apocalypse II: Revelation. In 2007, he appeared in the Robert Rodriguez film Planet Terror and starred in Messages with Bruce Payne. Fahey appeared as daredevil Dutch the Clutch in an episode of Psych at the beginning of the third season of the show. Fahey played Frank Lapidus, the airplane and helicopter pilot of the research team sent to the island in Lost, as a recurring character in the fourth and fifth seasons, and as a regular character in the sixth season. In 2010, he had a major role in the Robert Rodriguez's action film Machete. In 2013, a new production of the classic play Twelve Angry Men took place at the Garrick Theatre in London, running until March 2014. Fahey played the part of the last juror in the story to change his vote to not guilty. Other notable actors appearing in this production were Martin Shaw who played the part of juror number 8 (a role made famous in the 1957 film by Henry Fonda), Robert Vaughn and Nick Moran. In 2015, Jeff Fahey starred in History Channel's mini-series Texas Rising as Tom Rusk, the Secretary of War for the new Republic of Texas who fought alongside General Sam Houston. In 2017, Jeff Fahey joined the UK tour of Bill Kenwright's production of Gore Vidal's \\"The Best Man\\" where he plays the part of US Presidential hopeful Joseph Cantwell against political rival William Russell, played by Martin Shaw. Humanitarian efforts In 2006 and 2007, Fahey spent time in Afghanistan assisting the newly established American University of Afghanistan, and launching a project to assist orphans in Kabul. Fahey's recent humanitarian work has revolved around the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, in which he has been focusing on the subject of warehousing, a practice in which the rights and mobility of refugees is restricted by a host country. Fahey's work specifically has addressed the subject of warehoused Sahrawi refugees in Algeria.

Retrieved 29 April 2019 was an Indian classical singer and, along with his cousin Abdul Wahid Khan, the founder of the Kirana gharana. Early life and background Abdul Karim Khan was born on 11 November 1872 in Kairana town in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh into a family with music tradition which traced its roots to musician brothers Ghulam Ali and Ghulam Maula. His father, Kale Khan, was the grandson of Ghulam Ali. Abdul Karim Khan received training from his uncle Abdullah Khan and father Kale Khan. He also received guidance from another uncle, Nanhe Khan. Abdul Karim Khan was musically influenced by Ustad Rahmat Khan of Gwalior gharana. Apart from vocals and sarangi, he also learned the veena (been), sitar and tabla. According to a story, he was initially a sarangi player, but decided to switch to vocals because of low status of sarangi players. In his early years, he used to sing with his brother Abdul Haq. They appeared before Murtaza Khan of the \\"Maula Bakhsh Khandan\\" to appear before the Maharaja (king) and were influenced by Murtaza's style. The king of Baroda State was impressed by this singing duo and made them the court musicians. This is where he met Tarabai Mane, who was the daughter of Sardar Maruti Rao Mane, a member of the royal family. When they decided to get married, they were ousted from Baroda. The couple settled in Bombay. In 1922, Tarabai Mane left Abdul Karim Khan, which apparently had a major impact on his music ‚Äì making it pensive and meditative. Karim Khan's first wife, Gafooran, was the sister of another Kirana master Abdul Wahid Khan, who was also his cousin. Career disciple Sawai Gandharva \\"One of the most melodious classical musicians we have had, Abdul Karim Khan's music always created a sublime atmosphere. The soothing quality of his specially cultivated voice, and his repose style of singing were such that the singer as well as his listeners forgot themselves in a sort of 'trance'.\\" Abdul Karim Khan was invited to the Mysore court where he met famous Carnatic music masters who also influenced his music. In particular the singing of his sargam was a direct influence of Carnatic practice. He became a frequent visitor to Mysore Palace which conferred on him the title Sangeet Ratna. On the way to Mysore he used to stay with his brother in Dharwad where he taught his most famous disciple Sawai Gandharva. In 1900, for eight months he taught Kesarbai Kerkar, who would go on to be one of the 20th century's most renowned vocalists. In 1913, he founded the Arya Sangeet Vidyalaya in Poona to teach music students.Profile of Abdul Karim Khan on calarts.edu website, Archived 13 May 2008. Retrieved 29 April 2019 He finally settled down in Miraj till his death in 1937 when returning from a concert tour of the South. Every year in August commemorative music concerts are held in Miraj in his honour. The innovations he brought to his vocal style distinguishes Kirana style from others. The slow melodic development of the raga in Vilambit laya (slow tempo) was the most characteristic aspect of his music. He worked hard to maintain his voice to be sweet and melodious which shaped his music. The thumri style he developed is also quite different from the 'Poorab ang' or 'Punjabi ang'. His thumri progresses in a leisurely slow pace with ample abandonment. He was also the first Hindustani musician to seriously study the Carnatic system and probably the first to be invited to sing all over the South.Profile of Ustad Abdul Karim Khan on weebly.com website.

Loyola also owned Channel 4 WWL-TV and AM powerhouse 870 WWL. WWL and WWL-FM had the same call sign but separate formats. The AM was a full service middle of the road station while WWL-FM played beautiful music. It featured quarter hour sweeps of instrumental cover versions of popular songs with Hollywood and Broadway show tunes. =Top 40 and Easy Listening= In the mid-1970s, station management decided to go in a radically different direction, seeking a younger demographic for WWL-FM. Out went the soft instrumental musicians such as Henry Mancini and Percy Faith, trading them in for Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney. WWL-FM flipped to a Top 40 sound. But this was an era where most young people still were listening to inexpensive AM radios for their favorite hits. The station failed to make much headway against AM Top 40 leader 690 WTIX (now WQNO). By May 1976, WWL-FM returned to easy listening music. The format featured mostly instrumental songs with several soft vocals each hour. On December 26, 1980, to separate the FM station's image from its AM and TV counterparts, the call letters were changed to WAJY. The station, calling itself \\"Joy 102,\\" moved closer to a 50/50 mix of instrumentals and vocals, some from soft rock artists such as Elton John, Olivia Newton-John, Stevie Wonder and Chicago. =Switch to WLMG= Through the 1980s, the easy format saw its audience continuing to age, while most advertisers seek young and middle-aged listeners. In 1987, the station completed its transition to a soft adult contemporary sound, eliminating the instrumental songs. The call sign was changed to WLMG using the moniker \\"Magic 102.\\" With most radios in the 1990s going from analog dials to digital, the station began calling itself \\"Magic 101.9\\" in 1995. Over the next decade, WWL and WLMG switched hands several times. In 1989, Loyola University sold the stations to Keymarket Communications.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1990 page B-138 The TV station was sold to a group of its employees, using the name Rampart Broadcasting. In July 1995, the radio stations were acquired by River City Communications.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1996 page B-182 Later ownership switched to Sinclair Broadcasting. And in December 1999, WWL and WLMG were acquired by Entercom.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2001 page D-197 In the early 2000s, WLMG moved to a mainstream adult contemporary sound. The tempo of the songs was picked up and the disc jockeys added more personality. The playlist extends from the 1980s to current day AC hits. In 2006, the WWL- FM call sign returned to New Orleans, on another station.

It was renamed the Louis Armstrong Stadium in 1973 but closed the following year. In the early 1970s, the United States Tennis Association was looking for a new place to host the US Open as relations with the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, which had hosted the tournament, were breaking down. The USTA was initially unable to find a sufficient site, but the association's incoming president, W.E. Hester saw the old Singer Bowl from the window of an airplane flying into LaGuardia Airport. The old, long rectangular stadium was heavily renovated and divided into two venues, becoming the square Louis Armstrong Stadium, with the remaining third becoming the attached Grandstand, with a seating capacity of about 6,000. In 1997, the stadium was replaced as the US Open's primary venue by the new Arthur Ashe Stadium. Armstrong Stadium was renovated again, with the top tiers of seating being removed. The stadium held close to 18,000 at its peak, but this was reduced to around 10,200 with the renovation, which also added a brick facade to match that of Ashe Stadium.

Mo»õa [or Motza] (5 July 1902, OrƒÉ»ôtie, Austria-Hungary--13 January 1937, Majadahonda, Spain) was the deputy leader of the Romanian fascist Iron Guard movement, killed in battle during the Spanish Civil War. Biography Son of the nationalist Orthodox priest Ioan Mo»õa, who edited a journal called Libertatea (\\"Liberty\\"), Ion I. Mo»õa studied law in Paris (1920-1921), Cluj, Ia»ôi and Grenoble. His thesis, finished in 1932 at the University of Grenoble, was entitled \\"Juridical Security in the Community of Nations\\", later published in Romania as \\"The League of Nations as a Vicious and Dangerous Ideal\\". At Cluj, he founded Ac»õiunea Rom√¢neascƒÉ (\\"Romanian Action\\"), a nationalist group inspired by Charles Maurras' Action Fran√ßaise. This organisation fused with A. C. Cuza's National-Christian Defense League in 1925. Mo»õa met Corneliu Zelea Codreanu at a meeting of antisemitic students in August 1923. The two formed a plan to assassinate Romanian politicians and leaders of Romanian Jewry seen as traitors and corruptors of Romanian national life. They were arrested in Bucharest on 8 October 1923 and sent to VƒÉcƒÉre»ôti prison. Acquitted in March 1924, Mo»õa shot Vernichescu, the member of their conspiracy who betrayed it to the authorities, seven times (but not fatally). He spent two months in Galata prison in Ia≈üi before being acquitted and released on 29 September 1924. Codreanu made Mo»õa leader of FrƒÉ»õia de Cruce (\\"Cross Brotherhood\\"), a fascist organisation of peasants and students who would \\"fight for nationalistic renewal\\" (founded on 6 May 1924). Mo»õa attended, together with A. C. Cuza, the September 1925 World Anti-Semitic Congress in Budapest; upon the founding of the Iron Guard (the Legion of the Archangel Michael) on 24 June 1927, he became deputy Captain to Codreanu. Ion Mo»õa represented the Legion at the 1934 Fascist International meeting in Montreux. He was vice-president of the Iron Guard political creation, the Everything for the Country Party. From 1934 through 1936, he served as a correspondent forWelt-Dienst / World-Service, an anti-Jewish publication founded by Ulrich Fleischhauer in Erfurt, Germany. Fleischhauer was a staunch believer in the veracity of the antisemitic propaganda pamphlet, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and appeared as an \\"expert witness\\" for the pro-Nazis at the famous Berne Trial. In late 1936, Mo»õa formed a Legionary unit to fight against the Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War. He and Vasile Marin (another prominent Legionary) were killed on the Madrid Front on the same day of fighting (13 January 1937). Their funerals in Bucharest (13 February 1937) were an immense and orderly procession (see Funerals of Ion Mo»õa and Vasile Marin), attended by the Ministers of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Francisco Franco's Spain, representatives of Portugal, Japan (at the time in the early Sh≈çwa period), and delegates of the Polish Patriotic Youth. On the commemoration of the deaths of Mo»õa and Marin on 13 January 1938, Codreanu created a special order in the ranks of the Legionary units: the Mo»õa-Marin Corps under the direction of Alexandru Cantacuzino. The members of this elite corps had Ready to Die as their slogan. A monument was erected at Majadahonda, on 13 September 1970, with support of Franco's government.

He led a jihad into the region of Fombina (in modern-day Cameroon and Nigeria), opening the region for Fulani colonisation. As a result of Adama's constant warring, the Fulani today make up the largest ethnic group in Northern Cameroon (at more than 60% of the region's entire population, which considering the fact that they weren't from the area, is a remarkable feat), and Islam is the dominant religion. The wars also forced many peoples south into the forest region. Adama studied in Hausaland and earned the title \\"Modibbo\\" (\\"Lettered One\\") for his scholarship. Upon finishing his studies, he returned home to Gurin and learned of the jihad declared by Fulani mystic Usman dan Fodio. When he accompanied a delegation to visit Usman, the leader ordered Adama to extend his jihad east as \\"Lamido Fombina\\" (Ruler of the Southlands). Adama raised an army and attacked Bata settlements near Gurin. He took the villages, and many more traditional Fulbe leaders and new soldiers came to his side. He next took on Mandara, the largest and best organised state in the region. He swept over several smaller settlements and eventually conquered the Mandara capital, Dulo, with ease. While his men celebrated, however, the Mandara army counterattacked and recaptured the town. Though he fought many more campaigns, Adama now spent most of his time in Yola, which became his capital. He set about creating the administrative structure of his new state, which he named Adamawa after himself. Adama ruled the empire, subordinate only to Usman dan Fodio in Sokoto. Below him lay the heads of major settlements, known as lamibe (singular: lamido). The village formed the smallest unit of government. Upon Adama's death in 1847, his son Muhammadu Lawal became Lamido of Adamawa. The empire was not to last, however, as colonial battles and division eventually destroyed the independent Fulani state. The conquest had long-term repercussions, however. The Fulani became the dominant ethnic group in the region, and Islam the major religion. The herdsmen altered the land to be more suitable for herding cattle, their primary pursuit. The jihad also pushed those peoples who had lived on the Adamawa Plateau south into the forest, the single most important event in the populating of Southern Cameroon. Early life Adama came from a respected but humble family; his father, Hassana, was a well regarded scholar of Islam and minor nobleman from Ba'ajo. Adama travelled to Bornu for his education, where he stayed for some time under the tutelage of Mallam Kiari. He continued his studies in Hausaland (modern Northern Nigeria), where legend says his teacher was the Fulani Shehu Usman dan Fodio in Degel. Adama proved a bright scholar and a pious Muslim, and he earned the title Modibo, \\"Lettered One\\". After several years away, he returned home to Guringa around 1804. There, the news was grim. Adama's father had died in 1803 fighting the Bata. Jihad Talk in Gurina also concerned events in Hausaland. Word had arrived that Usman dan Fodio had declared a militant jihad on the Hausa leaders. He had installed himself at Gudu and subsequently defeated non-Fulani leaders at Gobir and K√©bbi. Usman had now turned his attention to Bornu and to the vast southlands of Fumbina (modern-day Northern Cameroon). =Adama's mandate= Still, the picture seemed unclear to leaders farther from the fighting. Was Usman a Mujaddid (reformer), or was he the Mahdi, a saviour figure who would create an ideal Muslim society? In 1805 or 1806, the Fulani leaders at Guringa assembled a delegation to visit Usman and find out. Adama's pious reputation and familiarity with Hausaland made him a natural fit for the mission. The party met Usman in 1806, probably in Gwandu. There, they learned that his intention was to extend his jihad eastward, into Fumbina. The goal was ostensibly to convert various Kirdi (pagan) peoples to Islam and to protect Muslims who already lived in the area. The jihadists were also supposed to educate the region's current Muslim population, many of whom merged Islam with paganism. Though not the oldest member, Adama was one of the more zealous about Usman's ideas. Usman thus presented him with a command that would change his life dramatically. The Shehu gave Adama his blessing and presented him with a flag, the symbol of command in Usman's army. The Shehu then charged Adama to carry the jihad into Fumbina and from the Nile to the Bight of Biafra. Adama also received the power to distribute flags of command to others, thus establishing more centres of Fulani Islam and spreading the war to farther reaches. =Early campaigns= Adama immediately began recruiting Fulani and Hausa volunteers and mercenaries. These were mainly mounted cavalrymen fighting with sword, bow, and poisoned arrow. Adama forbade them to pillage or to kill indiscriminately, but enemy nations were given two choices: convert to Islam or become a tributary state. Those ethnic groups that lacked a centralised government had but one: become slaves to the Fulani and convert to their faith. The non-Fulani Muslims of the Adamawa largely rejected Adama's jihad; they viewed it as little more than an excuse to spread Fulani hegemony. However, it was primarily the Fulani leaders (ardo'en, singular: ardo) of Fumbina with whom Adama was concerned. Some of them rejected his primacy for various reasons: He was from a fairly humble background, he owned little wealth, his army was still small, and he lacked charisma. The majority, however, welcomed Adama as a military commander or religious leader at the very least. Adama's son-in-law, Jauro Dembo, had already settled in Fumbina at Malabu and became one of his lieutenants. The makeshift army made headquarters at Gurin, a fort at the junction of the Faro and Benue Rivers where Fulani warriors had regrouped after fighting the Bata in 1803. Adama then led his forces in a series of strikes on Bata settlements such as Pema, Tepa, and Turuwa. The victories elated Adama's men, who took numerous Bata slaves. The early successes convinced more local Fulani leaders to come to Adama's side. Even those ardo'en who opposed his political rule recognised the jihad as an opportunity to expand their territories. Njobdi of the Wollarbe clan is one notable example, and his major rival, Hammam Sambo, perhaps the first ardo to have settled in Fumbina, proved the major holdout. Bitter relations between Njobdi and Hammam would prove a major obstacle in Adama's quest to maintain a cohesive empire. In addition, common Fulani were inspired by Adama's exploits and formed into bands. Adama created a new position for their leaders: The lamido (plural: lamibe), who was the leader of a particular territory, as opposed to an ardo, leader of a particular people. Both groups received flags of command and shared the same status in Adama's armies. Before his death, Adama would appoint over 40 non-ardo lamibe. They would prove his most loyal lieutenants. =Mandara campaign= Adama turned his attentions on the only major state in Fumbina that could present a threat to his fledgling emirate: Mandara. It was an attractive target. It lay between Bornu to the north and Baghirmi in the Chad Basin, so its fall would facilitate the conquest of these areas. Its people were already Muslim, though they mixed the religion with pagan practices. Moreover, it had a large population from whom soldiers could be conscripted, and it was renowned for its excellent horses. Mandara was well organised, however, and would not be an easy prize. The people who lived there, the Mandarawa, had a long-standing rivalry with the Fulani, who had fought them under the Bornu in previous years. This animosity only served to drive more Fulani to Adama's armies, though, as many veterans were eager for another crack at an old rival. Furthermore, Fulbe rulers Modibo Damraka and others were already embroiled in fighting against the Mandara in the Diamar√© Plain. Sentiment for jihad was high. Adama reached Guringa in 1809 with a large army in good morale. He quickly conquered the Mandara settlement at Guider and headed north, taking several more villages along the way. Outside of the Mandara capital, Dulo, Adama demanded that the king, Bukar Djiama, swear his allegiance and convert to Islam untainted with paganism. Bukar agreed to acknowledged Adama's right to rule his own subjects, but he refused to yield his own sovereignty. Adama and his men took Dulo with little fighting. Adama searched for someone to rule the settlement, but he found no one whom he felt adequate for the post. Meanwhile, his troops revelled in their plunder. No one expected the Mandara counterattack, which was launched from nearby Mora. Adama fled the town, and Dulo fell from his grasp forever. Administration Adama and his men retreated to Yola (in present-day Nigeria). The town would become his capital by 1841. From here, he and his lieutenants continued to expand the emirate, which he named Adamawa after himself. The subordinates had to send him tribute in the form of cattle. Large settlements such as Maroua, Garoua, and Ngaound√©r√© fell to Adama or his lieutenants. By 1825, the Fulani had penetrated the Adamawa Plateau. Nevertheless, Adama lived in relatively moderate surroundings and never acquired great wealth. From Yola, Adama began the administrative tasks necessary for his nascent state. He did this with Usman's advice; he was to foster understanding between his people and their governors, facilitate communication between elders and their subordinates, and prevent the stratification of society based on class or wealth. The empire eventually took on three administrative tiers. At the centre was the emir al-Mu'minin (\\"commander of the faithful\\"), Adama himself, ruling from Yola and answering only to Usman dan Fodio in Sokoto. A contingent of councillors and administrators directly aided him, and a household staff of non-Fulbe and slaves doubled as his bodyguard. Below him were a number of district leaders, the lamibe, who ruled key settlements. Under them were a number of villages, each headed by a village chief. Meanwhile, some of the older ardo'en grew powerful through their own conquests. They regarded the unconquered areas near their territories as their own private backyards and defended these zones from all comers. This sometimes surfaced in their relations with Adama, such as when Bouba Njida of Rai refused to come to Adama's aid when the emir was fighting the Namchi at Poli. Instead, Bouba waited for Adama to retreat from the area to bring in his own forces and finish the enemy off. He then sent prisoners from the battle to Adama as a gift. Legacy Adama died in 1847 and was laid to rest at Yola (his tomb survives to this day). Adamawa covered 103,000 km¬≤ from Lake Chad to Banyo and was inhabited by 1,500,000 people. Further expansion to the south had proved difficult and undesirable since the presence of the tsetse fly and thick jungle made cattle rearing difficult there. Adama's son Muhammadu Lawal succeeded him after a brief regency under Hamidu bi Adama. Eventually, three of Adama's other sons would at some point serve as Emir of Adamawa. Not until the British and German colonial periods would the emirate come to an end. Despite their loss of independence, the Fulani were now the preeminent ethnic group of Northern Cameroon. They spread Islam throughout the region, establishing it as the dominant religion. Education also flourished, as new converts learned Arabic writing and studied the Qur'an. Trade flourished, and communications with it. The conquests were also important ecologically. Lands that had once been used for cultivation now became part of Fulani pastureland. Herdsmen cut down trees to make way for cattle, and they burned grasses that their herds later trampled. Centuries of such behaviour have replaced the region's forest with savanna. Ironically, the Adamawa was more sparsely populated after Adama's conquest. Rather than fight the Fulani invaders, many peoples fled, displacing others in turn. The Adamawa Plateau, once home to many of Cameroon's ethnic groups, soon became a pastureland, and the forest zone of Cameroon became more heavily populated.

Singing style The central concern of the Kirana style is swara, or individual notes, in particular precise tuning and expression of notes. In the Kirana Gayaki (singing style), the individual notes (swaras) of the raga are considered not just random points in the scale but independent realms of music capable of horizontal expansion. Highly emotional pukars in the higher octaves form a part of the musical experience. Another unique feature of this gharana is the highly intricate and ornate use of the sargam taan (weaving patterns with the notations themselves) introduced by Abdul Karim Khan under influence from the Carnatic classical style. In the late nineteenth century Abdul Karim Khan and Abdul Wahid Khan revolutionized the khayal gayaki by introducing the vilambit (a slow tempo section) to delineate the structure of the raga note by note. Frequently performed ragas by musicians of the gharana include Todi, Lalit, Multani, Patdeep, Puriya, Marwa, Shuddha Kalyan, Darbari Kanhara, and Komal- Rishabh Asavari. Noted Marathi thespian PuLa Deshpande has pointed out that performers from the Kirana gharana are particularly fond of the Komal Re/Rishabh (or minor second in the western system) note of the classical music scale, a frequent feature of these commonly performed ragas. History In the 19th-century the Kirana gharana coalesced around Miyan Bande Ali Khan, a player of the rudra veena. The gharana's style was further developed, and established as one of the prominent styles in modern Indian classical music in the late 19th / early 20th centuries by the musicians Abdul Karim Khan and Abdul Wahid Khan. Abdul Karim Khan was an extremely popular musician, and was thus highly influential in popularizing the gharana. Some trace the gharana's roots back farther to the 13th-century musician Gopal Nayak, a Hindu musician (of the dhrupad style) who later converted to Islamic Sufism and in the process assimilated the predominantly Muslim khyal musical style.Lavezzoli, p. 246 The name of this school of music derives from Kirana or Kairana, a town and tehsil of Shamli District in Uttar Pradesh. It is the birthplace of Abdul Karim Khan (1872‚Äì1937), who was one of the most important musicians of this gharana and of Hindustani music in general in the twentieth century. A frequent visitor to the Court of Mysore, Abdul Karim Khan was also influenced by Carnatic music, and roots of the tradition can also be traced back to his great-grandfather Ghulam Ali and Ghulam Maula, the brother of Ghulam Ali. Owing to the popularity of Abdul Karim Khan, most contemporary Hindustani musicians from Karnataka are exponents of Kirana gharana, and Kirana gharana in turn has absorbed many of the features of the Carnatic tradition. The culturally rich border region between Karnataka and Maharashtra is particularly well known for its association with the gharana. The other primary master of the gharana, in the early 20th century, was Abdul Karim Khan's cousin Abdul Wahid Khan who chose to settle at Lahore, Pakistan after the 1947 Partition of British India.

Graves James Robinson Graves (April 10, 1820 ‚Äì June 26, 1893) was an American Baptist preacher, publisher, evangelist, debater, author, and editor. He is most noted as the original founder of what is now the Southwestern family of companies. Graves was born in Chester, Vermont, the son of Z. C. Graves, and died in Memphis, Tennessee. His remains are interred in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis. Engraving illustrating the caning of J.R. Graves by an ex-congressman in front of Scovel's drug store in Nashville for alleged slander. In 1855, Graves established Southwestern Publishing House in Nashville, Tennessee. The company's name was chosen because, at that time, Nashville was in the southwestern part of the United States. Southwestern originally published The Tennessee Baptist, a Southern Baptist newspaper, and religious booklets which were sold by mail for 20¬¢ and 30¬¢ each. Prior to the Civil War, most Bibles were printed in the North, rather than the Confederacy. Graves acquired stereotype plates from the North and began printing Bibles for sale in August 1861. He also produced and sold educational books. After the 1864 Battle of Nashville resulted in a Union victory, Graves relocated to Memphis, as he felt vulnerable because of articles he had published against the North. The company resumed publishing in 1867.E. Michael Fleenor, \\"The Southwestern Company ,\\" Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009. Retrieved: 12 February 2013. In 1868, Graves discontinued the company‚Äôs mail order business, and began training young men as independent dealers to sell Bibles and educational books door-to-door as a way to earn money for college. Graves retired in 1871. Though raised in a Congregationalist family, Graves joined a Baptist church at age 15. Contemporary fellow ministers in the Southern Baptist Convention praised his preaching abilities. Thomas Treadwell Eaton wrote, \\"We have seen him hold a congregation packed uncomfortably, for three hours and a half without any sign of weariness on their part. This was not done once or twice, but scores of times.\\" Denominational leader James Bruton Gambrell described one of Graves' sermons at a small church in Mississippi as \\"The Greatest Sermon I Ever Heard.\\" Scholars have recognized Graves as an early and chief promulgator of the Landmark movement. The subject's Nashville publishing house, Graves, Marks, & Co, which later became South-Western Publishing, published all of fellow 'Landmarker' Amos Cooper Dayton's books. Both were expelled as 'schismatics' between 1858 and 1859 from the Nashville First Baptist Church due to their theological perspectives on their apostolic connection.Hensley, J.

The half-pass is a lateral movement seen in dressage, in which the horse moves forward and sideways at the same time. Unlike the easier leg-yield, the horse is bent in the direction of travel, slightly around the rider's inside leg. The outside hind and forelegs should cross over the inside legs, with the horse's body parallel to the arena wall and his forehand leading. The horse should remain forward, balanced, and bent, moving with cadence. The inside hind leg remains engaged throughout the half-pass, and the horse should not lose its rhythm. The half-pass is a variation of haunches-in (travers), executed on a diagonal line instead of along the wall. At higher levels it is used to perform a counter-change of hand, combining more than two half-passes with changes of direction in a zig-zag pattern.Rules for Dressage Events, article 409, p. 16 Vs. the leg-yield The half-pass Other examples of the half-pass requires more balance, engagement, and collection from a horse than the leg-yield. Example of leg-yield This is because the horse is slightly bent in the direction of movement in the half- pass. In the leg-yield, the horse is fairly straight or looking slightly away from the direction of travel.Rules for Dressage Events, article 412, pp. 19-20 Purpose The half-pass is a schooling movement that requires the horse to engage the hindquarters and increase its impulsion, it can therefore be used to improve both collection or impulsion. The half-pass is commonly seen in dressage tests beginning at the United States Dressage Federation third level. Performing the maneuver A common method of introducing the half-pass: riding a half 10-meter circle, and half-passing from the centerline back to the rail. In half-pass the horse is looking into the direction of travel, bent around the rider's inner leg, with the forelegs slightly leading and the outside legs crossing in front of the inside legs. The half-pass is usually taught after the haunches-in is well confirmed. It may first be introduced by riding a half-10-meter circle from the long side to the centerline, or a half- volte, and then half-passing in. The circle naturally places the horse's body in the correct bend, and helps to encourage the engagement needed for the movement. The outside hind leg must step well under the horse's body to push the animal forward and sideways. A rider uses an active outside leg slightly behind the neutral position to ask the horse to step forward and under. The outside rein maintains the correct bend and contains the energy of the horse, the inside leg keeps the horse moving forward, and the inside rein guides the forehand in the direction of movement. The rider also uses his or her inside seat bone to help maintain bend. If the rider is off-center or twisted, the horse will also be crooked or off-balance. If the horse loses quality in the movement, such as lack of correct bend (haunches leading or inside shoulder falling inward), loss of rhythm, or stiffness, the rider straightens the horse and rides forward. The beginning and the end of the movement needs special attention concerning control and balance.

He was a student of the \\"father of Angola\\", Mestre Pastinha, and has an academy in New York City. Early years Mestre Jo√£o Grande was born in the village of Itagi in the south of the Brazilian state of Bahia. As a child he worked alongside his family in the fields. At the age of 10 he saw \\"corta capim\\" for the first time. This is a movement performed by crouching down, extending one leg in front and swinging it around in a circle, hopping over it with the other leg. Fascinated, he asked what it was called and was told that it was \\"the Dance of the Nagos\\" ‚Äî a dance of the African descendants in the city of Salvador. The Yoruba of Southwest Nigeria had a major cultural influence in Salvador, which was considered the Black Rome of Brazil. But the dance was actually of Central African origin‚Äî it was Capoeira. Jo√£o didn't learn the correct name of the movement until many years later, but it changed his life forever. At the age of ten he left home in search of \\"the Dance of the Nagos\\". Meeting of Mestres Ten years later, he ended up in Brazil, the birthplace of capoeira as we know it, where he saw a proper capoeira roda for the first time. Present were mestres Menino Gordo, Jo√£o Pequeno, who was there with his first teacher, Mestre Barbosa, and Cobrinha Verde, one of the most skillful players of that era. Student of Pastinha Jo√£o Grande asked Mestre Barbosa if he could study and Mestre Barbosa sent him to Jo√£o Pequeno, who later became his closest associate in capoeira. Jo√£o Pequeno sent him to Mestre Pastinha who had a famous academy in the Cardeal Pequeno neighborhood of Brotas. Jo√£o Grande requested permission to join his academy, and Pastinha accepted Jo√£o as a student at the age of twenty, relatively late in capoeira life. While studying, Jo√£o Grande worked as a longshoreman, playing after work or on his few days off. Early fame Mestre Jo√£o Grande eventually became such an acclaimed capoeirista that when Caryb√©, a painter famous for his documentation of African Culture in Bahia, chose to do studies of capoeira he chose Jo√£o Grande as a model. Jo√£o Grande and Jo√£o Pequeno are featured in numerous films of capoeira including one in which they demonstrate the knife techniques of the art. In 1966 Jo√£o Grande travelled to Senegal with Mestre Pastinha to demonstrate capoeira at the first World Festival of Black Arts in Dakar. He was awarded his Diploma of capoeira from Pastinha in 1968 making him a full-fledged master of capoeira Angola. He subsequently toured Europe and the Middle East with Viva Bahia, a pioneering group that performed Afro-Brazilian folk arts such as capoeira, samba, maculel√™, candombl√© and puxada da rede. Demise of Mestre Pastinha Eventually Pastinha's academy fell on hard times. Pastinha, was asked by the government to vacate his building for renovations, but the space was never returned to him.

Return to Capoeira Jo√£o Grande returned when Mestre Moraes and Mestre Cobra Mansa persuaded him to come out of retirement in the mid-1980s. He began to teach with their organization Grupo Capoeira Angola Pelourinho. In 1989 he was invited by Jelon Vieira to tour the United States. The tour was a tremendous success. In 1990 he returned to present capoeira at the National Black Arts Festival in Atlanta, Georgia and at the Schomberg Center for Research for Black Culture in New York City. Jo√£o Grande decided he liked the US and has been teaching in New York City ever since. Present day In 1995 he received a Doctorate of Humane Letters from Upsala College, East Orange, New Jersey. In 2001 he was awarded the National Heritage Fellowship from the NEA, which is one of the most prestigious awards given to practitioners of traditional arts in the US. He has also recorded an audio CD and several DVDs featuring himself and his students, as well as other illustrious figures of capoeira Angola.

His designs span in size from the single-handed Laser dinghy to the 12-meter class Louis Vuitton Cup yacht, Canada One. He continues his design work in his American company, Bruce Kirby Marine. Biography Kirby was born in Ottawa. A Canadian newspaperman and former editor of Yacht Racing (predecessor to Sailing World), he designed the Laser in 1969. Kirby started as a reporter in Montreal before editing Yacht Racing and, in his spare time, taking up yacht design and drawing the Laser.In 1970 Kirby became editor of Yacht Racing, where he stayed until 1975. Kirby's career began with the International 14 class, a developmental skiff with relatively few rules. Kirby designed several International 14s, winning the world championships in 1958 and 1961. Kirby also represented Canada at the Olympic regattas in 1956 and 1964, sailing Finns, and in a Star in 1968. Since the 1970s Kirby has designed two America's Cup 12-Meters, Canada One and Canada II, the Apollo, Sonar, San Juan 24, Kirby 23, Kirby 25, and Kirby 30, Ideal 18, and the Pixel, a doublehanded trainer that has replaced the Blue Jay on Long Island Sound. Designed to the IOR rating, it was the basis for many of Kirby's later offshore designs. Kirby also served as both designer and skipper on Runaway, one of three yachts in Canada's 1981 Admiral's Cup campaign. Kirby also designed Norwalk Islands Sharpies, a line of high powered, shallow draft sailboats from 18 ft. to 41 ft. The designs use modern plywood, fiberglass and epoxy construction. The Sonar is the largest of three classes used in Paralympic sailing. Kirby was also part of the international committee elected to create the IACC boats (International America's Cup Class) used in the America's Cup between 1992 in San Diego and 2007 in Valencia, Spain. Awards and personal life On December 6, 2017 Kirby was invested into the Order of Canada for his contributions to the sport of sailing. In addition to representing Canada three times at the Olympics, Kirby's biggest contribution to the sport of sailing is the design of the popular Laser dinghy. The award was presented personally to Kirby by Julie Payette, Governor General of Canada, in September 2018 at a ceremony at Rideau Hall. He was in the first induction of the Lisgar Collegiate Institute Athletic Wall of Fame, as part of the 160th Anniversary celebrations.Alere Flammam, Lisgar Alumni Association Newsletter, Fall 2004 He is a member of the Noroton Yacht Club. Kirby was inducted into the National Sailing Hall of Fame in 2012.

The IOR evolved from the Cruising Club of America (CCA) rule for racer/cruisers and the Royal Ocean Racing Club (RORC) rule. Rule context - past and present rating systems The IOR was superseded (in the early 1990s) by the International Measurement System (IMS) and CHS (since renamed IRC). While some IOR yachts race at club level under IRC in more or less their original form, others had major surgery to make them competitive within the new rules.Seashore Magazine February 98 =Rule components= The IOR concentrated on hull shape with length, beam, freeboard and girth measurements, foretriangle, mast and boom measurements, and stability with an inclination test. Additionally, the IOR identified features which were dangerous, or it couldn't fairly rate, and penalized or prohibited them. The measurements and penalties were used to compute the handicap number, called an IOR rating, in feet. The higher the rating, the faster the boat was deemed to be able to sail. A typical IOR 40 footer (a one tonner) rated 30.55 feet. The IOR rule encouraged wide short boats with limited stability. A narrow waterline and large beam on deck, combined with a high centre of gravity, meant that crew weight provided a significant proportion of stability at small heel angles, and boats had a relatively low angle of vanishing stability. This developed into the situation about 1977 when the boats winning in most smaller IOR categories (up to the half tonners - about 10m LOA) had all internal ballast, often with an unballasted daggerboard. The managers of the rule realised that this was not a suitable direction for seaworthy yachts, and heavily penalised boats with lifting keels, but not before the 1979 Fastnet race ended in disaster. Writes John Rousmaniere: Apart from the girth measurements, all measurements were basically point measurements. This meant that the hull was often locally distorted to maximise or minimise a measurement locally, with minimal effect to the surrounding hull. This gave a characteristic bumped look to many boats, particularly at the point of maximum beam and in the stern. Also, as stability was only measured at very low heel angles (less than 5 degrees), boats were designed with a very narrow waterline and low stability in measurement trim, but a hull form that gained stability with the weight of the crew and other equipment, and with increasing angles of heel. Low stability was encouraged (up to a point) because the initial assumption was that low stability indicated a well fitted out interior, and so more of a cruising boat than a stripped out racer. Secondary design factors included engine and propeller rating factors, minimum internal accommodation levels, safety regulations, and a limit on the number of sails carried on board. Later on, crew limits were introduced, and limits on the use of exotic materials, such as carbon fibre and Nomex, and also scantlings for hull structural design developed by the American Bureau of Shipping. =Practical implications for sailors and owners= In a handicap race, the IOR length was used to compute a time allowance. In Europe this was calculated on the duration of the race, in seconds per hour, known as Time on Time, whereas in the USA they preferred to base it on the length of the race, as seconds per mile, known as Time on Distance. Time on Distance is easier to calculate at any point in the race, but can cause significant anomalies in tidal waters as the distance sailed through the water can differ significantly from the distance over the ground, due to the effect of the tide. The IOR rule was also used to define level rating classes, where each class had a maximum IOR rating, and the first boat to finish was the winner, with no handicapping. The first of these was the One Ton class, so named because there was a spare trophy from the defunct One Ton rating class, and this then spawned the Mini Ton, 1/4 Ton, 1/2 Ton, 3/4 Ton and Two Ton classes, as well as unofficial 50-footer, ULDB 70, and Maxi classes. The official classes each had an annual world championships. The IOR was run by the ITC, or International Technical Committee, of the Offshore Racing Congress, chaired between 1979 and 1987 by the late Gary Mull of San Francisco.ORC web site. Committees. Retrieved 20 November 2010 As with all published handicapping formulae, there was an ongoing game between the designers finding ways of designing boats that took advantage of shortcomings in the measurement system and handicapping formulae, and the rule makers closing the loopholes to ensure fair racing and a reasonable competitive life for the boats. As the racing became more competitive, the rate of change in the rule accelerated, and also the boats at the top of the fleet became stripped out racing machines that performed well but were expensive and also difficult to sail, and this resulted in a loss of popularity. However even if club sailors could not compete against the top boats, the IOR did generate a reasonably level playing field across the sailing spectrum, with club sailors buying production race boats or custom boats past their prime, and moving up to more competitive boats as they wanted to sail up the fleet. Towards the end of its life the IOR had become a stable rule, but by then it had a reputation of changing too often, and this sowed the seeds for its successors. IMS was introduced as a more scientific rule for racing yachts, driven by the USA, whereas Channel Handicap was introduced in 1983 by the RORC as a simple club level rule that would hopefully feed people into IOR racing - though in fact it proved to be the final nail in the coffin for the IOR rule. =Age, compensation and competitiveness= Boats had a short competitive life for two reasons: the overall increase in performance of newer boats due to better design and construction, and also the effect of changes in the handicapping rules. The first was catered for by an age allowance, which reduced the handicap of boats as they got older. The second was catered for to some extent by grandfather clauses in the IOR rules, but this did not cater for designer's ability to design to the rule increasing with every year. This, plus the annual rule changes, gave boats a competitive life of no more than 2 or 3 years at the top level. Initially designs were heavy displacement, with a fine, often V shaped stern as well as a fine bow. These were powerful boats for sailing to windward, but had limited performance offwind as well as often having an alarming tendency to broach - designers included Sparkman & Stephens and Dick Carter. Then Ron Holland's quarter- tonner Eygthene began the next phase of increasingly lightweight boats with fuller sterns giving more of a wedge shape, and a change from masthead rig to a fractional rig. This dinghy influence gave much faster performance reaching and downwind, and although windward performance was not as good, it improved as the designs developed. The ultimate in this stage was the various lightweight centerboard designs with internal ballast, but these were not sufficiently seaworthy for offshore racing and so were penalised so heavily that they were effectively banned. Designs then moved to a more moderate displacement, and as race courses moved from offshore racing with plenty of reaching towards windward/leeward round the cans, racing designs became narrower and less powerful but more easily driven. A good reference on the IOR Rule, including an analysis of the different formulae and measurements used, can be found in the book The Offshore Yacht. Development, simplification and revitalised racing Today, modern \\"maxis\\" are simply limited to 30m (98'), encouraging improvements in boat design, and exciting sailing, and not simply rule modification, as still plagues the America's Cup competition. The introduction of VPPs, or Velocity Prediction Programs, morphed the science of yacht performance measurement. Inherent to the IOR was the concept of a measurement officer taking discrete hull measurements and the IOR formula assumed the hull lines behaved continuously between measurement points. The IMS took the actual hull lines and analysed their continuum, essentially eliminating funny bumps or hollows in the ensuing yachts and generally rendering much cleaner, faster lines that were far more exciting, safer to sail, and had higher resale value.

Its southern segment begins at U.S. Highway 50 and Interstate 275 in east-central Dearborn County, just east of Lawrenceburg, and ends at Interstate 469 south of Fort Wayne. Its northern segment begins at Interstate 69 on Fort Wayne's north side, and ends at U.S. Route 20 in east- central Steuben County, approximately east of Angola. Route description =Southern section= US 224, January 2007 State Road 1 begins at an interchange of Interstate 275; this is I-275's only exit in Indiana. Just after the interchange there is a stop light at U.S. Route 50 (US 50). SR 1 travels north-northwest until it reaches I-74; just beyond I-74 it crosses Indiana State Road 46 (SR 46). SR 1 continues north until it meets U.S. Route 52 (US 52) just west of Cedar Grove. Then US 52 and SR 1 continue north- northeast for until they reach Brookville; here, US 52 turns west on its way to Indianapolis, while SR 1 continues north-northwest for where it meets Indiana State Road 44 (SR 44). SR 1 and SR 44 travel together for where SR 1 turns north-northeast towards downtown Connersville. North of Connersville, SR 1 travels north-northwest until it reaches Cambridge City, where SR 1 crosses U.S. Route 40 (US 40). After the intersection at US 40, SR 1 heads north- northeast. After SR 1 has an interchange with Interstate 70 (I-70), then heads due north towards U.S. Route 36 (US 36). SR 1 turns east onto US 36 for , then leaves US 36 and travels generally due north until it reaches Fort Wayne. Just south of Fort Wayne, SR 1 ends at an interchange with Interstate 469 (I-469). =Northern section= On the north side of Fort Wayne at the Dupont Road interchange of Interstate 69 (I-69), the northern section of SR 1 begins and heads east. The road heads away from I‚Äì69 as a six-lane divided highway, along the south edge of the Parkview Regional Medical Center complex, passing through numerous commercial properties. The highway narrows to a four-lane divided highway at Diebold Road and then enters an area of mixed commercial and residential properties. At Tonkel Road, SR 1 begins to curve northeast toward Leo and narrows to a two-lane highway. The route then leaves Fort Wayne, passing through rural farm land with scattered houses. Curving due north to enter Leo on Main Street, SR 1 then passes through residential areas of that town. North of downtown Leo the highway curves northeast and passes through a mix of commercial and residential properties. As the road enters DeKalb County it curves to run due north. The highway then enters Spencerville, passing through the center of town. After Spencerville, the road curves northeast, before again turning back north. The highway enters St. Joe and takes a sharp curve to head due east. The route crosses CSX Railroad tracks and makes another sharp curve heading due north. The road continues north until it meets SR 8\\\\. The two routes head east-southeast for a concurrency, until SR 1 departs the joint section heading due north. The road then passes through rural farmland, with a few houses, as a two-lane highway. Upon entering Butler it crosses the Norfolk Southern Railroad tracks, before encountering a signalized intersection with US 6 in downtown Butler. SR 1 then leaves Butler heading due north until it intersects DeKalb County Road 46, at which point the highway turns northwest. The route enter Hamilton and begins a concurrency with SR 427, heading northeast and passing Hamilton Lake. After , SR 1 leaves the concurrency heading due north. The highway then continues in that direction until reaching its northern terminus at US 20. History =Lawrenceburg= SR 1 began at US 50 and Main Street in Lawrenceburg and traveled north on Main Street until Main Street became Ridge Avenue. It then followed Ridge Avenue until it met the current SR 1\\\\. =Bluffton to Fort Wayne= Between the late 1940s and late 1950s, SR 1 had three or more lanes. This started in Bluffton and continued north to Fort Wayne. =Fort Wayne= Before being split into two sections on either side of Fort Wayne, SR 1 traveled on a continuous route through that city. From the present northern terminus of its southern section at Interstate 469's exit 6 in south-central Allen County, it continued north on Bluffton Road to pass just east of Fort Wayne's main airport (then known as Baer Field). In the Waynedale district of southwestern Fort Wayne, SR 3 joined Bluffton Road from the southwest at Lower Huntington Road. From there the routes originally continued together northward, hugging the bank of the St. Mary's River before curving east to bridge it. SR 1/SR 3 then immediately turned right (south) onto Broadway for about before turning east on Rudisill Boulevard. From there the routes continued to a one way pair of Clinton Street (southbound) and Lafayette Street (northbound), which then carried a concurrency of US 27 from Decatur and US 33 from St. Marys, Ohio. At Lima Road, SR 3 continues north, as US 27 and SR 1 got on I-69 northbound until exiting at Dupont Road. In later years, after the decommissioning of SR 3 through Fort Wayne and the completion of the Baer Field Thruway (later renamed Airport Expressway), SR 1 was rerouted to turn right onto that roadway, which deposited motorists onto Paulding Road at Fairfield Avenue. From there SR 1 headed east along Paulding Road to its intersection with US 27/US 33 (now Lafayette Street), where it turned left (north) and joined those routes to downtown Fort Wayne. North of Rudisill Boulevard, the original concurrency of US 27/US 33/SR 1/SR 3 (as well as the later concurrency of the first 3 routes) followed the Lafayette Street/Clinton Street pair to downtown Fort Wayne, where US 33 departed to the west. North of downtown, Lafayette Street became Spy Run Boulevard (still one-way northbound) until it terminated at the north end of the one-way pair with Clinton Street. From there the three (later two) combined routes continued north for a few blocks on Clinton Street to Northrup Street, where they curved northwest onto the latter roadway. Just south of Coliseum Boulevard SR 930 (then U.S. 30), Northrup Street becomes Lima Road, and continues north-northwest to I-69. At that point, SR 3 continued (later resumed) northbound on Lima Road to Kendallville, and US 27 and SR 1 both entered I-69 northbound, with SR 1 concurrent with the freeway until the Dupont Road interchange and US 27 concurrent with I-69 into Michigan. =Steuben County= At one point, the northern terminus was at SR 120 just west of the Ohio State Line.

In 2012 it consisted of 793 officers and 29 support staff.http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/Documents/investigation_commissioner_reports/territorial_support_group_report.pdf IPCC, 21 December 2012 Metropolitan Police Service Territorial Support Group: A review of complaints data and IPCC cases 2008-2012 It specialises in public order policing, amongst other specialist areas. The TSG is a uniformed unit of the MPS that replaced the similarly controversial Special Patrol Group in 1987. TSG units patrol the streets of London in marked police vans or \\"carriers\\"; using the call sign prefix \\"Uniform\\". Generally each carrier has an advanced (police) driver, seven constables and a sergeant. Territorial Support Groups often comprise three carriers, twenty one constables, and three sergeants reporting to an Inspector. They separately patrol designated areas experiencing serious levels of gang violence or disorder. When deployed, it is by the MPS Information Room. Due to the public order nature of their role often numerous carriers will be assigned. TSG officers can be identified as TSG from the distinctive \\"U\\" in their shoulder numbers. Role Today the TSG has three main tasks in the policing of the Metropolitan Police District: * Securing the capital against terrorism. * Responding to disorder anywhere within London. * Reducing priority crime through borough support. =Public order= Although public order is not the TSG's only role, it is certainly their most visible and well-known. Like most Police Support Unit vehicles, TSG vans are equipped with mesh window shields and officers are equipped with acrylic glass riot shields, visored 'NATO' helmets, shin and elbow guards, along with fireproof coveralls when required. This level of protection allows them to deal with many violent situations, including riots, football violence and suspects armed with a variety of weapons. TSG officers are trained to a higher standard of operational readiness in their public order role than most other Police Support Units outside London; TSG training is refreshed every five weeks as a matter of routine. Exercises are conducted predominantly at the MPS Specialist Training Centre in Gravesend, Kent, though other sites are used as required, and encompass all public order scenarios; officers will undergo extensive riot training including being petrol bombed in large-scale engagements, prison clearance tactics, football stadium scenarios, night club scenarios, aircraft, rail and various 'angry-man' scenarios, as well as additional specialist training. TSG units spend considerable time training with other specialist police teams as well as certain military units. Also, if a siege situation is present, but firearms are not involved, TSG will often be deployed to counter the threat. Reflecting this role the unit's former head, Commander Michael Johnson, was tactical commander for the London 2012 Olympics. =Borough support= TSG provides support to regular divisional officers through high-visibility patrols, surveillance and decoy operations while also providing a presence on the streets. Boroughs are also supported through the provision of a 'Commissioner's Reserve' a section of TSG that is on standby all year round; it is designed so such units are always available for rapid response of a sizeable number of officers anywhere within the Metropolis to quell public order problems, from a bar brawl to large-scale public disorder, such as innocent protestors. Day to day TSG assist the boroughs in handling and relocating particularly violent prisoners. =Terrorism response= Whilst the majority of TSG officers are unarmed, and therefore do not engage in the initial confrontation of terrorists, the TSG is equipped and trained to deal with the aftermath or evacuation during or after a terrorism emergency in London, and the unit includes a CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear) trained team. Working closely with SO15 (the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command) TSG also has counter- terrorism responsibilities. 200 TSG officers are now trained as firearms officers, and are available to be called upon in the event of a major attack. Recruitment Potential TSG candidates are selected from mainstream divisional officers. Officers are selected on merit and much emphasis is placed upon their personal policing ability, motivation, resilience and good communication skills. Fitness and stamina are also seen as essential attributes of TSG personnel. Applicants must be recommended by a senior officer (minimum rank of Inspector) whilst on division. Equipment TSG Public Order Vehicle (Carrier) Mercedes Sprinters are the standard vehicle of TSG and each van transports six Constables and a Sergeant. Three of these vans can form an operational Serial ready to respond to incidents; following the national PSU model this would include an Inspector, three Sergeants, eighteen Constables, two medics and three drivers. The TSG also maintains a fleet of armoured Ford F450 based Jankel Guardians for use in serious public order situations, like the 2011 England riots. These are identical to, and interchangeable with, the Guardians used by SCO18 Aviation Command and SCO19 Firearms Command, however do not carry armed officers in public order situations. TSG officers are not routinely armed, but are equipped with Speedcuffs, Monadnock fixed batons and CS/PAVA Incapacitant Spray like all officers. TSG does, however, have its own firearms capability with some officers being trained as Authorised Firearms Officers (AFOs) with firearms such as the Glock 17 and Heckler & Koch MP5 semi-automatic carbine, as well as less-lethal weaponry such as the L104A1 Baton Gun and X2 Taser. These officers may conduct certain infrequent armed patrols across London, typically in response to a threat of terrorism. Instead of TSG officers wearing standard black trousers and white shirt, when policing demonstrations they often wear fire-retardant overalls with their stab vests underneath. Criticism Officers in the TSG have faced criticism about their policing methods and complaints have been made against officers of the TSG. Senior officers say that the type of work that the TSG are involved with, policing protests and performing drug raids makes them more likely to have complaints made against them. As the result of a freedom of information request made by The Guardian newspaper, it was revealed that more than 5,000 complaints were made against the TSG in 4 years but only 9 have been upheld. Commenting on these figures, a member of the Metropolitan Police Authority stated that officers in the TSG are \\"practically immune\\" from criticism. One ex-Metropolitan Police officer suggested that TSG members, \\"spend (their) days waiting for action, and far too many officers join seeking excitement and physical confrontation.\\" Some officers are ex-military personnel and these are \\"the worst bullies\\" as \\"the laws of the battlefield are not appropriate to the streets of our capital\\".New Statesman: Stress, sexism and sacrifice of ideals In 1997 a man was beaten by officers from the TSG in what was described as an \\"outrageous display of brutality\\", which only stopped when the man pretended to be unconscious. The man was charged with assault and threatening behaviour over the incident but was cleared after photographs of his injuries showed the officers had lied about the case under oath. After the man's acquittal the officers went on trial accused of assault in 1999 but were later cleared. In 2003, six officers of the TSG performed what a judge in 2009 called a \\"serious, gratuitous and prolonged\\" assault on a terrorist suspect, Babar Ahmad, a 34-year-old IT support analyst who was not subsequently charged with any offence.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7950540.stm BBC News 18 March 2009 ¬£60,000 awarded to terror suspect The officers involved had already been the subject of as many as 60 complaints about unwarranted assaults against other men.https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/16/g20-tomlinson-ipcc- investigation-protest-police Specialist protest squads at centre of investigations into G20 police violence Sandra Laville The Guardian, Thursday 16 April 2009 A number of mail sacks containing these complaints were somehow lost.https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/mar/18/babar-ahmed-met-police Matthew Taylor and Rachel Williams Metropolitan police pays Muslim man ¬£60,000 damages over 'serious attack' The Guardian 18 March 2009 The accusations were investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commissionhttp://www.ipcc.gov.uk/news/pr101004_ahmed.htm 10 September 2004 IPCC - Complaint by Mr Babar Ahmed but that they were found to be unsubstantiated.

One officer, a former Royal Marine, accused in this case was also involved in the assault of Babar Ahmed and has had 31 complaints lodged against him since 1993. In November 2009 he was cleared of all offences, along with the other officers, and returned to work with the TSG. During the 2009 G-20 London summit protests two officers of the TSG were suspended from duty following publication of videos which recorded alleged assaults on members of the public at the 2009 G-20 London summit protests and at a subsequent memorial. In the first case, the member of the public, Ian Tomlinson, died shortly afterwards. In the second case, Sgt Delroy (Tony) Smellie was seen hitting Nicola Fisher. Following her complaint, the Crown Prosecution Service announced in September 2009, that there was sufficient evidence to charge Sgt Smellie with assault. He appeared in court on 16 November 2009 and was cleared of assault charges on 31 March 2010 at City of Westminster Magistrates' Court. However, he could still face misconduct proceedings over the incident.

Academic response The TSG and their predecessors, the SPG, have been likened to paramilitary units during riot control operations by Tony Jefferson in The Case against Paramilitary Policing (1990). He argues this because of their use of shields, batons and helmets, their centralised command structure, their willingness to use force and their squad-like formations. Peter Waddington counters this conclusion in the British Journal of Criminology by pointing out that their equipment is mainly defensive. As employees, the police force have a duty to protect them from harm, he also notes that paramedics in riot situations also wear similar helmets and armour. Jefferson argues that by the police preparing for an event, such as a march or protest where they expect there to be violence, they create a self-fulfilling prophecy and that violence will occur. Waddington responds to this by pointing out that the TSG were deployed at the Notting Hill Carnival every year and yet there was not always violence. Jefferson also believes that by controlling the ground the TSG incites violence, Waddington cites examples (including the Battle of the Beanfield) where problems were caused by the police not controlling the ground and that when they have then tried to gain control violence ensued. Waddington states that if the presence of the TSG caused violence, then violence would not occur if they were not deployed. Waddington uses examples from three Poll Tax Riots to illustrate that the assumption that their deployment causes violence is not correct. When the TSG were not deployed, serious disorder occurred, including a fully-fledged riot. In contrast when the TSG, including specialists in riot control, were deployed there was less violence. What is more he found that the more the police planned for the 'worst-case scenario' the less disorder there was. When they controlled the space and the crowd was at its greatest, violence was lowest. Waddington states that whilst the deployment of the TSG in a riot situation is never desirable, it is often essential to maintain order and limit violence. However, he also believes that the use of force should be as minimal as possible and that it should only be used to achieve publicly acceptable purposes.

Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS): How It Works, NASA. Retrieved 2 June 2019. The experiment is a recognized CERN experiment (RE1). The module is a detector that measures antimatter in cosmic rays; this information is needed to understand the formation of the Universe and search for evidence of dark matter. The principal investigator is Nobel laureate particle physicist Samuel Ting. The launch of flight STS-134 carrying AMS-02 took place on 16 May 2011, and the spectrometer was installed on 19 May 2011. By April 15, 2015, AMS-02 had recorded over 60 billion cosmic ray events and 90 billion after five years of operation since its installation in May 2011. In March 2013, Professor Ting reported initial results, saying that AMS had observed over 400,000 positrons, with the positron to electron fraction increasing from 10 GeV to 250 GeV. (Later results have shown a decrease in positron fraction at energies over about 275 GeV). There was \\"no significant variation over time, or any preferred incoming direction. These results are consistent with the positrons originating from the annihilation of dark matter particles in space, but not yet sufficiently conclusive to rule out other explanations.\\" The results have been published in Physical Review Letters. Additional data are still being collected. History The alpha magnetic spectrometer was proposed in 1995 by the Antimatter Study Group, led by MIT particle physicist Samuel Ting, not long after the cancellation of the Superconducting Super Collider. The original name for the instrument was Antimatter Spectrometer, with the stated objective to search for primordial antimatter, with a target resolution of antimatter/matter ‚âà10‚àí9. The proposal was accepted and Ting became the principal investigator. =AMS-01= An AMS prototype designated AMS-01, a simplified version of the detector, was built by the international consortium under Ting's direction and flown into space aboard the on STS-91 in June 1998. By not detecting any antihelium the AMS-01 established an upper limit of 1.1√ó10‚àí6 for the antihelium to helium flux ratio and proved that the detector concept worked in space. This shuttle mission was the last shuttle flight to the Mir Space Station. = AMS-02 = AMS-02 during integration and testing at CERN near Geneva. After the flight of the prototype, the group, now labelled the AMS Collaboration, began the development of a full research system designated AMS-02. This development effort involved the work of 500 scientists from 56 institutions and 16 countries organized under United States Department of Energy (DOE) sponsorship. The instrument which eventually resulted from a long evolutionary process has been called \\"the most sophisticated particle detector ever sent into space\\", rivaling very large detectors used at major particle accelerators, and has cost four times as much as any of its ground-based counterparts. Its goals have also evolved and been refined over time. As built it is a more comprehensive detector which has a better chance of discovering evidence of dark matter along other goals.Controversy Follows Pricey Space Station Experiment to Launch Pad, SCIENCE, VOL. 332, 22 APRIL 2011 The power requirements for AMS-02 were thought to be too great for a practical independent spacecraft. So AMS-02 was designed to be installed as an external module on the International Space Station and use power from the ISS. The post- plan was to deliver AMS-02 to the ISS by space shuttle in 2005 on station assembly mission UF4.1, but technical difficulties and shuttle scheduling issues added more delays. AMS-02 successfully completed final integration and operational testing at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland which included exposure to energetic proton beams generated by the CERN SPS particle accelerator. AMS-02 was then shipped by specialist haulier to ESA's European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC) facility in the Netherlands where it arrived 16 February 2010. Here it underwent thermal vacuum, electromagnetic compatibility and electromagnetic interference testing. AMS-02 was scheduled for delivery to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, United States. in late May 2010. This was however postponed to August 26, as AMS-02 underwent final alignment beam testing at CERN.Video on youtube of AMS being airlifted with C5 Galaxy from GVA airport on 26 August A cryogenic, superconducting magnet system was developed for the AMS-02. With Obama administration plans to extend International Space Station operations beyond 2015, the decision was made by AMS management to exchange the AMS-02 superconducting magnet for the non- superconducting magnet previously flown on AMS-01. Although the non- superconducting magnet has a weaker field strength, its on-orbit operational time at ISS is expected to be 10 to 18 years versus only three years for the superconducting version. In December 2018 it was announced that funding for the ISS had been extended to 2030.https://twitter.com/SenBillNelson/status/1075840067569139712 In 1999, after the successful flight of AMS-01, the total cost of the AMS program was estimated to be $33 million, with AMS-02 planned for flight to the ISS in 2003. After the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003, and after a number of technical difficulties with the construction of AMS-02, the cost of the program ballooned to an estimated $2 billion. =Installation on the International Space Station= AMS-02 installed on the ISS. For several years it was uncertain if AMS-02 would ever be launched because it was not manifested to fly on any of the remaining Space Shuttle flights. After the 2003 Columbia disaster NASA decided to reduce shuttle flights and retire the remaining shuttles by 2010. A number of flights were removed from the remaining manifest including the flight for AMS-02. In 2006 NASA studied alternative ways of delivering AMS-02 to the space station, but they all proved to be too expensive. In May 2008 a billbill was proposed to launch AMS-02 to ISS on an additional shuttle flight in 2010 or 2011. The bill was passed by the full House of Representatives on 11 June 2008. The bill then went before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee where it also passed. It was then amended and passed by the full Senate on 25 September 2008, and was passed again by the House on 27 September 2008. It was signed by President George W. Bush on 15 October 2008. The bill authorized NASA to add another space shuttle flight to the schedule before the space shuttle program was discontinued. In January 2009 NASA restored AMS-02 to the shuttle manifest. On 26 August 2010, AMS-02 was delivered from CERN to the Kennedy Space Center by a Lockheed C-5 Galaxy.CERN News ‚Äì Aug 28, 2010: AMS From CERN to Space! It was delivered to the International Space Station on May 19, 2011 as part of station assembly flight ULF6 on shuttle flight STS-134, commanded by Mark Kelly. It was removed from the shuttle cargo bay using the shuttle's robotic arm and handed off to the station's robotic arm for installation. AMS-02 is mounted on top of the Integrated Truss Structure, on USS-02, the zenith side of the S3-element of the truss. =Operations, condition and repairs= ESA astronaut Luca Parmitano, attached to the Canadarm2 robotic arm, carries the new thermal pump system for AMS By April 2017 only one of the 4 redundant coolant pumps for the silicon trackers was fully working, and repairs were being planned, despite AMS-02 not being designed to be serviced in space.Giant space magnet may have trapped antihelium, raising idea of lingering pools of antimatter in the cosmos By 2019, the last one was being operated intermittently.Repair equipment for particle physics experiment aboard next station cargo launch In November 2019, after four years of planning, special tools and equipment were sent to the ISS for in-situ repairs that may require four or five EVAs. Liquid carbon dioxide coolant was also replenished. The repairs were conducted by the ISS crew of Expedition 61. The spacewalkers were the expedition commander and ESA astronaut Luca Parmitano, and NASA astronaut Andrew Morgan. Both of them were assisted by NASA astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir who operated the Canadarm2 robotic arm from inside the Station. The spacewalks were described as the \\"most challenging since [the last] Hubble repairs\\".  First spacewalk  The first spacewalk was conducted on November 15, 2019. The spacewalk began with the removal of the debris shield covering AMS and it was jettisoned to burn up in the atmosphere. The next task was the installation of three handrails in the vicinity of AMS to prepare for the next spacewalks and removed zip ties on the AMS' vertical support strut. This was followed by the \\"get ahead\\" tasks: Luca Parmitano removed the screws from a carbon-fibre cover under the insulation and passed the cover to Andrew Morgan to jettison. The spacewalkers also removed the vertical support beam cover. The duration of the spacewalk was 6 hours and 39 minutes.  Second spacewalk  The second spacewalk was conducted on November 22, 2019. Parmitano and Morgan cut a total of eight stainless steel tubes, including one that vented the remaining carbon dioxide from the old cooling pump. The crew members also prepared a power cable and installed a mechanical attachment device in advance of installing the new cooling system. The duration of the spacewalk was 6 hours and 33 minutes.  Third spacewalk  The third spacewalk was conducted on December 2, 2019. The crew completed the primary task of installing the upgraded cooling system, called the upgraded tracker thermal pump system (UTTPS), completed the power and data cable connections for the system, and connected all eight cooling lines from the AMS to the new system. The intricate connection work required making a clean cut for each existing stainless steel tube connected to the AMS, then connecting it to the new system through swaging. The astronauts also completed an additional task to install an insulating blanket on the nadir side of the AMS to replace the heat shield and blanket they removed during the first spacewalk to begin the repair work. The flight control team on Earth initiated power-up of the system and confirmed its reception of power and data. The duration of the spacewalk was 6 hours and 2 minutes.  Fourth spacewalk  The final spacewalk was conducted on January 25, 2020. The astronauts conducted leak checks for the cooling system on the AMS and opened a valve to pressurize the system. Parmitano found a leak in one of the AMS's cooling lines. The leak was fixed during the spacewalk. Preliminary testing showed the AMS was responding as expected. Ground teams are working to fill the new AMS thermal control system with carbon dioxide, allow the system to stabilize, and power on the pumps to verify and optimize their performance. The tracker, one of several detectors on the AMS, began collecting science data again before the end of the week after the spacewalk. The astronauts also completed an additional task to remove degraded lens filters on two high- definition video cameras. The duration of the spacewalk was 6 hours and 16 minutes.

This data is filtered and compressed to about 300 kbit/s for download to the operation center POCC at CERN. Design The detector module consists of a series of detectors that are used to determine various characteristics of the radiation and particles as they pass through. Characteristics are determined only for particles that pass through from top to bottom. Particles that enter the detector at any other angles are rejected. From top to bottom the subsystems are identified as: *Transition radiation detector measures the velocities of the highest energy particles; *Upper time of flight counter, along with the lower time of flight counter, measures the velocities of lower energy particles; *Star tracker determines the orientation of the module in space; *Silicon tracker (9 disks among 6 locations) measures the coordinates of charged particles in the magnetic field; **Has 4 redundant coolant pumps *Permanent magnet bends the path of charged particles so they can be identified; *Anti-coincidence counter rejects stray particles that enter through the sides; *Ring imaging Cherenkov detector measures velocity of fast particles with extreme accuracy; *Electromagnetic calorimeter measures the total energy of the particles. Scientific goals The AMS-02 will use the unique environment of space to advance knowledge of the Universe and lead to the understanding of its origin by searching for antimatter, dark matter and measuring cosmic rays. =Antimatter= Experimental evidence indicates that our galaxy is made of matter; however, scientists believe there are about 100‚Äì200 billion galaxies in the observable Universe and some versions of the Big Bang theory of the origin of the Universe require equal amounts of matter and antimatter. Theories that explain this apparent asymmetry violate other measurements. Whether or not there is significant antimatter is one of the fundamental questions of the origin and nature of the Universe. Any observations of an antihelium nucleus would provide evidence for the existence of antimatter in space. In 1999, AMS-01 established a new upper limit of 10‚àí6 for the antihelium/helium flux ratio in the Universe. AMS-02 was designed to search with a sensitivity of 10‚àí9, an improvement of three orders of magnitude over AMS-01, sufficient to reach the edge of the expanding Universe and resolve the issue definitively. =Dark matter= The visible matter in the Universe, such as stars, adds up to less than 5 percent of the total mass that is known to exist from many other observations. The other 95 percent is dark, either dark matter, which is estimated at 20 percent of the Universe by weight, or dark energy, which makes up the balance. The exact nature of both still is unknown. One of the leading candidates for dark matter is the neutralino. If neutralinos exist, they should be colliding with each other and giving off an excess of charged particles that can be detected by AMS-02. Any peaks in the background positron, antiproton, or gamma ray flux could signal the presence of neutralinos or other dark matter candidates, but would need to be distinguished from poorly known confounding astrophysical signals. =Strangelets= Six types of quarks (up, down, strange, charm, bottom and top) have been found experimentally; however, the majority of matter on Earth is made up of only up and down quarks. It is a fundamental question whether there exists stable matter made up of strange quarks in combination with up and down quarks. Particles of such matter are known as strangelets. Strangelets might have extremely large mass and very small charge-to-mass ratios. It would be a totally new form of matter. AMS-02 may determine whether this extraordinary matter exists in our local environment. =Space radiation environment= Cosmic radiation during transit is a significant obstacle to sending humans to Mars. Accurate measurements of the cosmic ray environment are needed to plan appropriate countermeasures. Most cosmic ray studies are done by balloon-borne instruments with flight times that are measured in days; these studies have shown significant variations. AMS-02 is operative on the ISS, gathering a large amount of accurate data and allowing measurements of the long term variation of the cosmic ray flux over a wide energy range, for nuclei from protons to iron. In addition to the understanding the radiation protection required for astronauts during interplanetary flight, this data will allow the interstellar propagation and origins of cosmic rays to be identified. Results In July 2012, it was reported that AMS-02 had observed over 18 billion cosmic rays. In February 2013, Samuel Ting reported that in its first 18 months of operation AMS had recorded 25 billion particle events including nearly eight billion fast electrons and positrons. The AMS paper reported the positron-electron ratio in the mass range of 0.5 to 350 GeV, providing evidence about the weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) model of dark matter. On 30 March 2013, the first results from the AMS experiment were announced by the CERN press office. The first physics results were published in Physical Review Letters on 3 April 2013. A total of 6.8√ó106 positron and electron events were collected in the energy range from 0.5 to 350 GeV. The positron fraction (of the total electron plus positron events) steadily increased from energies of 10 to 250 GeV, but the slope decreased by an order of magnitude above 20 GeV, even though the fraction of positrons still increased. There was no fine structure in the positron fraction spectrum, and no anisotropies were observed. The accompanying Physics Viewpoint said that \\"The first results from the space-borne Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer confirm an unexplained excess of high-energy positrons in Earth- bound cosmic rays.\\" These results are consistent with the positrons originating from the annihilation of dark matter particles in space, but not yet sufficiently conclusive to rule out other explanations. Ting said \\"Over the coming months, AMS will be able to tell us conclusively whether these positrons are a signal for dark matter, or whether they have some other origin.\\" On September 18, 2014, new results with almost twice as much data were presented in a talk at CERN and published in Physical Review Letters. A new measurement of positron fraction up to 500 GeV was reported, showing that positron fraction peaks at a maximum of about 16% of total electron+positron events, around an energy of 275 ¬± 32 GeV. At higher energies, up to 500 GeV, the ratio of positrons to electrons begins to fall again. AMS presented for 3 days at CERN in April 2015, covering new data on 300 million proton events and helium flux. It revealed in December 2016 that it had discovered a few signals consistent with antihelium nuclei amidst several billion helium nuclei. The result remains to be verified, and the team is currently trying to rule out contamination. A study from 2019, using data from NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope discovered a halo around the nearby pulsar Geminga. The accelerated electrons and positrons collide with nearby starlight. The collision boosts the light up to much higher energies. Geminga alone could be responsible for as much as 20% of the high-energy positrons seen by the AMS-02 experiment.

The road heads north from this point, as a six‚Äìlane major arterial passing through both commercial and residential areas. North of Dupont Road, on the northside of Fort Wayne, the road becomes a rural four‚Äìlane divided highway. North of Fort Wayne, the route bypasses Huntertown, north of I-69. The road then enters Dekalb County, with a traffic light at SR 205\\\\. Very soon after SR 205, the road enters Noble County, bypassing LaOtto and Avilla. In Noble County, the route passes through rural farming land and parallels an abandoned railroad track on its way to Kendallville. In Kendallville the route has a short concurrency with US 6\\\\. After the US 6 concurrency SR 3, becomes a two‚Äìlane rural highway heading due North, until Mongo where the road turns northwest. Entering into Brighton, SR 3 reaches its northern terminus at SR 120.  History  Between 1972 and 1973, SR 3 was removed between US 224 in Markle and I-69 on the north side of Fort Wayne. The final route through the Fort Wayne metro area followed Indianapolis Road/Baer Road past the city's main airport (then known as Baer Field) to Lower Huntington Road in the Waynedale district of Fort Wayne. SR 3 there turned east onto that road for only a short distance, before turning north again onto Bluffton Road (SR 1). Bluffton Road hugs the bank of the St. Mary's River before curving east and crossing it. SR 1 and SR 3 then immediately turned south onto Broadway for two blocks before turning east onto Rudisill Boulevard. SR 1/SR 3 followed Rudisill Boulevard to Lafayette Street (US 27/US 33 northbound) and Clinton Street (US 27/US 33 southbound) at which points the state routes turned north to join the others heading to/from downtown Fort Wayne. In the heart of the city US 33 departed, then upon leaving downtown Lafayette Street becomes Spy Run Boulevard (still one way northbound) before joining Clinton Street on the north side of the city. Shortly thereafter, US 27/SR 1/SR 3 turned toward the northwest onto Northrop Street and Lima Road until they reached the I-69 interchange, where SR 3 continued north on Lima Road and US 27/SR 1 turned east onto northbound I‚Äì69. With SR 3 through traffic easily using the then- recently completed I-69 to bypass Fort Wayne, the route between US 224 and the junction with SR 1 on the southwest side was turned back over to local control and the SR 3 designation was removed along the portions shared with other routes within the city. Until 1980, SR 3 ran concurrently with SR 62 until it reached I-65 in Jeffersonville.Indiana Highway Ends Map of SR 3 in Jeffersonville In 1990, the four-lane upgrade from the DeKalb‚ÄìAllen County line north of Huntertown to Kendallville was completed, bypassing the towns of LaOtto and Avilla. This made SR 3 four lanes for the from I-69 in Fort Wayne to US 6 in Kendallville. In early 2010, construction began on SR 3 widening for about from Ludwig Road in Fort Wayne to Dupont Road on the north side of Fort Wayne. This section of highway along Lima Road was widened from four-lane divided roadway to six-lane divided highway and was completed in November 2011.

The western end of the western segment is in La Porte. The highway passes through rural areas of LaPorte and St. Joseph counties, before ending near Lakeville. The central segment starts at the eastern city limits of Goshen and heads east passing through rural Elkhart County, before ending at SR 13. The eastern segment runs between SR 327 and Interstate 69 (I-69), passing through the towns of Ashley. The state road runs through five counties in northern Indiana mostly through rural farm fields and small towns. Dating back to the early days of the state road system, SR 4 was first signed in the southern part of the state. It was moved to its modern routing in 1932, running from Goshen to SR 13. In the early to mid 1940s, SR 4 was added to the state road system between La Porte and Lakeville, while the eastern segment was added in the late 1940s, running from SR 327 to U.S. Highway 27 (US 27). The segment of roadway east of I-69 was removed from the state road system in the early 1970s. In the mid-2010s the western segment of roadway was extended east to meet the new alignment of US 31 and the western end of the central segment was moved from downtown Goshen to the eastern city limits. Route description =Western segment= The western segment is the longest of the three section of SR 4, at . The segment begins at the corner of Lincolnway (SR 2) and Monroe Street, in La Porte. It follows Monroe Street southeasterly passing through mostly residential area of the city. The road leaves the city and enters rural LaPorte County; in LaPorte County SR 4 crosses over a Chicago South Shore and South Bend Railroad track. After crossing the track the road parallels it to the southeast before a four-way stop with the northern end of SR 104 and county road 300 South. At this intersection SR 4 turns towards the northeast, while SR 104 continues towards the southeast. SR 4 quickly bends to become generally east‚Äìwest, before curving back towards the southeast. After becoming northwest-southeast SR 4 crosses over Canadian National Railroad track and through Fish Lake, between Lower Fish Lake and Upper Fish Lake. SR 4 passes over Kankakee River before curving to become north‚Äìsouth. Soon after becoming north‚Äìsouth, SR 4 bends to become east‚Äìwest and passes over another branch of the Kankakee River. The road enters North Liberty and is concurrent with Center Street, passing through an intersection with SR 23. East of North Liberty the road passes on the south side of Potato Creek State Park, while passing through farm fields and wooded areas. SR 4 passes on the north side of Lakeville having an intersection with SR 931. The road leaves Lakeville before having an interchange with US 31. SR 4 ends at this interchange but the roadway its self continues east as Pierce Road, a county road in St. Joseph County. =Central segment= The central segment begins as a continuation of Lincoln Avenue at the eastern city limits of the city of Goshen. The road heads northeast from Goshen while passing by farm and fields, in rural Elkhart County. The highway has an all-way stop with County Road 35 before bending to become east‚Äìwest. SR 4 ends at a three-way intersection with SR 13 with SR 13 heading north and east from this intersection. =Eastern segment= The eastern segment of SR 4 begins at a three-way intersection with SR 327, just south of Helmer. SR 4 heads east as the Dekalb‚ÄìSteuben county line, parallel to an Indiana Northeastern Railroad track, passing by agricultural land. The road enters the town of Ashley, concurrent with State Street, passing between industrial and residential properties, before entering downtown Ashley. East of downtown State Street, the highway passes by houses before an interchange with I-69. The SR 4 designation ends at this interchange, while the roadway continues east as a county road. History SR 4 prior to 1926 was designated between SR 5, now SR 550, and the Ohio state line, east of Lawrenceburg, generally routed along the modern corridor of US 50. Between 1926 and 1932 the SR 4 designation went unused. In 1932 SR 4 was designated between Goshen and SR 13 was designated. Between 1939 and 1941 SR 727 was commissioned, between SR 327 and Ashley, along the modern SR 4. The western segment was added to the state road system between 1942 and 1945, between LaPorte and Lakeville. The eastern segment of SR 4 was added either in 1949 or 1950, routed between SR 727, in Ashley, and US 27. SR 4 was extended west to SR 327 from Ashley replacing SR 727. The eastern terminus of SR 4 was moved west to I-69 from US 27 between 1970 and 1971. During 2014 the western segment of SR 4 was extended east to an interchange at the new route of US 31. SR 4 was extended to the US 31 freeway in conjunction with that facility opening in 2014. The segment of SR 4 from US 33/SR 15 to the eastern city limits of Goshen was removed form the state road system between 2015 and 2016.

At this time modern SR 7 route was part of SR 26. In 1926 the modern route of SR 7 was planned to become part of SR 11 designation. Later in 1926 the SR 11 designation became SR 7, routed from Madison to Columbus. Between 1931 and 1932 the entire route of SR 7 became a hard driving surface. US 31 was rerouted onto SR 7 northwest of the modern intersection between the two roads between 1939 and 1941. By 1942 US 31 was rerouted onto its modern route towards Columbus. The northern end of SR 7 was moved to its current location, at SR 46, in either 1999 or 2000.

It is the first episode of a two-part story; the concluding episode, \\"Doomsday\\", was first broadcast on 8 July. The episode is set in London, some time after the events of the 2006 episode \\"Love & Monsters\\". In the episode, the Cybermen come to Earth from a parallel world by following a spherical ship through an interdimensional breach. The Torchwood Institute intends to open this breach further for use as an energy source. Plot A vaguely humanoid and luminous silhouette, which Jackie insists is the ghost of her deceased father, appears in Jackie's flat, surprising both the Tenth Doctor and Rose but delighting Jackie before disappearing. Jackie explains that a few months previously, millions of ghosts began appearing all over the world. Humans have come to accept them and believe that they are the manifestations of loved ones. Conducting an experiment, the Doctor determines that the ghosts are in fact impressions of something forcing its way into this universe. The Doctor tracks the signal back and uses the TARDIS to travel there with Rose and Jackie, arriving at the Torchwood Institute in Canary Wharf. The Doctor and Jackie are taken by soldiers to see Torchwood's director Yvonne Hartman, while the TARDIS is impounded with Rose inside. Yvonne shows the Doctor the invisible breach which is the source of the ghost energy, along with a ship which came through the breach: a \\"Void ship\\", designed to exist in the space between universes known as the Void. Torchwood built One Canada Square around the breach and conducted experiments on it, forcing it open in an attempt to harness it as a source of energy. Yvonne also reveals to the Doctor that his encounter with Queen Victoria made him an enemy of the state and was the catalyst for the creation of Torchwood. Meanwhile, Rose, masquerading as a Torchwood employee, slips out of the TARDIS, and gains access to the sphere chamber, where she finds Mickey, also disguised as Torchwood staff. An advance guard of Cybermen subvert and manipulate three employees into initiating an unscheduled ghost shift to forcibly open the breach, causing millions of ghosts to appear across the globe before they materialise into their true form, the Cybermen. At the same time the Cybermen arrive, the sphere suddenly activates and begins to open. The Cybermen are similarly oblivious to the origins of the sphere; they simply followed its course through the breach. In the sphere chamber, Mickey explains to Rose that after a battle in the parallel universe the Cybermen mysteriously disappeared. He happened upon their means of escape and returned to his native universe with the intention of stopping them. Mickey believes that the Cybermen are in control of the sphere and produces a gun to destroy whatever is in it. Rose is horrified when the sphere opens and reveals its occupants to be four Daleks. =Continuity= The majority of this episode takes place in the Torchwood Institute, which is seen on screen for the first time. The phrase \\"Torchwood\\" originated from an anagram of Doctor Who used to conceal the \\"rushes\\" tapes during the filming of the first series. It was an arc word used through the majority of the second series, starting with the series one episode \\"Bad Wolf\\". The episode's secondary plot device is the Cybermen, from the parallel universe featured in \\"The Age of Steel\\" and \\"Rise of the Cybermen\\". The Cybermen breaking through plastic sheets is a recurring theme throughout Cybermen appearances, in particular, The Tomb of the Cybermen (1967), The Invasion (1968) and Earthshock (1982). The concept of a CyberKing, mentioned by Mickey, would eventually come to pass in \\"The Next Doctor\\" (2008). The episode is also the first in which Freema Agyeman appears, although she is not playing the role of Martha Jones, which she would play in series 3, but a minor character named Adeola (who is later revealed to be Martha's cousin). Russell T Davies admired Agyeman's performance as Adeola and called her back to fill the role of companion that Piper had chosen to leave. Although Cybermen and Daleks previously appeared together in The Wheel in Space (1968), The War Games (1969), The Mind of Evil (1971), Logopolis (1981), The Five Doctors (1983), and \\"Dalek\\" (2005), this two-part episode (including the next episode \\"Doomsday\\") is the first time that both the Cybermen and Daleks play a major role. Production One Canada Square became Torchwood Tower. The two-part finale comprising \\"Army of Ghosts\\" and \\"Doomsday\\" was originally going to take place in Cardiff on the time rift which was the focus of the episodes \\"The Unquiet Dead\\" and \\"Boom Town\\". With the commission of the Torchwood series in 2005, Davies decided to base the spin-off in Cardiff and relocate \\"Army of Ghosts\\" and \\"Doomsday\\" to Canary Wharf in London. To ensure that Noel Clarke and Shaun Dingwall (Mickey Smith and Pete Tyler, respectively) were available for filming, the story was filmed in the season's third production block along with \\"Rise of the Cybermen\\" and \\"The Age of Steel\\". Filming for the story started on 2 November 2005 on location in Kennington, but this story did not become the primary focus of the production crew until 29 November, when filming began on the scenes in and around the sphere chamber. Scenes in the lever room, the main setting for the story, were filmed between 12 December and 15 December, and 3 January and 5 January 2006. The episode also features references to other programmes by the BBC. The most notable of these is the cameo of Barbara Windsor as Peggy Mitchell in EastEnders, where she bars a ghost, who she presumes to be Den Watts, from The Queen Victoria. Watts, presumed killed in 1989, had returned to the soap in 2003, before being killed a second time in 2005 after being written out of the show. Other British TV personalities appearing in the episode are Trisha Goddard, Alistair Appleton and Derek Acorah, appearing as themselves. Additionally, the shot of One Canada Square is taken from the opening credits of The Apprentice. A programme with the same name as a controversial broadcast in 1992 by the BBC, Ghostwatch, also appears in the show. Location shooting took place at the Coal Exchange and Mount Stuart Square, Cardiff Bay. Broadcast and reception To keep the appearance of the Daleks secret, the final scene was removed from all preview tapes and replaced with a title card reading \\"final scene withheld until transmission\\", including the copy given to the Doctor Who microsite's \\"fear forecast\\" team. The episode was watched by 8.19 million viewers, and was the seventh most watched programme of the week, behind four World Cup games and two episodes of Coronation Street. The Companion episode of Doctor Who Confidential gained 570,000 viewers. The episode's Appreciation Index was 86, above the average baseline of 77 for drama series. The episode was generally well reviewed by critics. The Stage commented that the episode was \\"a tense contest, full of drama, tears, adversity and two powerful forces coming face to face in the ultimate battle\\" while mockingly downplaying the England football team's defeat earlier that evening. The author of the review then stated that the cliffhanger increased his affection of the show. The Guardian commented that the episode was \\"Who back at its best\\" while The People complimented the humour of the scene of the Doctor channel surfing. Jacob Clifton of Television Without Pity gave the episode an A- rating. Ahsan Haque of IGN gave the episode 9.8 out of 10 (Incredible), and complimented the pacing of the episode and the revelation of both the Cybermen and the Daleks, concluding that \\"you couldn't ask for a better cliffhanger\\". After its initial airing, the episode was released on DVD with \\"Fear Her\\" and \\"Doomsday\\" on 25 September 2006. The story (\\"Army of Ghosts\\"/\\"Doomsday\\") was nominated for the 2007 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form.

The club are members of the , and as from season 2016‚Äì17 play their home matches at Ruskin Drive Sports Ground. History St Helens Town was formed in 1901 and played at Park Road, behind the Primrose Vaults public house. Although it was known as the Primrose Ground, the players changed further down Park Road at the Black Horse pub. Playing in the Lancashire League and Lancashire Combination, the team enjoyed some early success, but struggled after the Great War and appears to have folded midway through the 1928‚Äì29 season. The club was re-formed by George Fryer and a group of local businessmen in 1946. They took out a lease of the former cricket ground at Hoghton Road, Sutton, adjacent to the St Helens Junction railway station and, although the club entered the FA Cup in the 1946‚Äì47 season, a team could not be raised in time to fulfill the tie with Prescot Cables. Friendly games were played, then local team Derbyshire Hill Rovers were taken over in April 1947, those players forming the nucleus of the team which entered the Liverpool County Combination at the start of the 1947‚Äì48 season. St Helens Town soon began to prosper and early results included a sensational 1‚Äì-4 win over Everton \\"A\\" on 6 December 1947. Former German prisoner-of-war Bert Trautmann joined the club in the summer of 1948, the strapping goalkeeper helping the team to win its first trophy, the George Mahon Cup, which was secured with a 2‚Äì1 win over Runcorn at Prescot on 7 May 1949. Crowds averaged over 2,000 that season, peaking with a league record attendance of 3,102 against Burscough in October 1948. The following season, 1949‚Äì50, Town entered the Lancashire Combination and, despite losing Trautmann to Manchester City in October 1949, they won the Second Division title in some style the following season with three players all netting over 30 goals apiece: Albert Leadbitter (36), Harry McCann (32) and Terry Garner (31). An all-time club record attendance \\"between 8,000 and 9,000\\" witnessed a friendly game against Manchester City which was arranged as part of the Trautmann transfer deal in April 1950. Another 4,000 spectators then witnessed a second game contested by the two teams the season after. Although relegated by a slender margin from the First Division in 1951‚Äì52, the club continued to look forward, even contemplating Football League status and, in order to further their ambitions, the club moved to the former St Helens Recreation ground at City Road. Initial crowds were encouraging at their new home, but, despite success, Town decided to move back to Hoghton Road in October 1953, where they remained until April 2000. Following a second relegation in 1956, St Helens Town continued to play in the Lancashire Combination, winning the Championship in 1971‚Äì72, by nine points ahead of Accrington Stanley. However, the formation of the Northern Premier League in 1968 led to a gradual drain of stronger clubs from the Combination and St Helens joined the Cheshire League in 1975. Seven years later, Town eventually became founder members of the North West Counties League, and competed in the Premier Division's inaugural season in 1982‚Äì83. They held the proud record of being the only club to play in the North West Counties top flight in every season until they were relegated in April 2015 in dramatic fashion, conceding an injury time equalizer to Silsden in the final game of the season, in which if they won, they would have stayed up. Town enjoyed a golden era in the late 1980s, just missing out on an appearance in the First Round Proper of the FA Cup in 1985‚Äì86, losing to Morecambe in a Fourth Qualifying Round Replay. But they obtained ample compensation by winning the FA Vase in 1987, beating near neighbours Warrington Town in the Final 3‚Äì2 with a Phil Layhe brace and a goal from Brian Rigby. They were regular promotion candidates for many years, largely due to the goalscoring exploits of Steve \\"Pellet\\" Pennington, who grabbed 216 goals, his season's best hauls of 45 in 1993‚Äì94 and 46 in 1997‚Äì98 just fell short of the club record of 47 scored by Phil Stainton in 1963‚Äì64. Soon enough, the facilities at Hoghton Road had fallen into disrepair and the site was sold for housing in 2002. Town, having gone into partnership with St Helens R.F.C., ground shared Knowsley Road for 10 years, but the intended relocation to the new Langtree Park ground did not materialise. During this period the club had to overcome many financial issues in order to exist, and several managers came and went including Joe Palladino, Paul Lodge, Joe Gillibru, Alex Wright and John Fletcher. The club then embarked on a nomadic existence, first at Ashton Town, then at their neighbours Ashton Athletic. Construction work at the Council-owned multi- sports facility at Ruskin Drive had been delayed, but was ultimately completed at the beginning of the 2017‚Äì18 season. However, due to problems, home matches during season 2016‚Äì17 were played mostly at the ground of Prescot Cables, with the remainder at Ashton Town's ground. Lee Jenkinson took charge at the beginning of the 2017/18 season and was replaced by David Platt Jr in October 2019 for the ill fated season that saw the North West Counties League (NWCFL) campaign ultimately decaled Null and Void due to the Covid-19 crisis. Looking to build on its secured stability the club appointed NWCFL Director Gary Langley as Chairman for the start of the 2020-21 season. Former Players St Helens Town have produced a number of players that have gone on to join Football League clubs: these include Bill Foulkes (Manchester United), John Quinn (Sheffield Wednesday) and John Connelly who joined Burnley, later transferring to Manchester United and who played in the England 1966 World Cup winning squad. Town also saw the beginning of Bert Trautmann's career in football. The goalkeeper played a single season with the non-league outfit, including in front of a record 9,000 attendance in the final of the local Mahon Cup,Rowlands, Trautmann: The Biography, p. 85. before moving on to Manchester City in 1949. He went on to win the 1956 FA Cup and be inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2005. More recently, Dave Bamber scored goals in all four divisions of the Football League with a host of different clubs, starting and ending his league career with Blackpool and Karl Ledsham is now playing his football at National League level, initially with Southport, before moving on to playing for Lincoln City.

It has an authorized strength of 1,000 members and is organized on the United States Army structural pattern. The ASDF is under the control of the Governor of Alabama, as the state's Commander in Chief, and comes under the authority of The Adjutant General (TAG) of Alabama. The ASDF is an adjunct, volunteer, augmenting force to the Alabama National Guard, and it is not federally recognized. Currently, the ASDF is inactive awaiting reorganization by the Alabama National Guard. History Prior to the modern National Guard, states would provide volunteer militia units to augment the federal army in times of war. In the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Alabama provided the United States with multiple units of Alabama militia, with most serving for less than a year. During the American Civil War, both Union units and Confederate units were raised in support of the war effort. In the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Alabama raised three volunteer infantry units.http://www.spanamwar.com/units.htm After the declaration of World War II, the majority of the National Guard was mobilized, leaving governors without troops to guard against invasion, provide disaster relief, and protect against civil unrest. Therefore, many states, including Alabama, raised state defense forces to act as a replacement for the National Guard during the war. In 1940, Governor Frank M. Dixon created the Alabama State Guard, recruiting primarily from World War I veterans, mainly from the American Legion.https://web.archive.org/web/20131022022004/http://sdf.alabama.gov/about- asdf/history Alabama took a unique approach in creating its state defense force. While other states actively recruited from veteran's organizations, Alabama went a step further and \\"gave the American Legion of Alabama the responsibility for creating and running its State Guard,\\" and in return, Alabama \\"was able to achieve a functioning state guard sooner than most states.\\" By using an existing private organization as the framework for their state defense force, Alabama was able to achieve full readiness far sooner than might be expected. At the war's end, the Alabama State Guard was deactivated. On December 22, 1983, Governor George Wallace signed Executive Order Number 20, which authorized the creation of the Alabama State Defense Force, the successor of the Alabama State Guard which was disbanded in World War II. In 2008, members delivered meals and water to Hurricane Gustav evacuees.http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20080905/news/809059978#gsc.tab=0 On August 14, 2012, Governor Robert Bentley signed into law the Alabama State Defense Force bill (SB278), which added clarification to the role of the ASDF in relation to the Alabama National Guard, so that the two organizations can be better integrated in future stateside missions. As recently as April 2013, the ASDF was still seeking applicants,http://blog.al.com/press- releases/2013/04/alabama_state_defense_force_of.html but as of November 2013, it was stood down. After the Alabama State Defense Force was disbanded, some of its former members formed the Alabama Volunteers as a private organization organized under the Alabama State Defense Force Association, in order to continue their volunteer service in disaster relief efforts until the ALSDF is reactivated. In Southern Alabama, the U.S. National Reserve Corps was started with members from the ASDF, this national organization also consists of volunteers dedicated to service in disaster relief efforts and participated with the Red Cross in 2014 in damage assessment in Baldwin County. As of October 2020, over seven years since the temporary suspension began, the state of Alabama has not yet finished its reorganization of the Alabama State Defense Force. Mission The mission of the Alabama State Defense Force is to on order of the Adjutant General of Alabama provide trained and ready volunteer individuals and units to support the National Guard conducting Defense Support to Civil Authorities missions to mitigate and/or alleviate the effects of a natural or man-made disaster.

It is situated approximately north-west of Driffield town centre and lies on the A166 road. Background The civil parish is formed by the village of Garton on the Wolds and the hamlet of Elmswell. According to the 2011 UK Census, Garton parish had a population of 348, an increase on the 2001 UK Census figure of 299. On 1 April 1935 the parish of \\"Garton on the Wolds\\" was abolished and merged with Emswell with Little Driffield to form \\"Garton\\" parish. The parish council is still called \\"Garton on the Wolds Parish Council\\". St Michael's and All Angels St Michael's and All Angels interior Garton's church, St Michael's and All Angels, was designated a Grade I listed building in 1966 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England. It is on the Sykes Churches Trail devised by the East Yorkshire Churches Group. The church dates back to Norman times, circa 1132. In the 19th century it was restored by John Loughborough Pearson, with funding from Sir Tatton Sykes, 4th Baronet of nearby Sledmere House. Later his son, Sir Tatton Sykes, 5th Baronet, employed George Edmund Street to furnish the church. It was eulogised by Nicholas Pevsner and is a popular visitor attraction due to its unique interior; the walls and ceilings are decorated in colourful murals depicting various biblical scenes, in sharp contrast to the stark interior of many other churches, and it has highly geometric floors in the altar and nave. The mosaics in the sacristy are in the Cosmati style, and some resemble Sierpinskifractals. In 1823 Garton parish was in the Wapentake of Dickering, and the Liberty of St Peter. There existed a Methodist chapel, and a school which was partly supported by revenue from shares in the Driffield Navigation. Population at the time was 357. Occupations included twelve farmers, three tailors, two butchers, two grocers, two wheelwrights, a blacksmith, a boot & shoe maker, and the landlords of The Three Tuns and The Chase Inn public houses. There was also a schoolmaster and five gentlemen. Garton was served by Garton railway station on the Malton and Driffield Railway between 1853 and 1950.

The title of the album was inspired by a line in the album's song \\"The Waltz\\". The album was released three years after their second album, the internationally successful Too-Rye-Ay. At the time, Dexys' lineup had been pared down from ten members to just four: vocalist/guitarist Kevin Rowland, guitarist Billy Adams, violinist Helen O'Hara, and saxophonist Nick Gatfield, the last of whom left the band after the recording sessions were completed. These four members are pictured on the original album cover in suits (and, for the men, ties), in what Rowland referred to as an \\"Ivy League\\" or \\"Brooks Brothers\\" look. The album was a commercial failure upon release, and its rejection by both critics and the public resulted in the group's disbandment in 1987. The album was later described as a \\"neglected masterpiece\\" by Uncut, and was selected as one of the 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. In 2002, EMI and Rowland co- operated on a remastered \\"Director's Cut\\" edition of the album, which included an additional song added to the tracklist and expanded liner notes. Recording Because the band's lineup had been reduced to a quartet by the time of the recording, a number of performers and session musicians filled the other roles during the lengthy recording sessions, including Vincent Crane (ex-Atomic Rooster) on piano, Julian Littman on mandolin, Tim Dancy (who had been Al Green's drummer) on drums, Tommy Evans on steel guitar, and former Dexys members \\"Big\\" Jim Paterson on trombone, John \\"Rhino\\" Edwards on bass, and Robert Noble on organ and synthesizer. In an interview with HitQuarters, saxophonist Gatfield described the recording as a \\"long drawn out painful process\\". Gatfield, who did not play on Too-Rye-Ay, felt that the new album marked a telling and troubling shift from it, as unlike that record, which he claimed was made very inexpensively and \\"had an energy about it\\", Don't Stand Me Down cost a huge amount of money and, according to Gatfield, \\"felt uncomfortable and unnatural\\". O'Hara expressed a different perspective in a newspaper interview accompanying the reissue of the album. O'Hara, who had been part of the Too-Rye-Ay band, said that \\"it became clear that Kevin wanted to experiment more musically\\" than the record company was comfortable with, and that, even before the album was released, \\"it was obvious that nobody was really going to promote it.\\" To her, the best thing about Don't Stand Me Down was \\"that it got released at all\\", but the lack of commercial success was \\"quite hard to deal with, particularly for Kevin.\\" On the original issue, just Alan Winstanley and Rowland were credited as producers, but Adams and O'Hara were added as co-producers in 1997, when the CD was reissued on Creation Records; at the same time, the titles to two of the songs were changed. Reception The album was a commercial failure upon release, in part due to frontman Kevin Rowland's refusal to do publicity for the album or to release a single from it. An edited version of \\"This Is What She's Like\\" was eventually released as a single, backed with part one of \\"Reminiscence\\", but the two- month delay from the album's release to its release led to the single missing the charts entirely. Some reviewers were highly critical, with \\"Trouser Press\\" characterizing the release as \\"a torpid snore that denies entertainment on every level\\", although writing in the Melody Maker, Colin Irwin described it as \\"quite the most challenging, absorbing, moving, uplifting and ultimately triumphant album of the year\\". The album is now considered something of a lost treasure: it was featured in 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, published in 2006 by Universe, where it was referred to as \\"a towering achievement... a Pet Sounds for the 1980s\\". Writing for Uncut in 2007, Paul Moody called it a \\"neglected masterpiece\\".Paul Moody Uncut, March 2007, p.10. Rowland remarked in 2008 that \\"I don't want to think about it too much because I want to think about what I'm doing now, but I remember coming out of the studio thinking, 'That's the best I can do.'\\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/mar/07/popandrock1 In 2008, Bob Stanley of The Guardian commented on the album's failure, noting that it \\"emerged in a far less adventurous era than the one Too-Rye-Ay was released into. New mavericks on the block such as the Smiths and the Jesus and Mary Chain were entirely ignored by Radio 1. The same happened to Dexys, though it was their own fault ‚Äì no single was released from the album.\\" Reissues =1997 Creation CD= In the 1990s, Rowland purchased the rights to Don't Stand Me Down from Mercury and decided to license a digitally-remastered CD reissue of the album to Creation Records, which was releasing his current material. The album was issued by Creation in 1997 (CRECD154), and the cover of the album was changed to a shot of just Rowland and Adams from the same photo sessions as the original cover. Rowland's new sleeve notes, entitled \\"Foreword to the Second Edition\\", discusses the changing of two of the song titles from the original release: \\"Knowledge of Beauty\\" became \\"My National Pride\\", and \\"Listen to This\\" became \\"I Love You (Listen to This)\\". \\"My National Pride\\" was the original title of the former song, but Rowland \\"didn't have the courage to title it that when it came around to the artwork.\\" In addition, the writers of the Warren Zevon song \\"Werewolves of London\\" were given co-writing credit on \\"One of Those Things\\", which uses the Zevon song as a background theme. Finally, two extra tracks were added to the release: \\"Reminisce (Part One)\\", recorded in the spring of 1983 prior to Don't Stand Me Down (and released as the B-side to the reissue of \\"The Celtic Soul Brothers\\" that year), and a version of \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\". =2002 Director's Cut= During the mastering process for the Creation release, a stereo enhancer was used, which both Rowland and original recording engineer Pete Schwier felt \\"ruined the dynamics.\\" As a result, Rowland ultimately licensed the tracks to Dexys original label, EMI, to release a third and definitive version of the album in 2002, subtitled The Director's Cut. The tracks were again digitally remastered, but without the stereo enhancer, and the CD featured new artwork, further notes by Rowland, and the additional track \\"Kevin Rowland's 13th Time\\", but excluded both of the extra tracks on the Creation release. The cover photo was changed to a photo from a contemporaneous but different photo session of Rowland, Adams, and O'Hara strolling in a park wearing \\"preppy\\" clothes (which had been used as the back- cover photo on the Creation reissue). According to Rowland, the album now sounded to him \\"as it was intended to sound.\\" The extra tracks added in the Creation release were excluded, but another new track was added. According to Rowland, \\"Kevin Rowland's 13th Time\\" had originally been intended to be the opening song (with the introductory lyric \\"My name is Kevin Rowland, I'm the leader of the band\\" and, in a later verse, a \\"joke\\" of sorts, to \\"kick off the proceedings\\"), but was left off the original issue of the album due to his perception at the time of a \\"dodgy drum beat\\" at one point; it was restored for The Director's Cut. Rowland penned two pages of notes relating to the track, as well as a new \\"foreword to The Director's Cut\\", while also including his sleeve notes from the Creation \\"Second Edition\\". A limited-edition version of The Director's Cut had a DVD disc included, featuring videos for the songs \\"This Is What She's Like\\", \\"My National Pride\\", and \\"I Love You (Listen to This)\\", directed by Jack Hazan. Rowland penned another page of notes regarding the videos. The booklet shows, in a two-page spread, a photo from the video shoot, with Dexys as an eight-piece band, with Rowland, Adams, and O'Hara in the foreground. All three videos feature footage from this set. While \\"This Is What She's Like\\" includes footage of Rowland and Adams walking the streets of New York City, and \\"My National Pride\\" shows the band in pastoral scenes evocative of Ireland, \\"I Love You (Listen to This)\\" is shot entirely on this set, dark, with a single spotlight on Rowland, no other band member visible, just various angles on Rowland singing the verses and choruses‚Äîthe majority of the song‚Äîuntil the final instrumental ride-out, when Billy Adams, Helen O'Hara, and the rest of the musicians are finally seen for a few seconds.

After completing his mission, he served briefly with Polish troops in Italy and then parachuted back into Poland to resume his duties with the Polish Underground. Capture and subsequent liberation In 1944 Opala was captured by German forces in the Warsaw Uprising and held in Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp in Bavaria. After his liberation by the U.S. Army in 1945, he was befriended by Gene Warr, a captain in the 45th Infantry Division from Oklahoma City. Opala confided in Warr that he could not return to Poland after the Communist takeover and would probably settle somewhere in the British Commonwealth.\\"Opala celebrates 40 years in state\\" Edmond Sun, April 3, 2006. 10-13-09 U.S. immigration and education Captain Warr helped Opala get a job as a translator for U.S. forces in Occupied Germany, and offered to help him immigrate to the United States.

Many of his top hits were released in the 1980s, including \\"Louisiana Saturday Night\\", \\"Big Ole Brew\\", \\"Stand Up\\", \\"Baby's Got Her Blue Jeans On\\" (which reached number one on the country chart), \\"I Call It Love\\", \\"Stand on It\\", and a remake of Chuck Berry's \\"Let It Roll (Let It Rock)\\". McDaniel's type of country music has been referred to as \\"the quintessential happy song\\" in comparison to other country artists who discuss broken hearts and lost loves. When asked why most of his songs are mostly positive, McDaniel told the Anchorage Daily News that \\"there's enough things in the world to keep you bummed out\\" and that his fans don't want to \\"hear me singing something that's gonna bum 'em out some more.\\" Biography =Early life= McDaniel was born in Checotah, Oklahoma, a small town in McIntosh County, Oklahoma, and grew up in Okmulgee, Oklahoma. He was inspired to play music after seeing Elvis Presley on television. His first interest in music was when he learned the trumpet in the fourth grade, but he soon learned the guitar. At age 14, he taught himself the guitar chords to \\"Frankie and Johnny\\" and performed at a high-school talent contest. He made his professional debut at age 15 performing in a talent contest at Okmulgee High School. While in high school, he played in several local bands, and after graduation, began working as a musician in Tulsa clubs. While in Tulsa, he recorded several singles for local label J.J. Cale and wrote and produced his first single, \\"Lazy Me\\". =Career= After marrying his high school sweetheart, McDaniel began performing in Tulsa. From there, he had an unsuccessful trip to Nashville, followed by quite a bit of success in Anchorage, Alaska, performing in the oil fields. After two years there, he returned to Nashville and landed a job as a demo singer and songwriter with Combine Music. With the help of music publisher Bob Beckham, Mel signed to Capitol Records in 1976 and released his first single, \\"Have a Dream on Me\\". His career finally took off with \\"Louisiana Saturday Night\\" in 1981, and in early 1985 he scored his only number one hit with \\"Baby's Got Her Blue Jeans On\\". Other Top 10 hits include \\"Right in the Palm of Your Hand\\" (later covered by Alan Jackson in 1999), \\"Take Me to the Country\\", \\"Big Ole Brew\\", \\"I Call It Love\\", and \\"Real Good Feel Good Song\\". McDaniel became a member of the Grand Ole Opry on January 11, 1986, and made frequent appearances on the show. McDaniel was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame in 2006, along with induction classmate Leon Russell. =Later years and death= On November 14, 1996, he had a near-fatal fall into an orchestra pit while he was performing at the Heymann Performing Arts Center in Lafayette, Louisiana. This ended his touring career and he underwent several surgeries thereafter. McDaniel never recovered from his injuries. On June 16, 2009, McDaniel suffered a heart attack, putting him in a medically induced coma in a Nashville area hospital, according to The Tennessean. McDaniel's wife, Peggy, requested the prayers of the singer's fans, saying his situation was \\"not good.\\" McDaniel recovered from the heart attack, but on February 19, 2011, he was diagnosed with lung cancer, and died at his home on the evening of March 31, as a result of the disease.

The western end of the western segment is in the town of Burlington, at SR 29. The highway passes through rural areas of Carroll and Howard counties, before ending in Kokomo. The eastern segment begins at an interchange with U.S. Route 31 (US 31) and US 35, in Kokomo, and heads east passing through towns and cities like Greentown, Gas City and Upland, before ending at SR 26. The western segment of SR 22 is concurrent with US 35 from Kokomo to Interstate 69 (I-69). The entire road covers a distance of about , passing through mostly rural areas. The originally designated road along modern SR 22 was SR 35, running between Kokomo and SR 11 (now SR 9), with SR 22 being routed between SR 16 (now SR 62) and Indianapolis. In the mid-1920s the state of Indiana renumber its state road system and the SR 22 designated was moved to an alignment, between Illinois state line and US 52. In the early 1930s SR 22 was moved to its contemporary alignment, running between SR 29 and US 27 at the time. The concurrency with US 35 was added in the mid-1930s between Burlington and Jonesboro. In the late 1930s SR 22 was moved to a new alignment between Hartford City and the Ohio state line. The entire road was paved before the late 1960s. The road east of SR 26 was removed in the 1970s. Between 2014 and 2016, the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) relinquished the road through Kokomo. Route description =Western segment= The western segment of SR 22 begins at an intersection between Michigan Street (SR 29) and 7th Street, in the town of Burlington. The street heads northeast, leaving Burlington, before bending to become east-west heading towards Kokomo. On its way to Kokomo SR 22 passes through rural Carroll and Howard counties before an intersection with Malfalfa Road. The SR 22 designation ends at this intersection but the roadway continues east towards downtown Kokomo as Sycamore Street. = Eastern segment = Gas City downtown. The eastern segment of SR 22 begins at an intersection with US 31 and US 35 on the east side of Kokomo. SR 22 heads due east concurrent with US 35, passing through agriculture properties. The concurrency has an intersection with SR 19 at this intersection SR 19 heads east concurrent with US 35/SR 22. The highway enters Greentown passing through downtown before an intersection with the northern end of SR 213. East of Greentown the road has a four-way stop with SR 13, at this intersection SR 19 turns north concurrent with SR 13. Past SR 13 the road has an intersection with SR 37, southwest of the Marion Municipal Airport, before passing just south of the airport. The road has an intersection with SR 9, before curving northeast, passing just north of Jonesboro. US 35 and SR 22 crosses over a Norfolk Southern railroad track before bending to become east-west and having an intersection with SR 15.

Main Street crosses over a railroad track, passing houses before passing on the east side of Taylor University. SR 22 end at an intersection with SR 26 on the southeast corner of the university. History Prior to 1926 SR 22 was on an alignment between SR 16, now SR 62, and Indianapolis, passing through Bloomington. At this time SR 35 was routed along modern SR 22 from Kokomo to SR 11, now SR 9, while the segment of SR 22 in Jay County was part of SR 23. SR 23 went between Pennville and US 27 between Portland and Bryant. In 1926 SR 22 was proposed between the Illinois state line and US 41 in Boswell, while SR 22 was commissioned between US 41 and US 52 along the modern route of SR 352. The route of modern SR 22 between Kokomo and SR 9 became part of SR 18, while the section of SR 22 in Jay County also became part of SR 18. SR 22 was commissioned from the Illinois state line to US 41, along modern SR 26, between 1928 and 1929. Many changes to the SR 22 designation happen in 1931 the first being SR 22 between Illinois state line and US 41 became part of SR 26, while the segment of road from US 41 and US 52 became SR 152. SR 22 was proposed between SR 25 near Lafayette and SR 29. The final changes in 1931 was SR 22 was designated between SR 29 and US 27. The proposed section of SR 22 west of SR 29 was removed from any proposals between late 1932 and 1933. US 35 was commissioned to follow SR 22 from SR 29 to Gas City between 1934 and 1935. In either 1938 or 1939 SR 22 from Hartford to Pennville was moved north onto a new road to the state road system. At this time SR 22 was added between US 27 and the Ohio state line, connecting to Ohio State Route 219. The concurrency with US 35, between SR 29 and Kokomo, was removed in between 1939 and 1941. The last section of SR 22 to be paved was the section in eastern Blackford County, being paved in either 1969 or 1970. The eastern terminus of SR 22 was moved from the Ohio state line to SR 26 near Upland, removing SR 22 from Blackford and Jay counties, between 1976 and 1977. The former route of SR 22 in Blackford and Jay counties became county roads. On June 27, 2014, INDOT stated that \\"pending contract approval\\" they would transfer 5.8 miles of SR 22 to the city of Kokomo, from the western city limits to the US 31/35 interchange which opened in 2013. This gap in SR 22 was first noted in INDOT's 2016 Reference Post Book.

Owned by iHeartMedia, Inc., the station serving both the New Orleans and Baton Rouge metropolitan areas. The KVDU studios are located in the Central Business District of New Orleans, while the transmitter resides in nearby South Vacherie. Besides a standard analog transmission, KVDU broadcasts two HD Radio channels, and is available online via iHeartRadio.  History  When 104.1 originally signed on the air on November 15, 1968, it was KHOM, with the call sign reflecting its Houma city of license.Broadcasting Yearbook 1970 page B-88 It broadcast from a 350-foot antenna, only targeting the Houma area. In 1989, it moved its transmitter atop the 2,000-foot tower in Vacherie used by WCKW-FM (now WZRH). That allowed the signal to penetrate into the New Orleans and Baton Rouge markets. The more-powerful signal could also be heard in Lafayette, Louisiana, and even some counties in Mississippi. The station remained licensed to Houma, but dropped its Middle of the Road radio format for oldies. In late 1994, after WEZB ended its Top 40 format in favor of Hot Talk, KHOM owner, Raymond A. Saadi decided to switch formats to Top 40 as \\"Mix 104.1.\\" The station kept the heritage KHOM call letters for several years, then in 1998, changed them to KUMX to reflect the \\"Mix\\" identity. In February 1997, the station was bought by iHeartMedia, then known as Clear Channel Communications, for $8.75 million.Broadcasting Yearbook 1999 page D-191 Clear Channel also acquired other FM stations in the New Orleans market, acquiring urban contemporary WQUE-FM, urban adult contemporary WYLD-FM, country music WNOE-FM, and alternative rock KKND (now KMEZ). Under Clear Channel ownership, KUMX ran a small play list, stressing repeated airing of the biggest current hits. The move to Top 40 paid off in the ratings until 2000, when WEZB evolved back to its original Top 40 format. On June 29, 2001, at 6 a.m., \\"Mix\\" signed off with \\"When It's Over\\" by Sugar Ray. It then began stunting by playing only construction sound effects.Mix 104.1 KUMX flips from CHR to Classic Hits KFXN 104-1 The Fox At 5 p.m. that day, it debuted a classic rock format as \\"104-1 The Fox,\\" under the new call sign KFXN-FM. The new format launched with an \\"All Beatles Weekend\\", beginning with \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\\" On July 26, 2002, the station returned to Top 40 music as the adult-leaning \\"104.1 KISS-FM,\\" under the new call sign KSTE-FM.

After 16 months in the gospel format, Clear Channel decided to replace it with active rock on November 13, 2006, and in the process, inherited \\"The Rock of New Orleans\\" slogan from sister station WRNO-FM, which on the same day dropped its heritage rock/classic rock format for all-talk.

In practice it runs from the southwest to the northeast, though it is designated as a north‚Äìsouth route.Indiana Highway Ends ‚Äì SR 23 It is an undivided surface road. Route description Indiana State Road 23 (SR 23) begins about east of the northeastern shore of Bass Lake in Starke County at the intersection of State Road 10 and County Road 900E. From there, it heads north toward Grovertown, where it intersects US 30. SR 23 continues north until Walkerton in the extreme southwestern corner of St. Joseph County, where it meets US 6. After a very brief concurrency with that route, SR 23 departs town to the north, then quickly turns northeast toward South Bend, passing through North Liberty. As it enters the South Bend metropolitan area, SR 23 has an interchange with US 20/US 31 (the St. Joseph Valley Parkway). It then traverses the city of South Bend from southwest to northeast, passing very near the campus of the University of Notre Dame. After crossing under the Indiana East-West Toll Road (I-80/I-90) without providing any access, SR 23 parallels that tollway briefly before reaching an intersection with SR 331, which does provide access to the Toll Road (at its Exit 83). From there SR 23 proceeds northeast into the town of Granger before it curves due north to reach the Michigan state line.  History  Prior to 1926 the SR 23 designation when from SR 13, north of Pennville, to SR 21, north of Portland. When the Indiana State Highway Commission renumber most of the state roads in 1926 the SR 23 designation went unused at the time. It wasn‚Äôt until late 1930 when the SR 23 designation was used again along its modern routing between US 30, in Grovertown and M-62 at the Michigan state line. This segment of roadway becomes a high type of driving surface between 1939 and 1941. The road was extended south from US 30 to SR 10 in either 1950 or 1951. This section of roadway was paved between 1963 and 1964.

Life and career Bolden was born in Bibb County, Alabama in 1910, and worked to put herself through school at Stillman College, graduating in 1952. She later earned her master's degree in library sciences from Atlanta University. In 1948, she procured county money to start a library in the local community center in West Tuscaloosa (West End). In 1961, she secured funding to build a new library. She was the first librarian of that library and requested that the library be named for Dr. George Augustus Weaver (1872 -1939), a prominent black citizen who allowed local young people to use his private library. In 1991, this branch of the Tuscaloosa Public Library was renamed the Weaver-Bolden branch in her honor. Bolden was a follower of T.Y. Rogers, who was a leader in the local Civil Rights Movement. She was a member of the Tuscaloosa Citizens Action Committee and helped register blacks to vote. Bolden was among those who were in First African Baptist Church planning a civil rights march when it was tear-gassed by local authorities on June 9, 1964, a day known by many as \\"Bloody Tuesday.\\" Bolden held several distinguished memberships and honors, including membership in the First African Baptist Church, the League of Women Voters, Bryce Human Rights Committee (appointed by the Federal Court), the Tuscaloosa County Jury Commission and was president of the Stillman College National Alumni Association.

The subdistrict lies on the right bank of the Pearl River Delta in Guangdong. History Monument to Chin Gee Hee The area of present-day Taicheng Subdistrict has been continuously incorporated since 1499, when the area was incorporated as Xinning City (). In 1891, the Presbyterian Church of America constructed a chapel on the main thoroughfare of Tai Xi Road, which was reconstructed in elegant red-brick in 1922 with a capacity of 300. In 1906, under the oversight of Chin Gee Hee, the Sun Ning Railway Company began building a railway to connect Sunning (Xinning) County to its northern and southern neighbors. On March 1, 1909, the Sunning Railway Station () was opened in what is now the subdistrict. The rail line, which was completed in 1920, drew attention both domestically and internationally for being the first Chinese-funded and Chinese-constructed railroad in the world. In 1907, the Tan Clan Middle School was founded east of the town, but is now surrounded by urban development. A new residential school is being constructed outside of the town to replace what is now a dilapidated and crowded structure. In 1938, Xinning was designated the administrative center of Xinning County. The same year, the area's railway was ordered by the Nationalist Government to be destroyed to prevent the advance of invading Japanese troops. The Xinning Railway Station would subsequently be repurposed as a bus station. On March 3, 1941, Japanese troops from Doushan marched into Taicheng led by a Chinese traitor, and took the town in three hours. 282 people were killed, 534 stores and houses were burnt, and goods estimated at ¬•3,600,000 were plundered. A week later the Nationalist Chinese Army retook the town, but were again forced out on September 20, 1941. Japanese troops remained in occupation until their unconditional surrender at the end of the war on August 15, 1945. In 1949 more than 30,000 people gathered in Taishan Park to celebrate the Communist victory in the civil war against the armies of the Kuomintang (KMT) of Chiang Kai- shek. Upon the establishment of the People's Republic of China, Xinning City was renamed as Taicheng Town (). From 1958 to 1983, Taicheng was re-designated as a people's commune. On August 11, 2006, Taicheng was upgraded from a town to a subdistrict. Railway service within the subdistrict restarted in 2018 with the construction of the () within the village of Nankeng. The railway station was designed to replicate the original design of the Xinning Railway Station. The station lies upon the Shenzhen‚ÄìZhanjiang high-speed railway. Geography Pedestrian MallThe subdistrict covers 157.6 km¬≤ with a population of 175,321 as of 2008.

Early life Kauger was born in New Cordell, Oklahoma, and grew up in Colony, Oklahoma, where she helped her parents John and Alice Kauger with various chores on the family farm including picking cotton. Upon getting her driver's license, Kauger accepted a summer job at a small law firm. She was the valedictorian of her graduating class at Colony High School in 1955. Her time with the small law firm inspired her to pursue her law degree. =Education= Kauger attended Southwestern Oklahoma State University where she majored in biology and minored in both chemistry and English. She graduated in three years and worked as a medical technician at a medical arts lab for five years after graduating from an internship program at Saint Anthony Hospital. Kauger used this profession to fund her dream of becoming a lawyer.

Born in Akron, Ohio, Batiuk attended Kent State University, from which he graduated in 1969 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree, majoring in painting. He went on to teach art in junior high school. He put his experiences to use in his gag-a- day Funky Winkerbean, which first appeared in print on March 27, 1972. With the success of the strip, he abandoned his teaching career, occasionally returning to the classroom to refresh his sources. He authored two spinoff strips, John Darling, which ran from 1979 through 1990 ending with the death of the title character, and Crankshaft, which began syndication in 1987. These strips sometimes experience crossovers. Over the years, Batiuk's strips have taken on an increasing narrative continuity. Starting in 1986, Funky, and to a lesser extent Crankshaft, sometimes abandoned humor to explore serious, even tragic subject matter. 'Funky' has been time jumped twice, first aging the characters to their late 20s early 30s and a second jump pushed them into late middle age. Crankshaft was never jumped, but he is shown in crossovers to suffer a rather painful retirement. His stories often involve strong drama elements combined with generally rosy outcomes or ending with a pun. They also show a strong belief in God, as well as sympathies for the American military.

Public history practice is deeply rooted in the areas of historic preservation, archival science, oral history, museum curatorship, and other related fields. The field has become increasingly professionalized in the United States and Canada since the late 1970s. Some of the most common settings for the practice of public history are museums, historic homes and historic sites, parks, battlefields, archives, film and television companies, and all levels of government. Definition Because it incorporates a wide range of practices and takes place in many different settings, public history proves resistant to being precisely defined. Four key elements often emerge from the discourse of those who identify themselves as public historians: * use of the methods of the historical discipline * an emphasis on the usefulness of historical knowledge in some way that goes beyond purely academic or antiquarian purposes * an emphasis on professional training and practice * an aim to deepen and empower public connection with the past These elements are expressed in the 1989 mission statement of the U.S.-based National Council on Public History: \\"To promote the utility of history in society through professional practice.\\"Reflections on an Idea: NCPH‚Äôs First Decade by Barbara J. Howe, Chair's Annual Address, The Public Historian, Vol. 11, No. 3 (Summer 1989), pp. 69‚Äì85 They are also present in a definition drafted by the NCPH board in 2007, stating, \\"Public history is a movement, methodology, and approach that promotes the collaborative study and practice of history; its practitioners embrace a mission to make their special insights accessible and useful to the public.\\" However, this draft definition prompted some challenges on the H-Public listserv from people in the field,\\"\\"Public History Redux\\", Public History News (September 2007) who raised questions about whether public history is solely an endeavor by professional or trained historians, or if shared historical authority should be a key element of the field. Others have pointed out that the existence of many \\"publics\\" for public history complicates the task of definition. For example, historian Peter Novick has questioned whether much of what is termed public history should actually be called private history (for example, the creation of corporate histories or archives) or popular history (for example, research or exhibits conducted outside the norms of the historical discipline).Peter Novick, That Noble Dream: The \\"Objectivity Question\\" and the American Historical Profession (1988), 510-21 Cathy Stanton has also identified a more radical element in North American public history but has asked: 'how much room is there for the progressive component in the public history movement?'Cathy Stanton, The Lowell Experiment: Public History in a Postindustrial City (U. of Massachusetts Press, 2006), p. 28 Hilda Kean and Paul Ashton have also discussed the differences in public history in Britain, Australia, New Zealand and the U.S., arguing against 'a rigid demarcation between \\"historians\\" and \\"their publics\\"'.Paul Ashton and Hilda Kean (eds), People and their Pasts: Public History Today (Palgrave Macmillan, 2009), p. 1 A 2008 survey of almost 4,000 practitioners predominantly in the U.S. showed that a substantial proportion (almost one quarter of respondents) expressed some reservations about the term and whether it applied to their own work.John Dichtl and Robert B. Townsend, \\"A Picture of Public History: Preliminary Results from the 2008 Survey of Public History Professionals\\" in Public History News, Vol. 29, No. 4 (September 2009) In general, those who embrace the term public historian accept that the boundaries of the field are flexible. The juxtapositions between public and academic history cannot be ignored, causing complications in defining who is capable of altering what we define as generally accepted history. John Tosh, a historian who has researched public history, discusses how some of the most productive discussions come from oral history, consisting of people being interviewed about their memory. Its definition remains a work in progress, subject to continual re-evaluation of practitioners' relationships with different audiences, goals, and political, economic, or cultural settings. For example, historian Guy Beiner has criticized the prevalent conception of public history for not adequately taking on board ‚Äúthe countless intimate spheres in which history is retold surreptitiously‚Äù and concluded that ‚Äúthe complex relationships between private and public forms of history await to be teased out‚Äù.Guy Beiner, Forgetful Remembrance: Social Forgetting and Vernacular Historiography of a Rebellion in Ulster (Oxford University Press, 2018), pp. 11-12. Related fields Public history refers to a wide variety of professional and academic fields.Marko Demantowsky, ‚ÄúPublic History‚Äù ‚Äì Sublation of a German Debate?, Public History Weekly, volume 3, number 2, 2015 Some of these include: * Applied history * Archival science * Cultural Heritage Management * Digital History * Heritage Interpretation * Historic Preservation * Historical archaeology * Museology * Oral History * Public humanities * Popular history In addition, a sub-field of scholarly study has developed over the past several decades which focuses on the history and theory of collective memory and history-making. This body of scholarship (typified by the winners of the National Council on Public History Book Award) may also be considered to be \\"public history.\\" History Public history has many antecedents. These include history museums, historical societies, public and private archives and collections, hereditary and memorial associations, preservation organizations, historical and heritage projects and offices within government agencies, and depictions of history in popular culture of all kinds (for example, historical fiction). Ludmilla Jordanova has also observed that 'the state... lies at the heart of public history', linking public history to the rise of the nation state.Ludmilla Jordanova, The Practice of History (London: Edward Arnold, 2003) p. 155. (English Theologian William Paley declared in 1794 that 'public history' was a 'register of the successes and disappointments... and the quarrels of those who engage in contentions [for] power'.)Editorial, Public History Review, vol 10, 2003, p. 5. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a distinct historical discipline formed within Western universities, and this had the effect of gradually separating scholars who practiced history professionally from amateur or public practitioners.Ian Tyrrell, Historians in Public: the Practice of American History, 1890-1970 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2005), p. 209. While there continued to be trained historians working in public settings, there was a general retreat from public engagement among professional historians by the middle decades of the twentieth century.Rebecca Conard, Benjamin Shambaugh and the Intellectual Foundations of Public History (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 2002), p. 148 During the 1970s, a number of political, economic, social, and historiographical developments worked to reverse this trend, converging to produce a new field that explicitly identified itself as ‚Äúpublic history‚Äù. The social justice movements of the 1960s and 1970s had sparked an interest in the histories of non-dominant people and groups‚Äîfor example, women, working-class people, ethnic and racial minorities‚Äîrather than the ‚Äúgreat men‚Äù who had traditionally been the focus of many historical narratives. In Britain, this emerged through the History Workshop Movement. Many historians embraced social history as a subject, and some were eager to become involved in public projects as a way of using their scholarship in activist or public-oriented ways.James Green, Taking History to Heart: The Power of the Past in Building Social Movements (Amherst, Massachusetts: University of Massachusetts Press, 2000), p. 2 In the U.S., a severe shortage of academic jobs for historians led many to consider careers outside the academy.Novick, That Noble Dream, p. 512 At the same time, publicly funded efforts were underway in many Western countries, ranging from national celebrations like the United States Bicentennial to multiculturalist projects in Australia and Canada, paralleled by widespread public interest in genealogy, the tracing of folk and family ‚Äúroots‚Äù, and other history-related activities. In the wake of deindustrialization in many industrial places, governments also supported regeneration or revitalization projects that increasingly included the use of local history and culture as an attraction or a basis for ‚Äúre-branding‚Äù a depressed area.Bella Dicks, Culture on Display: The Production of Contemporary Visitability (Maidenhead, UK: Open University Press, 2003), p. 35 Out of necessity, inclination, or both, a growing number of people with graduate training in history found employment in these kinds of non-academic settings. Public policy decisions like the passage of the U.S. National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and the Canadian government's addition of ‚Äúhistorical researcher‚Äù as a civil service category in the 1970s,John R. English, \\"The Tradition of Public History in Canada,\\" The Public Historian Vol. 5, No. 1 (Winter 1983), pp. 58-59 along with the rise of cultural tourism and the increasing professionalization of many museums and historical societies, have spurred the growth of the field. In the U.S., the birth of the public history field can be traced to the University of California, Santa Barbara, where Robert Kelley, a member of the history faculty, obtained a Rockefeller Foundation grant in 1976 to create a graduate program to train young historians for public and private sector careers.G. Wesley Johnson, \\"The Origins of The Public Historian and the National Council on Public History,\\" The Public Historian Vol. 21, No. 3 (Summer 1999), pp. 167-79 Kelley drew on his own extensive experience as a consultant and legal witness in water litigation cases in conceiving the idea of ‚Äúpublic history‚Äù as a field in its own right. Conferences in Scottsdale, Arizona in 1978 and Montecito, California in 1979 helped to catalyze the new field. The launch of a professional journal, The Public Historian, in 1978, and the founding of the National Council on Public History in 1979 further served to give public- minded historians in the academy and isolated practitioners outside of it a sense that they shared a set of missions, experiences, and methods. Public history in Canada has followed a similar trajectory in many ways, including the experience of an academic ‚Äújobs crisis‚Äù in the 1970s and the importance of government as a source of employment for public historians.English, \\"Tradition of Public History in Canada\\" In 1983, the University of Waterloo created a Masters program in Public History (now defunct), followed by The University of Western Ontario in 1986, and Carleton University in 2002. Also as in the U.S., Canadian public funding for history and heritage projects has shrunk in the past two decades, with public historians increasingly accountable to funders for the effectiveness of their work.Lyle Dick, \\"Public History in Canada: An Introduction,\\" The Public Historian Vol. 31, No. 1 (February 2009), pp. 9-10 Public history also exists as an identifiable field in AustraliaAnn Curthoys and Paula Hamilton, ‚ÄúWhat Makes History Public?‚Äù Public History Review 1992, pp. 8-13 and to a lesser extent in EuropeJill Liddington, \\"What is Public History?

In Latin America, public history finds its highest expression in Brazil, where public history is closely connected with social history and oral history. The Brazilian Public History Network, created in 2012, has been responsible for promoting publications and sponsoring events of national and international scope aimed to foster a creative and cosmopolitan dialogue. As in the U.S. and Canada, there are many public projects involving historians and the interpretation of history that do not necessarily claim the specific label ‚Äúpublic history.‚Äù The International Federation for Public History,(IFPH-FIHP) was formed in 2010 and became an international association with elected Steering Committee in January 2012. IFPH is also a permanentInternal Commission for the International Committee of Historical Sciences Internal Commission of the International Committee of Historical Sciences (ICHS-CISH). The IFPH seeks to broaden international exchanges about the practice and teaching of public history and it is one of the constitutive co-operation partners of the journal Public History Weekly. From 2018 IFPH has published its own journal International Public History edited by Andreas Etges (LMU, Munich) and David Dean (Carleton University, Ottawa). Public history continues to develop and define itself. There are currently many graduate and undergraduate public history programs in the U.S., Canada, and other countries (see list and links below). The field has a natural synergy with digital history, with its emphasis on access and broad participation in the creation of historical knowledge. In recent years there has been a growing body of public historical scholarship, including works recognized by the annual NCPH Book Award. In several countries, studies have been conducted to explore how people understand and engage with the past, deepening public historians‚Äô sense of how their own work can best connect with their audiences.For an overview of these, see Margaret Conrad, Jocelyn L√©tourneau, and David Northrup, \\"Canadians and Their Pasts: An Exploration in Historical Consciousness,\\" The Public Historian Vol. 31, No. 1 (February 2009) While high-profile ‚Äúhistory wars‚Äù have taken place over public exhibits and interpretations of history in many places in recent years (for example, Australia's ongoing debate over the history of colonisation and indigenous peoples, the furor over Jack Granatstein‚Äôs 1998 book ‚ÄúWho Killed Canadian History?‚Äù, or the 1994 controversy over the National Air and Space Museum's planned exhibit on the Enola Gay bomber), public historians tend to welcome these as opportunities to participate in vigorous public discussions over the meanings of the past, debating how people arrive at those meanings. An evolving form of locally collected and publicly presented history, seen in projects like If This House Could Talk and the Humanities Truck are a less critical and validated public presentation of history, yet offer engagement at the grass roots level that may encourage new forms of collecting history about the everyday.

Formerly a military facility, the airport is owned by the Port of Moses Lake, and its runway is one of the longest in the world. According to Federal Aviation Administration records, the airport had 1,369 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 2,920 enplanements in 2009, and 1,442 in 2010. It is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011‚Äì2015, which categorized it as a general aviation airport. History Opened as a training airfield during World War II, the facility was operated by the U.S. Air Force as Larson Air Force Base until On 24 June 1969, Japan Airlines Flight 90, a Convair 880, crashed on take-off from runway 32R at Grant County International Airport in Moses Lake, Washington. The power was reduced on the number four engine during take-off, however, the aircraft continued to yaw to the right until the number four engine struck and slid off the runway. It burst into flames, killing three of the five crew members on board. The probable cause was a \\"delayed corrective action during a simulated critical-engine-out takeoff maneuver resulting in an excessive sideslip from which full recovery could not be effected.\\" In September 2019 Boeing stored 100 of its undelivered 737 MAX airplanes at the Moses Lake airport while it awaits clearance from the FAA and other aviation regulators to return the jet to commercial service. Passenger air service to and from Moses Lake ended on 8 June 2010.  Overview  With and a main runway, it is one of the largest airports in the United States. Moses Lake is famous for good flying weather, as it is located on the east side of the Cascade Range, in the semi-arid desert of central Washington. Grant County International Airport was an alternate landing site for the NASA Space Shuttle. Scheduled passenger flights on Big Sky Airlines to Boise and Portland were discontinued on September 1, 2006. The service was subsidized by the Essential Air Service program. United Express, operated by SkyWest Airlines offered nonstop flights to Seattle from June 2009 until June 2010. The airport currently has no commercial passenger air service. The airport was used for heavy jet training by Japan Airlines (JAL) for over forty years, until the closing of their training offices In November 1974, the airport hosted a new Supersonic Transport (SST) Concorde for a month during FAA certification testing. It is also utilized by the U.S. Air Force and Boeing as a testing facility. Most of the traffic at the airport is general and military aviation. In 2011, the 92nd Air Refueling Wing at Fairchild AFB in Spokane temporarily moved its KC-135 R/T fleet and operations to Moses Lake while Fairchild's runway underwent reconstruction and other infrastructure improvements, to include an upgrade to the base's aviation fuel distribution system. The main campus for Big Bend Community College is also located on the grounds of the airport. After the grounding of all Boeing 737 MAXs from March 2019, approximately 50 of the grounded airplanes were parked at the airport. This was originally seen as an economic opportunity for the airport,https://www.king5.com/article/tech/science/aerospace/boeing/boeing-737-max- grounding-an-economic-opportunity-for-moses- lake/281-64802ccf-351d-414e-8686-230347f355d6 but later caused concern as the number of planes stored kept increasing, to approximately 130 by October 2019.http://www.ifiberone.com/columbia_basin/as-s-increase-at-moses-lake- airport-concern-about-storage/article_e85e0fbe- ef7e-11e9-9e90-bf7acdca4b3e.html  Facilities and aircraft  Grant Co.

The castle is within the Brecon Beacons National Park, and its location has been described as spectacular, due to its position above a limestone precipice.Carreg Cennen - Brecon Beacons National Park Authority It has been in a ruinous state since 1462 and is now in the care of Cadw, the Welsh Government historic environment service.  Description  Carreg Cennen Castle consists of a strongly-walled and towered square court. There are six towers, all of different shapes, including a great twin-towered gatehouse on the north side. A range of apartments on the east side of the inner court, or ward, includes a hall, kitchens, chapel, and the so-called 'King's Chamber'. This chamber has a well- carved stone fireplace, and traceried windows, one facing into the courtyard, the other outwards commanding impressive views to the south. These date from the late 13th or early 14th century. The cliff below the castle, and the windows of the passage to the cave The castle from the South, c. 1830 The castle is protected by limestone cliffs to the south and rock-cut ditches to the west. To the north and east there is an outer ward, and within that a barbican, gatehouse. Three drawbridges over deep pits protected the access to the inner ward. In the south-east corner of the inner ward steps lead to a vaulted passage and a natural cave beneath the castle, which leads deep into the hillside. A freshwater spring rises in the cave, which would have been a useful supplement during dry weather when the castle would have had difficulty harvesting rainwater in filling the rainwater cisterns. The castle is under the care of Cadw, who have stabilised and, to a limited extent, restored some of the remains. The castle is accessed via a steep climb up the hill from Castell Farm, which is near the car park. A large threshing barn has been converted to tearooms and a shop, whilst the majority of the farm buildings, around a traditional farmyard, retain their agricultural purposes. Since 1982 these have been part of a farm park with rare and unusual breeds of cows and sheep.Castell Farm, by Bernard Llewellyn, in Lewis, 2006. This castle did not have a keep as such; the gatehouse acted as the castle's keep because this was the tallest part of the Castell Carreg.  Geology  The Carreg Cennen Disturbance, a zone of ancient geological faults and folds stretching from Pembrokeshire to Shropshire, gains its name from this location where it is most impressively revealed. The rocky outcrop on which the castle is perched is an isolated block of Carboniferous Limestone trapped within two faults which form a part of the disturbance. In contrast, the immediately surrounding countryside is underlain by Old Red Sandstone.http://www.largeimages.bgs.ac.uk/iip/mapsportal.html?id=1001722 online version of BGS geological map sheet 230 This disturbance is probably also responsible for the alignment of the Afon Cennen to the west of this location where the river follows the line of the fault for over 2.5 mi / 4 km because firstly glaciers during the Ice Age then more recently the river have found it easier to erode these deformed rocks.  Prehistoric evidence  Human remains found at the site date human activity here back to prehistoric times. The site may well have also been an Iron Age hillfort. Roman coins from the 1st and 2nd century have also been found, although it is unlikely the Romans occupied this site on a permanent basis.  Early castle  The first masonry castle was probably built by the Lord Rhys, who died in 1197, and it remained a possession of the Deheubarth dynasty for the next 50 years. In 1248 Rhys Fychan ap Rhys Mechyll's mother Matilda de Braose, to spite her son, granted the castle to the Norman English, but before the English took possession of it Rhys captured the castle. For the next 30 years it changed hands frequently between Rhys and his uncle Maredudd who were fighting for control of the Kingdom of Deheubarth. In 1277 it was captured by the English, recaptured by the Welsh in 1282 and in English hands again the following year. In 1283 Edward I granted the castle to John Giffard, the commander of the English troops at Cilmeri where Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (The Last) was killed. Giffard was probably responsible for the remodelled castle we see today.  Owain Glyndwr Rebellion  In early July 1403 Owain Glynd≈µr, together with 800 men, attacked Carreg Cennen, but, although inflicting severe damage to the walls, failed to take the castle. It was defended against Glyndwr's forces, who laid siege to it for several months, with Owain himself present, by a man who was to marry one of Glyndwr's daughters just a few years later, Sir John Scudamore of Herefordshire.  Wars of the Roses  The damage was repaired in 1409. However, in 1461, during the Wars of the Roses, Carreg Cennen became a Lancastrian stronghold. A Yorkist force subsequently captured the castle and set about demolishing it with a team of 500 men.  Recent history  Ownership of the castle passed to the Vaughan and Cawdor families, and from the 18th century it started to attract artists (Turner sketched the castle in 1798). The second Earl Cawdor began an extensive renovation in the 19th century, and in 1932 Carreg Cennen was given to the guardianship of the Office of Works. In the 1960s Carreg Cennen Castle was acquired by the Morris family of Castell Farm, when Lord Cawdor's legal team made a mistake in the wording of the deeds and included the castle as part of the farm. Today, the castle remains privately owned by Margaret and Bernard Llewellyn, daughter and son in law of the late Mr. Gwilim Morris. The castle is now maintained by Cadw.

In the wine industry, grape juice that contains 7‚Äì23 percent of pulp, skins, stems and seeds is often referred to as must. The sugars in grape juice allow it to be used as a sweetener, and fermented and made into wine, brandy, or vinegar. In North America, the most common grape juice is purple and made from Concord grapes while white grape juice is commonly made from Niagara grapes, both of which are varieties of native American grapes, a different species from European wine grapes. In California, Sultana (known there as 'Thompson Seedless') grapes are sometimes diverted from the raisin or table market to produce white juice. Grape juice can be made from all grape varieties after reaching appropriate maturity. Because of consumers' preferences for characteristics in colour, flavour and aroma, grape juice is primarily produced from American cultivars of Vitis labrusca. History Information booklet from 1873 advertising Welch's grape juice The method of pasteurizing grape juice to halt fermentation has been attributed to an American physician and dentist, Thomas Bramwell Welch, in 1869. A supporter of the temperance movement, he produced a non-alcoholic wine to be used for church services in his hometown of Vineland, New Jersey. His fellow parishioners continued to prefer and use regular wine. His son, Charles E. Welch, who was also a dentist, eventually gave up his practice to promote grape juice. In 1893, he founded Welch's Grape Juice Company at Westfield, New York. The product was given to visitors at international exhibitions. The oldest extant structure associated with the company is Welch Factory Building No. 1, located at Westfield, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. As the temperance movement grew, so did the popularity of grape juice. In 1913, US Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan served grape juice instead of wine during a full-dress diplomatic function, and in 1914, Josephus Daniels, Secretary of the Navy, forbade any alcoholic drinks on board of naval ships, actively replacing them with grape juice. During World War I, the company supplied \\"grapelade\\", a type of grape jam, to the military and advertised aggressively. Subsequent development of new grape products and sponsorship of radio and television programs made the company successful.  Ingredients and composition  Grape juice from concentrate means that excess water from the grapes was removed, making the juice more concentrated. This allows the juice to be compressed and frozen to make packaging and transporting easier. Water is then added to the juice before being sold. A major brand of American grape juice - Welch's - is made from Concord grapes, using the entire grape (pulp, skin and seeds).\\"Welch's 100% Grape Juice Fact Sheet\\". http://www.welchs.com/sites/default/files/media/documents/welchs_100pgj_factsheet%20%281%29.pdf. [PDF file]. Retrieved 2019-07-30. A small amount of citric acid is naturally found in grapes, and may be added for tart taste and antioxidant properties which inhibit oxidation, leading to a longer storage life. Production  Concord grapes (Vitis labrusca), commonly used for make red grape juice Around mid-September in the northern hemisphere, the grapes are harvested mechanically, using a grape harvesting machine (e.g. Chisholm-Ryder grape harvester), and placed in a bulk box that is transported separately by a tractor or truck. The harvested grapes are then delivered to the processing facility within 4 to 6 hours.(p93) A rotating perforated drum removes any stems and leaves that remain attached to the grapes. Once they are detached from the stems, the grapes are subsequently crushed and pass through the holes of the drum. Stems, leaves and other residuals continue along the drum to be removed as waste.(p93) The crushed grapes are heated to 60 ¬∞C (140 ¬∞F) as they move through a shell and tube heat exchanger. A press aid (e.g. sterilized rice hulls, bleached Kraft paper, ground wood pulp) and a pectinase enzyme are two components that are both added to the grapes at this point for effective juice pressing. The mash of the grapes and press aid is pressed at high temperatures for maximal yield of colour and juice.(p95) There are various types of pressing equipment that can be used for this process (screw, hydraulic, belt, and pneumatic).(p96) Pressed juice and free run juice are held in slurry tanks. The press aid is added to the juice, serving as a filter when the juice undergoes rotary vacuum belt filtration to remove insoluble solids. The juice contains minimal insoluble solids (1% or lower) after filtration.(p97-98) The filtered juice is heated to 85-88 ¬∞C (185-190 ¬∞F) for at least 1 minute and is then cooled to -1.1 - 0 ¬∞C (30-32 ¬∞F) before it is stored in tanks. The stored juice may undergo necessary re-pasteurization if there is any presence of alcohol, yeasts and moulds.(98-99) Additional pectinase is added to speed up and simplify the final filtration process. This filtration process involves diatomaceous earth suspended in the grape juice as it passes through a pre-coated pad or plate. The latter two processes are intended to reduce or prevent sedimentation once the juice is bottled and stored for a long duration of time.(p99-100) There are other process alternatives that can be applied to the processing grape juice, including cold-pressing the juice, and adding sulfur dioxide to the juice.(p101-104) The juice can be further processed by removing water to produce a pure concentrate that can be used in a variety of juice products. Bottled grape juice display in a supermarket  Packaging and storage  Hot filling is traditionally used to package grape juice. In this process, grape juice is heated to a minimum of 77-82 ¬∞C using a heat exchanger before the juice is poured into preheated containers made of materials such as glass or newer, heat resistant plastics. Glass presents a more high quality appearance, but can also be quite fragile and bulky compared to plastics. Pasteurization can also be used afterwards to prolong its shelf life by heating the juice to 85 ¬∞C for 3 min before cooling it down. At the highest quality of retention, unopened grape juice can be stored for 6‚Äì12 months unrefrigerated. After opening, grape juice can be stored for approximately 7‚Äì10 days in the refrigerator before spoilage occurs. Aseptic processing can also be used, which requires the grape juice to be sterilized before packaging. There are different methods of sterilization. Sterile filtration can be used for clarified grape juice with no particulate matter, which uses membranes with a pore size that is small enough to filter out microorganisms (<0.45 ¬µm). Thermal sterilization can also be used by heating the juice to a temperature of 93-100 ¬∞C for 15‚Äì45 seconds. Additionally, the container itself must also be sterilized with a chemical sterilizing agent like hydrogen peroxide. This process is beneficial for packaging materials such as Tetra Paks that cannot withstand high temperatures. The containers must then be filled in a sterile environment and can be stored for at least 6 months unrefrigerated. Although aseptic packaging is more costly, it maximizes shelf life and results in less heat damage and nutrient losses compared to hot filling. Grape varieties Commercial grape juice does not use the same varieties of grapes known for eating as \\"table grapes\\". Due to the large selection of grape varieties, considerations that go into the choice of grape species include factors such as consumer preferences, grape disease resistance, and tolerance to climate. The purple-skinned Concord grape is the most common grape used for juice in North America due to its durability to its environment and its labrusca flavour that comes from its methyl anthranilate properties. This type of grape can also be used for wines and jelly. The green grapes that are used for white grape juice lack the phytochemicals that give their purple counterparts their dark colour.  Research  Due mainly to the absence of rigorous clinical research, there are no confirmed health or anti-disease effects from consuming grape juice. Religious uses = Catholicism = The Catholic Church does not use grape juice in the sacrament because it believes that bread and wine literally become the body and blood of Jesus Christ, a dogma known as transsubstantiation. Therefore, it is believed that not using wine impedes the transsubstantiation from actually happening. The Code of Canon Law of the Catholic Church (1983), Canon 924 says that the wine used must be natural, made from grapes of the vine, and not corrupt. = Protestantism = Some Protestant denominations (specifically those which oppose the use of alcoholic beverages by members) use grape juice in their celebration of the Holy Eucharist. The various Baptist denominations are the most notable. = Judaism = Alcohol is permitted by traditional Jewish law and wine is used for sacramental purposes. The Jewish legal code, the Talmud, in tractate Bava Batra 97b, permits the use of unfermented fresh grape juice for sacramental use. Later legal codes have ruled that while wine is preferable to grape juice, grape juice is permitted for blessings and rituals.

W. Bush and is the only U.S. Treasurer ever to be sent to prison. She had held minor positions under President Ronald Reagan and had chaired the Republican National Hispanic Assembly. In 1994, Villalpando was found guilty of obstruction of justice and tax evasion. Early life Villalpando was born Catalina V√°squez to a poor family in San Marcos, Texas, one of four girls and two boys. Villalpando's father, a lifelong Democrat and migrant worker, used to take her and her siblings out into the fields so they would know what it was like to pick crops for a living. After attending parochial school, Villalpando graduated from San Marcos High School. She subsequently went to work at a jewelry store and as a secretary at Southwest Texas State College where she also attended part-time. She did not complete her studies at Southwest, instead‚Äîat her father's advice‚Äîenrolled at The University of Texas College of Business Administration. Matt S.

Villalpando's association with Republican Party (GOP) politics began at this time when she took a secretarial position with the Texas Republican Party (TRP) in Austin while attending business school. In 1969, she became an assistant to the local director of the Community Service Administration where she dealt with minority and business issues. Villalpando eventually became director and, later, worked for the now defunct Office of Economic Opportunity.Vicki Ru√≠z and Virginia S√°nchez Korrol, \\"Latina U.S. Treasurers,\\" Latinas in the United States: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume I (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 2006), 374-375.

Accessed on June 17, 2009. She also organized her own consulting firm, V. P. Promotions, providing public relations to minority-owned savings and loan institutions under a federal contract. Political career Villalpando was an early supporter of George H. W. Bush for the 1980 election cycle. After Ronald Reagan secured the GOP nomination, she enthusiastically volunteered in the Reagan-Bush campaign effort in Texas. She was rewarded with a position as staff assistant in the White House Office of Presidential Personnel when Reagan took up office in 1981. Later that year, she returned to Texas where she served as the voter groups coordinator for the TRP. For the next two years, Villalpando was a prolific activist in both Republican and Hispanic circles, serving on the boards of the Texas Federation of Republican Women, the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project, the League of United Latin American Citizens, and the American GI Forum. Additionally, she was appointed to seats on the Texas Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization at the Department of Transportation. In 1983, Villalpando's work was noted by the Reagan Administration and she was brought back to Washington as a Special Assistant to the President for Public Liaison. In this capacity, she dealt with public interest groups, lobbyists, and the general public and soon stood out for her \\"formidable...administrative skills.\\"John T.

Villalpando's political profile also rose considerably when her skills and ethnicity were utilized in outreach efforts to attract Hispanics to the Republican Party.Jerry Thomas, \\"Hispanics at Dinner Trade Loyalty Pledges With GOP,\\" The Boston Globe (August 6, 1989). Private sector work After two years, Villalpando left government service again and, in August 1985, took up the position of senior vice president ‚Äì as well as partner and large shareholder ‚Äì at Communications International, Inc. (CII), a Norcross, Georgia-based telecommunications firm.\\"Villalpando's Firm Received U.S. Contracts,\\" Los Angeles Times (November 3, 1992). CII was run by its founder, Joseph Profit, a former Atlanta Falcons running back and popular businessman in Georgia who had served in various appointed capacities in the Reagan Administration and, later, the first Bush Administration. Villalpando was one of several high-profile Republicans that Profit brought on board who helped the company garner millions in federal contracts.Pete Yost, \\"Bush Election Aide Quits Over Treasury Scandal,\\" Chicago Sun-Times (October 31, 1992). Despite her leaving government service during this time, Villalpando's political involvement, especially in regards to bringing more Hispanics into the Republican Party, did not cease. In 1987, Villalpando became the national chair for the Republican National Hispanic Assembly (RNHA). At the time, the RNHA was the auxiliary of the Republican National Committee responsible for Hispanic outreach and advocacy on behalf of the Party. The effort to get her elected as the group's leader came at a time when the presidential campaigns of then Vice President Bush and Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole were engaged in a particularly nasty competition to win the support of Hispanic Republicans for the 1988 election cycle. Villalpando had developed a special talent for attracting Hispanics to the Party and, as a Bush ally, was expected to swing the support of the Assembly to his run for the GOP nod.Jack Anderson and Dale Vanatta, \\"Minority Agency is GOP Battleground,\\" The Washington Post (May 13, 1987). =MBDA investigation= That same year, Villalpando's assumption of the RNHA leadership post came under scrutiny by the Commerce Department's inspector general. An unrelated investigation was already underway looking into allegations that MBDA director James Richardson Gonzalez and Ernest Olivas, Jr., an MBDA employee, had been using their positions to drum up support for Bush's campaign. The probe revealed that Olivas, a friend of Villalpando when the two were on staff together in the Reagan White House where he was the speech-writer for the vice president, had also been soliciting prominent Hispanic Republicans to support her bid for the RNHA chairmanship. RNHA co-founder Francisco Vega was one of those contacted and who confirmed to investigators that Olivas had called him from his government office while on work time, a potential violation of the Hatch Act. Villalpando's role was tangential to the investigation and she was not implicated in any wrongdoing. Olivas subsequently left government service and became employed by Villalpando's company, CII, as manager of its Washington office.Ronald J. Ostrow and Ray Delgado, \\"Former Treasurer Guilty of Tax Evasion...,\\" Los Angeles Times (February 18, 1994). On April 4, 1989, President Bush nominated Villalpando to be U.S. Treasurer. She was confirmed by the U. S. Senate on November 20. U.S. Treasurer Villalpando was sworn in by the president on December 11. In attendance at her ceremony was Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Gustavo Petricioli, Mexico's ambassador to the United States. As U.S. Treasurer, Villalpando became the highest-ranking Latina in the Bush Administration exhibiting a high-profile presence in the Hispanic community on its behalf. While Treasurer, Villalpando presided over the first major change in US currency since the motto \\"In God We Trust\\" was introduced in 1957. Beginning in September, 1991, $10, $20, $50 and $100 bills with new, advanced technology designed to defeat digital printers was introduced into public circulation.Andrew Erdman, \\"New Bills,\\" Fortune Magazine (September 9, 1991). Via CNNMoney.com. The same year, Villalpando initiated a special program to raise $37 million by selling commemorative coins honoring Mount Rushmore. Half of the money raised would go toward restoration of the monument ‚Äì the cost of which was estimated at $40 million ‚Äì and half to pay into the national debt.\\"Restoring Mt.

The comments concerned ongoing sex scandals and rumors surrounding Arkansas Governor and Democratic presidential nominee Bill Clinton and former San Antonio mayor Henry Cisneros. Visiting the New Jersey delegation at the 1992 Republican National Convention, Villalpando reportedly said to the delegates: \\"Can you imagine two skirt-chasers campaigning together?\\" She also questioned Clinton's qualifications under these circumstances. Some members of the delegation were not pleased with the comments, in particular former New Jersey Governor Tom Kean, who called the remarks \\"totally unnecessary.\\" Although both Bush and Villalpando issued apologies, Clinton campaign spokesman George Stephanopoulos called on the president to dismiss both officials.Gwen Ifill, \\"The 1992 Campaign: The Democrats; Clinton Team Challenges G.O.P. In Effort to 'Set Record Straight',\\" The New York Times (August 18, 1992).David Maraniss, \\"Bush Called on 'Sleaze' Vow After GOP Remarks,\\" The Washington Post (August 18, 1992). Tax/CII scandal =Investigation= While still enveloped in the controversy surrounding her Clinton and Cisneros comments, Villalpando became the central figure in a criminal probe launched by the Department of Justice. The investigation initially focused on allegations that Villalpando accepted favors and other gratuities from CII while in office ‚Äì a violation of federal law. However, it also incorporated an array of potential charges including \\"bribery, conspiracy to defraud the government, making false or fraudulent claims, racketeering, making false statements to federal agents and fraud by wire, radio or television.\\"Ronald J. Ostrow and Eric Harrison, \\"U.S. Treasurer Target of Criminal Probe...,\\" Los Angeles Times (October 30, 1992). News of the investigation broke on October 29, the day after FBI agents raided several buildings and residences in DC, Virginia, and Georgia. Among these were the homes of Villalpando and Olivas as well as the offices of CII in Norcross where boxes of documents were seized.Sharon LaFraniere, \\"FBI Raids U.S. Treasurers Home in Criminal Probe,\\" The Washington Post (October 30, 1992). The Treasury Department immediately placed Villalpando on leave. Olivas, who was already on leave from CII to act as director of Hispanic outreach for the Bush-Quayle re-election team, quit the campaign. Profit was not considered a suspect in the probe, telling reporters instead that investigators told him ‚Äì and presumably other employees ‚Äì that \\"'they...were witnesses' and would be asked to provide information.\\" Records obtained during the investigation revealed that Villalpando received in excess of $147,000 from CII after she assumed her post as U.S. Treasurer in December 1989. They further showed $441,417 in additional bonuses being received in the fall as she was readying her departure from the company. Finally, the records indicated that Villalpando still had between $250,000 and $500,000 in company stock. According to Villalpando's notes, the $147,000 was listed as severance pay; however, no reference was made to it as required in the financial disclosure forms she submitted to the government upon being nominated. She did indicate at her confirmation hearings that she would retain her stock ownership in the company but promised to have no involvement in the firm's business. The following year, she received her severance payment and an additional $7,000 in accrued leave. Investigators were charged with determining whether these payments were expected but simply not reported or received in expectation of gaining influence in obtaining federal contracts. CII, it was revealed, had a large amount of business with the government. Between 1983 and 1992, the telecommunications firm was awarded 56 non-competitive contracts totaling $68.6 million. As recently as the Persian Gulf War, CII had been awarded huge contracts to provide communication networks for U.S. forces in the region as well as to help rebuild Kuwaiti infrastructure after the war. Though placed on leave at the end of October 1992, Villalpando remained in her post until the Clinton Administration was inaugurated in January, 1993. =Conviction= The investigation did not support charges of influence-peddling on Villalpando's part. Instead, the probe began to intersect with another criminal investigation ongoing within the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) over fraud and the improper awarding of federal contracts during the Reagan Administration. In May 1992, Villalpando was ordered to testify before a grand jury as well as produce certain documents related to that case involving HUD official Deborah Gore Dean. Villalpando's own investigation began to turn toward her failure to reveal compensation from CII and failure to pay appropriate taxes. The following year, she was also accused of obstruction of justice by lying to investigators as well as ordering the destruction of subpoenaed documents. At her trial, prosecutors charged Villalpando with three felonies: tax evasion (specifically $47,013 in Federal income taxes), conspiracy to make false statements regarding her finances (namely that she believed she owed less than she did), and obstruction of a grand jury (due to the destruction of officially requested records in the HUD probe). The charges carried a maximum penalty of a $750,000 fine and 15 years imprisonment. Villalpando admitted to concealing \\"substantial funds and benefits\\", received by her from CII, information which was \\"capable of influencing the actions and judgments of those departments and agencies\\" tasked to evaluate her qualification for the post of U.S. Treasurer. She further admitted that the conspiracy to conceal information was begun as early as March 1989, when she first learned that President Bush intended to nominate her for the post. Villalpando also acknowledged that in July 1992, she asked her longtime acquaintance Olivas to destroy documents subpoenaed by the independent counsel in the Dean case. On February 18, 1994, Villalpando pleaded guilty to all three counts and was released pending her sentencing at which time she was expected to cooperate with ongoing probes into CII contracts and HUD in return for consideration. At her sentencing, Villalpando received four months imprisonment, three years of probation (four months of which to be served under house arrest), 200 hours of community service, and a $150 tax evasion fee.Office of Public Affairs, U.S. Department of Justice, \\"Former U.S. Treasurer Sentenced,\\" (press release) DOJ.gov (September 1994).

Keith gasifier system. Santa-Go, Kanagawa Chuo Kotsu Co., Ltd. A wood gas generator is a gasification unit which converts timber or charcoal into wood gas, a syngas consisting of atmospheric nitrogen, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, traces of methane, and other gases, which - after cooling and filtering - can then be used to power an internal combustion engine or for other purposes. Historically wood gas generators were often mounted on vehicles, but present studies and developments concentrate mostly on stationary plants. History =Origins= Adler Diplomat in WW II with wood gas generator Gasification was an important and common technology during the 19th and early 20th century. Town gas produced from coal was widely used, mainly for lighting purposes. When stationary internal combustion engines based on the Otto cycle became available in the 1870s, they began displacing steam engines as prime movers in many works requiring stationary motive power. Adoption accelerated after the Otto engine's patent expired in 1886. The potential and practical applicability of gasification to internal combustion engines were well understood from the earliest days of their development. In 1873, Thaddeus S. C. Lowe developed and patented the water gas process by which large amounts of hydrogen gas could be generated for residential and commercial use in heating and lighting. Unlike the common coal gas, or coke gas which was used in municipal service, this gas provided a more efficient heating fuel. During the late 19th century internal combustion engines were commonly fueled by town gas, and during the early 20th century many stationary engines switched to using producer gas created from coke which was substantially cheaper than town gas which was based on the distillation (pyrolysis) of more expensive coal. Imbert gasifier on a Ford truck converted to a tractor, Per Larssons Antique Tractor Museum, Sweden, 2003 During World War II gasoline was rationed and in short supply. Due to the lack of gasoline from petroleum, older people recalled how to build gasifiers for both wood and coal, and how to convert internal combustion engines to run on gaseous fuel, and wood gas generators were in active production. In Great Britain, France, the United States and Germany, large numbers of such generators were constructed or improvised to convert wood and coal into fuel for vehicles. Commercial generators were in production before and after the war for use in special circumstances or in distressed economies. Some World War II era wood gas generators were of the \\"Imbert\\" downdraft type, designed around 1920 by French inventor Georges Imbert. Germany produced Gazogene units for vehicles including cars, trucks, artillery tractors and even tanks, to preserve the limited supplies of fuel. Even in non-combatant countries, such as Sweden or Brazil, gasogene was popular, as oil became hard to obtain. In Brazil, a racer named Chico Landi won at S√£o Paulo's Interlagos circuit in 1944, driving a wood gas-powered Alfa Romeo. Coal-based town gas production was generally displaced by petroleum-based gas and natural gas. However, Great Britain continued her use of coal-based town gas until the North Sea natural gas discoveries in the 1960s and 1970s. =Post World War II= Saab 99 running on wood gas in Finland. The gas generator is on the trailer. When oil prices rose there was renewed interest in wood gas generators. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) published a book in March 1989 describing how to build a gas generator in an emergency when oil was not available.H. LaFontaine, F. P. Zimmerman (1989) Construction of a Simplified Wood Gas Generator For Fueling Internal Combustion Engines in a Petroleum Emergency, FEMA Publication It described a design called the \\"stratified downdraft gasifier\\" which solves several drawbacks of earlier types. The European Union sponsored a wood gas project in G√ºssing, Austria, starting in 2005. This project was an electric power plant with a wood gas generator and a gas engine to convert the wood gas into 2 MW electric power and 4.5 MW heat. There was also an experimental device to use the Fischer-Tropsch process to convert wood gas to a diesel-like fuel. By October 2005, it was possible to convert 5 kg wood into 1 litre of fuel. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) is also known to have trucks that run off of wood gas generators. The trucks are common outside of Pyongyang and are in rural villages and smaller towns. These trucks are utilized due to sanctions placed on North Korea regarding imports of oil and gas. https://grist.org/article/2011-07-18-north- korea-runs-on-wood-burning-trucks/ https://www.flickr.com/photos/tpeddle/4956353820 https://nautilus.org/napsnet/napsnet-special-reports/sanctions-on-north- korean-oil-imports-impacts-and-efficacy/ http://china- defense.blogspot.com/2013/11/north-koreas-wood-burning-military.html Design Diagram of a gas generator There is a rich literature on gas-works, town-gas, gas-generation, wood-gas, and producer gas, that is now in the public domain due to its age.Literature about the history and manufacture of wood and coal gas generators can be found using online book digitization projects, such as Google Books, and these often have such materials downloadable in full, as they have passed into the public domain due to their age. For example, searching for \\"Producer Gas\\", \\"Gas manufacture and works\\", or \\"Gas Generators\\" on Google Books will yield many complete books on the subject that can sate the appetite of one interested in the history of technology or serve the amateur experimenter well, even dated as they are. Most successful wood gas generators in use in Europe and the United States are some variation of the earlier Imbert design. Wood gas generators often use wood; however, charcoal can also be used as a fuel. It is denser and produces a cleaner gas without the tarry volatiles and excessive water content of wood. The FEMA wood gas generator is (by definition of the FEMA manual) an emergency gasifier. It is designed to be rapidly assembled in a true fuel crisis. This simplified design has distinct benefits over the earlier European units such as easier refueling and construction but is less popular than the earlier Imbert design because of significant new problems, which include a lack of a fixed oxidization zone and allows the oxidization zone to creep to a larger area, causing a drop in temperature; a lower operating temperature leads to tar production and it lacks a true reduction zone further increasing this design's propensity to produce tar. Tar in the wood gas stream is considered a dirty gas and tar will gum up a motor quickly, possibly leading to stuck valves and rings. A new design known as the Keith gasifier improves on the FEMA unit, incorporating extensive heat recovery and eliminating the tar problem. Testing at Auburn University has shown it to be 37% more efficient than running gasoline. This system set the world speed record for biomass powered vehicles and has made several cross country tours. The United Nations produced the FOA 72 documentUnited Nations FOA 72 with details about their wood gas generator design and construction, as does World Bank technical paper 296.World Bank technical paper 296 =Advantages= Wood gas generators have a number of advantages over use of petroleum fuels: *They can be used to run internal combustion engines (or gas turbines, for maximal efficiency) using wood, a renewable resource, and in the absence of petroleum or natural gas, for example, during a fuel shortage. *They have a closed carbon cycle, contribute less to global warming, and are sustainable in nature. *They can be relatively easily fabricated in a crisis using materials on hand. *They are far cleaner burning than a wood fire or a gasoline-powered engine (without emissions controls), producing little, if any soot. *When used in a stationary design, they reach their true potential, as they are feasible to use in small combined heat and power scenarios (with heat recovery from the wood gas producer, and possibly the engine/generator, for example, to heat water for hydronic heating), even in industrialized countries, even during good economic times, provided that a sufficient supply of wood is attainable. Larger-scale installations can reap even better efficiencies, and are useful for district heating as well. =Disadvantages= The disadvantages of wood gas generators are: *the large specific size *the relatively slow starting speed; the time to heat the initially cold batch of wood to the necessary temperature level can take many minutes and in bigger plants even hours until the designed power is reached. *a batch burning operation, that some designs feature, and that regularly interrupts the gas producing process. *the stop operation out of a high load level is difficult (for example the stop of the engine using the gas): the residual heat still produces gas, which for a certain time leaves the gasifier either without control, or has to be used in a burner *the primary combustible fuel-gas produced during gasification is carbon monoxide: it is an intentional fuel-product, and is subsequently burned to safe carbon dioxide in the engine (or other application) along with the other fuel-gases; however, continuous exposure to carbon monoxide can be fatal to humans even in small to moderate concentrations. *the humidity of the wood (usually 15 to 20%) and the water vapor created by the O- and H-atoms of the dry wood itself (about 0.4 liters of water loaded with organic substances per kg of dry wood) condenses during the gas cooling and filtering procedure and yields a liquid (see also wood tar), which needs specific waste water treatment. This treatment requires about 25 to 35% of the created wood gas energy. =Safety consideration= When not carefully designed and used, there exists considerable potential for injury or death due to wood gas containing a large percentage of poisonous carbon monoxide (CO) gas. Wood gasifiers of proven design and thoroughly tested construction are considered safe to use outdoors, or in a partially enclosed space, for example, under a shelter open to the air on two sides; they may also be considered relatively safe to use in an extremely well ventilated (e.g. negative pressure) indoor area not connected to any indoor area used for sleeping, equipped with redundant (more than 1), completely independent, battery-powered, regularly tested carbon-monoxide gas detectors. However, prudence must dictate that any sort of experimental wood gasifier design or new construction be thoroughly tested outdoors, and only outdoors, with a \\"buddy\\" at all times, and with constant vigilance for any sign of headache, drowsiness, or nausea, as these are the first symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning. In addition, mixtures of excessive quantities of air and gas should be avoided as this could lead to the deflagration (explosion) of the gas in question if a combustion source is present. Long- term storage of wood-gas, except through the use of a gasholder-type water- displacement apparatus, should not be attempted, due to the volatile elements present in the gas, which, if allowed to excessively precipitate, will condense in the storage vessel. Under no circumstances should wood-gas ever be compressed to more than above ambient, as this may induce condensation of volatiles, as well as lead to the likelihood of severe injury or death due to carbon monoxide or deflagration if the vessel leaks or fails. Media coverage In 2008, an example of designing and constructing a working wood gas generator powered truck was shown on the National Geographic Channel's Planet Mechanics in the eighth episode, \\"Tree Powered Car\\". Google search In 2009, another example of designing and constructing a working wood gas powered generator engine was in the TV series The Colony in the second episode of the first season \\"Power Struggle\\". Also used in the tenth episode \\"Exodus\\" to power an escape vehicle. This truck set the land speed record for biomass powered vehicles in September 2011 A 2010 Mother Earth News article discussed and showed pictures of a wood gas powered engine installed in a pickup truck. As part of the BBC science series \\"Bang Goes The Theory\\", a Volkswagen Scirocco was converted to a design by Martin Bacon to run on used coffee grounds, and after its build in 2010 was driven solely on coffee from London to Manchester successfully. Part of the team are now working on a more advanced design leaning towards top speed as opposed to range. On September 14, 2011, at the Bonneville Salt Flats a truck modified with a wood gas powered engine set a new world speed record for vehicles powered by wood gas with a speed of 73 mph. On the popular US radio program Car Talk, a caller in episode 1201 (which aired on January 7, 2012, and was subsequently named \\"20 Miles Per Woodchip\\"), described a wood gas generating vehicle he rode in as a boy during World War II in Germany. The hosts were not familiar with the technology, likely because it was never widely adopted in the US. On March 12, 2012, on a season 2 episode of Doomsday Preppers, a wood gas generator is shown running a Ford truck and a house electric generator by prepper Scott Hunt on his multi-acre woodland property in South Carolina. Serbian TV sitcom \\"Truckdrivers 2\\" (=\\"Kamiondzije II\\") from 1983. talks, as a part of plot, about a gas generator affixed to a chassis of a lorry. An article appeared in Mother Earth News in April 2012 featuring the Keith gasifier, showing pictures and talking with inventor Wayne Keith. In the BBC documentary Wartime Farm, Episode 5 (aired October 2012) they built a coal gas powered ambulance according to the specifications of a 1943 gas powered vehicle.

Via Krupp on Capri Friedrich Alfred Krupp (17 February 1854 ‚Äì 22 November 1902) was a German steel manufacturer and head of the company Krupp. He was the son of Alfred Krupp and inherited the family business when his father died in 1887. Whereas his father had largely supplied iron and steel, Friedrich shifted his company's production back to arms manufacturing. Friedrich greatly expanded Krupp and acquired the Germaniawerft in 1896 which gave him control of warship manufacturing in Germany. He oversaw the development of nickel steel, U-boats, the diesel engine, and much more. He is suspected of committing suicide in 1902 after being accused of homosexuality. His daughter Bertha inherited the company.  Biography  Krupp was born in Essen, Germany. His father was Alfred Krupp, who turned the small local ironworks of Krupp into one of the most powerful companies in the world. In 1887, Friedrich took over the leadership of his father's company. He married Baroness Margarethe von Ende. They had two daughters: Bertha and Barbara (married Tilo, Baron von Wilmowsky). Whereas his father had largely supplied iron and steel for railroads in America, with the rise of Carnegie Steel, Friedrich shifted his company's production back to arms manufacturing. During his time in charge, he greatly expanded Krupp, acquiring Germaniawerf in 1896 which gave him control of warship manufacturing in Germany. He oversaw the development of nickel steel, U-boats, y 1966., the diesel engine, and much more. In 1902 he died, apparently by suicide. His daughter Bertha inherited the company and shortly thereafter married Gustav Halbach, the grandson of Henry Bohlen. Krupp increased and diversified the output of the Krupp Works, which he extended by the incorporation with them of other enterprises. A member of the House of Lords of Prussia and Council of State, he also sat in Germany's Reichstag from 1893 to 1898. For four years, beginning in 1898, Krupp spent several months of the year on the Italian island of Capri, staying at the hotel Quisisana.He kept two yachts there, Maya and Puritan. His hobby was oceanography. He met Felix Anton Dohrn and Ignazio Cerio on Capri.  Scandal and death  On 15 November 1902, the Social Democratic magazine Vorw√§rts claimed that Friedrich Alfred Krupp was homosexual,Bernd-Ulrich Hergem√∂ller, Mann f√ºr Mann, page 449 that he had a number of liaisons with boys and men on Capri, and that his closest attachment was to Adolfo Schiano, an 18-year-old barber and amateur musician. This report appeared in the German press months after stories of an unnamed foreign businessman's homosexual orgies were printed in local and Neapolitan papers demanding an inquest. Capri locals were aware of Krupp's homosexual activities, but those in positions of power turned a blind eye, including the owner of Quisisana who had a certain influence over a local political party, to which Krupp contributed funds. The Neopolitan paper Il Mattino was the first to publish an article, while withholding Krupp's name. Its source in Capri was a teacher who resented Krupp's choice of a different Italian language instructor. This teacher had also been heavily criticized by the same political party that had the support and patronage of Krupp, causing the teacher to support the opposing political party. Krupp returned to Germany, waiting for the scandal to pass. Instead, Italian newspapers continued to identify a wealthy foreign capitalist as the center of homosexual activity. The first report in Germany appeared in the Catholic newspaper ' in August 1902. It cited reports in two Italian newspapers and like them described but did not name the industrialist. In October 1902, Krupp's wife Margarethe von Ende received anonymous letters and, according to some reports, compromising photos of her husband's orgies. She asked Kaiser Wilhelm II, a family friend, to take action against her husband for the sake of the reputation of the firm. The Kaiser, alarmed by her boldness and determined to protect the reputation of that crucial armaments manufacturer, had her locked in an insane asylum. The newspaper Vorw√§rts then published their article titled \\"Krupp in Capri\\", stating: \\"If Krupp continues to live in Germany, he will be subject to penalties under Article 175 of the Code. When certain illegal practices lead to a public scandal, the police have a duty to promote legal action.\\" Under Article 175 of the German Penal Code, homosexual acts were punishable by years of hard labor. Krupp sued the newspaper and sought help from his allies in government, including Kaiser Wilhelm. Copies of Vorw√§rts were seized and destroyed, even in the homes of subscribers. It seemed that Krupp had decided to give battle. However, by now his nerves were shot, perhaps because of the suspicion that this time the scandal was so big and well-grounded that even his wealth and his friendships couldn't save him if due process occurred. A week after Vorw√§rts published the allegations against Krupp, on 22 November 1902, Krupp died. It is uncertain whether he committed suicide or died of illness.Michael Epkenhans, Ralf Stremmel: Friedrich Alfred Krupp. Ein Unternehmer im Kaiserreich.

The 113 distinct bands for are due to the closeness of its value to the rational number 355/113. Similarly, the 7 distinct groups are due to being approximately 22/7. [ (click for detailed view)] In mathematics, the equidistribution theorem is the statement that the sequence :a, 2a, 3a, ... mod 1 is uniformly distributed on the circle \\\\mathbb{R}/\\\\mathbb{Z}, when a is an irrational number. It is a special case of the ergodic theorem where one takes the normalized angle measure \\\\mu=\\\\frac{d\\\\theta}{2\\\\pi}. History While this theorem was proved in 1909 and 1910 separately by Hermann Weyl, Wac≈Çaw Sierpi≈Ñski and Piers Bohl, variants of this theorem continue to be studied to this day. In 1916, Weyl proved that the sequence a, 22a, 32a, ... mod 1 is uniformly distributed on the unit interval. In 1935, Ivan Vinogradov proved that the sequence pn a mod 1 is uniformly distributed, where pn is the nth prime. Vinogradov's proof was a byproduct of the odd Goldbach conjecture, that every sufficiently large odd number is the sum of three primes. George Birkhoff, in 1931, and Aleksandr Khinchin, in 1933, proved that the generalization x + na, for almost all x, is equidistributed on any Lebesgue measurable subset of the unit interval. The corresponding generalizations for the Weyl and Vinogradov results were proven by Jean Bourgain in 1988. Specifically, Khinchin showed that the identity :\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{k=1}^n f( (x+ka) \\\\bmod 1 ) = \\\\int_0^1 f(y)\\\\,dy holds for almost all x and any Lebesgue integrable function ∆í. In modern formulations, it is asked under what conditions the identity :\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{k=1}^n f( (x+b_ka) \\\\bmod 1 ) = \\\\int_0^1 f(y)\\\\,dy might hold, given some general sequence bk. One noteworthy result is that the sequence 2ka mod 1 is uniformly distributed for almost all, but not all, irrational a. Similarly, for the sequence bk = 2ka, for every irrational a, and almost all x, there exists a function ∆í for which the sum diverges. In this sense, this sequence is considered to be a universally bad averaging sequence, as opposed to bk = k, which is termed a universally good averaging sequence, because it does not have the latter shortcoming. A powerful general result is Weyl's criterion, which shows that equidistribution is equivalent to having a non-trivial estimate for the exponential sums formed with the sequence as exponents. For the case of multiples of a, Weyl's criterion reduces the problem to summing finite geometric series.

Raised in Fullerton, California, Brian's family moved to the town of Glen Ellyn, Illinois in 1980. He has played drums for a few Chicago area bands (in order): Eye's On Troy, Political Justice?, Denied Remarks (as a second drummer), God's Acre, My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult, Rights Of The Accused (also known as: ROTA, the entire band sang back up vocals on a 1000 Homo Djs record), and Triple Fast Action. Brian moved to NYC in 1998 after Triple Fast Action broke up. After Political Justice? broke up St. Clair played with a few bands before landing the roll of drummer in one of Chicago's most famous punk bands Rights Of The Accused. In 1988 ROTA were taken on tour with Ministry (band) and became close friends with Al Jourgensen who took them into the studio to sing back up vocals on the 1000 Homo DJs record and put the band in his video for the song Stigmata from the album The Land of Rape and Honey where St. Clair played drums, Herb played bass, Wes played guitar, and Mike jumped around and yelled. However it is very hard to see anyone other than Mike due to all of the fog produced by the fog machine on the set. Also while in ROTA Brian was cast by Cynthia Plaster Caster, one of the Plaster Casters Of Chicago. Kidd and St. Clair formed Triple Fast Action who released several singles on indie labels and a full CD on Capitol Records and one on Deep Elm records before Brian left the band to pursue other interests. In 1999 St. Clair joined Local H with Scott Lucas. Just prior to Local H he was the drum tech for Bun E. Carlos of Cheap Trick, and was credited on Cheap Trick's Silver DVD. Brian has been the tour manager for Liz Phair, Brazilian Girls, Micki Free, Triple Fast Action, and Local H. He has also been dubbed one of the \\"hardest working drummers\\" in rock history. St. Clair's hobbies include birdwatching, in which he has seen 550 of the some 810 species in The USA. He was featured in a famous birdwatching book called \\"Red-Tails in Love\\" (Random House, 1998) by Marie Winn. In 1998 Brian St. Clair auditioned for the world famous \\"Blue Man Group\\" and was told to start taking acting classes so he could join in the future, he took three months of classes at T. Schriber acting school then got too busy with Cheap Trick to continue. Aside from Local H, St. Clair works for three other bands: Cheap Trick, Brazilian Girls, and Micki Free, where he works behind the scenes in Tour Management and production. In December 2011 St. Clair signed a drum endorsement deal with Taye Drums. On August 21, 2013 he announced that he would be departing from Local H after a farewell tour to focus on his tour management company. In May 2014 he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. As of April 2015, St. Clair is on indefinite hormonal therapy.

He is a former member of the Legislative Assembly in British Columbia. During his political career he was briefly the leader of the British Columbia Social Credit Party and the Reform Party of British Columbia. After leaving politics, he was appointed to the board of BC Hydro in 2001, and serves as a member of the British Columbia Treaty Commission.  Political career  Weisgerber was first elected to the British Columbia legislature in 1986 as a Social Credit Party of British Columbia candidate for Peace River South. He served in the Social Credit government in several posts including Minister of State for the Northeast and Nechako, Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources, and as British Columbia's first Minister of Native Affairs. When Social Credit was soundly defeated in the 1991 election, Weisgerber was one of only seven Socred candidates to win re-election. Weisgerber became interim leader of the party. In 1994, after failed attempts to revive the party, Weisgerber became one of four Social Credit members of the legislature to switch allegiances, joining the fledgling Reform Party of British Columbia. BC Reform, as it was known, espoused similar policies to the Reform Party of Canada, but was a separate entity. Weisgerber ran for the BC Reform leadership and was elected party leader in late 1994. Through 1995 and in the months before the 1996 election, Weisgerber faced challenges by some members of his party from southern Vancouver Island. In the May 1996 election, the BC Reform Party won nine percent of the popular vote and two seats in the legislature, one of which was Weisgerber's in Peace River South. However, the party failed to win the four seats required for official party status in the British Columbia legislature. A split in the centre-right vote between Weisgerber's BC Reform Party and Gordon Campbell's Liberals is cited as a factor for the New Democratic Party winning the 1996 BC election. Weisgerber resigned as BC Reform's leader in late 1996, and was replaced by Wilf Hanni in September 1997. Following a bruising round of party in-fighting, Weisgerber left Reform to sit as an independent member of the BC legislature. Weisgerber served out his third and final term in the BC legislature ending in 2001. He was the last surviving member of what proved to be the last Socred government. Shortly before the 2001 election, Weisgerber endorsed the British Columbia Liberal Party and its leader, Gordon Campbell. After winning the election, Campbell appointed Weisgerber as a director of BC Hydro, beginning on September 25, 2001. He served in that position until July 19, 2017, when the BC Liberals lost power. He is a Commissioner of the British Columbia Treaty Commission.  Personal life  Jack is married to Judith Weisgerber (born Janke) to which they have two daughters; Joanne Wooldridge (born Weisgerber) and Pamela Haglof (born Weisgerber); and three grandsons Josh, Luke, and Cole and one granddaughter Jemma. He currently resides in Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada.

(1992). Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style (3rd ed.). Woodstock, New York: The Overlook Press. thriller film directed by John Dahl and starring Nicolas Cage, Lara Flynn Boyle, J. T. Walsh and Dennis Hopper. It was written by Dahl and his brother Rick, and shot in Montana and Willcox, Arizona. The film was well received at the prestigious Toronto International Film Festival, but deemed a cable and direct-to-video product by Columbia TriStar Home Video, which owned the North American rights. When Bill Banning, the owner of a San Francisco movie theater and a huge fan of the film, arranged for a theatrical release, the film gained a \\"buzz\\" and toured the U.S. as an art-house hit. Plot Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage) is a drifter living out of his car after being discharged from the Marine Corps. A job on an oilfield falls through due to his unwillingness to conceal a war injury on his job application, so Michael wanders into rural Red Rock, Wyoming, looking for other work. A local bar owner named Wayne (J. T. Walsh) mistakes him for a hit man, \\"Lyle from Dallas\\", whom Wayne has hired to kill his wife. Wayne offers him a stack of cash‚Äî\\"half now, half later\\"‚Äîand Michael plays along by taking the money. Michael visits Wayne's wife, Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle) and attempts to warn her that her life is in danger instead of killing her. She offers him more money to kill Wayne. Michael tries to leave town but a car accident leads him to encounter the local sheriff, who turns out to be Wayne. Michael manages to escape from Wayne but runs into the real Lyle from Dallas (Dennis Hopper). Lyle and Wayne quickly figure out what has transpired, while Michael desperately tries to warn Suzanne before Lyle finds her. The next morning, when Lyle comes to get money from Wayne, he kidnaps both Suzanne and Michael, who are trying to retrieve hidden cash from Wayne's office. Wayne and Suzanne are revealed to be wanted for embezzlement and Wayne is arrested by his own deputies. Lyle returns with Michael and Suzanne hostage and gets Wayne out of jail to retrieve their stash of money. At a remote graveyard, Wayne pulls a gun from the case of money and holds Lyle at gunpoint before Lyle throws a knife into Wayne's neck. Michael and Lyle fight, with Lyle ending up being impaled on a grave marker. When Lyle rises to attack Michael, Suzanne shoots him dead. Michael and Suzanne escape onto a nearby train, but when Suzanne tries to betray Michael, he throws the money out of the speeding train and then throws Suzanne off to be arrested by the police accompanied by a wounded Wayne. Michael's train continues its journey into a new town. Cast * Nicolas Cage as Michael Williams * Dennis Hopper as Lyle from Dallas * Lara Flynn Boyle as Suzanne Brown/Ann McCord * J. T.

The domestic rights were sold to Columbia Tri-Star home video for $2.5 million and the foreign rights to Manifesto Films, a subsidiary of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment. Release Test screenings for the film were not strong and Peter Graves, an independent consultant who headed the marketing department at Polygram said, \\"The film doesn't fall neatly into any marketable category. A western film noir isn't something people can immediately spark to\\". One of the producers suggested early on that the film be submitted to the Sundance Film Festival and was told by the studio that it wasn't a festival film. Columbia sold Red Rock West to cable and it was shown seven times on HBO in the fall of 1993. The film opened successfully in theaters in Germany, Paris, and London in the summer of 1993. Piers Handling, director of the Toronto International Film Festival saw the film in Paris and decided to show it at the festival in September. Bill Banning, who owned the Roxie Cinema and Roxie Releasing in San Francisco saw Red Rock West in Toronto and thought that there might be an American theatrical audience for the film. It took him until January 1994 to find out who owned the rights. The film had already played on HBO and was due to come out on video in February. Banning started showing Red Rock West at the Roxie Cinema on January 28, 1994 where it broke box office records before expanding to eight theaters in the city. It then opened in Los Angeles and New York City. Reception In his review for The Washington Post, Richard Harrington praised it as \\"a treasure waiting to be discovered\\". Writing in The New York Times, Caryn James called it \\"a terrifically enjoyable, smartly acted, over- the-top thriller\\". Roger Ebert praised it as \\"a diabolical movie that exists sneakily between a western and a thriller, between a film noir and a black comedy,\\" and gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four. The film has a score of 95% \\"Fresh\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes indicating general critical acclaim.

It closed in January 2016 due to insolvency.  History  The museum was an independent, volunteer-led project to provide a permanent archive of the local mining history and community resource within the remaining winding engine house, which is now a scheduled ancient monument. One of the two massive steam winding engines had been returned to working order, and many artifacts were on permanent display to help describe the life of the local miners and the social history of the area. Coal mining in Whitehaven dates back to the 13th century when the monks from St Bees Abbey supervised the opening of coal mines at Arrowthwaite. This long history ended abruptly in March 1986, when Haig Colliery, Cumbria's last deep coal mine, finally closed. During this time, the gassy nature of the mines caused many violent explosions. Over 1200 men, women, and children were killed in the Whitehaven pits while mining coal in workings up to four miles out beneath the Solway Firth. Haig itself had a terrible record of methane explosions in the 1920s. Fourteen miners are still entombed in the workings to this day. = Building = The mine was a large building that dominated the Kells Industrial Estate, with tall chimneys, working lifts and conveyor belts to transport the coal. = Transportation of coal = The footpath behind the building is called 'The Wagon Road' because in the 1800s when the coal industry was at its peak in the North West of England, the coal wagons used to go down the wagon road to get to the train track to then transport the coal into the town centre where it would be distributed to the train track or the Whitehaven harbour, one of Britain's main ports at the time. =Closure= The museum closed for repairs in 2014, and after a 2.4 million refurbishment, reopened to the public in February 2015. Even though the museum attracted in excess of its anticipated 15,000 visitor numbers, financial problems meant that by January 2016 the museum had closed. Some of the buildings are being used by West Cumbria Mining as its main operating base whilst it test drills for coal off the Cumbrian coast.

Legislation is democratically opened to the general citizenry, employing their collective wisdom to benefit the decision-making process and improve democracy.Open- source democracy: how online communication is changing offline politics by Douglas Rushkoff, published by Demos. Page 56 et al Theories on how to constrain, limit or enable this participation vary. Accordingly, there is no one dominant theory of how to go about authoring legislation with this approach. There are a wide array of projects and movements which are working on building open-source governance systems. Many left-libertarian and radical centrist organizations around the globe have begun advocating open-source governance and its related political ideas as a reformist alternative to current governance systems. Often, these groups have their origins in decentralized structures such as the Internet and place particular importance on the need for anonymity to protect an individual's right to free speech in democratic systems. Opinions vary, however, not least because the principles behind open-source government are still very loosely defined.  Applications of the principles  In practice, several applications have evolved and been used by democratic institutions :Service-oriented architecture governance for the services driven enterprise; Eric A. Marks *Open-government mechanisms including those for public participation and engagement, such as the use of IdeaScale, Google Moderator, Semantic MediaWiki, GitHub, and other software by actual ruling governments ‚Äì these mechanisms are well-developed, especially in the UK and the US,Knowledge governance: processes and perspectives; Snejina Michailova, Nicolai J. Foss, Oxford University Press. Page 241 et al or by civil society and citizens directly for example, Opengovpioneers in the UK. *Open-politics forums and wikis, where political issues and arguments can be debated, either within or between political party constraints, taking three distinct forms: **Political-party-platform development, in which ideas are solicited from anyone or almost anyone and openly discussed to a point but the ranking and devotion of resources to developing ideas is reserved to party members or supporters. A variant is the non-partisan think-tank or citizen- advocacy group-platform development as has become common in Canada, for example the Dominion Institute policywiki. As one experiment ends, a new one begins for Policy Wiki The Globe and Mail / Dominion Institute policywiki **Citizen journalism forums obeying stricter rules to ensure equal power relationships than is typically the case in blogs, strictly designed to balance libel and free speech laws for a local jurisdiction (following laws strictly is part of the open politics ideal). **Open party mechanisms to actually govern and operate formal political parties without the usual insider politics and interest groups that historically have taken over such parties; these experiments have been limited and typically take the form of parties run by referenda or online. An example of this is Italy's Five Star Movement. *In the California Assembly, Crowdsourced legislation via a 'wiki bills' website is being initiated via an online wiki, with an introduction deadline of early February, 2015.(Jan 8, 2015) \\"Gatto Promotes 'Wiki Bill' project\\" Crescenta Valley Weekly 6(19) p.1,8 accessdate=2015-01-14 *Hybrid mechanisms which attempt to provide journalistic coverage, political platform development, political transparency, strategic advice, and critique of a ruling government of the same party all at the same time. Dkosopedia is the best known example of this. Some models are significantly more sophisticated than a plain wiki, incorporating semantic tags, levels of control or scoring to mediate disputes ‚Äì however this always risks empowering a clique of moderators more than would be the case given their trust position within the democratic entity ‚Äì a parallel to the common wiki problem of official vandalism by persons entrusted with power by owners or publishers (so-called \\"sysop vandalism\\" or \\"administrative censorship\\").  Common and simultaneous policy  Some advocates of these approaches, by analogy to software code, argue for a \\"central codebase\\" in the form of a set of policies that are maintained in a public registry and that are infinitely reproducible. \\"Distributions\\" of this policy-base are released (periodically or dynamically) for use in localities, which can apply \\"patches\\" to customize them for their own use. Localities are also able to cease subscribing to the central policy-base and \\"fork\\" it or adopt someone else's policy-base. In effect, the government stems from emergent cooperation and self-correction among members of a community. As the policies are put into practice in a number of localities, problems and issues are identified and solved, and where appropriate communicated back to the core. These goals for instance were cited often during the Green Party of Canada's experiments with open-political-platform development. As one of over a hundred national Green party entities worldwide and the ability to co- ordinate policy among provincial and municipal equivalents within Canada, it was in a good position to maintain just such a central repository of policy, despite being legally separate from those other entities.  Difference from prior initiatives  Open-source governance differs from previous open- government initiatives in its broader emphasis on collaborative processes. History The \\"Imagine Halifax\\" (IH) project was designed to create a citizens' forum for elections in Halifax, Nova Scotia in fall 2004. Founded by Angela Bischoff, the widow of Tooker Gomberg, a notable advocate of combining direct action with open politics methods, IH brought a few dozen activists together to compile a platform (using live meetings and email and seedwiki followup). When it became clear that candidates could not all endorse all elements of the platform, it was then turned into questions for candidates in the election. The best ideas from candidates were combined with the best from activists ‚Äì the final scores reflected a combination of convergence and originality. In contrast to most such questionnaires, it was easier for candidates to excel by contributing original thought than by simply agreeing. One high scorer, Andrew Younger, had not been involved with the project originally but was elected and appeared on TV with project leader Martin Willison. The project had not only changed its original goal from a partisan platform to a citizen questionnaire, but it had recruited a previously uninvolved candidate to its cause during the election. A key output of this effort was a glossary of about 100 keywords relevant to municipal laws. The 2004‚Äì05 Green Party of Canada Living Platform was a much more planned and designed effort at open politics. As it prepared itself for an electoral breakthrough in the 2004 federal election, the Green Party of Canada began to compile citizen, member and expert opinions in preparation of its platform. During the election, it gathered input even from Internet trolls including supporters of other parties, with no major problems: anonymity was respected and, if they were within the terms of use, comments remained intact. Despite, or perhaps because of, its early success, it was derailed by Jim Harris, the party's leader, when he discovered that it was a threat to his status as a party boss. The Living Platform split off as another service entirely out of GPC control and eventually evolved into OpenPolitics.caDecision Making Handout and a service to promote wiki usage among citizens and political groups. The Liberal Party of Canada also attempted a deep policy renewal effort in conjunction with its leadership race in 2006. While candidates in that race, notably Carolyn Bennett, St√©phane Dion and Michael Ignatieff, all made efforts to facilitate web-threaded policy-driven conversations between supporters, all failed to create lateral relationships and thus also failed to contribute much to the policy renewal effort. Numerous very different projects related to open-source governance collaborate under the umbrella of the Metagovernment project; Metagovernment uses the term \\"collaborative governance\\", most of which are building platforms of open-source governance. :Aktivdemokrati is a Direct democratic party, running for the parliament of SwedenAktivdemokrati (Swedish) Democracylab.org is a Seattle Washington nonprofit (501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, partnered with the Oregon 150 Project, building an online public think tank in which the votes of users determines policy, seeking to connect the values people hold to their positions on issues and the policies they advocate. Votorola is software for building consensus and reaching decisions on local, national and global levels. The White House 2 was a project which crowdsourced the U.S. agenda, \\"imagining how the White House might work if it was run completely democratically by thousands of people on the internet.\\" Wikicracy has developed a Mediawiki-based platform using most of Open politics criteria These grassroots efforts have been matched by government initiatives that seek similar goals. A more extensive list of these and similar organizations is available externally. Future Melbourne is a wiki- based collaborative environment for developing Melbourne's 10-year plan. During public consultation periods, it enables the public to edit the plan with the same editing rights as city personnel and councilors. The New Zealand Police Act Review was a wiki used to solicit public commentary during the public consultation period of the acts review.New Zealand Police Act Review At linux.conf.au on January 14, 2015 in Auckland, New Zealand, Australian Audrey Lobo-Pulo presented Evaluating Government Policies Using Open Source Models, agitating for government policy related knowledge, data and analysis to be freely available to everyone to use, modify and distribute without restriction \\"a parallel universe where public policy development and analysis is a dynamic, collaborative effort between government and its citizens\\". Audrey reported that the motivation for her work was personal uncertainty about the nature and accuracy of models, estimates and assumptions used to prepare policies released with the 2014 Australian Federal Government Budget, and whether and to what extent their real world impact is assessed following implementation. A white paper on \\"Evaluating Government Policies using Open Source Models\\" was released on September 10, 2015.  Open politics as a distinct theory  The open-politics theory, a narrow application of open- source governance, combines aspects of the free software and open-content movements, promoting decision-making methods claimed to be more open, less antagonistic, and more capable of determining what is in the public interest with respect to public policy issues. It takes special care for instance to deal with equity differences, geographic constraints, defamation versus free political speech, accountability to persons affected by decisions, and the actual standing law and institutions of a jurisdiction. There is also far more focus on compiling actual positions taken by real entities than developing theoretical \\"best\\" answers or \\"solutions\\". One example, DiscourseDB, simply lists articles pro and con a given position without organizing their argument or evidence in any way. While some interpret it as an example of \\"open-source politics\\", open politics is not a top‚Äìdown theory but a set of best practices from citizen journalism, participatory democracy and deliberative democracy, informed by e-democracy and netroots experiments, applying argumentation framework for issue-based argument as they evolved in academic and military use through the 1980s to present. Some variants of it draw on the theory of scientific method and market methods, including prediction markets and anticipatory democracy. Its advocates often engage in legal lobbying and advocacy to directly change laws in the way of the broader application of the technology, e.g. opposing political libel cases in Canada, fighting libel chill generally, and calling for clarification of privacy and human rights law especially as they relate to citizen journalism. They are less focused on tools although the semantic mediawiki and tikiwiki platforms seem to be generally favored above all others.

Activities The main task of the Daughters of Liberty was to protest the Stamp Act and Townshend Acts through aiding the Sons of Liberty in boycotts and non-importation movements prior to the outbreak of the Revolutionary War. The Daughters of Liberty participated in spinning bees, helping to produce homespun cloth for colonists to wear instead of British textiles. Women were also used as the enforcers of these movements because they were the ones responsible for purchasing goods for their households. They saw it as their duty to make sure that fellow Patriots were staying true to their word about boycotting British goods. The Daughters of Liberty are also well known for their boycott of British tea after the Tea Act was passed and the British East India Company was given a virtual monopoly on colonial tea. They began drinking what was later known as \\"liberty tea.\\" Leaves from raspberries or black tea were commonly used as tea substitutes so people could still enjoy tea while refusing to buy goods imported through Britain. Chapters of the Daughters of Liberty throughout the colonies participated in the war effort by melting down metal for bullets and helping to sew soldiers‚Äô uniforms. the famed leader of the Sons of Liberty, Samuel Adams is reported as saying, \\"With ladies on our side, we can make every Tory tremble.\\" Women associated with the Daughters of Liberty * Sarah Bradlee Fulton is most known for her role in the 1773 Boston Tea Party. She is credited with coming up with the idea that Tea Party participants should wear Mohawk disguises to avoid detection from British officials.

Other than her parentage, she is most known for helping to outfit American Soldiers in 1780. * Martha Washington, wife of George Washington and First Lady of the United States, joined General Washington during long winter encampments where she was instrumental in providing as much as she could for soldiers. * Esther de Berdt is best known for creating the Patriot organization, The Ladies of Philadelphia in 1778, which was dedicated to raising money for food and clothing for the Continental Army. Even though she was born in London, she became alienated from Britain by the crown‚Äôs actions toward the colonies and decided to fully support the Patriot cause. She is also the author of \\"Sentiments of an American Woman,\\" an essay that intended to rouse colonial women to join the fight against the British. She was able to use her marriage to Joseph Reed to help her gain more influence and resources. * Deborah Sampson later emerged as a symbol for female involvement in the Revolutionary War. Rather than supporting the war effort from the outside, she dressed as a man and fought in the war under the name Robert Shurtlieff. She fought in 1781 and her future husband was eventually awarded a pension for her service in the war, albeit after his death. * Elizabeth Nichols Dyar mixed and applied paint to the men of the Boston Tea Party.

WRBH (88.3 MHz) is a non- commercial FM radio station in New Orleans, Louisiana. It primarily provides a radio reading service for the blind and print handicapped without the usual use of a private subcarrier decoder, one of only two such stations in the United States. Services include readings of books, original programming and readings of newspapers and magazines, including The Wall Street Journal and The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate, New Orleans' largest daily newspaper. WYPL in Memphis, Tennessee provides similar services. The station also carries Tulane Green Wave sports, including Tulane's women's basketball and baseball The station's owners are Radio For The Blind & Print Handicapped. The station has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 51,000 watts. The transmitter is on Tournefort Street in Chalmette, Louisiana.Radio- Locator.com/WRBH  Founding  WRBH began as the dream of a local mathematician, Dr. Robert McClean. He was blind, but he had a vision: a FM reading radio station, with strong programming content that would improve the lives of blind and visually impaired persons for productive, fulfilling lives. In 1975, McClean began leasing airtime from WWNO and renting studio space from New Orleans‚Äô Lighthouse for the Blind. By 1982, his efforts expanded after purchasing the 88.3 FM wavelength, officially making WRBH the United States‚Äô first 24-hour FM reading radio station for the blind. Today, WRBH remains the USA's only full-time FM reading radio service and is one of only three such stations in the world. In 1994, WRBH purchased a 4,000 square foot, 19th century Victorian building on New Orleans‚Äô Magazine Street, a major thoroughfare. This building has been the home of WRBH's recording studio and administrative space ever since. In 2000, WRBH added its programming to the internet via live audio streaming and podcasts. In 2014, WRBH partnered with HEROfarm, a New Orleans-based marketing and public relations firm, to redesign its website, making it fully compatible with screen reading software. Now the station impacts the lives of the visually impaired not only in the New Orleans region, but also all over the world through its online streaming capabilities.  Mission  WRBH's mission is to turn the printed word into the spoken word so that the blind and print handicapped can receive the same ease of access to current information as their sighted peers.  Background  The majority of information in print and on the internet is not easily accessible to those who cannot read. For the blind and print handicapped community, this lack of access to information can increase their sense of isolation, lower their standard of living, and become a serious obstacle in everyday life. WRBH seeks to keep everyone equally informed by providing access to news and information, promoting cultural enrichment, and encouraging mental and emotional independence for those who cannot read. WRBH offers a wide variety of programming including local and national news, best-selling fiction and non- fiction books, magazine articles, children's books, event calendars, interview segments, health programs, cooking shows, and grocery store ads, as well as shows geared toward Spanish, Haitian, and Vietnamese communities. This programming is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year because of over 150 dedicated volunteers who donate nearly 5,000 hours of their time annually. WRBH produces several in-house shows including Charlie's Music Show where host Charles Smith interviews musicians of all genres; Writers Forum, which provides an opportunity for local authors to discuss their work; and New Orleans by Mouth, moderated by Amy Sins.  Audience  WRBH's target audience is all those with difficulty in reading. While the majority of reading services for the blind use mechanized voice software, WRBH is the only organization providing this variety of programming via the human voice through over 150 volunteers. This makes WRBH's programs particularly of interest to the newly blind or those who have experienced vision loss due to age, since it can take several years for the untrained ear to become accustomed to the speed and cadence of the mechanized voice software. In addition, WRBH's content is also of interest to the general public, who tune in to listen to the news, event listings, best-selling fiction and nonfiction books, short stories, magazine articles, and an array of programs encouraging cultural, educational, and emotional enrichment. Since 2000, WRBH has served a world-wide audience by making audio streaming and podcasts available free of charge over the internet. WRBH's terrestrial broadcasting power is 25,000 watts, making the station's FM signal available across a 90-mile radius stretching over Hancock County, Mississippi and the following Louisiana parishes: Orleans, Jefferson, St. Tammany, St. Charles, St. John, Terrebonne, St. Bernard, and Plaquemines.  WRBH and the New Orleans Community  WRBH's goal for the New Orleans community and beyond is to engage, energize, and empower its listeners through access to information and entertainment. WRBH has received several awards including a Proclamation of Recognition for 30 Years of Service from the City of New Orleans in 2012, the 1999 Governor's Media Award, the 1998 Mayor's Medal of Honor, and in 1990 was named the 257th Point of Light by President George Bush, Sr. To further its outreach in the community, the station collaborates with the following organizations that share common goals or serve the blind and print handicapped in other ways: * Lighthouse for the Blind serves the blind and visually impaired community by providing quality products, services, and opportunities for independence. WRBH guest lectures at their classes twice a year, refers listeners to their services, and supports their organization through public service announcements (PSAs). * Blinded Veterans Association promotes the welfare of blinded veterans so that they may take their rightful place in the community and work with their fellow citizens toward the creation of a peaceful world. WRBH participates in their annual expo and supports them through PSAs. * New Orleans Filipino-American Lions Club refurbishes used eyeglasses for the needy. WRBH acts as a drop off spot for used glasses, supports them through PSAs, and allows their directors to meet in WRBH's board room once a month, free of charge. * Entergy: Since 2009, WRBH has partnered with Entergy to broadcast Going Green, which educates listeners on energy efficiency. Entergy underwrites the program, while Entergy and WRBH generate the educational content. * Ben Franklin High School: WRBH partners with Ben Franklin High School during ‚ÄúHogs for the Cause,‚Äù a fundraising festival for families with children being treated for brain cancer. Ben Franklin High School's Student Council Members volunteer to help WRBH in this event. * Young Leadership Council: WRBH partners with the Young Leadership Council (YLC) to broadcast ‚ÄúOne Book One New Orleans.‚Äù YLC spearheads the campaign for literacy, which calls on residents to share the experience of reading the same book each fall. WRBH records and broadcasts an audio recording of the book, read by YLC youth volunteers. * The Big Read, a project of the National Endowment for the Arts, supports community-wide reading programs that encourage reading and participation by diverse audiences. Southern Food and Beverage Museum acts as host, and WRBH records the book and advertises the program.

Niles was one of the creators of the Dragonlance world and the author of the first three Forgotten Realms novels, and the Top Secret S/I espionage role-playing game. Early life and education Niles was born in Brookfield, Wisconsin, a suburb of Milwaukee, and his family moved to Nashotah, a small town to the north, when he was twelve years old. Niles developed an interest in heroic fantasy, as well as wargaming, and began writing short stories and making short films in high school. Niles attended the University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh, where he majored in speech and minored in English. While there, he met Chris Schroeder, whom he married three years later. After graduation, Niles began teaching Speech and English at Clinton (Wis.) High School, about 30 miles away from Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. ‚ÄúOne day, one of my students came up and said she had a note to get out of class that afternoon because she was going to be interviewed by People magazine. Her name was Heidi Gygax. I asked her why People wanted to interview her, and she told me that her father had invented the Dungeons & Dragons game. Well, I had heard of D&D;, but didn‚Äôt know that the designer lived so close to me. The next day, Heidi brought me a copy of the original D&D; Basic Set, and two days later, I got some friends together and played my first game. I was the DM.‚Äù Career A few years later, one of the players in Niles' D&D; campaign went to work for Dragon magazine. According to Niles, ‚ÄúOne day, he told me that TSR was hiring editors, and I applied for a job. I took the editing test, which consisted of a 14 page manuscript I was supposed to mark up. I only found three things to change. . . and flunked the test. But TSR was also hiring game designers, and so, armed with a half-written novel and some notes from my campaign, I applied for a design job. I went through five interviews, and gradually convinced them that I could do the job.‚Äù Niles was hired by TSR in January 1982, as a game designer. ‚ÄúFor the first few weeks I reviewed and critiqued outside submissions, and I wasn‚Äôt too good at it. I kept pestering my boss, Al Hammack, for a design assignment, and finally he gave me an old brief for a novice-level module, Cult of the Reptile God, and told me to write it. I completed it in four weeks, and it was published. I don‚Äôt know whether they liked it because it was good, or because I did it in only four weeks.‚Äù Niles worked on more than just D&D; for TSR, ‚ÄúIn the summer of 1982, I designed my first game, the Knight Hawks rules for the Star Frontiers game, with much help from my editor, Steve Winter.‚Äù Niles produced several modules for the D&D; game, including X3 Curse of Xanathon, B5 Horror on the Hill, CM1 Test of the Warlords, and H1 Bloodstone Pass, and Dragonlance modules DL2 Dragons of Flame, DL6 Dragons of Ice, DL9 Dragons of Deceit, and DL11 Dragons of Glory. Niles is the designer of 1985's World War II: European Theatre of Operations, a grand strategic game. Niles worked on the Battlesystem Supplement, Star Frontiers modules SF4 Mission to Alcazzar and SFKH1 Dramune Run, Indiana Jones module IJ2 Raiders of the Lost Ark, the World War II Game, the Sirocco Strategy Game (with Zeb Cook), and the Endless Quest books EQ #26 Tarzan and the Well of Slaves and Super EQ #3 Escape From Castle Quarras for TSR. Tracy Hickman had gotten Harold Johnson, Jeff Grubb, Carl Smith, and Larry Elmore in on the idea of Dragonlance before Margaret Weis and Niles joined them. Niles authored the rulebook Dungeoneer's Survival Guide (1986). Niles had been working on a trilogy of Celtic-themed novels for TSR, Ltd., which were modified to become the first Forgotten Realms books, beginning with Darkwalker on Moonshae (1987). Niles also co-authored The City of Greyhawk boxed set with Carl Sargent, for which he designed the 96-page booklet Greyhawk: Gem of the Flanaess. Niles and Paul Lidberg designed the board game A Line in the Sand (1991), which depicted the first US-Iraq War; it was one of the projects originating from TSR West, and was published the day the US bombing began thanks to Flint Dille's ability to convince the president of the company to make things move fast. Niles has written numerous novels, mainly for the Dragonlance series. Niles is one of the most prolific Dragonlance authors, and in addition to Wizard's Conclave, his Dragonlance titles include The Icewall Trilogy (The Messenger, The Golden Orb, Winterheim), Emperor of Ansalon, The Dragons, The Puppet King, Fistandantilus Reborn, Flint the King (with Mary Kirchoff), and The Last Thane. He contributed nine novels to the Forgotten Realms line, including the Moonshae trilogy and two further trilogies in the Forgotten Realms. He has won both the H.G. Wells award and the Origins award for his work in developing adventure games. In 1990, he left TSR to write fantasy fiction. Niles has written two World War II alternate history novels, Fox on the Rhine and Fox at the Front (co-authored with Michael Dobson). Released in hardcover by Forge, a division of TOR, \\"Fox\\" has been both a main selection of the Military Book Club and a Featured selection of the Science Fiction Book Club. Niles and Dobson also later wrote the World War II alternate history novel MacArthur's War. Niles has created two fantasy worlds in books published by Ace Fantasy. The Watershed Trilogy (A Breach in the Watershed, Darkenheight, The War of Three Waters) was completed in the late 1990s, and it features a continent divided by mountains into three distinct basins: watersheds of pure, normal water; of magical liquid (Aura); and of vile, poisonous Darkblood. Circle at Center, Worldfall, and The Goddess Worldweaver form the Seven Circles Trilogy, which details a cosmos in which historical characters from Earth can be drawn into the realms of magic, through sorcery both deadly and erotic. Niles has designed dozens of games for TSR, Inc. and SPI, including award-winning boardgames based on Tom Clancy's novels The Hunt for Red October and Red Storm Rising, and has also created numerous historical military boardgames, including the massive games European Theatre of Operations and Pacific Theatre of Operations. Personal life Niles resides in Delavan, in the Wisconsin countryside, with his wife Christine and his son David. His daughter, Allison, served overseas as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. His hobbies include hiking, bicycling, playing the guitar, and spending time with his friends and family.

Having performed together locally in their native Lookout Mountain, Georgia since the 1970s, the four sisters began singing full-time in the 1980s and signed to Warner Records Nashville in 1984. Their greatest commercial success came between then and 1991, when they charted fifteen top-ten hits on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, five of which went to number one: \\"I Fell in Love Again Last Night\\", \\"Just in Case\\", \\"Mama's Never Seen Those Eyes\\", \\"Too Much Is Not Enough\\" (with The Bellamy Brothers), and \\"You Again\\". They won the Academy of Country Music Group of the Year award in 1986 and were nominated three times for a Grammy Award. In addition to their country music albums, the group also released multiple albums of gospel music and one of Christmas music. The group's sound is defined primarily by four-part vocal harmonies and alternating lead vocals, though most often with Kim or Kathy singing lead. Their style has been compared to other contemporary family-based country music groups such as The Judds and The Whites, while critical reception to their body of work has generally been mixed. The sisters retired from the music industry in 1996 and found work in other fields. Early life The Forester Sisters are four sisters who were born and raised in Lookout Mountain, Georgia: Kathy (born January 4, 1955), June (born September 22, 1956), Kim (born November 4, 1960), and Christy (born December 21, 1962). The sisters' parents, Vonnie Geneva (n√©e Gray; 1932‚Äì2018) and Clyde D. \\"Bunk\\" Forester, would encourage the four to rehearse music for church choir every week, something which Christy later observed would help the sisters learn how to sing in harmony. In addition to their church work, Kathy and June performed in local bands during the late 1970s while also holding jobs as schoolteachers. After Christy had finished college, the four sisters decided to begin performing professionally. Songwriters Bobby Keel and Billy Stone discovered them at a local music festival, and invited them to record a demo at a music studio in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. The demo tape was sent to Paige Rowden, the artists and repertoire representative for Warner Bros. Records' Nashville division, who arranged for them to audition at the label after hearing them open for Larry Gatlin. Jim Ed Norman, a record producer who was then also the president of Warner Bros. Nashville, signed the sisters in late 1984. According to Kim, when the sisters were first contacted by the label, she thought that the call was a prank and immediately hung up before the label called a second time. Career The group's debut single \\"(That's What You Do) When You're in Love\\", released in mid-1985, reached a peak of number ten on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts. The song served as the lead single for their self-titled debut album released later that year. Three more singles from the album would reach number one on the same chart by 1986; in order of release, these were \\"I Fell in Love Again Last Night\\", \\"Just in Case\\", and \\"Mama's Never Seen Those Eyes\\". Muscle Shoals-based songwriters Terry Skinner and J. L. Wallace produced the album and co-wrote both \\"When You're in Love\\" and \\"Mama's Never Seen Those Eyes\\"; they wrote the former with Ken Bell, with whom they had previously recorded in the band Bama. \\"Just in Case\\" was written by Exile members J. P. Pennington and Sonny LeMaire, and previously recorded by that band on their 1984 album Kentucky Hearts. Sales figures from Warner Bros. Nashville indicated that more than 100,000 copies of \\"I Fell in Love Again Last Night\\" were sold. Coinciding with the success of this album, the sisters were nominated by the Academy of Country Music for Vocal Group of the Year in both 1985 and 1986, winning the award in the latter year. The album itself was nominated for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 28th Annual Grammy Awards in 1985. Also stemming from the album's commercial success was an extensive touring schedule, consisting of performances with Alabama, George Jones, Ricky Skaggs, and several other country music artists throughout 35 states. An uncredited review in People was mixed, calling their sound \\"heavy on country\\" and stating that the gospel sound of \\"The Missing Part\\" \\"adds a distinct warmth that blends cosily with the quartet's brightness\\". At the time of the album's release, Kathy lived with her husband Terry Adkins, who was also their manager and bass guitarist, while the other three sisters continued to live with their parents. The Forester Sisters recorded two collaborations with The Bellamy Brothers (pictured here in 2013): \\"Too Much Is Not Enough\\" in 1986, and \\"Drive South\\" four years later. The quartet's second album was 1986's Perfume, Ribbons & Pearls. It charted only one single in \\"Lonely Alone\\", which spent two weeks at the number two position on Hot Country Songs that year. Contributing songwriters to the album included Pam Tillis, Bob McDill, and Walt Aldridge. As with the previous album, Skinner and Wallace stayed on as producers. People published a positive review, praising the vocal deliveries of all four sisters while also stating that the album \\"warms the heart while it invigorates the toe\\". Cliff Radel of The Cincinnati Enquirer rated the album 2 out of 5 stars, calling the singing \\"clear as the sky on a crisp fall day\\" but criticizing the \\"poverty stricken songs\\". Montreal Gazette writer Lucinda Chodan contrasted the quartet's sound with that of The Judds, stating that \\"those celestial voices are harmonizing in the service of songs that, for the most part, are about as individual as pennies in a jar.\\" She thought that \\"100% Chance of Blue\\" and the cover of The Supremes' \\"Back in My Arms Again\\" were the most distinct songs, but still criticized the production. After \\"Lonely Alone\\", the Forester Sisters were featured vocalists on The Bellamy Brothers' late-1986 hit \\"Too Much Is Not Enough\\", a number-one single from their album Country Rap. Following this song's success, the two acts toured together the following year on the Brothers and Sisters Tour. =Late 1980s= You Again, the sisters' third album, accounted for three singles upon its 1987 release. First was a cover of Brenda Lee's 1965 hit \\"Too Many Rivers\\", which the Forester Sisters took to top five on the country charts. After it came the title track, which became the sisters' fifth and final number-one hit. The last single was the top-five \\"Lyin' in His Arms Again\\", also written by Skinner and Wallace, who split the album's production duties with Barry Beckett, James Stroud, and Emory Gordy Jr. Also included on the album was \\"Sooner or Later\\", later a top- ten hit in 1990 for Eddy Raven.Whitburn, pp. 293-294 James M. Tarbox of Knight Ridder News Service reviewed the album favorably, considering the album \\"consistent\\" for its lyrical themes of love while also noting that the sound was both \\"traditional\\" and \\"savvy for a couple of tunes to easily cross over to other formats.\\" Alongside You Again, the sisters also recorded A Christmas Card, an album composed of traditional Christmas carols which was issued later in 1987. The next album was 1988's Sincerely. Its lead single was \\"Letter Home\\", followed by a cover of the 1950s pop standard \\"Sincerely\\", and finally \\"Love Will\\". Included on the album were a cover of The Beatles' \\"I've Just Seen a Face\\", and the Harlan Howard composition \\"These Lips Don't Know How to Say Goodbye\\", later a top-ten country hit for Doug Stone in 1991.Whitburn, p. 348 Songwriter Wendy Waldman handled most of the production duties on this album, with assistance on some tracks from Beckett, Stroud, and Norman. Sincerely accounted for the quartet's second Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal nomination at the 31st Annual Grammy Awards in 1988. Jan Walker of The Orlando Sentinel said that \\"there's a confident sound to each of the 10 songs on the album, a showcase for the seemingly effortless natural harmony of four sibling voices.\\" William Ruhlmann of AllMusic reviewed the album with favor as well, stating that \\"[a]lready the possessors of a wonderful vocal harmony style, The Foresters hit a peak when they hooked up with writer/producer Wendy Waldman for this album, cutting her 'Letter Home' and other strong material\\". Warner Bros. released two more projects featuring the sisters in 1989. First was a gospel album entitled All I Need. This included renditions of traditional hymns and spirituals such as \\"Amazing Grace\\" and \\"Precious Memories\\", along with popular 20th-century gospel songs such as \\"This Ole House\\". Christy described the album as \\"roots that we returned to\\", a reference to the sisters' upbringing as singers in their churches. Norman, Beckett, and Stroud co-produced the album. Later in 1989 came a Greatest Hits package. Included on it were two new songs: \\"Don't You\\" and \\"Leave It Alone\\", both of which reached top ten on Hot Country Songs that year. By decade's end, the group's first fourteen singles had all achieved top-ten positions on that chart, at the time the longest such streak achieved by a new artist since the Billboard country charts were expanded to 100 positions in the 1960s. =1990s= Despite the momentum of their previous singles, the group's 1990 album Come Hold Me was unsuccessful on the country charts, with neither of its two selected singles reaching Top 40. These were a cover of John Hiatt's \\"Drive South\\" which also featured guest vocals from the Bellamy Brothers, and \\"Nothing's Gonna Bother Me Tonight\\". Waldman produced the album by herself this time. Contributing musicians included Sam Bush, Mark O'Connor, Willie Weeks, and Craig Bickhardt. Jerry Sharpe of The Pittsburgh Press gave the album a mixed review, saying that it had \\"too much rock coupled with so-so material\\". He praised the singles, along with the title track and \\"You'll Be Mine\\" as the strongest for their vocal performances. In April 1991, Warner released the group's next album Talkin' 'Bout Men. Robert Byrne, another Muscle Shoals-based musician, produced the album and played guitar on it. It was recorded in the same studio where the group had made their demos and first two studio albums. The sisters noted that previous producers had wanted to highlight their \\"softer\\" sound, whereas Byrne was willing to include country rock and Western swing. Lead single \\"Men\\", co-written by Byrne, went on to chart at number eight on Hot Country Songs that year. Kim said of \\"Men\\", a novelty song about the relationships between men and women as seen from a woman's perspective, that she found it relatable because she had listened to it after having an argument with her husband. The song's success also led to a parody called \\"Women\\", recorded on Curb Records by a studio band called the Bandit Brothers; by mid-1991, this parody had charted on Hot Country Songs as well.Whitburn, p. 35 \\"Men\\" became the sisters' third nomination for Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, receiving the nomination at the 34th Annual Grammy Awards in 1991. Despite the success of \\"Men\\", the album charted only one other single in \\"Too Much Fun\\", which reached number 62. Johnny Loftus reviewed the album with favor on AllMusic, calling \\"Men\\" a \\"Bonnie Raitt-lite country pop number\\", and finding influences of Western swing and gospel in some tracks while simultaneously complimenting the sisters' harmonies. The sisters' final chart entries came in 1992 from the album I Got a Date. Both \\"What'll You Do About Me\\" (later a top-20 hit in 1995 for Doug SupernawWhitburn, p. 353) and the title track fell short of the country music top 40. June told The News-Press at the time of the album's release that the sisters wanted to show their \\"witty, mischievous side\\". The group also saw it as a concept album thematically similar in concept to \\"Men\\". Kim highlighted the title track in particular, stating that she was going through a divorce at the time of recording and felt that at the age of 31, she was \\"too old to start dating again\\". Tom Roland of AllMusic wrote that the album was \\"wide-ranging stylistically, with a strong dose of wit, particularly in the title track and 'Redneck Romeo.'\\" The sisters took a hiatus from recording for much of the mid-1990s, but continued to tour regionally, though primarily on weekends in order to tend to their children the rest of the week. They returned to the studio for a new album called More than I Am in 1996. Warner marketed the album as \\"positive country\\", featuring uplifting and spiritual messages without being explicitly contemporary Christian music in nature, and taking inspiration from similar releases by Ricky Van Shelton and Susie Luchsinger. Christy's husband, Gary Smith, produced the album and played keyboards on it. Among the contributing songwriters were Karen Staley and Paul Overstreet, the latter of whom had previously co-written the group's \\"I Fell in Love Again Last Night\\". After this album, the sisters decided to retire from the music business, citing both a desire to spend more time with their families and the genre's increasing focus on male artists. Kathy subsequently became a music teacher, June a teacher for students with visual impairments, and both Kim and Christy, interior designers. The four sisters have since reunited to give the occasional performance, notably in 2013 to honor their induction into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. Musical styles The group's sound is defined mainly by four-part vocal harmonies, typically with Kim or Kathy handling the lead vocal parts. However, both Perfume, Ribbons & Pearls and Come Hold Me featured songs where Christy or June sang lead instead. Of the vocal arrangements, Christy told The Tennessean in 1985 that \\"it's just pretty much what we hear in our heads\\". Due to their early experiences singing in church, the sisters would often sing a cappella gospel standards in concert. The sisters have cited Bonnie Raitt, Emmylou Harris, and Linda Ronstadt as their primary musical influences. Thomas Goldsmith of The Tennessean wrote that Kim's \\"alto voice is key to the group's densely textured sound\\". He also noted between their first two singles the \\"unusual subject matter\\" of \\"When You're in Love\\", about a woman who \\"threatens reprisal\\" for an unfaithful husband, as well as the \\"carousel keyboards and ringing guitars\\" of \\"I Fell in Love Again Last Night\\". A review of Perfume, Ribbons & Pearls published in People compared Kathy and Kim's voices favorably to Terri Gibbs. James M. Tarbox of Knight Ridder News Services described the sisters' voices as having \\"a coquetteish playfulness they keep under enough control that it neither becomes cloying nor prevents them from offering something as thoughtful as the hit 'Too Many Rivers'\\". The Forester Sisters were frequently compared to other family music groups of the time, including The Judds and The Whites. An uncredited review from People called the sisters \\"the cheeriest bunch of good old gals... since The Mandrells\\" (Barbara Mandrell, Louise Mandrell, and Irlene Mandrell), and noted that unlike The Whites, the Forester Sisters did not have a male vocalist to \\"[give] more depth and richness to the family harmonies\\". The sisters' concerts were reportedly more heavily attended by women than men, an observation made by both Billboard and The Tennessean. Similarly, a review of Perfume, Ribbons & Pearls in People stated that \\"Along with the Judds, the Foresters have helped fill the female group gap in country music\\". Colin Larkin wrote in the Virgin Encyclopedia of Country Music that \\"their glossy, professional sound and looks appealed to country fans\\".

Composed primarily of pop standards such as \\"Ol' Man River\\" and \\"For Once in My Life\\" (later a major hit for Motown labelmate Stevie Wonder), and similar songs written by Holland-Dozier- Holland and other Motown staff songwriters, the Mellow Mood album was part of Motown chief Berry Gordy's crossover plans for the group. Gordy wanted the Temptations, already the most popular male group among black audiences, to attract a large white fanbase and be able to secure playdates at supper clubs like the Copacabana, where the group had first performed in the summer of 1967. The Temptations themselves, and Paul Williams in particular, were worried about appearing as sell-outs to their black fans and the radio DJs who had made them popular in the first place. However, both pop and soul fans responded to the Mellow Mood album, and the Temptations reached Gordy's desired goal of crossing over to white audiences. \\"Ol' Man River\\" was already present in the Temptations' performance repertoire as bass Melvin Franklin's solo spot, and \\"For Once in My Life\\" soon became a solo showcase for Williams, who performed a particularly acclaimed version of the song for the TCB television special in late 1968.

Early life and family Nicholas Greenberry was baptised at Irnham, South Kesteven, Lincolnshire, England born to Nicholas and Catherine Greeneberrie n√©e Hawkins of Imham, Lincolnshire, England. He married Anne Howard in Kent, England. A Nicholas Greenberry also shows up in the state papers of Charles II: Nicholas and Anne (Howard) Greenberry had six children: Anne who died as an infant born 1667 and died 6 AUG 1667 at St Giles, Goudhurst, Kent, England. Elizabeth who died as an infant 19 Mar 1671 at Hoborn, London, London, England. Charles, born 9 FEB 1672 at Holburn, London, Middlesex, England. Katherine, born 1674 at Holburn, London, Middlesex, England. Anne, born 1676 at Anne Arundel County; and Elizabeth, born 23 September 1678 at Anne Arundel County. Greenberry arrived at Patuxent, in the Maryland Colony, aboard the sailing ship Constant Friendship in 1674. He was accompanied by his wife, two children, and three servants. On 9 July 1674, Capt. William Wheatly, master, claimed rights due for transportation of 43 passengers on board, including \\"Mr Greenberry his wife & two Children.\\"Maryland Land Patents 18:160 Nicholas Greenberry died on December 17, 1697 and is buried in St Anne's Churchyard in Annapolis, Maryland. The inscription on his tombstone reads:  Land ownership  According to Maryland Land Warrants, Annapolis Land Office, Liber 15, folio 837, Greenberry was granted a warrant for of land located in \\"Providence\\" (now Annapolis) on July 29, 1674. Later, in 1680, Nicholas bought another tract of land near \\"Providence\\" called \\"Fuller\\" from Colonel William Fuller. This land was resurveyed and renamed \\"Greenberry Forest\\". Greenberry called the home \\"Whitehall\\", a name it retains to this day. In later years, this home became the residence of Horatio Sharpe, governor of the Maryland Colony. Sharpe had a Georgian mansion built on the site. In 1685, Colonel Nicholas Greenberry bought 250 acres (1 km2) of land called \\"Towne Neck\\". This is located at the mouth of the Severn River and became known as \\"Greenberry Point\\". The colony's Deputy Governor, Governor Notley, was forced from office for hanging two Protestants for rebellion against authority. He was replaced by a Committee of twenty citizens. Greenberry was one of the gentlemen justices chosen as a member of that committee.  Revolt  On July 27, 1689, the Protestant Association, under John Coode, seized St. Marys, the capital of the colony, in a revolt against the proprietary government. This same year, Nicholas was captain of foot in the Anne Arundel County Militia. He was promoted to Major in 1690. He then quickly received a commission of Colonel, and was appointed Commander of the Military Forces of Anne Arundel and Baltimore Counties. The proprietaryship was disallowed on 27 June 1691. Sir Lionel Copley took the office as governor, and quickly appointed Greenberry as a member of the council. Copley died in September 1693, at which time Greenberry was appointed by Sir Edmund Andros, Governor of Virginia, as President of the Council, Acting Governor of Maryland, and Keeper of the Great Seal of Maryland. Greenberry served in this capacity until he was replaced on 26 July 1694 by Francis Nicholson by a commission from the King dated in February 1694.Archives of Maryland 51: preface pp. 45-48  High court appointment  On 2 March 1695, Nicholas Greenberry was on the high Court of Chancery of Maryland.This is recorded in Seated in the High Court of Chancery, Liber P.C.

In woodworking and carpentry, a pair of winding sticks is a tool that aids in viewing twist or wind in pieces of lumber (timber) by amplifying the defect.Ellis, George. Modern Practical Joinery.

It is common for a woodworker to make a matching pair for the purpose, and contrasting colors of woods improve the discernability of differences in height and level between the two sticks as they are compared. One winding stick is placed on one end of the piece and the second winding stick is placed on the other end, parallel to the first. The woodworker then stands back a short distance and sights across the top of the two sticks. If the surface on which the sticks are sitting is flat (in the same plane), the top edges of the two sticks line up perfectly with each other; otherwise, the discrepancy becomes apparent. Adjustments to the surface of the board are then made (e.g., with a hand plane). This process is repeated all across the piece until the piece is satisfactorily true. Longitudinally the piece is checked with a straightedge. Care and Maintenance Winding sticks are generally planed parallel back to back to ensure they are true; this is why it is important to use the sticks with the inlay facing one another. Winding sticks are not dependent on being the same height along their length; the critical element is that they are parallel to each other and then used in that configuration. Every workshop has a different climate, and therefore it is advisable to check from time to time that your sticks are still true. If it is found that they require adjustment, it's a straightforward task to correct. Firstly ensure you check the soles are flat; a long shooting board is recommended for the job. Next align both sticks either back to back or face to face, whichever is easiest for you to secure, then take light passes over the tops with a hand plane until you get even shavings from both sticks. They are now parallel.

Early life She was born Lydia Chkalov in Rostov-on-Don, in the south of Russia, in 1885. She married Baron Boris Stahl, a Russian nobleman, who divorced her and emigrated to the United States with his new wife Ludmila. Personal life She befriended the Finnish writer Hella Wuolijoki and was a regular visitor to her estate Marleback in Southern Finland, which was a meeting place for leftist intellectuals and politicians. Through her relationship with Finnish communist politician Otto Kuusinen, she met the American radical, journalist John Reed, and maintained a correspondence with him until his death in 1920. Career While a refugee in Finland she joined the Soviet secret service in 1921. During the 1920s, Lydia established a photography studio in Paris where she copied secret documents for Soviet Military Intelligence. In June 1928 she was transferred to New York to help the Soviet Union's Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) rezident Alfred Tilton. Her second trip to New York took place in December 1931. Then she returned to Paris to work for the network which included Robert Gordon Switz who led his own group. Lydia's ami was the French professor Louis Pierre Martin, codebreaker and translator for the Naval Ministry and member of the Legion of Honor. Arrest In 1933 counterespionage uncovered a network in Finland which included Tilton's wife Maria, Lydia's friend Ingrid Bostrom, and Arvid Jacobson. Bostrom provided information which led French counterintelligence to Lydia. She was arrested in December 1933 and other members of the network, including Switz and his wife, were arrested shortly afterward. Lydia was convicted of espionage in April 1935 and served a four-year sentence. She disappeared after her release from French prison.

It was written by John Hopkins and Bruce Graham and directed by Ken Kwapis. Plot Lionel Spalding (Glenn Shadix) and his dog Neil arrive at the prestigious, five-star Majestic Hotel where he is accidentally drenched by an overflowing fountain due to a prank by Kyle (Eric Lloyd) and his older brother Brian (Graham Sack), much to the stress and frustration of the hotel manager and the boys' widowed father Robert Grant (Jason Alexander). He is disappointed with the boys but they are guaranteed a vacation in Barbados afterwards, only to be forced to cancel the trip for a third time by the ruthless, haughty hotel owner, Elena Dubrow (Faye Dunaway), due to the upcoming Crystal Ball where one of the guests is revealed to be a critic from the Le Monde Traveller Organization who they hope will reward the Majestic with a sixth star. At that moment, \\"Lord\\" Rutledge (Rupert Everett) a jewel thief (who is thought to be the critic by Mrs. Dubrow), arrives with an orangutan named Dunston, intending to steal the guests' jewelry. Dunston and his deceased brother Samson were both trained in thievery their entire lives. Now Dunston has been wanting to escape from Rutledge's poor treatment and life of crime ever since. Meanwhile, Rutledge distracts and causes Kyle to accidentally set a sterling rope mini-pulley free from his hand where Brian falls down and out from a laundry chute. Dunston flees from Rutledge and is later found by Kyle, who befriends the poor orangutan and promises to keep him safe. However Dunston soon begins causing disruption in the hotel such as ruining Spalding's workout and interfering with Mrs. Dellacroce's massage. After realizing Dunston's presence, Robert calls for an animal control specialist named Buck LaFarge (Paul Reubens) to remove Dunston from the hotel. Rutledge searches the hotel for Dunston, and after locating him, ties Kyle up and gags him. Dunston and Kyle escape to the ballroom where the Crystal Ball is taking place, obtaining a picture of Rutledge, Dunston, and Samson from Rutledge's room. Kyle and Brian show the picture to their dad, and Robert is infuriated when Kyle says Rutledge tied him up. Brian and Kyle search for Dunston, avoiding LaFarge and Mrs. Dubrow, while Robert and Rutledge fight in the kitchen. Robert eventually stands up to Mrs. Dubrow, but is fired in the process. However, it turns out that Lionel Spalding, who had been humiliated, injured and inconvenienced by Dunston's antics, was the critic all along. As a result, Spalding declares Mrs. Dubrow managed to go from a five-star hotel to a one-star hotel before passing out from LaFarge's tranquilizer dart. Rutledge is arrested and LaFarge apologizes to Dunston, who then punches him. In the end, thanks to the more kind-hearted Mr. Dubrow (Nathan Davis), Robert, Kyle and Brian relocate to Bali, to manage a Majestic hotel there and have even managed to keep Dunston as a pet. They invite Spalding over with a complementary room and meals to make up for all the trouble he experienced and assure him that nothing will go wrong this time. However, in the last scene, Dunston causes further trouble by dropping a large coconut which lands on Spalding's head.

History Alexander Movsisian was born on 18 April 1858, into a tailor's family in the province of Shirvan (then Shemakha Governorate, Russian Empire, modern-day Azerbaijan) and later adopted the Persian-inspired pen-name Shirvanzade (son of Shirvan). He brought to fruition the social realist school blossoming in the Caucasus and particularly in Azerbaijan promoted by the philosopher and playwright Mirza Fatali Akhundov. At the age of 17, Shirvanzade went to work in the city of Baku whose fortunes were beginning to rise with the boom in oil production. He immersed himself in Armenian, Azeri and Russian literature as well as reading Stendhal, Balzac, Flaubert, Zola and Shakespeare, his greatest love. Working first as a clerk and then as an accountant for oil companies, Shirvanzade saw first-hand the social impact of industrialized oil production. He turned his shock and anger into a literature of protest, writing in many genres: novels, plays, short stories, and newspaper articles. His later literary activities resulted in his imprisonment in Tiflis, an experience which led to his masterpiece, Chaos (1896‚Äì97). Returning to Baku, he became increasingly interested in women's issues, as shown in his play Evgine about women's suffrage, and Did She Have the Right? Shirvanzade's concerns with capitalism and feminism fuse in his drama, Namus (For the Sake of Honor) (1904). In 1916, Maxim Gorki wrote that Shirvanzade's works \\"were known and read not only in the Caucasus but also in England, in the Scandinavian Peninsula, and Italy.\\" In his later years, Shirvanzade lived abroad, finally returning permanently to the USSR in 1926 and became a member of the Union of Azerbaijani Writers.the Union of Azerbaijani Writers He died in Kislovodsk in 1935, and was buried in Komitas Pantheon which is located in the city center of Yerevan.Alexander's memorial tombstone at Komitas Pantheon Books *Chaos (1898), a novel describing the life of a large industrial city *The Evil Spirit, a novel about an epileptic woman. *Namus (1911), a play about the ill fate of two lovers, who were engaged by their families to each other since childhood, but because of violations of namus (a tradition of honor), the girl was married by her father to another person.

Saint Basil's Cathedral on the Red Square, in Moscow Russophilia (literally love of Russia or Russians) is admiration and fondness of Russia (including the era of the Soviet Union and Russian Empire), Russian history and Russian culture. The antonym and opposite of Russophilia is Russophobia. Russophilia in Europe American author Robert Alexander wrote: \\"I love Russians for their dramatic, emotional nature. They're not afraid to love, not afraid to get hurt, not afraid to exaggerate or act impulsively.\\" In October 2004, the International Gallup Organization announced the results of its poll, according to which approximately 20% of the residents of Western Europe viewed Russia positively, with the most positive view coming from Iceland, Germany, Greece, and Britain. The percentage of respondents expressing a positive attitude towards Russia was 9% in Finland, Turkey, and Japan, 38% in Lithuania, 36% in Latvia, and 34% in Estonia. Estonia and especially Latvia have a large number of ethnic Russians, which likely affected the result. Russophilia in Serbia and Montenegro =Russophilia in Serbia= Russia is hugely popular in Serbia, and Serbs have always traditionally seen Russia as a close ally due to shared Slavic culture and Orthodox faith. In Serbia and Montenegro, whose nations are both predominately Eastern Orthodox, the faith expressed by a vast majority of Russians, there was no Soviet influence and Russians were always seen as friendly brotherly people. About 83% of Serbs see Russia as their first ally on the international scene. In both Serbia and Montenegro, there are neighbourhoods, streets, buildings and statues named after something Russian. In Serbia there is the Russian Centre of Science and Culture and a Hotel Moskva.

There is the Moscow Bridge in Podgorica, and a statue of Russian singer and actor Vladimir Vysotsky next to the bridge. File:Dva mosta panorama sm.jpgMoscow Bridge, Podgorica Russophilia in Ukraine Pro- Russian separatists in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine Following Ukrainian independence in 1991 Ukrainians, mostly in the east and south of the country, voted to a see a more Russophile attitude of the government, ranging from closer economic partnership to full national union. Since the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine the overall attitude of Ukrainians towards Russia and Russians has become much more negative.How Ukraine views Russia and the West, Brookings Institution (October 18, 2017) =Western Ukraine= Russophilia (Moscophilia, Ukrainian: –º–æ—Å–∫–≤–æ—Ñ—ñ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ, moskvofil‚Äôstvo) was a linguistic, literary and socio-political movement in the Western Ukrainian territories of Galicia, Transcarpathia, and Bukovyna in the 18th ‚Äì 20th centuries. Proponents of this movement believed in linguistic, cultural, social union with Russian people and later in state union with Russia. Among the causes for the emergence of this phenomenon were the absence of Ukrainian statehood, centuries of foreign oppression, fragmented Ukrainian territories and dispersed population, as well as the defection of national elite to neighbouring cultures and a weak sense of national identity. =Russophile Movement in Transcarpathia= The first instances of Russophilia in Transcarpathia date back as far as late 18th early 19th centuries when several famous Russians with ties to the government and the court of the tsar settled there. Such famous scientists and social activists as I. Orlai, M. Baludiansky, P. Lodiy and others lived in Transcarpathia and maintained close ties with the country of their birth and thereby promoted interest towards Russia, especially towards its cultural life, its language and literature. =Russophile Movement in Galicia and Bukovyna= When Galicia and Bukovyna were incorporated into the Habsburg Empire in 1772 the Austrian government treated the Ukrainian population of these territories with suspicion as it was afraid it was susceptible to Russian influence due to the closeness of Ukrainian and Russian languages and cultures. This mistrust of the authorities was cultivated by influential Polish politicians and activists in an effort to forestall the growth of national consciousness on territories where Poles traditionally had influence. Any attempt at cultural revival was met with hostility from the Austrian government which regarded them as an influence from Moscow. In spite of this atmosphere of mistrust and suspicion the first educational establishment \\"The Fellowship of Priests\\" was founded in Przemy≈õl. Metropolitan M. Levytsky began to introduce the Ruthenian language in elementary schools, developed grammar books, insisted on instruction in University in Ruthenian and founded \\"Ruska Troyka\\" Society. The Lemko-Rusyn Republic, after World War I, attempted to join Lemko territories to Russia, and later to similar areas of the newly formed Czechoslovakia.

The series was intended to chronicle 20 years in the lives of a group of six high school friends from Bedford, New York, with each episode following one year in the lives of the six, beginning with their high school graduation year 1986. Each episode also featured scenes in the present where Detective Marjorino (Mathew St. Patrick) is investigating the brutal murder of one of the group during the night of their 20-year class reunion in 2006. The identity of the murder victim was not revealed until the fifth episode, \\"1990\\". Due to low ratings, the series was canceled after only nine episodes (four more episodes had been ordered but were not aired in the US), and the identity of the killer remained unrevealed in the aired episodes. Characters and plot * Craig Brewster (Sean Faris): The spoiled son of real estate mogul Russell Brewster and future politician. * Samantha Carlton (Alexa Davalos): Craig's high school sweetheart and wife. * Will Malloy (Will Estes): Craig's best friend, Sam's secret admirer, and the father of Sam's secret daughter Amy. In early episodes we learn that Will is a priest in the present time. * Aaron Lewis (Dave Annable): Slight geek who left MIT to sell technology and start an Internet company in its early days that blossoms to a multimillion-dollar company. His marriage to Pascal is compromised by his obvious lifelong affection for Carla. * Carla Noll (Chyler Leigh): Aaron's best friend and hidden secret admirer for years, who entered into an abusive relationship with Amy's adopted father as Amy's nanny, and an aspiring photographer. * Jenna Moretti (Amanda Righetti): The \\"hot girl\\" who enjoyed 15 minutes of fame in the late 1980s/early 1990s as an actress before moving back to New York and attempting to get her life back on track. Each episode also features scenes in the present where Detective Kenneth Marjorino (Mathew St. Patrick) is investigating the brutal murder of one of the group during the night of their 20-year class reunion, the identity of which was not revealed at the start of the season. Although his motives are initially secret, viewers quickly learn that Marjorino has harbored a 20-year grudge against Will Malloy, Craig Brewster, and their friends for what he perceives to be unfulfilled justice for the death of his father in a car accident that also involved a car occupied by Will and Craig (both of whom had been drinking that night). Although he maintains his composure, it becomes apparent that Marjorino is letting the case consume his life. Each episode viewers are introduced to additional minor characters who may or may not have significantly affected the past. These include Amy, the secret child of Will and Sam; Meghan, her adoptive mother; Paul, her adoptive father and future abusive lover of Carla; Peter, Carla's future husband; Pascal, Aaron's one night stand and eventual wife; Chloe, their love child; Noelle, their second child; Henry, Sam and Craig's son; and Rachel, a former secretary of Craig Brewster with whom he had an affair early in his marriage to Sam and who resurfaces in an attempt to ruin both of their lives. The show was cancelled prior to the addition of another significant minor character: Katherine, the daughter of a rival Congressman of Craig Brewster and future fiance of Will Malloy. Other plotlines * In \\"1988\\", viewers learn Marjorino's connection to the friends: his loving father was the driver who died in the car crash involving Will and Craig in 1986. Marjorino harbors intense feelings of injustice and largely believes that his father's killer has murdered the deceased friend. Originally vindictive towards Will, he soon turns his attention to Craig. * In the fifth episode, \\"1990\\" (first aired November 10, 2005) it was revealed that Samantha is the character that was killed. * In \\"1992\\", it was revealed that the present day Craig Brewster, who relies on a wheelchair for movement, is actually not paralyzed and can walk. * In \\"1992\\", it was revealed that a younger Marjorino in fact plotted to kill Will Malloy for the murder of his father, only to be talked out of it by his future wife. In the present day, however, Marjorino's wife leaves him, disgusted that he cannot let go of revenge. * In \\"1993\\", it was revealed that Peter, Carla's husband, died. * The final aired episode, \\"1994\\", features a cliffhanger where Marjorino is run down by a car in an alley and left bloodied and injured. Leaked spoilers on the Internet have speculated that Craig and Sam's son Henry was the driver. * A dark secret involving Craig and Will, in which Will took the heat for a drunk driving accident when Craig was actually driving the car, since his BAC was below the legal limit. The other man involved, Marjorino's father, died after being discharged, and Will spent a year in prison and lost his lacrosse scholarship after being made an example by the legal system. * The love triangle between Craig, Sam, and Will, complicated by the child that only Sam knows was fathered by Will. * The obvious love of Carla and Aaron, who can never be on the same page at the same time. * Aaron's one night stand and the love child that resulted from it, leading to his marriage to her mother, Pascal. * Carla becoming the nanny of Will and Sam's love child, Amy, to keep Sam in her life, and her ensuing relationship with Paul, Amy's adoptive father, that quickly turns abusive. * Will being forced by the FBI to help bring down Russell Brewster for illegal practices, the same man who gave him a job to help rebuild his life after prison. * Craig's entry into politics and winning a seat on the State Assembly. * Jenna burning out in acting after ending her farce marriage to the gay producer who helped her build her career. * The tension between Carla and her future husband Peter, and Aaron and his wife Pascal, over not only their devotion to their friends, but also their devotion to each other. * Craig's affair with his mentally unstable secretary, Rachel. * The mutual attraction between Jenna and Craig. * Will Malloy serving in the army, entering law school, and eventually becoming Craig's campaign manager. * Sam's addiction to stimulants. * Sam's belief that she accidentally killed a woman because of the stimulants she was taking. * Will's army friend's death and Will's affair with the friend's sister. * In the last filmed episode (unseen in America) it was revealed that Sam and Will's daughter Amy had died in a fire with her adopted mother. If it were true, this would render it impossible for her to be the speculated killer. Cancellation Originally, Reunion was intended to last for 22 episodes, with each episode chronicling one year in the life of the six main characters --from their graduation in 1986 to the murder of one of them the day of their high school reunion in 2006. However, after a promising start, the show's ratings dropped, failing to hold the viewers from its lead in, The O.C., whereupon Fox announced the series would not be continued beyond the thirteen episodes already ordered. While it was speculated the cancellation might lead to a change of the format--possibly skipping or combining some years to reach 2006 and reveal the murderer by the now-final thirteenth episode--series creator Jon Harmon Feldman originally announced the show would simply end with 1998, with the identity of the murderer unrevealed. However, after ratings continued to fall in December 2005, Fox announced ‚Äì both in the media and on their official website ‚Äì that the \\"1994\\" episode eventually would be the last, and the remaining four episodes filmed would not air. Fox later gave away outlines the episodes \\"1995\\", \\"1996\\", \\"1997\\" and \\"1998\\" to websites. On June 7, 2006, the episode \\"1998\\" was shown in many countries, but not the USA. During the Television Critics Association press tour, Fox Entertainment president Peter Ligouri addressed reporters regarding the show's abrupt end. Ligouri stated there were several ways to go with the killer's identity. However, \\"the best guess was that particular time that it was going to be Sam's daughter\\", whom she gave up for adoption early in the series. The reason why the murder occurred still remains a mystery. The Brazilian channel SBT, at the end of episode 13, inserted a narrator telling an alternative end (freely invented) for the drama: the killer would be Craig's father, Russell Brewster. = Unreleased plot= Sam was the one who ended up dying, so everybody was trying to cover their tracks. [The shooter] was supposed to be her daughter, who later down the road would have come to work for Carla. She [Carla] tries to get them reconciled, but someone breaks into the apartment of Craig Brewster, while Sam was there with her daughter. In a struggle with this intruder, Amy accidentally shot Sam. When the 13th episode aired on the SBT channel in Brazil, additional information had been added. A narrator explained that an adult Amy, angry over being abandoned as an infant and being abused by her adopted father, accidentally shoots and kills Samantha. Will and Craig call Craig‚Äôs high-powered dad, Russell (Gregory Harrison), for help. The big twist is that, when Russell arrives, he discovers that Samantha is still breathing and secretly suffocates her because of Sam‚Äôs earlier affair with Will. His crime is eventually discovered and he‚Äôs brought to justice. Dave Annable verified the events of this ending in October 2006.

It is owned by the University of New Orleans, offering a news and information radio format with some jazz programs on weekends. Studios and offices are located on the fourth floor of the UNO library. The transmitter is off Behrman Highway in the Algiers neighborhood of New Orleans.Radio- Locator.com/WWNO WWNO is simulcast in Thibodaux, Louisiana, on KTLN at 90.5 MHz. WWNO also operates a 24-hour classical music service, \\"Classical 104.9 FM,\\" on 250 watt FM translator K285FF in Metarie, one of the few dedicated classical stations in the South. WWNO broadcasts in the HD Radio hybrid format. Its HD2 subchannel carries \\"Classical 104.9 FM.\\" The HD3 subchannel plays jazz music. Programming WWNO's weekday schedule has several programs from National Public Radio including All Things Considered, Morning Edition, Here & Now and Fresh Air with Terry Gross. Weekend NPR shows include Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!, This American Life, American Routes and On The Media. Local WWNO programming includes The Reading Life, Out To Lunch, Continuum and Louisiana Eats. The BBC World Service is heard overnight Sunday through Thursday. On Friday and Saturday nights, WWNO plays jazz. WWNO has a local news staff covering New Orleans and Louisiana stories, with NPR covering world and national news. History =Early Years= WWNO signed on the air on February 20, 1972.Broadcasting Yearbook 1973 page B-87 It was soon after the University of New Orleans adopted its current name. The school had previously been known as \\"Louisiana State University in New Orleans.\\" KTLN was brought on line in 1995. From its earliest days, WWNO was an NPR network affiliate. Originally WWNO was powered at only 5,000 watts. By 1980, the output had been increased to 50,000 watts on a 600-foot tower.Broadcasting Yearbook 1980 page C-98 Today the power is 35,000 watts but the height above average terrain (HAAT) has increased to 984 feet (299.8 meters). So WWNO's coverage extends throughout Southeast Louisiana and a section of Southwest Mississippi. =Hurricane Katrina= Prior to Hurricane Katrina making landfall in late August 2005, general manager Chuck Miller called extra staff in to the station to help, dropped the regular program format and shared as much information as possible about traffic, evacuation procedures and other news that would be helpful to the 86,000+ people who tune in each week. The building housing the studios had a back-up generator with buried transmission lines. The transmitter site also had generator power. The staff brought extra clothing and other personal items and were prepared to sleep away from windows. Computers and other valuable items were brought into interior rooms. On the evening before the storm made landfall, the University of New Orleans shut down the IT department without informing the station personnel. WWNO was left without Internet access. Station staff turned to the television and other local radio for sources of information. Miller and the staff found themselves hunkering down in the station the Saturday before Katrina hit with sleeping bags and non-perishables to broadcast through the storm. Four WWNO staff made it to work during the early morning hours of Sunday, August 28, 2005, Miller, Fred Kasten, James Arey and Jack Hopke. Two people handled the phones and monitored TV and the other two served on-air. Katrina was then declared Category 5 and headed straight for New Orleans. Miller requested and received permission to evacuate the staff from the station. WWNO signed over its signal to a local TV station. The station was knocked off the air by Hurricane Katrina. The WWNO transmitter facility suffered a loss of nearly 200 feet of transmission line delivering audio to the antenna. Limited physical access and a lack of power hampered restoration of service. The generator ran but as the campus flooded, it shorted out the power lines. Staff were relocated to places all over the country. When the storm was over, Miller and his team made calls to NPR and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) to seek support for WWNO's restoration. CPB's Greg Schnerring suggested a satellite downlink to restore programming. Miller approached Georgia Public Broadcasting (GPB) in Atlanta about using a radio studio and delivery of the signal via a PBS uplink from Atlanta to New Orleans. GPB had the capacity and could send audio to New Orleans via a satellite system, using a studio GPB rarely used, and IT could set up WWNO's technology needs. Georgia Public Radio officials agreed to welcome WWNO to their studios until the station was able to return to its location on the UNO campus. CPB provided an emergency $20,000 grant and non- commercial program providers NPR, Public Radio International and American Public Radio temporarily waived program costs. However, challenges remained with getting a non-profit station back on the air while its staff was scattered all over the country, its studios on the campus were inaccessible and its transmitter was disabled. =After Katrina= Relocated in Atlanta, Miller began looking for equipment to rebuild. WWNO Chief Engineer Robert Carroll was able to reach the crippled transmitter site on the West Bank of the New Orleans area with enough equipment and supplies to repair the facility and bring it up to operation. American Public Media offered a transmitter and engineering support. CPB offered two transmitters from Alaska, and more than 15 stations offered temporary employment, housing, clothing, food and transportation to the displaced WWNO staff. GPB spent about a week getting the studio ready along with fulfilling WWNO's IT requests while CPB worked on getting the fly-away downlink sent to New Orleans. WWNO's chief engineer, Robert Carroll drove with police escort to see the station's transmitter site in Gretna. He immediately noticed that 200 feet of transmission line up the side of the tower was missing. Katrina's winds burst the clamps (every 8 feet). The line hit the ground with such force it left a mark in the concrete. When the equipment arrived, Carroll and operations manager Ron Curtis set up and aimed the downlink at the GPB satellite. The station kept its connection to the Crescent City via Program Director Fred Kasten, who built a studio in his home in New Orleans after returning from the evacuation. =Back on the air= WWNO returned to air on September 2, 2005, from the studios of GPB in Atlanta, using the NPR downlink tied to the station's local transmitter and tower just outside New Orleans. Public service was the primary reason for being on the air. Every break was to have recovery information in it. The remote operations from Atlanta gave WWNO the technical ability to launch a local news department from 400 miles away. Miller, music director James Arey, broadcaster Farrar Hudkins and afternoon announcer Jack Hopke worked double shifts for three months, broadcasting by satellite from GPB's studios. A generous local Atlanta resident let Arey and Hudkins live rent-free in a house. CPB funds helped furnish the home and pay utilities. Program director Fred Kasten set up a small studio in his damaged uptown home and assembled a team of feature reporters who helped WWNO paint an authentic picture of New Orleans' recovery from the scene. Kasten also broadcast his \`Saturday Night Jazz' show from the home studio. Webmaster Shantel Washington worked from Roanoke, Virginia. On Friday, September 23, less than one month after the devastation caused by Katrina, Hurricane Rita headed for the Gulf in the general direction of New Orleans. WWNO carried regular updates about Rita through the weekend. Luckily, Rita's damage was minimal. After 89 days in Atlanta, WWNO returned to its University of New Orleans studios on December 19, 2005.

(1992). Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style (3rd ed.). Woodstock, New York: The Overlook Press. thriller film directed by Harold Becker, written by Richard Price and starring Al Pacino, Ellen Barkin and John Goodman. The story concerns a New York City detective trying to catch a serial killer who finds victims through the singles column in a newspaper. It was Pacino's first film after a four-year hiatus following the critical and commercial failure of Revolution. Sea of Love was a box-office success, grossing over $110 million. Plot New York City homicide detective Frank Keller is a burned-out alcoholic. His wife left him and married one of his colleagues, and he is depressed about reaching his 20th year on the police force. He is assigned to investigate the murder of a man in Manhattan, shot dead while face down in his bed, naked, listening to an old 45rpm recording of \\"Sea of Love.\\" Keller has three clues ‚Äî a lipstick-smeared cigarette, a want- ad that the dead man placed in a newspaper, and fingerprints of the perpetrator. A second man dies in the same manner in Queens. Detective Sherman Touhey from the local precinct suggests that he and Frank collaborate. Both victims had placed rhyming ads in the lonely hearts column of the newspaper, seeking dates. The detectives track down Raymond Brown, the only other man with a rhyming ad. He's a married man who admits placing the ad but swears that he threw away all the letters and never saw anyone. Frank gets an idea to place a rhyming ad in the paper, meet women who respond in a restaurant and take the prints from their drinking glasses. Frank's precinct chief is skeptical, but changes his mind when Brown turns up dead in the same manner as the other two murder victims. Frank has dinner with several women, while Sherman ‚Äî posing as a waiter ‚Äî puts their glasses into evidence bags. One woman, divorcee Helen Cruger, shows no interest in Frank and leaves without taking a drink, so Frank is unable to get her fingerprints. Frank bumps into her again at a market, but this time she is more friendly. Helen manages a chic upscale shoe store. Frank does not reveal his true occupation. Frank takes her to his place, against his better judgment and a warning from Sherman not to do so. They start getting passionate, but Frank panics after finding a gun in her purse and treats her roughly. Helen explains she keeps the starting pistol because she's been scared. Frank apologizes, and they have sex. Frank and Helen begin a romance. He has a chance to obtain Helen's fingerprints on a glass but decides to wipe the glass clean. Their relationship becomes strained when she discovers that he is a cop. One night when he is drunk, he nearly gives away the fact that Helen was involved in a sting. He starts to confess his feelings for her, but then discovers that she responded to each of the victims' ads. When he confronts her, Helen refuses to admit to anything, so he throws her out. Moments later, the real killer bursts into the apartment: Helen's ex-husband Terry, who has been stalking Helen and murdering the men she dates. At gunpoint, he makes Frank lie on his bed and show how he made love to Helen, just as he had done to his other victims before murdering them. Frank manages to overpower Terry and tries to call the police, but Terry lunges at him and, in the ensuing struggle, Frank throws Terry through the bedroom window to his death. Several weeks later, a newly sober Frank meets Sherman in a bar and later reunites with Helen. She forgives him, and they resume their relationship. Cast * Al Pacino as Detective Frank Keller * Ellen Barkin as Helen Cruger * John Goodman as Detective Sherman Touhey * Michael Rooker as Terry Cruger * William Hickey as Frank Keller Sr. * Richard Jenkins as Gruber * John Spencer as Precinct Chief * Michael O'Neill as Raymond Brown Lorraine Bracco filmed scenes as Keller's ex-wife Denice, which were cut from the theatrical release print, but were restored for television versions. Samuel L. Jackson played a minor role as \\"Black Guy\\". Production Ellen Barkin later said she \\"did not enjoy making\\" the movie: > But Al Pacino, on the other hand, was my savior.

Just the fact that everything about Sea Of Love was wrong, except > there I had, arguably, one of the great American actors as my fierce, > fearsome protector, and that felt amazing to me and gave me a level of > confidence that I certainly never would have had without him. Release and reception =Box office= The film did well domestically, debuting at No. 1. In its second week it had a 22% drop. Sea of Love grossed $58.5 million domestically and $52.3 million overseas to a total of $110.9 million worldwide. =Critical= The movie received positive reviews from critics. As of May 2020, it holds a rating of 76% on Rotten Tomatoes from 29 reviews.http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sea_of_love In his review in the Los Angeles Times, Kevin Thomas called it \\"a slick, knowing genre film, through and through, a New York cop suspense thriller that we've seen countless times before,\\" but stated \\"it can't quite keep us away from wondering how a smart woman like Helen, whose looks would stop traffic and whose work would bring her into constant contact with an array of sophisticated men, would ever resort to the personals - unless, of course, she really is a psychopath.\\" The Variety staff review praised the film, calling it \\"a suspenseful film noir boasting a superlative performance by Al Pacino as a burned-out Gotham cop.\\" Hal Hinson, in a mixed review for The Washington Post, stated that if the film \\"were able to get it all, it would be a great movie. As it is, it's stirring and messy and hints at more than it is capable of delivering.\\" Roger Ebert, giving the film three out of four stars, praised the acting of Al Pacino and Ellen Barkin, but thought \\"the ending ... cheats by bringing in a character from left field at the last moment. Part of the fun in a movie like this is guessing the identity of the killer, and part of the problem ... is that the audience is not fairly treated. Technically, I suppose, the plot can be justified. But I felt cheated. I had good feelings for the characters and their relationships, but I walked out feeling the plot played fast and loose with the rules of whodunits.\\" =Scientific study= A sequence in Sea of Love was selected in a scientific study as one of two sequences that were most able to produce surprise in viewers.

He is the senior minister of Village Church, Annandale, New South Wales, and works at Christians in the Media. He was formerly a radio journalist and presenter on radio stations 2UE and 2WS. He continued as a news editor in radio and became involved in Anglican churches in Sydney, though he had been raised a Roman Catholic. He later began studying theology at Moore Theological College and was ordained to the Anglican ministry. He is the author and presenter of the course Introducing God, used as a tool by Sydney Anglicans and others for evangelism. Career After a start in community radio (2SER and 2RPH) Steele's commercial radio career began at 2MO Gunnedah as morning announcer. He switched to 2UE as a journalist in 1985 first covering police rounds, then rural news, then news editing. He was 2UE‚Äôs only journalist at the 1988 Olympic Games. Although he grew up Roman Catholic, Steele says it was while at 2UE that he was introduced to God through his friendship with the 2UE's deputy news director Russell Powell. He then switched to 2WS where he edited and presented various news shifts. In 1992, Steele left 2WS to work as an apprentice to then Anglican chaplain at UNSW Phillip Jensen before studying at Moore Theological College. Steele and Powell founded Christians in the Media in 1997 with Steele as its first staff worker. Christians in the Media focuses on ministry to communications students, workplace bible study groups among media workers and occasional events. Highlights include national Christian media workers conferences 'Access All Areas' in 2005 and 2008 with presenters including Kevin Rudd, Donald McDonald, David Aikman and Mark Scott. In 2003, Steele authored the evangelistic course, Introducing God. The course has been used by 2000 Australian churches and in many other countries around the world. The course is an evangelism course based on the relationship teachings of the Alpha course, but its contents are modelled from the \\"Two ways to live\\" tract by Matthias Media. He also spoke extensively at churches and training seminars in 2004-2006 training pastors and church leaders in connecting with postmodern Australians. Steele was ordained in the Anglican Diocese of Sydney where he is a member of the diocese's synod, standing committee, mission board and the South Sydney Regional Council. Steele was appointed as lay minister in charge of St Aidan's Anglican Church in Annandale in 2002. He was ordained in 2003 and remained in charge of St Aidan's. In 2004 St Aidan's changed its name to Annandale Community Church and then in 2009 to Village Church, Annandale. In 2011, Steele and one of the Annandale Church parish councillors were exonerated in a defamation case brought by a parishioner in the Supreme Court in Sydney.

Kyrgyzstan's first known export to Europe was the Arslanbob walnut. Two waterfalls are located in the area which attract tourists, pilgrims and other visitors during the spring and summer months. The population of Arslanbob was 11,291 in 2009. Most of the population are Uzbek, and less than 5% is Kyrgyz, Russian, Tatar, Tajik, or Chechen. Etymology Arslanbob is named after an 11th-century figure, Arslanbob-Ata (alternate: Arstanbap-Ata). He may have been of Arab descent as in that language, Aslan translates to \\"lion\\" and bab to \\"gate\\", while in Turkic languages, ata means \\"father of\\". ergo \\"father of the lion gate\\". 'Bob', used as a suffix, is a traditional practice used in the Arslanbob which denotes \\"a traveler and explorer\\". History According to legend, Alexander the Great took the walnuts from the forest of Arslanbob, and these formed the European plantations. For this reason, the walnut is known as the Greek nut in Russian. Scientific research however shows that the walnut forests around Arslanbob are probably around 1000 years old, and were planted. This corresponds with another local story, that says the forest was planted under the leadership of Arystanbop, who founded the village in his name, and died around 1120 CE. Geography Artificial waterfall near Arslanbob. Walnut forest in Arslanbob Arslanbob is reached from Jalal-Abad via Bazar-Korgon. Kyzylunkyur is away, reachable via Oogon-Talaa, which is situated in the Kara-Unkur valley. The walnut forest is within the forest situated between the Fergana and Chatkal Mountains. The walnut forest is located at altitudes varying between and above sea level on the Fergana range's south-facing slopes. At , the Arslanbob woodland is the largest walnut grove on Earth. Behind the town of Arslanbob are the Khrebet Babash-Ata Mountains. There are two waterfalls nearby. One measures high and has a slippery scree slope; it is situated in a cliff face north of the village. Another, to the east, is in height and has two prayer caves, one of which is known as the Cave of the 40 Angels. Within walking distance is the Dashman Forest Reserve, another walnut forest. Flora and fauna ;Flora The main issues threatening the forest are cattle grazing and haymaking, but collecting nuts, hunting, gathering firewood and timber, as well as climate change all reduce the ability of the forest to regenerate. World Conservation Union (IUCN) held a workshop in September 1995 at Arslanbob to specifically discuss \\"an exceptional botanical garden\\" of walnut fruit trees found in Kyrgyzstan distributed over the two large forest ranges of Arslanbob Kugart and Khoja Ata running east west, which in the past covered an area of . However, over the decades of exploitation, the area under walnut trees was reduced. These forests are dense and large with particular species composition that have high economic value. Subsequent to World War II, in 1945, an experimental forest research station was reorganized at Arslanbob under the jurisdiction of the Forest Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the then USSR. The research was aimed at the establishment of commercial walnut plantations and maximizing production of fruit, valuable timber and other forest plantations. Reports indicated good results of walnut-fruit cultivation as a result of the joint research efforts.BlaserCarter1998,p.15BlaserCarter1998,p.88 Various wild forms of other fruit-bearing species including apple (Malus siversiana), pear (Pyrus korshinsky), and plum (Prunus sogdiana). ;Fauna Raccoons were introduced into the Arslanbob forest, now inhabiting an area of about in the western part of Achinsk district in Jalal-Abad Region. Culture A shrine (tomb) to Ibn Abbas, now in ruins, is near the forest. The 16th century mazar (shrine or tomb) to Arslanbob-Ata is near the center of the village. A new brick building, painted white, surrounds it and was built in the 20th century. The entrance to this tomb is made of a walnut wood door frame and decorated with ram‚Äôs horns. There is also a new mosque adjoining the tomb which has an impressive ceiling. The center of the tariqat of the indigenous Sufi order of the Hairy Ishans, and offshoot of Yasawiya is in the city of Arslanbob. ;Legends A legend has it that a disciple of Prophet Mohamed, on a voyage in search of a heavenly place on earth, found such a place in a scenic valley in Kyrgyzstan. However, as the place lacked any kind of vegetation, he appraised Prophet Mohamed of the situation. The Prophet Mohamed then sent him seeds of many trees to plant there which included walnut. The disciple, Arslanbob, then went up a mountain and scattered the seeds which grew into a garden of trees which he tended. Because of this association with the Prophet Mohamed, Muslims consider this place as sacred. According to local legend, it is said that Arslanbob-Ata's wife \\"betrayed\\" him to his enemies which resulted in his death. It is also stated that his footprints, hand prints and bloodstains are also seen here. Other legends include that Alexander the Great planted the first walnut trees in Arslanbob; and that he carried several sacks of walnuts with him which he had used to pay boatmen to ferry his troops. Another legend attributes walnut distribution to the Silk Road. Economy The economic activity of the town centers around the walnut. In the walnut season, which lasts for one month during September, the villagers of Arslanbob and other neighboring villages engage themselves in collecting the nut. For this purpose, they hire a small plot of land for a fee on a five-year lease from the Forest Department. They collect the nuts, fruits and the wood. It is also an occasion of social rejoicing. Walnuts are priced high as they are a source of \\"oil, protein, anti-oxidants and omega 3 fatty acids.\\" The walnut has served as barter trade in exchange for essential services. The barter practice is still observed in some cases in the villages here to pay fees to the teacher or to travel by bus. Other crops include maize, potatoes and sunflowers. Tourism The smaller of two waterfalls in Arslanbob Tourism is being developed in and around the Arslanbob city. While trekking is a fairly well established activity to the nearby hills and valleys, skiing as an adventure sport is under initial stages of development near the Jailoos mountains. Visiting the walnut wood land by walking through the village up to the red cliffs is also a popular tourist attraction during the season. There are two water falls which are frequented by visitors seeking holy blessings, magical and spiritual powers. The area around the falls is adorned with prayer flags and wish rags; one was frequented by a holy woman.

He was the executive producer and showrunner on Crash, executive producer on Syfy's Alphas, and a writer and co-executive producer on Outlander. Biography Behr was born in New York City to a Jewish family. He studied at Lehman College in New York City. After graduating, Behr moved to Los Angeles to pursue a screenwriting career. Career =Early work= Behr's first writing job was on the dramatic series Bret Maverick. Behr continued to work on television dramas, throughout the 1980s, among them: * Jessica Novak (1981, story editor) * Fame (1982, writer and producer) * Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1982, writer) * Bring 'Em Back Alive (1982, writer) * Once a Hero (1987, writer and producer) * The Bronx Zoo (1987, writer) =Star Trek= After several years writing and producing television, and while still a staff writer at Beyond Reality, Behr was hired as a producer during Star Trek: The Next Generations third season. Behr left The Next Generation after a year; but two years later, he rejoined Star Trek as a supervising producer on the new series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. At the start of the second season, Behr was promoted to co-executive producer. The following year, co-creator Michael Piller left to produce the next Star Trek series, Star Trek: Voyager and Behr replaced him as showrunner and executive producer. As showrunner, Behr reported to head executive producer and franchise chief Rick Berman. Behr went on to write a total of 53 episodes of Deep Space Nine, more than any other writer. As executive producer, Behr was largely responsible for the story arc of the show, from Bajoran politics to the Dominion War. This prolonged and complex story was a departure from the traditional Star Trek episodic format, and the war narrative was a break from the typically hopeful Star Trek vision of the future. Behr personally wrote or co-wrote some of the most important episodes in the Dominion arc, including \\"The Jem'Hadar\\", \\"The Search\\", \\"The Way of the Warrior\\", \\"Broken Link\\", \\"Apocalypse Rising\\", \\"In Purgatory's Shadow\\", \\"By Inferno's Light\\", \\"Call to Arms\\", \\"Sacrifice of Angels\\", \\"Tears of the Prophets\\" and the final episode, \\"What You Leave Behind\\". Developing the Ferengi Behr also had a significant role in the development of the Ferengi alien race during his work on Deep Space Nine. Although the Ferengi were first introduced in the first season of The Next Generation as a potential major antagonist, they proved unsuccessful, and in subsequent seasons became an occasional source of comic relief. But it was not until Deep Space Nine, which included a Ferengi character in its regular cast, that the Ferengi were truly explored in any depth. Behr was involved with most of the early Ferengi-related episodes, and introduced the concept of the Ferengi Rules of Acquisition and wrote most of the rules which appeared on the show. These rules were later published as The Ferengi Rules of Acquisition, by Quark as told to Ira Steven Behr (). Along with fellow Deep Space Nine producer Robert Hewitt Wolfe, Behr also co-wrote Legends of the Ferengi, a collection of short stories involving the Rules of Acquisition. Documentary Behr is the driving force behind the documentary What We Left Behind. =Post-Star Trek = Behr left Star Trek following the completion of Deep Space Nines seven season run in 1999, and has since worked on several television shows, including: * Dark Angel (2000, consulting producer) * Bob Patterson (2001, writer and executive producer) * The Twilight Zone (2002, writer and executive producer) * The 4400 (2004‚Äì2007, writer and executive producer) * Dr. Vegas (2004, writer and consulting producer) =Crash: Season 2= In February 2009, Behr was named head writer for the Starz TV series Crash (based on the Paul Haggis film) as it headed into Season 2, which aired in the fall of 2009. Lead actor Dennis Hopper died in May 2010 and the series did not continue. =Alphas= In late December 2010, Behr was appointed head writer, show runner, and executive producer for Syfy Channel's Alphas, for which a pilot, written by Zak Penn and Michael Karnow and directed by Jack Bender, had been produced. Behr oversaw the remaining 10 episodes of the 11 episode first season order. =Outlander= From 2014 to 2016 Behr served as writer and co-executive producer on Outlander, alongside fellow Deep Space 9 contributor Ronald D. Moore.

The enzymes catalyze the digestion of the food into molecules small enough to be taken up by passive diffusion, transport, osmotrophy or phagocytosis. Since digestion occurs outside the cell, it is said to be extracellular. It takes place either in the lumen of the digestive system, in a gastric cavity or other digestive organ, or completely outside the body. The prefix \\"extra\\" means \\"outside the thing \\", and indicates that extracellular digestion must occur outside the cell. During extracellular digestion, food is broken down outside the cell either mechanically or with acid by special molecules called enzymes. Then the newly broken down nutrients can be absorbed by the cells nearby. Humans use extracellular digestion when they eat. Their teeth grind the food up, enzymes and acid in the stomach liquefy it, and additional enzymes in the small intestine break the food down into parts their cells can use. Although fungi do not have a digestive tract like humans, they still use extracellular digestion. Fungi and other decomposers utilize nutrients derived from breaking down the substrate they grow on. Another example of extracellular digestion being used is in the hydra, or sea anemone. A large cavity, called the gastrovascular cavity, fills the center of the animal, with one opening for both food and waste. When unsuspecting prey swim into the opening, stinging cells paralyze the prey. The hydra uses its tentacles to push the prey further into the cavity, where enzymes are secreted to break down the food. Once the food is broken down extracellularly into nutrients, the cells of the hydra can absorb it for energy. Extracellular digestion is a form of digestion found in all saprobiontic annelids, crustaceans, arthropods, lichens and chordates, including vertebrates.Advanced Biology Principles, p296, fig 14.16‚ÄîDiagram detailing the re-absorption of substrates within the hypha.Advanced biology principles, p 296‚Äîstates the purpose of saprotrophs and their internal nutrition, as well as the main two types of fungi that are most often referred to, as well as describes, visually, the process of saprotrophic nutrition through a diagram of hyphae, referring to the Rhizobium on damp, stale whole- meal bread or rotting fruit.Clegg, C. J.; Mackean, D. G. (2006). Advanced Biology: Principles and Applications, 2nd ed. Hodder Publishing  In fungi  Fungi are heterotrophic organisms. Heterotrophic nutrition means that fungi utilize extracellular sources of organic energy, organic material or organic matter, for their maintenance, growth and reproduction. Energy is derived from the breakdown of the chemical bond between carbon and either carbon or other components of compounds such as a phosphate ion. The extracellular sources of energy may be simple sugars, polypeptides or more complex carbohydrate. Fungi can only absorb small molecules through their walls. For fungi to gain their energy needs, they find and absorb organic molecules appropriate to their needs, either immediately or following some form of enzyme diminution outside the thallus. The small molecules are then absorbed, used directly or reconstituted (transformed) into organic molecules within the cell. When a skeletonized leaf is seen in the litter, it is because recalcitrant materials remain and digestion is continuing. The fungi that utilize a variety of energy sources usually absorb the simplest compounds first, then the more complex. For instance, the formation of cellulose is repressed by high concentrations of glucose in the cytoplasm. On depletion of primary sources of glucose, enzymes to degrade more complex molecules such as cellulose and starch, are then released. Thus soluble sugars and amino acids are removed first from a leaf released from a tree. Starch is then broken down and absorbed. Subsequently, pectin and cellulose are digested. Finally, waxes are degraded and lignin oxidized. The staggering of energy acquisition results in the efficient utilization of available energy.  Detection of digestive enzymes in fungi  The regulation of nutrient acquisition appears to be controlled by general phenomena. Only a small group of enzymes, mostly hydrolases, can be detected in the culture filtrate of well-fed fungi. This suggests that specific inducers control the manufacture and release of enzymes for degradation. The most common complex carbohydrate available in the environment is cellulose. In the absence of glucose, detection of cellulose, for instance, induces the expression of celluloses. As a consequence, fungi specifically target the breakdown of the cellulose in their environment, and do not waste energy on the unnecessary formation of enzymes for degradation of molecules that may not be present. Fungi have an efficient process to gain energy. Because of the huge range of potential food sources, fungi have evolved enzymes suitable for the environments in which they are usually found. The range of enzymes, though wide in many species, is not sufficient for survival in all environments. Fungi require other competitive attributes to ensure continued survival. The opposite is also true. Some fungi have highly specific metabolic capabilities which enable occupation of specific habitats, utilizing molecules which are unavailable to other fungi. Further, utilization of a common and abundant substrate has led many fungi to evolve a range of highly specific degradative enzymes. Among the fungi are species that are generalist in their nutrient requirements, some that have specific nutrient requirements, and many that are in between.  Excretion of digestive enzymes  Lycoperdon perlatum Enzymes are manufactured close to the hyphal tip. Some are packaged in vesicles associated with the Golgi and then delivered to the hyphal tip. The contents are released at the tip. Some enzymes are actively excreted through the plasma membrane, where they diffuse through or act in the cell wall. Note that the enzymes released from the hyphal tip require an aqueous environment for release and subsequent degradative activity. = Absorption of digested products = The molecules absorbed through the plasma membrane tend to be smaller than 5,000 Da, so only simple sugars, amino acids, fatty acids and other small molecules can be taken up following digestion. The molecules are taken up in solution. In some cases, the molecules are processed by enzymes located within the cell wall. For instance, sucrose inverters have been localized in walls of yeasts. Glucose appears to be the sugar preferred by most fungi. Uptake of other sugars is repressed when glucose is available. Similarly, ammonium, glutamine and asparagine regulate the uptake of nitrogen compounds, and cysteine of sulphur compounds.  Joint intracellular and extracellular digestion in cnidarians  Cnidarian polyp Joint intracellular and extracellular digestion In hydra and other cnidarians, the food is caught by the tentacles and ingested through the mouth into the single large digestive cavity, the gastrovascular cavity. Enzymes are secreted from the cells bordering this cavity and poured on the food for extracellular digestion. Small particles of the partially digested food are engulfed into the vacuoles of the digestive cells for intracellular digestion. Any undigested and un-absorbed food is finally thrown out of the mouth.  Invert digestive systems are bags and tubes  Single-celled organisms as well as sponges digest their food intracellularly. Other multi-cellular organisms digest their food extracellularly, within a digestive cavity. In this case the digestive enzymes are released into a cavity that is continuous with the animal's external environment. In cnidarians and in flatworms such as planarians, the digestive cavity, called a gastrovascular cavity, has only one opening that serves as both mouth and anus. There is no specialization within this type of digestive system because every cell is exposed to all stages of food digestion. Specializing occurs when the digestive tract or alimentary canal has a separate mouth and anus so that transport of food is one-way. The most primitive digestive tract is seen in nematodes (phylum Nematode), where it is simply a tubular gut lined by an epithelial membrane. Earthworms (phylum Annelids) have a digestive tract specialized in different regions for the ingestion, storage, fragmentation, digestion and absorption of food. All more complex animal groups, including all vertebrates, show similar specializations. The ingested food may be stored in a specialized region of the digestive tract or subjected to physical fragmentation. This fragmentation may occur through the chewing action of teeth (in the mouth of many vertebrates) or the grinding action of pebbles (in the gizzard of earthworms and birds). Chemical digestion then occurs, breaking down the larger food molecules of polysaccharides and disaccharides, fats, and proteins into their smallest sub-units. Chemical digestion involves hydrolysis reactions that liberate the sub unit molecules‚Äîprimarily monosaccharides, amino acids and fatty acids‚Äîfrom the food. These products of chemical digestion pass through the epithelial lining of the gut into the blood, in a process known as absorption. Any molecules in the food that are not absorbed cannot be used by the animal. These waste products are excreted, or defecated from the anus.  Extracellular digestion in other animals  = Annelids = A piscicolid leech The echiuran gut is long and highly convoluted, and there is no gut in pogonophoran adults. Among other annelids, the gut is linear and unsegmented, with a mouth opening on the peristomium and an anus opening at the posterior end of the animal (pygidium). Food is moved through the gut by cilia and/or by muscular contractions. Digestion is primarily extracellular, although some species show an intracellular component as well. = Arthropods = The arthropod digestive system is divisible into three areas: the fore gut, mid gut, and hind gut. All free-living species exhibit a distinct and separate mouth and anus, and in all species, food must be moved through the digestive tract by muscular activity rather than cilia activity since the lumen of the fore gut and hind gut is lined with cuticle. Digestion is generally extracellular. Nutrients are distributed to the tissues through the hemal system. = Molluscs = Bottom view of a chiton Most molluscs have a complete digestive system with a separate mouth and anus. The mouth leads into a short esophagus which leads to a stomach. Associated with the stomach are one or more digestive glands or digestive caeca. Digestive enzymes are secreted into the lumen of these glands. Additional extracellular digestion takes place in the stomach. In cephalopods, digestion is entirely extracellular. In the most other mollusks, the terminal stages of digestion are completed intracellularly, within the tissue of the digestive glands. The absorbed nutrients enter the circulatory system for distribution throughout the body or are stored in the digestive glands for later use. Undigested waste pass through an intestine and out through the anus. Other aspects of food collection and processing have already been discussed where appropriate for each group. = Humans = Extracellular digestion in humans occurs from the mouth to the stomach The initial components of the gastrointestinal tract are the mouth and the pharynx, which is the common passage of the oral and nasal cavities. The pharynx leads to the esophagus, a muscular tube that delivers food to the stomach, where some preliminary digestion occurs; here, the digestion is extracellular. From the stomach, food passes to the small intestine, where a battery of digestive enzymes continue the digestive process. The products of digestion are absorbed across the wall of the intestine into the bloodstream. What remains is emptied into the large intestine, where some of the remaining water and minerals are absorbed; here the digestion is intracellular.

The transmitter is located on the campus of Tulane University. The station, which is owned by Tulane University, offers a mix of cutting-edge, progressive, alternative, electronica, classical, New Age, straight ahead jazz, folk, blues Latin, world reggae, show tunes, kids' show, and an eclectic mix of a variety of genres. History WTUL was established on March 14, 1959. It is the station which gave future mayor-turned TV news anchor-turned talk show host Jerry Springer his start. The yearly \\"Rock On Survival Marathon\\" fund raisers featuring live bands on the Tulane campus are a locally famous event. In spite of the low wattage, WTUL was occasionally picked up as far away as New York City in its early years due to the limited number of stations operating on the FM band. \\"Mother- in-Law\\" singer Ernie K-Doe was a DJ at WTUL for many years. WTUL went off the air on August 28, 2005, as Hurricane Katrina approached the New Orleans area. The Tulane campus building which housed the station (itself a temporary location due to the renovation of the University Center) was damaged by the resulting flood waters. On December 15, 2005, the station began broadcasting again, using donated studio space on the mezzanine of the Rue de la Course coffeehouse in the Carrollton neighborhood of uptown New Orleans, about 10 blocks from the Tulane campus. The station kept its Internet broadcast running via donated bandwidth from CCRMA at Stanford University. The station continued a limited broadcast until it moved to Uptown Square at the corner of Broadway Street and Leake Avenue. It now broadcasts on a normal 24-hour schedule from a new studio in the basement of the Lavin-Bernick Center for University Life on the Tulane campus. WTUL is volunteer-run, accepting DJs from across the Tulane and New Orleans community.

Home to over 336 male and female undergraduate students, postgraduate students, resident Fellows and graduate residents. The College, governed by its own elected Council, is situated within the campus of the University of Sydney. Set in its own picturesque grounds, it has offered residency, academic and social support to students for 150 years. St Andrew's offers a unique opportunity to experience University life to the full. The College enables students to get the most out of their University education ‚Äì a combination of intellectual independence, academic support from the Residential Life team and personal development through involvement in Students‚Äô Club activities such as a wide range of sporting, philanthropic and cultural activities and the gift of lifelong friendships. The St Andrew's College Incorporation Act received Royal Assent in 1867 in the 31st year of the reign of Queen Victoria and was only replaced by an updated Act as recently as 1998. 1867 is therefore the date taken as the College's foundation, and in 2017 the College celebrated its sesquicentenary as Australia's third oldest university college. In 1870 the College Council first met and in 1876 the students entered the grand sandstone Scottish baronial building now known as the Main Building. The College is a non- denominational independent institution of Protestant origins situated upon its own sub-grant of Crown Land and governed by a Council under the St Andrew's College Act 1998. Diversity of faith is genuinely welcome. History St Andrew's College was incorporated by Act of Parliament and received Royal Assent from Queen Victoria on 12 December 1867. The St Andrew's College Act 1998SAINT ANDREW'S COLLEGE ACT 1998 replaced the St Andrews Incorporation Act 1867. This change means the Principal may be member of the laity and the religious affiliation of councillors has been broadened to include all Protestants. Adam Thompson became the first Principal of St Andrew's in 1872. He was a graduate of the University of Edinburgh who had come from his Hawick parish to Sydney in 1861. The College Council first met in 1870 and the first 16 students began their studies in 1874, even before the Main building was completed in 1878. Increasing demand for places led to the opening of additions to the College in 1892 (Sulman Wing), and in 1907 and 1914 (Vaucluse extensions). The student population increased to 140 in 1953 when the Reid building was completed, to 200 when the Thyne building was opened in 1966 and again to 272 when the Hanks Building was completed in 2007. St Andrew's College The College occupies 4 hectares of land within the main campus of the University of Sydney and was built on a sub-grant of University Land. Whilst the Theological Hall of the Presbyterian Church in New South Wales, now the Presbyterian Theological Centre, was without home, St Andrew's College allowed its members to live at the College (until it relocated to Burwood in 1983). In 2001, the College Council resolved to admit female undergraduates for the first time, with the first such students taking up residence at the commencement of the 2002 academic year.:: St Andrews College :: Timeline Its motto Christo, ecclesiae, litteris is Latin for For Christ, for the church, for scholarship. Every year, the College men compete for a sporting trophy, commonly known as the Rawson Cup, which was presented to the Sydney University Sports Union in 1906 by Admiral Sir Harry Rawson, and is the height of male intercollegiate sport. The cup is fought for throughout the year by men representing each of the University of Sydney Colleges accumulating points by competing in cricket, rowing, swimming, rugby, tennis, soccer, basketball and athletics. St Andrew's has enjoyed sustained recent success, winning the Rawson Cup in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016. St Andrew's has won the Rawson Cup more often than all the other colleges combined. Since 2002, the College women have competed for their equivalent sporting trophy, the Macrae Archdale Cup, known as \\"The Rosebowl\\". The Rosebowl is contested by the five colleges that admit women. It consists of the sports of rowing, swimming, netball, hockey, tennis, basketball, soccer and athletics. The College won the Rosebowl for the first time in 2006, and also for the last nine years 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017. The College has had unrivalled success in the Palladian Cup, winning the annual inter-college performing arts competition in 2017 for the third time in five years, and more often than all other colleges combined since the Cup's inception in 2001. =Heresy Conviction Controversy= Scottish born Peter Cameron was appointed Principal of St Andrew's College in 1991, and thus became a minister in the Presbyterian Church of Australia. In 1993 while serving as Principal, Cameron was convicted by the Presbyterian Church of Australia of Heresy. He was charged for disagreeing with the first chapter of the Westminster Confession of Faith (which as a minister of the Presbyterian Church of Australia, he was required \\"firmly and constantly to adhere thereto and to the utmost of [his] power to maintain and defend\\"Vows - An Introduction to the Presbyterian Church of Australia, the Code Committee of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of Australia ) by questioning the writings of Paul in the New Testament. The charge related to a sermon that he preached on 2 March 1992 called 'The Place of Women in the Church' to 300 members of a Presbyterian women's organisation. In the sermon, Cameron supported the ordination of women to the ministry, criticised the Church's hard line on homosexuality, and attacked fundamentalist Christianity in general (Jensen, nd)Rod Jensen, review of Peter Cameron, Heretic, at Sea of Faith in Australia (SoFiA) http://www.sof-in-australia.org/heretic.htm (de Maria, 1999)Bill de Maria, (1999), Chapter 5: Religious Dissenter: Peter Cameron and the Heresy Trial, in Deadly Disclosures, Wakefield Press, Kent Town, Today St Andrew's College is home to 336 male and female undergraduate and graduate students and resident Fellows. All of the undergraduate students are members of the Students' Club, and the Junior Common Room. These are governed by an elected body of students, the House Committee. The College is also home to 22 graduate students. These students are members of the Senior Common Room. They contribute greatly to the College's extensive tutorial program which covers as many of the subjects the University offers as it can. Residential members of the Senior Common Room are allowed to compete for selection on the College sporting teams. There are also University academics who reside at the College and are members of the Senior Common Room. =Facilities= The Junior Common Room is home to the College's fully licensed bar known as the \\"Highlander\\". This bar operates under the direction of the Principal, with a member of the Senior Common Room as licensee, but is fully staffed and run by and for the Students' Club and its members, and aims to operate profitably each year. St Andrew's has excellent libraries, a Chapel, computer room, common rooms, photocopying and facsimile facilities, individual internet connections and room telephones with voicemail, a full-size oval, gymnasium and unrivalled sporting and social opportunities. It is supported by an Alumni Society and a Foundation Trust. Former residents have advanced to become Rhodes Scholars, Cambridge Commonwealth Trust Scholars, University Medallists, international sports people, professors, university Chancellors and Vice-Chancellors, highly successful business people, industrialists, financiers and respected members of every profession. =Intercol= Intercollegiate competitions in sport and the arts are contested annually by the residential colleges within the University of Sydney. Each St Andrew's success in Rawson, Rosebowl and Palladian events is celebrated by all students in the College with a Victory Dinner in the Dining Hall. In 2013 and again in 2015, St Andrew's College made history by claiming all four Cups (Rawson, Rosebowl, Palladian and University) in the Intercol competition. In 2014 and 2016, St Andrew's took out the Rawson, Rosebowl and University Cups and placed 2nd in the Palladian competition. =Students' Club= St Andrew's College Students‚Äô Club is the representative body for the undergraduate residents of St Andrew's College and the House Committee is its governing body. The history of the St Andrew's Students‚Äô Club dates back as early as 1896. The first Senior Student was elected in 1896 and the Students‚Äô Club was emerging in embryonic form by 1901. Some time after 1902, a Students‚Äô Club constitution was adopted in which the students undertook the duty of controlling the students‚Äô Common Room, recreation, social life and sport. It is clear that by 1906 the Students‚Äô Club was in full operation; with annual elections for Senior Student, Secretary, Treasurer and year representatives. By 1910 then House Committee included nine members, and sub-committees began to form to organise various Students‚Äô Club activities, in a manner similar to today. The Students‚Äô Club manages a comprehensive schedule of social events during the academic year, on a college-only basis, or in conjunction with the University of Sydney's intercollegiate community. The Constitution of St Andrew's College Students‚Äô Club can be found here. The House Committee is composed of the following roles: * The Senior Student * Honorary Treasurer * Honorary Secretary * Honorary Assistant Treasurer (HAT) * Alumni Liaison * Intercollege representatives * Social & Cultural representatives * Sporting representatives * fResher representatives The House Committee members are democratically elected by their peers at the end of the preceding academic year.  Buildings  At present, the College comprises 4 main buildings, as well as a number of smaller ones. \\"Main\\" is the oldest of these, and was extended with the addition of the Sulman and Vaucluse wings. Further extensions on Main were carried out in the 1960s, and now it not only houses 90 students‚Äô rooms, but has the college's dining hall, library, reading room, Junior and Senior Common Rooms, administration offices, the Kinross-Mackie Chapel and a number of tutorial rooms. Main predominantly houses freshers and sophomores. \\"Reid\\" is the second oldest building, and was opened in 1953, when it was simply known as the New Building. It is typically home to both Sophomores and Seniors. The Thyne Building was opened in 1966, the same year as the College's oval was constructed. This building typically houses freshers and Sophomores. The Hanks Building (referred to by students as \\"New Wing\\") was completed in 2007; it is home to only seniors and above. The rooms in this building are much larger and all have bathrooms. The College also has a number of smaller buildings, such as the Harper Lodge (where high-ranking members such as the Vice-Principal live), the Dougan Lodge (a.k.a. the Bird's Cage, where the Principal lives), the Old Laboratory (a.k.a. the Country Club, which houses graduates, and is next to the tennis courts), the Gatehouse and Sulman Wing (graduate housing).

The central flatland area of the basin, known as the Guanzhong Plain, is made up of alluvial plains along the lower Wei River and its numerous tributaries and thus also called the Wei River Plain. The region is part of the Jin-Shaan Basin Belt, and is separated from its geological sibling ‚Äî the Yuncheng Basin to its northeast ‚Äî by the Yellow River section southwest of the L√ºliang Mountains and north of the river's bend at the tri- provincial junction among Shaanxi, Shanxi and Henan. The name Guanzhong means \\"within the passes\\", referring to the four major mountain pass fortresses historically defending the region. The region was the traditional heartland of Qin state during Zhou Dynasty and thus often nicknamed the \\"800 li of Qin land\\". The Yellow River, L√ºliang Mountains and the eastern end of the Qinling separate the region from the (then) politically orthodox Central Plain, which is located east of the strategic Hangu Pass and therefore was historically referred as the Guandong (\\"east of the pass\\") region by the Qin people, who later conquered the eastern states and unified China as a centralized empire ‚Äî the Qin dynasty ‚Äî for the first time during the 3rd century BC. Afterwards, subsequent prominent dynasties such as the Han and Tang (both considered China's historical golden ages) also had the crownland established in the Guanzhong region. Geography The four major historic fortified passes that enclose Guanzhong region are: * Hangu Pass (in present day Lingbao City) to the east * Wu Pass (in present day Danfeng County) to the southeast, * Xiao Pass (in present day Jingyuan County) to the northwest, and * Dasan Pass (in present day Chencang District) to the west Two more passes were later added, namely the Tong Pass (in present day Tongguan County) in the east, built during the late Eastern Han dynasty by warlord Cao Cao; and Jinsuo Pass (in present day Yintai District) in the north, built during the Tang dynasty. Historically the most important pass was the Hangu Pass along the Yellow River which separates Guanzhong from the North China Plain. Guanzhong includes the central part of Shaanxi and the extreme west of modern Henan. The average altitude of the Guanzhong Plain is around . Xi'an, the capital of Shaanxi province and the largest city in Northwest China, is located at the center of the region. Other major prefectural cities in the Guanzhong region also include Baoji, Xianyang, Tongchuan and Weinan. History China during the warring states period. Guanzhong (Qin) is the southeast corner of the rectangle formed by the Yellow and Wei rivers. The Guanzhong region became the heartland of the Zhou after Jƒ´ clan leader Gugong Danfu relocated his people south from Bin (modern day Binzhou, Shaanxi) to evade the violent raidings by Xunyu, Xianyun and Di nomads. It is from Guanzhong region that the Zhou state prospered and eventually conquered the Shang dynasty to establish the Zhou dynasty in 1046 BC. After the Quanrong nomads, with collaboration from Marquess of Shen, killed King You of Zhou and sacked the Zhou capital Haojing in 771 BC, the Western Zhou dynasty collapsed and the surviving Zhou court fled east to Luoyi. The Y√≠ng clan, then a minor marcher vassal based in the Longxi Basin as a buffer state on the western frontier of the Chinese civilization, sent troops to escort King Ping of Zhou along the journey. In gratitude, King Ping granted a mid-level nobility to the Y√≠ng leader, Count Xiang, and promised him authority to permanently claim any lands his clan can recapture from the nomads. The resultant Qin state then spent the next few centuries fighting off various nomads to its north and west and eventually consolidated its base in the Guanzhong Plain and the Loess Plateau. The Qin capital then relocated progressively east from Qinyi (in modern Qingshui County, Gansu) to Yong (in modern Fengxiang County, Shaanxi), then to Yueyang (in modern Yanliang District of Xi'an, Shaanxi), and eventually to Xianyang northeastly across the Wei River from the ruined old Zhou capital of Fenghao. Four passes were then built to defend this new heartland against hostile attacks from both the east and the west. During the Warring States period, Qin grew powerful under Shang Yang's legalist reforms, and militarily became increasingly more successful, and its rivals to the east claimed that the Qin army was a \\"troop of tigers and wolves\\", and it was often said that \\"Guanzhong produces generals; Guandong produces ministers\\". After constructing irrigation systems such as Zhengguo Canal, the already fertile Guanzhong region became extremely productive, allowing Qin state to become the preeminent power, repeatedly defeating and seizing more territory from its rivals to the east, and eventually unified China and established the Qin dynasty in 221 BC. After First Emperor's death, the Qin dynasty soon fell into chaos due to the corrupt rule of Qin Er Shi and Zhao Gao, and various rebellions broke out. In 206 BC, the rebel leader Liu Bang successfully invaded Guanzhong and forced the last Qin ruler, Ziying, to surrender the capital Xianyang, ending the Qin dynasty. Liu Bang entered the capital peacefully, and issued strict orders forbidding his troops from harming the locals. However, he was forced to hand over the control over to another more powerful rebel leader Xiang Yu, who pillaged and torched Xianyang and enfeoffed the Guanzhong region to three surrendered Qin generals Zhang Han, Sima Xin and Dong Yis, collectively known as the \\"Three Qins\\". However, merely four month later, Liu Bang returned with his newly appointed generalissimo Han Xin and reconquered the Guanzhong region, and used it as his base to eventually defeat Xiang Yu in the subsequent civil war. After establishing the Han dynasty, Liu Bang created a new capital named Chang'an, which is just across the Wei River from the ruined Qin capital Xianyang. Since the Western Zhou dynasty, the area was the capital region of China for a total of 12 dynasties including the Qin, Western Han, Sui, and Tang. By the Tang dynasty the economic center of China had shifted south to the Yangtze basin and Guanzhong became increasingly dependent on supplies transported via the Grand Canal. After the destruction of Chang'an in the last years of the Tang, Guanzhong became less significant politically as well as economically in later dynasties.ÂÜÄÊúùÈºéËëóÔºåÊú±Ë©©È∞≤Ë≠Ø„Ää‰∏≠ÂúãÊ≠∑Âè≤‰∏äÁöÑÂü∫Êú¨Á∂ìÊøüÂçÄËàáÊ∞¥Âà©‰∫ãÊ•≠ÁöÑÁôºÂ±ï„Äã(Âåó‰∫¨: ‰∏≠ÂúãÁ§æÊúÉÁßëÂ≠∏Âá∫ÁâàÁ§æ, 1981) pp. 75-76.

The Bigfoot series was notable for deviating from the standard form factor for hard drives. While most desktop hard drives at that time used a 3.5-inch physical format, Quantum Bigfoot drives used a larger 5.25-inch form factor more commonly seen in older hard drives, CD-ROM and other optical disc drives. This form factor allowed Quantum to increase the capacity of their hard drives without an increase in data density, thus lowering costs compared to a 3.5-inch drive with the same capacity. It also allowed manufacturers and owners to install the hard drive above or below the optical drive in the computer, as the typical computer had multiple 5.25-inch bays. Overview The main rationale behind the use of the 5.25-inch form factor was that the typical PC user already owns cases that supports 5.25-inch drives, and by using lower data densities and fewer moving parts, Quantum was able to deliver the products at lower prices, thus more competitively. Initially, performance in the Bigfoot drives generally lagged behind most other drives of the era, but the large data capacities earned inclusion in many OEM PCs such as ones manufactured by Compaq and HP, as well as popularity with the PC enthusiast community. IBM also used Bigfoot drives in some of their Aptiva PCs even though they were also a major manufacturer of hard drives. Over time, the data density (and therefore the overall capacity) of the drives increased, culminating in the 19.2 GB Bigfoot TS, easily the largest consumer-grade drive available at its release. A side effect of the increased data density was an increase in speed, moving the Bigfoot to middle- of-the-pack status amongst its contemporaries. Unfortunately, the increased manufacturing cost associated with the higher density also caused an increase in price, moving the Bigfoot towards a premium price. Over time, increased prices combined with stiff competition caused sales of the drives to decline, leading to the line being discontinued in the late 1990s. Bigfoot drives were produced by a variety of different plants in Malaysia, Singapore, Japan and other locations. They were among the first to support Logical Block Addressing (LBA) and Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology (S.M.A.R.T.) monitoring. Series Four distinct series of Quantum Bigfoot drives were produced over time, with differences in capacity, spindle speed, access time and supported interface speed. =Quantum Bigfoot (original series) = right The first generation Quantum Bigfoot drives were introduced around May 1996 and offered in capacities of 1.2 GB (1 platter, 2 heads) and 2.5 GB (2 platters, 4 heads), with suggested retail prices of $225 and $370 respectively. These drives offered only ATA-2 PIO Mode 4 and DMA mode 2 support (16.6 MBps) and had an average seek time of 15 ms. Actual transfer rate from the platters was much lower, measured at 813 KB/s by PC Magazine using Disk WinMark 96, slower than a same-capacity/similar-capacity Quantum Fireball (3.5\\") drive, which delivered 1170 KB/s. =Quantum Bigfoot CY= right The second series was the Quantum Bigfoot CY series, introduced around December 1996. Bigfoot CY drives shared the characteristics of a 3,600 RPM spindle speed and an ATA-2 interface connection. These drives had one to three 2.1 GB platters, and were produced in capacities of 2.1 GB, 4.3 GB and 6.4 GB. Their access time was advertised as being \\"as low as 12ms,\\" and they had 128 KB of cache. The suggested retail prices were $224, $310 and $395, respectively. The largest drive of the CY series could transfer about 6 MB/sec from the platters when tested with \`hdparm -t\` in Linux. =Quantum Bigfoot TX= The third series of Bigfoot drives was known as the Quantum Bigfoot TX series. This series increased the drives' spindle speed to 4,000 RPM and upgraded their interface capabilities to ATA-66. These drives carried the higher capacities of 4 GB, 6 GB, 8 GB and 12 GB. Like the CY series, access time was advertised as under 12 ms. The 12 GB model is noteworthy for being the first hard drive to attain a capacity in the double digits of gigabytes. Quantum claimed that these drives could outperform many of the 3.5-inch drives on the market at the time. =Quantum Bigfoot TS= right The fourth and final series of Quantum Bigfoot drives produced was the Bigfoot TS series. This series retained the spindle speed and interface speed of its predecessor. The main performance enhancement was a reduction in access time, to \\"less than 10.5 ms.\\" It was produced in capacities of 6.4 GB, 8.4 GB, 10.0 GB, 12.7 GB and 19.2 GB. With this series, Quantum again claimed to have the highest capacity on the market with its 19.2 GB model. These drives had a new \\"shock protection system\\" designed to make the drives more resilient to physical shock, which Quantum called \\"one of the leading killers of disk drives.\\" StorageReview found that this series was significantly faster than the TX series, though not as fast as most 3.5-inch drives available at the time. They also found it to be significantly louder than the TX series during use. References External links * Disassembled Bigfoot 6505AT photos (Text in Portuguese.

It is based on the 1982 board game Borderlands by Eon Productions and developed by Eon's software division. It was marketed with the slogan \\"Better than Risk!\\" The original version of the game was programmed for the Apple II in Forth and assembly language by Ted Schmeckpeper, in collaboration with the designers of the board game: Bill Eberle, Jack Kittredge, and Peter Olotka. It was released for the Apple II as well as ports to the Commodore 64, Atari 8-bit family, Atari ST, and MS-DOS. Ted Schmeckpeper died in 2019 at the age of 74. Gameplay =Game phases= The game is a contest between two and seven players, of which any number may be human or computer players. Each player is given a specific color, which matches their territories. Computer players can be selected to be Aggressive, Defensive, or Passive in their style of play. The human player(s) then must select how random the odds of an attack are, the amount of resources in the game, and the amount of land vs. water. Additionally, the Victory Conditions are also chosen; of which is the building of three to eight cities. Territories are then selected one at a time amongst the players, until all are selected or a remainder is left that is at least one less than the number of players, which are left black. After territory selection, the game then moves on to the Production phase, where all the resources per player are tallied and \\"put\\" into the stockpile. There is a 25% chance for the Production phase to be skipped on any turn. If it is the first turn, players then place their stockpiles in a territory. Next comes Trade, where players may trade any resources they have for resources they wish. All five resources may be traded, but note that horses must have a territory to \\"land on\\" to be accepted. The next phase is Shipment, where the stockpile may be moved. Alternatively, a horse, weapon, or boat may be moved. Note that you may ship a weapon with a horse, or a weapon and/or horse with a boat! There is a 25% chance for the Shipment phase to be skipped on any turn. The fifth phase is Conquest, where you may make up to two attacks on any valid territory. The final phase is Development, where you may buy cities, weapons, or boats. =Resources and units= After the final territory is selected, the players place stockpiles on the map. The stockpile may be moved once a turn if there is a transport phase, or instead of attacking another player. The stockpile holds all of a player's resources, and if the territory it is located in is taken, those resources are forfeited to the attacking player. There are five kinds of resources: coal, gold, iron, timber, and horses. Control of each territory with a resource at the beginning of the turn yields one unit of the resource into the stockpile. At the end of the turn boats, cities, or weapons may be purchased. During combat, the offensive and defensive odds are computed by taking the sum of all territories that touch the territory in question. Therefore, if a defending territory is touched by only one other territory of the same color and three of the attacking player, the offensive:defensive strength is 3:2, meaning the attack will succeed. Other factors can change the combat strengths of the opposing forces, including: *Boats - Boats have a strength of 2 each. During an attack, Boats may carry one horse and/or one weapon, for a maximum increase in strength of 6. For defensive purposes, each Boat raises the territory defense by 2. A Boat costs 3 wood (or 3 Gold) to build, and there may be multiple boats in a territory, one per piece of coastline the territory possesses. Boats have no movement point limits, but they can't cross land to enter other bodies of water or dock at territories with no open coast tiles. *Cities - Cities are the key to the game. Besides quantifying victory, Cities double the production of all resources in the territory they are built OR are touching, except Horses. Cities add 2 to the owner's strength. A City costs a Coal, a Gold, an Iron, & a Tree (OR 4 Gold) to build, and there may be only one City per territory. *Horses - Horses are unique among the resources as they are not a stockpiled good, but rather expand on the map. A Horse is produced in the territory that has the herd icon, or in an adjoining territory. A Horse adds 1 to combat strength, and there may be only one Horse per territory. A horse may move up to 2 spaces to participate in an attack, and may carry a weapon with it or pick one up along the way, giving a maximum strength bonus of 4. *Weapons - Weapons are bought like Boats or Cities. A weapon adds 3 to the strength of a territory. A weapon costs a Coal and an Iron (or 2 Gold) to build, and there may be only one weapon per territory. Weapons have a move of 1. =Conquest and victory= In combat, the side with the highest strength wins; that is, one only needs to outnumber the opponent. The resolution of ties depends on a setting at the beginning of the game. High odds means the attacker wins ties, low odds means the defender wins ties, and Random means there is a 50:50 chance of either side winning. When initiating an attack, it is possible to bring in up to one unit from another territory. If this unit is adjacent to the territory being attacked, there is no bonus; the unit is already part of the combat strength. (Exception: Boats don't add into an attack unless they're brought into the attack.) If the unit brought in is NOT from an adjacent territory, its strength will be added AND, upon successful conquest, will be placed in the territory. A Horse is capable of bringing along a Weapon, giving a boost of 1 or 4 to combat strength. A horse can also pick up a weapon from a territory it is traveling through or its origin, but if such a Weapon is taken from an adjacent territory, the only gain will be 1 for the Horse (assuming it wasn't also adjacent) and having the units in place in the territory after the attack is resolved (assuming the attacker wins). A Boat can bring a Horse and/or a Weapon, giving up to 6 additional points of strength, assuming the Horse and Weapon weren't from an adjacent territory. Boats can travel anywhere along a given body of water, making them very powerful. Boats cannot pick up other units en route like the Horse can. Boats MUST be able to reach a coastal tile of the target territory; if all coastals tiles are blocked by other Boats (even Boats in adjacent territories occupying the wrong tile), the Boat cannot be used in the attack. Only one of a given land unit can occupy a territory. It is possible to capture enemy units if a player doesn't bring his own in. Boats are special in that you can have more than one Boat on a territory. Each player may attack twice in any one round. If a player chooses to move his stockpile on the first attack, he loses the second. Likewise, if the first attack fails, the second is also lost. Additionally, other players adjacent to the defending territory may choose to side with the offense or the defense and throw in their combat strength to that side. The game is over when one side builds the number of cities listed as the victory condition, or when all territories have been taken over by a single player. Note that if more than one player exceeds the number of cities required for victory, the game continues until one side falls under that number. Reception Compute!'s Gazette called Lords of Conquest \\"a classic strategy game ... highly enjoyable\\". Computer Gaming World in 1986 stated that it might be too simple for veteran wargamers, but \\"offers a quick and pleasant break from complex simulations\\" and was good for newcomers. In 1990 the magazine gave the game four-plus stars out of five, calling it \\"a classic wargame ... easy to learn and play\\" but cautioning that the 16-bit versions did not use their computers' power. In 1993 the magazine gave it three-plus stars. GameSpy awarded Lords of Conquest a retrospective \\"Gotcha\\" award as one of the top games of its era.

Hochuli (; born December 25, 1950) is an American attorney and retired American football official. He has served as an attorney at Jones, Skelton & Hochuli, P.L.C. since 1983, and was an official in the National Football League (NFL) from 1990 to 2017; his uniform number was 85. Prior to his officiating career, he played college football for four seasons at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). Hochuli worked numerous playoff games, including two Super Bowls. He is best known for his athletic/muscular physique (height: ; weight: ), and for explaining on-field rulings in a manner that is comprehensive yet also clear and concise. In a poll conducted by ESPN in 2008, Hochuli tied fellow referee Mike Carey for \\"best referee\\" votes (eight each) among NFL head coaches. In his 28th season in the league and 26th as a referee (crew chief) with the 2017 NFL season, Hochuli's officiating crew consisted of umpire Shawn Smith, down judge Greg Bradley, line judge Rusty Baynes, field judge Dale Shaw, side judge Alex Kemp, and back judge Scott Helverson. After the retirements of Gerald Austin and Larry Nemmers following the 2007 season, Hochuli became the NFL's longest-tenured referee for the next decade. He announced his own retirement in March 2018. The following year, his son Shawn Hochuli ‚Äî previously a referee in the Arena Football League and a back judge in the NFL ‚Äî was promoted to referee. Personal life =Early life= Hochuli was born on December 25, 1950, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and lived there until age eight before his family moved to Tucson, Arizona. He was the second child of six. He attended and later graduated from Canyon del Oro High School in the Tucson suburb of Oro Valley, Arizona in 1969. During his high school years, he participated in football (earning all-state honors twice), basketball, wrestling, and track. He attributes his competitive nature to having an older brother, Chip Hochuli. Ed Hochuli told Referee in a 2004 interview, \\"I was somebody who wanted to be good and I wanted my brother to be proud of me, and I wanted my parents to be proud of me.\\" Following high school, he earned his Bachelor of Arts degree with honors from the University of Texas at El Paso in 1972. While at UTEP, Hochuli played linebacker on the school's football team from 1969 to 1972. As a football player, he earned All- Western Athletic Conference academic honors in 1972. His father, Walter Hochuli, was involved with law as a wills and estate planner, which influenced Ed Hochuli to pursue a career in law. He earned his Juris Doctor from the University of Arizona Law School in 1976. While in law school, Hochuli served as a law clerk for two years under United States District Judge Carl Muecke. Upon completion of his education, Hochuli was admitted to the State Bar of Arizona. =Family= Hochuli resides in the Phoenix metropolitan area with his wife Cathie. They have six children and 10 grandchildren. Of the six, Shawn Hochuli played college football at Pitzer College and is following his father's profession as an official, working his first NFL season in 2014 as a side judge, Arena Football League, and arenafootball2 games. On August 13, 2011, a day after his father refereed a preseason game between the New England Patriots and Jacksonville Jaguars, Shawn was head referee for ArenaBowl XXIV between the Jacksonville Sharks and Arizona Rattlers. Scott Hochuli owns Hochuli Design & Remodeling Team., a company that specializes in residential design and construction in the Phoenix area. He is married to Lorrie Hochuli and has two daughters: Devan and Ryann. His brother, Daniel Hochuli, is the town attorney for Sahuarita, Arizona, and his brother Peter Hochuli is a judge at the Pima County Juvenile Court in Tucson, Arizona. =Attorney= Hochuli is a trial lawyer and a partner in the Arizona law firm of Jones, Skelton and Hochuli, P.L.C. since it was founded in 1983. The firm started with five partners and seven associates, and has expanded to over 80 attorneys. Hochuli specializes in civil litigation in the areas of Bad Faith and Extra- Contractual Liability, Complex Litigation, Insurance Coverage and Fraud, Legal Malpractice and Professional Liability, Product Liability Defense, Trucking and Transportation Industry Defense, and Wrongful Death and Personal Injury Defense, and claims to be involved in 200 cases at any time. Hochuli finds interest in trying cases, calling it an \\"adrenaline rush\\" and adding, \\"You love that challenge ‚Äì the competition, if you will ‚Äì of it. It's a game. It's obviously a very important game to people, and I don't mean to diminish the importance of it. ... You have to follow these rules, and there's a win-or- lose outcome. You're on a stage.\\" He is admitted to practice in Arizona state and federal courts and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. His recognition as an attorney includes being named Best Lawyers in America since 2003 and Southwest Super Lawyers in 2007. Super Lawyers includes only the top five percent of lawyers in a state based on point totals, as chosen by peers and through independent research by Law & Politics. Comparing his law and officiating professions, he says \\"A trial is nothing, pressure- wise, compared to the NFL. ‚Ä¶ I have that long [snaps his fingers] to make a decision with a million people watching and second-guessing (by video) in slow-motion. You've got to be right or wrong. I love the satisfaction when you are right ‚Äî and the agony when you are wrong.\\" Hochuli finds similarities between the football field and courtroom saying, \\"On the football field, people like that I'm in charge and know what I'm doing, but a lot of the time, it's just appearance. I'm going to sell you on my decision. It's the same in the courtroom. You don't stand in front of a jury and say, 'I think my client is innocent.' You say, 'We're right!'\\" Officiating career =Early years= Hochuli began officiating Pop Warner football games as a law student to earn additional income, which was suggested by one of his former high school coaches as \\"a way to stay in touch with the game\\". His interest in officiating carried over into baseball, where he was a Little League Baseball umpire from 1970 to 1973. Progressing to the high school level in 1973, he focused on football, and officiated games in the Tucson area until 1985. In addition to high school officiating, he worked college football games for the Big Sky Conference and Pacific-10 Conference as a line judge during the 1980s. =NFL career= Hochuli was hired by the NFL in 1990 as a back judge after applying to the league before the 1989 NFL season. His first game in the league was on August 11, 1990, at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin. During his first two years in the league, he was assigned to the officiating crew headed by referee Howard Roe. To gain additional experience as a back judge and eventually a referee, Hochuli participated in the NFL's partnership with the World League of American Football (WLAF), a spring developmental league, in 1991 and 1992. Using his experience in the WLAF, as well as the organization, precision, and analytical skills he learned while working under Roe's guidance, Hochuli desired to become a crew chief in the NFL. He was promoted to referee in 1992 when longtime referee Stan Kemp was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease and forced to retire. Hochuli had worked a pre-season game that year in Tokyo, Japan, as a back judge when he received a telephone call following the game from then-Senior Director of Officiating, Jerry Seeman. Seeman asked Hochuli to work as referee for the first time when the Denver Broncos hosted the Cincinnati Bengals in a pre-season game. Since becoming a referee, Hochuli headed the officiating crews for Super Bowl XXXII and Super Bowl XXXVIII, and he was selected as an alternate for Super Bowl XXXI, Super Bowl XXXVII, and Super Bowl XXXIX. In addition to working two Super Bowls, he has officiated five conference championship games as of the start of the 2007 NFL season. Every officiating game performance is graded by the league each week. These grades determine which officials are assigned playoff games, as well as the Super Bowl. Hochuli credits his mentor, Jerry Markbreit, a four-time Super Bowl referee, as the greatest influence on his career. In his second year as referee, he worked the 1993 Thanksgiving Day game between the Dallas Cowboys and Miami Dolphins in Irving, Texas. During the final moments of the game, Miami placekicker Pete Stoyanovich had a field goal attempt blocked. The Cowboys' Leon Lett inadvertently touched the loose ball before the Dolphins' Jeff Dellenbach pounced on it. At the time, Hochuli had \\"no idea\\" what happened during the play and had to confer with three other officials to piece together the sequence of events. With the information gathered from the officials, he ruled that Miami retained possession of the football. Stoyanovich booted the ensuing winning field goal for the Miami win. Hochuli was referee for the 1999 AFC Divisional Playoff between the Miami Dolphins and Jacksonville Jaguars; it was the final game in the careers of Dan Marino and Jimmy Johnson as the Jaguars won 62‚Äì7. Hochuli was referee in the 2003 Divisional Playoffs between the Packers and the Eagles. On October 2, 2005, he officiated the first regular-season NFL game played outside the United States when the Arizona Cardinals played the San Francisco 49ers in Mexico City, Mexico as part of the league's \\"F√∫tbol Americano\\" marketing campaign. On the first penalty announcement of the game, Hochuli gave the explanation in Spanish to pay respect to the host city and country. Jeff Bergman joined Hochuli for the wild card bout between the San Diego Chargers and New York Jets on January 8, 2005. Hochuli officiated the first regular season game at University of Phoenix Stadium on September 10, 2006, when the Cardinals hosted the 49ers. He was the referee for the game between the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers, played December 17, 2006, that included Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre becoming the all-time leader for pass completions among quarterbacks in the NFL. Favre was unaware that his 4,968 pass completions were a record until he was informed during the game by Hochuli. Hochuli was the referee again for another Favre record-breaking moment when Favre threw his 421st touchdown pass of his career on September 30, 2007 at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, Minnesota to break the record previously held by Dan Marino. He also reffed the Week 17 game in 2008 in which the Lions became the first of two NFL teams so far to go 0‚Äì16 in a season, with the other being the 2017 Browns. One of Hochuli's notable explanations came during a 2007 regular season game between the San Diego Chargers and New England Patriots. While nullifying a holding infraction, he announced through his microphone, \\"There was no foul on the play. It was not a hold. The defender was just overpowered.\\" On September 14, 2008, Hochuli officiated a game between the San Diego Chargers and the Denver Broncos. He made an incorrect call with 1:17 left in the game, while Denver was in possession of the ball at the San Diego one-yard line and they were trailing the Chargers by seven points. On a second-down play, Denver quarterback Jay Cutler fumbled the ball, and it was recovered by San Diego linebacker Tim Dobbins. Ed Hochuli blew his whistle during the play, signaling that the play was dead and ruling an incomplete pass. Hochuli later wrote, \\"Affecting the outcome of a game is a devastating feeling. Officials strive for perfection ‚Äì I failed miserably.\\" The NFL passed a rule the following offseason allowing such plays to be reviewable under the instant replay rule for the 2009 NFL season. Speaking to Referee in November 2009, Hochuli told the magazine, \\"It was really an easy play. I‚Äôve thought many times why I did what I did. The best explanation is it was almost like dyslexia. I realized it was a fumble and did the wrong thing. I realized I was wrong but there was nothing I could do about it.\\" 2001 officials' strike Hochuli has served as the head of the NFL Referees Association, the union which represents NFL game officials. The union was responsible for negotiating a new contract for the officials prior to the 2001 NFL season. At the time, salaries ranged from a first-year official earning US$1,431 a game to a veteran official with twenty years of experience making $4,330 a game. Officials were looking for a 400 percent increase in salary while the league was offering just 40 percent. During the negotiations, Hochuli believed the issue in finding a resolution was to convince the league that officials are full-time employees. At the start of the season, officials had rejected a league offer of a 60 percent immediate increase in salary, followed by an 85 percent salary increase in 2002, and a 100 percent increase in 2003. For the first time in league history, replacement officials were used during the regular season. Hochuli had distributed an e-mail to 1,200 potential replacement officials warning them that \\"Working as a scab will actually hurt and likely kill any chances you would have of ever getting into the NFL.\\" He later regretted sending the letter to college football officials across the United States. The stalemate between the union and the league ended on September 19, 2001, when officials agreed to a six-year deal from the league with an immediate increase in salary of 50 percent with a raise each year. Officials had been locked out since the final week of pre-season games that year and returned to work on September 23, 2001, when the league resumed games following the September 11, 2001 attacks. Celebrity Hochuli's presence on the football field had created a cult following. His rise in popularity is believed to have been started by Phil Simms, a former NFL quarterback and current color commentator for the NFL on CBS, who made reference to the size of Hochuli's arms during a telecast. On the Internet, websites that sell Hochuli merchandise as well as blogs with his namesake exist. He is often affectionately referred to as \\"Hochules\\", a portmanteau of his last name and \\"Hercules\\", in homage to his large biceps. While he is aware of his celebrity status, Hochuli does not understand it. He said in a USA Today interview, \\"I get a kick out of the notoriety, because I'm just a referee. I'm not the players.

The doctrine involved a restrictive approach to the interpretation of the specific powers of the Federal Parliament to preserve the powers that were intended to be left to the States. The doctrine was challenged by the new appointments to the Court in 1906 and was ultimately abandoned by the High Court in 1920 in the Engineers' Case,. replaced by an approach to interpretation that emphasised the text rather than the context of the Constitution. __TOC__ Background The Constitution sets up the Commonwealth of Australia as a federal polity, with enumerated limited specific powers conferred on the Federal Parliament. The constitutional convention held in Adelaide in 1897, passed a resolution that, as the first condition for the creation of a federal government, \\"the powers, privileges and territories of the several existing colonies shall remain intact, except in respect of such surrenders as may be agreed upon to secure uniformity of law and administration in matters of common concern.\\" The intention of the framers of the Australian Constitution has been said to be \\"to create a federal government, albeit of limited jurisdiction, which would be responsive to the popular will in specified matters of national concern and to superimpose it upon existing colonial or state governments which were seen as each adequately responsive to the popular will within their respective territorial constituencies.\\" [1987] Federal Law Review 11. One of the tasks facing the inaugural High Court was to establish its reputation and in so doing to win the confidence of the Australian people. Another was to resolve \\"constitutional loose ends\\" about the nature of the federal system and the legislative powers of the new Commonwealth that remained unresolved following the debates in the constitutional conventions. For the first two decades, the High Court stayed reasonably true to the \\"co-ordinate\\" vision of the framers in which the Commonwealth and the States were both financially and politically independent within their own spheres of responsibility.. The High Court rejected Commonwealth government attempts to extend its authority into what were perceived as areas of State jurisdiction. The court did so by adopting a doctrine of \\"reserved State powers\\" combined with \\"implied inter-governmental immunities\\", to protect both the Commonwealth and the states from legislative or executive action which \\"would fetter, control, or interfere with, the free exercise\\" of the legislative or executive power of the other.. at p. 534 & 537-8. The essence of the first part of the doctrine was that grants of power to the Commonwealth in the Constitution should be read in a restrictive way so as to preserve areas that had been intentionally left as the responsibility of the states, particularly where the Commonwealth power had an interstate element, the trade and commerce power, .. and the conciliation and arbitration power.Commonwealth of Australia Constitution, section 51(xxxv).. =Composition of the High Court= The three inaugural judges of the High Court, Griffith CJ, Barton and O'Connor JJ, and the two new judges appointed in 1906, Isaacs and Higgins JJ, had been leading participants in the Constitutional Conventions and all are properly seen as among the framers of the Constitution. at [48]-[49]. The Court described the Constitution as \\"framed in Australia by Australians, and for the use of the Australian people\\", thus when the Court spoke of what was framers of the Constitution knew, intended or expected,D'Emden v Pedder (1904) 1 CLR 91 at p. 113.

Huddart, Parker & Co Pty Ltd v Moorehead (1909) 8 CLR 33 at p. 563 per Barton J. their Honours are referring to their personal experience in that process, and not to the intention or knowledge of the Imperial Parliament in passing the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900. * Griffith CJ, a former Premier of Queensland, wrote most of the text of the Constitution. In 1891 Griffith resisted the idea of a commonwealth tribunal to deal with interstate industrial disputes. His objection was grounded in his notion of the reserve powers of the States. According to Griffith, \\"property and civil rights are left to the States\\". The danger of Kingston's proposal, as Griffith saw it, was that a national arbitral tribunal could cut across such rights. S Griffith at p. 782. *Barton J, a former member of the Parliament of NSW and the first Prime Minister of Australia, had been the leader of Australian federation following the death of Sir Henry Parkes and was the political leader who carried the draft constitution through the 1897‚Äì1898 Conventions and had intimate knowledge of the compromises that informed the text of the constitution. Barton resisted the proposal for Commonwealth power in relation to interstate industrial disputes. Barton was part of the delegation to London in 1900 that lobbied for the successful passage of the Bill through the British Parliament. *O'Connor J was also a former member of the Parliament of NSW and a close associate of Barton, including in the campaign for Australian Federation and as a member of the first federal ministry under then Prime Minister Barton. O'Connor had joined Barton in resisting proposal the proposal of interstate industrial disputes. After Federation he was Vice-President of the Executive Council and led the government in the Senate until his appointment as one of the inaugural justices of the High Court in 1903. * Isaacs J had been a member of the Parliament of Victoria and had many reservations about the draft constitution. Alfred Deakin attributed the failure to elect him to the committee drafting the constitution to \\"a plot discreditable to all engaged in it\\" and that this antagonizing and humiliating snub sharpened his \\"tendency to minute technical criticism ... so as to bring him not infrequently into collision\\" with the drafting committee. In March 1898 Isaacs pleaded for delay for further consideration. After federation Isaacs was a member of the Australian Parliament and three of the leading cases in relation to the doctrine concerned legislation drafted while he was Attorney-General. Sir Robert Garran, then secretary of the Attorney-General's Department, recalled that Isaacs \\"had a remarkably keen brain but it was apt to be sometimes too subtle for my liking. When we were drafting a bill whose constitutionality was not beyond doubt, his devices to conceal any possible want of power were sometimes so ingenious as to raise, rather than evade, suspicion.\\" *Higgins J had also been a member of the Parliament of Victoria and had successfully argued at the 1897‚Äì1898 conventions that the constitution should contain a guarantee of religious freedom, and also a provision giving the federal government the power to make laws relating to the conciliation and arbitration of industrial disputes. The industrial disputes proposal was initially unsuccessful, H Higgins at p. 782, vote at p. 793, 12 in favour, including Higgins & Isaacs, 22 opposed, including Barton & O'Connor. however Higgins was undeterred and succeeded in 1898. vote at p. 212, 22 in favour, including Higgins & Isaacs, 19 opposed, including Barton & O'Connor. Despite these successes, Higgins J had opposed the draft constitution produced by the convention as too conservative, and campaigned unsuccessfully to have it defeated at the 1899 Australian constitutional referendum. [1900] Australian Colonial Law Monographs 1 at p. 118C. Higgins was also a member of the Australian Parliament. When the Australian Labor Party sought to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill to cover State railway employees, Higgins was one of the radicals who supported the amendments and helped bring down Deakin's government. When Labour formed a minority government under Prime Minister Chris Watson in 1904, Higgins became Attorney-General in the Labor ministry, because Labor had no suitably qualified lawyer in Parliament. Developments of the doctrine =Peterswald v Bartley (1904)= Peterswald v Bartley concerned a brewer of beer at Cootamundra in the state of New South Wales. Bartley had a licence under the Commonwealth Beer Excise Act 1901,. which involved payment of an annual fee together with duty on the quantity of beer. He didn't however have a licence under the NSW Liquor Act 1898 which required payment of a fixed fee regardless of the brewer's output.. Bartley had successfully argued in the Supreme Court of NSW that the NSW licence fee was an excise duty and that the effect of section 90 of the Australian Constitution was that the State Act ceased to have effect once the Commonwealth imposed uniform customs duties.Peterswald v Bartley [1904] NSWStRp 28; (1904) 4 SR (NSW) 290. The High Court held that the NSW licence fee was not an excise as the fee did not depend on the quantity or value of the goods. Instead the NSW Act was for regulating the trade, including ensuring there was no adulteration of the beer. In delivering the opinion of the Court, Griffith CJ set out a principle that would be refined to the reserved state powers doctrine, stating: > In construing a Constitution like this it is necessary to have regard to its > general provisions as well as to particular sections, and to ascertain from > its whole purview whether the power to deal with such matters was intended > to be withdrawn from the States, and conferred upon the Commonwealth. The > Constitution contains no provisions for enabling the Commonwealth Parliament > to interfere with the private or internal affairs of the States, or to > restrict the power of the State to regulate the carrying on of any > businesses or trades within their boundaries.. =Railway servants case (1906)= Whether State railways employees should be covered by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Bill was a politically contentious issue. When the Australian Labor Party sought to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill to cover State railway employees, a number of radicals in Deakin's government, including Isaacs and Higgins, supported the amendments and helped bring down the government, with Labor forming a minority government under Prime Minister Chris Watson.. When finally passed in December 1904, the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904, purported to cover State railway employees with \\"Industrial dispute\\" defined as \\"including disputes in relation to employment upon State Railways\\". The High Court considered the validity of this provision in the Railway servants case. The NSW Rail Traffic Employees Association was, as the name suggests, a union that represented railway employees of the State of NSW and only those employees and sought to be registered under the Commonwealth Act. Another union, the Federated Amalgamated Government Railway and Tramway Service Association, objected to the registration of the NSW union and the issue was referred to the High Court.It is not clear from the judgement who the appellant union covered in addition to State railway employees and they did not take any part in the argument of the appeal. Higgins who appeared for the respondents,While a member of Parliament, Higgins, like Isaacs, maintained a practice as a barrister. in arguing that the Act was valid, relied not only on the conciliation and arbitration power, but also submitted that railways were vital to interstate trade and commerce and as such was an exercise of the trade and commerce power. Isaacs represented the Commonwealth in his capacity as the then Attorney-General, also arguing for validity based on both the conciliation and arbitration power and the trade and commerce power. NSW and Victoria intervened to argue that the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 was invalid in so far as it purported to include State railway servants. The High Court held that to regulate the terms and conditions of the engagement, employment and remuneration of the State railway servants was to interfere with the control of the State railways. The Court applied the converse of the \\"implied inter-governmental immunities\\" to protect the States from legislative or executive action by the Commonwealth which \\"would fetter, control, or interfere with, the free exercise\\" of the legislative or executive power of the States. Griffiths CJ again delivered the judgement of the Court, which again emphasised the federal nature of the Constitution, stating that \\"The Constitution Act is not only an Act of the Imperial legislature, but it embodies a compact entered into between the six Australian Colonies which formed the Commonwealth. ... the Constitution as framed was to be, and was, submitted to the votes of the electors of the States.\\" Expansion of the Court and the emergence of dissent The appointment of Isaacs and Higgins JJ in 1906 disrupted the unanimity of the inaugural members of the Court, with a clash between the three inaugural 'federalists' and the two 'nationalists'. The division in the Court can be seen as a continuation of the debate in the constitutional conventions about the nature of the federal system and the legislative powers of the new Commonwealth. =R v Barger (1908)= In R v Barger the Court had to consider whether the Commonwealth could use an excise tariff under the taxation power,section 51(ii) Commonwealth of Australia Constitution. as a means of protecting manufacturers who paid \\"fair and reasonable\\" wages to their employees. The Court was divided 3:2 with the majority, Grifith CJ, Barton & O'Connor JJ, holding that the Excise Tariff Act 1906,. was invalid. While the doctrine of reserved powers permeated the decision of the majority it is not clear that the decision rested solely on that doctrine. In the course of argument, Griffith CJ stated \\"The express power given to the Commonwealth Parliament to deal with foreign and inter- state trade and commerce implies a prohibition against interfering with interstate trade and commerce, and that must be remembered in dealing with the other powers given.\\" The majority described the applicable rule in this case as \\"different, but ... founded upon the same principles\\", concluding that the power of taxation could not be exercised so as to operate as a direct interference in the internal affairs of the States.R v Barger (1908) 6 CLR 41 at p. 54 per Grifith CJ Isaacs & Higgins JJ in dissent Isaacs J strongly opposed the reserved powers doctrine, holding \\"There can be no derogations from the grant expressly made, except those which are expressly stated or which of necessity inhere. It is an inherent consequence of the division of powers between governmental authorities that neither authority is to hamper or impede the other in the exercise of their respective powers, but that doctrine has no relation to the extent of the powers themselves; it assumes the delimitation aliunde. It is contrary to reason to shorten the expressly granted powers by the undefined residuum\\".R v Barger (1908) 6 CLR 41 at p. 84 per Isaacs J. Higgins J similarly rejected the reserved powers doctrine stating \\"To say that the Federal Parliament cannot make a law because legislation on the subject belongs to the States is rather to invert the true position. The Commonwealth has certain powers, and as to those powers it is supreme; the State has the rest. We must find what the Commonwealth powers are before we can say what the State powers are\\".R v Barger (1908) 6 CLR 41 at p. 113 per Higgins J. = Union Label Case (1908)= The Union Label case, concerned the use of union labels to indicate that goods were produced by members of a union. Isaac Isaacs, the then Attorney-General, supported the Trade Marks Bill in parliament, describing the union label as a guarantee of wholesomeness, in respect of the wages, hours of labour, and health requirements that applied to the manufacture of the goods. H.B. Higgins, then a member of the House of Representatives, similarly spoke in support of the union label. The Trade Marks Act 1905 provided that an employer could use the union label if there was a closed shop or if the union agreed.s 74(2) . The majority, Griffiths CJ, Barton and O'Connor JJ held that the power with respect to \\"trade and commerce with other countries, and among the States\\"Commonwealth of Australia Constitution, section 51(i). does not extend to the internal trade and commerce of a State. The intention of the Constitution was that the power to legislate as to internal trade and commerce was reserved to the States, to the exclusion of the Commonwealth as if section 51(i) contained words prohibiting the exercise of such powers by the Commonwealth.Union label case (1909) 8 CLR 330 at p. 502-3 per Griffith CJ, 529-30 per Barton J and 532 per O'Connor Isaacs and Higgins JJ dissented however their reasons do not specifically address their continued opposition to the reserved powers doctrine. = Huddart Parker v Moorehead (1908)= In Huddart, Parker & Co Pty Ltd v Moorehead, the court was considering the Australian Industries Preservation Act 1906, commonly referred to as the Anti- trust law, which was an Act that sought to ensure freedom of trade and commerce, protection from unfair competition and preventing price fixing and monopolies. Sections 5 and 8 of the Act were directed to conduct of foreign, trading or financial corporations, relying on the corporations power.Commonwealth of Australia Constitution, section 51(xx). The majority, Griffith CJ, Barton & O'Connor JJ, strongly influenced by the doctrine of reserved State powers, held that the corporations power was to be construed narrowly because the trade and commerce power, did not include intrastate trade and commerce, holding \\"a more flagrant invasion of the spheres of the domestic law of trade and commerce and the domestic criminal law can hardly be conceived\\". The importance of the reserved powers doctrine does not however explain all aspects of the differences in opinion about the ambit of the corporations power, in particular the distinction between regulating a corporations relations with outside parties and regulating the internal affairs of a corporation. at [74]. Higgins J agreed with the majority that sections 5 and 8 of the Act were beyond power, but for reasons that were significantly different, with his Honour maintaining his rejection of the reserved powers doctrine in his dissent in R v Barger, and the Union label case. Isaacs J similarly maintained his opposition in respect of the reserved powers doctrine. =A challenge to the doctrine- Farey v Burvett (1916)= The internal dynamic to the High Court shifted with each retirement of an existing judge and each appointment of a new judge. By 1916 there had been further changes to the composition of the Court, with the death of O'Connor J in 1912, and his replacement by Gavan Duffy J and the expansion of the Court in 1913 with two additional judges, Powers J and Rich J.Albert Piddington was initially appointed, however he resigned without ever sitting at the bench after opponents questioned his independence:- These changes did not substantially shift the approach of the Court to the interpretation of the Constitution, however there was a gradual shift toward nationalism, coming not just from the changes to the court, but from a growing political centralism, the rise of the Labor party, and nationalism as a consequence of World War I. In 1916 Farey v Burvett the Court had to consider the validity of legislation and regulations made under the defence power that fixed the maximum price for bread. One of the challenges for Griffith CJ and Barton J was how to accommodate the doctrine of reserved powers. If the Commonwealth Parliament was unable to regulate the brewing industry, conditions for railway employees, manufacturers of agricultural machinery, or unfair competition by corporations, how could the Commonwealth's defence powers extend to directly fix a maximum price for bread? Griffith CJ held that \\"The power to make laws with respect to defence is, of course, a paramount power, and if it comes into conflict with any reserved State rights the latter must give way.\\"Farey v Burvett (1916) 21 CLR 433 at pp. 442, 445‚Äì8 per Griffith CJ. Barton J distinguished between powers in peace and war, holding that \\"If an activity belongs solely to a State in time of peace it does not follow that it is not a means of defence for Commonwealth hands in time of war.\\"Farey v Burvett (1916) 21 CLR 433 at pp. 445‚Äì6 per Barton J. Isaacs J, with whom Powers J agreed, doubted that it was permissible to give legal prominence to any one Commonwealth power, even one as necessary as defence, maintaining his previous rejection of the reserved powers doctrine, holding the limits of the defence power \\"are bounded only by the requirements of self-preservation. It is complete in itself, and there can be no implied reservation of any State power to abridge the express grant of a power to the Commonwealth\\". His Honour acknowledged that the Commonwealth was entering a legislative area normally outside of its powers, but that this was a legitimate result of the war.Farey v Burvett (1916) 21 CLR 433 at pp. 453‚Äì4, 458‚Äì60 per Isaacs J, Powers J agreeing. Higgins J similarly maintained his rejection of the reserved powers doctrine,; (1907) 21 CLR 1087 at p. 1165 per Higgins J. holding that the constitutional question was limited to the interpretation of the express defence power and rejected the suggestion that the defence power was paramount, holding \\"All the subjects for legislation in sec. 51 are on the same logical level: there is no hierarchy in the powers, with the power as to defence on the top.\\"Farey v Burvett (1916) 21 CLR 433 at pp. 457, 460‚Äì1 per Higgins J. Gavan Duffy & Rich JJ in their dissent placed emphasis on the powers of the States, holding that \\"The enumerated powers entrusted by the States to the Commonwealth are stated in language adopted after prolonged and meticulous discussion. The powers distributed and reserved were intended to enable the individual States and the federation of States to move, each in its own orbit, in a complete and permanent harmony.\\"Farey v Burvett (1916) 21 CLR 433 at p. 462, 469 per Gavan Duffy & Rich JJ. Emphatic rejection More dramatic consequences flowed from the change in the composition of the Court as a result of the retirement of Griffith CJ in 1919, replaced by Knox CJ and the death of Barton J in 1920, and his replacement by Starke J. Within months, the reserved powers doctrine was unambiguously rejected by the High Court, marking the emergence of Isaacs J as the primary force in the Knox Court. The High Court abandoned the doctrine in the 1920 Engineers' Case after changes in the composition of the Court. The Court now insisted on adhering only to the language of the constitutional text read as a whole in its natural sense and in light of the circumstances in which it was made: there was to be no reading in of implications by reference to the presumed intentions of the framers. In particular, since there is no mention of \\"reserved State powers,\\" only one express inter-governmental immunity (regarding property taxes: section 114), and, an express provision asserting the superiority of valid Commonwealth laws over inconsistent State laws (section 109), there was no longer any room for the doctrine previously asserted in favour of the States. Subsequent consideration In the Payroll Tax case per Windyer J at 395‚Äì6. Windeyer J challenged the foundation of the doctrine, that the Constitution was a compact between the former colonies as independent sovereign bodies, holding that: > The Commonwealth Constitution was enacted at Westminster in 1900 as a > product of the assent and agreement of the peoples of the Australian > Colonies. It was sought by Australians, not imposed upon them. The > Constitution Act itself was carefully worded so as not to be coercive. ... > As an agreement of peoples, British subjects in British Colonies, and the > enactment thereafter by the sovereign legislature of the British Empire of a > law to give effect to their wishes, the Australian federation can be > described as springing from an agreement or compact. But agreement became > merged in law. The word\\" compact\\" is still appropriate but strictly only if > used in a different sense-not as meaning a pact between independent parties, > but as describing a compaction, a putting of separate things firmly together > by force of law. The Colonies which in 1901 became States in the new > Commonwealth were not before then sovereign bodies in any strict legal > sense; and certainly the Constitution did not make them so. They were self- > governing colonies which, when the Commonwealth came into existence as a new > Dominion of the Crown, lost some of their former powers and gained no new > powers. They became components of a federation, the Commonwealth of > Australia. It became a nation. Its nationhood was in the course of time to > be consolidated in war, by economic and commercial integration. by the > unifying influence of federal law, by the decline of dependence upon British > naval and military power and by a recognition and acceptance of external > interests and obligations. Despite the emphatic rejection, the States have continued to use the concept in argument against the further expansion of federal power. One of the arguments put forward by the States in the WorkChoices case,. was that the powers conferred by s 51 must be construed so that they do not authorise a law with respect to the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes other than by conciliation and arbitration. Victoria submitted that this limitation was based on the text and structure of s 51 and not on any doctrine of reserved powers.The WorkChoices case (2006) 229 CLR 1 at p 18 per P M Tate SC, Solicitor-General (Vic). Queensland put forward another argument focused on the rejection of attempts to broaden the scope of the corporations power or to confer on the Commonwealth a general industrial relations power in 1910, 1912, 1926 and 1946.The WorkChoices case (2006) 229 CLR 1 at p 30 per W Sofronoff QC, Solicitor-General (Qld). Neither argument found favour with the majority, holding that there were three \\"insuperable difficulties in arguing from the failure of a proposal for constitutional amendment to any conclusion about the Constitution's meaning\\", (1) the failed referendums were broader than the question the court was asked to determine, (2) the failure of referendums was much more complex than the choice of electors between clearly identified constitutional alternatives & (3) it was unclear whether the referendums were said to confirm or alter the meaning of the Constitution. On the question of reserved powers, the majority noted that \\"No party to these proceedings questioned the authority of the Engineers' Case, or the Concrete Pipes Case,. or the validity of the Trade Practices Act in its application to the domestic (intrastate) trade of constitutional corporations. Necessarily, however, the plaintiffs experienced difficulty in accommodating their submissions to those developments.\\" at [50], [131]-[133] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon & Crennan JJ. Aroney argues that the reserved powers doctrine is often misunderstood and that the description of it in the Engineers case, was a mere caricature of the doctrine. (2008) 32 Melbourne University Law Review 1. Properly construed the doctrine is said to rest on firmer foundations, being: > # a clear and defensible account of the political origins, underlying ideas, > structural features and intended purposes of the Constitution; # a careful > articulation of the grounds upon which the specific content of the powers > reserved to the states can be identified ‚Äî one that requires very close > attention to be given to the precise terms in which federal heads of power > are defined, such that what is not granted to the Commonwealth may be as > significant as what is granted; and # a sophisticated recognition that > constitutional interpretation inevitably requires choices to be made and > that these choices can be guided by a general orientation either to expand > federal power as far as possible or to read federal power with an eye to the > resulting impact on the remaining legislative powers of the states.

According to census data of 2009 its population was 14,814, and estimated as 17,177 in the beginning of 2020. The town is located along the major Bishkek-Osh route, approximately 3 miles from the Kyrgyzstan- Uzbekistan border. The settlement Kochkor-Ata was established in 1952 in regard with discovery and exploitation of Izbaskent oil field. In 2003, it was granted town status. The town itself maintains a high level of contrasting polarity. The center of the town, by the bazaar and municipal buildings, highlights a late Soviet-era style of structural design and color. Large concrete structures painted in bright colors outline central avenues and plazas. Soviet propaganda is still framed high on old billboards and posters. \\"Oil is the strength of the people,\\" reads one of the central banners. However, much of Kochkor-Ata is rural. East of the central plaza past the Soviet-era concrete housing complexes, lie the mainstay of the Kochkor-Ata population. Small shacks and houses lined closely to each other, stepped along the foothills of the local mountain range, house many of the local inhabitants. Animal husbandry and small-trade provide many of these villagers with a means of income. The town boasts a relatively new clothing bazaar, predominantly built by funds from Kyrgyz ex-president, Askar Akayev, alongside an older established bazaar. The bazaar is the center of commerce, in the small town. It is one of the local stops along the Bishkek-Osh route, and thus maintains a daily flow of inter-and-intra related trade and small commerce. The avto-vaksal, or bus/taxi station, is also located in the western end of the bazaar. The local marshrutka, public transport van, runs from the Kochkor- Ata avto-vaksal to other towns along the route, most notably: Massy, Bazar- Korgon, and Jalal-Abad. One of the larger oil fields in Kochkor-Ata has been bought out by Chinese business and interests. The town has four middle schools: one Russian school, one Kyrgyz boarding school, and two other regular Kyrgyz schools. The town is also host of a fairly new football stadium, built by funds of a prominent Kyrgyz oil company, KNG, in the town. A hospital complex has been established adjacent to the Kyrgyz boarding school.

The purpose of the gauge is to scribe a line parallel to a reference edge or surface. It is used in joinery and sheetmetal operations. The gauge consists of a beam, a headstock, and a scribing or marking implement, typically a pin, knife, pen or wheel. The headstock slides along the beam, and is locked in place by various means: a locking screw, cam lever, or a wedge. The marking implement is fixed to one end of the beam. Types The marking implement is chosen depending upon the operation to be performed. Some marking gauges have the capability to allow a number of implements to be fitted, others do not; and a woodworker will often have a number of different types. A steel pin is used when scribing with the grain. A steel knife is used when scribing across the grain. The pen or pencil is used when the woodworker does not wish the surface to be marred. Generally speaking, the pin and knife yield more accurate marking than do the pen or pencil. It is also used to mark parallel lines to the face side and edge side. =Variations= The style of gauge which uses a knife instead of a pin is often described as a cutting gauge. This tool is sometimes used to slightly \\"mark\\" the wood before a cut to prevent tearout later when doing the main cut with for example a circular saw. Other variations include a panel gauge which has a longer beam and larger headstock for scribing lines that are further from the reference edge. A mortise gauge has two pins that can be adjusted relative to each other at the end of the beam. This gauge is used to scribe two lines simultaneously and is most commonly used to lay out mortise and tenon joinery.

Sallese managed the band Ism and co-produced their Diet For the Worms LP on his S.I.N. Records label. He also produced the compilation albums The Big Apple Rotten To The Core Vol. 1 and 2 on S.I.N. Records and Raw Power Records. According to George Hurchalla's book Going Underground: American Punk, 1979-1992, Sallese and Jism of the band Ism attempted to bring hardcore punk into the mainstream in New York City during the early 1980s. They released the compilation The Big Apple Rotten to the Core, which featured local punk and hardcore bands. The album garnered nationwide airplay, and Ism gained notoriety on college and alternative commercial radio. As a result, WLIR (New York's commercial alternative music station) began adding some hardcore to its playlists and began a late-night hardcore show hosted by Ben Manilla, the first commercial airplay of hardcore in the metropolitan NY area. Hurchalla writes that Jism and Sallese \\"had hopes of bringing hardcore into the mainstream\\" but \\"many of the new bands wanted to eradicate any taint of older punk from their sound....\\"Hurchalla, page 112, Zuo Press,2005 References External links * Ism Myspace profile * The Ism story Category:American record producers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ","title":"Bob Sallese"},{"id":"2541981","text":"Richard Rodgers (1902‚Äì1979) was an American composer.

He edited and published La Caricature magazine for 12 years. Through the 1880s, he wrote an acclaimed trilogy of futuristic novels. In the 1900s he created 520 illustrations for Pierre Giffard's weekly serial La Guerre Infernale. Biography He was born in Compi√®gne, France, the son of a carpenter. He studied to become a notary, but was more interested in caricature. In 1866 he joined Journal amusant as an illustrator. In 1880, with Georges Decaux, he founded his own magazine La Caricature, which he edited for 12 years. He illustrated tourist guides, works of popular history, and literary classics. His fame disappeared after World War I. Nouvelle carte d'Europe Futuristic Trilogy Albert Robida was rediscovered thanks to his trilogy of futuristic works: *Le Vingti√®me Si√®cle (1883) *La Guerre au vingti√®me si√®cle (1887) *Le Vingti√®me si√®cle. La vie √©lectrique (1890) These works drew comparison with Jules Verne. Unlike Verne, he proposed inventions integrated into everyday life, not creations of mad scientists, and he imagined the social developments that arose from them, often with accuracy: social advancement of women, mass tourism, pollution, etc. His La Guerre au vingti√®me si√®cle describes modern warfare, with robotic missiles and poison gas. His T√©l√©phonoscope was a flat screen television display that delivered the latest news 24-hours a day, the latest plays, courses, and teleconferences.

One of Robida's drawings for his book Le Vingti√®me Si√®cle, a nineteenth-century conception of life in the twentieth century. Ink over graphite underdrawing, c. 1883, digitally restored. Robida illustrated two works by Pierre Giffard: * La Fin du Cheval (\\"The End of the Horse\\"), on the inevitable replacement of the horse by the bicycle and then by the car. * La Guerre Infernale (\\"The Infernal War\\"), a 1908 serial adventure novel for children that appeared weekly every Saturday. Robida contributed 520 illustrations. The novel is set in the future and features uncanny parallels to World War Two, including an attack on London by Germany and a conflict between Japan and the United States. It was subsequently republished as a book.

In the first years of the 20th century, he served as Constructor of the Navy and Chief of the Bureau of Construction and Repair, with responsibility for naval shipbuilding. Early life and career Capps was born in Portsmouth, Virginia, 31 January 1864. He graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1884. Upon graduation, he served in the screw frigate for the two years of sea duty then customary prior to receiving his officer's commission. After becoming an ensign in 1886, Capps studied naval architecture at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. After returning to the United States in 1888, he was appointed Assistant Naval Constructor. He undertook brief duty at the Navy Department, and was then assigned to William Cramp & Sons' shipyard in Philadelphia. Capps moved to the New York Navy Yard in 1889 and remained there joining the Bureau of Construction and Repair in 1892. Three years later he became the superintending constructor at the Union Iron Works in San Francisco. There, he supervised the construction of (Battleship No. 3), (Battleship No. 9), (Torpedo Boat No. 11), (Gunboat No. 15), and (Gunboat No. 14). Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and afterward Later attached to the staff of Commodore George Dewey, commander of the Asiatic Squadron, Capps was present during the Battle of Manila Bay. After the capture of Manila, Capps had three of the Spanish warships salvaged and repaired. Upon his return to the United States, Capps spent two years with the Board of Inspection Survey. He followed this with a tour of duty as the Head, Construction and Repair Department at the New York Navy Yard. Constructor of the Navy / Chief of the Bureau of Construction and Repair In 1903, Capps became Constructor of the Navy, as well as Chief of the Bureau of Construction and Repair, with the rank of rear admiral. He served in the position until 1910. During his tenure as Constructor of the Navy, the Bureau tested and adopted numerous new ideas in warship design. Among his notable innovations was the decision to mount battleships' main batteries on the centerline, thereby increasing their broadside weight of metal to the maximum. Other pre-World War I activities Capps also served on a number of American and international committees which had been established for such purposes‚Äîamong others‚Äîas improving the organization of the Navy and adopting new safety measures at sea to prevent a recurrence of disasters such as the sinking of the in April 1912. World War I and post-war service During World War I, Capps was senior member of the Navy Compensation Board, which oversaw the costs of the Navy's expanded ship-acquisition program. He also served as general manager of the United States Shipping Board Merchant Fleet Corporation.

Chopard & Cie S.A.,Chopard ‚Äì corporate information commonly known as Chopard, is a Swiss manufacturer and retailer of luxury watches, jewellery and accessories. Founded in 1860 by Louis-Ulysse Chopard in Sonvilier, Switzerland, Chopard has been owned by the Scheufele family of Germany since 1963. Chopard is best known for making high-quality Swiss watches and jewellery, and its clients have included Tsar Nicholas II of Russia. The company is headquartered in Geneva and has a site in Fleurier, Canton of Neuch√¢tel, that manufactures watch movements. History =Early history= The company founder, Louis-Ulysse Chopard, was a Swiss watchmaker who grew up in Sonvilier, a town near Bern. In 1860, he established his L.U.C. manufacturing company in Sonvilier, having observed that it was more profitable to market the finished watch than to just make the mechanical movement. After Louis-Ulysse's death in 1915, the company was taken over by his son Paul-Louis and grandson Paul-Andr√©. The company specialised in making pocket watches and ladies‚Äô wristwatches. In 1921, Paul-Louis moved the company operations to a larger town, Chaux-de-Fonds, in the Canton of Neuch√¢tel. In 1937, at that time a company of 150 employees, the company relocated to Geneva. This enabled the movements made by the company to be certified with the Geneva Seal, a mark applied only to watch movements made in the Canton of Geneva. Paul-Andr√© took over the company in 1943. In 1963, having no children wishing to continue in the business, Paul-Andr√© Chopard sold it to Karl Scheufele III, a German goldsmith and watchmaker from Pforzheim, who was seeking a watch movement manufacturer exclusively for his own business. =Recent developments= Store on Madison Avenue in New York City In 1974, the Chopard factory moved from the center of Geneva to Meyrin-Geneva and in 1976 the company started making watches that contained its signature free- floating diamond behind sapphire glass. In the 1980s, the company expanded into making sports watches for men and diamond jewellery for women. In 1996, the company established its own complete watch movement manufacturing facility in Fleurier, in the Swiss Canton of Neuch√¢tel. Prior to that time, all Chopard's movements had been assembled from third-party components. The movements made in Fleurier were intended for the high-end watches in the Chopard range. In 2010, the company celebrated its 150th anniversary, by which time the company's estimated sales were ‚Ç¨550 million in total (of which ‚Ç¨250 million were from watches) with about 100 stores around the world. In 2014, Chopard recorded sales of CHF800m (US$915m) and had roughly 2,000 employees worldwide, of whom 900 were working in Switzerland. The European Patent Office lists more than 20 references to Chopard since 2002. The company produces around 75,000 timepieces and 75,000 jewelleries each year, and is an active member of the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry FH.  Auction record  A Chopard \\"Happy Diamond\\" wristwatch was sold in auction by Christie's for around US$1.67 million (CHF 1,685,000) in Geneva on November 10, 2015. The watch has quartz movement and carries a pink marquise-cut diamond, weighing approximately 2.62 carats, and a blue marquise-cut diamond, weighing approximately 1.48 carat.  Environmental rating  Top 5 gold producing nations In December 2018, World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) released an official report giving environmental ratings for 15 major watch manufacturers and jewelers in Switzerland. Chopard, along with TAG Heuer, was given a below- average environmental rating as \\"Lower Midfield\\", suggesting that the manufacturer has only taken a few actions addressing the impact of its manufacturing activities on the environment and climate change. Since 2013, Chopard has been promoting its high-end products as using ethical and sustainable gold; implementing this practice with the company's full product line remains a long-term objective. In jewelry and watchmaking industry, there are general concerns over the lack of transparency in manufacturing activities and the sourcing of precious raw materials such as gold, which is a major cause of environmental issues such as pollution, soil degradation and deforestation. The situation is especially serious in the developing countries which are top producers of gold, including China, Russia and South Africa. It is estimated that the watch and jewelry sector uses over 50% of world's annual gold production (over 2,000 tons), but in most cases the watch companies are not able to or are unwilling to demonstrate where their raw materials come from and if the material suppliers use eco-friendly sourcing technologies. Sponsorship Chopard Mille Miglia watch, 2018 Chopard is a corporate partner of: *The Mille Miglia car rally since 1988. *The Cannes Film Festival since 1998, sponsoring the Troph√©e Chopard prize and making the Palme d‚ÄôOr trophy.

An Army General, he mounted a successful coup d'√©tat against the incumbent President, Laureano G√≥mez Castro (1889 ‚Äì 1965), imposing martial law and establishing a dictatorship in Colombia. Biographic data Rojas was born in the city of Tunja, Boyac√°, on March 12, 1900, and died in Melgar, Tolima, on January 17, 1975.Arismendi Posada, Ignacio; Gobernantes Colombianos; trans. Colombian Presidents; Interprint Editors Ltd.; Italgraf; Segunda Edici√≥n; Page 223; Bogot√°, Colombia; 1983 Early years and education Gustavo Rojas Pinilla began his career in the school of cadets Escuela Militar de Cadetes Gral. Jos√© Mar√≠a Cordoba of Bogot√° in 1917. He obtained his degree in 1920. In 1923 while serving in Manizales, Caldas, he was promoted to lieutenant in the army. He became dissatisfied with the army and in 1924 he requested permission to retire from active service so that he could study civil engineering in Tri- State Normal College, in the United States where he obtained the title of civil engineer in 1927. From there he started taking part in the construction of highways and other works of engineering as part of his military career.  Military career  left In 1932, Rojas was called to the front lines in order to defend the country in the war against Per√∫. The following year he was assigned to Buenaventura's port as commander of the Coast Battery and military engineer of the region in case of a Peruvian attack. In 1936, he became an engineer of the technical department of the Colombian Army, ammunitions factory, on behalf of which he was sent on a special mission to Germany to obtain the machinery necessary to make ammunitions in Bogot√°. On his return to Colombia he was nominated as chief of the technical department of the munitions factory. In 1943, he was sent to the United States to acquire weapons and other machinery for the Colombian military. In 1944, he became assistant director of the School of War, and in 1945 the director of Civil Aeronautics. It was there where he presented his project for airports in Colombia under the name \\"Tracks of landing in Colombia,\\" which served as a dissertation for his promotion to colonel of the Army, a plan which he would subsequently bring into being with the El Dorado Airport and other airports during his later presidency. In 1946, now a colonel, Rojas was nominated as commander of the First Brigade in Tunja and in 1948 was named commander of the Third Brigade in Cali. There, he gained major recognition in the country for having managed to appease the rebellion that happened in this region as a consequence of the assassination of the popular leader Jorge Eli√©cer Gait√°n on April 9, 1948, for which he was honoured by the incumbent Conservative President Mariano Ospina P√©rez. On October 11, 1949, he was promoted to General and on October 19 assigned to the Central Command of the Army.

Colombian Presidents; Interprint Editors Ltd.; Italgraf; Segunda Edici√≥n; Page 225; Bogot√°, Colombia; 1983 On May 10, 1957, the people of Colombia, dissatisfied with the government of Rojas, launched a massive national protest demanding his resignation. Rojas was ousted and the events of this day were called a ‚Äúcoup d'√©tat of public opinion‚Äù. A military Junta of five Generals assumed control of the nation. The military Junta was made up of: General Gabriel Par√≠s Gordillo, General Rafael Navas, General Luis E. Ord√≥√±ez, General Deogracias Fonseca and Admiral Rub√©n Piedrahita. The Junta ruled until 1958, when a plebiscite adopted an 1886 Constitution, and General Gabriel Par√≠s Gordillo was elected as Chairman of the Colombian Military Junta of Government.Arismendi Posada, Ignacio; Gobernantes Colombianos, trans. Colombian Presidents; Interprint Editors Ltd.; Italgraf; Segunda Edici√≥n; Page 227; Bogot√°, Colombia; 1983 =Freedom of the press= Pinilla mounted a widespread censorship campaign against the Colombian press. He established a national radio station which consisted mostly of government sponsored catholic propaganda. Thousands of radios were distributed across the country, but these radios could only tune to the government controlled station radio Sutatenza. =Gun Control= Until 1955, Colombians could legally possess firearms. Rojas Pinilla established a national gun permit system, making it difficult to obtain a gun. = Presidential Candidate = In the election of 1962 Rojas ran a first time as the presidential candidate of his newly created ANAPO opposition party. He came in fourth, but his result was nonetheless declared invalid due to him being a former coup leader. In the election of 1970 he ran again for the presidency, with a populist platform. He was defeated by a narrow margin by Misael Pastrana, but alleged that this was the result of fraud. thumb Tomb of Gustavo Rojas Pinilla The presidential election of April 19, 1970, was difficult and controversial. Rojas and Misael Pastrana Borrero were both running for office. Rojas seemed to be winning the elections until a nationwide malfunction of communication systems happened. After these were restored, the votes had already been counted. The results were very close, giving a slight margin in favor of Pastrana Borrero. The supporters of Rojas challenged the results and accused the government of President Carlos Lleras Restrepo of fraud. The case was brought before the Electoral Court, which ruled in favor of Pastrana Borrero on July 15, 1970, certifying him as President of Colombia.Arismendi Posada, Ignacio; Gobernantes Colombianos, trans.

During the early history of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States all of the dioceses were part of one ecclesiastical province under the Archbishop of Baltimore. This being the case, governance of the American church was carried out by provincial councils held in Baltimore. As the church grew and was divided into multiple provinces, it became necessary for a national (or plenary) council of the bishops of the United States to meet to foster common discipline. The fathers of the Seventh Provincial Council of Baltimore requested the Holy See to sanction the holding of a plenary council. The petition was granted and the pope appointed Archbishop Francis Kenrick of Baltimore as apostolic delegate to convene and preside over the council. First Plenary Council of Baltimore (1852) The First Plenary Council of Baltimore was solemnly opened on May 9, 1852. Its sessions were attended by six archbishops and thirty-five suffragan bishops. The Bishop of Monterey, California, Joseph Sadoc Alemany, was also present, although his diocese, lately separated from Mexico, had not yet been incorporated with any American province. Another prelate in attendance was Armand de Charbonnel, the Bishop of Toronto, Canada. The religious orders and congregations were represented by the Mitred Abbot of St. Mary of La Trappe and by the superiors of the Augustinians, Dominicans, Benedictines, Franciscans, Jesuits, Redemptorists, Vincentians, and Sulpicians. The last solemn session was held on the 20th of May. Second Plenary Council of Baltimore (1866) The Second Plenary Council was presided over by Archbishop Spalding of Baltimore as Delegate Apostolic. It was opened on the 7th of October and closed on 21 October 1866. The acts note that, at the last solemn session, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, was among the auditors. The decrees of this council were signed by seven archbishops, thirty-nine bishops or their procurators, and two abbots. The decrees are divided into fourteen titles and subdivided into chapters. They were approved by Pope Pius IX. Third Plenary Council of Baltimore (1884) The Third Plenary Council was presided over by the apostolic delegate, Archbishop James Gibbons of Baltimore. Its decrees were signed by fourteen archbishops, sixty-one bishops or their representatives, six abbots, and one general of a religious congregation. The first solemn session was held 9 November, and the last 7 December 1884. Its decrees are divided into twelve titles, approved by Pope Leo XIII. =Excommunications of the Third Council= Title iv established two excommunications latae sententiae that were applicable only to Catholics within the United States.Canon Law: A Text and Commentary, by T. Lincoln Bouscaren and Adam C. Ellis The first (n. 124) applied to American Catholics who, after obtaining a civil divorce, attempted remarriage. This excommunication was lifted (retroactively) in 1977 by Pope Paul VI at the request of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. The second excommunication (n. 127) applied to American Catholics who married (or attempted marriage) before a non-Catholic minister. This excommunication was later complemented by canon 2319 of the 1917 Code of Canon Law, which in turn was modified in 1953 to subsume the U.S.-only excommunication. The excommunication of canon 2319 was subsequently lifted (retroactively) by Pope Paul VI in the 1970 motu proprio Matrimonia Mixta.

It was initially released as an extra disc with a re-release of The Ring on DVD. The events in Rings lead up to the sequel The Ring Two, on whose DVD Rings is also included as a bonus feature. Plot Some time after the events of The Ring, Samara Morgan's videotape has spread, as each person who sees the video makes a copy and shows it to someone else. A subculture has grown surrounding the video: people wait to see how close to the seven-day deadline they can get. When they grow too afraid to go on any longer, they show the tape to the next assigned person. During the interval, some create videos documenting their experiences to be posted to websites devoted to the videotape phenomenon. Groups that have watched the video are called \\"rings\\". The film is focused on Jake Pierce, the latest member of one such ring. The ring has also recruited its next member, Tim who will watch the tape when Jake cracks. Eddie, a member, says that very few have ever been able to make it to day seven before cracking, and everyone who did has died. He tells Jake to make sure to record everything he sees. Jake is amazed at what he experiences at first, and Vanessa, another member, says she wants Jake to make it to day seven. However, Jake's experiences soon turn scary, as he starts seeing visions of Samara suddenly popping up wherever he goes, and has a similar dream that Rachel Keller had from the first film of Samara grabbing his arm, leaving a bruise there. After several more unsettling experiences, he cracks on the sixth day, but Tim refuses to watch the tape. It is revealed that Vanessa is the one who made Tim refuse to watch the tape, as she wants to see what happens on day seven. However, this leaves Jake without someone to pass the curse onto. By the next day, he's become so desperate he tries to play the video on the display models at an electronics store, but is caught and thrown out by a security guard who is a member of rings, and knows what the tape does. Jake begins dialing random numbers, hoping to find somebody to show the tape. Finally, he thinks of Emily, a girl he goes to school with. He invites her over without mentioning the video. Before she arrives, he experiences a vision in which Samara arrives and he tries to break the TV, though she comes out anyway. She reaches through the screen on his video camera and the vision ends. An hour before the deadline, Emily agrees to come, leading to the opening sequence of The Ring Two; Vanessa is seen encouraging Emily by nodding when she is making her decision to go to Jake's house.

The Thesawalamai is a collection of the Customs of the Malabar Inhabitants of the Province of Jaffna (collected by Dissawe Isaak) and given full force by the Regulation of 1806. For Thesawalamai to apply to a person it must be established that he is a Tamil inhabitant of the Northern Province. The Law in its present form applies to most Tamils in northern Sri Lanka. The law is personal in nature thus it is applicable mostly for property, inheritance, and marriage.http://www.austlii.edu.au/~andrew/CommonLII/LKSC/1983/28.html Under this law, not all property could be given away. A person could give away only the tediatettam; i.e., joint property or property acquired by either spouse during the period after married life and or the priests acquiring from such properties. Even of the tediatettam property, the husband cannot alienate the whole property; the wife is entitled to half of it. Those properties inherited from the parents cannot be given away according to one's own wish. There are also cases of old ladies who do not have any children giving their properties to the temple. The landmark case Sivagnanalingam v Suntheralingam has given a new dimension to the tesawalamai law as it redefined its applicability. The judgement expanded the applicability of thesawalamai by settling the following points. The meaning of ordinary words is question of fact but the meaning to be attributed to enacted words is a question of law: The meaning of the expression \\"inhabitant of the Province of Jaffna\\" is a question of law. Inhabitant means permanent inhabitant - One who has his permanent home in Jaffna in the nature of a domicile in the Northern ProvinceThere can only be a Sri Lankan domicile and to that extent the term differs from the expression inhabitancy. Yet the idea of permanent home underlies both concepts and rules for identifying a person's domicile can be applied to discover whether a family has a permanent home in the Northern Province and hence its members are inhabitants in that Province. There is a strong presumption in favour of the continuance of a domicile of originThere can only be a Sri Lankan domicile and to that extent the term differs from the expression inhabitancy. Yet the idea of permanent home underlies both concepts and rules for identifying a person's domicile can be applied to discover whether a family has a permanent home in the Northern Province and hence its members are inhabitants in that Province. The Thesawalamai is the personal law of the Tamil inhabitants of the Northern Province. It applies to them wherever they are and to their movable and immovable property wherever situated in Sri Lanka. For the purpose of deciding on the rights of inheritance to the estate of a deceased husband, the time of his death is the relevant time and not the time of marriage.

Michel was born in Paris, France. Because of his wayward behaviour, he was sent by his father to Mettray Penal Colony for six months in 1876. By the age of 19, he caused a scandal by eloping with an actress despite his famous father's objections. By 1883 his father finally came around and Michel got married‚Äîonly to abandon his newlywed wife and run away with 16-year-old Jeanne Reboul, with whom he had two children before his divorce got finalized. These and other issues caused much strain between Michel and his father, but by the time Jules died in 1905 relations between them had improved, and they had collaborated on some stories. Michel was in charge of publishing many of his father's last manuscripts, and it is rumored that Michel may have written some of them himself. Works previously attributed to Jules Verne but now considered to have been written by Michel include The Lighthouse at the End of the World, The Golden Volcano (in two parts, Claim on Forty Mile Creek and Flood and Flame) and The Thompson Travel Agency. Michel Verne wrote in a similar genre to his father, and was considered by his father to be a good writer, but his works are now generally considered to be inferior to those of his father. Consequently, he is probably most famous for the controversy surrounding the authorship of his father's last works. Some of his works, like Un Express de L'Avenir and In the Year 2889 are notable for their use of pneumatic tubes.

The constitution became effective June 2, 1784, when it replaced the state's constitution of 1776. The constitution is divided into two parts: a Bill of Rights and a Form of Government. Subsections of each part are known as articles. For example, the subsection dealing with free speech and liberty of the press is cited as \\"Part I, Article 22\\" or \\"Pt. I, Art. 22.\\" Part I ‚Äì Bill of Rights Part First of the constitution is made up of 43 articles, codifying many of the same natural rights as does the United States Constitution, including free speech, freedom of the press, jury trials, freedom of religion, and the right to bear arms. It protects citizens against double jeopardy, unreasonable searches and seizures, and being required to quarter soldiers. In most cases, the state constitution affords more specific protections than the U.S. Constitution. Unlike the U.S. Constitution, New Hampshire's Bill of Rights has been amended regularly since its adoption. =Article 2-a. The Bearing of Arms= New Hampshire's constitution certifies the pro gun environment in the state. Article 2-a reads: =Article 7. State Sovereignty= New Hampshire has the ability to govern itself independently, which makes the way for its Right of Revolution. =Article 10. Right of Revolution= New Hampshire is one of several states that codify a \\"Right of Revolution\\" in their state constitutions. The Right of Revolution dates back to the Revolutionary War. Article 10 reads: =Article 11. Elections and Elective Franchises.= In New Hampshire all elections are free and all inhabitants 18 or older are permitted to vote in their domicile. Persons convicted of \\"treason, bribery or any willful violation of the election laws of this state or of the United States\\" are excluded from voting in elections; which may be restored by the Supreme Court on notice to the Attorney General. The General Court is required to establish absentee ballot and voter qualification process for state and municipal ballot elections, which includes primaries. Polling and voter registration places are required to be \\"easily accessible to all persons\\" which specifically includes the disabled and elderly persons who are otherwise qualified to vote in the applicable election. Non-payment of any tax is not a permitted exclusion from voting. Every inhabitant of the state, having the proper qualifications, has equal right to be elected into office. =Article 12‚Äìa. Eminent domain= Article 12‚Äìa, which states that \\"No part of a person's property shall be taken by eminent domain...if the taking is for the purpose of private development....\\" was ratified in 2006. It was one of many actions that various states took, in the wake of Kelo v. City of New London the previous year, to limit the uses of eminent domain permitted by that decision. =Article 28‚Äìa. Unfunded mandates= Although counties, cities, and towns in New Hampshire are legal constructs of the state, Article 28‚Äìa was added in 1984 to stop the practice by which the state expanded their duties. It provides that any \\"new, expanded or modified programs or responsibilities\\" must either be \\"fully funded by the state\\" or \\"approved for funding by a vote of the local legislative body....\\" =Article 36. Pensions= Article 36 barred the state from providing pensions except for \\"actual services...and never for more than one year at a time.\\" Article 36‚Äìa was added in 1984 to clarify that the state retirement system is constitutional, and to earmark its funds to pay the benefits due retirees. Part II ‚Äì Form of Government Part Second contains 101 articles that specify how state government functions. Article 1 established The State of New Hampshire as the official name of the sovereign and independent state, formerly known as the province of New Hampshire. The remainder of Part II is subdivided in the following sections: =The General Court= Articles 2 - 8 establish the framework for the General Court and its authority to establish courts, enact state laws affecting the Government of New Hampshire, provide for the State's emergency powers, gather funding, and use collected monies. =House of Representatives= Articles 9 - 24 establish the authority and makeup of the House of Representatives, the lower house of the General Court. This section of the Constitution establishes how representatives are elected, their responsibilities, and their privileges. These articles make clear that all state-level budgetary legislation must originate from the House, much like the British House of Commons and the United States House of Representatives. Articles 11 (formerly 10) and 11-a provide that representative districts are set by statute. Redistricting is often litigated. In 2002, the state supreme court dictated the districts.Burling v. Chandler, 148 NH 143 Article 11 was last amended in 2006CACR-41 of 2006 to provide that towns whose size entitles them to one representative will have their own representative, but to allow the use of floterial districts spanning several towns or wards to achieve greater precision. Article 15, Compensation of the Legislature, fixes the pay for General Court members at $200 per term (two years) and $250 for the presiding officers. Legislators also receive mileage for \\"actual daily attendance on legislative days, but not after the legislature shall have been in session for 45 legislative days or after the first day of July following the annual assembly of the legislature.\\" =Senate= Articles 25 - 40, excluding 28 which was repealed in 1976, define the role and makeup of The Senate, the upper house of the General Court. This section is similar to the section regarding the House of Representatives, with the largest difference that the Senate is the ultimate arbiter of all elections. Articles 38 - 40 describe how state officers may be impeached and be punished for bribery, corruption, malpractice or maladministration, in office. The House of Representatives is given the authority to impeach state officers, while the Senate hears, tries, and determines all impeachments made by the House. The articles also state the rules for the Senate's impeachment hearings and provide for the Chief Justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court to preside over the impeachment hearings involving the Governor, but not have a vote. =Executive Power ‚Äì Governor= Articles 41 - 59 define the roles and selection of the Executive Branch. The Governor of the State of New Hampshire (originally styled \\"President\\") is the supreme executive magistrate and is titled \\"His Excellency\\". The Governor is given the sole authority to command the New Hampshire National Guard and sole right to sign or veto bills and resolutions passed by the General Court and is charged with the \\"faithful execution of the laws\\". The Governor is elected to a two-year term at the November biennial elections, and must be 30 years old and have been a resident of the state for seven years at the time of election. With the advice of the Executive Council, the Governor has the authority to call the General Court into session when in recess, to adjourn it early, and dissolve the General Court as required for the welfare of the state. The Governor, with the advice of the Council, has the authority to pardon offense not for impeachment; and to nominate and appoint all judicial officers, Attorney General, and all officers of the navy, and general and field officers of the state National Guard. Article 58 states, \\"the governor and council shall be compensated for their services, from time to time, by such grants as the general court shall think reasonable;\\" and Article 59 requires that \\"permanent and honorable salaries\\" be established by law, for the justices of the superior court. =Council= Articles 60 - 66 discuss the selection, ejection and conduct of the five Executive Councilors. =Secretary, Treasurer, etc.= Articles 67 - 70 discuss the duties and selection of the state's treasurer, secretaries and other such officials. =County Treasurer, etc.= Article 71 details the responsibilities and powers of county level officials such as the county sheriffs, county attorneys, county treasurers, registrars of probate, and registrars of deeds. Article 72 details the selection of registrars of deeds, which usually is a countywide position. =Judiciary Power= Articles 72-a. - 81 dictate the rights and responsibilities of the Supreme and Superior Courts as well as other state sanctioned court officers. =Clerks of Courts= Article 82 gives judges of the courts (except probate) the sole authority to appoint clerks to serve office during the pleasure of the judge. Clerks are prohibited from acting as attorneys in the court of which they are a clerk and from drawing any writ originating a civil action. =Encouragement of Literature, Trade, etc.= The first half of Article 83 tasks future legislators to \\"cherish the interest of literature and the sciences, and all seminaries and public schools....\\" The text was amended in 1877 to clarify that state money could not go to religious schools. In 1993, the New Hampshire supreme court agreed with school districts near Claremont in the first of several Claremont cases that Article 83 made equal public education a state responsibility. The Claremont cases began an era in which the supreme court repeatedly found school‚Äìfunding legislation unconstitutional. In 2009, the court found the original suit was moot and the Claremont era ended. The General Court has debated, but has never approved, a constitutional amendment that would align the right of education with the legislature's authority to appropriate funds and the desire for local control. The second half of Article 83, added in 1903, empowers the state to regulate economic activity. It declares a right to \\"free and fair competition in the trades and industries\\" and specifies that a goal of regulation is to \\"prevent...combination, conspiracy, monopoly, or any other unfair means.\\" =Oaths and Subscriptions Exclusion From Offices, etc.= Articles 84 - 101 (excluding Articles 97 and 99) regard the installment of appointed and elected state officials; and the method for the Constitution taking effect, it being enrolled, and methods for proposing amendments. Method of Amendment Unlike the U.S. Constitution, in which amendments are set out beneath the main body (and brackets or strike- through are sometimes used to show text in the main body that an amendment has made inoperative), amendments to the New Hampshire constitution change the text in place. Although a law book with annotations describes amendments to the text, the actual amendment is not included in a presentation of the constitution; only the text as the amendment revised it. An amendment will sometimes add an article; for instance, an article following Article 12 will be called Article 12-a. Amendments are proposed both to make policy changes and to make clerical changes such as gender neutrality. Part II, Article 100 of the constitution provides for the following two methods of proposing amendments to the constitution: =General Court= A 3/5 vote of each house of the General Court is required to send a proposed constitutional amendment to ratification (see below). =Constitutional Convention= A majority vote of both houses of the General Court is required to place the following question on the ballot: \\"Shall there be a convention to amend or revise the constitution?\\" If such question has not been submitted to the people in ten years, the Secretary of State is required by Pt. II, Art. 100 to place the question on the ballot. A majority of qualified voters participating in an election is required to convene a convention. At the next election the delegates are elected by the people, or earlier as provided by the General Court. A 3/5 vote of the number of delegates is required to send a proposed constitutional amendment to ratification (see below). =Ratification= An amendment approved by either of the above methods is sent to the people at the next biennial November election. A 2/3 vote of the qualified voters participating in an election is required to ratify the amendment. If the amendment does not receive this vote, it does not take effect. New Hampshire voters do not have the power to make or repeal laws through referendum, but a handful of proposed constitutional amendments routinely appear on the ballot in most general elections. History On June 5, 1781, a constitutional convention was convened and began writing the state's new constitution. In the Spring of 1782, a draft of the constitution was sent to town meetings for ratification. During the town meetings there were substantial proposed amendments that the Constitution was redrafted by the Convention and resubmitted to town meetings in Fall 1782. The second draft of the 1782 Constitution was met with even more proposed amendments. A third draft was necessary before it was resubmitted and accepted in the town meetings \\"as is.\\" In Spring 1783, a requisite number of town meetings ratified the third draft and it became effective June 2, 1784. On October 31, 1783, the constitution was established and the Convention adjourned sine die, after having declared the constitution ratified. On September 7, 1791, a constitutional convention began drafting 72 amendments to the 1784 Constitution be redrafted into a new whole document and submitted it to the people on February 8, 1792. The revisions of the 1784 Constitution submitted to the people became effective June 5, 1793. Since 1793, there have been only five constitutional conventions. They have proposed 64 amendments, of which the voters have ratified 26. On November 6, 2012, voters for the seventeenth time declined to call a constitutional convention. Before 1980, the only method for amending the constitution was by convention every seven years. The adoption of an amendment to Pt. II, Art. 100 allowed for either the General Court or Constitutional Convention to submit amendments to the people for adoption. 1776 Constitution On January 5, 1776, the Congress of New Hampshire voted in Exeter to establish a civil government, and specified the manner and form that government would have. The Congress ratified the Constitution at the urging of the Continental Congress. The 1776 Constitution did not contain a Bill of Rights, nor was it submitted to the people of New Hampshire. The constitution was the first constitution ever ratified by an American commonwealth. The Constitution established a legislature with two branches: a House of Representatives (or Assembly) and Council. The popularly elected convention which framed this Constitution was called a Congress, and it was to reconstitute itself as the House of Representatives. The House was to select 12 freeholders ‚Äì a certain number from each county ‚Äì to form the upper house, or Council. Should the conflict with Great Britain last beyond 1776, and barring instructions to the contrary from the Continental Congress, the Constitution provided for the popular election of the Councilors. Together the Assembly and Council were responsible for running the government of the colony, including the appointment of all civil and military officers. The Constitution did not provide for a chief executive of any kind.

Kalpavriksha (Devanagari: ‡§ï‡§≤‡•ç‡§™‡§µ‡•É‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑), also known as kalpataru, kalpadruma or kalpapƒÅdapa, is a wish-fulfilling divine tree in Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism. It is mentioned in Sanskrit literature from the earliest sources. It is also a popular theme in Jain cosmology and Buddhism. The Kalpavriksha originated during the Samudra manthan or \\"churning of the ocean\\" along with the Kamadhenu, the divine cow providing for all needs. The king of the gods, Indra, returned with this tree to his paradise. Kalpavriksha is also identified with many trees such as Parijata (Erythrina variegata), Ficus benghalensis, Acacia, Madhuca longifolia, Prosopis cineraria, Bassia butyracea, and mulberry tree (Morus nigra tree). The tree is also extolled in iconography and literature.  Religious beliefs  Kalpavriksha is an artistic and literary theme common to the Hindu Bhagavatas, the Jains and the Buddhists. = In Hinduism = Kalpavriksha with Flowers in Ranchi, Jharkhand Kalpavriksha, the tree of life, also meaning \\"World Tree\\" finds mention in the Vedic scriptures. In the earliest account of the Samudra manthan or \\"churning of the ocean of milk\\" Kalpavriksha emerged from the primal waters during the ocean churning process along with Kamadhenu, the divine cow that bestows all needs. The tree is also said to be the Milky Way or the birthplace of the stars Sirius. The king of the gods, Indra returned with this Kalpavriksha to his abode in paradise and planted it there. The tree also finds mention in the Sanskrit text MƒÅnƒÅsara, part of Shilpa Shastras.Another myth says that Kalpavriksha was located on earth and was transported to Indra's abode after people started misusing it by wishing evil things. In Indra's \\"Devaloka\\" it is said that there are five Kalpavrikshas, which are called Mandana, Parijata, Santana, Kalpavriksha and Harichandana, all of which fulfill various wishes. Kalpavriksha, in particular, is said to be planted at Mt. Meru peak in the middle of Indra's five paradise gardens. It is on account of these wish-granting trees that the asuras waged a perpetual war with the devas as the heavenly gods who exclusively benefited freely from the \\"divine flowers and fruits\\" from the Kalpavriksha, whereas the asuras lived comparatively in penury at the lower part of its \\"trunk and roots\\". The Parijata is often identified with its terrestrial counterpart, the Indian coral tree (Eyrthrina indica), but is most often depicted like a magnolia or frangipani (Sanskrit: champaka) tree. It is described as having roots made of gold, a silver midriff, lapislazuli boughs, coral leaves, pearl flower, gemstone buds, and diamond fruit. It is also said that Ashokasundari was created from a Kalpavriksha tree to provide relief to Parvati from her loneliness. In some versions of Hindu mythology Shiva and Parvati after much painful discussions while parting with their daughter Aranyani gave her away to the divine Kalpavriksha for safe keeping when the demon Andhakasura waged war. Parvati requested Kalpavriksha to bring up her daughter with \\"safety, wisdom, health and happiness,\\" and to make her Vana Devi, the protector of forests. = In Jainism = The wall painting of Kalpavruksha in Saavira Kambada Basadi, Moodbidri, Karnataka In Jain Cosmology Kalpavrikshas are wish- granting trees which fulfill the desires of people in the initial stages of a world cycle. In initial times children are born in pairs (boy and girl) and don't do any karma. There are 10 Kalpavrikshas which grant 10 distinct wishes such as an abode to reside, garments, utensils, nourishment including fruits and sweets, pleasant music, ornaments, fragrant flowers, shining lamps and a radiant light at night. According to Jain cosmology, in the three Aras (unequal periods) of the descending arc (Avasarpini), Kalpavrikshas provided all that was needed, but towards the end of the third ara, the yield from them diminished. Eight types of these trees are described in some texts, each of which provided different objects. Thus from the \\"Madyanga tree\\" delicious and nutritious drinks could be obtained; from the \\"Bhojananga\\", delicious food; from \\"yotiranga\\", light more radiant than the sun and the moon; while from \\"Dopanga\\" came indoor light. Other trees provided homes, musical devices, table ware, fine garments, wreaths and scents. The Tiloya Panatti give the following list: Pananga, Turiyanga, Bhusananga, Vatthanga, Bhoyanga, Alayanga, Diviyanga, Bhayananga, Malanga, Tejanga with excellent drinks, music, ornaments, garments, edibles and ready-made dishes, mansions to live in, lamps, utensils and garlands of flowers respectively while the last type, namely Tejanga, seems to be self-luminous, serving the purpose of heavenly luminaries. = In Buddhism = In Buddhism a small wish granting tree is depicted decorating the upper part of the \\"long-life vase\\" held by \\"longevity deities\\" like Amitayus and Ushnishavijaya. The goddess Shramana devi holds jeweled branch of Kalpavriksha in her left hand. Worship of the Nyagrodha tree as a form of non-human worship is depicted in a Buddhist sculpture at Besnagar. This sculpture in Besnagar, also known as Vidisa (Bhilsa), is dated to third century BC and is exhibited in the Calcutta Museum. In Myanmar, where Theravada Buddhism is practiced, the significance of the Kalpavriksha is in the form of an annual ritual known as Kathina (presenting a robe) in which the laity present gifts to the monks in the form of money trees. At the kingdom of Ketumati's front gates, it is thought four Kalpavrikshas will spring up from the Earth and provide enough valuables to satisfy all of Jambudvƒ´pa for years. = In Sikhism = In Sikhism's Sukhmani Sahib also the tree is referred \\"PaarJaat Eh Har Ko Naam The name of the Lord is the mythological tree\\"  Identification with other trees  Kalpavriksha in Mangaliyawas (near Ajmer, Rajasthan in India) Parijata tree at Kintoor, Barabanki. In different states of India some trees are specifically referred to as the Kalpavriksha. These are stated below. The banyan tree (Ficus benghalensis), also called Nyagrodha tree, which grows throughout the country is referred to as Kalpavriksha or Kaplaptaru because of its ability to amply provide for human needs. The coconut tree (Cocos nucifera) found in most regions of the country is called \\"Kalpavriksha\\", as every part of it is useful in one way or the other. The coconut water inside the nut is a delicious drink. In dried form it is called copra and is used to manufacture oil. The coconut husk, called coir, is used to make rope. Leaves are used to make huts, fans, mats. Palm sugar is made from budding flower. The dried midrib is used to make boats. Ashwatha tree (sacred fig tree) is also known as Kalapvriksha where the deities and Brahma are stated to reside, and it is where sage Narada taught the rishis on the procedure for worshipping the tree and its usefulness. Mahua tree (Madhuca longifolia) holds an important place in the day-to-day life of the tribal people. It is like the Kalpavriksha wish tree called madhu (Madhuca indica). Shami tree (Prosopis cineraria), found in desert areas of the country, called in local dialect as Ajmer or jaant is called Kalpavriksha. In Rajasthan desert area its roots go deep to a depth of . This checks the erosion of the sandy soil of the desert. For this reason the tree stays green even during drought conditions. People of Rajasthan hence regard this tree as Kalpavriksha, because at the time of drought when no grass or fodder is found anywhere the animals are able to sustain by eating its green leaves. Chyur tree in the high altitudes of the Himalayas growing at an altitude between 500 and 1000 m, known as the Indian butter tree (Diploknema butyracea), is called a Kalpavriskha, or tree of paradise by the people of the mountainous region as it yields honey, jaggery and ghee. It is in the shape of an umbrella. In Joshimath in Uttarakhand a mulberry tree, which is said to be 2400 years old, is renowned and revered as the Kalpavriksha as it was the location where, in the 8th century, Adi Sankaracharya did \\"penance\\" under the tree as he considered it an incarnation of Lord Shiva. It is also believed that sage Durvasa meditated under this tree, in Urgam. The mountain slopes of Kailasa are stated to have a profusion of Kalpavrikshas. At Mangaliyawas near Ajmer, Rajasthan, there are two revered trees (Male and Female) which are more than 800 years old, known as Kalpavrikshas. They are worshipped on an Amavasya day in the Hindu month of Shraavana. In Ranchi, Jharkhand, there are three Kalpavrikshas. They are at a locality called Hinoo. In Tamil Nadu's culture, tala (Borassus flabellifer) a variety of Palmyra palm (Borassus), also known as toddy, is referred to as Kalpataru as all its parts have a use. This tree is also native to Asia and South East Asia, has normally a life span of 100 years, grows up to height; its leaves in the shape of a fan are rough texture. The leaves were used for writing in the ancient times. In the Harivansh Puraan, the Parijata, baobab tree, is called a Kalpavriksha, or wish bearing tree, which apart from the village of Kintoor, near Barabanki, Uttar Pradesh, is only found in heaven. The tree has mythological link with prince Arjuna of the Pandava clan who is said to have brought it from heaven. His mother Kunti after whom the village Kintoor is named used to offer flowers from this tree to worship Lord Shiva. It is also said that Lord Krishna brought this tree from heaven to please his wife Satyabhama. Kalpalatha is another wish fulfilling tree, a creeper, which was extolled during the later part of the Aryan period. It is said that a person standing below this tree would be blessed with beautiful ornaments, dresses and even unmarried girls.  In iconography  Cinatamani Lokesvara with a kaprabrikshya, 19th century, gilt bronze, semiprecious stones In iconography, Kalpavriksha, the wish-fulfilling tree, is painted within a picture of a landscape, decorated with flowers, silks, and suspended with jewellery. It is a pattern which has a prominent symbolic meaning. Ornamental Kalpavriksha design was a feature that was adopted on the reverse of the coins and sculptures in the Gupta period. Kalpavriksha is also dated to the Dharmachakra period of Buddhism. The paintings of this period depicting the tree with various branches and leaves have a female figure painted on its top part. The female figure is painted from mast upwards holding a bowl in her hand. Similar depiction of female figure with tree representing it as presiding deity was a notable feature during the Sunga period as seen in the image of \\"Salabhanvka\\" in the railing pillars. In most paintings of Kalpavriksha Shiva and Parvati are a common feature. It forms a canopy over Shiva. In one painting Paravati is paying obeisance to Lord Shiva with her hands held up in adoration when she is blessed with a stream of water from the Kalpavriksha.  In literature  A Kalpavriksha is mentioned in the Sanskrit work MƒÅnƒÅsara as a royal insignia. In HemƒÅdri's work Caturvargacƒ´ntama, the Kalpavriksha is said to be a tree of gold and gem stones. In poetry Kalpavriksha is compared to Lakshmi as its sister emerging from the sea. It is born to the Naga King Kumuda, the fifth descendant of Takshaka, along with his sister Kumudavati. It emerged from below the bed of the Sarayu River challenging Kusa considered an incarnation of Vishnu just in the disguise as a son. Kalidasa, in his poetry Meghad≈´ta epitomizing wish-fulfilling trees found in the capital of the Yaksha king extols the virtues of Kalpavriksha as \\"the dainties and fineries for the fair women of Alaka, coloured clothes for the body, intoxicating drinks for exciting glances of the eyes, and flowers for decorating the hair and ornaments of various designs\\".

The Flour Mill was located at the mouth of Niles Canyon, then called Alameda Ca√±on, which served as the major course of Alameda Creek. A second Flour Mill was built in 1856, the stone foundation of which may still be seen today. Vallejo Flour Mill ruins, CHL #46 (2008) The ruins of the Vallejo Flour Mill is located at the northeast corner of Niles Canyon Road (State Route 84) and Mission Boulevard (State Route 238) in Vallejo Mill Historical Park. In 1932, it was designated a California Historical Landmark (#46). Vallejo Flour Mill historical marker CHL #46 (2008), on Mission Blvd, Fremont, CA A watercolor painting of the 1856 Flour Mill, done by Carmelita Vallejo, J & J Vallejo's daughter then finishing her studies at the San Jose Notre Dame Academy, showed several buildings surrounding a three-story Flour Mill building with a large wooden wheel on the north side. According to the Alameda County Gazette (January 1857), the wheel was the overshot design, 30 feet in diameter and 8 feet broad, and the millstone was 4 feet in diameter. The Flour Mill cost $5,000 and had a capacity of 150 barrels of flour a day. Impact of the first transcontinental railroad In 1865-1866, Western Pacific, one of three companies to build the first transcontinental railroad, built of track north of San Jose towards Sacramento. This railroad segment skirted the Vallejo Flour Mills at the mouth of Alameda Ca√±on (now Niles Canyon) and reached halfway into the canyon, about a mile past the Farwell Bridge near milepost 33 where it stopped. The Western Pacific used 500 Chinese laborers to grade and construct the rail line into the rugged canyon with its tight curves and narrow banks. Four major timber through (Howe) truss bridges were built to cross Alameda Creek and Arroyo de la Laguna Creek. In addition to building wooden bridges and grading the railroad bed, the laborers built culverts, retaining walls, and bridge piers in masonry. In October 1866, construction was halted because of disagreements between the railroad‚Äôs contractors and its financiers. In June 1869, the Central Pacific Railroad, a subsidiary of which had acquired the Western Pacific and Oakland Point in 1868, restarted work on the railroad line through Alameda Ca√±on, also using Chinese laborers, and added a new line from the mouth of the canyon northwest towards Oakland. An aqueduct, built to carry water needed for the Vallejo Flour Mills, ran parallel to the present Niles Canyon Road. When the construction of the first transcontinental railroad in the canyon resumed at the Mills in 1869, Central Pacific Railroad rebuilt the aqueduct in masonry. More importantly, the railroad built a junction west of the mills and dwellings, called the Vallejo Mills Junction, to service both the 1869 transcontinental rail line as well as the 1866 Western Pacific San Jose line. That same year, J & J Vallejo's son, Plutarco Vallejo, with surveyor Luis Castro, laid out the first subdivision of 23 lots along Vallejo Street south of the mills and dwellings. The subdivision plat, dated 3 November 1869, was recorded as Vallejo Mills, a.k.a. Vallejo Mill, Vallejo's Mill, or Vallejo's Mills. Also in November, the Transcript reported that a new town will be laid out on a quarter section of land, purchased by the railroad, at Vallejo Mills. Vallejo Mill station sign on the railroad The settlement was located at the rail junction of two main lines: the then-new 1869 Central Pacific line that went northwest to Oakland and the older 1866 Western Pacific line south to San Jose. After the completion of the First transcontinental railroad to the Pacific coast, Central Pacific renamed by December 1869 the Vallejo Mill station and junction as Niles, after their railroad attorney and stockholder, Addison Niles, who became two years later associate justice on the California Supreme Court. Central Pacific also built in 1870 a railroad depot, complete with a restaurant and saloon, at the Niles junction for the convenience of the transferring train passengers. Thereafter, the Vallejo Mills settlement became known as Niles and the byline Niles, Cal started to appear in newspapers by the mid-1870s. In 1956, Niles became a district within the city of Fremont. The people of Vallejo Mills in 1857 received their mail by way of Centreville until after the railroad was built. Then the name of the place changed to Niles and an express office was established... After... two years it was moved to the depot. It was not until 1873 that Niles had a Post- office, it opening in November of that year. --handwritten account by Mrs. Snyder from Niles, 1904 Similarly, Alameda Ca√±on became known as Niles Canyon, after the Central Pacific renamed in 1869 the Vallejo Mill station near the mouth of the canyon, Niles.

Originally developed for early inkjet printers in 1984, PCL has been released in varying levels for thermal, matrix, and page printers. HP-GL/2 and PJL are supported by later versions of PCL. PCL is occasionally and incorrectly said to be an abbreviation for Printer Control Language which actually is another term for page description language. PCL levels 1 through 5 overview PCL levels 1 through 5e/5c are command-based languages using control sequences that are processed and interpreted in the order they are received. At a consumer level, PCL data streams are generated by a print driver. PCL output can also be easily generated by custom applications. *PCL 1 was introduced in 1984 on the HP ThinkJet 2225 and provides basic text and graphics printing with a maximum resolution of 150 dpi (dots per inch). *PCL 1+ was released with the HP QuietJet 2227. *PCL 2 added Electronic Data Processing/Transaction functionality. *PCL 3 was introduced in 1984 with the original HP LaserJet. This added support for bitmap fonts and increased the maximum resolution to 300 dpi. Other products with PCL 3 support were the HP DeskJet ink jet printer, HP 2932 series matrix printers and HP RuggedWriter 2235 matrix printers. PCL 3 is still in use on several impact printers which replaced the obsolete HP models. *PCL 3+ (mono) and PCL 3c+ (color) are used on later HP DeskJet and HP PhotoSmart products. *PCL 3GUI is used in the HP DesignJet and some DeskJet series printers. It uses a compressed raster format that is not compatible with standard PCL 3. *PCL 4 was introduced on the HP LaserJet Plus in 1985, adding macros, larger bitmapped fonts and graphics. PCL 4 is still popular for many applications. *PCL 5 was released on the HP LaserJet III in March 1990, adding Intellifont font scaling (developed by Compugraphic, now part of Agfa), outline fonts and HP-GL/2 (vector) graphics. *PCL 5e (PCL 5 enhanced) was released on the HP LaserJet 4 in October 1992 and added bi- directional communication between the printer and the PC and Windows fonts. *PCL 5c introduced color support on the HP PaintJet 300XL and HP Color LaserJet in 1992. PCL 6 overview HP introduced PCL 6 around 1995 with the HP LaserJet 4000 series printers. It consists of: *PCL 6 \\"Enhanced\\": An object-oriented PDL optimized for printing from GUI interfaces such as Windows and compressed to optimize throughput. Formerly known as PCL XL or PXL. *PCL 6 Standard: Equivalent to PCL 5e or PCL 5c, intended to provide backward compatibility. *Font synthesis: Provides scalable fonts, font management and storage of forms and fonts. PCL 6 \\"Enhanced\\" architecture was altered to be more modular and to be more easily modified for future HP printers, that it prints complex graphics faster, that it reduces network traffic, and has higher quality. In early implementations, HP did not market PCL 6 well, thus causing some confusion in terminology. PCL XL was renamed to PCL 6 Enhanced, but many third-party products still use the older term. Some products may claim to be PCL 6 compliant, but may not include the PCL 5 backward compatibility. PCL 6 Enhanced is primarily generated by the printer drivers under Windows and CUPS. Due to its structure and compression methodology, custom applications rarely use it directly. PCL 6 Enhanced is a stack-based, object-oriented protocol, similar to PostScript. However, it is restricted to binary encoding as opposed to PostScript, which can be sent either as binary code or as plain text. The plain-text commands and code examples shown in the PCL programming documentation are meant to be compiled with a utility like HP's JetASM before being sent to a printer. PCL 6 Enhanced is designed to match the drawing model of Windows GDI. In this way, the Windows printer driver simply passes through GDI commands with very little modification, leading to faster return-to-application times. Microsoft has extended this concept with its next-generation XPS format, and printer implementations of XPS are being developed. This is not a new idea: it is comparable with Display Postscript and Apple's Quartz, and is in contrast to \\"GDI Printers\\" where a compressed bitmap is sent to the printer. =PCL 6 class revisions= Class 1.1 *Draw tools: Support drawing lines, arcs/ellipses/chords, (rounded) rectangles, polygons, B√©zier paths, clipped paths, raster images, scanlines, raster operations. *Color handling: Support 1/4/8-bit palettes, RGB/grey color space. Support custom halftone patterns (max 256 patterns). *Compression: Supports RLE. *Units of measurement: Inch, millimeter, tenth of millimeter. *Paper handling: Support custom or predefined sets of paper size, including common Letter, Legal, A4, etc. Can choose paper from manual feed, trays, cassettes. Paper can be duplexed horizontally or vertically. Paper can be oriented in portrait, landscape, or 180 degree rotation of the former two. *Font: Supports bitmap or TrueType fonts, 8 or 16-bit code points. Choosing character set uses different symbol set code from PCL 5. When bitmap font is used, many scaling commands are unavailable. When TrueType font is used, variable length descriptors, continuation blocks are not supported. Outline font can be rotated, scaled, or sheared. Class 2.0 *Compression: Added JPEG compression. A Proprietary variant of JPEG-like compression optimized for integer hardware called JetReady is used in a few HP Color Laserjet models (at the time of writing, 3 models, CLJ 3500, 3550, 3600). Those models require Class 3.0 inputs. *Paper handling: Media can redirected to different output bins (up to 256). Added A6 and Japanese B6 preset media sizes. Added Third cassette preset, 248 external tray media sources. *Font: Text can be written vertically. Class 2.1 *Color handling: Added Color matching feature. *Compression: Added Delta Row. *Paper handling: Orientation, media size are optional when declaring a new page. Added B5, JIS 8K, JIS 16K, JIS Exec paper sizes. Class 2.2 *Compression: Added JFIF. Class 3.0 *Color handling: Allow using different halftone settings for vector or raster graphics, text. Supports adaptive halftoning. *Protocol: Supports PCL passthrough, allowing PCL 5 features to be used by PCL 6 streams. However, some PCL 6 states are not preserved when using this feature. *Font: Supports PCL fonts. JetReady printers (CLJ 3500/3550/3600) use undocumented extensions but otherwise mandate Class 3.0 inputs. PJL overview PJL (Printer Job Language) was introduced on the HP LaserJet IIIsi.

In 1977 Mohammed Babar moved to the United States with his family when he was two years old and grew up in Queens, New York. He attended a Military Academy, an all boy military boarding school on Long Island. He studied pharmacy at St. John's University in New York City but dropped out. He adopted radical views of Sunni Islam during the Gulf War when he was employed in a number of unskilled jobs including valet parking. He joined various groups including the al-Muhajiroun Mohammed Babar's mother worked in the World Trade Center on the 9th floor and survived the Terrorist Attacks on September 11th. He supplied materials such as Night vision goggles, sleeping bags, waterproof socks and ponchos and money to high-ranking al-Qaeda officials in South Waziristan. In the summer of 2003 he helped to set up a terrorist training camp where Mohammad Sidique Khan, the leader of the 2005 London suicide bombers, and several other British terrorists learned how to manufacture explosives. Detention in America He was arrested in New York City in April 2004 after his return from Pakistan, and on June 2, 2004, pleaded guilty to five counts of providing, and conspiring to provide, money and supplies to Al Qaeda terrorists fighting in Afghanistan against U.S., international forces, or the Northern Alliance. Facing up to 70 years in prison in U.S. he agreed to cooperate with authorities. =Operation Crevice= Babar was the star witness in the case against seven terrorist suspects arrested in Britain in March 2004 as part of Operation Crevice. He has been flown to London to give evidence in the case, and arrived at court amid heavy security, driven from a police station in an armoured convoy with a helicopter overhead. He had been given immunity from prosecution in relation to the charges the British defendants faced. During his testimony he claimed to have been part of two separate attempts to kill General Pervez Musharraf in 2002 and admitted that he would be facing the death penalty in Pakistan if he was not working for the FBI. He also said that he had associated with Abu Hamza al-Masri and Omar Bakri Mohammed. The prosecution claimed that Babar was part of the plot and had \\"an insight as an insider into the events and plans, which an outsider could not have.\\" The counsel for the defence called Babar \\"a liar, nothing more than a conceited fantasist.\\" He also told a British court during 17 days of testimony in 2007 that he ran training camps in Pakistan for Islamic militants and nurtured a generation of homegrown British terrorists. Babar is still working with the British under a deal that he will not be charged as long as he cooperates. =Momin Khawaja= In 2008 Mohammed Babar testified in a trial against the accused Momin Khawaja, in Ottawa, Canada.

There are two versions of the software, Anyzing and Zingthing. Both use a patented multi-cursor interface. The Zing team meeting and learning system depends on keyboard entry skills and lack of such skills can be a barrier to effective participation in the meeting or learning activity. Introduction A facilitator uses Zing to keep time and follow the agenda. A Zing facilitator often asks the group to follow a pre-determined meeting etiquette of four steps; Talk, Type, Read and Review. Participants are asked to first talk about the question or agenda item currently in focus on the screen. They do this as a group or split into pairs or groups of three. They are then invited to type their responses into the system. When everyone has finished typing, or the allotted time has expired, the group reads the responses and conclude the activity by reviewing what's been recorded, looking for key themes, common patterns or stand-out entries. The system includes a range of tools for brainstorming, sorting and voting. The system is also used for learning activities. Thinking methods such as Edward De Bono's Six Thinking Hats have been used to structure Zing meetings. The number of participants in a group can vary from as few as four to as many as four hundred if people share keyboards or laptops and work in sub groups. A number of independent academics are using Zing in their research for meetings, e-learning and gathering qualitative data. * Alison Elliot, Australian Council for Educational Research * Brian Caldwell, Professorial Fellow in the Department of Education Policy and Management of the University of Melbourne * Jim Callan, a lecturer in marketing, Central Queensland University * Robert Fitzgerald, Associate Dean Research, Faculty of Education at the University of Canberra * Linda Newman, a senior lecturer of the School of Education of the University of Western Sydney * Greg Whymark, an Associate Professor in Information Systems, Central Queensland University Background The software was first developed in Sydney, Australia, under the name Grouputer by John Findlay. A change in company ownership lead to a split and Grouputer Solutions and Zing Technologies went their separate ways. Zing software is now used in Australasia, Europe and North America. Zing software is designed to assist teams create new knowledge together and has been variously categorized as groupware, instructional technology, Group Decision Support Systems (GDSS), Decision Support Systems (DSS), electronic meeting systems and a Team Learning System.  Versions  * AnyZing requires a single computer, a data projector (or several monitors via a VGA splitter) and several wireless keyboards which are connected to the computer via a multiple USB hub. This version started life as Grouputer when the software was called Decisions. It had 3 components called Create, Meet and Learn. This has now become known as AnyZing, and the three components have given way to a more flexible multi-layered structure which allows the process to follow a proposition through up to seven levels. Students found 'Grouputer' a bit archaic and when asked suggested an alternative, namely, to put a bit of Zing into the session. * ZingThing requires a server and client computers, one for the facilitator. Additional participants use extra wireless keyboards attached to the client machines. Zingthing started life as WebGrouputer and its early development was undertaken by the CSIRO. This java based network enabled version requires a relatively fast internet or network connection. Zingthing's java implementation favours Windows and some features are missing in the Linux or Mac OS clients. The networking function of Zingthing means that a number of laptops can be linked using a Wireless LAN.

He was a prominent scholar, humanitarian, and early champion for human rights. Born to a prominent Cossack family (he was a descendant of Ivan Bohun) in Kryva, Tarascha county, in Kyiv Oblast, Honcharenko was the first Ukrainian political √©migr√© to arrive in the United States. He graduated from the Kyiv Theological Seminary and entered the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra. He was sent to Athens in 1857 to serve as deacon at the embassy's church, where he began to contribute anonymous articles to Alexander Herzen's London-based Kolokol that clamored for the emancipation of Russian serfs and denounced his own church for supporting such an unequal system. These articles caused much unrest in Russia, and after months of trying to determine the identity of the mystery writer, Russian authorities discovered and arrested him in 1860. He was able to escape from the Russian prison in Constantinople by disguising himself as a Turk and walking out the front door. After his escape, he traveled to London to rejoin the Kolokol staff until the newspaper discontinued publication upon the freeing of the serfs, then returned to Athens again. Afterwards, he traveled extensively to Syria, Jerusalem, Egypt and Turkey. While in Alexandria, he served as confessor to Leo Tolstoy. Returning to London, he met Italian patriot Giuseppe Mazzini, who advised him to immigrate to the United States, which he did in 1865. After his arrival, he traveled around the country, first to Philadelphia where he met the woman who would become his wife. In New York City, he established the first Orthodox liturgy in the U.S. outside of Alaska. He also helped establish a Greek Orthodox church in New Orleans and did work in Alaska before finally settling in San Francisco. Before immigrating, he had changed his name to protect his family from persecution for his anti-Russian writings. Through his travels, he became friends with many notable Americans, among them Eugene Schuyler, Horace Greeley, Charles R. Dana, Hamilton Fish, Henry Wager Halleck, William H. Seward and Henry George. A plain-spoken man, Honcharenko was known to openly denounce his own church for corruption, immorality, and other failings, so much so that he was declared a schismatic. While living in San Francisco, he published The Alaska Herald, aimed at Russian residents of Alaska, from 1868 to 1872, which included both Russian and Ukrainian language supplements. The Russian supplement titled Svoboda (–°–≤–æ–±–æ–¥–∞ : Freedom) was the first Russian language newspaper in the U.S. After founding a farm, \\"Ukraina Ranch\\", located in Hayward, California, in 1873, he continued to publish political literature, which was smuggled into Czarist Russia. These actions made him a thorn in the side of pro-Tsarist Russians, who called his writings \\"the drivelling of a half crazy old man.\\" He and his wife Albina are buried on the farm, which is now registered as California Historical Landmark #1025, located in Garin Regional Park near California State University, Hayward.

The algal body (thallus) is composed of calcified green segments. Calcium carbonate is deposited in its tissues, making it inedible to most herbivores. However one species, Halimeda tuna, was described as pleasant to eat with oil, vinegar, and salt. As in other members of the order Bryopsidales, individual organisms are made up of single multi-nucleate cells. Whole meadows may consist of a single individual alga connected by fine threads running through the substrate.The Cell Biology of the Bryopsidales Halimeda is responsible for distinctive circular deposits in various parts of the Great Barrier Reef on the north-east coast of Queensland, Australia. Halimeda beds form in the western or lee side of outer shield reefs where flow of nutrient-rich water from the open sea allows them to flourish, and are the most extensive, actively accumulating Halimeda beds in the world.

Capps (1864‚Äì1935). Capps was launched 31 May 1942 by Gulf Shipbuilding Corp., Chickasaw, Ala., sponsored by Mrs. C. G. Stokes; commissioned 23 June 1943, Lieutenant Commander B. E. S. Trippensee in command; and reported to the Atlantic Fleet. Service history =United States Navy= Capps cleared New York 7 September 1943 to begin the operations which would see her fighting the Axis powers on both sides of the world, sailing in convoy for Scapa Flow, Scotland. She arrived 17 September for exercises with the British Home Fleet. In a mixed task force of American and other Allied ships, led by the aircraft carrier , Capps stood out of Scapa Flow 3 October to cross the Arctic Circle for the first raid on German shipping at Norway's port of Bod√∏, where coal and iron ore were loaded for Germany. Ships and docks were left burning and sinking, and Capps returned to Scapa Flow unscathed by German air attack. On 7 October, Capps sailed with three other destroyers in a dash to Gibraltar, from which they escorted two British battleships and two aircraft carriers back to Scapa Flow. Thus augmented, the Home Fleet, with Capps in company, swept into northern waters from 29 October to 8 November to guard the movement of a convoy for Murmansk, and to hunt for the German battleships and . Capps was detached at Scapa Flow 22 November 1943 and sailed to Boston, arriving 4 December. Twenty days later she got underway for New Orleans, where she joined the escort of a troop convoy bound for Pearl Harbor, arriving 20 January 1944. Guarding another convoy, Capps sailed on to Funafuti, from which she put out for patrol duty off Tarawa, Makin, and Kwajalein as these islands were assaulted to open the Marshall Islands operation. Forced back to San Francisco by a boiler casualty, Capps returned to action at Majuro 23 April, and was assigned to area escort, antisubmarine, and antiaircraft patrols. Convoy duty took her to Pearl Harbor in May, returning to Eniwetok 14 June. Based there, the destroyer screened service forces supporting the invasion of the Marianas, then moved forward to Manus in August to continue operations with the screen of the 3rd Fleet logistics group in the western Carolines operations. The ships whose service forces Capps protected carried out the crucial attacks on Japanese bases which prepared for the Leyte operation, and Capps herself joined the screen of a carrier group for air strikes on Manila on 25 November. She continued her activities with the 3rd Fleet until the close of the year, when she reported for a month of duty on radar picket station, in air-sea rescue, and escorting convoys from Saipan to Guam, Eniwetok, and Ulithi. On 1 February 1945, she reported at Ulithi to train with underwater demolition teams for the invasion of Iwo Jima, for which she sailed 14 February. Arriving off Iwo Jima 16 February 1945, Capps fired in the intensive preinvasion bombardment. Her underwater demolition teams were skillfully landed and began their work of preparing the beaches for assault, and Capps remained on the firing line for 3 weeks, hurling more than 2,600 five-inch projectiles into the caves and hillsides of the tenaciously defended island. Her antiaircraft guns fought off almost nightly air attacks and bombing raids, and each night almost constant illumination fire was thrown up to prevent surprise attacks ashore. With only 8 days of resupply behind her, Capps sailed in the screen of escort carriers bound for the invasion of Okinawa. For the next 82 days, broken only by 6 hours at anchor in Kerama Retto. Capps sailed through the mined waters south of the Nansei Shoto, guarding the escort carriers, rescuing downed aviators, and fighting back kamikaze attacks. Although a kamikaze exploded close aboard on 3 April 1945, Capps came through the operation unscathed. Ordered back to a stateside overhaul, Capps arrived at San Pedro, Calif., 9 July. She was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Long Beach 15 January 1947, and was loaned to Spain under the Military Assistance Program 15 May 1957. Capps as the Spanish Lepanto (D21). =Spanish Navy= The ship served in the Spanish Navy as Lepanto (D21), named after the 1571 Battle of Lepanto, in which the Holy League led by Spain defeated the Ottoman Empire. She was stricken 31 December 1985 and scrapped. Awards Capps received seven battle stars for her World War II service.

During the 1890s, the oyster industry thrived until it became the single most important fishery in the state. According to the description provided by the California Office of Historic Preservation, Moses Wicks is supposed to have been the first to bring seed oysters around Cape Horn and implant them in the San Leandro beds. The oyster industry in San Francisco Bay was at its height around the turn of the 20th century. It reached a secondary peak by 1911 and then faded away because of polluted conditions of the bay. The former site of the oyster beds was named a California Historical Landmark (#824) and is located in the San Leandro Marina. The historical marker has been stolen but the mounting holes remain in a large mosaic depicting oyster harvesting early in the 1900s. A photograph of the site is available online.

Solano ran unsuccessfully for Lieutenant Governor of New Mexico in the 2010 Primary election under the Democratic party. Solano served nearly eight years as sheriff before resigning 1 month before his term was to end. On November 29, 2016 Greg Solano was in the news again when he donated a kidney to Retired District Judge Michael Vigil who was suffering from kidney failure . Personal life Greg Solano was born November 15, 1963 in Santa Fe, NM. Greg Solano married Antoinette Solano on May 19, 1984, they have two children and six grandchildren. Antoinette is a former employee of the State of New Mexico. Antoinette and Greg now work together in the Self Storage industry. Greg Solano is also a prolific woodworker using CNC, Wood Turning, and traditional furniture making in his art . Political career Solano was a former President of the Santa Fe Police Officers Association, the City Police Union. During his presidency, the union became the first certified and recognized City of Santa Fe Union. He lost re-election as president in 1994 after Mayor Debbie Jaramillo appointed a controversial black police chief Don Grady. He was caught in between union members who wanted the chief removed and those who felt the fight for removal was racist in nature. He lost the election to the pro removal faction. He then left the police department in 1994 and first ran for sheriff in 1998, losing to then Under Sheriff Ray Sisneros by a slim margin. In 2002, Solano ran again for sheriff against a field of two other Democrats and one Republican. After winning a close primary in June, he went on to win 70% of the vote in the November general election. As sheriff, he raised deputy pay by 21% and in doing so stopped a flood of deputies leaving for other departments as well as filling often-vacant positions. Solano took on the privatization of jails in Santa Fe County after the problem-plagued jails formerly run by private companies received widespread criticism. He fought for the adult and juvenile jails return to public control ending the counties association with private companies. The fight over removing private companies from running the jail created conflict with the County Commission who was leary of government control of the jail and juvenile facilities. After the county took control of the jail and juvenile facility the Commission voted to remove the Sheriff's Office from having any authority over running the jail and juvenile facilities. He was involved in a settlement agreement with the United States Department of Justice over complaints and deficiencies found in audits of the adult facility prior to his administration. Sheriff Solano also took on drunk driving issues when he fought for local ordinances allowing for the taking and auctioning of repeat offenders automobiles and the placement of breath test machines in local liquor establishments. The most controversial of his driving while intoxicated ideas was to place the information and photos of repeat offenders on the Sheriff's Office website. Sheriff Solano later expressed regret over passing legislation to seize vehicles of drunk drivers after the city attempted to seize one of his vehicles when his daughter was arrested in the vehicle. Solano fought the seizure in district court and the City of Santa Fe returned the vehicle when it appeared the city might lose the case. The City of Santa Fe was in fear that if Solano would win the case the entire seizure program could be ruled illegal and rather than face the possibility of losing the program all together the city attorney dismissed the seizure case. In September 2005, Solano announced his re-election bid for the office of Sheriff in the June 2006 Democratic Primary. The Santa Fe Reporter wrote a cover story on his life called \\"Behind the Badge \\" which was published May 3, 2006. In June 2006 Sheriff Solano handily won re-election with 64% of the vote. He was challenged by one of his deputies who ran an increasingly negative campaign which failed to garner enough support to remove Sheriff Solano from office. Sheriff Solano begins his second four-year term January 1, 2007 having no Republican opponent in the General Election. The Sheriff's office is term limited with only two consecutive four year terms allowed. On August 27, 2008 Sheriff Solano announced he would run for Lieutenant Governor of New Mexico in the 2010 Primary election under the Democratic party. In January 2010 Solano dropped his bid for Lieutenant Governor citing fundraising difficulties . Resignation/Embezzlement On November 24, 2010 Democrat Solano resigned as Sheriff of Santa Fe County after admitting to selling police and county property for years, including protective body armor vests to members of the military using eBay. \\"I have done some things that I should not have done and am ready to come clean and face the consequences,\\" Greg Solano, sheriff of Sante Fe county, said in a statement. Solano, saying his family faced financial difficulties, admitted selling property that included cell phones, flashlights, police belts, holsters and the protective vests. \\"During the last few years I have taken these vests and sold them online, mostly to military personnel who wanted them for extra protection overseas,\\" Solano said. \\"This was wrong, illegal, unethical and dishonest.\\" Solano said the body vests he sold were several years old and no longer recommended for use by law enforcement. State police said they have been investigating an embezzlement charge against Solano for the past four months. State police spokesman Eric Garcia said the amount of property sold by Solano had not yet been determined. But he said \\"the scheme was facilitated through EBay where Solano would sell items illegally.\\" He said police investigators are working with the local district attorney's office and the case is ongoing. Solano said he has turned over evidence and promised to cooperate with authorities. \\"I will accept the consequences for my actions. Although my home is threatened with foreclosure and I am now unemployed, I plan to pay back what I took,\\" Solano said. Solano was praised in the media for the way he handled the scandal and for taking immediate responsibility saving taxpayer dollars and resources in the investigation and prosecution .http://www.riograndesun.com/opinion/editorials/in-the-end-solanodid-the- right-thing/article_5ad09621-e477-58cb-8151-b5505f535689.html Robert Garcia, Solano's undersheriff was sworn in as interim County Sheriff. Garcia was subsequently elected as Sheriff by the citizens of Santa Fe County in the election of November 2, 2011 and began his first term on January 1, 2012. On July 20, 2011, Solano pleaded guilty in District Court as part of a plea agreement to five counts of fraud for embezzling county property and selling the items for his own gain on eBay. The plea deal came eight months after Solano resigned as sheriff and admitted auctioning the items for personal profit. Solano was sentenced to 3 months in jail and $25,000 restitution as well as 5 years probation. Solano was released from jail after 6 weeks with good time. Solano successfully finished his probation in 2016. Kidney Donation In November 2016 Solano again made local news headlines when he donated a kidney to retired District Court Judge Michael Vigil. Solano said he had known the Judge since he was 20 years old and Judge Vigil helped him gain custody of his siblings. Greg Solano's Mother died when Solano was 20 years old and when Solano needed an attorney to legally gain custody of his 3 siblings Judge Vigil, then an attorney represented Solano on a Pro Bono basis. Thirty years later in 2015 Solano found out his old attorney, now a retired judge needed a kidney Solano called and offered one of his. Approximately 40 people offered and tested to donate the kidney. Solano was the only match. The testing and preparation took approximately a year and in November 2016 for during the thanksgiving holiday the former sheriff donated his kidney in a double surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix Arizona. While a few said Solano may be trying to redeem himself in the public eye, Solano said his criminal conviction and the kidney donation were unrelated. \\"He's a good man,\\" he said of Vigil a day after he'd been released from the hospital. \\"I did it for that reason and that reason only. Not to, like, fix my appearance with the community or anything like that.\\" Social Media Solano is net savvy (he's known as the \\"Blogging Sheriff\\"). Solano maintains an active presence on Twitter and Facebook and regularly engages with his thousands of followers. Writing Greg Solano is also a writer with his short story \\"From Baghdad to Santa Fe \\" winning second place in a local writing contest earning him the title of published author.

Rewari has a sex ratio of 898 females for every 1000 males. The total literacy rate is 80.99%, which for males is 91.44% and for females is 69.57%. The population is overwhelmingly Hindu (98.76%), while a very small minority practices Islam (0.63%), Sikhism (0.20%), Jainism (0.17%), among others (0.24%). Economy Proximity with the Delhi and the presence of minerals in the district has allowed Rewari to possess a mixed type of economy. Since its formation in 1989, the number of workers employed in agriculture has come down from 54.7% to 33.8% in 2011. The workforce has been absorbed in the growing tertiary and secondary sectors. =Industry= The city of Rewari was historically known for its brassworks and turbans. But before its formation in 1989, the district had only two medium scale industrial units. The formation of the district coincided with economic liberalisation in India and movement of industries from Delhi to the National Capital Region in its periphery. Industrial growth was also aided by the creation of industrial estates like Dharuhera in Rewari and Industrial Model Township in Bawal. Consequently, the number of medium and large scale units in the district has increased to 168 as o. etc. The various medium scale units manufacture products like brass/copper sheets, coils/cables, synthetic yarn, plastic products, printing paper, medicines, beer, ready made garments, machinery, electrical products etc. =Agriculture= Out of the total 159,400 hectares of available land, 120,897 hectares or 83.79% land is used for agriculture. Rewari is deficient in rainfall and has to depend on manual irrigation. Slope of the district, from south to north, is a great hindrance in bringing water from north using gravity flow. To overcome this, work on Jawaharl Lal Nehru (JLN) canal was started in 1974-75 to bring water by successive lifts using high capacity pumps. The JLN feeder is 104 kilometres long channel taking off from tail of Delhi parallel branch at Khubru. Even so, most of the irrigation is still done through tube wells. The crops grown in the district are broadly divided into two categories - Kharif or Sawani crops grown in the summer between June and October and Rabi or Sadhi crops grown in winter between November and harvested in April/May. Any crop which does not fall within these two harvests is called Zaid crop and its harvest is called Zaid Kharif or Zaid Rabi depending on the harvest with which it is assessed. Major Kharif crop grown in the district is bajra (pearl millet) in over 60,000 hectares of land. Rewari is among the top five producers of bajra in Haryana. Minor crops include paddy, jowar (sorghum), cotton and Kharif vegetables like onion, turnip, cucumber etc. Jowar is cultivated mainly as fodder for livestock. Animals are fed on bajra throughout the year due to lack of green fodder. Major Rabi crops are wheat and oilseeds while minor ones are barley, gram and Rabi vegetables. Wheat is an important wheat crop and is grown in about 50,000 hectares of land. Rapeseed and mustard seed are important cash crops grown alongside wheat in the Rabi season. Rewari is ranked third in Haryana in the production of rapeseed and mustard seed. Toria (an oilseed) is cultivated as Zaid Kharif and vegetables, melon and green fodder as Zaid Rabi. Farmers make intensive use of agriculture machinery and modern fertilizers to increase productivity. During 2010-2011, 6,427 tractors, 2,309 combine harvesters and tubewells 24,181 were in use in the district. During the same period over 50,000 tonnes of chemical fertilizers were used. Rewari receives average annual rainfall of 569.6 mm. Lack of green fodder means that Rewari has comparatively less numbers of animals reared than other districts of Haryana. As of 2012, livestock in the district numbered 290,272 which is 3.3% of total livestock in Haryana. Poultry stock numbered 739,732. Rewari has own Commodity(Mandi) for nearby farmers. Rewari Mandi is the biggest mandi in nearby 70 km area in Haryana. The main area of supply from this mandi is mustard, wheat & vagitables from the local farmers. Politics The district consists of three assembly constituencies - Rewari, Bawal and Kosli. Rewari and Bawal come in the Gurgaon Lok Sabha constituency while Kosli comes in Rohtak. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Bhartiya Janata Party managed to win all three assembly segments in the district. In Legislative Assembly elections, held later in the same year, the BJP again won all three seats.

It connects Civic with South Canberra. Specifically, it runs between City Hill and Capital Hill. The road carries National Route 23.  History  The first Commonwealth Avenue Bridge was constructed in 1928; that replaced a ford across the Molonglo River; and two earlier bridges. The current bridge was completed in 1963.  Description  Commonwealth Avenue is a six-lane-wide road with a wide median down the middle. The road crosses Lake Burley Griffin over the Commonwealth Avenue Bridge. The road is connected with Parkes Way by freeway style on-ramps. Along its length on the northern side are the Roman Catholic Archbishop's residence and Commonwealth Park. On the south side of the lake the road is lined with large trees and is bounded by the suburb of Parkes on the east and Yarralumla on the west. Significant sites along this stretch include the Albert Hall, the Hotel Canberra (Hyatt) and the High Commissions of the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Canada. Upon reaching Capital Hill, the road turns into Capital Circle which circles around Parliament House before connecting with Adelaide Avenue which connects it with Woden Valley. There is a ramp at the end of Commonwealth Avenue which allows access to Parliament House. Between the spans on the southern side are four granite stones from the 1817 Waterloo Bridge across the River Thames in London, two at each end of the bridge.

History The winery was established by Carl Wente in 1883 on 47 acres of land. Having received training in wines while working for Charles Krug of Napa Valley, Wente purchased a few vineyards and land of excellent soil. In 1934 his sons, Ernest and Herman, introduced California's first varietal wine label, Sauvignon Blanc. In 1936, they introduced the first varietally labeled Chardonnay. The efforts of the Wente family, including pioneering night-time mechanical harvesting and being a leader in sustainable winegrowing practices, have helped establish the Livermore Valley as one of the premier wine-growing areas of California. Since then, it has expanded to over 2,000 acres (8 km¬≤), plus an additional 700 acres (3 km¬≤) in Arroyo Seco. Wente Clone The Wente clone is budwood that is used to plant Chardonnay at many California vineyards. In 1912, 2nd Generation Winegrower Ernest Wente took cuttings from the University of Montpellier viticultural nursery in France. Cuttings from the Wente vineyard then spread to a number of other wineries before eventually being certified by the Foundation Plant Materials Service of the University of California, Davis. Clones taken from the certified vines are known as \\"Wente\\" or \\"heat-treated Wente,\\" and clones taken from vines before certification are known as \\"Old Wente.\\" Estate Wente Vineyards also offers a golf course, tasting rooms, a catering service, and a gourmet restaurant all nestled in the heart of the vineyards. During the summer, they host Concerts in the Vineyard, featuring performing artists from classics like The Doobie Brothers and Frankie Valli, to comedians like George Carlin and jazz artists such as Diana Krall, as well as current pop artists like The Band Perry. The catering service also provides food for these concerts for people to eat as they watch the performance.

In it, two players build armies led by powerful leaders called Guardians. Unlike many CCGs, there is a 4x3 \\"map\\" where armies maneuver; each player has strongholds on their \\"row\\", and the middle two rows are disputed. There are three potential victory conditions: a player can either defeat the enemy Guardian, conquer all 6 \\"disputed territories\\" in the middle two rows, or exhaust their opponent by depleting their armies (\\"shields\\").

The area gets its name from the defensive fort, Fort George, built by the British East India Company around Bombay Castle. The area extends from the docks in the east, to Azad Maidan in the west; Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus in the north to Kala Ghoda in the south. This area is the heart of the financial area of the city. Many British era structures are located here. History Map of Bombay Fort, 1771 The Fort area was declared protected under regulations of the Maharashtra Government Urban Development Department. An advisory committee now oversees the development, repairs and renovations of structures in the precinct. In 1882, Bomanjee Hormarjee Wadia Clock Tower was erected using public funds as a token of appreciation for Bomanjee Hormarjee, a Parsi philanthropist who made contributions towards improving education in Bombay. The Fort neighbourhood of Mumbai was the first part to be developed by the British. Then, over the years it stood as a reminder of India‚Äôs rich colonial history, and today it is sort of a jewel in the crown of the city‚Äôs cultural scene. Source: TOI Tourist Attraction The Fort area is a one-stop to all things cultural, artistic, shopping and more. The Fort area sidewalk is a paradise for anyone who likes to explore. If you are looking for books, clothes, cameras, musical instruments, and other such interesting things, then the sidewalk is where you are going to find them all.

Buford, who lived in the UK at the time, became interested in crowd hooliganism when, on his way home from Cardiff in 1982 he boarded a train that was commandeered by supporters coming from a football match. He spent the next eight years going to football matches, befriending supporters, and witnessing riots, resulting in this book. Experiences Buford is in several riots, notably in Turin and at the 1990 World Cup in Sardinia. He attends many games in the UK, spending time mostly with a group of Manchester United fans who refer to themselves as the Inter- City Jibbers. He goes to several National Front (NF) gatherings, as he regards the NF supporters as having a number of traits in common with football hooligans, one of which turns violent. He is beaten up by the Italian police, when caught with the rioting English supporters in Sardinia. He relates both first-hand and second-hand reports of hooligan violence, ranging from beatings to stabbings to a supporter biting out the eye of a police officer. Thesis Buford does not offer a conclusive explanation for why he thinks that this violence occurs. However, he does write, > I was surprised by what I found; moreover, because I came away with a > knowledge that I had not possessed before, I was also grateful, and > surprised by that as well. I had not expected the violence to be so > pleasurable....This is, if you like, the answer to the hundred-dollar > question: why do young males riot every Saturday? They do it for the same > reason that another generation drank too much, or smoked dope, or took > hallucinogenic drugs, or behaved badly or rebelliously. Violence is their > antisocial kick, their mind-altering experience, an adrenaline-induced > euphoria that might be all the more powerful because it is generated by the > body itself, with, I was convinced, many of the same addictive qualities > that characterize synthetically-produced drugs. He also suggests that crowds cannot be incited to violence against their will, contrary to the belief that otherwise pacific crowds can be stirred to violence by a persuasive leader. Buford also argues that those in a crowd collectively make the decision whether or not to cross thresholds of violence. In 2008, Richard Danzig, former student of political guru Michael G. Kimber and a senior advisor to U.S. President Barack Obama, claimed that a lesson could be learned about terrorists by studying football hooligans. Referring to Among the Thugs, Danzig states that \\"one of the best books I‚Äôve read on terrorism in recent years is not about terrorism at all. [Buford] describes the most appalling examples of soccer violence by fans against fans. But he describes with relentless honesty how he finds sickening things attractive. He says violence lets the adrenaline flow; it‚Äôs like sex, you live in the moment.\\" See also * Crowd psychology * List of hooligan firms * Ochlocracy * Violence in sports References Category:1990 non-fiction books Category:Association football books Category:Football hooliganism in the United Kingdom Category:Secker & Warburg books ","title":"Among the Thugs"},{"id":"2542221","text":"Operation Lalang (, also referred to as Ops Lalang and taken to mean \\"Weeding Operation\\") is a major crackdown carried out beginning 27 October 1987 by the Royal Malaysian Police, ostensibly to prevent the occurrence of racial riots in Malaysia. The operation saw the arrest of 106 to 119 people ‚Äì NGO activists, opposition politicians, intellectuals, students, artists, scientists and others ‚Äì who were detained without trial under the Internal Security Act (ISA). It was the second largest ISA swoop in Malaysian history since the 13 May riots. It also involved the revoking of the publishing licenses of two dailies, The Star and the Sin Chew Jit Poh and two weeklies, The Sunday Star and Watan. The Malaysian government argued that racial tension had reached dangerous proportion in the country, forcing the government to arrest those responsible for stoking the tension. The notion that racial riots were imminent however is contested, and it is widely believed that the operation was designed to control the political opponents of the Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad through draconian measures. The event marked the beginning of a period of Mahathir's authoritarian rule.  Causes  A number of political developments and issues preceding the operation had caused mounting political and racial tensions in the country. According to the Malaysian government's White paper explaining the arrests, various groups had exploited the government's \\"liberal\\" and \\"tolerant\\" attitude and played up \\"sensitive issues\\", thereby creating racial tension in the country. This racial tension, the government claimed, forced the government to act \\"swiftly and firmly\\" to contain the situation. =Background issues= The crackdown happened against a backdrop in late 1986 and 1987 of a split within UMNO into two opposing groups, commonly referred to as Team A led by Mahathir, and Team B led by Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah and Musa Hitam. Mahathir was challenged for the leadership and narrowly won, but faced a subsequent legal challenge on his win. There were also attacks by the government on several non-governmental organizations (NGO) which were critical of various government policies. Mahathir called these \\"intellectual elites\\" as \\"tools of foreign powers\\" and saboteurs of democracy. In addition, a number of race and religion-related issues had arisen which had a cumulative effect in raising ethnic tension. These included the switch to Malay language as a medium of instruction for optional courses in the departments of Chinese and Tamil studies at the University of Malaya, the use of Chinese characters in certain signboards, the questioning by the deputy president of Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) Lee Kim Sai over the use of the term pendatang (immigrants) that was seen as challenging Malay's bumiputra status, as well as rumours of forced conversion to or from Islam. = Vernacular Chinese school personnel controversy = The immediate cause, however, was the Ministry of Education's decision to appoint some 100 senior assistants and supervisors to Chinese-medium primary schools. Concerns were raised by Chinese politicians and organizations that those appointed were Chinese who were not Chinese-educated, implying that students and parents might be forced to use English or Malay to communicate with the school personnel. Chinese educationalist groups contended that the move would limit the usage of Chinese in these schools. On 11 October 1987, a 2,000-strong gathering was held by the United Chinese School Committees Association of Malaysia (UCSCAM, the association of Chinese school teachers and trustees, also known as Dong Jiao Zong) at the Hainanese Association Building beside the Thean Hou Temple in Kuala Lumpur. It was joined by prominent politicians from Chinese-based parties such as MCA's Deputy President and Labour Minister Lee Kim Sai, the leader of Democratic Action Party (DAP) Lim Kit Siang, as well as representatives from GERAKAN and other parties. The meeting resolved to call a three-day boycott in Chinese schools if the government did not settle the appointments issue. The boycott was called off at the eleventh hour to allow time for the government to resolve the issue, nevertheless 57 schools went ahead with the strike on 15 October, either because they did not receive the notice of postponement, or they disagreed with the decision. = Response by UMNO Youth = Even though the boycott was officially postponed, the stage was set for a response from the Malays led by UMNO Youth. A mass rally of 10,000 was held at the TPCA Stadium on Jalan Raja Muda in Kampung Baru, Kuala Lumpur on 17 October. UMNO politicians condemned MCA leaders (both UMNO and MCA are component parties of the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition) for their collusion with the Dong Jiao Zong and the opposition DAP. The UMNO protesters called for the resignations of MCA's Lee Kim Sai that mirrored the call for the resignation of UMNO Education Minister Anwar Ibrahim by the Chinese protesters. Najib Tun Razak, then chairman of the UMNO Youth wing, led the Malay rally in Kampung Baru, Kuala Lumpur. During the rally, Najib was alleged to have threatened to soak a keris in Chinese blood, evoking fear of 13 May repeating within the Chinese community. Many Chinese businesses around the city was closed for a few days for fear of any potential attacks from the Malay ultra-nationalists. To make matters worse, a tinder box situation was created by an unrelated event on 18 October ‚Äì the rampage of a Malay soldier who killed a Malay and injuring two other persons with an M16 rifle in the Chow Kit area, which straddles two large Chinese and Malay communities. = Proposed UMNO rally = While the Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir was away abroad, Sanusi Junid, the UMNO party secretary-general, and other UMNO leaders called for the holding of a mammoth rally in Kuala Lumpur on 1 November to celebrate its 41st Anniversary. The rally was originally to be held in Johor Bahru but later changed to Kuala Lumpur, where UMNO leaders claimed would see the attendance of half a million members. The rally was cancelled after the Prime Minister returned and Operation Lalang was launched. Launch of Operation Lalang On 27 October 1987, Dr Mahathir together with the police launched an operation he said was necessary to defuse racial tension that had reached \\"dangerous proportions\\". He said that the country was facing an economic recession and high unemployment, and could not afford racial riots. The operation was codenamed lalang after a type of weed. According to Mahathir the decision for the operation was taken by the police, and that he, as the Minister of Home Affairs, had to go along with it. The Inspector General of Police Tan Sri Mohammed Hanif Omar said the police operation was for the sake of national security, and had nothing to do with politics. The proposed UMNO rally was given as one of the reasons by the Inspector General of Police for the 27 October crackdown under the Internal Security Act. It was argued that had the rally been held, it could have sparked off racial riots given the likely incendiary nature of the speeches of UMNO politicians. It has also been argued that the Prime Minister had to have a quid pro quo for cancelling the UMNO rally, therefore opposition leaders and civil libertarians were arrested in order to placate the disappointed would-be rally participants. Effects The immediate effect of the operation was the arrest of a number of prominent political leaders, social activists and others, for incitement of racial sentiments and for showing Marxist tendencies. The publication licences of three newspapers were revoked. Mahathir also announced a nationwide ban on any gathering or rally, including those previously approved. Later in December 1987, Dr Mahathir introduced two pieces of legislation to impose additional restrictions on publications and grant police greater powers to curb public gatherings. = Arrests= The Prime Minister gave the approval for the arrest of 106 people, later increased to 119, under the Internal Security Act. The arrests were staggered ‚Äì 19 people were detained on 27 October 1987, rising to 54 10pm the next day, and later the night, the tally grew to 63. By 20 November 1987, 106 had been arrested. Among the more prominent detainees were opposition leader and DAP Secretary-General Lim Kit Siang, DAP Deputy chairman Karpal Singh, MCA Vice-President and Perak Chief Chan Kit Chee, PAS Youth Chief Halim Arshat, UMNO MP for Pasir Mas Ibrahim Ali, and UMNO Youth Education chairman Mohamed Fahmi Ibrahim. Other prominent non-political detainees included Dong Jiao Zong (Chinese Education Associations) Chairman Lim Fong Seng, Publicity Chief of the Civil Rights Committee Kua Kia Soong, and WAO member Irene Xavier. The MCA deputy president Lee Kim Sai had apparently been warned beforehand and he left for Australia for a few months the day the arrests began. Of the politicians arrested, three were UMNO members, eight MCA, five Gerakan, fifteen PAS, sixteen DAP, and two PSRM. The three UMNO members arrested were closely associated with Mahathir's rivals called Team B, even though the UMNO's rallies were supported and initiated by Mahathir's allies (a further UMNO member who was a Mahathir's ally was said to have been detained for an unrelated reason). The UMNO, MCA and Gerakan detainees were released within two months, while most of those from the opposition parties and NGOs were detained much longer. The majority of the detainees had no connection with the events in Kuala Lumpur, for example, several Baptist Church members in Petaling Jaya were arrested for allegedly converting seven Malays, and at least nine PAS members were arrested for making claims about Christians converting Malays. Many of those detained were also not involved in creating racial tensions; for example, Chandra Muzaffar, chairman of Aliran whose philosophy involves intercommunal cooperation, and members of Insan, a social reformist group that campaigned against exploitation of the poor, and Environment Protection Society of Malaysia, were also arrested. A categorisation of the initially named detainees, numbering 97, gives the following breakdown: political parties: 37; social movements: 23; individuals: 37. Although most of the detainees were released either conditionally or unconditionally, 49 were served with a two-year detention order, and the last one was freed in April 1989. The detainees were first interrogated and kept at various police stations, those retained longer were sent to the usual place used for ISA detainees, at Kamunting Detention Center. Those who were detained longer included Lim Kit Siang, Karpal Singh plus five other party colleagues, a number of PAS members including Mohamad Sabu, and many social activists such as Tuang Pik King and Mohd Nasir Hashim. Some of the prisoners detained during Operation Lalang were alleged to have been tortured during their captivity. = Curtailment of press freedom = In the afternoon the day following the first arrests, the Home Ministry withdrew the licences of the English language newspapers The Star and Sunday Star, the Chinese language Sin Chew Jit Poh, and the Malay language Watan. The Star was claimed to have being targeted as it had served as an outlet for alternative views from non-established groups as well as dissident opinions from Mahathir's rival Team B, and it and the other two were also the only domestic newspapers that regularly covered the activities of public interest groups. Tunku Abdul Rahman, who wrote a column for The Star, said that \\"we are on the road to dictatorship\\", a comment which wasn't reported by the other newspapers. The Star, Sin Chew Jit Poh and Watan regained their licences on 22 March 1988 and soon resumed publication, however Watan never fully recovered from it and closed its doors permanently in 1996. In the aftermath of the crackdown on newspapers and a subsequent legislation on press activity, editorials of newspaper started to self-censor and became cautious about the stories they ran. According to journalists working during that period, newspapers were also advised by the Home Ministry to avoid certain issues, and editors were called for briefings with various ministries on the way a subject should be covered. The Star itself, after its return, never regained its previous 'liberal flavour'. The Printing Presses and Publications Act was amended to make printers and publishers re-apply their licences annually, and established an ouster clause preventing any revocation of license by the Home Affairs Minister from being called into question by the courts.Yatim, Rais (1995). Freedom Under Executive Power in Malaysia: A Study of Executive Supremacy, p. 308. Endowment Publications. . A new criminal offence of \\"maliciously publishing false news\\" which carries a three-year jail sentence and/or fines was also added. The Act was subsequently amended in 2012 to remove the requirement for annual licence application and the government's 'absolute discretion' over permits, and reinstated judicial overview. =Amendments to the Police Act= Amendments were also made to the Police Act to restrict right to free assembly by making a police permit mandatory for public gatherings. It required that any assembly of more than five people in a public area to obtain a police permit 14 days before the assembly. The law also prohibited public rallies for electoral campaigns, and only allowed ceramah (public lecture) by the political parties which would also require a permit. It made it practically impossible to hold any political meeting, including a party's annual general meeting, without a police permit. A conviction could mean a fine of RM10,000 and a jail term of one year. According to Dr Mahathir, the amendments to the Police Act and the Printing Presses and Publications Act were aimed at individuals and groups who abused the government's liberal attitudes: \\"Being liberal to them is like offering a flower to a monkey. The monkey would rather tear the flower apart than appreciate its beauty\\". Significance and assessment Operation Lalang is a major event in Mahathir's administration that had a strong impact on civil liberties in Malaysia, and it was seen as an excuse by the Mahathir government to tighten the executive hold by restricting fundamental liberties. To the opposition parties, Operation Lalang came to symbolise 'injustice' and government 'oppression'. The first Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tunku Abdul Rahman, commenting on Operation Lalang, said that: \\"We are on the road to dictatorship. I cannot see any other way... This is no democracy.\\" The operation is seen as the beginning of Mahathir's authoritarian rule which continued with the sacking of Supreme Court judges in the 1988 Malaysian constitutional crisis the following year. Although Operation Lalang was ostensibly undertaken for reason of national security, it is also widely seen by commentators as a show of force by Mahathir against his political challengers. The operation created considerable fear inside and outside UMNO. Lim Kit Siang, one of the detainees, similarly argued that the ISA arrests were more directed against UMNO rather than the racial crisis, and that Mahathir allowed the situation to escalate so he could then crack down and consolidate his position against his internal rivals. Dr Mahathir later expressed regret in his memoir about the severity of Operation Lalang, but suggested that it was the result of a recommendation of strong action by the police. He said that the government response had probably been \\"excessive and disproportionate\\", and that the operation was a \\"permanent blot on my time in office\\" and \\"a black mark in the administrative history of Malaysia\\". But, he added, \\"I had to suppress my own personal doubts and feelings. I had to recognize the role and expertise of the police and defer to their exercising their appointed role in our system of government.\\"  Notable detainees   See also  * 2014 Malaysian sedition dragnet * Operation Coldstore * Operation Spectrum  References  Category:1987 in Malaysia Category:History of Malaysia since Independence Category:Human rights abuses in Malaysia Category:Political repression in Malaysia Category:Protests in Malaysia ","title":"Operation Lalang"},{"id":"2542229","text":"Shaykh Ibrahim Niasse IbrƒÅhƒ´m Niasse (1900‚Äì1975)‚Äîor , , Shaykh al-'IslƒÅm al- ·∏§ƒÅjj IbrƒÅhƒ´m ibn al-·∏§ƒÅjj  øAbd AllƒÅh at-TijƒÅnƒ´ al-Kawlakhƒ´ ‚Äîwas a senegalese major leader (wolof) of the TijƒÅnƒ´ Sufi order of Islam in West Africa.

It was directed by Robby Benson and Barnet Kellman. The series premiered on ABC on October 2, 2001, and the final episode aired on October 31 of that year. It was cancelled in November 2001 after five of the ten scheduled episodes aired. Overview The show revolves around fictitious motivational speaker Bob Patterson, \\"America's #3 Self Help Guru\\", who is popular with millions of people across America, thanks to his books I Know More Than You, I Still Know More Than You and the To the Top! franchise. Friction between his job and family occurs due in part to Bob's self-absorbed but insecure nature and complete lack of self-awareness, ironic qualities for someone whose job is supposed to be selflessly motivating others to improve their lives. After the show's cancellation, Alexander used the concept behind Patterson to create a similar fictional character named Donny Clay, \\"America's #4 Self Help Guru.\\" Alexander has toured the United States in character as Clay. =Catchphrases= The character of Bob Patterson had a series of catchphrases: *\\"No is only yes to a different question.\\" *\\"The only thing between you and your goals is you.......and your goals.\\" *\\"You are the U in the Universe.\\" *\\"To the top!\\" Cast *Jason Alexander as Bob Patterson *Robert Klein as Landau *Phil Buckman as Vic *Jennifer Aspen as Janet Patterson *Chandra Wilson as Claudia *James Guidice as Jeffrey Patterson Episodes Reception =Critical= The series received poor reviews.

Various steps can be taken by the writer of the check to reduce the possibility of falling victim to check washing. These include mailing checks by placing them in secured mailboxes, using secure ink dispensed from a gel, rollerball, or fountain pen, filling in all lines on the check, and careful scrutiny of bank statements. The actual process of washing a check is relatively simple and can be accomplished with basic solvents. The actual solvent is largely irrelevant ‚Äî more importantly, the polarity of the solvent must match the polarity of the dye in the ink. For example, an ink that is mostly made of a polar dye would require a polar solvent (e.g. acetone or isopropanol). Both nail polish remover (acetone) and rubbing alcohol (isopropanol) are able to pull most common inks away from paper in minutes.

It is located just above the tragus on the ridge between the inner and outer conch with the piercing passing from the underside to the top of this ridge, differing from many ear piercings that essentially span between a \\"front\\" and \\"back\\" surface. Erik Dakota, a well known professional piercer and the individual responsible for originating and popularizing the rook piercing, is said to have named this modification after a shortened version of his first name. The piercing was first named in issue #4 of the magazine Body Play and Modern Primitives Quarterly (published by Fakir Musafar) around 1992 alongside the first printed reference to the industrial piercing, then termed \\"industrial ear project\\".  Procedure  The procedure is done similarly to other piercings of the cartilage of the ear. Clamps may be used but it is usually done freehand. Once the area is cleaned, the piercer and the client will agree on placement, although because of its location it can be difficult to see exactly where the entrance and exit holes will be. Generally, the piercer will advise the client on the best location. The entrance and exit holes are marked, and a hollow needle is pushed through. Many professional piercers will use either a 14g or 16g needle by default, although it is possible to use even larger gauges. The jewelry is then inserted, and the piercing complete. Pain is very subjective and it is difficult to ascertain how much the initial piercing will hurt to a given person. Some people experience pain comparable to that of an average cartilage piercing to the helix or tragus, and others have described it as one of the most painful piercings they've ever received, either in the ear or their whole body. However, pain thresholds differ between individuals, so what may be painful to one person may be a slight tickle to someone else.  Healing and aftercare  Fresh rook piercing (top) with 16g Curved Barbell The rook piercing is also cared for much like any other ear cartilage piercing. Salt soaks (warm water (optimally sterilized by boiling) mixed with a small amount of sea salt) are recommended twice a day for the first month or two. These soaks will soften any dried lymph, clean the piercing as well as the jewellery, partially sterilize the area due to the salt, and alleviate swelling and soreness. The warm water also encourages blood flow to the area aiding in the healing process. Washing the area once a day gently with liquid soap and warm water will decrease the chances of infection. Ideally, an antimicrobial soap should be used, but for most people a fragrance-free and dye-free liquid antibacterial soap will suffice. One must be careful not to over-wash the area as this can lead to drying the area out. Alcohol and peroxide should also not be used for the same reason. Antibacterial and antimicrobial ointments (such as Neosporin) should never be used as they seal off the wound from receiving any air. One should avoid touching the area as much as possible, and if necessary, wash their hands beforehand. Care should be taken when changing shirts so that the jewellery isn't tugged as well as when using a telephone as the receiver may spread germs to the wound and the pressure can delay healing. Otherwise, for most people, the area is tucked into the ear more so than most other cartilage piercings and is less susceptible to incidental bumps and knocks. Soreness is likely to persist for the first couple of months with the worst occurring during the first week or two. Jewellery should not be changed until at least eight weeks after the procedure. Primary healing will usually conclude within six months with full, secondary healing of the fistula complete in 12 to 18 months. Much of the cartilage in the ear receives comparatively little blood flow accounting for the increased healing time and persistent soreness.  Jewelry  Any type of body modification jewelry can be worn in the piercing with the most common being CBRs (captive bead ring) and curved barbells. Many piercers recommend that a curved barbell is worn initially. The curved barbell has less curvature than a CBR, thus reducing strain on the healing fistula and leading to a healthier piercing and shorter healing times. People often choose relatively small diameter rings and shorter barbells owing to the confined space of the piercing. Oftentimes individuals will need assistance in removing and especially inserting jewelry due to the small area and difficulty in seeing and reaching the piercing coupled with the complexity of screwing on small parts without stripping the jewelry and/or securing the ball in a CBR.  Complications  Generally, the rook piercing presents the same set of complications and risks as other cartilage piercings in the ear, although its concealed nature makes it less prone to accidental snags than other piercings. However, not everyone has suitable anatomy for a viable, long-term rook piercing. Someone with a poorly defined ridge in this area is encouraged not to have this procedure done. An experienced piercer will be able to accurately assess whether or not the client's ear is suited for a rook piercing and will likely refuse to perform the modification on someone with an inadequate ridge. Some individuals have complained about persistent soreness in the area spanning a year or more, migration, and in some cases even rejection. While some of these issues can arise from improper aftercare and careless handling, many times they are the result of improper placement or poorly suited anatomy. Depending on the size and thickness of one's antihelix in this area, the increased curvature of a CBR (as opposed to a curved barbell) can put undue strain on the healing fistula which can prolong soreness and promote migration. Rejection will only occur in the most extreme of circumstances, usually because of poor placement (too shallow or oddly angled hole) or extreme trauma inflicted on the piercing especially during healing. In general, a person with decent health and proper hygiene is unlikely to experience any complications or pain outside of the normal healing process. It is also important to refrain from attempting to stretch this area, at least without talking to an experienced piercer beforehand and following their advice. Cartilage normally will not stretch significantly although smaller gauge stretchings may be possible for some people.

Higginson) is an English film and television actress. She is best known for her roles in 1970s British horror films and sex comedies. Career Hayden was born in Stanmore, Middlesex. She trained with the Aida Foster stage school in dancing, singing and stage acting before making her film debut at the age of 15 in the controversial Baby Love (1968), playing a schoolgirl who seduces her adoptive family. She next featured in two horror films; playing Alice Hargood in Hammer's Taste the Blood of Dracula, (1970),\\"Taste The Blood Of Dracula 1970\\" BritishHorrorFilms.co.uk (Retrieved: 16 February 2010) followed by a memorable performance as the demonically possessed Angel Blake in The Blood on Satan's Claw (1970), made by Tigon.\\"Blood On Satan's Claw 1970\\" BritishHorrorFilms.co.uk (Retrieved: 16 February 2010) In 1972, she played a pregnant teenage hitchhiker in Something to Hide, driving Peter Finch to murder and madness. She is the sister of the company actress Jane Hayden (b. 1957), who played a number of roles on films and TV in the 1970s. Hayden appeared opposite Robin Askwith, her then-boyfriend, in the popular sex comedies Confessions of a Window Cleaner (1974), Confessions from a Holiday Camp (1977) and, with Fiona Richmond, in Let's Get Laid (1978); as well as the obscure cult film Queen Kong (1976). She also shared the stage with Askwith, in Richard Harris and Leslie Darbon's farce Who Goes Bare. Hayden and Richmond had previously appeared together in the thriller Expos√© (1976), which was known as Trauma in the USA and House on Straw Hill in Australia, and banned in the UK as a video nasty. In a documentary on the DVD of The Blood on Satan's Claw, Hayden says that Expos√© is the only movie she regrets making and was not the film she had made originally. Following a brief role in The Boys from Brazil (1978), Hayden concentrated on stage and television work. In 1980 she appeared in the ITV series The Professionals as 'Gerda' in the episode 'Black Out' and as 'Annie,' Terry McCann's girlfriend in the Christmas special Minder on the Orient Express, 1985. She also took a role in the thriller Underground at Toronto's Royal Alexandra Theatre and London's Prince of Wales Theatre in 1983, as well as a 1997 episode of The Bill. Now semi-retired, she featured as Mrs Brown in Martin Kemp's 2010 remake of Expos√©, with Jane March playing Linda‚ÄîHayden's role in the 1976 original.

She was awarded the USSR State Prize (1977) and the Order of Merit for the Fatherland (twice, 2007, 2001).  Biography  Alla Demidova was born on 29 September 1936 in Zamoskvorechye, Moscow, and spent her early years at the Osipenko (now Sadovnicheskaya) Street. Her father Sergey Alekseyevich Demidov, an heir to the Russian industrialists' family, was jailed in 1932 in the course of the Great Purge, but soon got acquitted. In 1941 he joined the Red Army as a volunteer and was killed in action 1944, near Warsaw. Alla's mother, Aleksandra Dmitriyevna Demidova (n√©e Kharchenko) was working at the Economy department of the Moscow University (later at its Cybernetics and economic programming section).Rasskazova, Tatyana. Alla With a Doggie. www.demidova.ru. Mother and daughter spent the World War II years in Vladimir, to the East of Moscow. \\"I received too little love from the people around me in those early years to remember them fondly,\\" Demidova later confessed.Demidova, A.S. One's Memory Running Line Eksmo-Press. 2003. She debuted as an actress on her school's amateur stage, enjoying her first taste of success. = Career = While still at school, Demidova joined the well-known Moscow actress Tatyana Shchekin- Krotova's courses to study drama. After the graduation she took the examinations at the Boris Shchukin Theatre Institute but failed due to flawed diction and enrolled in the Moscow University's Economy faculty. In 1959, after the graduation, she started teaching political economy at the University's Philosophy faculty.. Part. 1. Before that, as a third year student, she joined the university Students' Theater, led by first Igor Lipsky, then Rolan Bykov. It was under the latter's guidance that in 1958 Demidova made her stage debut as Lida Petrusova in Such Kind of Love (Takaya lyubov), an adaptation of Pavel Kohout's play. Having joined the Shchukin School on the second attempt, Demidova started studying at the class of actress Anna Orochko, who experimented with her young prot√©g√©, and even suggested once that she should play Hamlet, something the actress would return to some forty years later. While still studying at the Shchukun Institute, Demidova performed in Vakhtangov Theatre's production of Death of Gods (Gibel bogov), in Princess Turandot and in The Cookie (\\"Stryapukha\\"). It was then that she was noticed by the French theatre specialist Jean Vilar who, after seeing the girl fencing in a gym, invited her to join the Theatre National Populaire, an offer that she had to decline.Novikova, L. Alla Demidova: \\"I‚Äôve been befriended by real geniuses\\" ‚Äì Kultura (newspaper, Russia), 2006. On the Shchukin stage she performed the leading role in Aleksander Afinogenov's Distant Things (Dalyokoye), played Mrs. Moon in The Scandalous Affair of Mr. Kettle and Mrs. Moon (after John Priestley's play of the same name) and Madame Frisette in Frisette by Eugene Marin Labiche. In 1957 Demidova debuted on screen in the director Zakhar Agranenko's Leningrad Symphony. That was followed by Nine Years of One Year (director Mikhail Romm, 1961), What's a Relativity Theory? (Semyon Raitburg, 1963) and Komask (1965), the films she would later refer to as \\"my reconnaissance raid.\\"Fedorovsky, D. Alla Demidova: 'Why do I want to play Hamlet'. Yunost, August 1968, No.8 issue In 1964 Demidova graduated from the Shchukin Institute, having presented as her diploma work the role of Mrs. Young in Yuri Lyubimov's adaptation of Bertholt Brecht's The Good Person of Szechwan. \\"Her role was peripheral but that didn't matter. The effect of her physical presence was enormous,\\" the actor Boris Khmelnitsky later remembered. The young actress unsuccessfully tried to return to the Vaktangov's, spent several months at the Mayakovsky Theatre again without any role to cling to, and in the end of 1964 joined Taganka (which opened officially in April that year) to be employed there regularly, but mostly in unsubstantial roles. The reason for Lyubimov's mistrust might have been the fact that in her first leading role here, that of Vera in A Hero of Our Time, Demidova, admittedly, 'failed miserably'. Several years of hard work in mass scenes and pantomimes followed. This master-and-servant type of relationship between the theater director and his actress continued for decades. 1966 ‚Äì 1979 The leading role in Igor Talankin's Daylight Stars (Dnevnye zvyozdy, 1966), that of Olga Berggolts, proved to be the starting point of Demidova's film career. \\"The part was very close to my heart and artistically intriguing too. I had to play not just an ordinary woman, but a poet, which involved exploring the process of giving birth to poetry, as well as discovering this fine line between my heroine's every day tribulations and the film's sublime philosophical essence,\\" she explained, speaking to the Yunost magazine in 1968. This success did little to dispel Demidova's intrinsic mistrust in the cinema as an art form. \\"What a pity such a full- bloodied role had been given to me in film, not in theater,\\" she complained in the same interview. 1968 was the year of Demidova's major breakthrough when six of her films came out. Some of her roles (like that in Vladimir Basov's War-time thriller The Shield and the Sword) Demidova later dismissed as unworthy of attention, describing others (like that of a comissar in Two Comrades Were Serving) as \\"curious\\". More significant to her was the character of the SR party activist Maria Spiridonova in The 6th of July (1968), a rebel the actress was in many ways identifying herself with. \\"I've never been a dissident, I've always shied politics, may be because my grandmother was staroobryadka. Still for some reason 1917 always seemed to me a catastrophe and never in my life have I dabbled in politics ‚Äì either in reality, or in films. Spiridonova, of course, was an exception, but then again, she was Lenin's opponent,\\" Demidova said in a 2006 interview. Her Liza Protasova in The Living Corpse (1968) was praised by critics, even if Vladimir Vengerov's film itself received mixed reviews. In 1969 she appeared in Igor Talankin's Tchaikovsky as Yulia von Mekk. In 1968 Demidova started to get major roles in Taganka, Elmyra in Moli√®re's Tartuffe being the first in the line. Much lauded was Demidova's Pani Bozhentska in the adaptation of Jerzy Stawinski's The Rush Hour, the role she soon came to detest, though. \\"Outstanding\\" was how her Gertrude in Hamlet (with Vladimir Vysotskyin the leading role) was described. \\"In the play which was both phantasmagoric and strikingly real, Demidova artfully portrayed a woman, misguided rather than vile,\\" wrote Raisa Benyash. Critics admired the actresses' willingness to approach the new dimensions in classics, bringing new light and shade to the well known characters of Russian theater's past. Still, Demidova felt underrated and ignored at Taganka and defined herself as an Efros's kind of actress. This was later corroborated by her colleagues. \\"She definitely wasn't what one may call a director's favourite, her life in Taganka was difficult. She managed to retain her individuality and refine her distinctive style only by using all of her inner strength, intelligence and talent,\\" wrote fellow actor and author Veniamin Smekhov. After the success of Hamlet, Demidova started to receive numerous offers, but felt disappointed with the way directors tried to exploit the most obvious aspects of her stage persona. Still, lauded were her performances as Arkadina in Yuli Karasik's 1970 movie Seagull (based on Anton Chekhov's play The Seagull), where the actress, making her character going through unexpected metamorphoses, totally outplayed her colleagues, as well as Lesia Ukrainka in I'm Going to You (Idu k tebe, 1971, directed by Nikolai Mashchenko). Her Anne Stanton (in All The King's Men, 1971) impressed Oleg Efremov, who reportedly remarked: \\"Of all our actresses, Demidova is the one who's got the liveliest eyes\\". Demidova played Lizaveta Pavlovna in Andrey Tarkovsky's The Mirror (1974), the Magic Woman in Irina Povolotskaya's Scarlet Flower (Alenky tsvetochek, 1977), a fairytale which she \\"single-handedly transformed into a fable,\\" according to critic A.Smolyakov, and the Duchess of Marlborough in Yuli Karasik's The Glass of Water (1979), alongside Kirill Lavrov's Lord Bolingbroke. As Yuri Lyubimov, invited to direct at Milan's La Scala, left Taganka, Anatoly Efros entered in. He decided to produce The Cherry Orchard, aiming from the start to come up with something quite different from the old- fashioned textbook Moscow Art Theater version of the Chekhov's classic. Demidova as a 'modernist' Ranevskaya, managed to aesthetically re-vamp this character, merging tragedy and eccentricity, sentimentality and irony. Critics were divided in their assessment of Efros' concept and the quality of the production in general, but even detractors had to agree that what saved the experiment from flopping were Demidova and Vladimir Vysotsky as Lopatin. \\"Initially the [Chekhov's] heroine for me was totally alien. As time went by, I was beginning to see myself as 'me-as-Ranevskaya' more and more,\\" Demidova remarked years later. One of the Efros interpretation's harshest critics was Lyubimov who described Demidova's performance as \\"mannered\\" and \\"grotesque.\\" Tellingly, several years later he asked Demidova to reproduce what he called \\"the Ranevskaya algorithm\\" in the final act of Chekhov's Three Sisters (1981) where her Masha, initially ironic and aloof, demonstrated the disturbing outburst of emotions in the play's final stages. Among Demidova's other roles in Taganka of the time were Raskolnikov's mother in Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment (1979) and Marina Mnishek in Pushkin's Boris Godunov (1982), the latter banned by the Ministry of Culture's special decree (and premiered on 12 June 1988). = Demidova and Vysotsky = In the late 1970s Demidova and Vysotsky, both irritated by Lyubimov's artistic dictatorship, gravitated into a tandem (where, as one critic put it, \\"ice and fire clashed\\") to experiment with ideas of their own. \\"We both were beginning to realize that the time of massive, colourful theatrical shows has come to an end, and the new era of private, chamber theater was approaching,\\" Demidova recalled. Having in mind the Vysotsky and Demidova's project, Vitaly Vulf translated into Russian Tennessee Williams' Out Cry, a play for two characters, brother and sister. Lyubimov saw it as an \\"ego act\\" (seeing as the original had been written for a couple of Broadway stars) and the fellow Taganka actors apparently took their boss's side. \\"As the first Act was ready, we advertised it locally, inviting everybody to come and see. Only two people showed up: [stage designer] David Borovsky and his friend. What would you expect: it's... theatre!\\" Demidova later bitterly remarked. The experiment was shelved, along with another project, their own version of Jean Racine's Phaedra. Months later Vysotsky died. \\"It was only after he was gone that I suddenly realized how much he'd meant to me as a partner... He was an exceptional actor, especially in his last years, the one who reigned the audience by literally magnetizing the air around him,\\" she later remembered.  1980s  In the early 1980s Demidova started to stage her own recital shows, each produced as a miniature theatrical play. Some, shown by the Soviet TV, became popular. In Pushkin's The Queen of Spades (directed by Igor Maslennikov, 1982) she not just recited the poem but acted out its characters, \\"casting a shade of Silver Age over the whole of this three cards' story.\\" Demidova's collaboration with Anatoly Vasilyev in the film Stone Guest and Other Poems involved some role-juggling too. On stage she recited Anna Akhmatova (Requiem, Poem Without a Hero), Pushkin, Ivan Bunin, assorted Silver Age poets. Her own act's stage director, Demidova was now viewed as a star in a genre of her own. As a major influence she cited Giorgio Strehler, then a Theatre of Nations director, who in May 1987 invited Efros with two of his shows (At the Bottom and Cherry Orchard) to Milan. \\"It was Strehler who shaped my whole vision of the way those solo performances should be staged and designed... An easel, a candle, some music, synchronized translation ‚Äì those were the elements of his original stage concept which I've made my own,\\" Demidova remembered. \\"Just music and me, totally alienated from the audience: that was the idea that since then remained unchanged,\\" she said in a 2010 interview. It was in her solo stage projects that Demidova managed finally to fulfil what's been left of her potential that Lyubimov and Efros, two renown Russian theater directors failed to notice and use, critic Tatyana Moskvina opined. After Lyubimov's departure to the West, Demidova gradually withdrew from Taganka. In 1986 Efros revived the Cherry Orchard production, casting Demidova in the leading role. It won the 1st Prize at BITEF, then had a successful run in Paris, in the wake of its director's death. With Lyubimov coming back, Demidova returned to Taganka where she performed as Marina Mnishek (Boris Godunov, 1988) and Donna Anna (Feast Amidst Plague, 1989). In 1988 Alla Demidova joined forces with theatre director Roman Viktyuk who staged Marina Tsvetayeva's Phaedra. \\"The result was intriguing, it just never fitted into the Taganka's repertoire. We were invited to festivals, toured a lot but were being accused by Lyubimov for allegedly exploiting 'his brand'. Grabbing the first opportunity, I just bought the whole production off: costumes, decorations and everything, never sure what to do with this purchase,\\" Demidova recalled. In the Modern History of the Soviet and Russian Cinema Phaedra was described as the best Soviet theatre production of the 1980s and arguably Viktyuk's most serious work. 1990s Demidova's performance as Electra in Sophocles' Electra which premiered in Athens, Greece, in 1992, happened to be her final one under Lyubimov. The production was short-lived, but the actress's performance garnered fine reviews. As the major conflict broke out in the theatre and Taganka split into two, Demidova supported Lyubimov. \\"I just refused to see how could a pupil betray their master,\\" she later explained. Once it became obvious that the confrontation started to seriously undermine the quality of Taganka's work, Demidova quit the theatre. In 1992 Demidova's own A Theater opened, with the production of Phaedra. In 1993 came out Quartet, a play by Heiner Mueller based on de Laclos' Dangerous Liaisons novel, produced by Demidova in collaboration with the Greek director Theodoros Terzopoulos. Quartet, which for the first time introduced the Russian audiences to the works of Mueller, was rated as one of the best premieres in Russian theatre that year by A.Smolyakov. The A Theater's next work (again with Terzopoulos), Mueller's version of Medea, premiered on 29 April 1996; Russian critics saw it as an attempt to create the new style of contemporary tragedy by reviving the \\"arch-myth, buried in human subconscious.\\" Working with Terzopoulos changed Demidova's perception of theater. \\"After Electra, Phaedra and Medea all things that went before them tasted insipid,\\" she confessed. In 2001 Hamlet the Master Class, the A Theatre and the Greek Attis theatres' joint production, came out. Premiered at the Moscow Theatrical Olympiad, it featured Demidova as Hamlet (her early tutor Anna Orochko's idea finally realised), as well as Gertrude and Ophelia. In the 1990s Demidova appeared in several films, playing Lebyadkina (The Obsessed, 1992), Miss Minchin (Little Princess, 1997) and Elizaveta Alekseevna (Unseen Traveller, 1998). For two years she was teaching at the Boris Shchukin Theatre Institute (refusing to be paid, \\"so as not to feel tied up by it\\") but left, disappointed by her young students' response. Now firmly under the impression that theatre in Russia, as well as abroad, was in crisis, Demidova quit the stage altogether.Dolin, Anton. Alla Demidova in The Tuner. www.demidova.ru.  2000 ‚Äì present  In 2000‚Äì2002 Demidova appeared on screen twice, first as Lora Lyons (in Remembering Sherlock Holmes, a Russian TV serial) then as mad Elsa (in Letters to Elsa, a film based on Vladimir Vysotsky's son Arkady's screenplay). In Boris Blank's Death of Tairov (2004) Demidova played Alisa Koonen. \\"Enchanted by the character, I longed for that role, but the film proved to be devoid of dramatic scenes, and the script was bizarre, to put it mildly. Nevertheless, I managed to achieve some things: visual and aural similarity, by reproducing her voice and plastics ‚Äì people who remembered her assured me as much,\\" she later commented. Yuri Lyubimov was supposed to be cast as Tairov, but fell ill, was hospitalized and Mikhail Kozakov came in, making a disappointing substitution, as far as Demidova was concerned. For the leading role in Kira Muratova's The Tuner (2005) Demidova received the Nika Award and the Golden Eagle Award for the Best Actress, having portrayed a kind of \\"modern day Ranevskaya,\\" as she put it, a pure and pathetic post-Chekhov character. After two more films ‚Äì Igor Maslennikov's Russian Money (after Alexander Ostrovsky) where she played Murzavetskaya, and Sergey Kostin's historical documentary Waiting for the Empress (about Maria Fyodorovna, both 2006, ‚Äì Demidova declared she's lost all interest in being filmed.

From 1973-1986 he served as associate professor of Theology and Philosophy at St. Peter's Seminary. In 1986 he was appointed auxiliary bishop of London and titular bishop of Carinola, Italy. In 1995 he was installed as the fifth bishop of Thunder Bay, Ontario, and on March 19, 1998 he was installed as the seventh bishop of Calgary. He was granted early retirement as Bishop of Calgary by Pope Francis on January 4, 2017, due to health concerns.

Henry's staunch positions have made him a polarizing figure in the Calgary community. His support has come from devout Catholics who agree with his traditional faith based views on contemporary issues such as gay marriage. His behavior and command of the Calgary diocese has come with controversy. Two recent examples were the banning schools and students from using casinos to fund-raise (the traditionally most significant source of extra revenue) and suggesting that school boards in the Calgary Catholic School District ban the distribution of the HPV vaccine. He is a noted critic of modern trends in government, whether these be the libertarian policies of the Alberta Progressive Conservatives (Provincial Government), or the tendency of certain Canadian federal politicians to overlook their Catholic identities at election time. Views =Same-sex marriage= On July 30, 2003, Henry commented on Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien's support for the legalization of same-sex marriage: \\"I pray for the Prime Minister because I think his eternal salvation is in jeopardy. He is making a morally grave error and he's not being accountable to God... He doesn't understand what it means to be a good Catholic.\\" =Abortion= After Joe Clark, former Tory leader and a Catholic, described himself as pro-choice, Henry described his comments as \\"scandalous\\". =HPV vaccine and promiscuity= Henry does not allow public health officials to vaccinate students in Catholic schools against human papillomavirus, or HPV. He believes that the HPV vaccine is a partial prophylaxis which is utilized instead of, rather than with, the development of self-discipline and virtue.

P. Ruck (born December 8, 1935, Bridgeport, Connecticut), is a professor in the Classical Studies department at Boston University. He received his B.A. at Yale University, his M.A. at the University of Michigan, and a Ph.D. at Harvard University. He lives in Hull, Massachusetts. Entheogen theory Carl Ruck is best known for his work along with other scholars in mythology and religion on the sacred role of entheogens, or psychoactive plants that induce an altered state of consciousness, as used in religious or shamanistic rituals. His focus has been on the use of entheogens in classical western culture, as well as their historical influence on modern western religions. He currently teaches a mythology class at Boston University that presents this theory in depth. The book The Road to Eleusis: Unveiling the Secret of the Mysteries, co-authored by Ruck with Albert Hofmann and R. Gordon Wasson, makes a case that the psycho-active ingredient in the secret kykeion potion used in the Eleusinian mysteries was most likely the ergotism causing fungus Claviceps purpurea. Furthermore the book introduced for the first time the term \\"entheogen\\" as an alternative for terms such as \\"psychedelic\\", \\"hallucinogen\\" and \\"drug\\" that can be misleading in certain contexts. The Apples of Apollo: Pagan and Christian Mysteries of the Eucharist (2001) explores the role that entheogens in general, and Amanita muscaria in particular, played in Greek and biblical mythology and later on in Renaissance painting, most notably in the Isenheim Altarpiece by Matthias Gr√ºnewald. In January 2003 Ruck came to public attention commenting on a book by the cannabis activist Chris Bennett. He was quoted in The Guardian,The Guardian The Guardian 6 Jan 2003 6 January 2003 \\"There can be little doubt about a role for cannabis in Judaic religion,\\" Carl Ruck, professor of classical mythology at Boston University said. Referring to the existence of cannabis in anointing oils used in ceremonies, he added: \\"Obviously the easy availability and long- established tradition of cannabis in early Judaism _ would inevitably have included it in the [Christian] mixtures.\\" and then wrote an article for The Sunday Times.‚ÄúWas There a Whiff of Cannabis about Jesus?‚Äù The Sunday Times, January 12, 2003 .

The series stars Milo O'Shea as Abner Bevis, a down-on-his-luck comic book artist whose life is turned upside down when his creation, Captain Justice (Jeff Lester), comes to life. Also appearing in the series were Caitlin Clarke and Robert Forster. Premise Abner Bevis (Milo O'Shea) is the creator of a comic-book superhero called Captain Justice. Lately Bevis is in a rut and repeating old storylines, and children have lost interest in the comic, so the comic's owners want to kill off the title. Even the characters in the book's fictional world of Pleasantville have started to notice that their lives are repeating themselves, and the lack of reader interest is causing characters to start fading. Captain Justice (Jeff Lester) decides to cross the Forbidden Zone into the real world, where he becomes a real human being with no superpowers. Also crossing over is Gumshoe (Robert Forster), the embodiment of generic private detectives, who's looking out for Justice. The Captain's attempts to fight real-world criminals renew interest in the comic, and the owners agree not to cancel it; also, Bevis is inspired to make it more contemporary. Adding to the stories is suspicious newspaper reporter Emma Greely (Caitlin Clarke), who keeps snooping around. Her troubled and precocious son Woody (Josh Blake) knows the truth about Captain Justice, but she doesn't.

It was supposed to be a joke\\", but when the producers became worried he might not be suitable as the lead, the role was recast with Jeff Lester. A pilot with Turner had been shot, and writer Ira Steven Behr suggested that key advertising-agency executives had seen the abandoned version of the pilot, which caused bad word-of-mouth for the show, ultimately dooming it.\\"TELEVISION; WHY 'ONCE A HERO' IS NO MORE\\", The New York Times.

Texas Instruments TMS320 is a blanket name for a series of digital signal processors (DSPs) from Texas Instruments. It was introduced on April 8, 1983 through the TMS32010 processor, which was then the fastest DSP on the market. The processor is available in many different variants, some with fixed-point arithmetic and some with floating point arithmetic. The TMS320 processors were fabricated on MOS integrated circuit chips, including both NMOS and CMOS variants. The floating point DSP TMS320C3x, which exploits delayed branch logic, has as many as three delay slots. The flexibility of this line of processors has led to it being used not merely as a co-processor for digital signal processing but also as a main CPU. Newer implementations support standard IEEE JTAG control for boundary scan and/or in-circuit debugging. The original TMS32010 and its subsequent variants is an example of a CPU with a modified Harvard architecture, which features separate address spaces for instruction and data memory but the ability to read data values from instruction memory. The TMS32010 featured a fast multiply-and-accumulate operation useful in both DSP applications as well as transformations used in computer graphics. The graphics controller card for the Apollo Computer DN570 Workstation, released in 1985, was based on the TMS32010 and could transform 20,000 2D vectors every second. Variants The TMS320 architecture has been around for a while so a number of product variants have developed. The product codes used by Texas Instruments after the first TMS32010 processor have involved a very popular series of processor named TMS320Cabcd where a is the main series, b the generation and cd is some custom number for a minor sub-variant. For this reason people working with DSPs often abbreviate a processor as \\"C5x\\" when the actual name is something like TMS320C5510, since all products obviously have the name \\"TMS320\\" and all processors with \\"C5\\" in the name are code compatible and share the same basic features. Sometimes you will even hear people talking about \\"C55x\\" and similar subgroupings, since processors in the same series and same generation are even more similar. The TMS320 processors were fabricated on MOS integrated circuit chips, including both NMOS and CMOS variants. =Legacy series= * TMS320C1x, first generation 16-bit fixed-point DSPs.

In many ways the Cell microprocessor followed this design approach. =C2000 series= * C2000 microcontroller family consists of 32-bit microcontrollers with performance integrated peripherals designed for real-time control applications. C2000 consists of 5 sub-families: the newer C28x + ARM Cortex M3 series, C28x Delfino floating-point series, C28x Piccolo series, C28x fixed-point series, and C240x, an older 16-bit line that is no longer recommended for new development. The C2000 series is notable for its high performance set of on- chip control peripherals including PWM, ADC, quadrature encoder modules, and capture modules. The series also contains support for I¬≤C, SPI, serial (SCI), CAN, watchdog, McBSP, external memory interface and GPIO. Due to features like PWM waveform synchronization with the ADC unit, the C2000 line is well suited to many real-time control applications. The C2000 family is used for applications like motor drive and control, industrial automation, solar and other renewable energy, server farms, digital power, power-line communications, and lighting.

Trotter is a former NCAA national champion in the 400m, and competed in the 2004, 2008, and 2012 Summer Olympics. There, she was a two-time Olympic gold medalist in the 4 √ó 400 m relay (2004 and 2012), in addition to a bronze medalist in the 2012 400m event. She placed 5th in the same event in 2004. Trotter is currently a brand ambassador for international company Education First, and a global motivational speaker. Early life Trotter was born in Twenty Nine Palms, California on December 8, 1982. She grew up in Decatur, Georgia, graduating from Cedar Grove High School in 2001. She was a member of both the track and basketball teams, helping to lead the basketball team in her senior year to an undefeated season on home court. She specialized in both the 200m and 400m in track, and in her senior year, she also helped lead the 4 √ó 400 m relay team from her highschool to the Georgia State Championship. College track and field Trotter was mainly a basketball player in high school, and took up track-and-field as a second sport under the encouragement of those who saw her running on the court. She earned a track-and-field scholarship to the University of Tennessee, and was forced to turn away from basketball and focus solely on running. In 2003, she placed second in the NCAA championships in the distance, and in 2004 she was the NCAA champion. She still holds the Tennessee record time of 50.0s. She graduated from the university with a major in Sociology. She later trained under coach Caryl Smith Gilbert, who continued to train Trotter after her graduation. Trotter became the first woman to turn professional as a track-and-field athlete coming out of the University of Tennessee before graduation, turning pro in her junior year. Professional track and field career =2003-04= Trotter competed at the 2003 IAAF World Athletics Championship in France, running in the 400m, where she qualified for the semi-finals. That year she also won gold in the 4 √ó 400 m women's relay, at both the World Championships and the Pan-American Games. Trotter qualified for the 2004 Summer Olympics team in the 400m, and was considered a medal contender going into the games. Trotter placed 5th overall in the 400 metres with a personal best time of 50.00s. She was part of the US team which finished first in the 4√ó400 meters relay, which beat the second placed team from Russia by more than one second. Trotter ran first, with a lead leg time of 49.19 seconds. =2005-11= In 2005 and 2006, Trotter repeated as gold medalist at the USA Indoor Championships. In 2007, she won an additional 4 √ó 400 m gold at that year's World Championships. In 2007, she finished first in the 400m at the US Track and Field Championships, with the fastest time in the world that year: 49.64 seconds, and afterwards stated that her victory \\"was like a dream\\". According to USA Track and Field, \\"At the 2008 Olympic Trials, in perhaps the most astounding story of the women‚Äôs 400, Trotter finished third in 50.88. She was running with a broken bone chip in her left leg, the result of an errant car door closing on her two months ago.\\" Trotter did compete in the women's 400 meters race at the 2008 Summer Olympics, and qualified out of heats for the semi-finals, but failed to qualify for the finals due to the injury. She also withdrew from her spot on the 4 √ó 400 m relay. After the Olympics Trotter had successful reconstructive surgery and was able to return to competition in 2009. In her return races, she used face paint to help motivate her return to form. However the following three years she remained plagued with injuries. Still, in 2010 during the Reebok Boston Indoor Games Trotter tripped near the beginning of the race, but was able to recover her stride and eventually place first in the 400m event despite the misstep. She stated after the race that nothing like that had ever happened to her, but her first instinct was 'as long as I'm not on the ground, just keep running'. Trotter is also a multi-time IAAF Diamond League silver and bronze medalist. =2012 to present= Leading into the 2012 Olympics, she again recorded the fastest time that year in the 400m. She said of the time that, \\"My personality, demeanor, confidence and spirit were low. That DeeDee is gone. I overcame my entire career crumbling and made the Olympic Team.\\" She qualified at the national championships with a second place showing. At the 2012 Olympics in London she won the bronze medal in the 400 meters in a time of 49.72, two one hundredths of a second behind the silver medalist. She was also the lead runner in the gold medal 4 √ó 400 m US relay team, providing her team with a 10 m lead at the end of her leg. After winning the event, Trotter stated that, \\"I think the pressure was on to go out and do what we are capable of doing ... I think we finally hit the mark this time. We hit the center of the target. We got it done.‚Äù Trotter ran her final lap at the 2016 USA Olympic Trials to gracefully retire from the sport. After a thirteen-year career, Trotter waved farewell to the crowd at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon, after crossing the finish line of the 400m semifinals and not advancing to the finals. Other work In 2009 Trotter was the winner of the Bodybuilding.com Model Search, transitioning into a part-time career as a fitness model. In 2013 Trotter became a volunteer assistant coach in the sprints for the USC Trojans track and field team. That year she also began a fundraising drive called Gifted Soles, which gathers shoes for the homeless population of Orlando. The drive also raised funds for 500 meals for the homeless as well. Donations were made through the Orlando Union Rescue Mission. In 2014, Trotter dissolved her non-profit organization Test Me I‚Äôm Clean and launched a new non-profit entitled Running For The People. Running For The People used running as a way to help people in need of encouragement. In 2020, Trotter traveled to Japan as a Sports Envoy for the U.S. State Department's Sports Diplomacy Office. Anti-doping advocacy Trotter is the founder of Test Me I'm Clean, a charity dedicated to combating the abuse of steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs. She also acts as the organization's spokesperson, traveling across the United States giving speeches and presentations to students about the importance of staying clean. Those that support the organization can identify themselves with a white and red rubber armband, which Trotter herself wore during her 2012 bronze medal race. Trotter was inspired to found the charity in 2006, after overhearing a conversation on an airplane where the participants were convinced that all elite athletes were on steroids, which she took exception to. She has said of the program that, \\"I'm more concerned with the health aspect than anything else ... [Drugs] have been glorified. It's not something that is always emphasized as a danger, so I wanted to make that very clear.\\" Trotter was one of the founding athletes of Project Believe, in which twelve athletes volunteered for frequent random out- of-competition drug testing. As a part of the testing she volunteer to give 31 additional testing samples. She was quoted as saying of the program that, \\"[T]o prevent myself from going down in the flames ... We have to do something ... Otherwise, it will continue to go down this path, and it won't stop.\\" In 2009, Trotter also became one of the first twelve athletes to join the \\"Athlete Ambassador\\" program, which is a U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) initiative. As an ambassador, Trotter travelled to speak with students about the importance of staying clean in sports. She also wrote articles for the USADA website. After this initial advocacy, Athens 4 √ó 400 m relay team member Crystal Cox, pleaded guilty to a doping violation in 2010, and was stripped of her gold medal. In 2013 however, the other three members (including Trotter) were allowed to keep their own gold medals and the team remains the gold medal team in the historical Olympics standings.

For example, in economics a regression to explain and predict money demand (how much people choose to hold in the form of the most liquid assets) could be conducted with either cross-sectional or time series data. A cross-sectional regression would have as each data point an observation on a particular individual's money holdings, income, and perhaps other variables at a single point in time, and different data points would reflect different individuals at the same point in time. In contrast, a regression using time series would have as each data point an entire economy's money holdings, income, etc. at one point in time, and different data points would be drawn on the same economy but at different points in time.

Education Gregorio Zaide's primary and secondary education were in Spanish language, when it was the social language of the Philippines. He graduated valedictorian from Laguna High School (now called the Pedro Guevara Memorial National High School) in Santa Cruz, Laguna in 1926. He obtained his Master of Arts in 1931 from the University of the Philippines in Manila, his Bachelor of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degrees in 1934 from the University of Santo Tomas in Manila. Career In his time, he was the most traveled Filipino historian, with teaching and research stints at various universities and institutions in the Philippines and around the world. He worked at the University of the Philippines Diliman in Quezon City; at the University of Santo Tomas, San Beda College, University of Manila, and Far Eastern University in Manila. He also taught and researched for the University of Hawaii and around the United States, as well as at the United Nations and around Asia. As a fluent speaker of the Spanish language, he worked in Mexico, and other Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America. He became a member of Instituto Historico de la Independencia Americana (Historical Institute of American Independence) in Argentina and the Instituto Panamericano de Geografia e Historia (Pan American Institute of Geography and History) in Mexico.

Legacy The earliest editions of Zaide's books were standard texts studied by students during the Philippines' immediate post-WWII period, and became very influential because of their influence on the education of first generation after Philippine independence, and because some of these books continue to be released in updated editions. Zaide's historical works are generally known for their lively prose \\\\- with Palanca laureate Butch Dalisay noting that his works were \\"as fascinating to [him] as a boy as any of Edgar Rice Burroughs‚Äô Martian chronicles.\\" In the same breath, however, these works are criticized as lacking in \\"the important qualifications and nuances to be made to telling the story of our past, such as the fact that histories unavoidably took sides, and that it was all too easy to be seduced into taking the wrong one.\\" In particular, Zaide has been criticized for portraying history in a way that put the Philippines' colonial experience under the Spanish and the Americans in an over-simplistically positive light. Historian Ambeth Ocampo has noted that this \\"old-fashioned\\" style and perspective was simply reflective of historians of Zaide's generation, noting: > \\"Zaide may be old-fashioned to a generation that grew up with the works of > nationalist historians Teodoro A. Agoncillo and Renato Constantino, but I > have always appreciated his two-volume work [‚ÄúThe Pageant of Philippine > History‚Äù].

Medieval burghs started to appear in the twelfth century. They provided an environment in which merchants and craftsmen could live and work outside the feudal system. However each burgh had to pay significant sums of money to the post holder of its original creator. This could be the crown, an abbot or a bishop, or also a secular baron. http://www.scan.org.uk/knowledgebase/topics/burgh.htm Royal Burgh These were founded by, or subsequently granted, a royal charter. They were abolished in law in 1975, but the term is still used by many former royal burghs.Select Committee on Privileges Second Report, September 1999 Most royal burghs were either created by the Crown, or upgraded from another status, such as burgh of barony. Many were ports and they shared a monopoly of foreign trade. Police burgh The Burgh Police (Scotland) Act, 1833 (3 & 4 Wm IV c.46) enabled existing royal burghs, burghs of regality, and burghs of barony to adopt powers of paving, lighting, cleansing, watching, supplying with water and improving their communities. The Burgh Police (Scotland) Act, 1892 (55 & 56 Vict. c.55) meant each burgh was now united as a single body corporate for police and municipal purposes. Any remaining burghs of barony or regality that had not adopted the police acts were implicitly dissolved. They were abolished in 1975.

The act covers major issues involving generation, distribution, transmission and trading in power. While some of the sections have already been enacted and are yielding benefits, there are a few other sections that are yet to be fully enforced till date. Background Before Electricity Act, 2003, the Indian Electricity sector was guided by The Indian Electricity Act, 1910 and The Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 and the Electricity Regulatory Commission Act, 1998. The generation, distribution and transmission were carried out mainly by the State Electricity Boards in various States. Due to politico-economic situation, the cross-subsidies reached at an unsustainable level. For the purpose of distancing state governments from tariff determination, The Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act was enacted in 1998. So as to reform electricity sector further by participation of private sector and to bring in competition, Electricity Act was enacted in 2003. With effect from 2 June 2003 India has adopted a new legislation called the Electricity Act 2003, to replace some age-old existing legislation operating in the country. The new act consolidates the position for existing laws and aims to provide for measures conducive to the development of electricity industry in the country. The act has attempted to address certain issues that have slowed reform in the country and consequently has generated new hopes for the electricity industry. This paper reviews the Electricity Act 2003, to highlight how the new features are different from the existing legal provisions and whether these measures have economic rationale. An act to consolidate the laws relating to generation, transmission, distribution, trading and use of electricity for taking measures conducive to development of electricity industry, promoting competition therein, protecting interest of consumers and supply of electricity to all areas, rationalisation of electricity tariff, ensuring transparent policies regarding subsidies, promotion of efficient and environmentally benign policies, constitution of Central Electricity Authority Regulatory Commissions and establients of Appellate Tribunal for matters therewith or incident thereto. Generation The Act delicenses power generation completely (except for all nuclear and hydro-power projects over a certain size). As per the Act, 10 per cent of the power supplied by suppliers and distributors to the consumers has to be generated using renewable and non-conventional sources of energy so that the energy is reliable. Electricity generation has been made a non-licensed activity and the techno-economic clearance from the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) has been done away with for any power plant, except for hydro- electric power stations above a certain amount of capital investment. This has been provided in section 7 and 8 of the Electricity Act 2003. The generators can sell electricity to any licensees or where allowed by the state regulatory commissions, to consumers directly. The provision of direct sale of electricity by the generators, when and where allowed, would promote more IPP participation in the power generation, as these consumers are more creditworthy and bankable compared to many SEB‚Äôs. However the act provides for imposition of a surcharge by the regulatory body to compensate for some loss in cross-subsidy revenue to the SEB‚Äôs due to this direct sale of electricity by generators to the consumers. Distribution The Act licenses distribution in rural areas and brings in a licensing regime for distribution in urban areas. However, as per the Act, only 16 states in India have notified what constitutes as rural areas and therefore the rural distribution is yet to be freed up in nearly one third of the country. Key features The main features of the act are as follows: # Generation is being de-licensed and captive generation freely permitted, i.e. any generating company may establish, operate and maintain a generating station without obtaining a licence under this Act with the only exception that it should comply with the technical standards relating to connectivity with the grid referred to in clause (b) of section 73. #:Note: Hydro-projects, however, need concurrence from the Central Electricity Authority. # No person shall #:(a)transmit electricity; or #:(b)distribute electricity; or #:(c)undertake trading in electricity, #:unless he is authorised to do so by a licence issued, exceptions are informed by authorised commissions through notifications. # Central Government may, make region-wise demarcation of the country, and, from time to time, make such modifications therein as it may consider necessary for the efficient, economical and integrated transmission and supply of electricity, and in particular to facilitate voluntary inter-connections and co-ordination of facilities for the inter-State, regional and inter-regional generation and transmission of electricity. Transmission utility at the central and state level to be a government company with responsibility of planned and coordinated development of transmission network. # Open access in transmission with provision for surcharge for taking care of current level of cross-subsidy, with the surcharge being gradually phased out. # The state governments are required to unbundle State Electricity Boards. However they may continue with them as distribution licensees and state transmission utilities. # Setting up State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) has been made mandatory. # An appellate tribunal to hear appeals against the decision of (CERC's) and SERC's. # Metering of electricity supplied made mandatory. # Provisions related to thefts of electricity made more stringent. # Trading as a distinct activity recognised with the safeguard of Regulatory commissions being authorised to fix ceiling on trading margins. # For rural and remote areas, stand-alone system for generation and distribution is permitted. # Thrust to complete rural electrification and provide for management of rural distribution by panchayat, cooperative societies, NGOs, franchisees etc. # Central government to prepare National Electricity Policy and Tariff Policy. # Central Electricity Authority (CEA) to prepare National Electricity Plan. Role of CEA The role of CEA is limited to policy recommendations, monitoring electricity sector performance, advising the Ministry of power on technical issues, data management/dissemination of the power sector, etc. Preparation of technical standards for construction of electrical plants, electric lines and connectivity to the grid is the responsibility of CEA as per section 73 (b) of the Electricity Act, 2003. However, as per section 7 of this Act, a generating company may establish, operate and maintain a generating station if it complies with the technical standards only relating to connectivity to the grid as given in clause (b) of section 73. This implies that generating stations need not follow compulsory the CEA technical standards specified for construction of electrical plants and electric lines. Similarly, transmission / distribution licensees need not implement compulsory the standards for construction of electric lines except the Grid Code/ Grid Standards for the operation and maintenance of transmission lines specified by CEA under clause 73 (d) of this Act. Many times, these CEA standards are conservative compromising optimum design features /cost/ utility and also do not give full clarity in selection of the system / sub system capabilities of electrical plants and electric line. Left Parties Opposition Left parties opposed the clauses related to competition in electricity market such as unbundling of Electricity Boards and open access and also had strong objection regarding elimination of cross subsidies. UPA government, in its first tenure agreed for some of the amendments and according clause regarding cross subsidies are amended. In its second tenure, UPA government published a draft amendment of The Electricity Act 2003 with the main intension of separation of retail sale of electricity from distribution business. Amendments Several amendments were made after 2003 in the Act. The amendments proposed during 2015 is to make major changes. The important provision is to introduce electricity supply companies who will not own electric lines. The Government says it would attract competition and therefore will cause reduction in price. But those oppose these amendments say that in Indian situation competition can not bring down the cost. Some electricity finance experts are of the opinion that it will weaken the public sector discoms and can damage power sector industry in the country.Amendment to Act will change power sector Section 25 of the electricity act, 2003 authorises the central government to demarcate the country into regions necessary for the efficient, economical and integrated transmission and supply of electricity, and in particular to facilitate voluntary interconnections and co-ordination of facilities for the inter-State, regional and interregional generation and transmission of electricity. Electricity is listed in the concurrent list (entry 38 of list III). The traditional and unscientific demarcation of the country into five regions (north, south, east, west and north east regions) without giving any valid justification and applying one set of rules for intra region and different set of rules for inter regions in sharing electricity transmission system and transmission losses, etc. is considered discriminating one state from another state. Without the public interest, Constitution does not recognise different set of rules applicable for a group of states except ratified by each of the concerned state under Article 252 of the constitution. The concept of dividing the country in to regions by clubbing few states, emerged in seventies to envisage pit head super thermal power stations nearer to coal mines and to supply the generated power to far flung areas by high voltage transmission lines. In last forty years, electricity sector in India has grown many folds and the present power consumption in many big states has exceeded the regional level power consumption at that time. Moreover, the electricity generation from other sources such as natural gas, hydro, nuclear, wind, solar, imported coal, etc. has increased substantially and country has achieved decentralisation and diversification with respect to electricity generation and its consumption. The concept of regions is no more useful by treating the states in a region at par and outside the region differently. Many states forming boundary of a region are unable to draw/export cheaper power from adjoining regions/states due to regional bias / differentiation. Also, the electricity grid has transformed into one national grid and the emergence of single grid operation has made practically regional grids obsolete. Each state should be considered as one administrative entity/region/area for power transmission and its losses accounting and its commercial settlement as a part of national grid. Section 25 (provision to create regions) and other related sections of the Electricity Act 2003 & proposed Electricity Bill 2014 are unconstitutional in the absence of its ratification by each state. Electricity is also being transmitted in circuitous path (ex: north-eastern region exports power to eastern region, eastern region exports power to northern and western regions, western region exports power to northern region and power from northern region is exported back to north-eastern region. Similarly eastern region exports power to western region and western region exports to southern region instead of eastern region directly export all the net power needed by the southern, northern and north-eastern regions.) on daily basis without any economic sense by the central transmission company. Thus regional concept for power generation and transmission has become counter productive. Exceptions The Act extends to the whole of India except the state of Jammu and Kashmir. However, Jammu and Kashmir is part of the northern region for sharing the transmission network and the electricity generated from the central power generating stations located in the Northern region. As of now above rule may not be applicable as article 370, a special status for Jammu and Kashmir had been ruled out.

Smoktunovsky created an integral heroic portrait, which blended together what seemed incompatible before: manly simplicity and exquisite aristocratism, kindness and caustic sarcasm, a derisive mindset and self- sacrifice. Smoktunovsky became known to wider audiences as Yuri Detochkin in Eldar Ryazanov's detective satire Beware of the Car (1966), which revealed the actor's outstanding comic gifts. Later, he played Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky in Tchaikovsky (1969), Uncle Vanya in Andrei Konchalovsky's screen version of Chekhov's play (1970), the Narrator in Andrei Tarkovsky's The Mirror (1975), an old man in Anatoly Efros's On Thursday and Never Again (1977), and Salieri in Mikhail Schweitzer's Little Tragedies (1979) based on Aleksander Pushkin's plays. In 1990, Smoktunovsky won the Nika Award in the category Best Actor. He died on Wednesday 3 August 1994, at a sanatorium, aged 69. The minor planet 4926 Smoktunovskij was named after him.

Early life Bissell was born on December 31, 1847 in New London, Oneida County, New York. He was the son of John Bissell (1808‚Äì1889), a prominent forwarding merchant in Buffalo, and Isabella Jeanette (n√©e Hally) Bissell (1813‚Äì1885). His older brother, Arthur Douglas Bissell, was the president of the New York State Bankers Association and president of the People's Bank of Buffalo. He was of Scotch-Irish ancestry. He prepared at Hopkins Grammar School in New Haven, Connecticut and graduated from Yale University in 1869 and was a member of Skull and Bones.Publications of the Buffalo Historical Society, vol. 7, 1904 Career Following his graduation from Yale, he began the study of law in Buffalo with Lanning, Cleveland & Folson. He was admitted to the bar in 1871 and began practicing. From 1873 to 1882 he was a law partner of future President Grover Cleveland and acted as chief groomsman when Cleveland was married. Bissell entered Democratic Party politics as a candidate for Presidential Elector in 1888. He served as Postmaster General under Cleveland from 1893 to 1895. In 1896, he was a delegate to the 1896 Democratic National Convention.Wilson S. Bissell, United States Postmaster Apgar's Corners in Tewksbury Township, New Jersey was renamed in 1893 to the village of Bissell in an effort to sway him into ordering that a post office be created in the settlement. A small post office building (no longer in existence) was established soon thereafter.Stevenson, R.P; Potter, M., Oldtime Days In Mountainville, and Surrounding Towns, (1990), pp.92 From 1902 until his death in 1903, Bissell served as the Chancellor of the University of Buffalo. Personal life On February 6, 1890, Bissell was married to Louise Fowler Sturges (1866‚Äì1921) of Geneva, New York. They were the parents of one child. Bissell died at age 55 on October 6, 1903 at his residence in Buffalo, New York. After a funeral at Trinity Episcopal Church in Buffalo (where former President Cleveland was a pallbearer), his body was cremated and his ashes were buried in the family lot at Forest Lawn Cemetery, Buffalo.

It was the second game by Mind Control software, founded by industry veteran Andrew Leker in 1994.about at mind-control.com In May 2001, the beta gameFAQ at silencer.8k.com was pulled from online play when won.net went offline and development ended. On September 17, 2007, Arsia Mons, a veteran group who reversed engineered the software, released an installer that allowed easy playability. The server binaries were unstable and required bug fixing. The lobby servers were completely taken offline shortly after. In 2013, zSILENCER was created as a replacement for the defunct Silencer beta using the existing asset files. It is now a \\"99% accurate\\" clone. The lobby server is open and remains active (verified October 2014). The development happens now with the source code open on GitHub without a specified license.zSILENCER on GitHub In addition to Windows, the game was ported on Mac, Linux, Ouya console,silencer on gamerankings and the OpenPandora.zsilencer on repo.openpandora.org  Story  It is the near future on Mars, and the government is up to no good. As a result, there are powers that are trying to overthrow the government, known as Silencers. They are hackers and brokers of secrets, and they are not friendly to each other. The game takes place at a base called Arsia Mons.  Gameplay  Silcencer combines elements of sidescroller games with other Sci-Fi action games such as Crusader: No Remorse. In the game, there are multiple competing agencies that send agents into the field to hack public computer terminals, with the goal of exposing the Martian government's secrets. Agents in the same agency could work as a team, and agents could buy a variety of items and weapons to help their team excel or to hinder an opponent. When you begin, you'll join one of five rebel agencies, fighting with other members of your agency team to collect three top secrets. The first team to do so wins the scenario. Each team's leader creates a door to a base, which has resources for healing, purchases and storing secrets. Silencers travel throughout the playfield in search of green-lit computer devices, which can be hacked by pressing the space bar. Silencers are rewarded for any hacked information they carry back to their base. Money can then be spent with the use of the computer display to the right. In addition to any regular data, they also gain information that helps them track down a top secret. Once all nine categories of the top secret have been discovered, the Silencer will learn the location of a computer terminal in the playfield that will be storing the top secret for a short time. The Silencer must then be moved to that location, gain the top-secret (which is automatic), and then make it back to the base and deposit the top secret to the far right computer memory bank. = Agencies = There are several agencies in the game with specializations which give them advantages and disadvantages: Noxis, high in endurance; Static, excellent radar technology; Caliber, best purchases available and secret info; Lazarus, high- tech cult that worships rebirth; Black Rose, an elite agency that always works alone. = Technology = The number next to each technology represents the amount of slots they use. Some technologies are agency specific, among them Laser, Rocket, Flamer Ammo, Poison, Security Pass, Health Pack, Virus, Lazarus Tract, E. M. P. Bomb, Shaped Bomb, Plasma Bomb, Plasma Detonator, Fixed Cannon, Flare, Camera, Base Door, Base Defense, Insider Info, Neutron Bomb. Disguise is an important feature as it will allow the Silencer to pass unnoticed in areas with guards, robots and defense lasers. Note that firing any weapon or being shot will immediately end a Silencer's disguise. The jet pack can be used for about five seconds at a time before needing to be recharged. The duration of the jetpack can be upgraded for increased air time.

Bank of America Tower is also lit with the red, white and blue color scheme. In color theory, a color scheme is the choice of colors used in various artistic and design contexts. For example, the \\"Achromatic\\" use of a white background with black text is an example of a basic and commonly default color scheme in web design. Color schemes are used to create style and appeal. Colors that create an aesthetic feeling when used together will commonly accompany each other in color schemes. A basic color scheme will use two colors that look appealing together. More advanced color schemes involve several related colors in \\"Analogous\\" combination, for example, text with such colors as red, yellow, and orange arranged together on a black background in a magazine article. The addition of light blue creates an \\"Accented Analogous\\" color scheme. Use of the phrase color scheme may also and commonly does refer to choice and use of colors used outside typical aesthetic media and context, although may still be used for purely aesthetic effect as well as for purely practical reasons. This most typically refers to color patterns and designs as seen on vehicles, particularly those used in the military when concerning color patterns and designs used for identification of friend or foe, identification of specific military units, or as camouflage. In hotel room designs, the relationship between preferences of color schemes and gender was detected. Male guests tend to prefer masculine color schemes, while female guests favor feminine color schemes. A color scheme in marketing is referred to as a trade dress and can sometimes be protected by trademark or trade dress laws, as is the pink color of Owens Corning fiberglass. Color schemes are often described in terms of logical combinations of colors on a color wheel. Different types of schemes are used. Types =Monochromatic= Example of monochromatic color Monochromatic colors are all the colors (tints, tones, and shades) of a single hue. Monochromatic color schemes are derived from a single base hue, and extended using its shades, tones and tints (that is, a hue modified by the addition of black, gray (black + white) and white. As a result, the energy is more subtle and peaceful due to a lack of contrast of hue. =Complementary= Chevreul's 1855 \\"chromatic diagram\\" based on the RYB color model, showing complementary colors and other relationships For the mixing of colored light, Newton's color wheel is often used to describe complementary colors, which are colors that cancel each other's hue to produce an achromatic (white, gray or black) light mixture. Newton offered as a conjecture that colors exactly opposite one another on the hue circle cancel out each other's hue; this concept was demonstrated more thoroughly in the 19th century. A key assumption in Newton's hue circle was that the \\"fiery\\" or maximum saturated hues are located on the outer circumference of the circle, while achromatic white is at the center. Then the saturation of the mixture of two spectral hues was predicted by the straight line between them; the mixture of three colors was predicted by the \\"center of gravity\\" or centroid of three triangle points, and so on. =Split-Complementary= The Split-Complementary (also called 'Compound Harmony') color scheme is a three-color combination consisting of base color and two colors that are 150 degrees and 210 degrees apart from the base color. The Split-Complementary color scheme has the same sharp visual contrast as the complementary color scheme but has less pressure. =Achromatic= Any color that lacks strong chromatic content is said to be 'unsaturated, achromatic, or near neutral'. Pure achromatic colors include black, white, all grays and beiges; near neutrals include browns, tans, pastels, and darker colors. Near neutrals can be of any hue or lightness. Neutrals are obtained by mixing pure colors with white, black or gray, or by mixing two complementary colors. In color theory, neutral colors are colors easily modified by adjacent more saturated colors and they appear to take on the hue complementary to the saturated color. Next to a bright red couch, a gray wall will appear distinctly greenish. Black and white have long been known to combine well with almost any other colors; black decreases the apparent saturation or brightness of colors paired with it, and white shows off all hues to equal effect. =Analogous= Contrasting color combinations such as blue and red create visual vibrations when placed next to each other, while analogous colors such orange and red blend together. Analogous colors (also called Dominance Harmony) color scheme are groups of colors that are adjacent to each other on the color wheel, with one being the dominant color, which tends to be a primary or secondary color, and two on either side complementing, which tend to be tertiary. The term analogous refers to having an analogy or corresponding to something in particular. An analogous color scheme creates a rich, monochromatic look. It‚Äôs best used with either warm or cool colors, creating a look that has a certain temperature as well as proper color harmony. While this is true, the scheme also lacks contrast and is less vibrant than complementary schemes. Red, reddish-orange, orange, yellow-orange is one example of a set of analogous colors. Accented analogous An accented analogous complementary scheme utilizes related hues lying adjacent on the color wheel with a hue directly opposite to these. This direct complement becomes the accent color, used to create a dominant color grouping of three similar colors accented with the direct complement (or the near complement) of one of them. The complementary accent color creates an interesting contrast against the dominant color grouping. This scheme is frequently used to put a warm accent color with a cool analogous color palette, or a cool accent color with a warm palette. =Triadic= Example of a triadic color scheme The Triadic color scheme is a three-color combination consisting of base color and two colors that are 120 degrees and 240 degrees apart from the base color. Triadic color schemes tend to be quite vibrant. Even when using pale or unsaturated versions of hues, it offers a higher degree of contrast while also retaining the color harmony. This scheme is trendy among artists because it provides sharp visual contrast while maintaining balance, and color richness. The triadic scheme is not as contrasting as the complementary scheme, but it is easier to accomplish balance and harmony with these colors. =Tetradic= The Tetradic (also called 'Double Complementary') color scheme is considered the richest because it uses four colors arranged into two complementary color pairs. This scheme is hard to harmonize and requires a color to dominate or subdue the colors; if all four colors are used in equal amounts, the color scheme may look unbalanced. Rectangle (Tetradic) The Rectangle color scheme is a four- color combination consisting of a base color and three colors that are 60 degrees, 180 degrees, and 240 degrees apart from the base color. Rectangle color schemes work best when one color is dominant. Square (Tetradic) The Square color scheme is a four-color combination consisting of a base color and three colors that are 90 degrees apart from the base color. Square color schemes are rich in color and offer variations. =Polychromatic= The term polychromatic means having several colors. It is used to describe light that exhibits more than one color, which also means that it contains radiation of more than one wavelength. The study of polychromatic is particularly useful in the production of diffraction gratings. In Maps and Data Visualization Thematic maps, charts, Data science, spreadsheets and other tools use graphical means to visualize quantitative data. Color is often used as one of these graphical tools, due to its aesthetic appeal, its intuitive contrast (i.e., people can instantly differentiate a large number of colors), and its multidimensional richness, which allows variations in color to carry a great deal of meaning. A variety of color schemes for representing quantitative variation have been developed by cartographers to represent quantitative variable ranges intuitively, especially for choropleth maps. These have generally been adopted for other forms of visualization as well, such as the Heat map. These fall into several categories: Monochrome Sequential Color Scheme Part-spectral sequential color scheme * Sequential Schemes use color value to represent quantitative or ordinal values. It is commonly assumed that the darkest shade intuitively represents the largest value, but on a dark background, a light shade may be more intuitive because it contrasts more. Two subtypes exist, depending on how Hue may also be used: ** Monochrome Schemes use tints of a single hue or shades of gray. Studies have shown that while humans are capable of seeing hundreds of shades of most colors, they can only distinguish 5-8 for practical use (i.e., matching shade on the map to the corresponding shade in the legend). ** Part-Spectral Schemes use a range of hues in addition to value, generally incorporating a partial segment of the Color wheel, such as a light yellow to dark green, or a light orange to a dark red. The advantage of this approach is that the hue differences add contrast, enabling users to distinguish a larger number of distinct colors, up to 12-15. Divergent color scheme * Divergent Schemes use two sequential schemes (monochrome or part spectral), sharing a common (usually the lightest) color in the center and the darkest at the two ends. Their primary use is to emphasize (by the principles of visual hierarchy) the extreme values at both the high and low ends. Spectral color scheme * Spectral Schemes use a large segment or even the full range of Hue to represent the range of quantitative values, with no variation in value. This can be difficult to interpret with most data because hues do not naturally look like \\"more\\" or \\"less\\" than other hues. It can be useful, however, for representing cyclical variables, which can map directly onto a Color wheel, such as the terrain aspect , wind direction, or Seasonality. * Bivariate or Trivariate Schemes use two or three orthogonal monochrome sequential schemes to represent separate (but usually related) variables, with the various blended colors representing different combinations of values. This scheme tends to work best when the hues for each axis are primary colors: RGB on a black background, CMY on a white background, so that the mixed colors are as clear as possible. When crafted well, and with advantageous geography (in which the variables tend to have broadly consistent patterns), these color schemes are very effective at visualizing correlations and other patterns between the variables. In other situations, they can produce a seemingly random confusion of color., Elmer, M.E. 2013. ‚ÄúSymbol Considerations for Bivariate Thematic Maps.‚Äù In Proceedings of the 26th International Cartography Conference. August 25-30, Dresden, Germany Cynthia Brewer performed a number of experiments on various color schemes for data visualization in maps, especially working with those with color blindness. Eventually, this work led to a palette of several dozen color schemes designed to be reproducible on multiple devices and usable by the color-vision- impaired, which was collected into an interactive tool known as ColorBrewer in 2002. This palette quickly gained wide acceptance due to its reliable usability by non-experts, and has become a standard built into GIS and mapping software and other visualization tools.Carto.com, Color in Map Design Part 2, Carto.comKenneth Field, Brewing a new color palette for ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Blog, esri, 2014Jon Peltier, Create a Heat Map Using Excel's Conditional Formatting, Peltier Tech Blog, September 23, 2013 See also *Color gradient *Light-on-dark color scheme *Color tool *Monochromatic color *Complementary color *Analogous colors *Achromatic colors *Palette (computing) *Palette (painting) References External links * Introduction to Color Theory (Color Schemes) * ColorHexa.com - web-based color tool that supports several color schemes * iColorpalette.com - web-based color tool offers create own color schemes Category:Color ","title":"Color scheme"},{"id":"2542527","title":"Church Avenue station (IND Culver Line)"},{"id":"2542546","text":"He Who Gets Slapped is a 1924 American silent psychological thriller film starring Lon Chaney, Norma Shearer, and John Gilbert,Variety film review; November 12, 1924, page 24.Harrison's Reports film review; November 8, 1924, page 178. and directed by Victor Sj√∂str√∂m.

He Who Gets Slapped was the first film produced entirely by the newly formed Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. It was not, however, MGM's first released movie, as the film was held until the Christmas season when higher attendance was expected. The movie was highly profitable for the fledgling MGM, and was critically hailed upon release. It was also the first film to feature Leo the Lion as the mascot for MGM. Previously, Leo appeared in the logo for Goldwyn Pictures Corporation in 1916, and the trademark was retained by MGM when the companies merged. The film was important in the careers of Chaney, Shearer, Gilbert, and Sj√∂str√∂m. In 2017, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". The film entered the public domain on January 1, 2020 (along with all American films from 1924) as dictated by U.S. copyright law.https://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/movies-music-and-books-that-enter-the- public-domain-t-1840756414 Plot He Who Gets Slapped (full film) Paul Beaumont (Lon Chaney) is a scientist who labored for years alone to prove his radical theories on the origin of mankind. Baron Regnard (Marc McDermott) becomes his patron, enabling him to do research while living in his mansion. One day, Beaumont announces to his beloved wife Marie and the Baron that he has proved all his theories and is ready to present them before the Academy of the Sciences. He leaves the arrangements to the Baron. However, after Beaumont goes to sleep, Marie steals his key, opens the safe containing his papers, and gives them to the Baron. On the appointed day, Paul travels to the Academy with the Baron. He is aghast when the Baron, instead of introducing him, takes credit for Paul's work himself. After he recovers from the shock, Paul confronts him in front of everyone, but the Baron tells them that Paul is merely his assistant and slaps him. All of the academicians laugh at his humiliation. Paul later seeks comfort from his wife, but she brazenly admits she and the Baron are having an affair and calls him a clown. Paul leaves them. Five years pass by. Paul is now a clown calling himself \\"HE who gets slapped\\", the star attraction of a small circus near Paris. His act consists of his getting slapped every evening by other clowns, and includes Paul pretending to present in front of the Academy of the Sciences. Another of the performers is Bezano (John Gilbert), a daredevil horseback rider. Consuelo (Norma Shearer), the daughter of the impoverished Count Mancini, applies to join his act. Bezano falls in love with Consuelo, as does Paul. Consuelo's father, however, is planning to restore the family's fortunes by marrying her to the wealthy Baron Regnard. One night, during HE's performance, he spots the Baron in the audience and becomes enraged. The Baron then goes backstage and begins flirting with Consuelo, which she does not like. The next day, the Baron sends Consuelo jewelry, but she rejects it. When her father leaves for a meeting with the Baron, Bezano takes Consuelo out to the countryside for a romantic meeting, where they declare their love for each other. Meanwhile, Count Mancini convinces the reluctant Baron that the only way he can have Consuelo is by marrying her. The Baron agrees, and discards the heartbroken Marie, leaving her with a check. Later, HE admits to Consuelo he, too, is in love with her. She thinks he is kidding and laughingly slaps him. They are interrupted by the Baron and the Count, who inform Consuelo she will marry the Baron after the evening performance. When HE tries to interfere, he is locked in an adjoining room, where an angry lion is kept in a cage. He moves the cage so that, when he carefully opens it, only the door to the next room prevents the lion from escaping. HE re-enters the other room through the only other entrance (making sure to lock it behind him) and reveals his identity to the Baron. HE threatens the Baron, but the Count stabs him with a sword. The Baron and the Count try to leave but, finding the main entrance locked, open the side door, releasing the lion. The animal kills the Count, then the Baron. However, the lion tamer shows up and saves HE from the same fate. HE goes on stage and collapses. He assures Consuelo he is happy and that she will be happy, before dying in her arms.

He was known as Bernie Krigstein, and his artwork usually displayed the signature B. Krigstein. His best-known work in comic books is the short story \\"Master Race\\", originally published in the debut issue (April 1955) of EC Comics' Impact. Biography Born in Brooklyn, New York City to a Jewish household, Krigstein studied art at Brooklyn College.\\"Bernie Krigstein\\". Comiclopedia. His earliest confirmed work in comics is penciling and inking the 10-page, patriotic \\"kid gang\\" feature \\"The Liberty Lads\\" in Harvey Comics' Champ Comics #25 (cover-dated April 1943). He went on to draw for Harvey and for the publisher Prize Comics through 1943, during the period fans and historians call the Golden Age of Comic Books. Following World War II, he picked up drawing again in 1946, working for numerous publishers, primarily Fawcett Comics.Bernard/Bernie Krigstein at the Grand Comics Database. In 1952, Krigstein spearheaded an effort by himself and fellow comics artists Arthur Peddy, George Evans and Edd Ashe to found the comics industry's short-lived attempt at a labor union, The Society of Comic Book Illustrators. Peddy served as vice president under Krigstein, with Harry Harrison as secretary, Larry Woromay as treasurer, and Ross Andru, Ernie Bache, John Celardo, Morrie Marcus and Bernard Sachs as members-at-large. The organization went defunct shortly after publication of its third and final newsletter in June 1953. Krigstein began getting less work from his four mainstays ‚Äî National Comics (the future DC Comics), Atlas Comics (the future Marvel Comics), MLJ Comics (the future Archie Comics) and Ziff-Davis. But during his presidency of the Society, the politically like-minded publisher of EC Comics, William Gaines, began giving him work. There, Krigstein \\"would produce the most acclaimed stories of his career between 1953 and 1955.\\" Krigstein's best-known work in comic books is the short story \\"Master Race\\", originally published in the debut issue (April 1955) of EC Comics' Impact. The protagonist is a former Nazi death camp commandant named Reissman who had managed to elude justice until he is spotted ten years later riding the New York City Subway. This story was remarkable for its subject matter, since the Holocaust was rarely discussed in popular media of the 1950s, as indicated by the controversy that same year surrounding Alain Resnais's Night and Fog (1955).Cowie, Peter. \\"Night and Fog: Origins and Controversy\\". Criterion Collection, 2003. Bernard Krigstein's \\"Master Race\\" (Impact #1 (April 1955) Krigstein, who sometimes chafed at the limits of the material EC gave him to illustrate, expanded what had been planned for six-pages into an eight-page story. The results were so striking that the company reworked the issue to accommodate the two extra pages. Krigstein had stretched out certain sequences in purely visual terms; repetitive strobe-like drawings mimic the motion of a passing train, and Commandant Reissman's final moment of life is broken down into four individual poses of desperate physical struggle. Art Spiegelman described the effect in The New Yorker: \\"The two tiers of wordless staccato panels that climax the story... have often been described as 'cinematic', a phrase thoroughly inadequate to the achievement: Krigstein condenses and distends time itself... Reissman's life floats in space like the suspended matter in a lava lamp. The cumulative effect carries an impact‚Äîsimultaneously visceral and intellectual‚Äîthat is unique to comics.\\"Spiegelman, Art. \\"Ballbuster\\", The New Yorker, July 22, 2002 =Mad= Krigstein also did humor, such as \\"From Eternity Back to Here\\" in Mad #12, \\"Bringing Back Father\\" in Mad #17 and \\"Crash McCool\\" in Mad #26. In the early 1960s, Krigstein left comics in order to draw and paint illustrations for magazines, book jackets (notably, the first edition of Richard Condon's The Manchurian Candidate) and record albums, eventually turning away from commercial assignments in order to focus on fine art. In 1962, he took a position at the High School of Art and Design in Manhattan, where he taught for 20 years.Sadowski, Greg. B. Krigstein, Vol. 1. Fantagraphics Books, 2002. As Krigstein told a 1962 interviewer, \\"It's what happens between these panels that's so fascinating. Look at all that dramatic action that one never gets a chance to see. It's between these panels that the fascinating stuff takes place. And unless the artist would be permitted to delve into that, the form must remain infantile.\\"Benson, John and Stewart, Bhob.

URL last accessed on 4 July 2007 Fenton originally trained to be a civil engineer at King's College London and during World War II he was conscripted as an army engineer. He worked in this profession for five years after leaving the army, but eventually decided on a career change. He took up acting and won a scholarship to attend the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in London. Career His career in acting spans over fifty years and he continues to act occasionally on television and on stage. One of his earliest acting breaks came when he was offered a role by Orson Welles in his play Chimes At Midnight. Subsequent notable acting credits include: Studio Four (1962); Colditz (1974); Secret Army (1977); Z-Cars (1978); Play for Today (1981); Auf Wiedersehen, Pet (1983), and Shine on Harvey Moon (1982), where he played the Austrian Jew, Erich Gottlieb. In the theatre, Fenton played the role of Willie to Billie Whitelaw‚Äôs Winnie in Samuel Beckett‚Äôs Happy Days at the Royal Court Theatre in 1979, directed by Beckett himself. Fenton is best known for playing Dr. Harold Legg, one of the original characters from the BBC soap opera, EastEnders. The character appeared from the show's inception in 1985 until 1997, returning for brief stints in 2000, 2004, 2007 and 2018 until 2019 when his character was killed off. The character was originally one of the main focal points of the programme, but after 1989 he became less central. After the character's retirement in 1997, Fenton's appearances in EastEnders were fewer and further between. He made a single appearance in 2004 at the funeral of Mark Fowler, and in June 2007 to counsel Dot Branning regarding her concerns about Romanian 'foundling' baby, Tomas. Fenton's subsequent television credits have included Rumpole of the Bailey; So You Think You've Got Troubles (1991); Love Hurts (1993) and The Bill (1985; 2001; 2005), among others. In the West End he has played in two productions by Lindsay Anderson, Anton Chekhov's The Seagull and Ben Travers' last play, The Bed Before Yesterday. He has performed numerous radio plays, including The Hobbit as the Elvenking, and The Lord of the Rings as Daddy Twofoot, both for BBC Radio 4. Amongst Fenton's other broadcasting work has been the BBC webcast of the Doctor Who story Death Comes to Time. On 17 February 2006 he made a personal appearance on the Channel 4 entertainment show, The Friday Night Project. His film credits have included roles in Up the Creek (1958), The Devil-Ship Pirates (1964), Robin Hood Junior (1975), Give My Regards to Broad Street (1984), Morons from Outer Space (1985), and the British horror movie The Zombie Diaries (2006). In December 2004, at the age of 78, Fenton made his directorial debut with After Chekhov, written by four contemporary writers Alan Drury, Martin Jago, Andrew Neil and Olwen Wymark in the 100th anniversary year of Chekhov's death. The piece, produced by Little London Theatre Company was performed in the Soho Theatre Studio. In 2012 and again in 2013, Fenton appeared in a production of Cross Purpose, directed by Stephen Whitson at the King's Head Theatre, London. On 25 July 2018, it was confirmed that Fenton would reprise his role as Dr. Harold Legg in EastEnders in late 2018. This stint lasted until 15 February 2019, when the character died after a long battle with pancreatic cancer. Personal life Fenton and his first wife, cellist Madeline Thorner, have four children. Aside from acting he is also a professional painter and has held several exhibitions. Before the 2010 UK general election, Fenton came out in support for the Labour Party, after appearing in their election broadcast.

This could be because of sleep issues. Tissues which may typically be removed include: * The tonsils * The adenoids Tissues which may typically be remodeled include: * The uvula (see uvulotomy) * The soft palate * The pharynx { Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. A) pre-operative, B) original UPPP, C) modified UPPP, and D) minimal UPPP. }  Procedure  UPPP involves removal of the tonsils, the posterior surface of the soft palate, and the uvula. The uvula is then folded toward the soft palate and sutured together as demonstrated in the figures. In the US, UPPP is the most commonly performed procedure for obstructive sleep apnea with approximately 33,000 procedures performed per year. The surgery is more successful in patients who are not obese, and there is a limited role in morbidly obese (>40 kg/m2) individuals.  Procedural details  =Standard procedure= UPPP is typically administered to patients with obstructive sleep apnea in isolation. It is administered as a stand-alone procedure in the hope that the tissue which obstructs the patient's airway is localized in the back of the throat. The rationale is that, by removing the tissue, the patient's airway will be wider and breathing will become easier. =Role in the \\"Stanford Protocol\\" operation= UPPP is also offered to sleep apnea patients who opt for a more comprehensive surgical procedure known as the \\"Stanford Protocol\\", first attempted by Doctors Nelson Powell and Robert Riley of Stanford University. The Stanford Protocol consists of two phases. The first involves surgery of the soft tissue (tonsillectomy, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty) and the second involves skeletal surgeries (maxillomandibular advancement). First, Phase 1 or soft tissue surgery is performed and after re-testing with a new sleep study, if there is residual sleep apnea, then Phase 2 surgery would consist of jaw surgery. The goal is to improve the airway and thereby treat (or possibly cure) sleep apnea. It has been found that obstructive sleep apnea usually involves multiple sites where tissue obstructs the airway; the base of the tongue is often involved. The Protocol successively addresses these multiple sites of obstruction. Note that genioglossus advancement can be performed either during Phase 1 or Phase 2 surgeries. Phase 2 involves maxillomandibular advancement, a surgery which moves the jaw top (maxilla) and bottom (mandible) forward. The tongue muscle is anchored to the chin, and translation of the mandible forward pulls the tongue forward as well. If the procedure achieves the desired results, when the patient sleeps and the tongue relaxes, it will no longer be able to block the airway. Success is much better for Phase 2 than for Phase 1 ‚Äì approximately 90 percent benefit from the second phase, and the success of the Stanford Protocol Operation therefore is due in large part to this second phase. There is debate among surgeons as to the role of Phase 1 surgery. In 2002, an Atlanta-based surgical team, led by Dr. Jeffrey Prinsell, published results which have approximated those of the Stanford team when UPPP was not included in their mix of surgeries.  Success  =Effectiveness in isolation= When UPPP has been administered in isolation, the results are variable. As explained above, sleep apnea is often caused by multiple co- existing obstructions at various locations of the airway such as the nasal cavity, and particularly the base of the tongue. The contributing factors in the variability of success include the pre-surgical size of the tonsils, palate, uvula and tongue base. Also, patients who are morbidly obese (body mass index >40 kg/m2) are significantly less likely to have success from this surgery. =Effectiveness of \\"The Stanford Protocol\\" operation= Over one thousand people have undergone The Stanford Protocol operation and received follow-up sleep study testing. 60 to 70 percent of patients have been entirely cured. In approximately ninety percent of patients, a significant improvement can be expected. =Multilevel approach= In the recent years, many surgeons have tried to address the multiple levels of obstruction by performing multiple procedures on the same surgical day, called the \\"multi-level approach\\". Typical surgeries in a multi-level approach may include: Nasal- level surgeries * turbinoplasty, septoplasty, septorhinoplasty Soft palate- level surgeries * uvulectomy, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, tonsillectomy Hypopharyngeal-level surgeries * hyoid suspension * tongue suspension * tongue base reduction * genioglossus advancement UPPP with tonsillectomy improves postoperative results of obstructive sleep anpea depending on tonsil size. The success rate increases with increasing tonsil size. This approach improves postoperative results in well-selected patients. Laser-assisted uvulopalatopharyngoplasty Risks One of the risks is that by cutting the tissues, excess scar tissue can \\"tighten\\" the airway and make it even smaller than it was before UPPP. After surgery, complications may include these: * Sleepiness and sleep apnea related to post-surgery medication * Swelling, infection and bleeding * A sore throat and/or difficulty swallowing * Drainage of secretions into the nose and a nasal quality to the voice. English language speech does not seem to be affected by this surgery. * Narrowing of the airway in the nose and throat (hence constricting breathing) snoring and even iatrogenically caused sleep apnea. * Patients who have had the uvula removed will become unable to correctly pronounce uvular consonants, found in French, German, Hebrew, and others. * Long term complications with pain, feeling sick and lesser sleep quality than before the LAUP. In 2008, Labra, et al., from Mexico, published a variation of UP3, by adding a uvulopalatal flap, in order to avoid such complications, with a good rate of success.

H√≤n La bay is a 4-square-km marine bay with the depth up to 15 m and a surrounding land of 4 km2 suitable to develop sea deep-water port and industrial park. =Mountains= Part of the karst mounts in Phong Nha-K·∫ª B√†ng National Park The Ho√†nh S∆°n Mountains run through the northeastern part of the province. Many mount summits concentrate in Phong Nha-K·∫ª B√†ng area with over 1,000 metres height. Noteworthy peaks are the Peak Co Rilata with ta height of 1,128 m and the Peak Co Preu with a height of 1,213 m. Mountains in karstic area of the park rise at typical height of above 800 m constitute a continuous range along Laotian-Vietnamese borderline, of which notable summits above 1000 m are: Phu T·∫°o (1174m), Co Unet (1150m), Phu Canh (1095m), Phu Mun (1078m), Phu Tu En (1078m), Phu On Chinh (1068m), Phu Dung (1064m), Phu Tu √îc (1053m), Phu Long (1015m), Phu √îc (1015m), Phu Dong (1002m).

In the summer (from May to July), it is hot, dry with little downpours, the temperature may reach up to 35 to 36 degrees Celsius. In the fall, it is rainy, cool with temperature around 22 to 28 degrees Celsius. In the winter, it is humid, slight rain with temperature about 12 to 16 degrees Celsius. Annual average precipitation is around 2,000-2,300 mm. Heaviest rainy season is from September to November. From April to August is the dry season. The hottest months are from June to August. Biodiversity =Flora= Trees on the limestone mounts, a typical florae in Phong Nha-K·∫ª B√†ng National Park Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh Province is endowed with biodiversity, especially typical of Annamites eco-region. According to the results of initial surveys, the primary tropical forest in Phong Nha-K·∫ª B√†ng is home to 140 families, 427 genera, and 751 species of vascular plants, of which 36 species are considered endangered and listed in the Vietnam's Red Data Book. The most common tree species in this park are Hopea sp., Sumbaviopsis albicans, Garcinia fagraeoides, Burretiodendron hsienmu, Chukrasia tabularis, Photinia arboreum and Diospyros salletii. Seedlings can only grow in holes and cracks in the limestone where soil has accumulated, so in general regeneration after disturbance is slow. The forest type in this national park is dominated by evergreen tree species with scattered deciduous trees such as Dipterocarpus kerri, Anogeissus acuminata, Pometia pinnata and Lagerstroemia calyculata. In Phong Nha-K·∫ª B√†ng, the dominant plant families are the Lauraceae, Fabaceae, Theaceae and Rosaceae, with some scattered gymnosperms such as Podocarpus imbricatus, Podocarpus neriifolius, and Nageia fleuryi. In the national park there is a 5000-ha forest of Calocedrus macrolepis on limestone (Calocedrus rupestris) mounts with about 2,500 trees, 600 per hectare. This is the largest forest of this tree in Vietnam. Most of these trees here are 500‚Äì600 years old. These trees are listed in group 2A (rare, precious and limited exploitation) of the official letter 3399/VPCP-NN dated 21 June 2002, an amendment to Decree 48 by the Government of Vietnam. Biologists discovered three rare orchid species. Orchids found here include: Paphiopedilum malipoense, Paphiopedilum dianthum, Paphiopedilum concolor. In 1996, IUCN classified these orchid species in danger of extinction in the near future. Endemic species in Phong Nha-K·∫ª B√†ng National Park include: Burretiodendron hsienmu, Cryptocarya lenticellata, Deutzianthus tonkinensis, Eberhardtia tonkinensis, Heritiera macrophylla, Hopea sp., Illicium parviflorum, Litsea baviensis, Madhuca pasquieri, Michelia foveolata, Peltophorum tonkinensis, Semecarpus annamensis, Sindora tonkinensis. =Fauna= Cyrtodactylus phongnhakebangensis, a newly discovered species in Phong Nha-K·∫ª B√†ng National Park The forests of Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh, particularly in Phong Nha-K·∫ª B√†ng, are home to at least 98 families, 256 genera and 381 species of vertebrates. 66 animal species are listed in Vietnam's Red Data Book and 23 other species in the World Red Book of Endangered Species. In 2005, a new species of gecko (Lygosoma boehmeiwas) was discovered here by a group of Vietnamese biologists together with biologists working for the park, Cologne Zoo in Germany and the Saint Petersburg Wild Zoology Institute in Russia. The gaur and one species of eel have been discovered in this park. 10 new species previously unknown in Vietnam were discovered by scientists in the park. Phong Nha-K·∫ª B√†ng is home as well to a significant population of primates in Vietnam, with ten species and subspecies. These include the globally vulnerable pig-tailed macaque, Assam macaque, stump-tailed macaque and white-cheeked crested gibbon (Nomascus leucogenys and Nomascus leucogenys siki). The park is home to one of the largest populations of Fran√ßois' langur in Vietnam, including two different forms of the species. The area is known for its population of Hatinh and black langurs. 10 species of bats listed in the IUCN List of Threatened Species are recorded in this park. Of the 59 recorded reptile and amphibian species, 18 are listed in Vietnam's Red Data Book and 6 are listed in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals. The 72 fish species include 4 species endemic to the area, including Danio quangbinhensis. The park is home to over 200 bird species, including such rare birds as the chestnut-necklaced partridge, red-collared woodpecker, brown hornbill, sooty babbler and the short-tailed scimitar babbler. An initiative survey conducted by Russian and Vietnamese scientists from Vietnam-Russia Tropical Centre (funded by WWF) recorded 259 butterfly species of 11 families. Almost all major butterfly taxa in Vietnam can be found in Phong Nha-K·∫ª B√†ng. Administrative divisions Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh is subdivided into 8 district-level sub-divisions: * 6 districts: ** B·ªë Tr·∫°ch ** L·ªá Th·ªßy ** Minh H√≥a ** Qu·∫£ng Ninh ** Qu·∫£ng Tr·∫°ch ** Tuy√™n H√≥a * 1 district-level town: ** Ba ƒê·ªìn (newly created since 2013) * 1 provincial city: ** ƒê·ªìng H·ªõi (capital) They are further subdivided into 7 commune-level towns (or townlets), 136 communes, and 16 wards. These in turn are further subdivided into villages (lang or thon). Like administrative system of Vietnam, the leader of each administrative unit is the secretary of the local Communist Party Cell. Each administrative unit includes a people's council, who elects a people's committee to execute its daily affairs. Culture and education Ho·∫±ng Ph√∫c Pagoda in M·ªπ Th·ªßy The province is home to Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh University, a newly established university from the Normal College of Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh. This university has faculties of business administration, normal faculty, informatics faculty. There are several high schools and primary schools in counties. Inhabitants here regards education as family tradition and the most important means to make ends meet and to eliminate poverty. Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh province is the land of rich culture and famous people. There is an archaeological site of B√†u Tr√≥, Ph√π L∆∞u ancient bronze drums in the time of Dong Son's culture. On 3 July 2007, an earthen pot of ancient coins weighing 20 kg was found buried at 500 cm underground in a paddy field and later sold for US$12.5 per kilo. This site is located in Tran Xa village, Ham Ninh commune, Qu·∫£ng Ninh district. The coins were from the Tang dynasty period. Compared to other provinces in areas surrounding Hanoi and H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh City and ƒê√† N·∫µng, Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh is the poorer province. Therefore, more and more young and educated here find their ways to the big cities and more industrialized provinces. In each commune (x√£, a rural subdivision of a district), there is a clinic and there is a hospital in every county, in ƒê·ªìng H·ªõi city, there are more. The ƒê·ªìng H·ªõi Hospital, which was donated by Cuba, was built in the 1980s. Economy The provincial GDP per capita is one of the lowest of Vietnam (around US$1500, compared to Vietnam's average GDP per capita of US$2385). Industries base on mainly construction material production (cement, tiles, building rock, brick) thanks to its abundance in limestone and white clay deposits. The province has two industrial parks, one in ƒê·ªìng H·ªõi city and the other in Hon La bay. Sea food processing, bio-fertilizer and aluminum production are also important to this provincial economy. Over 80% of the population live on agricultural production. In recent years, tourism has been emerged as the significant contribution to Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh thanks to Phong Nha-K·∫ª B√†ng National Park and white fine sand beaches. Trade conducted with Laos through Cha Lo gate by National Road 12. In 2005, this province's export value is just 30 million US$ or 1% of Vietnam's export revenue. In 2012, the province contributed 1840 billion VND (US$90 million) to the state budget (of the total US$37.68 billion) or 0.24% onlyOfficial fiscal report by the Ministry of Finance of Vietnam (2012) The province's agriculture is comprehensively developed with the direction of production of commodities. Crops and cultivation calendar have been gradually arranged in a more appropriate manner. The food production has been continuously increased reaching 200,000 tons in 2000. The total area of industrial trees is 14,105ha, of which the area of rubber is 6,400 ha providing 2,000 tons of dried resin. Cattle and husbandry keep growing. The average agriculture growth rate is 5.7% during the period 1996‚Äì2000. In the recent years, forestry production in Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh Province has been changed in terms of structure from mainly exploiting to protecting, developing forest for forest resource conservation. The value of forestry and afforestration has increased 87.3%, in particular from 1996 to 2000 the growth rate was 65.3%. The annual forestation area is around 4,000 ha. Up to date 38,851 ha of forest has been planted. The fishery sector has continuously developed and become a key economic sector of the province. At present the province has around 3,200 fishing boats with power of over 67,000CV. In the year 2000, the output of sea products is estimated at 17,104 tons, of which about 1,600 tons is from raising. The province has 3 shrimp nursery stations, 8 fish nursery stations supplying 5‚Äì7 mil. tiger baby shrimps, 40‚Äì45mil. baby fish and 4‚Äì5 mil. fingerlings annually. At present the province has 2 factories of processing frozen sea products and 4 factories of processing dried products for exportation. The services of fishing sector such as making and repairing ships, purchasing, processing sea products and providing technical assistance and infrastructure for fishing are continuously developed. However, the development of fishery sector in recent years has not met its expected potential. As of February 2008, the province licensed 59 investment projects with a total capitalization of USD $500,000,000. , this province is home to two special economic zones with preferential investment and tax treatments, namely the H√≤n La Economic Zone by the H√≤n La seaport, and Cha Lo Border Gate Economic Zone in the border with Laos.

Phong Nha-K·∫ª B√†ng is a protected area, a national park and was listed in UNESCO's world heritage in 2003. Phong Nha-K·∫ª B√†ng is located in the B·ªë Tr·∫°ch and Minh H√≥a districts, in North Central Coast, Vietnam, about 50 km northwest of ƒê·ªìng H·ªõi, 42 km east of South China Sea from its borderline point. Phong Nha-K·∫ª B√†ng is situated in a limestone zone of 200,000 hectare in Vietnamese territory and borders another limestone of 200,000 hectare of Hin Namno in Laotian territory. The core zone of this national park covers 85,754 hectares and a buffer zone of 195,400 ha. The park was created to protect one of the world's two largest karst regions with 300 caves and grottoes and also protects the ecosystem of limestone forest of the Annamite Range region in North Central Coast of Vietnam. Phong Nha-K·∫ª B√†ng National Park is noted for its system of some 300 cave and grotto systems with a total length of about 70 km, of which only 20 have been surveyed by Vietnamese and British scientists; 17 of these are in located in the Phong Nha area and three in the K·∫ª B√†ng area. Phong Nha holds several world cave records, as it has the longest underground river, as well as the largest caverns and passageways. Following UNESCO listing of this park, the number of visitors to this province changed significantly. Tourists mainly visit Phong Nha, Tien Son and Thi√™n ƒê∆∞·ªùng caves and Hang √ân. S∆°n ƒêo√≤ng Cave has yet available for visitors due to unavailability of access road and other relating facilities. * ƒê√° Nh·∫£y, Ly Hoa and Nh·∫≠t L·ªá beaches feature white and fine sands, clean water, and are among the most attractive beaches in Vietnam * Bang Spa: a hotspring area in L·ªá Th·ªßy District with resort and health care services. The temperature of the water at the jet hole can reach up to 105 degree Celsius. * Ho Chi Minh trail, many important sites along the trail during Vietnam War. The great natural landscapes of Quang Binh have been used in the movie: Kong: Skull Island. Transportation ƒê·ªìng H·ªõi Airport in ƒê·ªìng H·ªõi, Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh Province Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh has well-developed transportation infrastructure including an airport, seaport, roadways, railways and riverways. Dong Hoi Airport currently is serviced by three airlines including Vietnam Airlines, VietJet Air and Jetstar Pacific, with flights to and from the major cities of Vietnam such as Ha Noi, Ho Chi Minh City, and Hai Phong. In August 2017, Jetstar Pacific will launch a Chiang Mai‚ÄìDong Hoi international flight. The road and rail systems, border economic zones and ports are likewise interlinked.

History Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh Citadel Gate, a citadel built during Nguy·ªÖn dynasty in ƒê·ªìng H·ªõi. US bombardment during Vietnam War in ƒê·ªìng H·ªõi. Archaeological excavation in this area proved that human living in what is now Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh province in Stone Age period. Many artifacts such as ceramic vases, stone tools, china was unearthed in Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh. In 1926, a French archaeologist, Madeleine Colani, discovered and excavated many artifacts in caves and grottoes in west mountainous areas of Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh. She concluded that the H√≤a B√¨nh culture belonged to this region. Through C14 dating test, the artifacts dated back to 10,509 (plus or minus 950) years ago.Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh, Nuoc non huyen dieu, Van Nghe Publishing House, 2000, pp. 14‚Äì17 From Quy ƒê·∫°t township (in Minh H√≥a District) to 150 m southwest, the Hum grotto contains many stone tools and animal stones from an ancient human community. Inside the Khai grotto near Quy ƒê·∫°t township, similar artifacts were also found. Especially, there are several ceramics of ƒê√¥ng S∆°n culture. Additionally, artifacts from the Stone Age were unearthed in some grottoes in Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh. Owners of these artifacts lived in the caves and grottoes and hunted for their food. Under the Hung kings, when VƒÉn Lang nation founded the VƒÉn Lang tribal coalition, Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh belonged to the Vi·ªát Th∆∞·ªùng group. Under L√™ Trung H∆∞ng, this province was named Ti√™n B√¨nh. The central and the south of Vietnam (from Ngang mount pass to B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n Province) was part of the Champa Kingdom. During that time, wars between Champa kingdom and ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát were frequent. Majority of the wars were started by Champa Kingdom, who was then, stronger than ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát. Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh became ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát's territory in 1306 A.D. following the arrange marriage of the Tr·∫ßn Dynasty princess Huy·ªÅn Tr√¢n to the Champa king, Jaya Sinhavarman III (Vietnamese: Ch·∫ø M√¢n). Huyen Tr·∫ßn was King Tr·∫ßn Nh√¢n T√¥ng's daughter and King Tr·∫ßn Anh T√¥ng's younger sister. Political matches made to acquire land were common traditional practices by Champa kings. Because of the marriage, ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát acquired lands (as dowry) of what is now Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province, and Th·ª´a Thi√™n-Hu·∫ø Province (then known respectively as Chau O and Chau Ri or Chau Ly), the new map changed Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh from being the southernmost land and the southern border of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát. During the Trinh- Nguy·ªÖn family war in the 17th century, the Gianh River in Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh Province became the border between Dang Trong (South Vietnam) and ƒê√†ng Ngo√†i (North Vietnam). ƒê·ªìng H·ªõi city was built as a fortress to protect the Nguy·ªÖn family's Dang Trong from ƒê√†ng Ngo√†i's attacks.Vi·ªát s·ª≠ x·ª© ƒê√†ng Trong (Cochinchinese history) by Phan Khoang In 1604, the provincial name was changed to Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh. Lord Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c Kho√°t divided Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh into 3 counties (dinh): dinh B·ªë Ch√≠nh (formerly dinh Ng√≥i), dinh M∆∞·ªùi (or dinh L∆∞u ƒê·ªìn), and dinh Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh (or dinh Tr·∫°m).Ch√¢u √î T·∫°p l·ª•c by L√™ Quy Don The province was established in 1831, with the part of ph·ªß Qu·∫£ng Ninh, then added ph·ªß Qu·∫£ng Tr·∫°ch. Under French colony (French Indochina, Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh was situated in Annam of French Indochina and ƒê·ªìng H·ªõi airbase in Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh was used by the French to attack the Vi·ªát Minh in north-central Vietnam and the Laotian Pathet army in north and south Laos. In 1954, the Geneva Accord was signed by France, Vietnam, and other parties involved. According to which, Vietnam was to be temporarily divided into 2 parts, with the 17th parallel as the boundary. North Vietnam was under the control of the Communist party while the South was an anti- communist and French collaborators control. A universal election was to be held in 1956 in order to determine the unification of Vietnam. However, in the South, Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám held a referendum, which determined the form of government for the South; consequently, leading to the foundation of the Republic of Vietnam. 50 km north of the 17th parallel, during the Vietnam War, Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh was the most heavily bombed province by U.S. B-52s due to its location. In 1976, Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh, Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province, Th·ª´a Thi√™n Province Province were merged into B√¨nh Tr·ªã Thi√™n Province, in 1990 Binh Tri Thien Province was split into three provinces as they were before.

Early life William Frank Carver was born in Winslow, Illinois, to William Daniel Carver, a physician, and Deborah Tohapenes (Peters) Carver (1829‚Äì1907), who had migrated to Illinois from Pennsylvania in 1849. He had a younger brother, William Pitt, who became a farmer in Kansas, and a sister, May, who was born in May 1856 and died before the age of two. There seems to be no creditable information about Carver's childhood, as the contradictions in stories he told classify them as entertainment rather than fact. For most of his adult life Carver gave the year of his birth as 1840, but it is likely he did so in order to enlarge the time frame needed to create stories of frontier experience for his admiring audiences after he became a showman. Carver's biographer, Raymond Thorp, wrote that Carver left home at a young age to assert his family's right to land in Minnesota that the Sioux had supposedly granted his grandfather, Jonathan Carver, and that during this period of time he lived with the Santee Sioux. This contention, however, like other claims made by Carver about his early life and never investigated by his biographer, does not withstand the scrutiny of reputable historians. A plainsman Carver was trained as a dentist and hence acquired the nickname \\"Doc\\". He migrated to the West in 1872, where he practiced dentistry at Fort McPherson, Nebraska, and North Platte, Nebraska. He later attempted to distance himself from his early profession as a dentist, but the name \\"Doc\\" clung for life. At Fort McPherson he met Buffalo Bill Cody, Texas Jack Omohundro, and other well-known figures of the day. In November 1872 he moved to the newly organized Frontier County, Nebraska, in the company of Ena Raymonde, a southern belle from Georgia, whose brother W. H. \\"Paddy\\" Miles had recently established a trapper's camp known as Wolf's Rest on Medicine Creek. Carver took a claim near Wolf's Rest, and it was here that he began to acquire the target shooting, horseback riding, and hunting skills that would lead to his later success as a world-class marksman. Raymonde, a recognized markswoman, who had been challenged to shoot by Buffalo Bill Cody and Texas Jack Omohundro, is credited with playing a part in teaching Carver to shoot. An entry from Raymonde's 1872 journal reveals insights into Carver as a young man and also portrays the prevailing enthusiasm for shooting sports in the 19th century: \\"Sunday afternoon we all‚Ä¶went to see a prairie-dog town! We went at half-speed or better all the way. Shot about 200 rounds; the Dr. doing the most of the business of shooting if not killing...\\"Journals of Ena Raymonde, Nebraska State Historical Society, MS1730, cited in Smith, Medicine Creek Journals. Although Carver's time as a plainsman was short, he was on the western Nebraska frontier during an exciting era. Conflict between whites and Native Americans in the immediate area was decreasing but not eliminated. A remnant band of Lakota Sioux known as the Cut-off Sioux was encamped on Medicine Creek several miles to the east of Carver's cabin, and although his claim of having killed the Cut-offs' old war chief Whistler and two of his braves in late 1872 does not conform to the evidence, Carver was certainly in the area during a time of potential and sometimes real hostilities between whites and Native Americans. It was a common practice during the late 19th century for well-heeled men, from the East and from abroad, to travel to the West to engage in hunting expeditions, and Carver undoubtedly had the opportunity to participate in several of these hunts. Buffalo Bill Cody wrote in his 1879 autobiography that Carver, who, in Cody's words, \\"has recently acquired considerable notoriety as a rifle-shot,\\" had joined a hunt at which Cody had been engaged as a guide by the Englishman Thomas P. Medley. Late in 1874 Carver spent two weeks practicing dentistry at Fort Sidney, after which he moved to Cheyenne, Wyoming, where he continued working as a dentist. Shooting career Carver in 1883, displaying the medals he earned as a sharpshooter Carver migrated to California in 1876, where he honed his shooting skills. At about this time he coined the moniker \\"Evil Spirit,\\" accompanied by a \\"camp-fire tale\\" that the name had been given to him by Spotted Tail, the famous chief of the Brul√© Lakota, because Carver had felled a rare white buffalo. In December 1877 the Evil Spirit issued a challenge to all comers; he would use a rifle and the challenger could use a shotgun, and the targets would be glass balls thrown from the newly invented Bogardus glass ball trap. He also contended that he could hit more targets from horseback than a challenger could hit while standing on the ground. One of the first significant awards Carver won was for breaking 885 glass balls out of 1000 in San Francisco on February 22, 1878. The gold badge was capped with the image of a grizzly bear and bore an inscription that proclaimed Dr. W. F. Carver the \\"Champion Rifle Shot of the World.\\" Following his success in California, Carver recruited Texas Jack Omohundro, and the pair went on tour giving exhibitions of shooting prowess, with Carver demonstrating his expertise with the rifle while Omohundro displayed his proficiency with the pistol. These demonstrations included endurance contests as well as target competitions. An article in the New York Times on July 6, 1878, illustrates the reception Carver received:An advertisement for a shooting exhibition by Doc Carver and Texas Jack Omohundro. > Dr. W. F. Carver, the man who can put a bullet through a silver quarter > while the coin is flying through the air, is an enlarged and revised edition > of Buffalo Bill and Texas Jack.

Carver also joined the ranks of western figures that embellished their frontier credentials by writing books. In 1878 he published a book, Life of Dr. Wm. F. Carver of California: Champion Rifle Shot of the World, which contains entirely fictional versions of his early life but also includes extracts from the press coverage of his first shooting tour across the country. On August 20, 1878, while in New Haven, Connecticut, Carver married Josephine Dailey, whom he had met on a previous trip. Little is known about the marriage, as Carver's biographer mentions Josephine only in several brief references describing the first few years following the marriage. It appears she was a marginal presence in Carver's life throughout his early years as a showman, and apparently they later separated. It is known that the Carvers had two children, Al and Lorena, both of whom were eventually involved in their father's diving horse act. Carver versus Bogardus Almost from the beginning of his shooting career, Carver issued challenges to Captain Adam Henry Bogardus, who was recognized across the country and around the world as the champion trap shooter. Bogardus was Carver's senior by seventeen years, however, and had little to gain and much to lose by accepting a challenge from the newcomer. In 1879 Carver set sail for a tour of Europe, where he shot in numerous exhibitions and matches, using shotgun, rifle, and pistol and shooting from horseback or from foot. He performed for ordinary citizens and for nobility, the most notable being the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII). He traveled to France, Belgium, Germany, and Austria, but most of the tour was in the British Isles, where he was booked for a long-term engagement at the Crystal Palace, in the wealthy Sydenham Hill district of London. Regardless of the considerable success he was having in Europe, the desire to stage a match with the great Bogardus was ever-present. So anxious was Carver to shoot against Bogardus that in 1881, in a challenge printed in the London Sportsman, he offered to pay $250 toward expenses if Bogardus would travel to London for a match. Bogardus ignored this challenge. Carver returned to the United States in the fall of 1882 and again threw down the gauntlet. Early in 1883 Bogardus finally agreed to a live pigeon shoot in Louisville, Kentucky. The proposed match created much excitement in the shooting world, and a crowd of nearly 1000 gathered to watch two of the world's finest shooters compete. The Louisville Commercial ran the following article on February 21, 1883: > Captain A. H. Bogardus, the champion shot, arrived in the city yesterday > morning, and immediately repaired to the Louisville Hotel, where his rival, > Dr. Carver is stopping. Neither of them \\"recognized\\" the other, although > they met several times during the morning and dined at adjoining tables. > Captain Bogardus remarked to a friend in a fatherly way that the \\"young 'un\\" > seemed to be in fine form, and Dr. Carver was overheard saying as he blushed > before a plate of potato salad, that \\"the old man was looking pretty well > himself.\\" Once or twice they glared politely at each other, and the scene > was rather amusing. Captain Bogardus would transfix a baked apple with his > fork, and then cast a quick glance at Carver, who at that moment was sipping > his ox-tail soup, timidly eyeing the Captain over the rim of the bowl.The > Louisville Commercial, February 21, 1883, cited by Thorp, p. 131. Carver won the match 83 to 82, giving Bogardus the nudge needed to issue a challenge for further matches. In Chicago, Illinois, they shot two matches, one at live birds and one at clay pigeons, Carver winning both matches. From there they traveled to St. Louis, Missouri, where they found a message waiting for them from the Ligowsky Clay Pigeon Company. If they used Ligowsky's clay pigeons, the company would award a $7500 purse for the series of 25 matches. The match using clay pigeons that they had already shot in Chicago was counted as one match, another match was shot while they were in St. Louis, and from there they traveled to 23 more cities. Carver won 19 of the 25 matches and secured his position as one of the world's best marksmen. Wild West show About this same time, Carver went into partnership with Buffalo Bill Cody to put a Wild West show on the road. The grand opening of the \\"Wild West: Hon. W. F. Cody and Dr. W. F. Carver's Rocky Mountain and Prairie Exhibition\\" was in Omaha, Nebraska, on May 17, 1883. Their series of shooting matches completed, both Carver and Bogardus joined the show in Omaha. The show was an immediate success, but the relationship between the two showmen, Carver and Cody, was contentious from the beginning. At the end of the season they parted ways and divided the assets by the flip of a coin. Cody then formed a partnership with the promoter and showman Nate Salsbury, and the show continued as Buffalo Bill's Wild West. Carver put his own show on tour, also billed as the Wild West. As the two shows crisscrossed the country for the next few years, Carver and Cody engaged in legal wrangling over various issues. The foremost points of dispute were the use of the name Wild West and Carver's assertion that Cody still owed him $27,000, which Carver claimed he had invested in the original show. In July 1885 both shows were in Connecticut, and the New York Times reported that \\"An interminable row has broken out in this State between Dr. Carver, the marksman, and Buffalo Bill. They have been running rival shows under the same title of 'Wild West'.\\"New York Times, July 16, 1885, cited by Smith (2009), p. 167. A trial, intended to end the suits and countersuits, was set for July 20, 1885. Cody failed to appear, however, so Carver agreed to dismiss his suit for $10,000 cash and Salsbury's offer to pay the court costs. Carver and Cody, once friends, remained bitter enemies for the rest of their lives. His show broken up, Carver did not have the financial resources to reorganize. For the next few years he appeared as a featured act in several outdoor shows. By 1889 he had secured financial partners and organized his own show, Wild America. Carver launched a worldwide tour, covering much of the same circuit as Cody, but the two shows avoided each other until August 1890, when Carver's show arrived in Hamburg, Germany, ahead of Cody's. Carver's claim to exclusive use of the available electric lights left Cody's show in the dark and added further hostility to the fierce competition between the two showmen. In December 1890 Carver shipped the Wild America troupe to Australia, where it was received with enthusiasm. In conjunction with the outdoor exhibition, Carver had added a dramatic play, and on his return to the United States in early 1892 launched a tour of both productions across the country. An economic depression, however, had spread across the country by the early 1890s. In addition, a number of similar shows were touring the country, and they were no longer an entertainment novelty. For these and other reasons, Carver's show disbanded sometime in 1893. Carver had continued to give shooting exhibitions and to challenge competitors while on tour in the United States and abroad. After seventeen years as the \\"Champion Shot of the World\\" Carver gave one of his last public exhibitions in Lincoln, Nebraska, in 1896. Noting that Carver refused to tell his age but looked fifteen years younger than his stated age, the State Journal reported that \\"Dr. W. F. Carver, the champion shot of the world, has been giving exhibitions of his wonderful skill in rifle, shotgun and horseback shooting this week at Lincoln park that mystified, surprised and astonished the audience present.\\"State Journal (Lincoln, Nebraska), August 29, 1896, cited by Smith (2009), pp. 171‚Äì172. Diving horses Carver in later life After the breakup of his show Carver put together a smaller show, which featured trained animals and shooting exhibitions. His biographer wrote that Carver added the diving horse act to the show in Kansas City, Missouri, in August 1894. Carver told several versions of a story describing an exciting escape from bandits, which inspired the diving horse act, but those who remembered him in Nebraska said he got the idea after plunging on horseback off a bank into a deep hole in Medicine Creek. Over the next few years the other acts were eliminated, and the diving horse exhibition became Carver's primary endeavor. Included in the touring company were his son, Al, who helped train and take care of the horses, and his daughter, Lorena, said to be the first rider. By the time his future daughter-in-law, Sonora Webster, joined the show in 1924, Carver had two diving teams on the road, each performing in a different city. In June 1927, Carver attended an Old-Timers' Convention in Norfolk, Nebraska, where he enjoyed reuniting with other frontiersmen. Following the convention he traveled to Omaha, Nebraska, and while there received word that his favorite horse had drowned following a dive into the Pacific Ocean. Sonora later wrote that the loss of the horse coupled with failing health seemed to diminish Carver's desire to live. He died on August 31, 1927, in Sacramento, California, and was buried beside his mother and sister in Winslow, Illinois. Sonora remembered that Carver was a stern and taciturn man but loved his horses and insisted that they be given the best of care. Following Carver's death, the diving horse show continued with Al Carver at the helm. In October 1928 Al Carver and Sonora Webster were married. A short time later he signed a contract for a season's engagement at Atlantic City's Steel Pier, and the diving horse act became a permanent fixture there for several years. Sonora Webster Carver lost her eyesight in 1931 when her horse \\"Red Lips\\" dove into the tank off-balance, causing her to hit the water face first. She failed to close her eyes quickly enough, resulting in detached retinas. Though now blinded, Sonora continued with the act for eleven years. Her younger sister, Arnette Webster (later French), had joined the show in 1930 and started diving in 1931. Al and Sonora Carver retired in 1942. The act finally closed as a result of pressure from animal rights groups in the 1970s. Sonora Carver, however, always contended that the horses were never forced to dive and, in fact, enjoyed the act. She died in September 2003, at the age of 99. Her early career inspired the 1991 Disney movie Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken, starring Gabrielle Anwar and based on Carver's memoir, A Girl and Five Brave Horses.

Properties * \\\\mathcal{K}_r(A,b),A\\\\mathcal{K}_r(A,b)\\\\subset \\\\mathcal{K}_{r+1}(A,b). * Vectors { b, Ab, A^2b, \\\\ldots, A^{r-1}b } are linearly independent until r, and \\\\mathcal{K}_r(A,b) \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{K}_{r_0}(A,b). r_0 is the maximal dimension of a Krylov subspace. * For such r_0 we have r_0\\\\leq 1 + \\\\mathrm{rank} A and r_0 \\\\leq n, more exactly r_0\\\\leq \\\\partial p(A), where p(A) is the minimal polynomial of A. * There exists a b such that r_0 = \\\\partial p(A). * \\\\mathcal{K}_r(A,b) is a cyclic submodule generated by b of the torsion k[x]-module (k^n)^A, where k^n is the linear space on k. * k^n can be decomposed as the direct sum of Krylov subspaces. Use Krylov subspaces are used in algorithms for finding approximate solutions to high-dimensional linear algebra problems. Modern iterative methods for finding one (or a few) eigenvalues of large sparse matrices or solving large systems of linear equations avoid matrix-matrix operations, but rather multiply vectors by the matrix and work with the resulting vectors. Starting with a vector, b, one computes A b, then one multiplies that vector by A to find A^2 b and so on. All algorithms that work this way are referred to as Krylov subspace methods; they are among the most successful methods currently available in numerical linear algebra. Issues Because the vectors usually soon become almost linearly dependent due to the properties of power iteration, methods relying on Krylov subspace frequently involve some orthogonalization scheme, such as Lanczos iteration for Hermitian matrices or Arnoldi iteration for more general matrices. Existing methods The best known Krylov subspace methods are the Arnoldi, Lanczos, Conjugate gradient, IDR(s) (Induced dimension reduction), GMRES (generalized minimum residual), BiCGSTAB (biconjugate gradient stabilized), QMR (quasi minimal residual), TFQMR (transpose-free QMR), and MINRES (minimal residual) methods.

History The company began in 1887, when brothers John Bayne Maclean and Hugh Cameron Maclean launched their first trade publication, Canadian Grocer & General Storekeeper. Hugh left the company in 1899 and later return to Toronto to establish his own publication firm. John subsequently expanded his company into other areas of publishing, launching the general interest magazine Maclean's in 1905, the business newspaper Financial Post in 1907, the lifestyle magazine Canadian Homes and Gardens in 1925, the women's magazine Chatelaine in 1928, and its French-language counterpart, Ch√¢telaine in 1960. Horace Talmadge Hunter joined Maclean Publishing in 1903, moving up the management ranks from general manager in 1911 to succeed John Bayne Maclean as president in 1933; in 1945 the company's name was changed to Maclean-Hunter. Hunter retired in 1952 and died in 1961. Hunter's son Donald Fleming later became president and chairman of M-H. In 1961, the company began to diversify, adding its first broadcasting asset, radio station CFCO in Chatham, Ontario. In 1968 Maclean-Hunter Publishing Company Limited was renamed to Maclean-Hunter Limited and finally as Maclean Hunter Limited in 1981. In the 1970s, M-H merged its Le Maclean French- language magazine with Actualit√©, and began publishing L'actualit√©. In 1982, the company acquired a controlling interest in Sun Media; ownership of the Financial Post was transferred to Sun Media in 1987 to facilitate the publication's expansion from a weekly to a daily newspaper. By the early 1990s, Maclean-Hunter's assets also included cable television services in 35 Ontario markets, 21 radio stations, television station CFCN in Calgary and a significant minority share in CTV. Maclean-Hunter was acquired in 1994 by Rogers Communications. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission approved the transaction, but required Rogers to divest itself of some of Maclean-Hunter's individual assets to alleviate concerns about concentration of media ownership. Shaw Communications acquired some of the cable holdings and radio stations, Telemedia and Blackburn Radio acquired other radio stations, and the consortium of Baton Broadcasting and Electrohome acquired CFCN and the CTV shares. Sun Media was sold in an employee buyout in 1996. Maclean-Hunter also had cable holdings in the United States, which were acquired by Comcast in 1994. Maclean-Hunter lives on in the publication Maclean's magazine. In 2016 L'Actualit√©. was sold to Mishmash (XPND Capital). The former assets of Maclean-Hunter were sold by Rogers to St. Joseph Communications in March 2019.https://www.msn.com/en- ca/money/topstories/rogers-media-sells-magazines-to-st-joseph/ar-BBV0qDX Operations Maclean-Hunter's main office was at College Park from the 1980s until its acquisition by Rogers in 1994. Its previous head office was in a series of buildings along the corner of Dundas Street and University Avenue. Maclean's magazine has since moved to Rogers Communications premises at 1 Mount Pleasant Road (Rogers Building). In 1948, M-H moved their printing plant at 210 Dundas Street West to North York (Highway 401-Yonge Street).http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2014/te/bgrd/backgroundfile-71601.pdf The large plant was built near the home of Robert Earl Bales, Reeve of North York. The plant was sold and demolished in 2001 for re-development as \\"Mansions of Avondale\\" condominiums and Avondale Park.

Leadership The military aspects of NPFL were led by Charles Taylor, a former government official who was being sought for trial on charges of corruption, the NPFL took up arms against the regime of Samuel Doe on 24 December 1989. Most NPFL fighters were originally drawn from the Gio and Mano ethnic groups of northern Liberia who were persecuted under Doe's regime. Ellen Johnson Sirleaf served as International Coordinator of the NPFL. Taylor and Tom Woewiyu were also in leadership positions. Martina Johnson was one of the NPFL commanders who is alleged to have ‚Äúparticipated directly in mutilation and mass killing in late 1992 during an NPFL offensive known as ‚ÄòOperation Octopus‚Äô. Support Popular support within Liberia helped the group grow from an initial force numbering in the low hundreds to a large irregular army which occupied around 80% of the country in less than a year. NPFL efforts to capture the capital city of Monrovia were thwarted by the arrival of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) cease-fire monitoring group, ECOMOG. They instead set up in 1991 an alternative national administration (the National Patriotic Reconstruction Assembly Government - NPRAG) based in the Bong County town of Gbarnga. Taylor's authority as self- proclaimed head of the NPRAG was, however, challenged by a breakaway faction, known as the Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia (INPFL), led by Prince Yormie Johnson, whose troops, estimated to number less than 500, rapidly gained control of parts of central Monrovia. Operation Octopus In late 1992, the NPFL launched \\"Operation Octopus\\" which was repulsed by combined ECOMOG, Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) and United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy (ULIMO) forces. Another NPFL breakaway group, the National Patriotic Front of Liberia-Central Revolutionary Council (NPFL-CRC), emerged in mid-1994. Prominent figures in the faction were Sam Dokie and Tom Woewiyu, a defense chief in Taylor's alternative government. Both men cited strategic and ideological differences as the cause of their defection. Following negotiations, rebel group members occupied positions in the transitional government, but fighting continued well into early 1996. The warring factions signed the ECOWAS-mediated Abuja Accord supplement on 17 August 1996, resulting in an immediate cessation of military hostilities. Membership The NPFL was estimated to have around 25,000 combatants and has orchestrated a wide range of human rights abuses including massacres, torture, kidnapping and a number of political assassinations. In addition to the war in Liberia, the rebel group sponsored Revolutionary United Front (RUF) subversion against the military government in Sierra Leone, partly as a strategy to gain control of the local trade in diamonds. Political aspirations In preparation for upcoming elections that would take place in 1997, the NPFL reorganized itself into a civilian political party known as the National Patriotic Party (NPP). Charles Taylor and the NPP won the 19 July 1997 election with a substantial majority. While international observers deemed the polls administratively free and transparent, they noted that it had taken place in an atmosphere of intimidation because most voters believed that Taylor would resume the war if defeated.

It has a population of 1,147,000 and spans an area of 5,197 km¬≤. Its capital is Nha Trang. Kh√°nh H√≤a is the site of B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i's summer home, the Pasteur Institute of Nha Trang, the Institute of Oceanography, the Institute of Vaccines and Biological Substances, and was headquarters of the US Army's Special Forces (\\"the Green Berets\\") during the Vietnam War in the late 1950s and 1960s. Cam Ranh Bay port is on land closest to a deep sea drop in Vietnam - the best site for submarine bases in Vietnam. An ancient temple of Champa is on the north side of Nha Trang. History The site of what is now Kh√°nh H√≤a had been within the territory of the Champa Kingdom before it was annexed to ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát's (Vietnam's) territory. In 1653, one of the Nguy·ªÖn lords, Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c T·∫ßn, sent his troops to occupy Phan Rang. The Champa king B√† T·∫•m surrendered to Nguy·ªÖn's troops and ceded an area from the east of the Phan Rang River to Ph√∫ Y√™n to the Nguy·ªÖn lord. The Nguy·ªÖn lord accepted the ceded territory and set up the Th√°i Khang garrison and divided it into two districts: Th√°i Khang and Di√™n Ninh. In 1832, under the rule of emperor Minh M·∫°ng, this area was renamed Kh√°nh H√≤a and was divided into two districts, Ph·ªß Di√™n Kh√°nh and Ph·ªß Ninh H√≤a, which between them had a total of four counties: Ph∆∞·ªõc ƒêi·ªÅn and Vƒ©nh X∆∞∆°ng counties; and Qu·∫£ng Ph∆∞·ªõc and T√¢n ƒê·ªãnh counties, respectively. Under French Indochina, the provincial capital was located in Di√™n Kh√°nh Citadel, but it was relocated to Nha Trang in 1945. During the Vietnam War, Kh√°nh H√≤a was a hub of military activity for the Republic of Vietnam army (ARVN), the Republic of Vietnam Navy, the Republic of Vietnam Air Force, and for the U.S. Pacific Air Forces (USAF), particularly in Cam Ranh Bay and at the Nha Trang Air Base. The II Corp. headquarters was located in Nha Trang and populated by general and field officers, intelligence groups and ARVN liaisons. After the communists' victory and the Fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975, the communist regime merged two provinces, Ph√∫ Y√™n and Kh√°nh H√≤a, into Ph√∫ Kh√°nh Province on 29 October 1975. In 1977, Nha Trang was upgraded to city status. In 1982, the National Assembly decided to incorporate the Spratly Islands into Ph√∫ Kh√°nh Province. On June 30, 1989, the National Assembly reversed its previous decision and split Ph√∫ Kh√°nh Province into two provinces as they were before. Geography and climate Ba H·ªì stream in Kh√°nh H√≤a province Kh√°nh H√≤a Province has an area of 5,197 km¬≤. Its geographical coordinates are 108¬∞40‚Äô33\\" to 109¬∞27‚Äô55\\" E and 11¬∞42‚Äô50\\" to 12¬∞52‚Äô15\\" N. The provincial coastline spreads from ƒê·∫°i L√£nh Commune to the end of Cam Ranh Bay with 385 km of coastline featuring numerous creek mouths, lagoons, river mouths, and hundreds of islands and islets. The province also administers large territorial waters. The Spratly Islands are part of the province's Tr∆∞·ªùng Sa District. The coastline is indented by several bays, most notably the four bays of V√¢n Phong Bay, Nha Phu Bay, Nha Trang Bay (C√π Hu√¢n) and Cam Ranh Bay, of which Cam Ranh Bay with an area of around 200 km¬≤, encompassed by a mountain range, is regarded as one of the three best natural seaports in the world. Cam Ranh Bay is strategically important and has been used as a naval base by several major powers throughout history. H√≤n ƒê√¥i Cliff (M≈©i H√≤n ƒê√¥i) on the H√≤n G·ªëm Peninsula in V·∫°n Ninh District is the easternmost tip of Vietnam's mainland. The province is mostly mountainous. The highest peak is V·ªçng Phu Mountain (2051m) at the border of ƒê·∫Øk L·∫Øk Province.Atlat ƒë·ªãa l√≠ Vi·ªát Nam : d√πng trong c√°c tr∆∞·ªùng ph·ªï th√¥ng (Geographical Atlas of Vietnam). NXB Giao Duc, Hanoi: 2010 The only large lowland area is located around Ninh H√≤a in the north of the province. Partly as a result of this, not much land is available for agriculture. 87,100ha or 16.7% of Kh√°nh H√≤a's total area are used for farming, one of the lowest shares in the South Central Coast.General Statistics Office (2009): Socio-economic Statistical Data of 63 Provinces and Cities, Vietnam. Statistical Publishing House, Hanoi Forests cover more than half of the province's area. The province enjoys a mild climate with an average annual temperature of 26.7¬∞C. There are two distinct seasons: the rainy season lasts from April to December, with the other months being the dry season, except in Nha Trang where the rainy season lasts for just two months. The average relative humidity is 80.5%. The climate on the summit of H√≤n B√† Mountain (located 30 km from Nha Trang) features a climate like that of ƒê√† L·∫°t and Sa Pa. Demographics , the province had a population of 1.147 million, of which the majority are Kinh or Vietnamese people, the dominant ethnic group in Vietnam. Minority groups dwelling in the province are the Cham, Raglai people, the \\"Overseas Chinese\\" Hoa people, and the Austroasiatic-speaking Koho people. Kh√°nh H√≤a had an urban population of 466,500 people or 40.7% of the total in 2007, making it the most urbanized province of the South Central Coast. The average population growth per year between 2000 and 2007 was 1.26%, close to the average of the region. Growth was particularly strong in urban areas (2.24%).calculations based on General Statistics Office (2009): Socio- economical Statistical Data of 63 Provinces and Cities. Statistical Publishing House, Hanoi Administrative divisions Kh√°nh H√≤a is subdivided into nine district-level sub-divisions: * 6 districts: ** Cam L√¢m ** Di√™n Kh√°nh ** Kh√°nh S∆°n ** Kh√°nh Vƒ©nh ** Tr∆∞·ªùng Sa (also known as the Spratly Islands) ** V·∫°n Ninh * 1 district-level town: ** Ninh H√≤a (recently upgraded from district status) * 2 provincial cities: ** Cam Ranh ** Nha Trang (capital) They are further subdivided into six commune-level towns (or townlets), 99 communes, and 35 wards. Economy With a GDP per capita of 16.1 million VND (2007), Kh√°nh H√≤a is economically the most developed province of central Vietnam (after Da Nang). It has a relatively small agricultural sector, but strong industry and services. The province is endowed with beautiful natural landscapes and beaches, which (together with its Cham heritage) attracts a large number of tourists. Kh√°nh H√≤a has had a significant trade surplus in recent years, with exports in 2007 of US$503.3 million and imports of US$222.5 million. =Agriculture, forestry, fishing= Given its lack of flat land, Kh√°nh H√≤a has a relatively small agricultural sector. Rice harvests are among the lowest in the South Central Coast with 188,500t in 2007. However, its output of sugar cane (738,200t in 2007, 4.25% of the national figure) and cashew nuts (5,238t, 1.74%) are more significant. Kh√°nh H√≤a is one of the few provinces with a higher gross output in fishing than in agriculture. This is mostly due to the large number of aquaculture farms in the province, which make up around two thirds of the fishing output. =Industry= Nha Trang is the South Central Coast's second largest industrial center and the province in general accounts for more than one fifth of the region's industrial GDP. Food processing industries are large, especially those processing local fishing products and food for shrimp farms. Other industrial sectors produce beverages, fabric, textiles, paper, and construction materials. Industrial production is not only in and around Nha Trang. The province has also benefited significantly from investment related to the former Russian naval base at Cam Ranh, to which around 30 factories were attached. A major new industrial center is being developed in the north of the province around V√¢n Phong Port (V√¢n Phong Economic Zone). Infrastructure Kh√°nh H√≤a is located along Vietnam's main north-south transport corridors. National Road 1A and the North‚ÄìSouth Railway run through the province.Vietnam Road Atlas (T·∫≠p B·∫£n ƒë·ªì Giao th√¥ng ƒê∆∞·ªùng b·ªô Vi·ªát Nam). Cartographic Publishing House (Vietnam), 2004 All Reunification Express trains as well as some local trains stop at Nha Trang Railway Station. As a coastal province featuring several natural deep water bays, Kh√°nh H√≤a has what is needed to develop its deep-water seaports. Nha Trang Port (a tourist and cargo port) and D·ªëc L·∫øt Port (a shipbuilding and logistics port) are now in use. V√¢n Phong Port, a megaproject intended to be developed in V√¢n Phong Bay by a consortium of Japanese corporations (with Sumitomo as the leading investor) with an estimated investment of US$15 billion, is in progress. On completion, this deep sea port will be capable of handling ships up to 100,000 tonnes and 100 million tonnes of loaded/unloaded cargo per annum. Cam Ranh International Airport is located in the south of the province and is one of Vietnam's busiest airports. Education Kh√°nh H√≤a is one of the most important educational centers in Vietnam. It is home to Nha Trang University (formerly Nha Trang Fishery University), a multidisciplinary university; the Naval Academy; the Air Force Officer Academy; a Normal College; a Kindergarten Teacher's Training College; and an Arts and Tourism College.

In 1876, Motte took on as business partner his store's supervisor, Joseph Specht. The two added clothing to their wares, and presently moved the store to 703‚Äì705 Franklin, where it was listed in the city directory as Famous, Motte & Specht.

Sometime later, he acquired William Barr Dry Goods Co. In 1911, he merged the two to create Famous-Barr. In 1914, he opened a new Famous-Barr department store in downtown St. Louis, the first air-conditioned department store in the country. On October 8, 1948, Famous-Barr opened its first branch store in Clayton, Missouri at the intersection of Forsyth and Jackson.http://www.claytonhistorysociety.org/famousbarr.html In 1955, Famous- Barr opened another branch store, at the Northland Shopping Center in Jennings ‚Äî a mall owned by Famous-Barr's corporate parent, the May Companies. In 1991, it took operational control of the L.S. Ayres division in Indiana, and in 1998 took on The Jones Store in Kansas City when May acquired that chain in the aftermath of the Dillard's acquisition of Mercantile Stores Co. Both chains retained their names, but shut down their headquarters. The Famous-Barr name was retired on September 9, 2006, when Federated converted most of Macy's regional department stores to the Macy's nameplate, with the exception of the Eastland Mall store in Evansville Indiana. The Eastland Mall store closed and became Dillard's instead due to the existing Lazarus store which already became Macy's in 2005. The downtown St. Louis store and headquarters were first shrunk and then closed in summer 2013; the remaining retail employees moved to other stores, while the headquarters staff moved to Earth City.

It is grown on 1,300 ha (as of 2007) in the central part of the province west and north-east of Phan Rang with an output of 3,300 t, or 10.3% of Vietnam's total output. The province also harvested 200 t in 2007, 1.2% of the national total. Other less significant crops include cashew nuts, sugar-cane, peanuts, and coconuts. Despite the large forests of the province, there is little commercial use of forest resources. Gross output of the forestry sector was 23.7 billion VND, accounting for only 1.8% of the South Central Coast, and therefore even less than Da Nang. Much of the province's forests are protected as part of N√∫i Ch√∫a National Park and Ph∆∞·ªõc B√¨nh National Park. These National Parks as well as the nearby V·ªãnh Vƒ©nh Hy attracted the building of Amanoi, a five star franchise hotel belonging to Aman Resorts. Ninh Thu·∫≠n's fishing gross output was 1138.8 billion VND in 2007, 1.3% of Vietnam's output and therefore more significant in a national context than agriculture. It has grown at an average of 11.7%, far exceeding agricultural growth and making it one of the fastest growing sectors of the economy. As of 2007, there were 589 offshore fishing vessels registered in the province. =Industry= Ninh Thu·∫≠n has a very small industrial sector, with a gross output accounting for only 2% of the South Central Coast's total. Industry contributes 1.3 million VND to the GDP per capita, compared to an average of 4.4 million VND for the region. The province's industrial products are mostly basic processed food and seafood products (frozen aquatic products, fish sauce, shelled cashew nuts) and processed raw materials (stones, bricks, salt). However, the industrial sector's growth of 16.4% has enabled it to absorb much of Ninh Thu·∫≠n's labor force growth by increasing industrial employment from 14,900 in 2000 to 43,700 in 2007 - although this employment growth has been overshadowed by the service sector, which created 57,300 additional jobs in the same period despite its slower growth. Infrastructure =Transport= Ninh Thu·∫≠n is located along Vietnam's main north-south corridors. National Route 1A as well as the North‚ÄìSouth Railway run through the province. Ninh Thu·∫≠n's main railway station is at Th√°p Ch√†m. There are also two smaller railway station: B√† R√¢u in Thu·∫≠n B·∫Øc District in the north and C√† N√° near the southern border. Phan Rang is connected to Da Lat by National Road 27 via Ngoan Muc Pass. There used to be a railway serving the same route, but it has not been in use since the start of the Vietnam War. Ninh Thu·∫≠n has three ports: * at V·ªãnh Vƒ©nh Hy in northeastern Ninh H·∫£i District * Ninh Chu Port in southern Ninh H·∫£i District near Phan Rang * C√† N√° Port in the south of the province The nearest commercial airport is Cam Ranh International Airport. =Energy= Da Nhim hydro-power plant is located in Ninh S∆°n District in the northwest of Ninh Thu·∫≠n. Ninh Thu·∫≠n was chosen as the site for some of Vietnam's future electricity projects that are part of Vietnam Electricity's diversification away from hydro-power. The country's first nuclear power plant is under construction in the south of the province. A second nuclear power project is being prepared with Japanese partners and will also be in Ninh Thu·∫≠n. Construction of a 200 MW wind power plant has also started and is planned to be completed by 2012.

Suzuki received his Ph.D in 1952 from the University of Tokyo, despite having moved to the United States the previous year. He was the first to attack the Burnside conjecture, that every finite non-abelian simple group has even order. A notable achievement was his discovery in 1960 of the Suzuki groups, an infinite family of the only non-abelian simple groups whose order is not divisible by 3. The smallest, of order 29120, was the first simple group of order less than 1 million to be discovered since Dickson's list of 1900. He classified several classes of simple groups of small rank, including the CIT- groups and C-groups and CA-groups. There is also a sporadic simple group called the Suzuki group, which he announced in 1968. The Tits ovoid is also referred to as the Suzuki ovoid. He wrote several textbooks in Japanese.

The park is bounded by Southern Boulevard to the southwest, Webster Avenue to the northwest, Gun Hill Road to the north, Bronx Park East to the east, and East 180th Street to the south. With an area of , Bronx Park is the eighth-largest park in New York City. Founded in the late 1880s, Bronx Park is the location of the New York Botanical Garden and the Bronx Zoo, which respectively occupy much of the northern and southern portions of the park. Fordham Road runs east-west between the zoo and botanical garden, bisecting Bronx Park, while the Bronx River Parkway runs north-south near the eastern edge. The park is operated by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. History The land for Bronx Park was acquired with funds authorized by the 1884 New Parks Act, which was intended to preserve lands that would soon become part of New York City.* * Much of the land was acquired from Fordham University, which gave away the land on the condition that it be used as a zoo and botanical garden. Other sections were obtained from the family of Pierre Lorillard, who operated the Lorillard Snuff Mill in what is now the New York Botanical Garden within the northern section of Bronx Park. The snuff mill, a National Historic Landmark, still remains and is the oldest existing tobacco manufacturing building in the United States. and Land was also acquired from the Lydig family, another prominent local family, who had bought it from the DeLanceys, yet another local family. The original were acquired in 1888‚Äì1889. The northernmost were allocated in 1891 to the New York Botanical Society. Another were allocated in 1897 to the New York Zoological Society. An additional were acquired in 1906, at the southeast end of the park; this area is now known as Ranaqua, where the Parks headquarters is located.  Attractions and facilities  Much of Bronx Park is taken up by the Bronx Zoo and New York Botanical Garden, both of which are private entities. However, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks) still pays for some of the maintenance costs. According to NYC Parks, Bronx Park is , making it the third-largest park in the Bronx and the eighth- largest park in the city. However, another measurement in the Encyclopedia of New York City places the park as only being in area. As originally stipulated in the New Parks Act, Bronx Park is the center of a system of parks across the Bronx. Mosholu Parkway runs to Van Cortlandt Park in the northwest, while Pelham Parkway runs to Pelham Bay Park in the east, and Southern Boulevard/Crotona Parkway runs to Crotona Park in the south. The park is crossed by a road connecting Fordham Road to the west and Pelham Parkway to the east. Adjacent neighborhoods include Pelham Parkway to the east, West Farms to the south, and Belmont to the west. = Zoo and botanical garden = The New York Botanical Garden is located on the northern side of Bronx Park, west of the Bronx River Parkway. It was founded by the New York Botanical Society in 1891. The botanical garden covers 250 acres in total. Much of this is the former grounds of the Lorillard estate, although the garden also includes a parcel that was formerly the easternmost portion of the campus of St. John's College (now Fordham University). The Botanical Garden contains more than a million living plants on its grounds, as well as the LuEsther T. Mertz Library and the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory. Since 1967, the Botanical Garden has been a National Historic Landmark. The Bronx Zoo is located on the southern side of Bronx Park, west of the Bronx River Parkway. Founded by the New York Zoological Society, it first opened on November 8, 1899. The zoo covers , making it among the United States' largest urban zoos. The zoo contains about 4,000 animals from 600 species. The Bronx Zoo has several landmarked features, including the Rainey Memorial Gates at the Fordham Road entrance, which is a New York City designated landmark and a National Register of Historic Places listing. See also: = Other facilities = A bridge within the Bronx Zoo, in Bronx Park The eastern section of Bronx Park contains several recreational facilities that mainly serve the neighborhoods to its east. These include areas for baseball, basketball, bocce, football, handball, soccer, and tennis. There are also hiking trails, kayaking sites, playgrounds, a skate park, and spray showers. Of the seven playgrounds in Bronx Park, four are located on Bronx Park East or Bronx River Parkway: Ben Abrams Playground, Brady Playground, Waring Playground, and Rosewood Playground. The park also has three bicycle paths; the longest is a north-south path on Bronx River Parkway, but bikeways also run northwest along Mosholu Parkway and east along Pelham Parkway. The northern section of Bronx Park is classified by NYC Parks as a Forever Wild nature preserve. The preserve occupies and is permanently closed off to development. The preserve is mainly composed of a floodplain forest with eastern hemlock and hardwoods, through which several walking trails run. The forest is believed to be the only woodland in New York City that has never been cleared. In addition, there is another set of ballfields called the Allerton Avenue Ballfields adjacent to the preserve. The ballfields are named after Daniel Allerton, an early Bronx settler, and consist of three baseball fields and a comfort station. The Bronx Skate Park is located nearby on Bronx Park East between Allerton Avenue and Britton Street, near the northeast corner of Bronx Park. Two playgrounds, French Charley Playground and Frisch Field, are also adjacent to the northern section of Bronx Park. The southeast section, known as Ranaqua, is used as NYC Parks' Bronx headquarters. The name is an Algonquin (Delaware) word for \\"End Place\\", the original name of the peninsula that was sold in 1639 to the Bronx's namesake Jonas Bronck. The current brick buildings that comprise Ranaqua were built in the 1930s as part of a Works Progress Administration project. The southwest corner of Bronx Park contains River Park, a small park and playground that overlooks the Bronx River south of the zoo. The park is located just south of the 182nd Street Dam, a small cascade on the river.  Watercourses  River Park entrance = River = The main watercourse in Bronx Park is the Bronx River, which flows southward from Westchester County to the East River, running for through the park. The section of river within the park is for the most part a natural watercourse. The river hosts a diverse ecosystem with a hardwood swamp and floodplain forest composed of red maple trees. A number of tributaries run into the river from both the New York Botanical Garden and the Bronx Zoo. The river, once a heavily polluted waterway, was cleaned up in the late 20th century due to an effort led by the Bronx River Alliance. The Mitsubishi Riverwalk, a free public trail along the Bronx River that opened in 2004, runs along the eastern bank of the river within the Bronx Zoo's Boston Road parking lot. There are three waterfalls in Bronx Park. The first is a cascade near the Lorillard Snuff Mill. To the south is a waterfall of pink granite, about high, located slightly upstream of the Boston Road entrance to the zoo. At this location, there is a small island that splits the waterfall into two cascades. A third waterfall is the 182nd Street Dam near River Park. It was formerly used by the DeLancey family, which operated a farm in what is now the Wild Asia section of the Bronx Zoo, but now consists of a Fordham gneiss dam with a fish ladder. As such, the 182nd Street Dam was known as Delancey's Falls, and also as Lydig's Falls after another local family. = Lakes = Within Bronx Park, there are two large lakes of note along the Bronx River. South of Fordham Road, the river widens into a small lake called Lake Agassiz, which is fed by two streams within the zoo. The lake was described as being in the early 20th century, although in 1971, of Lake Agassiz were taken by land reclamation for a new bison \\"prairie\\" in the Bronx Zoo. A larger lake, the Bronx Lake, is located south of Lake Agassiz and stretches for nearly through the zoo. It was previously used for boating, and a 1912 New York Times article mentioned that over 46,000 people had used boats in the lake in 1911. The Bronx Lake used to have a boathouse north of the 182nd Street Dam, but it was demolished after the 1950s. In 1983, the JungleWorld exhibit in the Bronx Zoo was built atop the site of the boathouse. In addition, there are several ponds not connected to the river. Cope Lake, located near the Fordham Road entrance to the Bronx Zoo, is a pond that predates the zoo. In the mid-20th century it became used by pelicans. However, the pelicans were moved to an indoor exhibit inside the zoo in the 1990s. In 2009, the Center for Global Conservation opened on the lake. Another pond, Twin Lake, is located at the northern portion of Bronx Park, next to the Pfizer Lab in the New York Botanical Garden. The pond was formerly a public area, but is now part of the botanical garden.

By 1901, public education was institutionalized in the Philippines, with English serving as the medium of instruction. That year, around 600 educators in the S.S. Thomas (the \\"Thomasites\\") were tasked to replace the soldiers who had been serving as the first teachers. Outside the academe, the wide availability of reading materials, such as books and newspapers in English, helped Filipinos assimilate the language quickly. Today, 78.53% of the population can understand or speak English (see List of countries by English-speaking population). The Commonwealth Period The founding of Silliman University by Presbyterian missionaries and the Philippine Normal School (PNS) in 1901 and the University of the Philippines (U.P.) in 1908, as well as of English newspapers like the Daily Bulletin 1900, The Cablenews 1902, and the Philippines Free Press 1905, helped boost English usage. The first ten years of the century witnessed the first verse and prose efforts of Filipinos in student publications such as The Filipino Students‚Äô Magazine first issue, 1905, a short-lived quarterly published in Berkeley, California, by Filipino pensionados (or government scholars); the U.P. College Folio (first issue, 1910); The Coconut of the Manila High School (first issue, 1912); and The Torch of the PNS (first issue, 1913). However, the beginnings of anything resembling a professional market for writing in English would not be realized until the 1920s with the founding of other newspapers and magazines like the Philippines Herald in 1920, the Philippine Education Magazine in 1924 (renamed Philippine Magazine in 1928), and later the Manila Tribune, the Graphic, Woman's Outlook, and Woman's Home Journal. The publications helped introduce the reading public to the works of Paz Marquez Benitez, Jose Garcia Villa, Loreto Paras, Luis Dato, and Casiano Calalang, among others. Cash incentives were given to writers in 1921 when the Free Press started to pay for published contributions and awarded P1,000 for the best stories. The organization in 1925 of the Philippine Writers Association and in 1927 of the University of the Philippines National Writers Workshop, which put out the Literary Apprentice, also helped encourage literary production. In 1939, the Philippine Writers League was put up by politically conscious writers, intensifying their debate with those in the \\"art for art's sake\\" school of Villa. Among the significant publications of this fertile period were: * Filipino Poetry (1924) by Rodolfo Dato; *Manila A Collection of Verse (1926) by Luis Dato * English-German Anthology of Filipino Poets (1934) by Pablo Laslo; * Jose Garcia Villa's Many Voices (1939) and Poems of Doveglion (1941); * Poems (1940) by Angela Manalang-Gloria; * Chorus for America: Six Philippine Poets (1942) by Carlos Bulosan; * Zoilo Galang's A Child of Sorrow (1921), the first Filipino novel in English, and Box of Ashes and Other Stories (1925), the first collection of stories in book form; * Villa‚Äôs Footnote to Youth: Tales of the Philippines and Others (1933); * \\"The Wound and the Scar\\" (1937) by Arturo Rotor, a collection of stories; * \\"Winds of April\\" (1940) by N. V. M. Gonzalez; * \\"His Native Soil\\" (1941) by Juan C. Laya; * Manuel Arguilla's \\"How My Brother Leon Brought Home a Wife and Other Stories\\" (1941); * Galang's \\"Life and Success\\" (1921), the first volume of essays in English; and * the influential \\"Literature and Society\\" (1940) by Salvador P. L√≥pez. Dramatic writing took a backseat due to the popularity of Filipino vaudeville (bodabil) and Tagalog movies, although it was kept alive by the playwright Wilfredo Ma. Guerrero. The post-war period During the Japanese occupation, when Tagalog was favored by the Japanese military authority, writing in English was consigned to limbo, since most of the English writers were forced to write in Tagalog or joined in the underground and wrote English stories based on the battles to serve as propaganda pieces in boosting the morale of the guerrillas. It picked up after the war, however, with a fervor and drive for excellence that continue to this day. Stevan Javellana's \\"Without Seeing the Dawn\\" (1947), the first postwar novel in English, was published in the United States. In 1946, the Barangay Writers Project was founded to help publish books in English.. Against a background marked by political unrest and government battles with Hukbalahap guerrillas, writers in English in the postwar period honed their sense of craft and techniques. Among the writers who came into their own during this time were, among many others: * Carlos Bulosan (1913‚Äì1956) * Linda Ty Casper (b. 1931) * Gilda Cordero-Fernando (b. 1932) * Amador Daguio * Ricaredo Serrano * N. V. M. Gonzalez (1915‚Äì1999) * Sinai C. Hamada * Alejandrino Hufana * Dominador Ilio * Nick Joaquin (1917‚Äì2004) * F.

Ingles * Oscar de Zu√±iga Fresh from studies in American universities, usually as Fulbright or Rockefeller scholars, a number of these writers introduced New Criticism to the country and applied its tenets in literature classes and writing workshops. In this way were born the Silliman National Writers Workshop. Literary awards and competitions In 1940, the first Commonwealth Literary Awards were given by President Manuel L. Quezon to Salvador P. Lopez for \\"Literature and Society\\" (essay), Manuel Arguilla for \\"How My Brother Leon Brought Home a Wife and Other Stories\\" (short story), R. Zulueta da Costa for \\"Like the Molave\\" (poetry), and Juan C. Laya for \\"His Native Soil\\" (novel). Government recognition of literary merit came in the form of the Republic Cultural Heritage Awards (1960), the Pro Patria Awards for Literature (1961), and the National Artist Awards (1973). Only the last of these three awards survives today. Writers in English who have received the National Artist award include: Jose Garcia Villa (1973), Nick Joaquin (1976), Carlos P. Romulo (1982), Francisco Arcellana (1990), N. V. M. Gonzalez, Rolando Tinio (1997), Edith L. Tiempo, (2000), F. Sionil Jos√© (2003), and Bienvenido Lumbera (2006). A select group of local writers have also received the international Magsaysay Award, namely, F. Sionil Jos√©, Nick Joaquin and Bienvenido Lumbera.

The flowers which bloom from April to June are borne singly on a tall stem with a whorl of small leaves just below the flower; the flower is 3‚Äì8 cm diameter, with 5‚Äì8 red (but may be white or blue) showy petal-like tepals and a black centre. The pollen is dry, has an unsculpted exine, is less than 40 nm in diameter, and is usually deposited within 1.5 m of its source. This central mound consists of tightly packed pistils in the centre, with a crown-like ring of stamens surrounding this, which gives the species its name. The flowers produce 200‚Äì300 seeds. The plants form hard black tubers as storage organs. Aside from its flowers resembling poppies, the red single wild form flowers resemble the flowers of the red single wild form of Ranunculus asiaticus. Taxonomy Within the genus Anemone, A. coronaria is placed within subgenus Anemone, section Anemone, subsection Anemone and is one of five species making up series Anemone, together with A. hortensis L., A. palmata L., A. pavonina Lam. and A. somaliensis Hepper. Within the series A. coronaria is sister to A. somaliensis. This series is a clade of Mediterranean tuberous anemones. It is also the type species for the subgenus. =Etymology= Anemone coronaria means crown anemone, referring to the central crown of the flower, evoking regal associations. The Arabic name is shaqa'iq An-Nu'man translated literally as the wounds, or \\"pieces\\", of Nu'man.Arabic-English lexicon, Volume 1, Part 4 By Edward William Lane, p. 1578, https://books.google.com/books?id=3p4OAAAAYAAJ&pg;=PA1578The poetics of anti- colonialism in the Arabic qa·π£ƒ´dah Hussein N. Kadhim, p. 158, https://books.google.com/books?id=80JtT6_MEmwC&pg;=PA158 One possible source of the name traces back to the Sumerian god of food and vegetation, Tammuz, whose Phoenician epithet was \\"Nea'man\\". Tammuz is generally considered to have been drawn into the Greek pantheon as Adonis, who died of his wounds while hunting wild boar. The deity is transformed into a flower, stained by the blood of Adonis. Tammuz's Phoenician epithet \\"Nea'man\\" is believed to be both the source of \\"an-Nu'man\\" in Arabic which came through Syriac, and of \\"anemone\\" which came through Greek. Another possible source of the name is An- Nu'man III Bin Al-Munthir, the last Lakhmid king of Al-Hirah (582-c.609 AD) and a Christian Arab. An-Nu'man is known to have protected the flowers during his reign. According to myth, the flower thrived on An-Nu'man's grave, paralleling the death and rebirth of Adonis. In Hebrew, the anemone is kalanit metzuya. \\"Kalanit\\" comes from the Hebrew word \\"kala ◊õ◊ú◊î\\" which means \\"bride\\", \\"metzuya\\" means \\"common.\\" The kalanit earned its name because of its beauty and majesty, evoking a bride on her wedding day.Anemone coronaria in WildFlowers.co.il (Hebrew). In 2013 Anemone coronaria was elected as the national flower of the State of Israel, in a poll arranged by the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel (◊î◊ó◊ë◊®◊î ◊ú◊î◊í◊†◊™ ◊î◊ò◊ë◊¢) and Ynet.◊î◊õ◊ú◊†◊ô◊™: ◊î◊ñ◊ï◊õ◊î ◊ë◊™◊ó◊®◊ï◊™ \\"◊î◊§◊®◊ó ◊©◊ú ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú\\", ynet, 25 November 2013. Each year in Israel there is a month-long festival to celebrate the blooming of the red anemones. During the British Mandate for Palestine, British paratroopers were nicknamed \\"kalaniyot\\" for their red berets. Distribution and habitat Eastern Mediterranean littoral, from Greece, Albania, southern Turkey and Syria to Israel with sporadic extension east to northern Iraq and west along the Mediterranean shores of Italy, southern France and North Africa. Anemone coronaria grows wild all over the regions of Syria and Palestine. Red carpet of flowers in Shokeda Forest, Israel, 2012. The vast red carpets of anemones have become a major tourist attraction of the northern Negev region of Israel in recent years Ecology In the wild, A. coronaria is winter flowering and cross pollinated by bees, flies and beetles, which can carry pollen over long distances. Cultivation Anemone coronaria was introduced into England prior to 1596, being described in Thomas Johnson's edition of John Gerard's Herball, first published in 1597 and was popular during the time of Queen Elizabeth I. By the beginning of the eighteenth century, breeders in France and Italy had already considerably improved the range of colours available. Anemone coronaria is widely grown for its decorative flowers, and has a hardiness of USDA zones 7‚Äì10, preferring full sun to part shade. Although perennial in its native climate, A. coronaria is usually grown as an annual in cooler climates, from tubers. Planting is usually in the autumn if kept in pots in a greenhouse through the winter or in the ground in spring once the risk of frost has passed. =Cultivars= Modern cultivars have very large flowers, with diameters of 8‚Äì10 cm and a wide range of bright and pastel colours, in addition to two toned varieties. The centre is usually black, but may be pale green in white varieties. Stems may be as tall as 40‚Äì50 cm, and each plant may produce 13‚Äì15 blooms. Numerous cultivars have been selected and named, the most popular including the De Caen (single) and St Brigid (semi-double and double) groups of cultivars. The De Caen group are hybrids cultivated in the districts of Caen and Bayeux in France in the 18th century, and include 'Bicolor' (red with white), 'Blue Poppy' (blue), 'Mr Fokker' (purple), 'Sylphide' (deep pink) and 'The Bride' (white). Referred to as poppy anemones because they closely resemble the true poppy (Papaveroideae). St. Brigid cultivars originated in Ireland, and named after that county's saint, they include 'Lord Lieutenant' (purple blue) and 'The Governor' (red). In addition to these large groups, there are two minor groups, Rissoana which is very rustic and early blooming (November) and Grassensis with large double flowers that bloom in the spring.

Penington married a widow named Mary Springett and they had five children. Penington's stepdaughter Gulielma Springett married William Penn. Convinced that the Quaker faith was true, Penington and his wife joined the Friends in 1657 or 1658. Penington became an influential promoter and defender of the Quaker movement, writing extensively on many topics. His writings are prized for their insightful and eloquent exploration of spiritual experience, with his Letters being read continuously within Quakerism for their spiritual counsel. His complete works were first published in 1681 and are still in print today.The Works of Isaac Penington Penington also published several books about the movement. He was imprisoned six times for his beliefs, starting in 1661. Sometimes the charge was refusal to take an oath, as this went against Quaker teachings (see Testimony of Integrity). Such action was prohibited by the Quaker Act of 1662, which sought to control members of the group. At other times Penington was charged with attending a Quaker meeting, which was forbidden by the Conventicle Act of 1664.

He earned a bronze medal in the 1992 Summer Olympics, 100 km team time trial.Olympic results In 1997 he won the Belgian classic Gent‚ÄìWevelgem and he was twice individual pursuit French national champion, in 2000 and 2002. In 2004, Gaumont quit professional cycling and later ran a caf√© in Amiens. Gaumont was well known for having confessed to extensive doping and explaining many tricks of the trade.Cyclists 'cheat dope tests' Gaumont gave a series of interviews, and wrote a book, Prisonnier du dopage (\\"Prisoner of doping\\") in which he explained doping methods, masking methods, the use of drug cocktails such as the pot belge for training and for recreation, and how the need to make money makes racers dope themselves. In April 2013 he suffered a major heart attack and was reported to be in a coma. On 13 May 2013, several news sources reported his death,Philippe Gaumont dies at 40 following heart attack but according to La Voix du Nord he remained in an artificial coma, though had suffered brain death. He died on 17 May 2013. Doping usage Gaumont began his professional career in 1994 in the Castorama team. In 1996 he joined the GAN team, and tested positive for nandrolone in two races. He joined Cofidis in 1997 and stayed there until the end of his career. In 1998 he tested positive twice for the nandrolone drug, but obtained that the case was dismissed. A year later a blood test conducted in the \\"Docteur Mabuse\\" justice case showed he was positive for amphetamines. In 2004, he was interrogated by French police and justice in the enquiry for the Cofidis doping case. He declared that he had repeatedly and consistently used doping products, including EPO, since the beginning of his professional career. He then said that he thought that 95% of professional racers doped themselves and expressed very strong doubts that a racer could win a major tour, such as the Tour de France, without doping. As a result of this case, he quit professional racing. Gaumont gave details in his book such as how to avoid being tested positive for corticoids: how, for instance, to irritate one's testicle sac using salt in order to provoke a rash and obtain a prescription for some corticoid cream. Since urine tests do not distinguish between (legal) corticoid applied as creams, with a prescription, and (illegal) injections, such prescriptions are used to mask doping.

The lock is set in a lock cut which is one of four streams here and it is surrounded by woods. On one side is Sashes Island and on the other is Mill Island connected to Formosa Island, the largest on the non-tidal Thames. There are several weirs nearby. Hedsor weir was placed across the old navigation channel in 1837, seven years after the lock was opened. There is a lower weir, and Odney weir is on the channel next to Formosa Island. A short distance away from the lock is Odney, with the Odney Club situated on an ait. Navigation to the Odney Club by boat is possible, but is extremely difficult due to the shallow waters. It is thought that this is deliberate - to disallow non-members from entering the club site without paying the entrance fees. History The navigation route was formerly down Hedsor Water and the only weir was associated with the mill. After the building of Marlow Lock in 1773 there were problems with shallow water upstream of Cookham, and the earliest suggestions were for a stop at Cookham to hold the water back. In 1794 it was considered one of the most dangerous parts on the river, mainly on account of chalk boulders falling into the Thames. Plans for a lock and cut were formulated in 1807, but seven years later, the City of London were complaining that no action had been taken. In 1826, a barge carrying stone for Westminster ran aground, swung across the channel, and broke in two, resulting in the loss of the cargo, valued at 40 pounds. Finally, a cut and lock were agreed upon in 1829, the cut going through the northernmost island called The Sashes. Part of the cut was formed from an existing Sashes Stream, and an Ait was removed at the lower end of the cut. The cut modified and elongated the Mill Eyot which was joined with the south eastern corner of The Sashes. The lock opened on 1 November 1830, but no weir was built at this time. The lock and cut cost ¬£8,400 to construct, and the fall on the lock was about . When the lock was built, the access to the lock on travelling upstream from Boulters Lock, was originally a towpath ferry (My Lady ferry or Lower Cookham ferry) crossing to Cliveden,Cliveden ferry http://thames.me.uk/s00748.htm a Middle ferry crossing from Cliveden to the downstream end of Cookham lock islandCookham Middle ferry (Lock ferry); Joan Tucker Ferries of the Upper Thames 2013 and finally the Cookham Upper ferry from the upstream end of the lock island to Cookham village.Cookham ferry; http://thames.me.uk/s00770.htm In 1832 Lord Boston of Hedsor House claimed compensation for loss of towpath rights along Hedsor Water which he was granted. In 1837 a weir was found necessary and built, as a cost of ¬£650. It doubled the fall on the lock to around . The construction led to further litigation from Lord Boston for loss of trade to the wharf he owned there. This time the only compensation he received was the building of a flash lock in the weir. This was removed when the lock was rebuilt in 1869, as Lord Boston had built eel bucks in the stream in the meantime. The lock was rebuilt in 1957. Access to the lock There is a road from Cookham to Formosa Island and the lock; the road is public for pedestrians, but gated for authorised vehicles only. Access from the Thames Path requires a near 1 km walk across Odney Common on Formosa Island and Mill Eyot to Sashes Island, returning by the same route; the Thames Path bypasses the lock and islands due to several historic ferries no longer operating. Reach above the lock Water meadows above Cookham Wooded hillsides by the river Before the streams split above the lock, the river is crossed by Cookham Bridge. Along the reach on the Buckinghamshire bank is Bourne End where the River Wye joins the Thames. Bourne End Railway Bridge, which includes a footbridge, crosses the river here. Along the Berkshire bank there are water meadows. There are navigation transit markers just downstream of Bourne End Railway Bridge, to allow river users to check their speed. Further upstream towards the Berkshire bank are the Gibraltar Islands which lie in front of Quarry Wood. There are then steep hills overhanging the river at Cookham Dean where the house called \\"The Mount\\", where Kenneth Grahame lived as a child is situated. He based much of his book on this part of the Thames which is described as Wind in the Willows country. As the ground levels, the Marlow By-pass Bridge crosses the river a little way downstream of Marlow Lock. =Thames Path= A view of the tail (downstream) lock gates and the banks of the Cliveden Reach beyond. The Thames Path, which has passed through Cookham rather than by the lock, runs from Cookham Bridge along the southern bank until Bourne End Railway Bridge, where there is a footbridge. The path crosses this footbridge and then goes along the northern bank to Marlow. The nearest point on the Thames Path is a little under 1 km away from the lock and a walk across Formosa Island is necessary to visit the lock.

As student in 1917 he became Chairman of the Kronstadt Soviet of Worker's Deputies (the Kronstadt Soviet). Little is known of his early life. As a third-year student in 1917, he had a significant part in the Kronstadt Uprising of 1921 and later served as the Chairman of the Kronstadt Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies (the \\"Kronstadt Soviet\\"), as well as on the editorial board of its newspaper, Izvestiya (News). Originally not from Kronstadt, Anatoly Lamanov was a third year technology student at the Institute of Technology who frequently lectured workers and soldiers on topics such as geography or natural history. He was the younger brother of the officer Piotr Lamanov, revolutionary commander of Kronstadt Naval Forces. Lamanov served as chairman of the Kornstadt soviet and was chief editor of its leading newspaper Izvestiia. He also led the Non-Party faction, a worker conscious movement that was wary of the representative model. The Non Party faction was later renamed as the Union of Socialist Revolutionaries Maximalists. In 1921, he was denounced as the leading ideologist of the Kronstadt uprising, and was eventually executed as a ‚Äòcounter revolutionary‚Äô. Lamanov had a central role in shaping the egalitarian radical socialist ideology of Kronstadt.Getzler, Israel. Kronstadt: 1917 - 1921; the Fate of a Soviet Democracy. Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Pr., 1983. Print. Relation to the April Crisis As leader of the Non Party group, Lamanov consolidated the ideas of the many different portions of the Kronstadt Soviet. One Menshevik observer is noted to say that his ideology was neither ‚ÄúLeninist nor Anarchist‚Äô.Getzler, Israel. Kronstadt: 1917 - 1921; the Fate of a Soviet Democracy. Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Pr., 1983. Print. 55. He called for restraint, close ties with the Petrograd Soviet and an avoidance of ‚Äòdisunity and party discord‚Äô which had ‚Äòruined the revolution of france‚Äô. He also held up the mantra of ‚ÄúIf only so far‚Äù in his idea of the relationship between Kronstadt and the Provisional Government. Like many Kronstadters, Lamanov felt that the relationship with the provisional Government shouldn‚Äôt be immediately severed if they fail to uphold the revolutionary spirit of the February revolutions, but that they must be pressured into aligning themselves with the Kronstadt soviet . Up until the April Crisis, Lamanov had avoided discussing the question of power in relation to Russia at large. With the Foreign Minister reaffirming Russia‚Äôs commitment to continuing their involvement in World War I -- which was a major trigger for the February revolutions‚ÄîKronstaders feeling betrayed, turned away from their creative endeavours to focusing on how they would maintain their radical democracy in relation to the decisions made by the provisional government.Getzler, Israel. Kronstadt: 1917 - 1921; the Fate of a Soviet Democracy. Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Pr., 1983. Print. Importance of his position on the newspaper Lamanov, as chairman of the Executive Committee of the Kronstadt Soviet, was the subject of hostility from the Bolsheviks after denouncing Raskolnikov and the July Days. However, the Bolsheviks were not able to blunt Lamanov‚Äôs political influence, for Lamanov was elected as chairman of the newspaper Izvetsiia‚Äôs editorial commission. In the Aftermath of the July Days, opposition to the Bolsheviks resulted in swelling support for the Non- Partyists, or, as it would come to be called, the Union of Socialist Revolutionaries-Maximalists. As chairman of Izvetsiia, Lamanov ‚Äúwas in a favourable position to give ample newspaper coverage to their views, even though they had to be passed by three major Soviet factions represented on the editorial board.‚Äù Getzler, Israel. Kronstadt: 1917 - 1921; the Fate of a Soviet Democracy. Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Pr., 1983. Print. 135. On 21 April, Lamanov denounced the declarations of the provisional government and turned the debate away from the power question, to affirming a solidarity with the struggles of the petrograd soviet.Getzler, Israel. Kronstadt: 1917 - 1921; the Fate of a Soviet Democracy. Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Pr., 1983. Print. 59. He also urged the soviet to avoid moving the power to the revolutionary government, instead he argued that ‚Äúfull support‚Äù should be given to the petrograd soviet. In addition, he helped set a motion that would have the soviet ‚Äòfully support revolutionary pressure on the provisional government and its continuous and relentless control over it in the interests of the revolution‚Äô . This motion was unique to Kronstadt in its contrast with the bolshevik resolution that called for the complete overthrow of the provisional government. Lamanov‚Äôs approach to the April Crisis was instrumental in maintaining an antagonistic relationship with the Provisional Government without calling for its complete overthrow. This stance also sent shockwaves into the Petrograd Soviet, as it showed that the bolsheviks didn‚Äôt have the influence in Kronstadt that they purported to have when sending their delegates to Petrograd. The Bolsheviks were later going to gain support, as they opposed Lamanov‚Äôs insistence on joining into a coalition government with the bourgeoisie. This would culminate in the July days. He was also head of Kronstadt's 'Non-Party Group', which in August 1917 merged with the Union of Socialist-Revolutionaries Maximalists. Lamanov subsequently joined the Communist party but resigned during the 1921 uprising. He was the editor of the anti-Bolshevik rebels' Izvestia (News) newsletter of the Provisional Revolutionary Committee. Shortly after the uprising, Lamanov was executed as a counter-revolutionary by the Bolsheviks.Getzler, Israel. Kronstadt: 1917 - 1921; the Fate of a Soviet Democracy. Cambridge: Cambridge Univ.

He made key contributions to the theory of plate tectonics, helping to show that the seafloor spreads from mid-ocean ridges with a symmetrical pattern of magnetic reversals in the basalt rocks on either side. Early life Vine was born in Chiswick, London, and educated at Latymer Upper School and St John's College, CambridgeProfile at Bookrags.com where he studied Natural Sciences (BA, 1962) and marine geophysics (PhD, 1965). Plate Tectonics The observed magnetic profile for the sea floor around a mid- oceanic ridge agrees closely with the profile predicted by the Vine‚ÄìMatthews‚ÄìMorley hypothesis. Vine's PhD thesis was on 'Magnetism in the Seafloor' and supervised by Drummond Matthews. Having met Harry Hess he was aware of sea floor spreading, where the ocean bed acts as a 'conveyor belt' moving away from the central ridge.BBC / Open University broadcast series Earth Story, Vine interviewed by Professor Aubrey Manning Vine's work, with that of Drummond Matthews and Lawrence Morley of the Geological Survey of Canada, helped put the variations in the magnetic properties of the ocean crust into context in what is now known as the Vine‚ÄìMatthews‚ÄìMorley hypothesis. Specifically they supported Dietz's (Nature 1961) idea that sea floor spreading was occurring at mid-ocean ridges. Vine and Matthews showed that basalt created at a mid-ocean ridge records earth's current magnetic field polarity (and strength), thus turning Hess's theoretical 'conveyor belt' into a 'tape recorder'. Furthermore, they showed that magnetic reversals 'frozen' into these rocks, as suggested by Allan Cox (Nature 1963), can be seen as parallel strips as you travel perpendicularly away from the ridge crest. Academic career Vine worked with E. M. Moores on the Ophiolite in the Troodos mountains of southern Cyprus. He worked with R. A. Livermore and A. G. Smith on the history of the Earth's magnetic field. He worked on the electrical conductivity of rocks from the lower continental crust with R. G. Ross and P. W. J. Glover, which culminated in 1992 with measurements of the electrical conductivity of graphite-rich amphibolites and granulites at lower crustal temperatures and pressures with a full water saturation and pore fluid pressure and graphite-free In 1967, Vine became assistant professor of geology and geophysics at Princeton University. In 1970 he moved to the School of Environmental Sciences at the University of East Anglia, becoming professor there in 1974. He served as dean from 1977‚Äì1980, and again from 1993‚Äì1998. After 1998, he was a professorial fellow of the University of East Anglia. and then in 2008 he became an emeritus professor there.

MIPT Terror Knowledge Base. It was a breakaway faction of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL). The INPFL was formed by Prince Johnson after a leadership dispute with NPFL leader Charles Taylor over his authority as self- proclaimed head of the National Patriotic Reconstruction Assembly Government (NPRAG), an alternative government that was based in the Bong County town of Gbarnga. Initially estimated at less than 500 troops, the INPFL was a significant force in the early stages of the war. It controlled a number of strategic points within the capital city of Monrovia and facilitated the deployment of Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) cease-fire monitoring group forces, known as ECOMOG. It was the INPFL which captured and murdered President Samuel Doe in September 1990. The faction disintegrated in the wake of internal wrangling over its level of co-operation with the interim government, ECOMOG and the NPFL.

Received generally mixed reviews by critics, the game marks a departure from other entries in the series, insofar as areas are explored with the playable character seen from a top-down perspective, with battles fought in first- person view. The story revolves around a viral outbreak on a passenger ship and has Leon S. Kennedy and Barry Burton return as protagonists. Gameplay When the playable character is attacked by a monster, the game changes from a top-down perspective to a first-person view with a reticle The game features three playable characters and consists of exploring areas, collecting items and combating enemies in the process. Unlike previous entries in the series, Resident Evil Gaiden assumes a top-down perspective for the environment portions that, upon approaching an enemy, changes to a first-person combat mode with a reticle constantly moving to the left and right. To attack, the player has to press the action button while the reticle is in range of the enemy. Plot The title depicts a viral outbreak on a luxurious passenger ship. It introduces an underground organization established to put an end to the global operations of Umbrella, the company responsible for the Raccoon City disaster. Leon S. Kennedy, one of the protagonists of Resident Evil 2, joined the initiative and received orders to investigate the ocean liner, Starlight, which is rumored to be carrying a new type of bio-organic weapon (BOW) developed by Umbrella. Eventually, the headquarters loses contact with him and Barry Burton, a support character from the original Resident Evil, is sent in to find his whereabouts. After discovering that the crew and the passengers on the ship have turned into zombies, he crosses the path with an orphan girl named Lucia, who, for some reason, can sense the presence of Umbrella's new BOW and also possesses some other mysterious abilities. Lucia is then kidnapped by the monster, but Barry eventually reunites with Leon and they cooperate to put the BOW to flight and save her. The group learns that the monster is supposed to have green blood and, afterwards, witnesses an explosion set the ship on fire. They split up and Leon and Lucia activate the sprinkler system to prevent the engine room from blowing up. Later, the two overhear Barry communicating with Umbrella to arrange some sort of trade-off, their suspicions confirmed upon meeting him again. Barry threatens Leon with his gun, kidnaps Lucia and escapes to an Umbrella submarine with her. Meanwhile, a second explosion hits the Starlight and Leon makes his way to the engine room to investigate its source. He finds out that the BOW destroyed the fuel converter in an attempt to blow up the ship and destroy all evidence. He successfully fights it off, but the damage done to the ship is too severe. The scene then shifts to the submarine, where Barry reveals to the captain that he pretended to abduct Lucia to trick Umbrella into evacuating them from the Starlight. He also learns that the company knew nothing of the BOW on the Starlight and wants Lucia, as she is the host of a parasite, which grows into another BOW within ten days. Barry forces the surgeons on board to remove the parasite from the girl, but it breaks free from the containment glass and drains the life from the captain, turning him into a zombie. The parasite escapes, kills the whole crew and eventually turns into a mature BOW. Barry and Lucia navigate the submarine back and board the near-sunk ship in order to rescue Leon, but the grown-up monster goes ahead of them. Although they quickly discover what appears to be Leon, the two find out that the BOW is actually a shape-shifter and that it has assumed the form of their partner. They manage to escape and come across another Leon in the engine room. Together, the three go back to the deck, where the BOW pulls Lucia into the sea. Barry rescues her, but then another Lucia appears right behind them. The real girl grabs a knife and cuts her hand to show her red blood, thus confirming her identity. The group defeats the BOW in one last battle and escapes to the submarine. Lucia, having lost her mysterious powers with the parasite's extraction, is offered to live with Barry's family. In the game's final shot, Leon's neck is shown bleeding green blood, revealing him to be not the real Leon but the first BOW in disguise, now unable to be sensed by Lucia. Development While the technical implementation of the game was done by the now defunct British company M4, two employees of Capcom were involved with the development as well. Shinji Mikami served as an advisor for the game and the story was written by Hiroki Kato, the director of Resident Evil - Code: Veronica. The game's first-person combat was inspired by the 1987 role-playing video game Dungeon Master. Reception Resident Evil Gaiden received generally mixed reviews from critics. Mike Major of GamePro remarked that the visual presentation detracts from the intended creepy atmosphere. IGN's Craig Harris criticized the game's unpractical save system for a handheld game (the player can save only at limited save points) and was unsatisfied with the puzzles being reduced to collecting keys and items. GameSpot's Frank Provo addressed the same issues in their review, though they applauded the clever storyline for its many twists and turns. Computer and Video Games also criticized the graphics, but found the puzzles to be on par with that of other installments in the series, and commended the battle system.

The educational facilities provided by the district include four accredited colleges, and several off-campus \\"educational centers\\" located to serve specific geographic communities: *American River College - northeast of Sacramento in Foothill Farms, California **Natomas Center - in Natomas near ARCO Arena *Cosumnes River College - in the southern Sacramento neighborhood of Valley Hi **Elk Grove Center in the City of Elk Grove *Folsom Lake College - east of Sacramento in Folsom **El Dorado Center - farther east in Placerville **Rancho Cordova Center *Sacramento City College - downtown Sacramento **West Sacramento Center **Davis Center - farther west, on UC Davis campus Administration Governance and public oversight is provided by a Board of Trustees whose seven members are elected to four-year terms by the public from different geographical trustee areas. Common administrative services such as human resources, purchasing, accounting, and information technology are provided for the colleges at a separate off-campus district office complex. Los Rios' main office is at 1919 Spanos Court in the Arden- Arcade area of Sacramento County. History The results of a March 17, 1964, election led to the 1965 formation of the Los Rios Junior College District to govern Sacramento City College (1916) which separated from the Sacramento City Unified School District, and American River College (1942) which separated from the Grant Joint Union High School District. When the district was formed there were 10,632 students attending the two colleges. One of the first actions of the new Los Rios district was to form a planning committee which, in 1967, acquired new land for future colleges: north of Sacramento in Natomas, south near Elk Grove, and east near Folsom. That committee proved to be accurate in their predictions of growth, which has been invaluable to the district over time. Property values in these areas have soared and acquiring the amount of land necessary for a complete college campus today might be prohibitively expensive. In 1970 the district opened Cosumnes River College on the site to the south. By 1980 combined enrollment in the district's three colleges was about 44,500 students. By 1995 combined enrollment in the district's three colleges was about 53,000 students. In 2004 the district opened California's 109th community college, Folsom Lake College, on the site to the east of Sacramento in Folsom. By 2005 combined enrollment in the district's four colleges was about 71,000 students. By 2010 combined enrollment in the district's four colleges was over 84,000 students.

Yrausquin Airport is an airport on the Dutch Caribbean island of Saba. Overview The airport, named after the Aruban Minister Juancho Irausquin, has the shortest commercial runway in the world, only long, flanked on one side by high hills, with cliffs that drop into the sea at both ends. Although the airport is closed to jet traffic, regional airline propeller aircraft are able to land there under waivers from The Netherlands Antilles' Civil Aviation Authority. The most common aircraft to land there are the STOL- capable de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter and BN-2 Islander. History The airport in 1997 The idea of building an airport on Saba is credited to Remy de Haenen, who brought the idea to the Saba Economic Council along with a contractor named Jacques Deldevert. De Haenen had previously made several landings of a Vought-Sikorsky OS2U seaplane off Fort Bay harbor as early as 1946. After surveying the island by air, de Haenen suggested then-privately owned Flat Point as the site for the airport. The land was cleared and graded in only a couple of weeks. De Haenen made the first landing of an aircraft on the island of Saba on February 9, 1959, with nearly the entire population of the island in attendance. After that first landing, de Haenen was prohibited from making further landings on the island and there were no flights to or from Saba for several years. In the lead up to the 1962 parliamentary elections, the lack of an airport on the island became a big issue. Sint Maarten politician Claude Wathey, who also represented Saba in the Parliament of the Netherlands Antilles, and Aruban politician Juancho Irausquin, who was at the time Minister of Finance for the Netherlands Antilles, supported the construction of an airport. The Dutch government made 600,000 guilders available to build it as part of a larger 3-year plan for the Windward Islands. Irausquin told friends that during a harrowing voyage to Saba by sloop in 1960 he promised to look for funds to build an airport on the island if his life was spared. The company contracted to build the airport was owned by Wathey's brother Chester as well as Jacques Deldevert. On March 22, 1962, while the airport was under construction, three helicopters from the Dutch aircraft carrier landed there, marking the second time aircraft landed on the island. Then on February 1, 1963, a twin engine PA-23 Apache piloted by George Greaux landed on the newly asphalted runway. The airport officially began service on July 24, 1963. Irausquin had died the year before and his widow cut the ribbon at the official opening ceremony on September 18. Greaux and several other investors formed Windward Islands Airways (Winair) in 1961, which offered service to Saba. Regular air service to Saba did not begin immediately due to the need for a short takeoff and landing (STOL) aircraft and the small number of people who could afford a ticket. In 1965, the airport went unused for six months. For a while the island was serviced by a 6-passenger STOL-capable Dornier Do-28 aircraft. The December 1, 1963, Winair timetable lists flights between Saba and Sint Maarten.http://www.timetableimages.com, Dec. 1, 1963, Windward Islands Airways timetable Service picked up when Windward Islands Airways began flying de Havilland Twin Otters in 1965. In 1998, Hurricane Georges destroyed the airport's terminal building. The Dutch government funded construction of a new building and it was dedicated on December 6, 2002, to de Haenen. The propeller from de Haenen's first landing on the island is on display in the building. Facilities Jet aircraft are unable to land at the airport, because the runway is too short, but smaller STOL airplanes (such as the DHC-6, BN-2, and helicopters) are common sights. A small ramp and terminal are on the southwest flank of the runway. The ramp also has a designated helipad. The terminal building houses offices for Winair, immigration and security, a fire department with one fire truck, and a tower. The tower is an advisory service only and does not provide air traffic control. Aviation fuel is not available on the island of Saba. Airlines and destinations The only airline currently providing scheduled services to and from Yrausquin Airport is locally owned Winair, which operates daily flights to Sint Maarten aboard a de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter. On average, flights to Sint Maarten last no longer than 15 minutes.

Illawong is located 27 kilometres south of the Sydney Central Business District, in the local government area of the Sutherland Shire in the area commonly called Menai. The post code is 2234, which is also assigned to the contiguous suburbs of Menai, Bangor Barden Ridge and Alfords Point. Illawong sits between the southern shore of the Georges River and the northern shore of the Woronora River. Illawong consists mainly of residential homes, a nursing home, a primary school and a small shopping centre.  History  Illawong is an Aboriginal word meaning between two waters, referring to the Georges and Woronora Rivers. Illawong was originally inhabited by the Tharawal and/or Eora tribes who left remnants of their lives in many middens, rock carvings and cave paintings. The Illawong Nature Reserve also lies \\"between two waters\\". In this case, the reserve lies between a system of 2 wetlands, which in combination with the heavily vegetated ridgeland, provide habitat which is particularly suited to the long necked turtle. Captain John Hunter (1731‚Äì1821) was the first European to explore the area. In 1789, Hunter sailed through the Georges and Woronora Rivers. In 1795-6, with Matthew Flinders and George Bass, Hunter explored further up the Georges River and declared the area of Bankstown. Construction of Old Illawarra Road took place between 1843 and 1845 and was inspected by Major Thomas Mitchell, it being one of the last public works completed by convicts. The construction allowed the new route to be about 32 kilometres shorter towards the South Coast. At the southern end of the district Major Mitchell took the road across the ford at the head of the Woronora River, naming the ford \\"Pass of Sabugal\\", possibly due to the resemblance in scenery of the north-eastern frontier of Portugal.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 132 In the 1890s Menai was a farming area and Illawong, which was then known as East Menai, was an area where wealthy people of Sydney built holiday homes and weekenders.

All systems are treated as a black box; the diagram places emphasis on events that cross the system boundary from actors to systems. A system sequence diagram should be done for the main success scenario of the use case, and frequent or complex alternative scenarios. A system sequence diagram should specify and show the following: * External actors * Messages (methods) invoked by these actors * Return values (if any) associated with previous messages * Indication of any loops or iteration area Reading a system sequence diagram Professionals, in developing a project, often use system sequence diagrams to illustrate how certain tasks are done between users and the system. These tasks may include repetitive, simple, or complex tasks. The purpose is to illustrate the use case in a visual format. In order to construct a system sequence diagram, you need to be familiar with the unified modeling language (UML). These models show the logic behind the actors (people who affect the system) and the system in performing the task. Reading a sequence diagram begins at the top with the actor(s) or the system(s) (which is located at the top of the page). Under each actor or system there are long dotted line called lifelines, which are attached to them. Actions are performed with lines that extend between these lifelines. When an action line is connected to a lifeline it shows the interaction between the actor or system. Messages will often appear at the top or bottom of a system sequence diagram to illustrate the action in detail. For example, the actor could request to log in, this would be represented by login (username, password). After each action is performed, the response or next action is located under the previous one. As you read down the lines you will see in detail how certain actions are performed in the provided model.

He is currently a professor at the University of Tokyo, Japan. Early life Yoichi Komori was born into a family of a professional political activists on May 14, 1953, in Tokyo, Japan. His father Yoshio Komori (1926‚Äì2008, Â∞èÊ£ÆËâØÂ§´), had been the representative of Japanese Communist Party to the general headquarter of the World Federation of Trade Unions (Japanese: ‰∏ñÁïåÂä¥ÂÉçÁµÑÂêàÈÄ£Áõü) in Praha, Czechoslovakia from 1961 to 1965 and Yoshio had been elected as the central member of Japanese Communist Party from 1977(1). Yoichi Komori‚Äôs mother Kyoko (b.1930, Â∞èÊ£ÆÈ¶ôÂ≠ê), is a poet and a communist social activist. Komori Yoichi‚Äôs grandfatherÔºå Shinobu Komori (1911‚Äì1962, Â∞èÊ£ÆÂøç),was a well-known artist in sculpture and ceramics in modern Japanese art history. Education Komori had spent four years in Praha with his parents, where he received his elementary education in the Elementary School Attached to Russian Embassy and he returned to Japan in 1965. This experience had brought vexation on him after he returned from Praha to Tokyo in 1965 for his poor Japanese.Komori Yoichi, Komori Yoichi, nihongoni deau, (Tokyo: Taishukan, 2000),5-38. Komori received his B.A. and master's degree in Japanese Literature at the national Hokkaido University, Japan. He finished his Ph.D. Course at the same university in 1982 and soon after that he got a tenured position as a lecturer at Seijo University in Tokyo, where he had been teaching till he moved to the University of Tokyo in 1988. He became full Professor of the University of Tokyo in 1998. Career Y≈çichi Komori made his debut with the following two influential books in the academia in Japan, which were published at the same time in March 1988, K≈çz≈ç toshiteno katari [Narrative as structure] and Buntai toshiteno monogatari [Stories as style]. With the new critical approaches and perspectives drawn from narratology and semiotics of Mikhail Mikhailovich Bakhtin and so on, he had made a totally new and convincing interpretation on the genealogy of Japanese modern novels in 1890s. He also has influenced by literary critic Ai Maeda (1931‚Äì87, ÂâçÁî∞ÊÑõ), the author of Kindai dokusha no seiritsu [The genealogy of modern readership] (1973), Toshi k≈´kan no bungaku [Text and the city: essays on Japanese modernity] (1982) and so on, As a literary historian, he is also known as a brilliant researcher for the literature of Soseki Natsume (1867‚Äì1916, Â§èÁõÆÊº±Áü≥), the father of modern Japanese literature. Y≈çichi Komori is also very influential to the young Japanese literary historians for his theoretical and critical approaches in the research of modern novels. The critic Masaki Nakamasa (b.1963) points out that ‚Äúa left turn‚Äù for Japanese postmodernism took place in 1992 or 1993, and can be seen in some postmodernist exponents like Tetsuya Takahashi, Y≈çichi Komori, Hidetaka Ishida, Tetsu Ukai (b.1955) and so on, who draw on modern European, and especially French, thoughts to criticize Japanese conservative power‚Äôs whitewashing of wartime crimes, the conservatives‚Äô tendency to suppress historicity.Nakamasa Masaki, Postomodan no hidari senkai, (Tokyo: J≈çky≈ç shuppan, 2002), 197-248. Quoted from Shaoyang Lin, ‚ÄúJapanese Postmodern Philosophy‚Äôs Turn to Historicity,‚Äù Journal of Japanese Philosophy , Initial Issue (April 2013) 121.Regarding the de-politicisezed, and even conservative application of postmodern fashion in 1980s Japan, please refer to Harry Harootunian, ‚ÄúVisible discourses / invisible ideologies\\" in Masao Miyoshi and Harry Harootunian, Postmodernism and Japan (Durham and London: Duke University Press, 1989) 63-92. Y≈çichi Komori represents the typical political application of postmodern theory, who draws on new methodology like semiotic theory, Jacques Lacan‚Äôs psychoanalysis and so forth to dig into historicity through consciousness and subconsciousness.Shaoyang Lin, ‚ÄúJapanese Postmodern Philosophy‚Äôs Turn to Historicity,‚Äù Journal of Japanese Philosophy, Initial Issue (April 2013) 119. In this sense Komori probably identifies himself as a historian in a broad sense. Yoichi Komori is also a well-known social activist in Japan. He had been the leading intellectual who protested against the injuring party‚Äôs toning down or deleting Japan‚Äôs history of invasion of East Asia in the ‚Äúnew Japanese history textbook controversies‚Äù from 1993 to early 2003. He is also one of the key founding members of the Article 9 Association (A9A), a nationwide civic movement against the conservative revision of the pacifist Japanese Constitution. A9A was established in June 2005 in the names of 9 famous senior intellectuals including Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe (b.1935ÔºåÂ§ßÊ±üÂÅ•‰∏âÈÉé), the Noble Prize Laureate for Literature in 1968, the critic Sh≈´ichi Kat≈ç (1919‚Äì2008,Âä†Ëó§Âë®‰∏Ä), Shunsuke Tsurumi (1922‚Äì2015, È∂¥Ë¶ã‰øäËºî), a well-known philosopher and an anti-war activist, and so on.

Geography The Zayandeh starts in the Zard-Kuh subrange of the Zagros Mountains in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province. It flows eastward before ending in the Gavkhouni swamp, a seasonal salt lake, southeast of Isfahan city. The Zayandeh used to have significant flow all year long, unlike many of Iran's rivers which are seasonal, but today runs dry due to water extraction before reaching the city of Esfahan. In the early 2010s, the lower reaches of the river dried out completely after several years of seasonal dry-outs.BBC NEWS : \\"The Zayandeh rood river in Isfahan, one of Iran's main tourist attraction, has dried up.\\" The Zayandeh River basin has an area of , altitude from to , an average rain fall of and a monthly average temperature of to . There are of irrigated land in the Zayandeh River basin, with water derived from the nine main hydraulic units of the Zayandeh River, wells, qanat and springs in lateral valleys. Zayandeh River water gave life to the people of central Iran mainly in Isfahan and Yazd provinces. Before the drying-out, water diverted per person was 240 litres (63 US gallons/53 imp gallons) per day in urban areas and 150 litres (40 US gallons/33 imp gallons) per day in villages.\\"Zayandeh River Basin Short Profile\\" International Water Management Institute, Sri Lanka In the 1970s, the flow of the river was estimated at per annum, or per second.Beaumont, Peter (October 1974) \\"Water Resource Development in Iran\\" The Geographical Journal 140(3): pp. 418-431, p. 427 History People have lived on the banks of Zayandeh River for thousands of years. The earliest evidence of human occupation along the River is found in a cave site called Qaleh Bozi near Dizicheh at SW of Isfahan. More than 40,000 years ago, groups of Paleolithic hunters (Neanderthals) used Qaleh Bozi caves as shelter for seasonal or temporary occupations and left their stone tools and bones of hunted animals. An ancient prehistoric culture, the Zayandeh River Civilization, flourished along the banks of the Zayandeh in the 6th Millennium BC. Zayandeh River crosses the city of Isfahan, a major cultural and economic center of Iran. In the 17th century, Shaikh Bahai (an influential scholar and adviser to the Safavid dynasty), designed and built a system of canals (maadi), to distribute Zayandeh water to Isfahan's suburbs. Water from the Zayandeh River helped the growth of the population and the economy, helped established Isfahan as an influential center, and gave a green landscape to Isfahan, a city in the middle of a desert. The Zayandeh river bed is spanned by many historical Safavid era bridges, and the river used to flow through many parks. Arthur Pope (an American archaeologist and historian of Persian art) and his wife Phyllis Ackerman are buried in a small tomb in pleasant surroundings in its banks. Richard Frye (an American scholar of Iranian and Central Asian Studies) has also requested to be buried there.Staff (18 April 2005) \\"American Iranologist Wills wants to be Buried in Isfahan, Iran\\" Cultural Heritage News Agency Iran Water use and division Zayanderud after sunset Zayandeh River as it passes under \\"33 pol\\" in Isfahan. Until the 1960s in Isfahan Province the distribution of water followed the Tomar, a document claimed to date from the 16th Century. The Tomar divided the flow of the Zayandeh River into 33 parts which were then specifically allotted to the eight major districts within the region.Beaumont, Peter (October 1974) \\"Water Resource Development in Iran\\" The Geographical Journal 140(3): pp. 418-431, p. 421 At the district level the water flow was divided either on a time basis, or by the use of variable weirs, so that the proportion could be maintained regardless of the height of the flow. For centuries Isfahan city had been an oasis settlement, noted for its surrounding fertile lands and prosperity. Until the 1960s industrial demand for water was minimal, which enabled the scarce water resources to be utilized primarily for agriculture. With a growing population within the basin, and rising standards of living particularly within the city, the pressure on water resources steadily increased until the division of water Tomar was no longer feasible. The creation of large steel works and other new industries demanded water. The Chadegan Reservoir dam project in 1972 was a major hydroelectric project to help with stabilizing water flow and generate electricity. The dam was initially named Shah Abbas Dam after Shah Abbas I, the most influential king of the Safavid dynasty, but it was changed to Zayandeh Dam after the Islamic revolution in 1979. Since 1972, the Chadegan Reservoir has helped prevent seasonal flooding of the Zayandeh River. Water discharge is increased during Persian New Year to allow the river to flow through Esfahan once more during the public holiday. 80% of the Zayandeh's extracted water is used for agriculture, 10% for human consumption (drinking and domestic needs of a population of 4.5 million), 7% for industry (like the Zobahan-e-Esfahan and Foolad Mobarekeh steel companies and Isfahan's petrochemical, refinery and power plants) and 3% for other uses. There have been a number of tunnel projects (Koohrang) to redirect water from the Karun river (Iran's largest river that also starts in the Zagros Mountains), to the Zayandeh. These have helped provide water for the growing population and new industries in both Isfahan and Yazd provinces. While the drying-out of the lower reaches of the Zayandeh River has been attributed to drought, the main reasons are man-made. Poor planning and populist politics have led to years of mismanagement and overuse which resulted in seasonal dry-outs and ultimately caused the river to dry out completely before reaching Isfahan.

The buildings are essentially built using bricks. Buildings classified as Brick Gothic (using a strict definition of the architectural style based on the geographic location) are found in Belgium (and the very north of France), Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Kaliningrad (former East Prussia), Sweden and Finland. As the use of baked red brick arrived in Northwestern and Central Europe in the 12th century, the oldest such buildings are classified as the Brick Romanesque. In the 16th century, Brick Gothic was superseded by Brick Renaissance architecture. Brick Gothic is characterised by the lack of figural architectural sculpture, widespread in other styles of Gothic architecture. Typical for the Baltic Sea region is the creative subdivision and structuring of walls, using built ornaments and the colour contrast between red bricks, glazed bricks and white lime plaster. Nevertheless, these characteristics are neither omnipresent nor exclusive. Many of the old town centres dominated by Brick Gothic, as well as some individual structures, have been listed as UNESCO World Heritage sites. The real extent and the real variety of this brick architecture has to be distinguished from the view of late 19th and early 20th century, especially the years around the end of World War I, when it was politically instrumentalized. Indeed, about a quarter of medieval Gothic brick architecture is standing in the Netherlands, in Flanders and in French Flanders. Some dominant buildings are combinations of brick and stone. But the criterion \\"no stone at all\\" looks like a trick to exclude them. The towers of St Mary church in L√ºbeck, the very top Brick Gothic church of the Baltic Sea region, have corners of granite ashlar. Many village churches in northern Germany and Poland have Brick Gothic design, but most of their walls are formed by boulders.  Brick Gothic architecture  St. Anne Church detail, Vilnius, Lithuania Different from other styles, the definition of Brick Gothic is based on the material (brick), and by a more strict definition, a geographical limitation (countries around the Baltic Sea). In addition, there are more remote regions with brick buildings bearing characteristics of this architectural style further south, east and west‚Äîthese include Bavaria, and western Ukraine and Belarus, along with the southern tip of Norway.  Historical conditions  St. Nicholas' church in Stralsund, Germany In the course of the medieval German eastward expansion, Slavic areas east of the Elbe were settled by traders and colonists from the overpopulated Northwest of Germany in the 12th and 13th centuries. In 1158, Henry the Lion founded L√ºbeck, in 1160 he conquered the Slavic principality of Schwerin. This partially violent colonisation was accompanied by the Christianisation of the Slavs and the foundation of dioceses at Ratzeburg, Schwerin, Cammin, Brandenburg and elsewhere. The newly founded cities soon joined the Hanseatic League and formed the \\"Wendic Circle\\", with its centre at L√ºbeck, and the \\"Gotland-Livland Circle\\", with its main centre at Tallinn (Reval). The affluent trading cities of the Hansa were characterised especially by religious and secular representative architecture, such as council or parish churches, town halls, B√ºrgerh√§user, i.e. the private dwellings of rich traders, or city gates. In rural areas, the monastic architecture of monks' orders had a major influence on the development of brick architecture, especially through the Cistercians and Premonstratensians. Between Prussia and Estonia, the Teutonic Knights secured their rule by erecting numerous Ordensburgen (castles), most of which were also brick-built. In the regions along the southern coast of the Baltic Sea, the use of brick arrived almost at the same time as the art of masonry. But in Denmark, especially Jutland, in the Frisian regions, in present-day Netherlands and in the Lower Rhine region, many high-quality medieval stone buildings had been built, before the first medieval brick was burnt, there. Nevertheless, these regions developed a density of Gothic brick architecture as high as in the regions near the southern coast of the Baltic Sea. As well, the central and southern regions of Poland had some important early stone buildings, especially the famous round churches. Many of these buildings, time by time were enlarged or displaced by brick in Gothic style. Especially in Flanders, the Netherlands, the lower Rhine region, Lesser Poland and Upper Silesia, Brick Gothic buildings may have, but not must have, some elements of ashley. In the Netherlands it was mostly tufa, in Denmark old squared granite and new limestone. On the other hand, in many regions supposed to be classical for Brick Gothic, boulders were cheaper than brick, and therefore many buildings were erected by boulders and only decorated by brick, throughout the age of Gothic architecture. = Development = Church of Workum in the province of Friesland is an example of Brick Gothic in the Netherlands Brick architecture became prevalent in the 12th century, still within the Romanesque architecture period. Wooden architecture had long dominated in northern Germany but was inadequate for the construction of monumental structures. Throughout the area of Brick Gothic, half-timbered architecture remained typical for smaller buildings, especially in rural areas, well into modern times. The techniques of building and decorating in bricks were imported from Lombardy. Also some decorative forms of Lombard architecture were adopted. In the areas dominated by the Welfs, the use of brick to replace natural stone began with cathedrals and parish churches at Oldenburg (Holstein), Segeberg, Ratzeburg, and L√ºbeck. Henry the Lion laid the foundation stone of the Cathedral in 1173. In the Margraviate of Brandenburg, the lack of natural stone and the distance to the Baltic Sea (which, like the rivers, could be used for transporting heavy loads) made the need for alternative materials more pressing. Brick architecture here started with the Cathedral of Brandenburg, begun in 1165 under Albert the Bear. Jerichow Monastery (then a part of the Archbishopric of Magdeburg), with construction started as early as 1149, plays a key role regarding Brick Gothic in Brandenburg.  Characteristics  Brick Gothic interior of Storkyrkan in Stockholm, Sweden Brick Gothic with some decoration of stone, Old St. John's Hospital in Bruges, Belgium Romanesque brick architecture remained closely connected with contemporary stone architecture and simply translated the latter's style and repertoire into the new material. The afforded techniques as well as decoration elements that fit to the \\"new\\" material were imported form northern Italy, where they had been developed in Lombard Style (see above). Very important among these techniques was the usage of preformed brick to realize delicate ornaments. Brick Gothic also based on Romanesque building (in stone and in brick) of its region, but in its central regions, Romanesque stone buildings were rare and often humble. In most regions of Brick Gothic, boulders were available and cheaper than brick. In some regions, cut stone was available as well. Therefore, besides all-brick buildings, there are buildings begun in stone and completed using brick, or built of boulders and decorated with brick, or built of brick and decorated with cut stone, for instance in Lesser Poland and Silesia. Brick Gothic buildings were often bulky and of monumental size, but rather simple as regards their external appearance, lacking the delicacy of areas further south. Nevertheless, this was not exclusive. Furthermore, none of these buildings nowadays is exactly the same as in Middle Ages. For instance, many of them have alterations in Baroque style in between and have been re- gothicized in the 19th century (or by reparations after World War II). Especially in the 19th century, some buildings were purified that way.Jens Christian Holst, Die Rathausfront in Stralsund ‚Äì zu ihrer Datierung und ersten Gestalt (in Matthias M√ºller (Hg.) Multiplicatio et variatio: Beitr√§ge zur Kunst : Festgabe f√ºr Ernst Badst√ºbner zum 65. Geburtstag, Lukas Verlag 1998, S. 60 ff.) In the city halls of L√ºbeck and Stralsund, medieval window framings of stone were replaced by new ones of brick. While ordinary people lived very stationary, some groups that were important for the layout of buildings were internationally mobile, bishops, abbots, high aristocracy and long distance merchants, who decided to build, and the highly skilled specialists among the craftsmen. Therefore, also the Brique Gothic of the countries around the Baltic Sea was strongly influenced by the cathedrals of France and by the gothique tournaisien or Scheldt Gothic of the County of Flanders (where also some important Brick Gothic was erected). One typical accentuation of the structure of walls, the contrast of prominent visible brick and plastering of recessed areas, had already been developed in Italy, but became prevalent in the Baltic region. = Brick as the basic material = Since the bricks used were made of clay, available in copious quantities in the Northern German Plain, they quickly became the normal replacement for building stone. The so- called monastic format became the standard for bricks used in representative buildings. Its bricks measure circa 28 x 15 x 9 cm to 30 x 14 x 10 cm, with interstices of about 1.5 cm. In contrast to hewn-stone Gothic, the bricks and shaped bricks were not produced locally by lodges (Bauh√ºtten), but by specialised enterprises off-site.

Virtuous use of these elements is shown in some Gothic buildings in northern Italy, where the highly sophisticated techniques originally had come from, developed in the Lombard Romanesque period. There, such brick decorations can even be found on buildings mainly erected in ashlar. Some Italian Gothic brick buildings have also friezes of terracotta. Riga Cathedral in Latvia While in inner northern Germany and in Greater Poland natural stone was hardly available, shipping cities easily could import it. Therefore, St. Mary's Church in L√ºbeck, generally considered the principal example of Brick Gothic, has two portals made of sandstone, and the edges of its huge towers are built of ashlars, as normally typical for Gothic brick buildings in the Netherlands and the (German) Lower Rhine region. And the very slim pillars of its Briefkapelle (letters chapel) are of granite from Bornholm. In the Gothic brick towers of the churches of Wismar and of St. Nicholas' Church in Stralsund, stone is not used for masonry, but for contrast of colours. At St. Mary's of Gda≈Ñsk, all five lateral portals and some simple but long cornices are of ashlar.  Germany  Brick architecture is found primarily in areas that lack sufficient natural supplies of building stone. This is the case across the Northern European Lowlands. Since the German part of that region (the Northern German Plain, except Westphalia and the Rhineland) is largely concurrent with the area influenced by the Hanseatic League, Brick Gothic has become a symbol of that powerful alliance of cities. Along with the Low German Language, it forms a major defining element of the Northern German cultural area, especially in regard to late city foundations and the areas of colonisation north and east of the Elbe. In the Middle Ages and Early Modern Period, that cultural area extended throughout the southern part of the Baltic region and had a major influence on Scandinavia. The southernmost Brick Gothic structure in Germany is the Bergkirche (mountain church) of Altenburg in Thuringia. In the northwest, especially along Weser and Elbe, sandstone from the mountains of Central Germany could be transported with relative ease. This resulted in a synthesis of the styles from east of the Elbe with the architectural traditions of the Rhineland. Here, bricks were mainly used for wall areas, while sandstone was employed for plastic detail. Since the brick has no aesthetic function per se in this style, most of the northwest German structures are not part of Brick Gothic proper. The Gothic brick buildings near the Lower Rhine have more in common with the Dutch Gothic than with the northern German one. Frauenkirche in Munich, Bavaria = Bavarian Brick Gothic = In Bavaria, there is a significant number of Gothic brick buildings, some in places without quarries, like Munich, and some in places, where natural stone was available as well, such as Donauw√∂rth. Several of these buildings have both decorations of shaped bricks and of ashlar, often tuff. Also the walls of some buildings are all brick, but in some buildings the base of the wall is of stone. Most of the churches share a common distinctive Bavarian Brick Gothic style. The Frauenkirche of Munich is the largest (gothic and totally) brick church north of the Alps. Examples include St. Martin's and two other churches at Landshut and the Herzogsburg (Duke's Castle) in Dingolfing.  Poland  St. Mary's Basilica in Krak√≥w, Poland Brick Gothic in Poland is sometimes described as belonging to the Polish Gothic style. Though, the vast majority of Gothic buildings within the borders of modern Poland are brick-built, the term also encompasses non-brick Gothic structures, such as the Wawel Cathedral in Krak√≥w, which is mostly stone- built. The principal characteristic of the Polish Gothic style is its limited use of stonework to complement the main brick construction. Stone was primarily utilized for window and door frames, arched columns, ribbed vaults, foundations and ornamentation, while brick remained the core building material used to erect walls and cap ceilings. This limited use of stone, as a supplementary building material, was most prevalent in Lesser Poland and was made possible by an abundance of limestone in the region‚Äîfurther north in the regions of Greater Poland, Mazovia and Pomerania the use of stone was virtually nonexistent. =Brick Gothic in Pomerania= Much of the coast of the Baltic Sea in the period from the 12th century to 1637 belonged to the Griffins' Duchy of Pomerania. Nowadays its territory is divided into two parts‚Äîmiddle and eastern in Poland and western-most in Germany. The most outstanding Gothic monuments in this area are Romanesque-Gothic Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Kamie≈Ñ Pomorski, Cistercian abbey in Ko≈Çbacz, ruins of Jasienica Abbey in Police, ruins of Eldena Abbey (a Danish foundation) in Greifswald, St. Mary's Church in Usedom, Castle of the Pomeranian Dukes in Dar≈Çowo, remnants of L√∂cknitz Castle, St. Nicholas collegial church in Greifswald, St. Nicholas' Church in Stralsund, St. Mary's Church in Stralsund, St. Mary and St. Nicholas churches in Anklam, St. Mary's Church in Stargard, St. Nicholas Church in Wolin, St. Peter's Church in Wolgast, Cathedral Basilica of St. James the Apostle in Szczecin, Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Koszalin, Basilica of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Ko≈Çobrzeg and Church of Our Lady in S≈Çawno and city halls in Stralsund, Szczecin (Old Town Hall) and Kamie≈Ñ Pomorski. The most important defensive systems were located in Szczecin and DƒÖbie (present district of the city of Szczecin), Pyrzyce, Usedom, Greifswald, Anklam and Stargard with the water gate on Ina river called Stargard Mill Gate.  France  =Northern France= Belfry of Dunkerque Even the Westhoek region in the very north of France, situated between Belgium and the Strait of Dover participates in northern Brick Gothic, with a high density of specific buildings. For example, there is an amazing similarity between the belfry of Dunkerque (FR) and the tower of St Mary's church in Gda≈Ñsk. =Southern French Gothic= Southern French Gothic is a specific style of Gothic architecture developed in the south of France. It arose in the early 13th century following the victory of the Catholic church over the Cathars, as the church sought to re-establish its authority in the region. As a result, church buildings typically present features drawn from military architecture. The construction material of Southern French Gothic is typically brick rather than stone. Over time, the style came to influence secular buildings as well as churches and spread beyond the area where Catharism had flourished. Gothic Revival ‚Äì 19th-century Neo-gothic St. Chad's in Birmingham, England (1841) In the 19th century, the Gothic Revival‚ÄîNeogothic style led to a revival of Brick Gothic designs. 19th-century Brick Gothic \\"Revival\\" churches can be found throughout Northern Germany, Scandinavia, Poland, Lithuania, Finland, the Netherlands, Russia, Britain and the United States. Important churches in this style included St Chad's Cathedral, Birmingham (1841) by Augustus Pugin, the 1897 Mikkeli Cathedral in Mikkeli in Finland, and St. Joseph's Church in Krak√≥w, Poland is a late example of the revival style.

Also on the photo is Sir Harry Verney, an active supporter of the nursing school. Florence Nightingale, depicted in this popular lithograph reproduction of The Lady with the Lamp as painted by Henrietta Rae, 1891. The Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing, Midwifery & Palliative Care is an academic faculty within King's College London. The faculty is the world's first nursing school to be continuously connected to a fully serving hospital and medical school (St. Thomas' Hospital). Established on 9 July 1860 by Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing, it was a model for many similar training schools through the UK, Commonwealth and other countries for the latter half of the 19th century. It is primarily concerned with the education of people to become nurses and midwives. It also carries out nursing research, continuing professional development and postgraduate programmes. The Faculty forms part of the Waterloo campus on the South Bank of the River Thames and is now one of the largest faculties in the university. The school is ranked as the number one faculty for nursing in London and in the United Kingdom whilst third in the world rankings and belongs to one of the leading universities in health services, policy and research in the world. A freedom- of-information request in 2015 disclosed that the Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery had one of the lowest admission offer rates of 14% to its applicants. The faculty specialises in the following areas: child and adolescent nursing; midwifery and women's health; adult nursing; mental health nursing; and postgraduate research, with programmes catering to the needs of a wider range of individuals and healthcare professionals continuing their professional development. History Inspired by Florence Nightingale and her nurses' work during the Crimean War, a fund was set up in 1855 by members of the public to raise money for her work. By June 1856, ¬£44,039 (equivalent to over ¬£4.26 million in 2016) was raised. Nightingale decided to use the money to set up a training school at St Thomas' Hospital. The first nurses began their training on 9 July 1860. Graduates of the school used to be called 'Nightingales'. When Nightingale's school for nurses was initially set up, under the direction of Mrs Wardroper, the hospital matron, the students had a typical training period lasting a year. Students normally lived in-house; whilst having their own private rooms, a common room for lounge or socials was provided in the hospital's special area. The students attended their classes/patients at St. Thomas' Hospital. Around twenty to thirty students were accepted in a year, whose probationary period fall under two classifications. A common class woman who serves as student, upon completion, would receive a certain small amount of money plus a placement in a home or institution. An upper-class woman or 'Lady', on the other hand, would have completed some education and would be given the opportunity to assist in the school. Uniforms were provided at any case, and they would be under the charge of a matron (and an assistant). Upon graduation, they would be given a chance to visit Florence Nightingale in her South Street apartment, a momentous occasion for few people to meet her in person, especially since Nightingale's profile has been made well-known nationwide after the Crimean War. Nightingale kept extensive notes on all the students in the school, including their 'character'. She placed particular importance upon character; should there be any issue about 'character', the 'certification' of a nurse would be opposed. Between 1860 and 1903 the school certified 1,907 nurses as having had one year's training. Many of the trainees went on to be matrons or superintendents of nursing. Over the years, the training and the school itself went through a series of changes, mergers and expansions. The curriculum for nurses has changed enormously since. Further, in 1991, the school merged with Olive Haydon School of Midwifery and the Thomas Guy & Lewisham School of Nursing, creating the Nightingale and Guy's College of Nursing & Midwifery. The following year the name changed to the Nightingale College of Health. In 1993, it merged with King's College Hospital School of Nursing at Normanby College and formed the Nightingale Institute. In 1996, the Institute was fully integrated into King's College London and was combined with the university's Department of Nursing Studies two years later to form the Florence Nightingale Division of Nursing & Midwifery. In 1999 it was renamed the Florence Nightingale School of Nursing and Midwifery. In September 2014 the school changed its name to the \\"Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery\\". In 2017 the Cicely Saunders Institute at King's moved from the Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine to join with the Faculty of Nursing & Midwifery. The Faculty was renamed the Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing, Midwifery & Palliative Care.

The AIM-95 Agile was an air-to-air missile developed by the United States. It was developed by the US Navy to equip the F-14 Tomcat, replacing the AIM-9 Sidewinder. Around the same time, the US Air Force was designing the AIM-82 to equip their F-15 Eagle, and later dropped their efforts to join the Agile program. In the end, newer versions of Sidewinder would close the performance gap so much that the Agile program was cancelled. Overview =Background= Early infrared homing missiles had two limitations that made them difficult to use in combat situations. The first was that the seeker was relatively insensitive and required large, hot sources to reliably track a target. In practice, this meant the engine of the enemy aircraft had to remain visible to the missile through the shot. The other was that the seeker had a limited field of view (FOV), meaning it could only see the target if it was in front of the missile. These limitations were made clear during the Vietnam War, when early missiles like the AIM-4 Falcon and AIM-9 Sidewinder had success rates on the order of 9 and 14%, respectively. Much of this was due to the fact that pilots had been trained to approach using radar or ground-controlled interception, which placed the enemy aircraft somewhere in front of them, but not necessarily flying in the same direction. In these situations, the seeker might see the target's engine and send the growling signal that indicated lock-on, but would fail to track when fired because the target would move out of the FOV in the time while the missile was flying off the mounting rail. Faced with these dismal results, the US Navy and then US Air Force introduced new training syllabuses that placed much more emphasis on pre-shot manoeuvring, so the launch aircraft would be both behind the target and flying in the same general direction. This would maximize the chance that the target would still be visible to the missile after it was launched. Unfortunately, such manoeuvring was both time consuming and potentially difficult to arrange, and in combat, there were many situations where a target would cross in front of the fighter in a \\"snap shot\\". To provide some capability in these situations, autocannons were hastily added to those fighters that lacked them. =Agile= In the late 1960s the Navy began development of the Grumman F-14 Tomcat fighter, which offered dramatically improved performance over their F-4 Phantoms. The Tomcat's origins begin in the Fleet Air Defense (FAD) concept that was based on aircraft carrying very long-range missiles and radars, allowing them to attack enemy aircraft at ranges on the order of . While the FAD was being developed, experience over Vietnam was clearly demonstrating that the idea of all-long-range combat was simply not possible given tactical limitations. The need for improved manoeuvrability over the lumbering FAD design was clear, and this developed into the VFX proposal that in turn produced the Tomcat. The need for a better short-range missile to equip it for times when the aircraft was forced to close on its target was also clear. Given the dismal results with their current short-range missile, the Sidewinder, the China Lake Naval Weapons Center began development of a dramatically improved missile to replace it. Studies had demonstrated two primary sources of misses; one was taking shots when the missile could not successfully track the target, and the other was when the missile ran out of fuel trying to chase down a target at longer ranges. The new design would address both of these problems; a new seeker would allow lock-on from any angle including the front of the aircraft, greatly improved manoeuvrability would allow it to attack targets even at rapid crossing speeds, and a larger and more powerful motor would give it equal or greater range under all conditions. The resulting Agile design was equipped with an infrared seeker for fire and forget operation. The seeker had a high off-boresight lock-on capability capable of being targeted by a Helmet Mounted Sight (HMS), allowing it to be fired at targets which were not directly ahead, making it far easier to achieve a firing position. The solid- propellant rocket used thrust vectoring for control giving it superior turning capability over the Sidewinder. At the time the navy was developing VFX, the Air Force was developing its F-X concept, which emerged with an almost identical set of requirements as VFX. And as part of that project, they also concluded they needed a much better missile, and began the AIM-82 to that requirement. Since both missiles were more or less identical in their role, it was decided to abandon the AIM-82 in favour of the Agile. AIMVAL VX-5 F-4 Phantom with prototype Agile seekers The AIM-95A was developed to a point where flight tests were carried out including test firing at China Lake and inclusion in the ACEVAL/AIMVAL Joint Test & Evaluation conducted with both the F-14 and F-15 at Nellis AFB in 1975‚Äì78. As a result of escalating costs, the project was cancelled in 1975. Instead, an improved version of the Sidewinder was developed for use by both the Air Force and Navy. Although this was intended to be an interim solution, in fact, the AIM-9 continues in service today. The Soviet Union did embark on the development of an advanced high off- boresight SRM with thrust vectoring and subsequently fielded the AA-11/R-73 Archer on the MiG-29 in 1985. NATO learned about their performance due to the German reunification and efforts began to match or exceed the R-73's performance with the IRIS-T, AIM-9X and MICA IR programs.
