He has shown at venues such as the Getty Center, Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, I-Park Foundation, the Columbus Museum, Samson Projects Evergreen House and Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis. Frelin's work is known for its usage of place and impermanence, informed by extensive travel, though he does not consider himself an environmental artist. \\"Since I don‚Äôt have a big white room to show work in, I make it outside,\\" he told St. Louis Post-Dispatch art critic David Bonetti in 2006. \\"When I began travelling, I found that it was advantageous to not interrupt what I saw by putting it through my own filtering system. I‚Äôve learned to isolate and concentrate attention of perceived phenomenon. The more you train your eye in that direction, the better you get at it\\". In 2000, while completing his second and final year of graduate school, Frelin received a National Endowment for the Arts College Art Association Fellowship. A year later, he became a visiting artist and then a faculty member at Webster University in St. Louis, MO. In 2004 he received an award from the Gateway Foundation for his installations White Heat and Things Airborne. He has also received awards from the New York Foundation for the Arts. Of Frelin's 2006 work, The Mirroring Stone, a gravestone made of polished steel, Boston Globe Correspondent Cait McQuaid said: \\"Walking past, the reflection of grass and other monuments reads like a dizzying warp in your vision. Stop and focus, and you'll discover your own reflection, a chilling reminder that in the end, all that will be left of you is a marker on your grave\\". In 2007, Frelin participated in two international commissions. The United States Embassy, Japan, commissioned Frelin for an art installation in Tokyo, Japan. The project, White Line (Tokyo), consisted of lighting instruments suspended along an arching steel cable, was installed in the garden of the International House of Japan. The Center for Contemporary Art, Kyiv, commissioned Frelin and two others to travel to Ukraine and produce works based on the experience, which were later exhibited in Los Angeles.White Line (Wyoming), 2005 In 2008, the Milwaukee Art Museum Exhibited a series of Frelin's video work as part of the Media Projects 2008 exhibit. \\"With an over- the-river-and-through-the-woods storybook feel,\\" said the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Mary Louise Schumacher, \\"Frelin's works are filled with pilgrimages and a sense of place\\" Frelin has completed residencies at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, MacDowell Colony, Ucross Foundation, Fine Arts Work Center, Bemis Center for Contemporary Arts among others. He is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Art and Art History at SUNY University at Albany, and lives in Troy, NY. He participated in 2013's Art in Odd Places festival with a performance piece, KODAMAZOTHGOLEMNKISI In 2014, Frelin's Crier appeared as part of The Last Billboard installation by Pittsburgh artist Jon Rubin. The text of his billboard installation reads \\"Let's put loudspeakers on the roofs of hospitals/Let's announce births and deaths as they occur\\". In December, his work was exhibited at the Radiator Gallery in Long Island City, alongside artist Rena Leinberger in a show titled From Within the Flesh of the World. In February 2015, Frelin and co-artist Barbara Nelson were selected by Bloomberg Philanthropies as one of 12 finalists for the Bloomberg Public Art Challenge. Their project, on behalf of three upstate New York cities, proposes to illuminate the windows of vacant buildings in New York's Capital Region. In June 2015, Bloomberg Philanthropies announced that their proposal was selected for funding, with an award amount of up to $1 million.

Work Firefall, 2012As part of an essay written for Frelin‚Äôs book of photography, Trees Hit By Cars, Toby Kamps, Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art at the Menil Collection in Houston describes his work this way: ‚ÄúWhile he covers large physical and aesthetic territories, Frelin is aware that he works in a time of limited resources‚Äì‚Äìnatural and artistic. His is an art for the age of global warming. Even as he goes to great lengths to create and catalogue revelatory intercessions in the environment, Frelin realizes the hubris and the ultimate impossibility of bending the world to his will and his will to the world. As a countermeasure, he makes self-criticism a central part of his process. Frelin‚Äôs aesthetic and philosophical road‚Äì‚Äìtwisting and turning between human and natural, between theory and practice‚Äì‚Äìis treacherous, but he also shows us that the marks left in the struggle for control can serve as portentous blazes on the trail.‚Äù References Category:Living people Category:1973 births Category:American sculptors Category:Indiana University of Pennsylvania alumni Category:University of California, San Diego alumni ","title":"Adam Frelin"},{"id":"45711775","text":"Library of Congress Prize for American Fiction (formerly the Library of Congress Creative Achievement Award for Fiction and Library of Congress Lifetime Achievement Award for the Writing of Fiction) is an annual book award presented by the Librarian of Congress each year at the National Book Festival.

A second Uranian Trojan, , was announced in 2017.  Description  An early orbital calculation of the asteroid with an observation arc of 10 days suggested an extremely close MOID to Neptune, but further observations on March 27 refined the orbit to show that the asteroid passes no less than several astronomical units away from Neptune, and show the orbit instead being that of a typical centaur, with a perihelion near that of Saturn, and traveling near to Uranus and Neptune. Later, observations suggested a distant orbit traveling extremely distant from the Sun, but now this too has been shown to be incorrect with later observations. However, it does have a semimajor axis near that of Uranus, making it a Uranus co-orbital. However it is not a Trojan, as it stays near the opposite side of the Sun from Uranus. A paper, submitted on July 27, 2015, analyzed 's orbital evolution, and suggested that it may be more stable than the other known Uranus co- orbitals due to its high inclination, and that many more undiscovered Uranus co-orbitals may exist.

Biography Pullen was Anglican bishop of Cloyne and of Dromore, born at Middleham, Yorkshire in 1648, was, according to Cotton, grandson of Samuel Pullein (1598‚Äì1667), archbishop of Tuam. He was probably son of that prelate's brother, Joshua Pullen, dean of Middleham from 1638 until his death in 1657. Tobias entered Trinity College, Dublin, on 11 March 1663. In January 1666, being then in holy orders, although aged only eighteen, he became a vicar-choral of Tuam, and held the post until 1671. In 1668, after he had graduated B.A., he was elected scholar of Trinity College, and he held a fellowship there from 1671 to 1677. In 1668 also he graduated B.D. and D.D., and was appointed rector of Tullyaughnish, Raphoe. He resigned this living in 1682 on being made dean of Ferns, rector of Louth and Bewley, and vicar of St. Peter's, Drogheda. Pullen was attainted of treason by James II in 1689, but after the accession of William III and Mary II he was created bishop of Cloyne by letters patent dated 13 November 1694. Within a few months he was translated to the see of Dromore, co. Down (7 May 1695). Soon afterwards he issued an anonymous ‚ÄòAnswer‚Äô to the \\"Case of the Protestant Dissenters in Ireland,\\" by Joseph Boyse, a presbyterian minister, who advocated toleration, with immunity from tests, for dissenters in Ireland. Pullen protested that toleration would multiply sects, and deprive episcopalians of the power to \\"show tenderness to their dissenting brethren.\\" The sacramental test for civil offices he described as a \\"trivial and inconsiderable mark of compliance.\\" When a bill \\"for ease to Dissenters\\" was introduced by the Earl of Drogheda in the Irish House of Lords on 24 September 1695, Pullen was one of the twenty- one bishops (out of forty-three peers) by whose votes the measure was defeated. In 1697, Pullen (again anonymously) published \\"A Defence of\\" his position, and suggested that presbyterians before coming to Ireland should undergo a quarantine (in the shape of tests), like persons from a country infected with the plague. Pullen built an episcopal residence at Magherellin. Two-thirds of the sum expended was refunded by his successor, pursuant to the statute. He died on 22 January 1713, and was buried at St. Peter's, Drogheda. He married, on 16 May 1678, Elizabeth Leigh (d. 4 Oct. 1691), by whom he had five children. The youngest, Joshua, born in 1687, entered Trinity College, Dublin, on 11 June 1701, graduated M.A., and was chancellor of the diocese of Dromore from 1727 until his death in 1767.

It was built by August Von Senden. It is also known as Krugers Farm. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 February 2005.  History  The brick and timber farmhouse was erected beside the Logan River in the early 1870s for immigrant German farmer Christian Kruger and his family. It was built using construction methods and materials traditional to rural northern Germany, from where the majority of settlers along the Logan River in the middle of the 19th century emigrated. The farm is located on the former Logan River Agricultural Reserve. The creation of agricultural reserves was one of the Queensland Government's earliest initiatives following separation from New South Wales in December 1859. Expanding agricultural production within Queensland's pastoral- based economy was necessary to reduce the colony's dependence on imported foodstuffs, and to encourage cash cropping of export commodities such as cotton and sugar. The Alienation of Crown Lands Act of 1860 incorporated provision for the government to create agricultural reserves on which good arable land was to be sold cheaply at the fixed price of per acre. In the same year, an area of approximately along the lower reaches of the Logan River southeast of Brisbane was surveyed into farm portions. On 2 January 1861 this area was proclaimed the Logan River Agricultural Reserve, with the first sale of land on the reserve held in Brisbane on 2 April 1862. Extensions to the reserve totalling were proclaimed in 1863 and 1864. The land that Christian Kruger later acquired was part of the second extension to the Logan River Agricultural Reserve. It was surveyed in 1865 and first offered for sale on 19 April 1866, but was not alienated at the time. Another priority closely linked to the expansion of agriculture was the promotion of immigration to Queensland, to alleviate severe labour and skills shortages, expand the amount of land under cultivation, and create a local market for Queensland produce. To encourage the expansion of agriculture, amendments were made in 1861 to the Alienation of Crown Lands Act of 1860, whereby a system of land orders was introduced as an incentive to immigrants. This system was incorporated into the Immigration Act of 1864, and entitled immigrants from steerage or intermediate class who had paid their full passage to the receipt of non- transferable land orders. These land orders could be exchanged for any country or suburban land offered for sale by auction or selection to the value of the land orders issued. Assisted passages were offered to labourers and mechanics, but these persons usually did not receive land orders from 1864. Immigrants from England, Ireland and Scotland were the targeted group, but the Act also provided for emigration from Germany at the rate of no more than 2,000 adults per annum. In the 20 years (1861‚Äì81) that the land order system operated in Queensland, 9,514 German immigrants arrived on 45 voyages. The first wave of German immigrants brought to Queensland under the auspices of immigration agent Johann Christian Heussler (appointed in 1861) and the Godeffroy & Son shipping company arrived in 1864 and settled at Bethania on the Logan River, where they were among the first to take up agricultural land. Large numbers of German immigrants followed them to the area, settling around Bethania, Beenleigh, Yatala, Eagleby (formerly Philadelphia), Alberton, Carbrook (formerly Gramzow), Stapylton (formerly Yellow Wood) and Pimpama. In the 1871 census, 20% of the Logan-Albert district population was German born (compared with 7% for the whole of Queensland), and the percentage was much higher on the Logan River Agricultural Reserve, which was populated predominantly by German immigrant families. As late as 1898, the Logan River area with its German population was referred to by the English community as \\"Germany\\", with Australian-born children of immigrant parents still speaking low German, or deusch plat, possibly as their principal language. By 1898 the district had 7 Lutheran churches which nurtured and facilitated German culture on the Logan reserve. Until well into the 20th century, church services were conducted in German and German language schools operated at several of the Logan churches. Christian Kruger and his wife Wilhelmine and two children arrived at Moreton Bay on the Suzanne Goddefroy on 6 September 1865. This was the peak year for German immigration to Queensland, with 2,830 immigrants arriving in 12 ships. Most of these immigrants were attracted by the opportunity to acquire cheap farmland in Queensland - very few appear to have emigrated for religious or political reasons at this period. For the first two years the Kruger family resided at Bethania, where Christian worked as a farm labourer in the closely knit German community. In 1867 he selected portion 203, parish of Mackenzie, a parcel of on the north side of the Logan River at Gramzow, some miles downstream from Bethania. Gramzow was named after the small town of Gramzow in the Uckermark region of Prussia (north Germany), from where large numbers of the early Logan settlers had emigrated in 1864-65. It was renamed Carbrook in 1916 during World War I, when anti-German sentiment was high. The Kruger family may have been assisted immigrants not eligible for land orders, because there is no record of them having received government land orders, and Christian made application for the Gramzow selection on 23 August 1867 under the conditions of the Leasing Act of 1866. This Act enabled any Crown land offered for sale by auction or selection and not sold within 30 days, to be opened for lease. The term of the lease was eight years, and the land would be granted to the lessee as freehold following the final year's payment. Christian Kruger was able to pay off his lease some years in advance, and acquired the freehold to portion 203 on 31 December 1872. Like most of the German settlers on the Logan River reserve, the Krugers erected a slab and bark hut as their first dwelling, and concentrated on clearing the scrub, fencing the land and planting their first crop, which probably was maize. Within a few years the farm had proved viable, and the family was able to erect a larger and more substantial residence. According to a local tradition, the present farmhouse was built in 1871, the year Mrs Auguste Ernestine Kruger (n√©e Raedel), Christian's daughter-in-law, was born. However, it is also possible the house was built , after Christian Kruger acquired title to the land. The Krugers constructed their farmhouse in the half-timbering or fachwerk method similar to the mid-19th century German farmhouses erected in South Australia (at Hahndorf, Paechtown, Lobethal, the Barossa Valley, etc.), and traditional to north German rural communities. Fachwerk, meaning shelf- work, involved the raising of an interlocking timber frame that was then infilled with masonry such as brick-nogging or wattle and daub. The latter was often rendered. Similarly constructed buildings identified in the Logan River district include: * the first St Paul's Lutheran Church at Gramzow erected in 1875 under the supervision of August von Senden, a Gramzow-Mount Cotton resident * the first Lutheran manse at Bethania erected by 1884 * the Holzheimer farmhouse at Bethania, erected by * the Schneider home at Waterford, which also operated as the Waterford Post Office * M Schneider's blacksmith shop at Waterford Apart from the farmhouse at the former Kruger's farm, none of these buildings survive. The Bethania Lutheran Church and the Eagleby Lutheran Church were constructed of brick, but not in the half- timbered fashion. Fachwerk buildings were not unusual on the Logan River Agricultural Reserve, but neither were they common. If an early farmhouse of slab construction was replaced by a more substantial house during the 1860s or 1870s, half-timbering was an option. By the 1880s, however, it would appear that the early homes were being replaced with standard Queensland timber and corrugated galvanised iron residences. The reason as to why fachwerk was no longer practised has yet to be established. The construction of fachwerk houses required the services of a highly skilled craftsman due to the complexity of the jointing and assembly of the structural timber frame. August von Senden may have been the master carpenter who constructed the frame for the Kruger's and supervised its erection. Von Senden was a neighbour of Christian Kruger, and was resident on the Logan River Agricultural Reserve from at least September 1869, when he made application to select portion 208, parish of Mackenzie. In partnership with E Schroeder he later held portions 200 and 201, and from 1873 leased a substantial land holding at Mt Cotton as well as his Gramzow farms. Von Senden supervised the erection of the frame for St Paul's at Gramzow, and although clearly a farmer - with interests in a sugar mill at Mount Cotton as well - is listed in the 1889 Queensland Post Office Directory as a carpenter. The timber frame (walls, floor and roof) of the Fachwerk Farmhouse appears to have been cut and dressed off site, with each section clearly marked with Roman numerals or other identifying marks. The Kruger family believes the frame, with the exception of the verandahs, was then assembled and raised by 14 men in one day. It was then infilled with hand-made bricks which reputedly came from Eagleby, on the other side of the Logan River. The roof was shingled originally, unlike the thatched roofs of the South Australian fachwerk buildings. Also unlike the South Australian buildings, which usually rested on a stone plinth, the Gramzow house is elevated on timber stumps. This standard method utilized in most Queensland timber buildings is also a feature of some German fachwerk houses, especially those located on flood plains. Von Senden was a native of Holstein where it was common practice for buildings erected in swampy areas and on low-lying islands to be raised on piers. The farmhouse originally had a separate kitchen and smokehouse. A kitchen alcove was added to the original building around the end of the 19th century. The farmhouse survived the great flood of January 1887, despite water rising several feet inside. By 1888, Kruger's farm was concentrating on sugar production, one of the staple crops in the Logan-Albert district until the collapse of the sugar industry after the turn of the century, and the family had an interest in a sugar mill on an adjacent property. Christian Friedrich Wilhelm Kruger, who in 1865 at the age of 10 had emigrated to the Logan with his parents Christian and Wilhelmine, married in 1891 and raised 13 children on the farm. Title to the farm had passed to him in 1886, although his parents continued to reside there until their deaths in 1905, within 5 months of each other. CFW Kruger died in 1928, but his widow Auguste Ernestine Raedel remained at Kruger's farm until her death at the age of nearly 100 in 1970. Title to the farm passed out of the Kruger family in 1978.  Description  A 12-hectare property on the northern bank of the Logan River at Carbrook, the former Kruger's Farm is situated in a rural residential area at the intersection of the Beenleigh-Redland Bay Road and Skinners Road. Skinners Road, a continuation of the Mount Cotton Road, joins Skinners Park, a former wharf reserve on the Logan River, to form the western boundary of the farm. Other rural residential properties adjoin the eastern boundary of the farm. The entrance to the property is via the northern frontage that faces the Beenleigh-Redland Bay Road. An extended driveway leads from the northeast corner, through grazing paddocks, past a cluster of timber sheds, to the original brick and timber farmhouse. Other structures on the property include a substantial extension to the farmhouse, a modern garage, stockyards and a dam. The extension and the garage are not significant. The Fachwerk Farmhouse is located adjacent to the dam, towards the eastern side of the property and somewhat closer to the river frontage than the road frontage. An elevated timber framed brick cottage with a corrugated iron gable roof, it is a simple rectangular planned building with skillion-roofed verandahs on the longer north and south elevations. Consisting of a main level and an attic built under the steeply pitched roof, the house has been constructed using the traditional German building method known as fachwerk. Fachwerk is a type of half-timbering consisting of the erection of a timber structural frame, the walls of which are then infilled with non-structural masonry panels. In this case the infill is face brickwork. The framing, reputed to be grey ironbark, is generally square in section, hand cut and assembled off site prior to the final erection. Roman numerals and runes are inscribed in the timber to identify the position of each structural member. Joints, including cross- halved, checked and mortise and tenon, interlock the timber members giving the frame greater structural rigidity. Each member must be placed into position in the correct sequence during erection due to the complexity of the jointing system. Round timber pegs are used to position and hold joints, instead of nails. Some of these timber pegs are visible, cut flush with the face of the posts. The timber frame is clearly visible on the exterior of the building and throughout most of the interior. Short timber stumps support sturdy horizontal bottom plates positioned in line with the floor joists. The bottom plates on the eastern and western ends extend to form the framing for the verandah floors. Timber posts mounted on the bottom plate, are positioned at regular intervals dividing the wall into panels. Horizontal top plates, positioned in line with the floor joists of the attic on the east and west walls and directly under the floor joists on the north and south walls, rest on the top of the posts. Between each post are two rows of timber nogging, dividing the panels equally except where windows, mostly timber casements, are incorporated. Diagonal cross bracing, half-checked where it meets the horizontal nogging, is used externally in the wall panels adjacent to the corners of the building. Panels of interior wall that meet the perimeter walls are also cross-braced. In the gable end walls, shorter posts of various heights are positioned between the top plate and the rafters. The timber frame was originally finished with a stain, possibly of ox blood, but has since been painted. Brick infill panels in stretcher bond fit snugly into the spaces between the timber wall members. This kind of brickwork is known as backfilling or brick nogging. The heights between the horizontal timber members are sized to suit brick dimensions. The original bricks are soft handmade bricks, reddish brown in colour and laid with a lime mortar. The farmhouse has a simple gable roof, clad in corrugated iron. The roof structure consists of a series of timber rafters supported on a central ridge beam and the perimeter walls. Timber posts, positioned over the lower level internal walls, break the span of the ridge beam. A timber bracket on one side of the post further reduces the central span. Roofs over the verandahs are a continuation of the gable roof of the house but with a shallower pitch. The north verandah has a timber floor, timber stairs and exposed timber framing including, timber posts with decorative brackets supporting the verandah beam. Brick stairs of recent construction have been built on the eastern end of the verandah. A panelled timber door in the centre of the north elevation opens into the living room of the farmhouse. The north verandah overlooks a lawn and garden which are fenced off from the surrounding paddocks. The remains of a once large fig tree, which has resprouted, is located just in front of this verandah. The south verandah has been built in and a skillion-roofed patio with a concrete floor has been added. The south west corner of the verandah, enclosed with a similar type of construction to the main house, now houses a bathroom. The remainder of the verandah is enclosed by aluminium sliding doors. The eastern end of the south verandah opens into the recent extension to the original farmhouse. The Fachwerk Farmhouse contains three rooms on the ground level, a central living room and two side rooms accessed from the central room. The floors are timber, covered with carpet and interior walls are rendered and painted. The timber frame is visible in the north and south walls and the internal dividing walls but the east and west walls have been re-plastered, concealing the timber framing. The original ceiling has been removed and a new timber attic floor now forms the ceiling over the ground level rooms, exposing the original timber ceiling joists. A steep stair provides access from the south verandah to the attic. This stair has been added and the attic was probably originally reached via an external ladder. The attic ceiling has been lined with sheeting and the rafters are only partly visible. No original furniture remains in the farmhouse. Some of the original fabric of the house was altered when renovations were carried out in the 1980s. The brickwork on the eastern and western walls, damaged in an earlier storm, was replaced with modern bricks and cement mortar. The brickwork in the gable at the western end of the building was replaced with glass installed between the original timber members. Windows in the eastern and western walls have been replaced with aluminium-framed windows and new awnings have been constructed over these windows. Other structures that remain on the farm include three timber sheds located on either side of the entry driveway and timber cattle yards positioned to the east of the driveway. The sheds are all in very poor condition due to the effects of termites and weathering. Further investigation of the site might reveal remnants of earlier buildings such as a smoke house and kitchen, thought to have been built on the site of the new extension, a brick making facility in or near the dam and the remains of a pit saw and wharf in the adjoining park. The site has only a few large trees, except for the riverbank which is thickly vegetated with established mangroves.  Heritage listing  The Fachwerk Farmhouse was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 February 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Influenced by the prevailing land order system and the appointment of German-born immigration agents, 1861 to 1881 was the period of large scale German immigration to Queensland. Little physical evidence survives of the close-knit communities these immigrants established along the Logan River and the farmhouse is a visible reminder of an important pattern of migration to Queensland during the second half of the 19th century. One of the oldest buildings remaining in the Logan district, the farmhouse also provides evidence of the early settlement of the Logan River Agricultural Reserve. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The farmhouse is extremely rare as the only known surviving example of fachwerk in Queensland. Constructed in the early 1870s by immigrant German farmers using a traditional building technique, the Fachwerk Farmhouse at Carbrook is significant as rare surviving evidence of the transplantation of north German culture, language and tradition to Queensland during the formative post-Separation years. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The Fachwerk Farmhouse is significant for its potential to reveal information about traditional north German construction techniques, especially from the Uckermark area of Germany, brought to Queensland in the mid-19th century. Further study of the place may also reveal other structures and archaeological remains that could contribute to our understanding of a way of life no longer practiced in Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. A distinctive timber and masonry building method, fackwerk requires a master craftsman to fashion and erect a jointed timber frame. The farmhouse is substantially intact and demonstrates the principal characteristics of a fachwerkbau, or traditional north German half-timbered building. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Due to its unique appearance and the loss of other similar buildings, the place has a special association with early German immigrants who played an important role in the settlement of Queensland and whose descendants still live in the area.

In November 2016, the company \\"Sloboden Pechat doo\\" became a part of the \\"Adria Media Group DOO\\" from Serbia.  History and profile  Adria Media Group owner of Adria Media Balkan The founders were a group of journalists with open minded and democratic tradition, like Branko Geroski (in 90s founder of the most popular daily newspaper Dnevnik, later sold to WAZ) and Gradimir Jovanovic (Radio Skopje brand journalist, chief editor and commentator, retired), with significant technical and logistic help of the advertising agency Media House from Skopje. Capital founders of the newspaper were Vlatko Kosevaliski, at the time also a General manager, and Gradimir Jovanovic. Branko Geroski was appointed as Editor in Chief. After taking over the share in \\"Sloboden Pechat doo\\", \\"Adria Media Group DOO\\" from Belgrade gives full support to the newspaper. As a result of that support, Sloboden Pechat grew to become the largest print media and distribution house in the part of printed media, with a largest daily print run in North Macedonia. The timing of the beginning of the newspaper was a result of the actual social and political situation in North Macedonia. The motto of Sloboden Pechat is ‚ÄúAlways on the side of people‚Äù. The printing started on a leased printing machine in own printing plant, with personal distribution, because the existing printing and distribution houses refused to print and distribute it. Hence, with few used vehicles, old PCs and outdated software, together with few courageous professionals, Sloboden Pechat grew up to be the leading daily newspaper, with largest circulation in the market, with a distribution fleet of 13 vehicles. As of July 2018, Sloboden Pechat DOO had around 50 employees, 19 in the newsroom (chief editor, deputies, journalists, reporters, photo reporters, technical editors, web designers, lectors etc.), 5 in Marketing department, 5 in Printing house, 13 in Distribution department, 4 in Finance and Administration department. The company has contracts with free-lance journalists, reporters from other cities in North Macedonia and abroad, columnists, internet portals, as well as cooperation with the State Information Agency MIA and foreign news services. The newspaper Sloboden Pechat in January 2017 launched the digital edition slobodenpecat.mk.

Biography Pugh was a dissenting minister, was born at Hendref, Blaenpenal, Cardiganshire, in 1679, and inherited a good estate. He was trained for the independent ministry at the nonconformist college at Brynll≈µarch, near Bridgend, Glamorganshire. This college, the earliest institution of the kind in Wales, and the parent of the existing presbyterian college at Carmarthen, was founded by Samuel Jones after he was ejected from the living of Llangynwyd in 1662, and on Jones's death in 1697 was transferred to Abergavenny, whither Pugh accompanied it. He was received as church member at Cilgwyn in 1704, and in October 1709 was ordained co-pastor with David Edwards and Jenkin Jones. His social position as a landed proprietor in the county was improved by his marriage with an heiress of the neighbourhood, while his power as a preacher and his piety gave him widespread influence. He and his colleagues were in charge of six or eight churches, with a united membership of about one thousand. Between 1709 and 1760 he baptised 680 children. Pugh avoided controversy, but he regarded with abhorrence the Arminian doctrines introduced by Jenkin Jones and the Arian doctrines propagated by David Lloyd (1725‚Äì1779). He sympathised, however, with the Calvinistic Methodist movement under Daniel Rowlands, and induced Rowlands to modify the ferocity of his early manner of preaching. Of the churches with which Pugh was more or less connected, three continue to be congregationalist, three have gone over to the Methodists, and three are Unitarian. Pugh died on 12 July 1760, aged 81, and was buried in the parish churchyard of Llanddewi Brevi, where the effigy of one Philip Pugh, probably an ancestor, once figured in the chancel. His unpublished diary and the Cilgwyn church-book contain much information about the Welsh nonconformity of the period, and have been utilised by Dr. Thomas Rees and other Welsh historians.

Born in Perth to Alice (n√©e Nicholls) and Arthur James Young, Young attended Claremont High School in the city's western suburbs. He then worked briefly as a clerk with an insurance agency, before going to the small Wheatbelt town of Kondinin to farm. He enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force in November 1940, and as a flight lieutenant saw service in Egypt, Singapore, India, and Burma, flying bombers. Returning to Australia in March 1944, he was briefly stationed at RAAF Evans Head, a training school, and then worked for the Australian intelligence service until the war's end. While in Perth in May 1944, Young married Amy Doreen Pond, with whom he later had three children. A keen footballer, he played senior football for during the 1945 WANFL season, and continued with the Kondinin Football Club in the Merredin Districts Football League after returning there in late 1945. Young was elected to the Kondinin Road Board (later the Shire of Kondinin) in 1954, and served as its chairman from 1959 until 1967, when he stood for the by-election in Roe necessitated by the resignation of the sitting Country member, Tom Hart. His only opponent was Liberal candidate Mel Bungey, who was later elected to the federal House of Representatives. Young's majority decreased at both the 1968 and 1971 state elections, and at the latter poll the final margin between him and the next- best candidate, independent Leonard Gleeson, was less than 200 votes ‚Äì Young finished with 51.32% of the two-candidate preferred vote. Young was chairman of the state Country Party from 1971 and 1974, and in July 1973, following Sir Crawford Nalder's retirement, was elected deputy leader, replacing the new leader, Ray McPharlin. A member of various parliamentary committees, Young lost his seat to the Liberal candidate, Geoff Grewar, at the 1974 election. In a three-cornered contest between Labor, the Liberals, and the National Alliance (a brief merger of the Country Party and the Democratic Labor Party), Young received 43.35% on first preferences, but could only gain 48.24% of the final count as the vast majority of Labor preferences flowed to the Liberals.Black and Prescott (1997), p. 446. After leaving parliament, Young was chairman of the board of Claremont Teachers College (later the Western Australian College of Advanced Education), and was also involved with the National Parks Authority. He died in Wembley, a suburb of Perth, in April 2012, aged 93.William Gordon Young ‚Äì Metropolitan Cemeteries Board. Retrieved 19 March 2015.

Background The event was headlined by a UFC Women's Bantamweight Championship bout between former UFC Bantamweight champion Ronda Rousey and #5 contender Bethe Correia. The lightweight and bantamweight finals of The Ultimate Fighter: Brazil 4 also took place at this event. The finale was initially planned to take place on June 27, 2015 in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. However, on May 15, the event was moved to the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood, Florida. It was expected to be the first time an Ultimate Fighter Brazil Finale would take place outside of Brazil. However, as the event approached, several international fighters experienced potential travel restrictions due to technical issues within the Bureau of Consular Affairs division of the U.S. State Department which produces visas. This led to a situation in which several participants might have been barred from being able to compete. Subsequently, the divisional finals of The Ultimate Fighter: Brazil 4 were shifted to this event. The event featured a potential UFC Women's Strawweight Championship title eliminator bout between Cl√°udia Gadelha and former WSOF Women's Strawweight champion Jessica Aguilar. The event fared well, receiving 900,000 pay-per-view buys.

It was built from onwards. It is also known as St Paul's Lutheran Church. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 August 1997.  History  The history of closer settlement in the Logan district began with the proclamation of the Logan Agricultural Reserve in 1861, following the Crown Lands Act of 1860. This made land in the area available for purchase or selection at an acre. British, Irish and Germans began to take up land, but the first concentrated group of settlers were the 22 families from north-eastern Germany who arrived in four ships between 1863 and 1864 and established themselves in the area now called Bethania. These people were mainly farmers and had been brought out as a result of co-operation between the Lutheran Church in Germany and Johann Christian Heussler, at the time Emigration Agent of the Queensland Government in Germany. The cohesiveness and self-sufficiency of this group did much to ensure the success of the settlement. The Brisbane Courier of March 1, 1866, commented that their progress was being followed with great interest in their home towns and expressed the hope that this would encourage the immigration of similar groups. In most parts of Europe, at the time, it was almost impossible for a tenant farmer to aspire to owning his own farm. The offer by the young colony of land orders to those who paid their own passage to Queensland combined with economic and political pressures in Prussia provided a great incentive to make the move. Many families from this part of Germany took up the challenge, including that of Hermann Meisenner whose application for a selection on the Logan was accepted on 20 April 1868. His application was rapidly followed by those of other families and their settlement was named Gramzow after a small village of Gramzow in the Uckermark area near Prenzlau from which a number of them came. These people had transplanted their culture and customs to Queensland including their Lutheran faith. At first, the Gramzow families and a similar group who had settled nearby at Mount Cotton, attended Pastor Haussmann's Bethesda Mission near Beenleigh, but the distance was too great for many to travel. The two communities therefore agreed to join forces to found a church of their own and in 1875 Pastor Haussmann purchased ten acres from the Government midway between Gramzow and Mount Cotton. Three acres of this were cleared for a church and cemetery. Mount Cotton (Carbrook) Lutheran Church, 1931 A building committee consisting of August von Senden, Detlef Holtorf, Philipp and Joh Benfer, Hermann Holzapfel, Friedrich Stern, Paul Schroeder and Johannes Sommer was set up and by the following year the Church of St Paul was completed at a cost of , of which had been raised by subscription. Within twelve months the remaining debt of was repaid. The church was built by members of the community in a traditional north German style with hand-made brick nogging in a timber frame that had been axe-dressed and fixed with wooden pegs. This church was demolished in 1951 and a new church built on land at Mount Cotton. The cemetery that was formerly attached to this church and which contains the graves of most members of the foundation committee and other pioneers of the Gramzow and Mount Cotton areas continues in use. In 1916, due to anti-German sentiment that developed during the First World War, the Gramzow area was renamed Carbrook. Besides the cemetery, the Old Carbrook State School and Kruger's Fachwerk Farmhouse remain from the settlement period.  Description  Perimeter tree planting, 2005 Headstone for Detlef Holtorf, died 1881 Grave of Walter Costin, died 1919 The cemetery is situated at the corner of Mount Cotton Road and Wuduru Road. A perimeter plantation consisting of a double row of regularly spaced mature pine trees planted in the 1960s borders the whole block. There are no other cemetery plantings. As the church originally fronted Mount Cotton Road the graves are arranged in an area on the western side of the block that was originally behind the church. There are at present over one hundred burials with memorials, although many of the earliest graves are no longer marked. The earliest grave still identified is that of Detlef Holtorf, buried in 1881. The majority of the graves are those of the pioneers of the Gramzow and Mount Cotton areas and those of their descendants. Many of the earlier monuments are inscribed in German, which was the language in which services were conducted at St Pauls church until 1924. This is standard or \\"high\\" German, although the Scheer grave carries an inscription \\"De Heer is myn Herder\\" (The Lord is my shepherd) in Platt Deutsch, the dialect that was spoken at home although seldom written. The graves are arranged in clearly definable family plots. Until comparatively recently. these were each bordered by a neat fence. This may reflect the rural nature of the site and the desire to keep grazing animals away from burials, thus preserving the dignity of the graveyard. However, possibly in the 1980s, fences and the metal rails and markers were removed in order to facilitate mechanical mowing. Holes indicating the position of these can still be seen in the hard earth. One grave, that of Lizzie Benfer, is topped by an ornate carving of an angel, but the majority of the monuments are of the upright slab type, most favouring an austere simplicity of style. Several are inscribed with lengthy texts or poems. Recent burials are marked only by small, uniform metal plates. There is a lone grave on the extreme southern edge of the cemetery outside the line of trees. It is that of Walter Costin, stated in the coroner's report to have died by his own hand. Burial of suicides outside consecrated ground was formerly a common practice.  Heritage listing  Carbrook Lutheran Cemetery was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 August 1997 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Carbrook Lutheran Cemetery, developed in 1875, is significant for providing evidence of the history and demography of Carbrook, formerly known as Gramzow, and the surrounding districts. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The site has potential to yield information that contributes to the understanding of a small and extremely cohesive group of German settlers who were played a vital role in the original settlement of the Logan district. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The cemetery is significant aesthetically for the cohesive nature of the cemetery set in a rural setting with clearly definable family plots. The use of \\"Platt Deutsch\\", a German dialect that was spoken but seldom written, for inscriptions is considered unusual. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The cemetery has a strong association with the Carbrook district's community and in particular the German Lutheran Church who, in co- operation with John Heussler, the Emigration Agent for Queensland, was responsible for the emigration of the original group of German pioneers. The strong and continuous presence of a German community in the district since the 1860s is also considered significant.

He wrote the first book, The Anatomy of the Elder, about the medicinal uses of the European elderberry tree (Sambucus nigra), which still is regarded as the standard text for the practice. School and studies After his elementary school years in Gro√üenhain, Blochwich was accepted by the F√ºrstenschule Schulpforta in Naumburg (Saale), where he obtained his university entrance qualification in 1622. He studied medicine at the Leipzig University until 1626. On 4 July 1626, the Medical Faculty of the University of Basel (Switzerland) awarded him a doctorate degree. Life and work After his studies, Blochwich worked temporary in Gro√üenhain, where he may have also researched his comprehensive work The Anatomy of the Elder. There are references to patients from Gro√üenhain, which indicate this. In 1628 he settled in Oschatz. Early death On 10 September 1629, Martin Blochwich died at the age of 26-27 in Oschatz. The cause of his death is unknown. The Anatomy of the Elder In this book, Blochwich described the cultivated plant in three units over 298 pages. *Unit 1: The botany of the elder with an explanation of the origin of the name, as well as where it could be found, its growth and characteristics. *Unit 2: In six chapters Blochwich described the preparation of vinegar, chalk, compote, oil, tablets, ointment, juice, syrup, spirit, water, wine and sugar made of elder in detail and gave recipes. *Unit 3: Thirty-three chapters about the treatment of diseases. Recipes have exact descriptions for the production of medicines made of elderflower, elderberry, elder marrow and elder bark. The book also contains references to the opinions of famous doctors from the Greek/Roman eras the Middle Ages. These sections provided advice to doctors of Blockwitz's era on using elder preparations internally and externally. The conditions include breast and uterine diseases, frostbite, tumours, infectious diseases, lung disease, stomach, intestines, spleen and gall bladder, mental illness, stroke and paralysis, tuberculosis, unclear fever and pain, poisonings, injuries, worm infestation and toothache.  Distribution of the book  * In 1631, two years after Blochwich's death, Johannes Blochwich, who may have been his brother, published the Anatomia Sambuci, written in Latin, in Leipzig. *In 1642 the book was translated into German by Daniel Beckher, a professor of medicine in K√∂nigsberg, who mentioned Blochwich's work in his own book N√ºtzliche kleine Haus-Apotheke. After 1642, Blochwich's book was reprinted in 1650, 1665 and 1685. It is the only translation into German. *In 1650 the Latin version of Anatomia Sambuci appeared in England. It was translated into English by Christopher Irvine in 1651 and published in English in 1655, 1670, 1677 on the recommendation of the British Royal Society. *In 2010 the Anatomia Sambuci was reprinted and an updated English version of Anatomia Sambuci appeared.  Memory honoured  On the occasion of the opening of the Elder Show Garden in Feldbach (Styria/Austria) a new elder variety previously known Klon B2 was renamed Blochwitz on 23 May 2013.  Different spellings of the name  Blochwich's name has been spelt in several ways, which may have been due to the path taken by his book from K√∂nigsberg in East Prussia in 1642 to London in 1650 and the related translations. The name has been written as Blockwich, Blockwitz, Blochwich and Blochwitz.  Literature  *Sepp Porta, Michael Hlatky, Johannes Christandl: Holunder-Wunderwelt; Verlagshaus der √Ñrzte; 1.

The centre of the union was most likely in Moravia and Nitravia (Nitra), additionally the union included Czech tribes, Sorbian tribes (under Dervan) and other West Slavic tribes along the river Danube (present Lower Austria). The polity has been called the first Slavic state. Territory It is generally believed that the tribal union included the regions of Moravia, Nitravia (Nitra), Silesia, Bohemia and Lusatia. According to Julius Bartl, the centre of the polity lay \\"somewhere in the area of southern Moravia, Lower Austria, and western Slovakia (Nitravia)\\". According to J. B. Bury, \\"the assumption that his kingdom embraced Carantania, the country of the Alpine Slavs, rests only upon the Anonymus de conversione Bagariorum et Carantanorum\\". Archaeological findings indicate that the empire was situated in present-day Moravia, Lower Austria and Slovakia. According to Slovak historian Richard Marsina, it is unlikely that the center of Samo's tribal union was in the whole territory of present-day Slovakia. The settlements of the later Moravian and Nitrian principalities (see Great Moravia) are often identical with those from the time of Samo's Empire. According to the findings of some German archaeologists, the core of Samo's state was located north of the Danube, and in the upper Main region.Kunstmann H.

Fr≈±hslavische Keramikfunde in Ostfranken // Ibid. S. 154‚Äì169 In some historical sources of the early IX century, this region is described as \\"regio Sclavorum\\" or \\"terra Slavorum\\". Large amounts of early medieval Slavic ceramics are also found here. Many Slavic toponyms have also been found in this area, such as Winideheim (\\"The Hill of the Wends\\"),(German) Geschichte Frankenwinheims frankenwinheim.de and Knetzburg (‚ÄúPrince's Mountain‚Äù).(Russian) –í–∞–ª–µ–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω –í–∞—Å–∏–ª—å–µ–≤–∏—á –°–µ–¥–æ–≤, –°–õ–ê–í–Ø–ù–ï: –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∫–æ-–∞—Ä—Ö–µ–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–µ –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ. –ú. 2002 // V.V. Sedov, The Slavs, Moscow, 2002Wolf-Armin Freiherr von Reitzenstein, Lexikon fr√§nkischer Ortsnamen, C.H.Beck, 2013; Knetzgau (altsorbisch) p.122 Prelude According to Fredegar, Samo, a Frankish merchant, went to the Slavs in 623‚Äì624. The dating has been questioned on the basis that the Wends would have most likely rebelled after the defeat of the Avars at the First Siege of Constantinople in 626. The Avars first arrived in the Pannonian Basin and subdued the local Slavs in the 560s. Samo may have been one of the merchants who supplied arms to the Slavs for their regular revolts. Whether he became king during a revolt of 623-24 or during the one which inevitably followed the Avar defeat in 626, he definitely took advantage of the latter to solidify his position. A string of victories over the Avars proved his ability to his subjects and secured his election as ' (king). Samo went on to secure his throne by marriage into the major Wendish families, wedding at least twelve women and fathering twenty-two sons and fifteen daughters. In 630‚Äì631, Valuk, the \\"duke of the Wends\\" (') was mentioned. These Wends referred to the Slavs of the Windic March, which according to some historians was the later March of Carinthia (Carantania) in present Slovenia and Austria. According to Jan Steinhubel, Valuk allowed Longobards to pass through his territory and attack Samo from south-west. Longobards were allies of Franks (Dagobert I) against Samo. If Valuk allowed Longobards to go through his territory, his principality could have not been part of Samo's empire. History The most famous event of Samo's career was his victory over the Frankish royal army under Dagobert I in 631 or 632. Provoked to action by a \\"violent quarrel in the Pannonian kingdom of the Avars or Huns\\", Dagobert led three armies against the Wends, the largest being his own Austrasian army. The Franks were routed near Wogastisburg; the majority of the besieging armies were slaughtered, while the rest of the troops fled, leaving weapons and other equipment lying on the ground. In the aftermath of the Wendish victory, Samo invaded Frankish Thuringia several times and undertook looting raids there.Kronika tzv. Fredegara scholastika Dervan, the \\"duke of the Sorbs\\" ('), initially subordinate to the Franks, joined the Slavic tribal union after Samo defeated Dagobert I. The Sorbs lived to the east of the Saxon Saale. Dervan participated in the subsequent wars against the Franks, successfully fighting against Frankish Thuringia (631‚Äì634), until he was finally defeated by Radulf of Thuringia in 636. In 641, the rebellious Radulf sought an alliance with Samo against his sovereign, Sigebert III. Samo also maintained long-distance trade relationships. On his death, however, his title was not inherited by his sons. Ultimately, Samo can be credited with forging a Wendish identity by speaking on behalf of the community which recognised his authority. Aftermath The history of the tribal union after Samo's death in 658 or 659 is largely unclear, though it is generally assumed that it ended. Archaeological findings show that the Avars returned to their previous territories (at least to southernmost modern Slovakia) and entered into a symbiosis with the Slavs, whereas territories to the north of the Avar Khaganate were purely Slav territories. The first specific thing that is known about the fate of these Slavs and Avars is the existence of Moravian and Nitravian principalities in the late 8th century, which attacked the Avars, and the defeat of the Avars by the Franks under Charlemagne in 799 or 802-03, after which the Avars soon ceased to exist. Great Moravia is viewed of as a continuation or successor state to Samo's Empire. The polity has been called the first Slavic state.

She is known for her outspoken support of U.S. President Donald Trump, and various conservative and right-wing political and social causes. Early life Villa was born in Orange, California. Her father Rev. Joseph Villa was an Italian-Argentine, while her mother Mildred Angela Pierce Villa was African American and had some Choctaw Native American ancestry. Her maternal great-uncle was jazz vocalist Kenny Hagood. She attended high school at Lompoc High School, and graduated in 2004.https://old- friends.co/class.php?s=17568&c;=2004https://www.classmates.com/people/Joy- Villa/8732521780 Entertainment career Villa has worked as an actress and producer. From age 14 to 16, she was with Youth Network TV on Comcast Television. With the exception of Hobgoblins 2, in which she has an unspeaking background role as a candy striper, her acting career mostly consists of minor, uncredited appearances on television. These roles include an umbrella- wielding carny in the Heroes Season 4 episode \\"Orientation\\", and other appearances on CSI: NY, The Valley Girls and MTV Next. Grammy Award outfits Villa is known for her flamboyant outfits which she has worn to the Grammy Awards. These include: * For the 2015 Grammy Awards, she wore a see- through dress made entirely out of orange construction-fencing material, designed by Andre Soriano. The dress was called \\"unusual\\" and \\"a first.\\" * For the 2016 Grammy Awards, she wore a similarly see-through dress consisting mostly of fabric spikes. The Huffington Post named it as one of its \\"Most Outrageous Looks From The 2016 Grammys.\\" * At the 2017 Grammy Awards, Villa wore a blue dress, again designed by Andre Soriano, promoting President Donald Trump, featuring his campaign slogan \\"Make America Great Again\\" and the name \\"Trump\\". The publicity from the dress may have helped Villa's EP I Make the Static hitting number 1 among digital downloads on Amazon.com, and iTunes in the US. It climbed up the top 100 of several other countries' iTunes charts too, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and Brazil.

The mansion was built by Winder's widow, Martha Grundy, who was Felix Grundy's daughter, shortly after her husband's death. Construction began in 1859 and it was completed in 1860. It was designed in the Greek Revival architectural style. Martha hired a Louisiana architect named Evens and told him to model the mansion on The Hermitage, Andrew Jackson's plantation home in Nashville, Tennessee. Indeed, she had grown up in Nashville. During the American Civil War of 1861-1865, the mansion was saved from a fire by Union General Godfrey Weitzel. However, the outbuildings burned down. Meanwhile, the fields were used as a camping ground by the Confederate States Army and the Unionists. The Texas Rangers hoisted Bonnie Blue Flag, a flag of the Confederate States of America, on top of the house. In 1872, the plantation was purchased by two brothers, R.S. Woods and R.C. Woods, who were married to two sisters, Maggie Pugh and Fannie Pugh. It became known as the Old Jackson Plantation.Old Jackson Plantation home, owned by a sugarcane planter.

TEM images of M3N@C80 peapods. Metal atoms (M = Ho or Sc) are seen as dark spots inside the fullerene molecules; they are doubly encapsulated in the C80 molecules and in the nanotubes. TEM image of a wide double-wall CNT densely filled with C60 fullerenes. Carbon peapod is a hybrid nanomaterial consisting of spheroidal fullerenes encapsulated within a carbon nanotube. It is named due to their resemblance to the seedpod of the pea plant. Since the properties of carbon peapods differ from those of nanotubes and fullerenes, the carbon peapod can be recognized as a new type of a self-assembled graphitic structure. Possible applications of nano-peapods include nanoscale lasers, single electron transistors, spin-qubit arrays for quantum computing, nanopipettes, and data storage devices thanks to the memory effects and superconductivity of nano- peapods. History Single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) were first seen in 1993 as cylinders rolled from a single graphene sheet. In 1998, the first peapod was observed by Brian Smith, Marc Monthioux and David Luzzi. The idea of peapods came from the structure that was produced inside a transmission electron microscope in 2000. They were first recognized in fragments obtained by a pulsed-laser vaporization synthesis followed by treatment with an acid and annealing. Production and structure Carbon peapods can be naturally produced during carbon nanotube synthesis by pulsed laser vaporization. C60 fullerene impurities are formed during the annealing treatment and acid purification, and enter the nanotubes through defects or vapor-phase diffusion. Fullerenes within a nanotube are only stabilized at a diameter difference of 0.34 nm or less, and when the diameters are nearly identical, the interacting energy heightens to such a degree (comparable to 0.1 GPa) that the fullerenes become unable to be extracted from the SWNT even under high vacuum. The encapsulated fullerenes have diameters close to that of C60 and form a chain inside the tube. Controlled production of carbon peapods allow for greater variety in both the nanotube structure and the fullerene composition. Varying elements can be incorporated into a carbon peapod through doping and will dramatically affect the resulting thermal and electrical conductivity properties. Chemical properties The existence of carbon peapods demonstrates further properties of carbon nanotubes, such as potential to be a stringently controlled environment for reactions. C60 molecules normally form amorphous carbon when heated to 1000‚Äì1200 ¬∞C under ambient conditions; when heated to such a high temperature within a carbon nanotube, they instead merge in an ordered manner to form another SWNT, thus creating a double-wall carbon nanotube. Owing to the ease with which fullerenes can encapsulate or be doped with other molecules and the transparency of nanotubes to electron beams, carbon peapods can also serve as nano-scale test tubes. After fullerenes containing reactants diffuse into an SWNT, a high-energy electron beam can be used to displace carbon atoms and induce high reactivity, thus triggering formation of C60 dimers and merging of their contents. Additionally, due to the enclosed fullerenes being limited to only a one- dimensional degree of mobility, phenomena such as diffusion or phase transformations can easily be studied. Electronic properties The diameter of carbon peapods range from ca. 1 to 50 nanometers. Various combinations of fullerene C60 sizes and nanotube structures can lead to various electric conductivity property of carbon peapods due to orientation of rotations. For example, the C60 @ (10,10) is a good superconductor and the C60 @ (17,0) peapod is a semiconductor. The calculated band gap of C60 @ (17,0) equals 0.1 eV. Research into their potential as semiconductors is still ongoing. Although both the doped fullerides and ropes of SWNTs are superconductors, unfortunately, the critical temperatures for the superconducting phase transition in these materials are low. There are hopes that carbon nano- peapods could be superconducting at room temperature. With chemical doping, the electronic characteristics of peapods can be further adjusted. When carbon peapod is doped with alkali metal atoms like potassium, the dopants will react with the C60 molecules inside the SWNT. It forms a negatively charged C606‚àí covalently bound, one-dimensional polymer chain with metallic conductivity. Overall, the doping of SWNTs and peapods by alkali metal atoms actively enhances the conductivity of the molecule since the charge is relocated from the metal ions to the nanotubes. Doping carbon nanotubes with oxidized metal is another way to adjust conductivity. It creates a very interesting high temperature superconducting state as the Fermi level is significantly reduced. A good application would be the introduction of silicon dioxide to carbon nanotubes. It constructs memory effect as some research group has invented ways to create memory devices based on carbon peapods grown on Si/SiO2 surfaces.

Inspired by an expos√© of opium trafficking in the Saturday Evening Post, the semidocumentary film starred Smalley as a Customs official and Weber as his opium-addicted wife. The film is presumed lost. Plot Customs agent Ward Jansen (Phillips Smalley) is sent to China to conduct an investigation into opium smuggling. His wife, Lydia (Lois Weber), is the daughter of local politician William Waters (Charles Hammond). Left behind in San Francisco and grieving the loss of their child, Lydia resorts to the drug and becomes an addict. When Jansen returns, he notices his wife's strange behavior but does not attribute it to drug addiction. Jansen continues his investigation in San Francisco, and some of the methods of smuggling rings and customs inspectors are depicted. The investigation eventually leads Jansen to raid an opium den in Chinatown where he discovers his wife and learns of her addiction. Jansen's investigation ultimately reveals that his father-in- law is a key player in the smuggling operation. Discovery, as well as guilt over his daughter's plight, leads to Waters' suicide. Jansen supports his wife and helps her through withdrawal to recovery. Cast Production Hop, the Devil's Brew was the fourth picture produced by Bluebird Photoplays, a studio set up by Universal aimed at producing high-quality, feature-length dramas. Weber was inspired by a Saturday Evening Post series of articles by Rufus Steele about the government's war against the opium trade. It was one of a number of films she made during an arc in her career in which she focused on controversial social issues. It was shot on location in San Francisco, reportedly including Chinatown opium dens, the waterfront, and areas of criminal activity. According to the producers, the film was sanctioned by and made with the assistance of the U.S. Customs Service and the U.S. Secret Service. Scenes about illegal opium traffic and law enforcement methods were advertised as based on actual cases. Reception The film was released February 14, 1916, to critical approval. The Variety review observed, \\"To say that [the Smalleys] have done their work well would be doing them an injustice. They have turned out a picture that is chock full of interest and thrills ... every minute has something to further the plot.\\" Moving Picture World called it \\"excellent, considered either as dramatic entertainment, or as a faithful depiction of actual conditions\\" and praised the acting as \\"restrained\\" rather than \\"theatrical\\", doing credit to its authenticity. Although reviewers found the movie's treatment of the potentially lurid topic serious rather than exploitative, censors in Chicago and Pennsylvania objected to some elements. The Pennsylvania censors passed the opium-smoking scenes, but cut a close-up of the dead baby's shoes.

Its alternate version, \\"Hail to the Purple,\\" is an official song of the fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon. The song was written in 1910 by two students: Harold Vater Hill '11 (1889‚Äì1917), credited with the music, and Howard Ruggles Green '12 (1890‚Äì1969), credited with the lyrics. History In the summer of 1910, Hill and Green composed and entered \\"Hail to the Orange\\" and several other songs into a contest for a student-composed opera. The opera was never finished, so the two attempted to sell the musical numbers to a publisher. They managed to sell \\"Oskee Wow-Wow\\" to Charley Graham, the manager of the U. of I. Supply Store (also known as the Co-Op) for $100; however, Graham refused to accept \\"Hail to the Orange\\" even as a gift to be printed on the cover of \\"Oskee Wow-Wow,\\" citing the song's lack of \\"punch.\\" Hill and Green rewrote the song and gave it to the national secretary of their fraternity, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, who copyrighted it in 1915 and published it in the fraternity songbook. \\"Hail to the Purple\\" has been an essential song for the fraternity's chapters ever since. The original version, \\"Hail to the Orange,\\" was first sung by a fraternity quartet at the 1911 Post- Exam Jubilee. It grew in favor through continued presentations at various glee contests. The song quickly became an essential symbol of school spirit, being published in several official university songbooks and sung at hundreds of university events. Green returned to Champaign for the 1922 homecoming and to his surprise, \\"Hail to the Orange\\" had been enjoying brisk sales and neither he nor Hill were being credited as its authors. While he eventually managed to assign credit to himself and Hill as the songwriters, Green did not receive royalties from its sales until the U. of I. Supply Store's copyright expired‚Äîtwenty-eight years after he and Hill had written the song. In the 1950s, the status of \\"Hail to the Orange\\" as a school song became a point of controversy. Students debated whether the football stadium should stand up during performances of the song, yet opposing students argued that they should only stand when \\"Illinois Loyalty\\" is played, which they claimed was the official alma mater song. Supporting students claimed that \\"Hail to Orange\\" had been universally recognized by students, faculty, and alumni. So, in November 1958, the Men's Independent Association and the Interfraternity Council urged university president David Dodds Henry to replace \\"Illinois Loyalty\\" with \\"Hail to the Orange\\" as the official alma mater song. It was discovered from this letter that \\"Illinois Loyalty\\" was never officially recognized by the university, but rather \\"For Good Old Illinois,\\" by Vernon Thompson Stevens was recognized in 1916. President Henry believed that legislation of the issue could only occur when all interested groups have engaged in widespread discussion and come to an agreement. In February 1959, he asked the Alumni Board of the Alumni Association and the university's Student Senate to begin the discussion. By March, President Henry announced that the university would not be making any decisions regarding official school songs. \\"Illinois Loyalty\\" and \\"Hail to the Orange\\" would remain in competition with \\"For Good Old Illinois\\" for the title of \\"official alma mater song.\\" Lyrics The lyrics as written by Green for \\"Hail to the Orange\\" are: The lyrics as written by Green for \\"Hail to the Purple\\" are: Media The Marching Illini first played \\"Hail to the Orange\\" in 1922 and has since integrated the song into their standard repertoire. It is performed as part of \\"Three in One\\" at the end of each halftime performance. It is also sung a cappella in 4-part harmony before the band is dismissed at the end of the post-game concert following each home game. In 1938, Hill's sister, Frances Hill Arms, presented Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Illinois Beta chapter with a bronze tablet honoring his musical contributions to the fraternity and the university. In August 1964, Green was awarded the Merit Key Award and a Citation from Sigma Alpha Epsilon for his co-authorship of \\"Violets\\" and \\"Hail to the Purple,\\" two of the fraternity's most popular songs. In October 1966, Green was presented with another award, this time from the University of Illinois Alumni Association for his co-authorship of \\"Hail to the Orange.\\" \\"Hail to the Orange\\" is played (typically at the beginning) of every Altgeld Chimes concert since the 1960s.

He is well known for his realist paintings of Tibetans. Chen graduated from China Central Academy of Fine Arts. Because his grandfather moved to Taiwan with the Nationalist government, he also had citizenship in the Republic of China. He moved to the United States in the 1982 and became a citizen there.  Life  Chen Danqing's family home is Taishan, Guangdong province. He started learning oil painting in secondary school, and acquainted himself with young artists like Chen Yifei and Xia Baoyuan. Time in China In the 1970s, after he graduated from his secondary school at the age of 16 and was forced to go to the countryside of southern Ganzhou. Later, with the help of Chen Yifei, he moved to the suburbs of Nanjing and settled down there. During this period, his completed works include \\"Writing a Letter to Chairman Mao\\" (a painting that expresses the aspiration of youths to stay in rural area), \\"Tears Flooding the Autumnal Fields \\", and a number of oil paintings and Lianhuanhua works on the topic of Chinese Civil War. Well known within the artistic community, his sketches were imitated by his peers and later scholars. With the restoration of the National Higher Education Entrance Examination in 1978 after the ending of the Cultural Revolution, Chen Danqing was admitted to the oil paintings department of China Central Academy of Fine Arts as a graduate student. He stayed and taught at the school after his graduation in 1980. In the same year, his thesis work, \\"Tibetan Paintings\\", received much wider recognition than any of his previous works, making Chen a noteworthy Chinese artist. Moving to the U.S. In 1982, Chen moved to New York City, United States, to be a professional painter. In the early 1980s, Chen painted in the Socialist Realist style and was at one stage described by the government as the most talented oil painter in China. Beginning with his series of paintings about Tibetans in the mid-1980s, Chen began to lose official support for his work. Chen was represented exclusively by Wally Findlay Galleries in New York, Palm Beach, Beverly Hills and Paris. Influenced by French Realist Jean-Francois Millet, his Tibetans series had a tremendous influence on the emerging Native Soil Painting movement. This new work departed from the size of his earlier Socialist Realist painting in favor of the intimate style and scale of the nineteenth-century French naturalists. He portrayed the Tibetans in a dignified, forthright way, avoiding the patronizing depictions of ethnic minorities common at the time. Chen's later work retained the sharp, realistic qualities of the Tibetan series, and has often focused on portrayals of young women. Returning from the U.S. to China Chen returned to China in 2000 as a professor at Tsinghua University Academy of Fine Arts and doctoral supervisor. In October 2004, because of dissatisfaction with enrollment system, he resigned from Tsinghua Academy. Chen has published essays \\"New York Suo ji (2000)\\", \\"Chen Music Notes (2002)\\", \\"The Extra Material (2003)\\", \\"Step Backwards Set (2004), \\"Collection of Serial on the Back (2007), \\"Waste Collection (2009)\\" on education and urban problems. Chen participated in the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games opening ceremony with planning, design, and creating prose written in the book of zhang.  Description of artwork  Chen is well known for his Realist paintings and garnered critical acclaim for his portraits of Tibetans. His earliest artwork from the 1970s included sketches, and Chen learned oil painting in secondary school. In 1976, he traveled to Tibet, the place where has a significant influence to his future art developments. The trip to Tibet inspired him to make a number of paintings about the ethnic minorities of the nation ('Tibetans paintings/series'). Tibetan paintings In 1978, Chen Danqing was admitted to the Central Academy of Painting graduate classes. In 1980, he created a stack of seven paintings and sketches as a graduation creation in Tibet. These paintings are: Mother and Child, Pilgrimage, One City, Shepherd, City of the Two, Shampoo, and Kamba Man. Later convention to collectively as \\"Tibetan paintings.\\" The \\"Tibetan paintings,\\" caused a great shock in the art community. The \\"Tibetan paintings\\" continue to get attention, commentary, research, and renowned at home and abroad. \\"Tibetan paintings,\\" are recognized as China realist paintings, distinct from the former Soviet influence. Meanwhile, the \\"Tibetan paintings\\" focus on the vision side, non-heroic, non-themed real life. Still Life In 1995, Chen completed a set of 15 meters long and two meters high ten-linked painting Still Life, a contemporary installation art.

He started painting during the 1960s and the 1970s. While Kwan did not work with just one single style in his artworks, his main focus was on oil paintings. In 1972, Kwan moved to the United States to study Art and Design. He lived and worked in New York City. Kwan returned to Hong Kong in 1997 and taught at Hong Kong Polytechnic University. He received awards from the Ford Foundation for excellent works in 1978 and National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship for artists (1995/96) in the U.S. Since 1971, Kwan has organized several solo exhibitions in Hong Kong and New York and group exhibitions in Hong Kong, Korea, the United States and Macau. In 2000, Kwan worked in Fanling studio and worked as part-time tutor in Chinese University in 2001.  Early life  In Mr. Jerry Kwan's early life, he used oil painting to be his major medium expression to himself. In the 1970s, he left for the United States for further studies in fine arts and graduate in the Columbus College of Art and Design, Ohio, and the Syracuse University, New York. He stayed in US around twenty years. And he joined many exhibitions that were awarded the National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship in 1995. In 1997, he came back to Hong Kong. Besides of his working on painting, he also became a mentor in Polytechnic University, the Art School of Hong Kong Arts Centre and the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In May 2008, Kwan died. His friends in the painting community and his students remember him by holding an exhibition for him. The exhibition will display works of Mr. Kwan, many are shown on a loan basis with the kind consent of galleries and friends, as well as related articles, photos and information. It will not only provide a broad view of the creations of Mr. Kwan, a core figure of our art scene, but also an opportunity to look at the life of an enthusiastic and committed artist.  Career: Art and design  Dedicated to his life to art making, Jerry used oil painting as his major medium of expression in his artwork. He claimed that he had no interest to create his artwork with strong individualistic. Also, he did not have the fixed topics and ideas in his artwork because he attempted to find out new topics and ideas for his artwork in his lifetime. Long Tin has described Jerry as an artist who lures people to misread him and his artwork. You can get the meaning of different social issues from the artwork of Jerry. For example, he made the series of the artwork of insert to represent different social issues at that time after his return to Hong Kong in 2000s.

The timber loft building, which lines the north side of Ogden Slip, was originally named Pugh Terminal and used as a wholesale exhibition center predating the Merchandise Mart. It was redeveloped into commercial uses as part of Cityfront Center, a 1985 master plan for 50 acres of what were industrial and port facilities in south Streeterville. The renovation was proposed in 1987 by Robert Meers, who envisioned it was \\"not a festival market, but a specialized retailing center,\\" complementary to Navy Pier or the Magnificent Mile, a few blocks east or west. Other developers proposed apartments within the building instead. When completed in 1990, North Pier featured three levels of retailers on the lower levels, centered on a rotunda, and four floors of offices above. Waterfront restaurants lined Ogden Slip south of the building on the building's lowest level, while the primary entrance from Illinois Street led up a few stairs to the second level of the mall. The adjacent North Pier Apartments tower was also completed in 1990. Occupancy was never strong: the mall lacked strong anchor tenants, the adapted industrial facade along Illinois Street lacked clear entrances and views inside, and the half-built-out surroundings dissuaded foot traffic. \\"The property never lived up to expectations,\\" as a local business newspaper wrote, even after it was renamed River East Plaza in 1997 and marketed to artists and art galleries. In 2013, it was purchased out of bankruptcy court by a developer who subsequently converted the building into the Lofts at River East apartments and closed the interior mall. Two floors of exterior-facing retail remain: an upper level facing Illinois Street and a lower level facing Ogden Slip. As of 2015, anchor tenants include a Target Express and a Pinstripes bowling alley.

She is also remembered for establishing the first Mexican institution for training social workers in 1936. Biography Born in 1883 in Galeana, Nuevo Le√≥n, Nava attended the state's teachers' training college and in 1900, became headmistress of the high school in Tula, Tamaulipas. In 1904, she helped establish La Sociedad Protectora de la Mujer, known for being Mexico City's oldest feminist society. In 1909, in Mexico City, she took part in activities opposing the government of Porfirio D√≠az. Together with Dolores Jim√©nez Muro, she drafted anti-government articles in Cuautla and other cities in the state of Morelos. In 1910, she and Muro founded the Club Femenil Antirreeleccionista Hijas de Cuauht√©moc (Anti-Reelectionist Women's Club: Daughters of Cuauht√©moc). The arrest of her husband was hastened by the meetings that she organized at their house. She contributed to opposition newspapers in Mexico City including Diario del Hogar. In 1913, she fought against Victoriano Huerta earning the title of Veteran of the Revolution. She was working as a teacher, but she was also distributing seditious pamphlets in the city that had been printed by Mar√≠a Arias Bernal. She and Muro also wrote a manifesto against Huerta, Aureliano Blanquet and F√©lix D√≠az. Eventually, the two of them left the state capital to become Zapatistas and to raise money for their cause. Muro was made a colonel whilst she was put in charge of communication with the forces in Teziutlan. They were both commissioned to carry out tasks by Emiliano Zapata She is also remembered for founding the Centro Feminista Mexicano, the country's first feminist association, and for being an organizer of the Club Femenil Antireeleccionista \\"Hijas de Cuauhtemoc\\", a group of revolutionary women opposed to the re-election of Bernardo Reyes. Because of her defense of the maderism movement and for her public condemnation of General Victoriano Huerta, Nava was put in jail. Upon her release, she continued to oppose Huerta and continued to support the idea of a society led by workers. Nava was an active member of the Consejo Feminista Mexicano (Mexican Feminist Council) where she edited the fortnightly journal, La mujer y la vida (Woman and Life) from 1921. In 1922, together with Mar√≠a Penteria Meza, she represented the Feminist Council at the Pan-American Women's Conference in Baltimore which was also attended by the Mexican delegates Elena Torres, Eulalia Guzm√°n and Luz Vera. Contribution to social work Nava founded Mexico's first educational institution for social work, the Escuela de Ense√±anza Dom√©stica (Domestic Education School). Preparatory work had started in 1926 but official recognition came only on 2 February 1933. In that year, the Secretariat of Public Education founded a social study program, and Nava taught it. The school was inspired by Nava's visit to the US where she had been in touch with schools for social workers. Thanks to the impetus of the school, the profession became recognized in Mexico as women began to take up employment as social workers in 1936. Selected works In addition to her essays and journal articles, Julia Nava de Ruis√°nchez published the following: *1923: Mis cuentos, M√©xico, Cultura *1935: Dramatizaciones de leyenda mexicanas y cuentos populares, M√©xico, 1935 References Category:1883 births Category:1964 deaths Category:Mexican activists Category:Mexican feminists Category:Mexican women activists Category:People from Galeana, Nuevo Le√≥n Category:Mexican women writers Category:Mexican feminist writers Category:20th-century Mexican writers Category:20th-century Mexican women writers ","title":"Julia Nava de Ruis√°nchez"},{"id":"45713982","text":"Puri Oil Mills Limited is an Indian public limited company manufacturing Mustard Oil along with a wide range of mustard-based value-added products under the registered brand name of P Mark Mustard Oil.

It is a medium to tall tree with papery bark, silvery new growth and white or greenish flower spikes. It has important uses as a source of cajuput oil. Description Melaleuca cajuputi is usually a medium to large tree, often growing to and sometimes to with grey, brownish or whitish papery bark. The new growth is silky-hairy, becoming glabrous as it matures. The leaves are arranged alternately long and wide, tapering at both ends. The flowers are white, cream or greenish-yellow mostly in dense spikes at the ends of the branches which continue to grow after flowering but also often in the axils of the upper leaves. The spikes contain 8 to 20 groups of flowers, each group with three flowers. The stamens are grouped in five bundles around the flower, each bundle containing 6 to 18 stamens. Timing of flowering varies with subspecies. The fruits are woody, cup-shaped capsules clustered loosely along the branches, each fruit long.M. cajuputi habit Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca cajuputi was first formally described in 1809 by Thomas Powell in Pharmacopoeia of the Royal College of Physicians of London with a reference to an earlier (1747) description by Rumphius in Herbarium Amboinense. The specific epithet (cajuputi) is \\"probably a corruption of the Indonesian name for the plant, kayu putih\\". Subspecies There are 3 subspecies: *Melaleuca cajuputi Powell subsp. cajuputi: The nominate subspecies has leaves wide, 7 to 10 stamens per bundle and flowers from March to November. *Melaleuca cajuputi subsp. cumingiana (Turcz.) Barlow: This subspecies flowers from February to December and has leaves long and wide and there are 7 to 9 stamens per bundle. *Melaleuca cajuputi subsp. platyphylla Barlow: This subspecies has leaves ( wide), more stamens (8‚Äì13 per bundle) and flowers from January to May and August to September. The name platyphylla is from the Greek platys meaning \\"flat\\", \\"broad\\", \\"wide\\" or \\"level\\" and phyllon meaning ‚Äúleaf‚Äù. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca cajuputi Powell subsp. cajuputi occurs in the Dampier Peninsula, Calder River, Fitzroy Crossing district in the Central Kimberley biogeographic zone in Western Australia, the northern part of the Northern Territory, and East Timor. It grows in woodland, vine forest, gallery forest and savannah forest, on clayey and peaty loam. Melaleuca cajuputi subsp. cumingiana (Turcz.) Barlow occurs in Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia (Sumatra, West Java and south-west Kalimantan). The name cumingiana is \\"in honour of Hugh Cuming\\". It grows in coastal swamp forest. In Thailand, the species is known as White Samet. Melaleuca cajuputi subsp. platyphylla Barlow occurs in New Guinea, the Torres Strait islands and north-western Queensland as far south as Cairns. It grows in similar habitats to subsp. cajuputi. Uses Timber In Southeast Asia, Melaleuca cajuputi is used as a fuel and for making charcoal. It is used on a small scale for supporting columns, frames and floorboards in house construction and for fences. The bark has been used as roofing material and a sealant in boat construction including as a caulking material for boats in Indonesia. Essential oils Indigenous Australian people used the leaves of this species to treat aches and pains and inhaled vapours from the crushed leaves to treat respiratory infections. In Thailand the leaves are used to make a herbal tea as a treatment for a range of medical problems. In many parts of Asia, the oil which gives the tree its name - cajuput oil is used as a liniment and inhalant. Commercial cajuput oil is mostly obtained from Melaleuca cajuputi subsp. cajuputi. This oil is a pale yellow liquid and contains up to 60% 1,8-cineole, the main antimicrobial component of the oil . Cajuput oil has been classified as non-toxic and non- sensitizing, although skin irritation may occur at high concentrations. It has been reported to be useful as an insect repellant, as a sedative and relaxant and is useful in treating roundworms and urino-genital infections. It is used to flavour foods and to add to the fragrance of soaps and cosmetics.

It differs from Collectivism in that whilst eclectic social work uses differ parts of a variety of social work theories and models, integrative social work seeks to blend different theories, models, and methods into a personalised and coherent approach that provides lasting solutions to the problems and situations of individuals. An example occurs in working with children who are in conflict with the law. A social worker, to ensure effective problem solving does not only deal with the juvenile, but also must involve the family or families involved and the community in which the child lives. To add to his or her knowledge base of solving such problems, the social worker thus needs to conduct social research and administration. In integrated social work, there is a need to use these social methods together with the theories, values, and ethics of social work practice.

Perceived shortages and inflation led the residents there to respond with the \\"Recover Sheung Shui\\" campaign to protest this situation in 2012. However, the parallel traders' sphere of activity expanded to Tuen Mun, Sha Tin and Yuen Long due to the convenience of transportation and led to the \\"liberate\\" activities of these districts. Development Around 200 people gathered at Long Ping Station at 3:30 pm and arrived Sau Fu Street at 4 pm. At 4:15 pm, protesters tried to break the police line and pushed against the pro-parallel trading elements on Sau Fu Street, when the police used pepper spray without warning. Some pro- parallel trading people were using foul language and threw their fists at the protesters. Several people were arrested by the police, including a girl who was bleeding on her face. At 4:30 pm, more than 50 members of Civic Passion regrouped and demanded for the abolition of the multiple entry visa policy. The dispute between the pro- and anti-parallel trading elements continued as the group moved to Tung Lok Street at 5:15 pm. At 6 pm, people gathered on the Yuen Long Main Road and halted the traffic. Some protesters started to set up some obstacles, such as rubbish bins at the centre. From 7 to 8 pm, dozens of anti-parallel trading groups marched from Yuen Long Main Road to Kau Yuk Road and attempted to occupy the area. Many protesters still stayed in the protest zone at 10:30 pm.LONG REDEMPTION The police used pepper spray 21 times to control the chaotic situation. Later, the police has arrested 36 men and 2 women, aged from 13 to 74, who involved in common assault, assaulting police and possession of weapons. Also, five police officers were injured and had to receive treatment in hospital. Effect The host hopes to add more pressure to the government to face the problem of parallel traders. Recently, the government addressed that it had sent a proposal to the Beijing authority to regulate the \\"multiple-entry permit\\" plan, which reveals the protest was effective. Also, after the protest, the conflicts between Hongkongers and mainlanders intensified so parallel traders stopped smuggling and decreased the frequency of travelling to Hong Kong. Some shops were forced to close because of the chaos. Since too many people gathered together and scuffles broke out. Some managers closed their shops to ensure their safety and that more or less badly affected their operation.01MAR2015 ÂÖâÂæ©ÂÖÉÊúó ÂèóÂΩ±ÈüøËêΩÈñòÂïÜÊà∂Ë®™Âïè About 30 shops had been forced to close. Also, members of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce could sue over their losses. Meanwhile, the traffic was blocked by the protesters. owing to the large number of people and narrow pavement, some protesters were forced to stand at the highway and needed police to direct the traffic.01MAR2015 ÂÖâÂæ©ÂÖÉÊúóÈÉ®‰ªΩÁèæÂ†¥ÊÉÖÊ≥Å The traffic of Yuen Long Main Road was suspended because protesters occupied the area there. Response Government Hong Kong Secretary for Security Lai Tung-kwok, said public could express their views within the confines of the law. Police definitely would not tolerate illegal behaviour, and would enforce the law. He also added that the authority would continue to combat related offences. Hong Kong Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Gregory So Kam-leung, emphasises that the Individual Visit Scheme is important to Hong Kong. The authority cannot change the policy. He also added that cancelling \\"multiple-entry permit\\" scheme these proposals are substantial adjustments, the authority needs to consider carefully. Also, he thinks public should not confuse parallel trader with visitors. Mainland Chinese media The Xinhua News Agency had reported the Liberate Yuen Long Protests. It reported that some of the Hong Kong individual radical groups launch Liberte Yuen Long Campaign will bring about the nuisance to merchant in Yuen Long. Also, Hong Kong residence and some community organisation expressed great indignation to those demonstrators, and require that police would enforce the law firmly. Shap Pat Heung Rural Committee Before the demonstration, the chairperson of Shap Pat Heung Rural Committee threatened that villagers had been overwhelmed and surrounded protesters when they stepped out Long Ping Station. They could not take any advantages if their behaved violently. Villagers could counterattack tenfold. In addition, five hundred police had been stood by to cope with the protest. Yuen Long residents Some of the Yuen Long residents were dissatisfied with the parallel traders. A local opined that parallel traders caused road congestions which brought about traffic problems, and because of the increasing number of pharmacies and gold shops aimed at parallel traders instead of shops aimed at locals, he hoped multiple-entry permits should be revoked. Some local residents did not agree with this campaign and believed the protesters were \\"stirring up trouble\\". Follow-up action On 8 March, some Internet users organised the fourth \\"liberate\\" action‚ÄîVisiting Sheung Shui through social networking group. The aim of this operation was similar to the previous demonstration. At 4 pm, protesters responded to the exhortation from organizers and went to Tuen Mun. They demonstrated by shouting slogans loudly in different shopping malls. Some citizens caused chaos and collided with parallel traders near B3X bus stop. At night, about 30 protesters went to Hong Kong Clock Tower continue demonstration. Finally, they were stopped by police and dismissed. The police arrested 7 people in total, aged 13 to 21.

The tunnel was constructed in 1793 by Benjamin Outram as part of the Butterley Gangroad, altered in the 1840s, and remained in use until the railway closed in 1933. It is a scheduled monument. History Tramway embankment at Bobbinmill Hill Butterley Gangroad linked Hilt's Quarry and other limestone quarries at Crich with the Cromford Canal at Bullbridge. The first railway project of Derbyshire civil engineer Benjamin Outram (1764‚Äì1805), the line was originally a horse-drawn and gravity-driven plateway, a form of tramway that Outram popularised. The line was constructed in 1793, with the tunnel being required to go under a road junction in Fritchley. In the 1840s, upgrading took place to accommodate steam locomotives, and part of the original line was moved. The southern part of the tunnel was rebuilt with an entrance slightly to the west of the original one. The tunnel's walls bear evidence of these changes. The railway remained in use until 1933. During World War II, Fritchley Tunnel was used as an air raid shelter. The tunnel was sealed up in 1977, and by 1989 both entrances were buried. It was temporarily uncovered during archaeological work on the Butterley Gangroad by Derbyshire Archaeological Society in February 2013. In February 2015, the tunnel was designated a scheduled monument under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. The designation states that the tunnel is \\"recognised as the earliest surviving railway tunnel in the world and an important representation of tunnel engineering at this time.\\" Description The tunnel is located at the junction of Chapel Street with Bobbinmill Hill and Front Street (), near to Riverside Cottage, in the village of Fritchley. It runs under Chapel Street in a broadly north‚Äìsouth direction for , with a height of . The tunnel is constructed from blocks of sandstone. A bend and joint in the stonework is located from the northern end, which is believed to mark the end of the original (northern) section, dating from 1793. At the point where the two sections join, part of the north-east wall has been repaired or strengthened using brick. The roof is arched, with a circular cross section, and is supported on vertical sides. The tunnel walls have gaps, believed to represent holes left by timbers used in building the arch. The north and south entrances have a semi-circular arch; the voussoirs are each constructed from one course of stone blocks. The northern entrance has a stone wall above it that forms a parapet beside Chapel Street. Both ends of the tunnel have been blocked; the northern end with soil, and the southern end with a modern red-brick structure on top of an older stone structure. The interior of the tunnel is coated with soot and bears markings from sleepers. One surviving stone sleeper has been discovered immediately south of the tunnel, with an attached iron spike that was used to retain the rails. Near to the sleeper lies a soil path showing wear consistent with use by horses as a towpath. The Grade-II-listed tramway embankment at Bobbinmill Hill, also part of the tramway at Fritchley, lies north of Fritchley Tunnel.

The Howard de Walden Estate is a property estate in Marylebone, London, owned by the Howard de Walden family. As of 2020 the estate was reported to be worth ¬£4.7 billion. History The Estate's high value dates from 1715 when Edward Harley, 2nd Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer began the expensive, speculative development of Cavendish Square in London, and the streets around it. It had been the semi-rural manor of Marylebone belonging to his wife's ancestors, the Dukes of Newcastle. This passed from Margaret Holles, n√©e Cavendish, daughter of the 2nd Duke of Newcastle, to her daughter Henrietta Cavendish Harley. At the death of Henrietta's husband, the 2nd Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer, in 1741, this new Harley Estate passed to his only daughter, Margaret Cavendish Harley, who in 1734 had married William Bentinck, 2nd Duke of Portland. It thus became known as the Portland Estate, and passed to successive Dukes in the family. In 1879, the 5th Duke of Portland died without issue and his estates were divided between his sisters, according to the terms of the 4th Duke's will, and his cousin, who succeeded him as the sixth Duke. The estate eventually passed to the last surviving sister, Lucy Ellis, who was the widow of the 6th Lord Howard de Walden and has remained, subject to own trustee- imposed protective restrictions, in that cognatic branch of the same family since. This marked its second cognatic succession, i.e. through women. Property The Estate covers 92 acres in which it holds the freehold to over 850 properties. As to homes, the Estate has mainly let them on long leases, which means it holds a minor, overarching interest. The main area extends north to Marylebone Road, west to Hallam Street and south to Wigmore Street. Its majority stake in the far east of Marylebone (bordering Fitzrovia) was sold in 1925 to Sir John Ellerman,Philip Temple & Colin Thom. \\"South-East Marylebone -- Draft chapters of Volumes 51 and 52\\" (PDF).

Black and yellow later became the colours used by the Imperial House of Habsburg as they held the title of Holy Roman Emperor over centuries and were themselves derived from the banner of the Holy Roman Empire. The original form of this flag featured a yellow background with a black double-headed eagle. However, this proved to be a complicated design and was hard to reproduce. In the 18th century, the simpler form with the yellow and black bars started to appear in the Habsburg Monarchy. With the end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1804, this flag was approved for use as a civil flag. The black-yellow flag was used in a way similar to a modern national flag of the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy within the Holy Roman Empire, the later Austrian Empire and the Austrian part of Austria-Hungary, sometimes still even used for the entire empire, until 1918. Beginning in the reign of Emperor Joseph II, the Austrian, later Austro- Hungarian Navy used a Naval Ensign (Marineflagge) based on the red-white-red colours, and augmented with a shield of similar colours. Both of this and the Black-Yellow flag became obsolete with Austria-Hungary's dissolution in 1918, and the newly formed rump state of German Austria adopted the red-white-red triband as its national flag.

New Indies Style () is a modern architectural style used in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) between the late 19th-century through pre- World War II 20th-century. New Indies Style is basically early modern (western) architecture (e.g. Rationalism and Art Deco), which applies local architectural elements such as wide eaves or prominent roof as an attempt to conform with the tropical climate of Indonesia. Even though New Indies Style refers specifically to the Dutch Rationalism movement that appeared in 1910s Indonesia, for the purpose of covering the many architectural styles that appeared during the brief early modern period, the term is used as a general term for all the architectural styles that appear between the late 19th- century to pre-World War II 20th-century. History The attempt to synthesize Dutch architecture with local Indonesian architecture had already started since the 18th-century. Heavy maintenance of the 17th-century Dutch- style buildings in the tropics had forced the Dutch to follow examples from indigenous architecture of Indonesia. The attempt first appears in the Dutch Indies country houses of the 18th and 19th-century, a style academically known as Indo-European (Indo-Europese) Style or Indies Style (Indisch Stijl), also Old Indies Style (Oud Indische Stijl) to distinguish it with the newer style. The birth of the New Indies Style was related with the introduction of new building material, the rise of Modernism and the introduction of the Agrarian Law of 1870 in Java. The new law opened Java to foreigners, enabling them to establish private enterprises in the Dutch East Indies. A new type of buildings, developments and standards have to be implemented in the Dutch East Indies. The colonial government, under the Departement voor Burgerlijke Openbare Werken (Public Works Department), developed new standards for the construction of buildings such as hospitals, schools, town halls, post offices, and other public utilities, to consider local (tropical) climate as a mean to reduce the cost of building construction and maintenance cost. One of the earliest example is The Harbour Master's Office in Semarang from early 19th-century example. Also influencing the New Indies Style were new generation of Dutch architects, trained in the Netherlands, who went to the Indies to introduce Modernism. In the 1910s, Dutch architects began experimenting with new material on traditional Dutch forms while developing a tropical-friendly architecture, bridging the evolution of architecture between the Traditionalists and Modernists in the Dutch East Indies. The 1920s and 1930s saw the advent of Modernism in the Dutch East Indies. Typical features included flat roofs and cubic forms, with minimal consideration of the tropics. Art Deco ornamentation was sometimes incorporated into the design. Albert Frederik Aalbers was one of the representatives of the Modern movement in Indonesia before the Second World War. His work is characterized by its clean-cut, functionalist elevations, which often feature curved lines, and the absence of external ornamentation and other purely decorative devices. In the same period, Nationalism manifested in the quest for a new style of architecture ‚Äì one that reflected the cultural identity of the region. Some architects began to temper the Modernist ethos by including indigenous architectural elements, thereby creating a distinctively Indonesian style of modern architecture. Maclaine Pont and Thomas Karsten were the leading exponents here. Architecture The term New Indies Style refers specifically to the type of architecture which appeared in the 1910s Dutch East Indies. During the brief transitional period in early 20th century, the style coexisted with other Modern architectural variants in the Dutch East Indies: Art Deco, Expressionist architecture, Nieuwe Zakelijkheid, etc. The styles represent technological progress during the brief pre-World War II period. New Indies Style In Indonesia, the term New Indies Style is an academically-accepted term for Dutch Rationalism. Similar with Dutch Rationalism, the style is the result of the attempt to develop new solutions to integrate traditional precedents (classicism) with new technological possibilities. It can be described as a transitional style between Traditionalists (the Indies Empire style) and the Modernists. In the Netherlands, the style was strongly influenced by the design of Berlage; this is reflected in Indonesia as well. Characteristically, New Indies Style is similar with Dutch Rationalism with its use of Romanesque-inspired arches while keeping the regularity of traditional Classicist form. The form began to show functional approach; decorations are reduced. Differences with the Western version is that in the Dutch East Indies, buildings are white-washed, contrasting the dominant brickwork of its Dutch counterpart. Other differences is the exaggerated roof eaves which form a significant overhang which protects any opening, a style that did not appear in the Dutch counterpart. New Indies Style employed the use of the 'double facade' concept which manifested in a covered gallery. The covered gallery is implemented not only in the ground level but also at the second floor. Double facade protects the facade from heavy rainfall and strong sunlight, an important feature of tropical design. Extensive openings in the form of multiple doors or high windows were done to allow cross ventilation to cool the interior. Several examples of building from this period are Citroen's Lawang Sewu (1907), Moojen's Kunstkring Art Gallery (1913) and Cirebon Kejaksan Station (1912).

Art Deco and Nieuwe Bouwen Art Deco in the Dutch East Indies was similarly influenced with Art Deco in the Netherlands. Art Deco evolved from earlier Berlage-type Rationalism. Characteristic include rich color, bold geometric shapes and ornamentation. The form is symmetrical and exudes technological progress and glamour. One of the earliest example of Art Deco appear in the design of the Semarang Poncol Station (1914). Examples of building of this style are Ghijsels's former KPM headquarters (1917) and Schoemaker's Jaarbeurs (1920). Gerber's Gedung Sate shows consideration of local architect in the form of its roof. Other variation in the period is Amsterdam School, a part of the international movement of Expressionism which appears around the 1920s as well. The style popularity is not as widespread as in the Netherlands, but influenced details of buildings in the Dutch East Indies. A form of Amsterdam School appear in Cirebon City Hall (1926) by J.J. Jiskoot with its expressive distorted form characteristic of Amsterdam School style.The City Hall of Cirebon Amsterdam School influence also appear in buildings designed by Schoemaker who often collaborates with sculptors: The expressive relief of Grand Preanger Hotel (1929) and the sculptures of Bandung Jaarbeurs (1920).

File:Cirebon_City_Hall.JPGCirebon City Hall (1926), an example for Amsterdam School style in the Indies. Later between 1920 and 1940, Art Deco evolved into a new style known in the Netherlands as Nieuwe Bouwen (Modernism) or Functionalism. The new architectural movement is largely influenced by German's Bauhaus and France's Le Corbusier. Instead of creating style on the facade, the architect creates style in the clear and logical arrangement of space. The preference is to use universal form such as cube or cylinder or curving horizontal lines and nautical motifs that are known as Streamline Moderne in the Anglophone world. Industrialization and material standardization plays a role. Albert Aalbers is the most representative expression of Nieuwe Bouwen in Indonesia, apparent in his design for Savoy Homann Hotel (1939), Denis Bank (1936), and the \\"Driekleur\\" (1937) in Bandung. In Indonesia, the style is characterized by its openness, the sleek facade lines, and strong spatial effect on the exterior and retreat of curtain wall. Many buildings employing this variation of Art Deco still exist in Bandung, one of the largest remaining collections of Streamline Moderne - Art Deco buildings in the world. Other examples of Nieuwe Bouwen in Indonesia are the works of Cosma Citroen, K. Bos, W. Lemei, Liem Bwan Tjie and some buildings of AIA Bureau of Schoemaker, namely Bandung Jaarbeurs, which he designed shortly after his study trip to America, clearly inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright. Also Villa Isola shows strong influence of Nieuwe Bouwen in its steel framing construction, steel windows, and reinforced concrete.

File:Savoy_Homann_Hotel_Front.JPGSavoy Homann Hotel employs Streamline Moderne element in its facade. File:Bank Jawa Barat.jpgBank BJB of Bandung shows expressive Nieuwe Bouwen form. By the end of 1920s, Nieuwe Zakelijkheid (\\"New Objectivity\\") became popular in the Dutch East Indies. The form was even more austere and reduced than its predecessor, employing angular shapes and designs that are essentially free of decoration. The style shows early transition into International Style. Earliest example of this is Bank Mandiri Museum (1929), built under a well-planned spatial planning around the station square Waterlooplein of Kota Station, a sample of pre-World War II urban planning which for Southeast Asia was completely unprecedented and new. Other notable examples is Palembang City Hall (Snuyf, 1928-1931, nicknamed Gedung Ledeng, Indonesian \\"plumb building\\") and Kota Post Office Building (Baumgartner, 1929).

Neo vernacular form Karsten's early attempt in producing an overtly Javanese form in Pasar Gede Harjonagoro. In the Netherlands, the modernist and functionalist Nieuwe Bouwen presents a stark contrast with the traditionalist Delft School. Delft School in the Netherlands is expressed as modern architecture with humble simple look inspired by the old houses of Dutch countryside. Delft School does not appear in Indonesia, however it can be defined as a 20th-century architecture style which conforms toward the traditional tropical consideration ‚Äì Indies architecture (Indische architectuur). Despite the strong contrast between Nieuwe Bouwen and Indische architectuur, both styles shared the thrust of overcoming the Empire architecture style and symbolic remnants of the 19th century's colonial feudal lords. This new school of thought and design with strongly implement traditional elements using 20th-century technologies and Modernist architectural principles from Europe appeared mainly in the 1920s and 1930s. Indigenous roofs were singled out for particular attention and there were many interesting syntheses of local and European forms and construction techniques. The interest of Modernists in the dynamic interplay of geometrical elements was soon incorporated into the new style and led to bold experiments that combined these structural forms with traditional vernacular ornamentation. Thomas Karsten and Henri Maclaine Pont were among the architects active in developing this movement. One example is the former offices of the Dutch steamtram company Joana Stoomtram Maatschappij in Semarang by Thomas Karsten (1930). The ground plan of this single-storeyed building is identical to that of a traditional Javanese Joglo: tall columns support a hipped, two-tiered roof, which facilitates cross ventilation of the roof cavity. The ceremonial hall of Bandung Institute of Technology shows mix of Batak architecture Notable examples of this movement appear in Maclaine Pont's design for the ceremonial halls of the Technische Hoogeschool te Bandung (which became Institut Teknologi Bandung). The building features an eclectic synthesis of various Indonesian local forms, including the architecture of Lake Toba, the Mentawai islands, and Sunda. The building is a striking example of innovative tropical architecture. With an elongated elevation aligned on an east-west axis, the building is provided with effective natural ventilation. This orientation also minimizes the effect of solar radiation in that the morning and afternoon sun only strikes the narrow end facades of the building. The external galleries of the building create a double facade which shield the interior from direct sunlight, while cooling towers at either end ensure good ventilation. Other example is the guesthouse of the Bataafsche Petroleum Maatschappij in Brastagi (1939) by Herman van den Houvel of the Langereis & Co architecture firm.

Native architects during colonial period During the colonial period, there were already native Indonesian architects. Graduated from the Technische Hoogeschool in Bandung, these Indonesian natives were either employed by Dutch architects, or established their own design practice. Among these were Anwari and Sukarno (who later became the first president of the Republic of Indonesia) and who studied architecture at Bandung's Technische Hoogeschool in 1920. Civil engineer Roosseno, who collaborated briefly with Sukarno in 1931, carried out his own construction company from 1932. One of the first design coming from an Indonesian native architect was the house of Dr. Han Tiauw Tjong in Semarang (1932), designed by architect Liem Bwan Tjie. Liem Bwan Tjie came from the Peranakan Chinese family in Semarang. In addition to designing private houses, agency houses and offices, Liem Bwan Tjie also created designs for public facilities e.g. cinemas, swimming pool, hospitals and grave monuments. One of his largest assignment is the hospital complex at Karang Panjang, Ambon City (1963‚Äì1964). Other Indonesian architects active during the period were Sudarsono, Soehamir and Silaban. Silaban worked as Head of the Genie in Pontianak, West Kalimantan from 1937, was appointed as Director of the Municipal Works of Bogor in 1942 at the beginning of World War. He completed this position until 1965, interrupted in 1951 for one year architectural study at Academie van Bouwkunst in Amsterdam. He would become one of Indonesia's most renowned architects when his design for the largest mosque in Southeast Asia was chosen. Post-colonial period After 1949, few European or European-trained architects and urban planners remained in newly independent Republic of Indonesia. A few remaining architects, such as Blankenberg, Kreisler, Liem and L√ºning, designed new town and buildings with their Indonesian colleagues. After the New Guinea issue, all Dutch people who had not opted for Indonesian citizenship were repatriated in 1957. Some Dutch architectural firms were closed or nationalized as a result of this policy. One of the few remaining architects who chose Indonesian citizenship was Han Groenewegen, who assisted the Indonesian architect Frederich Silaban in the design of Bank Indonesia in Thamrin Road, Jakarta.

It is developed by Dynardo GmbH and provides a framework for numerical Robust Design Optimization (RDO) and stochastic analysis by identifying variables which contribute most to a predefined optimization goal. This includes also the evaluation of robustness, i.e. the sensitivity towards scatter of design variables or random fluctuations of parameters. In 2019, Dynardo GmbH was acquired by Ansys.https://www.ansys.com/about-ansys/news-center/10-24-19-ansys-and- dynardo-sign-definitive-acquisition-agreement  Methodology  Sensitivity analysis: Representing continuous optimization variables by uniform distributions without variable interactions, variance based sensitivity analysis quantifies the contribution of the optimization variables for a possible improvement of the model responses. In contrast to local derivative based sensitivity methods, the variance based approach quantifies the contribution with respect to the defined variable ranges. Coefficient of Prognosis (CoP) The CoP is a model independent measure to assess the model quality and is defined as follows: CoP = 1 - \\\\frac{SS_E^{\\\\text{pred}}}{SS_T} Where SS_E^{\\\\text{pred}} is the sum of squared prediction errors. These errors are estimated based on cross validation. In the cross validation procedure, the set of support points is mapped to q subsets. Then the approximation model is built by removing subset i from the support points and approximating the subset model output y_i using the remaining point set. This means that the model quality is estimated only at those points which are not used to build the approximation model. Since the prediction error is used instead of the fit, this approach applies to regression and even interpolation models. Metamodel of Optimal Prognosis (MOP): The prediction quality of an approximation model may be improved if unimportant variables are removed from the model. This idea is adopted in the Metamodel of Optimal Prognosis (MOP) which is based on the search for the optimal input variable set and the most appropriate approximation model (polynomial or Moving Least Squares with linear or quadratic basis). Due to the model independence and objectivity of the CoP measure, it is well suited to compare the different models in the different subspaces. Multi-disciplinary optimization: The optimal variable subspace and approximation model found by a CoP/MOP procedure can also be used for a pre-optimization before global optimizers (evolutionary algorithms, Adaptive Response Surface Methods, Gradient-based methods, biological-based methods) are used for a direct single-objective optimization. After conducting a sensitivity analysis using MOP/CoP, also a multi-objective optimization can be performed to determine the optimization potential within opposing objectives and to derive suitable weighting factors for a following single-objective optimization. Finally this single-objective optimization determines an optimal design. Robustness evaluation: In variance-based robustness analysis, the variations of the critical model responses are investigated. In optiSLang, random sampling methods are used to generate discrete samples of the joined probability density function of the given random variables. Based on these samples, which are evaluated by the solver similarly as in the sensitivity analysis, the statistical properties of the model responses as mean value, standard deviation, quantiles and higher order stochastic moments are estimated. Reliability analysis: Within the framework of probabilistic safety assessment or reliability analysis, the scattering influences are modelled as random variables, which are defined by distribution type, stochastic moments and mutual correlations. The result of the analysis is the complementary of reliability, the probability of failure, which can be represented on a logarithmic scale. Process integration optiSLang is designed to use several solvers to investigate mechanical, mathematical, technical and any other quantifiable problems. Herein optiSLang provides direct interfaces for external programs: * ANSYS * MATLAB * GNU Octave * Excel * OpenOffice Calc * Python * Abaqus * SimulationX * CATIA * LS-DYNA * multiPlas * any software with text-based input definition  History  Since the 1980s, research teams at the University of Innsbruck and Bauhaus-Universit√§t Weimar had been developing algorithms for optimization and reliability analysis in conjunction with finite element simulations. As a result, the software \\"Structural Language (SLang)\\" was created. In 2000, CAE engineers first applied it to conducted optimization and robustness analysis in the automotive industry. In 2001, the Dynardo GmbH was founded in 2003. Based on SLang, the software optiSLang was launched as an industrial solution for CAE-based sensitivity analysis, optimization, robustness evaluation and reliability analysis. In 2013, the current version optiSLang 4 was completely restructured with a new graphical user interface and extended interfaces to external CAE processes.

The bookbinding aspect of the business included a bindery.  History   16th century  The F√ºrstlich S√§chsische Hofdruckerei, the ducal printing press, was established at the Hartenfels Castle (de) in Torgau in 1594 by appointment of Friedrich Wilhelm I, Duke of Saxe-Weimar (1562‚Äì1602). \\"F√ºrstlich S√§chsische\\" roughly translates to \\"Prince of Saxony.\\" The German prefix \\"Hof,\\" an abbreviation for \\"Hoflieferant,\\" denotes a royal appointment. The German word \\"druckerie\\" translates to \\"printer.\\" The earliest extant publication is Torgauer Katechismus (Torgau Catechism) (circa 1594‚Äì95).  17th century  In 1604, after the duke's death, the press moved to Altenburg. The earliest extant published work from the Altenburg press is Lotio Pedum (1606). In 1668, Gottfried Richter (1633‚Äì1696) received the book printing concession and, two years later, received the privilege of being a court publisher. During this period, his printing press was among the 20 known to produce the Biblia Germanica, the Luther Bible (1676), with the woodcut engravings of Jakob Mores (M√∂rs) (lived approx. 1540‚Äì1612).  18th century  In 1709, Johann Ludwig Richter, one of Gottfried's sons, purchased the royal publishing house from Duke Ernest and, henceforth, it became known as Richter'sche Hofbuchdruckerei. Johann Ludwig Richter was appointed F.S. (F√ºrstlich S√§chsischer) Hoff-buchdruckern and headed the firm until his death in 1736. His son, Paul Emanuel Richter, ran it from 1736 to 1742. The last owner, Karl Heinrich Emanuel Richter (1778‚Äì1800?), was young when he won control of the firm. Due partly to his inexperience and partly to a downturn in the economy, K.H.E. Richter sold the Hofbuchdruckdruckerei in 1799 under financial duress, mostly from pressure of creditors. K.H.E. Richter, who also was in the bookselling business, sold, in the same year, parts of his bookselling business to Hieronymus Wilhelm Christian Seidler (1765‚Äì1811) from Jena. Richter desired to continue as bookseller and did not want to lose his \\"Privilegium Exclusivum\\" (as a royal appointed book seller); but, lost it. K.H.E. Richter contested the loss of his royal appointment. His effort was an impetus for the founding of a publishing house that became Schnuphase'sche Buchhandlung of Altenburg, which was the forerunner to present-day firm, E. Reinhold Verlag (de).  19th century  thumbright210px (1856) Prospectus (1 of 4 pages) forPierer's Universal-Lexikon(4th ed.)Distributed by August Sorge (de) On 1 July 1799, the firm was acquired by Johann Friedrich Pierer (de) (1767‚Äì1832), and became known as Pierer'sche Hofbuchdruckerei. Pierer was a physician and in 1826 became the official physician to the Duke. The book publishing company was owned by the Pierer family until 1871. During this time, the firm achieved international acclaim with published works that included Pierer's Universal-Lexikon (de), an encyclopedia edited by Heinrich August Pierer (1st ed. 1824‚Äì1826). In 1843, Eugen Pierer (de) (1823‚Äì1890), one of H.A. Pierer's sons, joined the business. The Leipzig-Altenburg Railway ‚Äì completed September 19, 1842 ‚Äì greatly enhanced the supply chain from Pierer'sche Hofbuchdruckerei to bookdealers in Leipzig. The business managed to endure in the throes of the 1848 German revolution in Saxony. Upon the death of H.A. Pierer in 1850, Eugen became the sole managing director. In 1859, Eugen's brother, Alfred (1836‚Äì1901), joined the company and Eugen, henceforth, narrowed his responsibility to printing. In 1872, the business was sold to a consortium of Leipzig publishers led by Stephan Geibel (1847‚Äì1903). In addition to Stephan Geibel, the consortium consisted of: * Carl Geibel, Jr. (1842‚Äì1910), brother of Stephan, who with his father, Carl Geibel, Sr., around 1866, acquired the publishing firm of Duncker & Humblot (de) * Richard Reisland (n√© Otto Richard Reisland; 1841‚Äì1915); in 1868, he became sole owner of Fues Verlag in Leipzig, which was founded in 1768 in T√ºbingen as L.W. Fues (Ludwig Friedrich Fues; 1765‚Äì1863); published works of Ferdinand T√∂nnies * Otto Volckmar (n√© Otto Friedrich Friedrich Volckmar; 1835‚Äì1887), son of Friedrich Volckmar (de) (1799‚Äì1876) * Carl V√∂rster (n√© Carl Frederich David V√∂rster; 1826‚Äì1899), son-in-law of Friedrich Volckmar * Carl Geibel, Sr. (de) (1806-1884) In 1874, Stephan Geibel, the youngest son of Carl Geibel, Sr., took over management and the firm became known as Offene Handelsgesellschaft (de) Pierer'sche Hofbuchdruckerei. Stephan Geibel & Co. Stephan was married to Wanda Geibel (n√©e von Rothkirch-Trach), a granddaughter of Heinrich August Pierer.  20th century  In 1919, the firm was reorganized as a Kommanditgesellschaft (limited partnership). By the 1920s, the firm began specializing in scientific publications. By 1925, the managing directors were Hans Stephan Geibel (Stephan Geibel's son) and Paul Hoffmann ‚Äî Hoffman had been Managing Director since the death of Stephen Geibel in 1903. In 1931, Pierersche Hofbuchdruckerei Stefan Geibel & Co. KG was located at 30/31 Hohe Stra√üe. The personnel included Managing Director Hans Stephan Geibel, Director Curt Brandt, and authorized signatories Joachim von Baerensprung, Hanns Bretschneider, August Drescher, Hans Ernst, Heinrich Hansen. The firm had 500 employees. The equipment included 30 setting and casting machines, 45 printing machines, stereotypes, a font foundry, and a large bookbinding facility. = Post World War II = At the end of April 1945, near the end of World War II, the company resumed operations. The U.S. 304th Infantry Regiment was initially stationed at Altenburg, then, in July 1945, Altenburg became part of the Soviet occupation zone. After Germany split (into East and West Germany), the firm, domiciled in East Germany, was forced to provide extensive reparation services to SWA-Verlag in Weimar, publisher for the Soviet Military Administration in Germany, and, to that end, printed more than 28 million books from 1947 to 1949. On the basis of a denunciation, the directors, Hans Stephan Geibel and Max A. Geibel, sons of Stephan Geibel, were arrested in March 1950 and sentenced to prison by the District Court of Gera (de) in October 1950. The firm's assets were confiscated by the state of Thuringia at the turn of 1950-1951, which marked the end of the private enterprise, \\"Pierer'schen Hofbuchdruckerei Stephan Geibel & Co.\\" The company was reconstituted as Betrieb und VEB Druckhaus \\"Maxim Gorki\\" Altenburg, the namesake of a Russian and Soviet writer and five-time nominee for the Nobel Prize in Literature. In 1951, it was merged into Th√ºringer Volksverlag GmbH (de). From 1952 to 1990, the firm specialized in fiction and scientific publications. In 1956, the firm was transferred to the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin, and continued to print mostly scientific journals. = German reunification = On August 15, 1990 ‚Äì after the collapse of the GDR, and the reunification of Germany, the firm ‚Äî under Treuhandanstalt, a government agency established to administer the selling of assets, including entire companies, that had been owned by the DDR ‚Äî registered as Maxim-Gorki- Druck GmbH. Among other things, the firm upgraded from lead typesetting to photographic reproduction and offset printing. Maxim-Gorki-Druck GmbH dissolved on December 17, 1992.  21st century  In 1993, the assets were purchased by Simon Tafertshofer and registered as a private entity in the state of Th√ºringen, registered court of Jena, as Druckerei zu Altenburg GmbH. The firm is currently known as DZA Druckerei zu Altenburg GmbH. Tafertshofer is Managing Director.

They have written a number of anti self-help books on the topics of relationships, sex, and gender, as well as the graphic non-fiction books, Queer: A Graphic History and Gender: A Graphic Guide, and the book The Psychology of Sex. They are the writer of the relationships book and blog Rewriting the Rules, and they have a podcast with sex educator Justin Hancock. Barker is a full-time writer, as well as being a writing mentor, creative consultant, speaker, and independent scholar. Barker holds a PhD in Psychology from the University of Nottingham, and worked for two decades as an academic psychologist at the Open University in the United Kingdom, and as a psychotherapist specialising in sex, gender, and relationships. Barker has written and/or edited some of the first academic collections on open non-monogamy, bisexuality, non-binary gender and BDSM. They were editor of the journal Psychology & Sexuality from 2010 to 2017, and lead author of The Bisexuality Report and the BACP document on Gender, Sexual, and Relationship Diversity. Barker's pronouns are singular they/them. Early life and education Barker was born in Hull, England, on 23 June 1974, grew up in Bradford, and holds a PhD in Psychology from the University of Nottingham. After teaching at a number of higher education institutions Barker settled at the Open University in 2008, having also qualified with an MA in Psychotherapy from the University of Sheffield and trained at the major NHS sexual and relationship clinic at Guy's Hospital for several years. Recent career Barker's main area of expertise is human sexuality, gender and romantic relationships, with a focus on the experiences of people in sexual, gender and relationship communities located outside the mainstream ‚Äì particularly polyamorous, kink, non-binary and bisexual communities. Theoretically their work draws on social constructionism, existentialism and Buddhist philosophy. Barker, with co-author Darren Langdridge, has published two edited collections on sadomasochism and on non-monogamy, and a recent book for mental health professionals (co-authored with Christina Richards). Barker founded the journal of Psychology & Sexuality together with Langdridge in 2010, and they co-edited it until 2017. Barker co-organized the Critical Sexology series from 2006 to 2018, and BiReCon (a biennial research conference which takes place prior to the annual BiCon event). Writing Barker coined the phrase ‚Äòanti self-help‚Äô to describe self-help materials which locate the struggles that people have in their wider societal structures and cultural messages rather than in them as individuals. Barker's anti self-help books aim to help people to navigate their relationship with wider sociocultural understandings, rather than viewing themselves as a problem that needs fixing. They have produced books applying this approach to relationships, sex (with Justin Hancock), and gender (with Alex Iantaffi), as well as producing graphic-novel style non-fiction books and zines on queer, mindfulness and other topics, and a podcast on sex and relationships. Consulting Barker has a background in psychotherapy, and led production on the Open University module Counselling: Exploring Fear and Sadness. They are trained in existential psychotherapy and mindfulness with books on the latter developing the approaches of social mindfulness and mindful sex and relationship therapy (MSRT). Their practice now takes the form of peer-to-peer consulting and mentoring with writers, practitioners, activists, and organizers, with a focus on relationships with self, others, and the wider world. Activism Barker's activism in the area of LGBT&Q; rights has been recognized by placement in the top 40 of The Independent on Sunday newspaper's Pink List, and Rainbow List. Barker was one of the founder members of BiUK, the organization for bisexual research and activism. This group wrote the international guidelines for academics studying bisexuality (published in Journal of Bisexuality) and produced The Bisexuality Report which informs UK policy and practice regarding bisexuality based on the evidence regarding biphobia, bisexual invisibility, and mental health In 2013, Barker took home an Erotic Award in the academic category for the book Rewriting the Rules, as reported in Times Higher Education. Their current activism focuses on trans and non-binary communities. Works Books (as author) * Barker, M. (2003) Introductory Psychology: History, Themes and Perspectives.

It has attractive red and green flowering spikes and soft foliage but has proven to be difficult to grow in gardens. Description Melaleuca calothamnoides is a shrub growing to a height of and about wide with rough bark. The leaves are arranged alternately and long and wide. They are glabrous, fleshy, linear and almost circular in cross section with a blunt, curved tip. The flowers are arranged in cylindrical spikes that are long and wide. The spikes occur on old wood and there are 40 to 60 flowers on each spike. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flowers with 4 to 5 stamens per bundle, and are usually green in the centre grading to red at the tips. Flowering occurs over an extended period from July to October. The fruit are woody capsules in dense spikes along the stem long and each capsule is long and wide.Kalbarri M. calothamnoides (leaves and fruit)M. calothamnoides (bark) Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca calothamnoides was first formally described in 1862 by Ferdinand von Mueller in Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae from a specimen found \\"in limestone hills near the Murchison River by Augustus Oldfield\\". The specific epithet (calothamnoides) refers to the similarity of this species to one in the genus Calothamnus. The ending -oides is a Latin suffix meaning \\"resembling\\" or \\"having the form of\\". Distribution and habitat This melaleuca occurs in the Murchison River area in the Geraldton Sandplains biogeographic region. It has a restricted distribution but is locally common, especially in dry gullies and creek beds. Conservation status Melaleuca calothamnoides is listed as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture The red and green flowering spikes and soft foliage of this shrub are particularly attractive but it is difficult to grow in the garden. It can be propagated easily from seed or cuttings but will only grow in well-drained, acidic soils.

Monero uses an obfuscated public ledger, meaning anybody can broadcast or send transactions, but no outside observer can tell the source, amount or destination. Monero uses a Proof of Work mechanism to issue new coins and incentivize miners to secure the network and validate transactions. The privacy afforded by Monero has attracted use by people interested in evading law enforcement during events such as the WannaCry Ransomware Attack, or on the dark web buying illegal substances. Despite this, Monero is actively encouraged to those seeking financial privacy, since payments and account balances remain entirely hidden, which is not the standard for most cryptocurrencies.  History  In 2014 Bitcointalk forum user known as thankful_for_today forked the codebase of Bytecoin into the name BitMonero, which is a compound of Bit (as in Bitcoin) and Monero (literally meaning \\"coin\\" in Esperanto). The release of BitMonero was very poorly received by the community that initially backed it. Plans to fix and improve Bytecoin with changes to block time, tail emission and block reward had all been ignored, and thankful_for_today simply disappeared from the development scene. A group of users led by Johnny Mnemonic decided that the community should take over the project, and five days later they did while also changing the name to Monero. Due to its privacy features, Monero experienced rapid growth in market capitalization and transaction volume during 2016, faster and bigger than any other cryptocurrency that year. This growth was driven by its uptake in the darknet market, where people used it to buy stolen credit cards, guns, and drugs. Two major darknet markets were shut down in July 2017 by law enforcement. From the beginning, Monero has been used by people holding other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to break the link between transactions, with the other cryptocoins first converted to Monero, then after some delay converted back and sent to an address unrelated to those used before. On January 10, 2017, the privacy of Monero transactions was further strengthened by the adoption of Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell's algorithm Confidential Transactions, hiding the amounts being transacted, in combination with an improved version of Ring Signatures. After many online payment platforms shut down access for white nationalists following the Unite the Right rally in 2017, some of them, including Christopher Cantwell and Andrew Auernheimer (\\"weev\\"), started using and promoting Monero. The operators behind the May 2017 global ransomware incident WannaCry converted their proceeds into Monero. In June, The Shadow Brokers, the group that leaked the code used in WannaCry, started accepting payments in Monero. Malicious hackers have previously embedded Monero mining code into websites and apps seeking profit for themselves. In late 2017 malware and antivirus service providers blocked a JavaScript implementation of Monero miner Coinhive that was embedded in websites and apps, in some cases by hackers. Coinhive generated the script as an alternative to advertisements; a website or app could embed it, and use website visitor's CPU to mine the cryptocurrency while the visitor is consuming the content of the webpage, with the site or app owner getting a percentage of the mined coins. Some websites and apps did this without informing visitors, and some hackers implemented it in way that drained visitors' CPUs. As a result, the script was blocked by companies offering ad blocking subscription lists, antivirus services, and antimalware services. In January 2018, Bloomberg suggested the hackers who stole approximately 500 million NEM tokens ($530 million) from Coincheck would find it challenging to launder the stolen tokens by selling them for Monero since at least one exchange, Shapeshift, had blocked NEM addresses associated with the theft. In the first half of 2018, Monero was used in 44% of cryptocurrency ransomware attacks. In November 2018, Bail Bloc released a mobile app that mines Monero to raise funds for low-income defendants who can't otherwise cover their own cash bail.  Architecture  Monero GUI 0.12.3.0 on Windows 10 Unlike many cryptocurrencies that are derivatives of Bitcoin, Monero is based on the CryptoNight proof-of-work hash algorithm, which comes from the CryptoNote protocol. In particular, the ring signatures used in cryptonote mix the spender's input with a group of others, making it exponentially more difficult to establish a link between each subsequent transaction. Since its original development from the cryptonote protocol, Monero has diverged on a number of features.  Security and privacy features  = Enforced privacy = Monero uses enforced privacy by default for all transactions so that no user can accidentally or deliberately be traceable or insecure. Unlike a public-by-default mechanisms, this ensures users cannot be scrutinised or penalised by outside actors for using private transactions, leading to non-use of privacy features and therefore loss of privacy altogether. = Ring confidential transactions (RingCT) = RingCTs are used to obfuscate the amount sent in a transaction using range proofs and cryptographic commitments. = Bulletproofs = Bulletproofs are used in Monero. They are a type of non-interactive zero-knowledge proof which allow transactions to be verified without knowledge of the sender, receiver or amount without the need for trusted setup. A secure method for verifying transactions is necessary to prevent senders sending currency they do not possess. Bulletproofs replaced the previous method in October 2018, improving on them by requiring much less data for each transaction, particularly for transactions with multiple outputs (receivers). = Stealth (one-time) Addresses = Monero requires senders to cryptographically generate a one- time address using the receiver's public address. Although all transactions to a given public address end up in the same central cryptocurrency wallet, an outside party can never know whether two transactions have been sent to the same public address. = Ring signatures = When sending a Monero transaction, the sender cryptographically \\"signs\\" the transaction with an input they own and 10 other inputs to give a total of 11 inputs that might have been used to generate a given transaction. This gives plausible deniability for senders as an external observer cannot be certain exactly which address sent a given transaction.  Mining  Monero is designed to be resistant to application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) mining, which is commonly used to mine other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. It can be mined somewhat efficiently on consumer grade hardware such as x86, x86-64, ARM and GPUs - and so is a favourite of malware-based miners. Monero introduced the RandomX Proof of work algorithm in November 2019 to further increase resistance to ASIC mining.  Transaction linkability  In April 2017 research highlighted three major threats to Monero users' privacy. The first relies on leveraging the ring signature size of zero, and ability to see the output amounts. The second, described as \\"Leveraging Output Merging\\", involves tracking transactions where two outputs belong to the same user, such as when a user is sending the funds to himself (\\"churning\\"). Finally the third threat, \\"Temporal Analysis\\", shows that predicting the right output in a ring signature could potentially be easier than previously thought. The Monero development team had addressed the first concern in January 2017, prior to the actual release of the research paper, with the introduction of Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT) as well as mandating a minimum size of ring signatures in the March 2016 protocol upgrade. Monero developers also noted that Monero Research Labs, their academic and research arm, already noted and outlined the deficiency in two public research papers in 2014 and 2015.

It was built in 1969, and was a replacement for an earlier shot tower, the very first such tower ever built. It now forms part of an office development called Vertigo, and is located on the north bank of the Floating Harbour upstream of Castle Park. There is no public access to the interior of the tower. History The original tower was built in 1782, in the Bristol suburb of Redcliffe, by William Watts, who is credited with the invention of the tower process for the manufacture of lead shot. It was the progenitor of many similar towers built around the world, and survived various changes of ownership until it was taken over by the Sheldon Bush and Patent Shot Company Limited in 1868. It continued in use under their ownership until 1968, when it was demolished as part of a road widening scheme. The current tower was designed as a replacement by E.N. Underwood and Partners, a firm of structural engineers, for the Sheldon Bush and Patent Shot Company Limited. It was constructed on a site already in use for other purposes by that company, and is some from the site of its predecessor. The structure is of reinforced concrete, with a twelve sided crucible room at the top, giving it an outline reminiscent of a cotton bud. It is the last such tower to be built, one of the few to be built in the 20th century, and one of only three to survive in England. It received the Civic Design Award from the Bristol Civic Society for the year 1969. The tower is tall, giving a drop distance for the lead shot from the crucible room of . The crucible room has a diameter of and originally housed a gas fired cast iron cauldron, for melting the lead ingots. A lift provided access to the crucible room for both personnel and ingots, along with an emergency staircase. The lead shot fell into a tank of cooling water at the foot of the tower, and were transferred by a conveyor belt to hoppers in the roof of the processing building. Use of lead shot subsequently declined due to environmental concerns, and the Bliemeister method of shot production largely replaced the use of shot towers for the remaining production. Use of the current tower for its original purpose ceased in the late 1980s, whilst use of the site for manufacturing ceased in 1994. Demolition of the tower was originally proposed, but in 1995 it was scheduled for preservation by English Heritage, with a grade II listing. Plans were made to incorporate the tower as the centrepiece of a new office development, and this came to fruition in 2005 when the tower was incorporated in the new Vertigo office development. It has been fully refurbished, and the upper level is available to rent as a board room.

The Companies Act is generally reserved for companies which engaged in business physically in Anguilla, and companies formed under it are generally referred to as either \\"CACs\\" (an acronym for Companies Act Companies) or \\"ABCs\\" (an acronym for Anguillan Business Company). The other two statutes relate to the incorporation of non-resident companies as part of the Territory's financial services industry. Companies incorporated under International Business Companies Act are called International Business Companies (or, more usually, \\"IBCs\\"). IBCs represent the largest number of companies in Anguilla. Companies incorporated under Limited Liability Companies Act are called Limited Liability Companies, and are also commonly referred to by their three-letter acronym, \\"LLCs\\". Registering a company In practice, all companies formed in Anguilla are ordinarily incorporated by a trust company. Because all companies are required to have a licensed registered agent, and only trust companies are so licensed, in practice they control the incorporation procedure. Technically any person may incorporate an IBC or a CAC by subscribing and filing the Articles of Incorporation,, section 2(1); , section 5(1). but as all IBCs and CACs are required by law to maintain a registered agent at all times,, section 37(1); , section 150(1). in practice the registered agent will invariable deal with the incorporation procedure.Because only registered agents have access to the Anguilla Companies Registry's electronic ACORN system, in practice it would be very difficult for anyone else to incorporate an IBC. Similarly any person may form an LLC by subscribing the Articles of Formation,, section 11(1) but because all LLCs are required at all times to have a registered agent,, section 6(1). this process is usually undertaken by that agent. All IBCs must be incorporated as companies limited by shares. A CAC may be incorporated as either (1) a company limited by shares, (2) a company limited by guarantee, or (3) a company limited by shares and by guarantee., section 6. Corporate personality In Anguilla a company has separate legal personality from its members (unlike, for example, a partnership registered under the Limited Partnership Act (Cap L.70) or otherwise regulated by the Partnership Act (Cap P.05)). The members of a company is not liable for the debts or obligations of the company., section 4; , section 57; , section 23. Similarly, directors or officers of a company are not normally liable for the company's debts except insofar as they may otherwise be liable for their own conduct or actions. The primary circumstances where liability may be imposed upon directors in relation to their acts as directors are (1) where the director is guilty of fraudulent trading or misfeasance, or (2) where the director undertakes personal responsibility or liability for certain actions., section 4; , section 23. There is no express statutory provision in relation to the director of a CAC, but see also Williams v Natural Life Health Foods Ltd [1998] UKHL 17. Conversely, the assets of a company are regarded as belonging solely to the company and not the company's members. In exception circumstances the courts are prepared to \\"pierce the corporate veil\\" and treat the assets of the company as belonging to the members (or, conversely, treat the company's obligations as the obligations of the members), but the circumstances in which this will be done are rare and exceptional.Prest v Petrodel Resources Ltd [2013] UKSC 34. Corporate constitution The corporate constitution of an Anguillan company depends upon which statute it is incorporated under. * For an International Business Company they are the Articles of Incorporation and the by-laws. The Articles of Incorporation are publicly filed upon incorporation, but they are a relatively perfunctory document containing very little information beyond the name of the company, the registered office and registered agent, and particulars of the authorised share capital. The regulation of the company's affairs is primarily delegated to the by-laws which are a private document not accessible by the public which are maintained at the company's registered office., sections 7 and 11. * For a private company registered under the Companies Act they also consist of the Articles of Incorporation and by-laws., section 7(1). * For a limited liability company they are the Articles of Formation and the LLC agreement. Similar to IBCs, the Articles of Formation are publicly filed upon registration, but they are a relatively perfunctory document containing very little information beyond the name of the company, the registered office and registered agent. The principal regulation of the company's affairs is primarily delegated to the LLC agreement which is a private document not accessible by the public which are maintained at the company's registered office., sections 11 and 12. The Articles of Incorporation (or Formation) of a company are filed with the Companies Registry but are not available for public inspection. However, the by-laws or LLC agreement are private, and not available to the public. In each case the constitutional documents may be amended without a court application, but where the document is publicly filed, the amendment will normally need to also be publicly filed before it becomes effective. For IBCs and CACs the Articles of incorporation and by-laws will bind the company and each member of the company as if they had been executed by them personally., section 13; , section 22. There is no equivalent provision for LLCs. Corporate governance The business and affairs of an Anguillan company are usually managed by its board of directors., section 39. The board must consist of one or more persons, and these may be individuals or companies. Directors owe strict duties of good faith to exercise their powers for a proper purpose and in the best interests of the company.Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Petroleum Ltd [1974] AC 821 The Companies Law is almost entirely silent in relation to the position of the directors, and the relevant legal principles are all derived from the common law. The members of the company are legally the owners of the company. Although they do not have the power to dictate to the directors how the company should be managed,Automatic Self-Cleansing Filter Syndicate Co Ltd v Cuninghame [1906] 2 Ch 34 they have the power to appoint and remove the board, the through this power they exercise indirect control. Resolutions may be passed by the members formally or informally pursuant to the Duomatic principle. There are no special statutory provisions to protect minority shareholders against \\"unfair prejudice\\" on the part of majority shareholders. Accordingly, minority shareholders who are prejudiced in this have to rely upon the common law exceptions to the rule set in Foss v Harbottle,(1843) 67 ER 189 or seek a winding-up of the company on just and equitable grounds. The directors owe their duties to the company itself, and not to the individual members.Foss v Harbottle (1843) 67 ER 189 Accordingly, where a director acts in breach of their duty, then the proper claimant in any action is the company itself. If the company is unable to take any action (because it is controlled by the wrongdoer) the court may authorise a member to bring proceedings in the name of the company by way of derivative action. However the measure of damages will be the loss to the company, and only the loss to the company. A shareholder cannot sue a person for a wrong committed against the company for the \\"reflective loss\\" to the value of their shareholding, as this would result in the wrongdoer paying double compensation for the same wrong (once to the company and once to the shareholders).Johnson v Gore Wood & Co [2002] 2 AC 1 The emphasis of Cayman Islands company law is to protect the rights of creditors and members (i.e. the sources of capital) as the key stakeholders in the company. The rights of other stakeholders, such as employees, customers and wider society are given comparatively little protection. This reflects the offshore nature of most Cayman Islands companies, and the different social and economic environments in which they operate. Shares, equity interests and members IBCs can only be formed as share issuing companies. Although CACs can be formed as guarantee companies, in practice almost all companies are registered as share issuing companies. LLCs do not have shareholders or issue shares, but they have members who make contributions in return for their interest as members. Legally membership interests in an LLC are a form of hybrid between traditional share capital and partnership interests in the capital of a partnership.For example, section 47(2) of the (dealing with the rights of a mortgagee of a membership interest) are copied directly from equivalent provisions in the Partnership Act in relation to partners charging their interest in the partnership. Shareholders in an Anguillan company do not enjoy statutory pre-emption rights or rights of first refusal in relation to new issuances or sales of shares. Companies may provide for bespoke provisions relating to such rights in their constitutional documents, and this will sometimes occur in joint ventures or where preferred shareholders invest in the company. Shareholder voting in Anguillan companies is predicated by the normal basis of majority-control. Shares in an International Business Company may only be issued as fully paid., section 14(1). The International Business Companies Act is unclear as to what the effect of a purported share issue is where the share is not fully paid, but it seems probable that the result is it would be void.However, there may be a valid underlying subscription contract which subsists, giving rise to an obligation to issue the issues upon payment of the full consideration. Shares in an International Business Company are person property, and the situs of the shares is in Anguilla,, sections 15(1) and 129. and shares may be mortgaged or charged by the shareholder., section 35. Dividends on shares may only be paid out of surplus, which for the purposes of Anguillan law is defined as the excess, if any, of the total assets of the company over the sum of its total liabilities as shown in the books of account, plus its capital., section 1(1) and 32(2). International Business Companies may acquire and hold their own shares as treasury shares, but whilst they hold them the shares are disabled in terms of voting powers and rights to receive dividends., sections 29 and 30. International Business Companies may issue bearer shares, but they may only be held by a licensed custodian, who must maintain records of the beneficial owner of the share., section 27. There are no equivalent restrictions on the power of companies to issue bearer debt securities or bearer share warrants. Debt finance In addition to raising capital from their members by way of equity, Anguillan companies may raise capital by way of debt, either in the form of loans or by issuing debt securities. Companies are not required to file financing statements in Anguilla when borrowing money. Where a creditor takes security from an IBC for the indebtedness of the company, the company may elect to opt into the public security registration regime., section 77. In practice, a secured creditor will often insist that it does so, and loan documents often contain a covenant to this effect. Once the IBC has elected to become a security registering company, then either the company or any secured creditor may register any security interest created by the company in the register of registered charges., section 78(1). Order of entry of security interests in the public register determine priority as between competing security interests,, section 81(1). but there is no general right of public inspection of the register or registered charges. Registration of a security interest either requires an original document or a \\"wet-ink\\" certified true copy. In addition, each IBC must keep a private register of charges, but this is a matter of internal record keeping and does not affect the priority of security interests or third party creditors' rights generally., section 76(1). There is no public registration system for security in relation to a CAC. All CACs are required to enter particulars of mortgages and charges in a private register of charges, but this is not a document which the public have access to, and registration (or failure to register) does not affect third party rights., section 172. There are no equivalent security registration provisions at all for LLCs. There are no restrictions prohibiting Anguillan companies of any type from giving financial assistance for the acquisition of their own shares or membership interests, and no requirement to go through a \\"whitewash\\" procedure. Reorganisation and restructuring There are a number of statutory provisions whereby companies registered in Anguilla may reorganise themselves, either pursuant to a general group reorganisation, or as part of a debt restructuring, or in order to complete an M&A; transaction. * Mergers and consolidation. Two or more IBCs or LLCs may either merge or consolidate by statute into a single successor company,, section 85; , section 19. and the successor company will succeed to the assets of all of the constituent companies and be subject to all of the liabilities and obligations of the constituent companies. In a merger, the successor company is one of the original companies which merged. In a consolidation all of the constituent companies are merged into one new company which did not exist prior to the consolidation. After the merger or consolidation is completed the non- surviving companies are struck-off and cease to exist. There is no equivalent for a CAC. * Continuation. Although not so much a reorganisational process in its own right, IBCs and LLCs registered in Anguilla are able to redomicile to (or, in the words of the statute, \\"continue their existence under the laws of\\") any other jurisdiction which permits companies to change their jurisdiction of registration., section 97; , section 69. Similarly, companies are entitled to migrate to the Cayman Islands from other jurisdictions where those other jurisdictions permit this., section 93;, section 61. There is no equivalent for a CAC, but a CAC may \\"continue\\" its existence as an IBC, and thereafter continue to another jurisdiction. * Arrangements. IBCs may enter into a scheme of arrangement whereby the court sanctions a compromise or arrangement which is entered into by the members or creditors of a company., section 91(1). The scheme must be approved by a majority in number and 75% in value., section 91(2). Where the scheme members or scheme creditors have different interests, the court may be order that they be divided into two or more classes for the purposes of voting on the scheme. Although similar statutory provisions are normally referred to as schemes of arrangement in other jurisdictions, in the provisions in the Anguillan legislation they are referred to as an \\"arrangement\\". There is no equivalent for a CAC or LLC. By contrast, there are no real statutory reorganisational processes at present which apply to CACs. Insolvency Anguillan corporate insolvency law is presently highly fragmented, with various different parts of appearing in either the Bankruptcy Act (Cap B.15) or the Companies Act (Cap C.65). However, the matrix of laws is nonetheless fragmentary and incomplete. At present there are no provisions under Anguillan law in relation to corporate insolvency which address insolvency set-off, or the avoidance of dispositions after the commencement of winding-up. There are also no powers conferred upon the liquidator specifically relating to challenging transactions entered into the \\"twilight\\" period which prejudice the general body of creditors, but there is limited scope to seek redress for such transactions outside of the insolvency regime under the Fraudulent Dispositions Act (Cap F.60). However, the legislature is currently considering a comprehensive new Insolvency Act which will both close all of the relevant gaps in the law, and consolidate all related laws relating to both corporate insolvency and personal bankruptcy into a single statute. Where a liquidator over a company is appointed (either voluntarily or by the court), the liquidator's primary duty is to collect in all of the company's assets and then distribute them pari passu to the company's creditors. The law confers wide powers upon the liquidator to enable him to do so. Once a liquidator is appointed, unsecured creditors cannot commence legal proceedings against the insolvent company without the leave of the court, and any rights of action against the company are converted into claims in the liquidation process. Any disposition of property by the company after the commencement of winding-up is void unless the court otherwise orders. Secured creditors generally do not participate in the liquidation process, and may continue to proceed with any enforcement action directly against their collateral pursuant to a valid security interest. Anguillan law provides for statutory netting relating to financial contracts under the Netting Act (Cap N.03), and this will prevail over any other off provisions arising by law.Netting Act, section 2. Financial services regulation Financial services are regulated in the Cayman Islands by the Anguilla Financial Services Commission (or FSC), an independent regulator. The FSC‚Äôs ambit extends to companies (and any other entities) which are engaged in regulated business. The principal types of business which are regulated are: #Investment funds #Insurance #Banking #Trust companies Most regulated business in Anguilla is regulated if it is conducted \\"in or from within\\" the jurisdiction. Accordingly, if an Anguillan company is incorporated to provide investment advice in Switzerland, it would still be regulated in Anguilla because it is providing regulated services \\"from within\\" the jurisdiction.

Popstar was co-produced by Warner Bros. and debuted in theaters on December 15, 2000. The feature was watched by approximately 2,394,326 viewers.  Plot  After a brilliant career abroad, an international top model named Nick (Xuxa Meneghel) returns to Brazil to find her Prince Charming, whom she met through an internet chat. In the country, she becomes a successful businesswoman of fashion, but her competitor does everything to disrupt the girl.

In Xuxa Kid, the blonde would become a 10-year-old girl, something like what would come years later in the long Xuxa em Sonho de Menina (2007). In the story, the young version of the presenter would have the duo Sandy and Junior as their friends. The recordings were planned for September and would be released in December. However, Globo Filmes decided to veto the participation of the pair because there are already plans to launch a film with the brothers as protagonists, a fact that only came to fruition in 2003. Because of this decision, the story of the film had to be completely changed and the launch of a new film was delayed until March 2001. After the project was canceled, Xuxa was persuaded by her team to make a new film, with a new script, that would rekindle her teen audience, as well as the previous one, and that the idea for a movie for the children's audience would be for next year. His manager then had the idea of making a film that could put musical attractions, just like in the previous one, to attract the adolescent public, that accompanied Xuxa in its TV series Planeta Xuxa. \\"In some cases it was possible to sew the musical appearance in the plot, but many entries were due to the invitation made by Marlene in the middle of filming,\\" says screenwriter Vivian Perl. Diler Andrade defines the insertions of musical numbers (in a non-musical film) as a \\"strategic marriage\\" between the cinematographic and phonographic industry. \\"We need to repeat the feat of the music industry, which holds 80% of the market, against 20% of foreign artists. Vivian Perl says that Xuxa manager Marlene Mattos put the musical number on the film after conducting research on the most popular groups. The recordings began in September 2000. According to the presenter, the film recounts a little of the story she lived when she spent three months in the United States early in her modeling career. \\"It is very difficult to face the lack of your country. We miss everything and have an hour that feels like coming back,\\" he said. But it was not only this aspect that Xuxa wanted to show with the film. According to her the intention was to show the glamor that exists in the profession, but at the same time, get very close to reality by showing the difficulties of the career. \\"I wanted to gather some of the glamorous life that everyone wants with the difficulties that exist to achieve that dream,\\" he said. According to the presenter, being a model, actress and soccer player is the dream of most children. The deduction came from a research in which the production took as a base to realize the film. Xuxa said that the film is not necessarily for the children's audience, but for the family, The team's great pride, according to Xuxa, was to make a film \\"that brings an important message to children\\". \\"We did a research and found that boys want to be football players and girls, models, models and singers. I think it's important that they know that it takes a lot of head not to fall on the bad side of the profession, that has drugs, prostitution.\\" The film does not escape the standard of the cinematographic productions of Xuxa, There are no missing musical numbers - which, many times, arise without connection with the plot - and very, merchandising. the groups Harmonia do Samba, As Meninas, Os Travessos, KLB, SNZ and √â o Tchan: and the singers Deborah Blando and Mauricio Manieri participated in the film. With little script and excesses, the film has excessive merchandising of brands of companies, or recording artists. In the interview, Xuxa, moved, thanks the artists who participated in the movie \\"without charging money\\", just for the good will to be in the film. The film also has unusual appearances by presenter Ot√°vio Mesquita, singer Leonardo and model Gianne Albertoni. Also present are S√≠lvia Pfeifer, Claudia Rodrigues and veteran Claudio Corr√™a e Castro. According to Vivian Perl, who wrote the story in partnership with Elizeu Ewald, the musical number serves to \\"illustrate a moment of introspection\\" of the protagonist. The actors Thiago Lacerda, Marcello Antony and Reynaldo Gianecchini were invited to interpret Ricardo the romantic pair of Xuxa in the film, but neither one of them could accept, and the pepel ended up being interpreted by Luigi Baricelli. The scene of the kiss between Nick and Ray of Light was repeated dozens of times. The interpretation was so intense that at that time some tabloids even published that there was no technical kiss and that Xuxa and Luigi Baricelli would have a love relationship. The two even denied the relationship, but the Xuxa confirmed that the kiss was not technical. Music Unlike the film previous, Popstar did not have its soundtrack released on CD or any other format. However, a promotional album was released by Abril Music with 3 songs that were present in the movie: O Rodo (Harmonia do Samba), Seamisai (Deborah Blando) and the theme song Popstar (Maur√≠cio Manieri). *Popstar - Maur√≠cio Manieri *N√£o Olhe Assim - Leonardo *Shake, Shake - Xuxa *Bate Tchan - √â o Tchan! *O Rodo - Harmonia do Samba *T√¥ Te Filmando - Os Travessos *Um Dia Pra N√≥s - Os Travessos *Ela N√£o Est√° Aqui - KLB *Tapa Aqui, Descobre Ali - As Meninas *Seamisai - Deborah Blando *Venha Dan√ßar - SNZ *Mais e Mais - Marcos Chadler Release Xuxa promoted a press conference in S√£o Paulo to publicize the film in which he stated that he hoped so as \\"Requebra was a box office record. I'm sure the same will happen with Popstar.\\" The film premiered on December 15, 2000, TV Globo reserved four rooms of a movie complex in Rio for the exhibition, on January 6, 2001, of \\"Popstar\\". Officials of the station will be invited to occupy the audience in exchange for food that has been ceded to NGOs. Critical reception Xuxa Popstar received generally negative from critics. Marcelo Forlani wrote in his website Omelette critique: \\"In the summer of 1999/2000, Xuxa Requebra obtained the highest grossing of national productions, betting on the same formulation that the Children's Queen decided to put a new product in theaters, yes, because this feature does not have a screenplay and only serves as a huge shelf where the new goods of the brand Xuxa are exposed ... An abuse to the spectator's intelligence and to the good taste, so much the face of stick like everything is shown, always in the foreground, leaving the characters themselves in secondary positions ... From the \\"drafting of the script\\" to its completion, it was only a few weeks ago, but there are no excuses for the lack of creativity presented. The critic Celso Sabadin wrote that \\"Pop Star can not be considered a bad movie. Even because it's not a movie. It's just a bunch of music video made for popular groups. Between one video and another, one tries to tell a story. Just try. You never can. The basic proposal is clear: make money. Nothing else. Box office Xuxa popstar in less than a month had already been seen by more than 1 million people. The film led the ranking of audiences in Brazilian cinemas in 2001, after 40 weeks of the debut of \\"Popstar\\". Despite not leading the top-grossing list of the year, the children's queen continued in front of all of the super-productions of the summer with several viewers. Xuxa Popstar was assisted by more than 2.38 million people. The national film was the great Brazilian box-office champion in 2001. Xuxa Popstar took 2.3 million viewers to cinemas, surpassing the previous year's mark of the children's queen, when Xuxa Requebra (1999) was seen by about 2 million people. The closest competitor to \\"Popstar\\" is The Mummy Returns, which was watched by 2.26 million Brazilians. The film became the Brazilian record-breaking movie, for the first time in more than a decade, a Brazilian film ended the year as the box office champion in the country's cinemas. Xuxa popstar had a budget of 2.8 million Brazilian reais, the largest for a Xuxa film, until the launch of Xuxa e os Duendes, which got 3.8 million reais in budget. The film grossed over 9 million Brazilian reais.

Anguillan bankruptcy law regulates the position of individuals and companies who are unable to meet their financial obligations. Bankruptcy of individuals is usually referred to as \\"personal bankruptcy\\" in Anguilla, whereas the bankruptcy of corporations is referred to as \\"corporate insolvency\\". The legislation largely deals with both separately, although there are some common provisions. Personal bankruptcy Personal bankruptcy is regulated under the Bankruptcy Act (Cap B.15). Under that statute, a person commits an act of bankruptcy if he or she:Bankruptcy Act, section 4. # makes a conveyance or assignment of his property to a trustee or trustees for the benefit of his creditors generally; # makes a fraudulent conveyance, gift, delivery, or transfer of his property, or any part thereof; # makes any conveyance or transfer of his property, or any part thereof, or creates any charge thereon, which would under this or any other Act be void as a fraudulent preference if he were adjudged bankrupt; # with intent to defeat or delay his creditors he departs out of Anguilla, or being out of Anguilla remains out of Anguilla, or departs from his dwelling house, or otherwise absents himself, or begins to keep house; # execution having issued against him, has been levied by seizure and sale of his goods under process in an action in any court, or in any civil proceeding; # if any judgment debt has been ordered by the Court to be levied upon any landsOther than a plantation in which there are 40 acres under cultivation or any mortgage, encumbrance or interest in or upon such land; # files in the Court a declaration of his inability to pay his debts, or presents a bankruptcy petition against himself or herself; # if a creditor has obtained a final judgment against him for any amount, and execution thereon not having been stayed, and he does not, within the time provided, either comply with the requirements of the notice, or satisfy the Court that he has a counterclaim, set off or cross demand which equals or exceeds the amount of the judgment debt; # if the debtor gives notice to any of his creditors that he has suspended, or that he is about to suspend, payment of his debts; or # if the debtor has in fact suspended payment of his debts and given notice to any of his creditors that he is insolvent. If any of those conditions are made out, then the court may make a \\"receiving order\\" (which is the name for what is ordinarily called a bankruptcy order in Anguilla).Bankruptcy Act, section 5. On the making of a receiving order a receiver is constituted \\"receiver\\" of the property of the debtor, and thereafter no creditor to whom the debtor is indebted in respect of any debt provable in bankruptcy shall have any remedy against the debtor in respect of the debt or shall commence any action or other legal proceedings unless with the leave of the Court, and on such terms as the Court may impose.Bankruptcy Act, section 9(1). Thereafter a meeting of creditors is convened,Bankruptcy Act, section 14. and they may by resolution of 75% of creditors in value seek to implement an arrangement or compromise in relation to the debts of the bankrupt.Bankruptcy Act, section 17. If the meeting is not successful in implementing a scheme, then the court will appoint a trustee in bankruptcy who will divide the property of the bankrupt between his creditors in the discharge of their claims.Bankruptcy Act, sections 19 and 20.

The Hg0-containing gold NPs were collected using reduced graphite oxide‚àíFe3O4 NPs composites. Mercury is considered to be one of the most notorious metal pollutants present in food, water, air and soil, but the process of eliminating it is limited.Li B, Zhang Y, Ma D, Shi Z, Ma S.

However, these methods are expensive, time consuming, and inefficient, hence the need for a nanofiltration technology that overcomes all of these issues. Nanofiltration technology is very efficient in removal of mercury species due to its characteristics of having high surface area-to-volume and the fact that it's easily chemically functionalized. Additionally, Brownian motion of nanomaterials allows them to scan large volume of solvent in short times. There are many copolymer nanoparticles (NPs) that can be used as scavengers to eliminate mercury species via redox reactions such as selenium NPs, manganese dioxide nanowhiskers, carbon nanotube‚àísilverNP composites, silver NPs, silver NP-decorated silicaspheres, gold NP-based materials. Among these adsorbents, citrate-capped gold NP-based materials have been used intensively to capture mercury species from nature water. Instrumentation High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) is used to obtain the HRTEM images (FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin working at 200 kV) and double beam UV- visible spectrophotometer is used for the extinction, or removal, of the NPs gold spectra.Shih YC, Ke CY, Yu CJ, Lu CY, Tseng WL.

A superconducting quantum interference device measures the magnetometry while the Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy spectrum is measured by a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer. Removal of mercury species Figure 2: Procedure associated with the removal of Hg2+ by the combination of Tween 20-Au NPs and reduced graphite-Fe3O4 NP composites The application of an external magnetic field helps reduce the Fe3O4 NP compositions and can be used to remove the citrate capped gold NPs or Tween 20- Au NPs. The quantity of the Hg2+ is determined by ICP-MS. Elimination efficiency is calculated as: Elimination Efficiency (%) = [(Co ‚Äì C)/ Co] x 100 The equilibrium absorption capacity was determined by: qe = (Co ‚Äì Ce) x (V/W) where qe is the equilibrium absorption capacity, Ce is the concentration of Hg2+, V is the volume of the solution and W is the weight of Tween 20-Au NPs. Other metals in place of mercury can be used to determine the reusability of the nanofiltration method. A simple nanofiltration process is illustrated in Figure 2. Figure 3:A highly porous framework such as water is treated with mercury chelating groups, which serve as the \\"mercury nano trap\\". These chelating groups hold tightly onto Hg (II) ions, removing it from the water.When purifying mercury from sea water, a decrease in the volume to surface area ratio leads to a decline in the efficiency of the elimination.7 Cost efficiency of the nanotrap process is indicated in the fact that the materials can be reused to recycle more water. Tween 20-Au NPs are rapid, efficient and selective in capturing Hg2+ in high salt water concentration when the gold NPs catalyze the citrate ion induced reduction of Hg2+ to Hg0.F. S. Zhang, J. O. Nriagu, and H. Itoh, \\"Mercury removal from water using activated carbons derived from organic sewage sludge,\\" Water Research, vol. 39, no. 2‚Äì3, pp. 389‚Äì395, 2005. ICP-MS is used to quantify the Hg2+ concentration to determine the level of elimination efficiency. Figure 3 shows an illustration process of the nano trap filtration process. The use of nanomaterials in removing the mercury from water is advantageous because of the high surface area to volume ratio and the fact that they are easily chemically functionalized. Nanomaterials capture five times more mercury than the maximum mercury captured predicted through the use of previous mercury filtration systems.Kuriyama M, Haruta K, Dairaku T, Kawamura T, Kikkawa S, Inamoto K, Tsukamoto H, Kondo Y, Torigoe H, Okamoto I, Ono A, Morita EH, Tanaka Y: Hg2+-trapping beads: Hg2+-specific recognition through thymine- Hg(II)-thymine base pairing.

Early life Cl√§re Otto enjoyed a middle-class upbringing. Her father was a feed merchant. After finishing at her single-sex secondary school she came into contact with the circle of Berlin-based expressionist poets around Georg Heym, Else Lasker-Sch√ºler and, most notably, Franz Pfemfert. Fritz Mierau would later describe her as \\"the soul and muse of the little circle\\".\\"...die Seele und die Muse des kleinen Kreises.\\" Pfemert edited a left-wing political and literary magazine called Die Aktion: Cl√§re Otto got to know his fellow contributors to Die Aktion, among them the restless anarchist poet Franz Jung whom she would later marry and under whose shadow, according to some evaluations, she would spend much of her life. However, her first marriage was to another Die Aktion contributor, the writer and political activist Richard Oehring: the two of them were divorced after two years, in 1917. By September 1918 she was living with Franz Jung, although it would be another ten years before the two of them got married. Political activism during the German Revolution During the war she worked as a medical assistant at the Moabit Hospital in Berlin between 1915 and 1916. In 1916 she obtained a position as press agency secretary, work with which she continued till 1921. During the revolutionary period that followed the war she was contributing to the journal Russische Korrespondenz, and she was also working as a secretary for the Communist Workers' Party, a breakaway grouping founded in April 1920 by Franz Jung (together with Alexander Schr√∂der, Alexander Schwab and Bernhard Reichenbach) as part of the bewildering political splintering that was a feature of left-wing politics in Germany at the time. In August 1921 she traveled to Moscow with Franz Jung. The previous year he had visited Lenin, arriving in May 1920 with party comrade Jan Appel. Travel between two states in revolutionary turmoil was not without its challenges. In the absence of regular rail links, a Hamburg-based Communist called Hermann Kn√ºfken was able to smuggle the men onto a steam boat called Senator Schr√∂der: once on board they persuaded the captain to alter course, and were thereby delivered to Murmansk. His journey being illegal, in order to return home he traveled under a false name. Back in Germany, Jung's political activity earned him several months in prison during the early part of 1921. He had already received Soviet citizenship in June 1920 during his visit at that time, and Franz Jung would never lose his compelling enthusiasm for Soviet Russia. Jung was banned from overseas travel, but nevertheless Franz and Cl√§re managed to cross into Denmark at the end of August 1921, and then obtained a passage to the Soviet Union on a freight steamer called \\"Flora\\": the two of them now settled in Moscow. Cl√§re obtained work as a secretary in the Moscow office of the Comintern Central Committee. After this she helped with reconstruction within the framework of Workers International Relief, and was involved in setting up orphanages in Perm and Jekaterinburg. She later worked, along with Franz Jung, on the rebuilding of the \\"Ressora\\" metalwork plant in Petrograd which, by the time circumstances had persuaded them to leave the country in November 1923, was back to producing steel oil barrels and ship building components. Living under Nazism She returned to Germany at the end of 1923 with Franz Jung and in 1924 (or 1928) they were married. Jung lowered his political profile and both of them found work in press agency and publishing work. Between 1924 and 1927 she was working for a literary and political publisher in Berlin. In 1927, together with Franz, Cl√§re took a position with Deutscher Feuilleton Dienst, for which she would still be working, despite the intervening personal and political turmoil, till 1944. During this time, in January 1933, the NSDAP (Nazi Party) took power, which was followed by a rapid retreat from democracy in favour of one- party government. From 1933 Cl√§re Jung was combining her publishing work with (now illegal) anti-Nazi activism, working with Harro Schulze-Boysen and others to help Jewish and political victims of government oppression, and producing press releases on behalf of non-Nazi, and therefore illegal, news services (so called \\"Green reports\\" / \\"Gr√ºne Berichte\\"). During this period, in 1937, Franz and Cl√§re Jung were divorced when Franz, identified as an unquiet government opponent, was obliged to escape to Switzerland (and forced to move on to Hungary two years later). It is clear from subsequent correspondence after 1944 when Franz's daughter (by an earlier marriage) died, that the two did not entirely lose contact following the divorce however. Life in East Germany The end of the war in May 1945 put an end to the Nazi regime and, some thought, to single party dictatorship in Germany. Cl√§re Jung lost no time in joining the Communist Party. In April 1946 a contentious merger between the old Communist Party and the Moderate-left SPD created the basis for a return to one- party rule in this portion of Germany. Jung was one of thousands of Communists who now lost little time in signing their party membership across to the new Socialist Unity Party (Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands, SED), which had resulted from the merger. 1946 also saw the first appearance of her book Aus der Tiefe rufe ich, described as a novel but in many respects undisguisedly driven by her own experiences, and a work that has received greater attention, more than two decades following the author's death, since the appearance in 2004 of a new edition edited by Monika Melchert. The book deals with the lives of Jewish people in Berlin between 1938 and 1943, swinging between resignation and hope along the route to annihilation. In the post-war years Jung obtained a job as a literary, cultural and popular education editor with Berliner Rundfunk, a radio station established in 1946 and, during its early years, controlled by the Soviet administrators who had taken control of the entire central portion of Germany at the end of the war. By 1952 the Soviet occupation zone had been replaced by the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic, established formally in October 1949. In 1952, by now aged 60, Jung took a job as Party Secretary and teacher at the National Ballet Academy in Berlin. She left the ballet school position in 1955, now working as a freelance writer, making contributions to East German newspapers and magazines. She served as a member of the Berlin region of the Cultural Association of the GDR, and later became a member of the \\"Seniors' Commission\\" of the national Union of Journalists. Death and a literary afterlife Cl√§re Jung died in 1981. Her memoir, titled \\"Paradiesv√∂gel\\" (birds of paradise), appeared posthumously in 1987.

It was translated into English in 1858 by Catherine Winkworth.  History  Weisse based \\"Christus ist erstanden\\" upon an earlier hymn of the same name which was studied by Martin Luther. The hymn was based on a Latin sequence from 1100 called \\"Victimae paschali laudes\\" and was initially a Bohemian language hymn of the Church of Bohemia. The hymn was first published in print in 1531 by Weisse in his German language Ein Neuges√§ngbuchlein hymnal in the Kingdom of Bohemia after translating it from Bohemian. In 1858, Winkworth translated \\"Christus ist erstanden\\" into English, initially giving it the English title of \\"Song of Triumph\\". She first published \\"Christ the Lord Is Risen Again\\" into her Lyra Germanica, attributing the hymn to the \\"Bohemian Brethren\\". Winkworth's approach in translating the hymn was to try and recreate the verses rather than making a direct translation of them due to German fusional language meaning that some words in the original had to be removed in translation as they did not fit into the English translation. The hymn is often used as a hymn for Easter Sunday which commemorates the Resurrection of Jesus. Music The hymn was initially performed to the melody of the original Latin \\"Victimae pashali laudes\\". However, since then, the hymn has been performed in other musical compositions including \\"Llanfair\\" and \\"Wirtemburg\\".

Two unidentified gunmen entered a pub in Gothenburg, Sweden and began firing indiscriminately at people inside the restaurant. The pub, V√•r Krog & Bar, is located in the Biskopsg√•rden neighbourhood of Gothenburg on Hisingen, an area that has witnessed gang violence. The shootings are one of the rare times in which an innocent bystander has been killed in criminal rival gang violence in Sweden. The shooters were part of a gang from North Biskopsg√•rden out for revenge. A year after the event, the G√∂teborgs-Posten newspaper described the shootings as \\"one of the most unprecedented crimes of 2015.\\" Other newspapers characterized it as part of \\"a wave of high-profile attacks in Sweden in 2015\\", and part of \\"a surge in violent conflict between rival criminal gangs.\\" In 2010, Biskopsg√•rden was the Gothenburg district which had the highest rate of gang violence. In 2012, a territorial crime gang in the area split into two factions. The bar shooting was meant to destroy one of the rival factions. Shooting The attack began when four suspects parked a car outside a pub in Gothenburg. Two of the masked suspects entered the pub with fully loaded AKM assault rifles. One shooter was wearing a police vest. The pub was full of people watching a football match in the bar. The gunmen walked quickly around the rooms, spraying ammunition at anyone in their way, but focusing on one man who was their suspected main target. The gunmen shot random people sitting at tables and at the bar, indiscriminately, and shot the suspected target in the face with .30-caliber bullets, killing him instantly. According to police reports the victim \\"didn't have a face left\\". On their way out they shot at more survivors and once the gunmen exited the bar, they shot and instantly killed an innocent young adult bystander, then fleeing the scene in the nearby car driven by the other suspects. The street of the pub was already under surveillance by police because of suspected drug dealing going on nearby, this made it possible for police to call for back-up and arrive very early on the chaotic scene and begin first aid. It is speculated by some that had police not arrived so quickly, many more would have died from gunshot wounds and loss of blood.https://www.gp.se/det-gjorde-de- misst%C3%A4nkta-f%C3%B6re-morden-1.974915 A witness who spoke to journalists for Aftonbladet, said that he saw two people enter the restaurant in Biskopsg√•rden carrying guns that looked like AK-47s, and start shooting. Sky News described the gunman as having \\"sprayed the pub with bullets\\". Some early news reports described the shooting as terrorism related, which turned out to be false, it was later discovered that the suspects were targeting a rival gang member, thus making it a gang shooting. The responding police units and ambulances described a bloodbath inside the pub and a surreal scene with the girlfriend of one victim sitting next to the body \\"which had no face left\\" and one customer so shocked he was still sitting in the bar casually drinking a beer. The reports mention a thick stench of iron and gunpowder from the blood and gunshots making it hard for the police to breathe. One policeman said he repeatedly thought he dropped his keys when searching the pub, because he heard a metallic noise, and realizing that it was the floor covered with bullet cases which was impossible to not step on that made the noise every time he moved. Another police on the scene mentioned how almost no details, mirrors or furniture had been damaged, as the shooters had systematically targeted the people inside.SR,P3 dokument√§r Investigation and trials The gunmen were believed to have fled the scene after the shooting. Following the shooting police sealed off the area and launched a murder investigation. Initially, four people were arrested in connection with the shooting. Five men were eventually charged with murder. On 8 August 2016, following a two-month trial at the Gothenburg District Court, two of the men were sentenced to life imprisonment; the other three, who were under the age of 21 at the time of the shooting, were sentenced to 14 years in prison. Three other people were sentenced to between 7 and 14 years for aiding and abetting the crime. The seven were convicted for assistance to murder and assistance to attempted murder, as authorities could not prove precisely who was holding the murder weapons.  Perpetrators  All perpetrators behind the shooting grew up in the northern parts of Biskopsg√•rden district, or had connections there. The majority of the accused have East African origins, particularly Somalia, but had mainly grown up in Scandinavia. * Adam Abdulahi was 28 years old at the time and is a Danish citizen. He was sentenced to life in prison for two murders and 24 attempted murders by the district court. The courts of appeal upheld the life in prison sentence, but changed the classification of the crime charges from two murder to two assisted murders. Five of the 24 attempted murder were changed into a charge of \\"putting people in danger\\" (Swedish: framkallande av fara f√∂r annan) and he was sentenced for those five. He procured the police vest, rented the two apartments where the shooting was prepared and the escape vehicle. In 2011 he was sentenced to 30 months in prison for drug offences and drug smuggling. The sentence was partially served in Denmark. * Ahmed Warsame, 25 years old, was sentenced to life in prison. Warsame was involved in purchasing the escape vehicle. For some years he lived in England but he returned to Gothenburg in February 2015, only a month before the shooting. In March 2014 he was shot in the foot, the day after Adam Abdulahi was fired upon. He received the same prison charges and sentence as Abdulahi. * \\"The Security Guard\\", 21 years old. He grew up and lived in Biskopsg√•rden, had training from Swedish Armed Forces and professional permit to work as a security guard. He knew the other perpetrators from school. Unlike the other perpetrators he had good grades from secondary education and had several steady jobs. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison. He was also sentenced for having shot and killed a victim in his 50s in the Br√§mareg√•rden area. * \\"The Footballer\\", 21 years old, grew up in Biskopsg√•rden and had previous convictions for robbery, unlawful driving and minor drug offences. He had connections to the group Pantrarna (\\"the panthers\\"), which was supposed to help by working with assisting and informing vulnerable districts in the city, but also comprised several members with connections to organized crime. He was a young aspiring football professional who was ready to sign a contract with Chelsea Football Club,Aftonbladet, dokument√§r, fotbollen och v√•ldet before he participated in the shooting. He received a sentence of 14 years in prison by the district court, but the court of appeal shortened his sentence to 12 years in prison due to his younger age. * \\"The Car Renter\\", 21 years old, lived in Biskopsg√•rden until 2014. He had several for serious crime, the first at 15 years old when he was arrested for possessing a weapon. He was sentenced in 2010 and 2014 again for possessing a weapon, battery and theft. He procured the balaclavas used during the shooting, two bulletproof vests and rented the white Volvo which was used. He received a sentence of 14 years in prison by the district court, which was upheld by the court of appeal. * Two further accused were sentenced for assisting the shooting, one of which is believed to have committed arson in another part of the city to distract emergency service. The two who received the longest sentences had their names published by Sveriges Television, contrary to standard practice, as their crime had a great impact on the general public, as the majority of the customers in the pub were ordinary law-abiding citizens. Three of the perpetrators did not have their name published as they were 19‚Äì20 years old at the time, a fact which was taken into account by the courts as well for their sentences. The three perpetrators aged 21 were later named as Jonis Adan, Josef H√§llgren and Onur Corap. In 2018, Jonis Adan was incarcerated in Saltvik, a prison with the highest securiy level. In the spring of 2020, Adan was moved to Salberga prison from Kumla prison. Later the same year prison authorities had recorded eight counts of disordely conduct for Adan while in prison, among which was using violence against another prisoner. Casualties Innocent random bystander Petar Petrovic, 20, a Swedish citizen of Serbian origin, who worked at the pub as a DJ and was scheduled start university in London, was killed. The other casualty was a 25-year-old who was reported to have recently been released from jail and said to be a leading figure in a local gang, called V√•rv√§dersligan after the square where the shootings took place. Another gang member is said to have left the pub just before the shootings. Several people were reported dead following the attack, with police saying the death toll is expected to rise. Emergency services told newspaper GT that eight people were taken to hospital and two people were confirmed dead. Motive The shootings are widely regarded as being probably related to rivalry between immigrant gangs for control of the illegal trade in drug smuggling. Hells Angels, Bandidos Motorcycle Club and gangs made up of members of several immigrant groups reportedly battle for control of the local drug trade. Police spokeswoman Ulla Brehm was quoted as saying that the attack could have been gang related and was not terror related. Aftermath The events sparked a national debate about gun crime in Sweden's second largest city. According to Associated Press reporter Karl Ritter, the problem of gang violence is exacerbated by the fact that the gangs operate in, \\"immigrant neighborhoods, where people come from other countries where perhaps they don't have the same trust in their authorities as people in general do in Sweden.\\" According to The Guardian, \\"Sweden has been shocked by the barbarity and indiscriminate nature of the Gothenburg shootings... The tragedy has also shone a spotlight on a hidden aspect of Swedish society that reads like the subplot of a Stieg Larsson novel, in which poverty, racism and segregation are driving young men from immigrant backgrounds into gangs and gun crime.‚Äù This crime is part of a recent wave of crimes that, according to Swedish journalist Joakim Palmkvist, play into \\"the hand of the far right,\\" driving centrist voters to support the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats. The police and prosecutor was criticized in Aftonbladet and other media for translating gangsta rap lyrics that the shooters had listened to before and after the shooting, and using this as part of the evidence in the case.

It passed to the Great Southern Railways in 1925, and was withdrawn in 1936. Wirral Railway Four were sold to the Wirral Railway between 1913 and 1921; all passed to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923, and were renumbered 6758‚Äì6761, after the block of LNWR 5ft 6in Tanks. Cardiff Railway One was sold to the Cardiff Railway in 1914; it passed to the Great Western Railway in 1922, but was withdrawn in May of that year. Decline Withdrawals started in 1905: 118 were scrapped in the years up to 1923 grouping, leaving 90 to be passed to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. They were allocated power class 1P, and assigned the numbers 6515‚Äì6600 and 6758‚Äì6761; although only 37 survived long enough to receive them: withdrawals restarted in 1924, and when the last was withdrawn in June 1936, the class became extinct. None were preserved.

For around five years, he trained many Taiji lovers from both Malaysia and Singapore; many of them later became well-known Taiji masters. Cheng had learned Xingyiquan and Baguazhang from Sun Lutang or one of his students before studying Taijiquan and had added several of Sun's methods to the training. Some martial artists in Cheng's lineage, especially those who learned from disciple Woo Hsing teach this.

The film was produced by Simon Nasht of Smith & Nasht in collaboration with Trish Lake of Freshwater Pictures and was co-directed by Richard Todd of Aquarius Productions with Jonathan Stack. The film also features the president of Lock the Gate, Drew Hutton, conservative radio personality Alan Jones and many other residents of Queensland and New South Wales. Frackman officially premiered in New South Wales in March 2015 and began a regional tour in marginal electorates before the 2015 New South Wales election. Frackman won Best Film and Best Environmental Film at the 2015 Byron Bay International Film Festival. The film is scheduled for release on DVD and digital platforms on 9 December 2015.  Production  Aquarius Productions commenced production on Frackman in early 2011. The film was shot in Queensland and New South Wales and according to director, Richard Todd, the story is told \\"through the eyes of Dayne 'The Frackman' Pratzky\\". By November 2011, Todd had followed sub plot character stories with Drew Hutton, Jeremy Buckingham, Dr Marian Lloyd Smith, Bob Irwin, Barnaby Joyce. Alan Jones had been filmed at a community gathering in Bowral and also in Brisbane. Time- critical shoots had already occurred and further filming was expected to occur in mid 2013. Editing was expected to follow in late 2013. Todd, who was born in Newcastle and hails from Margaret River in Western Australia has said that he is \\"attracted to stories that require a very close and personal relationship with a central character.\\" He has also said that he has \\"the ability to be 'let in' to complex and difficult to film situations.\\" In April 2014, Richard Todd was editing the film with Axel Grigor and announced that the film would be released in \\"the second half of 2014\\".  Release  The film was launched with a preview screening in February 2015 in Adelaide, closely followed by a regional Australian tour which commenced in New South Wales in March. The film's promotional poster featured endorsements from conservative radio commentator Alan Jones and former leader of the Australian Greens, Bob Brown. The film had its USA premiere at DOC NYC on 14 November 2015. The film is scheduled for release on DVD and digital platforms on 9 December 2015. Reception Frackman won Best Film and Best Environmental Film at the 2015 Byron Bay International Film Festival. The film subsequently began a screening tour, during which it played to many full houses. Following a preview screening of Frackman in Adelaide in February 2015 as part of the documentary film festival DocWeek, the Energy Resource Information Centre published a list of 'Frackman Facts' on their website. The centre also questioned the commitment of public funds to the project and described Pratzky as having \\"made it a personal mission to disrupt, protest and demonise an industry that he doesn‚Äôt agree with.\\" The film attracted criticism from former Federal Australian Labor Party leader Mark Latham who described it as \\"a fracking false alarm\\" in an opinion piece published by the Australian Financial Review. He went on to criticise the anti-fracking movement by describing it as \\"one of the most fraudulent, misinformed and irrational pieces of politics I have ever seen.\\"  Funding controversy  Prior to its official release, the feature-length documentary film Frackman attracted attention due to the substantial state and federal government financial support it received. A private company, Frackman Films Pty Ltd was registered on 17 June 2013. The film received $220,000 from Screen Queensland, $156,400 from ScreenWest (Western Australia) and a further $200,000 from Screen Australia. The West Australian newspaper published that it understood that the Screen West funding equated to 15% of the production's total budget, with the production also eligible for a $435,000 film producer tax credit. The film's co-producer, Trish Lake from Freshwater Pictures, described the government funding as an example of Government supporting free speech. Queensland's Arts Minister Ian Walker agreed, telling the media: > ‚ÄúIf anyone was looking for proof that freedom of speech flourishes in > Queensland, this documentary is it.‚Äù Western Australian Acting State Premier Kim Hames told The West Australian: > \\"The State Government supports the jobs, energy supply and opportunities > that a well-regulated shale gas industry can provide for WA families... > However, we also support the independence of the ScreenWest funding > selection process, which does not involve State ministers. I am advised the > ScreenWest board considered this project at length and took into account > artistic and production merits.\\" Pratzky found the Government funding funny but said that he didn't believe that it undermined the production. He said of the production: \\"It‚Äôs telling the truth and cutting through a layer of propaganda.\\" The film's producer Simon Nasht described the film as \\"polemical\\" and \\"not a documentary that the public broadcasters, the ABC or SBS, would touch with a barge pole.\\" = Screen Australia project assessment = Following the film's release, internal documents released via Freedom of Information Act request revealed that two of the three Screen Australia assessors had questioned director Richard Todd's \\"lack of experience\\" or \\"relative inexperience.\\" Prior to funding approval the assessors expressed concerns related to the proposal's \\"finance plan, high budget and certain line items.\\" In May 2013, film producer Simon Nasht had received a letter from Mary-Ellen Mullane, one of the assessors, who requested that Simon Sheikh's editorial/creative control and co-producer status be removed from the contract. Mullane wrote that \\"GetUp!'s contribution can only be considered as an alternative distribution strategy, not a co-production partner.\\" = Philanthropic support = The production also attracted philanthropic support by pitching at an event called Good Pitch, hosted by the Documentary Australia Foundation at the Sydney Opera House. In total, over $2 million was raised between seven different feature- length documentary film productions which pitched to an audience of approximately 300 on the day. Frackman also partnered with Getup! and Lock the Gate and was officially launched in March 2015, followed by a tour of New South Wales, then screenings in Western Australia and Victoria in April.http://www.melbourne.foe.org.au/frackman Distributor Madman committed $10,000 towards Frackman at the event and offered to work with eOne to maximise home entertainment revenues. Producer Trish Lake said of the fundraising at Good Pitch: > ‚ÄúWhile some... goes to production, the majority will be spent on outreach ‚Äî > building audience interest and excitement ahead of the roll out early next > year as it starts an innovative campaign across rural Australia in cinemas > and community halls and culminating in city theatres for city dwellers... It > will be a roll out over many months with a dialogue we hope for whatever > time it takes for state and federal governments to re-think their current > deals with the global gas industry.‚Äù The film's financials and legals were managed by Daniel (Dan) Lake, nephew of producer Trish Lake. Dan Lake was appointed as a director of production investment at Screen Queensland on 3 November 2014.  Missing interviews  = Gladstone LNG export contracts and environmental approvals = The film's director Richard Todd told the media that his team was surprised that gas export approvals in Queensland had been granted.

It is a two-story frame building located a short way north of the small community of Solomon, which is at the mouth of the Solomon River about east of Nome on the Nome-Council Highway. The roadhouse was built in 1904, during the days of the Nome Gold Rush, which brought many miners to the Solomon River as well, resulting in the establishment of the communities of Solomon and Dickson, and the construction of a railroad. After the gold rush declined and the communities were devastated by storms and floods, the roadhouse and other buildings were relocated about a mile north of the coast in the 1930s. The roadhouse operated until the 1970s. The roadhouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

Biography He was born around 1745 and he was one of Ioannis Kolokotronis's five children. He was of medium height and was dark-skinned. When he was still young he worked as an armatole in Corinth under the command of Halil Bey for four years. He developed close connections with some of the most influential families of the Peloponnese and soon accumulated significant power himself, to the point of influencing the choice of the Ottoman governors (vali) of the Peloponnese. During his four years of service under Halil Bey, he developed the plan of driving the Turks out of the Peloponnese. He became close friends with the renowned klepht Panagiotaros. In 1762 he quit his job as an armtole, climbed the mountain Taygetus and with Panagiotaros's help he built a fort at Kastanitsa of Mani and two small houses close to it. From there he began launching raids against the Turks. In 1770, he took part in the Orlov Revolt and the battles that followed, where both his father and two of his brothers were killed. He fought the Turks across the Peloponnese. In one ambush at the bridge of Birbaga in Katsana he managed to kill one of the most infamous leaders of the Albanian irregulars, Bekiaris, along with 36 of his men. At another incident, near Androusa, he managed to kill another infamous Albanian leader called Veizos and 24 soldiers of his men. With these deeds, he managed to encourage around 5,000 Greeks to go to the mountains and become klephts. On 10 June 1779 along with other Greek klepht leaders and 3,000 men he participated the so-called \\"massacre of the Albanians\\", in which the Ottoman Kapudan Pasha Cezayirli Gazi Hasan Pasha destroyed 12,000 Albanian irregulars and ended their depredations in the Peloponnese. Hasan Pasha soon turned against him, and gathered ships and 14,000 men and landed at Gytheio to capture him. Kolokotronis and Panagiotaros made their last stand at the Siege of Kastania, where Panagiotaros was captured alive and killed. Kolokotronis received an almost fatal blow from a sword. While he was dying, he was found by 7 Turkish soldiers, who cut him to pieces. They threw his head in a hole and his body over a cliff.

The UK Albums Chart is a music chart compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC) that calculates the best-selling albums of the week in the United Kingdom. Initially based solely on the sales of albums in the vinyl and CD formats, digital albums began being included from April 2006. Since March 2015, the chart has also been based on audio streaming figures, however the OCC still compiles a 'sales' (only) chart and still quotes these traditional sales figures in its features and articles. Note: The 21st century actually began in 2001. This is a list of the 50 best-selling albums in the UK from 1 January 2000 onwards, as compiled by the OCC (sales that occurred before 2000 are not included). Of these, only two were originally released before the year 2000: White Ladder (1998) by David Gray and Gold: Greatest Hits (1992) by ABBA. Back to Bedlam by James Blunt, which was the best-selling album of the 2000s decade, was also the best-selling album of the 21st century until August 2011 when it was passed in sales by Amy Winehouse's Back to Black, following Winehouse's death the previous month. Less than four months later, however, Back to Black was itself overtaken by Adele's 21. As of October 2019, 21 remains the biggest-selling album in the UK since 2000 (and fourth best-selling ever), having sold over 5,160,000 copies. Adele is also the only artist to have all her studio albums released appear on the list. Best-selling albums since 2000 Sales figures from the OCC on the date given in the reference.

Founded in Dubai in 2008, the company retails its products in Dubai and in Europe, Hong Kong, and Malaysia.  History  Al Nassma Chocolate is the United Arab Emirates' first and only camel milk chocolate brand, founded on October 22, 2008. The development and launch of the brand took almost four years.  Products  The company's products include 70g camel milk chocolate bars in several flavours: whole milk, nuts and cocoa 70% (dark), Arabia (with a mix of Arabian spices such as cardamom and cinnamon), macadamia orange and dates; camel-shaped chocolates, Camel Caravan, with macadamia nut and honey cream filling; hollow camel figures; and various kinds of pralines. Arab cuisine traditionally includes camel milk in various forms, and was a staple of the diet of Bedouins until mid-20th century. The company uses mild cocoa beans roasted in a manner that doesn‚Äôt overpower the slight saltiness of camel milk. Its 70g chocolate bars are wrapped in double printed gold foil; while pralines are packaged in boxes resembling camel hide. Wooden boxes sourced from Holzmanufaktur Liebich in Germany are used for Camel Caravan, and the camel figures are wrapped in golden foil, and packed in gift boxes.  Production process  Al Nassma manufactures its own chocolates from cocoa beans. In 2006 the company set up a Halal-certified production facility. The milk from which the chocolates are produced comes from camels at the Camelicious Farm in Umm Nahad, Dubai. The farm belongs to Emirates Industry for Camel Milk & Products (EICMP). The farm houses over 3,500 camels. The camels are milked twice daily, yielding around 5,000 litres of raw camel milk, which is pasteurised in an ISO 22000 certified dairy plant. A portion of the milk is bottled for sale under the Camelicious label. The remaining is freeze- dried and airlifted to be sent to a factory in Austria where the chocolate mass is manufactured in a chocolate mass factory. Al Nassma makes use of around 150 ml of fresh and pasteurised camel milk in one bar of whole milk chocolate. All ingredients ‚Äì including camel milk, sugar, cocoa beans, cocoa paste, cocoa butter, bourbon vanilla, honey, Arabian spices, pistachios, dates, macadamia nuts and orange zest have no artificial colour or additives. The molding of most products as well as most of the packaging is done at the company‚Äôs headquarter in Dubai, UAE.  Spread & reach  Since its inception in 2008, Al Nassma has sold its camel milk chocolate mainly through camel- shaped kiosks. There is also an Al Nassma branded shop at the Camelicious camel farm in the desert. There are sales kiosks at The Dubai Mall, including ‚ÄòAt the Top‚Äô, Burj Khalifa, the Burj Al Arab, Souk Madinat Jumeirah, Jumeirah Hotels & Resorts, Bab Al Shams Hotel, Emirates Towers Hotel, Atlantis, The Palm, Kempinski, Grand Hyatt and Anantara Hotels & Resorts. It is sold in duty free outlets in the Persian Gulf region, including Dubai Duty Free, Qatar Duty Free. In 2009 Al Nassma started exporting its camel milk chocolates via UPS to Japan, Hong Kong, Malaysia and the US, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Czech Republic, France and the UK. The products are sold in retail locations within UAE shopping malls, hotels and resorts and in duty frees in several countries. They are also sold at Julius Meinl am Graben in Vienna and Prague since 2013, and at Selfridges in London since early 2014, and KaDeWe in Berlin. In June 2014, Al Nassma and Gebr. Heinemann opened duty-free sales in Vienna Duty Free and Istanbul Duty Free, and on cruise liners of MSC Cruises. References  Bibliography *Deborah R. Prinz, Deborah Prinz.

These underground parties got famous for mixing synthpop, new wave, acid house, funk and rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll into a new and fresh sound, setting new standards for the Belgian club culture.Djbroadcast article on Eskimo Recordings International as well as local talented DJs such as Mo & Benoelie (later to be The Glimmers), TLP and The Flying Dewale Brothers (later to become 2 Many DJs) were usual guests at the turntables. As the Eskimo Fabriek needed refurbishment at the turn of the century, the Eskimo parties moved on to the Culture Club, and the temporary Belmondo concept at the S.M.A.K museum.Eskimonde album review in 'De Morgen' However, the vibe of these parties kept going through a new label that was founded in 2000 by Stefaan Vandenberghe and Dirk De Ruyck: Eskimo Recordings. From the very start, timeless quality and originality were the key values upon which the label was based. Old and new music were carefully combined into a fancy fresh sound. The first compilation release reflecting this Eskimo ethos came out in June 2000: Eskimo: Various Artists And Many Others. This first volume was compiled by Dirk, Mo & Benoelie and featured 70‚Äôs disco and funk as well as pop-soul, obscure acid hip house and new soul gem Revival by Martine Girault. The subsequent volumes 2-4 evolved into a kind of Balearic attitude, akin to DJ Alfredo‚Äôs approach in Ibiza's Amnesia in the late 80s. In 2002, a darker sounding strain of compilations called Serie Noire was released. These compilations relate more to a sound Ghent was familiar with before the Eskimo existed: the new beat. Soon after that, Mo & Benoelie acquired an international DJ status under the name of The Glimmers,The glimmers discography allowing them to spread the Eskimo ethos across the globe. This allowed the Eskimo story to evolve; the compilations were still defined generically but came with a DJ attached now. Various DJs made several compilations, respecting the \\"Eskimo approach\\" The Glimmers had started: dig deep in the crates to form a unique listening experience. Throughout the years, Eskimo grew into an independent label that presented new talent such as Lindstrom & Prins Thomas, who released their successful debut album in 2005 with Eskimo Recordings. This led to several releases with the like-minded Aeroplane, who immediately caused a splash across Europe and particularly in the UK, becoming the label‚Äôs most recognized act. Time flew by quickly, and in 2012 Eskimo Recordings got to celebrate a decade of existence and did it with a fancy packed compilation release called Eskimonde: A Decade of Eskimo Recordings. This 5-CD release explores the label's catalog from a few different angles. Two \\"retrospective\\" discs come along with newly commissioned remixes as well as two final discs that show The Glimmers splitting up for solo mixes, both coursing through Eskimo's back catalog. A year later, in 2013, Eskimo Recordings gracefully entered its second decade of collection releases with a new concept: the color collections. These collections contain each a set of carefully selected songs that were all produced exclusively for this concept. As of June 2016, Pink, Blue, Green, Orange, and Yellow collections have been released. In 2016, Eskimo Recordings was recognised as one of Europe's most inspiring young label and was selected by the IMPALA and The Independent Echo for the FIVEUNDERFIFTEEN campaign.

The word means mix or stir in Kiswahili, and koroga is precisely what diners do for themselves with a bounty of chopped ingredients and spices. A bit like camping in the city, parties situate themselves in semi-private huts each outfitted with a charcoal-burning jiko (stove). Despite the rustic elements, diners enjoy a full bar with table service ready-to-order starters. As the process of cooking (with chicken curry being the most popular entree) takes several hours, and Koroga dinners are known to grow tipsy while they cook‚Äîor watch. While in the 1980s Sahara City became another popular place the ones that are popular now are many including Spice Roots, Curry in Hurry, Nairobi Gymkhana and Goan Gymkhana. There now a new place called Shooting Star in Parklands that even offers chicken flown in daily from Kisumu. These are popularly known as \\"road runners\\", as they are free range, and take a while to cook due to the lean meat. While everyone seems to agree that Karoga is not an imported concept, descriptions of where and when the now-commercial dining style developed are mixed. A manager at the Mystique Gardens from western Kenya suggests that Karoga began in Kenya centuries ago with families cooking fresh fish for themselves on the banks of Lake Victoria. According to him, Karoga has only existed as-such in cities for approximately five years. According to others it started as a result of Indian railway workers. For it to be a true Koroga, Nish Lakhani should be present. Nish is a terrible Koroga chef himself, but adds ingredients willingly regardless and provides entertainment by insulting any mzungus present and taking over the music system. Nish can be found in his own bar in Karen, when they are open; public bars in Karen or at one of his friends bars. You can ask anyone in Karen for directions. Koroga became popular in the 1980s when Nairobian's started to the Bowling Green Restaurant in the City Park and were introduced to self cooking at a commercial place. Before that groups would meet at a friends house with one or two of them cooking while others would enjoy the weekly gathering.

He was United States champion in the 120 yd hurdles in 1892 and 1893 and in the 220 yd hurdles from 1892 to 1894. Biography Fred Puffer was the son of Customs deputy collector Alfred Puffer, who died while his son was still young. The younger Puffer's athletic career began in 1887 with YMCA and the Olympic Athletic Club. His first major successes came at the 1892 national (AAU) championships, where he ran for the Manhattan Athletic Club; he won both the 120 yd high hurdles and the 220 yd low hurdles and helped his club win the team title. Puffer's time in the high hurdles, 15.4, was better than the world record but had been wind-aided; additionally, he had knocked down hurdles, which at the time also invalidated performances for record purposes. The 1893 AAU championships were held in conjunction with the World's Fair in Chicago, and the New York Times promoted the occasion with a special medal to be awarded to the best athlete of the meeting; the medal's value exceeded the allowable limit in amateur competition, and had to receive a special exemption from the Amateur Athletic Union. Puffer set his sights on this medal, declaring himself the favorite to win it; James E. Sullivan, secretary of the AAU, also considered Puffer the favorite. At the championships, Puffer repeated his hurdles double from the previous year, but sprinter Charles Stage also won two events; the judges were unable to decide which of them deserved the medal, and after both Puffer and Stage refused to draw lots for it, the matter was referred to the AAU to be decided later. In the end, the medal was cut in half, with both athletes receiving one part. In addition to hurdling, Puffer was a good long jumper, winning Metropolitan and Canadian championship titles in that event in 1893; his mark at the Metropolitan meet, 22 ft in (6.83 m), ranked him in the world's top 10 that year. At the 1894 AAU championships Puffer won his third consecutive title in the low hurdles, but was beaten in the 120 yd hurdles by newcomer Stephen Chase, who set a new world record of 15.6. In the following years Puffer became an athletic instructor and competed only at the games of the 22nd Regiment, which he belonged to; in 1897, he and Eugene Goff were declared professionals and ineligible for amateur competition on the grounds that as instructors they received money from sports. Puffer served with the Army in Cuba during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898 until he was sent home due to his failing health; he never fully recovered, remaining in poor health for his final years. He died of pneumonia at his mother's home in New York City on July 22, 1900.

It was built by ISS Reshetnev and is based on the Ekspress-2000 satellite bus. It is equipped with 17 C band and 36 transponders. It has a design life of 15 years. Development history https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/yamal-401.htm https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/yamal-401-2.htm In February 2009 Gazprom ordered two Yamal-400-type satellites from Thales Alenia Space. The satellites were name Yamal-401 and Yamal-402. Thales Alenia Space was to be responsible for all aspects of the development and building of the satellites. Both satellites were to be based on Spacebus4000C3 satellite buses. However, later in 2010 Gazprom changed their satellite order so that the Yamal-401 satellite would be developed by ISS Reshetnev and be based on their Ekspress-2000 satellite bus. Thales Alenia Space would deliver the payload for Yamal-401 as originally agreed (also, no changes on the payload side of things). There were no changes with the Yamal-402 satellite, with Thales Alenia developing and building the whole satellite as originally planned. Originally, both Yamal-401 and Yamal-402 were to be launched by Ariane 5, but the launches were changed to Proton-M rockets.

Early life and personality Born on 2 April 1910, Beatty was the younger son of David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty and his wife Ethel. An heiress in her own right, Beatty's mother was the only daughter of Marshall Field, an American millionaire who was involved in the department store business in Chicago. His mother's death in 1932 made Beatty a millionaire. As a baby Beatty suffered from ophthalmia neonatorum. It affected his eyesight and personality throughout his life; he was frequently high-strung, and his eyesight gradually deteriorated. Beatty had consulted eye specialists in the UK and the US and also had many eye surgeries; none were able to offer him any improvement for the condition. Beatty was described as having a shrewd business sense, particularly when it came to horses and horse racing. He was also said to be witty and at times, mischievous. Despite his failing eyesight, Beatty managed to obtain a commission in his father's old unit. He served with the company in the Middle East until his secret was discovered and he was honourably discharged from service. He was a tall, dark and handsome man who had once been named one of Britain's most eligible bachelors. At the time of his death Mereworth Castle in Kent was his main residence. Aly Khan and his wife, Rita Hayworth, were Beatty's guests at the castle for the running of the Epsom Derby in June 1949. Horse racing Beatty's nickname was \\"Lucky\\" because of the success he had enjoyed at an early age in horse racing. He told friends that he had consulted a fortune teller, who told him he would win the Epsom Derby with a horse whose name had three \\"s\\" in it; four years later, Beatty's Bois Roussel won the race. In 1936 Beatty inherited Reigate Priory, the last private individual to own the property, and added stables to the grounds for his racehorses. He sold the property to the Mutual Property Life and General Insurance Company in 1942. Beatty was also involved in horse breeding; the noted racehorse My Babu was bred by Beatty. Beatty had racehorses trained at Beckhampton by Fred Darling. He purchased the racehorse Bois Roussel from Leon Volterra for ¬£8,000, and it went on to win The Derby on 1 June 1938. The horse had been listed as having 20 to 1 odds. The win surprised both Beatty and many others at the racecourse. King George VI, whose horse, Licence, was also entered in the race, invited Beatty to the Royal Box after the win. The Derby victory won Beatty around $50,000. Beatty and Prince Aly Khan were friends and business partners, sharing a love of horses and horse racing. Beatty and Khan were joint owners of Tant Mieux, the 1939 winner of the Gimcrack Stakes. Death and legacy Beatty died on 26 October 1949 after falling from a sixth floor window of The Ritz Hotel, London, having been informed that he was going completely blind. At the time of his death, Beatty's eyesight had failed to the point where he needed to be in the company of his valet to walk. He was wearing his pyjamas and a robe when he told his valet he was going to the sixth floor of the Ritz to visit friends there. He then fell six floors to his death at the rear of the hotel. Beatty's most recent eye surgery was on 5 September. His brother, David Beatty, 2nd Earl Beatty, with whom he was living at the time, said that after the surgery Beatty began to lose what little sight he had left, but gave no indication that he intended to kill himself. A coroner's verdict was that Beatty had committed suicide, since he had recently learned that there was no hope of saving his sight. It upset Beatty greatly that his blindness meant that he could no longer see his racehorses. For a number of years, he needed to have someone describe the races to him when he went to a racetrack. His estate was valued at more than ¬£306,000 in 1950, equivalent to ¬£29.1 million as of 2013. Mereworth Castle was left to Michael Lambert Tree, Beatty's nephew. Tree was a son of Ronald Tree, Beatty's half sibling from his mother's first marriage. Ronald Tree's other son, Jeremy Tree, inherited Beatty's bloodstock and became a racehorse trainer himself.

It is the first earthquake in England for which there are reliable reports indicating damage. The moment magnitude of the shock was estimated to be above 5.0 and its intensity was placed at VII (Damaging) on the European macroseismic scale. Earthquake The earthquake of 15 April 1185 in the region of East Midlands was one of the largest and most damaging earthquakes the British Isles had ever encountered. The magnitude has been estimated at around 5 . Some think the epicentre of the earthquake was close to Nottingham in East Midlands. The epicentre has also been suggested to be in or around Lincolnshire. However, it could possibly be anywhere from Dogger Bank to the East Midlands. Some references talk of the earthquake happening somewhere offshore in the North Sea east of northern England; its effects may have been felt as far away as Norway. The historian Matthew Paris did not report it as being felt in London. His history records show that the first major earthquake in England since 1133 was the one of 13 February 1247. Damage There are reports of complete villages being totally demolished, including the villages of Raleigh and Danethorpe. The hamlet of Grimston, now referred to as Wellow, may also have suffered damage, but that is debatable as the land was used for expansion of Rufford Abbey, and there is confusion as to what actually happened to the small hamlet. Masonry houses were knocked down completely, which indicates an intensity of more than VII EMS at certain locations. Ralph of Diceto reported in writings done in London that it struck in northern England and that \\"in some places buildings were destroyed\\". There are also reports that stones were split (\\"petrae enim scissae sunt\\"); stone houses were knocked down; and that parts of Lincoln Cathedral were brought down. The damage to Lincoln cathedral has been a controversial issue because it cannot be determined to what extent the earthquake damaged it and what parts fell on their own due to poor construction. The city of Lincoln was reported to have been damaged by the earthquake.

History  TV Avisen was broadcast for the first time on 15 October 1965 - up until this point, television had already been broadcast regularly in Denmark for 14 years. This was due to an agreement signed between DR and the press in 1926 which guaranteed the press' control of the broadcast of news on television and radio. The agreement remained in place after the introduction of television and was rescinded on 1 July 1964. Initially, TV Avisen mostly consisted of footage from foreign news agencies with a musical accompaniment in the style of a newsreel. The programme began broadcasting in colour in October 1978. Five years later, the television news operation moved from its small studios at Radiohuset in Rosen√∏rns All√© to TV-Byen in Gladsaxe. In 1988, DR lost its monopoly in Danish television news when second government broadcaster TV2 (founded in 1988) began broadcasting its own news service. In an effort to compete, the main 7.30pm programme was replaced in 1993 by two evening bulletins at 6pm and 8.30pm. The following year, the programmes were moved half an hour later to 6.30pm and 9pm. In 2006, the morning edition of TV Avisen was axed due to low viewing figures. In the same year, DR's television, radio and online operations were combined in the new DR Byen complex in Copenhagen. TV Avisen received a new design and began broadcasting in 16:9 widescreen. In 2012, the late evening programme was moved to 9.30pm on Monday - Thursday nights. On June 13 2017, TV Avisen was rebranded with updated titles and a new studio design.  Current Broadcasting Times  * Daily at 18:30 for 30 minutes. * Daily (except Saturday) at 21:30, Monday-Friday for 25 minutes and Sunday for 15 minutes.  Features of the Programme  TV Avisen always begins with a short summary of the news. The top story tends to concern a Danish issue. TV Avisen has its own permanent correspondents in Washington DC, New York City, Rome, Brussels, China and the Middle East, as well as a special climate correspondent. As is usual for Danish television, reports which contain foreign languages (for example interviews with foreign politicians or foreign press conferences) are not dubbed in Danish, but subtitled.  Online Streaming  All TV Avisen programmes from the previous 30 days are available from the DR website. Livestreaming is only possible when using an IP address from Denmark.

Since 2005, the chart has been based on the sales of both physical and digital albums, on the condition that the album was available in both formats. In January 2007, the rules were changed so that legal downloads of all albums, irrespective of whether a physical copy was available, were eligible to chart. Further changes occurred in February 2015 when audio streaming was included for the first time. On 11 December 2019, the OCC announced their list of the top 100 best-selling albums between January 2010 and December 2019. The best-selling album of the decade is Adele's 21, which sold over 5.17 million following its release in January 2011. Adele is also one of two artists to achieve three million-selling albums since 2010 with 19 (released in 2008 but sold over a million copies since 2010), 21 and 25.

Early life and exile Fritz Wegner was born in Vienna on 15 September 1924 into a family of assimilated Jews. Following the Anschluss, a drawing he made of Adolf Hitler to amuse his classmates enraged a Nazi-supporting teacher at his school. As a result he suffered a terrible beating. His parents arranged for the 13-year- old Fritz to leave Austria, alone, in August 1938 for London. They and his sister were later able to join him in exile. Education On the strength of a sketch of a man drawn from memory, he was offered a scholarship to St Martin's School of Art at the age of 14, together with accommodation in Hampstead Garden Suburb with the family of one of his tutors, George Mansell, who also taught him English. Wegner paid his way by helping in Mansell's studio. As Wegner recalled in an interview: ‚ÄúIt was an extremely generous thing to do and indeed I lived with them for several years, learning everything I later knew about lettering, penmanship, gilding and the Roman alphabet. That was the start of an early passion, after which I moved on to doing illustrations.‚Äù He studied at St. Martins School of Art from 1939 to 1942. Career In 1942 he was classified as a \\"friendly enemy alien\\" and assigned to war work on the land in Buckinghamshire, gaining further education from his co-workers, mostly conscientious objectors. He also managed to obtain an appointment as poster artist for the Buckinghamshire War Agricultural Committee. While living in Buckinghamshire he met the journalist Janet Barber, who was living in a nearby village and they were married two years later. He also submitted cartoons to the Evening Star and later became a lodger in London with the editor of the paper's diary column. Establishing himself in London after the war he became a freelance graphic artist. Wegner began his long career as a freelance illustrator by working for the magazine Lilliput and drawing book jackets for a range of publishers. Hamish Hamilton was the first publishing house to launch him as an illustrator. During a long relationship with the company he worked on book covers and jackets for adult and children's books, and illustrations for a wide range of children's books. He drew the covers for the English editions of The Catcher in the Rye (1951) and Raymond Chandler's The Long Goodbye. He illustrated religious works by Dorothy L. Sayers such as The Story of Noah's Ark (1956), The Story of Adam and Christ (1953) and The Days of Christ's Coming, (1960) in a slightly medieval style. Some of his illustrations for Mordecai Richler's Jacob Two-Two Meets the Hooded Fang (1975) riff off and rework George Cruikshank's illustrations for Oliver Twist. Working constantly to support a family of three children, Wegner undertook a range of illustration work for John Bull, Puffin Annual, Radio Times, Farmers Weekly, Everywoman, Woman and Beauty, as well as postage stamps for Christmas and other festivities and, from 1973, a string of drawings for the American children's magazine, Cricket, which featured running commentary by insect characters. His work is noted for its historical detail and gentle irreverent humour. One if his most reprinted works is his illustrations for Fattypuffs and Thinifers: ‚ÄúIt gave me the opportunity to test my invention and humour, the two ingredients I most wanted to bring to my drawings‚Äù. Speaking of his creative process in an interview in 2001, Wegner told Tom Morgan-Jones: > \\"My one regret is that my roughs are very often better than the finished > artwork. They‚Äôre more spontaneous, they have a greater creative sparkle and > you don‚Äôt have to worry too much about sizes and all the constraints you > normally have to work with.\\" Wegner developed a collaborative partnership with Allan Ahlberg, particularly after the death of Ahlberg's wife Janet, his co-author and illustrator, in 1994. Wegner was a visiting lecturer at St Martin's for 25 years from 1969. (2) He taught a younger generation of British illustrators, among them Sara Midda, Linda Kitson, Patrick Benson, Nick Sharratt, Glynn Boyd Harte, Nicola Bayley, George Hardie, and Phillida Gili. Wegner was twice shortlisted for the Kurt Maschler Award (for a \\"work of imagination for children, in which text and illustration are integrated so that each enhances and balances the other\\"), the first time for his illustrations for Michael Rosen's Till Owlyglass, and then for his work for Brian Alderson's The Tale of the Turnip. Personal life Wegner married Janet Barber in 1945, with whom he had a daughter and two sons. His wife and children all survived him. He spent his leisure time painting for pleasure and was a collector of books, paintings and engravings, as well as of musical instruments and china. He died on 15 March 2015.

She was noted for her mellifluous voice and wistful singing style. The Mellows recorded several hit songs in the 1950s, including \\"Smoke From Your Cigarette\\", \\"Yesterday's Memories\\", and \\"How Sentimental Can I Be?\\" Life and career Leach was born in Harlem and grew up in the Morrisania neighborhood of the Bronx in New York City. As a child she sang in church and in talent shows. In 1953, at the age of 16, she met Harold Johnson, John Wilson and Norman \\"Polecat\\" Brown at a party; they were singing in harmony, and she joined in. When the young men asked her to join their singing group, she was shocked: \\"Girls didn't sing in the groups then. It was for the boys.\\" The group, named the Mellows because of their preference for ballads, recorded four singles on the Jay-Dee label in 1954. One song from this period, \\"Smoke From Your Cigarette\\", was played regularly on Alan Freed's radio show and made the New York R&B; Top 10 list in 1955. Another, \\"I Still Care\\", was written by Leach, her first and only songwriting credit. The group also performed live at local venues, including Harlem's Club Baby Grand. Leach suffered from severe stage fright, and had to drink to calm her nerves before performing. The group switched to the Celeste label in 1955 and were joined by Arthur Crier and Gary Morrison. After recording two more singles, and quite a few songs that were never released, they switched labels again: this time to Candlelight, where things only got worse. Leach's name was misprinted as \\"Lillian Lee\\" on the group's first single with Candlelight. On their second, Leach was reduced to singing backup for Carl Spencer. Finally, in 1958, the Mellows recorded two more tracks for Apollo Records, \\"So Strange\\" and \\"Be Mine\\", which were never released. With almost nothing to show for their years of hard work, the group broke up in 1958. Leach gave up singing and went to work in a factory on 134th Street. A few years later she left to become a housewife and raise her son, Sean. Then in 1984 she was persuaded to rejoin the Mellows, with a new lineup that included Arthur Crier, Eugene Tompkins, and Gary Morrison (who was later replaced by Sammy Fain). The group performed at a variety of venues over the next twenty years, including Radio City Music Hall in 1984 and the Apollo Theater in 1987. In 1985 they coordinated the production of \\"Don't Let Them Starve\\", a benefit recording that included dozens of R&B; artists. In 1994 Leach joined the Morrisania Revue along with other performers from the area. Leach's last public performance was in 2006, backed by the Cliftonaires, at a United in Group Harmony Association (UGHA) show. She died of lung cancer in 2013. Influence As one of the few female doo-wop singers in the 1950s, Leach helped pave the way for female singers in soul and R&B;, and has often been cited as an influence by later artists such as the Chantels and the Shirelles. She is described in Notable Moments of Women in Music as \\"one of the premier R&B; lead singers of the fifties\\". Rock musician Lou Reed, a lifelong doo-wop fan, was enthusiastic in his praise of Leach and the Mellows. In a 2011 Rolling Stone article, Reed included \\"Smoke From Your Cigarette\\" at the top of his list of favorite songs, adding, \\"Lillian Leach has a beautiful, sad voice, like a femme fatale.\\" He mentioned the song in his speech when he inducted Dion into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989. In a later interview, looking back at his early career, he said, \\"Everyone was going crazy over old blues people, but they forgot about all those groups, like the Spaniels, people like that. Records like 'Smoke From Your Cigarette,' and 'I Need a Sunday Kind of Love,' the 'Wind' by the Jesters, 'Later for You, Baby' by the Solitaires. All those really ferocious records that no one seemed to listen to anymore were underneath everything we were playing. No one really knew that.\\" Although the Mellows never had a national chart hit, several of their songs have become doo-wop classics over the years. Leach and the Mellows were featured in Voices of Doo-Wop, a 1994 National Geographic Explorer documentary on doo-wop music.

Azurite, the blue congener of malachite, was known as armenion, as it was mined in Armenia. On heating, malachite decomposes to carbon dioxide and copper, the latter inducing the soldering effect.

ISIL forces had been present in the city since February 2015, before the Fall of Nofaliya. After Nofaliya fell to ISIL forces, the Tripoli-based government had decided to send reinforcements to recapture Sirte. The battle The fighting began 14 March 2015, between forces of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant and the forces of the Libya Shield Force. No death toll was initially given, but the fighting was described as being violent, and stopped at dusk. Among those killed was Ahmed al-Rouissi, a Tunisian ISIL commander. On 18 March, 12 Tripoli government soldiers were killed during fighting against Islamic State fighters; 10 in Nofaliya and 2 in Ben Jawad. On 25 March, ISIL attacked a Brigade 166 checkpoint, 15 kilometers west of Sirte, killing five militiamen. Over the next two months, sporadic fighting took place around Sirte. On 20 May, ISIL forces again attacked a Brigade 166 position. According to a Libya Dawn official, 23 ISIL fighters and one soldier were killed. On 28 May ISIL captured the nearly-ruined Ghardabiya Air Base and the Great Man-Made River water project outside of Sirte when Libyan Shield Forces withdrew. Over the next few days, Libya Shield Forces withdrew to positions 12 miles west of Sirte, after ISIL advanced to the east, south, and west of the city. Aftermath During August and September, new clashes erupted in Sirte between pro-Gaddafi loyalists and ISIL forces. On 23 September, ISIL once again asserted its control over the whole of Sirte after it expelled all the remaining pro-Gaddafi elements. In February 2016, U.S. officials believed that there were 5,000 to 6,000 ISIL fighters in Libya,Andrew Tilghman, Size of ISIS force declining in Iraq and Syria, according to new intel, Military Times (February 4, 2016), and gave a maximum estimate of up to 6,500.Declan Walsh, Ben Hubbard & Eric Schmitt, U.S. Bombing in Libya Reveals Limits of Strategy Against ISIS, New York Times (February 19, 2016). This marked an increase from previous estimates in the 2,000 to 3,000 range. Many of ISIL's new recruits came from Iraq, Syria and Tunisia. At this point, ISIL's strength was increasing in Libya while simultaneously declining in Iraq and Syria. In May 2016, the Government of National Accord launched a new offensive to retake Sirte.

The property is locally significant as a farm property that was worked continuously by the same family for more than 150 years, dating to the period of the area's earliest settlement. Its surviving buildings are all 20th century structures, but may contain elements of older buildings. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009, and was delisted in 2020. Description and history The Lagassey Farm is set about east of the main village of St. Agatha, on Main Street (Maine State Route 162). It consists of a roughly wedge-shaped parcel, in size, with about of frontage on Long Lake at the northeastern end, and of width at its southwestern end, about away. The property is a combination of woodland and open fields, and includes the narrow strip of land between Main Street and the lake. Of the of agricultural fields, about half are under a federal crop protection program and are normally out of production except for period mowing. The farmhouse is set on the southwest side of Main Street. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with an asphalt shingle roof and a concrete foundation. The front facade (facing northeast) is three bays wide on the first level and two on the second. A single-story hip-roof porch extends across the front and around to the left, with a solid shingled balustrade and square posts. The main entrance is off-center in the central bay, with a single sash window to its left and a double sash window to its right. The second level has a pair of symmetrically-placed sash windows. The southeast and northwest elevations have two sash windows at each level, the southeast also having a secondary entrance between the windows. The interior follows a fairly typical central-hall plan, with four rooms on each floor. The property (or at least some property in the area) was known to be in the hands of Joseph Lagasse as early as 1874, although he did not receive a deed for this property until 1892. It was a fairly common practice of the period to require homesteaders to clear and develop land before they would be granted title. In proceedings relating to an 1874 court case over conflicting land claims, Lagasse claimed to have occupied the land in 1851. His 1892 deed was for ; the property has since shrunk due to the sale of house lots along its edges. The present house was built in 1946, replacing Joseph Lagasse's original homestead. When the property was surveyed in 2008 for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, a number of outbuildings; including a barn and granary containing elements of 19th-century buildings, were describe. It is unclear whether these buildings are still standing; they do not appear on satellite views of the property.

At the ground breaking ceremony on 10 February 2007, the ceremony was graced by Archbishop, Nicholas Chia. The first mass was celebrated at Hai Sing Catholic School on 18 April 2009 with the Church community, even though the Church building was not ready. The mass at Hai Sing was simple, yet dignified. The Church then opened its doors on 12 December 2010. Father Piotr Prusakiewicz from Poland brought with him the relic of Saint Faustina, the patron saint of Divine Mercy. For three nights, Fr. Piotr led the congregation through devotions to the Divine Mercy and Mass to prepare the community for the Dedication and Blessing of CDM. The highlight was the Dedication and Blessing of the Church on 9 January 2010. Mass was celebrated by His Grace, Nicholas Chia.

This was Hugh Ruttledge's second expedition as leader. Heavy snows and an early monsoon forced their retreat on several occasions, and on the final attempt two climbers narrowly survived an avalanche. This was the first expedition in which climbers were able to carry portable radios. 1935 reconnaissance expedition The British had been sending expeditions to Mount Everest since the 1921 reconnaissance but none had managed to reach the summit. These had been planned and financed by the Mount Everest Committee, a joint committee of the Royal Geographical Society and the Alpine Club. The 1935 reconnaissance was a preliminary to an attempt on the summit of Mount Everest in 1936. Led by Eric Shipton, it was a small, low-cost effort which confirmed that the best route from Tibet was up the East Rongbuk Glacier to the North Col. In monsoon conditions in 1935 the party had not got much higher than the Col. Planning With Nepal still closed to climbers, the approach was again to be from the north side of the mountain. Above the North Col a few routes had been prospected on the 1922, 1924 and 1933 expeditions and a full-scale expedition (the largest yet) was again to be embarked upon. Long afterwards Shipton wrote The rancorous arguments within and surrounding the Everest Committee preceding the 1935 reconnaissance had led to Shipton replacing Hugh Ruttledge for that one expedition but Ruttledge was confirmed as leader for 1936. Bill Tilman and Dan Bryant had not acclimatised well at altitude and so were not included in the party - both men agreed this was the right decision, Tilman even to the extent of providing financial support. Tilman then proceeded to show the decision had been wrong by leading a very successful team to reach the summit of the Nanda Devi in 1936, at that time the highest mountain to have been climbed. Frank Smythe (Everest 1933) was de facto climbing leader and Shipton (1933, 1935), Percy Wyn Harris (1933), Edwin Kempson (1935), Charles Warren (1935), Bill Wager (1933) and Edmund Wigram (1935) all had previous Everest experience. Peter R. Oliver and James M.L. Gavin were brought in as \\"new blood\\" having impressed Smythe in the Alps. John Hunt was rejected after a medical examination detected a heart murmur and he was warned to be careful climbing stairs. Non-climbing members were John Morris (transport, 1922), Gordon Noel Humphreys (doctor) and William R. Smijth-Windham (communications, 1933). Oxygen equipment was to be taken and they had radio equipment allowing contact between base and Darjeeling. The total cost was to be about ¬£10,000.  Expedition Sketch map of region north of Mount Everest The party travelled via Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Kampa Dzong and were blessed by the Lama when they reached Rongbuk Monastery on 25 April 1936 in fine weather and good snow conditions on the ground. Sixty porters had accompanied them from the start and another one hundred were recruited at Rongbuk. By 9 May Smythe, Shipton and Warren had reached the North Col at using the same line as the 1935 reconnaissance. Heavy snow that day and next delayed progress and destroyed the steps cut to the Col itself so a fresh attempt was made on 13 May, led by Smythe. Smythe had been asked to save his energies for the summit by not cutting steps himself so he appointed Sherpa Rinzing to lead. This was the first time a Sherpa had led on an Everest climb. Fixed ropes had been installed to Camp IV at the top of the Col in five days whereas in 1933 it had taken fourteen. Over the next two days Camp IV was established using 96 carries by porters, leaving thirty-six at the Col from where Smythe and Shipton were poised to establish the camps towards the summit. For the first time the climbers were able to use portable radios - the ones of \\"extreme lightness\\" weighed only . However, on the north ridge conditions were not good with soft snow lying deep so, with more snowfall on 18 May, Smythe retreated to Camp III at the foot of the Col. Ruttledge then decided to withdraw to camp I because the conditions up to the Col had now become too dangerous. News arrived that the monsoon had reached Ceylon - a very unusually early date. Judging they only had two weeks available they started off again on 23 May but with the news that the monsoon had already reached Darjeeling and was advancing at a surprisingly rapid rate. Two days later it had arrived at Everest itself. On arriving at Camp III they were again driven back by the snow, leading to a third occupation of the camp a week later. On 4 June climbers again reached the Col but it was going to be impossible to get the porters up there. Beset by bad weather, they stayed at Camp III for two days until Wyn Harris persuaded Ruttledge, against his better judgement, to allow him and Shipton to try again. They only just survived a massive avalanche on the steep slope up to the Col. Shipton later wrote \\"It was a ridiculous thing to do, but we were rather desperate.\\" So, the attempt on the summit failed without their oxygen equipment having been able to be tested at altitude. Smythe and Wyn Harris reconnoitred the mountain at the foot of the North Col on the other (western) side. They decided that, in monsoon conditions, an ascent from that side would be safer though less wind-protected. However, the higher ridges of the mountain would not be climbable anyway. The expedition departed Base Camp on 17 June and before the expedition was over they had written a long letter calling for the reform of the Alpine Club. Upshot The expedition publicly was perceived to have been a failure even though the British Everest establishment had been successful in covering up the debacle concerning the planning of the expeditions of 1935 and 1936. George Finch, forever a villain of that establishment was in a position to speak out because he had been excluded from all expeditions except 1922. He wrote \\"we are beginning to look ridiculous\\", that future expeditions should be planned and led by climbers, there should be a permitted age range of 25‚Äì35, the leadership should not be military, and that the inherent risks of mountaineering need to be accepted. He added \\"no personal attack is intended\\". Tenzing Norgay wrote in a more supportive manner: In 2013 Smythe's son published a biography of his father in which he describes a set of copies of letters his father sent while on the 1936 expedition. One was to Teddy Norton saying that when scanning the north face of Everest through binoculars from base camp he had seen something looking like a body. Mallory or Irvine's ice axe had been found by the 1933 expedition and what he had seen was in a gully just below where the ice axe had been found. Smythe's letter said \\"It's not to be written about as the press would make an unpleasant sensation.\\" A 1999 expedition found Mallory's body at this place and photographs of his remains made newspaper front pages internationally.

Family and education Reynell born on September 4, 1881, in Glenelg, a suburb of Adelaide, Australia. She was the third of the five children of well-to-do land agent and wine-grape grower Walter Reynell and his wife Emily (n√©e Bakewell). She was the granddaughter of John Reynell, who is thought to have established the first commercial winery in South Australia, and the cousin of suffragist Elizabeth Webb Nicholls. Walter Reynell had inherited his father's large estate, and it was there that Gladys grew up and was home-schooled, before matriculating at Tormore House School in North Adelaide. Gladys Reynell initially studied medicine at the University of Adelaide but left to study art. By 1903, she had joined the School of Design's Art Club in Adelaide and that same year she exhibited work at the South Australian Society of Arts' annual show. In 1907, the painters Margaret Preston and Bessie Davidson established their own studio where they offered classes, and Reynell began studying painting there with Preston, who was to become a close friend. In 1912, Reynell and Preston traveled to Paris, where they stayed for a year before moving on to London and Ireland. Their plans were derailed by the outbreak of World War I and by the death of Reynell's younger brother Carew at Gallipoli in 1915. The following year, at the instigation of her surviving brother Rupert, Reynell (and Preston) began to learn pottery at the Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts in London, with the goal of teaching it to disabled soldiers. The earliest surviving pieces of Reynell's pottery date from this period, and she had already begun to manifest an interest in using clay from her native land by having a sample of clay from Kangaroo Island sent to her in London. In 1918, towards the end of the war, Reynell and Preston began teaching pottery to soldiers at the Seale Hayne Neurological Hospital in Devon, where Rupert was a surgeon. The following year Reynell returned home when her father fell ill. He died on April 8, 1919, in Reynella, a town in South Australia that his father had established. Career and personal life In September 1919, Reynell and Preston shared an exhibition of paintings and pottery at Preece‚Äôs Gallery in Adelaide, which was just becoming established as a center of the city's cultural life. In his opening address, the governor of South Australia expressed the then-common view that he did not understand the modern style of art, while agreeing that \\"the work now exhibited is certainly the work of great artists.\\" Following this show, Reynell established her own pottery studio at Reynella. She thus became one of Australia's earliest studio potters and the first person in South Australia to take part in all stages of the production of ceramics from finding clay deposits and building her own kiln all the way through the throwing, glazing, and firing stages. (Australian aboriginal artists did not develop their own pottery tradition, so it was European settlers like Reynell who brought the art of pottery to the continent.) She remarked on her excitement over using clays native to Australia \\"that had never before known potter's hands.\\" Reynell's pottery consisted mainly of earthenware bowls, cups, and other kitchenware decorated with designs of Australian animals and flowers. Her pottery forms were based on European folk art models, while the decorations were created using traditional slipware and sgraffito techniques. Many of her early works were made of McLaren Vale clay with a reddish-brown slip; later she became known for a deep cobalt blue body color (over a paler clay body). The bold, linear decorations that were her hallmark were inspired by a number of sources: by the Arts and Crafts movement, by Aboriginal art, and by the abstract modernism championed by the English artist Roger Fry. All of her pieces were unique; she never showed any interest in developing commercial lines of ceramic work. Running Reynella Pottery single-handed proved difficult, and sometime after 1920, Reynell hired George Samuel Osborne, an ex-serviceman and gardener, as her assistant. They developed a close relationship and eventually decided to marry. Since Osborne's family had worked as servants for the Reynells (and possibly also because Osborne was ten years Reynell's junior), her rather snobbish family disapproved of the match. Nonetheless, Reynell and Osborne were married at St Mary‚Äôs Church, Edwardstown, in 1922 and then moved to Ballarat in Victoria state, where they started Osrey Pottery. The firm's name was an amalgam of their surnames. Their products were very popular and were sold in Melbourne through the Primrose Pottery Shop and also at street fairs, where Reynell would sometimes draw attention by throwing pottery on the spot. They were forced to close the pottery business in 1926 after Osborne contracted lead poisoning from the lead in the glazes, and this catastrophe drove them into poverty. In the 1930s Reynell returned briefly to painting and printmaking, sometimes exhibiting under her married name. Osborne recovered his health enough to join the army during World War II, and the couple moved to Melbourne, where Reynell supported the war effort through jobs with the army pay corps and as a translator of French. Reynell died of cancer on 16 November 1956; her husband scattered her ashes at Reynella. Reynell's reputation was slow to take off, in part because she worked to a great extent isolated from the larger Australian art community (first at Reynella, later at Ballarat). In addition, because she was pioneering the field of ceramics in Australia, she lacked both a community of peers and an educated audience. Her work only began to be collected systematically in the late 1960s, and her pottery and other works (including paintings, linocuts, and sketchbooks) are now in major Australian collections, including the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, and the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney. The South Australian Art Gallery holds a portrait of Reynell in her mid-twenties painted by her friend Bessie Davidson.

The island is a conservation property of the Maine Coast Heritage Trust, and is open to the public, with two small campsites. The island was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 for the significance of its prehistoric archaeological sites. It is named for the saltwater pond located at its center. Description Pond Island is located in Penobscot Bay, south of the western portion of Brooksville and roughly west of Little Deer Isle, one of the major islands of the town of Deer Isle. The island is geologically a combination of barrier sand dunes that were joined at a small knoll, with a small pond at its center that is connected to the bay via a tidal channel. The island is oriented roughly east‚Äìwest, with slight tilt placing the western end further north than the eastern. Off the western end is a smaller islet called John's Head, which is joined to the island at low tide. The eastern end of the island is subject to erosion. The island consists of a combination of sand dunes and salt marshes, woods and meadows, in addition to the salt pond. This mix of habitats supports a wide array of wildlife, mainly shorebirds and wading birds. John's Head is a significant nesting area for gulls, eiders, and guillemots. There are two small campsites available for public use (advance permission required for their use by larger groups), and a trail leads to the island's high point. The area around the salt pond is known to be rich in archaeological artifacts; investigation has yielded evidence of human habitation dating from historic times as far back as 2000 years. The island was purchased c. 1979 by Philadelphia Conservationists, Inc., a Pennsylvania-based conservation group. It granted Acadia National Park a \\"forever wild\\" conservation easement to the island in 1982, and turned it over to the Maine Coast Heritage Trust in 1995.

Olmstead additionally writes that \\"carelessness with numbers when coupled with his fundamental misunderstanding of economic logic\\" leads Baptist to vastly overstate the importance of cotton to the antebellum American economy. In a separate review of the book in the JEH, Eric Hilt writes, \\"much of its economic analysis is so flawed that it undermines the credibility of the book.\\" Hilt argues that Baptist's calculation of the share of cotton in antebellum America's Gross Domestic Product \\"is a disastrously mishandled undertaking, full of obvious manipulations that overstate cotton's contribution.\\" A 2020 study in the Economic History Review rejects Baptist's thesis that slavery was necessary for American economic development.

First published in early 2015 and focused on the V√§sterbotten province, the newspaper aimed to help homeless European Union migrants ‚Äì who are primarily Romani people from the Balkans, especially Romania ‚Äì to support themselves by providing an alternative to begging on the streets. Distributed for free to the migrants, each newspaper was sold for 50 Swedish krona, the profits going entirely to the seller. A second purpose was to create a debate in Swedish society about the conditions faced by these people. Preparations for the newspaper began in 2014, on suggestion from Ilile Dumitru, who had seen Situation Sthlm being sold by the homeless of Stockholm. The newspaper was created by the association SAMS, a coalition of several different organizations and churches in Skellefte√•. The first issue ‚Äì numbering 5,000 ‚Äì was printed by Norran, and featured content created by various writers on a non-profit basis. It was distributed in Skellefte√•. The second issue, with 15,000 prints, was likewise printed by Norran and financed by volunteer donations. To support the newspaper an association called the Dik Manusch V√§nner (Friends of Dik Manusch in English) was formed. In the beginning of 2017, the editorial staff came to the conclusion that they no longer got enough content sent in to be able to publish an issue. A few months later it was decided to disband the association and to cease publishing the newspaper. In November 2018, former Dik Manusch editor Britt-Inger Lundqvist started the online newspaper DIKKO which claims to be a successor publication to Dik Manusch.

The airport was defended by soldiers and guards supporting Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, Yemen's internationally recognised president. Background Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was ousted from power by the 2011 Yemeni Revolution, was widely suspected in 2014 of allying with the Houthis in their successful insurgency against the government of his former vice president and successor as president, Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi. After the Houthi takeover of Sana'a and a monthlong detention by militants, Hadi escaped to Aden in February 2015, followed some weeks later by his defence minister, Major General Mahmoud al-Subaihi. Saleh stated the week before his forces assaulted Aden International Airport that he would drive Hadi into the Red Sea. In Aden, where Hadi was working to establish a rival government with international backing, clashes erupted earlier in March when he tried to dismiss Brigadier General Abdul-Hafez al-Saqqaf, a Saleh loyalist with command over two army units and special security forces. Developments Attack on the airport Al-Saqqaf's special security forces stormed the airport early in the morning of 19 March, claiming they were fired upon from surrounding buildings. Army and militia units loyal to Hadi responded, eventually repulsing the assault. Some 100 passengers on a Yemenia flight to Cairo were evacuated from their plane on the airport tarmac due to the fighting. At least two shells exploded at the airport, killing at least four and injuring more than a dozen. Three soldiers loyal to Saleh were reported dead in the attack and 10 more were captured. A Boeing 747 passenger jet used as one of Hadi's presidential aircraft was damaged by gunfire. The fighting lasted about four hours and was eventually joined by al-Subaihi and his forces, who evacuated the airport terminal under heavy fire. Base assault After the defence of the airport, al-Subaihi's troops attacked the adjacent al-Sawlaban special police base in the Khormaksar district. After hitting it with artillery, Hadi-loyal soldiers and militiamen overran the base in the afternoon and looted it. Al-Saqqaf reportedly surrendered, turning himself in to the governor of the Lahj Governorate. \\"Many\\" special forces troops were captured, according to Reuters eyewitnesses. Although army, police, and militia units loyal to Hadi deployed on Aden's streets and at key locations throughout the city, pro-Saleh forces were successful in taking control of the local city council building, according to the Associated Press. Aftermath Airstrike against Hadi's compound In apparent retaliation for the fall of the al-Sawlaban base, at least one warplane reportedly controlled by the Houthis attacked Hadi's presidential palace later on 19 March in the al-Maasheeq district of Aden, firing missiles. Anti-aircraft guns responded, and smoke was seen rising from the compound. A second pass by the aircraft was thwarted by anti-aircraft fire. Hadi was reportedly in a different location at the time of the attack, and no damage was reported, according to a presidential aide. In at least two more instances as of 21 March, unidentified aircraft flew near the presidential palace and were forced off by anti-aircraft fire, Reuters reported. Assassination attempt on al- Saqqaf A convoy from Aden to Lahij including General al-Saqqaf came under fire in Al-Athawir overnight after the battle. Al-Saqqaf was uninjured, but a bodyguard was shot dead and three others were killed when their vehicle overturned, according to a Lahij security official. Civil war breaks out Two days after the battle at the airport, the Houthi Revolutionary Committee declared a \\"state of general mobilisation\\" against \\"terrorist elements\\" in southern Yemen. The declaration heralded the start of a military offensive by Houthi fighters and pro-Saleh army units. The airport was reportedly seized by Saleh loyalists on 25 March, only to be retaken on 29 March after the start of a bombing campaign led by Saudi Arabia. Responses The Houthi Supreme Security Committee in Sana'a issued a statement calling for an end to the clashes, saying both sides \\"are obliged to keep the peace and return to the negotiating table\\". Hadi condemned the attack on the airport as an \\"attempted coup\\" by al-Saqqaf. The editor-in-chief of the Yemen Post told Al Jazeera that the pro-Saleh troops who attacked the airport were still in Aden after the battle and could be expected to continue their attacks on Hadi.

The trip, which took 128 flight hours, hopped through North Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Macao, Aparri in northern Luzon and then finally on to Manila. Only Loriga's plane completed the flight. Gallarza and Loriga (on the right) during a layover in Yangon. Career Raised in a stately house known by the parish as Pazo de Li√±ares in Lal√≠n, he joined the army and the pilots division in the Spanish Military Aviation Service in 1920. Two years later, Loriga was stationed to the conflict in the Rif War where he was responsible to supply military bases surrounded by the local rebels, in May 1924, his squad shot down the only rifian plane. Loriga was cited for bravery with the Militar Medal for his services during the war and promoted to work in the Cuatro Vientos Airport in the Spanish capital. First trip in Autogyro At the end of 1924, the Captain Loriga, after an eight months residence in the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure de l'a√©ronautique et de l'espace in Paris, decided to support the engineer Juan de la Cierva with the validation of his recent invention, the Autogyro \\"EL PRIMER VIAJE DEL AUTOGIRO\\" MADRID CIENTIFICO, 1924.

From Spain to the Philippines Statue of Joaqu√≠n Loriga in Lal√≠n, Pontevedra. Author: Francisco Asorey In 1924, Loriga, as squad leader, proposed the idea of an air route from Spain to the Philippines. At that time no direct air connection existed between Europe and the Far East, even when France and UK were studying that possibility, considering their conquests in the area. The motivation to sponsor the trip was the connection between the old Spanish colony and Spain, with current commercial links and a considerable Spanish population in the capital, together with a memory of the old colonial times as more beneficial than the contemporary American occupation. Three Breguet XIX left Madrid on 5 April 1926, but only one plane made it to Manila. The other two planes were forced to land and were abandoned in the North African desert and on the coast of China. After each stopover, the pilots rested whilst the engineers checked the airplanes. Then, at the beginning of the next flight, the engineers tried to sleep on the rear wing. During the flight between Tripoli and Cairo, one of the biplanes flown by Rafael Mart√≠nez Est√©vez had to return to Tunisia due to an engine failure. Loriga, after flying through Iran, Pakistan, India and Vietnam, was forced to execute an emergency landing for a leakage of water in the biplane. He landed in Tien- Pack harbour, close to Guangzhou, in China; the crew were missing for several days, believed to have crashed into the ocean. Loriga, together with the pilot Eduardo Gonz√°lez-Gallarza\\"Eduardo Gonz√°lez-Gallarza\\", continued flying in the last biplane. The pilot registered strong dust storms between Karachi and Agra, and takeoffs in fog after Calcutta, so they could only use their Stinchilla compass for navigation, the first time only instruments used in Spanish aviation. The two explorers landed in Aparri on 11 May at 2:20 in the afternoon; a multitude of Filipinos, whom the pilots described as frantic with enthusiasm, gathered around them and carried the Spaniards on their shoulders. The pilots later wrote: \\"We must confess our emotions on stepping on that land, our temples pulsated violently, our hearts beat madly and childish tears flowed from our eyes.\\" The final stage of their flight came in the morning of 13 May. Gallarza and Loriga bade farewell to the officials and residents of Aparri, dropping small Spanish flags over Tuguegarao, Iligan, and Echague along the way as a salute to them. The pilots were escorted by 12 airplanes of the United States Army as they were halfway to Manila. At 11:20 in the morning, the two completed their mission. On 27 May, Loriga Taboada traveled to Macao to meet with his engineer, disassemble the biplane and pack it for transportation in the steamship Claudio L√≥pez before his departure to Spain. First airplane landing in Galicia Moreover, Loriga is recognized for being the first pilot in land in Galicia, his homeland, over the Monte do Toxo in Lal√≠n 23 July 1927. The same day of his return to Cuatro Vientos, Loriga died in an accident, when the aircraft crashed during a landing at Cuatro Vientos Airport outside Madrid. His fellow villagers raised money to honour him with a monument, tasked to Francisco Asorey, inaugurated in the village on 1933.

History It was written sometime around 46 BC. The work is dedicated to Marcus Brutus. In the introduction, Cicero praises Brutus' uncle Cato the Younger who was still alive at this date. Cicero was motivated to write the work in order to re-express Stoic arguments within the language of rhetorical Latin. Cicero states his intention is to make a version of an original Greek work in a language appropriate for the mode of the Forum. He defends the paradoxes with popular arguments, sometimes hardly more than a play upon words, and illustrates them with anecdotes from history. It is thought that he did not regard these essays as serious works of philosophy, but rather as rhetorical exercises. Elsewhere Cicero criticizes these paradoxes: especially De Finibus iv. 74-77 and Pro Murena 60-66. The earliest manuscript dates are from the 9th century. Later, Marcantonius Majoragio (1514‚Äì1555) wrote a work criticising Cicero, entitled the Antiparadoxon.  Contents  The subject of the work is to examine a principle of Stoic thought: the paradoxes. The work is concerned specifically with six of these:Studies in the History of Christian Thought I - Virtue is the only good In this book Cicero presents the Stoic classifications of what elements of life are genuinely good, and what elements are not good. There are three different qualities of something being genuinely good: righteousness (rectum), intrinsic honor or nobility (honestum), and intrinsic virtue (cum virtute). This can be understood as the inner person, and the choices and actions that they engage in. Worldly desires and material objects such as power, money, houses, Corinthian vases, and fine furnishings are not necessarily genuinely good, and are spurious or apparent goods called forth by the many. Similarly, pleasure is not genuinely good. What is genuinely good shouldn't turn out to be bad. Genuine goods should uniformly make a person good, and should make their possessor happy. Spurious or apparent goods do not satisfy desires, but rather, arouse yet more desire or lust (libido), as well as fear (metus) that one might lose these things that they presently possess. While human beings consider pleasure to be good, it is not a distinctively human good, as animals also possess the capacity for the enjoyment of pleasure. Human beings have minds and thus a higher nature, and the call of pleasure is the voice of cattle, and not of human beings. Thus those who attain ownership of those things which are genuinely good will realize their full capacity as human beings. II - Virtue is sufficient for happiness Virtue is all that is needed for happiness. Happiness depends on a possession which cannot be lost, and this only applies to things within our control. III - All the vices and all virtues are equal All good deeds are equally meritorious and all bad deeds equally heinous. All virtues are equal as this corresponds to the same impulse towards the good. Cicero does not attempt to defend the Stoic position of the moral equality of all offenses; instead he offers a weakened version that offenses of the same sort are equal. He notes the Stoic position that all crimes are equal since they all involve the same intent to break the law, but he then argues that crimes do not bear the same penalty since the matter depends on the status of the person injured and that of the criminal. Thus he ends up imposing gradations of vice based on external factors. IV - All fools are mad There is a substantial lacuna at the beginning of this section. The remaining part argues that every fool is an exile and the wise person cannot be harmed. Cicero attacks an unnamed personal enemy for causing his exile. The essay is thought to be a thinly veiled attack on Cicero's enemy Clodius. Cicero asserts that his own exile was not a hardship since he possessed the correct Stoic wisdom and virtue. V - The sage alone is free Only the sage is free and every fool is a slave. Cicero attacks an unnamed military leader who is unworthy of command because he cannot control his passions and thus is not free. The target here may be Lucullus. Cicero satirizes costly luxury and affectation of connoisseurship in collecting works of art. Freedom involves the rational control of one's will. Only the sage is free since he freely chooses the good. VI - Only the wise person is rich If a rich person's wealth is measured by the quantity of their goods, then a wealthy person with no virtue is poor, since virtue is the only good. People confuse reasonable needs with unreasonable desires and this leads people in power to pursue irrational passions. Editions *Paradoxa stoicorum ad M. Brutum (Latin) (ed. J. G. Baiter, C. L.

He had utopian ideas and was involved in various cooperative experiments. He was the author of the 1896 booklet Les Sky Scratchers in which he extolled modern technological developments. Early years Auguste Marie Fabre was born in Uz√®s, Gard on 5 February 1839. He was the son of a preacher and Fourierist. His parents died when he was young, and he was brought up by a foster family near N√Æmes. He became an admirer of Charles Fourier from reading the books from his father's library. Fabre inherited a silk factory in Uz√®s, which he reopened. In the late 1860s he subscribed to the Fourierist journal La Science sociale. He began to correspond with Jean-Baptiste Andr√© Godin, founder of the Familist√®re de Guise, from 1868. He was enthusiastic about America, which he planned to visit, but the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 prevented the trip. Cooperative movement Fabre realized that his company, like the other silk factories in the Uz√®s region, could not fight competition from Lyon. He closed the factory and moved to N√Æmes in the early 1870s where he worked as a mechanic in a farm equipment factory. Fabre established a workers club in 1876 called La Solidarit√©, with about fifteen members. They met and discussed social issues, and the better educated taught the others to read and write. In 1878 he founded a workers' consumers cooperative, also called La Solidarit√©, with about thirty members. He also opened La Renaissance, a cooperative bakery. In 1879 Fabre was asked by Godin to help administer the Fourierist cooperative Familist√®re (Social Palace) in Guise. He probably reach Guise in the summer of 1880 and left after March 1881, but remained in contact with the Familist√®re afterwards. After returning to N√Æmes he devoted most of his energy to the cooperative movement. He worked with √âduard de Boyve, founder of the Abeille N√Æmoise cooperative in 1884, and with the economist Charles Gide (1847‚Äì1932). These three Protestant men founded the French cooperative movement that came to be called the √âcole de N√Æmes. The Soci√©t√©s Coop√©ratives de Consommation de France held its first national congress in Paris on 27 July 1885. The journal l'√âmancipation was launched at this meeting, and first appeared on 15 November 1886 in N√Æmes. Gide, de Boyve and Fabre all contributed to the journal. Fabre supported public education, and was one of the founders of the Soci√©t√© du Sou des Ecoles la√Øques. He advocated the organization of evening art classes for young workers. A friend of Numa Gilly, the socialist mayor of N√Æmes in the late 1880s, he obtained the creation of a Practical School of Industry and Commerce, and was on the board of this institution until his death. He also supported the pacifist and feminist movements. The precursor of the Peace Through Law Association was founded in N√Æmes on 7 April 1887 by six students led by Th√©odore Eug√®ne C√©sar Ruyssen (1868‚Äì1967). At first it was named the Association of Young Friends of Peace (Association des jeunes amis de la paix). It was Protestant in nature, influenced by utopian socialism and by the cooperative school of N√Æmes. Fabre was particularly influential on the young peace activists. Fabre was secretary of the Chambre consultative des coop√©ratives de consommation pour l‚ÄôH√©rault et le Gard. In 1889 he was appointed to the central committee of the Union coop√©rative des soci√©t√©s de consommation, holding this post until 1912. In his 1896 pamphlet Les Sky scratchers Fabre praised American-style skyscrapers, which he saw as the solution to the problem of housing workers. They were practical, hygienic, safe and easily subdivided. At the end of 1897 he was designated to help prepare for the cooperative exhibition at the Exposition Universelle (1900). In 1901 Fabre began to collect photographs of cooperative institutions that could be projected to support lectures. He used these materials for talks that he gave in the 1900s. In his last years Fabre left the cooperative movement and devoted much of his time to psychic questions and spiritualism. Auguste Marie Fabre died on 26 December 1922 in the home of his son-in-law in Geneva, Switzerland.

Fastcase, Inc., (M.D. Tenn. May 27, 2014), aff'd, No. 15-6336 (6th Cir. July 22, 2016), is a U.S. court case concerning defamation in online search results. The plaintiff, Colin O'Kroley, alleged that Google's automated snippet algorithm created a defamatory search result by falsely implying that the plaintiff had been accused of indecency with a child. The District Court granted Google's motion to dismiss the case, and found that Google had immunity from the defamation charges under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects interactive computer services from being held liable as a speaker or publisher for information provided by a third-party information content provider. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the District Court's decision. __TOC__ Facts The plaintiff, Colin O'Kroley, performed a Google search of his own name in August 2012. Among the search results was an entry that included the snippet: This snippet was generated by a Google algorithm, summarizing an ebook page produced from an ebook produced by Fastcase. The plaintiff alleged that, despite the underlying source document not containing any defamatory statements, the action of summarizing the document created defamatory statements. Google's algorithm removed the context of the O'Kroley v. Pringle lawsuit and created an implicit association between a case involving indecency with a child and the O'Kroley lawsuit when, in reality, there was no relation other than being published on the same page of court case summaries. The plaintiff claimed several causes of action stemming from this summarized search result. Google's motion to dismiss Google filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Under this motion, while the court must accept all well-pleaded factual allegations as true, the complaint must be more than \\"a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action\\" as determined in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly. Google argued that under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, as an \\"interactive service provider\\", it has immunity from the plaintiff's complaint. Under the statute, if Google satisfies the requirements for being an interactive computer service, then it has immunity for acting as a publisher of information provided by a third- party. O'Kroley argued that the act of summarizing a non-defamatory article into a defamatory summary created new content and turned Google into an information content provider and thus losing its protected status. However, courts have found the immunities provided under the statute as \\"quite robust.\\" The magistrate judge reviewing the case found that Google's automated editing and summarization process falls under the role of a publisher and thus Google has immunity from liability.Report and recommendation, O'Kroley v. Fastcase, Inc., No. 3:13-cv-780 (M.D. Tenn. June 25, 2014) Based on this conclusion, the district judge upheld the magistrate's recommendation and granted Google's motion to dismiss the complaint.O'Kroley v. Fastcase, Inc., No. 3:13-cv-780 (M.D. Tenn. June 25, 2014).  Appeal  On July 22, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the District Court's decision. Writing for the court, Judge Jeffrey S. Sutton held that \\"[t]he district court got it right\\" in dismissing each aspect of O'Kroley's claims.O'Kroley v.

With respect to O'Kroley's claim against Google, the court held that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act barred the claim.Id., slip op. at 2‚Äì4. Google's \\"automated editorial acts on the content, such as removing spaces and altering font\\", did not abrogate Google's statutory immunity, nor did the fact that Google \\"kept the search result up even after O'Kroley complained about it.\\"Id., slip op. at 3. O'Kroley's claims against other defendants were dismissed for procedural reasons,Id., slip op. at 4. and the court observed that several other points that O'Kroley raised on appeal \\"rang[ed] from the meritless to the frivolous,\\" stating that \\"[t]o restate some claims is to reject them.\\"Id., slip op. at 4.

Background right The Central-Alameda neighborhood of South Los Angeles was an area of sprawling American Craftsmen style homes. Its residents had initially been mostly white, but by 1930 the neighborhood had changed to predominantly black. By 1950 it was home to two all-black, segregated fire stations (Fire Station No. 14 and Fire Station No. 30). The Fire Chief Engineer of Los Angeles, John Alderson, was regarded by black residents as a staunch segregationist who was preventing the integration of the LAFD. After the 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown vs. Board of Education and other cases, Alderson asked the Los Angeles city attorney whether the decision affected his department, and was told that it did. Based on this, the Chief assigned black firefighters from the segregated fire stations to all-white fire houses, beginning what was to become a year of crisis for the LAFD. Newspaper writers penned articles both pro and con integration and while firefighters came together while fighting fires, the rest of the time spent in the firehouse was for the most part their own. With the introduction of blacks to all-white firehouses, and in particular Fire Station #10, the customary rituals between brother firefighters turned to the dark side, and those firehouses became tense battlegrounds at night. By the end of the following year some black firefighters had taken to being armed for their own protection, fearing retribution for some slight published in the papers or reported in the nightly newscasts or heard on radio broadcasts. By the 1950s the largest African-American newspaper on the West Coast, the California Eagle (1879‚Äì1964), owned and operated by Charlotta Bass, was taken over by its former writer turned City Editor, Lawyer Loren Millerwiki/California_Eagle in 1951. An early proponent (1920's under Editor J.B. Bass {d.1934} and followed by Charlotta) of integration and Civil Rights, the Eagle pushed for diversity and ran editorials against segregation as part of its platform. The Bass home is listed in the 52nd Place Historic District wiki/52nd_Place_Historic_District which is in the US National Register of Historic Places. In 1954 Loren Miller, active in the local NAACP, pushed to integrate the LAFD. Foundation In 1954, firefighter Arnett Hartsfield, Jr. founded the Stentorians with a fraternal group of black firefighters. The organization took its name from the Greek root, stentor, (meaning a powerful voice). They espoused non-violence and adopted the slogan, \\"We only fight the department on integration.\\" The Stentorians determined that to protect the men a round-the-clock patrol would deploy to guard the black firefighters at Fire Station 10. CBS Channel 2 news ran newscasts of recordings after a reporter provided the Stentorians with special microphones to record the night-long hazings. The media had been critical of Alderson and remained neutral over his conflict with fire commission. Alderson retired at the end of the year and Deputy Chief Frank Rothermel became interim chief engineer, and he posted until Alderson's successor was named. William L. Miller became the Fire Chief Engineer on January 17, 1956 and began to integrate the LAFD. Miller, not wanting to be in the same place as the man he replaced quietly went about the task. With some white firefighters backing integration and receiving punishment for it, the tide had turned against segregation and Miller went ahead and transferred black and white firefighters to Fire Station 7 at 2824 S. Main Street. Calling it an ‚Äòexperiment‚Äô, Miller had chosen men he knew were un-opposed to integration for the assignment at Fire Station 7.  The history of the Los Angeles Fire Department and the segregated firehouse at Station 30 The history of African-American firefighters in the LAFD began to take shape in the 1940s and 50s when individual firefighters and officers began organizing and making their voices heard. As their numbers in the ranks grew, slowly at first but; with the return of many blacks after serving in the military overseas they stood firm that there was a place for them at the table of Civil Service. Many, once appointed, were ostracized by their fellow firefighters, so the model of a fraternal organization was used across the country in forming groups. The most notable of the groups were the Vulcan Society of the FDNY and the Stentorians of the LAFD for them to join. Within those groups, black firefighters found solace among their brethren by holding their own affairs and allying themselves with other ostracized groups like the Jewish firefighters; both groups whom the mostly Irish and Catholic white firefighters opposed being part of firehouse life. The Battle for integration began with the Mayoral election of 1953. The Newly elected Mayor wanted to install his own Fire Chief, and sought a pretext to oust the then current head of the LAFD, Fire Chief Engineer John Alderson. A month after taking office, he was given a petition backed by the NAACP that protested that the LAFD did not represent the people it served because it was not integrated.http://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/afam/2010/Cover- AfricanAmericansinLA.pdf Sec E pg18 The Mayor, no fan of fair employment practices, sought to use this petition to get the fire commission to fire the chief engineer. Alderson wanted no interference from city hall but then was beset on another front. When the fire commission ordered him to produce a plan on integration and the white ranks learned of this, they raised $500,000 and formed a Fact Finding Committee to investigate whether integration was possible and petitioned the fire commission to hold any decision until Oct 14, 1954. Before the results of this committee was heard, the commissioners ordered Alderson to integrate, which he began to do. 4 black firefighters were sent to other houses from the 2 segregated ones and tensions ramped up, of course the Fact Finding Committee reported back to the commission that under no circumstances should integration occur. By then, the firehouses that were integrated4b. The federal reporter, Volume 813, Pub. 1987 Cases (United States Court of Appeals)- firehouse racial tension 1954 became hellhouses for the black firefighters. Nightly hazing had become warped and degrading, and when 6 more blacks were sent to Old #10, the tension was palpable.

The commission sheepishly let the dismissal drop, as it seemed they were being petty firing the retiring chief engineer. Early black recruits to the Fire Department On December 6, 1888, a black man, Sam Haskins, born a slave in 1840 from Virginia, was listed in the census as an employed Fireman for the city of Los Angeles, assigned to Engine Company #4. In 1892 Haskins was appointed as a Call Man and assigned to Engine #2, making him the first black man hired by the Los Angeles Fire Department. Haskins was fatally injured on November 19, 1895 while responding to a fire call on 1st Street. When the steamer he was riding on hit a bump in the road, Haskins lost his balance and fell between the steamer's boiler and the wheel. He was the first firefighter of any race to die on duty with he Los Angeles Fire Department. https://articles.latimes.com/2002/nov/24/local/me-then24 The second black fireman, George Bright, was appointed to the Department two years later, on September 21, 1897. Three years later he was assigned to the newly segregated Hose Company #4 on Loma Drive near Beverly Blvd. That is where all subsequent black firefighters were sent, following the Supreme Court ruling in Plessy vs. Ferguson that established \\"Separate but equal\\" as the law of the land. In 1900 William Glenn was hired as the third black fireman in the LAFD. He subsequently left to become the 3rd black patrolman in the LAPD. Arnett Hartsfield Jr. right Arnett Hartsfield, Jr. (died November 1, 2014 at age 95) was the co-founder of the Stentorians organization. He served as an Army lieutenant during WWII in a segregated unit. He became a firefighter and later an instructor. Hartsfield was appointed to the LAFD in 1940 and retired after 20 years working at Old Station 30 in south Los Angeles. While firefighting, he used the GI Bill to return to school and attended both UCLA and USC, earning a law degree in 1955. He retired in 1961 from the LAFD to practice law full-time. He fought to integrate the LAFD. He also served as the historian at the African American Firefighter Museum's Fire Station No. 30, Engine Company No. 30, where he spent 10 hours a week volunteering. His was the generation of black \\"firsts\\", many of whom are remembered for the integration fights that led the full appearance of the Civil Rights Movement in America. He was later appointed Civil Service commissioner by Mayor Tom Bradley and served as \\"Fire Chief for a Day\\", achieving the chance at promotion he felt he was unfairly denied while a firefighter. September 1956 Integration of the LAFD By the following September old #30 and #14 were integrated, all black firefighters formerly assigned at the segregated houses were transferred into 17 of the city's 91 fire stations. Hazings still occurred, but along the lines of the traditional firehouse fare all probies endured. The long crisis year of 1955-56 finally ended for the LAFD. Bradley Garret and Tolbert Young were the first blacks hired after integration. Both are terminated unfairly during their academy training, which path Jim Crow practices now took in the FD. (In 2009 a black probie in the diversity class on Randalls Island, NYC collapsed and died during training at the FDNY Academy, leading the Vulcan Society to question whether blacks in that class were being unfairly targeted for drop- on-request.) By 1959 barely 3% of the firefighters in the LAFD were African- American. During the 60 years following Alderson's departure, questions of whether he was a traditionalist protecting his department arose. In looking back, the questions can be answered and several observations apply to the segregation years. The foremost question is whether was it his opposition to integration that caused the crisis year of chaos? Yes, but until then, Jim Crow laws supported segregation, which Alderson believed in, and he had convinced himself that his legal obligations under the city charter prohibited assignments based upon race, albeit that some of the city's laws now ran against the rulings adopted by the supreme courthttp://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/afam/2010/Cover-AfricanAmericansinLA.pdf Sec E pg31 and made law everywhere across America. This fight to integregate the LAFD had re-vitalized the NAACP L.A.chapter under newly elected Pres. Thomas Neusom and v.p. Loren Miller, By the 1960s blacks and whites began marching en-masse to gain recognition culminating with the march on Washington and passage of the Voting Rights Act. The struggles of the Civil Rights era had begun with the stands made by Civil Service workers such as those Old Stentorians who fought for fairness and diversity in the ranks of the LAFD.

Kett and Terry Golway in the firehouse, the LAFD began to find itself under fire from the very communities they served. In 1965 Watts exploded into riots and firefighters of every stripe came under fire while on duty. The Stentorians came to understand a different sensibility of Jim Crow, namely harassment in various forms that didn‚Äôt quite rise to the level of racial animosity, but as ret. f.f. Arnett Hartsfield recounted in 1973,The Old Stentorians ‚Äì 1973 by A. B Hartsfield-Mills \\"I had a degree in Law yet I went to work and cleaned toilets!.\\" When the call came in 1969 from NY that a national black firefighter organization was being formed, the Stentorians stepped up. In 1970, Capt's David Floyd and John L.Ruffins Jr. of the FDNY Vulcan Society founded the International Association of Black Professional Firefighters, an international fraternal order that The Stentorians became a part of. Black firefighters across the country formed chapters and the gov't civil service firefighters in Barbados, BWI became a member making the organization international. The IABPFF is currently led by Pres. James Hill, a veteran 40yr Dallas, Texas Firefighter. 1980 The Stentorians acquire old Station # 46 at 1409 W. Vernon Ave. as their office and training center. By 1990, the Stentorians had divided into two chapters, The Los Angeles County Stentorians and the Los Angeles City Stentorians. Today, the Los Angeles City Stentorians membership consists of more than 400 AFRICAN-AMERICAN men and women Fire fighters and paramedics throughout Los Angeles. Both groups of Stentorians also belong to the International Association of Black Professional Firefighters, a national organization promoting equality for the fire service nationwide. In 1991 The Executive Development Institute is created at HBCU Florida A & M University. This program was created by the International Association of Black Professional Firefighters as an alternative to the National Fire Academy. The previous year, the Los Angeles County Fire union, Local 1014 had accused the Stentorians of cheating on the entry-level exam for firefighter. As a result of the allegation, the Fire Chief threw out the exam causing countless candidates to fail the new exam. The allegations were false and the union and the Stentorians endured a rift in their otherwise cordial relationship. The EDI was created as a response to this. Historically, Black firefighters had not been successful in attending the NFA for a variety of reasons. Later on, EDI was renamed in honor of Carl Holmes. Several members from the LAFD and the LACoFD graduated from the first class of this prestigious program. CarlHolmesEDI continues to exist today. Many of the traditions that Stentorians started over sixty years ago continue today, including \\"Mentoring to Youth in the Community\\", \\"General Community Outreach\\", \\"Career Counseling\\", \\"Career Enhancement & Upward Mobility\\", and \\"Labor Relations.\\" The members also serve as big brothers and big sisters for the Gwen Bolden Foundation. Through their involvement in the school system, the Foundation and the Stentorians have been able to offer community youth a viable alternative to the growing problems with gangs and drugs. The Stentorians have progressed and prospered over the years, becoming a well noted and respected organization in the community. Old Station 46 was renovated and became the home of the Stentorians, and renamed for Arnett Hartsfield Jr of the City and Van Davis of the County of LA fire depts.

Firefighter/lead Paramedic Michelle Banks served as the first President. On opening day, Fire Chief Bamattre spoke to the Old Stentorians and issued a formal apology for enduring a terrible time during the integration of the LAFD during the mid 1950s. Station 30, along with station 14, integrated in 1956 and was later closed in 1980. It is now home to the African American Firefighter Museum and is dedicated to collecting, conserving and sharing the shared history and heritage of African American firefighters. The history of African American firefighters in Los Angeles spans more than 100 years and provides a unique glimpse into the history of firefighting, race relations and segregation in the City. It was one of two segregated fire stations where black firefighters worked in Los Angeles between 1924 and 1955. It was built in 1913 and served the Central Avenue community of the City. It is now beautifully restored and has the original apparatus floor tiles, poles and kitchen out-building. In 1985 Old Fire Station 30 was declared a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument - #289 on the historic register - and is the recipient of the Los Angeles Conservancy's 1999 Preservation Award. It is opened to the public as a museum. In 2009 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places along with No. 14. Old Fire Station 30 exhibits display a wide array of firefighting gear including vintage engines (an 1890 hose wagon and a 1940 Pirsch ladder truck), uniforms from LA County and LA City firefighters, New York badges and uniforms, helmets of all kinds, displays of African American women firefighters, photographs, and other paraphernalia and firefighting artifacts. Today In 2004 the Stentorians of the City and County hosted the I.A.B.P.F.F. Convention and the traditional \\"Memorial March\\", made its way down Crenshaw Blvd., creating a truly historical moment in Los Angeles‚Äô history. That year, 2004, an unmarked grave was re-made and the status of the occupant elevated. Deceased Fireman Sam Haskins was finally given an honorable burial when a headstone is placed over his remains in Evergreen Cemetery. For years, Haskins was buried in an unmarked grave and it was not known that he was the first Black Fireman in Los Angeles until the Los Angeles Times uncovered the story. Sam Haskins was born a slave in Virginia in 1840 and was appointed as a ‚ÄòCall Man‚Äô to Engine #2, becoming the first black hired by the LAFD as a firefighter. 2009 Battalion Chief Millage Peaks, an African American and a 33-year veteran of the LAFD becomes the next Fire Chief to serve the City of Los Angeles. 2011 Daryl L.

Cummings The Stentorians hold a place amongst the civil rights fights that took place in the mid-twentieth century that continues to the present day. Resistance to men and women of color still exists in fire departments across the country and even though discrimination is no longer overt, the numbers of firefighters in the ranks do not reflect the demographics of the populations served, hence the continued needThe Flame Within: Memoir of a Firefighter - By Wayne Mutza for such fraternal organizations. As recently as 2011 lawsuits filed by fraternal organizations and joined by the Justice Department forced the City of New York to settle with the Vulcan Society of the FDNY in making minority appointments from the lists established by the Dept of Personnel in 1999, 2002 and 2007, leading to the most diversified classes in the history of that city's fire dept. Mission Statement of the LACityStentorians For almost 100 years, African- Americans have been members of the Los Angeles City Fire Department (LAFD) and have historically faced major obstacles to equal employment opportunities. While there have been some improvements over the years, discriminatory hiring and promotional practices, which represent significant barriers for minority members of the LAFD, remain. Double standards, subjective judgements and institutionalized discrimination still serve as an effective barrier against equal and fair promotional practices. A review of minority members, in middle and upper level management positions, is clear evidence of the ongoing problem of discrimination faced by our members. The LAFD has become polarized, not only within itself, but also within the high risk communities it serves. The LAFD is one of the Fire Departments who must protect itself from the very people it is supposed to serve. The Los Angeles City Council's resolution #94.0585 dated April 12, 1994, directed the Personnel Department to study the LAFD. This study was to review the entry level process and all procedures and factors relevant to promotion and advancement within the Fire Department as they relate to minorities and females. This represents an important opportunity for objective evaluation and for change. The Los Angeles City Stentorians is an African-American Firefighter's Association dedicated to the professional advancement of its members. Therefore, we have a real stake in ensuring that the Personnel Department's study objectively evaluates and highlights the LAFD's present promotional and employment practices. We are confident that an honest review of the present employment conditions in the LAFD will lead to the conclusion that a fundamental lack of equal opportunity exists and that certain safeguards, policies and procedures are needed to level the playing field. The Stentorian organization would like to see an LAFD united within itself. Where all members are treated equally, and job satisfaction is not only experienced by each member, but is also displayed to the communities in which we live and serve.

As it was the second book written in the Kajkavian dialect, he was also a founder of the Kajkavian literature. Life Vramec was born in Ormo≈æ or its vicinity (Duchy of Styria) and died in Vara≈ædin (Kingdom of Croatia). He studied theology in Vienna and in Rome. In 1567, he moved to Zagreb, where he was a canon. In 1571, he became the Archdeacon of Bexen. In 1573, he moved to Vara≈ædin, where he was also the archdeacon. The arrival of Antun Vramec to Vara≈ædin marked the emerging of the Vara≈ædin literary circle to which Vramec belonged. From 1578 until 1580, he was the parish priest in Bre≈æice, and from 1580 until 1582 the archdeacon in Dubice. In 1582, all his honors were revoked from him, because he didn't want to recant his family. Despite his freethinking stance, his connection with the Protestant movement has not been confirmed. Work The first work by Vramec was a world chronicle titled Kronika vezda znovich zpravliena Kratka Szlouenzkim iezikom, published in Ljubljana (Laibach) in 1578.

In 1997, he was convicted of a triple murder and was awarded a death sentence for the targeted murder of Shahid Hamid, a bureaucrat and managing-director of KESC (now K-Electric), along with his driver Ashraf Brohi, and his guard Khan Akbar, all of whom were killed in the neighborhood of Defence Housing Authority, Karachi on the 5 July 1997. After arrest by the CID in 1998 and upon returning from Bangkok, Mirza was awarded death sentence by the Anti-Terrorism Court on 24 May 1999. Since then, his family have filed clemency applications in two separate occasions: first in Sindh High Court in 2000 and in the Supreme Court of Pakistan in 2002; all applications were rejected by the apex court. In 2013, his family submitted another application to President of Pakistan for clemency which was also rejected. After a death warrant was issued on 11 March 2015, the execution was set to be carried out in Central Jail Mach in Balochistan on 19 March 2015. Upon hearing the execution news, his family began pleading his case, where his wife and sisters held multiple press conferences, demanding a re-investigation. After releasing a confession video to multiple private news channels, where he leveled charges of murder involvement of Altaf Hussain, Mirza's execution was ultimately halted on presidential orders and an active investigation against MQM was launched by the Pakistan government. After rejecting the second and final appeal for clemency Mirza was executed on 12 May 2015 at the supermax facility, the Central Jail Macch, Balochistan, Pakistan. Background Saulat Mirza was born as Saulat Ali Khan in Karachi and grew up in the rural Malir neighborhood in Karachi, Sindh in 1971. In his interrogation process, he confirmed his Urdu-speaking background and his Yousafzai Pathan ancestry; his parents emigrated from what is now India to Pakistan at the time of the partition of British India. His father, Wajahat Ali Khan, worked as an army civilian staff clerk in the Pakistan Army, whereas mother was a housewife. After matriculating from a local school, Mirza initially enrolled for pre- medical degree but instead ended up getting intermediate diploma in Commerce from Pakistan Shipowners College. He eventually graduated from the BCom from the business school of Karachi University. It was during this time, Mirza joined the All Pakistan Muttahidda Students Organization (APMSO), taking strong participation in student politics. The APMSO is a student wing of then known as Mohajir Qaumi Movement later changed into Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM). In his college years, Mirza was an avid fan of Pakistan cricket team and often played cricket as well as Table tennis. Mirza was described as young good looking and attractive person and a devoted worker of the MQM. Political career and targeted killings After joining the MQM and taking part in national politics, Mirza soon participated in illegal activities such as extortion and involved in acquitting in political murders. Mirza largely remained unknown and was not a known figure in the MQM until 1995 when his close friend Faheem Farooqi got arrested in 1995 and described him as his right-hand man. At one time, Mirza was a major figure in the militant wing of the MQM as per Pakistani agencies allegations, running several death cells. He was accused of coordinating the murders of six U.S. nationals in Shahrah-e- Faisal in Karachi, but he denied involvement in the killing of two US diplomats and four U.S. nationals of an American Oil Company in the city in 1994. However, the investigation later revealed Nadeem Commando, an accomplice of Mirza, was the main culprit; Nadeem was later killed in a police encounter in 1997 by Karachi Police. Since then, the FIA and the intelligence community had him under strict surveillance. Although, Mirza did admit to killing a number of people, including a Pakistani employee of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in 1995. Mirza reportedly fled the country in 1995 after Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto initiated a massive crackdown against MQM and returned home after Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's dismissal in 1996. On 5 July 1997, he shot and killed the Managing Director of Karachi Electric Supply Corporation (KESC) Shahid Hamid, his driver and guard in Karachi. He reportedly escaped to Bangkok and only returned to Karachi 2 weeks after his mother's death on 10 December 1998. A day later, on 11 December 1998, Mirza was arrested from the Jinnah Terminal in a sting operation led by CID officer Aslam Khan and was described as a \\"prize catch.\\" During his arrest, Mirza confessed that he was involved in a number of murders of innocent people, including several high-profile personalities, in the presence of DIG Sindh Police Ameen Qureshi. Mirza's wife later testified that he was in contact with Altaf Hussain just before arrest, though the MQM denied the charge. In May 1999, the Anti-Terrorist Court awarded him a death sentence for the triple- murder case of MD of Karachi Electric Supply Corporation Shahid Hamid, his driver Ashraf Brohi and guard Akbar Khan. In April 2014, he was transferred to supermax facility, the Central Jail Macch in Balochistan, and was placed in the Death Cell after his mercy plea was rejected by Sindh High Court and President of Pakistan Mamnoon Hussain. The Anti-Terrorism court issued the black warrant on 12 March against Mirza to be executed on 19 March 2015 in the early morning at Machh Jail Baluchistan. His sister filed another petition in Supreme Court seeking delay in execution but two-Judge bench turned down her appeal. A few hours before Mirza's scheduled execution a video tape was released on Electronic Media of Mirza's confession, in which he accused MQM of ordering him to perform the crime. The MQM chief Altaf Hussain denied having met with Saulat and said there was no evidence, but instead claimed a conspiracy against MQM.  Execution and burial  The execution originally scheduled for 19 March 2015 was deferred for 72 hours. An anti-terrorism court in Karachi re-issued a black warrant on 23 March 2015. On 12 May 2015 at 4:30 a.m., Saulat Mirza was hanged till death at Machh Jail in Baluchistan, Pakistan. His body was flown from Quetta to Karachi via PIA flight. Mirza's last prayers and ceremony were performed in Karachi and he was laid to rest at Muhammad Shah graveyard, North Karachi, which was attended by his close friends, family members and neighbours.

Poseidon's trident was crafted by the Cyclopes.  Myths  In Greek myth, Poseidon's trident was forged by the cyclopes according to Pseudo-Apollodorus's Bibliotheke.Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheke 1.2. , 1:11; via Perseus Project. Poseidon wields his trident on a number of occasions. Poseidon used his trident to strike a rock upon the hill of the Acropolis, producing a well of seawater, in what developed into a contest between him and Athena over possession of Attica. The well was later to be called the Erechtheis.Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheke 3.14. , 2:79 and note 2; via Perseus Project. There is further myth that Poseidon (Neptune) produced a horse by striking the earth with the trident, in order to bolster his claim,Virgil, apud , 2:79 and note 2. but there is no attestation for this among Greek writers., 2:79 and note 2. The alleged trident print on a rock and the sea well within the Erechtheion were witnessed by the geographer Pausanias while visiting Athens.Pausanias, {. In another myth, Poseidon creates a spring or springs with the strike of his trident to reward Amymone for her encounter with him. In a version of another myth Poseidon wields his trident to scare off a satyr who tries to rape Amymone after she mistakenly hits him with a hunting spear. There is also a myth where Poseidon touches the island of Delos with his trident, affixing it firmly to the sea floor. Another myth tells how Poseidon, enraged by sacrilegious behavior of Ajax the Lesser, splits with trident the rock to which Ajax was clinging. The oldest coins of Poseidonia from the 6th century BC depict trident wielded by Poseidon in his right hand, similar to Zeus's thunderbolt. An Attic red figure kylix from depicts Poseidon killing the Giant Polybotes with his trident. Symbolism According to the second and third Vatican Mythographer, Neptune's trident symbolizes the three properties of water: liquidity, fecundity and drinkability. The trident of Neptune was viewed by Roman scholar Maurus Servius Honoratus as three-pronged because \\"the sea is said to be a third part of the world, or because there are three kinds of water: seas, streams and rivers\\".  Modern scholarship  The view shared by Friedrich Wieseler, E. M. W. Tillyard and several other researchers is that Poseidon's trident is a fish spear, typical for coast- dwelling Greeks. According to Robert Graves, however, both Poseidon's trident and Zeus' thunderbolt were originally a sacred labrys, but later distinguished from each other when Poseidon became god of the sea, while Zeus claimed the right to the thunderbolt. According to competing proposal by H. B. Walters, Poseidon's trident is derived from Zeus' lotus sceptre, with Poseidon being Zeus in his marine aspect. Modern references The flag of Barbados In present times Poseidon's trident is a recurring symbol. It appears on the coat of arms of Liverpool City Council, the seal of the Greek Navy, and the badge of USS John S. McCain, as well as on the crest of the Delta Delta Delta sorority. A series of American fleet ballistic missiles Trident is named after Neptune's trident, as well as Operation Neptune Spear. The personification of Great Britain, Britannia is depicted with the trident of Poseidon as a symbol of naval power. The logo of car manufacturer Maserati is based on the trident from the statue of Neptune in Bologna. The broken tip of the trident appears on the flag of Barbados. In this instance the reference is to its use as Britannia's trident, broken to symbolise the end of Britain's colonial rule. Poseidon's Trident is a magical artifact with destructive powers in Michael Livingston's 2015 historical fantasy novel The Shards of Heaven. Jack Sparrow, aided by Henry Turner, seeks the Trident of Poseidon in the film Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017).
