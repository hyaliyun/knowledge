He played in Major League Baseball with the New York Highlanders in . Biography A native of Fitchburg, Massachusetts, Tift graduated from Brown University in 1907. While at Brown, he was a star baseball player who reportedly \\"showed great nerve in tight places and fielded his position with the greatest accuracy.\\" Tift signed with the New York Highlanders after graduation, and appeared in four games during New York's 1907 season. With the Highlanders, Tift played with Baseball Hall of Famers Jack Chesbro, Willie Keeler, and Branch Rickey. Tift's major league debut came on August 7, when he pitched six innings in relief of Slow Joe Doyle, allowing five hits and one run in New York's 8-4 loss to the St. Louis Browns at Hilltop Park. Three days later, Tift was the starter for New York in the second game of a doubleheader with the Browns, going seven innings and allowing three runs. In Tift's third appearance he again relieved Doyle, and reached base himself after being hit by a Bill Donovan pitch, but the Highlanders suffered a 13-6 shellacking at the hands of the Detroit Tigers and Hall of Famers Ty Cobb and Sam Crawford at Bennett Park. Tift's final major league appearance came at Hilltop Park on September 2, when he went five innings in relief of Al Orth as New York was stomped, 12-1, by the Boston Americans and their ace hurler, Hall of Famer Cy Young. Over four major league appearances, Tift had a 0‚Äì0 record, and posted a 4.74 ERA with six strikeouts and four walks in 19 innings. In 1914, Tift pitched for the Falmouth, Massachusetts \\"Cottage Club\\" town team in what is now the Cape Cod Baseball League. Earlier in the season, he had defeated the Cottage Club as a member of the West Somerville, Massachusetts town team. Tift continued to pitch for the Somerville town team for several seasons, and in 1919 was briefly a teammate of Hall of Famer Pie Traynor at Somerville. Tift died in Verona, New Jersey in 1945 at the age of 60.

This family was named in 2001 after the type genus Istiodactylus was discovered not to be a member of the genus Ornithodesmus. Systematics and distribution Istiodactylid skulls: A) Istiodactylus latidens (NHMUK R3877) (B) Istiodactylus sinensis (NGMC 99-07-11) and (C) Nurhachius ignaciobritoi (IVPP V-13288) Remains of taxa that can be confidently assigned to Istiodactylidae have been found in the UK and China, in rocks dating from the Early Cretaceous period (Barremian to Aptian stage). Arbour and Currie (2011) described Canadian Gwawinapterus beardi as a member of Istiodactylidae living in the late Cretaceous (upper Campanian stage); however, Witton (2012) suggested the tooth replacement pattern in this animal does not match that of pterosaurs, suggesting that the species might be non-pterosaurian. Additional research suggested that the species was in fact a fish. The earliest known species might be Archaeoistiodactylus linglongtaensis, from the Middle Jurassic of China; however, it also has been suggested that the holotype specimen of this species might actually be a poorly preserved specimen of Darwinopterus. Hongshanopterus, a supposed istiodactylid from China, has been reclassified as a non-istiodactylid member of Ornithocheiroidea of uncertain phylogenetic placement by Witton (2012). Istiodactylids were medium-sized pterosaurs with flat, rounded jaws similar to that of a duck. They had small teeth lining their jaws, however, and this can mostly be seen in the more advanced genera such as Istiodactylus. Classification Restoration of an Istiodactylus in flight Below is a cladogram showing the phylogenetic placement of this group within Pteranodontia from Andres and Myers (2013). The cladogram below is a topology recovered by Kellner et al. (2019). In the analyses, they recovered Istiodactylidae within the more inclusive group Istiodactyliformes, and assigned both Istiodactylus and Liaoxipterus to a new subfamily called Istiodactylinae, but kept Nurhachius as a basal member. Paleobiology =Lifestyle= Unlike most ornithocheiroids, istiodactylids bear physiologies suited to a terrestrial life and many of their fossils have been found in freshwater-deposits. Istiodactylids are considered to be pterosaurian equivalents to vultures: acting as the clean-up crew in their native locations. Whether or not istiodactylids could swim like most water-loving pterosaurs remains a mystery.

From the Wapsipinicon, it takes an S-curve to the north and east and enters Fairbank in Buchanan County, where it crosses the Little Wapsipinicon River. East of Fairbank, Iowa 281 takes another S-curve which places the highway on the Buchanan County / Fayette County line. Iowa 281 heads east along the county line until its end at Iowa Highway 150 south of Oelwein. History Originally, Iowa Highway 281 was a spur route from U.S. Route 20 to Dunkerton. In 1957, when US 20 was rerouted to the south, Iowa 281 was extended along the former alignment of US 20 to US 63 in Waterloo. In 1980, it was extended along County Road V3C in Black Hawk and Buchanan Counties and took over the routing of Iowa Highway 190, which was a spur route connecting Fairbank to Iowa Highway 150 south of Oelwein. On the 1986 Iowa DOT map, Iowa 281 was routed south of D20 along V51 to the new US-20 freeway, but by 1986, Iowa 281 was again routed west of V51 along D20 to the eastern city limit of Waterloo.

Characteristic symptoms are increased muscle tone (dystonia, such as clubfoot) and Parkinsonian features, typically absent in the morning or after rest but worsening during the day and with exertion. Children with dopamine-responsive dystonia are often misdiagnosed as having cerebral palsy. The disorder responds well to treatment with levodopa. Signs and symptoms The disease typically starts in one limb, typically one leg. Progressive dystonia results in clubfoot and tiptoe walking. The symptoms can spread to all four limbs around age 18, after which progression slows and eventually symptoms reach a plateau. There can be regression in developmental milestones (both motor and mental skills) and failure to thrive in the absence of treatment. In addition, dopamine-responsive dystonia is typically characterized by signs of parkinsonism that may be relatively subtle. Such signs may include slowness of movement (bradykinesia), tremors, stiffness and resistance to movement (rigidity), balance difficulties, and postural instability. Approximately 25 percent also have abnormally exaggerated reflex responses (hyperreflexia), particularly in the legs. These symptoms can result in a presentation that is similar in appearance to that of Parkinson's disease. Many patients experience improvement with sleep, are relatively free of symptoms in the morning, and develop increasingly severe symptoms as the day progresses (i.e., diurnal fluctuation). Accordingly, this disorder has sometimes been referred to as \\"progressive hereditary dystonia with diurnal fluctuations.\\" Yet some people with dopamine-responsive dystonia do not experience such diurnal fluctuations, causing many researchers to prefer other disease terms. ;Other symptoms - footwear * excessive wear at toes, but little wear on heels, thus replacement of shoes every college term/semester. ;Other symptoms - handwriting * near normal handwriting at infants/kindergarten (ages 3‚Äì5 school) years. * poor handwriting at pre-teens (ages 8‚Äì11 school) years. * very poor (worse) handwriting during teen (qv GCSE/A level-public exams) years. * bad handwriting (worsening) during post-teen (qv university exams) years. * very bad handwriting (still worsening) during adult (qv post-graduate exams) years. * worsening pattern of sloppy handwriting best observed by school teachers via termly reports. * child sufferer displays unhappy childhood facial expressions (possibly depression). Genetics Autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms of the disease have been reported. Mutations in several genes have been shown to cause dopamine-responsive dystonia. The precursor of the neurotransmitter dopamine, L-dopa, is synthesised from tyrosine by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase and utilises tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) as a cofactor. A mutation in the gene GCH1, which encodes the enzyme GTP cyclohydrolase I, disrupts the production of BH4, decreasing dopamine levels (hypodopaminergia). This results in autosomal-dominant dopamine-responsive dystonia . Mutations in the genes for tyrosine hydroxylase and sepiapterin reductase result in autosomal-recessive forms of the disease. When the latter enzyme is affected, the condition tends to be more severe. The activity of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway normally peaks during the morning and also decreases with age until after age 20, which explains why the symptoms worsen during the course of the day and with increasing age until the third decade of life.  Diagnosis  Due to the condition's rarity, it is frequently misdiagnosed, often as cerebral palsy. This results in patients often living their entire childhood with the condition untreated. The diagnosis of dopamine-responsive dystonia can be made from a typical history, a trial of dopamine medications, and genetic testing. Not all patients show mutations in the GCH1 gene (GTP cyclohydrolase I), which makes genetic testing imperfect. Sometimes a lumbar puncture is performed to measure concentrations of biopterin and neopterin, which can help determine the exact form of dopamine-responsive movement disorder: early onset parkinsonism (reduced biopterin and normal neopterin), GTP cyclohydrolase I deficiency (both decreased) and tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency (both normal). In approximately half of cases, a phenylalanine loading test can be used to show decreased conversion from the amino acid phenylalanine to tyrosine. This process uses BH4 as a cofactor. During a sleep study (polysomnography), decreased twitching may be noticed during REM sleep. An MRI scan of the brain can be used to look for conditions that can mimic dopamine-responsive dystonia (for example, metal deposition in the basal ganglia can indicate Wilson's disease or pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration). Nuclear imaging of the brain using positron emission tomography (PET scan) shows a normal radiolabelled dopamine uptake in dopamine-responsive dystonia, contrary to the decreased uptake in Parkinson's disease. Other differential diagnoses include metabolic disorders (such as GM2 gangliosidosis, phenylketonuria, hypothyroidism, Leigh disease) primarily dystonic juvenile parkinsonism, autosomal recessive early onset parkinsonism with diurnal fluctuation, early onset idiopathic parkinsonism, focal dystonias, dystonia musculorum deformans and dyspeptic dystonia with hiatal hernia. ;Diagnosis - main * typically referral by GP to specialist Neurological Hospital e.g. National Hospital in London. * very hard to diagnose as condition is dynamic w.r.t. time-of-day AND dynamic w.r.t. age of patient. * correct diagnosis only made by a consultant neurologist with a complete 24-hour day-cycle observation (with video/film) at a hospital, i.e., morning (day1)->noon->afternoon->evening->late-night->sleep->morning (day2). * patient with suspected dopamine-responsive dystonia required to walk in around hospital in front of Neuro'-consultant at selected daytime intervals to observe worsening walking pattern coincident with increased muscle tension in limbs. * throughout the day, reducing leg-gait, thus shoe heels catching one another. * diurnal affect of condition: morning (fresh/energetic), lunch (stiff limbs), afternoon (very stiff limbs), evening (limbs worsening), bedtime (limbs near frozen). * muscle tension in thighs/arms: morning (normal), lunch (abnormal), afternoon (very abnormal), evening (bad), bedtime (frozen solid). ;Diagnosis - additional * lack of self-esteem at school/college/university -> eating disorders in youth thus weight gains. * lack of energy during late-daytime (teens/adult) -> compensate by over-eating.  Treatment  In those with dopamine-responsive dystonia, symptoms typically dramatically improve with low-dose administration of levodopa, which is a biochemically significant metabolite of the amino acid phenylalanine, as well as a biological precursor of the catecholamine dopamine, a neurotransmitter. (Neurotransmitters are naturally produced molecules that may be sequestered following the propagation of an action potential down a nerve towards the axon terminal, which in turn may cross the synaptic junction between neurons, enabling neurons to communicate in a variety of ways.) Low-dose L-dopa usually results in near-complete or total reversal of all associated symptoms for these patients. In addition, the effectiveness of such therapy is typically long term, without the complications that often occur for those with Parkinson's disease who undergo L-dopa treatment. Thus, most experts indicate that this disorder is most appropriately known as dopa-responsive dystonia. No data are available on mortality associated with dopamine-responsive dystonia, but patients surviving beyond the fifth decade with treatment have been reported. However, in severe, early autosomal recessive forms of the disease, patients have been known to pass away during childhood. Girls seem to be somewhat more commonly affected. The disease less commonly begins during puberty or after age 20, and very rarely, cases in older adults have been reported. Due to commonly being misdiagnosed, it is common for the disease to remain untreated. When left untreated, patients often need Achilles' tendon surgery by the age of 21. They will also struggle with walking, an ability that will degrade throughout the day. Power napping can provide temporary relief in untreated patients. It also impairs development into adulthood, reduces balance, and reduces calf muscle development. Socially, it can result in depression, lack of social skills, and inability to find employment.  Epidemiology  This condition is very rare, only affecting one in two million people. It is more common in females than in males. There are several hundred cases in the United States, 25 known cases in the United Kingdom, and less than that in Australia and New Zealand.  Research  Response to treatment is variable and the long-term and functional outcome is unknown. To provide a basis for improving the understanding of the epidemiology, genotype/phenotype correlation and outcome of these diseases their impact on the quality of life of patients, and for evaluating diagnostic and therapeutic strategies a patient registry was established by the noncommercial International Working Group on Neurotransmitter Related Disorders. History The disease is named after Dr. Masaya Segawa, who provided an early clinical description.

He is also professor of psychology, education, and biomedical engineering and serves on the Executive Committee of the Cognitive Science Center at Rutgers. He is also founding director of the Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School Autism Center. He received his PhD in 1962 from the University of Pennsylvania in both clinical and experimental psychology. Research His research has focused on typical and atypical emotional and intellectual development. By focusing on the normal course of development, he has been able to articulate the sequence of developmental capacities of the child in regard to its intellectual growth and relate this to changes in the organization of its central nervous system functioning. His discoveries of techniques to measure CNS functioning, through the use of the habituation- dishabituation paradigm, are widely used throughout the country and have become the standard measurement system used to predict atypical growth as well as typical development. Using these measurement instruments, he has been able to develop computer-based techniques for enhancing intellectual ability in children suffering from a variety of disorders associated with developmental delays. These include children with Down syndrome, preterm infants, and children with cerebral palsy. Honors Among his honors, Lewis is a fellow of the New York Academy of Sciences,American Psychological Association, and American Association of the Advancement of Science, as well as the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science. In 1995 he was ranked by a University of Notre Dame Study as number 1 in terms of the impact of scientists who are most referenced and productive in the field of developmental sciences, in the top 1.5% of scientists referenced in the Social Science Index. In addition, Dr. Lewis received the 2009 Urie Bronfenbrenner Award for Lifetime Contribution to Developmental Psychology in the Service of Science and Society from the American Psychological Association, as well as the 2012 Hedi Levenback Pioneer Award from The New York Zero-to-Three for his pioneering research in child development.

The Royal Navy captured her in 1798 off Malta and took into service as HMS Sensible. She was lost in a grounding off Ceylon in 1802. French Navy service From November 1789, she served at Martinique under captaine de vaisseau Durand de Braye (or Durand d'Ubraye).Fonds, Vol. 1, p.24. In September 1790, she ferried Jos√©phine de Beauharnais and her daughter Hortense from Martinique to Toulon. In 1792, she took part in operations against Sardinia. In 1793, she was equipped as a bomb ship. On 9 December 1795, Sensible was part of Gantaume's squadron. Sensible, along with the corvettes Sardine and Rossignol, captured the 28-gun in the neutral port of Smyrna. The French warships entered the harbour in disregard of its neutrality and forced Nemesis to surrender. Murray Maxwell (then a midshipman) was taken prisoner on this occasion. Under lieutenant de vaisseau (later capitaine de fr√©gate) Escoffier, in March‚ÄìApril 1795 Sensible crossed the Aegean Sea, stopping at Tunis and Valletta on her way to Toulon.Fonds, Vol. 1, p.173. The next year she came under the command of capitaine de fr√©gate Guillaume-Fran√ßois-Joseph Bourd√©.Quintin, p.79. He sailed Sensible from Toulon to Trieste via Corfu. She then cruised the Adriatic before returning to Corfu.Fonds, Vol. 1, p.190. Sensible was subsequently armed en fl√ªte and used as a transport in the Mediterranean. In an action on 27 June 1798, the 38-gun HMS Seahorse captured her. Sensible lost 25 men killed and 55 wounded. Seahorse had two men killed and 16 men wounded; the British report is that Sensible lost 18 men killed and 35 wounded, including Bourd√©. Captain Edward James Foote of Seahorse further reported that Sensible had recently received copper sheathing and fastening, and a thorough repair at Toulon two months previously. At the time of her capture Sensible was carrying General of Division Baraguey D'Hilliers, with his entourage. They were going to Toulon with a report on the capture of Malta. The British took her into service as HMS Sensible. The French Navy suspended Captain Bourd√© on 31 July on suspicion of not having resisted adequately, and court-martialed him on 20 May 1799 for the loss of his ship. Acquitted, he was reinstated on 21 August. Royal Navy service Capture of La Sensible on 27 June 1798 by the frigate Sea Horse Sensible was placed under Commander John Baker Hay, who received his promotion to post captain in September. She was named and registered on 13 October. She arrived at Portsmouth on 25 November. There she was fitted as a troopship between June and August 1799.Winfield (2008), p.206-7. She was commissioned in July under Captain Robert Sauce. Sensible shared with and in the proceeds of the recapture, on 11 July 1800, of the Piersons. On 14 May 1801, Sensible landed troops in Abu Qir Bay. Because Sensible served in the navy's Egyptian campaign (8 March to 2 September 1801), her officers and crew qualified for the clasp \\"Egypt\\" to the Naval General Service Medal that the Admiralty issued in 1847 to all surviving claimants. Loss On 2 March 1802, as she sailed off Ceylon, she grounded, having been unable to turn quickly enough once breakers were sighted. She had to be abandoned as a wreck after 16 hours of efforts to lighten her. She had run into a shoal off Mullaitivu due to negligent navigation. (Earlier had warned Sauce that his reckoning was off by 40 miles.) The subsequent court martial severely reprimanded Sauce and moved his name to the bottom of the list of commanders. The court martial also dismissed the service the master, James O'Conner.Hepper (1994), pp.100-1.

The penalty flag (or just \\"flag\\") is a yellow cloth used in several field sports including American football and lacrosse by game officials to identify and sometimes mark the location of penalties or infractions that occur during regular play. It is usually wrapped around a weight, such as sand or beans so it can be thrown accurately over greater distances and cannot easily be blown away. Many officials previously weighted flags with ball bearings, but the practice was largely discontinued after a flag thrown by NFL referee Jeff Triplette struck Cleveland Browns offensive tackle Orlando Brown Sr. in the eye during a 1999 game, causing a serious injury to Brown. Brown was forced to sit out three seasons because of the eye injury and settled with the NFL for a reported amount of $25 million. The flag is colored orange in Canadian football. NFL penalty flags were colored white until 1965, when the color was changed to yellow. Penalty flags in college football were red until the 1970s, before also being changed to yellow. To mark field position after a change in possession, such as after an interception or punt, a small bean bag is used to mark where the change of possession took place. These bean bags are typically black, blue, or white; other colors such as orange have occasionally been used. The idea for the penalty flag came from Youngstown State coach Dwight BeedeNATIONAL FOOTBALL FOUNDATION / COLLEGE HALL OF FAME \\"Hawk's Huddle\\" and first used in a game against Oklahoma City University on October 17, 1941. Prior to the use of flags, officials used horns and whistles to signal a penalty. Official adoption of the use of the flag occurred at the 1948 American Football Coaches rules session. The National Football League first used flags on September 17, 1948 when the Green Bay Packers played the Boston Yanks.Golden Rankings \\"Interesting football stories\\" In October 2013, the NFL planned to use pink penalty flags throughout the month as part of the league's breast cancer awareness initiative. This was changed after two weeks, due to confusion with other pink apparel on players and game officials. In some football leagues, coaches are given a challenge flag of similar construction as a penalty flag. The flag is red in American football and yellow in Canadian football, so it contrasts with the officials' penalty flags. This is thrown by a coach when he wishes to contest (challenge) a referee's decision.

Celebrity Sports Center (CSC or Celebrity's) was a family- oriented entertainment business and landmark in metropolitan Denver. Celebrity's was located in Glendale, Colorado at 888 South Colorado Boulevard near East Kentucky Avenue. It opened in 1960 and operated continuously for 34 years before closing in 1994. The original investors included Walt Disney, his brother Roy, Jack Benny, Bing Crosby, George Burns, Charles Laughton, Burl Ives, Art Linkletter, John Payne, Spike Jones and Jim and Marion Jordan (Fibber McGee and Molly). There are some sources that suggest Walt Disney Company used the business as a training facility for its employees prior to deployment to Disney World.Walt Disney World Trivia Walt Disney and the original investors built the Celebrity's complex at a cost of $6 million. The bowling lanes opened first in 1960 and the rest of the center opened in 1961. In 1979, a group of private investors led by Bob Leavitt and Neil Griffin purchased Celebrity's for $1.9 million. The three signature water slides that were visible from outside of the building were added after Leavitt/Griffin purchase. In the early 1990s, Celebrity's was losing money and apparently in need of significant maintenance. In 1994, the complex was sold to Acquisition Corporation of the Rockies for $10.8 million, a subsidiary of Trammell Crow Company. The new owner demolished Celebrity's by March 1995. Today the site is a Home Depot store and retail space. Features Celebrity's was home to 80 bowling lanes, more than 300 video games and pinball machines spread across three arcades, a 50-meter pool with three water slides, a billiard room, a full-service restaurant, the \\"Hofbr√§u\\" bar, bumper-car rides and a shooting gallery which were located in the \\"Fun Center\\" game room downstairs, the largest of the 3 arcade rooms, where there were ticketed games such as Skee ball or Boom ball to play for prizes . There were also 3 complete slot car tracks in the basement. Bowling A bowling T-shirt from 1983. In the spring of 1991, the Celebrity Sports Center played host to the $125,000 Celebrity Denver Open for the Professional Bowlers Association Tour from May 21 to May 25. The final round of the tournament was televised live on ESPN. Left-hander John Mazza would go into the TV Finals with a 299 pin lead over the 2nd place qualifier Parker Bohn III. Curtis Odom qualified 3rd, Bryan Goebel 4th, and Mike Shady would take the 5th and final seed. The opening match saw Mike Shady squeak out a narrow victory over 4th seed Bryan Goebel with a score of 184-173. He followed up that victory with a 212-199 win over Curtis Odom, but he would fall to Parker Bohn III in the 3rd match of the show 226-204. In the championship match, Parker Bohn III was simply unable to find a consistent line to the pocket to score. As a result, he was defeated easily by the number 1 seed John Mazza, who threw 10 out of 12 possible strikes in a lopsided 269-190 victory to win the first place prize of $18,000.

Patrons often remember the iconic sign that stood outside Celebrity's. At least one of the 14-point stars from the sign has been preserved. Today it is used as a winter holiday decoration at the Lumber Baron Inn & Gardens in Denver. Additionally, the old bowling lanes at Celebrity's were preserved. Those lanes were reused during the restoration of the 19th-century Oxford Hotel in downtown Denver and now serve as the hotel's ballroom floor.

The work was first performed at a benefit concert in Pavlovsk on September 5, 1858, as part of a tour of Russia that Strauss was conducting. In keeping with the vogue then current in Russia for the French language, the work was entitled as Mes adieux √† St. P√©tersbourg (My Farewell to St. Petersburg). Less than a week after his return to his home city of Vienna, Strauss conducted the first Viennese performance of the work at the Vienna Volksgarten. A critic for the Wiener Allgemeine Theaterzeitung commented on Strauss' waltz: \\"The waltz Abschied von St. Petersburg distinguishes itself among the newly performed compositions by its alluring themes and interesting instrumentation; the composition has a predominantly serious Slavic character [...] Strauss was accorded extraordinary amounts of applause and had to repeat each new composition two or three times.\\" However, despite the public and critical acclaim for the composition, Abschied von St. Petersburg did not remain long in the Strauss Orchestra's repertoire, and it is not very well known nowadays. In keeping with the work's title, the waltz has a rather mournful quality about it: the composition begins with a passage for solo cello, which soon gives way to the melancholic opening waltz theme, a mood that is enhanced by the use of counter-melodies in the cello line. The composition does not end with a drumroll or flourish, as most of Strauss' other waltzes do, but instead fades away into the distance with a trumpet call, probably meant to symbolise the composer's carriage as it drives him away from Pavlovsk and St. Petersburg. Abschied von St. Petersburg rendered its name to a 1971 Soviet film by Yan Frid (, Farewell to St. Petersburg) about the composer's affair with Olga Smirnitskaya in the summer of 1857.

She served in the Mediterranean during the Ancien R√©gime. In 1792 she was under the command of Lieutenant de vaiseau the chevalier de Bellon de Sainte-Marguerite and served as an escort in the Levant. She was at Smyrna in March, and then cruised the Aegean Sea. Next, she escorted a convoy from Smyrna to Cape Matapan, and then protected French trade between Tripoli (Syria) and Alexandria. Lastly, she escorted a convoy from Cyprus to Marseilles in October.Fonds, Vol.1, p.33. In August 1793 an Anglo- Spanish force captured Toulon and Royalist forces turned over to them the French naval vessels in the port. When the Anglo-Spanish force had to leave in December, they took with them the best vessels and tried to burn the remainder. Although some reports have the Anglo-Spanish forces capturing her and then leaving her behind, she does not appear on an English list of vessels captured, burnt, or otherwise disposed of. On 9 December 1795, Sardine was part of Gantaume's squadron. She, the frigate Sensible, and the corvette Rossignol captured the 28-gun , which had grounded and after refloating had anchored out of range of the fort in the neutral port of Smyrna. The French warships entered the harbour in disregard of its neutrality and called on Nemesis to surrender, which she did when the French refused to honour the port's neutrality and fired on Nemesis. Three men from Nemesis, a sailor and two Royal Marines, defected to the French and joined Sardine. Capture On 9 March 1796, Nemesis was anchored in the neutral harbour of Tunis, together with Postillon, and Sardine, under the command of Enseigne de vaisseau non entretenu Icard (acting).Fonds, Vol. 1, p.173. The British sent a squadron under the command of Vice-Admiral William Waldegrave to recapture Nemesis. Boats from , , and ] attacked the French ships and captured all three.HMS Egmont, Naval Database The squadron also included , , and the cutter . The British took the three men who had defected from Nemesis to Sardine and hanged them. Admiral Jervis sent Nemesis, Sardine, and Postillon to Ajaccio. (Lloyd's List reported that Barfleur escorted Nemesis and Sardine to San Fiorenzo.Lloyd's List, no. 2815, ‚Äì accessed 21 April 2014. Jervis had Postillon repaired and painted before selling her to Sir Gilbert Elliot the British viceroy of the Anglo-Corsican Kingdom, for onward transfer to the Dey of the Regency of Algiers. Nemesis returned to British service and Sardine was brought into the Royal Navy. British service Sardine was brought into British service as the sloop-of-war HMS Sardine and commissioned under Commander W. Wilkinson. By July Jervis had appointed Commander Edward Killwick, of to command her. In July 1796, Admiral Lord Nelson took Sardine with him to blockade Leghorn but remarked: > The Sardine cannot move in light airs, she is so very foul; and to say the > truth, she has not the men to manage her, although I am sure that Captain > Killwick does all in his power.Nelson (1845), Vol. 2, p.2122. On 15 September 1796 Sardine captured the Spanish brig St. Juan Baptise. On 20 September Sardine attempted to enter the port at Genoa but was driven away by gunfire. Sardine was part of a squadron under Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood, in , and also containing the cutter , at Bastia before the British evacuated it in October. In early 1797 and Sardine escorted a convoy of 13 merchantmen from Elba to Gibraltar. In March Commander A. Kempe took command of Sardine. Then Commander Edward Killwick replaced Kempe in May. Sardine was formally named and registered on 27 June 1798. In May 1798 Killwick was appointed to command the Southwark Sea Fencibles.Marshall (1832), Vol. 3, Part 3, p.258. Sardine then essentially disappears from view. As Nelson had already remarked that she was foul, it is highly likely that Killwick had sailed her to Britain where she was paid off, registered, and ignored. Fate From 1805, she was at Portsmouth in ordinary. She was offered for sale in September 1806, and was sold later that year and broken up.

The temple is now owned by the City of Oroville and open to the public as a museum, and it also continues to be used occasionally for worship.  History  In the latter half of the 19th century there were as many as 10,000 Chinese in the Oroville, California area. Just as with many of those that arrived in the area, they came primarily in search of gold. Starting with the California Gold Rush ca. 1849, the Chinese arrivals in Oroville for the first 20 years were only men since they were not allowed to bring their families. Most of these were from the Canton and Shanghai provinces. They brought little with them except their rich heritage, the will to succeed and the desire to return home wealthy. Shortly after arriving in Oroville around 1850, the Chinese population pooled existing resources and built the first Chinese temple in the area. This temple, constructed of wood, burned down as did a second rebuilt structure. The third structure and furnishings, funded by the Tongzhi Emperor and Empress of China, was built of red brick acquired from Palermo, California and was completed in September 1863. This is the same structure that exists on the site today. Temple Banner Over the years the structure withstood many fires and floods. However, in 1907 a massive flood caused damage affecting not only the temple but the entire Oroville area. This disaster combined with a concurrent economic depression in the United States resulted in a large exodus of Chinese from the area to other larger U.S. cities and back to China. Remaining Chinese continued to maintain the Chinese Temple complex (especially the Chan family) until the 1930s. During the 1930s a decision was made among these families to deed the complex to the City of Oroville and in 1937 the city officially took ownership of the complex. Three stipulations were guaranteed to the Chinese families for their contribution. The first was an agreement that the city would build a museum to house artifacts that the former complex did not have room to display. The second was to ensure that all three temples would remain available to the community to use for worship. The third and final was to teach volunteers and the at the center about the Chinese culture, beliefs and artifacts so that visitors could better understand these in context with their visit to the center. After construction of the promised structure was completed, the center reopened to visitors in July 1949. The temple was originally composed of three parts: the Chan Room for Confucian meditation, the Moon Temple, for Buddhist rites, and the Council Room, for community functions. Afterwards a number of modern additions have been made, including a Chinese tapestry hall, a display hall and a Chinese garden.  Original temple and rooms  =Main temple= The oldest of the brick temples was completed in 1863 and is named Liet Sheng Kong which translated means \\"Temple of Many Gods and Goddesses\\". In this temple visitors were allowed to worship any god they chose. The interior ceiling and walls of this building are covered with hanging boards with carvings or script asking and thanking the Chinese gods for answering prayers. The room houses three altars. Main Temple InteriorOne teak altar at the front of the temple, brought to the temple from China, shows an elaborately carved courtyard scene, The second altar is used for supporting incense burners and the third (also from China) sits at the back wall of the temple. This altar support three carved, wooden statues representing Chinese gods. On the top sides of this altar there are 2 papier-m√¢ch√© Buddha lion heads employed by the Chinese to ward away evil spirits. These heads were also employed during Chinese festival parades in the area. Lions Head in Main Temple Religious Staff - Brass - in Main Temple Just inside of the temple there is a gong and just outside the temple's entry point there is a very large ceremonial urn which also originated from China. =Chan Room= Built in 1864, the Chan Room (adjacent to the Main Temple) is also referred to as \\"Suey Cing Bak\\". The room was constructed in remembrance of general Chan Low Kwan (Soong Dynasty) who was also referred to as the \\"Viscount of Purification\\". As a note of reference, all by the name of Chan or Chin (Wong Tun district, Toy Sun county of Kwangtung province) were direct descendants of Chan Low Kwan. There are many artifacts in this room but one that is most noteworthy is a large, teak bridal sedan chair of Chinese Imperial Palace quality. Equipped with curtains, the chair was used in parades and wedding ceremonies. =Council Room= Built in 1868, the Council Room houses a beautiful hanging screen of carved wood with gold leaf overlay. Also in the room are two procession shrines which were carried in parades during Chinese festivals. The room was used primarily for business transactions. Since there were few literate Chinese in Oroville in the latter 19th century, It is surmised that the few learned Chinese men in Oroville at the time assisted others in recording their transactions. =Moon Room= Built in 1868 on the floor above the Council Room is the Moon Room or \\"Wong Fut Tong\\". The Moon Room gets its name from the unique circular door. This room is devoted to Buddha and houses three statues, one of which is reaching out his hand to display the \\"sign of wisdom\\". The main color motif is red, symbolic color of good look in the Buddhist tradition. Later additions =Tapestry Hall= Built and dedicated in 1968, the Tapestry Hall houses elaborate Chinese tapestries, parade umbrellas, a 16th-century imperial pillar rug, a beautiful bronze urn and a vast collection of Chinese artifacts. Noteworthy also are a unique collection of antique shadow puppets constructed of donkey skin. These puppets were used in dramas that helped educate Chinese regarding their own culture and were especially important to educate Chinese that were unable to read or write the Chinese language. =Display Hall= This Display Hall, also dedicated in 1968, was built to present artifacts that were given to the Chinese Temple. Artifacts housed here include Chinese costumes, furniture, and other items depicting the daily life of the Chinese. Chinese Frock Also housed in the room are tapestries and decorative items. One specific item of interest is a pair of shoes that were formerly worn by a woman with bound feet. This room also has a collection of large paper mache puppets which were used by the Chinese in their theater when actors where unavailable to perform. These puppets were originally brought to the Oroville by puppeteers who emigrated from China but were left behind when many returned to their home country. Paper Mache Puppets Used for Education and Entertainment =Cullie Room= This room was added to the complex as an American Bicentennial project in 1976. Funds for the project were donated by local philanthropist Charlotte Cullie. Clothing and artifacts housed in the room were donated by two Chinese missionaries (Mabel Clay and Jessie Mae Henke). Fashion Comparisons for period - Chinese and United States Specifically noteworthy to the collections are mannequins depicting both Chinese and United States historical clothing fashions from 1840 to 1940. This collection was donated to the city of Oroville in 1976. =Garden= The courtyard garden was established in 1968 and is populated with flora which are native to China except for a small number of annuals used to add additional color to the garden. The garden also includes a pond populated with lily pads and koi fish. Temple Garden Pond in Chinese Garden with Lily Pads and Koi FishThe Chinese garden, which has evolved over three thousand years, is historically used as a tranquil place for prayer, meditation and quiet conversation. Native Chinese Pine =Workers Hut= In 1976 a historical replica of a Chinese gold miner's hut was built out of barn wood dating back to the 1860s. It originally appeared as a Butte County contribution to the California State Fair and was later donated to be an exhibit on the Orville Oriental Temple grounds. Replica of Chinese Miners Shack - c1860 =Fong Lee Room= The newest room at the Oroville Oriental Temple was funded by the Chin (Chan) Shew Ting family trust as a means of honoring Chin Kong Yu who was one of the first Chinese shopkeepers in the Oroville area. Dedicated on April 16, 2008, this room houses a Chinese apothecary cabinet originally used to hold herbal remedies. Also housed in the room are period gold scales and items used in gold transactions. The room represents a replica of their shop and is furnished with light fixtures, cabinets, cases and other items that were in the original shop of Chin Kong Yu during the late 19th century.

GFLUKE was founded on March 1, 1938. In the year of its foundation, GFLUKE was the largest trade union organisation in Egypt. At the time of its foundation, GFLUKE consisted of 32 trade unions from the Cairo area,. The core behind the founding of GFLUKE consisted of the Commission to Organise the Workers Movement and the group around Abbas Halim. Many of the founding members of GFLUKE had been active in the National Federations of Trade Unions in Egypt (1930‚Äì1935).

Cairo: The American University in Cairo Press, 1998. pp. 233-234 Soon after the foundation of GFLUKE, the federation was divided into two camps. The core issue of contention was the role of non-workers in the labour movement. Halim promoted the engineer Ahmad ad-Damardash as-Shanadi as new GFLUKE president, a candidacy that al-Mudarrik opposed. In the end as-Shanadi became GFLUKE president, and Halim became the zaim (leader) of GFLUKE. In 1939, GFLUKE raised the demand for the adoption of a legislation on the right to form trade unions. A group of trade union officials, led by al-Mudarrik, went on an indefinite hunger strike on June 12. The hunger strike, whilst failing to convince the government to adopt such a legislation, became highly publicised.Beinin, Joel, and Zachary Lockman.

GFLUKE launched protests against the layoffs, demanding government action. The country being under martial law, the government responded by curtailing the abilities of GFLUKE to function. In the end, the federation headquarters were closed down by police. The organisation ceased to function effectively, and by 1941 it was dissolved.Beinin, Joel, and Zachary Lockman.

The project is centered on the lyrically intensive songs of Matthew Milia, and was formed by Milia and banjo player David Winston Jones while growing up in Metro Detroit. In 2008, the band released its debut full-length record, The Orion Songbook. Though formed in a folk tradition, Frontier Ruckus has shown an eclecticism across their catalog, incorporating aspects of baroque and jangle pop, alt-country, bluegrass, and lo-fi. Biography Milia and Jones formed the band while both attending Brother Rice High School in Metro Detroit. They began by playing a mixture of Milia's early compositions and traditional bluegrass songs that Jones had collected. Around this time they also recruited Eli Eisman as a bassist. While Milia attended Michigan State University‚Äîwhere he studied poetry under Diane Wakoski‚Äîand Jones attended the University of Michigan, Frontier Ruckus expanded into a six-piece. The new formation included Zachary Nichols playing trumpet, musical saw, and melodica; Ryan Etzcorn playing drums; and Anna Burch singing harmony vocals‚Äîall of whom Milia met while in East Lansing. Frontier Ruckus performing at Lollapalooza in 2013 In the beginning of 2007, shortly after the release of I Am The Water You Are Pumping, Frontier Ruckus began to receive attention in Michigan, with Metro Times considering the band \\"already one of the very best sounds to come out of Michigan this entire decade,\\" and Real Detroit Weekly stating: \\"This is the best band you haven't heard and Milia is the most impressive wordsmith I've listened to in a really long time. I'm not sure If I can recall a voice as untreated and honest as Milia's ... ever. His is a voice whose timbre carries as much meaning as the words that come through it.\\" Frontier Ruckus was named \\"Best Folk Group\\" in Detroit by Real Detroit Weekly, who were also among the first to laud The Orion Songbook prior to the album's official release, during an eMusic advance feature. Released on November 6, 2008 through Quite Scientific Records, The Orion Songbook received positive reviews, garnering attention from Blurt Magazine, Crawdaddy!, and Under the Radar, who gave the album an 8/10. Hear/Say called it \\"the year's best alt-country album.\\" In 2009, Way Upstate and the Crippled Summer, pt. 1, a six-song EP, was released as the fourth side of the double-vinyl edition of The Orion Songbook. Frontier Ruckus toured the entire US and to Europe for the first time, playing Slottsfjell Festival in Norway, among shows in the UK, Germany, and Holland. In 2010 the band toured extensively, including a month-long European tour and a performance at Bonnaroo Music Festival, for which Rolling Stone listed the band as one of their Essential Sets, calling the band \\"the perfect recipe for Gothic Americana.\\" Paste Magazine featured Frontier Ruckus in their \\"Best of What's Next\\" issue. It was announced that Deadmalls and Nightfalls, their second full-length album, would be released July 20 via Ramseur Records. Versions of several new songs were released through a Daytrotter session on February 14, 2010. Deadmalls and Nightfalls received positive critical reviews‚Äîgiven 9 out of 10 stars by PopMatters, who called the record \\"a musical map to the psyches of its performers\\" that \\"not only outdoes it predecessor, it reaches a level of top-notch songwriting most groups never attain on a greatest hits compilation.\\" A music video was shot for the song \\"Nerves of the Nightmind\\" which featured members of the band in downtown Los Angeles. Deadmalls and Nightfalls served to broaden public appreciation for the group's songcraft and instrumentation, as it also left an impression with songwriters of note. Upon hearing the album, musician Ryan Adams posted on his Twitter page: \\"Loving the new Frontier Ruckus! Great band ... this is what I want to get back to. Those tunes go forever ....\\" Frontier Ruckus returned to Europe in May 2011 for the third time, expanding to new countries such as Ireland, Sweden, and Italy. Their performance at the 2011 Kilkenny Rhythm and Roots festival was described as \\"a particular highlight\\" by The Irish Times. Zachary Nichols playing the musical saw on tour with Frontier Ruckus in Stockholm, Sweden in 2011 The band taped a performance for the NPR radio program Mountain Stage in August 2011 alongside John Oates of Hall and Oates, performing with him for the encore number. Adult Swim used Frontier Ruckus' song \\"Dark Autumn Hour\\" for four ads in their well-known series of bumps, first airing in September 2011. Around this time, Deadmalls and Nightfalls was released in a deluxe double-vinyl package including the bonus EP Way Upstate and the Crippled Summer, pt. 2. In March 2012, the band streamed the recording of their third Daytrotter session live. A music film shot on Super 8 mm film for the song \\"Mona and Emmy\\" was premiered by Paste Magazine who also announced the first official details on the band's upcoming third full-length record Eternity of Dimming‚Äîslated to be a double album of 20 songs and 5,500 words. In May 2012, footage of Jones and Nichols performing a medley of theme songs from The Legend of Zelda‚Äîon banjo and musical saw, melodica, and Casio keyboard respectively‚Äîwas circulated by Geekologie and the Kotaku site of Gawker Media. Eternity of Dimming was released on January 29, 2013 to strong critical response. Jim Farber of the New York Daily News commended the double album's dense specificity and ability to \\"obsess on the most suburban images possible.\\" The band released Eternity of Dimming at the 36th Ann Arbor Folk Festival at Hill Auditorium, sharing the stage with Colin Hay and Rodriguez. 2013 saw Frontier Ruckus perform at Lollapalooza and return to Europe twice, as Eternity was their first record to receive distribution from a European label, Loose Music. The band appeared at End of the Road Festival in the UK, where the record received positive reviews from Uncut magazine‚Äîwho stated the band was at \\"their blinding best.\\" Singles for the record, \\"Careening Catalog Immemorial\\" and \\"Dealerships\\", were both accompanied by music videos and premiered by IFC and Rolling Stone, respectively. For The A.V. Club's \\"Undercover\\" series, Frontier Ruckus recorded a cover of Third Eye Blind's 1990s alternative rock hit \\"Semi-Charmed Life\\" at The Onion's Chicago office. On November 11, 2014 (November 10, 2014 in Europe), Frontier Ruckus released their fourth full-length album, Sitcom Afterlife. Prior to the complete album release, the tracks \\"Sad Modernity\\", \\"Bathroom Stall Hypnosis\\", and \\"Darling Anonymity\\" were released individually, highlighting the band's shift toward a greater focus on classic power pop arrangements, while still remaining densely lyrical. On the release tour for Sitcom Afterlife, CMJ reviewed the band's Manhattan stop glowingly, writing: \\"For an hour, they treated the crowd to a sampling of songs taken from their three existing LPs as well as their upcoming fourth, and transported us from New York City to a larger, intangible, folktale version of suburban America.\\" In December 2016, Rolling Stone announced that Frontier Ruckus' 5th LP would be titled Enter the Kingdom and was to be released in February 2017. It was reported that the album was recorded in Nashville with founding Wilco member and final Uncle Tupelo drummer, Ken Coomer. They also premiered a music video for the single \\"27 Dollars,\\" featuring the band performing on the roof of the Penobscot Building in downtown Detroit. For the first half of 2017, the band toured across much of the United States and Europe in support of Enter the Kingdom. A music video for the album's title track was premiered by Billboard in late summer.

Since 2012, due to the situation in Syria, the school has been effectively shut down. Mission The Damascus Community School laid its foundation with the help of Syria's former foreign minister Salah al-Bitar, who was one of the co-founders of the Baath party. After much controversy between the school and the Syrian government, Damascus Community School, was finally able to obtain full license from the government. However, throughout the decades the school has seen itself become part of a political tug-of-war between the Syrian and American government whenever the relations of the two countries become sour. The school is credited with introducing Valentine‚Äôs Day to Syria, as well as many other Universal holidays. Annual tuition reaches to about US$17,000. Current enrollment is about 400 students. After an American raid into Syrian territory on October 26, 2008, the Syrian government decided to shut down the Damascus Community School in light of the violation of Syrian international borders and the absence of any official American explanation for the helicopter raid that killed 8 Syrian civilians. However, DCS Board of Directors voted to reopen Damascus Community School for 2010‚Äì2011 school year, grades PreK‚Äì8. Dr. James Leibzeit returned as a director. Following the 2011 unrest in Syria the school was shut down on January 22, 2012, and until further notice.

It consists of two settlements: the larger, Framilode, is at the mouth of the River Frome. The smaller settlement, Framilode Passage, lies about 0.5 mile downstream. The name, first recorded in the 7th century, means \\"Frome crossing point\\", probably signifying a crossing of the Severn by the mouth of the Frome. However by the 16th century the ferry was further downstream at Framilode Passage, and the ferry across the Severn here continued in occasional use until the Second World War. In 1126 Gloucester Abbey acquired a mill on the Frome at Framilode, and both corn mills and fulling mills continued to operate in the village until the late 18th century. The opening of the Stroudwater Canal in 1779 created water shortages, and by 1786 the mills were used for tinplate manufacture. By 1831 the mills were used as a forge, but were derelict by 1841. The Stroudwater Canal also entered the Severn at Framilode, and a canal basin was built at Framilode in 1794 and 1795. After the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal opened in 1827 use of the stretch between the junction with the new canal and the Severn declined, and in the 1920s the section was blocked and fell into disuse. The basin was subsequently filled. Framilode became an ecclesiastical parish in 1855, and the parish church of St Peter was built in 1854. The church is a Grade II listed building.

History of the Laurel Hill Farm  The Laurel Hill Farm has a varied history told from archaeology completed by the College of William and Mary, which found the house site along with Native-American artifacts. Peter Jefferson, father of Thomas Jefferson, surveyed the southern boundary of the property. The first member of J. E. B. Stuart's family to live on the property was William Letcher (1750‚Äì1780), who was killed on the farm in August 1780 by a Tory during the American Revolution. Letcher's grave on the property is the oldest marked grave site in Patrick County. J. E. B. Stuart's family came to the property in 1825 and lived there until 1859 when Elizabeth Stuart sold the property to two men from nearby Mount Airy, North Carolina.

Queisser's father was a mechanical engineer for Siemens. In 1928 he travelled to the United States to work on power plants and asked his fianc√©e to join him.

However, he instead applied for a scholarship in the United States and was accepted to the University of Kansas for 1951 and 1952. He returned to Germany and obtained his Ph.D. in physics at the University of G√∂ttingen in 1958. After Goettingen he was accepted at Shockley Transistor Corporation in Mountain View, California, where he worked on crystal growth, epitaxy, diffusion, lattice defects, junction properties and solar cells. It was during this time that he and Shockley calculated the maximal theoretical efficiency of silicon solar cells to be around 31%. William Shockley and Hans J.

Thomas at UC Berkeley. Queisser left Shockley for Bell Labs in 1964, working on gallium arsenide for optical electronics. It was during this time that he invented a high-power luminescent diode, an infrared light emitting diode (LED) that now forms the basis of almost every household remote control device. Modifications of the basic design represent practically every LED in existence today. In 1966 he left Bell to become a professor at the University of Frankfurt, and then went on to become a founding director of the Max-Planck-Institute at Stuttgart.

The program was adapted from William Inge's 1955 play, Bus Stop, and Inge was a script consultant for the series, which followed the lives of travelers passing through the bus station and the diner. Maxwell's co-stars were Richard Anderson as District Attorney Glenn Wagner, Rhodes Reason as Sheriff Will Mayberry, Joan Freeman as waitress Elma Gahrigner, Bernard Kates as Ralph the coroner, and Buddy Ebsen as Virge Blessing. Increasingly, as it became difficult to have guest stars be characters arriving by bus every week, the stories became more about people in the town which left little for Maxwell's character to do and led to her leaving the series after 13 episodes. She said, \\"There was nothing for me to do but pour a second cup of coffee and point the way to the men's room.\\" Emmy Award nominations Roy Huggins, the head of production at 20th Century Fox, created Bus Stop. Eight episodes were directed by Robert Altman. There were two Emmy Award nominations: (1) Richard L. Van Enger for \\"Outstanding Achievement in Film Editing for Television\\" and (2) Geraldine Brooks for \\"Outstanding Single Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role\\" for the episode \\"Call Back Yesterday\\", which aired on December 10, with David Hedison as her fellow guest star. The episode \\"Cherie\\" The series was preceded by Inge's play and the 1956 film, Bus Stop, in which Marilyn Monroe and Don Murray had the lead roles. The sixth episode (telecast November 12) was the series pilot, \\"Cherie,\\" the only episode directly based on Inge's play and movie. Tuesday Weld was cast in the title role of Cherie, an 18-year-old singer who hopes to be discovered in Hollywood, and 24-year-old Gary Lockwood portrayed Bo, a Montana rodeo cowboy who wants to marry her. Joseph Cotten also starred in the episode as Dr. Lyman. Lockwood appeared the same season as investigator Eric Jason in ABC's Follow the Sun and would star two years later as NBC's The Lieutenant. Weld had previously appeared as the materialistic teenager Thalia Menninger on CBS's The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis with Dwayne Hickman and Bob Denver. Other selected episodes The series premiere \\"Afternoon of a Cowboy\\" guest starred Steve Cochran, Anne Helm, Bethel Leslie, Chris Robinson, and Dean Stockwell. Diane Baker guest starred on October 15 in the episode \\"The Resurrection of Annie Ahern.\\" James Brolin had an uncredited role.

The episode, initially titled \\"Told By an Idiot\\", was directed by Altman. It starred Fabian as Luke Freeman, a seductive knife-wielding serial killer with Dianne Foster as Sally Wagner and Philip Abbott as Oliver West. The drama was adapted from Tom Wicker's 1961 novel, The Judgment. \\"And the Pursuit of Evil\\" aired on December 17, with guest stars James MacArthur and Keenan Wynn.

The guest stars were George Grizzard, Alfred Ryder, and Joanne Linville. In his book Danse Macabre, Stephen King nominated this episode as \\"...the single most frightening story ever done on TV.\\" King wrote that Bus Stop was \\"...a straight drama show... The final episode, however, deviated wildly into the supernatural, and for me, Robert Bloch's adaptation of his own short story 'I Kiss Your Shadow' has never been beaten on TV - and rarely anywhere else - for eerie, mounting horror.\\"King, Stephen. Danse Macabre. New York, Berkley Books, 1981. Page 219, footnote. King's attribution of the script to Robert Bloch is contradicted by the episode's opening titles, which read \\"Teleplay by Barry Trivers From the Short Story by Robert Bloch.\\" Losing out to Bonanza Despite the quality of its story lines, cast, and guests, Bus Stop failed in the ratings against NBC's Bonanza, which moved for its third season from Saturday to Sunday evenings in the 9 p.m. Eastern slot. Ronald Reagan and Jack Benny appeared at the same hour on CBS in General Electric Theater (its last season) and The Jack Benny Program.

The series features a magical girl scenario. The series won a Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards in 2004 for \\"Best Superhero Comic\\" and was nominated again in 2006. Plot The comic's plot largely parodies the tropes seen in magical girl series and follows male high school Kanazuchi Yuuki, who has been chosen by an animal mentor to be the next Valkyrie. Valkyries in the webcomic are superheroes with little connection to the mythological entities and are always female. Yuuki is transformed before the mentor notices that he is male, which is a source of consternation and humor through the series. Creator Sparkling Generation Valkyrie Yuuki has been drawn by Kittyhawk, who had previously worked on the webcomic The Jar. The artist has stated that her influences include Tex Avery and CLAMP, as well as her childhood in Japan. Kittyhawk has worked on several different webcomic series, including The Dragon Doctors, Itari Party!, Quickies! and Model. Kittyhawk currently works as a graphic designer and lives in the South East Queensland with her husband. Cast *Yuuki KanazuchiKanazuchi \\\\- The main character. Before being turned into a Valkyrie, Yuuki was a fan of the magical girl genre. In addition to showing persistent lack of interest in being a superhero, Yuuki faces the additional complications of having become a woman. Although the gods and giants both agree that Yuuki is perhaps the weakest Valkyrie, she does display numerous unprecedented powers, such as using her costume both offensively and defensively. *Hermod - Messenger of the gods and responsible for turning Yuuki into a female and a magical Valkyrie. Currently takes the form of some unknown marmoset. The task of finding the valkyrie fell to him, but in desperation of finding a worthy candidate, he posed as the DVD of a new Mahou-Shojo anime \\"Sparkling Generation Valkyrie\\", subsequently purchased by Yuuki. *Chiaki ShuzayaShuzaya \\\\- Yuuki's friend who dreams of being the assistant to a magical girl. She has since displayed some confusion of feelings towards Yuuki: although she considers her a friend, it is heavily implied that she has a lingering crush from before Yuuki's transformation. *Taki HimuroHimuro \\\\- Yuuki's main love interest as a female, Taki is well-versed in Norse legends. Although it's unclear how much he's already guessed about Yuuki's identity, he's shown considerable romantic interest in \\"her.\\" *Loki - The self- proclaimed \\"God of Awesome.\\" Currently possessing the \\"body\\" of a white plush cat, as his real body was chained in the underworld following his murder of Balder. Early in the comic it was implied that he served Surt, but his true allegiance is currently unclear. Although initially outspoken about Yuuki's weakness, he also shows respect for Yuuki's ingenuity and unique power. *Thor - The Norse God of Thunder, and Yuuki's trainer. *Freya - The Goddess of War and Beauty, and leader of all Valkyries. She has conflicting feelings towards Yuuki, wanting to kill Yuuki for being a weak Valkyrie, yet desiring to engage in a physical relationship with her. Although Loki thwarted her initial attempts to the former, Freya has since resurrected two Valkyries from ancient times to find Yuuki. *Freyr - Freya's twin brother and her complete opposite, Freyr opts for giving Yuuki a chance to become stronger. He allows Yuuki to stay in Alfheim where he can finish his training. *Odin - The Allfather and King of the Gods. His role has been small thus far, limited to chiding Hermod for his failings and informing him that Thor will be Yuuki's trainer.

It was composed between 1908 and 1910 and was premiered in 1912 at Nancy. It is an important example of the Breton cultural renaissance of the early 20th century. Origins =Libretto= Ropartz stated that he was looking for an opera subject that involved \\"interiorised action; few events; feelings; few characters; no spectacle.\\" He was given a copy of Le Goffic's short story collection Passions Celtes (1908), and was immediately attracted to the story L'islandaise (The Icelandic Girl), which describes a doomed love affair between the girl and a stranded Breton fisherman. It was based on the lives of the Breton \\"Icelanders\\", who fished in Icelandic waters and sometimes stayed there for periods. Ropartz had already created a score for Louis Tiercelin's stage adaptation of Pierre Loti's novel P√™cheur d'Islande (An Iceland Fisherman) on the same basic theme. Ropartz asked Le Goffic to adapt his story for the stage.Michel Fleury, The Song of the Exile, Le Pays, Timpani, 2002 =Music= Ropartz's style is influenced by the form of Wagner's music dramas and the structural innovations of C√©sar Franck. Ropartz makes frequent use of leitmotives and also incorporates elements of Breton folk melodies to represent the hero's nostagia for his homeland. The critic Michel Fleury argues that the music is built around four main themes, one of which represents Iceland, and in particular the bog which plays a role in the narrative; one represents the main female character and the emotion of love associated with her; another represents the male character and his nostalgia for Brittany. The fourth theme represents stability, associated with the heroine's father. Characters *Kaethe, an Icelandic girl - soprano *Tual, a Breton fisherman - tenor *J√∂rgen, Kaethe's father - baritone Synopsis Act I. Autumn: A cottage in Iceland: Tual, a Breton fisherman who has survived a shipwreck, has been recuperating in the home of J√∂rgen, an old trapper. He is tended by Kaethe, J√∂rgen's daughter. She suggests that Tual must be nostalgic for his Breton home. Tual reminds her that after he had dragged himself ashore from the shipwreck, he nearly died in the Hrafuaga, a dangerous Icelandic swamp; only J√∂rgen's timely arrival saved him. All the other fishermen on the ship were drowned, so everyone in Brittany will think him dead and he has no ties there anymore. Tual declares his love for Kaethe. Kaethe is worried that Tual's feelings may be temporary, but says she loves him too. In the absence of a preacher J√∂rgen \\"marries\\" the couple by insisting that Tual dedicate himself to Kaethe by swearing on the \\"mud of Hrafuaga\\" that if he ever abandons her it will swallow him up. Act 2 Spring: The Icelandic shore: Tual dreams of Paimpol, his home in Brittany, while making a small fishing boat. He sings Breton folk songs. Kaethe says she has seen a sadness in him for his homeland and worries that he will sail back to Brittany. Tual says his boat is too small for anything more than local waters. Kaethe tells him she is pregnant with his child, hoping that this will keep him beside her. Kaethe sings him a Nordic ballad about \\"Sir Olaf\\", who was abducted by the Queen of the Fairies. His loyal wife Lady Hilda waited for him for a hundred years, so that they could renew their love and die together. Tual says that they will live and die together like Olaf and Hilda. Act 3 Spring: The cottage: Kathe muses on Tual's increasingly withdrawn behaviour. J√∂rgen returns home tipsy after drinking gin and reminisces about Kaethe's late mother, describing how they grew up together. When Tual enters J√∂rgen mentions that some Paimpol fishermen have arrived at the village of Seidsfjord. Tual is excited and asks if it is easy to get there. J√∂rgen says that if the Hrafuaga swamp is still frozen, it can be crossed in time to catch them. Tual tries to put the thought out of his mind, but as he sleeps with Kaethe he has a dream of Brittany. In his vision he sees the rolling Breton landscape and the white sails of the Paimpol fishing fleet. He leaves and tries to cross the Hrafuaga. Kaethe watches as the swamp cracks and swallows him.

It honors the 800 citizens of the county who served in the Confederate Army during the American Civil War, and is one of several Confederate monuments in Kentucky featuring Robert E. Lee. There is another one in Bardstown KY.Murray, Ky. Trailsrus.com, Accessed November 12, 2008 Despite recent controversy, the Calloway County Fiscal Court voted to keep the statue on its grounds in July 2020. Establishment During the American Civil War, Calloway County saw about 800 of its citizens serve in the Confederate Army. 200 plus served in the Union Army. At the time of the Civil War 1,500 enslaved people were living in Calloway County making up about 15% of the county's population at the time. The monument was funded after a three-year fund raising drive by the J. N. Williams Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (U.D.C) in 1917, whose chairman died during that period; her name was added to the monument in tribute. The U.D.C. paid $2,500 to Marietta, Georgia's McNeel Monument Company for the structure.Brent, Joseph.

In its time, was the most elaborate and modern of the Civil War fountain monuments:Brent p.1 the other three fountains are the Confederate Memorial in Mayfield, Confederate Memorial Fountain in Hopkinsville, and the Confederate Monument of Cadiz. Four Doric columns support a granite canopy. Inside the canopy is an ornate iron light fixture with four incandescent bulbs to light the fountain. On top are four marble balls and a marble statue of Lee, making it the only monument in Kentucky that heavily features Robert E. Lee; the only other monument in Kentucky with a likeness of Lee is Bardstown, Kentucky's Confederate Monument of Bardstown which has only a small relief portrait of Lee below the large statue of a Confederate soldier. On July 17, 1997, the Confederate Monument in Murray was one of sixty-one different monuments related to the Civil War in Kentucky placed on the National Register of Historic Places, as part of the Civil War Monuments of Kentucky Multiple Property Submission. Controversy = Historically = Since its installation, the Robert E. Lee monument has gained significant controversy over its highlighting of an American traitor, slaveholder, and racist. Statues, such as this one, that were built far after the end of the Civil War during the period of Jim Crow laws are noted by historians from the American Historical Association as being erected to \\"intimidate African-Americans politically, as well as isolate them from mainstream public life\\". Historians also acknowledge, the monuments play a part of the \\"Lost Cause of the Confederacy\\" narrative, which downplays or omits the role of slavery in the Civil War, painting it instead as a heroic struggle by an outnumbered army to preserve the Southern way of life. The Robert E. Lee statue in Murray is an example of the statues installed during the peak of the \\"Lost Cause\\", when the forces of commercialization had begun to infiltrate the U.D.C. and the United Confederate Veterans (U.C.V.) organizations. =Calls for removal= In the wake of the George Floyd protests in June 2020, a call to remove the statue was initially made by Sherman Neal II, a football coach at Murray State University in a letter to Murray Mayor Bob Rogers and other local officials. When asked about this statue, Governor of Kentucky Andy Beshear said, \\"If it is at a courthouse, it ought to come down. Having a confederate monument on courthouse grounds or in the rotunda is not the right thing.\\" A number of other prominent local organizations and individuals called for Calloway Court to remove the statue including a unanimous resolution by the Murray City Council, Murray State University, Murray Main Street Board of Directors, and Ja Morant, among others. =Official response= In response to the June 2020 calls for removal, the Mayor of Murray, Bob Rogers, released a statement that the statue was situated on land owned by Calloway County and therefore the City of Murray had no jurisdiction which was confirmed by Judge/Executive of the Calloway County Fiscal Court, Kenny Imes. In its June 2020 meeting, Calloway Court updated its rules as a result of COVID-19 to limit the number of speakers discussing this issue which included Mr. Neal, but afterwards made no decision about whether to keep or remove the statue citing unclear ownership issues. During the July 2020 meeting of the Calloway Court, a proposal was heard from Kevin Elliott of the Murray State University Political Science Department to move the statue to the nearby Confederate cemetery however, the Court instead unanimously voted to keep the statue where it was located. While a number of reasons were provided in a resolution drafted by Calloway County Attorney Bryan Ernstberger, one of the justifications was a claim of statue ownership by the U.D.C. which Ernstberger indicated the Court could not dispute based on minutes from 1916 Calloway Court meeting which indicated the U.D.C. \\"may be granted the privilege of erecting a monument\\" on Courthouse grounds.Calloway County Fiscal Court, 1916, Meeting Minutes However, the minutes from the 1916 Calloway Court meeting also indicate \\"the location shall be by and with the approval of the Fiscal Court.\\" Although not part of the resolution, a voting magistrate of the Calloway Court, Paul Rister, indicated he was basing his vote on a survey where he drove around his district and asked people who were outside their homes their thoughts on the statue resulting in 77% asking for the monument to stay and 23% asking for it to be moved out of a reported 280 surveyed. = Protests = In the two months following the June 2020 calls for removal, a number of protests took place in Murray and Calloway County related to this statue, the killing of George Floyd, and police brutality nationwide. An arrest was made of a man at the protests for allegedly pointing a gun at protesters from his vehicle. Another arrest was made of a man who allegedly rolled down his window and sprayed pepper spray on multiple protesters and five police officers. According to police, the suspect then attempted to drive through the crowd of protesters and officers before being stopped by police. Following the Calloway Court's July 2020 vote to keep the statue on its grounds, a series of protests were held at the statue including both protesters and counter-protesters of the Court's decision.

After several years of fund raising, the monument was placed on the courthouse lawn on 21 September 1900 by the John C. Breckinridge Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (U.D.C.). The dedication ceremony included speeches and music.

National Register of Historic Places On July 17, 1997, the Confederate Monument in Owensboro was one of sixty-one different monuments related to the Civil War in Kentucky placed on the National Register of Historic Places, as part of the Civil War Monuments of Kentucky Multiple Property Submission. The only other monument on the list in Daviess County is the Thompson and Powell Martyrs Monument. Removal In 2012 and again in 2017, there were local grassroots efforts urging the Daviess County Fiscal Court to remove the Confederate monument from the courthouse lawn. Following another such effort in summer 2020, the Court voted unanimously by resolution on 6 August 2020 to remove the monument. The resolution stipulates that the Court will establish a 5-member relocation committee within six weeks of the vote. This committee is to recommend a relocation site(s) within six months of the vote. The monument will remain in place until the Court passes an ordinance approving this recommendation.\\"Fiscal Court votes to remove Confederate statue,\\" Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer, 7 August 2020.

He was born in Buenos Aires. Playing career The middle line of River Plate in 1945. From left to right: Norberto Y√°cono, N√©stor Rossi and Jos√© Ramos. \\"Pacho\\" Y√°cono was taken by a friend of his father to a test training at River Plate in 1933 when he was 13 years of age. He was chosen to stay and he made his debut for the professional team on 28 May 1939 in a match against Newell's Old Boys which was also the very last match of Bernab√© Ferreyra, who for a long period has been the most expensive player in the world. In 1941, 1942, 1945, 1947, 1952 and 1953 he won six league championships with the club. He also won each three times, the Copa Ibarguren, a competition between the winners of Argentine provincial championships, and the Copa Aldao, a competition between the champions of Argentina and Uruguay. Altogether the right fullback, particularly praised for his man-marking skills, played 393 times in official matches for River Plate - which puts him in the 9th rank in club history - albeit, he never scored. Notably he was one of the players that remained with the club in the late 1940s, when others like N√©stor Rossi, Adolfo Pedernera and the young Alfredo Di St√©fano left in the course of the big players strike then. He debuted for the national team on 12 August 1942 in the Est√°dio Centenario of Montevideo when Argentina drew 1-1 against Uruguay in a match for the Copa Lipton. The highlight of his career with Argentina was the South American Championship 1947 in which he featured in six of the seven matches in Guayaquil, Ecuador's second city. Argentina won the tournament undefeated.Mart√≠n Tabeira: Southamerican Championship 1947, Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation, 12 August 2009. His 15th and last match for the albiceleste when he captained Argentina in a friendly in London's Wembley Stadium on 9 May 1951. They lost to the hosts 1-2. Well into his mid-thirties he left River in 1953 to play for Am√©rica in Mexico City. With Am√©rica he won the finals of the cup competition, the Copa M√©xico, of 1954 and 1955, in both cases defeating CD Guadalajara. In 1955-56 he served as coach for the club.Erik Francisco Lugo: CF Am√©rica, Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation, 6 August 2015. By May 1958 he moved to Montreal in Canada where he initially played in National Soccer League - which consisted of 10 clubs from Toronto, two from Hamilton just about 70 km southwest of Toronto, and three from Montreal - for Cantalia SC, a club supported by Italian immigrants.Lex Mexicains viennent nos donner une le√ßon du soccer?, Le Petit Journal, Montreal, 1958-05-11, p. 115. At the time they also hired Alberto Piavone from Buenos Aires who in 15 years with Ferro Carril Oeste became the second highest scorer of that club. The league competition was won by Montreal Hungaria and Cantalia became sixth. For the 1959 season he joined the Alouettes, also in Montreal. This time the league was won by Cantalia and Alouettes finished 7th. However, they went on to win the Canadian cup competition, the National Challenge Cup, of 1959, widely considered the quasi national championship. For this purpose they defeated on September 19 the Westminster Royals from the Vancouver region 3-2 in the Fred Hamilton Park in Toronto's \\"Little Italy\\". His teammate Tony Bonezzi, who was also born in Buenos Aires would die eight years later in a tragic accident in Israel, aged just 35. From 1960 to 1962 he finished his playing career in the USA.  Honours  * Copa Am√©rica: 1947. * Primera Divisi√≥n Argentina: 1941, 1942, 1945, 1947, 1952, 1953. * Copa Ibarguren: 1941, 1942, 1952. * Copa Aldao: 1941, 1945, 1947. * Copa M√©xico: 1954, 1955. * Canadian National Challenge Cup: 1959. Coaching career In 1961, he was the head coach for Montreal Cantalia in the Eastern Canada Professional Soccer League. After retiring as a player in the early 1960s Y√°cono returned to Argentina where he worked as the manager of Sportivo Italiano, Lan√∫s and Godoy Cruz. Later in his career he took up a position of youth team coach for River Plate. After he immigrated to the USA and lived in New Jersey, he was still very active with soccer and became the coach for Iberia Airlines of Spain in the New York Airlines Soccer League, which does not exist any more . That was in the early 70s. His knowledge and passion for soccer helped the team to win the championship in 1973. Through the efforts of Norberto Yacono, Iberia Airlines was able to incorporate in the team recently retired players from Argentina, such as Norberto Troilo and Guillermo Heredia. His son, \\"Pichi\\", also played for the team that winning year. It is reported that for arranging the match between Kansas City Spurs and Brazil's Santos FC around their superstar Pel√© during their tour of the USA in 1968 he was bestowed the honorary citizenship of Kansas City.

He is based in New York City and regularly travels to Iran. Early life Majd's maternal grandfather was the Ayatollah Mohammad Kazem Assar (1885‚Äì1975), who was born to an Iraqi mother and an Iranian father. The Ayatollah, along with other contemporary ulema, overcame traditional opposition to serve as a professor of philosophy at the University of Tehran.Mehrzad Boroujerdi, Iranian Intellectuals and the West. The tormented triumph of nationalism (University of Syracuse 1996) at 95, 188‚Äì189. His own father, whose origins were in the village of Ardakan, Iran, became representative of a \\"middle class\\" that was \\"pro-democratic and pro-modernization\\".Majd, The Ayatollahs' Democracy (2010): the Ayatollah at page 89, his own father at pages 90‚Äì91. The Ayatollah's son Nassir Assar (born 1926), Majd's uncle, incurred controversy and later personal danger due to his appointment under the Shah as \\"deputy prime minister in charge of Oghaf\\" (an Iranian waqf [religious endowment]). Ibid. at 89‚Äì90. The expatriate singer and author Shusha Guppy (1935‚Äì2008), a daughter of the same Ayatollah, was his aunt. Raised in a family involved in the diplomatic service, Majd lived from infancy abroad, mostly in the US and in England but attending American schools in varied places, such as Tunis and New Delhi. He boarded at St Paul's School in London, England until 1974 and attended George Washington University for electrical engineering in Washington, D.C. and graduated in 1977. He studied operations research at GWU for two more years but did not complete. He stayed in the US after the 1979 revolution. Career He has published three non- fiction books, in the U.S., the U.K. and which have been translated into a number of other languages : *The Ayatollah Begs to Differ: The Paradox of Modern Iran (New York: Doubleday 2008) *The Ayatollahs' Democracy: An Iranian Challenge (New York: Norton 2010). *The Ministry of Guidance Invites You to Not Stay: An American Family in Iran (New York: Tantor Audio 2013) He has also published short fiction in collections and in The American Scholar and Guernica. Majd has also served as an advisor and translator for President Mohammad Khatami and translator for President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on their trips to the United States and the United Nations, and has written about those experiences. Views Roland Elliott Brown writes in the British newspaper The Observer that \\"Majd's mild reformist agenda requires him to fight on two fronts\\" and that he has \\"honed his polemical skills by defending the nascent Islamic Republic to Iranian emigres at Speakers' Corner in London.\\"Roland Elliott Brown, \\"The Ayatollahs' Democracy: An Iranian Challenge by Hooman Majd ‚Äì review\\", The Observer, January 21, 2012. Accessed July 26, 2012. adding that, in his opinion, Majd is \\"a sometimes sympathetic communicator of the regime's positions, and an enthusiast only for its most loyal oppositionists\\". Reviewing Majd's book The Ayatollahs' Democracy, Brown observes that Majd regards the administration as \\"increasingly fascistic\\": \\"flawed, capricious, but also popular, and a bulwark of sovereignty\\". According to Newsweek, \\"Majd's Iran is a land where ayatollahs criticize each other and young people flout rules about wearing chadors. It's a land where Majd‚Äîwho makes no secret of his admiration for the reformist President Mohammad Khatami‚Äîcould go on to serve as the official translator for Khatami's successor and archrival, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, when the latter visited New York in September. But Majd is no Iran apologist: he ridicules Ahmadinejad's officials for their Holocaust deniers' conference in 2006. Majd's subtle central point is that \\"the lack of meaningful relations between Iran and the United States ‚Ä¶ has brought little advantage to either nation.\\" Following the 2009 election in Iran, which he \\"concedes [. . .] fielded only regime-vetted candidates and was stolen\\", Majd continues to enjoy access to its politicians and officials, especially to former President Khatami. Admittedlly \\"emotionally invested in the politics of the country\\", a stated goal of Majd's is to shed light on the elusive \\"truth about Iran\\" that is fair for all of its people.Majd, The Ayatollahs' Democracy (2010): author's goals, at 44‚Äì46; Khatami, at 6, 14, 24‚Äì25, 34, etc. Twitter controversies In July 2012 a tweet from Majd's Twitter account was made about Iranian-born Nazanin Afshin-Jam, a human rights advocate and the wife of Canadian Defence Minister Peter MacKay. The tweet read: \\"Fucking a Canadian minister doesn‚Äôt make you Canadian, azizam. Come back to papa ‚Ä¶\\" Majd has denied making it, and in a later public tweet directed at Afshin-Jam Majd said his account had been hacked: \\"@NazaninAJ A recent series of tweets were made in my name as a result of a hack. Not my words, and tweets have been removed.\\" Before the tweet Afshin-Jam had been calling on the Canadian government and the Canadian Assembly of First Nations to cut diplomatic ties with the Islamic Republic of Iran. Afshin-Jam described the matter as serious but added that \\"unless I can verify exactly who sent it, I can't really comment.\\" In October 2013, Majd referred to Iranian-American Wall Street Journal (WSJ) assistant books editor Sohrab Ahmari as \\"WSJ's (Iranian) 'House Negro'\\" in a post on Twitter. Majd acknowledged the statement was insult, but said he stood by it.

According to Helen Balanoff from the NWT Literacy Council and Cynthia Chambers from the University of Lethbridge, this knowledge is integral to social identity and Inuinnaqtun literacy.

Early years l'Ami learned to play chess at the age of five, when his father introduced him to the moves and then took him to the local chess club. Chess career At Gausdal in 2004, he won the tournament, ahead of Magnus Carlsen and despite being expected to finish no higher than mid-table. He soon fulfilled the requirements for an International Master (IM) title, awarded the same year. Becoming a full-time professional, the opportunities for travel continued to suit his lifestyle and in 2005, he complemented his training and dedication with a few good wins, gaining the necessary norms to be awarded the Grandmaster title. During this period, he finished second equal at the Essent tournament, was co-winner of the strong Karabakh 'B' tournament and scored well at the Wijk aan Zee Corus 'C' tourney, earning an upgrade to the 'B' tournament in 2006. At the Turin 2006 Olympiad, he played a small but helpful role in the national team with a very respectable score of 3.5/5. By then, his Elo rating was reflecting the consistency in his performances and he passed the 2600 mark by the early part of 2007. Working with a new coach (GM Vladimir Chuchelov) was perhaps another reason for his continued progress. At the European Team Chess Championship at Heraklion in 2007, he contributed another plus score (4.5/8) to the Netherlands team total. 2008 was a rewarding year for l'Ami. He finished with a share of second place at the European Individual Championship in Plovdiv, missing out on the medals after an eight-way play- off. More recently, he took part in the EU Individual Open Chess Championship at Liverpool, maintaining touch with the leading group throughout and finishing with a share of fifth place, alongside compatriots Sergei Tiviakov and Jan Smeets. He took part in the Chess World Cup 2009 and was knocked out by Krishnan Sasikiran in the first round. In 2010, L'Ami helped Veselin Topalov in his World Championship match against Viswanathan Anand. In 2014, L'Ami participated in chess.com death match against Jan Smeets, which he won. In 2015, he won the Reykjavik Open scoring 8.5/10.Reykjavik Open 2015 Chess- Results L'Ami is renowned for his ability at rapid chess and even the more extreme forms of speed chess, where for example, each player has only 1 minute for the entire game. His handle on the Internet Chess Club is \\"Woef\\". Chess second In 2008 l'Ami began working as a second to Ivan Cheparinov after the two had met at a tournament and became friends. Principally, he was engaged to assist Cheparinov at the elite Sofia M-Tel Masters event and benefited not only from the theoretical work they undertook together, but also from the insight he gained into chess at that level. In an interview given after the event, he considered the experience to be \\"inspirational\\". Along with Cheparinov and Francisco Vallejo Pons, he served as a second for Veselin Topalov in the February 2009 Challengers Match against Gata Kamsky. He has since served as second of Anish Giri.

It is directed by award-winning Dutch documentary filmmaker Jos de Putter. Filming took place in China, France, The Netherlands, United States and Sweden. Languages spoken in the documentary include Dutch, English, French, Spanish, Swedish, Standard Chinese and Korean. Beyond the Game is the motto of the World Cyber Games, which is central to the documentary as the main characters compete to defend or regain the event's championship title at the global finals of the 2007 World Cyber Games in Seattle, Washington. It has premiered at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam in Path√© de Munt, and had the cinema premiere in Path√© Tuschinski, and has now been released in cinemas throughout The Netherlands.  Historical background  In 2002 the videogame Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos is released which sells millions of copies and quickly becomes a leading title in the world of competitive gaming. It was followed in 2003 by an expansion, Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne. A 17-year-old Swede by the name of Fredrik Johansson devotes himself to this new sport and rises to become the runner-up of the 2003 Electronic Sports World Cup and becomes widely regarded as the strongest non- Asian player. He is subsequently invited to become a full-time professional gamer in Seoul, South Korea where competitive gaming is an advanced subculture and many players make a living playing games. During his eleven-month stay there he wins the Blizzard Worldwide Invitational and is recognized as the world's most successful gamer.\\"Overview nominees and winners of eSports Award 2004\\" - After his return to Sweden he becomes runner-up of the Electronic Sports World Cup 2004 again, but subsequently loses his motivation for the sport and qualifies for one more event in the 2004 World Cyber Games before retiring a few months later. There he is defeated prematurely and a new European star takes over from him as 16-year-old Manuel Schenkhuizen wins the event. Dutchman Schenkhuizen was staying in Seoul at the time and a few months after the event he returns home and remains a dominating player. During this period his in-game race of choice, Orc, is considered disadvantaged in competition but he nevertheless is successful, winning the Electronic Sports World Cup 2005. He gains the nickname 'King of Orcs' in televised competition, similar to the nickname 'Terran Emperor' for twofold StarCraft world champion Lim Yo-Hwan (Boxer). He is considered a favorite to defend his World Cyber Games title at the 2005 global finals in Suntec City, Singapore and cement his name as the best player ever; but is defeated at the event by Dennis \\"Shortround-\\" Chan, a 22-year-old in college semi retired pro gamer. Throughout the next year both players are frequent participants in the same international competitions. Schenkhuizen is successful enough to be honored as the Player of the Year in all of competitive gaming like Johansson two years before him. The award most important to both players however is that of World Cyber Games champion as the two qualify for the 2006 global finals in Monza, Italy and meet in the quarter-finals. Winning a second title would mean inclusion in the World Cyber Games Hall of Fame for either of them. This clash is observed by documentary filmmaker Jos de Putter who senses the deep emotions involved in the encounter, not only by the players but also by the spectators. Afterwards the filmmaker decides to follow both players on their way to their next World Cyber Games encounter, where one player will try to defend and the other to regain the World Cyber Games title, and portray this new world. To provide insight in the background of the gaming scene and the mind of competitors he also contacts Fredrik Johansson who is developing a new life in Sweden and is now regarded as a legend in the world of competitive gaming.

Biography Barbara was born in Prague into a family of doctors, both psychiatrists. Mother Libu≈°e Nesvadbov√° is involved with assisting immigrants and ethnic minorities. Father Josef Nesvadba (‚Ä† 2005) was known as an author of sci-fi literature. Barbara‚Äôs ex-husband is the politician Karel B≈ôezina with whom she has a daughter Bibiana Nesvadbov√°. B√°ra has a degree in journalism and mass communication from the Faculty of Social Sciences, Charles University, in Prague. She started working as editor-in-chief of Xantypa and later Playboy. Currently, she is editor-in-chief of the Czech edition of the prestigious fashion magazine Harper's Bazaar.  Literary career  While at university, Barbara had already started working with publisher Romana P≈ôidalov√°. Until then, she had written short essays and sketches which were later all linked through one character, and became short stories. This resulted in her first book, ≈ò√≠zka≈ôi (‚ÄúSchnitzellers‚Äù), which deals with sex, relationships and a young journalist named Karla who is trying to find her way. B√°ra‚Äôs second book, Besti√°≈ô (‚ÄúBestiary‚Äù), officially proclaimed one of the most-borrowed library books, became the basis for the eponymous movie where the main characters were played by Danica Jurƒçov√°, Karel Roden and Marek Va≈°ut. The movie was directed by the famous Czech director Irena Pavl√°skov√°. Barbara Nesvadbov√° co-wrote the script. Her next books followed fast: ≈Ωivot naneƒçisto (‚ÄúLife as a Draft‚Äù); Poh√°dk√°≈ô (‚ÄúStoryteller‚Äù) which became a movie in 2014 with Ji≈ô√≠ Mach√°ƒçek and Eva Herzigov√° playing the main characters; a collection of short sketches Brusinky (‚ÄúCranberries‚Äù); and a short story collection, Bor≈Øvky (‚ÄúBlueberries).

Licensed to Walpole, New Hampshire, United States, it serves the Monadnock Region in Southwestern New Hampshire and Southeastern Vermont. It first began broadcasting in 2001 under the call sign WLPL. The station is owned by Great Eastern Radio. Programming is simulcast with the second HD Radio channel of WHDQ (106.1 FM) in Claremont and translator W294AB (106.7 FM) in Hanover, which serve the Lebanon-Rutland- White River Junction area. History 96.3 FM went on the air in January 2001 as WLPL, owned by Gary Savoie and simulcasting Vox Radio Group-owned oldies station WWOD (104.3 FM). WLPL's sign on was delayed when environmental objections prevented the station from building a tower in Athens, Vermont; it chose to transmit from an existing tower in New Hampshire. The call letters were changed to WCFR-FM on October 19, shortly after they were dropped from WXKK (93.5 FM, now WEEY); soon afterward, Savoie sold the station to Vox. Nassau Broadcasting Partners acquired most of Vox's northern New England radio stations, including WCFR and WWOD, in 2004. WCFR-FM's call letters were changed to WPLY-FM on October 12, 2005, then to WFYX on October 7, 2008. WFYX, WWOD, and 28 other Nassau stations in northern New England were purchased at bankruptcy auction by Carlisle Capital Corporation, a company controlled by Bill Binnie (owner of WBIN-TV in Derry), on May 22, 2012. The stations, and 11 of the other stations, were then acquired by Vertical Capital Partners, controlled by Great Eastern Radio owner Jeff Shapiro. As this would put Shapiro over the U.S. Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) ownership limits in the Lebanon-Rutland-White River Junction market, WWOD and WEXP were acquired by Electromagnetic Company, a company controlled by William and Gail Goddard; WFYX was not included in that transaction.

Early training  Arthur Catterall was born in Preston, Lancashire, the son of John Catterall, a painter and his wife Elizabeth, a cotton weaver. He was an extremely gifted musician in childhood. He first played the violin in public at a concert in Preston when he was 6 years old. He played the Mendelssohn violin concerto in Manchester at the age of 9.H.

Catterall graduated from St Bede's at the age of 16 in 1898. In 1902, at the age of 18, he was invited to Bayreuth by Hans Richter and played at all of Cosima Wagner's musical evenings in that season. He appeared at a Hall√© Orchestra concert in 1903 playing Tchaikovsky's concerto.These details from Arthur Eaglefield Hull, Dictionary of Modern Music and Musicians (Dent, London 1924).

Chamber music  In addition to his orchestral and teaching work, Catterall was active in chamber music throughout his career. In 1915 Frederick Delius wrote a Sonata for violin and piano for Catterall and the pianist R.J. Forbes.T. Beecham, Frederick Delius (Hutchinson, London 1959), 173. He led the Catterall Players, an ensemble for chamber performance, which performed the Elgar quintet in 1921.Obituary of Thomas Facer, Musical Times 62 (no 946), 1 December 1921, p. 872. He had connections with the London Chamber Music Players (led by Albert Sammons), with the pianist William Murdoch (pianist) and 'cellist W. H. Squire, and founded and in 1910 founded and led a string quartet under his own name as the Catterall Quartet. In this John S.

At the same time Catterall was recording for Columbia Records as a soloist in complete versions of Mozart's Concerto no 5 in A minor K219, and Bach's concerto for two violins with John S. Bridge, both under the direction of Hamilton Harty, c. 1924. The quartet also transferred to recording for Columbia. He recorded the Brahms violin sonata in D minor with Murdoch in November 1923. He also recorded by the electrical microphone process after 1925.

Move to London  After many years teaching at the Manchester College, Catterall became Professor at the Royal Academy of Music in London.Whelbourn, Celebrated Musicians. Among his pupils were Harry Blech, Margaret Jones Wiles, Walter Appleyard, Eugene Genin, Arthur Leavins, Laurance Turner, Gloria Pashley, and also Olive Zorian (1916‚Äì1965) (founder and leader of the Zorian Quartet which pioneered works by Michael Tippett in 1943‚Äì44 and those of Britten soon afterwards). After leaving the Hall√© orchestra he concentrated on solo work, performing for example the Beethoven concerto under Thomas Beecham with the London Symphony Orchestra in March 1927.letter by John Cawte Beaglehole. He also developed as a conductor, taking the third concert of the 1929 Delius Festival at the Queen's Hall (Eventyr, Cynara, Piano concerto, Arabesk and Appalachia).Thompsonian Delius information site In 1929, Catterall became the founding leader of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, though the proms were at first led by his assistant violin Charles Woodhouse. When the orchestra first appeared in full strength (115 players), on 22 October 1930, at the Queen's Hall in its inaugural concert with the Flying Dutchman overture, Brahms' Fourth Symphony, the Saint-Sa√´ns cello concerto (with Guilhermina Suggia) and Ravel's Symphonic Fragments from Daphnis et Chlo√©, under Adrian Boult, Catterall led the orchestra.R.

Catterall retired from his position with the BBC Orchestra in 1936, to devote his time to solo work and teaching. He formed another chamber orchestra for young string players, The Catterall String Orchestra, led from 1940 to 1943 by Audrey Catterall (b. 1917).Peter Mountain, Scraping a Living (AuthorHouse 2007), pp 123, 264. ]. Mountain asserts that Catterall was a pupil of Joseph Joachim's, though this is not stated in earlier sources used here. For Audrey Catterall, see Who's Who in Music He remained busy into the first years of the war, still a champion of contemporary composers. He performed the Brahms double concerto (with cellist Thelma Reiss) and gave the English premiere of Felix Weingartner's Sinfonietta (with Reiss and violist Bernard Shore) under Weingartner's baton at a Royal Philharmonic concert in February 1939.R. Elkin, Royal Philharmonic (Rider, London 1946), 177. He was memorably associated with the cellist Antonia Butler in a prom performance at the Queen's Hall of the Brahms double concerto in August 1940. After an air-raid warning was heard and the audience was obliged to remain indoors, the musicians improvised an all- night concert.Margaret Campbell, 'Obituary: Antonia Butler', The Independent, 26 July 1997.

A view model or viewpoints framework in systems engineering, software engineering, and enterprise engineering is a framework which defines a coherent set of views to be used in the construction of a system architecture, software architecture, or enterprise architecture. A view is a representation of a whole system from the perspective of a related set of concerns.ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011, Systems and software engineering ‚Äî Architecture descriptionISO/IEC 10746-1, Information technology ‚Äî Open Distributed Processing ‚Äî Reference model: Overview Since the early 1990s there have been a number of efforts to prescribe approaches for describing and analyzing system architectures. These recent efforts define a set of views (or viewpoints). They are sometimes referred to as architecture frameworks or enterprise architecture frameworks, but are usually called \\"view models\\". Usually a view is a work product that presents specific architecture data for a given system. However, the same term is sometimes used to refer to a view definition, including the particular viewpoint and the corresponding guidance that defines each concrete view. The term view model is related to view definitions.  Overview  The purpose of views and viewpoints is to enable humans to comprehend very complex systems, to organize the elements of the problem and the solution around domains of expertise and to separate concerns. In the engineering of physically intensive systems, viewpoints often correspond to capabilities and responsibilities within the engineering organization.Edward J. Barkmeyer ea (2003). Concepts for Automating Systems Integration NIST 2003. Most complex system specifications are so extensive that no single individual can fully comprehend all aspects of the specifications. Furthermore, we all have different interests in a given system and different reasons for examining the system's specifications. A business executive will ask different questions of a system make-up than would a system implementer. The concept of viewpoints framework, therefore, is to provide separate viewpoints into the specification of a given complex system in order to facilitate communication with the stakeholders. Each viewpoint satisfies an audience with interest in a particular set of aspects of the system. Each viewpoint may use a specific viewpoint language that optimizes the vocabulary and presentation for the audience of that viewpoint. Viewpoint modeling has become an effective approach for dealing with the inherent complexity of large distributed systems. Architecture description practices, as described in IEEE Std 1471-2000, utilize multiple views to address several areas of concerns, each one focusing on a specific aspect of the system. Examples of architecture frameworks using multiple views include Kruchten's \\"4+1\\" view model, the Zachman Framework, TOGAF, DoDAF, and RM-ODP.  History  In the 1970s, methods began to appear in software engineering for modeling with multiple views. Douglas T. Ross and K.E. Schoman in 1977 introduce the constructs context, viewpoint, and vantage point to organize the modeling process in systems requirements definition.Douglas T. Ross and K.E. Schoman, Jr. \\"Structured analysis for requirements definition.\\" IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, SE-3(1), January 1977. According to Ross and Schoman, a viewpoint \\"makes clear what aspects are considered relevant to achieving ... the overall purpose [of the model]\\" and determines How do we look at [a subject being modelled]? As examples of viewpoints, the paper offers: Technical, Operational and Economic viewpoints. In 1992, Anthony Finkelstein and others published a very important paper on viewpoints.A. Finkelstein, J. Kramer, B. Nuseibeh, L. Finkelstein, and M. Goedicke. \\"Viewpoints: A framework for integrating multiple perspectives in system development.\\" International Journal of Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering, 2(1):31-58, 1992. In that work: \\"A viewpoint can be thought of as a combination of the idea of an ‚Äúactor‚Äù, ‚Äúknowledge source‚Äù, ‚Äúrole‚Äù or ‚Äúagent‚Äù in the development process and the idea of a ‚Äúview‚Äù or ‚Äúperspective‚Äù which an actor maintains.\\" An important idea in this paper was to distinguish \\"a representation style, the scheme and notation by which the viewpoint expresses what it can see\\" and \\"a specification, the statements expressed in the viewpoint's style describing particular domains\\". Subsequent work, such as IEEE 1471, preserved this distinction by utilizing two separate terms: viewpoint and view, respectively. Since the early 1990s there have been a number of efforts to codify approaches for describing and analyzing system architectures. These are often termed architecture frameworks or sometimes viewpoint sets. Many of these have been funded by the United States Department of Defense, but some have sprung from international or national efforts in ISO or the IEEE. Among these, the IEEE Recommended Practice for Architectural Description of Software-Intensive Systems (IEEE Std 1471-2000) established useful definitions of view, viewpoint, stakeholder and concern and guidelines for documenting a system architecture through the use of multiple views by applying viewpoints to address stakeholder concerns. The advantage of multiple views is that hidden requirements and stakeholder disagreements can be discovered more readily. However, studies show that in practice, the added complexity of reconciling multiple views can undermine this advantage. IEEE 1471 (now ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011, Systems and software engineering ‚Äî Architecture description) prescribes the contents of architecture descriptions and describes their creation and use under a number of scenarios, including precedented and unprecedented design, evolutionary design, and capture of design of existing systems. In all of these scenarios the overall process is the same: identify stakeholders, elicit concerns, identify a set of viewpoints to be used, and then apply these viewpoint specifications to develop the set of views relevant to the system of interest. Rather than define a particular set of viewpoints, the standard provides uniform mechanisms and requirements for architects and organizations to define their own viewpoints. In 1996 the ISO Reference Model for Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP) was published to provide a useful framework for describing the architecture and design of large-scale distributed systems.  View model topics  = View = A view of a system is a representation of the system from the perspective of a viewpoint. This viewpoint on a system involves a perspective focusing on specific concerns regarding the system, which suppresses details to provide a simplified model having only those elements related to the concerns of the viewpoint. For example, a security viewpoint focuses on security concerns and a security viewpoint model contains those elements that are related to security from a more general model of a system.Sinan Si Alhir (2003). \\"Understanding the Model Driven Architecture (MDA)\\". In: Methods & Tools. Fall 2003. A view allows a user to examine a portion of a particular interest area. For example, an Information View may present all functions, organizations, technology, etc. that use a particular piece of information, while the Organizational View may present all functions, technology, and information of concern to a particular organization. In the Zachman Framework views comprise a group of work products whose development requires a particular analytical and technical expertise because they focus on either the ‚Äúwhat,‚Äù ‚Äúhow,‚Äù ‚Äúwho,‚Äù ‚Äúwhere,‚Äù ‚Äúwhen,‚Äù or ‚Äúwhy‚Äù of the enterprise. For example, Functional View work products answer the question ‚Äúhow is the mission carried out?‚Äù They are most easily developed by experts in functional decomposition using process and activity modeling. They show the enterprise from the point of view of functions. They also may show organizational and information components, but only as they relate to functions.US Department of the Treasury Chief Information Officer Council (2000). Treasury Enterprise Architecture Framework. Version 1, July 2000. = Viewpoints = In systems engineering, a viewpoint is a partitioning or restriction of concerns in a system. Adoption of a viewpoint is usable so that issues in those aspects can be addressed separately. A good selection of viewpoints also partitions the design of the system into specific areas of expertise. Viewpoints provide the conventions, rules, and languages for constructing, presenting and analysing views. In ISO/IEC 42010:2007 (IEEE- Std-1471-2000) a viewpoint is a specification for an individual view. A view is a representation of a whole system from the perspective of a viewpoint. A view may consist of one or more architectural models.IEEE-1471-2000 Each such architectural model is developed using the methods established by its associated architectural system, as well as for the system as a whole. = Modeling perspectives = Modeling perspectives is a set of different ways to represent pre-selected aspects of a system. Each perspective has a different focus, conceptualization, dedication and visualization of what the model is representing. In information systems, the traditional way to divide modeling perspectives is to distinguish the structural, functional and behavioral/processual perspectives. This together with rule, object, communication and actor and role perspectives is one way of classifying modeling approaches John Krogstie, (2003). Conceptual modeling, = Viewpoint model = In any given viewpoint, it is possible to make a model of the system that contains only the objects that are visible from that viewpoint, but also captures all of the objects, relationships and constraints that are present in the system and relevant to that viewpoint. Such a model is said to be a viewpoint model, or a view of the system from that viewpoint. A given view is a specification for the system at a particular level of abstraction from a given viewpoint. Different levels of abstraction contain different levels of detail. Higher-level views allow the engineer to fashion and comprehend the whole design and identify and resolve problems in the large. Lower-level views allow the engineer to concentrate on a part of the design and develop the detailed specifications. Illustration of the views, products and data in Architecture Framework. In the system itself, however, all of the specifications appearing in the various viewpoint models must be addressed in the realized components of the system. And the specifications for any given component may be drawn from many different viewpoints. On the other hand, the specifications induced by the distribution of functions over specific components and component interactions will typically reflect a different partitioning of concerns than that reflected in the original viewpoints. Thus additional viewpoints, addressing the concerns of the individual components and the bottom-up synthesis of the system, may also be useful. = Architecture description = An architecture description is a representation of a system architecture, at any time, in terms of its component parts, how those parts function, the rules and constraints under which those parts function, and how those parts relate to each other and to the environment. In an architecture description the architecture data is shared across several views and products. At the data layer are the architecture data elements and their defining attributes and relationships. At the presentation layer are the products and views that support a visual means to communicate and understand the purpose of the architecture, what it describes, and the various architectural analyses performed. Products provide a way for visualizing architecture data as graphical, tabular, or textual representations. Views provide the ability to visualize architecture data that stem across products, logically organizing the data for a specific or holistic perspective of the architecture.  Types of system view models  = Three-schema approach = ANSI/X3/SPARC three-level architecture, which determined three levels to model data.Matthew West and Julian Fowler (1999). Developing High Quality Data Models . The European Process Industries STEP Technical Liaison Executive (EPISTLE). The Three-schema approach for data modeling, introduced in 1977, can be considered one of the first view models. It is an approach to building information systems and systems information management, that promotes the conceptual model as the key to achieving data integration.STRAP SECTION 2 APPROACH. Retrieved 30 September 2008. The Three schema approach defines three schemas and views: * External schema for user views * Conceptual schema integrates external schemata * Internal schema that defines physical storage structures At the center, the conceptual schema defines the ontology of the concepts as the users think of them and talk about them. The physical schema describes the internal formats of the data stored in the database, and the external schema defines the view of the data presented to the application programs.John F. Sowa (2004). [ \\"The Challenge of Knowledge Soup\\"]. published in: Research Trends in Science, Technology and Mathematics Education. Edited by J. Ramadas & S. Chunawala, Homi Bhabha Centre, Mumbai, 2006. The framework attempted to permit multiple data models to be used for external schemata.Gad Ariav & James Clifford (1986). New Directions for Database Systems: Revised Versions of the Papers. New York University Graduate School of Business Administration. Center for Research on Information Systems, 1986. Over the years, the skill and interest in building information systems has grown tremendously. However, for the most part, the traditional approach to building systems has only focused on defining data from two distinct views, the \\"user view\\" and the \\"computer view\\". From the user view, which will be referred to as the ‚Äúexternal schema,‚Äù the definition of data is in the context of reports and screens designed to aid individuals in doing their specific jobs. The required structure of data from a usage view changes with the business environment and the individual preferences of the user. From the computer view, which will be referred to as the ‚Äúinternal schema,‚Äù data is defined in terms of file structures for storage and retrieval. The required structure of data for computer storage depends upon the specific computer technology employed and the need for efficient processing of data.itl.nist.gov (1993) Integration Definition for Information Modeling (IDEFIX) . 21 Dec 1993. = 4+1 view model of architecture = Illustration of the 4+1 view model or architecture. 4+1 is a view model designed by Philippe Kruchten in 1995 for describing the architecture of software-intensive systems, based on the use of multiple, concurrent views.Kruchten, Philippe (1995, November). Architectural Blueprints ‚Äî The ‚Äú4+1‚Äù View Model of Software Architecture. IEEE Software 12 (6), pp. 42-50. The views are used to describe the system in the viewpoint of different stakeholders, such as end-users, developers and project managers. The four views of the model are logical, development, process and physical view: The four views of the model are concerned with : * Logical view: is concerned with the functionality that the system provides to end-users. * Development view: illustrates a system from a programmers perspective and is concerned with software management. * Process view: deals with the dynamic aspect of the system, explains the system processes and how they communicate, and focuses on the runtime behavior of the system. * Physical view: depicts the system from a system engineer's point of view. It is concerned with the topology of software components on the physical layer, as well as communication between these components. In addition selected use cases or scenarios are utilized to illustrate the architecture. Hence the model contains 4+1 views.  Types of enterprise architecture views  Enterprise architecture framework defines how to organize the structure and views associated with an enterprise architecture. Because the discipline of Enterprise Architecture and Engineering is so broad, and because enterprises can be large and complex, the models associated with the discipline also tend to be large and complex. To manage this scale and complexity, an Architecture Framework provides tools and methods that can bring the task into focus and allow valuable artifacts to be produced when they are most needed. Architecture Frameworks are commonly used in Information technology and Information system governance. An organization may wish to mandate that certain models be produced before a system design can be approved. Similarly, they may wish to specify certain views be used in the documentation of procured systems - the U.S. Department of Defense stipulates that specific DoDAF views be provided by equipment suppliers for capital project above a certain value. = Zachman Framework = Simplified illustration of the Zachman Framework with an explanation of the rows.US Department of Veterans Affairs (2008) A Tutorial on the Zachman Architecture Framework . Accessed 06 Dec 2008. The original framework is more advanced, see for an example here. The Zachman Framework, originally conceived by John Zachman at IBM in 1987, is a framework for enterprise architecture, which provides a formal and highly structured way of viewing and defining an enterprise. The Framework is used for organizing architectural \\"artifacts\\" in a way that takes into account both who the artifact targets (for example, business owner and builder) and what particular issue (for example, data and functionality) is being addressed. These artifacts may include design documents, specifications, and models.A Comparison of the Top Four Enterprise Architecture Methodologies , Roger Sessions, Microsoft Developer Network Architecture Center, The Zachman Framework is often referenced as a standard approach for expressing the basic elements of enterprise architecture. The Zachman Framework has been recognized by the U.S. Federal Government as having \\"... received worldwide acceptance as an integrated framework for managing change in enterprises and the systems that support them.\\"Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework = RM-ODP views = The RM-ODP view model, which provides five generic and complementary viewpoints on the system and its environment. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Reference Model for Open Distributed Processing (RM- ODP) ISO/IEC 10746-1:1998 Information technology ‚Äì Open Distributed Processing: Reference Model ‚Äì Part 1: Overview, International Organization for Standardization, Geneva, Switzerland, 1998. specifies a set of viewpoints for partitioning the design of a distributed software/hardware system. Since most integration problems arise in the design of such systems or in very analogous situations, these viewpoints may prove useful in separating integration concerns. The RMODP viewpoints are: * the enterprise viewpoint, which is concerned with the purpose and behaviors of the system as it relates to the business objective and the business processes of the organization * the information viewpoint, which is concerned with the nature of the information handled by the system and constraints on the use and interpretation of that information * the computational viewpoint, which is concerned with the functional decomposition of the system into a set of components that exhibit specific behaviors and interact at interfaces * the engineering viewpoint, which is concerned with the mechanisms and functions required to support the interactions of the computational components * the technology viewpoint, which is concerned with the explicit choice of technologies for the implementation of the system, and particularly for the communications among the components RMODP further defines a requirement for a design to contain specifications of consistency between viewpoints, including: * the use of enterprise objects and processes in defining information units * the use of enterprise objects and behaviors in specifying the behaviors of computational components, and use of the information units in defining computational interfaces * the association of engineering choices with computational interfaces and behavior requirements * the satisfaction of information, computational and engineering requirements in the chosen technologies = DoDAF views = The Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) defines a standard way to organize an enterprise architecture (EA) or systems architecture into complementary and consistent views. It is especially suited to large systems with complex integration and interoperability challenges, and is apparently unique in its use of \\"operational views\\" detailing the external customer's operating domain in which the developing system will operate. DoDAF linkages among views.DoD (2007) DoD Architecture Framework Version 1.5 . 23 April 2007 The DoDAF defines a set of products that act as mechanisms for visualizing, understanding, and assimilating the broad scope and complexities of an architecture description through graphic, tabular, or textual means. These products are organized under four views: * Overarching All View (AV), * Operational View (OV), * Systems View (SV), and the * Technical Standards View (TV). Each view depicts certain perspectives of an architecture as described below. Only a subset of the full DoDAF viewset is usually created for each system development. The figure represents the information that links the operational view, systems and services view, and technical standards view. The three views and their interrelationships driven ‚Äì by common architecture data elements ‚Äì provide the basis for deriving measures such as interoperability or performance, and for measuring the impact of the values of these metrics on operational mission and task effectiveness. = Federal Enterprise Architecture views = In the US Federal Enterprise Architecture enterprise, segment, and solution architecture provide different business perspectives by varying the level of detail and addressing related but distinct concerns. Just as enterprises are themselves hierarchically organized, so are the different views provided by each type of architecture. The Federal Enterprise Architecture Practice Guidance (2006) has defined three types of architecture: Federal Enterprise Architecture levels and attributesFederal Enterprise Architecture Program Management Office (2006). FEA Practice Guidance . * Enterprise architecture, * Segment architecture, and * Solution architecture. By definition, Enterprise Architecture (EA) is fundamentally concerned with identifying common or shared assets ‚Äì whether they are strategies, business processes, investments, data, systems, or technologies. EA is driven by strategy; it helps an agency identify whether its resources are properly aligned to the agency mission and strategic goals and objectives. From an investment perspective, EA is used to drive decisions about the IT investment portfolio as a whole. Consequently, the primary stakeholders of the EA are the senior managers and executives tasked with ensuring the agency fulfills its mission as effectively and efficiently as possible. By contrast, segment architecture defines a simple roadmap for a core mission area, business service, or enterprise service. Segment architecture is driven by business management and delivers products that improve the delivery of services to citizens and agency staff. From an investment perspective, segment architecture drives decisions for a business case or group of business cases supporting a core mission area or common or shared service. The primary stakeholders for segment architecture are business owners and managers. Segment architecture is related to EA through three principles: structure, reuse, and alignment. First, segment architecture inherits the framework used by the EA, although it may be extended and specialized to meet the specific needs of a core mission area or common or shared service. Second, segment architecture reuses important assets defined at the enterprise level including: data; common business processes and investments; and applications and technologies. Third, segment architecture aligns with elements defined at the enterprise level, such as business strategies, mandates, standards, and performance measures. = Nominal set of views = In search of \\"Framework for Modeling Space Systems Architectures\\" Peter Shames and Joseph Skipper (2006) defined a \\"nominal set of views\\",Peter Shames, Joseph Skipper. \\"Toward a Framework for Modeling Space Systems Architectures\\" .

William Denny and Brothers of Dumbarton, Scotland launched her on September 25, 1858. She was powered by a 400 nhp direct-acting steam engine that drove a single screw. She was completed in 1859. Hungarians maiden voyage began on May 18, 1859 when she left Liverpool for Quebec. She was wrecked in 1860 at Cape Sable Island, off Nova Scotia, with the loss of all aboard. Rescue of the John Martin At 8:00 on November 9, 1859, Hungarian sighted a vessel in distress in a strong northerly gale and high seas off the edge of the Newfoundland Banks. A crew of 7 men, including Chief Officer Hardie and Third Officer Porter were lowered into a lifeboat and headed to the vessel. Upon arriving within hailing range, they were told the ship was the British schooner John Martin, which also carried the rescued crew of another schooner wrecked off Labrador. The sinking John Martin was abandoned by its complement of 43, including 23 women and children. Chief Officer Hardie was knocked overboard while helping passengers into Hungarian. He could not swim, but hauled himself aboard by a rope and survived the ordeal. Hungarian headed for St. John's and arrived on the morning of the November 10. Each member of Hungarians crew who had helped in the lifeboat was given a party by the passengers of the trip, and also received a silver cup for their heroism. Sinking On February 8, 1860, Hungarian left Liverpool, England for Portland, Maine, under the command of Captain Thomas Jones. She called at Queenstown, Ireland, and departed from there on February 9, 1860. On the night of February 19, she wrecked on Cape Ledge, the west side of Cape Sable, Nova Scotia, with total loss of life. The wrecked ship, and survivors who clung to her, were visible from shore, but unreachable due to high seas and gale-force winds that did not relent until six days later.

However, it was later discovered the Rebels had used ineligible players and the Pacific Coast Athletic Association (now Big West Conference) had the Rebels forfeit all the wins from the 1983 and 1984 seasons, though the wins were not stricken from NCAA and UNLV records.Mark Anderson, Is there any solution for UNLV football?, Las Vegas Review-Journal, August 4, 2008, Accessed November 3, 2008. Although none of the ineligible players were used in the bowl game, the California Bowl was among the games forfeited. The issue erupted at the same time the university president, Robert Maxson, was in the middle of an hostile relationship with the school's famous head basketball coach, Jerry Tarkanian, over similar off-the-court issues with players. The athletic director at the time, Brad Rothermel, noted in later years that Maxson wanted to fire Hyde because of the coach's friendship with Jerry Tarkanian's brother, Myron, stating \\"When President Maxson discovered (that friendship), he did what he could to level the legs of the football program.

Things became more difficult for the embattled coach, as nine of his players got involved in various scrapes with the law ranging from theft to assault. Finally, on April 23, 1986, Hyde was fired by Maxon with three years left on his $62,500-a-year contract, which the university said it would honor.

He was ordained a Catholic priest for the Society of Jesus (S.J.) on July 6, 1973. On December 5, 1983, he was appointed the third bishop of the Roman Catholic \\"diocese of Nkayi\\" and he was consecrated bishop on January 6, 1984 by pope Jonh PaulII assisted by Cardinals Eduardo Mart√≠nez Somalo and Duraisamy Simon Lourdusamy, inside Saint Peter's Patriarchal Vatican Basilica. Following the appointment of Msgr. Georges-Firmin Singha as Bishop of Pointe-Noire, Bishop Kombo was transferred to the Diocese of Owando on July 7, 1990 as the second bishop of that diocese from the Republic of the Congo-Brazzaville.. He was very direct in his manner.http://biyayenda.net/spip.php?article58 From 1991‚Äì1992, he was elected to head Congo's interim legislature, \\"the Conseil Superieur de la Republique (CRS)\\". In October 1994, at the General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, at the Vatican, Bishop Kombo proposed that some Roman Catholic nuns be made members of the College of Cardinals, because of their mission to the Roman Catholic Church. Msgr. Kombo died in Paris, France, at the Val de Gr√¢ce Hospital of stomach cancer, on Wednesday, October 22, 2008, aged 67, where he was recovering from his poor health. According to his will, his body was repatriated to his native Congo for internment inside the small Catholic Cemetery adjoining the Metropolitan Cathedral Sacre-Coeur of Brazzaville.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/31222009/ernest-kombo Notes Category:1941 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Presidents of the National Assembly (Republic of the Congo) Category:Republic of the Congo Jesuits Category:Republic of the Congo Roman Catholic bishops Category:Republic of the Congo Roman Catholics Category:20th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:21st-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Jesuit bishops ","title":"Ernest Kombo"},{"id":"20061630","text":"Track map of all storms during the season The 2003 Atlantic hurricane season was an active Atlantic hurricane season with tropical activity before and after the official bounds of the season ‚Äì the first such occurrence in 50 years. The season officially began on June 1, 2003 and ended on November 30. However, a pre-season storm, Tropical Storm Ana, led to the season starting on April 20, and storm activity continued through December 11. The timeline includes information which was not operationally released, meaning that information from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as information on a storm that was not operationally warned upon, has been included. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, as well as dissipations during the season. This season had 21 tropical depressions, of which, 16 became named storms. Of these, 7 strengthened into hurricanes with 3 intensifying into major hurricanes. Hurricane Fabian, Hurricane Isabel, and Hurricane Juan had their names retired due to the impact caused in Bermuda, the eastern United States, and Nova Scotia respectively. Both Fabian and Juan were the worst hurricanes to hit their respective areas, causing $450 million in damages and 16 fatalities. Hurricane Isabel was the strongest, deadliest, and costliest storm of the season. Isabel peaked as a Category 5 hurricane over the open waters of the Atlantic; however, it weakened to a Category 2 before impacting the east coast of the United States, causing $3.6 billion in damages and 51 fatalities.

All the songs were written for performance on A Prairie Home Companion. Guests include Pat Donohue and Greg Leisz. Reception Sing Out! stated in its Summer 2003 review: \\"Ostroushko, like Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k and Aaron Copland before him is able to grasp the kernel of music at the center of \\"the American experience\\", and transform it into a larger, more colorful whole... Coming Down from Red Lodge is destined to become one of Ostroushko's most popular recordings.\\" Writing for Allmusic, music critic Chris Nickson wrote the album is \\"a perfect illustration of his breadth and instrumental virtuosity on both fiddle and mandolin...

The Survivors attained cult status in Australia by their acknowledged popular live performances and contribution to the Lethal Weapons punk compilation album. Original band members were Greg Williamson on guitar and vocals, Jim Dickson on bass guitar and vocals, Bruce Anthon on drums and vocals. David Nichols, from the Mess And Noise website, commented that, \\"The Survivors were legends in their home town of Brisbane, a highly popular and adept band whose sets were mainly cool ‚Äô60s covers.\\" The Survivors were a group behind Brisbane's original punk scene during 1976 to 1977. According to music historian, Ian McFarlane, Brisbane produced \\"some of the most anarchistic bands of the Australian punk rock era and that it was a city nationally renowned for its ultra conservatism.\\" The band released one single called \\"Baby Come Back\\", on the Real label in 1977, which was later reissued on the Suicide label in 1978. A live vinyl album called Worse than Perfect was released in 1988.  History  The Survivors, a southern suburbs Brisbane band, had a mutual admiration for 1960s music but originally they named their band Rat Salad after the Black Sabbath song. They changed their name in 1977 to The Survivors still mostly playing parties or occasionally hiring a hall, where they had to \\"watch out for the noise vigilant cops\\", \\"until the Curry Shop venue began supporting local punk acts in the heart of Brisbane on Sundays.\\" Whilst known for their energetic versions of other group‚Äôs songs, they managed to release one stamped sleeve seven inch single on the Real label. The A-side Baby Come Back flirted with 1960s music but also had a strong stylistic sense of original New York City punk. They encountered condemnation from punk circles for being to close to Sixties covers music as Jim Dickson recounts, \\"Criticism was often levelled at the Survivors for their lack of original material. The band were able to exist in those punksnobbery times because their energy was equal to anyone's and purely dedicated to the music which transcended the transient social commitments of the time.\\" Mushroom Records subsidiary label Suicide Records reissued the seven inch single and added both songs onto the Lethal Weapons compilation album in 1978. This was the extent of their output when they were still in existence. The band broke up in late 1978 but did manage to do shows in Sydney later on including a show with The Visitors. The band members Jim Dickson and Bruce Anthon formed The Sleepers and then The Shakers. In 1979 Jim Dickson went on to record with Sydney act The Passengers, whose singer was Angie Pepper later known for The Angie Pepper Band and the single Frozen World. Jim Dickson also went on to play for profile bands that included The Barracudas, The Deniz Tek Group and Radio Birdman amongst many others. According to Jim Dickson, \\"Bruce and Greg had been busy in '79 with the Credits, who recorded a single, It's You / Fazed Dazed, for the Rocking Horse Record Shop label\\". Drummer, Bruce Anthon, went on to play with numerous other groups, including bands that did jazz or blues.  Legacy  In 1988 the band managed to retrospectively release an album recorded live in August 1978 at the Rex Hotel, Kings Cross, Sydney, called Worse than Perfect. The original recording of Baby Come Back had also been included as part of the 2015 CD Compilation called \\"Stranded, The Chronicles Of Australian Punk\\". This CD was a wide retrospective of Australian punk, officially released by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Four by Four label.

It lies on the very northern edge of the South Wales Coalfield some six miles north-east of Ystradgynlais and just outside the southern boundary of the Brecon Beacons National Park. It is known for Henrhyd Falls, a 27m high waterfall which serves as a National Trust- managed visitor attraction on the Nant Llech. To the east of the village flows the Afon Pyrddin which plunges over two more spectacular falls. As first edition Ordnance Survey maps of the area show, the name 'Coelbren' applied to a farmhouse and chapel before the modern village developed and is recorded in the name Tyre y Kolbren in 1503 where it signifies the sharing of land (modern Welsh 'tir') by means of drawing lots, a 'coelbren' being translated amongst other things as an 'inscribed piece of wood' or 'omen-stick'.  History  The Roman road of Sarn Helen runs close to the village on its eastern side. Its remains and that of a Roman fort are now much degraded. The Brecon Forest Tramroad was constructed through the village in the 1820s. Of note to the east of Coelbren is the site of Banwen Ironworks, whose partial survival is owed to its early failure. It was constructed in the 1840s by speculators from London but may have produced only 80 tons of pig iron, the whole exercise being enveloped in a financial scandal.Hughes, S. & Reynolds, P. A Guide to the Industrial Archaeology of the Swansea Region. RCAHMW 2nd edn 1989 From the 1873, Coelbren was the location of a significant junction on the Neath and Brecon Railway whence a 7-mile branch diverged leading to the Swansea Vale Railway at Ynysygeinon. The contractor John Dickson had a terrace of houses constructed quite possibly for navvies working on the line and known originally as Dickson's Row though now known as Price's Row.Hughes, S. & Reynolds, P. A Guide to the Industrial Archaeology of the Swansea Region. RCAHMW 2nd edn 1989 The lines closed in 1962 though the trackbed can still be seen almost encircling the eastern part of the village. The route to Swansea Vale has now been converted into a cycleway as Route 43 of the National Cycle Network linking the village with Ystradgynlais; it is planned that the trackbed northwards towards Brecon should also form part of Route 43. A school was opened in the village in 1894, housed at first in the vestry of Moriah Baptist Chapel. It was transferred to a new purpose-built site further west on Heol Eglwys in 1898 and in 1912 it was greatly expanded. The original Coelbren Welfare and Memorial Hall was built towards the top of Station Road in 1925 and served until the 1990s when the current building was constructed. The A4221 road linking Abercraf with the A4109 Inter Valley Road (Glynneath to Aberdulais) near Dyffryn Cellwen passes to the immediate south of the village, its construction later in the 20th century rendering the village less isolated than it had been hitherto.

It is generally found on the top floor and only accessible by a staircase, sometimes a separate \\"service staircase\\". Initially, these rooms were intended as the bedroom for one of the family's domestics, and the name originates from the colloquial name for such maids: a \\"bonne √† tout faire\\". Today, chambres de bonne are usually the cheapest rung on the Parisian letting market, and are primarily rented by less well-off workers and students. They are also in high demand among workers who wish to maintain a small room or postal address in a big city, especially Paris. Due to the social level of the envisaged occupants, chambres de bonne are characterised by their tight proportions. The rooms usually have a surface area of around 6‚Äì12 m2 (65 to 130 sq ft), which is sometimes accentuated by being in a garret. They tend to offer minimal facilities: toilets are usually shared with the neighbouring rooms, and located on the landing. Chambres de bonne have nevertheless been the object of legislation to preserve their occupants' quality of life and health. In the twentieth century, the French government stipulated that all rental properties must have a minimum surface area of 9 m2 (100 sq ft), a volume of 20 m3 (700 cu ft), and openings (windows, doors, etc.) equivalent to an eighth of the surface area. In recent years, landlords have attempted to rebrand their chambres de bonne by advertising them as studettes, a hitherto-unknown category of housing for smaller studios (broadly, those of 12 m2 (130 sq ft) or less). Since most listings agencies do not recognise a firm distinction between \\"studios\\" and \\"studettes\\", chambres de bonne may also simply be advertised as studios. Parisian apartment-hunters are, nevertheless, often able to infer that a studio is a chambre de bonne from its listing, due to the distinctive features described above.

The trains bypassed the south Kentucky rail hub of Bowling Green. In 1958, the station stopped being used for passenger traffic, as the L&N; claimed annual losses of $130,000 for continuing the passenger service. Since then it has seen several different uses. In the 1970s it was used as a discoth√®que and then a pizza parlor, but both were unsuccessful, leaving the station empty for a time. Major overhauls of the station occurred in 1982 and 1988, with the latter seeing a two-story atrium and office added to its eastern side. Current tenants include a preschool, an architectural design group, an adult day care, and a Hilliard Lyons office.

It is distinguished as the oldest university chorale in the Philippines, celebrating its 98th season in 2018. It has held concerts internationally, and has released several albums with songs genres ranging from Classical, Negro spiritual, Sacred choral works, as well as Pop, and OPM. The Glee Club remains active internationally through the performances it stages and choral festivals it participates in.  History  The Glee Club was started in 1921, the year the American Jesuits took over the administration of Ateneo Municipal de Manila. Its primary function was providing liturgical music at the San Ignacio Church in old Intramuros. Jose Mossesgeld Santiago, a 1911 graduate of the Ateneo who became the first Filipino to sing at La Scala de Milan, was appointed conductor. Following a three-year hiatus, James B. Reuter restarted the Glee Club. In 1974, when the university turned co-educational, the choir became mixed. The ACGC peaked in 1979 when Joel Navarro, a recipient of an award from the Metro Manila Popular Music Festival for his composition \\"Swerte Swerte Lang\\", arrived at the scene. A string of performances of the choir including the innovative Concert in Your Homes, TV and 5-star hotel shows and the 1980 National Music Competition for Young Artists (NAMCYA) where they won the First Prize in the College Division, followed. When the second International Choral Festival was held in the Cultural Center of the Philippines the year after, the Glee Club was top-rated among the Philippine choirs that participated for \\"opening the gates of heaven with their moving rendition of Thompson's Alleluia\\" as a critic wrote. In 1989, they went on a brief European tour and were cited Best Choir in the international festivals in Loreto, Italy and Nancy, France. A year later, Navarro took a 3-year leave due to the pressure of work from the University of the Philippines (UP), and the Asian Institute of Liturgy and Music (AILM). Eudenice Palaruan, Navarro's friend and replacement as the conductor, began North American and Guam concert tours, a national tour, and a concert with Lea Salonga in Manila. Navarro's determination to eschew the lure of European tilts and steer his group toward a niche in the recording arena paid off in 1996 when the GC snared a couple of Katha awards: for Best rendition of a Traditional song \\"Lagi kitang Naaalala\\" and for Best Traditional Music Album for \\"Lahi\\". It was a first for any university-based chorale, and more importantly, Lahi became the first and by far the only classical, choral or traditional recording to be nominated Album of the Year competing against the country's mainstream commercial recordings. Then, he led them in successful concert tours in Guam and North America (1997), in a national tour (1998), and in Guam again (1999). = Year 2000 and onwards = At the turn of the millennium, the glee club scaled the greatest heights. Under Navarro and Jonathan Velasco, two of the country's leading conductors, they swept all the competitions they joined in two months in Slovenia, Italy, Ireland and France - and reached the apex by winning the Grand Prix in Tours, France. In less than a year they added more laurels to their credentials - top prizes in Tolosa, Spain. In 2001, they won First Prize in Marktoberdorf, Germany, under the leadership of Velasco. The following year, the Glee Club embarked on a new paradigm in choral singing after Ramon Acoymo, alumnus of the Philippine Madrigal Singers, accomplished tenor soloist, and vocal pedagogue, took over as Musical Director. He led the new batch of the Glee Club and honed the raw but promising skills of the Katipunan-based singers. He culminated his term by commissioning new compositions of Marian songs set into choral idiom. In 2002 the Glee Club had its first female conductor in the person, Ma. Lourdes Hermo, an alumna of the Philippine Madrigal Singers and the Philippine Youth Orchestra. Under Hermo, the choir went on a concert tour of the United States and Guam in 2004, performed in festivals, had a live recording in 2005, and celebrated its 85th year with a European competition-concert tour where they won all awards in Miltenberg, Germany and top prizes in Arezzo, Italy in 2006. In celebration of its 90th year in 2011, the group embarked on another European Tour. It won in the 33rd International May Choir Competition in Varna, Bulgaria, earning them the distinction to compete in the European Grand Prix for Choral Singing (GPE) in Maribor, Slovenia in April 2012.

The station was founded by The Licking County Fund for Public Giving, on behalf of the Newark City School District. Studios were originated at Newark High School. In the early years of the station, WGSF broadcast on UHF channel 28, programming a mix of local programming, with additional programs from National Educational Television (via film and videotape), and from WOSU-TV in Columbus (via an off-air pickup). Equipment and cameras were lent to WGSF by WCET, Cincinnati's educational station. In 1966, WCET took back the cameras, when WGSF was unable to buy them; soon after this, Cleveland‚Äôs then CBS affiliate WJW-TV donated two cameras to WGSF. The station broadcast on channel 28 until 1970, when the Ohio ETV Network Commission, The Ohio State University (owners of WOSU), and Nationwide Broadcasting requested that the station move to channel 31, with Nationwide providing funds for the move. In 1970 WGSF became a member station of PBS, and was soon connected to the national feed, ending reliance of WOSU for networked programming. WGSF signed off on June 30, 1976, not only due to aging equipment, but due to opportunities for Newark City Schools to operate a channel on cable TV (due to laws mandating cable systems to devote a channel for educational television use), as well as opportunities for Ohio's PBS affiliates to expand to underserved communities. The following day after the station's closedown, WOSU opened W31AA, a low-powered repeater operating on the former WGSF's channel. (W31AA would close down in 2009 following WOSU-TV's conversion to digital.) Newark City School's cable channel would open in 1977, after the local cable franchise provided a cable link to Newark High. The channel 28 frequency would be reallocated to Columbus as a commercial frequency; this channel would be reactivated when WTTE signed on in 1984.

History In a deed of Emperor Otto I dated 956 giving property to Quedlinburg Abbey is mentioned the cave church dedicated to Saint Michael, also known as the Volkmarskeller (as it is still called) near the Egger√∂der spring. The same deed also mentions the cell of the revered anchorite Liutbirg, which traditionally was held to have been sited in or near the cave church.research in the 1930s showed that to be an error, and ascertained that the cell of Liutbirg had been sited in the nearby Waldhusen Abbey near Thale The holiness of the site proved attractive, and a religious community formed round it. In 1139 Beatrix II, abbess of Quedlinburg, founded a Cistercian monastery here, which was settled in 1146 by monks from Kamp Abbey. A few years later the new monastery was transferred away from the cave church to form Michaelstein Abbey on the present site. The abbey's growing property brought it great wealth, but it never settled any daughter houses of its own. The monastery was sacked in 1525 by rebellious mobs during the German Peasants' War. The church was ruined beyond repair, and was never rebuilt; religious services were held from then on in the former chapter house. In 1533 the remaining buildings were ransacked and devastated by Wilhelm von Haugwitz. In 1543 the last Roman Catholic abbot resigned, and the abbey and its assets passed into the hands of the Counts of Blankenburg, who acted as abbots. Under their rule the now Protestant community began a school in 1544. After the death of the last count in 1599, Blankenburg and its possessions, including Michaelstein Abbey, came to the Duke of Brunswick, who appointed his brother Christian abbot of Michaelstein. He relinquished the position in 1624, after which the Dukes instead appointed Protestant theologians. From 1629 to 1631 and from 1636 to 1640, during the Thirty Years' War, short-lived communities of Cistercian monks again occupied the monastery. In 1690 Michaelstein passed into the possession of the Dukes of Brunswick-L√ºneburg. Under abbot Eberhard Finen a seminary for Protestant preachers was established in 1717, which operated alongside the school until 1721, when the school was closed, leaving the abbey as a seminary and a Protestant men's collegiate foundation. At this period substantial building works were carried out, including the conversion of part of the west wing as a Baroque church. In 1808, under French occupation, the abbey was closed down. Thereafter the buildings were used only for farming purposes, largely the accommodation of farm workers, and so began many years of deterioration. Stiftung Kloster Michaelstein In 1945, as part of the land reforms of the Communist government of East Germany, the abbey estates were split up and redistributed. Some Work on the abbeys buildings took place from 1956, but it was in 1968 that the main restoration scheme began, on the initiative of the Telemann Chamber Orchestra and its director Dr. Eitelfriedrich Thom. In 1977 was founded the culture and research facility that formed the basis of the later Institut f√ºr Auff√ºhrungspraxis der Musik des 18ten Jahrhunderts (\\"Institute for the Performance of the Music of the 18th Century\\"). In 1988 a museum was created, with a collection of predominantly historical musical instruments. In the same year a group was formed from among the musicians of the Telemann Chamber Orchestra who played on historical musical instruments as the \\"Barockensemble des Telemann- Kammerorchesters\\". In 1995, for lack of funds, the full Telemann Chamber Orchestra was wound up, but the Baroque Ensemble continued, playing on historical instruments, and took over the name of the Telemann Chamber Orchestra. In 1997 the Institute was changed into the Stiftung Kloster Michaelstein - Musikinstitut f√ºr Auff√ºhrungspraxis. From 2001 the Landesmusikakademie of Sachsen-Anhalt has also been based here. From 2000 the orchestra was gradually separated from the Institute and urged towards independence. Some time afterwards there was a split between the musicians: one part continues to play on historical instruments as the \\"Telemannisches Collegium Musicum\\", while the other part, under the leadership of the widow of Dr. Eitelfriedrich Thom, continues under the old name as the \\"Telemann- Kammerorchester\\", but without any connection to Michaelstein Abbey. The former monastic buildings, now accommodating both the Foundation (Stiftung) and the Sachsen-Anhalt Music Academy (Landesmusikakademie Sachsen-Anhalt), host various musical events, particularly the series of concerts known as the Michaelsteiner Klosterkonzerte, often featuring the Michaelstein Chamber Choir (Kammerchor Michaelstein) and the Telemanisches Collegium Michaelstein Orchestra. Guided tours of the abbey complex, including the herb- and vegetable gardens, laid out according to historical sources, and of the musical instrument display, are conducted throughout the year. A music library is located in the west wing, and is often accessible to the public. A highlight of the year is the annual Michaelstein Abbey Festival (Michaelsteiner Klosterfest). In addition the Foundation organises conferences and seminars at a European level and supports ongoing research. Other structures In the external wall of the Baroque church created in the west wing of the surviving monastery precinct, are immured the remains of Beatrice of Gandersheim (d. 1061), daughter of Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor, and abbess of Gandersheim and Quedlinburg. Formerly buried at Quedlinburg Abbey, Beatrice's remains were displaced after the church there burnt down in 1070, and were apparently finally laid to rest in Michaelstein in the 1160s. The nearby M√∂nchem√ºhle (\\"monks' mill\\") on the Goldbach brook was once the monastery's oil mill.

Such communities as this were depopulated through resettlement programs of the provincial government between 1954 and 1975.Resettlement in Newfoundland and Labrador terms refers to an organized approach to centralize the population into growth areas. It is used in the current context when referring to a voluntary relocation initiated from isolated communities themselves. Three attempts of resettlement were initiated by the Government between 1954 and 1975 which resulted in the abandonment of 300 communities and nearly 30,000 people moved.Encyclopedia of Newfoundland and Labrador, Volume four, p. 585, . Government's attempt of resettlement has been viewed as one of the most controversial government programs of the post- Confederation Newfoundland and Labrador. In the 21st century, the Community Relocation Policy allows for voluntary relocation of isolated settlements. Five communities have been resettled that way since 2000, after voting over a threshold of 90%. Background The history and commerce of Newfoundland and Labrador was built on the fishery and thus many small communities were established throughout the entire coastal region. Some of these communities were seasonal fishing stations and some eventually grew into communities which were very much isolated from much of the country except for water transportation or overland hiking trails. In many communities the seasonal inshore cod fishery provided both sustenance and the vast majority of employment opportunities. In the early 20th century settlement patterns and population distribution were changing due to a number of factors. Newfoundlanders began moving to larger centres such as St. John's. For example, in 1874 the population of St. John's was 30,574 and the major Conception Bay districts had a combined population of 41,368. By 1935 the population of the Conception Bay districts had increased by over 4,500 people, while the population of St. John's had more than doubled to 65,256 people.Encyclopedia of Newfoundland and Labrador, Volume four, p. 587, Other parts of the island and Labrador went through major changes in resource development that affected areas outside the Avalon Peninsula. The construction of paper mills in both Grand Falls and Corner Brook drew many people from coastal towns and villages. These areas contributed to growth in other areas such as Botwood and Deer Lake. Mineral discoveries at places such as Wabush and Labrador City, St. Lawrence, Baie Verte and Buchans also contributed to the movement of people away from the outports. World War II also had a part to play when air force bases were built at Stephenville, Argentia and Goose Bay,Encyclopedia of Newfoundland and Labrador, Volume four, p. 588, . and the booming international airport in Gander. The 1992 cod moratorium especially affected Newfoundland's rural outports, where the loss of an important source of income caused widespread out-migration. Some communities have tried to compensate by fishing shellfish, crab and shrimp, but their stocks are faltering in recent years. The moratorium is still in effect, but it has been slightly loosened to allow for some fishing. However, the stocks remain critical according to industry experts. The ever-shrinking communities are struggling with an aging population that needs access to essential services. As of October 2017, the province's marine transportation system costs $76 million annually. It is often cited as a burden to the economy, requiring spending millions of dollars to guarantee frequent transport from communities with no more than a hundred residents. Prior to 1954 Prior to the start of the government sponsored resettlement program many communities were abandoned for various reasons including disease, lack of work and natural disaster. One of the earliest examples of this is the community of Garia. The community lost 3/4 of its inhabitants after they decided to move to Anticosti Island for work in 1873. The remaining residents slowly moved away and the community was abandoned in the 1910s. Between 1946 and 1954, it is estimated that 49 communities were abandoned without government intervention. Government officials had long petitioned for a greater concentration of the population, citing many benefits. In 1953 the Newfoundland Department of Welfare offered small amounts of financial assistance to residents of 110 communities to accelerate the process which had come naturally. This became the beginning of the government assisted resettlement program for the province. Labrador on a much smaller scale was experiencing a resettlement when the Moravian Church in the northern part of Labrador was relocating the Inuit to centres such as Hebron and Nain. Dr. Wilfred Grenfell, in his efforts to provide health and educational benefits to the people of southern Labrador and the northern coast of the Great Northern Peninsula, also helped to the centralization of populations in areas such as St. Anthony and Charlottetown. First Resettlement Program (1954-1965) 1961 Resettlement of Silver Fox Island: a house being relocated to Dover. In 1954 the provincial Department of Welfare introduced a program to encourage residents of small coastal communities to move to larger \\"growth centres\\". The government would pay for the relocation of all of a families belongings as well as their house to the new community. This was changed to a cash payment of $150 per family at the start of the program and gradually increased to $600 per family by the end of the program. This was a significant amount of money as the a fisherman working in the inshore fishery was generally under $500 per year. In order for a community to be eligible for assistance every member would have to agree to relocate. By 1965 the program had helped resettle 115 communities with a combined population of 7500. Second and Third Resettlement Programs (1965-1975) In 1965 the provincial and federal governments partnered in a new resettlement program. The new program was administered by the Department of Fisheries. Under the new program the assistance was increased to $1000 per family plus $200 for each dependant in addition to moving costs. The proportion of residents who needed to agree to the move decreased to 90% and later to 80%. A second federal-provincial agreement was started in 1970, with responsibility being shared by the federal Department of Regional Economic Expansion (DREE) and the provincial Department of Community and Social Development. Between 1965 and 1975 some 148 communities were abandoned, involving the relocation of an additional 20,000 people.  Community Relocation Policy (2010s)  State- assisted relocation is still practiced in Newfoundland and Labrador, but the requests must come from the communities themselves. The modern Community Relocation Policy clearly states that the government cannot encourage or \\"initiate any actions\\" to promote resettlement. Essential services, including electricity, are terminated in the communities where the vote reaches a threshold of 90-per-cent. In 2013, the compensation was boosted from $100,000 to $270,000 per household. Despite a community voting in favor, state-assisted relocation has been refused in some settlements where the cost for compensation exceeds the amount saved in services cut. Even if Nippers Harbour voted with a majority of 98%, the government has declared that the consequences to the economy would outweigh the benefits. In art The social change caused by resettlement has appeared in some works of literature and music. The song The Government Game by the Newfoundland writer Al Pittman describes the issue, with lyrics such as \\"It's surely a sad sight, their movin' around,/ A-wishin they still lived by the cod-fishin' ground;/ But there's no goin' back now, there's nothing to gain,/ Now that they've played in the government game.\\" The song Out From St Leonards also describes the resettlement, noting how residents left \\"with their houses in tow\\" by physically shipping buildings to their new homes. The resettlement of an outport community is a focal point of Newfoundland author Michael Crummey's 2014 novel Sweetland. Newfoundland-based photographer April MacDonald has extensively documented the legacy of homes and villages abandoned by resettled Newfoundlanders.

A lobbyist for the East Bay Municipal Utility District said that Stall's editorials helped make the case for the legislation, overcoming opposition from the building industry. After ten years of unsuccessful efforts to pass such a bill, the proposal passed in the legislature and was signed into law by Governor Gray Davis, making California the first state in the Western United States to enact such a law.

Reese was portrayed by Tamara Braun, and Bianca was portrayed by Eden Riegel. On Internet message boards, the pairing is commonly referred to by the portmanteaus \\"Rianca\\" (for Reese and Bianca) and \\"Breese\\" (for Bianca and Reese). The couple debuted in October 2008 and is groundbreaking for featuring the first same-sex marriage proposal, as well as the first legal same-sex wedding and marriage, on an American soap opera. In addition, the pairing's family is the first onscreen family made up of same-sex parents in the history of American daytime television. The couple's wedding took place on February 13, 2009. Though the wedding received praise for being the first on an American soap opera, it also received criticism. The couple's romance was the subject of controversy, from writing and development to fan dissatisfaction and creator commentary. Background =Writing and portrayals= Eden Riegel was cast in 2000 as Bianca Montgomery, the lesbian daughter of Erica Kane. Riegel left the role and returned several times, before permanently retiring from the role in 2010. She attributed her 2008 return to the wishes of her fans. Through the web presence she created for herself during her web series Imaginary Bitches, fans let her know how much they wanted her back on the show. \\"I definitely wanted to fulfill that desire if I could,\\" she said. Riegel then let the show know she was willing to come back. \\"[The] next thing I knew I got a call and they said, 'Okay, we've got something for you,'\\" she said. The story the All My Children writers came up with involved a new love interest for Bianca, Reese Williams, who would be portrayed by daytime alumni Tamara Braun. Riegel addressed specific reasons she made the return. \\"It was the storyline that got me excited,\\" she said. \\"I always want to come back. I love All My Children, and they're my family. I barely need an excuse‚Äîit's usually just about timing.\\" Riegel added that \\"this time it was the fact that they were going to have Bianca in a committed relationship\\". She stated, \\"It was very, very important to me, and I was so glad to hear that. In the context of that, there's some pretty exciting story line plot points that I'm aware of that are dramatic and fun to play and enticing as an actress.\\" In addition, Riegel was enthused about playing opposite Braun. \\"It means so much [that Braun was cast] because it shows how committed AMC is to this pairing,\\" Riegel said in an interview with Soap Opera Weekly. \\"We're going to have some serious stuff to play- they aren't going to waste her talents.\\" After portraying Ava Vitali on the NBC soap opera Days of Our Lives, Tamara Braun did not expect to appear on another daytime drama so soon. \\"I didn't want to do another soap, I was ready to do other things,\\" Braun said in an interview with TV Guide. \\"But this was an opportunity I couldn't pass up.\\" All My Children head writer Charles Pratt, Jr. was creating the role of Reese with Braun in mind when he offered her the role. The story he presented her convinced Braun to take the part. \\"[T]his is a story that's groundbreaking and over due,\\" Braun said. \\"Two female soap characters having a baby together is unprecedented. I wanted to be part of something that could have a strong and positive impact and help give same-sex couples their rightful place in the world of daytime drama.\\" Since coming out as a lesbian, Bianca's romantic entanglements have consisted of sexual confusion, unrequited love, bad timing, and betrayal, including a short-lived romance with Lena Kundera (Olga Sosnovska) and an on-but-mostly-off-screen romantic relationship with Maggie Stone (Elizabeth Hendrickson). The pairing of Reese and Bianca finally allowed the character to be scripted into an on- screen committed relationship. The show had been criticized in the past for not giving Bianca a full-fledged on-screen romance. When asked by The Advocate if she felt Bianca's pairing with Reese, especially by bringing on a recognized name (Braun), would make a difference, Riegel replied, \\"I think there has to be a difference.\\" She responded to the criticism about Bianca's lack of onscreen intimacy with past romantic partners. \\"I don't know if the criticism is entirely warranted,\\" she said. \\"I know I was glad that the show's priority was in giving me good stories, and I thought that they did go further than anyone else had ever gone, so I always thought that they should be commended.\\" Riegel added, however, that she knows the lack of onscreen intimacy between Bianca and the character's past romantic love interests left fans and herself unsatisfied. \\"She never really got to have the kind of relationship that she deserved,\\" stated Riegel. Riegel said of Bianca's return this time, \\"you‚Äôll see a couple of things you haven‚Äôt seen in a while\\". The writers characterized Reese as \\"very warm and real and very expressive with her feelings\\". Her relationship with Bianca is also \\"very\\" affectionate. In the past whenever a kiss was written in for Bianca, significant soap opera press usually focused in on the moment as an event and another kiss usually took a year or longer to happen following the immediate shift of making her romance more physically reserved than heterosexual relationships on the show. The atmosphere was different for Reese and Bianca's relationship. Braun said in an interview with Shewired.com that she would not have been able to portray the character as well back then because Reese is so affectionate. \\"This character is warm and open and for me to play a woman who's in love, it's important for me to be able to express that,\\" she said. \\"Perhaps that's one of the reasons they wanted me to play this.\\" Braun and Riegel have portrayed their characters as in love and committed to each other. Reese was also scripted early on as the love of Bianca's life,Stated on-air on All My Children on October 27, 2008. negating Bianca's previous true love Maggie. When asked how she felt Bianca and Maggie (BAM) fans would respond to the Reese and Bianca pairing, Riegel stated, \\"I'm pretty sure BAM fans will never be entirely satisfied until they have their two favorite girls together forever. But Lizzie's [Elizabeth Hendrickson] been so successful on Y&R; [as Chloe Mitchell ], and is so obviously happy there, I am hoping they are able to embrace this pairing for the time being.\\" =Wardrobe= All My Children's wardrobe director, David R. Zyla, collaborated with Braun in creating the wardrobe for the Reese Williams character. The two had worked together before when Braun portrayed Carly Corinthos on General Hospital. While bringing their ideas together, they tried to make sure they did not make Reese into too much of a clich√©. \\"I like that she goes from really strong pants with a buttoned shirt and tie, which is so on trend but is also just great style, to wearing dresses,\\" Braun said. Reese's wardrobe goes back and forth between the two different types of style which allows Braun and Zyla to play with her fashion. \\"She's an architect, so to me, I would think she has a real eye for lines,\\" said Braun. \\"She appreciates form and beauty, and the look we came up with I would describe as 'streamlined with a flair'.\\" For Reese and Bianca's wedding, the dresses of the brides were chosen to complement each other by featuring \\"a long, lean, Grecian flowy feeling\\". As Bianca, Riegel was dressed in a Monique Lhuillier one shoulder sari-inspired dress with gold beading. Her shoes were gold Aldos. Reese's dress was designed to fit her style as an architect. Her dress was designed by Andrew Gn. It was \\"a fit to flair\\" which featured center beading applique and the shoes she wore were off white. The characters' family, including their daughter Gabrielle, were \\"dressed in the wedding's color palette: deep red.\\" Haley Evans, who portrays the flower girl and Bianca's daughter Miranda Montgomery, wore a red velvet Lucy Sykes dress. Bianca's mother, Erica's red dress was designed by Gustavo Cadile. Storyline Most of Bianca and Reese's relationship takes place offscreen in Paris, where they live with Bianca's daughter Miranda Montgomery. They decide they want to expand their family with another baby. Zach Slater comes to Paris and meets Reese. He agrees to be their sperm donor, and none of them tell Bianca's sister and Zach's wife, Kendall Hart Slater, for fear that she will say no. When Bianca is close to delivering her and Reese's baby, she returns to Pine Valley to tell Kendall. Before she can, a tornado hits and Kendall is injured. After an ambulance takes Kendall to the hospital, Bianca goes into labor and Zach helps her deliver their baby, a girl. Bianca and Zach later find out that Kendall is comatose. Bianca worries for Kendall but also fears how she would react to the news of Zach fathering her second child. Reese comes to Pine Valley not long after the tornado with Miranda. She proposes marriage to Bianca, and Bianca accepts. Reese and Bianca decide to have a commitment ceremony in Pine Valley and to get married later in Paris, since gay marriage is not yet legal in Pennsylvania where Pine Valley is located. Those plans change as they plan to legally marry in Connecticut. They set their wedding date on Valentine's Day. Bianca's cousin, Greenlee Smythe, also plans to marry her former husband, Ryan Lavery, on that same day. The two couples arrange for a double wedding. Bianca finds out that Reese was once engaged to a man and that she is Reese's first lesbian partner. She is hurt Reese did not tell her this. She also becomes increasingly insecure in their relationship as she sees her fiance getting closer with Zach. Bianca decides to test Reese's love for her. She tells Zach and Reese that she will be leaving town, but she secretly stays to spy on them. When Bianca witnesses Zach and Reese in an embrace as Zach gives Reese a kiss to the forehead, she believes Reese is cheating on her and flees. She ends up in a car accident soon afterward, but suffers no serious injuries. Zach and Reese rush to the hospital to see Bianca, and Bianca explains that she saw them embracing. She asks if they are in love. Zach and Reese say no. Despite this, Bianca is furious with Reese and does not want to talk with her. Reese frustratedly leaves the hospital and sends Bianca a note saying she plans to leave. After reading the note, Bianca hurries home to convince Reese to stay; she says that she loves her and knows that she is not romantically interested in Zach. Reese says that she would not have left, regardless. Zach and Reese continue to bond, and Reese and Bianca continue planning their wedding. However, tragedy strikes when Kendall and Bianca's brother, Josh Madden, is killed by Zach after Josh has taken Reese and his family members hostage. Zach is determined to have Josh's heart be donated to Kendall, who needs a heart transplant to save her life. Erica, the siblings' mother, makes the painful decision to take Josh off life support and donate his heart to Kendall. Kendall awakes from her coma days after her transplant. She is told of having been recently comatose, about her heart transplant, that Josh is dead and she has his heart, and of Bianca's engagement to Reese. Kendall is naturally overwhelmed by all the news, but handles it well. When she is told of Zach having fathered Bianca's second child, she seems numb to this news also. Her family had thought she would take this particular news badly, but Kendall seems okay with it. Greenlee (Kendall's best friend) and Erica, however, are the only ones to believe that Kendall is not okay with Zach being the father. Kendall moves back home not long after being awake from her coma. Reese can sense that Kendall is uneasy with her and Bianca living there. She talks with Kendall alone, but it is apparent that Kendall is distant. After their conversation, Reese leaves the room and Zach comes in. Kendall tells Zach that she wants Reese and Bianca out of their home. Zach later obliges Kendall's wishes and sets Reese and Bianca up at his casino to stay. Reese and Bianca get into a fight while there, but later reconcile. The day before Reese and Bianca's wedding, Kendall refuses to attend the ceremony. Zach tries to convince her to change her mind, saying that she is acting childish, but Kendall explains that he and Bianca betrayed her. Bianca receives word that Kendall will not be coming to her wedding and immediately rushes to Kendall's home to insist she attend. Kendall says that she will only come to the wedding as long as Bianca promises to leave for Paris soon afterward and take Reese and baby Gabrielle with her. Bianca reluctantly agrees. Later that night, Reese and Bianca have a wedding rehearsal. Kendall picks up a wine glass and makes a snarky toast to Reese and Bianca but particularly to Reese. Reese becomes upset; she grabs a bottle of wine, a glass, and walks off. Bianca follows her, but Reese wants to be alone. Zach later finds Reese and consoles her. He pulls her into a hug and then kisses her passionately; Reese kisses back. After a few moments, with Ryan having witnessed their kiss, unknown to them, they agree that the kiss never happened and that they already have people they are deeply in love with. Ryan later confronts Zach about the kiss, but Zach says it was nothing and nonchalantly walks away from Ryan. On their wedding day, Reese and Bianca are blissfully happy before the ceremony. Bianca feels that maybe she should stay in Pine Valley. She later tells her mother this and says that she will stay, which Kendall overhears and subsequently decides not to attend the wedding after all. Without Kendall, Reese and Bianca exchange wedding vows on February 12, 2009. Ryan, however, has called off his wedding with Greenlee after seeing Zach and Reese kiss. He tells Greenlee that he knows Zach and Reese have been sleeping together and that he does not want to be married next to them, but promises her that he will give her the wedding of her dreams. Greenlee then tries to get in touch with Zach; she wants to know if he has really been having an affair with Reese. When Greenlee cannot get in touch with Zach, she drives off on her motorcycle in search of him. Also on the road are Zach and Kendall in a car arguing. Kendall ends up in the wrong lane and nearly hits Greenlee. Both try to swerve out of the other's way, leaving Greenlee to drive off the road. When Greenlee's body is not found, she is presumed dead. Reese, Bianca and others soon find out about Greenlee being missing. Ryan tells Bianca that Zach and Reese have been engaging in a sexual relationship with each other. Bianca goes to Reese to tell her that their relationship and marriage is over. She later sends Reese annulment papers, and returns to Paris with Miranda and Gabrielle. On April 24, 2009, Bianca comes back to Pine Valley after having discussed with Zach the reasons she left. After later talking over her and Reese's relationship problems with Zach and Kendall, the couple reconcile and hope that they can work their relationship out. They return to Paris together with their children, and later remarry. In 2010, Bianca returns to Pine Valley for a family emergency, and soon wants to stay. After Reese decides that she is not coming back to Pine Valley, Bianca decides to end their marriage for good and now is single.  Reception and impact  =First same-sex marriage and critical praise= Reese and Bianca are the first same-sex couple to become engaged for marriage on an American soap opera. On October 31, 2008, AfterEllen.com founder Sarah Warn stated, \\"Bianca (Eden Riegel) and Reese's (Tamara Braun) much-anticipated engagement finally took place on ABC's daytime drama All My Children today (the first lesbian marriage proposal on daytime TV), and for once, the AMC writers didn't disappoint.\\" In addition, the couple has been allowed the type of physical intimacy not previously allowed between same-sex couples within the series. Their kiss following the marriage proposal was seen as a change in the show's attitude about portraying homosexual relationships. \\"...They had an actual kiss‚Äîa real one, not a peck on the cheek,\\" stated Warn. She added that the kiss was significant due to romantic kisses, explicit or otherwise, between two women on All My Children or on any daytime drama being rare. Reese and Bianca's wedding on February 13, 2009 marked a first-time event for a daytime drama; the couple exchange vows in the first legal same-sex marriage in American daytime history. (Within the show, the wedding took place on February 12, 2009, Valentine's Day.) Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) president Neil G. Giuliano released a statement in honor of the milestone: In addition, All My Children was nominated for a GLAAD Award in January 2009. The wedding event was featured on CNN on February 16, 2009 following the continuation of the February 13, 2009 episode. The CNN report featured positive and negative thoughts about the wedding. The View discussed the wedding the following day, and relayed that angry letters had been sent to them about the wedding. Regardless of this, they applauded ABC for featuring the ceremony. =Criticism and controversy= Gabrielle Montgomery  In October 2008, with Bianca's return to the series during a series of tornadoes striking fictional town Pine Valley, Bianca was reported to be pregnant with her second child. Fans immediately began speculating on who the sperm donor was, which caught the attention of soap opera press, LGBT press, and other media outlets. TV Guide reported that \\"nobody knows [Bianca's] in town until her brother-in-law finds her under the rubble\\". SOAPnet.com stated, \\"The physical affects [sic] of the tornado are miniscule [sic] compared to the ripples Bianca's presence creates.\\" Another soap opera website sensationalized the story by stating, \\"When Bianca returns to town this time, she will have a brand new 'someone special' in her life and a big surprise‚ÄîBianca is pregnant! And wait until everyone finds out who the 'father' is.\\" Fans, aware that Miranda Montgomery, Bianca's first child, was the result of rapist Michael Cambias, speculated Zach Slater as the child's biological father. Zach was Michael's older brother. Fans theorized that Bianca wanted a baby closely related to Miranda and asked Zach to father the child. If Bianca were already pregnant when she got to Pine Valley, then Zach could have \\"donated\\" last time Bianca was in town, even though the timing within the series did not correlate with this. Another theory concluded Bianca's former love Zarf/Zoe, a pre-op MTF transsexual, as the father; the argument arose over a website putting \\"father\\" in quotations. The \\"father\\" is really a \\"mother\\" trapped in a \\"father's\\" body, the theory entailed. Zach was eventually confirmed as the father of the child by magazine Soap Opera Digest. Bianca's reasons for asking Zach to be the donor and doing so without informing her sister and Zach's wife, Kendall Hart Slater, infuriated viewers. They reasoned that neither Bianca nor Zach would do this to Kendall. After Ellen.com stated, \\"This storyline is all kinds of wrong‚Äîand not just because it makes [the website] feel like [they] need a shower. Bianca and Kendall have a strong, very close relationship.\\" The website could not fathom that Bianca would make \\"a move like this\\" without discussing it with Kendall first. Bianca's reason, however, was that she did not want to give Kendall a chance to say no. Bianca wanting her children closely related was seen by viewers as unneeded, since the children would still be closely related through Bianca. An AfterEllen.com editor relayed, \\"...Bianca wanting a baby closely related to Miranda, whose father was a rapist and whose grandfather was a mass murderer. I‚Äôm no geneticist, but propagating that DNA seems risky at best.\\" The choice for Zach as the father makes Miranda and the new child not only half siblings but cousins as well, which some found \\"icky\\". Reese being introduced as Bianca's love interest was the first time an American soap opera would showcase same- sex partners having decided to create a child together. Riegel set up the Reese and Bianca storyline and what the couple's introduction entailed to newspaper New York Daily News. \\"Zach is looking for Kendall,\\" she said. \\"He is shocked to find Bianca. Nobody knew she was coming to Pine Valley. Zach discovers Kendall's lifeless body and resuscitates her. Paramedics come, but they only have room in the vehicle for one person. Zach convinces them to take the kids, as well. He and Bianca wait.\\" This gave the series a chance to explain Bianca's return to the audience, as they saw Bianca, clearly pregnant, sit beside Zach. \\"Zach agreed to be Bianca's [sperm] donor, but she failed to tell him that the pregnancy took,\\" explained Riegel. \\"The reason she was not forthcoming is that Kendall was not told. Bianca came halfway across the world from France in the Cambias private jet‚Äîthe only jet that can fly into a tornado‚Äîand didn't even get to tell Kendall the truth.\\" The writers detailed Bianca and Zach talking only briefly before Bianca was seen going into labor. Zach delivers the baby, a girl. \\"If there's a giant storm, Bianca will give birth,\\" joked Riegel, referring to how Bianca's first pregnancy (with Miranda) went. Riegel clarified that the baby \\"is actually\\" Reese and Bianca's, while Zach is the sperm donor. \\"After Zach delivers Bianca's baby,\\" she said, \\"Reese tries to get to Pine Valley, but the roads are closed. She and Miranda fly to New York to surprise Bianca.\\" Bianca's second child is soon named Gabrielle Montgomery, with Reese's blessing. Reese and Bianca are the first same-sex partners on an American soap opera to raise a family onscreen. Bianca had previously raised Miranda with character Maggie Stone, but the interaction takes place offscreen. Romance, sexual confusion, and the wedding Viewers of the series noted what they considered \\"the many failings\\" of the Reese and Bianca love story. LGBT viewers were especially vocal about their discontent regarding the storyline. There were complaints that Reese was not \\"sufficiently integrated\\" into the Pine Valley canvas for the audience to invest in her relationship with Bianca, as well as complaints about the budding relationship between Reese and Bianca and their sperm donor Zach. The couple's wedding was heavily criticized. While there were viewers who felt that the wedding ceremony was a \\"joyous and celebratory\\" landmark, others were left feeling that the show missed an opportunity to make the union memorable when it cut to other story points during the wedding as Reese and Bianca exchanged vows. Following Reese and Bianca's arrival to the series as a couple in October 2008, the writers started building a Zach and Reese friendship. To viewers, the friendship soon became somewhat sexual in nature in what they described as Reese \\"giving off a sexual vibe\\" whenever around Zach. This perception was intensified once Reese was revealed by the series to have been engaged to a man just a couple of months before becoming romantically involved with Bianca. Viewers who speculated Reese as bisexual suggested that she may be after Zach. The writers played this angle with ambiguity; they added in hug and kiss \\"teasers\\" such as Zach giving Reese a lingering peck on the cheek/neck. Viewers became frustrated and angered by what seemed to be the writers situating a man into a lesbian love story, as well as Reese seeming to share more screentime and secrets with Zach than Bianca, and a lack of Reese and Bianca truly knowing each other. The audience had experienced sexual confusion storylines before with other former love interests of Bianca's, most notably Maggie, and were hoping that this love story would be without such confusion. At one point, Reese confesses to Zach her ambiguous feelings for him and asks him if he feels the same way for her just as \\"the phone [rings]\\" and \\"[saves] the day\\". When asked by The Advocate in a February 12, 2009 interview about viewer concern among the LGBT community that Reese would leave Bianca for Zach and likely has romantic feelings for him, All My Children executive producer Julie Hanan Carruthers responded, \\"First of all, it's not true. I think what's confused in Reese's head is she has misinterpreted a friendship. Zach is one of the [few] people who have not kicked her to the curb, so to speak, in Pine Valley.\\" Carruthers said that Reese is a confused and insecure person. \\"She has never wavered in her commitment to Bianca,\\" she said. \\"It's solid, Reese has just had a lot of emotional stuff hit. Her family is rejecting and judging her... in both her family and Bianca's.\\" In specific response to viewers being upset at the appearance that Reese was considering leaving Bianca for Zach, Carruthers stated, \\"She is not considering it. That's the audience rewriting what's there. It's not being written that way at all. Reese has never wavered in what she wants.\\" Carruthers acknowledged that Reese leaving Bianca for a man would upset viewers, but that \\"it's never been about that\\". \\"I don't know how to stress this more,\\" she said. \\"Never has she played a moment of, 'I want Zach more than I want Bianca,' or 'I would leave Bianca for Zach.' He has literally just been a friend. Look, we tantalize in this genre. We do it whether we do it with heterosexual or homosexual couples. It‚Äôs what the genre is.\\" Despite Carruthers comments about the Zach and Reese relationship, Reese passionately engages in a kiss with Zach the same day of The Advocate February 12, 2009 interview, the night before Reese and Bianca's wedding. Carruthers explained, \\"The night before the wedding when Kendall, Zach‚Äôs wife, nails her with a backhanded toast, Reese gets a little drunk, and the person who consoles her is Zach.\\" Carruthers described it as a moment where she kisses him and then realizes, \\"Oh, my god, what the heck am I doing? The person I love is Bianca, and the person you love is Kendall. What just happened?\\" That moment, said Carruthers, is what unravels Reese's world and \\"where someone tells somebody and it grows bigger than it ever was\\". In addition to viewers being upset by Reese's actions, AfterEllen.com was frustrated by Reese's ambiguous involvement with Zach and stated, \\"ABC touting the wedding as a 'historic daytime event' just ticks [them] off\\". Carruthers said, \\"[Reese] may not be the poster child to represent the lesbian women in the world. But at the same time, she is very responsible, as are the writers portraying a woman dealing with a crisis and trying to ground herself in her identity.\\" She relayed that though Reese and Bianca would break up due to the Zach and Reese kiss, Bianca would return in the spring to give resolution to the story. \\"The journey Reese has to take to earn Bianca‚Äôs trust again is significant,\\" said Carruthers. On February 16, 2009, in response to the February 12, 2009 interview by The Advocate, television program Soap's Up from Canada's A-Channel criticized Carruthers for insulting the audience's intelligence by saying that the audience had been rewriting the storyline. The program stated that while \\"it is good\\" for All My Children to feature a same- sex wedding, they have not been impressed by the love story and that a show's producer should have more control over the way a character behaves. On February 27, 2009, Warn, who had previously praised the series in her AfterEllen October 31, 2008 column for the portrayal of the couple's onscreen physical affection, criticized the structure and overall writing of the romance. \\"...many queer and straight viewers began heading for the door when it became clear that the kisses and the wedding plans were just new ways to dress up the same old depressing and boring lesbian storylines about sperm donors, custody battles, and sexually confused lesbians,\\" she said. \\"From an entertainment perspective, some of the conflict between Reese and Bianca at the end was interesting, but overall, their storyline became boring and predictable pretty quickly.\\" Warn said that the February 12, 2009 statements by Carruthers regarding Reese insulted the audience's intelligence. The statements were not supported by what the audience saw, she said. \\"There is validity to the argument Carruthers is making‚Äîthat there simply aren't enough romantic-pairing options for long-running lesbian characters unless you're willing to change the general makeup of the established cast of characters,\\" said Warn. \\"This logic is frequently used by TV writers and showrunners to justify minimal lesbian visibility, bad lesbian storylines, and the growing trend towards adding bisexual characters to their shows instead of lesbians.\\" Warn said that while this may be an understandable decision for an individual show, when it is happening on various shows, the viewer is \\"left with a television landscape populated by lesbians who sleep with men, or no lesbians at all, only bisexual characters (who also primarily sleep with men)\\" and that All My Children \\"fed right into\\" this with the Reese and Bianca storyline. On March 23, 2009, The Advocate interviewed Braun about her portrayal of Reese and the Reese and Bianca storyline. \\"From my point of view, Reese is not in love with Zach and she never has been,\\" said Braun. \\"As far as the kiss, any doubt she may have had about her relationship with Bianca dissolved immediately after it happened. It was a moment of needing a connection. It was not about being in love with Zach. She was drunk, upset, and it was unfortunate. It was a terrible mistake. As far as I am concerned, Reese has always been in love with Bianca.\\" Braun said Reese's feelings toward Zach can be summed up as a \\"dear, dear friendship and connection on an intimate but not sexual level\\". She said that Reese has never had a clear point of view. \\"One minute I think I am playing a storyline that is going one way, and then there is a detour. So I have to make it clear in my head. Yes, it‚Äôs not fun playing the outsider who has nobody, and no strong leg to stand on,\\" said Braun. \\"Reese has been under a microscope since she came to town and doesn't have any family to support her. There is no one around who knows the essence of who she really is.\\" Braun clarified that, in some ways, this was \\"not the story\\" [she] came on to play but that it was in other ways. \\"We were getting married, which is why I wanted to do the role,\\" she said. \\"I thought that we were going to show what it‚Äôs like to be a same-sex couple in a loving, committed relationship dealing with what life throws at them and the outside world and how they are treated. There are a lot of story points and ideas I thought we were going to hit upon, but they decided to take it another route.\\" In response to the LGBT community being left \\"very disgruntled\\" with the Reese and Bianca storyline, Braun said, \\"I am sorry they were not happy, because one of my main reasons for taking this role was to be able to give a positive voice to same-sex couples.\\" Braun agreed that \\"the issues\\" went \\"off-point\\" and that she understood why it was difficult for viewers to root for the Reese and Bianca couple. She thanked the viewers who supported the pairing despite the way the romance was told. \\"I was shocked by [the positive feedback] because I know it was not the story they wanted,\\" she said, \\"but they were so happy to be represented on TV and on a soap.\\" =\\"Blame\\" and fan retaliation= On April 13, 2009, Charles Pratt, Jr., head writer of the series, was interviewed by TV Guide about the Reese and Bianca relationship. After saying he felt he had longer to tell the love story and that it could have been better told if not for Riegel temporarily departing as Bianca, Pratt was viewed by fans and critics as blaming Riegel for the failure of the storyline. \\"I was led to believe we had her for longer than we really did‚Äîsuddenly I got word that Eden is leaving now,\\" stated Pratt. \\"We got to play everything we wanted to with Bianca and Reese but not in the time we'd hoped for‚Äîin my mind, it was a two-year story. I guess I could have rushed to the wedding earlier so that they‚Äôd have had more time together as a married couple and then had them break up, but I think the fans would have been even more unsatisfied with that.\\" Despite earlier comments by Carruthers that \\"Reese never wavered in her commitment to Bianca\\" and was not bisexual, Pratt admitted that they were considering on \\"turning\\" Reese bisexual. \\"...if Tamara decided to stay, keeping her on the show as an angry lesbian‚Äîwith no other lesbian characters on the canvas‚Äîwould be kind of insane,\\" said Pratt. \\"So we thought about making Reese bisexual‚Äîkind of an Anne Heche who bounces back and forth‚Äîand maybe make her an opportunistic black widow, a real bad girl. And Tamara would have been really great at that. But, ultimately, we decided to stick with the message.\\" Pratt's comments to TV Guide about Riegel and the storyline angered viewers and critics, who felt Pratt was being dishonest about not knowing how long Riegel was signed on for and did not admit to what they consider the true flaws of the love story. They reasoned that it was known from the beginning, to even fans of the series, that Riegel had only signed on for a four-month contract to portray the Reese and Bianca storyline and that her four-month contract should not mean that the story could not have been better written. In early 2009, Riegel briefly exited the show to focus her attention on pilot season. She had said that if the story was well written, she would extend her contract. She ultimately declined extending, but agreed to return to \\"tie up\\" the Reese and Bianca storyline for a spring 2009 \\"happy\\" ending. Fans \\"retaliated\\" against Pratt's comments about Riegel and the storyline. Two fans created an animated online series called Pratt Falls to \\"skewer\\" the show's executives about the love story. In Season 1, Episode 1 of the parody, viewed on YouTube, a fictional Carruthers has to tell Pratt that there are \\"fans\\" who become emotionally invested in the show. The fictional Pratt asks, \\"Who are Bianca and Reese?\\" and \\"We have lesbians on our show?\\" The series, described as tongue-in-cheek, concludes its first episode with the animated Pratt announcing that he has devised a plan to blame the failed storyline on Riegel as he urges Carruthers to call TV Guide to arrange an interview.

Also in 1963 he wrote for American Opinion, the magazine of the right-wing John Birch Society, accusing African leaders of embracing socialism as \\"abundance without necessitating the earning of it\\". Lucier was a Senate staff member for 25 years. After working for South Carolina Southern Democrat and later Republican Senator Strom Thurmond, he joined the staff of North Carolina Republican Senator Jesse Helms, initially as coordinator of domestic legislative policy, then as chief legislative aide for foreign affairs. He became minority staff director for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when Helms became its ranking minority member in February 1987. A leader of the hard-line faction among Republican staffers, he was relieved of his position in a general shake-up by Helms in 1992, being replaced by James \\"Bud\\" Nance, a retired admiral and friend of Helms'. In 1972, Lucier established Capitol Information Services, for which he worked part-time at the beginning of his employment with Helms; in 1986 the Charlotte Observer raised questions about the ethics of a Senate aide running such a business. While working for Helms, he and another aide to Helms, John Carbaugh, were criticized for profiting from private foundations they had set up with Helms, and were accused of meddling in foreign policy on Helms' behalf, particularly when both attended and attempted to influence the Lancaster House talks between Britain and Rhodesia. He subsequently became senior editor of the news weekly Insight, and has also served as chairman of the advisory commission for the Thomas Balch Library and a member of the board of the James Monroe Museum and Senior Fellow of the Monroe Foundation. In 2006 he was appointed head of the Program on the Middle East and the Iran Information Center at the Institute on Religion and Public Policy. Publications In 2001 he published The Political Writings of James Monroe, one of a series on presidential writings commissioned by the publisher. For his work on the book, he was appointed one of six scholars in the Congressional Reading Room at the Library of Congress.

It depicts the family of a controversial lawyer in New York after a stroke renders him comatose.

The motto of the book--\\"The challenge of modernity is to live without illusions and without becoming disillusioned\\"--is a quotation from Antonio Gramsci.

And the second tactic: whatever made your last book famous, don't do it with the new one.\\"  Plot summary  At a party in 1962, 18-year-old typist Audrey Howard meets Joel Litvinoff, an American lawyer involved with the civil rights movement. Although Joel is fourteen years older, Audrey is impressed when Joel puts her pompous date in his place. In turn, Joel is intrigued by Audrey's aloofness. Joel later finds Audrey's number in a telephone book and insists on accompanying Audrey to visit her dreary, rural parents the next day. Audrey and Joel spend the night together, and Joel half-seriously suggests that Audrey marry him and follow him to the United States. Bored with her unstimulating life in Britain, Audrey takes him up on his offer. Forty years later, Joel and Audrey live together in Greenwich Village. Joel is now famous, successful, and controversial for his radical legal activism. Audrey has become a fiery, antagonistic woman who finds fault in all things and defends her husband's causes with zealous conviction. Joel and Audrey have three adult children living elsewhere in New York City. Lenny,Whitneyer.com/2009/books/family-romance A Family Romance] (HTML). The New York Observer. The New York Observer, LLC. Retrieved on 2009-03-12 the eldest, was adopted at age seven as part of Joel's belief in collective, \\"tribal\\" child-rearing. Lenny's parents were eco-terrorists, with their last campaign killing his biological father and landing his biological mother in jail. Since then, Joel has grown frustrated with Lenny's addiction issues and repeated petty crimes, while Audrey dotes on Lenny and constantly excuses his delinquency. Karla, the middle child, is a hospital social worker. Karla struggles with low self-esteem after years of demeaning treatment from her family about her weight and intelligence. Karla is unhappily married to Mike, a union organizer, who desperately wants children. Rosa, the youngest, chaperones an after-school program for underprivileged girls. Once a firm socialist, Rosa tried to join the socialist revolution in Cuba but returned disillusioned after four years of witnessing Fidel Castro's oppression. However, by the time she is introduced, Rosa has had a positive experience in a synagogue and discovered an interest in Orthodox Judaism. While defending an Arab American man against terrorism charges in the wake of the September 11 attacks, Joel has a stroke and enters a coma. At the hospital, Audrey lashes out at the doctors, causing a fight with Rosa that ends with Audrey kicking Rosa from the hospital. Audrey's long-suffering confidant, Jean, tries to help distract her by taking her to activist social functions, but Audrey is offended at the activists' lack of concern for Joel and preoccupation with public figures. Audrey receives a letter from a woman named Berenice Mason, who claims to be Joel's lover and the mother of his illegitimate child. Audrey dismisses the claim. Rosa spends a weekend with an Orthodox rabbi's family in Monsey. Rosa is at first put off by the family's insularity, but is intrigued by the rabbi's willingness to discuss his faith rationally with her. Later, Rosa witnesses a girl's mother strike her child during a parent-teacher conference, and confides in her fellow chaperone Raphael that she believes they cannot help the girls escape their lower-class neighbourhoods. Karla attempts to help her melancholic neighbour, Ms. Mee, write a letter against Ms. Mee's employer, who is taking all her tips. At work, Karla is saved from an aggressive patient by Khaled, the man who runs the newspaper stand outside the hospital. Karla is surprised by Khaled's genuine kindness, enjoyment of simple pleasures, and lack of concern for politics and appearances - so unlike her parents. Berenice confronts Audrey at her home, but Audrey sends her away in anger. After Joel's former staff and Jean confront her with proof that Berenice is telling the truth, she agrees to meet with Berenice. Jean warns her to wait until she is ready, but Audrey presses ahead, and the meeting goes poorly. Andrey angrily refuses Berenice's request for their children to have a relationship. Halfway through her tirade, she realizes everyone in the room is afraid of her and loses her energy. She agrees to pay Joel's child support in his stead on the condition that Berenice immediately leave and avoid further contact with her or her three children. Afterwards, Jean watches Audrey cry for the first time. The Litvinoff family gathers for Audrey's birthday. Mike argues with Audrey over his union's decision to support a Republican governor, and both of them mock Rosa for entertaining Orthodox faith. Lenny's girlfriend Tanya obliviously tries to join the conversation as Audrey mocks her too. Lenny goes to the bathroom, but stays inside so long that Rosa becomes concerned. The family knocks down the bathroom door to find him in a drug- induced stupor. Audrey and Tanya treat the overdose as an excusable mistake, horrifying Rosa and causing her to leave. Rosa attends lessons on religion at her local Jewish community centre. The experience makes her feel conflicted. She instinctively dislikes the blind obedience of the Orthodox women and their insistence that her skepticism towards misogynistic religious rules is something to be overcome, but also wonders if her skepticism is human weakness holding her back from supernatural truth. Rosa also realizes that her international, upper-class upbringing has alienated her from the sensibilities and concerns of average suburban Americans, like her roommate. Rosa feels guilty for looking down on \\"normal\\" girls, at least until she finds her roommate cheating on her fiance with Lenny. Back at work, Rosa vetoes a dance routine at the after-school program for being too explicit, and Raphael and the girls make fun of her prudishness and suggest it is because she is Jewish. Audrey takes Lenny to visit his biological mother, Susan, in prison. She is jealous of Lenny's natural love for Susan, especially since she finds Susan unrefined. Audrey despairs that Lenny does not return her love so freely. Jean encourages Audrey to cut Lenny off unless he takes serious action to deal with his addiction issues. Jean even suggests that she take Lenny with her to work on a farm by her vacation home in another state. Audrey refuses at first, but eventually agrees with Jean. Lenny at first reacts angrily, but when Audrey stands her ground, he gives in. Mike decides that he and Karla have tried for children naturally long enough, and moves to adopt. During the pre-adoption courses, Karla is embarrassed at her inability to express sincere desire for children, whereas Mike's answers flow readily. Meanwhile, she continues to spend time with Khaled at work, and their relationship evolves into a sexual affair. Karla questions how Khaled can care nothing for politics despite the systemic injustices against Arabs in America and the important accomplishments of past activists. Khaled replies that America is better than the Middle East and that politics are boring and pointless. Karla decides what they are doing is wrong and ends the affair. Audrey visits Joel with Karla and Rosa. She is approached by Joel's doctors, who inform her that now would be the appropriate time to turn off Joel's life-sustaining equipment. Audrey is furious and does not give her consent, accusing the doctors of opportunism and malpractice. At the same time she realizes her hypocrisy, as she and Joel had mutually agreed to pull the plug if one of them became unable care for themselves and scorned the pro-life lobby. Berenice accidentally visits at the same time and Audrey causes a scene. Rosa attends excursions to various Jewish sites with her classmates, but when a classmate suggests that Rosa's hesitations are rooted in being uncomfortable with her womanhood, Rosa becomes angry and disavows the religion lessons. She sets up a one-night stand with a college acquaintance, Chris, to prove to herself that she is done with Orthodox rules. Afterwards, she decides that she still feels a connection to Orthodox Judaism, and decides to continue visiting Monsey. When the after-school program girls perform the dance she vetoed at a public event, Rosa leaves without congratulating them. When Raphael confronts her, she repeats that their work is futile and she cannot stand to watch the girls meet their class destiny. Raphael angrily tells her that the girls deserve better than someone who sees them as lost causes, and Rosa realizes that he is correct and takes steps to quit. When Audrey visits Lenny in the countryside, he is doing well. He has positive relationships with his Alcoholic Anonymous sponsor, works hard on the farm, and has cut ties with Tanya and his addict friends in New York City. Audrey reacts skeptically and sourly, but Jean bluntly tells her that Audrey must be afraid Lenny will leave her if he does not have to depend on her. Audrey confides in Jean that she believes Joel never loved her. Audrey acknowledges out loud for the first time that she accepted continuous infidelity from Joel, but she can tell Joel saw Berenice as more than a sexual fling, and that he loved Berenice in a way that he had never loved her. Rosa and Karla decide to visit Berenice. Berenice tells the girls that Joel got her the apartment illegally through connections. She shows them photographs of her genitals and books on the occult, and asks them to have a relationship with their half- sibling even if it has to be kept secret from Audrey. Rosa expresses anger to Karla after they leave, upset that Berenice would ask them to conspire against their mother. Rosa also condemns their father for giving Berenice love that was meant for them, and for compromising his principles for a kooky artist. Karla, however, personally understands that Joel would have had less energy to love his children had he limited himself to an unsatisfying marriage. She reflects on the perpetual unhappiness of her neighbour Ms. Mee, and wonders if she and Mike will also come to define their lives by mundane unhappiness. Rosa takes the after-school program girls on one last excursion to a rally held by [Susan Sarandon] against the Iraq War. Audrey and Jean show up to assist her. While Jean fetches candies and souvenirs for the girls, Rosa speaks with her mother about Judaism. She tells Audrey that she now supports the right of the Israeli state to defend itself, to Audrey's disgust. Rosa asks Audrey what she would do if the truth struck her undeniably and inexplicably, even if she could not make sense of it and it contradicted everything she was raised to believe. Audrey bitterly replies that this would never happen, and if it did she would reject it. Eventually, Joel contracts an infection. The doctors tell the family that they need to come urgently. Mike is upset because the infection came on the same day as the election campaign he had run for his union, and he wanted to see the results. Karla is disturbed that Mike seems to view Joel's passing as both an irritation and an exciting source of drama. At the hospital, Audrey, Lenny, Karla, Mike, Rosa, and Joel's mother visit him for the last time. Joel's mother gives him a brief and definitive goodbye, then asks to leave. Mike focuses on the election results until his candidate is declared the winner, then shows a tabloid article to Audrey about rumors regarding an affair by Joel. Karla sternly asks her husband to leave, to his displeasure. Rosa reflects on all the times she chastised her father for compromising his values for small comforts, and regrets that she wasted time trying to call out his hypocrisy instead of enjoying his company. In the hallway, Audrey surprises Karla by telling her that she does not have to stay with Mike if she is unhappy. Joel dies while they are speaking. The children silently join Audrey as she weeps over Joel's corpse, then leave one by one to let Audrey be with their father. Joel's funeral is held in a cathedral almost immediately after his death. Audrey's sister and brother-in-law accompany Jean to the ceremony. They are struck by the wide variety of mourners in the crowd. Audrey delivers a eulogy from the pulpit. She speaks of Joel as a principled defender of civil rights and social progress. To everyone's surprise, she unexpectedly calls Berenice to join her from among the crowd of mourners, along with Berenice's son Jamil. Audrey declares that Berenice and Jamil are a testament to Joel's commitment to collective tribal child-rearing and expanded families, and that she sees them as family too. She also announces a new scholarship for progressive causes in Joel's name. After the funeral, Jean approaches Audrey in shock, but Audrey rebuffs her questions. Jean realizes that Audrey gone back to coldly hiding her feelings to safeguard Joel's legacy as a man of principle. Lenny attends the funeral reception with Tanya, apparently having relapsed. Rosa tells her mother of her plans to go to Jerusalem, and to study the Torah at a yeshiva. Mike looks for Karla, but cannot find her at the reception. Across town, Karla boards a subway and texts Khaled to let him know she will join him soon.  Reviews  The Believers was published to almost unanimously positive reviews.

It was created from Alirajpur, Jobat and Bhabra tehsils of the former Jhabua district on 17 May 2008. It is the least literate district in India as per Census 2011. Alirajpur is the administrative headquarters of the district. The district occupies an area of , and at the 2011 census had a population of 728,999. It includes the city of Alirajpur. Origin of name The district is named after its headquarters, Alirajpur, which was the capital of the former princely state of Ali Rajpur. The name of this town is derived by conjoining Ali (the fortress town and the former capital of the princely state founded by Anand Deo in 1437) and Rajpur (the latter capital). According to the 2011 census Alirajpur district has a population of 728,677, roughly equal to the nation of Bhutan or the US state of Alaska. This gives it a ranking of 498th in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of 229 inhabitants per square kilometre (590/sq mi). Its population growth rate over the decade 2001‚Äì2011 was 19.4 per cent. Alirajpur has a sex ratio of 1,009 females for every 1,000 males, and a literacy rate of 37.22 per cent, the lowest in India. History The district was carved from erstwhile Jhabua district on May 17, 2008. The District is named after its headquarter Alirajpur which was capital of the former princely state of Alirajpur. The territory is hilly and many of the inhabitants are Bhil‚Äùs. Being tribal dominated community Alirajpur area was being ruled by tribal kings in 15th century. Amanod Dev the descendant of Rana Rathore Naresh of Jodhpur killed Jamora Dodiya Bhil and his army and took the area in his possession. The area is bounded by the pond in Dahod in north, Shivrajpur in Gujarat in west, Narmada river in south and Dholgarh in east. Anand Dev was very fond of hunting .One day Anand Dev entered in the forest of Ali which was ruled by Alia Bhil at that time. The king saw a rabbit there which came running towards and disappeared. The king felt that it should be a magical place as well as pleasant also. The king built a fort there in 1438 and the fort was named Anandawali. Alia Bhil was killed in the battle and Anand Dev became the sole king of the state. After this Anand Dev shifted his capital motipol to Ali and was named Anandawali. King Anand Dev gave Fulmal village to his younger brother, Inderdev in 1440 and declared him the Prime Minister . After this he distributed the territory among his brother. After king Anand Dev his son Chalchal Dev became the king of the territory. Guogole Dev and Keshav Dev were his two sons. On the murder of his father Guogole Dev became the king in 1470. On the other hand, his younger brother Keshav Dev captured Jobat area while his father was survive in 1465. Krishan Dev the son of Guogole Dev died childless and his nephew Bachharaj became the king. He had four sons. Deepsen was his eldest son. Surat Dev was son of Deepsen and extended the Ali state on the large scale .He had four sons. After the death of Surat Dev his eldest son, Pahar Singh became the king. Due to circumstances created, his brother Pratap Dev did not like to live with Surat Dev and hide himself near Maheshwar. When Ahilyuabai holkar found it that Prata Dev was brother of the king of Ali, she send him back. After returning to Ali, Pratap Dev planned and captured the territory and declared himself the king of Ali in 1765. King Pratap Dev was married to Shishodiya princess of Dharampuri of Gujarat. During 1797 Mushafir Makrani real name Dur Mohammed khan came to Ali territory with his friends. He became a servant of state. Mushafir makrani proved a loyal servant of the state lifelong. He protected the state so many times from outsiders. In 1800 the capital of Ali was transferred to Rajpur. After the death of Maharaj Pratap Dev, Maharani Pratap Kuwarbai gave birth to a boy, named Jasvant Singh. Jasvant Singh ruled the territory up to 1861. After his death his son Gang Dev became the king and ruled from 1861 to 1871 in Alirajpur State. After his death his brother Roopdev ruled the state from 1871 to 1881. Roopdev had no issue. Therefore, Vijay Singh son of Chandra Singh from Sondwa Thakur faimly was brought to Alirajpur and nominated as the King. He ruled Alirajpur state in 1890 and he also had no issue. Again Pratap Singh second son of Bhagwan Singh was brought from Sondwa and he became king of Alirajpur. Pratap Singh II was born on 12 Sept 1881 and he was made king on 10 June 1891. After he turned adult a first class magistrate power was given to him and the complete power was delegated to him to rule on 27 January 1904. Maharaj Pratap Singh married queen Rajkuwarbai daughter of Bahadur Singh Jadav. Prince Fateh Singh was born in 1961 from the eldest queen Maharaja Pratap Fateh Singh and was educated in Daly College Indore and Raj Kumar college Rajkot. Prince Fateh Singh was married to the princess Rajetukuwarbai on 7 May 1922. Prince Fateh Singh had six children. 10 Out of these three were princes and three prince. Maharaja Pratap Singh had built big and beautiful grounds presently used as collectorate office, guest houses, Pratap Bhawan Hospital and schools. King Pratap Singh had very good terms with the British Govt. He was honored by K.C.I. rank for his bravery on 3 June 1915. After this on 1st January, 1921 the British Govt. honored him with the title of his Highness forever. The population of Alirajpur at that time was about five thousand. The roads were very broad and the houses were very airy and beautiful. His Highness Shri Pratap Singh was very fearless and kind hearted king. He punished the dacoits with hard punishment. The population of Alirajpur territory was about 12 thousand out of these 569 were Christian religion follower. Most of the Christians were converted from Bhil caste. According to British rules a state forces was formed on 1 February 1924 that was called Pratap infantry. There were Gorkhe and Army Band. Many play ground were developed during ruling period of his Highness Maharaj Shri Pratap Singh. A big cricket field (At present Fateh Club Maidan) and Polo ground was famous in the country. Thus Maharaja Pratap Singh II ruled Alirajpur successfully up to 1948 (up to freedom) for 57 years. After his death his grandson Surendra Singh son of Maharaj Fateh Singh was made the king. After this Alirajpur State was merged into Indian Union but his Highness Sri Surendra Singhji was always know as the name of Bapji. Maharaj Surendra Singh ji was a highly educated personality and he passed I.C.S. Examination. He rendered his services as an Indian embassy under Indian Foreign Services. He had family relation with the former Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru and Smt. Indra Gandhi. After retirement Maharaj Surendra Singh engaged himself in the social services actively. After the freedom in 1947, Alirajpur territory was absorbed into Indian Union. After that this area became a part of Madhya Bharat Administrate. After constitution of Madhya Pradesh on 1 November 1956 Alirajpur came into Jhabua district. Although demand of a separate district for Alirajpur was raised but Jhabua was in between petlawad and Thandla Tahsils on one side and between Jobat and Alirajpur on the other side. Therefore, Jhabua was declared as a district headquarter. Since then Alirajpr was division headquarter having three big black development offices Alirajpur, Sondwa and Kattiwara respectively. Out of these Sondwa and Kattiwara Tappa were tahil headquarter. Simultaneously a demand of separate district for Alirajpur was being raised regularly The villages Vakhatgarh, Mathwar Kakrana etc. were connected with Narmada river in the interior. Public representative, public and political parties were also demanding of separate district for Alirajpur time to time. During Assembly elections 2003, Uma Bharti promised to make Alirajpur as a separate district. Since then the demand of district for Alirajpur was raised strongly. Due to the pressure of regional public, organizations and Chief Minister Shri Shivraj Singh Chauhan declared Alirajpur a separate district on 17 May 2008 and thus a new administrative unit, Alirajpur was formed. Before the Indian independence in 1947, the Alirajpur State was under Bhopawar Agency sub-division of the Central India Agency. This principality was founded in 1437 and merged with the Indian Union after the Indian independence. The territory occupied by the present district became part of Madhya Bharat state in 1948 and subsequently became part of the re- organized Madhya Pradesh state on 1 November 1956. Divisions This district comprises three tehsils: Alirajpur, Jobat and Bhabra. Presently, there are two Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha constituencies in this district: Alirajpur and Jobat. Both of these are part of Ratlam Lok Sabha constituency.

The main varieties of Portuguese spoken in South America are Brazilian Portuguese (spoken by the vast majority), Uruguayan Portuguese and a mixed variety known as Portu√±ol/Portunhol. Geographic distribution Portuguese control of South America in 1754. (Green) Brazil is the largest country in which Portuguese is spoken in all of the Americas, with a population of approximately 200 million people, almost all of whom are native speakers of Portuguese. The size of this population renders Portuguese an important regional and world language. Research in regional and social variation in the Brazilian dialects of Portuguese, known together as Brazilian Portuguese, reveals the diversity of this language. The country also received settlers from Portugal and white settlers from former Portuguese African colonies, Eurasian settlers from Macau and East Timor. Argentina was the first Spanish-speaking member state of Mercosur to participate in the Frontier schools project. It involves the exchange of language teachers with Brazil. Secondary schools are now required to offer Portuguese as a foreign language. The same goes for primary schools in provinces bordering Brazil.http://www.misionesonline.net/paginas/detalle2.php?db=noticias2007&id;=128150 Uruguay, born out of conflict first between the Spanish and Portuguese empires and then Brazil and Argentina, has Portuguese speakers in northern region. The acronym DPU (Dialectos Portugueses del Uruguay) is used to describe the varieties of Portuguese spoken in this region. DPU is not standardized and so Brazilian Portuguese serves as the primary model for Uruguayan speakers of Portuguese, native and non-native speakers alike. Instruction in Portuguese has now been increased in the Uruguayan education system. In the northern departments bordering Brazil, education has become bilingual combining Spanish and Portuguese as languages of instruction. Paraguay has been receiving waves of Brazilian immigrants for decades, known as Brasiguaios. Unlike in Uruguay, the Brasigaios are a result of more recent immigration and, as such, are more markedly Brazilian in speech and cultural identity. These immigrants tend to settle in the eastern regions of the country and most originate from the Brazilian state of Paran√°. Estimates of the size of this community range from 200,000 to 500,000. Venezuela has a large and prominent Portuguese immigrant community, one of the largest in The North of South America. Its membership in MERCOSUR is pending and, towards that end, the Venezuelan government has begun to encourage the teaching of Portuguese as a second language. Portuguese is to be made available in the public school system. The importance of Brazilian Portuguese In South America, Brazilian Portuguese is the standard form of Portuguese for learners and non-native speakers. P.l.e. (Portugu√™s como l√≠ngua estrangeira) is the acronym used to describe the learning and instruction of Portuguese as a second or foreign language; a term comparable to ESL. Brazil's growing international profile and the adoption of Portuguese as an official language of Mercosur have created a demand for non-native fluency in Portuguese in the Hispanic member states. This has accompanied a growth in the private language instruction in Portuguese in said countries. The Museum of the Portuguese language (the second language museum in the world) is located in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. The Brazilian Ministry of education has developed a proficiency test in Portuguese specifically for Brazil and based on the Brazilian norm: CELPE-Bras The latest orthographic agreement was ratified first by Brazil and while it requires adjustments in spelling, hyphenation and accentuation from all CPLP member states, the agreement favours the Brazilian norm. Media and popular culture Portuguese-speaking communities in South America outside of Brazil form the primary audience for Brazilian and Portuguese satellite television in their respective countries. Such programming be it football matches, telenovelas or variety shows allow lusophones outside of Brazil to access media and cultural content in Portuguese and stay informed and connected to events in Brazil. Rede Globo and RTPi are available throughout all of the Americas.

The Mizpah and the nearby Belvada Building, both five stories high, shared the title of tallest building in Nevada until 1927. The hotel was named after the Mizpah Mine and was the social hub of Tonopah. The hotel was pre-dated by the Mizpah Saloon, which opened in 1907, and was the first permanent structure in Tonopah. The hotel was financed by George Wingfield, George S. Nixon, Cal Brougher and Bob Govan and designed by George E. Holesworth of Reno, Nevada (other sources state that the architect was Morrill J. Curtis). Brougher in particular was involved with the Belmont, Tonopah, Midway and Tonopah Mining Company and the Tonopah Divide Mining Company. Brougher owned the Tonopah Banking Corporation, which had an office in the lobby of the 1905 building, and was a director of the Bank of Italy in San Francisco. The reinforced concrete hotel was faced with stone on the front and brick on the sides and rear. The neighboring three-story Brougher-Govan Block, with rooms on the upper floors, served as the first Mizpah and remains connected. Cast iron columns were used in the windows and fire escapes. The three and five story buildings are joined with a wood stairway crowned with a skylight. Steam heat was provided, along with the first elevator in Tonopah. According to legend, Wyatt Earp kept the saloon, Jack Dempsey was a bouncer, and Howard Hughes married Jean Peters at the Mizpah. But Wyatt Earp left Tonopah before the Mizpah was built, Hughes was married in Tonopah, but not at the Mizpah, and Dempsey asserted he was never a bouncer. The hotel nevertheless features the Jack Dempsey Room and the Wyatt Earp Bar. The hotel is said to house a ghost deemed the Lady in Red by hotel guests who have experienced her presence. Legend says that the Lady in Red is the ghost of a prostitute who was beaten and murdered on the fifth floor of the hotel by a jealous ex-boyfriend. Another widely accepted description of the events is that The Lady in Red had been caught cheating by her husband at the hotel after he had missed a train, who then proceeded to kill her in a jealous rage. The Lady in Red haunting of the Mizpah was featured in season 5, episode 2 of Ghost Adventures on the Travel Channel. The hotel had been shuttered since 1999, but in early 2011, the hotel was purchased by Fred and Nancy Cline of Cline Cellars, Sonoma, California, who renovated and reopened the building to the public in August 2011. The newly renovated hotel has 47 rooms, a bar, and two restaurants; The Pittman Cafe and the Jack Dempsey Room. There are plans to renovate further rooms in the hotel annex and to add a small casino to the property.

Site The original six buildings occupy a downtown block facing the Halifax waterfront bounded by Upper Water Street, Duke Street, Hollis Street and the Cogswell Interchange. Along with the adjacent waterfront buildings of Historic Properties and the Victorian commercial buildings of the Granville Mall, the site is one of the only intact blocks of 19th-century buildings in Downtown Halifax.

The proposed development has split municipal politicians in Halifax. Those opposed, such as the Heritage Trust of Nova Scotia, say that Halifax is losing its small and dwindling number of heritage buildings which are a resource for culture and tourism.

The heritage buildings on the block were saved from demolition in the 1970s when heritage advocates stropped a planned Harbourfront expressway promoted by city traffic engineers and developers which would have demolished all older buildings on the waterfront. The move was seen as key to reviving the Halifax waterfront and Halifax's downtown tourism.\\"Exploring Nova Scotia Architecture I\\" Nova Scotia Association of Architects, Halifax: Formac Publishing, page 2. Heritage proponents have argued that the pending demolition underscores Halifax's weak heritage laws.

War Bug was built as the wooden-hulled motorboat Herreshoff 320 at Bristol, Rhode Island, in 1917 by the Herreshoff Manufacturing Company for a private owner, and probably was designed with possible naval service in mind. The U.S. Navy purchased Herreshoff 320 from Felix Warburg of New York City on 6 November 1917 for use as a patrol vessel in World War I. Armed and designated SP-1795, she was commissioned as USS War Bug on 17 November 1917. War Bug was assigned to the 1st Naval District and served in waters near Boston, Massachusetts, through the end of World War I. Due to an urgent need for craft such as War Bug at Brest, France, an order dated 14 October 1918 went out from Washington, D.C., to Boston directing the Commandant of the 1st Naval District to ready six section patrol boats -- USS Commodore (SP-1425), USS Cossack (SP-695), War Bug, USS Sea Hawk (SP-2365), USS Kangaroo (SP-1284), and USS SP-729‚Äîto be shipped to France as deck cargo along with spare parts to keep them operational. However, this proposed movement appears to have been cancelled, probably because of the armistice with Germany of 11 November 1918 that ended World War I and eliminated the need for more U.S. Navy patrol craft in Europe. Decommissioned on 28 December 1918, War Bug was sold on 30 June 1919 to E. Atkins and Co., of Boston.

He was drafted by the New England Patriots in the third round of the 2009 NFL Draft. He played college football at North Carolina. Early years and family Tate attended Hugh M. Cummings High School in Burlington, North Carolina, where he played football as a wide receiver, kick returner, and defensive back and basketball as a guard. In basketball, he won a state title in his junior season. In his 2004 senior football season, Tate had 66 receptions and 18 touchdowns, earning All-Conference honors. Tate's brother, Barry, was a four-year letterwinner for Lenoir-Rhyne University in football.http://lrbears.athleticsite.net/2012L-RFootballRecords.pdf Page 22. Retrieved December 10, 2012 College career After high school, Tate attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Tate was one of seven true freshman to see game time. Tate played in all eleven games as a kick returner. In the Tar Heels game against the Utah Utes, Tate returned the opening kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown. Tate finished the season with 21 kick returns for 542 yards, and 29 punt returns for 267 yards. Tate finished 22nd in the country in kick off returns. In his freshman season, Tate finished second in the Atlantic Coast Conference in kick returns and third in punt returns. In his sophomore season, Tate was one of only three players in the country to return two kickoffs for touchdowns. Brandon Tate caught his first pass from Cameron Sexton, in the Tar Heels game against the Virginia Tech Hokies. The pass was for 13 yards, with the catch happening just before the end of the first half. In the Tar Heels' game against Notre Dame, Tate returned a kick off 90 yards for a touchdown. Tate faked a pitch to teammate Quinton Person, and bolted down the field into the end zone. In the final game of the Tar Heels season, against Duke, Tate performed very well. With seventeen seconds remaining in the first half of the game, Tate returned a kick off 97 yards for a touchdown. That 97 yard return tied third longest return in North Carolina's history. Early in the fourth quarter, Tate returned a punt 54 yards for a touchdown. Tate became the third person in North Carolina football history and the ninth player in NCAA history to return a kickoff and a punt for a touchdown in the same game. Tate caught his first pass, a 17-yard reception, from Cameron Sexton. In the opening game of Tate's junior season against James Madison, he caught his first touchdown pass of his career. Tate caught a 28-yard pass for his first catch of the season, as well as his first touchdown of his career. When North Carolina squared off against East Carolina, Tate returned a punt 58 yards for a touchdown. This was Tate's fifth career return for a touchdown, which tied the school record; which was held by Charlie Justice. In North Carolina's game against NC State, Brandon Tate recorded 168 all-purpose yards. He caught a 50-yard touchdown pass from Bobby Rome, a fullback, off of a flea flicker. In the Tar Heels' games against Wake Forest and Miami, Tate had over 200 all-purpose yards. In the Heels' game against Miami, Tate scored a 54-yard rushing touchdown off of a reverse. Tate set the ACC records for most all-purpose yards (2,382 yards) and most kick off returns (98) during his junior season. Tate saw more time at wide receiver in his junior season in 2007. Tate finished the season first in the ACC with 1,765 all-purpose yards; he also led his team with seven touchdowns. Tate caught 25 passes for 479 yards, averaging 19.2 yards per catch. In addition to that, Tate caught five touchdown passes. Tate averaged 24.1 for kick off returns and 9.4 yards for punt Tate during a game with North Carolina in 2008. In Tate's senior year, the Tar Heels were pitted against the McNeese State for their opening game of the collegiate football season. Tate dominated the game. In the first quarter of the game, Tate returned a punt 82 yards for a touchdown. Shortly after the start of the second quarter, Tate rushed 54 yards, being tackled just three yards shy of the end zone. In the third quarter of the game, Tate caught a 57-yard pass from T. J. Yates and ran for a touchdown. Tate ended up rushing for 106 yards, becoming the first North Carolina wide receiver to have a hundred-yard rushing game. Tate set a school record for most all-purpose yards in a game with 397 yards on just eleven touches. Tate also set the school record for highest punt return average in a game, with 47.3 yards per return (3 returns for 142 yards). In the Tar Heels' game against Miami, Tate set the NCAA record for most combined kick off and punt return yards in a career, he finished the season with 3,523 yards to his name. Before the Tar Heels' game against Notre Dame, Tate needed only 165 yards to become the eleventh player in NCAA history to reach 1,000 kick off return yards and 1,000 punt return yards. Tate returned a single punt for 9 yards, before leaving the game with a knee injury. Tate ended up tearing his ACL and MCL in his knee and missed the final seven games of the season. Tate also the ACC's all-time leader in kickoff returns (109) and kickoff return yardage (2,688).

Intelligent verification uses information derived from the design and specification(s) to expose bugs in and between hardware IPs. Intelligent verification tools require considerably less engineering effort and user guidance to achieve verification results that meet or exceed the standard approach of writing a testbench program. The first generation of intelligent verification tools optimized one part of the verification process known as Regression testing with a feature called automated coverage feedback. With automated coverage feedback, the test description is automatically adjusted to target design functionality that has not been previously verified (or \\"covered\\") by other tests existing tests. A key property of automated coverage feedback is that, given the same test environment, the software will automatically change the tests to improve functional design coverage in response to changes in the design. Newer intelligent verification tools are able to derive the essential functions one would expect of a testbench (stimulus, coverage, and checking) from a single, compact, high-level model. Using a single model that represents and resembles the original specification greatly reduces the chance of human error in the testbench development process that can lead to both missed bugs and false failures. Other properties of intelligent verification may include: * Providing verification results on or above par with a testbench program but driven by a compact high-level model * Applicability to all levels of simulation to decrease reliance on testbench programs * Eliminating opportunities for programming errors and divergent interpretations of the specification, esp. between IP and SoC teams * Providing direction as to why certain coverage points were not detected. * Automatically tracking paths through design structure to coverage points, to create new tests. * Ensuring that various aspects of the design are only verified once in the same test sets. * Scaling the test automatically for different hardware and software configurations of a system. * Support for different verification methodologies like constrained random, directed, graph-based, use-case based in the same tool. \\"Intelligent Verification\\" uses existing logic simulation testbenches, and automatically targets and maximizes the following types of design coverage: * Code coverage * Branch coverage * Expression coverage * Functional coverage * Assertion coverage History Achieving confidence that a design is functionally correct continues to become more difficult. To counter these problems, in the late 1980s fast logic simulators and specialized hardware description languages such as Verilog and VHDL became popular. In the 1990s, constrained random simulation methodologies emerged using hardware verification languages such as Vera\\"Leveraging Design Insight for Intelligent Verification Methodologies\\", Embedded, June 2008. and e, as well as SystemVerilog (in 2002), to further improve verification quality and time. Intelligent verification approaches supplement constrained random simulation methodologies, which bases test generation on external input rather than design structure.\\"Constrained random test struggles to live up to promises\\" SCDSource, March 2008. Intelligent verification is intended to automatically utilize design knowledge during simulation, which has become increasingly important over the last decade due to increased design size and complexity, and a separation between the engineering team that created a design and the team verifying its correct operation. There has been substantial research into the intelligent verification area, and commercial tools that leverage this technique are just beginning to emerge.

Open in 2007, PTS was set up to deliver the IC Internationalised Curriculum that was developed in Southeast Asia using the leading subject-by-subject curricula from around the world, but delivered largely in the Thai language following the requirements of the Thai National Curriculum. The curriculum imposes a fully structured and mandatory English and Chinese language learning programme commencing at kindergarten. Praht Thai School is for students from nursery (2 year-olds) through to kindergarten 1 (3 year-olds); primary school (Years 1-6) and is designed to include grades 7‚Äì12 in the school. Praht Thai School is the first school in Thailand to be known as a \\"Thai International School\\". Curriculum The model of trilingual education applied at Praht Thai is known as the Praht Thai Internationalised Curriculum (PTIC). Students are taught four key subjects (mathematics, science, language arts, and social studies). Instruction is delivered with an emphasis on Thai language and cultural understanding. The infusion of the world's leading curricula from countries such as Singapore (mathematics and Chinese), the UK, the US, and Australia (social studies, science, and language arts). Praht Thai students learn (particularly in the early years) in the mother tongue (Thai) to ensure that the best level of education can be delivered without the confusion and curriculum constraints created by the so- called immersion models. Praht Thai does not believe in nor follow any form of immersion programmes as used in many bilingual or English programme schools. In common with the better international schools, Praht Thai provides international learning and understanding for students in a form that can be easily absorbed through the enhanced Praht Thai Internationalised Curriculum. The Thai, English and Chinese lessons are taught by different teachers. Praht Thai is a language-oriented school with a focus on advanced academics and personal development. Thai-medium lessons adhere to the standards set by curriculum developers from as far afield as Singapore, Australia, and Great Britain. Internationalised curriculum and equivalency Praht Thai Schools have adopted a benchmark standard called \\"equivalency\\". Through curriculum implementation and comparative analysis against major global curricula, the equivalency standard seeks to deliver a position for students whereby upon completion of schooling at a Praht Thai School, students are expected to be equally able to pursue higher education in Thai-language or English-language institutions in Thailand or abroad. As the curriculum is based on leading subject area programmes from around the world, the curriculum becomes by default a globally equivalent standard at the highest level. By drawing on these recognised curricula IC has set an equivalency standard that will allow students the opportunity to be studying on par with the best in any subject area anywhere in the world at each age and grade level. (An example of this is the absorption of the latest Singapore MOE Mathematics curriculum into the mostly Thai-language Praht Thai Maths curriculum. Singapore's math curriculum is recognised in the past three TIMMS studies (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study conducted every four years since 1995) - ( see Timms link below)).  Language  Praht Thai is a trilingual school that has its base firmly in the native Thai language. Praht Thai teaches two other languages, English and Chinese. The English and Chinese language lessons provide complete language learning is delivered in a model designed to teach the language as well as enhance the subject matter learning encountered in the Thai delivered curriculum spectrum. This differs from the immersion models of schools where subjects are taught in English and students therefore are targeted to assume the ability of the English language in the process. Attainment of academic and linguistic trilingualism is a strong focus of Praht Thai School system. The IC Curriculum takes the position that because of the great language distance between Thai and English, learning core subjects at a high level should be done in the mother tongue. IC highlights the importance of a strong language-learning focus in any non-Thai delivered components of the education process. The language system used in Praht Thai follows the British genre of English curricula with input from the developments of language instruction dating as far back as the 1970s combined with modern linguistic learning technologies. Much of the course design also reflects European language training methodologies which have been used successfully throughout Europe for decades. The education program Praht Thai has a focus in three areas: -Academic excellence (core subjects at the highest level) -Language skills (Thai, English, and Chinese) -Personal development (Sports and creative thinking) Learning methodologies From kindergarten to Year 6, PTS applies a number of learning-based techniques and philosophies. These incorporate many aspects found in areas such as: *-Brain Based Learning *-Multiple Intelligences *-E-Learning *-Experiential Learning *-Activities Learning *-Montessori Techniques Throughout, the school utilises regular activities designed to discover and express students' different intelligences, strengths, and talents.  Administration and staff  The school is managed by Mrs. Sumattaya Leenachunangkool with the assistance of the School Director, Mr. Aldo M Roberto and a team of Thai Directors supported by a foreign administration team. The team includes a growing academic staff comprising Thai and foreign teachers from Britain and Australia. All teachers are duly qualified teachers in their home countries with certified teaching qualifications.

He was commissioned to do work by the wealthy of the nineteenth century. He did a marble bust of John Plankinton, an astute businessman who founded the meat industry in Wisconsin and was \\"Milwaukee's foremost citizen.\\" Park did a sculptor of George Washington as Milwaukee's first piece of public art. He made a bronze monument statue of the 21st Vice President of the United States. He did a sculpture of Milwaukee's first white settler and first mayor. He also created sculptures for the Chicago World's Fair of 1893.  Life and career  Park was born February 17, 1838, in Hebron, Connecticut.U.S. passport issued April 4, 1872 He was inspired by a Hiram Powers exhibition to become a sculptor. From 1855, Park worked in the Albany, New York studio of Erastus Dow Palmer, the foremost neoclassical sculptor of his time, starting out as a marble cutter's apprentice making marble copies of Palmer's work. He stayed until 1861, working as an assistant to Palmer alongside other future sculptors Launt Thompson and Charles Calverley. He moved to New York city to establish an independent career before moving to Florence, Italy around 1871. Park's early work was in marble, later changing to the medium of bronze for natural sculptures, in line with the American trend for late nineteenth century sculptures. During his time in Florence, Park was commissioned to prepare a marble bust of John Plankinton, an astute businessman who founded the meat industry in Wisconsin and was respected as \\"Milwaukee's foremost citizen\\". Plankinton was known for religious convictions, his success from a modest upbringing, and for his regular philanthropic public deeds; he became known as \\"A Merchant Prince and Princely Merchant\\". Plankinton's daughter, Elizabeth, travelled to Europe in 1879, and met Park in Florence. On return to Milwaukee, Elizabeth convinced her father to let her commission Park to sculpt the first piece of public art for Milwaukee, a monument to George Washington. Park worked on the monument to Washington in Florence, and it was completed and shipped to Milwaukee for its dedication in November 1885; Elizabeth donated it to the city of Milwaukee as a philanthropic gesture. At some point, Park and Elizabeth Plankinton became engaged, and in 1886 John Plankinton commenced construction on a mansion to be a wedding gift for his only daughter. On 18 September 1887, Park married another woman,Record #175 in marriages in the county of Ottawa, Michigan a dancer from Minneapolis, shortly after his Juneau Monument (in recognition of Milwaukee's first Mayor, Solomon Juneau) was dedicated. When Elizabeth learned of Park's marriage, she left on a long trip to Europe. On her return, she took her only look at the mansion her father had built, and is said never to have set foot in it again. Statue of John Plankinton in The Grand's Plankinton Arcade Park made an over-life-size bronze monument statue as a tribute to the 21st Vice President of the United States, Thomas A. Hendricks. It was unveiled in 1890 on the grounds at the Indiana State House in Indianapolis. After this he moved his studio to Chicago to get commissions in the sculptural programs for the Chicago World's Fair of 1893. He met Lee Lawrie in Chicago and Lawrie went on to work as Park's apprentice and assistant (1891-1894). One of the monuments they worked on was an over- life-size all silver monument statue for the state of Montana titled Justice that was exhibited in the Mines and Mining Building. It was rumoured to have been melted down later for the silver. There is an 1893 medal showing the model that posed for the statue on its reverse side. It has been suggested that Park's most enduring legacy may be his role as mentor and teacher to Lawrie. Remarkably, given his history with the family, Park spent six months in Chicago working on a statue of John Plankinton following his 1891 death, commissioned by William Plankinton, Elizabeth's brother. Described as a \\"handsome bronze statue\\", it was unveiled on 29 June 1892 and \\"viewed by hundreds of people, the great majority of whom pronounced it one of the most lifelike statues of Uncle John Plankinton possible to be executed.\\" It stood in the Plankinton House Hotel until the location was redeveloped in 1915 into a shopping district, Plankinton Arcade, which incorporated a rotunda in which the statue was placed. The statue underwent several months of restoration work in 2012, before returning to its place in the rotunda that is now a part of The Grand shopping plaza. One of the bronze statues Park made for the Fair was of Benjamin Franklin and it was three years later reinstalled at Lincoln Park in downtown Chicago. An 1895 review of the public monuments in Milwaukee listed five existing pieces, two sculpted by Park. He is best known for his Actor's Monument to Edgar Allan Poe (1884) in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York city, and the Drake Fountain in Chicago (1892). Author and art historian Lauritta Dimmick records that Park died in 1902 in Battle Creek, Michigan, although there are others who believe he died in New York City. Dimmick's view is confirmed by his obituary in the Chicago Tribune dated November 8, 1902, which states he died \\"at the \\"Battle Creek sanitarium.\\"  Works by Park  Washington Monument Milwaukee's Court of Honor = Washington monument, 1885 = Motivated by her love for Milwaukee, Elizabeth Plankinton commissioned Park to prepare a monument to George Washington as Milwaukee's first piece of public art, at a cost of around $20,000 (equivalent to $,000 in ). It was unveiled and dedicated in November 1885. Washington is portrayed in uniform as the 43-year- old commander-in-chief of the Continental Army, and stands tall on a granite base. The bronze figures of a mother and child at the base of the monument were included at the request of Plankinton. With substantial immigration to Milwaukee occurring, Plankiton wanted a child being shown the father of the United States portrayed to symbolise the importance of history. As one speaker at the dedication put it, \\"during the coming generations when other men shall walk these streets, this monument will stand a text for the old and a lesson for the young.\\" The monument was described in 1895 in The Monumental News as \\"classical to the verge of conventionality.\\" The statue was moved to Illinois in mid-2016 for restoration work due to ongoing corrosion. In line with a report prepared for the Westown Association in 2014, restorer Andrzej Dajnowski discovered major cracking in one of the legs and that the sculpture's sword might not be the original. The restoration cost around $100,000, $60,000 of which came from the Westown Association, and the restored monument was returned to Milwaukee in January 2018. The monument now was a dark bronze color rather than the previous green and Mayor Tom Barrett watched as it was craned back into place and observed that \\"our first piece of public art is in pristine condition.\\" Juneau Monument, view of Lake Michigan = Juneau Monument, 1887 = Solomon Juneau was a key figure in the early history of Milwaukee, having been the area's first white settler and the first Mayor of the city. Park's Juneau Monument is the most prominent object in the Milwaukee park built in Juneau's honour, where it stands on a bluff overlooking Lake Michigan. The monument cost around $25,000 (equivalent to $,000 in ) and was gifted to the city by Charles T. Bradley and William H. Metcalf on behalf of their shoe company. It was unveiled on 6 July 1887, and was described by the Milwaukee Sentinel newspaper as \\"a credit to the artist and the city, as well as a monument to the public spirit of the donors.\\" The bronze statue is over-life-sized, standing tall above a base of red granite, and depicts Juneau \\"clothed in the habit of the pioneer\\" and carrying a rifle. Two sides of the pedestal feature bronze bas-relief scenes from Juneau's life while the other two sides feature inscriptions. Strong similarities have been noted between the sculpture's visage and that of Park's Washington statue. Accentuating this similarity is the relief scene of Juneau's inauguration as Mayor - described as perhaps the monument's best feature - where a bust of Washington is placed behind the Mayor's chair.

Colored golds can be classified in three groups: * Alloys with silver and copper in various proportions, producing white, yellow, green and red golds. These are typically malleable alloys. * Intermetallic compounds, producing blue and purple golds, as well as other colors. These are typically brittle, but can be used as gems and inlays. * Surface treatments, such as oxide layers. Pure 100% (in practice, 99.9% or better) gold is 24 karat by definition, so all colored golds are less pure than this, commonly 18K (75%), 14K (58.5%), 10K (41.6%), or 9K (37.5%). Alloys =White gold= Rhodium- plated white gold wedding ring White gold is an alloy of gold and at least one white metal (usually nickel, silver, or palladium). Like yellow gold, the purity of white gold is given in karats. White gold's properties vary depending on the metals used and their proportions. As a result, white gold alloys can be used for many different purposes; while a nickel alloy is hard and strong, and, therefore, good for rings and pins, gold‚Äìpalladium alloys are soft, pliable, and good for white gold gemstone settings, sometimes with other metals, like copper, silver, and platinum, added for weight and durability (although this often requires specialized goldsmiths). The term white gold is used very loosely in the industry to describe karat gold alloys with a whitish hue. It is a common misconception that the color of the rhodium plating, which is seen on many commercial pieces, is actually the color of white gold. The term \\"white\\" covers a large spectrum of colors that borders or overlaps pale yellow, tinted brown, and even very pale rose. The jewelry industry often conceals these off-white colors by rhodium plating. A common white gold formulation consists of 90 wt.% gold and 10 wt.% nickel. Copper can be added to increase malleability. The strength of gold‚Äìnickel‚Äìcopper alloys is caused by formation of two phases, a gold-rich Au‚ÄìCu, and a nickel-rich Ni‚ÄìCu, and the resulting hardening of the material. The alloys used in the jewelry industry are gold‚Äìpalladium‚Äìsilver and gold‚Äìnickel‚Äìcopper‚Äìzinc. Palladium and nickel act as primary bleaching agents for gold; zinc acts as a secondary bleaching agent to attenuate the color of copper. The nickel used in some white gold alloys can cause an allergic reaction when worn over long periods (also notably on some wristwatch casings).White Gold ‚Äì Site provided by the World Gold Council This reaction, typically a minor skin rash from nickel dermatitis, occurs in about one out of eight people; because of this, many countries do not use nickel in their white gold formulations. Gold is rarely pure gold, even before another metal is added to make a white gold alloy, and often contains a mercury alloy from its production, which can cause an allergic reaction. =Yellow gold= Examples of the common alloys for 18K yellow gold include: * 18K yellow gold: 75% gold, 12.5% copper, 12.5% silver * 18K yellow (darker) gold: 75% gold, 15% copper, 10% silver =Rose, red, and pink gold= Rose gold diamond engagement ring Rose gold is a gold‚Äìcopper alloy widely used for specialized jewelry. Rose gold, also known as pink gold and red gold, was popular in Russia at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and was also known as Russian gold, although this term is now obsolete. Rose gold jewelry is becoming more popular in the 21st century, and is commonly used for wedding rings, bracelets, and other jewelry. Although the names are often used interchangeably, the difference between red, rose, and pink gold is the copper content: the higher the copper content, the stronger the red coloration. Pink gold uses the least copper, followed by rose gold, with red gold having the highest copper content. Examples of the common alloys for 18K rose gold, 18K red gold, 18K pink gold, and 12K red gold include: * 18K red gold: 75% gold, 25% copper * 18K rose gold: 75% gold, 22.25% copper, 2.75% silver * 18K pink gold: 75% gold, 20% copper, 5% silver * 12K red gold: 50% gold and 50% copper Up to 15% zinc can be added to copper-rich alloys to change their color to reddish yellow or dark yellow. 14K red gold, often found in the Middle East, contains 41.67% copper. The highest karat version of rose gold, also known as crown gold, is 22 karat. During ancient times, due to impurities in the smelting process, gold frequently turned a reddish color. This is why many Greco-Roman texts, and even many texts from the Middle Ages, describe gold as \\"red\\". =Spangold= Some gold-copper‚Äìaluminium alloys form a fine surface texture at heat treatment, yielding an interesting spangling effect. At cooling, they undergo a quasi-martensitic transformation from body- centered cubic to body-centered tetragonal phase; the transformation does not depend on the cooling rate. A polished object is heated in hot oil to 150‚Äì200 ¬∞C for 10 minutes then cooled below 20 ¬∞C, forming a sparkly surface covered with tiny facets. The alloy of 76% gold, 19% copper, and 5% aluminium yields a yellow color; the alloy of 76% gold, 18% copper and 6% aluminium is pink. =Green gold= Green gold was known to the Lydians as long ago as 860 BC under the name electrum, a naturally occurring alloy of silver and gold.Emsley, John (2003) Nature's building blocks: an A‚ÄìZ guide to the elements. Oxford University Press. . p. 168 It actually appears as greenish- yellow rather than green. Fired enamels adhere better to these alloys than to pure gold. Cadmium can also be added to gold alloys to create a green color, but there are health concerns regarding its use, as cadmium is highly toxic. The alloy of 75% gold, 15% silver, 6% copper, and 4% cadmium yields a dark- green alloy. =Grey gold= Grey gold alloys are usually made from gold and palladium. A cheaper alternative which does not use palladium is made by adding silver, manganese, and copper to the gold in specific ratios.Ribault, Laurent and LeMarchand, Annie (June 10, 2003). \\"For manufacturing jewels by the disposable wax casting technique; does not cause allergies\\" Intermetallic All the AuX2 intermetallics have the fluorite (CaF2) crystal structure, and, therefore, are brittle. Deviation from the stoichiometry results in loss of color. Slightly nonstoichiometric compositions are used, however, to achieve a fine-grained two- or three-phase microstructure with reduced brittleness. Another way of reducing brittleness is to add a small amount of palladium, copper, or silver. The intermetallic compounds tend to have poor corrosion resistance. The less noble elements are leached to the environment, and a gold-rich surface layer is formed. Direct contact of blue and purple gold elements with skin should be avoided as exposure to sweat may result in metal leaching and discoloration of the metal surface. =Purple gold= Gold‚Äìaluminium phase diagram Purple gold (also called amethyst gold and violet gold) is an alloy of gold and aluminium rich in gold‚Äìaluminium intermetallic (AuAl2). Gold content in AuAl2 is around 79% and can therefore be referred to as 18 karat gold. Purple gold is more brittle than other gold alloys (a serious fault when it forms in electronics\\"Purple plague\\" . International Electrotechnical Commission Glossary), as it is an intermetallic compound instead of a malleable alloy, and a sharp blow may cause it to shatter. It is therefore usually machined and faceted to be used as a \\"gem\\" in conventional jewelry rather than by itself. At a lower content of gold, the material is composed of the intermetallic and an aluminium-rich solid solution phase. At a higher content of gold, the gold-richer intermetallic AuAl forms; the purple color is preserved to about 15% of aluminium. At 88% of gold the material is composed of AuAl and changes color. The actual composition of AuAl2 is closer to Al11Au6 as the sublattice is incompletely occupied. =Blue gold= Blue gold is an alloy of gold and either gallium or indium. Gold‚Äìindium contains 46% gold (about 11 karat) and 54% indium, forming an intermetallic compound AuIn2. While several sources remark this intermetallic to have \\"a clear blue color\\", in fact the effect is slight: AuIn2 has CIE LAB color coordinates of 79, ‚àí3.7, ‚àí4.2 which appears roughly as a greyish color. With gallium, gold forms an intermetallic AuGa2 (58.5% Au, 14ct) which has slighter bluish hue. The melting point of AuIn2 is 541 ¬∞C, for AuGa2 it is 492 ¬∞C. AuIn2 is less brittle than AuGa2, which itself is less brittle than AuAl2. A surface plating of blue gold on karat gold or sterling silver can be achieved by a gold plating of the surface, followed by indium plating, with layer thickness matching the 1:2 atomic ratio. A heat treatment then causes interdiffusion of the metals and formation of the required intermetallic compound. Surface treatments =Black gold= Black gold is a type of gold used in jewelry. Black-colored gold can be produced by various methods: *Patination by applying sulfur- and oxygen-containing compounds. *Plasma- assisted chemical vapor deposition process involving amorphous carbon *Controlled oxidation of gold containing chromium or cobalt (e.g. 75% gold, 25% cobalt). A range of colors from brown to black can be achieved on copper- rich alloys by treatment with potassium sulfide. Cobalt-containing alloys, e.g. 75% gold with 25% cobalt, form a black oxide layer with heat treatment at 700‚Äì950 ¬∞C. Copper, iron and titanium can be also used for such effect. Gold‚Äìcobalt‚Äìchromium alloy (75% gold, 15% cobalt, 10% chromium) yields a surface oxide that is olive-tinted because of the chromium(III) oxide content, is about five times thinner than Au‚ÄìCo and has significantly better wear resistance. The gold‚Äìcobalt alloy consists of gold-rich (about 94% Au) and cobalt-rich (about 90% Co) phases; the cobalt-rich phase grains are capable of oxide-layer formation on their surface. More recently, black gold can be formed by creating nanostructures on the surface. A femtosecond laser pulse deforms the surface of the metal, creating an immensely increased surface area which absorbs virtually all the light that falls on it, thus rendering it deep black, but this method is used in high technology applications rather than for appearance in jewelry. The blackness is due to the excitation of localized surface plasmons which creates strong absorption in a broad range in plasmon resonance. The broadness of the plasmon resonance, and absorption wavelength range, depends on the interaction between different gold nanoparticles. =Blue gold= Oxide layers can also be used to obtain blue gold from an alloy of 75% gold, 24.4% iron, and 0.6% nickel; the layer forms on heat treatment in air between 450‚Äì600 ¬∞C. A rich sapphire blue colored gold of 20‚Äì23K can also be obtained by alloying with ruthenium, rhodium and three other elements and heat-treating at 1800 ¬∞C, to form the 3‚Äì6 micrometers thick colored surface oxide layer.

Ausubel's research demonstrated the technique was particularly effective if the reader had little prior knowledge of the subject material. Drawbacks of theme statements in proposals Theme statement in proposals must be carefully constructed. If the assumed customer benefit in the theme statement is not perceived as a benefit to the customer, then credibility is lost. If the theme statement introduces a benefit, but the following discussion does not directly support that benefit, then more credibility is lost. Finally, in concert with Ausubel's findings, theme statements should not be used to introduce sections in a proposal customers already know well. The chances of seeming patronizing or disingenuous are too high.

Previously their drummer, contributing very occasional vocals, Collins was now the band's lead singer, while continuing to play drums and percussion. The video, directed by Bruce Gowers, features the band gathered around an upright piano, with the front panels removed, performing the song. Special effects make Collins, in miniature size, appear to walk and dance inside the piano, as well as on Steve Hackett's guitar. The video concludes with all four of the band miniaturized on the piano keyboard. In a 1994 interview with VH1 for the \\"Phil Collins One on One\\" episode, Collins called the video the most embarrassing and cringe- worthy of his entire career.

The majority of the song was written in 1972 and was originally intended for the Foxtrot album. The song's rhythm, according to Banks, is partly influenced by The Beatles' \\"Getting Better.\\"loudersound.com: Genesis: the miracle of A Trick Of The Tail and life without Peter Gabriel The lyrics are inspired by the 1955 novel The Inheritors by British author William Golding.

He is captured and put on display in a freak show after his captors refuse to believe in his kingdom. The Beast laments his decision to leave his home, describing it as a paradise covered in gold.

He is best known for his contributions to the study and decipherment of the Maya script, the writing system used by the pre-Columbian Maya civilisation of Mesoamerica. As one of the leading epigraphers active in contemporary Mayanist research, Martin has specialised in the study of the political interactions and dynastic histories of Classic-era Maya polities. Since 2003 Martin has held positions at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology where he is currently an Associate Curator and Keeper in the American Section, while teaching select courses as an Adjunct Associate Professor in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania. Early life and career Simon Martin entered the field of Mayanist research with a professional background in graphic design. He attended the Royal College of Art in London during the 1980s, completing his Master's in Communication Arts in 1987.Inomata & Houston (2001, p.279); West (2004) As a professional designer he worked in televisual media into the mid-1990s, for production companies designing visual elements and programmed content for TV, film and commercials.West (2004) Martin had been fascinated by the Maya civilisation since childhood. After a period spent in independent study and research, in the late 1980s Martin began attending Mesoamericanist conferences and Maya hieroglyphics workshops. In parallel with his work in the design profession Martin corresponded with scholars active in Maya research, and travelled to Central America to visit some of the Maya archaeological sites. His reading proficiency and knowledge of Maya inscriptions was soon recognised in the field, and by the mid-1990s Martin was operating as an honorary research fellow at UCL's Institute of Archaeology.Apenzeller (1994, p.733); Inomata & Houston (2001, p.279) He gained his doctorate at the same institution in 2014. Martin secured a residential fellowship grant from Washington D.C.'s Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection in pre- Columbian studies for the 1996/97 academic year. The fellowship allowed Martin to later move into Mayanist research as his full-time profession. In 2003 Martin took up a position as the research specialist in Maya epigraphy at the University of Pennsylvania's Penn Museum, from where he has continued to conduct field reconnaissances to the Maya lowlands, write research papers and act as scholarly consultant for several museum exhibitions of Maya art and artefacts.See West (2004) for record of interview with Martin on his work at Penn Museum. See also his entry at: He co-curated the \\"Maya 2012: Lords of Time\\" in 2012 at Penn Museum, and in 2019 completed the full re-installtion of its Mexico and Central America Gallery. For the academic year 2019-2020 he was awarded the Jay I. Kislak Chair for the Study of the History and Cultures of the Early Americas at the Library of Congress. In 2020 he published the book Ancient Maya Politics: A Political Anthropology of the Classic Period 150-900 CE (Cambridge University Press), an extended re-analysis of the political data in the inscriptions and proposals for the underlying mechanisms at work. Research In the early 1990s Martin was at the forefront of epigraphic research that would challenge some prevailing views on the nature of Maya lowland states and their political interactions during the Mid- to Late- Classic period.Appenzeller (1994, p.733) Archaeologists and epigraphers had generally conceived the Maya lowlands region of this era as a mosaic of dozens of polities or city-states, each controlling only a small surrounding territory and acting more or less independently of the others. These states were engaged in alternating episodes of warfare and alliance with one another, but such interactions had been assessed as primarily local and transient in nature. However, evidence for the hierarchical ranking of kings overturned this concept and replaced it with a model in which a few dominant kingdoms exercised control over others in wide-ranging and enduring elite networks.

He is the only known mobster who asked for a mercy killing after becoming terminally ill with lung cancer. The proposition was agreed upon but Paruta died before the mercy killing was performed. Biography Paruta was born in Bensonhurst on December 3, 1929 to first-generation emigrants from Venice, Italy of a Luccan family from Tuscany. He was the oldest of three children, who grew up in poverty. Paruta was originally an associate who served in the crew of Gambino crime family capo Salvatore Aurello. He served in the Gambino crime family under the tutelage of Carlo Gambino and later Paul Castellano. Sammy Gravano later said, \\"Everybody called Joe the 'Old Man'. He was only about fifteen years older than me (Gravano was born on March 12, 1945) but he already had white hair and looked kind of decrepit. He was tough and loyal. Old Man Paruta would kill for me as quick as he would get me a cup of coffee. Over the years, there was nothing I couldn't ask of him.\\" His capo Sammy Gravano would later say that \\"he was like my own personal Luca Brasi,\\" in reference to the contract killer character from The Godfather. Following puberty he started noticeably suffering from premature aging which made appear several decades older. He was a short man in stature with thin arms and legs with a thick torso. By middle age he started to lose his telltale white hair as the Werner's syndrome worsened. He had a hoarse voice and his skin started to thicken and suffer from cataracts. He suffered from smoker's cough that was brought on by his years of smoking cigarettes. He was married to an Italian-American woman named Dorothea, who he nicknamed \\"Dottie\\" and had several children. He was a family man who would regularly take his family out to dinner at Tali's restaurant every week and have a large dinner. Frank DeCicco later told Gravano an amusing anecdote about a robbery that Paruta, himself and several other criminal associates had arranged to pull off. He stated, > It seems in his early days, Frank (DeCicco) was going on a robbery with some > guys. And for this particular score, they needed a lockpicker. Someone told > Frank that Paruta was just the person they were looking for. Frank was > surprised. He said to Paruta, \\"Why haven't I heard this before about you?\\" > Old Man Paruta just smiled in response and said there wasn't a better lock > guy around than him. So they're in the place and Frankie nods at Paruta, who > steps forward and what he does is, he kicks in the door. \\"See, what did I > tell you?\\" Paruta said. Frank was stunned. He couldn't stop laughing. And if > that ain't enough, Paruta holds out for his end of the loot. His reasoning > is that they never would have got inside the place without his talents. So > you know a guy like that is all right. He had a mild mannered nature and never demonstrated anger towards his fellow associates. After the murder of Frank Fiala by Sammy Gravano, Edward Garofalo, Thomas Carbonaro, Michael DeBatt and Nicholas Mormando, they assembled at his saloon, Doc's.

To me, Joe never seemed to change. He always looked the > same, old and decrepit, always chain-smoking.... The old man had his little > gambling and shylock operations and he had a piece of Tali's. He was > satisfied. He never asked for anything more. Premature aging It is suspected that Joseph suffered from Werner syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder that is characterized by the appearance of premature aging. By 1959, at the age of thirty Joseph had the telltale condition of the syndrome by having a \\"birdlike\\" facial appearance. This made him stand out among the mob associates in Gravano's crew and made him the target of teasing due to his elderly appearance. Other signs that Paruta displayed was cancer and heart disease. It is unknown if Paruta was ever diagnosed with having the condition. Cancer After the DiB (Rober DiBernardo) hit, his smoker's cough got worse and worse. Whatever doctor he was going to told him he should see a specialist, it could be serious\\". Sammy made arrangements through some doctors he knew and checked him into the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center at 1275 York Avenue in Manhattan, New York for testing. The prognosis was that he had terminal lung cancer that had spread through the rest of his body. The doctors gave him only a year left to live. The chief doctor later confided to Sammy Gravano that he had lied to Paruta's family and that he only had three months to live. Gravano felt that he had to honor his friend. Even after being diagnosed with terminal cancer he did not stop smoking even when staying at the cancer centre. Initiation into Gambino crime family His dying wish was that he become initiated into the Gambino crime family and die a made man. Sammy sent word to John Gotti through his brother Gene for permission to fulfill his last wishes and make his dream of becoming a \\"made man\\" true. Gravano personally conducted the ceremony in his room at the cancer centre. When it came time for him to prick his finger for the blood to mix with the holy card, Sammy could hardly get a drop. He was now reduced to a living skeleton. The death of Joseph D'Angelo By 1982, Paruta was starting to act depressed over the murder of his friend Joseph D'Angelo who had been shot to death over a bar room dispute with an associate of the Colombo crime family. Sammy Gravano became concerned of his friend's mental well being. He lost interest in gambling and stopped visiting the horse races at the Aqueduct racetrack in the afternoon like he always had done. He told Gravano when asked about his depression, \\"Stymie ain't here no more. I'll be with you at your side until the day I die.\\" Loyalty to the Dellacroce faction and Gravano On December 2, 1985 Aniello Dellacroce died. Sammy Gravano stated, \\"Even before this, we decided we had to split up and go underground. If there was a leak, somebody had to survive and keep playing. Frankie (Frank DeCicco) said him and me would move into Joe Watts' basement. Joe and his wife and kids would stay upstairs. John (John Gotti) and Angie (Angelo Ruggiero) could do what they wanted. I told Debbie I had to leave for a while, maybe for weeks, maybe for months, years. Don't ask. I don't know how long. Nobody in my crew knows anything, except Old Man Paruta. We stayed in contact with John and Angie using certain phone numbers. Plot to murder Castellano and Bilotti After the Roy DeMeo trial started, Thomas Bilotti was known to pick up Paul Castellano and drive him to a restaurant where they sat in a table near the back and discussed business before heading to court in Manhattan. Both Paul and Thomas did not know who Paruta was. Gravano and Watts planned to have Paruta walk into the restaurant and go right past them into the men's washroom. In there, someone would plant a ski mask. He would put the ski mask on and come out with two guns. They would be sitting there eating and discussing their trial when Paruta would just run out shooting. The rest of them would be outside, inside, surrounding the vicinity of the restaurant supporting him with backup. Later Frank DeCicco reported that Paul Castellano had sent him a message to be at a meeting at Spark's Restaurant in Manhattan. It was here that the actual execution would later be orchestrated and carried out. Paruta would not be chosen as one of the shooters in this planning of the murder of Castellano and Bilotti. Standing up for Sammy Gravano After a violent encounter with an outlaw biker in his Bensonhurst, Brooklyn bar, Joseph Paruta offered to help murder a biker who attacked Sammy and almost murdered him. After remaining a fugitive from the mob, the biker returned to Bensonhurst after a few years. Sammy Gravano said: \\"He reaches out for Paruta's kids and asks that they sit down with their father. He knows their father is connected, but he doesn't know he's with me. He says he had this trouble with Sammy the Bull and he knows he's a marked man. He wants Paruta to talk for him, and Paruta says, 'Sure, you're good friends with my kids, I'll talk to this Sammy for you. Just take it easy. Go about your business. Stay low key and I'll reach out for Sammy.' Paruta's son obviously knew their father was bullshitting him. The kids know Paruta is with me and everything that means.\\" The murder contract was later called off and the outlaw biker's life was spared. Gangland slaying of Robert DiBernardo On June 5, 1986, Robert DiBernardo was lured to the basement offices of Sammy Gravano's drywall company on Stillwell Avenue in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. Acting as if it was just a regular business meeting, Gravano told Paruta to get DiBernardo a cup of coffee. Paruta got up, but instead of getting the coffee, Paruta took a .38-caliber revolver from a cabinet behind DiBernardo and shot him in the back of the head. Gangland slaying of Nicholas Mormando Nicholas Mormando became hooked on crack cocaine. Sammy later said about Nicholas: > He became like a renegade. He went berserk. He didn't want to be in the crew > no more. He was going to start his own little gang. I couldn't take a chance > on him running around. He knew too much. So I got permission from John (John > Gotti) to kill him. We finally got Nicky to come by Tali's, and he went with > Huck (Thomas Carbonaro) to pick up Old Man (Joseph Paruta), who was still > alive then. Joe got in the backseat and shot Nicky twice in the back of the > head. Me and Eddie (Edward Garofalo) were trailing in a car behind. We > dumped the body in a vacant lot. It was found the next day. The murder of Nicholas Mormando remained unsolved until Sammy Gravano agreed to become a stool pigeon and testify against John Gotti at his racketeering trial. By the time Gravano was implicated in the murder, Paruta had succumbed to terminal lung cancer. Mercy killing In 1984, during one of Gravano's bedside visits to Paruta, he asked him to kill him. He told Sammy, \\"Kill me, Sammy. Kill me, please.\\" He tried to get Gravano to understand that a swift bullet was the best gift a true friend could give him. He couldn't stand the pain any more. But like every murder of a made man (which Paruta was), even a mercy killing, he had to get permission. He sent a message through Gene Gotti to John Gotti. He tried to prepare Gene and explain the situation as best as he could. Although Gravano never found out what Gene told John when they discussed Paruta, Gotti denied the mercy killing. He said that there was no way he would authorize a murder contract on a made man under the circumstances they were facing. Sammy brought Gotti's discussion to Paruta who did not accept the answer. He begged Sammy and prevailed on him that the friendship between them was above everything and that the only way he could prove his friendship was by carrying out the murder. Sammy ordered his brother-in-law Edward Garofalo to get a gun with a silencer. Sammy gave Paruta one day's notice to have his family away from the house on the day he was to be murdered. Thomas Carbonaro would be stationed outside the house in a car ready for a swift getaway. Edward and Gravano would go through a back door that would be left open by Paruta. The two of them would go up to the bedroom where Joseph was confined to having fallen very ill at this point. Edward would sit him in a comfortable position and then join Carbonaro in the car outside when Gravano would shoot him. Sammy later said, > It was all set. I was home waiting to be picked up by Huck and Eddie. My > wife was there. The night before I had been real irritable. When Debbie > mentioned this, I put her off. I said I had things on my mind. Now I stepped > outside for a second, and when I came back, she said she had sad news. Eddie > had just called. He said that Old Man Paruta suddenly took a turn for the > worst. He was rushed to the hospital by ambulance, but died on the way. He > was only fifty-nine. My man of loyalty, of heart and soul, a man of honor, > were gone. His friend and family consigliere Frank DeCicco would later be murdered a year later. The deaths of D'Angelo, Paruta and Frank DeCicco would all play a heavy toll on Sammy Gravano. With DeCicco's murder, Gravano would no longer have any of his original close friends or crew left having all met their demise either by his hand or at hands of others. The deaths of his criminal associates would later play a factor in deciding to testify against the Gambino crime family and his former boss and friend John Gotti. After Paruta died, he would help support his wife and children financially over the years. He was the only member of Gravano's crew not to meet their fate by being murdered. He was the last member of Gravano's original Bensonhurst, Brooklyn crew that he had inherited from Salvatore Aurello after Frank DeCicco was murdered by a car bomb in 1985, two years earlier. Replaced by Louis Vallario After Joseph died, Gambino crime family capo Louis Vallario said to Gravano, \\"I know what you're feeling. I can't fill Stymie's (Joseph D'Angelo)'s shoes, or Paruta's. I wouldn't even try. But I promise I'll be there for you.\\" In popular culture In the movie Witness to the Mob, Paruta is portrayed by actor Richard Bright.

Adler launched his first ceramic collection in 1993 at Barneys New York. Five years later he expanded into home furnishings, opening his first namesake boutique in Soho, Manhattan. He now has 17 stores and runs an eponymous home interiors business.  Early life and education After growing up in Bridgeton, New Jersey, Adler discovered an interest in pottery at summer camp when he was 12 years old. This interest in pottery was further enhanced by his father's own interest in pottery as a hobby he pursued in Philadelphia, while remaining in Bridgeton to practice law for a career. When Jonathan later attended Brown University, he studied semiotics and art history, but spent most of his time at the nearby Rhode Island School of Design making pots. His RISD pottery, including Chanel inspired teapots and Sevres inspired urns, reflected his interests in pop culture, early hip hop culture, contemporary art, and fashion. His professor told him: \\"You have no talent, you need to leave and give up on your dreams and go become a lawyer.\\"  Career After graduating, he spent three years as an assistant in the entertainment industry before returning to pottery, despite his former teacher's disapproval. He said in a 2013 interview that \\"...every creative person, and every craftsperson, should have a naysayer to rebel against.\\" In 1990, Adler started teaching classes at Mud, Sweat 'n' Tears in New York City in exchange for free studio space. With those pots on hand, he cold-called the buyers from Barneys New York, received an order, and became a full-time production potter. In 1993 he founded Jonathan Adler Enterprises LLC. He started as a production potter, producing on his own for years. He later worked with Aid to Artisans, a non-profit organization that works to help artisans in developing countries by connecting them with decorators in America. While in Peru visiting pottery studios, he was inspired by South American textiles and started designing pillows, throws, and rugs inspired by the work he found there. Adler opened his first store in SoHo, Manhattan in 1998 and today his designs are sold in 30 stores and over 1,000 retailers. His designs include pots and sofas. Jonathan Adler bathroom accessories at the NoMad Las Vegas Adler has handled the interior decorator work of several commercial and residential projects.

For many generations, the Tatsuuma house had produced sake and barrels in Nishinomiya. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, Tatsuuma had become a relatively large brewery under Tatsuuma Kichizaemon IX, Kiyo's father. Born in 1809, Kiyo was the only child of Tatsuuma Kichizaemon IX. As a child, Kiyo learned and observed the family business, which made her very knowledgeable about the sake industry. In 1830, Kiyo married the son of another brewing house, and in 1842, he assumed the headship of her family as Kichizaemon X. As a married couple, they had many children. Records only show six, but some sources state that she had as many as twelve. Kiyo‚Äôs husband died in 1855, and her eldest son took over as the headship of the family. For the next fifty years, the Tatsuuma brewery, called Hakushika, prospered greatly. Kiyo never assumed family headship, but she was the power behind them. Women were not allowed inside the brewery, but Kiyo learned to supervise the workers closely. Under her leadership, Hakushika grew to be the largest sake empire in Japan. By 1894, the brewery had an output of 22,000 koku annually, three times larger than the nearest competitor. Under her watch, the brewery underwent many innovations that contributed to its success. Kiyo was savvy not only in business, but also in the marriage arrangements she made for her children. Through her strategy of founding branch families, sending out sons to be adopted, and marrying daughters to other brewing houses, she created her own family empire in the sake industry. Kiyo died in 1900, only after she expanded the Tatsuuma family enterprises as the largest brewer and shipper of sake in an era when sake was Japan‚Äôs major industry.

It was built by Anson Phelps Stokes, a mine developer, railroad magnate, and banker. Intending the building as a summer home, Stokes began building the castle in 1896, completing it in 1897. The castle is patterned after a tower that Stokes had seen and admired in the Roman Campagna in Italy. The castle is built of hand-hewn native granite, and the stones were hoisted into place with a hand winch and held in place with rock wedging and clay mortar. The kitchen and dining room were on the first floor, while the second floor contained the living room and the third floor housed two bedrooms. Each of the floors had a fireplace, and the second and third floors each had a balcony. The roof had a battlemented terrace. The family occupied the Stokes Castle for a short time. The family traveled west in June 1897 with friends and spent about a month in the castle. They spent a few more days in October 1897. They returned in the summer of 1898, but they sold their mine, the milling equipment, and the castle, and never returned to the town. Eventually, the castle fell into disrepair until Molly Magee Knudsen, a cousin of Stokes, bought the castle in 1956. The tower was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.

Route description  Provincial Road 366 starts in the Swan River Valley region of Manitoba, serving Bowsman and Minitonas, crosses the Duck Mountains, and then goes through west-central Manitoba from Grandview to Inglis. PR 366 serves as the main north-south route through Duck Mountain Provincial Park. It is mainly a gravel route, but there are short paved sections in Bowsman and Inglis, and longer paved stretches leading up to the Duck Mountains from both Minitonas and Grandview. The length of PR 366 is .  History  Since it was established, several changes and improvements have been made to the travel route: * The road was moved west of its original alignment past Wellman Lake. Most of the original route, now called Regatta Bay Road, remains in use for access to a cabin subdivision and two Bible camps. * During the summer of 2012, intersection improvements were made to PR 366's two junctions along PTH 10, including an exit ramp from PTH 10 to southbound PR 366 near Minitonas. * The northernmost section of PR 366 (past PTH 10) has changed several times. Originally, it went straight north to PR 268, crossing PR 587 directly east of Bowsman. Then, for a time, the route was turned over to the local municipalities, and the official terminus of PR 366 was at PTH 10 near Minitonas. However, in 2006 a ford crossing on PR 587 was decommissioned, rendering the eastern portion of that route useless, except to local traffic. Rather than having PR 587 make a dead-end at Craigsford, the western part of PR 587 was resigned as PR 366, and another portion of the original PR 366 was re-established from PTH 10 to Craigsford.

The Harrington MacDonald-Briggs Building, also facing demolition can be seen to the right. The Sweet Basil Building, also known as the P. Martin Liquors Building, was a heritage building on the waterfront of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada which was demolished by Halifax developer Armour Group in November 2008 as part of the company's controversial Waterside Centre Development proposal. History The building, known by the name of its last occupant, a Halifax restaurant, was built in the 1840s. It was a three-story wood frame building, the last wooden building on Halifax's Water Street and was typical of the ‚ÄúSailortown‚Äù buildings which served seafarer's in Nova Scotia's Age of Sail.Judith Fingard, ‚Äò‚ÄôJack in Port: Sailortowns of Eastern Canada‚Äô‚Äô, University of Toronto Press (1982) page 54 It stood beside the oldest storefront in Halifax, the 1820 Harrington MacDonald-Briggs Building and faced preserved warehouses and shipping offices of Privateer's Wharf, a National Historic Site. The building served as a sailor's boarding house, liquor store, confectionery, grocery store and restaurant.Halifax Chronicle Herald, Saturday November 1, 2008, page 1 The building was rented to a successful Halifax restaurant but Armour group argued that it was uneconomical because the upper floors were not suited for profitable modern office space. The last tenant, the Sweet Basil Bistro, reluctantly left the building after 19 years on the site due to the redevelopment. Heritage Status and Demolition The Sweet Basil Building was designated a municipally protected heritage building in 1981. It was also a nationally recognized building under the federal Historic Places program.\\"P. Martin Liquors Building\\" Canada's Historic Places Program However Armour Group overturned the designation in court in 2008 arguing that it was designated in error. Armour Group wished to use the land to build a nine-story office tower called the Waterside Centre, which involved the demolition of six heritage buildings, although the facades of some would be reconstructed at street level. The project faced widespread public opposition at municipal hearings in September 2008‚ÄùHistoric Indecision: Waterside Centre‚Äù, The Coast Sept. 18, 2008 and was narrowly rejected by the council of Halifax Regional Municipality on October 21.Halifax Chronicle Herald, Wednesday, October 22, 2008 However Armour Group announced that they would appeal the decision to Nova Scotia's Utility and Review Board, on October 31, the same day as his company began demolition of the Sweet Basil Building.Halifax Chronicle Herald, Saturday November 1, page 1. The Board overturned Council's decision and approved the controversial office tower on March 26, 2009 and Halifax Council voted not to further oppose the development and or try and save the remaining buildings on April 7, 2009.\\"City Council Says Yes to Waterside\\", Halifax Chronicle Herald, April 8, 2009, p. 1 After boarding windows and demolishing exterior parts of the building on October 21, the entire building was demolished early Sunday morning, November 2, 2008.‚ÄùDeveloper Makes Good on Demolition Promise‚Äù, Halifax Chronicle Herald , November 3, 2008, page B1 Promoters of downtown development such as the Halifax Chamber of Commerce noted that the demolition and disputed development highlight the need for a more streamlined development process. Heritage advocates such as Heritage Trust of Nova Scotia pointed to the demolition as a sign of the weakness of municipal heritage designations and the lack of any heritage districts in downtown Halifax.Halifax Chronicle Herald‚Äô‚Äô, Saturday November 1, 2008, page 1.

The inequality is tight up to constant factors. Formal statement Pinsker's inequality states that, if P and Q are two probability distributions on a measurable space (X, \\\\Sigma), then :\\\\delta(P,Q) \\\\le \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1}{2} D_{\\\\mathrm{KL}}(P\\\\Q)}, where :\\\\delta(P,Q)=\\\\sup \\\\bigl{ P(A) - Q(A) \\\\big A \\\\in \\\\Sigma \\\\text{ is a measurable event} \\\\bigr} is the total variation distance (or statistical distance) between P and Q and :D_{\\\\mathrm{KL}}(P\\\\Q) = \\\\operatorname{E}_P \\\\left( \\\\log \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d} P}{\\\\mathrm{d} Q} \\\\right) = \\\\int_X \\\\left( \\\\log \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d} P}{\\\\mathrm{d} Q} \\\\right) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} P is the Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence in nats. When the sample space X is a finite set, the Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence is given by : D_{\\\\mathrm{KL}}(P\\\\Q) = \\\\sum_{i \\\\in X} \\\\left( \\\\log \\\\frac{P(i)}{Q(i)}\\\\right) P(i)! Note that in terms of the total variation norm \\\\ P - Q \\\\ of the signed measure P - Q, Pinsker's inequality differs from the one given above by a factor of two: :\\\\ P - Q \\\\ \\\\le \\\\sqrt{2 D_{\\\\mathrm{KL}}(P\\\\Q)}. A proof of Pinsker's inequality uses the partition inequality for f-divergences. History Pinsker first proved the inequality with a worse constant. The inequality in the above form was proved independently by Kullback, Csisz√°r, and Kemperman. Inverse problem A precise inverse of the inequality cannot hold: for every \\\\varepsilon > 0, there are distributions P_\\\\varepsilon, Q with \\\\delta(P_\\\\varepsilon,Q)\\\\le\\\\varepsilon but D_{\\\\mathrm{KL}}(P_\\\\varepsilon\\\\Q) = \\\\infty. An easy example is given by the two-point space {0,1} with Q(0) = 0, Q(1) = 1 and P_\\\\varepsilon(0) = \\\\varepsilon, P_\\\\varepsilon(1) = 1-\\\\varepsilon. The divergence becomes infinite whenever one of the two distributions assigns probability zero to an event while the other assigns it a nonzero probability (no matter how small); see e.g. .

Construction and commissioning Waldo County was laid down as USS LST-1163 on 4 August 1952 at Pascagoula, Mississippi, by Ingalls Shipbuilding Corporation. She was launched on 17 March 1953, sponsored by Mrs. C. Richard Shaeffner, and commissioned on 17 September 1953 with Lieutenant Commander Robert H. Steinkellner in command. Operations in U.S. waters and Caribbean 1953‚Äì1955 LST-1163 departed Pascagoula on 14 October 1953 and steamed via Key West, Florida, Florida; Port Everglades, Florida; and Charleston, South Carolina, to her permanent home port, Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek, in Virginia Beach, Virginia. She arrived at Little Creek on 25 October 1953. Exercises and shakedown training occupied the remainder of 1953 and the first few months of 1954. On 14 June 1954, LST-1163 departed Little Creek for Morehead City, North Carolina, to embark United States Marines for amphibious exercises. She arrived at Morehead City on the 15 June 1954, loaded troops and equipment, and got underway on 16 June 1954 for Vieques Island, located near Puerto Rico in the West Indies. LST-1163 reached Vieques Island on 21 June 1954 and conducted amphibious training until 1 July 1954, when she headed back to Little Creek. She arrived at Little Creek on 5 July 1954 and remained there eight days before entering the Norfolk Naval Shipyard at Portsmouth, Virginia, on 13 July 1954. She left the shipyard on 6 August 1954 and returned to Little Creek to resume duty with the Amphibious Force, United States Atlantic Fleet. For the remainder of the year, LST-1163 conducted a series of amphibious exercises, mostly at Vieques Island, but she also participated in one cold-weather exercise at Hamilton Inlet on the coast of Labrador in Newfoundland, Canada, in November 1954. On 18 January 1955, LST-1163 entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for her first major overhaul. She emerged from the yard, revitalized, on 20 May 1955 and resumed duty with the Amphibious Force. On 1 July 1955, LST-1163 was renamed USS Waldo County (LST-1163). Through the summer of 1955, Waldo County remained close to or in Little Creek. First Mediterranean deployment 1955‚Äì1956 On 24 August 1955, Waldo County departed the Norfolk, Virginia, area for her first overseas deployment. After stops at Bordeaux in France, Port Lyautey in Morocco, and at Gibraltar, she joined the United States Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean late in September 1955. For the next four months, she ranged the length and breadth of the Mediterranean Sea conducting Sixth Fleet amphibious exercises and making port visits. On 25 January 1956, she departed Port Lyautey on her way home. She returned to Norfolk on 6 February 1956 and resumed operations with the United States Second Fleet. Operations 1956‚Äì1970 In her first two years of active service, Waldo County established a pattern of operations which endured until the end of 1964. She alternated five Mediterranean deployments with periods of duty out of Little Creek conducting amphibious training at such places as Vieques Island, Onslow Beach in North Carolina, and at various locations in the Canadian Maritime Provinces. During her second Mediterranean deployment, which lasted from August 1957 to February 1958, she acted as a unit of a contingency force established in the eastern Mediterranean during civil unrest in Lebanon. In 1959 the Waldo County made her first and only Top Secret Mission. A Top Secret crypto message ordered her and two sister ship LST's to proceed from Little Creek to Quantico Marine Base for further orders. At Quantico the LST's on-loaded two battalions of South Vietnamese marines and US Marine trainers and proceeded to the Caribbean to hold amphibious landing exercises for several weeks. At the conclusion the Marines were dropped off at Camp Lejeune. Not too many years later the U.S. was deeply involved in the Vietnam war. The remaining three deployments were more routine in nature, consisting only of training missions and port visits. Between her third and fourth deployments to the Sixth Fleet, she earned the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal in November and December 1961 when she cruised Cuban waters as a part of another contingency force established in response to a wave of what the United States considered to be terrorist actions by the Cuban government following the abortive April 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba. Otherwise, the periods between deployments consisted entirely of routine Second Fleet operations, primarily amphibious training missions at the previously named locations. Waldo County returned to Little Creek from her fifth and last Mediterranean cruise on 17 November 1964. At that point, she began a new phase of her career. No longer did she deploy to the Sixth Fleet. For the remaining six years of her active career, she confined her operations to the United States East Coast and the West Indies. The ubiquitous amphibious exercises predominated, but, on two occasions, she did perform special missions. In May and June 1965, she again earned the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal when she joined another contingency force in the West Indies during a period of extreme internal unrest in the Dominican Republic quelled by the intervention of forces of the Organization of American States. In 1966, she qualified for that award again by returning to the Dominican Republic once more. From that time on, Waldo County broke her routine of U.S. East Coast ‚Äì West Indies operations only one time. In January 1970, she steamed to the Panama Canal and transited it for a brief series of landing exercises on the Pacific Ocean side of the Panamanian Isthmus. She retransited the canal on 2 February 1970 and resumed operations in the West Indies. Normal operations occupied her time until September 1970, at which time she began preparations for inactivation. Decommissioning, reserve, and Military Sealift Command service 1970‚Äì1973 Waldo County was decommissioned on 21 December 1970 and laid up in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Orange Texas. She remained there until May 1972, at which time she was reactivated for non- commissioned service as a cargo ship with a civil service crew with the Military Sealift Command (MSC) as the United States Naval Ship USNS Waldo County (T-LST-1163). She operated under MSC control for about 18 months before being sticken from the Navy List on 1 November 1973. Layup and transfer to Peru Waldo County name was stricken from the Navy List on 1 November 1973, and she was transferred to the Maritime Administration for layup in the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay at Benicia, California. On 7 August 1984, Waldo County and three of her sister ships ‚Äì USS Traverse County (LST-1160), USS Walworth County (LST-1164), and USS Washoe County (LST-1165) ‚Äì were leased to Peru, and Waldo County was commissioned into service in the Peruvian Navy as BAP Pisco (DT-142) on 4 March 1985. Peru renewed the lease on all four ships in August 1989 and August 1994,Jane's All the World's Fighting Ships, 2001-2002, p. 521. and the United States sold all four outright to Peru on 26 April 1999 under the Security Assistance Program; all four were struck from the U.S. Naval Register on the day of the sale. She was decommissioned from the Peruvian Navy in 2012 and scrapped the same year. Notes References * *Saunders, Stephen, Commodore, RN. Jane's All the World's Fighting Ships, 2001-2002.

In the show, it is first sung as a duet by the characters Gaylord Ravenal, a handsome riverboat gambler, and the teenage Magnolia Hawks, an aspiring performer and daughter of the show boat captain, soon after their meeting in Act I. It reveals that they are smitten with each other almost immediately upon meeting and sets the tone for the contrasts between the ideal ‚Äúmake believe‚Äù world of the young lovers and the harsh realities of life that they will encounter throughout the story. In Act II, Ravenal sings it to his little daughter Kim, just before he deserts her and Magnolia because of his compulsive gambling. He tells Kim to sing it whenever she is lonely and to pretend he has never been away. The song was introduced by Norma Terris and Howard Marsh. It was not performed in the 1929 part-talkie film of Show Boat. The first successful recording of the song was by Paul Whiteman and his Orchestra on January 27, 1928 (vocal by Bing Crosby). The song has since become a standard and been recorded by numerous musical artists. Film appearances For film, it was sung by Irene Dunne and Allan Jones in the 1936 version of the musical, by Tony Martin and Kathryn Grayson in the 1946 Kern biopic Till the Clouds Roll By, and by Howard Keel and Kathryn Grayson in the 1951 version of Show Boat. In the 1951 film, instead of singing it to Kim just before he leaves, Ravenal sings it to her when he meets her for the first time after being away for several years - the exact reverse of the situation in the original show and the 1936 film version. He has finally returned and now asks her to pretend that he has never been away.

The station went silent on June 27, 2019. Prior to going silent, the station was in trimulcast with KOYE and KCUL-FM as Regional Mexican formatted \\"La Invasora\\". History The station was formerly known as \\"The Buzz\\", created as an alternative rock addition to Shreveport, and competed mainly with local hard rock station, 99x. The Buzz brought a refreshing new style of music to the area, featuring many bands that were not played on 99x or any other station. On Saturday nights, The Buzz was transformed into \\"Club Buzz,\\" where all the songs played were techno- influenced remixes of the normal alternative songs that it played. The Buzz also featured a variety of interaction with listeners as well as original contests. Weekly contests featured were The Free Buzz at 4:20, Thumbs Up or the Finger, The Buzz Rewind, and the short lived Buzz Bits, where listeners could call in and say whatever they wanted, within reason. Its Too Cool for Tool contest was also original, with each contestant sitting on a large tub of ice, and whoever lasting the longest receiving a pair of Tool concert tickets, along with a \\"Tool\\"-box full of Tool SWAG. The Buzz came to an abrupt end in 2004, in circumstances where it was literally there one minute and gone the next. No reason was ever stated for the cancellation of the station, and the format was quickly switched to Christmas music until the start of the new year. Since The Buzz, the station has been a light rock station and its current format is Spanish radio. KSYR started 95.7 which now contains the oldies format that was on this frequency. On 95.7 it was first known as country. Then in approximately 1997 it flipped to Star 95.7, an Adult Contemporary station claimed to sit in between the CHR of 94.5 and soft rock of 96.5. It played hit music without the rap, sleepy music or hard rock trying to appeal to the core working audience. However, it flipped to a rhythmic top 40 as Power 95.7. The music selection mixed boy bands with the flourishing urban music scene putting it between KMJJ, KBTT and the more rock leaning top 40 at KRUF. Ultimately in 2001 it became the Buzz and moved to its present frequency.

Big turn around set in a town The film tells the story of a samurai who falls on hard times due to misunderstandings and explains the plots of his enemies. Such explanations superbly depict the absurdity of the samurai's unjust world, making this work pertinent even today. Analysis The kinetic sword fighting scenes masterfully performed by Band≈ç were novel in an age when kabuki-style, leisurely and dignified movies were the norm. This style was passed onto modern chambara films. Additionally, the sword fighting style's aesthetic value is slightly lost in Orochi due to the pace at which the fight scenes were filmed (fast-forward motion). Due to the kabuki style, the makeup on the characters transformed them into almost identical representations of ukiyo-e (woodblock prints), a major Japanese art form. Title Title screen of Orochi The original title of the movie was supposed to be \\"Outlaw,\\" but the Japanese censors and police banned it, because the depiction of an outlaw as a hero was seen as very dangerous.

During the conversation, the fake Sarkozy, speaking in English (the real Sarkozy does not speak English), talked to Palin about foreign policy, hunting, and the 2008 U.S. presidential election. After it was revealed to Palin that the call was a prank, she handed the phone to one of her assistants who told the comedy duo \\"I will find you\\" and hung up. Both the McCain and Obama campaigns released light-hearted statements about the prank. However, a McCain campaign advisor said that behind the scenes, aides and advisors to the campaign were not happy that the pranksters were able to lie their way up to Palin, or with the publicity Palin received because of the call. Background \\"The Masked Avengers\\" are Disc jockeys and comedians S√©bastien Trudel and Marc-Antoine Audette, a Canadian radio duo from Montreal, Quebec radio station CKOI-FM, who have become notorious for making prank calls to celebrities, such as business mogul Bill Gates, golfer Tiger Woods, singer Britney Spears, and French president Nicolas Sarkozy. Sarah Palin was the Republican governor of Alaska. On August 29, 2008, John McCain announced that she would be his running mate in the 2008 presidential election against Democrats Barack Obama and Joe Biden. Critics of Palin voiced their concern what they saw as her lack of foreign policy experience, especially after an interview with Katie Couric of the CBS Evening News where Palin was criticized by many for her answer to a question about her \\"foreign policy credentials\\". Preparation Marc-Antoine Audette said that it took the duo about four or five days of calls to Palin's staff to finally be able to talk to her. They claimed that they started by talking to low-level people in Alaska and made their way up through Palin's campaign staff. Audette said that at first they didn't think their prank would work, calling it a \\"mission impossible\\". He claimed that \\"after about a dozen calls\\", the duo \\"started to realize it [the prank call] might work, because her [Sarah Palin's] staff didn't know the name of the French President. They asked us to spell it.\\" Audette and Trudel credited their ability to make their way up through Palin's staff to sounding convincing during the first few calls, always arranging to place the call at a set time, and not leaving a contact number. The four days of calls needed to talk to Palin was quicker compared to some of their other pranks. Audette and Trudel said that it took them two months to talk to Paul McCartney and one to talk to Bill Gates, but only two days to prank Britney Spears. Conversation Finally, on November 1, the Masked Avengers were able to talk to Palin. The call began with Trudel, who claimed to be an aide to Sarkozy named \\"Frank l‚Äôouvrier\\", talking to an assistant to Palin who identifies herself as \\"Lexi\\". Lexi puts Palin on the line, who says \\"hello\\" only to realize that Trudel is still on the other line. Trudel tells Palin to hold on for a moment while he gives the phone to Sarkozy, who is really Audette. Palin can be heard talking to someone in the room about when to hand Palin the phone. Audette then begins to speak and a somewhat extended conversation ensues. After Audette reveals that the call was a prank by CKOI in Montreal, Palin leaves the phone and can be heard in the background telling her aides that the call was \\"just a radio station prank\\". Audette is still on the line and jokes that \\"if one voice can change the world for Obama, one Viagra can change the world for McCain.\\" One of Palin's assistants picks up the phone and says \\"I‚Äôm sorry, I have to let you go. Thank you.\\" Reaction In an e-mail, Palin spokeswoman Tracey Schmitt wrote that \\"Governor Palin was mildly amused to learn that she had joined the ranks of heads of state, including President Sarkozy, and other celebrities in being targeted by these pranksters. C'est la vie.\\" When asked by reporters about the conversation, Palin said that she would \\"keep a sense of humor through all of this, just as we [the McCain campaign] did with SNL [parodies of her], too.\\" She added that \\"you've got to have some levity in all this.\\" Barack Obama senior advisor Robert Gibbs jokingly said in an interview that \\"I'm glad we [the Obama campaign] check out our calls before we hand the phone to Barack Obama.\\" The Masked Avengers received a sudden burst of fame from the prank. They gave more than 300 interviews about the conversation, and were even flown to New York City by CBS to appear on The Early Show. In an interview, Marc-Antoine Audette and S√©bastien Trudel said that they found it \\"pretty disturbing to see that idiots like us can go through to a vice-presidential candidate\\", and claimed that they were just \\"two stupid comedians with a bad French accent.\\" The Masked Avengers also admitted that the call was \\"probably the biggest [prank] we've ever done.\\" The prank allegedly caused friction between Sarah Palin and John McCain. When recalling the experience, Audette said that \\"once we [Audette and Trudel] started making jokes, she didn't seem to mind, and she didn't seem to be aware of the fact we were making jokes\\", which according to Audette was when \\"we were like 'Oh my God this [call] is gonna be long'\\". The duo also said that they weren't trying to make any political statements with the call, they just like to take high-profile people to task. Impact After McCain and Palin were defeated in the general election, a Republican campaign advisor told The New York Times that the McCain campaign was not happy about the prank, which caused friction between McCain and Palin. McCain and his advisors were allegedly upset that Palin did not tell them beforehand that she planned to speak with who she thought was Nicolas Sarkozy. McCain strategist Steve Schmidt called a meeting and demanded to know who let Palin talk to the fake Sarkozy without checking with senior advisors first. Steve Biegun, one of Palin's aides admitting to vetting the call without speaking to campaign advisors or the U.S. State Department, told the Los Angeles Times that \\"No one's going to beat me up more than I beat myself up for setting up the governor like that.\\" See also *Parodies of Sarah Palin *Saturday Night Live parodies of Sarah Palin References Notes External links * Sarah Palin duped by prank call, BBC, 2 November 2008 *\\"'I see you as president.'

Main manufacturing technique is screen printing (stenciling), which additionally to manufacturing electronic devices can also be used for various graphic reproduction targets. The technique is known in it's basic form about thousand years - already used during great Chinese dynasties. It became one of the key manufacturing/miniaturisation techniques of electronic devices/modules during 1950s. Typical film thickness - manufactured with thick film manufacturing processes for electronic devices - is 0.0001 - 0.1 mm. Thick-film circuits/modules are widely used in the automotive industry, both in sensors, e.g. mixture of fuel/air, pressure sensors, engine and gearbox controls, sensor for releasing airbags, ignitors to airbags; common is that high reliability is required, often extended temperature range also along massive thermocycling of circuits without failure. Other application areas are space electronics, consumer electronics and various measurement systems where low cost and/or high reliability is needed. Simplest form to utilise a thick film technology is a module substrate/board, where wiring is manufactured using thick film process. Additionally resistors and large tolerance capacitors can be manufactured with thick film methods. Thick film wiring can be made compatible with surface- mount technology (SMT), and if needed (due to tolerances and/or size requirements) surface mountable parts (resistors, capacitors, ICs etc.) can be assembled on a thick film substrate. The manufacturing of thick film devices/modules is an additive process involving deposition of several (typically max 6 - 8) successive layers of conductive, resistive and dielectric layers onto an electrically insulating substrate using a screen- printing process. As a low cost manufacturing method it is applicable to produce large volumes of discrete passive devices like resistors, thermistors, varistors and integrated passive devices. Thick film technology is also one of the alternatives to be used in hybrid integrated circuits and competes and complements typically in electronics miniaturization (parts or elements/area or volume) with SMT based on PCB (printed circuit board)/PWB (printed wiring board) and thin film technology. Steps A typical thick-film process would consist of the following stages: =Lasering of substrates= Typically thick film circuit substrates are Al2O3/alumina, beryllium oxide (BeO), aluminum nitride (AlN), stainless steel, sometimes even some polymers and in rare cases even silicon (Si) coated with silicon dioxide (SiO2)., Most used substrates for a thick-film process are either 94 or 96% alumina. Alumina is very hard and therefore lasering of the material is the most efficient way to machine it. The thick-film process is also a process of miniaturization where one substrates normally contain many units (final circuits), with the lasering it is possible to scribe, profile and drill holes. Scribing is a lasering process where a line of laser pulses are fired into the material and 30‚Äì50% of the material is removed, this weakens the substrate, after all other process are done to build the thick film circuit the substrates can easily be divided into single units. Profiling are for example used lot in the sensor, where a circuit need to fit round tubes or other different complex shapes. Drilling of holes, provide via between the two sides of the substrate, normally hole sizes are in the range 0.15‚Äì0.2 mm. Lasering before processing the substrates has a cost advantage to lasering or dicing using diamond saw after processing. =Ink preparation= Inks for electrodes, terminals, resistors, dielectric layers etc. are commonly prepared by mixing the metal or ceramic powders required with a solvent (ceramic thick film pastes) or polymer pastes to produce a paste for screen-printing. To achieve a homogeneous ink the mixed components of the ink may be passed through a three-roll mill. Alternatively, ready made inks may be obtained from several companies offering products for the thick-film technologist. =Screen-printing and its improvements= Screen-printing is the process of transferring an ink through a patterned woven mesh screen or stencil using a squeegee. For improving accuracy, increasing integration density and improving line and space accuracy of traditional screen-printing photoimageable thick-film technology has been developed. Use of these materials however changes typically the process flow and needs different manufacturing tools. =Drying/Curing= After allowing time after printing for settling of the ink, each layer of ink that is deposited is usually dried at a moderately high temperature (50 to 200 ¬∞C) to evaporate the liquid component of the ink and fix the layer temporarily in position on the substrate so that it can be handled or stored before final processing. For inks based on polymers and some solder pastes that cure at these temperatures this may be the final step that is required. Some inks also require curing by exposure to UV light. =Firing= For many of the metal, ceramic and glass inks used in thick film processes a high temperature (usually greater than 300 ¬∞C) firing is required to fix the layers in position permanently on the substrate. =Abrasive Trimming of resistors= After firing the resistors can be trimmed using a precision abrasive cutting method first developed by S.S. White. The method involves a fine abrasive media, usually 0.027 mm aluminum oxide. The abrasive cutting is fed through a carbide nozzle tip that can be of different sizes. The nozzle is advanced through the fired resistor while the resistor element is monitored with probe contacts and when final value is reached the abrasive blast is shut off and the nozzle retracts to the zero start position. The abrasive technique can achieve very high tolerances with no heat and no cracking of the glass frit used in the ink formulation. =Laser trimming of resistors= After firing, the substrate resistors are trimmed to the correct value. This process is named laser trimming. Many chip resistors are made using thick-film technology. Large substrates are printed with resistors fired, divided into small chips and these are then terminated, so they can be soldered on the PCB board. With laser trimming two modes are used; either passive trimming, where each resistor is trimmed to a specific value and tolerance, or active trimming, where the feedback is used to adjust to a specific voltage, frequency or response by laser trimming the resistors on the circuit while powered up. =Mounting of capacitors and semiconductors= The development of the SMT process actually evolves from the thick film process. Also mounting of naked dies (the actual silicon chip without encapsulation) and wire bonding is a standard process, this provides the basis for miniaturization of the circuits as all the extra encapsulation is not necessary. =Separation of elements= This step is often necessary because many components are produced on one substrate at the same time. Thus, some means of separating the components from each other is required. This step may be achieved by wafer dicing. =Integration of devices= At this stage the devices may require integrating with other electronic components, usually in the form of a printed circuit board. This may be achieved by wire bonding or soldering. Process control of thick film manufacturing There are numerous steps in the thick film manufacturing, which need careful control like roughness of the substrate, curing temperatures and times of pastes, selected stencil thickness vs. paste type etc., Therefore number of used pastes and process steps define the complexity of the process and cost of the final product. Designing circuits based on thick-film technology Same or similar electronic design automation tools which are used for designing printed circuit boards can be used for designing thick film circuits. However the compatibility of tooling formats with stencil manufacturing/manufacturer needs attention as well as the availability of the geometrical, electrical and thermal design rules for simulation and layout design from the final manufacturer.

This was close to the centre of the medieval city. The parish is in the Diocese of Dublin and Glendalough. St Audoen's is the oldest parish church in Dublin and still used as such. There is a Roman Catholic church of the same name adjacent to it. Church The church is named after St Ouen (or Audoen) of Rouen (Normandy), a saint who lived in the seventh century and was dedicated to him by the Anglo-Normans, who arrived in Dublin after 1172. It was erected in 1190, possibly on the site of an older church dedicated to St. Columcille, dating to the seventh century. Shortly afterwards the nave was lengthened (but also made narrower) and a century later a chancel was added. In 1430 Henry VI, Lord of Ireland, authorised the erection of a chantry here, to be dedicated to St Anne. Its founders and successors were to be called the Guild or Fraternity of St Anne, usually called Saint Anne's Guild. Six separate altars were set up in this chapel and were in constant use, financed by the wealthier parishioners. In 1485 Sir Roland Fitz-Eustace, Earl Portlester, erected a new chapel next to the nave, in gratitude for his preservation from shipwreck near the site. The turbulent events of the 16th century had its effects on the upkeep of the church and in 1630 the church was declared to be in a decrepit state. The Archbishop, Lancelot Bulkeley, complained that \\"there is a guild there called St Anne's Guild that hath swallowed upp all the church meanes\\" (although chantries and guilds were suppressed during the Reformation in England and their property taken over by the king, in Ireland they survived, with varying vicissitudes, for many years).Ronan, 1926, p. 329 Seal of St. Anne's Guild, 1599 Strenuous efforts were made over the next few years to repair the roof, steeple and pillars of the building, and the guild was ordered to contribute its share. Funds were low ‚Äì there were only sixteen Protestant houses in the parish. In 1671 Michael Boyle, the Church of Ireland Primate, ordered the \\"annoyance of the buttermilke market\\" under St Audoen's to be closed.Donovan (1930) In 1673 an order was made to remove the tombs and tombstones from the church \\"to preserve the living from being injured by the dead\\".Gilbert (1854) St Anne's Guild, which had managed to secret away its extensive properties after the Reformation, and which had remained under Roman Catholic control, never did give up its holdings, despite several investigations and court orders lasting until 1702. Although many repairs were carried out to the church and tower over the centuries, finance for the maintenance of the structures was always a problem, particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries. By 1825, the church building itself was in a ruinous state (as reported by G. N. Wright) and \\"very few Protestants\\" remained in the parish.G. N. Wright As the finance to carry out substantial repairs was not available, parts of the church were closed off or unroofed. As a consequence many ancient tombs gradually crumbled and memorials were removed or rendered illegible by exposure to the weather. Parish St. Audoen's church and arch (1400) St Audoen's parish was once the wealthiest within the city and the church was for hundreds of years frequented on State occasions by the Lord Mayor and Corporation.Donovan (1930) In its heyday, the church was closely connected with the Guilds of the city and \\"was accounted the best in Dublin for the greater number of Aldermen and Worships of the city living in the Parish\\" (Richard Stanihurst, 1568). The Tanners' Guild was located in the tower and the Bakers' Guild (Saint Anne's Guild) in a \\"college\\" adjoining the church.Crawford (1986), p. 14 In 1467 St Audoen's was made a prebendary of St. Patrick's Cathedral by Archbishop Michael Tregury.Crawford (1986), p. 19 In July 1536 George Browne arrived in Ireland as Archbishop of Dublin, and a few years later he energetically pushed through the wishes of Henry VIII to be recognized as supreme head of the Irish church. About 1544 the vicar of St Audoen's became the nominee of the Crown. In 1547 the assets of the parish were appropriated by the state church that was established following the English Reformation (more particularly the Tudor conquest of Ireland).Ronan, 1926 George Petrie, showing the Portlester chapel in 1829, after having lost its roof. Queen Mary I, soon after her accession in 1553, restored by Charter the Cathedral of St. Patrick. The Prebendary of St Audoen named in this Charter of Restoration was, in 1555, Robert Daly. However, when Queen Elizabeth I ascended the throne she nominated him Bishop of Kildare. From then on, all Roman Catholic ceremonies in the church ceased.Short Histories of Dublin Parishes, p. 167 After the Reformation the majority of parishioners remained loyal to the Roman Catholic church, and in 1615 a new Roman Catholic parish of St Audoen's was established.F H A Aalen and Kevin Whelan (editors) p. 243 However the Catholics were obliged to hold their services in secret, mainly in nearby Cook Street. Later in the century celebration of Mass was forbidden and bishops and priests deported, imprisoned or executed. This troubled period for Catholics lasted until the beginning of the 19th century.Gilbert (1854), p. 305 et passim Meanwhile, the now Protestant church and parish of St Audoen had to struggle through the seventeenth century and began to decline.Gilbert (1854), p. 277-286, containing reports of 1630, decree of 1633, assessment from 1636, Bishop's report from 1639, and so on to the end of the century. Towards the end of the eighteenth century, following a trend in several inner-city parishes, many of the wealthy parish residents moved out to the suburbs, a process that was hastened by the Act of Union.Gilbert (1854), p. 285\\"The earliest extant parochial register (1672-1803) shows a significant drop in baptisms and burials during the second half of the 18th century. By 1880, the parish served an area of Dublin where poverty and social deprivation were very much to the fore.\\" Crawford, p. 15 Poor Catholics then moved into the houses thus vacated, which were turned into tenements.F H A Aalen and Kevin Whelan (editors) p. 239See census returns for this parish, 1901 Census In 1813 the population of the parish was 1,993 males and 2,674 females, the majority of whom were Roman Catholics.Government figures quoted in M'Gregor, Picture of Dublin (1821), p. 62 Restoration Plan of St. Audoen's drawn up by Thomas Drew in 1866 Revised plan of St. Audoen's Church following architectural studies in the 1990s The architect Thomas Drew was the first to draw serious attention to the importance of the church, architecturally and historically, in 1866. He produced detailed plans of the church for which he won an award from the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland, carried out excavations and drew up a paper on the church and its history. In a booklet published in 1873 the rector Alexander Leeper urged reroofing and restoration of the church. In the 1980s an extensive restoration of the tower and bells was carried out. A few years later St Anne's chapel, which had lost its roof and many monuments, was re- roofed and converted to a visitor reception centre, which included an exhibition on the history of the church.McMahon, 2006 During conservation works starting in 1996 an extensive excavation of a small section of the church was carried out, which cast new light on the early days of the church. This contributed greatly to an understanding of the building history of the church. The detailed results of this study were published in book form in 2006. Memorials In the main porch is stored an early Celtic gravestone known as the Lucky Stone which has been kept here or hereabouts since before 1309. It was said to have strange properties, and merchants and traders used to rub it for luck. It was first mentioned when Jon Le Decer, Mayor of Dublin, erected a marble cistern for water in Cornmarket in 1309 and placed this stone against it, so that all who drank of the waters may have luck. The stone was stolen on a number of occasions but always found its way back this neighbourhood. In 1826 it disappeared for twenty years, until found in front of the newly erected Catholic Church in High Street.Donovan (1930) In the porch of the western door lie the fifteenth-century monuments of Sir Roland Fitz-Eustace, Lord Portlester, who died in 1496, and his wife, Margaret. Fitz- Eustace was Deputy Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, then Lord Chancellor of Ireland and finally Lord High Treasurer of Ireland. His refusal to surrender this last post led to a break with the king and almost to civil war. He was buried at Cotlandstown, County Kildare. Peter Talbot the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, who died in prison in 1680, is said to have been secretly entombed nearby. Among those buried in the church are William Molyneux, his brother Sir Thomas Molyneux and Thomas' son Capel,G. N. Wright Edward Parry, the Bishop of Killaloe and his sons John Parry and Benjamin Parry, successively Bishops of Ossory, and Lady Frances Brudenell.Gilbert (1854), p. 282 During excavations in the 19th century an Anglo-Norman font, dating to the 12th century, was found and is now on display in the church. Tower The church tower dates from the 17th century. The need to keep this structure in good repair was always a drain on parish funds. It was repaired in 1637, which was paid for by the Guild of St Anne, but in 1669 part of it collapsed onto the roof of the church, and it had to be re-built. The Guild contributed ¬£250 towards the cost of reconstruction. In 1826 the tower was remodelled by Henry Aaron Baker but by the end of the century was again in a dangerous state. Some remedial work was carried out in 1916 after an appeal from the Archbishop of Dublin, but it was not until the major restoration of 1982 that the tower was rendered safe.Crawford (1986), p. 23 The tower houses six bells, three of which are Ireland's oldest bells, dating from 1423. The bells were rung for the Angelus and after the Reformation continued to be rung every morning and evening to call the people to and from their work. Two bells in the tower were cast by John Murphy of Dublin in 1864 and 1880, and the treble was dated 1790 and came from Glasgow. Due to the fragile state of the tower they were not rung between 1898 and 1983. After the tower was strengthened with concrete, a major overhaul was done on the bells. Three of the bells were recast, and the tenor was recast in memory of Alexander E. Donovan (1908-1982), who was closely connected with the church. They are now rung every week.Curtis (1992), p. 91 The present clock on the church tower came from St Peter's Church in Aungier Street, after this church was demolished in the 1980s. The clock face dates from the 1820s.Curtis (1992), p. 91 Cemetery Front of the church in 1968 The old disused graveyard of St Audoen's has been converted into a recreation ground. Many notables were buried there, including many bishops and Lord Mayors of the city and the families of Ball, Bath, Blakeney, Browne, Cusack, Desminier, Fagan, Foster, Fyan, Gifford, Gilbert, Malone, Mapas, Molesworth, Penteny, Perceval, Quinn, Talbot and Ussher.Gilbert (1854), p. 283 The Curate-assistant Christopher Teeling McCready (died 1913) collected detailed genealogies of some of these families in seven hand-written volumes, which are now in Marsh's Library. Among the burials within the church and graveyard are: *Bartholomew Ball *Margaret Ball *Nicholas Ball *Lady Frances Brudenell *John Bysse *Adam Cusack *Paul Davys *Paul Davys, 1st Viscount Mount Cashell *Sir William Davys *Robert Molesworth, 1st Viscount Molesworth *Sir Thomas Molyneux *William Molyneux *Benjamin Parry *Edward Parry *John Parry *Philip Perceval *Sir James Somerville, 1st Baronet *Peter Talbot Historical events On 11 March 1597 a massive accidental gunpowder explosion in one of the nearby quays damaged the tower of St. Audoen's. In the 1640s, at the time of the Catholic Confederate Rebellion, the burghers of the city could see from the church tower the fires of their opponents burning in the distance. In 1733 a popular Alderman, Humphrey Frend, was returned at an election by a large majority, and two barrels of pitch were burned as celebration at the top of St. Audoen's tower. The United Irishman Oliver Bond was elected Minister's Churchwarden of the church in 1787 (although a Presbyterian, the established church was entitled to appoint local residents for church duties).Donovan (1930) Another United Irishman whose family had a long association with the church was James Napper Tandy, born at No. 5 Cornmarket and baptised (as 'James Naper Tandy') on 16 February 1739.The parish record book lists the entries for January and February 1739 as '1738', apparently in clerical error. He was a Churchwarden of the church in 1765 and played a significant role in the life of the city before the Act of Union in 1801.Crawford (1986), p. 38 In 1793 a petition was sent from the vestry, requesting the removal of the police on the grounds of expense and inefficiency, and for the return of the night watchman originally appointed by the parish.Donovan (1930) References and sources ;Sources  *Dublin: Catholic Truth Society, 1911: Bishop of Canea: Short Histories of Dublin Parishes  * *F.

She stood out of Marseilles on 26 November 1918, stopped briefly at Gibraltar once again, and arrived at New York City on 11 December 1918. On the day of her arrival, Walter A.

At New York, she was converted to a troop transport to help in the task of bringing home American troops from Europe. By 22 January 1919, she was ready to begin her role in that large movement of people. Between late January and early July 1919, Walter A. Luckenbach made five round-trip voyages to France, two to Bordeaux and three to St. Nazaire. She returned to New York from her final voyage on 11 July 1919. Walter A. Luckenbach was decommissioned at Hoboken, New Jersey, on 28 July 1919, and was returned to the Luckenbach Steamship Company that same day. Once again SS Walter A. Luckenbach, she entered mercantile service with that company. Post-World War I commercial career Walter A. Luckenbach labored in behalf of Luckenbach Steamship Company until 1950, when she changed hands and names twice. First, she was sold to the New Orleans Coal and Bisso Towboat Company, Inc., and briefly served that company as SS A. L. Bisso. Later in the year, the Turkish firm Marsa Ithalat-Ithracat, T.A.S., bought her and renamed her SS Mardin. She served that firm and under that name for the remainder of her mercantile career. Mardin arrived at Bremen, West Germany, early in 1957 to load cargo, but was not allowed to leave port because of unpaid repair bills. After a lengthy period in custody, she attempted to escape on a stormy, dark night later that year, slipping away from her moorings unannounced, showing no lights, using no tugboat assistance, and with no harbor pilot aboard. She proceeded at full speed down the Weser River, trying to reach international waters in the North Sea before West German authorities could stop her. The harbor police did not realize that she was attempting to escape until she was off Bremerhaven and approaching the open sea, so they used an ex-German Navy patrol boat at Bremerhaven to pursue her. They caught her just before she got beyond the three-nautical-mile (5.6 km) limit of West German territorial waters, boarded her while she was still underway, arrested her master on her bridge, and forced her to return to Bremen. She was once again placed in custody. Records of Mardins status after the 1957 incident are unclear as to her fate, but she does not appear ever to have resumed commercial operations. She is believed to have been scrapped in 1958 or 1959. References NavSource Online: Service Ship Photo Archive Walter A.

He was the seigneur of La Roche and Thorey-sur-Ouche, a Knight of the Golden Fleece, and the Grand Seneschal of Burgundy. Born in 1428 at the Ch√¢teau de la Rochepot,Then called La Roche-Nolay, this roche has since absorbed the name of its seigneurs. (Jean-Bernard de Vaivre, \\"Un primitif tir√© de l'oubli : le panneau de Philippe Pot de Notre-Dame de Dijon\\", Comptes- rendus des s√©ances... Acad√©mie des inscriptions et belles-lettres 149.2 (2005:811-858), p. 816 note 12; Vaivre gives a summary biography of Pot, who appears as donor in the recently rediscovered diptych.) he was the grandson of R√©gnier Pot, a Crusader, knight of the Golden Fleece, and the chamberlain of Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. Philip's grandson and heir, Philip the Good, served as Philippe's godfather. Educated at the ducal court in Dijon, and knighted 11 June 1452 before the battle of Ruppelmonde against the insurgents of Ghent,Vaivre 2005:816. Philippe, praised by contemporary chroniclers, became chief advisor of the dukes of Burgundy and was deeply involved in all their diplomacy. Philippe was sent by Philip the Good as an ambassador to London in 1440, where he procured the release of Charles of Orl√©ans, a prisoner since 1415 and the cousin of Charles VII of France, for 200,000 √©cus d'or. Charles in turn agreed to marry Mary of Cleves, Philip's niece. In 1446, Philippe obtained the hand in marriage of Catherine of Valois for the Count of Charolais, the future Duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold. When Catherine died in 1450, Philippe obtained another French princess, Isabelle of Bourbon, for Charles. The marriage took place in 1454. In December 1456 Duke Philip recompensed Philippe with the grant of Ch√¢teauneuf-en-Auxois (which Philippe restored and fortified, giving it the appearance it retains today)Vaivre 2005:817 and note 18. and in May 1461, with the Golden Fleece at the Saint-Omer session. In 1464 he was granted the title Grand Chamberlain, and in 1466 was given the lordship of Walloon Flanders (Lille, Douai, and Orchies). After the deaths in 1467 of both Philip the Good and Isabelle of Bourbon, Philippe Pot negotiated a third match for his new patron Charles the Bold with Margaret of York, a union which had been opposed by Philip. In 1468 the marriage sealed an alliance between England and Burgundy. To have Philippe nearby him at Brussels Charles gave him the h√¥tel of the comte de Nevers. When Charles the Bold died in 1477, Burgundy was divided between his daughter, Mary, heiress to the Burgundian Netherlands, and Louis XI of France, legitimate heir to the Duchy of Burgundy proper. Mary was suspicious of Philippe and his close connections with the French court, and she confiscated Lille. With the support of the Burgundian baronage Philippe was able to limit the holdings of Mary and her husband, Maximilian, to the Burgundian Low Countries by another Treaty of Arras. In gratitude Louis XI named him first counsellor, knight of Saint Michael, governor of the Dauphin Charles, and Grand Seneschal of Burgundy. His treatment of Philippe went a long way to restore Louis's favour with the petty nobles of Burgundy. Louis died in 1483, while Charles VIII was still a minor. The great nobles of the kingdom, first among them Louis of Orl√©ans, contested the regency with the dead king's nominee, Anne de Beaujeu, Charles' elder sister. In 1484 she convened the Estates General at Tours. Philippe was the representative of the nobility and he spoke so eloquently in their favour that he was called the \\"mouth of Cicero\\" (bouche de Cic√©ron). In his most celebrated speech, on 9 February, he denied the right of the princes to govern and advanced instead the concept of a nation represented by a monarch, and suggested that the nation be governed by regency council. The deputies then voted to accept the choice of the king and declared Anne regent. The incipient nationalism in Philippe's speech, however, frightened the regent; the Estates were quickly dissolved. Philippe was allowed to keep his function of governor of Burgundy, which he held, reconfirmed by Charles VIII, until his death in 1493.

The type species is P. latippinis and was named by American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in 1869. Eleven other species have been identified. The name means 'much-cupped vertebrae', referring to the shape of the vertebrae. It lived in the Western Interior Seaway of North America toward the end of the Cretaceous. One fossil preserves an adult with a single large fetus inside of it, indicating that Polycotylus gave live birth, an unusual adaptation among reptiles. History Edward Drinker Cope named Polycotylus from the Niobrara Formation in Kansas in 1869. The holotype bones from which he based his description were fragmentary, representing only a small portion of the skeleton. A more complete skeleton was later found in Kansas and was described in 1906. A nearly complete skeleton was found in 1949 from the Mooreville Chalk Formation in Alabama, but was not described until 2002. A new species, P. sopozkoi, from Russia was described in 2016. Description Like all plesiosaurs, Polycotylus was a large marine reptile with a short tail, large flippers, and a broad body. It has a short neck and a long head, and was about long. It has more neck vertebrae than other polycotylids, however. Polycotylus is thought to be a basal polycotylid because it has more vertebrae in its neck (a feature that links it with long-necked ancestors) and its humerus has a more primitive shape. The long ischia of the pelvis are a distinguishing feature of Polycotylus, as are thick teeth with striations on their surfaces, a narrow pterygoid bone on the palate and a low sagittal crest on top of the skull. Classification Unlike some better-known long-necked plesiosaurs like Plesiosaurus and Elasmosaurus, Polycotylus had a short neck. This led to it being classified as a pliosaur, a marine reptile within the superfamily Pliosauroidea, closely related to true plesiosaurs (which belong to the superfamily Plesiosauroidea). Polycotylus and other polycotylids superficially resemble pliosaurs like Liopleurodon and Peloneustes because they have short necks, large heads, and other proportions that differ from true plesiosaurs. As phylogenetic analyses became common in the last few decades, the classification of Polycotylus and other plesiosaurs have been revised. In 1997, it and other polycotylids were reassigned as close relatives of long- necked elasmosaurids. In a 2001 study, Polycotylus was classified as a derived cryptocleidoid plesiosaur closely related to Jurassic plesiosaurs like Cryptocleidus. Below is a cladogram from a 2004 study which supported a similar classification: The specimen containing a fetus In 2007, Polycotylus was placed in a new subfamily of polycotylids called Polycotylinae. Another newly described polycotylid called Eopolycotylus from Glen Canyon, Utah, was found to be the closest relative of Polycotylus. Below is a cladogram from the 2007 study: Reproduction Restoration of an individual giving birth A fossil of P. latippinis catalogued LACM 129639 includes an adult individual with a single fetus inside it. LACM 129639 was found in Kansas during the 1980s and was in storage at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County until it was described in 2011. The length of the fetus is around 40 percent of the length of the mother. Gestation was probably two thirds complete based on what is known of the fetal development of related nothosaurs. This fossil suggests that Polycotylus was viviparous, giving live birth (as opposed to laying eggs). Viviparity, or live birth, may have been the most common form of reproduction in plesiosaurs, as they would have had difficulty laying eggs on land. Their bodies are not adapted to movement on land, and paleontologists have long hypothesized that they must have given birth in water. Other marine reptiles such as ichthyosaurs also gave live birth, but LACM 129639 was the first direct evidence of vivipary in plesiosaurs. The lives of Polycotylus and other plesiosaurs were K-selected, meaning that few offspring were born to each individual but those that were born were cared for as they mature. Because it gave birth to a single large offspring, the mother Polycotylus probably gave it some form of parental care for it to survive. F. Robin O'Keefe, one of the describers of LACM 129639, suggested that the social lives of plesiosaurs were \\"more similar to those of modern dolphins than other reptiles.\\" K-selected life-history strategies are also seen in mammals and some lizards, but are unusual among reptiles. Examination of the fetus of Polycotylus indicates that while in the womb, plesiosaurs sacrificed fetal bone strength for accelerated growth rates. Histological analysis and comparisons with another plesiosaur, Dolichorhynchops, showed that some plesiosaur infantss were up to forty percent the length of the mother when born, and that infant plesiosaurs may have had some compromised swimming abilities.

Three founding band mates were all from an earlier hard rock band, Deathwish: Ian John Cunningham on bass guitar (later on lead vocals), Calum \\"Cal\\" McAlpine on drums and Bruce Friday on guitar. They were soon joined by Iain Weaver on lead vocals (died 1995). The Chosen Few formed in the Mornington Peninsula and played a combination of covers of United States-influenced punk (MC5, Stooges) and hard driven original numbers inspired by Lobby Loyde and the Coloured Balls and The Saints. In 1978 The Chosen Few released a six-track extended play, The Jokes on Us. It was recorded in a studio in Smith Street, Collingwood, with Baron Rolls as audio engineer. The band played regularly around the Melbourne and Adelaide punk scenes but disbanded in May 1979. They joined Bohdan X (ex-JAB) as Bohdan and the Instigators but they broke up by late 1980. There was a short lived reunion of The Chosen Few in 1998 with a new line up: Cunningham, now on lead vocals, and McAlpine, were joined by Bill Blanche on bass guitar and Jeff Hussey on lead guitar. Two albums were released in that year: Do the Manic (Buckwheat Headlock Productions/Existential Vacuum Records, US) and A Root and a Beer (Au Go Go Records). They were followed by a double-CD album, Really Gonna Punch You Out (Hate Records, Italy), in 2001. The band revived briefly in 2018 with the following membership: Ian Cunningham (lead vocals), Jeff Hussey (guitar), Calum Hussey (guitar), Brad Barry (bass) and Alessandro Coco (drums). The band rehearsed for a couple of months intending to play at a punk festival but that event did not eventuate.

Family background Patrick Joseph Noel Purcell was the son of auctioneer Pierce Purcell and his second wife Catherine (n√©e Hoban) of 4 Ashbrook Terrace, South Circular Road, Dublin. He was born on 23 December 1900 and baptised six days later at St Kevin's Church, Harrington Street. Within a few months, the Purcell family had moved to 12 Mercer Street Lower.1901 census, nationalarchives.ie. Retrieved 4 May 2016. In 1911, the family was living at the same address, but the household was headed by Noel's maternal grandmother, Julia Hoban, a furniture dealer. Purcell was educated at Synge Street CBS. He lost the tip of his right index finger while making cigarette vending machines, and was also missing his entire left index finger due to a different accident while he was an apprentice carpenter, a feature which he exploited for dramatic effect in the film Mutiny on the Bounty (1962). Career Plaque in Noel Purcell Walk in Dublin, Ireland Purcell began his show business career at the age of 12 in Dublin's Gaiety Theatre. Later, he toured Ireland in a vaudeville act with Jimmy O'Dea.\\"Noel Purcell dies in Dublin aged 84\\", The Irish Times, 4 March 1985. Stage-trained in the classics in Dublin, Purcell moved into films in 1934. He appeared in Captain Boycott (1947) and as the elderly sailor whose death marooned the lovers-to-be in the first sound film version of The Blue Lagoon (1949). He played a member of Captain Ahab's crew in Moby Dick (1956), Dan O'Flaherty in episode one, The Majesty of the Law, of The Rising of the Moon (1957), a gamekeeper in The List of Adrian Messenger (1963), and a barman in The Mackintosh Man (1973); the last two films were directed by John Huston. In 1955, he was an off-and-on regular on the British filmed TV series The Buccaneers (released to American TV in 1956) and Purcell narrated a Hibernian documentary, Seven Wonders of Ireland (1959). In 1962, he portrayed the lusty William McCoy in Lewis Milestone's Mutiny on the Bounty. He played a taciturn Irish in-law to Lebanese American entertainer Danny Thomas' character Danny Williams in a 1963 episode of The Danny Thomas Show. In 1971, he played the caring rabbi in the children's musical drama Flight of the Doves. He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1958 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre. Purcell also gained some recognition as a singer. Shortly after the Second World War, songwriter Leo Maguire composed \\"The Dublin Saunter\\" for him. He performed the song live for many years and later recorded it for the Glenside label. However, the recording was not a hit. As Purcell recalled many years later, \\"I don't think one person in the world bought it.\\" However, over time it became one of the most favourite songs about Dublin, receiving countless air-plays on radio programmes. In his latter years, Purcell was asked by RT√â journalist Colm Connolly whether he had received many royalties down the years. Purcell replied: \\"Not a penny. I recorded it as a favour for a pal, Leo Maguire, who'd written it.

He was a team-mate of Rik Van Looy and of Jacques Anquetil and, in the Tour de France, of Tom Simpson. He was the first British rider to win a stage of the Giro, before finishing 40th overall.  Origins  Denson in 1960 Denson was born in Chester, England. He had his first bike at 12, a black Hercules Falcon borrowed from his brother and with wooden blocks fitted to the pedals to make it smaller.Cycling, UK, 1 March 1969, p18 He began riding to Helsby Hill, Rhyl and Prestatyn and went youth-hostelling. At 17 he joined Chester Road Club, initially for touring but then to race. He was inspired by his French teacher at school, who had lived in France, whose hero was Jean Robic and who gave his class Miroir du Cyclisme to study.Cycling, UK, 8 March 1969, p14 Denson's first race was an evening 25-mile time-trial, which he finished in 1h 4 m 30s. He said: Denson finished four times in the top 12 of the British Best All-Rounder competition, which aggregates rides over 50 and 100 miles and 12 hours. He came seventh in the Milk Race in 1959 and fifth in 1960. He finished the Peace Race of 1960 and 1961 in 17th and 27th. The Peace Race, which linked Berlin, Warsaw and Prague was run over roads often still wrecked from the Second World War. It was always keenly contested by riders from the communist bloc. Denson said:  Semi-professional career  Denson failed to make the British team for the Olympic GamesCycling, UK, 15 March 1969, p17 and took out a licence as an independent, or semi- professional, for Temple Cycles in 1961.

Only three of the team ‚Äì Laidlaw, Brian Robinson and Seamus Elliott got to the finish. Denson dropped out on the col de la R√©publique, also known as the col du Grand Bois, outside St-√âtienne.

In March 1962 they decided to return to France, travelling to Paris and then to Troyes, where Denson joined the UVC Aube club, sponsored by Frimatic. He was paid ¬£24 a month. He won the GP Frimatic by four minutes and then the eight-day Vuelta Bidasoa, in Spain. He won a stage of a professional race, the Circuit d'Aquitaine in France and came sixth in the Grand Prix des Nations despite being led off course and twice losing his chain. Of his Circuit of Aquitaine ride, he said:  Professional career  Denson's club recommended him to Maurice de Muer, manager of the Pelforth- Sauvage Lejeune professional team. De Muer promised him a contract if he won a stage of the Circuit d'Aquitaine and rode well in the Grand Prix des Nations. Denson signed with Pelforth in October 1963, when he was 27, riding in the yellow, white and blue of the French brewery and its cosponsor, a bicycle factory. He was the second Englishman in the team, with Alan Ramsbottom. He came 10th in Milan‚ÄìSan Remo and in Paris‚ÄìNice but didn't make Pelforth's Tour team. Denson was already unhappy with Pelforth, where the policy was to pay riders' salaries at the end and not during the season.Cycling, UK, 5 April 1969, p20 He was already reduced to eating carrots found in fields while training. Not riding the Tour was a further financial blow. He left Troyes in 1964, hoping for a place with Tom Simpson in the Peugeot team. When the place didn't become free, he moved to Ghent, in Belgium. There, if he couldn't ride for Simpson he could at least train with him. In races, however, they would be rivals; Denson was to ride for Rik Van Looy in the Solo team, sponsored by a margarine company. He was the only foreigner in the team and never did master the Dutch that the rest of team spoke.Cycling, UK, 26 April 1969, p16 The team won six stages of that year's Tour de France. That autumn, at the world championship at Sallanches, France, Jacques Anquetil and his directeur- sportif, Rapha√´l G√©miniani, said they had been watching Denson and wanted him for a team they were creating, sponsored by Ford-France. Denson stayed with Anquetil when the sponsor changed to Bic, opened a bar in Ghent, and had what he called the happiest years of his racing life.  Simpson's death  Denson rode for Britain in the 1967 Tour de France. During it, his friend Tom Simpson died close to the summit of Mont Ventoux. He said of the hours at the hotel waiting for news of his leader: Next day the French rider, Jean Stablinski, said the remaining riders wanted Denson, as Simpson's closest friend, to ride ahead of the race and win for Simpson. The victory went instead to Barry Hoban, who said he found himself at the front but remembers nothing else.The Independent, UK, 12 July 2003 Denson is still upset. Denson lost heart, began missing contracts.Cycling, UK, 17 May 1969, p21 He recovered by the end of the year and talked to the Italian team, Molteni, about joining. Instead he signed for Kelvinator to ride the Giro d'Italia. A year later (1968) he returned to Britain and rode for the domestic professional team, Bantel.  Giro d'Italia  Denson won a stage of the Giro d'Italia, stage 9 in 1966 before finishing 40th overall. He said: Denson said Italian fans often made a pretence of helping push foreign riders up hills while pulling at their brakes to slow them down. He said his time-trialling experience helped him chase riders like Motta.  Private life and retirement  In 1969 Denson opened a wood- treatment business near Harlow, Essex, before dropping out of professional racing. He now races as an amateur. Denson was known in continental Europe as Vic, a name he acquired because Vin ‚Äì short for Vincent ‚Äì is French for \\"wine\\".

Other similar writings by the pseudonymous Poor Robin were published later, in America and into the 19th century. Origins The earliest volume published under the pseudonym of 'Poor Robin' was an almanac calculated from the meridian of Saffron Walden, which is said to have been originally issued in 1661 or 1662. It was taken over by the Stationers' Company, and was continued annually by various hands until 1776. The identity of its original author has been disputed, but is assigned as William Winstanley by Sidney Lee, in the Dictionary of National Biography, who dismisses the claim that Robert Herrick wrote it. He notes the discovery in the parish registers of Saffron Walden for 14 March 1646-7 relating to Robert Winstanley (a nephew of William and a younger brother of Henry Winstanley) but argues that Robert would still have been a boy when the first almanacs were written; a listing for Robert's publications was given by H. Eckroyd Smith.Notes and Queries, ser. vi. vol. 7, pp. 325-3.A. H. Bullen, A Christmas Garland (London: John C. Nimmo, 1885), p. 214. on line. On internal grounds, namely the verse style of William Winstanley in his known works, Lee argues for the latter, and mentions a 1667 portrait of William Winstanley with caption 'Poor Robin,' with verses by Francis Kirkman, in a volume called Poor Robin's Jests, or the Compleat Jester'. In the Dictionary of National Biography article on Robert Pory, by Joseph Hirst Lupton, it is said that Pory, at the time of the first edition in 1663 archdeacon of Middlesex, had his name taken in vain with the claim that he had licensed the almanac. Another volume in verse by 'Poor Robin,' in which the tone of John Taylor the water-poet is closely followed, was called Poor Robin's Perambulation from Saffron Walden to London performed this Month of July 1678 (London, 1678,); the doggerel poem deals largely with the alehouses on the road, and Lee assigns it to William Winstanley. Content \\"Poor Robin\\" established a tradition of parody, reporting the trivial and inconsequential juxtaposed with the serious, in parallel chronologies--set in rhymed couplets--of the \\"Loyal\\" and the \\"Fanatic\\", which began in 1663 and became Old Poor Robin with the 1777 issue.Frank Palmeri, Satire, History, Novel: Narrative Forms, 1665-1815, (University of Delaware Press) 2003, \\"Poor Robin\\", pp 51ff. Poor Robin offered deadpan prognostications of the obvious, and substituted parodic saints' days under the \\"Fanatic\\" rubric. From the turn of the 18th century, the satire becomes blunted and wise homilies of prudence take their place. It observes the continued use of cucking stools in 1746.

It is dedicated to St Nicholas, the patron saint of fishermen. The church is a Grade II* listed building. It is of Early English and Perpendicular architecture. The church sits on an island in the centre of the town and is the main focal point for miles around. The buttressed tower dates from 1360, but the site had been used since the 13th century in the times of Henry I. History The church was built in the 12th century with the tower being rebuilt in 1360. Thomas Draper bought the church from the Abbot of Shrewsbury in 1452 but it was not until 1700 that it gained its land and the rectory was endowed. The red brick north and south aisles were added in the 18th century. Galleries and gas lighting was added in 1837. The chancel was rebuilt in 1866. The church has been restored twice, the south side in 1883 and the north side from 1890 by John Norton. The west porch was built in 1904, a gift from Lady Boughey. Restoration work to the church was undertaken in the 1880s, by John Norton, to restore it to its current condition. In 1998 the priest, Roy Hibbert, was found guilty of fraud after overcharging parishioners for funerals and other services. For the 2019 Remembrance Day 200 poppies were knitted for the church. =Notable clergy= *Michael Beasley, later Bishop of Hertford. Architecture The sandstone building consists of a chancel, south chapel, nave with aisles and a west tower. The stained glass includes a window in the chancel by Morris & Co. with Burne-Jones figures. One in the south chapel is by Charles Eamer Kempe. The tower has 8 bells hung from wooden headstocks. Five of the bells were cast by Thomas Mears of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in London in 1812. The two most recent were cast by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough in 1952. In the churchyard is a sandstone memorial cross with brass plaques commemorating the men form the town who lost their lives in World War I and World War II.

Joan's is situated in an area popular with Angelenos for its eating and shopping establishments, located between the Beverly Center on La Cienega Boulevard and Farmer's Market at the Grove on Fairfax Avenue. A family business owned and operated by chef Joan McNamara and her children, Carol McNamara Glass and Susie Hastings, Joan's started out as a catering operation running out of a storefront on Third St. As demand grew, McNamara expanded her business to include a small caf√© and marketplace. The store tripled its size after a decade of operation, and the restaurant now includes a full menu for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The shop in the same space sells artisan cheeses, prepared foods, baked goods, desserts and non-perishables. Its popularity and success has grown on the strength of its products and good reviews in multiple publications and media outlets. It also has a reputation as a hip gathering spot frequented by Hollywood celebrities and foodies, such as Robert Duvall, Jake Gyllenhaal and Moon Zappa. When the lines get too long and customers are waiting, Joan has been known to rush out with a tray of cupcakes for everyone. History Interior of Joan's on Third, the cheese counter Joan McNamara, namesake of Joan's, is a chef originally from New York, where she ran a cooking school and her own restaurant before moving to L.A. She opened Joan's in 1995 as a catering company located in a storefront on West Third St. Joan's two daughters, Carol, a graduate of the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration, and Susie, an alumna of the Georgetown University School of Business, also run the business, with Carol running the Catering and Special Events arm of the business, and Susie overseeing Operations. San Francisco chef Chester Hastings came to work at the store in 1997 and eventually married Susie McNamara. In 1998 Joan's expanded into an adjacent storefront on Third Street, helping to realize Ms. MacNamara's \\"lifelong dream of opening a gourmet foods marketplace and caf√©.\\" Another major expansion took place in 2007 that helped expand the scope of the company's operations by tripling the floor space of the market. Beside being a market, Joan's is also a full-service restaurant providing table service and take-out meals for it patrons. Often very busy, Joan's has been described as being reminiscent of some famous New York restaurants, including Zabar's, Dean & DeLuca, and Fairway Market. Joan's on Third exterior Joan's has a full-service cheese counter, dessert bar, assortment of chocolates; and a food counter where sandwiches, ready-to-eat foods, salads and snacks are offered. An assortment of dry goods and refrigerated products are also offered. The owners travel extensively to source products.  Reviews  Front fa√ßade of Joan's on Third New York Breakfast Sandwich The restaurant has generally been given favorable reviews in several publications and news outlets, including the New York Times, CNN and Time magazine. A Los Angeles Times review noted that Joan's is the \\"rare in LA specialty foods store\\" that \\"stocks essentials -- salt-cured anchovies sold by the ounce, capers under salt, ricotta cheese, fleur de sel (a specialty sea salt from France), and imported De Cecco brand pasta\\" and \\"a small selection of carefully chosen cheeses, such as locally made burrata, English Cotswold, or a truffle-infused Boschetto.\\" =Criticism= While the Los Angeles Times reviewer stated that the food was \\"above average\\", she also noted that \\"It [the restaurant] is somewhat disorganized. When there's a rush (i.e., more than a handful of customers), the servers behind the counter can sometimes get flustered, and it seems to take longer than it should to put together an order.\\" The Zagat Survey lists Joan's as a Top Bakery in the US and the customer reviews posted on the website are mostly positive, with one poster calling Joan's offerings \\"fun and delicious, albeit expensive, snacks, cheeses, etc.\\"; however a couple of other commentators stated it is \\"overrated\\" and \\"overpriced\\". Other customer criticisms center around customer service, the order taking system, food quality, price and value. The Los Angeles Daily News Food Editor on LA.com noted the crowded conditions in Joan's and warned that \\"At busy times, it can be difficult to snag a table - and the frenetic pace and wait to order at the counter may not appeal to some. Parking is sometimes difficult to come by.\\" =Celebrities= The company has been noted as being popular among several celebrities and gourmands who live in the southlands of California. Writing for The New York Times, Moon Zappa described Joan's on Third as her favorite Los Angeles eatery. The restaurant is also a favorite of Jake Gyllenhaal, who has been seen dining there with ex-girlfriend Kirsten Dunst.

Photogravure published in Camera Work, No 7, 1904 Mary Devens: Charcoal Effect. Photogravure published in Camera Notes, Vol 6 No 1, January 1902 Life Devens was born on 17 May 1857 in Ware, Massachusetts, the daughter of Arthur Lithgow Devens and Agnes Howard White Devens. She grew up in Cambridge, Massachusetts and developed an interest in photography sometime in early life. She had a strong interest in printing techniques that could be manipulated by the photographer, including ozotype, gum bichromate and platinum printing. She mastered the gum bichomate process so well that she gave a lecture on it to the Cambridge Photographic Club in 1896. At some point before her mid-30s, Devens met Boston photographer F. Holland Day, who influenced her career through encouragement and advocacy of her work. He personally submitted five of her prints to the London Photographic Salon of 1898 and was responsible for introducing her to photographer Alfred Stieglitz, with whom she would regularly correspond for many years. Day also promoted her work in his famous lecture \\"Photography as Fine Art\\" at the Harvard Camera Club in 1900 and included several of her prints in his 1901 exhibition ‚ÄúThe New School of American Photography.‚Äù Devens traveled to Europe in 1900-1901, and there she met Edward Steichen and Robert Demachy. Demachy was so impressed with her work that he added several of her photographs to the important Paris exhibition of women photographers organized by Frances Benjamin Johnston. In 1902 Devens was elected to Britain‚Äôs Linked Ring, and Stieglitz listed her as a founding member of the Photo-Secession. That same year Stieglitz also listed her as one of the ten most prominent American pictorial photographers in an article in Century Magazine. He also published one of her photographs in his famous journal Camera Work. About this same time Devens‚Äô eyesight began to fail rapidly due to an unknown cause. After 1904 she showed only a few prints in exhibitions, although Stieglitz included her work in the inaugural exhibition at his Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession in 1905. She is not known to have engaged in any photographic activity after 1905. Devens died on 13 March 1920 in Cambridge. A memorial exhibition of her work was held soon after her passing in 1920 by the Society of Arts and Crafts.

It aims to provide efficient and streamlined base calculations, while at the same time having a straightforward and easy-to-use interface. Its intended target users are scientists and engineers. It supports integer, floating point (single and double precision), complex numbers, and a subset of trigonometric and statistics functions. Dense and sparse matrices are supported. Various matrix decompositions are provided through optional integration with Linear Algebra PACKage (LAPACK), Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software (ATLAS), and ARPACK. High-performance BLAS/LAPACK replacement libraries such as OpenBLAS and Intel MKL can also be used. The library employs a delayed-evaluation approach (during compile time) to combine several operations into one and reduce (or eliminate) the need for temporaries. Where applicable, the order of operations is optimised. Delayed evaluation and optimisation are achieved through template metaprogramming. Armadillo is related to the Boost Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (uBLAS) library, which also uses template metaprogramming. However, Armadillo builds upon ATLAS and LAPACK libraries, thereby providing machine-dependent optimisations and functions not present in uBLAS.

The documentary takes an insider look at the changing social landscape in Beijing through the eyes of its local urbanites, right as the largest urbanization in history floods China's cities with more and more outsiders. The film's sociological importance lies in its illustration of how soft power and censorship in the mainland Chinese music industry have forced many young talented Chinese musicians and artists to either embrace talent companys' blend of censorship and commercialism completely, or remain underground in obscurity, and banned from performing, in many cases. This choice has forced many young artists to adopt attitudes of self-censorship towards their own music and thought if they wish to remain relevant on a national level, or, conversely, remain underground, on the internet, in the shadows. From 2005 until 2012, Wang worked as a video journalist in the Beijing bureau of The New York Times.

He is credited with pioneering and patronizing early post-Independence mountaineering in India, and was the founder principal of the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute. He encouraged the youth of India to take up mountaineering, and has been called the \\"Marco Polo of Indian Mountaineering\\". Education and early life Jayal began his mountaineering career while he was a student at The Doon School, where his teachers encouraged his interest in climbing as a way to tame his somewhat unruly nature.For Hills to Climb, The Doon School Contribution to Mountaineering ‚Äì The Early Years. Edited by Aamir Ali. Pp 421. [Published by The Doon School Old Boys' SocietyThe Dosco Record, Second Edition 1987. Compiled by Col. P.C. Khanna, published by the Doon School Old Boys Society Jayal's first major expedition as a 16-year-old schoolboy was to the Awar Valley above Badrinath, reaching 6,000 meters. Other climbs, while still at Doon, included Trisul with Gurdial Singh, a teacher from Doon. While Singh went on to reach the peak of Trisul, where he performed a headstand asana to honor the Hindu god Shiva, Jayal noted his own feelings in lyrical terms: \\"The grass on which we camped was like a cushion sprinkled with tiny mauve primula and the gentle lapping of the running water recalled melodies from Beethoven‚Äôs Pastoral Symphony. I confess a desire to bring my efforts to an honourable conclusion here ‚Äì as long as somebody got to the top ‚Äì and revel in this bracing and saner altitude.\\"https://www.alpinejournal.org.uk/Contents/Contents_1964_files/AJ%201964%20201-210%20Gibson%20Himalaya.pdf It was a remarkable transformation of Doon's most delinquent boy who had become a \\"gentle, perfect knight\\"For Hills to Climb, reviewed in the Himalayan Club Career In 1948, Nandu Jayal went to Switzerland and acquired a Ski Teacher's Certificate, a very respectable achievement. He was appointed Chief Instructor at the Winter Warfare School, later known as the High Altitude and Winter Warfare School. Under the leadership of the Engineer-in-Chief, Maj. Gen. Harold 'Bill' Williams, himself an eager climber, Nandu Jayal organised the first Sappers expedition to Bandarpunch successfully in 1950. As a young Captain in 1950‚Äì51, he carried out a strategic reconnaissance of the Garhwal Himalayas and was later the Indian Army liaison officer for the French Expedition to Nanda Devi in 1951. He organised and led two expeditions to Kamet; the first in 1952 when the summit team was forced back by a blizzard from just 600 metres short of the mountain and later in 1955 when he summitted - at that point of time, it was the highest that an Indian had climbed. Jayal was the founder principal of the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute at Darjeeling, with Tenzing Norgay of Everest fame as the Chief Instructor. Both of them were invited by the Swiss Government to Switzerland where they spent three months seeing new things and having new experiences. Maj Jayal became the only non-Swiss to win the coveted Swiss Guide's Diploma and Badge. Jayal led the 1955 Kamet expedition as the Director HMI. Jayal organised an expedition to Nanda Devi in 1957. Bad weather thwarted the expedition but Jayal, never one to give up, went next to the Karakoram where he conquered Saken (24,130 ft) and Sakang (24,150 ft), the third highest peak in the Karakoram range. Death In 1958, the Government sponsored an expedition to Cho Oyu (28,867 ft), one of the highest mountains of the world. Jayal died of pulmonary oedema caused by overexertion on this expedition at Camp I. He had started late and tried to catch up with the main party. There was also a problem in his medical care as much of the expedition equipment had been lost in a Dakota crash en route to Nepal. His death and that of some others brought home the cruel lesson of need for acclimatisation and discipline in the pursuit of Himalayan mountaineering. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the Prime Minister of India, paid rich tributes to Jayal saying \\"the Major has set an example of courage and adventure which should inspire our young people. The news of his death came to me as a shock and I feel that the country has suffered the loss of her finest mountaineer...\\" Arthur Foot, Jayal's Headmaster of Doon, noted that \\"The Himalaya completed his education into a stature of nobility\\", echoing a sentiment expressed two years earlier by Jayal himself who had noted, after an expedition to Saser Kangri, that \\"Pushing the body to the utmost for something indefinably inherent in a person, is intrinsically noble and worthwhile.\\" R.L. Holdsworth, a teacher at Doon who had encouraged Jayal to pursue mountaineering noted after his death that \\"He died very much the master of himself and of most of the world that is worth mastering.\\" The Indian Mountaineering Foundation had a Nandu Jayal Fund and published, along with the Corps of Engineers, a book Nandu Jayal and Indian Mountaineering, which contained articles on various aspects of Indian Mountaineering by him and by others. Nandu Jayal's life and career motivated many young officers of the Corps to take up mountaineering, most prominent of whom were his nephews, Harsh Vardhan Bahuguna and Jai Vardhan Bahuguna ; both were officers of the Indian Army, dedicated mountaineers and both died on Mount Everest.

However, she found that \\"unless you were really set up for it, it wasn't very profitable to make your own bread.

The facility prepares par-baked bread, dough that has been 80% baked and then quick-frozen for baking later, and employed around 100 people in 1999. La Brea breads are widely available throughout Southern California and are sold in many supermarkets, but the original small storefront remains popular with Angelenos craving its artisanal fresh baked goods.

The route is long. U.S. 75 Alternate is also sporadically signed as U.S. 75A and State Highway 75A. The highway begins at U.S. 75 east of Beggs and travels west to that town, where it turns north. It runs through the towns of Mounds and Kiefer before reaching Sapulpa. In Sapulpa, its northern terminus is explicitly signed at an intersection with State Highway 66 and other state highways, but official Oklahoma Department of Transportation maps show it extending northeast along SH-66 until the point where it merges with I-44. U.S. 75 followed what is now U.S. 75 Alternate prior to 1959.

She received recent attention with the scholarly publication of Hartly House Calcutta (1789) in 2007.Although Gibbes is little- published in recent years, access to at least ten of her novels' original publications is available on \\"Eighteenth Century Collections Online.\\" Biography Phebe Gibbes possesses one of the most elusive histories of the 18th-century women writers. Almost all of the information on Gibbes' life is derived from an application to the Royal Literary Fund for financial support in 1804.BL MSS: Royal Literary Fund 2: p. 74, letter of 14 October 1804. See The Feminist Companion to Literature in English: Women Writers from the Middle Ages to Present, Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements, and Isobel Grundy, eds. (London: Batsford, 1990), p. 420. As noted in her application, Gibbes, a widow for most of her life, married early and mothered two daughters and one son. One can conjecture that she spent part of her life in British India, as some of her novels, particularly Hartly House, avow a markedly accurate knowledge of Indian lifestyle as perceived through contemporary records. It is also known that Gibbes' son never returned from a military mission in India,Jonathan Warner Gibbs, Lieutenant in the Bengal Infantry, died 3 February 1785; V.C.P. Hodson, List of the Officers of the Bengal Army, 1754‚Äì1834, 4 Vols (London: Constable, 1927), 2: p. 263. a fact that is manifest in her later writing; she writes in the first lines of Hartly House, ‚Äúthe Eastern world is, as you pronounce it, the grave of thousands‚Äù.‚ÄúLetter I,‚Äù Hartly House, Calcutta (1689). Michael J. Franklin, ed. New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2007. The financial mismanagement of Gibbes‚Äô father-in-law, a compulsive gambler,From Gibbes‚Äô petitions to the Royal Literary Fund (see above). was the eventual cause of her extreme poverty; parental neglect and a strong aversion to gambling are manifest in many of Gibbes' novels. Career =Author= Gibbes first entered the world of English literature with a double-debut in 1764: the controversial The Life and Adventures of Mr. Francis Clive (1764) and the epistolary novel, History of Lady Louisa Stroud, and the Honorable Miss Caroline Stretton (1764). Three years after her debut, Gibbes published two novels, The Woman of Fashion; or, the History of Lady Diana Dormer (1767) and The History of Miss Pittsborough (1767), a novel especially lauded by the Critical Review as \\"chaste\\" and \\"virtuous\\".Critical Review, 25 (1767), pp. 132‚Äì5, p. 135. Two years later, Gibbes published The History of Miss Somerville (1769); The Fruitless Repentance; or, the History of Miss Kitty Le Fever (1769), and The History of Miss Eliza Musgrove (1769). The Critical Review wrote positively of Miss Eliza Musgrove, citing Gibbes' novel as \\"equal in genius to Lennox, Brookes, and Scott.\\"Charlotte Lennox, Frances Brooke, and Sarah Scott were beloved female writers of the time. Critical Review, 27 (1769), pp. 452‚Äì9, p. 452. Gibbes continued to produce novels until Hartly House, Calcutta in 1789; she may have created works into the 1790s, but if so they are unverified or also attributed to other writers. Gibbes claims, in her 1804 application to the Royal Literary Fund, some 22 titles; but only 14 of Gibbes' novels (or potential novels) are actually traceable. Like many writers of her time,See: The English Novel, 1770‚Äì1829: a Bibliographical Survey of Prose Fiction Published in the British Isles, 2 Vols. Peter Garside, James Raven, and Rainer Schowerling, eds. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000. she wrote anonymously, with the exception of The Niece; or the History of Sukey Thornby (1788), which she signed \\"Mrs. P. Gibbes\\".From Michael J. Franklin's introduction to Hartly House, Calcutta. New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2007. Gibbes‚Äô writing provides descriptive accounts of her visits to India and the American continent. She names the precise titles of the servants and the exact prices of items. Her work therefore provides a resource for Indologists. Gibbes in her later life earned her living by writing. She appears to cherish the epicurean lifestyles of the contemporary upper-class, while also critiquing the gross materialism of her era. She often describes a lush material culture, and at the same time causes her protagonist to reject that culture. =Social protests= Several contemporary issues surface multiple times in Gibbes' writing: child neglect, lack of female education, acquisitiveness, gambling, and personal vanity. Many of her heroines, particularly Sophia 'Goldborne' ‚Äì a somewhat onomastic name ‚Äì are stark contrasts to the materialistic, indulgent culture of the time, as discussed above; and yet at the same time, appear to relish female materialism. One can see in this scene in which Gibbes creates a vivid picture of extravagance, this slightly awe-filled distaste at both the foolishness and the power involved in materialism, :\\"The Europe shops, as you will naturally conclude, are those ware-houses where all the British finery imported is displayed and purchased; and such is the spirit of many ladies upon visiting them, that there have been :instances of their spending 30 or 40,000 rupees [about 5000 pounds]One pound amounted to around eight rupees. in one morning, for the decoration of their persons; on which account many husbands are observed to turn pale as ashes, on the bare mention of their wives :being seen to enter them: but controul is not a matrimonial rule at Calcutta; and the men are obliged to make the best of their conjugal mortifications.‚ÄùFrom a description of the beisars‚Äô district, or marketplace, ‚ÄúLetter VII,‚Äù Hartly House, Calcutta. J. Franklin, ed. New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2007. One can conclude that these scenes serve to express her distaste for the ‚Äòmaterialistic‚Äô nature of some English women; and yet, Gibbes finds a power in this ability for women to ‚Äòcontrol‚Äô their spouses or fathers through expenditure. Gibbes is especially known for her protests against the lack of early education for girls. Gibbes was particularly inspired by the comparatively free lifestyle for women in America, and in fact was sometimes construed as a Republican.See in particular Critical Review, 46 (October 1778), 1: pp. 15‚Äì18., which cites Gibbes as a 'Republican' on account of her zest for American freedom. In Her Friendship in a Nunnery; or, The American Fugitive, the narrator, a fourteen-year-old American girl, is so well-spoken and eloquent that the Critical Review reviled the novel, writing, \\"what may not be expected from the old men and sages of [America], when its maidens, its babes and sucklings talk, write, and reason thus!\\"Critical Review, 46 (October 1778), 1: pp. 15‚Äì18. William Enfield, a well-regarded Unitarian minister and writer, however, applauded her novel as having, :\\"so much truth‚Ä¶ that it merits attention in an age, in which it is become too fashionable for females to receive the last finishing of their education in a convent.\\"Monthly Review, 60 (April 1779), p. 324. One must also note as particularly feministic, the accidentally bigamous marriage of Elfrida, in the eponymous novel Elfrida, and the incredible death of Hannah, the household servant in Mr. Francis Clive, who suffers a painful and protracted demise after imbibing a faulty abortifacient (abortion-inducing poultice) from an apothecary when she becomes pregnant with Clive's child.Noted especially by Isobel Grundy in \\"(Re)discovering women's texts,\\" in Women and Literature in Britain, 1700‚Äì1800, Vivien Jones, ed. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000, pp. 179‚Äì96; pp. 190‚Äì91. These kinds of outrageous, yet plausible, situations left Gibbes‚Äô novels as somewhat polemic in the time period; and, clearly, it is hardly precocious to call her an early feminist. The social protestation of these types of double standards for males and females amazingly pre-dates those reactionary works of the later feminist writers, such as Mary Hays and Mary Wollstonecraft, by nearly forty years. It is unquestionable that the later feminists of the late 18th and early 19th century, particularly Wollstonecraft who reviewed Gibbes' work with delight, were inspired in part by this prodigal 18th century author.

Sylvan Simon and starring Ida Lupino and Glenn Ford. The film is about the legendary Lost Dutchman gold mine, starring Ford as the \\"Dutchman\\" and Lupino as the woman he loves. The historical events are seen through a framing device set in the contemporary 1940s. It was based on the book Thunder God's Gold by Barry Storm. Part of the film was shot on location in Arizona's Superstition Mountains. Plot In modern times, a newspaper reports that \\"noted explorer and writer\\" Floyd Buckley claims to have discovered the location of the lost gold mine. He is approached by Barry Storm, who believes he has some claim to it, as the Dutchman was his grandfather. Buckley brushes him off, but when he heads into the Superstition Mountains, Storm secretly follows him. However, an unseen killer shoots Buckley, making him the fourth recent murder victim. Storm notifies Sheriff Early and his deputy Covin. Covin tells Storm more about the mine; a hundred years before, Pedro Peralta had hidden $20 million in gold in the most inaccessible of his mines, only to be killed by the Apaches for defiling a place holy to their \\"thunder god\\". His greed whetted, Storm investigates further. A flashback follows. In 1880, Jacob \\"Dutchy\\" Walz and his friend Wiser overhear Ludi carelessly call his companion \\"Peralta\\". Recognizing the name, they trail the pair into the mountains. After Ramon Peralta finds his brother's mine, Walz and Wiser gun the two other men down in cold blood; then Walz treacherously shoots Wiser too. When Walz returns to Phoenix with huge gold nuggets, the news spreads quickly. Scheming, discontented Julia Thomas becomes acquainted with Walz, without telling him she is married to Pete. His suspicions of her motives are allayed by the fact that she can speak German. They soon fall in love. When she finally tells him about her husband, Walz gives her money to bribe Pete into giving her a divorce. However, Walz later learns that Julia has lied to him repeatedly. Unseen, he watches as Julia placates her husband by telling him she will soon learn the location of the mine. Walz gives Julia directions to the treasure. Though Julia seems to care for Walz, Pete forces her to show him the map. When the couple reach the mine, Walz pins them down with his rifle. In the ensuing gunfight, Pete eventually runs out of bullets. Walz cruelly toys with them, letting them go without water. Finally, Julia stabs Pete in the back and pleads with Walz to believe she loves him. Before he can act, an earthquake triggers a rockfall that crushes her and closes the mine. The film returns to the present. Storm has uncovered enough information that he believes he knows where the mine is. When he gets to the key landmark, he encounters Covin, who pulls a gun on him. It turns out that the deputy has been searching for the mine for twenty years and has been disposing of his competitors. A fight breaks out; Covin is about to push Storm off the mountain when a poisonous snake bites him; he falls to his death. Afterwards, Sheriff Early points out that, even with the new clue, Storm does not know the exact location and would have to dig up the entire mountainside. At that point, Storm gives up the search.

Historia Guardamar A large piece of a stone rodete (wheel headgear) was found first, at a shallow depth. There followed other fragments of the bust of an Iberian lady, and one large piece included the headdress, face and neck, which were found to have similarities to the Iberian bust, Lady of Elche. The sculpture had been hammered to fragments and even burnt in places. These fragments were taken to the laboratory of the Provincial Archaeological Museum of Alicante, where restorer Vincent Bernabeu began with washing and identifying the bits, first the chin, then the lips, then collar and chest pieces, and many other fragments that did not fit together and were not part of the carved surface. The delicate and painstaking task of restoration began in October 1987, and was completed in June 1988. The restored sculpture is of fine-grained greyish limestone. The Lady is wearing a tunic with a round neckline. A scalloped headband crosses the brow and connects the rodetes, which represent hollow wheels, probably of thin metal, on each side. Above the headband and rodetes the Lady wears a mantle with finely carved drapery details. The necklaces the Lady wears are each different; one is composed of seven bullae which are all the same except for the central one, which is grooved. Below it is another necklace that has larger bullae, some shaped like curved triangles and some semicircular at the bottom. The string of beads worn second from the neck has olive-shaped, spherical and flat beads, above it is a string of spherical beads with two plates at the center. In real life these beads would have been made of glassy paste, as such beads often appeared in the Albufereta excavation. In style the Lady of Guardamar is a bit more archaic than the other contemporary Iberian sculptures Lady of Baza or the Lady of Elche, with features more Iberian. As nothing from the site is more recent than 300 BCE, and the site flourished between 430 and 350 BCE, it seems likely that the Lady dates from 400 to 370 BCE.

Housed in two brick buildings, the campus is located in the city's Health and Education District and adjacent to the Tuality Hospital/Southeast 8th Avenue light rail station. The campus of Tuality Community Hospital is across Baseline Street to the south.

In May 2005, the university purchased a half- acre of land from Tuality Healthcare next to Tuality Hospital for the campus.Pacific University expands to Hillsboro, Portland Business Journal, May 20, 2005. Plans called for an initial building to cost $30 million followed by a building, both constructed over a three- to five-year period. The Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center in Hillsboro was also to move into the building. The decision to move these programs from the main Forest Grove campus was made to move the programs closer to hospitals the programs had relationships with such as Oregon Health & Sciences University and Tuality Hospital. The move also allowed the university to have students closer to patients and to allow for the College of Liberal Arts to expand and its main campus.Smith, Kennedy. ‚ÄúPacific University approves construction of a Hillsboro campus extension‚Äù, Daily Journal of Commerce, April 6, 2005.

It is the third short film by actor-turned-director Yoo, and the first of his films to receive a public release. Lee Dae-yeon and Jo An star as the film's only characters.  Plot summary  An unnamed middle-aged man (Lee Dae-yeon) drives listlessly through downtown Seoul on a downcast summer afternoon, with the view outside, periodically glimpsed through the car windows, fuzzy and blurred. Sitting in the passenger seat next to him is Ok- gyeong (Jo An), a young woman some twenty years younger than he is. Although their dialogue is scarcely distinguishable with regard to its content, the two are engaged in a typical lover's quarrel. The woman is desperate to talk through their problems, but the man remains silent. Their drive along the highway is interrupted by memories of the past, which include dates taken by the lovers in the countryside, and surreal fantasy scenes where Ok-gyeong has her face painted like a mime artist.Yang Sun-jin. \\"Yoo Ji-tae juggles up two jobs as actor and filmmaker\\".

Retrieved 3 November 2008.  Production and casting  Out of My Intention is the third directorial project by Yoo Ji-tae, following his earlier short films Bike Boy and How Does the Blind Dream. Regarding the brevity and ambiguity afforded by the short film format, Yoo said, \\"If I had made the film into a full feature, I would have had to give all of the sundry reasons and episodes about their initial relationships\\". Actor Lee Dae-yeon admitted to being \\"a bit baffled\\" by the film's script, but felt compelled to take the part after Yoo told him it had been written with him in mind.  Themes and interpretations  Like Yoo's earlier shorts, the central theme in Out of My Intention is one of love. The film is a blend of past and present; though the two characters talk to each other constantly, the camera almost never captures them together in one frame. The man is actually \\"driving down memory lane\\" and reminiscing about his first love, his thoughts conjuring her back to life. While he has grown old and weary, Ok-gyeong remains young in his heart, suggesting that first love never dies.  Release  The press preview for Out of My Intention received an unusual level of interest, much to the surprise of director Yoo Ji-tae. The first of his films to be released theatrically, it opened on March 20, 2008 at the Gwanghwamun Spongehouse in Seoul, where it was given a limited screening.

As an amateur cricketer he played first-class cricket from 1825 to 1838. He changed his name to Herbert Jenner-Fust in 1864.CricketArchive profile. Retrieved on 4 November 2008. Life Herbert Jenner was the eldest son of the judge Herbert Jenner- Fust, Dean of the Arches. He was educated at Eton, where he was first noted as a schoolboy cricketer playing against Harrow School in 1822, and Trinity Hall, Cambridge. In 1827, he captained Cambridge University in the inaugural university match played at Lord's Cricket Ground.CricketArchive: match scorecard. Retrieved on 4 November 2008. Jenner entered Lincoln's Inn, and was called to the bar in 1831. He became an advocate of Doctors' Commons in 1835. Cricket career Jenner was an all-rounder who was right-handed as both batsman and bowler. He was an underarm bowler but his pace is unknown. He kept wicket when not bowling and is said to have been one of the \\"finest amateur wicketkeepers\\".Altham, p.68-69. In the 1820s, Jenner did not wear gloves or pads while keeping wicket.Birley, p.78. These protections were gradually introduced in response to the development of roundarm bowling from 1827. Until then, the role of the wicketkeeper had been \\"offensive\\" rather than \\"defensive\\" in that he was primarily concerned with looking for stumping chances, but the increased pace of roundarm forced wicketkeepers to improve their ability to stop the ball and so prevent byes. By 1836, the Kent wicketkeeper Ned Wenman was using gloves but it is not known if Jenner himself adopted them in the latter part of his career. In first-class cricket, he was associated with Cambridge University, Kent and Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). He played for several predominantly amateur teams including the Gentlemen in the Gentlemen v Players series. Jenner made 36 known appearances in first- class matches from 1825 to 1838. He scored 842 runs with a highest score of 75. He is credited with 75 wickets (i.e., bowled only) including a best performance of 7 in an innings; he took five wickets in an innings on at least five occasions. As a wicketkeeper, he took 24 catches and made 17 stumpings.CricketArchive. Retrieved on 4 November 2008.

As a member of Spindrift, Zachary appeared on the 2001 release 'We Come From the United States', recorded and produced by Bon Jovi writer/producer Bill Grabowski. In 2002 Zachary relocated to Las Vegas to re- join the Spindrift members.

Hansen continues to play with Spindrift when available on tour and in reunion gigs. Other projects That same year Hansen discovered a somewhat unknown band traveling through the Vegas scene known as The Killers. The band frequented such venues as the Double Down Saloon, The Rock, and The Palupa Lounge. After much convincing, the band was offered an opening gig with The Brian Jonestown Massacre in Las Vegas and was subsequently signed to Lizard Records (now renamed Marrakesh Records).

Doerr, started off in 1892 by making and selling cookies and candies in a small grocery shop in Berlin, Ontario, Canada. By 1919 he created the C.H. Doerr Company that distributed his goods throughout Ontario. Following Charles' death in 1941, the company was taken over by his 24-year-old grandson Carl Doerr. He had been raised by his paternal grandparents after both parents died of the Spanish flu. On February 16, 1943 a fire destroyed the company's factory located at Weber and Breithaupt in Kitchener, killing nightwatchman Julius Eckstein and risking the future of the company, then known as C.H. Doerr Co. Ltd. Carl quickly moved to rebuild, relocating the same year as the fire to a plot of land on what is today Kingsway Drive in Kitchener. The name of the company was legally changed to \\"Dare\\" in 1945 because it was easier to pronounce. Dare products became more popular Canada-wide by 1954 and began exporting to the U.S. in 1956. Products Dare is known for adopting the resealable, \\"tin tie\\" packaging, for their cookies in 1954. The resealable bag guaranteed freshness and soon became the standard packaging for cookies across Canada. Dare continued to grow rapidly by expanding their product lines and starting new trends in the food industry. Some of their lines include: Breton crackers, RealFruit Gummies, Bremner Biscuits, Culinar \\"fine bread,\\" and Grissol chocolate-coated cookies. Due to the recent awareness of nut allergies, Dare declared all of its facilities to be \\"peanut free.\\" They were one of the first large food manufacturers in Canada to do this. The following is a list of traditional products they make: *Maple Leaf Cr√®me Cookies *Ultimate Coconut Cr√®me Cookies *Bear Paws *Viva Puffs *Whippets *Wagon Wheels *Breton Crackers *Vinta Crackers *RealFruit Gummies and RealFruit Minis *Maxi Fruit *Melba toast *Breaktime Chocolate Chip Cookies Dare tries to provide snacks for families.

The species was first described by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1775. It is a polyphagous pest of vegetable crops that originated in Indonesia, from where it spread to Europe, South Asia, India, Sri Lanka, Africa, Australia and New Zealand. In northern Europe it is a migrant species. Description The wingspan is 36‚Äì44 mm. Its head, collar and the vertex of its head are reddish orange. Tegulae and forewings pale reddish brown. The forewings are extensively covered with a metallic golden shimmering surface. Only the costal field and hem are brown. Sub-basal, antemedial and postmedial waved lines very indistinct, fine and whitish in colour. The sub-marginal line irregularly lunulate. The reniform and orbicular tain are small and white bordered. The unpatterned hindwings are grey brown, somewhat darker at the margin. The thorax is furry and with some hair tufts, the proboscis is well developed. Larva bluish green with a few short dorsal hairs. There are slender dorsal white lines and a prominent lateral line. Ecology The moth flies from August to October, depending on the location. The larvae feed on various herbaceous plants, including crops such as sunflower, Coreopsis, potato and soybean. In managing their population, phenylacetaldehyde, a volatile floral compound attractive to many Lepidoptera and present in Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense), was found to be effective in trapping especially the females of the species.

Origin  In 1991 Advanced Fellowship Program in Geriatric Neurology was started by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Many veterans suffered from neurodegenerative changes such as Alzheimer's disease, Lewy Body dementia, Parkinson's disease, vascular dementia, and other age related central nervous system changes. The implications for family caregivers and the healthcare system were enormous. So the Geriatric Neurology Fellowship Program developed a cadre of physicians for academic leadership in this complex, interdisciplinary field.VA Geriatric Neurology fellowship The subspecialty of Geriatric neurology is defined by its expertise in the diagnosis, treatment, and care of neurological conditions that affect elderly and by its unique body of knowledge regarding the aging nervous system, its vulnerability to specific neurological disorders, and its influence on the prevalence and expression of neurological disease. Neurologists are called with increasing frequency to provide care for older adults. As the number of elderly in the population increases, there will be a concomitant increase in the prevalence of acute and chronic neurological disorders associated with advancing age. Through training fellowships, the neurological community will endeavor to master, codify and transfer the knowledge and skills to effectively care for the elderly with neurological disorders.United Council for Neurologic Subspecialties Behavioral Neurology Clinic at the Perlman Ambulatory Care Center.

The magazine depicts and describes flowering plants from Africa and its neighbouring islands. The issues are printed in soft cover measuring 250 x 190 mm. The first volumes were printed in England by L. Reeve & Co. These first illustrations were done in black and white by lithography, zinc plates later replacing the stone. A copy of the original water colour guided teams of hand- colour artists who applied paint where needed. Hand-colouring was a family craft carried on from generation to generation. Single colour printing was occasionally done to help speed the process, especially when skilled hand- colour artists were in short supply, as happened in World War II. Notable botanists who contributed to this journal include Anna Amelia Obermeyer and Josef Bogner. Notable botanical artists who have contributed to its pages include Kathleen Annie Lansdell, Gillian Condy, Fay Anderson, Auriol Batten, Rosemary Holcroft, Betty Connell, Cythna Letty (who was responsible for over 700 plates), Barbara Pike and Ellaphie Ward-Hilhorst.

Although he only had a brief career in Australian domestic cricket, the right-handed batsman is noted for being the younger brother of players Mark and Steve Waugh. His only first-class appearance came during the 1995/96 Sheffield Shield season when a Phil Emery led New South Wales, in the absence of their Test stars, took on Queensland at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The Queenslanders batted first and amassed 371, with Waugh taking a catch to dismiss their captain Allan Border off the bowling of Greg Matthews. Waugh batted at five in the batting order and made 19 before falling to Paul Jackson, caught behind. He was dismissed in the same fashion in his second dig, this time to Michael Kasprowicz for three, as New South Wales followed on and could only set Queensland a target of one run. Also in the 1995/96 summer he took the field for New South Wales in two Mercantile Mutual Cup matches. After opening the batting and scoring 15 on his debut, Waugh moved back into the middle order when he was picked in the Semi Final side which played Western Australia. He made a rapid 28, off just 25 balls, before being run-out and then watched the Western Warriors chase down their score in the 47th over. The following season he played one other Mercantile Mutual one day match for New South Wales and then decided to make the move to South Australia. Waugh could not break into the South Australian Sheffield Shield team but did take part in their 1998/99 Mercantile Mutual Cup campaign. The second of his two games - his last ever appearance in Australian domestic cricket, was another Semi Final loss. On this occasion it was Victoria who eliminated his team from the competition. After scoring 17 of South Australia's total of 175, he took a couple of catches during Victoria's pursuit of their target before the winning runs were hit with just nine balls to spare.

Initially a ten-piece, they had a variable line-up and sometimes had 15 performers. The word, djaambi, is \\"brother\\" in an Aboriginal language. The group released a self-titled album in 1990 and supported Prince on his Australian Tour in 1992. Djaambi were the subject of a documentary, Beating About the Bush (Titus Films, 1993), which followed their travels from Alice Springs, through Aboriginal communities, to Darwin. It was co-produced and co- directed by Nicholas Adler and Caroline Sherwood. According to The Canberra Times staff reporters, \\"It was obvious that most of the band members, particularly the more vocal Aboriginal ones, did not want the film crew there. It was a wonder they allowed the crew in the first place, considering the distrust of them... Franklin was virtually the only person who was happy with the filming.\\" Frankland, who was also a film maker, had the group provide music for three of his films. Former members of Djaambi include Peter Rotumah on bass guitar (ex-Hard Times), who was later in the Black Arm Band. Three female vocalists, Amy Saunders (Frankland's sister), Sally Dastey and Lou Bennett, left in 1991 to form a folk band, Tiddas. Other band members included Peter Pascotto (drums), Peter Camm (guitar), Dean Hilson (sax), Eugene Ball (trumpet), Alison Walker (vocals), Julia Messenger (vocals), Sonny Cooper (didge, dancer) and Paul Wright (didge, dancer). Bennett later recalled her time with Djaambi, \\"the band could range from 10 to 15, depending on who was in the audience with a didgeridoo, or who could dance.\\" Bennett, Dastey and Saunders were also members of the Black Arm Band.

After the war, in 1949 Fenet was convicted of being a collaborator and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment with hard labour. He was released in 1959 and died on 14 September 2002. French service Fenet was born on 11 July 1919 in France. Prior to World War II he studied literature at the University of Paris. At the outbreak of war he volunteered for the French Army and was commissioned as an officer with the rank of lieutenant. He was wounded at Mort-Homme, on the old battlefield of Verdun, on 13 June 1940https://www.tracesofwar.com/persons/30103/Fenet-Henri-Joseph.htm and taken prisoner. Upon his release in November 1942, he joined the French forces in Vichy France. Waffen-SS In July 1943 Paul Marion, the Vichy Propaganda Minister, began a nationwide recruitment for the Waffen-SS in France. The Comit√© des Amis de la Waffen S.S. (Committee of the Friends of the Waffen-SS) was established by the minister and proceeded to actively recruit men who were between the ages of 20‚Äì25, \\"free of Jewish blood,\\" and physically fit. Roughly 3000 applied to the assorted offices in the first few months, many of them college students. The organization also spent much time trying to recruit experienced French officers, like Fenet, to the organization. In October 1943, Fenet volunteered for the Waffen-SS and was sent to the SS school at Bad T√∂lz. In March 1944 he received the rank of Obersturmf√ºhrer (senior assault leader, equivalent of first lieutenant) in the Waffen-SS and was given command of a company of the newly formed 8th SS Assault Brigade Frankreich. In September 1944, Fenet and his company were sent to K√∂nitz, West Prussia, where they joined other French recruits to form a new brigade-sized formation, later known as the SS Division Charlemagne. Joining them were French collaborators fleeing the Allied advance in the west, as well as Frenchmen from the German Navy, the National Socialist Motor Corps (NSKK), the Organisation Todt and the detested Milice security police. In February 1945, the unit was officially upgraded to a division. At this time it had a strength of 7,340 men. Fenet was named the commander of a battalion, which he led until April 1945. The unit was sent to fight the Soviet Red Army in Poland, but by 25 February it was attacked at Hammerstein (present day Czarne) in Pomerania, by troops of the 1st Belorussian Front. The Soviet forces split the French force into three pockets. In heavy fighting against the Soviet Red Army, 7 officers and 130 men were killed, while 8 officers and 661 men were wounded. Fenet's battalion was part of one of the groups that was able to break out and return to the German lines. They were evacuated by the German Navy to Denmark and later sent to Neustrelitz. =Berlin, 1945= On 23 April 1945, the Reich Chancellery in Berlin ordered Brigadef√ºhrer Gustav Krukenberg to proceed to the capital. About 350 men from the remains of the Charlemagne division chose to go to Berlin. The men had been reorganized as Sturmbataillon (\\"assault battalion\\") \\"Charlemagne\\" and was attached to the SS Division Nordland. In the days which followed, fighting was very heavy and by 28 April, 108 Soviet tanks had been destroyed in the southeast of Berlin within the S-Bahn. The French squads under the command of Fenet accounted for \\"about half\\" of the tanks. Fenet, who was now wounded in the foot, withdrew with the battalion to the vicinity of the Reich Aviation Ministry in the central government district under the command of Wilhelm Mohnke. For the combat actions of the battalion during the Battle of Berlin, Fenet was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 29 April 1945 by Mohnke. By the evening of 30 April, the French SS men serving under Fenet had destroyed another 21 Soviet tanks. On 2 May 1945, most of the surviving Frenchmen left in Berlin surrendered to the Soviet Red Army. The rest, including Fenet, surrendered to British forces at Bad Kleinen and Wismar. Fenet was handed over to the Soviet Army, who put him in a prisoner of war camp and then let him be treated for his foot wound at hospital. He was then returned to a POW camp and a short time later released by the Soviets. Fenet was arrested upon his return to France. Later life In 1949, Fenet was convicted of being a collaborator and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment with hard labour. He was released in 1959. After Fenet was released, he appeared in several documentary films and television programmes. He also ran a small independent auto business. Fenet died on 14 September 2002.

He wrote widely on issues of cultural identity, mixing ideas from anthropology, linguistics, psychology, philosophy, ethnology, sociology, and political science. Early career Tib√≥n was born in Lombardy, Italy. In his early years he worked as a typewriter salesman, later travelling widely in Europe and the Americas for his work.Louis Nesbit, \\"Gutierre Tib√≥n: Prophet in Mexico\\", Hispania, Vol. 33, No. 1, Feb., 1950, pp. 51-53 His visits to Mexico attracted him to the country, and he moved there in 1940. He established himself as a writer and radio personality. His first major work was on the culture and future prospects of Mexico. M√©xico, 1950, Un Pa√≠s en Futuro (1942) looked forward to what he called a M√©xico Feliz, which he thought could be achieved by 1950. He advocated strong leadership and government intervention to promote mass education. He later had a success with Viaje √† la India por el Aire, which originated as broadcast conversations with the poet Ricardo L√≥pez M√©ndez about his travels in the Middle East on the way to India. Tib√≥n's ability to mix anecdotes, philosophical observations and political commentary on the culture of the countries he passed through proved popular. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicol√°s de Hidalgo on 11 October 1946 for his writings.university homepage Onomastics Tib√≥n has been especially interested in the history of personal and topographical names. His book Am√©rica: Setenta siglos de la historia de un nombre (1945) constitutes what has been called a \\"novelized study in which a word is the chief character\\". He argues that the name \\"America\\" is \\"a masterpiece of chance\\", and proceeds to trace its etymology from the personal name of Amerigo Vespucci to its Germanic original Amalric and to ancient roots, which he claims to link to the meaning \\"land of industrious and powerful men\\". In Origen, Vida y Milagros de su Apellido, he extended this method to the discussion of personal names, providing elaborate historical genealogies and anecdotes to create a narrative of humanity though names. He was most interested in Spanish and Sephardic Jewish names. In 1946 the Academia Mexicana de Genealog√≠a y Her√°ldica elected him as a Numbered Academician Later work His later writings continue his interest in names, but also branch out to include mysticist or occult topics. He developed the method of his book on America in his discussion of the origins of Mexico in Historia del nombre y de la fundaci√≥n de M√©xico (1975). In El Ombligo como centro c√≥smico (1981), he argued for the survivals of \\"paleolithic magic\\" in a \\"prenatal triad\\" of umbilical cord, placenta and amniotic sac and on the navel as \\"cosmic center\\". In Los Ritos M√°gicos y Tr√°gicos de la Pubertad Femenina (1984) he explored the \\"magic and tragic rites\\" of female puberty. He was elected to the Academia Mexicana de la Lengua as an honorary member on 10 December 1987.http://www.centenarios.org.mx/1900autores.htm From 1959 until his death at the age of 93, Tibon lived in Acapantzingo, Cuernavaca, Mexico.

He also trained with Margaret Craske, Stanislav Idzikowski and Vera Volkova. He debuted at Rambert's Ballet Club in 1932. Performing career Edwards was a cast member in the original production of Antony Tudor's Jardin aux Lilas in 1936. He first danced with the Vic-Wells Ballet in 1933, however, he only officially joined the company in 1937. With the Vic-Wells Ballet, he was a member of the first cast of Frederick Ashton's Les Patineurs. Edwards was known for his character roles rather than classical technique and later enjoyed purely mime roles. He taught mime at the Royal Ballet School while still a principal with the Royal Ballet. His career began in the supporting male roles before graduating to the villains. His niche, however, was in \\"the meatier roles in the mime and character repertory\\" such as the Red King in De Valois's Checkmate and as the American tourist in Massine's La Boutique fantasque. Edwards's success grew, however, after Frederick Ashton created the amiable role of Arthur for him in his A Wedding Bouquet of 1937. Edwards as the Beggar in Robert Helpmann's 1944 ballet Miracle in the Gorbals was deemed irreplaceable and he thus appeared in all 92 performances of the ballet. He was also notable as the farmer Thomas in Ashton's La Fille Mal Gard√©e of 1960. He had an unusually long 60-year career, which was interrupted only for two years of war service during the Second World War. However, he returned, after being invalided out, to create many more roles and he appeared in dozens of ballets. His most famous role was as Catalabutte in Sleeping Beauty. =Roles created for him= * Arthur in Ashton's A Wedding Bouquet, 1937 * Lawyer in de Valois's The Prospect Before Us, 1940 * Archimago in Ashton's The Quest, 1943 * the Beggar in Helpmann's Miracle in the Gorbals, 1944 * Chauffeur in Ashton's Les Sir√®nes, 1946 * Bilby in Howard's A Mirror for Witches, 1952 * Hypnotist in MacMillan's Noctambules, 1956 * Oedipus in Cranko's Antigone, 1959 * farmer Thomas in Ashton's La Fille Mal Gard√©e, 1960 * Basil G. Nevinson in Ashton's Enigma Variations, 1967 Later years Edwards worked as a rehearsal director for the Royal Ballet from 1959 to 1970. He was the first director of the newly formed Royal Ballet Choreographic Group from 1967 to 1987. Here he assisted many emerging British choreographers, including Ronald Hynd, Geoffrey Cauley, David Bintley and Michael Corder. He also served as ballet master for the Royal Opera from 1970 to 1990. He was described as \\"gentle, unassuming, kindly, very distinguished in bearing ‚Äì a senior civil servant among dancers ‚Äì yet happily possessed of a wicked but never malicious sense of humour\\". He died at his home in London on 8 February 2001 after suffering from cancer. His autobiography, In Good Company: Sixty Years with the Royal Ballet, was published posthumously in 2003.

The revue consists of two men and one woman in formal dress, performing songs based on the following themes: England, family album, travel, theatre, love and women.Flinn, Denny Martin. Little musicals for little theatres (2006), p. 229, Hal Leonard Corporation, There are also sketches, such as \\"London Pastoral\\" which tells of the joys of London in the spring, \\"Family Album\\" about relatives who \\"were not excessively bright\\", and a scene with excerpts from several of Coward's plays, such as Private Lives.Oh, Coward! at MTI Shows It ran Off-Broadway in 1972, in London in 1975 and on Broadway in 1986. Also in 1972 a revue along similar lines, Cowardy Custard played in London. Productions A Coward revue at the 1968 Vancouver International Festival called And Now No√´l Coward‚Ä¶: An Agreeable Impertinence, was created and directed by Roderick Cook and starred Dorothy Loudon. It received scathing reviews from the critics. It was soon revised and presented on Broadway, with mostly the same cast, as No√´l Coward's Sweet Potato. Though it received slightly better notices, it lasted only 44 performances.Bowie, Stephen. \\"Dorothy and No√´l\\", Library for the Performing Arts, 15 August 2012 Cook again reshaped the material, as Oh, Coward!, premiering the work in Toronto, then touring it to Boston and Chicago.Atkey, Mel. Broadway North: The Dream of a Canadian Musical Theatre, Natural Heritage Books, 2006, p. 88 Oh, Coward! opened Off-Broadway with a new cast on 4 October 1972 and was one of the last No√´l Coward shows staged during his life. It played for 294 performances at the New Theatre. Its cast included Barbara Cason, Jamie Ross and Cook, who also directed the revue. A London production opened on 5 June 1975 at the Criterion Theatre, starring Cook, Ross and Geraldine McEwan, and ran until 2 August 1975.The Guardian, 6 June 1975, p. 10; and 2 August 1975, p. 7 The show later played on Broadway beginning on 17 November 1986 at the Helen Hayes Theatre, where it ran for 56 performances. Again directed by and starring Cook, the cast also featured Catherine Cox and Patrick Quinn. The production received two Tony Award nominations, Best Actor and Actress in a Musical for Cook and Cox. Of the London production, Michael Billington of The Guardian wrote, \\"the star performer is undeniably Mr Cook himself... with a dangerous tooth-baring smile... he delivers each syllable of each song with a clinical, omniscient precision. Geraldine McEwan, willowy and acidulous in white satin, likewise realises that merciless articulation is the key to Coward performing, and Jamie Ross amiably makes up the trio in the manner of someone completing a country house party.\\"The Guardian, 6 June 1975, p. 10 The New York Times review of the 1986 production noted, \\"The performance is determinedly low-key and genteel, in keeping with its source. Neither in the selection of material nor in the performances does the show overstep into self-parody, as is often the case in other musical anthologies. As before, Mr. Cook lets Coward speak and sing for himself, which he does, trippingly.\\"Gussow, Mel. \\"Theatre: 'Oh Coward' is Revived\\",The New York Times, 18 November 1986 A review of the original cast recording compared it with the contemporary London show, Cowardy Custard: \\"The formula is much the same, a show made out of No√´l Coward's writing and composing. Where it differs is that Cowardy Custard was a carefully co-ordinated revue, this is more of a cabaret entertainment, the songs being delivered by the three performers without, as far as one can judge from the recording, any attempt at staging, accompanied by two pianos, bass, drums and percussion... the Coward enthusiast will note the first recording ever of his early trio 'Bright Young People'.\\"Myers, Peter.

Origins  Geriatric rehabilitation covers three areas ‚Äì normal aging due to disuse and deconditioning, cardiovascular problems like vascular disease and stroke, and skeletal problems including osteoporosis and osteoarthritis conditions such as knee and hip replacements. Physical medicine physicians [physiotherapists] use rehabilitation to work toward the goal of returning the patient to a pre-injury quality of life and may use physical, occupational, and speech therapies.Geriatric Rehab With increased age, patients often face many physical and emotional changes that can affect level of physical, mental, social function and well-being. Rehabilitation maintains functional independence in the elderly. Rehabilitation of geriatric patients is imperative for the patients' well-being and for society, so that we can thrive socially and economically. Essential to geriatric rehabilitation is communication, specifically improving any sensory impairment, including those related to vision and hearing. The prevention of falls and osteoporosis can improve the patient's health and longevity. Addressing malnutrition can promote healing and vitalize the patient to participate in a formal rehabilitation program. Depression is common in the older population if a functional loss of mobility and an inability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) predominates. Cognitive impairment, such as delirium and dementia, can affect the patient's rehabilitation goals and outcomes. Finally, a driver's evaluation for an appropriate elderly candidate is an underutilized part of rehabilitation that has a considerable impact on society.Emedicine, geriatric rehabilitation Geriatric rehabilitation also have a role in intermediate care, where patients are referred by a hospital or family doctor, when there is a requirement to provide hospital based short term intensive physical therapy aimed at the recovery of musculoskeletal function, particularly recovery from joint, tendon, or ligament repair and, or, physical medicine and rehabilitation care when elderly patients get out of sync with their medication resulting in a deterioration of their personal health which reduces their ability to live independently. Finally, geriatric rehabilitation has a large influence on the growing life expectancy around the globe. The American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) surveyed 556 adults over 65 years old in order to gain an understanding on the factors that affect adherence to an exercise program. Adherence to an exercise program influences frailty, speed, ability to live independently, and best of all, life expectancy. The study compared two factors: exercise barriers and motivation. The study concluded that exercise barriers play the largest role in determining adherence to a home exercise program (HEP). According to APTA, motivators include self-efficacy, the ability to control behavior, and outcome expectation, the belief that consequences follow certain actions. APTA describes barriers as: insufficient time, lack of social support, no place to exercise, limited finances, no transportation, and the fear of falling. Researchers recently found that depression, stress levels, increased age, decreased health status and lack of pleasure while exercising contribute to exercise adherence.

Stephen Huneck (October 8, 1948 in Columbus, Ohio ‚Äì January 7, 2010 in Littleton, New Hampshire) was an American wood carving artist, furniture maker, painter, and author. Most of his later artwork is composed of carvings of dogs. Stephan credited the change in his artwork to his dogs coming into the hospital and bringing him out of a long coma. The coma was caused by him falling down the stairs of his barn studio and hitting his head. He had to learn to read, walk and write again and changed the focus of his work to dogs...which Steve noted is God spelled backwards. Prior to this a lot of Stephan's work was devoted to social commentary. In addition to carvings, Huneck also wrote several children's books, the main character of which was his black Labrador Retriever, Sally. Huneck was originally from Sudbury, Massachusetts. Before becoming an artist, Huneck lived for several years at Quarry Hill Creative Center, Rochester, Vermont, where he began to work in wood. He then became an antiques dealer. He was discovered in 1984 when he found a man pulling one of his carvings, an angel, out of the back of Huneck's pick-up truck. The man asked how much he wanted for the angel. Not intending to sell it and believing that the man wouldn't pay such a high price, Huneck told him that he wanted $1,000. The man revealed himself to be an art dealer from Manhattan and paid Huneck the money. Pieces of Huneck's artwork are in the permanent collections of the Smithsonian Institution, the Dog Museum of America and the American Kennel Club. Huneck received commissions for works from celebrities and politicians, including Sandra Bullock, Dr. Phil McGraw, and US Senator Patrick Leahy. Much of the basswood, cherry, maple and pine he worked with came from his farm. In 1997, after a near death experience with acute respiratory distress syndrome, Huneck started work building a chapel dedicated to dogs. The Dog Chapel, which took three years to complete, is situated next to his studio in St. Johnsbury, Vermont. In addition to standard human sized doors, the chapel also has a dog door, carved wooden dogs lining the pews and dog themed stained glass windows. The inner walls are covered with remembrance notes and pictures of visitors' deceased canine pets. Each year, Huneck and his wife, Gwen, held two gatherings known as the Dog Party and Dog Fest at his Dog Mountain studio. People brought their dogs for a day of relaxation. Contests were held for categories such as loudest bark, biggest/smallest dog, best dog kiss, etc. The dogs were let off their leashes and allowed to run free and play with other dogs. Huneck was despondent over having to lay off employees in January 2010 and had been dealing with depression. On January 7, 2010, after driving to a psychiatrist's office in Littleton, New Hampshire, Huneck shot himself and died. He was 61 years old. After her husband's death, Gwen Huneck was the head of Dog Mountain until her death three and a half years later.

Its depiction of industrial relations was seen as controversial and distributors initially refused to screen it. It was nominated for the 1951 BAFTA for Best British Film, which was awarded to The Blue Lamp. Plot In the times of austerity after the Second World War, Dickinson works hard to try to keep his failing agricultural implements factory going. His disgruntled workers do not appreciate his efforts, however, and resent Bland, his bullying works manager. He has a suggestion box installed after workers complain he never listens to them but, after the works manager threatens latecomers, the only response is insulting. When Bland sacks the author of the suggestion, Bolger, the workforce go on strike. Dickinson confronts them and, in the heat of the moment, tells them he works much harder than they do and dares them to run the business themselves. Baxter gets the others to take him up on his suggestion, and they elect Stevens and Morris to do just that. Dickinson is taken aback, but reluctantly agrees to let the factory to them on condition that they pay him annually 5% of the capital value of the business, equivalent to ¬£120 a week. Bland, Miss Cooper, Dickinson's secretary, the works manager, the foreman and a few others quit. That night, Dickinson's solicitor and doctor advise him to use the situation as an opportunity to take a holiday and recommend to Miss Cooper that she return to work. A supplier changes its credit terms, causing a financial crisis. The local bank manager is unwilling to extend a temporary loan, so Baxter goes to the bank's head office in the City of London and speaks to the bank's managing director, Sir Robert Dysart, but without luck. Finally, Stevens and Morris put up the deeds to their own homes, Palmer raises money on his insurance policy, and, after some grumbling, some of the other workers make up the required sum. After press publicity of this worker-owned factory, a trade delegation from the (fictitious) country of Xenobia contact the factory to arrange a demonstration of the \\"one-way plough\\" that Dickinson had been working on. Miss Cooper invites Dickinson to attend, but he merely watches from a distance. The Xenobians are impressed and order 800 ploughs for ¬£50,000. After the contract is signed, Adam insists the only way to fulfil such a large order is to focus their efforts solely on the plough, to the exclusion of work they have contracted from longtime customers. Morris returns to the factory floor rather than be a party to abandoning their other customers, and Adam takes his place. Meanwhile, a few of the workers, led by Baxter, are unhappy with the new, lower pay rate. Two trades union men are called in to try to sort things out, and Baxter eventually drops his objections. Dickinson shows up at the factory late at night and is invited in for a cup of cocoa by the watchman. He meets Miss Cooper and has a chat with her about how things are going. He learns that a steel supplier is delaying delivery, so the next day he goes to see Garrett, its managing director. Garrett strongly disapproves of the experiment and refuses to help it along, but Dickinson suggests that a newspaper article about its sabotaging, with a photograph of Garrett, would not be in his best interests. The steel is delivered. Then the Xenobian government announces that \\"in view of their foreign currency position, all outstanding import licences are suspended\\". Dickinson returns and is able to find other foreign customers for the ploughs. Disaster averted, he goes to leave, only for Stevens to offer him his old position back. Dickinson accepts a lesser position, and indicates that Adam should be the managing director. Stevens walks out, saying he prefers to do real work. Response The Rank and Associated British cinemas refused to show the film, claiming it was too political and \\"would annoy employers\\". The Ministry of Labour and the British Employers Confederation argued that the film would damage management-employee relations, particularly in the light of renewed industrial unrest in early 1950.

He won his first talent contest at the age of nine, and by the age of twelve he was already appearing in public, playing drums, guitar, and keyboards. He attended the Alpha Boys School and turned professional aged 19. Gray was a dynamic performer on stage, who could be gritty or suave as the song dictated.Barrow, Steve & Dalton, Peter (2004) The Rough Guide to Reggae, 3rd edn., Rough Guides, He was the first singer (of many) to praise a sound system on record, with his \\"On the Beach\\" celebrating Clement Dodd's Sir Coxsone Downbeat system in 1959, one of the first releases on Dodd's Studio One label. He was one of the first artists to be produced by Chris Blackwell, in 1960, and his \\"Patricia\\" single was the first record ever released by Island Records.Thompson, Dave (2002) \\"Reggae & Caribbean Music\\", Backbeat Books, His first single, \\"Please Let Me Go\\", reached the top of the charts in Jamaica, and featured a guitar solo from Australian musician Dennis Sindrey who was a member of The Caribs, a studio band that played on many early Owen Gray recordings. The single also sold well in the United Kingdom, as did subsequent releases, prompting Gray to emigrate there in 1962. He toured Europe in 1964, and by 1966 he was well known as a soul singer as well as for his ska songs. During 1966, he worked in the UK and Europe with The Krew, then in 1967 with Tony Knights Chessmen. In the rocksteady era, he recorded for producer Sir Clancy Collins. His popularity continued throughout the 1960s, working with producers such as Clement Dodd, Prince Buster, Sydney Crooks, rthur \\"Duke\\" Reid, Leslie Kong, and Clancy Eccles, including work as a duo with Millie Small, with songs ranging from ska to ballads. He continued to record regularly, having a big hit in 1968 with \\"Cupid\\". His 1970 track \\"Apollo 12\\" found favour with the early skinheads, and in 1972 he returned to Island Records, recording reggae versions of The Rolling Stones' \\"Tumblin' Dice\\" and John Lennon's \\"Jealous Guy\\", although they met with little success. During this period, he regularly had releases on Pama and Pioneer Internacional label, Camel Records, and one single on Hot Lead Records. He had greater success in Jamaica, however, with \\"Hail the Man\\", a tribute to Emperor Haile Selassie, which was popular with the increasing Rastafari following. Gray spent a short time living in New Orleans before returning to Jamaica where he turned his hand to roots reggae, working with producer Bunny Lee, and achieving considerable success. In the 1980s relocated to Miami. He has continued to release new material regularly, often concentrating on ballads and Gospel music.

MullenMullen, E. J. (1983). Personal practice models in clinical social work. In A. Rosenblatt & D. Waldfogel (Eds.), Handbook of clinical social work. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass. describes the PPM as ‚Äúthe art and science of social work‚Äù, or more prosaically, ‚Äúan explicit conceptual scheme that expresses a worker's view of practice‚Äù. A worker should develop a PPM pragmatically over their entire career by reflecting on, and the absorption of, a variety of sources. They are an important basis for the delivery of good practice and the evaluation of such. Bowles, Collingridge, Curry and Valentine Bowles, W., Collingridge, M., Curry, S. and Valentine, B. (2006). Ethical Practice in Social Work:An Applied Approach. Crows Nest: Allen & Unwin. stress the importance of deriving the guidelines for good practice from a text such as the Australian Association of Social Workers Code of Ethics.Australian Association of Social Workers (2000). Code of Ethics. Canberra: Australian Association of Social Workers. As the name implies, they are fundamentally personal and idiosyncratic, and to be effective, they must be rationally constructed, by a self-conscious worker. Fook Fook, J. (2002). Social Work: Critical Theory and Practice. London: SAGE Publications. identifies the need to maintain ‚Äúa broader vision of the mission of social work‚Äù to transcend everyday workplace distractions. Mullen proposes that a PPM should be constructed from both theory and research. He first detailed the process for using research findings for PPM development in his 1978 publicationMullen, E.J. (1978). Construction of personal models for effective practice: A method for utilizing research findings to guide social interventions. Journal of Social Service Research, 2(1), 45-63. He proposes a systematic process for reviewing research findings \\"--- to facilitate individual student and practitioner use of research findings to construct personal working models of social intervention. The methodology is composed of five interrelated steps: (a) identification of substantive findings concerning intervention variables and their effects on clients; (b) identification of the quality and limitations of the evidence; (c) development of summary generalizations; (d) deduction of practice guidelines; and (e) specification of an evaluation plan to monitor the outcomes when practice guidelines are implemented with individual client systems. Social interventions are conceptualized as open systems whose effects on clients are a function of environmental, organizational, intervenor, technological, and focus components in interaction with client qualities. A systems framework serves the heuristic purpose of structuring the research utilization process.\\" p. 45 Mullen presents a detailed description with examples of how theories can be used in PPM in his 1981 and 1988 publicationsMullen, E. J. (1988). Constructing Personal Practice Modes. In R. M. Grinnell, Jr. (Ed.), Social work research and evaluation, 3rd ed. pp. 503-533. Itasca, Ill.: F.E. Peacock Publishers.Mullen, E. J. (1981). Development of personal intervention models. In R. M. Grinnell, Jr. (Ed.), Social work research and evaluation, 1st ed., pp. 606-632. Itasca, Ill.: F.E. Peacock Publishers. Mullen describes the dimensions and sub-dimension of a PPM, outlined below. A PPM should include all elements of social work theory, linking what Payne Payne, M. (2005). Modern Social Work Theory. Hampshire: Palgrave MacMillan describes as the three tiers; models of practice, explanatory theory and world perspectives. Dimensions of the model =Social Welfare and the Profession= This requires a practitioner to have an understanding of the concept of social welfare, and the role of social work within this concept as well as any specialisations of social work. =Social Work= A practitioner needs to understand the missions and objectives of social work, as well as philosophies that underpin it. =Clients= A PPM needs to explain how the model centres around clients, and conceptualisation of the clients that is in line with the philosophies of social work. =Practitioner= The use of self is fundamental to social work, and a practitioner needs to be self-conscious, and know what parts of themselves to use in practice, and which to leave out. =Relationship= The relationship between client and practitioner is the most crucial workspace in social work, and the context that the relationship occurs is therefore a vital part of a PPM. A practitioner needs to consider which elements of a relationship are important, and which may be contrary to the notion of social work. =Agency= The strengths and shortfalls of an agency can greatly help or hamper the social work process, and a worker needs to be aware of these to maximise the agency's benefit to the client. =Technique= The technique a social worker uses is defined by all the preceding dimensions. The processes that a social worker uses needs to be consistent with the orienting theories that form their conception of social work. =Monitoring and Evaluation= To maintain a validity with a PPM, social workers need a systemic plan that takes into account the relevance and effectiveness of practice. Strengths and weaknesses of the concept Payne identified that an eclectic approach to theory has the benefits of increasing a workers effectiveness, but that this should not come at the expense of being ‚Äúinternally inconsistent or debas(ing) the full theory.‚Äù Mullen offers several criticisms of PPMs, that they are duplicative, time consuming and overly subjective. He offers responses to these three points, firstly in refuting the claim that they simply duplicate existing General Practice Models (GPM). A PPM allows for development and tweaking of GPMs, making them more relevant to individual practice. He concedes that they can be time consuming, but mostly in their inception, and that maintaining and developing them is much easier. As for the subjectivity of a PPM, workers need to be aware of this, and critically engaged with GPMs to bring esoteric theory and research into contact with everyday practice.

The airfield is situated between Hoton, Wymeswold and Burton on the Wolds, lying in the current district of Charnwood. History It was opened on 16 May 1942 during the Second World War and was home to Vickers Wellington bombers amongst others. It's Wellington's were occasionally used for operations over Germany, dropping 'Nickel' (leaflets) but the main role was training: bomber pilots until 1944, then, with RAF Transport Command, Douglas Dakota pilots. It also operated Hampdens in the training role to tow Horsa gliders prior to the D-Day landings and various other aircraft including Hurricanes in air gunnery training. Visits from other aircraft took place with a large contingent of USAAF C47s on at least one occasion in 1944 prior to the D-Day landings. RAF Castle Donington was used as a satellite airfield which post-war has turned into East Midlands Airport. =Post-war= From 1949 it was part of Fighter Command, with 504 (County of Nottingham) Squadron, RAuxAF (Royal Auxiliary Air Force) moving from RAF Hucknall. The RAuxAF volunteer pilots flew every weekend, sometimes in the week and the squadron included several full-time regular RAF pilots. The ground staff were a similar mix with the volunteer majority being drawn from the local area. The first of 504's Spitfire Mk.22s arrived on April 2 and the full squadron, with two Harvard trainers was in residence by the end of May. 504 Sqn had the honour of being the first RAuxAF squadron to be equipped with the jet-engined Gloster Meteor and on Oct 17th two Meteor T7 trainers arrived followed on the 19th by the first F.4 single seat fighter. All the Spitfire Mk.22s were replaced by early Spring 1950 although the Harvard trainers were retained for some time. In turn the Meteor F.4s were replaced in January 1952 by the more powerful Meteor F.4 which 504 Sqn flew from Wymeswold until 1957 when the RAuxAF was disbanded. This led to the closure of the airfield for frontline RAF flying but it continued to be used as a satellite to RAF Syerston (near Newark) and No 2 Flying Training School, flying Hunting Provost and (after 1959) Jet Provost initial training aircraft. =Closure= It was closed as an RAF station in early 1957, although it continued to be used for aircraft maintenance by various private organisations until 1968. It did not close as an RAF Base in 1957 as RAF Syerston still used it as a satellite airfield in 1963. Units During the Second World War the airfield was home to Operational Training Units, however post war the airfield was used by squadrons flying new jets like the Hawker Hunter. * No. 28 Operational Training Unit (OTU) (part of 93 Group, Bomber Command) from May 1942 until October 1944 using the Short Stirling, Handley Page Halifax and the Avro Lancaster. * No. 108 OTU (44 Group, Transport Command) from 15 October 1944 until August 1945 before being turned into No. 1382 Operational Conversion Unit RAF (4 Group) operating until December 1947 using the Airspeed Oxford, Miles Magister and the Dakota. * 504 Sqn (12 Group, Royal Auxiliary Air Force) from 3 May 1949 until 12 February 1957 flying the Gloster Meteor Mk.8 * 664 Sqn (1969 Flight) from July 1954 until 10 March 1956. * 56 Sqn from August 1955 until 1957 with the Hawker Hunter. * 257 Sqn and 263 Sqn (temporary base from RAF Wattisham) using the Hawker Hunter. Current use Airfield today The airfield is now disused although many of the original buildings remain and there is currently an industrial estate on the site; the runway still exists and is used for motorsport. The airfield is home to the UK's largest solar farm. The airfield and associated buildings lie outside the civil parish of Wymeswold, with the north half being in Hoton, and the southern half in Prestwold. On the eastern fringe of the airfield is the Wymeswold Industrial Estate, where there is a go-karting facility. The Hoton-Wymeswold road runs alongside the airfield. The airfield has also been host for regattas of land sailing. In the early 1990s, there were plans for a 6,000 population new town to be built on the airfield. Accidents and incidents * On 14 April 1944 at around 16.30, Airspeed Oxford LB415 from 1521 Flight from the airfield collided with Avro Lancaster W4103 RC-E, from the 5 Lancaster Finishing School at RAF Syerston, over the Nottinghamshire village of Screveton. * On Saturday 7 July 1951, a Meteor from 504 squadron at Wymeswold, piloted by Pilot Officer H Elliot (RAuxAF), ran out of fuel.Meteor Eject, Nick Carter, , p.232 The pilot was killed.

Launch had initially been planned for 2007, but has since been continually delayed; as of March 2020, the launch is planned for October 2025 atop an Angara A5 rocket from Vostochny Cosmodrome.  The observatory  The main instrument of the observatory is a 1.7-metre Ritchey‚ÄìChr√©tien telescope. The telescope will be equipped with the following instruments: WSO- UV Spectrographs Unit (WUVS) (Russia/Japan) The WUVS spectrographs assembly consists of four channels: \\\\- Vacuum Ultraviolet Echelle Spectrograph, VUVES (Russia) The FUV high-resolution spectrograph (VUVES) provides echelle spectroscopy capabilities with high resolution (R ~ 50 000) in the 115‚Äì176 nm range. \\\\- Ultraviolet Echelle Spectrograph, UVES (Russia) The NUV high- resolution spectrograph (UVES) provides echelle spectroscopy capabilities with R ~ 50 000 in the 174‚Äì310 nm range. \\\\- Long-Slit Spectrograph, LSS (Russia) The Long-Slit Spectrograph (LSS) provides low resolution (R ~ 1000), long slit spectroscopy in the 115‚Äì305 nm range. The spatial resolution is better than 0.5 arcsec(0.1 arcsec as the best value). \\\\- UV Spectrograph for observation of Earth-like Exoplanets, UVSPEX (Japan) \\"Many Earth-sized planets have been discovered and some appear to lie in the habitable zone. Moreover, several Earth-sized planets were recently detected around low temperature stars near the solar system. However, it is difficult to characterize them as Earth-like or Venus-like. Transit spectroscopy for exoplanetary atmosphere has been performed to characterize larger exoplanets but it requires very high accuracy because of their small size... High sensitivity (photon counting) is required for M-type star faint in UV. Spectral resolution of 0.5 nm is enough for separating major emission lines of exospheric atoms. The spectral resolution will be achievable by spectrometers in the main WUVS block, however, it is difficult to measure the weak stellar emission from M-type stars without a photon-counting detector. To realize exoplanet transit observations in oxygen spectral lines with the desired accuracy, we equip the WSO-UV telescope with the UVSPEX spectrograph... The spectral resolution is better 0.5 nm to separate O I line from other spectral lines. The spectral range is to exceed the wavelengths from 115 nm to 135 nm to detect at least H Lyman alpha 121.6nm to O I 130 nm. The throughput is better 0.3% accounting more than four terrestrial exoplanets distanced at 5 pc. To achieve these requirements, a simple spectrograph design is proposed, containing the slit, the concave (toroidal) grating as a disperse element and the imaging photo-detector. This optical concept is conventional and used in the other space missions for UV spectroscopy. Spectrometer slit is aligned at primary focus of the telescope from off-axial sub-FoV. Slit width is 0.2 mm, corresponding to 5 arc-sec. The concave grating is laminar type with groove density of 2400 grooves per mm. It has a toroidal shape with the curvature radii of 266.4 mm in horizontal direction and of 253.0 mm in vertical direction. The effective area has nearly O 25 mm and the focal length is ~250 mm. The surface is coated by Al + MgF2 to increase the reflectance, and diffraction efficiency of ~29% can be achieved.\\" WSO-UV Field Camera Unit (FCU) (Russia/Spain) The FCU has two channels, each fed by an independent pick off mirror: \\\\- Field Camera Unit FUV channel (FCU/FUV) (Russia/Spain) The far UV (FUV) channel has capabilities for high resolution imaging.

CCD detector, scale 0,146 arcsec/pixel in 185‚Äì810 nm range Proposed instruments: Stellar Coronograph for Exoplanet Direct Imaging, SCEDI (NAOJ, Rikkyo University, Japan) \\"For research on exoplanets, a team of Russian (IKI RAS, INASAN) and Japanese (NAOJ, Rikkyo University) scientists proposed a new tool - Stellar coronograph for direct images of exoplanets (Stellar Coronograph for Exoplanet Direct Imaging, SCEDI). Decision for the inclusion of this regime in the project should be confirmed in 2019, after the completion of the outline design stage of the FCU and after receiving financing by the Japanese side. Obtaining direct images of exoplanets located at a sufficient distance from the parent star is unique possibility of researching such out of transit objects. Observations using a coronograph aboard a space observatory working out of Earth‚Äôs turbulent atmosphere, receiving light from a two-meter class telescope with diffraction- quality optics, make it possible to study even non transit exoplanets, the sizes of which approximately correspond to the size of the Earth, in the habitable zone of its star.\\" Former instruments: -HIRDES (High-Resolution Double Echelle Spectrograph): R~55000 spectroscopy of point sources in the 102‚Äì320 nm range (Germany) Germany exit Spektr-UV programm due to financial problems, Russia replaced HIRDES with WUVES. -ISSIS (Imaging and Slitless Spectroscopy Instrument for Surveys) being developed to carry out UV and optical diffraction limited imaging of astronomical objects.

He was born in Lincolnshire, and was educated at Christ's College, Cambridge, graduating in 1535.Dan G. Danner, Anthony Gilby: Puritan in Exile: A Biographical Approach, Church History, Vol. 40, No. 4 (Dec. 1971), pp. 412‚Äì422. Early life In Gilby's early life, he served as a preacher in Leicestershire under the rule of Edward VI. During this time, he was brought together with people who shared similar opinions to his on the corruptions of the era. This pushed him to publish A Commentarye upon the Prophet Mycha (1551) and A Commentarye upon the Prophet Malaky (c. 1553), freely expressing through these texts his feelings about the persecution of his religion.Cross, Claire \\"Gilby, Anthony.\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. 2004 ed. Vol 22. Print. He converted to Protestantism in his younger years, and this would prove to be of the utmost importance in the course of his life. Gilby graduated with a Bachelor and Master of Arts from Cambridge University in 1531-2 and 1535 respectively. Throughout his education he was well known for \\"his skill in the biblical languages of Latin, Greek and Hebrew,\\" which proved to be obvious assets to him in the translation of the Geneva Bible. When Mary Tudor took the throne in 1553, life for the Protestants only became more turbulent. This led many to flee to religiously free states; including the Gilby Family in 1555. He became a minister in Leicestershire and a Calvinist.Everett H. Emerson, English Puritanism from John Hooper to John Milton (1968), p. 93. His Answer to the Devilish Detection of Stephen Gardiner was published in 1547 (as by AG), by John Day.Peter Marshall, Alec Ryrie, The Beginnings of English Protestantism (2002), p. 189. Family Gilby was recorded to have married a woman named Elizabeth. They had two daughters and two sons; unfortunately one of the daughters did not survive, leaving him with Ruth, Goddred, and Nathaniel Gilby. Gilby's translation work was extremely prevalent, not only throughout the country but also within his family life. This is supported by the fact that both his sons were translators of two prominent texts during their time: A Brief and Learned Treatise, Containing a True Description of the Antichrist by Georg Sohn and An Epistle to his Brother Quintus by Marcus Tullius Cicero. Goddred Gilby the translator was the elder son; the younger, Nathaniel, of Christ's College and fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, was tutor to Joseph Hall, whose mother was one of Gilby's congregation. Marian Exile When the Roman Catholic religion began to be restored in England, many Protestants were forced to leave the country. Protestants left not only for their physical safety and right to practise their own forms of worship, but, also because it gave them a chance to keep, define, and conserve their national religion for their eventual return to England. European-Protestant artisans were given more courtesy than the colonies of foreign Protestant artisans. European Protestants were given notice to leave and warned of arrest, while foreign Protestants were ordered to dismiss quickly. They originally fled to the Protestant cities of Strasbourg and Frankfurt, but later colonies were established at Emden, Zurich, Wesel, Worms, and Duisburg. In those colonies, particularly Frankfurt, many wanted to preserve the Edwardian English church, while radical others wanted a more demanding reformation. These differing opinions caused many arguments that resulted in the splitting of Frankfurt. Each colony had its own distinct nature, but there was significant contact between the groups of religious exiles. However, there was often lack of communication and unity on their most important issues. The Marian Exiles wanted to encourage their coreligionists back home, so they produced many works on Protestant doctrine using the continental press, and urging them to flight, martyrdom, or rebellion. However, not all of the Marian Exiles left their countries for religious reasons: a large number of them left after failed attempts of secular concerns. After war broke out in 1557, many of these secular exiles put loyalty before religion and returned home to serve their country in whatever ways they could. When Queen Mary died in 1558, the period of Marian exile ended, and the exiles returned home to mixed receptions. Many men, including Anthony Gilby, spent years living in communities they felt were more thoroughly reformed than England.Fritze, Ronald H. Historical Dictionary of Tudor England, 1485‚Äì1603. New York: Greenwood, 1991. 53. Print. Anthony Gilby was a part of this Marian exile, in Basel, in Frankfurt where he associated with John Foxe and lodged him in 1554, and settled in Geneva in 1555. There he deputed for John Knox, with Christopher Goodman.Roland H. Worth, Church, Monarch and Bible in Sixteenth Century England: The Political Context of Biblical Translation (2000), p. 122. He also wrote An Admonition to England and Scotland (1558), contesting the royal supremacy in the Church of England as imposed by Henry VIII.A. N. McLaren, Political Culture in the Reign of Elizabeth I: Queen and Commonwealth, 1558‚Äì1585 (1999), p. 12. His work on the Geneva Bible, which was published in 1560, was as one of the main assistants to William Whittingham.Donald K. McKim, David F. Wright, Encyclopedia of the Reformed Faith (1992), p. 150. The Geneva Bible After the Marian persecutions began, English Protestants went to Geneva. It was here that translators, including Gilby, worked on what would come to be known as the Geneva Bible.Head, Dominic. The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2006. 99‚Äì101. Print. Later, after Mary's death, many of the exiles returned to England in 1558, but Gilby stayed in Geneva to complete the Geneva Bible, along with William Whittingham. Whittingham was the inspiration for this resourceful, yet prodigious task of translating the Bible because it was an extension of his New Testament of 1557. Gilby played an important role in Whittingham‚Äôs idea for the Bible. Whittingham himself gave witness to Gilby‚Äôs role in the translation of the Geneva Bible and recorded it in a piece entitled Livre des Anglais.Danner, Dan G. \\"Anthony Gilby: Puritan in Exile: A Biographical Approach.\\" American Society of Church History 40.4 (1971): 412‚Äì422. Web. The Geneva Bible contained easy-to-read maps, indexes, and notes for the interested reader. This nature of writing style dated back to the writing of William Tyndale, who also produced an English translation of the New Testament. The translators, including Anthony Gilby, created a piece of literature that was able to influence readers of all types during the sixteenth century, including Shakespeare and Milton. Many years later, the Geneva Bible was exchanged for the King James version of 1611, which was more acceptable to the King. Once the Geneva Bible was finished, Gilby finally returned to England in May 1560 and his masterpiece was published only a few weeks later. Gilby is accredited with supervising the translation and writing the annotations. However, his weakness was textual criticism, since he relinquished this part of the process to the other translators - Thomas Sampson, Thomas Bentham, William Cole, and Whittingham. The key attributes of the Geneva Bible were its print-type and size, the separation into quartos and octavos, the sectioning into verses, and the use of italics to signify the addition of words. But to Gilby‚Äôs acclaim, the most meaningful of all the characteristics were the annotations. These explanatory notes presented a political view of the history of England. Gilby‚Äôs first attempt as a translator had occurred in 1551, when he wrote a commentary on Micah. This text and the preface, both the work of Gilby, are highly significant because they corresponded to the techniques used by the translators in translating the Geneva Bible. Under Elizabeth After Mary Tudor's death, Gilby and other Protestant writers wrote a letter to specific English Church congregations in Aarau and Frankfurt, attempting to persuade them to support the restoration of Protestantism. On his return to England when Elizabeth I ascended the throne, he became involved in the vestments controversy, and remained a dissident and polemicist. Though not very close to the Presbyterians of the Church of England, he supported John Field and Thomas Wilcox in their First Admonition to Parliament (1572), which was an advocacy of Presbyterianism.Gordon Donaldson, The Scottish Reformation (1972), p. 189. He found a powerful protector in Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon, and was able to live out his life as a lecturer at Ashby-de-la-Zouch.Claire Cross, Church and People 1450‚Äì1660 (1976), p. 133. By assiduous networking, and the influence he had over education at the Ashby grammar school, Gilby became a Puritan leader. Huntingdon assured the continuation of the local evangelical tradition, after Gilby's death, by appointing Arthur Hildersham as rector at Ashby in 1587.William Gibson, Robert G. Ingram, Religious identities in Britain, 1660‚Äì1832 (2005), p. 24. Works Anthony Gilby's writing experience can be placed into three categories, including letters and treaties, the translation of the Geneva Bible and other minor commentaries, and his theological interests before and during the exile. In November 1555, Anthony Gilby and Christopher Goodman, also a Marian Exile, both became clergymen of the Word of God for the English citizens of Geneva. After taking this oath, Anthony Gilby's accomplishments were mostly clerical, such as a letter written in 1558 to the English church encouraging uniformity to God after the news of Elizabeth's succession to the throne of England.Danner, Dan G. \\"Anthony Gilby: Puritan in Exile: A Biographical Approach.\\" American Society of Church History 40.4 (1971): 412‚Äì422. Web. Before and during his exile, Gilby proceeded with the reform of religion throughout the Protestant Reformation. His religious interests, for instance, became one of his prominent efforts. His doctrine of predestination, in which he discussed the supremacy of God, is represented in the Geneva Bible‚Äôs explanatory notes. He also wrote a preface to The Appellation from the Sentence Pronounced by the Bishops and Clergy by John Knox called An Admonition to England and Scotland, to call them to Repentance, in 1558. Some of his additional works include: *Commentaries of the divine, John Calvin, upon the Prophet Daniel (1570) *The psalms of David truly opened and explained by Theodore Beza (1580) *A Pleasant Dialogue betweene a Souldior of Barwicke and an English Chaplaine External Links * Gilby - A Brief Treatise of Election and Reprobation 1556 Notes ;Attribution Category:1510 births Category:1585 deaths Category:English translators Category:People from Lincolnshire Category:16th-century English writers Category:16th-century male writers Category:16th-century English Puritan ministers Category:16th-century translators ","title":"Anthony Gilby"},{"id":"20067459","text":"Rubber Plantation in Chempanoda Chempanoda/Chempanod is a village towards the north east of Kozhikode district of Kerala in India.

The wetland and the lake were formed by constructing the headworks across the Sutlej river in 1953. The headworks is located downstream of the confluence of the Beas and Sutlej rivers just south of Harike village. The rich biodiversity of the wetland which plays a vital role in maintaining the precious hydrological balance in the catchment with its vast concentration of migratory fauna of waterfowls including a number of globally threatened species (stated to be next only to the Keoladeo National Park near Bharatpur) has been responsible for the recognition accorded to this wetland in 1990, by the Ramsar Convention, as one of the Ramasar sites in India, for conservation, development and preservation of the ecosystem.http://ramsar.wetlands.org/Portals/15/India.pdf Wetland name: Harike Lakehttp://www.ramsar.org/forum/forum_india_harike.htm Update on the Harike Wetland, Indiahttp://www.punenvis.nic.in/water_wetland_status.htm . Status of wetlands This man-made, riverine, lacustrine wetland spreads into the three districts of Tarn Taran Sahib, Ferozepur and Kapurthala in Punjab and covers an area of 4100 ha. Conservation of this wetland has been given due importance, since 1987-88, both by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India and the Punjab State Government (through its several agencies), and over the years several studies and management programmes have been implemented.http://www.pscst.com/en/pdfs/Conservation%20Programmes%20for%20Wetlands.pdf Conservation Programmes for Wetlands  Access  Harike or Hari-ke-Pattan as it is popularly called, is the nearest town to the wetland is Makhu (Ferozepur) Railway Station and Bus Stand is situated 10 km south of the Harike town, which connects to Ferozpur, Faridkot and Bhatinda by the National Highway.  Hydrology and engineering aspects  Monsoon climate dominates the catchment draining into the wetland. The headworks built on the Sutlej River downstream of its confluence with Beas River and the reservoir created, which form the Harike lake and the enlarged wetland, is a purposeful project, which acts as the headworks for irrigation and drinking water supplies, through the Ferozepur, Rajasthan and Makku feeder canals with total carrying capacity of , to supply to the command areas located in the states of Punjab and Rajasthan. The grand Indira Gandhi Canal in Rajasthan is fed from this source. The lake is triangular, with its apex in the west, bounded by a bund called the Dhussi Bund forming one side, a canal in the second and a major road on the third. The periphery of the lake is surrounded by agricultural land and the wetland is reported to be rich in ground water resources.  Water quality  The Punjab State Council for Science & Technology has reported that the water quality of the lake is mostly of 'A' Class as per the designated best use criteria even though large volumes of polluted water discharge into the wetland from industries and urban centres.  Biodiversity  The rich biodiversity of the wetland, with several species of birds, turtles, snakes, amphibians, fishes and invertebrates, is reportedly unique. = Bird sanctuary = The wetland was declared a bird sanctuary in 1982 and named as Harike Pattan Bird Sanctuary with an extended area of 8600 ha.http://www.toursandtravelsinindia.com/nationalpark/harike_pattan_sanctuary.html Harike Pattan Sanctuary Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) carried out research and a bird ringing programme during the period 1980-85. An ornithological field laboratory was proposed to be established by BNHS. 200 species of birds visit the wetland during winter season of which some of the well known species (some are pictured in the gallery) are the cotton pygmy goose (Nettapus coromandelianus), tufted duck (Aythya fuligula), yellow- crowned woodpecker (Dendrocopos mahrattensis), yellow-eyed pigeon (Columba eversmanni), water cock (Gallicrex cinerea), Pallas's gull (Ichthyaetus ichthyaetus), brown-headed gull (Chroicocephalus brunnicephalus), black-headed gull (Chroicocephalus ridibundus), yellow-footed gull (Larus michahellis), Indian skimmer (Rynchops albicollis), white-winged tern (Chlidonias leucopterus), white-rumped vulture (Gyps bengalensis), hen harrier (Circus cyaneus), Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus), hawk (subfamily Accipitrinae), Eurasian hobby (Falco subbuteo), horned grebe (Podiceps auritus), black-necked grebe (Podiceps nigricollis), great crested grebe (Podiceps cristatus), white-browed fantail (Rhipidura aureola), brown shrike (Lanius cristatus), common woodshrike (Tephrodornis pondicerianus), white- tailed stonechat (Saxicola leucurus), white-crowned penduline tit (Remiz coronatus), rufous-vented grass babbler (Laticilla burnesii), striated grassbird (Megalurus palustris), Cetti's warbler (Cettia cetti), sulphur- bellied warbler (Phylloscopus griseolus) and diving duck. = Vegetation = Water hyacinth in the wetland The wetland's rich floating vegetation comprises the following: * Eichhornia crassipes dominates in 50% of the area. * Azolla sp. are sparsely seen in open water areas. * Nelumbo nucifera, the lotus, is the prominent rooted floating vegetation. * Ipomoea aquatica, is at the lake periphery in the shallower regions. * Najas, Hydrilla, Ceratophyllum, Potamogeton, Vallisneria (eelgrass, tape grass vallis) and Charales are the species of submerged vegetation * Typha sp. str the dominant emergent marsh vegetation. * Tiny floating islets are formed by Eichhornia crassipes and other grass species in the mud and root zone all over the wetland. Dalbergia sissoo, Acacia nilotica, Zizyphus sp., Ficus sp., alien Prosopis juliflora in large clumps and other trees are planted along the embankment. The State Wildlife Department has constructed earthen mounds in the marsh area with trees planted on it to increase nesting sites for the birds. = Aqua fauna= Endangered turtles and smooth-coated otters, listed in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals, are found in the wetland. 26 species of fish are recorded which include rohu, catla, Puntius, Cirrhina, Channa, Mystus, Chitala chitala, Cyprinus, and Ambassis ranga. Invertebrates recorded are: molluscs (39 & 4 taxa), insects (6 & 32 taxa), crustaceans (27 taxa), annelids (7 taxa), nematodes (7 & 4 taxa), rotifers (59 & 13 taxa), and protozoans (5 & 21 taxa). = Indus dolphins = Comparative size of the river dolphin Indus river dolphin The Indus dolphin (Platanista gangetica minor) supposed to have become extinct in India after 1930, but largely found in the Indus River system in Pakistan, was recently sighted in the Beas River in Harike wetland area. This aquatic mammal classified as an endangered species in the Red Data Book of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources is considered a significant find. The dolphins were discovered by Basanta Rajkumar, IFS who was the officer in charge of the area while touring the area on a motorboat on the morning of 14 December 2007. Freshwater dolphin conservationist of the World Wildlife Fund India team, who were called in to help in surveying the area after the discovery, sighted a family of half a dozen dolphins at two different places along the 25-km stretch upstream of the Beas and thus confirmed the veracity of the claim made by the forest officials of the state government. An authority on freshwater dolphins with the endangered species management wing of the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun has also confirmed this finding. Discovering it in 2007, which was declared by the United Nations as Dolphin Year, was considered a special event. However, in the same Beas River, about 140 km downstream of the Harike Barrage in Pakistan territory, Indus dolphins are commonly found.http://www.wwfindia.org/about_wwf/what_we_do/freshwater_wetlands/wetland_news/index.cfm The dolphin returns = Gharials = The gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) was once found in great numbers in the Indus River system before its population dwindled and it is now classified as critically endangered in the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List of Endangered Species. The Punjab Government is now planning to release 10 gharials in the Harike Wetlands as the first step to increase their numbers and to attract more tourists.  Wetland degradation  The wetland which is in existence since 1953 underwent changes over the years because of several factors, some of which are: * Encroachments on the wetland habitat for intensive agriculture with resultant effluents of agricultural chemicals and also controversial encroachments. * Utilization of surface and ground waters for irrigation * Effluent discharge of untreated waste from towns and villages from industrial, urban and agricultural activities into the rivers which feed the wetland resulting in extensive weed growth (water hyacinth) in the wetland (polluted water discharged was reported to be about 700 million liters per day (mld) * The profuse growth of water hyacinth had covered 80 per cent of the open water surface resulting in the 33 islands getting enclosed. * Soil erosion and siltation due to deforestation of the fragile lower Shivalik hills which form the catchment of the wetland * Illegal fishing and poaching in spite of the Wildlife (Protection) Act. * Indiscriminate grazing in the catchments resulting in damage to the wetland ecology * A remote sensing study of the Wetland area coupled with the analysis of rainfall, discharge and ground water level showed that the flow pattern had diminished and the size of wetland area had reduced by about 30%, over a 13 years study period. * The ecological crisis had reached such a stage that environmentalists estimated lifespan of the wetland to be discreasing.  Restoration measures  The gravity of the degraded status of the wetland has been addressed for implementing several restoration measures by a plethora of organizations/agencies/research institutions of the central and state governments and also the Indian Army Units located in the area. The measures undertaken to conserve the wetland have covered the following actions. The Chief Minister of the State of Punjab instituted, in 1998, the Harike Wetland Conservation Mission to: > a) To prepare a Master Plan for the integrated conservation and development > of the Harike wetland; b) To undertake specific projects and programmes for > the conservation of the ecosystem of the Harike region; c) To regulate, > screen and monitor all development activities which have a bearing on the > Harike wetland ecosystem; d) To evaluate all plans and proposals of all > departments of the Government which concern the future of Harike'' * The menace of water hyacinth was addressed by the Indian Army (Western Command, Vajra Corps.) in the year 2000, in a joint effort initiated by the Chief Minister of the State. Under the pilot project named \\"Sahyog\\" the Army adopted several innovative mechanical system of weed removal. The Army General reporting on the progress of the works stated: > Through a number of innovative methods, we succeeded in making dynamic > booms, and winches etc. After the operation, we have placed static and > dynamic booms at strategic points in the Harike Lake to hold back the > floating mats of water hyacinth so that it doesn't spread. At the end of six > months of untiring labour by our team, we had opened four channels, which > had got choked with silt over the years. We also planted 750 saplings of > plants of two years of age on the island for birds to nest and roost in > future. * The Punjab State Council for Science and Technology evolved a management plan which involved: ** Opening of sluice gates during monsoon ** Monitoring of water quality migration period ** Fencing some of the selected portions from encroachment ** Afforestation of the catchment area ** Survey, mapping & notification ** Soil Conservation ** Education and Public awareness  World wetlands day  On 2 February 2003 the World Wetlands Day was celebrated at Harike with the watchword \\"No-wetlands-No Water\\", which also marked the \\"International Year of Freshwater\\".

It was decided by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at that time the court of last resort within the British Empire, on appeal from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario, Canada. Because decisions of the Judicial Committee have persuasive value in the United Kingdom, even when decided under the law of another member of the Commonwealth, this decision has been followed in the United Kingdom courts. In UK company law, the case would now be seen as falling within the Companies Act 2006 section 175, with a failure to have ratification of breach by independent shareholders under section 239. Facts The Toronto Construction Co. had four directors, Mr GM Deeks, Mr GS Deeks, Mr Hinds, and Mr Cook. It helped in construction of railways in Canada. The first three directors wanted to exclude Mr Cook from the business. Each held a quarter of the company's shares. GM Deeks, GS Deeks, and Hinds took a contract with the Canadian Pacific Railway Company (for building a line at the Guelph Junction and Hamilton branch) in their own names. They then passed a shareholder resolution declaring that the company had no interest in the contract. Mr Cook claimed that the contract did belong to the Toronto Construction Co and the shareholder resolution ratifying their actions should not be valid because the three directors used their votes to carry it. Decision The Privy Council advised that the three directors had breached their duty of loyalty to the company, that the shareholder ratification was a fraud on Mr Cook as a minority shareholder, and invalid.

Carsten Herrmann-Pillath (born 24 February 1959 in Dessau, Bezirk Halle) is a German economist and sinologist. He is the professor of Evolutionary economics and Permanent Fellow at the Max Weber Centre for Advanced Cultural and Social Studies, Erfurt University, Germany. After education in economics and classical Chinese studies he received a PhD in economics at the University of Cologne, Germany (1978-1988). Between 1988 and 1992 he was researcher, China desk, at the Federal Institute of East European and International Studies, Cologne. In 1992 he was appointed professor in Chinese economic studies at the Gerhard Mercator University of Duisburg, Germany. Between 1996 and 2008 he was Chair of Evolutionary and Institutional Economics and Director of the Institute of Comparative Research into Culture and Economy at the Private University of Witten/Herdecke, Germany, where he also founded the Sino-German School of Governance (2005-2010). In 2008, he moved to Frankfurt School of Finance and Management and established the East West Centre for Business Studies and Cultural Science, combined with a Master Program in International Business, as a successor organization of the school. Between 2015 and 2016, he resumed a position as Professor of Economics and Evolutionary Sciences at Witten/Herdecke University. In May 2016, he was appointed Permanent Fellow at the Max Weber Centre. He is Distinguished Visiting Professor of Schwarzman Scholars at Tsinghua University, Beijing. Herrmann-Pillath is a leading representative of evolutionary economics and Chinese studies in Germany. His research aims at developing a cross-disciplinary theory of the economy which takes account of institutional and cultural embeddedness. Building on modern philosophical resources (ontology, philosophy of language), he approaches economics as a bridging science between the natural sciences and the humanities. Herrmann-Pillath contributed widely to the cross-disciplinary foundations of economics, with applications in empirical research and policy design, especially in research on the Chinese economy and international trade policy. His essential philosophical resources are Hegel and Peirce. In the field of evolutionary and ecological economics, he proposes a theory of economic growth that takes the concepts of energy and information as fundamental building blocks. He elaborates on a naturalistic theory of institutions, taking money as a central application, which combines modern neuroeconomics and behavioural economics with Masahiko Aoki's theory of institutions. His institutional theory focuses on the notion of ‚Äòperformativity‚Äô and ties up with recent developments in sociology and philosophy (actor-network theory, science and technology studies). In the field of international economics, he proposes the new paradigm of ‚Äòdeliberative trade policy‚Äô, with applications on the WTO. His long-time research on China has been condensed in a cultural theory of the Chinese economy, that centres on the concept of ‚Äòritual‚Äô.

The book received generally positive reviews from critics. It won the Commonwealth Foundation's Best First Book prize in 2009, and was shortlisted for the Guardian First Book Award.  Plot summary  The central theme of the book is a fictitious story behind the real-life plane crash which killed General Zia, president of Pakistan from 1977 to 1988, about which there are many conspiracy theories. After witnessing a tank parade in Bahawalpur, Pakistan on August 17, 1988, Zia leaves the small Punjabi town in the C-130 Hercules aircraft designated \\"Pak One,\\" along with several of his senior army officials, the US Ambassador to Pakistan Arnold Raphel, and some crates of mangoes. Shortly after a smooth takeoff, the control tower loses contact with the aircraft. Witnesses who saw the plane in the air later claim it was flying erratically, before nosediving and exploding on impact, killing all 31 on board. Zia had ruled Pakistan for 11 years prior to his death. Lazy, irreverent Ali Shigri narrates the story. Ali's father, Col. Quli Shigri, has recently died in what was called a suicide, but Ali discovers that his father was killed by a rogue ISI officer, Major Kiyani, under Zia's orders. The story takes place in the months before the plane crash, jumping back and forth between Ali's revenge plans and his third-person observations of Zia's life. Ali attends the Pakistani Air Force Academy with his fellow cadets and their instructors. His best friend is Cadet \\"Baby O\\" Obaid, his roommate and lover. Interspersed between pieces of Ali's narrative are glimpses into the lives of other key Pakistani and American political players: Chief of Pakistani Intelligence General Akhtar Abdur Rahman, American ambassador to Pakistan Arnold Raphel, and President Zia ul-Haq himself. The book also touches on the perspectives of some of Zia's closest confidants. Over the course of the book, Zia grows ever more suspicious of those in his inner circle until he is driven utterly mad by his own paranoia. Every morning, he asks his chief of security, \\"Who's trying to kill me?\\" A devout Muslim, he attends daily prayers, where he weeps loudly (an occurrence to which the other worshippers have become accustomed). He fights with his wife and takes every opportunity to leer at non-Muslim cleavage. In one subplot, General Zia sentences Zainab, a blind woman, to death by stoning for being the victim of a gang rape. According to Zia‚Äôs sharia court, she has committed adultery. For condemning her, Zainab calls down a curse upon Zia. The curse is picked up by a sugar-obsessed crow. In another subplot, Arnold Raphel holds a Fourth of July party in Islamabad. A young, bearded Saudi known as \\"OBL\\" attends. OBL works for Laden and Co. Constructions, making this a clear reference to, and a cameo by, Osama bin Laden. Ali's revenge plot consists of stabbing Zia in the eye with his under-officer sword, a move he practices daily in secret. But Baby O concocts a new plot to kill Zia by crashing a plane kamikaze-style down on him. He even goes so far as to steal a plane for the job, but in doing so, he accidentally lands Ali in prison at Lahore Fort, a torture center. While there, Ali listens to the screams of his tortured fellow prisoners and talks via a hole in the wall with the \\"Secretary General\\" who has been in solitary confinement there for nine years. Ali eventually learns that his own father is the one responsible for turning Lahore Fort into a torture center (\\"Nice work, Dad,\\" he responds). Meanwhile, Major Kiyani appears on the scene, intending to torture Ali. A sudden change in ISI command takes place, and Ali is freed in time to avoid torture. Upon his arrival back at the Pakistani Air Force Academy, he learns that he has been chosen as part of the squad that will perform a silent drill salute for Zia. Ali will finally have his opportunity, and he decides to stake his revenge plot on the use of snake venom from Uncle Starchy (launderer for PAF Academy), injected into Zia's hand via Ali's sword. After the silent drill salute, Zia boards the doomed Pak One. The novel does not confirm whether or not Ali is successful in his attempt to assassinate General Zia. Rather, several alternatives are offered: the curse-carrying crow that crashed into the plane's engines while pursuing the mangoes, an explosive planted in the mangoes by the All Pakistan Sweepers Union in revenge for the death of their general-secretary at the hands of Major Kiyani, or one of Zia's confidants, each with their own secrets and motivations. The book even speculates that it could be the work of the CIA.  Themes  = Corruption = General Akhtar Abdul Rehman is the chief of ISI under General Zia. He controlled the tremendously great ISI and falls resentfully to second in importance, command, and control to General Zia ul- Haq. The ISI with its government agent systems and the measure of financing makes General Akhtar an exceptionally well-off and dangerous man. As ISI is in charge of piping the assets and weapons to the Afghan mujahideen, the book indicates that every one of these assets are not given to the mujahideen. The millions are occupied somewhere else, to people with great influence, General Akhtar chief among them. = Global politics = The book explores the seemingly self-contradictory nature of American policy in the Middle East during this time. Much time is spent discussing the joint US-Pakistan effort to support Afghan mujahideen guerilla fighters against Soviet forces in the 1980s. Hanif writes, \\"Would-be supporters of the jihad against the Soviets were sent cards carrying a picture of a dead Afghan child (caption: Better dead than red).\\" Readers are reminded that the US enthusiastically collaborated with General Zia to finance, train, and supply the Afghan mujahideen in their insurgency. It was Zia who permitted the shipment of American arms and billions of American dollars to the rebels, and who allowed the border regions of Pakistan to be used as their haven and training base. Hanif highlights the irony in America wanting to purge the world of one type of authoritarianism by cultivating another. By propping up an unhinged dictator like Zia and conspiring with violent radicals, Hanif believes that the U.S. demonstrates that it will manipulate any weaker actor it can into being a pawn in their foreign policy strategy. = Islamism = Throughout the book, Zia remains convinced he is guided by Allah and feels he is receiving ominous messages straight out of the Quran predicting his demise. During his presidency Zia was credited for the Islamization of Pakistan. He was committed to enforcing his interpretation of Nizam-e-Mustafa (\\"Rule of the prophet\\" Muhammad), i.e. to establish an Islamic state and enforce sharia law. Hanif depicts this in a negative light to expose the hypocrisies he believes are present in political Islam.

Professional career McLeod was already known as one of Australia's more talented point guards when the new NBL started in 1979. He joined his home town team the Illawarra Hawks for the inaugural season playing 17 games and averaging 10.1 points per game. McLeod was appointed captain of the Hawks and would continue to lead the team until the end of the 1982 season. After 82 games in the red and white of Illawarra he would sign with the Sydney Supersonics for 1983. After just one season in Sydney, McLeod would re-join the Hawks from 1984, regaining the club captaincy. His return helped the Hawks make the NBL playoffs for the first time in the club's history. The team lost the Elimination Final 101‚Äì108 to the Newcastle Falcons. McLeod had a career best 15.8 points per game during the 1984 NBL season. The Hawks missed the finals in 1985 but the club made it as far as the semi-finals in 1986 where they lost to eventual champions Adelaide and again in 1987 where they lost a three-game series again to the eventual league champions, the Brisbane Bullets. McLeods own form saw him score 9.1 points per game in 1986 and 12.4 points per game in 1987. Following the 1988 season, McLeod again left the Illawarra Hawks, this time joining the Hobart Devils. He would play two seasons with the struggling Devils before joining 1990 NBL grand finalist Brisbane for the 1991 season. After the Bullets failed to repeat their 1990 form and failed to make the NBL finals, McLeod retired from playing professional basketball at the age of 34. International career McLeod played for the Australian Boomers at the 1978 FIBA World Championship in the Philippines, helping the team to a then best 7th place. He also represented the Boomers at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow where the team finished in 8th position despite the boycott of the games by the gold medal favourite United States. Coaching career McLeod started his NBL coaching career with a 2-game stint as player-coach for the Cascade Tassie Devils in 1989 before becoming the first head coach of the West Sydney Razorbacks in 1998. He would lead the team to the 2002 NBL grand final series against the Adelaide 36ers though the Razorbacks would lose the three game series one game to two. He would lead the Razorbacks to a second NBL grand final in the 2003‚Äì04 NBL season. In the first ever five game series the Razorbacks would lose to their cross-town rivals the Sydney Kings 2‚Äì3 in a close series. After leading by as much as 17 points in the 3rd period and 79‚Äì72 with only 3:10 left in the deciding Game 5, the 'Pigs' were overrun by a suddenly red-hot Kings team who scored the last 18 points of the game to win 90‚Äì79. Despite leading them to the Grand Final in 2004, McLeod was not retained by the Razorbacks for the 2004‚Äì05 NBL season. He would sign to be the head coach of the league's new Singapore Slingers team for the 2006‚Äì07 NBL season, leading them to the NBL playoffs in their first year in the league. After the Slingers withdrew from the NBL following the 2007‚Äì08 season, McLeod was appointed as assistant coach of the Aussie Boomers squad for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing where they finished in 7th place with a 3‚Äì3 record. McLeod re-joined the Wollongong Hawks as head coach for the 2009‚Äì10 NBL season, leading the team to a second place regular season finish with a 16‚Äì12 record. The Hawks fought their way into their third NBL grand final where they lost one game to two to the Perth Wildcats. McLeod was rewarded for his coaching efforts during the season as he won his first NBL Coach of the Year award. The Hawks had an injury hit season in 2010‚Äì11 and they just missed the playoffs despite a 15‚Äì13 record. McLeod finished the year with a career NBL coaching record of 149‚Äì173, moving him to 14th in all time coaching career wins.

The film is an adaptation of the story The Pinnacle by Stroheim.The American Film Institute Catalog Feature Films: 1911-20 by The American Film Institute, c.1988 Plot A group of holiday-makers arrive at Cortina d'Ampezzo, an Alpine village in the Dolomites. Among them are an American Doctor who does not pay much attention to his wife and an Austrian Lieutenant, who decides to seduce her. He manages to befriend the couple so that, when the Doctor has to leave to help a local physician, he asks the Lieutenant to look after his wife. When the Lieutenant becomes too pressing, she promises to leave with him but asks him to give her more time. During the night, she puts a letter under the door of his bedroom. The Doctor goes on a climbing expedition with the Lieutenant, who had been bragging about his exploits as a mountaineer. In fact, he is not in very good shape and the Doctor must help him to reach the summit. In the process, the Doctor finds his wife's letter in the pocket of the Lieutenant's jacket, but before he can read it, the Lieutenant throws it away. He asks the Lieutenant whether his wife had promised to leave with him and the Lieutenant gives a positive answer. The Doctor decides to leave him on the summit and starts his descent, despite the Lieutenant now saying that he has been lying because he thought the Doctor would not believe the truth. On his way back, the Doctor finds his wife's letter, in which she had written that she loved only her husband and asked the Lieutenant not to bother her any longer with his attentions. While pondering whether he should go back to get the Lieutenant, he loses his balance and falls down. When the Doctor is finally saved by soldiers, he asks them to go and help the Lieutenant. Before they can reach him, the Lieutenant, attacked by vultures, falls to his death from the precipice.Review, synopsis and link to watch the film: Cast * Sam De Grasse as Doctor Robert Armstrong, the husband * Francelia Billington as Margaret Armstrong, the wife * Erich von Stroheim as Lieutenant Eric Von Steuben * Gibson Gowland as Silent Sepp, the mountain guide * Fay Holderness as The jealous waitress * Ruby Kendrick as A village blossom * Valerie Germonprez as The honeymooning bride * Jack Perrin as The honeymooning groom * Richard Cummings as Dr. Brunner, the village physician * Louis Fitzroy as The village priest * William De Vaull as A man from home * Jack Mathes as A man from home * Percy Challenger as A man from home Background Von Stroheim entered the Hollywood film industry in 1914 as an extra and horse handler on the greatest cinematic spectacle of the period, D. W. Griffith‚Äôs The Birth of a Nation (1915).Koszarski, 1983 p. 14: Stroheim ‚Äúa trained rider and expert horse handler...had little trouble finding work on this lavish production [with] costly spectacle sequences...This was the film that introduce Erich von Stroheim to the movies.‚Äù Von Stroheim made persistent, but futile efforts to find work with the Griffith production unit after filming was completed. By chance, he had an encounter with Broadway director John Emerson, impressing him with his sartorial knowledge of formal military dress. This led to a small role in a film adaption of Ibsen‚Äôs Ghosts with Mutual Film productions, followed by his first screen-credited feature later that year in Farewell to Thee (1915). Emerson soon enlisted von Stroheim to serve ‚Äúas actor, assistant and technical advisor‚Äù on the 1915 production of Old Heidelburg (1915), beginning a two-year professional relationship and ‚Äúthe single most important influence on von Stroheim‚Äôs early career.‚Äù Von Stroheim‚Äôs fortunes rose with those of Emerson when the producer obtained a contract to direct a number of features starring Douglas Fairbanks.Koszarski, 1983 p. 18Gallagher, 2009: ‚ÄúRumors of Austrian nobility and military greatness surrounded von Stroheim from the beginning1 and were seemingly corroborated by his on-set behavior, which included self- proclaiming himself an expert on both military regalia (in order to become wardrobe supervisor to Henry B. Walthall on Ghosts in 1915). The latter secured him a position on John Emerson‚Äôs adaptation of Old Heidelberg, for which von Stroheim was responsible for the casting and costuming of the ‚Äústudent corps.‚Äù While working as production manager on an adaption of Shakespeare‚Äôs Macbeth for the Triangle Fine Arts studio, von Stroheim was impressed into service as one of several assistant directors on Griffith‚Äôs massive production Intolerance (1916). Von Stroheim may have set up a number of shots in this so-called ‚Äúmodern‚Äù episode of the epic production.Koszarski, 1983 p. 22-23Gallagher, 2009: ‚ÄúVon Stroheim‚Äôs education on the sets of Griffith‚Äôs Birth of a Nation and Intolerance formed the basis for his own understanding of cinema. ‚ÄúI worshiped D.W. Griffith the way that someone can worship the man who has taught him everything.‚Äù Though never one of Griffith‚Äôs inner circle, von Stroheim apprenticeship imbued him with the director‚Äôs‚Äîhis obsession with linking settings with his players character development. The ‚Äúfussy perfectionism‚Äù and attention to detail displayed by von Stroheim in his own films is a legacy of Griffith‚Äôs profound influence.Koszarski, 1983 p. 23-24: ‚Äú The emphasis on ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô relationship between character and setting made a tremendous impact on von Stroheim. Griffith‚Äôs other assistants never quite grasped the reason for D.W.'s ‚Äòfussy perfectionism‚Äô. Von Stroheim saw and learned...he never chided Griffith as a romantic dreamer, for he, too, shared the same dream.‚ÄùGallagher, 2009: ‚ÄúTraces of Griffith‚Äôs signature style are present throughout von Stroheim‚Äôs work. The presentational mise-en-scene that privileges both the actor‚Äôs expression and the obsessively, painstakingly detailed sets; poetic (sometimes excessively so) title-cards; idyllic, romantic interludes that off-set an otherwise realist aesthetic; close-ups that reveal the character‚Äôs soul (for Griffith often signs of purity, for von Stroheim corruption); and a dexterous use of montage to maneuver around a set, or to cross-cut different scenes for dramatic effect. Von Stroheim often takes Griffith‚Äôs stylizations to their furthest extreme, strictly adhering to montage and rarely moving the camera (defiantly against-the-times, as filmmakers were more and more employing expressive lighting and tracking shots). With the United States‚Äô entry into the First World War in 1917 against Germany, the Hollywood studios and distributors became anxious about presenting audiences with ‚ÄúTeutonic‚Äù figures. Von Stroheim name was dropped from cast billings, then he was discharged entirely from Douglas Fairbank‚Äôs production company. When the studios turned to pro-American, pro-war and anti- German propaganda films, opportunities arose for actors who could convincingly portray Prussian military villains. Von Stroheim ‚Äútook advantage of his looks, name and reputation, and carved out a new career as a professional Hun.‚ÄùKoszarski, 1983 p. 24-25 As an expert in German military uniforms and paraphernalia, Von Strohiem returned to Paramount Pictures to serve as advisor to D. W. Griffith on Hearts of the World and at Famous Players-Lasky on The Hun Within, both 1918.Koszarski, 1983 p. 26-27 When von Stroheim was hired by Universal Studios to star in The Heart of Humanity (1918) opposite Dorothy Phillips, he came prepared to contribute his ‚Äúeagerness and proficiency‚Äù to every aspect of the production. Possessing directorial expertise acquired under Griffith‚Äôs influence, Von Stroheim ‚Äúhonestly felt himself to be Griffith‚Äôs true heir.‚Äù His inflammatory portrayal of Prussian lieutenant Eric von Eberhard, von Stroheim made his screen image notorious to the American public, particularly a scene in which he snatches an infant from its cradle and casts it from a two-story window.Koszarski, 1983 p. 27, p.29: ‚Äú...the scene were von Stroheim throws the baby out the window...‚ÄùGallagher,, 2009: ‚ÄúThere is an honest depravity to his characters, none of whom shy away from, or apologize for, their amoral desires. The philandering wife of Blind Husbands and the duplicitous seducer of Foolish Wives are certainly a world away from the True Heart Susies of D.W. Griffith or the Pollyannas portrayed by Mary Pickford.‚Äù Pre-Production At the peak of the Spanish Influenza in late 1918, von Stroheim attempted to interest film studios in his script-in- progress entitled The Pinnacle, concerning an American couple and an Austrian Lieutenant in a m√©nage √† trois. He decided his best prospect for funding would be Carl Laemmle at Universal studios, where von Stroheim had recently completed the profitable The Heart of Humanity. Laemmle, of German birth and ethnicity was known to hire German-speaking countrymen, an important consideration for von Stroheim when post-war ‚Äúanti-German hysteria‚Äù briefly persisted in the United States.Koszarski, 1983 p. 32-33 Unlike other established studios such as Paramount and First National Pictures that often produced elaborate and expensive features with top-rank stars, Laemmle‚Äôs vast Universal operation churned out relatively low-budget movies and offered parsimonious contracts for its actors and technicians, ensuring a high turnover.Koszarski, 1983 p. 33 Considering Universal‚Äôs frequent need for experienced staff, Von Stroheim approached Laemmle confident that he could enlist the producer in the project with two enticements: von Stroheim would hand over the story and script, gratis, and waive all wages for directing the picture. The only caveat was $200 per week to star in the film. After a short, intense interview, von Stroheim won the support of the movie mogul. The budget for the film was initially estimated at $25,000, and von Stroheim immediately began casting the production for The Pinnacle began on 3 April 1919.Koszarski, 1983 p. 34-35 Production Like Griffith, von Strohiem was averse to hiring theater trained actors and established screen ‚Äústars ‚Äú, preferring to assemble a stock company from ‚Äúuntrained talent‚Äù whom he would mentor to achieve his cinematic goals.Koszarski, 1983 p. 22: ‚Äú...Griffith‚Äôs use of untrained talent, molded by the force of the director‚Äôs will‚Ä¶‚Äù And p. 35: ‚Äú...the cast would be old friends and associates, the beginnings of a stock company system, learned from Griffith, which he would continue through all his later films.‚Äù Actors Francelia Billington and Sam de Grasse would play the American couple on vacation in the Dolomite Alps, both who had been Mutual players. British actor Gibson Gowland would play the mountain guide, Silent Sepp Innerkofler and later star as McTeague in von Stroheim‚Äôs Greed (1924). Von Stroheim played the meddling lover Lieutenant Eric Von Steuben.Koszarski, 1983 p. 34-35. And p. 44: Koszarski see quote. An indication of Lamaelle‚Äôs determination to assure a commercially impressive production, he provided von Stroheim with their top cinematographers Ben Reynolds, and assistant William Daniels, both of whom would serve with the director until he moved to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1924. By the time shooting of Blind Husbands was completed on 12 June 1919, the costs had far exceeded the initial budget estimate. Combined film stock and advertising expenses had reached over $250,000. As such, Blind Husbands emerged as a critically important project. Universal‚Äôs response was to deepen its commitments to success of the production.Koszarski, 1983 p. 37: ‚ÄúIf von Stroheim was counting desperately on the film‚Äôs success, so was Universal.‚Äù Promotional articles were planted in movie magazines that were careful to counter any residual anti-German prejudices. Von Stroheim's personal character was praised and readers reminded of his American citizenship‚Äîa citizenship he would not possess for almost seven years. Press releases assured moviegoers that he had relinquished his royal title of Count and dropped the nobiliary particle ‚Äúvon‚Äù .Koszarski, 1983 p. 37: ‚ÄúNot surprisingly, the more cash the studio sank into the production, the more eager they were to ensure its success by any means possible.‚Äù The methods von Stroheim used to extract impressive performances from his actors were effective, but it required immense amounts of raw footage. Key scenes were performed and re-performed again and again until an ‚Äúideal‚Äù was provoked, often at the price of frustrating the cast and crew. Von Stroheim was then confronted with the task of sifting through this dross-like footage to discover the gems he had elicited on the set.Koszarski, 1983 p. 37-38: Von Stroheim‚Äôs technique ‚Äúinvariably resulted performances of incredible power and conviction. It also resulted in huge amounts of footage [which he was] agonizingly slow to reduce to manageable length.‚Äù By mid-summer studio executives, wishing to expedite its release, submitted the partially edited footage to Grant Whytock, who prepared the final cut for distribution. Universal was sanguine about the prospects for a commercially and critically successful film. A press screening elicited fulsome praise for Blind Husbands and director von Stroheim, including one accolade that anointed him ‚Äúa direct descendant of [D.W] Griffith.‚ÄùKoszarski, 1983 p. 38 When the completed film was delivered to Universal‚Äôs New York City sales department to arrange distribution in August 1919, Universal‚Äôs vice-president, R. H. Cochrane, emphatically rejected the title of the film The Pinnacle. (n.b. The movie‚Äôs climax and denouement occurs at the top of an alpine peak). Film titles, then strictly within the domain of sales and exhibition personnel, initiated a search for a new title. Von Stroheim, outraged, placed a full-page protest in Motion Picture News, without effect. Blind Husbands opened at Washington‚Äôs Rialto Theater on 19 October 1919.Koszarski, 1983 p. 38-39 Critical Response In an effort to maximize anticipated profits for Blind Husbands, Universal launched a massive promotional campaign. Nationwide, the picture grossed over $325,000 in receipts during its first year when typical five-reel feature films averaged $55,000.Koszarski, 1983 p.41 Universal‚Äôs productions, which usually exhibited in less exalted venues, arranged for Blind Husbands to run at New York‚Äôs ‚Äúpalatial‚Äù Capitol theater though this required a months-long delay.Koszarski, 1983 p. 39: ‚ÄúUniversal‚Äôs products were seldom seen in the best Broadway houses, and the studio jumped at the booking.‚Äù Blind Husbands inspired fulsome responses from American film critics and ‚Äúalmost without exception‚Äù both director and his cinematic creation were hailed as an advance for the art form.Koszarski, 1983 p. 40 Agnes Smith of the New York Telegraph wrote: Theme Blind Husbands, set amidst a tourist resort in the Austrian Dolomites, opens with the arrival of an upper-middle American couple, Dr. Robert Armstrong and his wife Margaret. The story examines their reaction to the strenuous efforts of an Austrian military officer, Lieutenant Eric von Steuben, to seduce Margaret. Von Stroheim‚Äôs characterization of an unscrupulous yet sophisticated sexual predator was a refined variation of his role of ‚Äúthe man you love to hate‚Äù that he had cultivated in his post-WWI roles, most recently in Universal‚Äôs The Heart of Humanity (1918). Here, however, von Stroheim seeks sexual conquest through low cunning, rather than with psychological terror and physical violence.Koszarski, 1983 p.41: ‚Äú The lieutenant‚Äôs part was an extension of ‚Äòthe man you love to hate‚Äô, the Prussian villain created by von Stroheim in films like The Hearts of Humanity...the film concerns itself with how the overly civilized [Armstrongs] react to the intrusion of this disturbing element.‚Äù The original title of the movie,The Pinnacle, was based on von Stroheim's original screenplay and served as a metaphor that resonated physiologically with the picture‚Äôs climax, in which Dr. Armstrong and Lieutenant von Steuben struggle for dominance on a lofty alpine mountain peak. Von Stroheim, outraged at Universal‚Äôs substitution of the title with ‚ÄúBlind Husbands‚Äù provoked a public denunciation from the director, defending ‚ÄúThe Pinnacle‚Äù as ‚Äúa meaningful title, a title that meant everything to the man who created [the film].‚Äù The title ‚ÄúBlind Husbands‚Äù invokes the ‚Äúaristocratic American visitors‚Äù and Dr. Armstrong who ‚Äúfails to exhibit any signs of romantic affection‚Äù towards his attractive wife, a failure that the ‚Äúlounge lizard‚Äù von Steuben expects to exploit. The complacent doctor, preoccupied with his alpine hiking, is slow to discern his wife‚Äôs conflicted response to the officer‚Äôs advances.Koszarski, 1983 p.41-42: The two men engage in a ‚Äúsexual duel‚Äù on the mountain peak. Blind Husbands is the only film in which von Stroheim submits members of America‚Äôs leisure class to artistic analysis. This is the same social stratum that the young von Stroheim had serviced as an expert equestrian and a resort guide in Northern California during the years before World War I and before his arrival in Hollywood, a venue where ‚Äúhe seems to have had particular success with the ladies.‚ÄùKoszarski, 1983 p.44-45: ‚Äú...his experiences in the resort hotels of northern California‚Ä¶‚Äù Whereas von Stroheim‚Äôs scenario for Blind Husbands required that his ‚Äúalter ego‚Äù suffer a spectacular death, his subsequent autobiographical representations avoid similar fates.Koszarski, 1983 p.45: ‚ÄúWhen [von Stroheim] came to rewrite this script of a proposed [sound film] in 1930, he made only one major change: the lieutenant no longer had to die.‚Äù A religious component appears in the film to reinforce the film's central metaphor that culminates in a contest on the ‚Äúpinnacle‚Äù. Informed by von Stroheim‚Äôs recent conversion to Catholicism. Blind Husband‚Äôs romantic triangle unfolds during a local celebration of the Gala Peter and the reenactment of Christ‚Äôs transfiguration on Mt. Tabor, an unambiguous reference to the film‚Äôs central theme.Koszarski, 1983 p.42: Von Stroheim ‚Äúincorporates the rituals of [his] adopted Roman Catholicism [and] the combination of sexual and religious imagery.‚Äù The most striking element in von Stroheim‚Äôs thematic scheme is the presentation of a young married woman who seriously contemplates engaging in an extramarital affair, which constitutes ‚Äúa daring break with tradition‚Äù in cinematic treatments of the topic.Koszarski, 1983 p. 42-43: ‚ÄúThat Margaret stops to even consider the attentions of von Steuben was daring break with tradition, and has long been noted as the film‚Äôs most innovative plot element.‚Äù The realism that von Stroheim brings to the first encounter among the principle characters establishes the ‚Äúpsychological complexity‚Äù of this theme. According to film historian Richard Koszarski: That the film and its theme arise from von Stroheim‚Äôs own life experiences is ‚Äúbeyond question‚Äô: the characterization of Lieutenant Eric von Stuben ‚Äúis a direct projection of von Stroheim himself.‚ÄùKoszarski, 1983 p.44 Accolades The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2002: AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions ‚Äì Nominated Survival status A copy of Blind Husbands is in the Museum of Modern Art film archive and in several other collections.

Life Eugene Vaulot was born in Paris in 1923. He trained to be a \\"plumber-heating\\" technician, then volunteered to join the Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism (LVF) in 1941 and fought on the Eastern Front. In 1942‚Äì43, he served with the 1st company. He was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class before being partially disabled from wounds which forced him to leave the L.V.F. in 1943 with the rank of Obergefreiter. In 1944 he volunteered for service with the German Navy (Kriegsmarine) and served with the 6th Company, 28th Schiffstammabteilung. In September 1944, a new unit, the Waffen-Grenadier-Brigade der SS \\"Charlemagne\\", was formed out of the remnants of the LVF and the French Sturmbrigade. Vaulot transferred to this new formation with the rank of Waffen-Unterscharf√ºhrer. Joining him were French collaborators fleeing the Allied advance in the west, as well as Frenchmen from the German Navy, the National Socialist Motor Corps (NSKK), the Organisation Todt and the Milice security police. In February 1945, the unit was officially upgraded to a division and renamed 33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne (1st French) (franz√∂sische Nr.1). At this time it had a strength of 7,340 men. The Charlemagne Division was sent to fight the Red Army in Poland, but on 25 February it was attacked at Hammerstein (present day Czarne) in Pomerania, by troops of the Soviet 1st Belorussian Front. The Soviet forces split the French force into three pockets. One group commanded by SS-Brigadef√ºhrer Gustav Krukenberg survived. It was evacuated from the coast by the German Navy to Denmark and later sent to Neustrelitz for refitting; Vaulot was part of this third group. He was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class for \\"distinguishing himself\\" in combat. =Berlin, 1945= In April 1945, about 350 men volunteered to go to fight in the Battle of Berlin in a unit which became known as Sturmbataillon Charlemagne. Vaulot went with the group to Berlin. During the fighting, Vaulot destroyed two tanks in the Neuk√∂lln sector. Then on 28 April, the Red Army started a full-scale offensive into the central sector. Fighting was intense; the Sturmbataillon Charlemagne was in the center of the battle zone around the Reich Chancellery. Vaulot destroyed six more tanks by Panzerfaust near the F√ºhrerbunker.

Summary The story takes place on Wraithworld, a barely habitable planet with unusual weather conditions, including a permanent mist covering most of the planet, which rises up the mountains during the cooler night. Each morning in a wonderful phenomenon called Mistfall, the mist sinks down the mountains, revealing the beauty of the planet. The planet is home to only a few people, primarily because it is believed that its mist-covered valleys are occupied by \\"wraiths\\", ghostly creatures have been claimed to have killed a number of humans. The mystery of the wraiths is also the main tourist attraction on Wraithworld. The only business establishment on the planet is Castle Cloud, a hotel built near the top of one of the mountains, which is primarily visited by \\"wraith hunters\\", generally people looking for a thrill. At the start of the story, an expensive scientific expedition sets out to either find proof of the wraiths' existence, or establish that they are nothing more than a myth. The story, told in first person by one of the reporters covering the expedition, focuses on the conflict between two viewpoints: the leader of the expedition thinks that factual answers for unknowns always benefit humanity, even on a planet with no attractions other than the mystery; by contrast, the owner of Castle Cloud does not want the mystery resolved -- not because the answer is something that \\"man is not meant to know\\", but because the knowledge will permanently change people's perceptions of the planet, with little scientific gain resulting from the answer.

It is located geographically in Dongjiaotou, Shekou, which lies on the southwestern corner of the city of Shenzhen in Guangdong Province. Some of the area are leased to Hong Kong as Shenzhen Bay Port Hong Kong Port Area operate under Hong Kong jurisdiction until 30 June 2047, the eve of the 50th anniversary of Hong Kong S.A.R. The Port consist of a cross boundary passenger terminal building, which Shenzhen Bay Control Point of Hong Kong, a border checkpoint, co-located with Shenzhen counterpart in the same building. The rest of the Port area are Shenzhen Bay Port Shenzhen Port Area. The port of entry was commissioned on 1 July 2007. History Shenzhen Bay Port is part of the Hong Kong‚ÄìShenzhen Western Corridor, which the Corridor was proposed by the Shenzhen municipal government to the Chinese central government, as well as colonial British government of Hong Kong in the 1990s. Hong Kong became the first special administrative region of China (SAR) on 1 July 1997. In March 2001, a feasibility study by the Hong Kong government, suggested to build the Hong Kong‚ÄìShenzhen Western Corridor. A further inter-government meeting in July 2001 concluded that, the border checkpoint of the Corridor should be co- located in the same place, thus the birth of Shenzhen Bay Port, which was sub- divided into Hong Kong Port Area and Shenzhen Port Area. The name Shenzhen Bay Port () was agreed by another inter-government meeting in August 2004. Hong Kong government also entrusted Shenzhen municipal government to build the facilities of the Shenzhen Bay Port Hong Kong Port Area in July 2004. Some of the facilities was also sub-contracted to Hong Kong firm, such as Hsin Chong‚ÄìAster was responsible for the electrical and mechanical engineering of the Passenger Terminal Building (Hong Kong Side) of the Hong Kong Port Area. Hong Kong government also managed the Shenzhen section of the Shenzhen Bay Bridge, another component of the Corridor, despite geographically inside the boundary of Shenzhen. Shenzhen section of the bridge was in-between the Hong Kong section of the bridge, and the land area of the Port, which partly leased to Hong Kong as Hong Kong Port Area. The Port was opened on 1 July 2007, the 10th anniversary of the SAR, when Hu Jintao, the then General Secretary of the Communist Party of China and Chinese President, attended the opening ceremony. Hu and 6 other people officiated the ribbon-cutting ceremony of the Port. The Port connects to Hong Kong via Shenzhen Bay Bridge. Once landed on the land area of Hong Kong at Ngau Hom Shek, the cross-border traffic would use Kong Sham Western Highway and then the existing road networks to go to their destinations in Hong Kong. Shenzhen Bay Control Point, inside Hong Kong Port Area, is the first boundary control point with the immigration facilities of the Hong Kong side co-located in the same passenger terminal building with the mainland side.

It is most often used in the context of a trunked radio system, where the control channel sends various data which coordinates users in talkgroups. In GSM networks, Control Channels are divided into three categories: Broadcast Channel (BCH), Common Control Channel (CCCH), and Dedicated Control Channel (DCCH).  Broadcast Channel (BCH)  The group of Broadcast Channel is subdivided into three channels: # Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH) # Frequency Correction Channel (FCCH) # Synchronization Channel (SCH) The BCCH is transmitted by the base transceiver station (BTS) at all times. The RF carrier used to transmit the BCCH is referred to as the BCCH carrier. The MS monitors the information carried on the BCCH periodically (at least every 30 secs), when it is switched on and not in a call. The BCCH Consists of: a. Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH): Carries the following information: *Location Area Identity (LAI). *List of neighboring cells that should be monitored by the MS. *List of frequencies used in the cell. *Cell identity. *Power control indicator. *DTX permitted. *Access control (i.e., emergency calls, call barring ... etc.). *CBCH description. The BCCH is transmitted at constant power at all times, and all MS that may seek to use it to measure its signal strength. ‚ÄúDummy‚Äù bursts are transmitted to ensure continuity when there is no BCCH carrier traffic. b. Frequency Correction Channel (FCCH): This is transmitted frequently on the BCCH timeslot and allows the mobile to synchronize its own frequency to that of the transmitting base site. The FCCH may only be sent during timeslot 0 on the BCCH carrier frequency and therefore it acts as a flag to the mobile to identify Timeslot 0. It has a sequence of 148 zeros transmitted by the BTS. c. Synchronization Channel (SCH) The SCH carries the information to enable the MS to synchronize to the TDMA frame structure and know the timing of the individual timeslots. The following parameters are sent: *Frame number. *Base Site Identity Code (BSIC). The MS will monitor BCCH information from surrounding cells and store the information from the best six cells. The SCH information on these cells is also stored so that the MS may quickly resynchronize when it enters a new cell. Follows the FCCH and contains BTS identification and location information. Common Control Channels The Common Control Channel (CCCH) is responsible for transferring control information between all mobiles and the BTS. This is necessary for the implementation of ‚Äúcall origination‚Äù and ‚Äúcall paging‚Äù functions. It consists of the following: a. Random Access Channel (RACH) Used by the mobile when it requires gaining access to the system. This occurs when the mobile initiates a call or responds to a page. b. Paging Channel (PCH) Used by the BTS to page MS, (paging can be performed by an IMSI, TMSI or IMEI). c. Access Grant Control Channel (AGCH) Used by the BTS to assign a dedicated control channel to a MS in response to an access message received on the Random Access Channel. The MS will move to the dedicated channel in order to proceed with either a call setup, response to a paging message, Location Area Update or Short Message Service. d. Cell Broadcast Channel (CBCH) This channel is used to transmit messages to be broadcast to all MS‚Äôs within a cell. The CBCH uses a dedicated control channel to send its messages, however it is considered a common channel because all mobiles in the cell can receive the messages. Active MS‚Äôs must frequently monitor both BCCH and CCCH. The CCCH will be transmitted on the RF carrier with the BCCH. Dedicated Control Channels The DCCH is a single timeslot on an RF carrier that is used to convey eight Stand-alone Dedicated Control Channels (SDCCH). A single MS for call setup, authentication, location updating and SMS point to point use a SDCCH. As we will see later, SDCCH can also be found on a BCCH/CCCH timeslot, this configuration only allows four SDCCHs. a. Slow Associated Control Channel (SACCH) Conveys power control and timing information in the downlink direction (towards the MS) and Receive Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), and link quality reports in the uplink direction. b. Fast Associated Control Channel (FACCH) The FACCH is transmitted instead of a TCH. The FACCH ‚Äò‚Äòsteals‚Äù the TCH burst and inserts its own information. The FACCH is used to carry out user authentication, handovers, and immediate assignment. c. Stand-alone Dedicated channel (SDCCH) All of the control channels are required for system operation, however, in the same way that we allow different users to share the radio channel by using different timeslots to carry the conversation data, the control channels share time slots on the radio channel at different times. This allows efficient passing of control information without wasting capacity that could be used for call traffic. To do this we must organize the times lots between those, which will be used for traffic, and those, which will carry control signaling. DCCH is control channel. Channel Combination The different logical channel types mentioned are grouped into what are called channel combination. The four most common channel combination are listed below: 1\\\\. Full Rate Traffic Channel Combination ‚Äì TCH8/FACCH + SACCH 2\\\\. Broadcast Channel Combination ‚Äì BCCH + CCCH 3\\\\. Dedicated Channel Combination ‚Äì SDCCH8 + SACCH8 4\\\\.

There is a border crossing into the Italian town of Gorizia. The crossing is known as San Pietro di Gorizia in Italian. Through most of its history, it was linked to the town of Gorizia (), which is now in Italy, whence also its name, literally meaning 'St. Peter near Gorizia'. Since 1947, it has been gravitating towards the newly established town of Nova Gorica, with which it forms a continuous conurbation.  History  In the Middle Ages, it was part of the Patriarchate of Aquileia and then of the County of Gorizia. In 1500, it came under Habsburg rule, and remained part of the Habsburg Monarchy until 1918, excluding a short French interim between 1809 and 1813. During the Austrian administration in the 19th and early 20th centuries, it formed an independent municipality. According to the last Austrian census of 1910, more than 97% of its inhabitants were ethnic Slovenes.http://www.sistory.si/publikacije/prenos/?urn=SISTORY:ID:836 During World War I, it was almost completely destroyed during the Battles of the Isonzo. In August 1916, it was seized by the Italian Army, but it was recaptured by the Austro-Hungarians in November 1917. After the war, it was again occupied and later annexed by Italy. In the 1920s, it was rebuilt according to the plans of the architect Max Fabiani. In 1924 and 1947, it was an integral part of the Municipality of Gorizia, and effectively became a suburb of Gorizia. During World War II, it became an important center of Yugoslav partisan resistance. In May 1945, it was liberated by the Yugoslav Partisans. From June 1945 to September 1947 it was under Anglo-American military administration, before being annexed to Yugoslavia in 1947. In the 1950s and 1960s, when the town of Nova Gorica was still largely under construction, several important institutions were headquartered in ≈†empeter, including the Nova Gorica Grammar School and the Gorica Football Club. Since the 1970s, the regional Franc Derganc General Hospital of Nova Gorica with a maternity ward has been located in ≈†empeter.

As with most X-linked disorders, males are more heavily affected than females. Females with one affected X chromosome and one normal X chromosome tend to have milder symptoms. Unlike many other types of intellectual disability, the genetics of these conditions are relatively well understood. It has been estimated there are ~200 genes involved in this syndrome; of these ~100 have been identified. Many of these genes are found on the short 'p' arm of the chromosome, and duplications at Xp11.2 are associated with the syndromic form of the condition. X-linked intellectual disability accounts for ~16% of all cases of intellectual disability in males. Syndromes Several X-linked syndromes include intellectual disability as part of the presentation. These include: *Coffin‚ÄìLowry syndrome *MASA syndrome *MECP2 duplication syndrome *X-linked alpha thalassemia mental retardation syndrome *mental retardation and microcephaly with pontine and cerebellar hypoplasia List of genes Following is a list of genes located on the X chromosome and linked to intellectual disability. There are also several loci that have not been associated with a specific gene. * IQSEC2: encodes an exchange factor for the Arf family of small GTP binding proteins, involved in the formation of secretory vesicles. * TM4SF2: is a member of the 4 transmembrane domains family of proteins (tetraspanins, see TSPAN7). This gene is also associated with neuropsychiatric diseases such as Huntington's chorea. *AP1S2: AP-1 complex subunit sigma-2. Adaptor protein complex 1 is found on the cytoplasmic face of vesicles located at the Golgi complex, where it mediates both the recruitment of clathrin to the membrane and the recognition of sorting signals within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane receptors. * ACSL4: Long-chain- fatty-acid‚ÄîCoA ligase 4 is an enzyme of the long-chain fatty-acid-coenzyme A ligase family. It converts free long-chain fatty acids into fatty acyl-CoA esters, and thereby play a key role in lipid biosynthesis and fatty acid degradation. This isozyme preferentially utilizes arachidonate as substrate. * ZNF41: Zinc finger protein 41 is a likely zinc finger family transcription factor. * DLG3: Disks large homolog 3, also named neuroendocrine-DLG or synapse-associated protein 102 (SAP-102). DLG3 is a member of the membrane- associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) superfamily. * FTSJ1: Transfert RNA methyltransferase 1 is a member of the S-adenosylmethionine-binding protein family. This nucleolar protein is involved in the processing and modification of tRNA. * GDI1: RabGDI alpha makes a complex with geranylgeranylated small GTP-binding proteins of the Rab family and keeps them in the cytosol. * MECP2: methyl CpG binding protein 2 is a transcription regulator, which represses transcription from methylated gene promoters. It appears to be essential for the normal function of nerve cells. In contrast to other MBD family members, MECP2 is X-linked and subject to X inactivation. MECP2 gene mutations are the cause of most cases of Rett syndrome, a progressive neurologic developmental disorder and one of the most common causes of intellectual disability in women. * ARX: Aristaless related homeobox, is a protein associated with intellectual disability and lissencephaly. This gene is a homeobox-containing gene expressed during development. The expressed protein contains two conserved domains, a C-peptide (or aristaless domain) and the prd-like class homeobox domain. It is a member of the group-II aristaless-related protein family whose members are expressed primarily in the central and/or peripheral nervous system. This gene is involved in CNS and pancreas development. Mutations in this gene cause X-linked intellectual disability and epilepsy. * JARID1C: Lysine-specific demethylase 5C is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the KDM5C gene a member of the SMCY homolog family and encodes a protein with one ARID domain, one JmjC domain, one JmjN domain and two PHD-type zinc fingers. The DNA-binding motifs suggest this protein is involved in the regulation of transcription and chromatin remodeling. * PHF8: PHD finger protein 8 belongs to the family of ferrous iron and 2-oxoglutarate dependent oxygenases, and is a histone lysine demethylase with selectivity for the di- and monomethyl states. * FMR2: Fragile mental retardation 2 (FMR2: synonym AFF2), the protein belongs to the AFF family which currently has four members: AFF1/AF4, AFF2/FMR2, AFF3/LAF4 and AFF4/AF5q31. All AFF proteins are localized in the nucleus and have a role as transcriptional activators with a positive action on RNA elongation. AFF2/FMR2, AFF3/LAF4 and AFF4/AF5q31 localize in nuclear speckles (subnuclear structures considered to be storage/modification sites of pre-mRNA splicing factors) and are able to bind RNA with a high apparent affinity for the G-quadruplex structure. They appear to modulate alternative splicing via the interaction with the G-quadruplex RNA-forming structure. *Slc6a8: Creatine transporter is a protein that is required for creatine to enter the cell. Creatine is essential for maintaining ATP levels in cells with a high energy demand. * GSPT2 * MAGED1  See also  *Xp11.2 Duplication References  External links  Category:Intellectual disability Category:X-linked recessive disorders ","title":"X-linked intellectual disability"},{"id":"20068013","text":"Vantage Airport Group (or Vantage, formerly Vancouver Airport Services or YVRAS) is an airport management, development and investment company with 10 airports worldwide.

Distribution Presence extends through the Palearctic realm - (Europe, (central Scandinavia to the Alps), Russia, Russian Far East, Siberia, Amur, and Baikal to Japan and the Kuril Islands. In the Pyrenees and the Alps, E. tripunctaria occurs up to a height of 1800 m. asl. Another distribution area is located in North America, from Newfoundland to British Columbia and the San Bernardino Mountains in Southern California. The species prefers lowland forests, forest edges and damp meadows. Morphology The wingspan is 17‚Äì21 mm. The ground colour of the wings varies from ash grey to dark ashy brown to blackish, with the hind wings often averaging slightly paler. A pale waved line follows the margin of both wings with certain parts broken off into specific white marks which are more pronounced. These white marks give the species its name, and while they can show on both wings they are commonly absent from the hindwings. Though it is a good feature to identify this species, care should still be taken to separate it from other related species. Similar to other pug moths, a black discal spot is present on the center of the forewings, though it is often hard to see. The melanistic form f. angelicata occasionally appear in some populations.

It was the site of the Battle of Sablettes, a 1759 battle of the Seven Years' War. Course In mid-May 1759, Edward Boscawen found Brodrick off Toulon and took over his command of the British forces, blockading Toulon and Marseille and ensuring the safety of Gibraltar. Along with continuing the blockade with his 13 ships of the line and two 50-gun ships, Boscawen placed his 12 cruisers at strategic points and on convoy escort duty. Three months later, the French forces had retired into the inner roadstead, covered by the guns of Toulon's fortress, but still thought that such a large British force could not be solely meant for a blockade and must mean a landing was imminent - aware of this by captured letters, Boscawen encouraged this impression by threatening attacks on various points. On 7 June, two French frigates attempting to breach the blockade from outside were forced to anchor in the Anse de Sablettes. Despite the nine French batteries covering the bay, Boscawen sent in , and to sink the frigates.

Historically, relations have generally been friendly, characterised by understanding and cooperation on an international front. History =Origin: The Age of Discovery= During the 16th century Renaissance and the Age of Discovery period in the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, a small number of Poland's nobility, statesmen, merchants and writers visited India and fostered the abiding interest of the Polish people in the civilization, philosophy, spiritual traditions, art and culture of India. One of the first diplomatic dignitaries and travellers during this period to make Polish contact with India‚Äîthen under the rule of the Mughal Empire, was the Polish nobleman and statesman who was a long serving royal courtier to King Sigismund III Vasa and from the distinguished senior Silesian noble house of Saszowski family. Others from this period include a Polish diplomatic representative for King Sigismund II Augustus in the Ottoman Empire in 1538 and royal castellan of Brze≈õƒá Kujawski and Gniezno, and a Polish seafarer and diarist who provided a description of India preserved in Polish language, recorded in a letter dated 1569 to an unknown person; Pawlowski who came to India in 1569, left a rudimentary description of the sea route from Gda≈Ñsk via Portugal (Lisbon) to India (Goa) in the form of a comprehensive letter-relation to a friend in Krak√≥w, in which described the customs of 'dark' people. A consequence of these voyages soon provided Indian echoes in Polish literature. As early as 1611, the Polish Catholic priest, translator and poet, Stanislaw Grochowski (1542-1612), published a book titled Cudowne wiersze z indyjskiego jezyka (Wonderful Verses from the Indian Language). It was a translation of the Bhagavad Gita, which had first been translated from Sanskrit into Medieval Latin by the Italian poet and Jesuit missionary Francisco Benci (1542-1594), who had stayed in India and later lectured at the Jesuit college in Pu≈Çtusk, Poland. Where Stanislaw Grochowski was a professor. =19th century= During the 19th century, several Sanskrit classics were translated into Polish and a 'History of Ancient India' in Polish was one of the first of its kind to be published in Europe. A Chair of Sanskrit was set up at the Jagiellonian University of Krak√≥w in 1893. Studies and research in Indian languages and literature had developed at the Universities of Krak√≥w, Warsaw, Wroc≈Çaw and Pozna≈Ñ. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Maharaja of Jodhpur, commissioned the accomplished Polish visual artist , to decorate the Umaid Bhawan Palace with a series of paintings, where his works were rediscovered in the 1990s. Whilst staying in India during World War II, Norblin also painted portraits of the local aristocracy and decorated their residences. =World War II= Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru were known to be vocal supporters of Poland's struggle against the Invasion of Poland by Germany, the Soviet Union, the Free City of Danzig, and a small Slovak contingent that marked the beginning of World War II. Both Indian intelligentsia and Indian military officials were vocal supporters of Polish autonomy and freedom when Germany and the Soviet Union occupied Poland in September 1939. Many Polish citizens were given refuge in India by Indian maharajas. Former President of India, Pratibha Devisingh Patil and former President of Poland, Lech Kaczy≈Ñski, delivering a press statement after the signing of a memorandum of understanding between India & Poland at the Presidential Palace in Warsaw, April 2009. Polish refugees in India Monument at the 'Square of the Good Maharaja' (Skwer Dobrego Maharad≈ºy) in Warsaw During the Second World War Occupation of Poland by the Soviet Union in the east and the German Reich in the west, the Maharaja Jam Sahib of Nawanagar State, Digvijaysinhji Ranjitsinhji Jadeja of Nawanagar, extended hospitality and sanctuary to more than 640 Polish displaced persons, the majority were orphaned children and women, out of some 5000 refugees sent to India from Soviet deportation, and despite India itself suffering from a severe backdrop of drought and famine at that time. After their ship and plight was turned away by every country approached and when the British Crown governor in Mumbai (Bombay) too refused them entry, the Maharaja Jam Sahib, frustrated by the lack of empathy and unwillingness of the British government to act, ordered the ship to dock at Rozi port in his province. The displaced persons, lived in camps in several places in western India, including Balachadi (near Jamnagar), Valivade (near Kolhapur) and Panchgani. Digvijaysinhji Ranjitsinhji's unparalleled act of generosity, saw him become patron of the first public school complex founded in Poland after the Second World War, located in the capital of Warsaw, and named Jam Saheba Digvijay Sinhji in his honour. In 2012, the Sejm of the Republic of Poland, honoured the 50th anniversary of his death, posthumously awarding the Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland, and the Warsaw City Council named one of its city park squares in Ochota district after him - the 'Square of the Good Maharaja' (Skwer Dobrego Maharad≈ºy). =Cold War= During the post-War period, when Poland became the Polish People's Republic under the Soviet Occupation Forces and Soviet-backed communist regime, Poland, then a state in the Eastern Bloc, was not a free agent to choose its destiny. This relaxed after the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953. The international situation became less tense, and the new Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev took a liking to India's prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru. In 1954, Poland and India formally agreed to establish resident diplomatic missions, and the Indian Embassy in Warsaw was opened in 1957, shortly after the 1956 Polish October revolution that marked a change in the politics of Poland. During the Cold War period, both Warsaw and New Delhi had close ties with the Soviet Union and this made them natural friends. On 25 January 1977 an agreement on the operation of air services between the two countries was signed in New Delhi. =Post Cold War= Former Prime Minister of Poland Donald Tusk (left) and former Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh (right) meet in New Delhi, September 2010. After the Collapse of Soviet Union, both countries focused on improving ties with the European Community and the United States. Even after the events of 1989, when Poland transitioned to the modern democratic Republic of Poland, relations with India have maintained continuity and have remained on an even keel reflecting relations with India were not an adjunct of the Cold War and are based on sound principles. Contacts between the Indian and Polish Parliaments were established after the fall of the Communism in 1989. A Polish parliamentary delegation led by the Marshal of the Sejm, had visited India in December 1992. A Polish-Indian Parliamentary Group had been set up during the term of the last Parliament which held office from 1996-2001. Speaker of Lok Sabha, Manohar Joshi led a multi-party Parliamentary delegation to Poland from 22-26 May 2002. Also, the Speaker of the Sejm of the Republic of Poland, Jozef Oleksy, led a Polish parliamentary delegation to India from 9-11 December 2004. In April 2009, Indian President Pratibha Devisingh Patil visited Poland. In September 2010, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk visited India and met with Indian politicians and businessmen.

Bilateral trade, which totaled US$675.73 million (approximately 3,825 crores) and US$861.78 million (approximately 4,873 crores) in 2006 and 2007 respectively, crossed US$1 billion (approximately 5,700 crores) in 2008 with US$1274.77 million (approximately 7,000 crores). During 2005, major Indian companies signed several agreements on investments that are expected to create more than 3,500 new jobs in Poland. India's major exports to Poland include Tea, Coffee, Spices, Textiles, Pharmaceuticals, machinery and instruments, auto parts and surgical items. India's imports from Poland include machinery except electric and electronic appliances, artificial resins, plastic material, non-ferrous metals and machine tools. Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has sent several delegations to Poland to explore economic opportunities in various sectors. Indian companies such as Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro Technologies, ZenSar and Videocon have already set up their bases in Poland. The 'Indo-Polish Chamber of Commerce and Industry' (IPCCI) was formed in 2008 to protect and represent the interests within the range of economic activity and to promote economic relations between India and Poland. Direct nonstop flights provided by LOT Polish Airlines between Warsaw Chopin Airport and Indira Gandhi International Airport started September 12, 2019. Both countries have a long- standing history of cooperation in science and technology. The first Indo- Polish Agreement on this cooperation was signed in March 1974; subsequently, a new agreement with more focus Programmes of Cooperation (POC) in science and technology were signed between the two countries from time to time. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and the Indian National Science Academy (INSA) have ongoing scientific exchange programs with the Polish Academy of Sciences (PAS). =Defence ties= India's defence relations with Poland have grown from military cooperation to comprehensive defence cooperation that includes courses, training for UN peacekeeping operations, and exchange of observers during army exercises. India and Poland signed the Memorandum of Understanding on Defence Cooperation in February 2003 during the visit of the Prime Minister of Poland Leszek Miller to India. India awarded contracts worth US $600 million (3.5 thousand-crores) to Poland for modernisation of tanks and the acquisition of air defence missiles. The T-72M1 with 800 horsepower engines were upgraded with 1000 hp engines and re-equipped with modern fire control systems () and thermal imaging equipment. Both India and Poland are considering privatising their defence industries and see good prospects for mutual investments. Indian Army chief General Deepak Kapoor visited Warsaw in March 2008 followed by Poland's Deputy Foreign Minister Ryszard Schnepf in June the same year. India also acquired 625 assault parachutes from the Polish company Air-Pol with automatic devices ensuring their reliable opening, with a total value of US $1.5 million. India's growing defence buy-outs from Poland has disappointed Russia which had considered India a safe market for its military hardware. Poland also delivered a batch of 80 WZT-3 armoured recovery vehicles (ARVs) to the Indian Army in 2001 at the Kolar Gold Fields facility in Karnataka and the remaining batch in 2004. The final batch of 40 WZT-3 ARVs were assembled in India from kits supplied from Poland.

Danon disease is an X-linked lysosomal and glycogen storage disorder associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, skeletal muscle weakness, and intellectual disability. Symptoms and signs Males In males the symptoms of Danon Disease are more severe. Features of Danon Disease in males are: * An early age of onset of muscle weakness and heart disease (onset in childhood or adolescence) * Some learning problems or intellectual disability can be present * Muscle weakness can be severe and can affect endurance and the ability to walk * Heart disease (cardiomyopathy) can be severe and can lead to a need for medications. It usually progress to heart failure, commonly complicated by atrial fibrillation and embolic strokes with severe neurological disability,Spinazzi M, Fanin M, Melacini P, Nascimbeni AC, Angelini C. Cardioembolic stroke in Danon disease. Clin Genet. 2008;73:388-90. leading to death unless heart transplant is performed. * Cardiac conduction abnormalities can occur. Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is a common conduction pattern in Danon disease. * Symptoms are usually gradually progressive * Some individuals may have visual disturbances, and/or retinal pigment abnormalities * Danon Disease is rare and unfamiliar to most physicians. It can be mistaken for other forms of heart disease and/or muscular dystrophies, including Pompe disease. Females In females the symptoms of Danon Disease are less severe. Common symptoms of Danon Disease in females are: * A later age of onset of symptoms. Many females will not have obvious symptoms until late adolescence or even adulthood. * Learning problems and intellectual disability are usually absent. * Muscle weakness is often absent or subtle. Some females will tire easily with exercise * Cardiomyopathy is often absent in childhood. Some women will develop this in adulthood. Cardiomyopathy can be associated with atrial fibrillation and embolic strokes. * Cardiac conduction abnormalities can occur. Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is a common conduction pattern in Danon disease. * Symptoms in females progress more slowly than in males. * Some females may have visual disturbances, and/or retinal pigment abnormalities * Danon Disease is rare and unfamiliar to most physicians. The milder and more subtle symptoms in females can make it more difficult to diagnose females with Danon Disease  Causes  Although the genetic cause of Danon Disease is known, the mechanism of disease is not well understood. Danon disease involves a genetic defect (mutation) in a gene called LAMP2, which results in a change to the normal protein structure. While the function of the LAMP2 gene is not well understood, it is known that LAMP2 protein is primarily located in small structures within cells called lysosomes. Genetics It is associated with LAMP2. The status of this condition as a GSD has been disputed. Diagnosis Making a diagnosis for a genetic or rare disease can often be challenging. Healthcare professionals typically look at a person‚Äôs medical history, symptoms, physical exam, and laboratory test results in order to make a diagnosis. The following resources provide information relating to diagnosis and testing for this condition. If you have questions about getting a diagnosis, you should contact a healthcare professional. Testing Resources The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for this condition. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. Orphanet lists international laboratories offering diagnostic testing for this condition. Treatment RP-A501 is an AAV-based gene therapy aimed to restore the LAMP-2 gene which is defective in male patients afflicted with Danon Disease and how to cure it.https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03882437. Cardiac transplantation has been performed as a treatment, however most patients die early in life. History Danon disease was characterized by Moris Danon in 1981. Dr. Danon first described the disease in 2 boys with heart and skeletal muscle disease (muscle weakness), and intellectual disability. The first case of Danon disease reported in the Middle East was a family diagnosed in the eastern region of United Arab Emirates with a new LAMP2 mutation; discovered by the Egyptian cardiologist Dr. Mahmoud Ramadan the associate professor of Cardiology in Mansoura University (Egypt) after doing genetic analysis for all the family members in Bergamo, Italy where 6 males were diagnosed as Danon disease patients and 5 female were diagnosed as carriers; as published in Al-Bayan newspaper in 20 February 2016 making this family the largest one with patients and carriers of Danon disease. Danon Disease has overlapping symptoms with another rare genetic condition called 'Pompe' disease. Microscopically, muscles from Danon Disease patients appear similar to muscles from Pompe disease patients. However, intellectual disability is rarely, if ever, a symptom of Pompe disease. Negative enzymatic or molecular genetic testing for Pompe disease can help rule out this disorder as a differential diagnosis.

His many screen appearances included character parts in three Polanski films. Private life Richard Pearson was born and brought up in Monmouth.Monmouth and Monmouthshire were not definitively incorporated into Wales until 1974. Retrieved 21 April 2014. He was educated at Aymestrey Court,Former school: Retrieved 31 August 2018. Worcester, and at Monmouth School, where his father, Cyril Pearson (1888‚Äì1946), taught French. Richard Pearson's early stage career was interrupted by military service in the Second World War with the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division. He was mentioned in dispatches and left the army with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. He married the actress Patricia Dickson (1927‚Äì2014) in 1949. They lived until the late 1950s in Nassau Street, in the Fitzrovia district of London, then in Beckenham, and latterly in Richmond upon Thames. They had two sons, Simon and Patrick; Patrick is also an actor. In the later years of his life, Pearson was suffering from myocardial degeneration. He died on 2 August 2011, the morning after his 93rd birthday. Film and television Notable films of his career included Brian Desmond Hurst's Scrooge (1951) as well as a brief appearance in John Schlesinger's Sunday Bloody Sunday (1971) and cameo roles in three films by Roman Polanski: Macbeth (1971), Tess (1979) and Pirates (1986). Pearson did not make his film d√©but until the age of 32, when he played a sergeant in the motion picture The Girl is Mine (1950). This was followed a year later by his performance as Mr Tupper in Scrooge. In later years, Pearson is perhaps best known for his role as Mole in Cosgrove Hall's The Wind in the Willows (1983), its subsequent television series, which led on from the original film, and its spin-off programme Oh, Mr. Toad, in all of which he starred alongside David Jason, Peter Sallis and Michael Hordern.Vahimagi, Tise (1994).

Two RUC officers were shot dead and the base was raked with gunfire before being completely destroyed by a bomb, which wounded a further three officers. Background In 1985, Patrick Kelly became leader of the Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade. He, along with East Tyrone Brigade members Jim Lynagh and P√°draig McKearney, advocated using flying columns to destroy isolated British Army and RUC bases and stop them from being repaired. The goal was to create and hold \\"liberated zones\\" under IRA control that would be gradually enlarged. Although IRA Chief of Staff Kevin McKenna turned-down the flying column idea, IRA Northern Command approved the plan to destroy bases and prevent their repair. In that year alone there were 44 such attacks.An Phoblacht, 28 July 2005 Among the most devastating was the mortar attack on Newry RUC barracks in March. The attack The attack involved two IRA active service units from the East Tyrone Brigade: an armed assault unit and a bomb unit. There were also several teams of IRA observers in the area. The assault team was armed with AK-47 and AR-15 rifles, while the bombing unit was to be responsible for planting and detonating a bomb.SAS operations in Northern Ireland Both units were commanded by Patrick Kelly. The assault was launched on Saturday 7 December at 18:55,Excerpt from \\"Sons of Guns\\", chapter 11 of Families at War by Peter Taylor (1989).

Another three RUC officers who were inside ran out to the back of the base, where they hoped the walls might offer some cover. IRA members went into the building and took documents and weapons. The bomb was placed inside and, upon detonation, destroyed the entire base. Three officers were hurt. The republican magazine Iris (#11, October 1987) described the attack as follows: > One volunteer took up a position close to the front gate. Two RUC men opened > the gate and the volunteer calmly stepped forward, shooting them both dead > at point blank range. Volunteers firing AK-47 and Armalite rifles moved into > the barracks, raking it with gunfire. Having secured the building they > planted a 100 lb bomb inside.

The day is named for the king and is a general flag day in Sweden and in Finland. The day was formerly celebrated with torchlight processions and patriotic speeches. Today what remains is mainly the consumption of the Gustavus Adolphus pastry (Gustav Adolfsbakelse in Swedish) on this day, with a chocolate or marzipan relief of that king on top.

In order to improve local passenger services the kkStB procured 2-6-2 tank locomotives that were to replace the existing four-coupled tender locomotives in this role. One advantage of tank locomotives was that they did not need to be turned at the end of the route. In their design Karl G√∂lsdorf laid particular emphasis on good acceleration. The 17 engines of this class, designated as the kkStB 129 were delivered by the Lokomotivfabrik Floridsdorf and Wiener Neust√§dter Lokomotivfabrik. Because these Class 129 locomotives proved a total success, the Austrian Southern Railway or S√ºdbahn wanted to procured similar engines, albeit with greater water and coal capacity. As a result, G√∂lsdorf modified the design by adding a trailing axle. From 1903 to 1907 Floridsdorf supplied eleven units of this newly designated Class 229 to the Southern Railway, and from 1904 to 1918 the kkStB placed orders for a total of 239 units with all the Austrian locomotive factories. The Class 129 engines were rebuilt to 2-6-2s and placed into a new Class 229.4. In 1913 the B√∂hmisch-M√§hrische Maschinenfabrik delivered four 229s to the Serbian State Railway and the Wiener Neust√§dter Lokomotivfabrik built 10 units in 1909 and 1920 for the Aspangbahn (EWA, Eisenbahn Wien-Aspang), that were designated as the EWA IIIa Nos. 41‚Äì50. After World War I 69 engines were left with the Austrian Federal Railways (then the BB√ñ), to which were added the eleven engines of the S√ºdbahn, grouped into Class 229.5, and ten machines of the EWA, grouped into Class 229.8, when these companies were nationalised. Other nations also ordered these locomotives giving them their own classifications. The Polish State Railways took delivery of 22 locomotives as PKP Class OKl12, the Yugoslavian Railways acquired 25 as JD≈Ω Class 116 and the Italian State Railways (FS) procured five as FS Class 912\\\\. But the bulk of the engines (145 units) went in 1918 to the Czechoslovak State Railways, who designated them as ƒåSD Class 354.0. As southern Slovakia was ceded in 1939 to Hungary, 15 units also went to the Hungarian State Railways () as the M√ÅV Class 343.3. From 1926 to 1934 the ƒåSD rebuilt five of its 354.0 into superheated two-cylinder locomotives which they designated as the ƒåSD Class 355.0. These machines were also given a second steam dome and a connecting pipe between the domes. Between 1936 and 1940, the trailing axle on another five engines was replaced by a bogie; these locomotives then became the ƒåSD Class 353.1. In 1944 another engine was converted to superheating, but the second steam dome was not used. After the Anschluss of Austria to the German Empire in 1938 the ninety 229s were classified by the Deutsche Reichsbahn as DR Class 75.701‚Äì790. During the course of the war, the ƒåSD Class 355.0 was incorporated as DR Class 75.901‚Äì905 into the DRB; likewise 21 PKP Class Okl12 locomotives as DR Class 75.851‚Äì871 and nine JD≈Ω Class 116s as DR Class 75.791‚Äì799. After 1945, some 63 engines were grouped by the √ñBB into their √ñBB Class 75\\\\. The last of these machines were retired in 1962.

This Atlantic hurricane season saw a near-record number of named tropical storms. This extremely active season followed four consecutive years in which there was below normal activity. The season officially began on June 1, 1995 and ended on November 30, 1995. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most tropical systems form. The season's first system, Hurricane Allison, developed on June 3; its last, Hurricane Tanya, became extratropical on November 2\\\\. The season produced 21 tropical cyclones, of which 19 intensified into tropical storms, 11 of which became hurricanes, and five became major hurricanes. The four most notable storms during the season were hurricanes Luis, Marilyn, Opal and Roxanne. Luis caused extensive damage in the northern Leeward Islands in excess of $2.5 billion (1995 USD). Marilyn affected the same area a few days later, causing eight deaths and damages in excess of $2 billion in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Opal was a strong hurricane that, after battering the Yucat√°n Peninsula of Mexico, cross the Gulf of Mexico and made landfall near Pensacola Beach, Florida. There were 27 hurricane-related deaths were reported in the Southeastern United States. Roxanne caused widespread flooding and crop damage throughout much of the Yucat√°n Peninsula, and killed at least six people, due to its erratic movement. Following the 1995 season, these four storm names were retired from reuse in the North Atlantic by the World Meteorological Organization. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. It includes information that was not released throughout the season, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not initially warned upon, has been included. By convention, meteorologists use one time zone when issuing forecasts and making observations: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and also use the 24-hour clock (where 00:00 = midnight UTC). In this time line, all information is listed by UTC first with the respective local time included in parentheses.

This home is the only home on Long Island designed by Frank Lloyd Wright at the request of Benjamin and Anne Rebhuhn, publishers of progressive content. This house is similar to the Ernest Vosburgh House in Grand Beach, Michigan, except that this house is in the Usonian style while the Vosburgh residence, built 21 years earlier, was in the Prairie style. The house follows a cruciform plan. The house features a two-story living room and is built from tidewater red cypress board and batten inside and out, with brick and red roof tile. Notable owners of the house have included Texas oil heiress Diane Reid. References * Storrer, William Allin. The Frank Lloyd Wright Companion.
