She is part of a group of African-American avant- garde artists working in New York and Los Angeles from the 1960s onward. Early life and education Nengudi was born as Sue Irons in Chicago in 1943, and following the death of her father in 1949, moved to Los Angeles and Pasadena with her mother. As a result of an existing segregated school system, Nengudi found herself in between schools, transferring back and forth between Los Angeles and Pasadena. Her cousin Eileen Abdul-Rashid is also an artist. Following her graduation from Dorsey High School, Nengudi studied art and dance during the 1960s at California State University, Los Angeles, graduating with a BA in 1967. She then spent a year studying at Waseda University, Tokyo, in the hopes of learning more about the Gutai collective. In 1967, she returned to California State University, from which she received her MA in sculpture in 1971. During college, in 1965, she interned at the Watts Towers Art Center when Noah Purifoy was the director. She also worked as an art instructor at the Pasadena Art Museum and the Fine Arts Community Workshop. She moved to New York City shortly thereafter to continue her career as an artist, and she traveling back and forth between New York City and Los Angeles frequently. She lives and works in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Work Nengudi was part of the radical, avant-garde black art scenes in both New York City and Los Angeles during the 1960s and 1970s. She was a member of the Studio Z collective, also known as the LA Rebellion, that comprised African American artists \\"distinguished by their experimental and improvisational practice\\" David Hammons and Maren Hassinger, also members of Studio Z, were frequent collaborators with her work. She worked with two galleries in particular: Pearl C. Woods Gallery in Los Angeles (owned and directed by Greg Pitts) and Just Above Midtown in New York. Just Above Midtown (JAM) was owned and directed by Linda Goode Bryant who influenced Nengudi. She has described the creative energies of working with galleries like these two that were \\"trying to break down the walls\\" for the black artist community.  \\"R√©pondez s'il vous plait\\" (\\"R.S.V.P.\\"), 1975‚Äì77  In 1975, following the birth of her son and seeing the changes in her body, Nengudi began her \\"r√©pondez s'il vous plait\\" (RSVP) series for which she is best known. Combining her interest in movement and sculpture, Nengudi created abstract sculptures of everyday objects through choreographed sets which were either performed in front of a live audience or captured on camera. The sculptures were made from everyday objects, like pantyhose, and parts were stretched, twisted, knotted, and filled with sand. The finished sculptures, originally intended to be able to be touched by the audience, were often hung on gallery walls but stretched across gallery space, evoking the forms of bodily organs, sagging breasts, and a mother's womb. For her, the use of pantyhose as a material reflected the elasticity of the human body, especially the female body. These sculptures as well as her later performance pieces involving pantyhose expressed a m√©lange of sensuality, race identify, body image, and societal impacts on women's bodies. Despite being increasingly involved within the African American artist community in Los Angeles, when the \\"R.S.V.P\\" series made its debut, there was no significant interest from the public in her work. One of Nengudi's close friends, David Hammons, consistently collaborated with Nengudi on multiple artistic pieces. He brought forth an explanation for the public's lack of interest in Nengudi's work, ascribing it to the abstract aesthetic present in a lot of Nengudi's pieces throughout the 1960s and the 1970s. Furthermore, Nengudi's \\"R.S.V.P\\" sculptures differed greatly from most of the art work made popular by her artistic peers in Los Angeles, as well as New York. Nengudi was made aware of the perception of her art by the public in relation to artwork made by her peers, a concept solidified in New York, where some people felt as though she was not making \\"black art\\". Nengudi's \\"R.S.V.P.\\" sculptures have made more recent appearances in traveling group shows, including \\"Now Dig This! Art & Black Los Angeles 1960‚Äì1980\\" (2011‚Äì2013) and \\"Blues for Smoke\\" (2013).  Performances  In 1978, Nengudi paired with Hassinger for a performance piece in which the two artists improvised movement while entangled inside a large web of pantyhose. The performance symbolized the ways in which women are restricted by societal gender norms. Nengudi also took many staged photographs during this period. She often appeared anonymously in them herself as a genderless figure, defying definition. The same year, Nengudi and members of the Studio Z collective (including Hammons and Hassinger) performed Ceremony for Freeway Fets under a freeway overpass on Pico Boulevard in Los Angeles. Nengudi designed costumes and headdresses made of pantyhose for the performers. Hammons and Hassinger played the roles of male and female spirits, with Nengudi performing as a spirit to unite the genders. Both the dance performance and soundtrack, performed by members of Studio Z, were improvised. In 2007, she created a video installation entitled \\"Warp Trance\\", and her residency at the Fabric Workshop and Museum in Philadelphia articulated the experiences of textile workers. In March 2017, Nengudi participated at the Armory Show in New York City in the Focus Section. The booth was presented by Thomas Erben Gallery and L√©vy Gorvy. Nengudi also participated in the 2017 Venice Biennale, Viva Arte Viva, May 13 ‚Äì November 16, 2017.  \\"Warp Trance\\"  During her 2007 residency at the Fabric Workshop and Museum in Philadelphia, PA, Nengudi incorporated video art into her practice for the first time. During visits to textile mills around the state, she recorded video and audio footage of the textile mills in full operation, and she also collected objects, like Jacquard punch cards, which were used to program Jacquard loom machines, mechanizing textile mills. In the final installation, Nengudi projected video footage onto a vertical screen of punch cards in a space with ambient sound from the audio recordings. The work explores themes of technology, the politics of labor, contemporary music, and the repetition of ritual dance.  Exhibitions and museum collections  Nengudi's work can be found in the museum collections of the Museum of Modern Art, NY, The Hammer Museum, Los Angeles, CA, Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, PA, Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, CA, Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, NY, and Brooklyn Museum, NY.

She often combines African, Asian and Native American art forms in particular for her performance pieces and staged photographs. While her oeuvre highlights issues surrounding gender, race and ethnicity, Nengudi's work focuses on the ways in which everyone is negatively affected by these systematic forces and her pieces attempt to foster cross-cultural inspiration for men and women alike. She often cites African and Eastern philosophies as underpinning her work.  Other work  In addition to her installations, sculpture, and performances, Nengudi also creates paintings, and photography and writes poetry under the pseudonyms Harriet Chin, Propecia Lee, and Lily B. Moor. In an interview, Nengudi explained how she decided to create these pseudonyms: > \\"It all started when I saw a rack of postcards with art that was incredible > and very African-looking, but then when I turned over the postcard and saw > that the artist was white, I thought, \\"What the heck?\\" Later I questioned > why I responded that way. I thought about this issue of naming, and how we > jump to conclusions based on the ethnicity of a name. Of course, if there is > no name attached, then people just have to respond to the work in itself. > But if it's work by someone named \\"Yamamoto\\" or \\"Rodriguez,\\" there's > immediately another filter that we put on to view it. The different names I > use all have a personal thread related to them. I want it to be like Br'er > Rabbit, trying to be the trickster, to play with things, and to make people > look at things differently.\\" --Senga Nengudi She has also curated exhibits, like a solo show of Kira Lynn Harris at the Cue Art Foundation in New York in the spring of 2009.

Description The soldier termites of this species have rounded heads, long straight mandibles and yellowish-brown bodies. They are between long. Distribution and habitat Nasutitermes walkeri is endemic to eastern Australia where it is found in eastern New South Wales and southeastern Queensland. It is found in mountains and near the coast, mostly in scrubland and wooded areas. Behaviour The nests of Nasutitermes walkeri are initially established in the crowns of trees at sites where there is some damage to the timber from fire or decay. A more substantial nest is later constructed higher up, sometimes as high as above the ground. The outside of the nest has a thin, papery surface and the internal structure is also fragile. The termites feed mainly at ground level and they create tubes down the trunk of the tree and then surface tubes or subterranean passages through the soil to reach damp or rotting timbers. These termites only feeds on moist timber and this may be at some distance from the nest tree. They will attack fence posts and poles but seldom damage woodwork in houses unless there is decay.

She studied at the Boston Museum School, Tufts University, and at the Yale University School of Art. During her graduate studies she experimented with heavy wire sculptures and with artificial objects rendered as natural ones, such as trees made of steel with painted-on leaves, which she ultimately placed in natural settings. Semmes is now best known for her large- scale sculpture and installations, which often explore the relationship between craft and fine art while simultaneously dealing with issues related to feminism, gender roles and womanhood. Her oversized dresses are dysfunctional in scale and composition, emphasizing the absence of the body. Semmes has stated that these pieces have a theatrical, performative quality and that she uses clothing as a means to explore its power and influence on the internal and external.MacFarland, Terence, ‚ÄúThe Big, The Bad and The Beautiful,‚Äù Interview Magazine, June 1996 p. 92 -95. Her ceramic works, often juxtaposed with her fabric installations, tend to be roughly shaped vessels in bright fluorescent shades, while her crystal works defy our expectations of the medium and serve as a metaphor for the female body. Semmes has had solo exhibitions at MoMA PS1, New York; Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; Camden Arts Centre, London; Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia; Fabric Workshop and Museum, Philadelphia; and, the Wexner Center for the Arts, Columbus. She has participated in group exhibitions at domestic and international institutions such as the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden; Carnegie Museum of Art; John Michael Kohler Arts Center; Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum; Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston; Museum of Contemporary Art, Miami; Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia; Denver Art Museum; and, the Kunsthalle Wien, Vienna. Semmes' work is in the public collections of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden; Whitney Museum of American Art; Hammer Museum;Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; Nasher Sculpture Center, Dallas; and, Denver Art Museum amongst others. The artist is represented by Susan Inglett Gallery, NYC.  Feminist Responsibility Project (FRP)  Semmes began work on her series Feminist Responsibility Project (FRP) in the early 2000s. After receiving a cache of gentleman's magazines from a neighbor, the artist has spent the last two decades censoring pages from Penthouse and Hustler magazine with ink and paint. She partially covers the models' bodies as they engaged in titillating positions and acts, turning them into boldly- colored, abstract shapes and leaving their extremities, faces, and limbs uncovered. Writing on the FRP series, critic Martha Schwendener stated, ‚ÄúWhat she leaves blank, amid these colorful, blobby abstractions, are grasping hands, supplicating eyes, or sharp stiletto heels we associate with pornographic images (and performances).‚Äù‚ÄúMartha Schwendener, ‚ÄúMuseum/Gallery Listings for Feb. 28 ‚Äì March 6: Beverly Semmes,‚Äù New York Times, 27 February 2014, p. C19. The censoring of the images serves as an effort to protect the subject and the viewer from the imagery of porn, highlighting American society‚Äôs conflicted relationship to pornography and sexual censorship. In conversation with curator Ian Berry, Semmes stated that her role as a censor of the FRP images was complicated and made her feel > \\"Shocked, amused, embarrassed. As I took out [body] parts that were more > problematic for me, I could outlines the parts that had another appeal. I > could bring it to a different place that made me more comfortable without > the aspects that I found more disturbing.\\" In 2014, the Tang Museum presented the exhibition Opener 27 Beverly Semmes: FRP, which subsequently traveled to the Weatherspoon Art Museum and the Faulconer Gallery at Grinnell College.

She is notable for taking command of a fever- ridden ship in 1870 and safely navigating it through storms from Florida to Liverpool, England. Family Elizabeth Hall, usually known as Bessie Hall, was born in Granville Beach (Lower Granville), Nova Scotia on 7 April 1849, the daughter of Captain Joseph Hall and Priscilla (Cushing) Hall.Catherine H. Campbell, \\"Bessie Hall, Master Mariner\\", The Nova Scotia Historical Review, Vol. 7, No. 2 (1987) p.8 According to an 1871 deed, Captain Hall and his wife Pricilla purchased a home in Granville Beach (Lower Granville) from the Hon. James W. Johnson. The deed states that Captain Hall had been residing there for several years, likely with his daughter Bessie. This house still exists as a private residence. The Halls were a well-known family of shipbuilders and ship captains in Annapolis County, Nova Scotia.Armstrong, Peggy and Marguerite Wagner, Age of Sail in Annapolis County 1760‚Äì1925 Midnight Press, Annapolis Royal (2000), pp. 68‚Äì69 Bessie began to go to sea when she was 17, joining her father on deep sea voyages in the family's large square rigged sailing vessels. She showed great interest in navigation. Her father taught her Celestial navigation and ship handling as she assisted him in plotting voyages. In 1883, Captain Joseph Hall sold his Granville Beach house after building a new one in Granville Ferry around 1881. This newer house still stands as a bed and breakfast, named \\"The Seafaring Maiden\\" in honor of Captain Hall's famous daughter. Notable Voyage In 1870, Bessie Hall and her father arrived in New Orleans from Liverpool aboard the 1444-ton ship Rothesay to load a cargo of cotton. The cargo was delayed for two months due to financial problems with the shipper, causing a considerable number of the crew to desert and sign on to other vessels. To make up for the long delay, Capt. Hall decided to risk sailing shorthanded. He left New Orleans on March 24, 1870, with a crew of six sailors, plus the first mate, a cook, an elderly carpenter ‚Äì and Bessie. Four days into the voyage, the First Mate fell ill with smallpox and was quarantined to his cabin. Capt. Hall kept the small pox secret to avoid panic. However on April 2, Capt. Hall also came down with smallpox, just as the ship rounded the tip of Florida and encountered mounting squalls as it entered the Gulf Stream. Capt. Hall had just enough energy to direct the crew in reducing sail to storm canvas, a minimum set of strong lower sails, before he collapsed with fever and was taken below. He told Bessie she would have to take command with the carpenter as first mate. A delegate from the crew approached Bessie and said, \\"We know about the smallpox. Can you take this ship to England?\\". \\"I can,\\" was Bessie's reply.Jennifer Bishop, \\"The Seafaring Maiden\\", The Family Herald, Nov. 7, 1957, p.14 She held a meeting in the saloon where the crew expressed their support for the 20-year-old woman and discussed alternatives. Bessie considered the options of turning back or changing course for Saint John, New Brunswick but decided to press on for Liverpool. In the days that followed, the squalls grew to a series of gales. Bessie navigated by dead reckoning and stood night watches from 8 pm to 2 am. On April 18, the skies briefly cleared and Bessie took sun sights with the sextant finding their position to be near the tip of the Grand Banks. Adjusting course for Liverpool, Bessie had to contend with light and contrary winds with a crew too small to add much canvas. However she safely brought the ship to the Irish Sea where they picked up a pilot who took the ship into Liverpool where they arrived on May 12 just as Capt. Hall and the mate began to recover. As Bessie stepped ashore in her \\"rough sailor's garb\\", she was cheered by the crew.Bishop, p. 16 The ship Rothesay had been given up for lost and grateful insurers planned a large public banquet in Bessie's honour. However, this plan was scuttled as the ship's owners, making up for delays, had rushed the ship without clearing quarantine regulations and did not want to publicize the smallpox aboard. As result, Bessie's accomplishment and skills remained only the talk of working mariners. Later life Bessie continued to sail with her father for another year, making her final voyage to the Falkland Islands when she was 21. Despite her interest in seafaring and navigation, no women were allowed to apply for mates or captains papers in the 19th century. (It was not until 1938 that Molly Kool, from Alma, New Brunswick, broke through to become the first female captain in North America.)Donal Baird, Women at Sea in the Age of Sail, Nimbus Publishing, Halifax, 2001, p. 216. Bessie left the sea and married James Reed Hall, a second cousin on March 14, 1877. They settled in Granville Beach where she raised four children. From time to time, grizzled sailors from steamships calling at nearby Annapolis Royal would make their way to Granville to meet the girl who saved her family's ship. Bessie never forgot the sea and on her 80th birthday, she amazed a visiting Royal Navy officer with her detailed knowledge of the lighthouses, headlands and shoals of the English Channel. Hall died on June 30, 1930.Bishop, p. 16 She is buried in the Stoney Beach Cemetery near her childhood home and the site of the old Hall family shipyard.

Background and overview Washington's 38th legislative district primarily covers the Snohomish County city of Everett. In 2010 the race for state senator from Washington's 38th legislative district was a three-way contest between two candidates from the Democratic party ‚Äì Everett, Washington attorney Nick Harper and incumbent legislator Jean Berkey ‚Äì and third-party challenger Rod Rieger, a relatively unknown contender who ran as a candidate from the non-existent \\"Conservative Party\\" (under Washington elections law, candidates can declare themselves a member of any party, whether it exists or not). Under Washington's nonpartisan blanket primary system, the two candidates with the highest number of total votes advance to the general election, regardless of party affiliation. This created the possibility that the two Democrats, Harper and Berkey, would face each other in the general election, where many believed Berkey would likely win. In the run-up to the primary election, a small political consulting firm ‚Äì Moxie Media ‚Äì covertly directed upwards of $300,000 in undeclared spending from Harper's supporters to a variety of shell PACs. These committees, in turn, launched a series of direct mail attacks against Berkey, who had been known as a moderate Democrat likely to be supported by the district's conservative voters, purporting to be from a variety of groups with names like \\"Cut Taxes PAC\\" and \\"Conservative PAC.\\" The mailings portrayed Berkey as a left-wing legislator and encouraged conservatives to vote for the third-party candidate, Rod Rieger. The campaign helped propel Rieger to a surprising second-place finish in the primary election, eliminating Berkey and setting up a general election contest between Harper and Rieger. In the general election Harper handily crushed Rieger, who had only raised and spent $800 relative to Harper's $55,000 campaign war chest. Reaction and aftermath Nick Harper denied knowledge of the scheme. Following the election, Berkey asked the Washington State Public Disclosure Commission (PDC) to nullify the election results and Democratic Senator Jim Kastama introduced a measure to prevent Harper from being seated in the senate. Calling the scandal one of \\"the most reprehensible efforts in recent Washington state history to mislead voters,\\" former Washington Supreme Court justice Phil Talmadge issued a public appeal to lieutenant governor Brad Owen to delay Harper's swearing-in until after a court ruling. Despite the campaign to block his seating, Harper ‚Äì who denied any knowledge of the scheme ‚Äì was sworn into the senate in January 2011. Acting on a recommendation from the PDC, Attorney-General Rob McKenna sued Moxie Media. An out-of-court settlement saw the firm agreeing to pay the state $290,000 in penalties ($140,000 was suspended provided the company committed no more violations before 2015), representing one of the largest election-related fines in the state's history. Within a year however, the firm was doubling its pre-scandal revenue. In 2012 it grossed $2 million, primarily from new business contracts with the Washington Democratic Party. In September 2013, the Washington state Democratic Party named Harper its \\"Male Elected Official of the Year.\\" Two months later, however, Harper abruptly resigned, following rumors he had been involved in an extramarital affair with a lobbyist. Harper said his resignation was motivated by a desire to spend more time with his family.

Her work combines the Mi‚Äôkmaq tradition of basket weaving with sculpture, installation, and performance art. In all its manifestations her work operates as didactic intervention, seeking to both confront and educate her viewers about issues of identity, colonial history, tradition, and cultural practice. In 2017 she won the Sobey Art Award. Early life and education Ursula A. Johnson was born in Sydney, Nova Scotia, in 1980. She was raised in Eskasoni First Nation, Cape Breton, which lays claim to be the largest Mi‚Äôkmaq community in the world. She was taught basket weaving by her great-grandmother, renowned artist Caroline Gould. Johnson pursued a secondary education, first enrolling in the Theatre Arts Program at the University of Cape Breton (1998-2000) in nearby Sydney, NS. She then moved to Halifax in 2002 to attend NSCAD University, earning an interdisciplinary BFA degree in 2006. Johnson then became the first Artist-in-residence at Cape Breton University. Basket weaving Many of Johnson‚Äôs exhibitions and performances include basket weaving, emphasizing traditional Mi‚Äôkmaq techniques and forms. Johnson's work in basket weaving draws attention to the way in which baskets have traditionally been placed in anthropological and historical exhibits instead of being celebrated as a continuing indigenous cultural practice. Her work blurs the line between baskets as artifacts, commodities, and art objects. Several of her experimental basket works were shown in O‚Äôpltek (It‚Äôs Not Right), a solo show at the Thunder Bay Art Gallery in 2011. In her 2006 piece for Nations in a Circle in Halifax Johnson wove a basket around herself, employing the traditional methods for the first time since her move off the reserve in an exploration of her self-defined identity as an Urban Aboriginal artist engaged with traditional Mi‚Äôkmaq cultural production and traditions. As part of her residency at Cape Breton University, Johnson developed and taught a course called ‚ÄúThe Role of the Mi‚Äôkmaw Basket in Contemporary Fine Craft‚Äù. Johnson has also taught basket weaving through NSCAD‚Äôs extended studies department. Johnson organized a 30-year retrospective of Caroline Gould's work Kloqowej (Star) at the Mary E. Black gallery before Gould‚Äôs death in 2011. Nocturne projects Johnson has produced multiple projects for multiple iterations of Nocturne: Art at Night, an annual free art festival in Halifax, Nova Scotia that takes place between 6pm and midnight: Elmiet - 2010 For the 2010, Nocturne Festival and the Prismatic Festival Johnson created a performance piece called Elmiet, a Mi‚Äôkmaq verb meaning ‚Äúto go home‚Äù, drawing attention to the history of scalping in Nova Scotia. Johnson declared the performance the last scalping in Nova Scotia. Scalping is a practice that dates back to the founding of Halifax and the 1756 Scalping Proclamation has remained in legislation despite a public apology by the Nova Scotia Government in 2000. For the performance Johnson wore a headpiece made from traditional Mi‚Äôkmaq basket weaving techniques, covering her eyes and trailing down her back like hair. She began the performance by being led through downtown Halifax by a guide and a group doing parkour who embodied the idea of energy flowing through the surroundings. At 9 pm the performance culminated on the steps of the Grand Parade (Halifax). Johnson then invited a member of the audience to remove her headpiece and symbolically scalp her. Hot Looking - 2013 For Nocturne 2013, Johnson collaborated with Soto Pow Wow dancer, Bert Milberg, to create a response to the 2012 No Doubt music video for Looking Hot. For the performance Milberg danced from 6pm to midnight in the storefront window of a luxury shop on Spring Garden road. He danced in full regalia to Looking Hot on a loop, intermittently stopping to sit and pose as viewers took pictures and video. The piece was a response to the appropriation and commodification of indigenous cultures and identity.  L'nuisimk: El-noo-wee-simk: Speaking Indian - 2018  For Nocturne 2018 (curated by Raven Davis), Johnson and partner, Angella Parsons performed as Kinuk (their performance duo). Throughout the event, they performed three durational and mobile performances across Halifax and Dartmouth. Speaking to each other in their first languages, Johnson in Mi'kmaw and Parsons in English, the conversations engaged with themes of vulnerability, intimacy, and more immediately, their surroundings.

She has photographed rock and jazz musicians since the early 1960s. She was the co-founder of the White Panther Party along with John Sinclair and Pun Plamondon. Early life Magdalene Arndt was born on March 8, 1940, in K√∂nigsberg, Germany, later renamed Kaliningrad when it became territory of the Soviet Union. She grew up in the village of Vahldorf near Magdeburg in East Germany where she listened to American jazz artists such as Harry Belafonte, Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald on Radio Luxemburg. She emigrated to the United States in 1959, living with relatives in Detroit while studying geography at Wayne State University. There, she was involved with a short-lived arts project called the Red Door Gallery. In 1964, she met poet and jazz critic John Sinclair, and with 14 other people, they founded the Detroit Artists Workshop on November 1, 1964. That group soon established a network of communal houses, and a performance space and print shop. Arndt began photographing jazz musicians performing in Detroit, including John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk and Yusuf Lateef. She married John Sinclair in 1965 at the First Unitarian Church of Detroit on Cass Avenue. They had two children, Marion Sunny Sinclair, born in 1967, and Celia Sanchez Mao Sinclair, born in 1970. Art and activism In October 1965, the Detroit Artists Workshop was raided by 25 police officers, and six people, including Sinclair's husband John, were arrested on marijuana charges. John Sinclair, already on probation as a result of a previous marijuana arrest, was later sentenced to six months in jail. When he was released in August 1966, Leni organized a party and a rock and roll band called the MC5 performed. At first, the Sinclairs, who were jazz fans, disliked the MC5, but soon they recognized their creativity and became fans. John Sinclair became their manager, and Leni Sinclair started photographing their performances. Her photos of the band have been described as \\"iconic\\". When the Grande Ballroom opened on October 6, 1966, Leni Sinclair teamed up with poster artist Gary Grimshaw and formed the Magic Veil Light Company to produce psychedelic light shows during rock and roll performances. On January 24, 1967, the Detroit Artists Workshop was again raided, along with several other locations. Both John and Leni Sinclair were arrested, as were 54 other people. Although most of those arrested were never charged, John Sinclair faced ten years in prison for a third marijuana conviction. Released on bail, he set out with Leni and Grimshaw to reorganize the workshop into Trans-Love Energies Unlimited, named after a lyric in a Donovan song. The new group was organized as a \\"new total cooperative tribal living and working commune\\" whose stated purpose was to \\"promote self reliance and tribal responsibility among the artists, craftsmen and other lovers\\". Trans-Love's first major event was a Love-in on April 30, 1967 at Belle Isle Park, an island in the Detroit River. The event was peaceful for most of the day, but after members of the Outlaws Motorcycle Club beat a man, a riot started. About 150 police officers dispersed the crowd, clubbing people from horseback. According to Leni Sinclair, who was pregnant at the time, \\"the police really started the trouble and were blaming us.\\" Less than three months later, the 1967 Detroit riot broke out resulting in 43 deaths, and the destruction of 2000 buildings, mostly by fire. In the aftermath, Trans-Love Energies provided assistance to many people who had been left homeless by the riot. But the police increased their harassment of the group. After two fire bombings, ongoing police harassment, and a curfew in Detroit due to the nationwide wave of urban rioting that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., Trans-Love abandoned Detroit and relocated to Ann Arbor, settling into two Victorian homes at 1510 and 1520 Hill Street; 28 people lived in the commune. White Panther Party On November 1, 1968, the White Panther Party was formed by Leni Sinclair, John Sinclair, and Pun Plamondon. The organization pledged to support the Black Panther Party and had a ten-point platform that included \\"total assault on the culture\\", demanding the end of money, free food, free medical care, free access to information technology, the end of corporate rule, freeing all prisoners, freeing conscripted soldiers, and freedom from \\"phony leaders\\". Later years The Sinclairs were divorced in 1977 and they then donated their papers to the Bentley Historical Library at the University of Michigan. Leni Sinclair continued doing photography and lived in New Orleans for several years before returning to Detroit in the 1990s. In 1998, a retrospective of her work was held at the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam. She has written two books, The Detroit Jazz Who's Who and Detroit Rocks! A Pictorial History of Motor City Rock and Roll 1965-1975. In January 2016, Sinclair was selected as the year's Kresge Eminent Artist, a $50,000 award given by the Kresge Foundation. Leni Sinclair Archive In 2013, Sinclair received a grant from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation for a one-year project to create a public archive of the previously \\"disorganized negatives\\" of 57,000 photos of the Detroit music scene that she has taken over a half century period.

Her work is noted for themes of language, memory, dissolution, extinction and exile. Critics also note the relevance of her work to the politics of ecological destruction, cultural homogenization, and economic disparity, particularly the way in which such phenomena disenfranchise the already powerless. Her commitment to feminist forms and methodologies is considered to be a unifying theme across her diverse body of work, among which quipus, palabrarmas and precarious stand out. Her practice has been specifically linked to the term eco-feminism. Cecilia Vicu√±a was distinguished with Premio Vel√°zquez de Artes Pl√°sticas 2019, Spain‚Äôs most prominent art award and given out by the Spanish Ministry of Culture to an artist based in the country or from the Ibero-American Community of Nations. The jury statement said that she is receiving the award for her ‚Äúoutstanding work as a poet, visual artist and activist‚Äù and her ‚Äúmultidimensional art that interacts with the earth, written language, and weaving.‚Äù.  Life  Cecilia Vicu√±a was born in Santiago de Chile in 1948 and raised in La Florida, in the Maipo valley. From 1957 to 1964, she learned English at St Gabriel's English School and made large abstract paintings at her first studio built by her father. In 1966, she attended architecture school at the University of Chile in Santiago but switched to the fine arts school. In 1967 she founded the \\"Tribu No\\" and the Mexican magazine El Corno Emplumado published her first poem. She received her MFA from the University of Chile in 1971 and moved to London with a British Council Award in 1972 to attend the Slade School of Fine Art. In 1973 she went into exile in London following the death of President Salvador Allende and the 1973 Chilean coup d'√©tat led by General Augusto Pinochet, she remained in London. While exiled in London, Vicu√±a largely focused on political activism, demonstrating in peaceful protests against fascism and human rights violations in Chile and other countries. She is a founding member of Artists for Democracy and organized the Arts Festival for Democracy in Chile at the Royal College of Art in 1974. In 1975, Vicu√±a left London and moved to Bogot√°, Colombia to conduct independent research of indigenous art and culture. She traveled throughout the country, Venezuela and Brazil. In Bogot√° she was invited by Teatro La Candelaria and Corporaci√≥n Colombiana de Teatro to create stage designs. In 1980, Vicu√±a moved to New York City and married C√©sar Paternosto. In the 80's she exhibited her work at MoMA, the Alternative Museum, and the Center for Inter American Relations in New York. In the 1990s, Vicu√±a had several solo exhibitions in the United States, such as \\"Precarious,\\" a solo exhibition at Exit Art, New York (1990); \\"El Ande Futuro,\\" a solo exhibition at the University Art Museum, Berkeley, California (1992); and \\"Cloud-Net,\\" a solo travelling exhibition at Hallwalls Contemporary Arts Center, Buffalo, NY (1998), DiverseWorks Artspace, Houston, Texas, and Art in General, New York, NY (1998). She was interviewed for the 2010 film !Women Art Revolution. In 2018, Vicu√±a became the Princeton University Art Museum's 2018 Sarah Lee Elson International Artist-in- Residence. As part of her residency, Vicu√±a performed with Colombian pianist Ricardo Gallo.  Performance  Cecilia Vicu√±a Vicu√±a was the founder of Tribu No and author of the No Manifesto, that created art actions in Santiago de Chile from 1967 to 1972. In 1979, while living in Bogot√°, Vicu√±a performed El Vaso de Leche (The Glass of Milk) in which she gathered an audience and spilled a glass of white paint to protest the deaths of an estimated 1,920 children due to contaminated milk. The company responsible had mixed fillers like paint into the milk to maximize their profits. She performs her poetry internationally, frequently in conjunction with exhibitions or art installations, and documents her performances in videos, the Vicu√±a audio page at Pennsound, and the 2012 collection Spit Temple: The Selected Performances of Cecilia Vicuna which includes transcriptions, commentary, and audience commentaries.  Publications  Vicu√±a has authored and published twenty two books of her visual art installations and poetry. Her writing has been translated into several languages. These include Saboram√≠ (1973), the first book testimony of the Military Coup in Chile, documenting the death of Salvador Allende, The Precarious/Precario (1983), Cloud Net (2000), Instan (2002) and Spit Temple (2010), a collection of her oral performances. In 1966, for one of her most experimental books, El Diario Est√∫pido, Vicu√±a wrote 7,000 words a day, recording her emotions and experiences. In 2009, she co-edited the Oxford Book of Latin American Poetry with Ernesto Livon Grosman, an anthology of 500 years of Latin American Poetry, which the Washington Post called \\"magisterial.\\"  Poetry  * Saborami.

Visual art = Quipus  Vicu√±a has become increasingly recognized for her monumental works featuring raw wool and other fibers, dyed crimson and suspended or draped overhead. Viewers and critics often react to the works as evocative of blood. Vicu√±a refers to these fiber installations as quipus, referencing the indigenous writing systems suppressed by Spanish colonizing forces. Unlike transportable pre-Columbian quipus, Vicu√±a's quipus are integrated into the landscape or the gallery in which they appear. Vicu√±a referred to her first quipu as the \\"quipu that remembers nothing,\\" it was an empty cord as well as her first precario.  Objects  Vicu√±a creates \\"precarious works\\" characterized by her use of materials that are often fragile, worn by the elements and/or biodegradable: a return to the environment. She describes her work as a way of \\"hearing an ancient silence waiting to be heard.\\" In 1966, she began creating sculptural interventions called precarios, combining ritual and assemblage using typically throw-away materials such as yarn, sticks, feathers, leaves, stones and bones. Between June 24, 1973-August 1974, she created over 400 precarios as an act of political resistance in response to General Pinochet's military coup of President Salvador Allende. This series of precarios were called A Journal of Objects for the Chilean Resistance. The 12 books of the journal are now in the collection of the Tate Gallery in London.  Installations  Vicu√±a's installations often consist of large wool strands of various colors and textures. In her Cloud-Net installation series, she utilized the wool of the sacred wild Andean vicu√±a animal (linked to her by name) in large-scale warp and weft weavings incorporated into rural and urban environments. This installation in particular linked Vicu√±a to the Feminist Art Movement's Pattern and Decoration Movement. In her solo exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, she combined the use of these wool installations with projection technology and sound systems to create an immersive and atmospheric experience for museum visitors.  Paintings  Vicu√±a made numerous paintings in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Many of these paintings make reference to 16th- Century indigenous artists who included their own cultural influences within their paintings of angels and saints for the Catholic Church. In Vicu√±a's paintings, religious icons are replaced by personal, political, and literary figures such as Karl Marx, Lenin, Salvador Allende, Ho Chi Minh, and members of her own family. In 2018, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York acquired the 1972 portrait of Karl Marx from her Heroes of the Revolution series. Later, in 1981, Vicu√±a performed Parti si Pasi√≥n (Share ‚Äì Yes ‚Äì Passion) in New York, where she wrote \\"Parti si Pasi√≥n\\" in the colors of the American and Chilean flags on the road to the World Trade Center. The name of this work is a dissection of the word \\"participation.\\" Vicu√±a calls this deconstruction of language palabrarmas, translating to \\"armswords.\\" This is a combination of the Spanish word \\"armas\\" (arms, weapons) and \\"palabra\\" (words).  Exhibitions  Museums that have exhibited her work include the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes de Santiago, the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA), Art in General, the Whitechapel Art Gallery in London, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the University of California, Berkeley Art Museum, MoMA, Brooklyn Museum, and the Museum of Fine Art Boston. Her work is also displayed in the Cerrillos National Center for Contemporary Art near where she grew up. Alongside her quipus, paintings, poetry, and films, there is also documentation of the work she has done with activist groups like Chile's La Tribu, Artists for Democracy in London, and the Heresies Collective. In 2017, her work was included in both the Athens and the Kassel sites of documenta 14. In 2017, the Contemporary Arts Center New Orleans originated a traveling exhibition entitled Cecilia Vicu√±a: About To Happen. This exhibit was both a \\"lament and love letter to the sea\\", featuring washed up debris shaped into sculptures. In 2018 the exhibition, \\"Cecilia Vicu√±a: Disappeared Quipu,\\" was shown at the Brooklyn Museum (May 18‚ÄìNovember 25, 2018) as well as the Museum of Fine Arts Boston (October 20, 2018 ‚Äì January 21, 2019). Combining large strands of wool to make a gigantic quipu with a four channel video projection, Vicu√±a explored the experience of being separated from one's own culture and language. Vicu√±a is represented by Lehmann Maupin in New York, England & Co. in London, and Galerie Patricia Ready in Santiago. In 2018, her exhibition La India Contaminada, her first survey exhibition in New York, was shown at Lehmann Maupin and reviewed in Artforum. In 2019, the Institute of Contemporary Art at the University of Pennsylvania held the first major solo exhibition of Vicu√±a's work. Also in 2019 her first restrospective, Seehearing the Enlightened Failure was shown at Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art, Rotterdam, Netherlands.

Early life Beatrice Lazzari was born to Lorenzo (Luciano) Lazzari and Francesca Rinaldo. She was the second of three sisters, the youngest of whom, Onorina (Nini), married architect Carlo Scarpa. Beatrice's training took place in Venice, first at the Benedetto Marcello Conservatory and then at the Fine Art Academy. She was a lecturer at the Academy of Fine Arts. Her work initially turned to figurative painting. Her first exhibition was in 1924 at the collective-Opera Bevilacqua La Masa. In 1928 she had her first solo exhibition at Gallery Art Workshops in Venice and, the following year, another was held at the Galleria San Moise. The Venetian art scene in the 1930s, animated by the Artistic Circle of Palazzo dei Piombi e dal Caff√® on the banks of the Zattere, included Carlo Scarpa, Mario Deluigi and Virgilio Guidi and began a pioneering path and rationalist research. Her renown as a painter was for portraits and landscapes. In the applied arts,Irene de Guttry, Maria Pia Maino, Mario Quesada, Le arti minori d‚Äôautore in Italia dal 1900 al 1930, Bari, Italy: Laterza 1985 the artist made a clean break with the figurative tradition, choosing the abstract and geometric compositions as expressive language. Roman years 1935-1981 In 1935 she moved to Rome where she participated in major exhibitions, exhibiting murals and decorative panels, working with the architect Ernesto Lapadula. In 1941 she married the Venetian architect Diego Rosa. After the Second World War, except for collaborating with the architect Attilio Lapadula on some furniture, she devoted herself exclusively to painting and received numerous awards for her work. Hers was a new direction, even if the vibrations and modulations of lines and colors on the canvas approached Vasily Vasilievich Kandinsky. In the 1950s she participated in the Venice Biennale and the Rome Quadrennial several times, getting various prizes, and had solo exhibitions in numerous galleries. From the late 1950s to 1963, she worked with oil colors to deepen the application of other materials such as glues, sands, paints and later acrylics. In 1964 the artist started again from scratch, giving up the material and color to express herself with the simplest of means: often lines drawn with graphite on a monochrome background. The series of acrylic paintings executed at the end of the 1960s and 1970s testifies to the last stage of a journey of extraordinary lyricism and modernity, which consolidates her position as major figure in Italian art.

The pioneering project focused on giving a platform to lesbian and feminist perspectives of participants through performance, art making, salons, workshops and writing. One significant piece of work created during the project was An Oral Herstory of Lesbianism, in 1979, which documented lesbian women and their feelings, views, experiences, and expression. The Lesbian Art Project was part of an ongoing effort by Arlene Raven, co-founder of the LA Woman's Building, to incorporate lesbian-oriented programming into the Feminist Studio Workshop, which had already launched the Los Angeles League for the Advancement of Lesbianism in the Arts (LALALA) in 1975. Critics and artists influenced by the tenets of postmodernism dismissed much of the art work made in the 1970s from a lesbian feminist perspective. This has resulted in very little being known or written about this pioneering work. The activities and events associated with the Lesbian Art Project at the Woman‚Äôs Building in Los Angeles have played a larger role in lesbian art history than is often acknowledged. The project began with six women (started by Terry Wolverton) working collectively with a common goal of increasing opportunity for lesbian artists and writing a chapter of lesbian art. This small group disbanded in less than a year but Wolverton and Raven continued in their pursuit of a Lesbian Art Movement. As they continued their project they became astonishingly productive, and they were able to integrate the Lesbian Art Project with the curriculum of the Feminist Studio Workshop at the Woman‚Äôs Building. At the Woman's Building they were able to organize a major performance event based on lesbian identities: The Oral Herstory of Lesbianism (Oral).

Garrard. \\"The power of feminist art: The American movement of the 1970s, history and impact.\\" (1996). the project was directed by Wolverton and its stories generated through a workshop for the thirteen performers. The scenes addressed a wide range of issues, including butch and femme identities, incest and sexual abuse, and lesbian stereotypes. Another performance sponsored by the LAP was Terry Wolverton and Ann Shannon's FEMINA: An IntraSpace Voyage (1978), which was created as a response to popular, patriarchal science fiction and is considered to be an example of lesbian feminist camp. Along with the major performance events, a database for lesbian artists was now in existence. Wolverton and Raven went their separate ways before completing the book they had planned but both continued to individually promote feminist and lesbian art. A partial successor to the LAP was the 1980 Great American Lesbian Art Show (GALAS), also at the Woman's Building.

Lemieux brought to the studio a discipline equally based on introspection, and the manifestations of an ideological minimalism. Process is a key component in the execution of her works over the past three decades, creating the lure to the confrontation of issues of social and historical urgency. Lemieux has been the recipient of awards from the National Endowment of the Arts and the Keiser Wilhelm Museum, Germany and an honorary Doctorate in Fine Arts from Monserrat College of Art. Presently, in addition to her studio and exhibition schedule, she is a senior lecturer at Harvard University in the area of visual and environmental studies. Lemieux is represented by Elizabeth Dee Gallery in New York. Early life Annette Rose Lemieux was born in Norfolk, Virginia. Her father Joseph was in the Marines, and the family lived in a house close to the base. When Lemieux's father was called overseas, her mother, Margaret, moved with their two daughters ‚Äì Annette and Suzette ‚Äì to her hometown of Torrington, Connecticut; her parents would later divorce. Later on, she received her Bachelor of Fine Arts in painting from Hartford Art School University of Hartford in Connecticut. Work In early works like It‚Äôs a Wonderful Life, 1986 [named after the 1946 Frank Capra film], Lemieux incorporated multiple forms of popular media to create a narrative in the form of self-doubt, personal vulnerability, along with an awareness of the absurdist political/religious/economic histories we accumulate as a civilization in a never-ending current. Following the legacies of Robert Rauschenberg and John Cage, she works to narrow the gap between ‚Äúart‚Äù and ‚Äúlife‚Äù. Lemieux's works resist the traps of a ‚Äúsignature style,‚Äù and she has referred to her shows looking more like group shows rather than a single artist's. Her work surprises us, challenges her audience to keep up, and resists the conformity of the brand. As stated by Peggy Phelan, ‚ÄúFor Lemieux, the art object offers her thoughts and feelings a way to travel . . . Art is her way of responding, both publicly and intimately, to the ongoing predicament of our lives‚Äù.Lemieux, Annette, Lelia Amalfitano, Judith H. Fox, Rosetta Brooks, Peggy Phelan, Robert Pincus-Witten, and Lucy Flint-Gohlke. The Strange Life of Objects: The Art of Annette Lemieux. Champaign, Ill: Krannert Art Museum and Kinkead Pavilion, 2010. Lemieux works from a repertoire of real objects and images from films and books featuring reproductions of historical photographs from the forties and fifties, which she calls her ‚Äúlandscape.‚Äù Her practice reflects a deep commitment to content and well as process, incorporating intellectual analyses of social codes with an emphasis on psychological and emotional content. Fundamentally interdisciplinary in content and form, Lemieux‚Äôs work is a continual exploration and explication of our cultural constructs and how objects that reflect the self define the self within the culture. In her review of Lemieux's major retrospective \\"The Strange Life of Objects,\\" Elizabeth Michelman explains that, \\"[In] addressing her content-laden material systematically, not sentimentally, Lemieux places objects and images in predicaments that are highly structured and memorable. In both two- and three-dimensional formats, she appropriates and wittily recontextualizes furnishings, texts and photographs rescued from history, popular culture and personal records.\\" In her recent show entitled Unfinished Business at the Carpenter Center, Harvard University, Lemieux explored the territory between object, mediated memory, personal experience and cultural history that has informed her practice for three decades. Lemieux‚Äôs objects and imagery derive directly from the world as it exists, not from the recesses of a private imagination that must search itself to produce the substance of invented images. With representative examples of her work in over 50 public collections, Lemieux has been the focus of two recent exhibitions organized by the Krannert Art Museum and Harvard University. In 2017, awarded with the Maud Morgan Prize Lemieux had the space to exhibit her work at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston. In an article about the exhibition, Lemieux remarks that she did not intend for her work to come out as political commentary, but due to the current political climate after the United States 2016 elections, viewers could not help but feel their current worries and the tensions reflected in Lemieux's work. Lemieux remarked that what she creates are \\"duets,\\" taking objects from different places and times and blending them together, leaving her 2017 exhibit, \\"hair-raising polarity between peril and play.\\" Lemieux has also revised her works as the Global Correspondent reported, \\"The Day after the election last November, Lemieux e-emailed the Whitney Museum of America Art and instructed them to upend her piece 'Left Right Left Right.\\" The raised fists in 30 photolithography now point downward.\\" As Lemieux remarked that she created the piece in a time of optimism and felt that the piece needed reflect the time rather than a past moment. Collections Lemieux's work can be found in the permanent collections of numerous art museums, including Museum of Modern Art, New York; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Whitney Museum of American Art; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Hirshhorn Museum, Washington; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven; Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University; Worcester Art Museum, Worcester MA; Museum of Fine Arts Boston; The Art Institute Chicago, as well as many other museums throughout the world. Additionally, she has received awards and grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Kaiser Wilhelm Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, as well as other institutions. In 2009, received an honorary Doctorate in Fine Arts from Montserrat College of Art as well. Recent Solo exhibitions *Annette Lemieux. Broken, Mazzoli Gallery, Berlin, Germany (2019) *Mise en sc√®ne.

Scott (born 1948) is an African-American artist, sculptor, quilter, performance artist, installation artist, print-maker, lecturer and educator. Named a MacArthur Fellow in 2016, and a Smithsonian Visionary Artist in 2019, Scott is best known for her figurative sculptures and jewelry using free form, off-loom beadweaving techniques, similar to a peyote stitch. Each piece is often constructed using thousands of glass seed beads or pony beads, and sometimes other found objects or materials such as glass, quilting and leather. In 2018, she was hailed for working in new medium ‚Äî a mixture of soil, clay, straw, and cement ‚Äî for a sculpture meant to disintegrate and return to the earth. Scott is influenced by a variety of diverse cultures, including Native American and African traditions, Mexican, Czech, and Russian beadwork, illustration and comic books, and pop culture. Scott is renowned for her social commentary on issues such as racism, classism, sexism, violence, and cultural stereotypes, as well as themes of spiritual healing. Her work is about how Scott sees herself in a rapidly changing world: \\"These works are about personal growth, personal epiphanies and how not to get stuck in the easy ways of life- about art I am fairly fearless but in everyday life I am not.\\"  Biography  Joyce Jane Scott was born in Baltimore in 1948, the daughter of noted quilt maker Elizabeth Talford Scott and Charlie Scott Jr.Maria Gallagher, \\"The Scotts Reap What they Sew: Artists are Influenced by Slavery, African-American Themes,\\" Daily News (September 8, 1989). She has described herself as \\"a true Baltimore babe and Sandtown girl\\" and has lived in a row house in the Sandtown neighborhood for more than four decades. Her mother encouraged her creativity and Scott began drawing at the Coppin Demonstration School, a public education institution, and later attended Lemmel Middle School and Eastern High School in Baltimore. She graduated with Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Maryland Institute College of Art in 1970, and then earned a Masters of Fine Arts from the Instituto Allende in Mexico. Later, Scott pursued further education at Rochester Institute of Technology in New York and Haystack Mountain School of Crafts in Maine. Scott's own mother was an artist who taught Scott appliqu√© quilting techniques and encouraged her to pursue her career as an artist. One of her earliest artistic endeavors was sewing doll clothes. Scott is also influenced by craft traditions in her extended family of \\"quilters, woodworkers, basketweavers, chair caners, planters and blacksmiths,\\" where people developed skills in more than one craft so that they could survive. Her love of music and deep sense of spirituality solidified in her upbringing in the Pentecostal faith with its rich tradition in gospel music. Scott's African influences are manifested in her use of intricate and elaborate decoration. By using techniques similar to West African Yoruba beadwork crowns and regalia, she reconfigures beads into a sculptural format. According to scholar Leslie King-Hammond, African arts and tradition functioned to transform every day objects into beautiful decorations. Scott's practice includes performance in addition to sculpture. Her unapologetically critical and humorous personality is often employed in her performances to critique issues such as feminism, sexism, and racism. Like her jewelry and quilt works, her performance also often addresses storytelling and memory. Scott's works are held by the Baltimore Museum of Art, Detroit Institute of Arts, Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum in St. Louis, Missouri, the Mint Museum of Art in Charlotte, North Carolina, the Spencer Museum of Art at the University of Kansas, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Texas.  Featured exhibitions =I-con- nobody/I-con-o-graphy Held at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in 1991, this was Scott's first major solo exhibition. \\"The title implied the telling of truths, both the straightforward and symbolic kinds. Iconography, the symbols that explain images, and, concomitantly, society, were used by Scott to reveal the hidden motivations behind human interactions.\\" On exhibition were 29 beaded sculptural works and several large fiber-and-fabric wall collages. Included were selections (partly inspired by her mother's stories and work as a nanny) from Scott's Mammy/Nanny series (1986-1991) in which she used glass beads and leather to create racial and value distinctions. Believe I've Been Sanctified This was Scott's first work of public art. In 1991, she was chosen along with nineteen other artists to participate in a new citywide project organized by the Spoleto Festival USA in Charleston. The exhibition was called \\"Places with a Past: New Site-Specific Art in Charleston\\" and each artist was invited to select an outdoor site and create a piece that conveyed their sense of the city's community history. Scott chose four Corinthian columns that were the last remaining remnants of the old Charleston Museum. She was told by the people at the African American historical society that \\"they never wanted us in there anyway\\" and was inspired. Using found objects and beading, Scott turned the columns into weeping willows to represent tears. Beneath them she constructed a funeral pyre from 500 logs and a figure dying, or a Phoenix, to represent \\"the end of slavery or the beginning of a new era, Reconstruction.\\" Images Concealed In 1995 Scott responded to the Yale University for the Museum of African Art exhibition Face of the Gods: Art and Altar of Africa and African Americans with an installation titled Images Concealed at the San Francisco Art Institute. Curator Jean-Edith Weiffenbach noted that Scott, \\"challenged by that exhibition's revelations of the impact of African traditions on Western art, belief systems, and social customs [...] fashioned a reply that uses a contemporary hybrid of craft vocabularies from several cultures in an allegorical language that confronts stereotypes as well as issues of representation and perception.\\" Kickin' it With the Old Masters Kickin' It with the Old Masters was an art exhibition held at the Baltimore Museum of Art (BMA) in January‚ÄìMay 2000 in collaboration with Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA). \\"At the entrance to the exhibition space sat Rodin's Thinker, an icon of Western art; above the statue's head Scott suspended a beaded figure hung by the neck by chains and covered with racial epithets.\\" The juxtaposition was not to incite racial accusations but to establish an interaction with aesthetics and social constructs. Harriet Tubman and Other Truths Her largest exhibition to date opened October 20, 2017, and was on view through April 1, 2018 at Grounds for Sculpture. The exhibit, an homage to Harriet Tubman, the abolitionist who led many enslaved people to freedom, was ere organized with guest curator Lowery Stokes Sims for the exhibit, which was seen as a catalyst for transforming the public space created by J. Seward Johnson, the sculptor and philanthropist. This exhibition was guest curated by both Lowery Stokes Sims and Patterson Sims.library of congress control number 2018930401  Public art installations = Memorial Pool  The Memorial Pool in Druid Hill Park Scott received a commission in 1996 to create a public art project commemorating Pool No. 2 in Baltimore's Druid Hill Park. Built in 1921, it served the recreational and competitive swimming needs of over 100,000 African Americans in Baltimore. When the Baltimore City Parks Board refused to desegregate its pools despite a highly publicized drowning in a nearby river in 1953, the NAACP filed a lawsuit and eventually won on appeal. In June 1956 Baltimore pools opened as desegregated facilities for the first time. Pool No. 2 closed the next year, remaining largely abandoned until 1999 when Scott's installation transformed it. In designing this functional monument, Scott intended to create an ‚Äúart situation where people can go into space and hopefully be, and have a variety of uses.‚Äù The pool area itself was filled with soil and planted with grass. There were plans to include programming in the grassy area, that people would want to sit, picnic or just relax around the space. In addition to the architectural framing devices and aquatic symbolism, the original installation included abstract, colorful painted designs on the pavement around the pool that have since faded from the concrete surface and disappeared due to time and weather.

He is best known for his 1978 bestseller Air America, a non- fiction book which was made into a film in 1990. It is about the secret airline run by the CIA for covert operations during the Vietnam War. Life Christopher Robbins was born on 19 November 1946, in Bristol, where he grew up and attended Taunton School. A gifted schoolboy, he started working for free on the Evening World and then the Evening Post. At the age of sixteen he won a talent competition and become \\"junior jazz critic\\" for The Daily Telegraph another Bristol local newspaper. He later specialized in investigative work‚Äîespecially about the CIA‚Äîwriting pieces for the Observer Magazine. During the 1970s, prior to the publication of his bestseller, Robbins was just a freelance journalist, unable to pay off all his debts or pay the rent. In 2008, In Search of Kazakhstan: The Land that Disappeared (also published as Apples Are from Kazakhstan) won the Dolman Best Travel Book Award. Another book of his, The Empress of Ireland won the Saga Award for wit. Robbins wrote for many newspapers and magazines both in Europe and the US, spending most of the last years working as a journalist and scriptwriter.

He and T√¥n Th·∫•t Phan, representing emperor T·ª± ƒê·ª©c's court, signed the Treaty of Hu·∫ø. He participated in the anti- colonial C·∫ßn V∆∞∆°ng resistance and died while being sent to exile in Tahiti by the French. Knowledge of his role in the resistance was hidden or lost for many decades after his death; he was thought to have been a French collaborator for having signed the treaty. He was also a celebrated historian who was in charge of the National History Institute (Qu·ªëc S·ª≠ Qu√°n) and the Imperial College (Qu·ªëc T·ª≠ Gi√°m). He was the final editor of The Imperially Ordered Annotated Text Completely Reflecting the History of Vietnam, a Chinese-language history of Vietnam commissioned by the emperor T·ª± ƒê·ª©c, and the mentor of future emperors D·ª•c ƒê·ª©c and ƒê·ªìng Kh√°nh. There is now a prize for doctoral theses in History named after him, the Ph·∫°m Th·∫≠n Du·∫≠t Award. Early life Ph·∫°m Th·∫≠n Du·∫≠t (courtesy names Quan Th√†nh and V·ªçng S∆°n, the latter named after a mountain in his hometown Ninh B√¨nh) was born in Y√™n M√¥ Th∆∞·ª£ng village, Y√™n M·∫°c county, Y√™n M√¥ district, Ninh B√¨nh, on November 4, 1825, during emperor Minh M·∫°ng's rule. His family were poor farmers who aspired to education for their children. At the age of nine, he began studying Confucianism with V≈© Ph·∫°m Kh·∫£i in a neighbor village, but it lasted only a few days before V≈© Ph·∫°m Kh·∫£i went to Hu·∫ø to assume a government post. Ph·∫°m Th·∫≠n Du·∫≠t then became a student of his uncle, Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu VƒÉn, and afterwards studied under Ph·∫°m T∆∞ T·ªÅ, a teacher from the same village who had opened a school in Nam ƒê·ªãnh. Four years later, he returned home to study under scholar Ph·∫°m ƒê·ª©c Di·ªáu in Y√™n M√¥ district who later became his father-in-law. Realizing Du·∫≠t's potential, Ph·∫°m ƒê·ª©c Di·ªáu recommended Du·∫≠t to his close friend Ph·∫°m VƒÉn Ngh·ªã, a retired mandarin who was staunchly anti-colonialist. Imperial court career In 1850, Ph·∫°m Th·∫≠n Du·∫≠t passed the provincial exam, and took the court exam in Hu·∫ø the year after but did not advance further. Still, he was appointed as an official serving the Nguy·ªÖn dynasty during emperor T·ª± ƒê·ª©c's rule. Initially, he was the Prefecture Educational Commissioner of ƒêoan H√πng county, then promoted to Prefect of Tu·∫ßn Gi√°o. During this period, he composed the H∆∞ng H√≥a Gazettes under the name Quan Th√†nh. In 1857, he was appointed Prefect of Qu·∫ø D∆∞∆°ng, and then Prefect of L·∫°ng Giang. Afterwards he was promoted as a province official, holding posts such as Plantation Commissioner, Surveillance Commissioner, Administration Commissioner, and ultimately Governor of B·∫Øc Ninh. In 1870‚Äì1871, Ph·∫°m Th·∫≠n Du·∫≠t took part in the campaign to neutralize bandits at the midlands border. In 1873, when the French, led by Francis Garnier, attacked the Hanoi citadel (see Conquest of Cochinchina), he was designated to govern Tonkin's provinces and appoint temporary government officials, becoming Patrol of H√† N·ªôi. In 1874, he was appointed Patrol of B·∫Øc Ninh, executing a successful campaign to eliminate bandits in the north. In 1875, he became the assistant to T√¥n Th·∫•t Thuy·∫øt, responsible for the administration of two provinces, B·∫Øc Ninh and Th√°i Nguy√™n. In 1876, Ph·∫°m Th·∫≠n Du·∫≠t was summoned to Hu·∫ø to become Advisor of the Ministry of Personnel, as well as Vice Chief Officer of the Censorate. After 4 months, he was sent to the north to be the commissioner overseeing the maintenance of the Red River's floodbank and irrigation. In 1878, he was summoned to the Privy Council to become the mentor for emperor T·ª± ƒê·ª©c's princes D·ª•c ƒê·ª©c and Ch√°nh M√¥ng. Subsequently, he was put in charge of the National History Institute and the Imperial College. He was appointed principal editor of The Imperially Ordered Annotated Text Completely Reflecting the History of Vietnam by emperor T·ª± ƒê·ª©c in 1884. Treaty of Hu·∫ø and the C·∫ßn V∆∞∆°ng movement Before the second French attack of Tonkin in 1882 (part of the Tonkin Campaign), Ph·∫°m Th·∫≠n Du·∫≠t had issued a secret report to the Hu·∫ø court, laying out defensive measures against the enemy. He advocated for the construction of forts in critical mountainous areas, and anti-French military bases in Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh, H√† Tƒ©nh, with an especially large-scale one in T√¢n S·ªü, Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã. His plan was approved by the leading officials of the pro-confrontation faction of the court, T√¥n Th·∫•t Thuy·∫øt and Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn T∆∞·ªùng. Ph·∫°m Th·∫≠n Du·∫≠t headed the Nguy·ªÖn dynasty's diplomatic corps to Tientsin, China before the 1883 Tet holiday to discuss a joint resistance campaign against the French, but it proved unsuccessful. In early 1884, he was appointed the Chief General in the signing of the 19-article Treaty of Hu·∫ø on June 6, 1884, which formed the basis for the protectorates of Annam and Tonkin, and for French colonial rule in Vietnam during the next seven decades. After his death, the Vietnamese public, without knowledge of his role in the resistance, vilified him for this role in the signing of the treaty. With the Treaty of Hu·∫ø signed, French forces led by General Henri Roussel de Courcy arrived in Vietnam to take control of the country in mid-1885. de Courcy made demands that seemed to signal to the Vietnamese that his goal was to completely subjugate them: for example, he demanded to walk through the central doors of the palace, which only the Emperor could do. The Vietnamese, led by Ph·∫°m's fellow mandarins T√¥n Th·∫•t Thuy·∫øt and Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn T∆∞·ªùng, decided to launch a surprise attack against the French in a last-ditch effort for independence. Known as the \\"Hu·∫ø ambush\\", it failed, and France seized the Hu·∫ø royal palace. Ph·∫°m Th·∫≠n Du·∫≠t and other loyal mandarins fled with the young king H√†m Nghi to T√¢n S·ªü in Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province (where Ph·∫°m had previously advocated for the construction of a military base), and issued an edict calling upon Vietnamese people to rise up and \\"aid the king\\" (the English translation of \\"C·∫ßn V∆∞∆°ng\\" is \\"aid the king\\"). This edict sparked the C·∫ßn V∆∞∆°ng resistance, a large-scale insurgency against the French colonialists. The resistance had widespread support and was the strongest resistance the French had encountered since landing on Vietnamese soil in the 17th century. On July 29, 1885, while preparing to cross the sea and organize a resistance campaign in Tonkin, Ph·∫°m Th·∫≠n Du·∫≠t and his family were captured by the French. Afterward, Ph·∫°m Th·∫≠n Du·∫≠t was extradited to Hu·∫ø. He refused bribery from the French colonialists, instead accepting a jail sentence in C√¥n ƒê·∫£o. He was then later sentenced to exile in Tahiti. After 6 days on the ship on his way to Tahiti, suffering from diabetes, he died on October 23, 1885 in Malaysian waters. Death and tombstone Legend has it that his body, dressed in white clothing, was put in a bag, and dropped into the ocean. Only after a few years did his relatives and fellow villagers learn of his death; they erected a token tomb in his village to commemorate his life. The tombstone was inscribed by V≈© K·∫ø Xu√¢n telling of his deeds and achievements, but it was buried face down in order to be concealed from the French colonial authorities. For many years afterwards, because he had signed the Treaty of Hu·∫ø, Ph·∫°m Th·∫≠n Du·∫≠t was seen as a French collaborator and a traitor to the Vietnamese. However, in 1975, the tombstone was unearthed and his role as a leader of the resistance was rediscovered. His tombstone was re-erected, celebrating his life and work as a patriotic scholar and staunchly anti- colonialist official in emperor T·ª± ƒê·ª©c's court. Legacy School named after Ph·∫°m Th·∫≠n Du·∫≠t in Ninh B√¨nh, Vietnam Three streets in Vietnam are now named after Ph·∫°m Th·∫≠n Du·∫≠t ‚Äì one in Hanoi; one in District 2, Ho Chi Minh City; and one in downtown Ninh B√¨nh city. In addition, the Ph·∫°m Th·∫≠n Du·∫≠t Award is a prestigious prize awarded annually to the most excellent new doctoral theses in History Studies in Vietnam. Since 2000, the fund has given 92 prizes in total.

She is best known for her work with large- scale textile structures, especially \\"textile playgrounds\\" for children, brightly colored net-like structures of crocheted and knotted nylon.  Life and career  Toshiko Horiuchi MacAdam is a leading fibre artist in Canada and Japan, using knitting, crochet, and knot making techniques to create her work. Currently, her work focuses on creating large, interactive textile environments. MacAdam was born in Japan in 1940 but soon moved to Japanese- occupied Manchuria with her family during World War II. When the Soviet Union took over the area in 1945, MacAdam and her family were forced to flee and eventually returned to Japan. Later, MacAdam attended the Tama Fine Art Institute in Japan and went on to study in the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan, where she received her masters of fine arts degree. After graduating, MacAdam worked for Boris Kroll Fabrics, an acclaimed textile design company in New York City. She then went on to teach at universities across the United States and Japan, including the Columbia University Teachers College, Haystack Mountain School of Crafts, the University of Georgia and the Kyoto Junior College of Art. Currently, MacAdam teaches a textiles and fashion course entitled \\"Fiber Fabric Fashion\\" at NSCAD University in Halifax, Nova Scotia and runs Interplay Design and Manufacturing with her husband, Charles MacAdam, in Bridgetown, Nova Scotia.  Work = Early work  MacAdam‚Äôs work is often described as 'fibre art' which became a widely accepted art form in the 1970s. 'Fibre Columns/Romanesque Church' and 'Atmosphere of the Floating Cube' are two early pieces by the artist that were influential in the fibre art movement, and were featured in books such as 'The Art Fabric Mainstream' by Mildred Constantine & Jack Lenor Larsen. There they describe how 'she knit hundreds of gold and silver lengths, stretched them into concave panels, and composed them as a cube. Then, with powerful knee-height floodlights, she transformed the whole into a haloed radiance.' Constantine, Mildred, and Jack Lenor Larsen. The Art Fabric: Mainstream. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1981. In these works, Horiuchi MacAdam established her affinity for working on a large scale, differentiating her from many other textile and fibre artists of the time.  Textile playgrounds  MacAdam is best known for her work with large-scale textile structures. She was inspired to create textile playground spaces for children after seeing children climbing in a three-dimensional textile sculpture that she was exhibiting. After this discovery, she began to observe the lack of parks and playground in Tokyo, where she was living at the time, and the negative effect that was having on children. In 1971, she created her first work intended for children, which was later donated to a Tokyo kindergarten designed by Hatsue Yamada. She exhibited her next piece at the National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto. In the early 1970s, MacAdam‚Äôs work shifted from being simply fibre art, to interactive spaces as well as a leap from muted colours to a rainbow palette. This timeline corresponds with the birth of her son at the age of 44 and a move in 1988 to her husband Charles‚Äô native Nova Scotia, Canada. In 1979, MacAdam collaborated with Fumiaki Takano, a landscape architect, to create another large-scale playspace for a new national park in Okinawa. She was then commissioned to create a similar for the Hakone Open-Air Museum in Kanagawa. These commissions allowed her to begin her work with nylon. The crocheted playground structures are assembled in sections by a team, and can literally use \\"tons\\" of nylon. The research that she undertook on public leisure spaces, mainly focused on Japan, has influenced her perspective on the role of playgrounds and parks in the development of children. Her structures are designed for children to have a space to take risks and explore in a safe environment. The spaces are intended to let children use their imagination. In 1990, MacAdam established a business with her husband, Charles MacAdam, called Interplay Design and Manufacturing. The business operates out of Bridgetown, Nova Scotia where the couple works on commissioned projects. MacAdams‚Äôs textile playspaces are now installed in various locations worldwide, including projects in Spain, Singapore, Shanghai, New Zealand and Seoul.  Medium  To create her earlier works, MacAdam used a Japanese-developed material called Vinylon, a durable product but inferior to the nylon she has used in her later works which she crochets and dyes herself at her studio in Bridgetown, Nova Scotia. MacAdam‚Äôs playscape structures are almost entirely made by hand, with the addition of mechanically knotted elements in some pieces. Each work is original. She has cited the architecture of Antonio Gaudi and Iranian mosques as inspiration for her structural textile work.  Exhibitions  MacAdam has exhibited textile work in museums and galleries in Asia, North America and Europe. Her exhibitions have been displayed in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, New York, USA; the National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto, Japan; the Palais de Congres in Paris, France; the Cleveland Museum of Art in Cleveland, Ohio; the Metropolitan Museum of Manila in Malia, Philippines; the Gunma Modern Art Museum in Gunma, Japan; Galerie Alice Pauly in Lausanne, Switzerland; the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum in Tokyo, Japan; The Contemporary Museum in Honolulu, Hawaii, USA; and the Anna Leonowens Gallery at NSCAD University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Her textile sculpture entitled ‚ÄúAtmosphere of the Floating Cube,‚Äù owned by the Kyoto National Museum of Modern Art was included in a survey of modern influential textile artists from Japan at the Fukuoka Prefectural Museum of Art. MacAdam has also designed textiles commissioned for stage display. The Nonoichi City Culture Center‚Äôs main hall displays a large curtain created by the artist called ‚ÄúLuminous.‚Äù In 2013, MacAdam, along with Charles MacAdam and structural designer Norihide Imagawa, installed another site-specific work titled Harmonic Motion for ‚ÄúEnel Contemporanea 2013‚Äù in the Museo d‚ÄôArte Contemporanea Roma in Rome, Italy. This recent work touches on the theme of how the human body interacts with space and materials, an idea that is present in much of her architectural work.  Publications  MacAdam has also published several books, including from a line, a two-volume reference text on textile sculpture and Embroidery & Braiding: Japanese Craft, a book on embroidery techniques written jointly with Kayako Alkawa. In these books she did hundreds of illustrations demonstrating knitting, crochet, and knot making techniques she studied and learned from different cultures around the world. Her contributions are also included two European publications on public spaces for children, Design for Fun: Playgrounds and Great Kids Spaces. She also wrote a series of articles called ‚ÄòJapanese Textiles Today,‚Äô for Shenshoku no Bi Magazine. She has also contributed to other magazines in Japan and the United States.

After rising to fame in her hometown of Chicago, she became an international celebrity before leaving the public spotlight as a teenager. Theatrical manager Lou Bolton testified during the Kane v. Fleischer trial that Helen Kane saw Baby Esther's cabaret act in 1928 with him and appropriated Jones' style of singing, changing the interpolated words \\"boo- boo-boo\\" and \\"doo-doo-doo\\" to \\"boop-boop-a-doop\\" in a recording of \\"I Wanna Be Loved By You.\\" While Kane never publicly admitted her borrowing, Jones' style‚Äîas imitated by Kane‚Äîwent on to become the inspiration for the voice of the cartoon character Betty Boop. When Kane attempted to sue Fleischer Studios for using her persona, the studios defended themselves by arguing that Kane herself had taken it from \\"Baby Esther\\" Jones. An early test sound film of Baby Esther's performance was used as evidence. In court, it was presumed that Jones was still in Paris.  Biography  \\"Baby\\" Esther Lee Jones, originally billed as Little, Li'l, or Lil' Esther, was a child entertainer who lived in Chicago, Illinois. She was initially managed by her parents, Gertrude and William Jones. Esther was a trained scat singer, dancer and acrobat who performed regularly at nightclubs in Harlem and all over the United States in the 1920s. In her act, \\"Baby Esther\\" danced, made funny faces, rolled her eyes, and‚Äîmost famously‚Äîinterpolated nonsense phrases such as \\"Boo-Boo-Boo,\\" \\"Wha-Da-Da,\\" \\"Doo-Doo-Doo,\\" \\"Boo-Did-Do-Doo,\\" and \\"Lo-Di-De-Do.\\" Tony Shayne, Jones' booking agent, also served as booking agent for Helen Kane. Kane first saw Esther perform in 1928, at which time Kane had a ringside seat with Shayne at the Everglades Club on Broadway. According to her first theatrical manager, Lou Bolton, Esther began using \\"boops\\" in her scat-singing in April 1928. Kane adapted Jones' scat sounds into her own \\"poop poop pa-doop,\\" first used in her hit song \\"I Wanna Be Loved by You.\\" \\"I Wanna\\" debuted in the Broadway musical Good Boy and became famous overnight. Kane released \\"I Wanna\\" on record September 20, 1928; she also used a variety of scat sounds in her 1928 Victor song releases \\"That's My Weakness Now\\" and \\"Get Out and Get Under the Moon\\". But while Kane often claimed to have created this type of scatting herself, it was later proven in court that she had not. An early sound film was discovered which featured Baby Esther performing in this style, demonstrably earlier than \\"I Wanna Be Loved By You.\\" Baby Esther's ex-manager Bolton testified that Kane had seen Baby Esther's cabaret act in 1928 with Tony Shayne, then not too long after suddenly started to scat sing in shows. Supreme Court Judge Edward J. McGoldrick ruled, \\"The plaintiff has failed to sustain either cause of action by proof of sufficient probative force.\\" Esther was thus recognized as the original scat-singer who inspired Helen Kane to scat-sing. While touring Europe in 1930, Esther had already been honored, along with Josephine Hall, as representatives of both African-Americans and the United States of America.  Career  Baby Esther's career began in the early 1920s when she won first prize at a Charleston contest in Chicago. Esther lived in the \\"colored\\" neighborhood of Chicago with her mother and father; she was only four at the time of the contest. Russian-American theatrical manager Lou Bolton saw her performance and took her on, with her first performance purportedly being in a Chicago revue, Opera Versus Charleston. Bolton went on to arrange engagements for Esther in Chicago, New York, Detroit, Toronto and other cities, after which he brought her to Europe. Esther Jones was rarely called Baby Esther while performing, most commonly going by the names \\"Li'l Esther\\" and \\"Little Esther.\\" Originally she was billed \\"Farina's Kid Sister,\\" but was later known as the \\"Miniature Florence Mills,\\" as Esther had started her career impersonating Florence Mills. The name \\"Farina's Kid Sister\\" derived from Allen \\"Farina\\" Hoskins, another African-American child star of the period. Apart from his ongoing role in Our Gang comedies, Hoskins was an expert Charleston dancer, performing along with his sister \\"Baby Jane.\\" Lou Bolton, Esther's first manager, used Hoskins' fame to promote Esther in the early years of her career; the name formulation of Little (or Lil'/Li'l) Esther mimicked Hoskins' \\"Little Farina,\\" a frequently-used nickname. While touring Spain, Esther was referenced as a member of \\"La Pandilla,\\" the Spanish name for the Our Gang kids (taken from their alternate series name of \\"Hal Roach's Rascals\\"); at least once, she was specifically tagged as the performer of Farina, due to her past imitations of him.  1928  Esther performed briefly at a nightclub called the Everglades Club, where she would do imitations of Florence Mills, late at night. In June, Esther's father William Jones and manager Lou Bolton got fined for having a minor perform on stage; one write-up of the incident suggested that William Jones was not Esther's birth parent. At the time, Esther's booking agent was Tony Shayne, who one night brought Helen Kane‚Äîanother performer whom he managed at the time‚Äîto meet Bolton. There both Kane and Shayne had ringside seats and watched Esther sing and dance on stage. Not too long after watching Esther's performance, Helen Kane began scat-singing in her own performances. In late 1928 Esther was signed for a talking short by Movietone, booked through William Morris for MGM. While the short was later listed variously as being in production or completed, it has not surfaced as of this writing. Harrison G. Smith, a business associate of Bolden Smith of New York, furnished Esther with several songs: \\"The Turtle Walk,\\" \\"My Little Dixie Home,\\" \\"I've Got the Blues for Dixieland,\\" and \\"I Need a Man (Around My House).\\"  1929  Esther toured Europe in 1929, when her age was variously reported as seven or ten. An article in The Chicago Defender described her as the highest-paid child artist in the world. While touring Europe she delighted audiences including royalty. In Spain she played for King Alphonso and Queen Victoria Eugenie. In Sweden King Gustave and the Queen came to the theater especially to see her. In France, Germany, and other countries, Esther also gave private performances for the nobility and high society. Esther's travels around Europe were not entirely without fits and starts. After a dispute, Bolton was fired as the Jones family's manager and returned to the United States; Bolton blamed an Afro-French interpreter, cited in Variety as \\"Jacques Garnier,\\" for the fracas; at first, Esther's return to the United States was announced. But Sidney Garner‚Äîevidently the same man first cited as \\"Jacques\\"‚Äîtook over as the Joneses' manager forthwith, and the family stayed in Europe. Esther Jones first performed in France at the Moulin Rouge. In Paris, Esther was known as the \\"Miniature Josephine Baker.\\" Audiences raved over her and the Parisian newspapers gave much space to her. Vu, a leading illustrated weekly, devoted the entire front cover to her picture and a full page in the interior. Esther was described as singing, dancing, doing the splits and generally carrying on to the great delight of her audiences, and was dubbed as being \\"too cute for words\\". The London Sunday People in its review of Paris plays said of Esther: \\"Thousands flock no longer to the Moulin Rouge to see Mistinguett herself or the clever American ballet girls, or the beautiful women of the chorus, but to applaud a little mite, 10-year-old, who has won fame and wealth within the space of a few weeks. We are living in an age of speed but this amazing little child has broken every record of sudden theatrical success.\\" In Stockholm, Sweden in August, Esther was famously refused service at an American restaurant run by Brenda Tomton, an immigrant from the United States. Swedish dignitaries and officials around the country spoke up in support of Esther and objected to Tomton's discrimination, railing against American \\"Jim Crowism\\" in Sweden.  1930‚Äì1934  Esther continued her success in South America. In Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, S√£o Paulo, and Montevideo she proved to be a sensation. In Rio de Janeiro, American Ambassador Morgan came to see her play and after her performance came backstage to congratulate her. He praised her ability to sing in different languages and invited her to perform for him at the American embassy. Accompanying Esther was Gordon Stretton, who was known as the Prince of Wales' favorite jazz entertainer. In the course of the evening, the president of Brazil expressed to Sidney Garner his great pleasure at seeing such capable black American artists in Brazil. Esther was interviewed in Rio de Janeiro by press who wanted to know how she had avoided the racists who lynched and burned black people in Texas and Alabama. Esther replied that she had so far escaped their wrath by staying out of the South. When Esther returned to the United States she purportedly continued touring and danced for Cab Calloway and his Orchestra as one of his Sepia Dancers at his club in New York. From 1933 to 1934, Esther appeared in Helena Justa's Harlem Maniacs revue. One of the main reasons Baby Esther is not remembered is because she was never a feature attraction in Cab Calloway's New York club; she was a background Sepia dancer, which is why Esther was only given a small tap dancing number in Justa's revue. Justa had loaned the Sepia dancers from Cab Calloway. Esther later returned to the stage as \\"The Sepia Dancing Doll\\" and was dubbed the fastest colored dancer who was red hot. In July 1934, Esther performed in Philadelphia at a midnight benefit performance for the NAACP, along with numerous other African-American stars. The Baltimore Afro- American commented that \\"Little Esther... had a bit too much art and finesse, born of her extensive travel and contacts, not to mention expert tutelage, for her to bring... spontaneous applause... But she had charm and grace‚Äîand‚Äîand‚Äîform! [Her] acrobatic dance number was very good.\\" Esther made another Philadelphia appearance in September at a benefit for the Douglass Hospital, hosted by the famed dancer Bill \\"Bojangles\\" Robinson. Notably, Robinson also taught Helena Justa and Florence Mills. Esther has been verified as giving routine performances as late as September 1934, but her later activities are unknown. In 1934, she may have been 12 or 13 years old, as her age was reported as seven in June 1928 and in March 1929; or she may have been 15 or 16, as other articles from 1929 describe Esther as 10 years old.\\"Little Esther Dances for Group of Spanish Royalty.\\" The Chicago Defender (National edition), December 14, 1929, p. 7. Kane v. Fleischer In 1930, Fleischer Studios animator Grim Natwick introduced a caricature of Helen Kane, in the form of an anthropomorphic singing dog with droopy ears and a squeaky singing voice, in the Talkartoons cartoon Dizzy Dishes. \\"Betty Boop\\", as the character was later dubbed, soon became popular and the star of her own cartoons. In 1932, Betty Boop was changed into a human, the long dog ears becoming hoop earrings. In May 1932, Helen Kane filed a $250,000 lawsuit against Max Fleischer and Paramount Publix Corporation, for \\"exploiting her image\\", charging unfair competition and wrongful appropriation in the Betty Boop cartoons, contending that Betty Boop's \\"boop-oop-a-doop\\" style constituted a \\"deliberate caricature\\" that gave her \\"unfair competition\\". 1930 title card of one of the earliest Betty Boop cartoons The trial opened that year in the New York State Supreme Court, with Kane and Betty Boop films being viewed only by the judge. No jury was called. Vocal performers Margie Hines, Little Ann Little, Kate Wright, Bonnie Poe, and most notably Mae Questel were all summoned to testify. Little Ann Little told the court how the \\"boop-oop-a- doop\\" phrase had started out as \\"ba-da inde-do\\", which developed into \\"bo do- de-o-do\\" and finally to \\"boop-oop-a-doop\\". Helen Kane's counsel asked Little, who spoke throughout the trial in a Betty Boop voice, \\"Oh, do you speak like that way at home?\\" Little responded to the court, \\"Yes, indeedy!\\"  Defense uses Baby Esther The defense argued that Kane had taken the idea from Baby Esther. Evidence was produced that Kane actually derived that singing style from watching Baby Esther perform at the Everglades Restaurant several years before the creation of the Betty Boop character. Theatrical manager Lou Bolton testified for the defense stating that in 1925, he coached a \\"young negro child\\" named Esther, teaching her how to interpolate her songs with scat lyrics, \\"boo-boo-boo\\" and \\"doo-doo-doo\\", which Kane later reinvented as her trademark \\"boop oop a doop\\". Jones' manager testified that he and Kane had seen her act together in April 1928, and just a few weeks later, Kane began to \\"boop\\". Paramount was able to prove that Kane did not uniquely originate or have claim to the Betty Boop style of singing or look. In addition to adducing Baby Esther's performances, they showed performances by actress Clara Bow, who also had the Betty Boop style of dress and hair. Louis Bolton was brought in court to testify. Bolton told the court that he had no idea where Esther was, and he thought that she was \\"probably still\\" in Paris. After a two-year legal struggle, Max Fleischer located a sound film made in 1928 of her performing, which was introduced as evidence.Fleischer, Richard (2005). Out of the Inkwell: Max Fleischer and the Animation Revolution, Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, p. 57. . Judge Edward J. McGoldrick ruled, \\"The plaintiff has failed to sustain either cause of action by proof of sufficient probative force.\\" In his opinion, the \\"baby\\" technique of singing did not originate with Kane.The Mansfield News, May 5, 1934. Legacy Jones is now spoken of mostly in the context of her indirect influence to Betty Boop's vocal stylings. Jazz studies scholar Robert O'Meally has referred to Jones as Betty Boop's \\"black grandmother\\". Images of a model, Olya, taken by Russian-based studio Retro Atelier in 2008, made up in costume and make-up as a Betty Boop look-alike are regularly misidentified as Esther Jones.  Misconceptions  Baby Esther shares her original name and original stage name with Little Esther Phillips, who was also known as Esther Mae Jones. Both singers used the names \\"Little Esther\\" and \\"Li'l Esther\\", but Esther Phillips was of a later generation, born in 1935.Harris, Sheldon (1994). Blues Who's Who (Revised Ed.). New York: Da Capo Press. p. 417. . An image that went viral (dubbed Baby Esther) was a white Ukrainian female model called Oyla. Older images claiming to be Baby Esther went viral because an official Betty Boop Checks source called Betty Boop and Helen Kane, which is no longer online, had used one of James Van Der Zee photographs of a pretty black college girl beside an image of Clara Bow, claiming it to be Baby Esther without proof.

Best known for her collaborative projects incorporating urban landscapes, Brown founded, in 2008, the artistic laboratory senseofplace LAB. Brown earned an MFA from the California Institute of the Arts, studied psychology in New York, and worked in Rotterdam for five years. She taught a course of her own design, ‚ÄúInterdisciplinary Media and Contemporary Society‚Äù, at The New School from 2000 to 2012. She has lived in San Francisco since 2007. Work Brown was one of 15 artists that were part of a residency program, sponsored by the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, located in Tower 1 of the World Trade Center when the September 11 attacks destroyed both the working space and the council's Tower 5 office. The group exhibited nonetheless, showing at the nearby New Museum of Contemporary Art. Brown re-used material from her original project and, wrote New York Times critic Holland Cotter, produced \\"something very different in tone and meaning. Using bits from a film about the ubiquitous security surveillance at the trade center, she has simulated the panoramic view she saw daily from her Tower 1 studio windows: New York Harbor with the Statue of Liberty to the south, Tower 2 to the southeast.\\" The work incorporated footage she had taken the day before the attacks. While living in Rotterdam, Brown created a webcast and poster addressing controversies over squatting in the Netherlands. Brown's series, Honoring Japan's 'sense of place', includes a triptych that combines a textile with photograph of a crowded intersection that echos the cloth's colors and grid. Another work, also employing juxtaposition of two mediums, combines a photo of people sitting over a canal two abstract watercolors. \\"When I'm in a place\\", she was quoted in SFWeekly, \\"it's not just seeing one thing‚Äîit's a layering of different things, with lots of different elements.\\" In October 2013, Brown invited four artists, Jeff Hantman, Alicia Escott, Brian King and Githinji Mbire, to create works using debris dumped illegally on the streets of Oakland. The resulting works employed, among other found objects, a truck tire, leather couch, and jawbone from an unidentified rodent.

According to Weisstein, \\"she tired of hearing pop music glorify the subjugation and degradation of women.... [and] wanted to reach out to young women and at the same time, educate about the importance of feminist culture.\\" She continued \\"Every time it played, the band summoned up the ecstasy of a utopian vision of a world without hierarchy and domination. Audience and performer, gay and straight, two-year-olds and eighty-two-year-olds, black teenage girls and Latino transvestites: for a moment in history as brief as a shiver, we were, all of us, transformed and astonished.\\" In 1972, the Chicago group, along with its New Haven counterpart, recorded their first LP called Mountain Moving Day. The Chicago tracks were \\"Secretary\\", \\"Ain't Gonna Marry\\", \\"Papa\\", and \\"Mountain Moving Day\\". The New Haven tracks were \\"Abortion Song\\", \\"Sister Witch\\", \\"Prison Song\\", \\"So Fine!\\", and \\"Shotgun\\". According to the liner notes of Mountain Moving Day: \\"We wanted to make music that would embody the radical, feminist, humanitarian vision we shared.\\" For example, in \\"Abortion Song,\\" lyrics read: > We've got to get together and fight. They tell us to get married and have > three or four kids. Change the diapers, be a good wife. But we will decide > how many children to bear. We've got to control our own life. The band broke up in mid-1973 after Weisstein moved to the East Coast. After the band's dissolution, Abod remembered: \\"A lot of women came up to me after our shows and said, 'I want to do that,' and we tried to make them understand that they could. Any of them could. And I think a lot of them did.\\" This legacy of a female-empowering, do-it-yourself ethos was echoed twenty years later in the punk music Riot Grrrl Movement. Indeed, the EP Mountain Moving Day was remastered and re-released in 2005 under the title Papa Don't Lay That Shit on Me by Rounder Records with two bonus tracks by contemporary feminist rock group Le Tigre.

Early life and education  Temkin was born in Torrington, Connecticut, to father Dr. Abraham Temkin, a dentist, and mother Joann Temkin (n√©e Bernstein). In 1981, Temkin received an undergraduate degree from Harvard University. In 1984, she received a Ph.D in art history from Yale University.  Career  After completing her doctorate Temkin became an assistant curator in the Department of Painting and Sculpture at MoMA in 1984. In 1987 she began working at the Philadelphia Museum of Art under director Anne d'Harnoncourt. After spending a year as Acting Curator, Temkin was named the Muriel and Philip Berman Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art in 1990. There, she worked on exhibitions including: Barnett Newman (2002), Alice Neel (2001), Constantin Brancusi (1995), and Thinking Is Form: The Drawings of Joseph Beuys (1994). She commissioned new work by artists like Sherrie Levine, Rirkrit Tiravanija and Richard Hamilton for her \\"Museum Studies\\" series, which she herself created. Temkin was also responsible for the renovation to the modern and contemporary galleries at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. In 2003, after working for 13 years at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Ann Temkin returned to working in the painting and sculpture department at MoMA. Temkin was named the Marie Jos√©e and Henry Kravis Chief Curator of Painting and Sculpture in 2008. She was the first woman to hold this position, considered the most prestigious in the field of modern art. As the Chief Curator of Painting and Sculpture she was responsible for curating or co-curating exhibitions including: Picasso Sculpture (2015); Robert Gober: The Heart Is Not a Metaphor (2014), the artist‚Äôs first American retrospective; Jasper Johns: Regrets (2014); Ileana Sonnabend: Ambassador for the New (2013); Ellsworth Kelly: Chatham Series (2013); Claes Oldenburg: The Street and The Store and Mouse Museum/Ray Gun Wing (2013); Abstract Expressionist New York (2010); Gabriel Orozco (2009); and Color Chart: Reinventing Color, 1950 to Today (2008). In August 2013, she delivered a lecture at Torrington's Five Points Gallery. In order to address the lack of expertise in African American art at MoMA, Temkin hired African American art history specialist Darby English as consulting curator. He aims to expand MoMa's acquisitions in the area. She is still MoMA‚Äôs chief curator of painting and sculpture.  Personal life  In 1998, Temkin married American biophysicist and University professor, Wayne Hendrickson.

It is the plan of the current Mexican government that a new civilian international airport for Mexico City be built on the grounds of the air force base. Construction started on October 17, 2019 with a symbolic ceremony and a short video presentation after all judicial suspensions against the airport were revoked. Two runways and a new terminal are planned during the first phase, due to open by March 21, 2022 as ordered by president Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador. The airport will be operated by the Secretariat of National Defense (SEDENA) which will also receive all of the airport's earnings. The new airport is to be christened General Felipe √Ångeles International Airport. Construction On April 24, 2019, Mexican president Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador announced that construction of the new airport would commence on April 29, 2019. On June 12, a judge ordered the suspension of construction of the airport until environmental and cultural studies have been completed. The Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) announced its approval of construction of a terminal at the new airport site on July 17, 2019. Construction officially started on October 17, 2019. President L√≥pez Obrador also promised that the master plan and all information regarding the airport will be released in the coming days, saying transparency will be key in the project. The \\"General Felipe √Ångeles\\" Airport is reported to be 18.1% completed as of October 15, 2020, with 521 days to go until its planned date of completion. 23,425 civilian jobs have been created alongside 926 military laborers. The airport is intended to focus on low-cost and cargo airlines to help relieve Mexico City's International Airport congestion. Mexican architect Francisco Gonzalez Pulido and military general Gustavo Vallejo are in charge of airport design. The master plan is in charge of Groupe ADP and the airspace navigability studies were made by Airbus subsidiary Navblue. The Valley of Mexico will be the first in the country where the performance-based navigation system (PBN) is used, which will allow the Felipe √Ångeles International Airport, the Mexico City International Airport, and the Toluca International Airport to operate simultaneously without the operations of one impeding those of the others. Remains of at least 200 mammoths were discovered during the construction of the terminal area, in the former Lake Xaltocan. Most of the newly-discovered mammoths likely died after being trapped by mud in the ancient lake or hunted by other animals. Nothing was found that would require halting work on the airport project. Construction of the airport was considered a priority during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico. Despite social distancing and other efforts to avoid infection, at least four employees were infected with the virus and there were 37 suspected cases along with three deaths as of June 9, 2020.

He expanded his kingdom southwards at the expense of the Hoysalas, and fought the Chaulukyas and the Vaghelas for the control of the Lata region in the north. He also defeated the Paramaras of Malwa, the Shilaharas of Kolhapur and the Rattas of Belgaum. His generals subjugated several insubordinate feudatory chiefs, and the Yadava territory reached its greatest extent during his reign.  Early life  Simhana, whose name is also transliterated as Singhana, was the son of his predecessor Jaitugi. His birth was believed to have been a result of the blessings of the goddess Narasimhi of Parnakheta. Therefore, he was named after this goddess. It is not clear when Simhana ascended the throne. Jaitgui's last known inscription is dated 1196, and Simhana's earliest known inscription is dated 1197. However, other inscriptions variously suggest that Simhana ascended the throne in 1200, 1207 or 1210. Two Kandagal inscriptions, dated 1208 and 1220, are stated to have been issued in the 8th and 20th year of his reign respectively, thus suggesting that he ascended the throne in 1200. A third inscription from the same place suggests that he ascended the throne in 1210. The Kallaru stone inscription suggests that he ascended the throne in 1208-09. The Elavata, Kadkal and Kuppataru inscriptions suggest another date for his ascension. Simhana had definitely not ascended the throne in 1197, because Jaitugi is known to have appointed the Kakatiya ruler Ganapati as his vassal in 1198. Historian A. S. Altekar theorizes that Simhana was formally associated with his father's administration as the heir apparent (yuvaraja) after 1200, which may explain why some inscriptions date his ascension as early as 1200. According to Altekar, Jaitugi most probably continued to rule until 1210, when Simhana succeeded him as the king. On the other hand, T. V. Mahalingam theorizes that Simhana was crowned as his father's successor in 1200, and had a second coronation in 1210 to mark his conquest of the Hoysala territories. According to Mahalingam, the inscriptions that suggest an earlier date (e.g. 1200) for Simhana's coronation were found in the northern part of his kingdom. On the other hand, the inscriptions that place his coronation in 1210 were found in the southern part of his kingdom (that is, south of the Malaprabha River). A 1226-27 inscription discovered at Doni in the southern region states that sixteen years had passed since Simhana's entry in the area (nadu). This suggests that Simhana conquered this southern region in c. 1210, and therefore, the inscriptions found in this region count his reign from that year.  Military career = Kakatiyas  Some later inscriptions, such as those discovered at Chikka Sakuna and Munoli, state that Simhana beheaded the king of Telanga, and placed another person on the empty throne. This suggests that he participated in his father's campaign against the Kakatiyas. As a result of these campaigns, the Kakatiya kings Rudra and Mahadeva were killed, and Mahadeva's son Ganapati was installed on the throne as a Yadava vassal. Ganapati maintained cordial relations with Simhana. During the first half of his reign, Ganapati only assumed the titles of a feudatory chief. A 1228 inscription of Ganapati claims that he defeated the Latas. This suggests that he accompanied the Simhana's forces during their expedition in the Lata region of present-day southern Gujarat (see below). During the second half of his reign, Ganapati seems to have assumed an independent status. However, Simhana was an old man by this time, and remained busy with his expeditions in Gujarat. Ganapati also avoided adopting an aggressive attitude towards the Yadavas, having spent the early part of his life in their captivity. Therefore, no major conflict happened between these two kings.  Hoysalas  Simhana's grandfather Bhillama V had suffered a humiliating defeat against the Hoysala king Ballala II at Soratur. The Yadavas decided to avenge this defeat by invading the Hoysala-controlled territory. Simhana's inscriptions discovered in the region to the south of the Malaprabha River are dated as early as 1202, which suggests that the Yadavas had made inroads into this area by this time. A 1206 inscription shows that by that year, the Yadavas had conquered a part of the present-day Bijapur district, and placed it under their general Keshavadeva. By 1212, they had penetrated into the present-day Anantpur, Bellary, Chitradurga, and Shimoga districts, as attested by their inscriptions discovered in these areas. By 1213, they had annexed most of the present-day Dharwad district, as shown by an inscription discovered at Gadag. The Gadag, Paithan, and Tiluvalli inscriptions state that Simhana defeated Ballala. The Rattas of Saundatti, who formerly acknowledged the Hoysala suzerainty, switched their allegiance to Simhana, and helped him in expanding the Yadava power southwards. Sometime before 1215, the Yadavas captured Banavasi, and Simhana's confidant Sarvadhikarin Mayideva was appointed as its governor. In 1222, he was succeeded by Vanka Ravata, an officer from Karad. By 1220, Simhana had completed his conquest of the area to the north of the Tungabhadra River. The Hoysalas were busy at their southern frontier with the Pandyas, which worked in Simhana's favour.  Shilaharas of Kolhapur  In 1216, Simhana launched an expedition against the Kohalpur Shilahara king Bhoja II. Taking advantage of the conflict between the Chalukyas, the Kalachuris, the Yadavas, and the Hoysalas, Bhoja had assumed imperial titles. By 1187, he called himself the Vikrama of the Kaliyuga. By 1205, even his prot√©g√© Somadeva had assumed imperial titles such as Paramabhattaraka (\\"Supreme Overlord\\"), Rajadhiraja (\\"King of kings\\"), and Paschima-chakravarti (\\"the western Chakravarti\\"). While the Yadavas were engaged in their campaign against the Hoysalas during 1210-1215, Bhoja seems to have attacked their kingdom. As a result, Simhana invaded the Shilahara territory, and defeated Bhoja, who fled to Panhala. A Yadava inscription states that Simhana was \\"an eagle who caused the serpent in the form of the mighty ruler Bhoja, hiding in the fort of Panhala, to take a flight.\\" This suggests that Bhoja, who was already an old man by this time, had to flee from Panhala. Nothing is known about the ultimate fate of Bhoja or his son Gandaraditya. Epigraphic evidence suggests that the Shilahara kingdom, including the capital Kolhapur, was annexed to the Yadava kingdom. This annexation seems to have taken place before 1217, as a 1217 inscription found in the Shimoga district describes Simhana as a vajra (thunderbolt) to the Panhala fort. A 1218 inscription found at Kolhapur records the construction of a gate before the Ambabai temple by Simhana's officer Tailana.  Paramaras  Paramaras, the northern neighbours of the Yadavas, ruled the Malwa region. In the past, Simhana's grandfather Bhillama had raided their territories. Simhana's contemporary Paramara king Arjunavarman married the Hoysala princess Sarvakala, who was probably a daughter of grand-daughter of the Hoysala king Ballala. Simhana's invasion of the Hoysala territory appears to have led a fresh conflict between the Paramaras and the Yadavas. Simhana invaded the Paramara kingdom in 1215, and according to the later Yadava court poet Hemadri, this invasion resulted in the defeat and death of Arjunavarman. The veracity of Hemadri's claim is doubtful, as the 1222 Bahal inscription mentions Arjunavarman's defeat, but not his death. The Tiluvalli inscription also states that Simhana humbled the lord of Malwa.  Lata, Chaulukyas and Vaghelas  The Chaulukya king Bhima II ruled the present-day Gujarat, located to the north-west of the Yadava territory. Simha, the Chahamana ruler of the Lata region in southern Gujarat, was originally a Chaulukya feudatory, but had later shifted his allegiance to the Paramaras. After Simhana's victory over the Paramaras, he found himself in a tough situation, and re-accepted the Chaulukya suzerainty. The Chaulukya chronicle Kirti-Kaumudi states that the Chaulukya general Lavanaprasada (of Vaghela family) forced Simhana to retreat. In 1220, Simhana sent a stronger army to Lata. This army was led by his general Kholeshvara, who held the fief of the neighbouring Khandesh and Vidarbha regions. At this time, the Chaulukya throne had been seized by an usurper named Jayantasimha, and therefore, the Chaulukyas were unable to help Simha. According to Hammira-mada-mardana, Simha and his brother Sindhuraja died fighting the Yadavas. The 1228 Ambe inscription of Kholeshvara describes his victory, and also mentions that Simha was killed in the battle. Sindhuraja's son Shankha (alias Sangramasimha) was taken prisoner by the Yadavas. Simhana later released Shankha, and allowed him to rule Lata as a Yadava feudatory. Shankha remained loyal to Simhana in the later years. Meanwhile, the Chaulukya general Lavanaprasada invaded Lata, and captured the important port city of Khambhat. The Chaulukya minister Vastupala was appointed as its governor in 1219. Sometime later, while the Chaulukya forces were busy suppressing a revolt in the Marwar region, Shankha attacked Bharuch, but was forced to retreat by Vastupala. Subsequently, he launched another invasion of the Chaulukya kingdom with Simhana's assistance. The Kirti-Kaumudi attests that this invasion caused a massive panic in Gujarat. The exact details of this invasion have been obscured by the various poetic legends, none of which give a date for it. According to these legends, Shankha convinced Simhana and the Paramara king Devapala to send a joint expedition to Gujarat. Simhana's force was led by Kholeshvara, and Shankha himself led one of the invading armies. Lavanaprasada resolved the threat by creating a rift between the invading allies. One of his spies stole Devapala's favourite horse, and another spy gave it to Shankha claiming that it was a gift from Devapala. Meanwhile, a forged letter was made to fall in Simhana's hands: in this letter, Devapala had purportedly assured Shankha that he would attack Simhana's army in Gujarat, and had also urged him to kill Simhana to avenge his father's death. This letter convinced Simhana that Shankha and Devapala were conspiring against him. It appears that Simhana withdrew from the planned invasion, and the Chaulukya-Yadava conflict came to end in c. 1232 with a peace treaty. Historian A. S. Altekar speculates that Simhana must have received considerable wealth for agreeing to this peace treaty, in addition to the confirmation of his protectorate over the Lata region. The 13th century text Lekhapaddhati, which provides specimens for different types of letters, includes a text of the peace treaty between Lavanaprasada and Simhana. However, this appears to be a specimen rather than a true historical document. In the 1240s, Lavanaprasada's grandson Visaladeva usurped the power in Gujarat, and became a monarch. During his reign, Simhana's forces invaded Gujarat unsuccessfully. Simhana's general Rama (a son of Kholeshvara) was killed in this campaign. The Yadavas' conflict with Gujarat ultimately weakened both the kingdoms, and paved way for the Muslim conquest of these kingdoms half a century after Simhana's death.  Southern feudatories  The Ratta chiefs ruled a small principality in the present-day Belgaum district, and kept shifting their allegiance between the dominant imperial powers of the region. Sometime during 1228-1238, Simhana's general Bichana appears to have conquered the Ratta principality. The last Ratta ruler was Lakshmideva II, and he is last known to have ruled in 1228. By 1238, Bichana ruled the former Ratta territory as a feudatory of Simhana. Bichana also subdued other chiefs, such as the Guttas of Dharwad, the Kadambas of Hangal, and the Kadambas of Goa. These chiefs kept shifting their allegiance between the Hoysalas and the Yadavas, and tried to become independent whenever presented with an opportunity. Bichana inflicted severe punishments on these chiefs for their insubordination. In 1237, the Gutta chief rebelled against Simhana, and even raided the Yadava territory. Simhana sent a 30,000-strong cavalry against him: this army captured the Gutti fort.  Other victories  The Yadava records contain exaggerated accounts of Simhana's other victories. For example, one inscription states that Simhana was: The court poet Hemadri mentions that Simhana captured the elephant force of King Jajalla, and ended the sovereignty of King Kakkula. The name Jajalla sounds like that of the Ratnapura Kalachuri rulers of present-day Chhattisgarh, but no king named Jajalla was a contemporary of Simhana. The last known ruler bearing this name was Jajalla II, who had died by 1170. The name Kakkula sounds like that of the Tripuri Kalachuri rulers, but the last king with a similar name was Kokalla II, who had died around 200 years before Simhana's ascension. It is possible that these victories refer to Simhana's successes in occasional clashes with local chiefs at his north-eastern frontier. His armies may have penetrated their territories, as suggested by the discoveries of a few coins of Simhana in Chhattisgarh. Historian A. S. Altekar notes that a king named Kakakla is known to have ruled a part of southern Karnataka, and wonders if this king is Hemadri's Kakkula. A 1206 Patan inscription claims that the kings of Mathura and Varanasi had felt the menance of the Yadava power. The accuracy of these claims is doubtful, as they are not supported by any historical evidence. The Ambe inscription states that Simhana defeated king Ramapala of Varanasi, but no such king is known to have ruled Varanasi during Simhana's reign. At best, it is possible that Simhana defeated some local chiefs who claimed to be descendants of the former rulers of Mathura and Varanasi. These kings may have described themselves as the lords of Mathura and Varanasi, just like the Simhana's family claimed descent from the ancient Yadavas and claimed to have ruled their ancient capital Dvaravati. The 1206 Patan inscription also claims that an obscure general of Simhana defeated a Muslim ruler. This claim is also doubtful, and at best, Simhana's army may have faced a frontier skirmish with a Muslim army during one of its expeditions in Malwa or Gujarat. Some Yadava inscriptions also credit Simhana and his generals (Kholeshvara, Rama and Bichana) with victories in other parts of India. According to these inscriptions, Simhana or his generals defeated the kings of Panchala, Nepala, Anga, Vanga (or Vengi), Kalinga, Chera, Pallava, and Sindhu. These conventional poetic claims seem to be purely imaginary, and there is no evidence of the Yadava army having penetrated these distant regions. At best, Pallava here may refer to Kopperunchinga, whose Kadava dynasty was related to the ancient Pallavas.  Territorial extent  Simhana is regarded as the greatest ruler of his dynasty. The Yadava kingdom reached its greatest extent during his reign. In the north, it probably extended up to the Narmada River. In the south, his kingdom extended up to the Tungabhadra River, and included Belvola and Banavasi. In the west, it touched the Arabian Sea, and in the east, it included the western part of Andhra: Simhana's inscriptions have been discovered in the present-day Anantpur and Kurnool districts. Simhana consolidated the Yadava rule in the newly-annexed territories by posting his trusted lieutenants there. At his northern frontier, he assigned the fiefs of Khandesh and Vidarbha to his general Kholeshvara. At his southern frontier, he assigned the fief of southern Karnataka to his general Bichana. Kholeshvara was born to a Brahmin named Trivikrama, but adopted a warrior role, and defeated several small chiefs in the Vidarbha and Khandesh regions. These chiefs included Lakshmideva of Bhambhagiri (modern Bhamer), Hemadri of Khandesh, and Bhoja of Chanda (in present-day Madhya Pradesh). Since Kholeshvara came from a Brahmin family, he appears to have had a soft corner for the Brahmins, as suggest by his establishments of a number of agrahara (Brahmin settlements). Bichana, the son of Chikkadeva, was born in a Vaishya family. He played an important role in the anti-Hoysala campaigns, and one of his inscriptions claims that he advanced as far as the Kaveri River, where he set up a victory pillar. He succeeded Jagadala Purushottama-deva as Simhana's viceroy in the southern part of the Yadava kingdom, in 1230.  Cultural activities  The authorship of Sangita-ratnakara, a work on music, is attributed to Simhana's court poet Sarangadeva. A commentary on this work is attributed to Simhana himself. It is not certain if Simhana actually wrote this commentary, or if he was the patron of its actual author. Simhana's courtiers included two noted astronomers: Anantadeva and Changadeva. Anantadeva wrote commentaries on Brahmagupta's Brahma-sphuta-siddhanta and Varahamihira's Brihat-jataka. Changadeva established a college of astronomy in Patana town of Khandesh region, in the memory of his grandfather Bhaskaracharya.  Last days  Simhana had two wives, named Jeha-devi and Kavala-devi. His son Jaitugi II (not to be confused with his father Jaitugi I) is known to have been the yuvaraja (heir apparent) in 1229, but he probably died before Simhana. Therefore, Simhana was succeeded by his grandson Krishna. According to A. S. Altekar, Krishna's inscriptions suggest that 2 November 1248 fell in the second year of his reign, while 25 December 1248 fell in the third year of his reign. Therefore, Altekar concludes that Simhana most probably died in either November of December of 1246, when Krishna succeeded him. According to T. V. Mahalingam (1957), there are at least six inscriptions which suggest that Simhana ruled at least until October 1247. Some Yadava inscriptions suggest that Krishna was ruling in March 1246. This indicates that Krishna was associated Simhana's administration since at least 1246, and succeeded him in the last quarter of 1247.

It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. History The main track through Suttons Bay was laid down in 1903 by the Traverse City, Leelanau, and Manistique Railroad, to access a Northport-Manistique car ferry. A siding was built a few years later; however, the railway was immediately unsuccessful and the ferry was discontinued by 1908. In 1919, a successor company, the Leelanau Transit Company was organized to take over ownership of the tracks. They leased the line to the Manistee and North-Eastern Railroad and built this depot between the main line and siding in Suttons Bay as a passenger and freight station. In the 1960s, the tracks north of Suttons Bay were abandoned. The track section between Suttons Bay and Traverse City were used by the Leelanau Scenic Railroad between 1989 and 1995. In 1996, the track were torn up and a rail trail put in its place. The depot is used as a law office. Description The Suttons Bay Railroad Depot is a single-story Arts- and-Crafts-inspired structure with a hip roof, built of rounded cobblestones. The roof overhangs widely on all sides of the building, sheltering the walls and the trackside platform.

After dropping out of Rhode Island School of Design at age 19, Speed spent her twenties moving around the U.S. and Canada working pickup jobs (house painter, horse trainer, ad writer, farm worker, etc.) until moving to Texas in 1978, where she settled down and taught herself to paint. She switches back and forth regularly between oil painting, printmaking, collage, gouache and drawing, often combining disciplines. Two large volumes of her work, Julie Speed, Paintings, Constructions and Works on Paper, 2004 and Speed, Art 2003-2009 have been published by the University of Texas. She lives and works in Marfa, Texas. In her words, ‚ÄúI keep hours just like a real job, only longer, and in my spare time I read books, drink tequila, and garden.‚Äù  Style and technique  Speed paints surreal scenes in a realistic style with oil and gouache. Her collages incorporate scientific illustrations and architectural drawings. In collaboration with her husband Fran Christina, and Flatbed Press in Austin, Texas, she creates limited edition etchings. Julie Speed, LUCKY, 2013 \\"Speed‚Äôs work has been described as surrealist, hallucinogenic, iconoclastic and absurdist. Her detailed microorganism paintings, such as Blue or Metamporphoses, bring to mind the intricate scientific prints of Ernst Haeckel. The disquiet of her portraits, particularly the Hostage and Jawbone series, evoke the unflinching pathos of Otto Dix. Her continued reference to Renaissance themes and images combine the allegory of Bosch and Bruegel with the flatness usually found in Mexican primitivism. And yet, none of these influences begin to encapsulate the strangeness of Speed‚Äôs work. Speed‚Äôs unique vision is most pronounced in collage, although this term is inadequate to fully describe her compositions, which combine etching, gouache, mixed media, ink, and found paper. The animating spirit of her work lies in the spirit of collage ‚Äî even her paintings seem to stem from some incongruous ‚Äúother‚Äù place, a hidden layer hovering imperceptibly in the background, immediately jarring the viewer. ‚Äú -Leigh Baldwin ( February 2013) ‚ÄúForce of Confusion‚Äù published by The Southwest School of Art, San Antonio \\"Julie Speed is a quirky neo-Surrealist whose inspirations range from old master and Mughal painting to that 20th-century master of arcana, John Graham‚Ä¶...

Early life Born in Greenwich Village in New York City, Agnes Tait was the second and last child of Anita Innocentia McCarthy and John C. Tait. Her mother was of Irish Catholic descent and travelled to New York from Cuba. Her father emigrated to America from Guernsey, in the Channel Islands, and owned a small roofing business. After graduating from grammar school, Tait secretly applied to the National Academy of Design much to her parents' surprise, who were happy at the prospect of a free tuition. She completed the mandatory antique drawing class from 1908 to 1910 and the life painting class from 1910 to 1916. As part of her studies, she attended the life drawing course taught by Leon Kroll. During her studies she earned multiple awards for her work, including the Hollgarten prizes for painting (10$) and composition (30$), a prize for pastel drawing (10$) as well as the Suydam bronze medal for life drawing. After graduating, she returned to Greenwich Village to take care of her terminally ill father. Determined to succeed as both a painter and a dancer, she painted during the day and danced in a chorus line at night, maintaining this lifestyle until the death of her father in 1919. Career  Tait's Skating in Central Park (1934) Black and white reproduction of Come Away, Oh Human Child, 1916 New York Watercolor Club Exhibition Tait began exhibiting at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1915 and continued in the annuals at the National Academy of Design, the Corcoran, and the Pennsylvania Academy in the early 1930s. Her determination to succeed in her artistic endeavors prompted her to study in Paris. In 1927, Tait spent several weeks in a studio in Paris, where she completed a lithography course at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, before returning to New York City to rent her own studio in King Street in Lower Manhattan. Confident in her talent as an artist, she contacted Valentine Dudensing of the Dudensing Gallery, who asked her to \\"come in with her portfolio.\\" Impressed with her work, he organized an exhibit showcasing her paintings and those of two other fellow artists Jo Cantine and Jean Paul Slusser. Her painting Melancholia was featured in a review in the New York Times, which noted the influence of the esthetic ideas of the Pre-Raphaelite school on her work. Tait's The Bride was selected for the First Annual Exhibition of American Paintings and Sculpture at the Art Institute of Chicago (October 25-December 16, 1928) and reproduced in the Chicago Evening Post with the caption \\"a picture accorded much popular admiration in the recent American show at the Art Institute\\". Encouraged by her success, she undertook additional studies and enrolled in a sketch class at the Whitney Studio. In Summer 1928, she gained representation from Cooperstown Art Association for their first exhibition. Commissions for her work, including a print for a United Fruit Company executive, allowed her to travel to Europe, Jamaica, and Haiti. The Great Depression crashed the art market which led Ferargil Gallery to request Anges to paint portraits of widely known public figures in hopes to glean buyers. She received critical praise for her work on these and other portraits, though the art market would not recover for years to come. In 1933, Tait took a third trip to Europe, this time with her new husband, William McNulty, a recently unemployed writer. Upon returning to the United States, she joined the Public Works of Art Project (PWAP), which commissioned drawings representing the \\"American Scene\\" for federal facilities. Grateful for this opportunity, she began working on her most famous piece, Skating in Central Park, a painting that combined stylistic elements inspired from American Primitive Art merged with influences drawn from Pieter Breughel the Elder's artistic universe. The work's success led to further employment under the Federal Art Project, including small lithographic editions and mural work. Her mural Fruits of the Land (1941) is located in the post office in Laurinburg, North Carolina. Tait's fondness for travel and adventure led her on a trip to Trinidad and Dominica, which she documented in a series of lithographs. One of the prints originating from this body of work, Trinidad Singers and Dominique, was exhibited in a women artists group show in New York's Argent Galleries (January 1940) and was featured in a review of the show in the Art Digest. Tait illustrated three children's books, Peter & Penny of the Island, Heide and Paco's Miracle. New Mexico Her husband's declining health prompted the couple to relocate to Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1941 where Agnes discovered the Fine Arts Museum and added Southwestern landscape painting to her repertoire. In 1943, Tait's lithograph El Cristo Rey was chosen for the First National Exhibition of Prints at the Library of Congress. Her lithograph Survivors was also selected for the print exhibition \\"America in the War, the Artists for Victory.\\" Motivated by these successes, she arranged one-woman shows in New York and Santa Fe. In 1945, the Fine Art Museum of New Mexico organized an exhibition of Tait's work, which travelled to several southwestern cities. During this time, her sister and husband developed health complications that pre-occupied Tait, who found solace in painting cats. Despite the hardships, she continued to take commissions for portraits and murals, and after 22 years in Santa Fe Agnes set out to find a new home. This was in part a result of her disappointment in being relegated to the status of \\"New Mexico Artist\\". Tait once said \\"If people want to think of me as a Santa Fe artist, well--let them think anything they want.\\" After spending time in Italy, Ireland, and Florida, she returned to Santa Fe to live out the rest of her life until her death in 1981.

Her work spanned drawing, printmaking, and sculpture. Associated with the Minimalist movement, her work utilized abstract and geometric forms in order to evoke a spiritual reaction from the viewer. Biography Born Zarina Rashid on 16 July 1937 in Aligarh, British India to Sheikh Abdur Rashid, faculty at Aligarh Muslim University, and Fahmida Begum, a homemaker, Zarina earned a degree in mathematics before studying a variety of printmaking methods in Thailand, in Paris apprenticing to Stanley William Hayter, and with printmaker T≈çshi Yoshida in Tokyo, Japan. She lived and worked in New York City. During the 1980s, Zarina served as a board member of the New York Feminist Art Institute and an instructor of papermaking workshops at the affiliated Women's Center for Learning. While on the editorial board of the feminist art journal Heresies, she contributed to the \\"Third World Women\\" issue. Zarina died in London from complications of Alzheimer's disease on 25 April 2020.  Artistry  Zarina's art was informed by her identity as a Muslim-born Indian woman, as well as a lifetime spent traveling from place to place. She used visual elements from Islamic religious decoration, especially the regular geometry commonly found in Islamic architecture. The abstract and spare geometric style of her early works has been compared to that of minimalists such as Sol LeWitt. Zarina's work explored the concept of home as a fluid, abstract space that transcends physicality or location. Her work often featured symbols that call to mind such ideas as movement, diaspora, exile. For example, woodblock print Paper Like Skin depicts a thin black line meandering upward across a white background, dividing the page from the bottom right corner to the top left corner. The line possesses a cartographic quality that, in its winding and angular division of the page, suggests a border between two places, or perhaps a topographical chart of a journey that is yet unfinished.  Selected exhibitions  Zarina was one of four artists/artist-groups to represent India in its first entry at the Venice Biennale in 2011. The Hammer Museum in Los Angeles organized the first retrospective of her work in 2012. Entitled Zarina: Paper Like Skin, the exhibition traveled to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Art Institute of Chicago. During the 2017‚Äì18 academic year Zarina was the Artist-in-Residence at the Asian/Pacific/American Institute at NYU. The residency culminated in a solo exhibition, Zarina: Dark Roads (6 October 2017 ‚Äì 2 February 2018) and a publication, Directions to My House. Examples of her work are in the permanent art collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and Biblioth√®que Nationale de France.

This kind of testing is used most often by couples who are considering becoming pregnant to determine the risks of their child inheriting one of these genetic disorders.  Background  Genes come in pairs; one from the mother and one from the father. A carrier is a person who inherited one abnormal gene from one of their parents. Carriers often show no symptoms of the genetic disorder that they carry an abnormal gene for. Usually the only time a person finds out that they are a carrier for a specific genetic disorder is when they have an affected child. For these kinds of genetic diseases to be present in a person, two copies of the abnormal gene are needed. This means that both of the parents have to be a carrier for the child to inherit the disease.  Reasons for testing  The most common reason for carrier testing to allow future parents to find out if they are a carrier for a genetic disorder. If the parents are a carrier for a genetic disorder they can know ahead of time what their probability is of having an affected child. Carrier testing can be done before or during the pregnancy. Many of these genetic disease are fatal at a young age which oftentimes encourages parents to get tested.  Autosomal recessive disorders/diseases  There are hundreds of recessive genetic disorders, most of which are very rare. Certain genetic disorders tend to be more common in people of a particular ethnicity. For example, people of African American ethnicity have a much higher likelihood of being a carrier for the autosomal recessive disorder called sickle cell anemia. People of one ethnicity in particular, Ashkenazi Jewish, have a tendency to be carriers for a wide variety of recessive genetic disorders. There are also several recessive disorders that are present in all ethnicities. This list includes: cystic fibrosis, fragile X syndrome, and spinal muscular atrophy.  Testing methods  Carrier testing is most often done through a simple blood test. The results from these tests are usually available anywhere between two and eight weeks depending on where the testing is conducted. Some tests may screen for one or a few genetic conditions, and other tests may screen for hundreds. For example, in Australia, multiple companies offer carrier screening tests for the carrier status of three genes, whereas an extended screen is available that looks for variations in 552 genes. An alternative method of testing, available for some conditions, analyzes gene products that are usually present in a person that keeps the genetic disorder from occurring. An affected person with the disorder would have close to a hundred percent reduction of the gene products compared to an unaffected person. A carrier would only have a fifty percent reduction in those gene products.  Risks involved  The physical risks for getting this kind of genetic testing done are very minimal. The most common requirement is a blood sample. The emotional risks on the other hand are great. When a person finds out they are a carrier for a specific genetic disorder, dealing with that can be very difficult. In many cases, people who find out they are carries can become angered or even enraged that they carry a genetic defect that could be passed on to their child. These results can play a role in determining if a couple will have a child together. If both parents are carriers for the same genetic disorder, there is a twenty-five percent chance that any child they have could be affected. When a person finds out they are a carrier, they are always encouraged to talk to a genetic counselor. If both partners are carriers for the same genetic disease, the choice to have a child together can become much more difficult. IVF with preimplantation genetic diagnosis may be considered, to remove the risk of having an affected child.

Her work has crossed boundaries between architecture, landscape architecture, engineering and urban design. Her installations are collaborative in nature: she has worked with scientists, historians, designers, and public administrators. She is primarily interested in how to engage the public in decoding their surrounding environment.  Early life and education  Miss was born May 27, 1944 in New York City, but she spent her youth moving every year while living primarily in the western United States. Miss studied art and received a B.A. from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1966. Miss later received an M.F.A. from the Rhinehart School of Sculpture of Maryland Institute College of Art in 1968.  Influence in public art  As a public artist, Miss is considered a pioneer in environmental art and site-specific art, as well a leading sculptor during the feminist movement of the 1970s. She was a founding member of the journal Heresies. From her earliest work, she has been interested in bringing the specific attributes of a site into focus along with and audience engagement within public space. Miss‚Äô work crosses boundaries between landscape architecture, architecture, urban design, and graphic communication. Her work creates situations that emphasize a site's history, ecology, or aspects of the environment that have gone unnoticed. She has been particularly interested in redefining the role of the artist in the public domain. In her influential 1979 essay, Sculpture in the Expanded Field, art critic Rosalind Krauss opens with a description of Mary Miss‚Äôs, Perimeters/Pavilions/Decoys. Krauss uses Miss's work to support her examination of sculpture's interdisciplinary nature between architecture and landscape. South Cove (1988), a permanent public project in Battery Park, is a seminal project in Miss' career as it signified new possibilities for artists working in the public realm. The project, located on a three-acre site at the base of the riverfront Esplande, was made in collaboration with architect Stanton Eckstut and landscape designer Susan Child. \\"South Cove brings the public more intimately in contact with the water than any other component of Battery park City or, indeed, any other Manhattan riverside park.\\" Since 2008 Miss has worked on the development of the City as Living Laboratory: Sustainability Made Tangible through the Arts, a non- profit organization which nurtures teams of artists and scientists working with neighborhood communities to bring about greater environmental awareness and envision more livable cities of sustenance.  Notable work  Ropes/Shore (1969) traced the edge of Ward's Island with ropes staked and pulled taut at 20-foot intervals. Battery Park Landfill (1973) installation was a temporary piece of five signboard-like structures, placed 50-feet apart across the landfill site. A series of large cut out circles descended into the ground describing a column of air that materialized only when the viewer stood with the boards aligned. Untitled (1975) was created in April and May 1973 at the Allen Memorial Art Museum in Oberlin, Ohio, as part of the exhibition Four Young Americans (which also featured Ann McCoy, Ree Morton, and Jackie Winsor). This initial version of the work comprised wooden slats protruding directly from the soil along the sides of a square hole cut into the ground on the northeast lawn of the museum. The museum subsequently invited Miss to re- create the work using permanent materials--making this her first permanent commissioned work and her earliest extant public work. Constructed in the summer of 1975 under the artist's supervision, the second version was created with powder-coated steel slats protruding from tinted concrete, in its original siting. Perimeters/Pavilions/Decoys (1977), located at the Nassau County Museum. For this installation, three tower-like structures, two mounds and an underground courtyard were built on a 5-acre park site. The towers varied in size, from 12‚Äô to 18‚Äô tall. After passing between the earth mounds, the viewer came upon a 16‚Äô square opening in the ground with a protruding ladder. Approaching the hole and descending, a sunken courtyard is revealed. Inside the submerged courtyard were numerous doorways, windows and corridors to venture. The viewer encounters experiences and multiple perspectives, both above and below ground. South Cove (1984), New York City, the Battery Park City Fine Arts Commission chose Miss to be the lead artist for South Cove, a restoration and waterfront promenade along the Hudson River in Manhattan. The 3.5-acre park near the tip of Manhattan, is composed of wooden pilings, trellises, grids, and a steel mesh overlook. The project also served restorative functions for both the damaged landscape and isolated waterfront. Miss worked in collaboration with landscape architect Susan Child and architect Stanton Eckstut on this project. Framing Union Square, 14th Street Subway, NYCFraming Union Square (1992-2000), New York City, Miss collaborated with architect Lee Harris Pomeroy to create 125 red frame elements scattered throughout the Fourteenth Street Union Square Subway Station. The red elements highlight the disappearance of lost infrastructure as well as industrial elements that remain. The Des Moines Art Center (1986-96), Des Moines, Iowa, is a 7.5-acre site developed as both an art installation and restoration site. It includes a demonstration wetland, outdoor classroom, overhanging walkways, a pavilion, and a curved trellis. The structures highlight the connection between land and water. Visual elements and images are interwoven throughout the site to reflect the history of the park and its surroundings. CALL/City as Living Laboratory: Sustainability Made Tangible through the Arts (2008‚Äìpresent). CaLL focuses on reshaping the boundaries between artists and urban infrastructure by articulating a vision of the public sphere where artists are able to address environmental issues of our time. Multiple projects have been developed or are under development as part of this initiative.  CALL projects  BROADWAY: 1000 Steps (2011 ‚Äì ongoing) is a long-term initiative to establish Broadway as the ‚Äúgreen‚Äù corridor of New York City. It was started by Miss in City as Living Laboratory. Ravenswood/CaLL (2011) was a project to highlight ecology, the history of manufacturing, and the presence of small-scale artisanal fabrication and artists in New York City's Long Island City neighborhood. The project focuses on the submerged Sunswick Creek, which is traced through the neighborhood. FLOW (Can You See the River?) (2011) was a project made up of a series of ‚Äòstopping places‚Äô along a six-mile stretch of the White River between the Indianapolis Museum of Art and the center of Indianapolis. The Passage (2010) was a project intended for a ride on the Staten Island Ferry from Manhattan to the Staten Island Courthouse Memorial Green. Roshanara‚Äôs Net (2008) created a temporary garden of medicinal plants‚Äîayurvedic herbs, trees and bushes‚Äîin New Delhi, India. The installation focused on the small scale‚Äîthe health and well being of the individuals and their communities. Parks as Living Laboratory (2005-2006) was developed by Mary Miss during the Master Plan phase for the Orange County Great Park in Irvine, California that would encourage active participation and collaboration in city parks. The goal was to create a Research and Residency Center, a place where artists could collaborate/engage with scientists and social scientists. StreamLines (2015) installed a cluster of mirrors and red beams in five Indianapolis neighborhoods, which radiate out from a central point to nearby streams and waterways. The installation was intended to get visitors to follow the beams to the nearby waterways. This project was made possible by a grant from the National Science Foundation.  Exhibitions  Miss was included in the exhibition Twenty-Six Contemporary Women Artists at the Aldrich Museum in 1971. Lucy Lippard was the curator, and other artists included Alice Aycock and Jackie Winsor. She was also included in the exhibition Four Young Americans alongside the artists Ann McCoy, Ree Morton, and Jackie Winsor, curated by Ellen H. Johnson and Athena Tacha at the Allen Memorial Art Museum at Oberlin College. Along with others, Miss's work has been included in the exhibitions Decoys, Complexes and Triggers at the Sculpture Center in New York, Weather Report: Art and Climate Change organized by Lucy Lippard at the Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art, More Than Minimal: Feminism and Abstraction in the 1970s at the Rose Art Museum, and Century City: Art and Culture in the Modern Metropolis at the Tate Modern. Miss has also been the subject of exhibitions at the Harvard University Art Museum, Brown University Gallery, The Institute of Contemporary Art in London, the Architectural Association in London, Harvard University's Graduate School of Design, and the Des Moines Art Center.

She was praised for her talent and ambition by Cristoforo Bronzini in his 1625 dialogue Della dignit√† delle donne, dialogo‚Ä¶settimana prima e giornata quarta as having \\"given the world many beautiful and spiritual compositions\\" despite her \\"most tender age.\\" Bronzini, Cristoforo. Della dignit√† delle donne, dialogo‚Ä¶settimana prima e giornata quarta. Florence: Zanobi Pignoni, 1625. Biography Cervoni was the daughter of the poet Giovanni Cervoni (1508-after 1582), who wrote frequently for the Medici court and published with Giorgio Marescotti in Florence. Like her father, in her early work Cervoni concentrated on praise of the Medici family. Her first poem on record is the 1590 ‚ÄúCanzone . . . sopra ‚Äôl felicissimo Natale del Ser[enissi]mo Prencipe di Toscana,‚Äù which can be found in manuscript form in the National Central Library (Florence). The poem, written when she could not have been older than fifteen, is addressed to Christina of Lorraine on the birth of her son, Cosimo II de' Medici. She first published in 1592, with a second canzone to Lorraine on the occasion of Cosimo II's baptism. Her subject matter shifted in the middle of the 1590s, when she began to focus less on the familial milestones of the Medici family, and more on the political and religious upheavals of the period. This is evident in her canzoni dedicated to Henry IV of France and Pope Clement VIII in 1597, both of which celebrated the French king's conversion from Protestantism to Catholicism.Cox, Virginia. Lyric Poetry by Women of the Italian Renaissance. The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2013. Her most unusual publication, which was printed in 1598 by Giovanni Battista Bellagamba in Bologna, is Orazione della Signora Isabella Cervoni da Colle al santissimo, e beatissimo padre, e Signor Nostro, Papa Clemente Ottavo, Sopra l‚Äôimpresa di Ferrarra, con una canzone della medesima, a[‚Äò] Prencipi Cristiani. The 28-page piece, addressed to Pope Clement VIII, includes a lengthy oration praising the pope for his peaceful takeover of the city of Ferrara earlier that year, and a canzone that forcefully criticizes both Henry IV of France and Philip II of Spain for their continuous fighting. Cervoni finishes her poem with a call for the princes of Europe to put down their arms and form a league in support of Clement's ambitions to fight again the Ottoman Empire. Cervoni was also inducted into the prestigious Accademia degli Affidati in Pavia, most likely between 1598 and 1600‚Äîa rarity for women writers of any age in the period.Among the very few women to be invited to join the various literary academies of the period, the legendary Isabella Andreini was inducted into another Pavian academy, the more famous Accademia degli Intenti, at nearly the same time as Cervoni. For more on women and academies in the period, see Cox 2011, pp. 16-18 It is not known when Cervoni died; there is no information available on her after 1600.

Feminist aesthetics has a relationship to philosophy. The historical philosophical views of what beauty, the arts, and sensory experiences are, relate to the idea of aesthetics. Aesthetics looks at styles of production. In particular, feminists argue that despite seeming neutral or inclusive, the way people think about art and aesthetics is influenced by gender roles. Feminist aesthetics is a tool for analyzing how art is understood using gendered issues. A person's gender identity affects the ways in which they perceive art and aesthetics because of their subject position and the fact that perception is influenced by power. The ways in which people see art is also influenced by social values such as class and race. One's subject position in life changes the way art is perceived because of people's different knowledge's about life and experiences. In the way that feminist history unsettles traditional history, feminist aesthetics challenge philosophies of beauty, the arts and sensory experience. Starting in the 18th century, ideas of aesthetic pleasure have tried to define \\"taste\\". Kant and Hume both argued that there was universal good taste, which made aesthetic pleasure. A feminist line of logic about these attempts is that, because fine art was a leisure activity at this time, those who could afford to make art or produce supposed universal truths about how it is enjoyed would do so in a way that creates class and gender division. Even when those universal aesthetes did address gender, they categorized aesthetics into two categories: beauty and sublimity; with beauty being small and delicate (feminine) and sublimity being large and awe-inspiring (masculine). Feminist aesthetics analyzes why \\"feminine\\" traits are subservient compared to \\"masculine\\" traits in art and aesthetics. Another explanation for the male-domination of forming aesthetic theory is that feminists express their aesthetic pleasure differently than non-feminist aesthetes for \\"whom the pleasure of theorizing [...] is a form of jouissance\\". Instead, a feminist is less likely to view the object as a disinterested interpreter, and intellectualize the sensation (Hilde Hein). Morse discusses how art is a social institution. The influence of institutions comes from those who created the structure, which is mainly by men. From a spectator's point of view, men looking at women, compared to women looking at women, produces different social implications. When understanding a feminist perspective, Morse discusses the ideas of ‚Äúself-defined‚Äù and ‚Äúself-determined‚Äù art by women artists. Critics of feminist art argue that politics have no place in art, however, many art forms contain politics, but because of their subject position, the critics are unable to perceive it. The language used when talking about aesthetics in art is limited. The lexicon is limited because it doesn't include femme and women identifying language. The language that does exist separates them as ‚Äúfemale‚Äù artist. The examination of the need for there to be a separate field of feminist aesthetics is discussed. If there is a separate field, women's art gets defined as feminist, then it assumes that the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and all other art is automatically categorized as masculine. The idea of the creative genius is inspected in feminist aesthetics. In particular, women artists are often excluded from being creative or artistic geniuses. This exclusion in part stems from the traditional masculine definitions of genius. Christine Battersby has critiqued the fact that women are excluded from being known as geniuses because female artists will be separated from their art, and instead their art will be called genius, instead of the artist. However, women were also excluded because they lacked the opportunities for artistic education required to be recognized as artists and geniuses. In addition, the idea of the creative genius itself celebrates individualism ‚Äì which Battersby calls \\"a kind of masculine heroism\\" ‚Äì and overlooks the work of joint collaborations. Linda Nochlin, an art historian, understands that art history comes from a Western male point of view, which creates a dominant way of viewing art. Nochlin questions why there have been no women artists in art history and understands that this is due to the influence of Western males within the field of art. Aesthetic theories that make a distinction between \\"arts\\" and \\"crafts\\" can be viewed as anti-feminist. Here, art usually refers to fine art and crafts refers to everything else which has everyday aesthetics. Art forms traditionally used by women, such as embroidery or sewing, are perceived as crafts and not art, because of their domestic uses. Feminist aesthetics focuses on all objects created by women, whether or not they are seen as \\"art\\". Since those craft practices occur in the home where many women continue to work, their creativity is overlooked by the perception of \\"art\\", because their domain is marginalized. The Guerrilla Girls are a contemporary an activist group that focuses on how feminism plays a role in public art. Their relationship to feminist aesthetics is relevant because they expose gender and ethnic bias, as well as corruption in the art, film and pop culture worlds. The group draws attention to the idea that women are not equally valued in these areas and fight to improve gender equality. Another areas of study that is tied to feminist aesthetics is feminist art criticism. This area of study can focus on female body imagery, goddess imagery, personal narratives, and devaluation of \\"individual solitary genius.\\"  See also  * Feminist art criticism *Guerrilla Girls  References  Category:Aesthetics Category:Feminist theory Category:Feminism and the arts Category:Feminist philosophy ","title":"Feminist aesthetics"},{"id":"41812831","text":"Elizabeth Matheson (born 1942) is a prominent photographer in North Carolina.

Smith, the avant-garde filmmaker of Flaming Creatures and Normal Love, in which Grant appeared, called her \\"the queen of the underground ‚Äì both undergrounds.\\" Career A native of Detroit, Grant appeared in Jack Smith's controversial film Flaming Creatures (1963) and his second, unfinished feature film, Normal Love, which began shooting in 1963 as controversy over Flaming Creatures was beginning to erupt. Andy Warhol also appeared as one of the film's \\"Bathing Beauties,\\" who cavorted on a giant prop wedding cake constructed by Claus Oldenburg. In Normal Love, Grant played the role of the Cobra Woman in an erotic coupling with the Mummy, played by Tony Conrad.http://www.slantmagazine.com/dvd/review/treasures-iv-american-avant- garde-film-1947-1986 After the shoot, the two began an actual romantic engagement off the set, causing a falling-out with Smith, who saw it as a normative, heterosexual coupling out of sync with the ideal of a transgressive eroticism portrayed in his films. Among the Warhol films in which Grant appeared (with Smith) were his first full-length film, the unfinished Batman/Dracula, and three Screen Tests, one of which was widely shown as part of Warhol's compilation of screen tests with female subjects that was known as The 13 Most Beautiful Women. In one of the most frequently shown of the Screen Tests, Grant impersonated an anguished silent movie diva, pulling her long, black hair. Grant also appeared in Stephen Dwoskin's Naissant (1964), Ron Rice's Chumlum (1964), Gregory Markopoulos' The Illiac Passion (1967), and Ira Cohen's Invasion of the Thunderbolt Pagoda (1968). Grant, who studied under Stella Adler, also had a prolific although short career on the off-off- Broadway stage, with roles in LeRoi Jones's The Toilet (1964) and Ronald Tavel's Shower (1965), directed by John Vaccaro, as well as Vaccaro's Theatre of the Ridiculous production of Conquest of the Universe in 1967. Together, Grant and Conrad produced the feature-length film Coming Attractions (1970) with Warhol superstar Frances Francine, the purely abstract film Straight and Narrow (1970), and Four Square. Like Conrad's experimental film The Flicker (1965), Coming Attractions utilized a flicker-like strobe effect within the narrative. In 1972, Conrad and Grant toured Europe, meeting many underground filmmakers. Grant left New York in 1973 to move with Conrad to Yellow Springs, Ohio, where Conrad taught at Antioch College. During this time, she earned a master's degree from Wright State University, and performed in local theater. After she and Conrad divorced in 1976, Grant remained in Yellow Springs, raising the couple's son, Theodore. In her later years, Grant worked as a drug- and alcohol-abuse counsellor in London, Ohio, where she died of cancer at the age of 54 on July 4, 1990.

Her work is situated between sculpture and image and engages with post-conceptual photography and Minimalism. Her work examines the fluidity of the medium of photography and expands on what constitutes the viewing of a photograph. Deschenes has stated that she seeks to \\"enable the viewer to see the inconstancy of the conditions of display, which are always at play but sometimes hard to see.\\" Her practice is not bound to a single technology, method, process, or subject, but to the fundamental elements of photography, such as light, paper, chemistry, and time. She has taught at Bennington College and was a visiting artist at Columbia University's School of Visual Arts and Yale University. In 2019, she was the Wolf Chair in Photography at Cooper Union. She currently teaches at the School of Visual Arts, New York.  Early life and education  Deschenes was born in Boston, MA but grew up on the South Shore, a largely homogeneous and conservative town. As a child, she frequently encountered and was fascinated by the Boston Gas Tank (Rainbow Tank) by artist and activist Corita Kent, situated prominently on the waterfront of Dorchester, MA. In the mid-1980s, Deschenes enrolled at the Rhode Island School of Art and Design, intending to study painting or architecture but eventually changing her focus to photography. The pedagogical style of RISD at the time was very conservative and there were few female faculty members in the photography department. As a result, Deschenes sought other contexts for involvement with feminism, queer politics, AIDS activism, examining the power of representation within the medium of photography. Deschenes graduated from RISD in 1988. Deschenes worked in photography labs as a technician throughout her career as a young artist, becoming adept at chemical and analogue printing processes. In this capacity, she also worked extensively documenting the artwork of others, which influenced her notion of mediation and the conditions of production and display. In 1997, Deschenes presented Elevation #1-#7 (1997), a set of seven monochrome dye transfer prints whose colors correspond to those developed by cartographers to represent the range of earth's elevation. In the work, by utilizing the process of dye color transfer color printing, which was discontinued by Kodak in 1994, Deschenes investigates the technological changes in the medium. In 2001, influenced by her visit to the National Association of Broadcasters' convention in Las Vegas, Deschenes created her series Blue and Green Screens (2001-2002), which foregrounded the invisible backdrops used for special effects in film production. Work Deschenes explores the materials and properties of photography, light, and perception, often in relation to the architectural environments within which they are displayed. Curator and critic Matthew Witkovsky has written that Deschenes' work \\"pushes against the basic terms by which photography is conventionally defined: instantaneity, veracity, fixity, or reproducibility.\\" At the same time, Deschenes engages with the legacy of Minimalism, drawing attention to the techniques of the observer by deploying old photographic methods and techniques such as the photogram and the daguerreotype. Deschenes \\"calibrates her works to the site\\" in order to reveal the spectator's relationship to the space, whether by encouraging new visual encounters or responding to and disrupting the architectural space.  Major Works  In 2007, Deschenes presented her series of photographs titled Moir√© (2007) at Miguel Abreu Gallery's \\"Registration\\" exhibition. For the work, Deschenes photographed a sheet of perforated paper filtering the light coming through the window, and layered the negative with a duplicate in an enlarger to create an abstract image with illusions of movement. Moir√©s were paired with Red Transfer (1997), a diptych of monochromatic dye transfer prints with subtle differences in hue. The dye transfers' matrices alignment served as a counterpoint to the misregistration in the Moir√©s series. In an interview with Mousse Magazine in 2014, Deschenes noted that the Moires series sought to \\"confound\\" the limitations of making something \\"with a property largely outside of the confines of photography and expectations that are brought to looking at a photographic work.\\" Two years later, in 2009, Deschenes created Tilt / Swing (2009), an installation of six \\"silver mirror\\" panels arranged in a 360-degree floor-to-ceiling configuration. It was based on an unrealized exhibition design conceived by Herbert Bayer, a Bauhaus artist and architect, in The Fundamentals of Exhibition Design. While Bayer's schema sought to be \\"an inclusive picture of all [viewpoint] possibilities,\\" Deschenes' installation resulted in a fragmentation of the surrounding environment. Commenting on the title of the work, Matthew Witkovsky has written that the words tilt and swing evoke \\"abstract issues of viewpoint and manipulation, for example the ways in which the spectatorial subject is turned or focused in the controlled setting of a museum building.\\" At the same time, curator Eva Respini has remarked that in addition to the reference to Bayer, it is crucial to consider the influence of Conceptual and Performance Art in Tilt / Swing, as the work requires a physical \\"activation by the viewer.\\" In her 2012-2013 exhibition at the Secession in Vienna, Deschenes staged a new series of photograms, Stereographs 1-16 (2012). In the installation, Deschenes mimicked the illusion of spatiality in the stereoscopes by converting the gallery into a camera. Deschenes moved the gallery's entrance to a previously unused exterior side door, leading the viewers through a long hallway (the viewfinder) to two adjacent rooms (the stereograph). Each room contained four Stereographs of the same size. Johanna Burton stated that the Stereographs \\"must be seen not only as dilating context and insisting on spatial occupation but also as moving speculatively: developing.\\" In 2014, at the invitation of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, Deschenes created Gallery 7 (2014), a site-specific installation composed of three elements: eleven photographs in freestanding frames; three horizontal lines etched into the gallery walls; and the natural light from the floor-to-ceiling windows. The freestanding frames were located in the center of the space, relocating the viewing experience from the walls towards the windows. The exhibition was on view for a year, throughout which the light conditions changed and encouraged the oxidation of the light- sensitive photograms. The proportions of the photographs, furthermore, were based on those of an index card, in reference to Lucy Lippard's c. 7,500 exhibition of Conceptual art by women artists at the Walker Art Center in 1973. In 2018, Deschenes staged her Rates (Frames per Second) exhibition at Miguel Abreu Gallery. In the installation, Deschenes took the proto-cinematic experiments of √âtienne-Jules Marey as the point of departure and presented two series, FPS (Frames per Second) and FPF (Frames per Feet). FPS was cut and mounted directly on vertical strips of dibond, and FPF was pressed in thin, horizontal frames. Both series progressed with the rhythm of the viewer's footsteps, akin to the body's movement being captured by the camera in time. The Brooklyn Rail described the show as centering on not \\"the specific atmospheric or environmental conditions that produced each print,\\" but \\"how time is felt...and the specific weight that time can hold in space.\\"  Exhibitions  Deschenes has exhibited extensively in the United States and abroad, including solo shows at ICA/Boston (2016), MASS MoCA in North Adams, MA (2015), Walker Art Center in Minneapolis (2015), Campoli Presti in Paris Campoli Presti - Liz Deschenes - Bracket (Paris) http://www.campolipresti.com/exhibitions.html?exh=110&page;=images and London (2013),Campoli Presti - Liz Deschenes - Bracket (London) http://www.campolipresti.com/exhibitions.html?exh=107&page;=images Secession, Vienna (2012), Sutton Lane, Brussels (2010), and Miguel Abreu Gallery in New York (2009). Her first solo presentation at an American museum, \\"Liz Deschenes: Gallery 7\\" was on view at the Walker Art Center from November 2014 to October 2015 and curated by Eric Crosby. Deschenes' work has been included in numerous group exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art, Musee d'Art Moderne, the Centre Pompidou, and Extra City Kunsthal in Antwerp. Her work was also featured in \\"Sites of Reason: A Selection of Recent Acquisitions\\" at the Museum of Modern Art (2014), \\"What is a Photograph?\\" at the International Center of Photography in New York (2014), and \\"Cross Over. Photography of Science + Science of Photography\\" at Fotomuseum Winterthur, Switzerland (2013). Deschenes was also featured in the 2012 Whitney Biennial and \\"Parcours\\" (2012), a two-person exhibition at The Art Institute of Chicago that she co-curated with Florian Pumh√∂sl and Matthew Witkovsky.

Librarianship and Human Rights: a twenty-first century guide. Cambridge: Woodhead Publishing Limited. p. 69. . The organization has been active in First Amendment-based challenges to book removals from libraries, and in anti-surveillance work. In addition to its legal work, the FTRF engages in advocacy and public awareness, such as its sponsorship of the annual celebration of \\"Banned Books Week\\". History The FTRF was established in 1969 by members of the American Library Association, including Judith Krug, Alexander Allain.About the Freedom to Read Foundation (cited 26 May 2009) Based on the Freedom to Read Foundation Web site, the organization was founded as \\"the American Library Association's response to its members' interest in having adequate means to support and defend librarians whose positions are jeopardized because of their resistance to abridgments of the First Amendment; and to set legal precedent for the freedom to read on behalf of all people\\". The FTRF was set up in conjunction with the ALA's office of Intellectual Freedom instead of as a separate entity because of the work ALA was already doing to protect the First Amendment and intellectual freedom. When the Foundation was being planned for and organized, Allain expressed concern in a letter to the Director of the Intellectual Freedom Office, Judith Krug, that ALA members would forget what the ALA has done and continues to do for intellectual freedom by covering themselves in this new umbrella of aid and assistance in the FTRF.Allain, Alex P. Letter to Judith F. Krug. 7 October 1969. Allain felt that there should be overlap of both organizations so that the focus remained centered on intellectual freedom and could be worked on in harmony. Allain also felt that in forming the FTRF with the ALA, the Foundation would be able to benefit from some of the clout and connections that ALA already had. He also suggested keeping policies between the two organizations similar because of his belief in the good work that the ALA does; he was continuously concerned about the ALA in his creation of the foundation and did not want members to see the foundation as a replacement but rather an addition to. The organization's charter describes four purposes for the Foundation, including: > Promoting and protecting the freedom of speech and of the press; Protecting > the public's right of access to information and materials stored in the > nation's libraries; Safeguarding libraries' right to disseminate all > materials contained in their collections; and Supporting libraries and > librarians in their defense of First Amendment rights by supplying them with > legal counsel or the means to secure it.About the Freedom to Read > Foundation, FTRF website (last visited Feb. 1, 2014). The organization works through litigation, consumer education, and awarding grants to other individuals and entities working on similar projects.

She \\"drew upon vivid colors, symmetry, and anthropomorphic imagery, to create vibrant tapestries which depict stories, legends, and personal experiences.\\" Marion Tuu'luq Early life Tuu'luq was born in 1910 in the Chantrey Inlet/Back River area of the Northwest Territories (now Nunavut, north-west of Hudson Bay. In the 1960s, she was part of a semi-nomadic group of Inuit who, facing the threat of starvation, were forced to change their nomadic lifestyle and move to the settlement of Baker Lake. While she was relieved to escape hardship, she expressed sorrow at the loss of her nomadic lifestyle. Her personal history emerges in her work as she attends to the significance of land and family in contemporary Inuit life. Tuu'luq's \\"A Story of Starvation,\\" as told to Susan Tagoona, shares her experience growing up in the Arctic and her struggle for survival. She was married twice and had 16 children, four of whom outlived her. Her second husband, the celebrated Baker Lake artist Luke Anguhadluq died in 1982. Work Tuu'luq used embroidery thread, felt, and dense woollen fabrics. She was a part of a circle of northern fabric artists (including Jessie Oonark and Irene Avaalaaqiaq Tiktaalaaq) who helped establish the contemporary art form of large-scale, two-dimensional, embroidered textile works. Tuu‚Äôluq‚Äôs works have been displayed nationally and internationally and collected by numerous private collectors and public institutions, including the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Edmonton Art Gallery, the London Public Library, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, the Thunder Bay Art Gallery, Vancouver Art Gallery, Artexte Information Gallery, Canadian Women Artists History Initiative Documentation Centre, University of Manitoba Architecture and Fine Arts Library, the University of Saskatchewan Archives, the Winnipeg Art Gallery as well as the National Gallery of Canada.

Bobsled and coaching career Burkart was approached by Swiss bobsledder Christian Meili and sprinter-turned-bobsledder Ren√© Mangold in 1995 and they urged him to try out the winter sport. He competed in the Swiss team in 4-man bobsleigh at the Bobsleigh European Championship and Bobsleigh World Cup from 1998 to 2002. Burkart soon began to focus on training younger bobsledders and athletes in the late 1990s with Fredi Steinmann. Among his training group were Olympic bobsleigh bronze medallists Thomas Lamparter and Martin Annen, as well as skeleton specialist and Olympic medallist Gregor St√§hli. Burkart also coached Daniel Dubois and Andreas Baumann, both of whom represented Switzerland in the indoor 60 m sprint which had been Burkart's speciality.

He was an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of California for twelve years and earlier served in the member of the Wisconsin State Senate and Wisconsin State Assembly. Biography Sharpstein was born on May 3 or May 23, 1823 in Richmond, New York. In 1847, he moved to Sheboygan County, Wisconsin. Sharpstein was a member of the Wisconsin State Senate from 1852 to 1853, representing the 16th district in 1852 and the 8th district in 1853. He was a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1863. Previously, he had been District Attorney of Sheboygan County and of Kenosha County, Wisconsin. From 1853 to 1857, he was U.S Attorney of Wisconsin. In 1854, he represented the government in the fugitive slave cases, Ableman v. Booth and United States v. Booth (18 How. 476, 21 How. 506), appealing up to the Supreme Court of the United States, where Chief Justice Roger Taney wrote the unanimous opinion. In April 1857, Sharpstein became Postmaster of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and then was a delegate to the 1860 Democratic National Convention. In 1864, Sharpstein moved to California, was admitted to the bar in January 1865, and practiced law. In 1872, he published a book on insurance law. In January 1874, Governor Newton Booth appointed Sharpstein a judge of the Twelfth District Court in California, replacing Elisha W. McKinstry. In October 1875, he ran for election on the Republican ticket but lost the election to the district court to William E. Daingerfield. In July 1878, Sharpstein was nominated by the Workingmen's Party and elected as a member of the Constitutional Convention from the First Congressional District. In October 1879, when adoption of a new constitution required elections for all Supreme Court seats, Sharpstein was nominated by Democratic and Workingmen's parties and won a position as Associate Justice. When the term began January 5, 1880, the justices drew lots to determine their length of term, and he and Erskine M. Ross both drew three-year terms. In November 1882, both Ross and Sharpstein were re-elected on the Democratic ticket to 12-year terms. Among Sharpstein's notable opinions is Tape v. Hurley, 66 Cal. 473 (1885), holding the City of San Francisco excluding a Chinese child from public school violated the California Constitution. In July 1886, former Chief Justice David S. Terry filed a petition which unsuccessfully sought the removal of both Chief Justice Robert F. Morrison and Sharpstein on the basis of incompetence due to age. Sharpstein remained a member of the court until his death on December 28, 1892. Civic activities In 1878, Sharpstein was a member of the first board of trustees of Hastings College of the Law. Personal life On November 17, 1845, Sharpstein married Catherine C. Crittenden in Macomb, Michigan. They had two daughters, who both died young in Michigan, and two sons, Jay Pitt Sharpstein, who lived in Berkeley, and William Crittenden Sharpstein, who graduated from Hastings College of Law and became an attorney.

In his memoirs, Legislating the Holocaust, L√∂sener described his discovery of an incident where approximately 1,000 recently deported German Jews were transported by train to Rumbula Forest in Riga, Latvia and there summarily executed along with 25,000 Latvian Jews. L√∂sener wrote he had not been aware of any orders to execute the German Jews and was disturbed by the executions. He discussed the incident with Stuckart which caused tension between them. Three years later in 1944, according to L√∂sener's Reich Ministry records, he was arrested for expressing sympathy for the German Jews.The Reich Ministry of the Interior and the Jewish Code.

He successfully argued that classifying such persons as Jewish would strengthen the Jewish gene pool by infusing Aryan blood, as well as cost the Army 45,000 soldiers. Since most mischling were not deported during the war, the classification may have saved up to 107,000 Germans of some Jewish ancestry from the Holocaust.Nelson, Robert, \\"Revolution and Genocide, University of Chicago Press, 1992, p 324 At the Nuremberg Trials, L√∂sener gave testimony about the discussion he had had with Stuckart regarding the Rumbula massacre in 1941.

Since 2007, she has advised MFA students at the School of the Art Institute and continues to work in Chicago. Art work Bramson has worked in painting, drawing, collage and assemblage. Her approach, influences and themes, however, have remained relatively consistent. She works intuitively, without plans or sketches, an organic process she describes as \\"wayward\\" and \\"free fall.\\"Les Femmes Folles. Interview: Phyllis Bramson, Artist, Les Femmes Folles, 2015. Retrieved May 15, 2018. \\"My studio is a place for bricolage. It's roiling with stuff in bins, on shelves, on the floor. The putting together of this stuff is basically is a mystery to me,\\" she has said. Her work can be divided into three main bodies: sculptural and mixed media work (1970s); mixed-media paintings and bas reliefs (1980‚Äì ); and three- dimensional works (2006‚Äì ). Influences Bramson assimilates eccentric, diverse social and visual influences. She acknowledges the pull of 1950s conventions of duty, sacrifice and propriety, describing herself as a kind of tourist or voyeur \\"teetering\\" between the worlds of her free-spirited, \\"anything goes\\" studio life and straight, married suburban life.Westerbeck, Colin. \\"Phyllis Bramson,\\" Artforum, Summer 1986, p. 131. Those dichotomies inform the paradoxes noted in her work: sweetness and salaciousness, modesty and exhibitionism, kitsch and art, East and West, disappointment and hope, longing and pleasure. Aesthetically, she draws from richly visual, wide- ranging sources. Her attraction to pattern, beauty and sensuality was formed by youthful experiences in her home of Chinoiserie (the Western decorative imitation of East Asian artistic traditions), kitsch objects, and 1950s girlie magazines and calendars. Later inspirations range from Rococo art to the outsider paintings of Henry Darger to the historical tradition of Persian miniatures and pleasure gardens. Bramson relates strongly to what she calls Chicago's \\"history of independent artmaking.\\" Both she and critics have noted her shared interest in expressive figuration and theatrical spaces with the city's \\"Monster Roster\\" artists of the 1950s, such as Robert Barnes, Ellen Lanyon and Irving Petlin (sometimes called \\"Magic Realists\\"), Seymour Rosofsky, and June Leaf.Adrian, Dennis. \\"Phyllis Bramson: 1973‚Äì1986,\\" Phyllis Bramson: 1973‚Äì1986, Chicago: The Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago.Kind.

Critics also note similarities to the more well-known Chicago Imagists, in her work's immediacy, vernacular references and unnerving poetics, but generally conclude that it differs in its more personal, lyrical, dream-like and inward orientation.Frueh, Joanna, \\"Recent oils show Phyllis Bramson at technical and emotional peak,\\" St. Louis Dispatch, July 26, 1987, p. 4C.Frueh, Joanna, \\"The personal imperative: post-Imagist art in Chicago,\\" New Art Examiner, October 1978, p. 4‚Äì5.

I don't take too many liberties.\\" Phyllis Bramson, Shipwrecked, oil on canvas, 72\\" x 96\\", 1987. Themes According to the late critic James Yood, \\"Bramson has pursued what seems an inexhaustible exploration of the inexhaustible wonder of human coupling, its forms, its rituals, its absurdities, its essential and revelatory nature, sometimes its wistfulness and hints of melancholy.\\"Yood, James. \\"Phyllis Bramson and the Neo-Rococo,\\" Phyllis Bramson, Under the Pleasure Dome: A Survey, Exhibition catalogue, Chicago: Chicago Cultural Center, 2016. p. 2‚Äì3. Retrieved May 16, 2018. While Bramson has remained remarkably consistent in her exploration of romantic love, her work‚Äîonce described as \\"a riddle disguised as a love-letter\\"‚Äîleaves plenty of room for interpretation. Writer Joanna Frueh places Bramson in the \\"romantic Individualist\\" tradition of intense feeling, love-longing, alienation and morality, and considers artmaking and sex‚Äîincluding \\"the voluptuousness, risks, temptations and delights attendant on both themes\\"‚Äîas the implicit, twin subjects of her work. Dennis Adrian suggested that painting was a place for Bramson to explore states of feeling, dreams and fantasies that were otherwise risky, impossible, unacceptable or undesirable. Bramson seems to agree: \\"To me, making art is a difficult, intense activity where I can do a lot of things I wouldn't do out in the world. It's an area where I can function on a dangerous and erotic level. I'm sort of watching myself do it.\\"Associated American Artists. Interview with Phyllis Bramson, \\"Objects/Symbol\\" Exhibition catalogue, New York: Associated American Artists, 1996. Lynne Warren suggests that while her work looks nostalgically to a time in which longing and desire were satisfied in a slow, tension-filled unfolding, it also contains social commentary and political critique \\"that fully inhabit today's reality.\\" While Bramson has generally been uncomfortable with strict feminist readings of her work, considering them too confining, writers have identified challenges to the power dynamics of relationships and societal structure in her work.Miller, Chris, \\"Painting the Yearning of the Heart: A Review of Phyllis Bramson at the Cultural Center,\\" New City, August 1, 2016. Retrieved May 15, 2018. Artforum's Colin Westerbeck wrote that Bramson's straddling of her private, domestic life and public, artistic one provided insights into the balancing acts required of women that are reflected in her contorted figures acting out exaggerated roles and accommodations to traditional expectations. Art historian Lisa Wainwright suggests these insights are also embedded in her strategy of collage, which parallels the way women construct their lives out of many masks, roles and identities. In her essay, \\"Feminine Wiles: Modern Art's Fear of the Female,\\" New Art Examiner editor Kathryn Hixson highlighted Bramson's unapologetic reassertion of the emotional and physical power of the feminine in the face of the fear that the article discusses.Hixson, Kathryn. \\"Feminine Wiles: Modern Art's Fear of the Female,\\" New Art Examiner, Feb. 1997, p. 21 - 24, 56. Mixed media work (1970s) Bramson has described herself as \\"an archetypal 1970s art-school graduate,\\" who abandoned painting in the commonly held belief that it was a \\"dead\\" medium. She explored ceramic, pastel, objects, fans, beads, sequins, glitter and fabric, fashioning doll-like, sculptural portraits, mixed media drawings, and assemblages that some suggest were influenced by her window display work at Marshall Field's.Zimmer, William. \\"New Wavering,\\" SoHo Weekly News, Sept. 15, 1979. Joanna Frueh observed that Bramson's use of feminine paraphernalia interwove \\"passion, conflict, and eroticism,\\" heatedly spinning her own self-emergence as well as the concurrent cultural emergence of women. Critics see in this early work a steady, if circuitous, search for her style through successive (and ultimately successful) experiments. Dennis Adrian later wrote that while this work never fully resolved the balance between its emblematic, fetishistic quality and three-dimensional \\"object-ness,\\" it clarified Bramson's artistic persona and afforded her an \\"impressive freedom\\" she would use to powerful, unified effect in her mature work. Phyllis Bramson, Picturing a Model World, mixed media and collage on canvas, 50\\" x 72\\", 2003. Paintings and bas reliefs (1980‚Äì ) In 1980, Bramson returned to painting, inspired by an influential exhibition of Phillip Guston's figurative work. Critics identify several formal qualities that define Bramson's mature painting. One is her absorption of the painterly lessons of Abstract Expressionism, which dates to her earliest training. She combines those effects with a decorative impulse using lively patterning, which connects and unifies disparate compositional elements, and creates the \\"rhythmic dynamism,\\"Yood, James. \\"Locations of Desire,\\" Exhibition catalogue, State of Illinois Museum, 1990, p. 9‚Äì11 musicality, and frenetic energy in her paintings.Hollo, Anselm. \\"Phyllis Bramson,\\" Phyllis Bramson: When the Body Speaks Its Mind, Exhibition catalogue, Boulder, CO: Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art, 2004. Another unifying factor is her notably high-keyed color palette, described variously as: hot, steamy, lush and raucous, brash, and vibrantly acidic.Donato, Deborah. \\"Phyllis Bramson/Vicissitude at Dart Gallery,\\" Dialogue, May‚ÄìJune 1992, p. 19.Condon, Elizabeth. \\"Phyllis Bramson at Dart Gallery,\\" New Art Examiner, May 1992, p. 30. Bramson holds her generally packed, topsy-turvy scenes together with what has been described as an \\"astute sense of composition.\\"Berlind, Robert. \\"Phyllis Bramson at Littlejohn Contemporary,\\" Art in America, May 2001, p. 176. Finally, critics note her Surrealist sense of juxtaposition and spatial ambiguity, including a freewheeling approach to reality where abstract and figurative are often interchangeable, creating a context of danger, disorientation and flux. Bramson's early paintings often borrowed strategies from Japanese woodcut design, breaking compositions into rectilinear sections or diptychs, but in signature works like The Dance (1985) and Shipwrecked (1987), she began tackling larger-scale, panoramic compositions with deep landscape spaces. Within them, she would orchestrate a growing personal iconography, both familiar and bizarre: performer-exhibitionists, flamboyant costumes and accoutrements, theatrical objects (masks, globes, vases, swords, pillars) and exotic settings. Her dreamlike, emotionally charged vignettes implied archetypal, yet open-ended, relational scenarios, with contorted figures clinging to masts, bending over backwards, or paddling as waves swirled around sinking boats.Saliga, Pauline. \\"Chicago/Chicago,\\" Exhibition catalogue, Cincinnati, OH: Contemporary Art Center, 1980, p. 6. While some critics wondered if the work contained too much, others praised it for just that quality, seeing in it \\"the richness and the adventure of living at the peak of desire.\\" Bramson worked in a more postmodern fashion in the 1990s, employing collage, appropriation, Rococo pictorial strategies and kitsch elements to a greater degree, and adding more social and cultural commentary to her work. She combined her own paintings with found fabric, bric-a-brac, lace, decorative moulding, and cut-up elements such as fruits, flowers and jewels from mass-produced shopping-mall paintings,Edelman, Robert. \\"The Figure Returns,\\" Art in America, March 1994, p. 39‚Äì43.McWilliams, Martha. \\"Phyllis Bramson: Transgressions,\\" Washington City Paper, Nov. 26, 1993, p. 42. balancing an enigmatic lexicon of collected and invented signs, stylistic and tonal shifts, and far-flung cultural references in increasingly complex, Bosch-like compositions, such as Picturing a Model World (2003).Bloom, Ken. \\"Introduction,\\" Phyllis Bramson: When the Body Speaks Its Mind, Exhibition catalogue, Boulder, CO: Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art, 2004.Silverman, Lanny, \\"Floating Worlds: The Art of Phyllis Bramson,\\" One Thousand Secret and Scattered Yearnings: Phyllis Bramson, Exhibition catalogue, Boulder, CO: Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art, 2004. Phyllis Bramson, Little Goody Two Shoes, mixed media on canvas, 49\\" x 64\\", 1996. In works like Little Goody Two Shoes (1996), Bramson fractured and exploded the rectangular format with piled up, supplemental framed paintings and objects. Observing the myriad symbols of female sexuality‚Äîall out of reach of the male presences‚Äîcritics suggested these densely-layered works created new types of pictorial space with their own internal logic beyond what seemed apparent.Hixson, Kathryn. \\"Phyllis Bramson,\\" New Art Examiner, Dec.‚ÄìJan. 1996‚Äì7, p. 32. In these new configurations, Bramson re-coded banal or sweet imagery through juxtaposition and association in order to express, variously, female physicality, sensuous pleasure, a reclaiming of kitsch, and a sense of cultural apprehension.

Three-dimensional works (2006‚Äì ) In the 2000s, Bramson increasingly realized the object-based qualities of her earlier bas relief paintings. These more sculptural works incorporate assemblage and arrangements of found objects, with shelves and other elements projected off of walls, as in her \\"scroll works\\" first begun in 2006 (e.g., A Glimpse of Paradise, 2015). In the scroll pieces, she combines characteristic romantic imagery and allusions‚Äîpainted on long, flowing sectioned sheets‚Äîwith souvenir-like objects that suggest desires and memories assigned to and re-packaged into icons. Together, the visual elements imply the unfolding and revealing of fantasies and histories of the eclectic cast of characters Bramson has borrowed from kitsch and other cultural sources.Warren, Lynne. \\"Phyllis Bramson and the Aesthetic Gladness of Fulsome Desire,\\" I Tremble for You: Phyllis Bramson, Mesaros Galleries, West Virginia University, Morgantown, West Virginia, 2009.

Her best-known photographic work was published in 2002 under the title Ricas y Famosas, which is a photographic series portraying upper-class Mexican women, many whom had connections to the PRI Institutional Revolutionary Party.  Life  Rossell was born into the elite class she would later photograph. She is the granddaughter of two former Mexican governors. Her mother was an art collector, and Rossell was raised with an appreciation for fine art. She was educated at the American School Foundation, an exclusive and academically rigorous prep school in Mexico City. There, she developed an interest in theatre and began acting at age sixteen. She studied acting at the N√∫cleo de Estudios Teatrales. She then briefly studied painting at the National School of Visual Arts, but left to pursue a career in photography. Rossell currently lives and works in Mexico City and shows throughout Latin America, Europe and the United States.  Art  The photographic series Daniela Rossell is best known for is Ricas y Famosas (Rich and Famous), which spanned over the years 1994-2001 and was published as a book in 2009 (Oceano De Mexico, The first models for these photographs were the friends and family of the artist, who were Mexican elite, and then began to spread to other elite women who volunteered to model. Each model chooses how to depict their identity surrounded by their lavish material items and selling sex appeal in their poses. Rossell believes that her models are influenced by magazines and television shows in how they should perform in front of the camera because they want to look American. This quest to look American requires these models to modify their lifestyle and manipulation of identity that is a form of unhappiness. Despite having materialistically everything, these women struggle to find satisfaction in who they are because of the fantasy portrayed of America. When looking at the photographs is the large amounts of art and non- Christian icons mixed with Christian art found in these lavish homes. For example, one woman is posed lying seductively across a massive sized Buddha surrounded by champagne and money. The juxtaposition between sacred object and sexual attraction makes for a conflicting yet entertaining subject. One of the themes of the series is femininity and the role of women. The artist describes the home as the territory of the women, and by taking pictures of women within their own homes we are granted a glimpse into this constructed world. For example, one of the subjects surrounds herself with self-portraits and includes her personal waiter in the scene, putting on display that this is a space dedicated to her. In these highly cluttered environments the female models blend in with the lavish objects and Rossell uses this composition to reemphasize the objectifying of women in photographs. Often seen in fashion and commercial advertising campaigns the women photographed become synonymous with the object being sold. Another theme that is found in the series is Mexican history and identity. Rather than depicting the romanticized views of the Mexican villages or the harsh images of the urban poor, Rossell depicts the wealthy minority. Rossell herself is a part of this demographic and in turn this is the Mexican history she relates to. Also, the elite lives of her subjects were unknown to the rest of Mexico, her photographs also serve as social and political documents. After the release of her book Ricas y Famosas, the people who originally had been eager to model were angry with the artist. The public praised Rossell for her cinematic eye and ability to create provocative photos showing that flashy lifestyles are visible in all cultures. Criticism In writing about Rossell's portraits of the Mexican elite, Slate Magazine observed: > The narrative of Mexico as our impoverished and drug cartel‚Äìridden neighbor > dominates most news coverage in America, but that‚Äôs only one part of a large > and diverse country. Photographer Daniela Rossell brings us tales of the > polar opposite segment of Mexican society with her series Ricas y Famosas, > which depicts the children of Mexico‚Äôs most privileged class of society. In discussing the same series of photographs, The New York Times wrote: > Ricas y Famosas, a book of 89 photographs, is not an exercise in kitsch > fantasy. Part Town and Country, part Playboy, the book exposes the decadent, > some say depraved, lifestyles of Mexico's wealthy elite -- or, as the title > would have it, the rich and famous.

Structure The GALAS consisted of an \\"invitational\\" event, a curated exhibition of the work of ten selected artists, and many \\"regional\\" or \\"sister\\" exhibitions in multiple cities across the United States. These locations included New York City, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, Bozeman, Winter Park, Lawrence, Alexandria, and Anchorage among \\"over 200 shows and events.\\" According to Margo Hobbs Thompson, the art displayed constituted \\"a critique of contemporary gender norms.\\" It was described by Terry Wolverton, one of the organizers, as \\"a year-long project to bring national recognition to lesbian art and artists.\\" All of the invited artists lived in either Los Angeles or New York.

Reactions Tyaga, one of the event curators, was quoted by the Los Angeles Times while the exhibition was running as saying: \\"Just having the name 'Great American Lesbian Art Show' says a lot. It helps overcome fear. Art is non- threatening--it hangs on the wall and people look.

Academic Sue Ellen Case says \\"their work has defined the issues and terms of academic writing on lesbian theater, butch- femme role playing, feminist mimesis, and the spectacle of desire\\".Split Britches: Lesbian Practice/Feminist Performance, edited by Sue-Ellen Case, Routledge, 1997. In New York City Split Britches have long standing relationships with La Mama Experimental Theatre Company, where they are a resident company, Wow Caf√©, which Weaver and Shaw co-founded, and Dixon Place. Founding  Split Britches was founded by Peggy Shaw, Lois Weaver, and Deb Margolin in New York City in 1980. Shaw and Weaver met in Europe when Weaver was touring with Spiderwoman Theater and Shaw with Hot Peaches. The company started while Weaver and Shaw were performing in Spiderwoman Theatre's performance of \\"An Evening of Disgusting Songs and Pukey Images‚Äù. This was the first time Spiderwoman had presented lesbian content and introduced Peggy as a Spiderwoman performer. During this time in the summer of 1980, Weaver began to write a performance about her 2 aunts and great aunt in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia called Split Britches, The True Story. Split britches is a reference to the type of pants women wore while working in the fields, which allowed them to urinate without stopping work. The name of the company has been said to mimic the ‚Äúsplit pants‚Äù of poverty and comedy. The performance was originally developed with Spiderwoman performers and was performed at the first WOW (Women's One World) Festival, founded by Shaw and Weaver, in 1980. Following a subsequent run of the performance in 1981, Weaver and Shaw decided to leave Spiderwoman, and one of the Spiderwoman performers they had been working with declined to continue with them. This led them to ask Margolin, who was a writer, to assist with writing the script, and Margolin became a part of the company for many years. The final version of Split Britches was performed at the Boston Women‚Äôs Festival in Spring of 1981 and at the Second WOW festival in Fall of 1981. The script was first published in Women & Performance, and premiered on public television in 1988, directed and produced by Mathew Geller in association with WGBH/WNET Television and the NYFA ‚ÄòArtists New Works Program'. Early on in the company determined they would not spend time trying to apply for grants to support their performances, and would instead work outside of these systems using their own finances from jobs to support their performance work. This is due to a belief stated by Shaw that, \\"it's easier to get a job than a grant\\". This held true for the beginning of the company's existence, but as they became more established they began to apply for grants.  Members  Peggy Shaw (b. 1946) is a theatre artist whose work combines butch identity and dry humor. Her most recent solo show, RUFF (2012), relates her experience having a stroke. The performance was directed by Lois Weaver and toured internationally. Lois Weaver is a performing artist whose work is recognized as seminal in creating a template for lesbian performance methodologies. Her recent solo work has centered around the persona Tammy WhyNot, a 'former famous country-western singer turned lesbian performance artist'. Weaver is Professor of Contemporary Performance in the Department of Drama, Queen Mary, University of London. Weaver most often acts as the director for Split Britches. Deb Margolin, no longer a member of Split Britches, is a renowned performance artist, currently a professor at Yale University. She was primarily the wordsmith of the troupe, known for transforming visions into the final script. Margolin worked with Split Britches on Split Britches (1981), Beauty and the Beast (1982), Upwardly Mobile Home (1984), Little Women (1988), and Lesbians Who Kill (1992). The company engaged in a number of collaborations, including working with Isabel Miller and Holly Hughes to create Dress Suits to Hire (1987), with the Bloolips in Belle Reprieve (1991) and with James Neale-Kennerley in Lust and Comfort (1995). Impact and Significance Split Britches has worked with concepts of lesbian, queer, dyke, butch and femme identities and cultures in a context of American feminism and live arts movements which emerged through the 1970s. In Split Britches: Lesbian Practice/Feminist Performance, critic and theorist Sue-Ellen Case aptly sums up the importance of the trio in the development of contemporary lesbian performance: \\"the troupe created a unique 'postmodern' style that served to embed feminist and lesbian issues of the times, economic debates, national agendas, personal relationships, and sex- radical role playing in spectacular and humorous deconstructions of canonical texts, vaudeville shtick, cabaret forms, lip-synching satire, lyrical love scenes, and dark, frightening explorations of class and gender violence.\\" The troupe uses these performances to create a safe space in which non-normative sexualities and genders can occur in peace,Shoemaker, Deanna Beth. \\"Queers, monsters, drag queens, and whiteness: unruly femininities in women's staged performances.\\" (2004). and it is praised for having maintained a theatre space for women's artistic endeavors. Geraldine Harris has placed the work of the troupe in a \\"postmodern Brechtian tradition\\", and in an article on this troupe, describes the focus in their work on borders, as they often take on ideas of duality. With concepts of butch/femme highlighted in their work, as are concepts around class, classism, and oppression. Harris also explains that the troupe opposes the gender binary as a mode of political performance. Split Britches also examines the fetishization, objectification, and narcissistic misidentifications that cannot be separated from love, passion, and desire. The shows are often praised for the deconstructive and transformative lenses through which they are written. Split Britches' work comes from a tradition of performance art that is documented academically by the field of performance studies. Their work is cited as indicative of lesbian art which brings up issues of subjectivity.Davis, Gill \\"Goodnight Ladies: on the Explicit Body in Performance\\", New Theatre Quarterly, XV, No.58 (1999), p.187. It has been central to the development of feminist performance theory and distinguishing lesbian critical theory, for example in the pioneering work of Jill Dolan on the feminist spectator, Sue-Ellen Case on butch/femme aesthetics and Alisa Solomon and Kate Davy on feminist performance contexts.  Methodology  In a dissertation by Deanna Beth Shoemaker, Split Britches was said to use games, fantasies, songs, dance numbers, and monologues to addresses issues including female desire, power, and lesbian identity. The characters in the performances play on gender and sexuality binaries, and explore issues of lesbian femme identity within and without the butch/femme dynamic. The company begin by exploring a personal obsession or frustration, like Tennessee Williams or Aileen Wuornos, which is often take from popular culture. Shaw has said this is because through popular images they are able to maintain a queer aesthetic while keeping an audience engaged. Weaver and Shaw always try to make reference to a comedy duo from the 1950s or 1960s, which is often Mike Nicols and Elaine May, due to their comedic structure and gender dynamics. Next the company make lists, including a list of things they want to do on stage, current social issues, cultural icons, and stories they want to tell. They then choose characters that are split between good qualities and bad qualities, which Weaver has said is \\"like loving a part of yourself and your past\\". Despite playing characters, Weaver and Shaw say they always play themselves, including personal stories and anecdotes. Weaver has said \\"In the process of making personal performance, lying is always an option and creating truth is the goal.\\" Next they begin collecting found objects, and working on music to incorporate. Finally the company begin rehearsals, weaving together the disparate fragments. Throughout their history Weaver has functioned as the primary director. In recent years, public engagement and dialogue with the public have become an integral part to the Split Britches creative process. This takes the form of workshops and public conversations, often moderated through formats from Weaver's Public Address Systems project.  Public Engagement  From 2002-2003 Weaver and Shaw designed and ran workshops in four women's prisons in Brazil and the UK as part of the project 'Staging Human Rights', initiated by People's Palace Projects. The workshops intended to use performance to talk about human rights with female prisoners.  Controversies  At the time Split Britches was formed, cross-dressing and drag were popular, so this has become a central part of some of their performances. Some of the performances by the troupe have come under fire for the portrayal of certain characters. Specifically, the coproduction of Belle Reprieve by Split Britches and Bloolips, a group of gay drag performers. In this performance, gender norms are erased, and the binary is played upon. This performance has been critiqued due to the female actors dressing as men. Because most instances of cross-dressing are males dressing up ultra-feminine, this performance was unusual. It was said that this type of performance further holds men to be superior to women. Additionally, it has been criticized that cross-dressing reinforces the gender binary, which so many feminists have worked to eliminate.

Palace facade. The Renaissance palace, whose design, for many years was attributed to Raphael, was almost certainly not his direct hand, but a design from one of his pupils, perhaps Lorenzo Lotti, called \\"il Lorenzetto\\". Built between 1515 and 1536 for Bernardino Caffarelli. From there, it became property of Cardinal Stopponi. In the 18th century, the building became property of cardinal Vidoni, who enlarged the building. In the early twentieth century it housed the German embassy, now it houses the Ministry of Public Functions. The building design harkens to a classic Renaissance design likely developed by Bramante in his design for the now destroyed Palazzo Caprini, the home of Raphael. The home has successive layers where the degree of facade decoration matches the function of the interiors. The ground floor is rustic stone, almost fortress-like. The second floor, the piano nobile, is decorated with doric columns. The Palazzo Vidoni-Caffarelli conserves 16th-century frescoes in its Charles V hall that depict events in the life of the emperor. The author is unknown, but described as belonging to the Mannerist school of Perin del Vaga. The palace also contains some 18th- century frescoes attributed to Nicola Lapiccola, Bernardino Nocchi, Tommaso Conca, Ludovico Mazzanti. The interior has some Roman statues, including a statue of emperor Lucio Aurelio Vero, and a fountain derived from a Roman sarcofagus. It also contains a marble portal decoration of the Venetian lion of St Mark from a Croatian city.Official website References Category:Houses completed in 1536 Category:Renaissance architecture in Rome Category:Palaces in Rome Category:Rome R.

It was operating E-2A Hawkeye early warning aircraft as part of Carrier Air Wing Eleven on board USS Kitty Hawk, protecting U.S. naval and air forces that were striking targets in Vietnam. During the war, the squadron made three more war zone deployments before joining Carrier Air Wing Fifteen aboard USS Coral Sea. By 1976, it had moved to NAS Miramar. In 1978, it rejoined the USS Kitty Hawk in the Arabian Sea in response to the Iran hostage crisis. In 1982, it joined the USS Carl Vinson, making six deployments by 1990. It then made five deployments to the Northern and Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean. In 1988, it supported Operation Earnest Will, escorting oil tankers during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. In 1990 and 1991, VAW-114 upgraded to the E-2C+ version of the Hawkeye and made two drug-interdiction deployments to Howard Air Force Base in Panama. In 1992, VAW-114 was assigned to CVW-15 and accompanied the USS Kitty Hawk for its around the horn deployment from NS Norfolk to NAS North Island. VAW-114 participated in RIMPAC in 1992.

In 1969, she moved to New York City to enroll in drafting courses and concurrently work as an art editor at a publishing company. As an editor, she managed the inclusion of African-American images in textbooks, \\"...a position she has described as 'demeaning.\\" Jenkins married writer Peter Hassinger and returned to Los Angeles with her husband in 1970. She subsequently her earned a Master of Fine Arts in fiber from UCLA in 1973.  Career and influences  During Hassinger's years at Bennington College, the institution was an all-women's college with mostly men serving as instructors, many of whom had New York gallery affiliations. Hassinger believed the institutional connections and affiliations of the instructors were distant from the experiences of many students, and she rejected the formal strategies that were being taught. In an essay on Hassinger's practice, Maureen Megerian wrote: > \\". . . Clement Greenberg's formalist approach dominated the art department, > so instructors focused on the creation of abstract, Constructivist-inspired > welded steel sculpture. Minimalism, then predominant in the New York art > world, presented another model of formulaic, abstract art for students to > follow. [Hassinger] ultimately rejected such strict formal strategies, > although the discipline of these methods, especially such Minimalist devices > as repetition and regular arrangement, provides her work with a rational > underpinning that she consciously complicates and makes more emotionally > engaging.\\" Maren Hassinger started her artistic experimentation in a Los Angeles junkyard in the early 1970s, where she came across bulks of industrial wire rope. She found that the material could be used sculpturally and as a fiber that could be manipulated to resemble plant life. It was during this period in the 1970s that Hassinger began to collaborate with the sculptor Senga Nengudi. Incorporating both sculptural and performance work, their collaborative sculptures have been considered ahead of their time due to their process of \\"combin[ing] sculpture, dance, theater, music and more with the collaborative spirit of community meetings and the avant-garde brio of Allan Kaprow's happenings.\\" Additionally, Hassinger utilizes movements of everyday life in her dance. While few of their works from the 1970s remain, Hassinger and Nengudi continue to collaborate, with Hassinger activating Nengudi's sculpture R.S.V.P.X as recently as 2014. Southern fiction writer Walker Percy continued to influence her childhood connection between the natural and the manufactured world with his work, Wreath. Many of Percy's novels, which Hassinger was reading at the time, are about navigating a modern world that was becoming removed from nature. Another influence who struck her was the sculpture work of Eva Hesse. During an exhibition at the Pasadena Art Museum in 1973 Hassinger was introduced to Hesse's work and admired her obsessive exploration of forms and techniques, and ability to convey emotion through fiber methods. Hassinger recalled: > \\"It was as if I was looking at somebody's spirit made manifest. . . it was > an absolute gut level, wrenching experience. . . as if the sculpture were > made flesh. . . later when I began to read about [Eva Hesse], it was as if > she had managed somehow to put all the emotional truth of her life into that > piece, and it communicated that way. . . It was a total true expression of > life.\\" Through moving videos, Hassinger has explored personal family interactions and her own family history to tackle themes of identity. Her daughter, Ava Hassinger, is also an artist. The two have produced a video in which they perform improvisational choreography together under the title \\"Matriarch.\\" Hassinger's work has been described as \\"ecological,\\" but Hassinger herself does not see her work as such. Rather, she aims to produce humanistic statements about society and its commonalities. Additionally, Hassinger has addressed issues of equality with works like \\"Love,\\" a display made of hundreds of pink plastic bags, each containing a love note. Such pieces exemplify how she is able to evoke beauty and themes about society using everyday, common materials. From 1984-1985, Hassinger worked at the Studio Museum in Harlem as an artist-in-residence. During the 1980s, the League of Allied Arts sponsored the musical Ain't Misbehavin honoring various Black artists. The League of Allied Arts is the longest running Black women's arts nonprofit arts organization in the Los Angeles area. The musical took place at the Aquarius Theatre in Hollywood and Hassinger was among the several honored artists.  Educator  From 1997 until 2017, she was the Director of the Rinehart School of Sculpture at the Maryland Institute College of Art. Hassinger was an adjunct professor at Stony Brook University for five years.

The legislation established the predecessor to the estate tax, and twice the Supreme Court of the United States issued rulings about the law. History The War Revenue Act of 1898 was introduced to fund American participation in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The people of Cuba had been seeking independence from Spain for several years, and after the destruction of the in Havana harbor on February 15, diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Spain dramatically worsened. President McKinley submitted a war message to Congress on April 11,MacCartney, p. 127. and Congress enacted a joint resolution on April 19 demanding independence for Cuba and giving McKinley the authorization to declare war if Spain did not yield.Trask, p. 57. McKinley signed the war resolution into law on April 20. After a series of events that included the announcement of a U.S. naval blockade of Cuba, the U.S. declared on April 25 that a state of war between the U.S. and Spain had existed since April 21. Congress recognized from the outset that additional revenues would be needed to prosecute the war. On April 25, 1898, Representative Nelson Dingley, Jr. introduced H.R. 10100 to levy these new taxes.New York Public Library, p. 384. Accessed 2014-01-31. Dingley's bill proposed issuing $500 million in bonds and raising $100 million in taxes on products as diverse as chewing gum, beer, circuses, insurance policies, pawnbrokers, theaters, toilet articles, and wine. Democrats argued that these taxes fell too heavily on the poor, and sought to amend the law.Weisman, p. 177. Dingley was chair of the powerful House Committee on Ways and Means, and his committee took up the bill the day following its introduction. The committee discussed the bill on April 26 and April 27, and reported it favorably to the House floor on April 27. The same day, the House debated and passed the bill.Republican National Committee, p. 373. Accessed 2014-01-31. H.R. 10100 was reported to the United States Senate, where it was referred to the Committee on Finance. The committee reported an amended bill to the Senate floor on May 12. Democrats and so-called \\"Silver Republicans\\" (members of the Republican Party who wished to devalue the dollar by moving the country off the gold standard to the silver standard) united to create a majority on the committee which adopted amendments adding excise taxes on business and taxing bond transactions. The Finance Committee bill met with opposition on the Senate floor. The House bill sought to raise $150 million in taxes, and to borrow another $150 million (if necessary). But the Finance Committee bill raised $200 million in taxes and another $100 million via the issuance of United States Notes and silver certificates. Another Finance Committee change taxed all corporations at the same rate, without giving an exemption to small corporations. The issuance of Notes was stripped from the bill on the floor, but the issuance of certificates remained. An effort was made to exempt small businesses from the corporate tax, but this effort also failed.Republican National Committee, p. 377. Accessed 2014-01-31. A wide range of amendments were offered on the Senate floor, including an antitrust law, an income tax, repeal of the United States Treasury's ability to issue bonds, and a number of restrictions on the issuance of bonds. All these failed. However, a limitation on the amount of silver coin which could be issued by the Treasury was adopted, the estate tax was lowered to 0.75 percent,Republican National Committee, p. 377-378. Accessed 2014-01-31. and an excise tax on imported tea were all adopted. The Senate began debating the amended bill on May 16, and approved it on June 4. Conference committees were established by both chambers, although the date when each was established is not clear, nor is it certain when the conference report was issued to the House and Senate. The House voted on the conference report on June 9, approving it by a vote of 154 to 107.Another six members voted \\"present\\" and another 87 members abstained. The Senate adopted the conference report on June 10 by a vote of 43 to 22.Republican National Committee, p. 375. Accessed 2014-01-31.Another 24 members did not vote. President McKinley signed the War Revenue Act into law on June 13. Terms The War Revenue Act of 1898 authorized a tax on a wide range of goods and services, including amusements, liquor, tea, and tobacco, and required tax stamps on some business transactions (such as bills of lading, manifests, and marine insurance).Garbade, p. 29.Jewell, p. 1895; Swaine, p. 653; Pratt, p. 117. The act also established a one-cent per call \\"telephone tax\\", which lasted three years.Goldstein, p. 33. A tax on corporate gross receipts over $200,000 was also included, but applied only to sugar- and oil-refining companies. The Supreme Court had struck down a gross corporate receipts tax in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Company, 157 U.S. 429 (1895), because, as a direct tax, the gross receipts tax violated the Constitution's provision that direct taxes be apportioned. Opponents of the tax criticized it for not taxing partnerships, and Congress narrowed the scope of the tax to just sugar and oil companies.Bank, p. 42‚Äì44. The act also authorized the U.S. Treasury to issue $200 million in war bonds at 3 percent interest,McCulley, p. 57. provided that no more than $100 million in bonds were outstanding at any time.Garbade, p. 42. The government was also permitted to issue up to $100 million in bonds with a maturity of less than a year. This proved \\"a turning point\\" in the federal government's ability to create flexible financial instruments critical to maintaining the credit of the United States.Livingston, p.121. There was concern that the Treasury could not find enough buyers for these bonds at such a low interest rate. But there were more than 230,000 buyers of bonds at amounts less than $500 and another 88,000 buyers of bonds at larger amounts. These bond sales and tax revenues generated budget surpluses that lasted through 1917. Issuance of silver coinage continued until passage of the Gold Standard Act of March 14, 1900.Shannon, p. 326. The estate tax An estate tax was included in the War Revenue Act. This was not the first estate tax enacted in the history of the United States, but its graduated nature made it the precursor to the modern federal estate tax. The estate tax was strongly opposed, but was never removed from the War Revenue Act. The 1898 tax was levied on estates themselves, not on beneficiaries. The tax varied from 0.75 percent to 15 percent, depending on the size of the estate and the relationship between decedent and legatee. Only personal property was subject to taxation, and the first $10,000 of the estateMiller, p. 69. as well as property transferred from husband to surviving wife were exempted. Supreme Court decisions The U.S. Supreme Court twice ruled on the provisions of the War Revenue Act. In Nicol v. Ames, 173 U.S. 509 (1899) the Supreme Court held that the War Revenue Act's tax on stocks, bonds, securities, and commodities agreements was not a property tax, but was instead a tax on the right to exchange. Thus, the tax was more in the nature of an excise tax. The court also upheld the Act's applicability to livestock sales.\\"War Revenue Act of 1898.' Harvard Law Review. 13:2 (June 1899), p. 138‚Äì139. In the second case, the constitutionality of the estate tax was in question. The tax was upheld by the Supreme Court in Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U.S. 41 (1900).Johnson and Eller, p. 69.

He was a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1859 and of the Wisconsin State Senate from 1860 to 1861. Westerm Emigration Company Bennett was a founder of the \\"Western Emigration Company\\" which was established in the winter of 1834-35 at the home of John Bullen, Jr., in Oswego County, New York. The company was created to formalize and fund their plans to move west, along with co-founders Charles W. Turner, Waters Towsley, James Scott, Dr. B. B. Cary, Jason Lothrop, Hudson Bacon, Peter Woodin, Alfred Foster, Orlando Foster, William Bullen, and Sidney Roberts. The explorers of the company first arrived at Milwaukee, which was then still a part of the Michigan Territory but would shortly transfer to the new Wisconsin Territory. They investigated settling in Milwaukee, but found they could not come to a favorable agreement with Solomon Juneau, George H. Walker, and others who were already well-established in Milwaukee. They moved south to the mouth of the Root River, but found that area was also already settled--by Gilbert Knapp, William Luce, and others--in what would become Racine, Wisconsin. They nearly made an agreement here to join the settlement, but were ultimately rejected by the existing settlers. They continued south and came to the mouth of the Pike River, where they finally settled. They named their settlement \\"Pike Creek\\", but, in 1837, it was renamed \\"Southport\\", and finally, in 1850, it became Kenosha, Wisconsin. Career 1872 photograph of the First Congregational Church of Kenosha at Park and Ashland, constructed in 1843 and moved in 1853. In June 1838, Bennett was one of the founding members of the First Congregational Church in Southport, and was a member of the first board of trustees for the church. He would later become a Deacon of the church. He was also a founder and treasurer of the Kenosha County Bible Society, an auxiliary of the American Bible Society. The Village of Southport was incorporated in 1841, and, in 1842, George Bennett was elected a trustee of the second village council. On April 5, 1850, the village board convened in special session to hand over authority to the newly incorporated City of Kenosha. Bennett was an Alderman on the first City Council of Kenosha and a Justice of the Peace. Bennett partnered with William Bullen and Beach G. Spencer in establishing one of the first stores in the settlement, where they sold supplies imported from New York via ship. At some point, he formed a business partnership with William B. Sellick --Bennett & Sellick. In politics, Bennett was one of the founders of the Kenosha branch of the abolitionist Liberty Party, a forerunner of the Free Soil Party, and, eventually, the Republican Party. The Liberty movement was very influential in the Kenosha-Racine area, which became one of the bastions of the Free Soil Party in the late 1840s, before eventually becoming a Republican stronghold in the early days of that party. In 1858, George Bennett was elected as a Republican to represent Kenosha in the Wisconsin State Assembly for the 1859 session. The next year, he was elected to the Wisconsin State Senate for 1860 and 1861, representing all of Kenosha County. In the Senate, he was a member of the Committee on Internal Improvements, from which he advocated for building up Kenosha's harbor and constructing a lighthouse. When news of the attack on Fort Sumter reached Wisconsin, at the outbreak of the American Civil War, a meeting was called at the Kenosha courthouse for April 17, 1861. George Bennett was among the prominent men who addressed the assembled citizens and urged them to support the Union cause, along with former U.S. Senator Charles Durkee. Bennett himself was a significant donor to funding and equipping Wisconsin volunteer regiments. Sometime after the civil war, Bennett relocated to Ontario, Illinois, where he continued to work as a merchant.

She studied at the Harvard Summer School before receiving her doctorate from the University of Zurich in 1886, becoming the first American female to earn a doctorate of chemistry and only the second woman in the world to receive a doctorate in her field, after Julia Lermontova. Lloyd spent many years teaching chemistry and holding other positions at various educational institutions before and after her work in Nebraska. In 1891, she became the first regularly admitted female member of the American Chemical Society. More than a century later, the Society designated her research and professional contributions to chemistry a National Historic Chemical Landmark on October 1, 2014, at the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln. Biography=Early years Rachel Abbie Lloyd (n√©e Holloway) was born in Flushing, Ohio to a large Quaker farming family. Both of her parents were teachers until her father became the Post Master in Smyrna, Ohio. She underwent loss at a young age; all three of her siblings died in infancy, her mother died when she was five, and her father died when she was 12. At the age of 13, Holloway began attending Friends School in Flushing, Ohio and continued her education at Westtown School in West Chester, Pennsylvania. Her final year of schooling was completed at Miss Margaret Robinson's School for Young Ladies, where she would also begin teaching. During her time at Robinson's School she met Franklin Lloyd, a chemist with Powers and Weightman. On May 11, 1859, when she was 20 years old, Rachel and Franklin got married. Lloyd noted that Franklin kept a chemical laboratory in their home, which is where her interest in the field originated. The couple had two children: Fannie Lloyd (1860‚Äì1860) and William C. Lloyd (1865‚Äì1865), both of whom died in infancy, Frannie of \\"disease of the brain\\" and William of jaundice. Franklin also died in 1865, shortly after William's death. After her husband's death, Lloyd was left with a substantial sum of money and used it to travel Europe from 1867-1872, seeking medical help for rheumatism and neuralgia. However, financial difficulties forced her to return to the US to look for work.American Chemical Society National Historic Chemical Landmarks. Rachel Lloyd, Ph.D., Pioneering Woman in Chemistry. http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/rachel- holloway-lloyd.html (10/4/2019) Lloyd supported herself for some time as a science teacher at the Chestnut Street Female Seminary before making the decision to formally pursue her interest in chemistry. Studies In the summer of 1876, Lloyd began attending courses in botany and chemistry at the Harvard Summer School, where she did research with Charles F. Mabery. She attended Harvard Summer School and continued her research for the next eight years, coauthoring three published papers between the years of 1881-1884. It was in these years that Lloyd met Rachel Bodley, her future colleague in the American Chemical Society, and, in 1880, Hudson Henry Nicholson, her future colleague at the University of Nebraska. During this time, Lloyd continued to teach. In 1883, she helped found the Louisville School of Pharmacy for Women in Kentucky, along with Joseph P. Barnum. In 1884, Lloyd decided to study at the University of Zurich, which at the time was the only institution where women were permitted to attempt a doctorate in chemistry. Lloyd was awarded her doctorate in 1886, at the age of 48, making her the first American woman to receive a European doctorate. Her dissertation was on the conversion of phenols to aromatic amines under Professor August Viktor Merz. During this time, she also became interested in the emerging sugar beet industry. Teaching Lloyd began teaching immediately after finishing her early education at Miss Margaret Robinson's School for Young Ladies. Her next teaching position would be at the Chestnut Street Female Seminary in 1873 where she taught chemistry following her travels in Europe. During her time as a student Lloyd still held multiple positions at other educational institutions. In 1880 Lloyd held the position of Lady Principal of Foster School for Girls in Clifton Springs, New York. Following this she was an Instructor of Chemistry at both Hampton College for Women and the Louisville School of Pharmacy for Women. Lloyd worked for a small period of time at the Normal School of Science and Royal School of Mines in London before her most notable position in 1887 at the University of Nebraska. In 1894 Lloyd was the Instructor of Science at Hillside Home School in Spring Green, Wisconsin. University of Nebraska In 1887, the University of Nebraska offered Lloyd an appointment as associate professor of analytical chemistry to join the departmental chair, Hudson Henry Nicholson as the second person in the new Chemistry Department. Lloyd encouraged both young men and young women to enroll and during Lloyd's tenure, the Nebraska section of the American Chemical Society had more women participants than any other section. Between 1888 and 1915, 10 of the 46 chemistry students were women. Following the passage of the Hatch Act of 1887, the University of Nebraska was awarded a grant of $15,000 to create the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station. Lloyd's scientific impact was based on her pioneering studies of sugars in sugar beets, using analytical techniques such as the saccharometer. Lloyd's studies made use of test plots of sugar beets in various parts of Nebraska. Her scientific reports on sugar production in sugar beets first appeared in 1890, helping establish the economic viability of sugar beet farming in the latter part of the 19th century, critical to Nebraska farmers. According to Lindblom, production of sugar in Nebraska increased from 736,000 pounds to 8,378,000 pounds in just 5 years. The findings of Lloyd and Nicholson's work resulted in investors opening up the third sugar refinery in the United States in Nebraska. It was also the first refinery in the Midwest. Lloyd rose to full professor in 1888 and was promoted to the head of the department in 1892 while Nicholson was in Europe. However, that summer, she was afflicted with partial paralysis. She continued to teach until 1894, when she resigned due to ill health. After her death, Acting Chancellor Charles E. Bessey said in a memorial lecture at the University of Nebraska, \\"She was not only an eminent chemist, she was a great teacher, and more than that, she was the beloved advisor and counselor of students\\". This is further supported by her involvement in the Camera Club and the Scientific Club, through which she connected with students. Final Years She lived in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania area for the last seven years of her life, to be closer to friends and relatives. Lloyd passed on March 7, 1900 due to heart failure and was buried with her husband and children in the Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia. University of Nebraska Time Capsule In May 2014, a time capsule was opened at the University of Nebraska Lincoln. The capsule came from the cornerstone of the building that had previously housed the Chemistry Department and had been planted there in 1916. The capsule had initially been forgotten but was discovered when someone searching for information on Rachel Lloyd discovered a newspaper article about the capsule's burial that had mentioned her. The capsule contained newspapers from the time of its burial, information about what was happening at the school at the time, photos of members of the chemistry department, and other items related to the chemistry department as it had been in 1916. Included in these photos is a high resolution photo of Lloyd, which is often used in articles about her life and work. Arguably the most important item in the capsule was a biography of Lloyd's life, titled \\"In Memoriam: Rachel Lloyd, Ph.D\\". The book was written by her brother-in-law, Clement Lloyd, and contained information about her life that was not found elsewhere. Affiliations and Memberships Throughout Lloyd's professional career she was a member of many clubs, associations, and professional societies. Her most notable memberships were in the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Association for the Advancement of Women, and the American Chemical Society. Lloyd was also a member of the following organizations/clubs: the German Chemical Society, English Chemical Society, the Hayden Art Gallery, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Browning Club, the Nebraska Academy of Sciences, and the National American Woman Suffrage Association.

They are credited with writing the first electronic music for magnetic tape, and the first entirely electronic film score for the MGM movie Forbidden Planet (1956). Bebe Barron She was born as Charlotte May Wind in Minneapolis on June 16, 1925, the only child of Ruth and Frank Wind. She studied piano at the University of Minnesota and a post-graduate degree in political science. In Minneapolis, she studied composition with Roque Cordero. She moved to New York, and worked as a researcher for Time-Life and studied musical composition. She studied music with Wallingford Riegger and Henry Cowell. She married Louis in 1947. They lived in Greenwich Village. It was Louis who nicknamed her \\"Bebe\\". She died on April 20, 2008 in Los Angeles. Louis Barron He was born in Minneapolis on April 23, 1920. As a young man, Louis had an affinity for working with a soldering gun and electrical gear. He studied music at the University of Chicago. He died on 1 November 1989 in Los Angeles. Early works The couple married in 1947 and moved to New York City. Louis' cousin, who was an executive at the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (3M), gave the newlyweds their first tape recorder as a wedding gift. It was early tape recorder technology that used magnetized plastic tape. Using their newly acquired equipment, the couple delved into the study of musique concr√®te. The first electronic music for magnetic tape composed in America was completed by Louis and Bebe in 1950 and was titled Heavenly Menagerie. Electronic music composition and production were one and the same, and were slow and laborious. Tape had to be physically cut and pasted together to edit finished sounds and compositions. Method The 1948 book Cybernetics: Or, Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine, by mathematician Norbert Wiener from MIT played an important role in the development of the Barrons' composition. The science of cybernetics proposes that certain natural laws of behavior apply to both animals and more complex electronic machines. By following the equations presented in the book, Louis was able to build electronic circuits which he manipulated to generate sounds. Most of the tonalities were generated with a circuit called a ring modulator. The sounds and patterns that came out of the circuits were unique and unpredictable because they were actually overloading the circuits until they burned out to create the sounds. The Barrons could never recreate the same sounds again, though they later tried very hard to recreate their signature sound from Forbidden Planet. Because of the unforeseen life span of the circuitry, the Barrons made a habit of recording everything. Most of the production was not scripted or notated in any way. The Barrons didn't even consider the process as music composition themselves. The circuit generated sound was not treated as notes, but instead as 'actors'. In future soundtrack composition, each circuit would be manipulated according to actions of the underlying character in the film. After recording the sounds, the couple manipulated the material by adding effects, such as reverb and tape delay. They also reversed and changed the speed of certain sounds. The mixing of multiple sounds was performed with at least three tape recorders. The outputs of two machines would be manually synchronized, and fed into an input of a third one, recording two separate sources simultaneously. The synchronization of future film work was accomplished by two 16 mm projectors that were tied into a 16 mm tape recorder, and thus ran at the same speed. While Louis spent most of his time building the circuits and was responsible for all of the recording, Bebe did the composing. She had to sort through many hours of tape. As she said, \\"it just sounded like dirty noise\\". Over time, she developed the ability to determine which sounds could become something of interest. Tape loop gave the Barrons' sounds rhythm. They mixed the sounds to create the otherworldly and strange electronic soundscapes required by Forbidden Planet.  Recording studio  Soon after relocation to New York, the Barrons opened a recording studio at 9 West 8th Street in Greenwich Village that catered to the avant-garde scene. This may have been the very first electronic music studio in America. At the studio, the Barrons used a tape recorder to record everything and everyone. They recorded Henry Miller, Tennessee Williams, and Aldous Huxley reading their work in a form of early audiobook. In June 1949, Ana√Øs Nin recorded a full version of House of Incest and four other stories from Under a Glass Bell. These recordings were pressed on red vinyl and released on the Barrons' Contemporary Classics record label under the Sound Portraits series. For a short time, the Barrons held a monopoly on tape recording equipment. The only other competition in town were the studios owned by Raymond Scott and Eric Siday. The connection through Louis' cousin working at 3M proved to be vital in obtaining batches of early magnetic tape. Due to the lack of competition in the field, and to the surprise of the owners, the recording business was a success. Aside from the tape recorders, most of the equipment in the studio was completely built by Louis. One of the home made pieces was a monstrous speaker which could produce very heavy bass. Electronic oscillators that produced sawtooth, sine, and square waves were also home built prize possessions. They had a filter, a spring reverberator, and several tape recorders. A Stancil-Hoffmann reel to reel was custom built by the inventor for looping the samples, and changing their speed. The thriving business brought in enough income to purchase some commercial equipment. The Barrons' music was noticed by the avant-garde scene. During 1952-53 the studio was used by John Cage for his very first tape work Williams Mix. The Barrons were hired by Cage to be the engineers. They recorded over 600 different sounds, and arranged them with Cage's directions in various ways by splicing the tape together. The four and a half minute piece took over a year to finish. Cage also worked in the Barrons' studio on his Music for Magnetic Tape with other notable composers, including Morton Feldman, Earle Brown, and David Tudor. It was Cage who first encouraged the Barrons to consider their creations \\"music\\". Film works The Barrons quickly learned that the avant- garde scene did not reap many financial rewards. They turned to Hollywood, which had already been using electronic instruments such as the theremin in film soundtracks for several years. In the early 50s, the Barrons collaborated with various celebrated filmmakers to provide music and sound effects for art films and experimental cinema. The Barrons scored three of Ian Hugo's short experimental films based on the writings of his wife Ana√Øs Nin. The most notable of these three films were Bells of Atlantis (1952) and Jazz of Lights (1954). The Barrons assisted Maya Deren in the audio production of the soundtrack for The Very Eye of Night (1959), which featured music by Teiji Ito. Bridges-Go-Round (1958) by Shirley Clarke featured two alternative soundtracks, one by the Barrons and one by jazz musician Teo Macero. The film's two versions showed the same four-minute film of New York City bridges. Showing the two versions back-to-back showed how different soundtracks affected the viewer's perception of the film. In 1956 the Barrons composed the very first electronic score for a commercial film - Forbidden Planet, released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The Barrons approached Dore Schary (MGM's executive producer) at an exhibit of Schary's wife's paintings in 1955. He hired them soon after, when the film was in post-production. Forbidden Planet The soundtrack for Forbidden Planet (1956) is today recognized as the first entirely electronic score for a film. Eerie and sinister, the soundtrack was unlike anything that audiences had heard before. Music historians have often noted how groundbreaking the soundtrack was in the development of electronic music. On the album sleeve notes of the Forbidden Planet soundtrack, Louis and Bebe explain: > We design and construct electronic circuits which function electronically in > a manner remarkably similar to the way that lower life-forms function > psychologically. [. . .]. In scoring Forbidden Planet - as in all of our > work - we created individual cybernetics circuits for particular themes and > leit motifs, rather than using standard sound generators. Actually, each > circuit has a characteristic activity pattern as well as a \\"voice\\". [. . .]. > We were delighted to hear people tell us that the tonalities in Forbidden > Planet remind them of what their dreams sound like. The producers of the film had originally wanted to hire Harry Partch to do the music score. The Barrons were brought in to do only about twenty minutes of sound effects. After the producers heard the initial sample score, the Barrons were assigned an hour and ten minutes of the rest of the film. The studio wanted to move the couple to Hollywood where most of the film scores were produced at the time. But the couple would not budge, and took the work back to their New York studio. The music and the sound effects stunned the audience. During the preview of the movie when the sounds of the spaceship landing on Altair IV filled the theater, the audience broke out in spontaneous applause. Later, the Barrons turned over their audio creation to GNP Crescendo records for distribution. GNP had previously demonstrated its expertise in producing and marketing science fiction film soundtracks and executive album producer Neil Norman had proclaimed the film (and the soundtrack) his favorites. Not everyone was happy with the score. Louis and Bebe did not belong to the Musicians' Union. The original screen credit for the film, which was supposed to read \\"Electronic Music by Louis and Bebe Barron\\", was changed at the last moment by a contract lawyer from the American Federation of Musicians. In order to not upset the union, the association with the word music had to be removed. The Barrons were credited with \\"Electronic Tonalities\\". Because of their non-membership in the union, the film was not considered for an Oscar in the soundtrack category. Later works The Barrons did not know what to call their creations; it was John Cage, working with the Barrons in their studio for his earliest electronic work, who convinced them that it was \\"music\\". The Musicians' Union forced MGM to title the Forbidden Planet score \\"electronic tonalities\\", not \\"music\\". And seeing the handwriting on the wall, used that excuse to deny them membership in the 1950s; the union's primary concern was losing jobs for performers rather than the medium itself. As a result, the Barrons never scored another film for Hollywood. As the years passed, the Barrons did not continue to keep up with technology, and were perfectly content to make their music in the way they always had. However, modern digital technology is now imitating the rich sounds of those old analog circuits. Bebe's last work was Mixed Emotions in 2000, from raw material collected at the University of California, Santa Barbara studio. It sounds remarkably like the Barrons' earlier material. In 1962, the Barrons moved to Los Angeles. Although they divorced in 1970, they continued to compose together until the death of Louis in 1989. Bebe Barron was a founding member and the first Secretary of the Society for Electro- Acoustic Music in the United States from 1985 to 1987. They awarded her with a lifetime achievement award in 1997. In 2000, she was invited to create a new work at University of California, Santa Barbara, using the latest in sound generating technology to collect sounds there. From October through early November 2000, she did all the actual composing in Jane Brockman's Santa Monica studio with Brockman serving as recording engineer. The sounds collected at UCSB were imported into Digital Performer on the Mac and organized to create Bebe's final work, Mixed Emotions. Bebe Barron remarried in 1975, Louis died in 1989, and Bebe died April 20, 2008.

She is best known for her large scale realistic nude self portraits as seen from her perspective looking down. Education and political involvement Semmel was born in New York City. She began her artistic training at Cooper Union, where she studied under Nicholas Marsicano. She went on to study with Morris Kantor at the Art Students League of New York before earning a BFA from the Pratt Institute in 1963. She spent seven and a half years in Spain (1963‚Äì1970), where her work, \\"gradually developed from broad gestural and spatially referenced painting to compositions of a somewhat surreal figure/ground composition...(her) highly saturated brilliant color separated (her) paintings from the leading Spanish artists whose work was darker, grayer and Goyaesque.\\" Semmel returned to New York City in 1970 and earned an MFA from the Pratt Institute in 1972. Upon returning to New York in 1970, Semmel was shocked by the number of sexualized images of women she saw on American newsstands.Richard Meyer, ‚Äú‚ÄôNot Me:‚Äô Joan Semmel's Body of Painting,‚Äù in ‚Äò‚ÄôSolitaire: Lee Lozano, Sylvia Plimack Mangold, Joan Semmel‚Äô‚Äô, edited by Helen Molesworth. (Wexner Center for the Arts, 2008). She began to paint in a figurative style, and incorporated the erotic themes for which she is known today. Her MFA thesis show at Pratt consisted of paintings from the First Erotic Series. In New York, Semmel became involved in the feminist movement and feminist art groups devoted to gender equality in the art world. She has been a member of the Ad Hoc Committee of Women Artists, the Fight Censorship (FC) group, Women in the Arts (WIA), and the Art Workers Coalition (AWC). The Women's Caucus for Art honored Semmel as a 2013 recipient of the organization's Lifetime Achievement Award. During a 2015 panel discussion titled \\"Painting and the Legacy of Feminism\\" at Maccarone Gallery, Semmel stated \\"I would like to get away from the basic declaration of why there are no great women artists. There are great women artists. There are many great women artists. And we shouldn't still be talking about why there are no great women artists. If there aren‚Äôt great celebrated women artists, that's because we have not been celebrating them, but not because they are not there.\\" Semmel has taught at the Brooklyn Museum of Art and the Maryland Institute College of Art. As of 2013, she is Professor Emeritus of Painting at Rutgers University. In 2000 Semmel taught at International Summer Academy of Fine Arts in Salzburg, Austria. Work About major themes in her work, Semmel states, \\"While my work developed through series, the connecting thread across decades is a single perspective: being inside the experience of femaleness and taking possession of it culturally.\\" Though Semmel has created many different series throughout her career, the majority of her oeuvre features themes of sexuality, the body, intimacy and self-exploration both physically and psychologically. First Erotic Series (1970‚Äì71) The First Erotic Series depicts heterosexual couples having sex. The subject matter is explicitly erotic, but the compositions give a nod to abstraction with expressive, unnatural colors and a strong emphasis on individual forms. These large scale depictions of sexual activities reclaimed gaze of the female nude, which heralded an unprecedented approach to painting and representation in the 1970s. Second Erotic Series (1972‚Äì73) Referred to by Semmel as \\"fuck paintings,\\" the Second Erotic Series paintings are sharp and realistic but retain the intense, unnatural colors of the First Erotic Series. The paintings are based on photographs of a man and woman having sex, which Semmel took over several sessions with the couple's consent. When no commercial gallery in New York would show the series, Semmel rented space in SoHo and exhibited the work herself, attracting attention from critics. Semmel refused requests by Penthouse and Playboy to publish work from the series. Erotic Yellow (1973) was used without her permission in the ‚ÄúHot Erotic Art‚Äù issue of Screw magazine (May 1974). = Possible interpretations of the Erotic Series = Joan Semmel, like said before, contained a fascination with the human body and including it within her art pieces in a sensual form. But, unlike her male chauvinist counterparts, she believed that women need to be represented how they should have always been presented within the art community; without categorizing females as a whole. Semmel takes us back to looking at the whole concept between an individual who is naked and one who is nude. The ‚ÄúWays of Seeing‚Äù allows us to understand that ‚ÄúTo be naked is to be oneself. To be nude is to be seen naked by others and yet not recognized for oneself. A naked body has to be seen as an object in order to become a nude. (The sight of it as an object stimulates the use of it as an object.) Nakedness reveals itself. Nudity is placed on display. To be naked is to be without disguise‚Äù Semmel realizes that women have been tainted not by them being nude within these paintings, but mainly from the male viewer who interprets them as nothing but naked, which immediately sexualizes them personally therefore making them associate that with any female they find attractive. It's insulting and degrading. Joan even has been quoted saying it herself; ‚ÄúI am always asked the question about my feelings of being publicly naked, and I always answer: It isn't me, it's the painting,‚Äù She forces the viewer to keep in mind the whole concept of nudity opposed to being naked by making most of the individuals in her paintings anonymous and keeping their faces hidden. This element is beneficial because it therefore compels the viewer to focus on the sexual connection itself and the personal interaction instead of two specific individuals. Self-portraits During the summer of 1973, while teaching at the Maryland Art Institute in Baltimore, Semmel began painting what she calls ‚Äúthe idea of myself as I experience myself, my own view of myself.‚Äù The self- portraits such as Me Without Mirrors (1974) include the artist's body from about the collar bone to the feet and do not include her face. Source photographs for the large-scale paintings were taken by the artist, or in some cases by a friend ‚Äúas close as possible to the artist's viewpoint.‚Äù Several self-portraits such as Intimacy and Autonomy (1974) include a male partner. In these paintings, ‚Äúthe nude no longer appears as an idealized fantasy, allegorical figure, or landscape of desire but rather as the self-apprehended body of a specific woman.‚Äù = Relating Joan's Self-Portraits to Society (Interpretation) = Lastly, with her imagery, Semmel likes to exhibit the importance of the reality of the human body, tearing apart the everlasting evolving image of what an ‚Äúattractive female‚Äù is within society. She uses herself and other females to express the reality of how age, weight, and the overall transitioning body are common with every single female. This does not take away from their beauty and Semmel is able to prove that there is and never really be a standard when it comes to what's considered beautiful and appealing. Semmel constantly references identity and has stated: \\"The artist's constant search for self merges with the woman's need for self-definition.\\" Semmel on Feminist Art In 1976 Feminist Artists Ruth Iskin, Lucy Lippard, and Arlene Raven sent Joan Semmel an invitation to respond to the question, \\"What is Feminist Art\\". In her letter, she defines feminist art as, \\"art which in some way, however varied, validates the female experience. In this society that experience is still very different than males. The validation of female experience in this culture is a primary feminist goal and any art which does so is, for me, Feminist Art.\\". She also describes Feminist Art as being more relevant as more women seek to define themselves. She also describes a power struggle of being a feminist activist but not wanting that to define one's art; that art should neither be described as \\"male\\" or \\"female\\". Her letter is now housed in the Woman's Building records in Los Angeles.Joan Semmel. Joan Semmel response to \\"What is Feminist Art?\\", 1976 or 1977. Woman's Building records, 1970-1992. Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution.  Return to the figure (1970‚Äì1978)  On her return to New York from spain in 1970, she turned from abstraction towards figuration, producing works which responded to her involvement with the burgeoning women‚Äôs movement. A staunch advocate for women‚Äôs rights, Semmel attended meetings at the Ad Hoc Women Artist‚Äôs Committee and joined artists including Judy Chicago (born 1939), Miriam Schapiro (1923‚Äì2015), Nancy Spero (1926‚Äì2009) and Louise Bourgeois (1911‚Äì2010), who had all begun to use the female body in their work. Joan was quoted on the topic; \\"My return to the figure in 1970, from an Abstract Expressionist background, was prompted by a need to work from a more personal viewpoint, and was charged by my then- emerging consciousness as a feminist.\\"  Echoing Images (1979‚Äì81)  Semmel describes this series, which was exhibited at Lerner Heller Gallery: \\"the main compositional figure is repeated twice: once in a realist style and a second much larger highly expressionistic version. They are almost like internal and external views of the self that combine a perceptual image with the ambition and striving of the emotive ego.\\"  Beach series (1985‚Äì1986)  Series of paintings made in Semmel's East Hampton studio. In 1987 she bought a house in Springs, East Hampton, where she continues to work every summer. Since 1971, Joan Semmel has spent her summers in East Hampton, NY. In 1987, she established a permanent studio in Springs, NY where she painted her Beach series (1985‚Äì87). Unlike many of her works, which isolate figures against expressive grounds of color, in these works, Semmel positions bodies in a landscape. This new way of working was characteristic of Semmel‚Äôs painterly approach in the 1980s, which was a decade when she began to push her practice in new directions. Writing about this period, Semmel stated, ‚ÄúI combined realist and painterly methods insisting that a unified style was not preordained.‚Äù With this series, she aimed to communicate the psychological experience of feeling lost in a crowd‚Äîalone and isolated even on a crowded beach. Series of paintings made in Semmel's East Hampton studio. In 1987 she bought a house in Springs, East Hampton, where she continues to work every summer.  Locker Room series (late 1980s)  Beginning with Mirror Mirror (1988), Semmel depicts camera as a \\"device to frame and question issues of perception and representation.\\" Semmel took photographs in women's locker rooms, using the mirror and the camera \\"as strategies to destabilize the point of view (who is looking at whom) and to engage the viewer as a participant...my paintings revealed a body at a more advanced age, and showed me aggressively pointing the camera at the viewer.\\"  Overlays series (1992‚Äì1996)  The Overlays series (1992‚Äì96), combines conceptual and formal concerns that echo many of Joan Semmel‚Äôs previous investigations. For this body of work, she used pre-existing paintings from her Erotic Series (1972) as a background for gestural images of nude, middle-aged female bodies taken from her prior Locker-Room paintings (1988‚Äì91). These works represent a fertile moment of formal experimentation as Semmel began exploring color and transparencies‚Äîcompositional elements that she continues to refine in her present day work. Writing about this series, she observes, ‚Äúboth non- naturalistic color and linear overlays of complementary or contrasting images, again recall abstract elements, but also provoke a suggestion of time, motion, or memory.‚Äù  Mannequins (1996‚Äì2001)  Inspired by old mannequins she found on the street, Semmel worked with these \\"idealized versions of the female body...as alter egos to explore the isolation and anomie of objectification and fetishization. The haunting beautiful faces, broken parts and empty armholes were eloquent witnesses to the way women were valued for their youth and beauty and discarded in later years as powerless and no longer viable.\\"  With Camera (2001‚Äì2006)  The first time Semmel purposefully poses in front of a mirror with the camera.  Shifting Images (2006‚Äì2013)  In Shifting Images, Joan Semmel paints her body in motion. Layered and blurred compositions, these works suggest instability, movement, and the passage of time; in Semmel‚Äôs words, ‚Äú[they] seem to reference the anxious moments of personal lives, as well as ‚Ä¶ visualize the inevitability of aging.‚Äù Ultimately, reflecting on this and other recent series, Semmel expands, ‚ÄúIn a culture so driven by youth, but due to suddenly be overtaken by the baby boomer generation in old age, it seems essential to address our expectations and priorities. If we are lucky we will be old some day. Age cannot be denied as part of the human spectrum. My work ‚Ä¶ has tried to acknowledge and address some of these feelings for myself and others.‚Äù  Heads (2007‚Äì2013)  Joan Semmel‚Äôs Heads (2007‚Äì13) feature self-portraits of the artist. Unlike Semmel‚Äôs previous self-images, in these works she paints just her face. Intimate in scale and rendered in a variety of styles, these paintings adopt both the realism of her earlier With Camera works (2001‚Äì06), as well as the blurring of her Shifting Images compositions (2006‚Äì13). In a recent interview, Semmel elaborated on her decision to begin to paint the Heads. She outlined, ‚ÄúThe way I started doing the heads was by taking those pictures in the mirror, and even though I didn‚Äôt usually use the heads I got it in the mirror because I‚Äôd hold the camera at waist level. Not always, but sometimes, so I got the face. Then I would take the heads off that picture‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt shoot for the head, but I like the head that I got.‚Äù  Transparencies (2014‚Äìongoing)  Joan Semmel continues to meditate on the aging female physique. Recalling Semmel‚Äôs 1990s Overlays series, many of these works feature silhouettes of her body superimposed over realistic renderings of her form. Interacting with one another, these dual images create what the artist describes as ‚Äúdialogues ‚Ä¶ [which] entice the viewer to engage.‚Äù At the same time, through their layered compositions that invite narratives around movement and the passage of time, these paintings advance Semmel‚Äôs decades-long engagement with chronicling her aging body.  Ongoing  Semmel has continued to paint nude self-portraits in the 2000s and 2010s. These self-portraits employ a different perspective, one seen in a mirror and including the camera and the reflection of its flash. Her most recent work explores the physical and psychological experiences associated with aging while continuing to be self-referential and engaging in her paintings. These meditations on the aging female physique are experimental in representation, expanding beyond conventional realism. Her self portraits are doubled, in motion and fragmented, perhaps explorations of a metaphysical state of being and a close tie between the body and the mind. Challenging the patriarchal gaze of an objectified nude female body, Semmel's work dissolves the typically clearly demarcated lines between artist and model, viewer and subject Exhibitions * Solo exhibition of \\"Erotic Series,\\" organized by Semmel at 141 Prince St. Gallery, New York, 1973 * Solo show at Lerner-Heller Gallery, New York, 1979 * Feministische Kunst International (International Feminist Art), Haags Gemeentemuseum, The Hague, The Netherlands, 1979 * Solo exhibition, 112 Greene Street, New York, 1984 * Solo show from Gymnasium series, Gruenebaum Gallery, New York, 1987 * Joan Semmel: Recent Work, East Hampton Center for Contemporary Art, New York, 1989 * Through the Object's Eye: Paintings by Joan Semmel at University Art Gallery, State University of New York, Albany.

Teruya's paper sculptures, installations, and drawings reconfigure symbols forming unexpected meanings that tamper with social/political realities, speculating on issues of power, control, visibility, protection and, by contrast, privilege. With Michele Carlson and Nathan Watson, he is a member of the Related Tactics artists' collective and often exhibits under that name.  Biography  Weston Teruya was born in Honolulu, Hawai'i, in 1977. He studied at Pomona College and received his BA in Studio Art, with a minor in Asian American studies in 1999. He studied a dual master's degree at California College of the Arts and graduated in 2007 with an MFA in Painting and Drawing and MA in Visual and Critical Studies. He was a Commissioner for Berkeley Civic Arts Commission, Berkeley, CA between 2013-2016. In 2014, Teruya was selected by the Berkeley Art Center to be the sole juror for the exhibition 'Feature'. Teruya curated shows for the Berkeley Art Center, Southern Exposure (art space), and the Kearny Street Workshop in San Francisco. In 2016, Teruya was an artist-in-residence at Recology, a residency program which provides artists with access to the San Francisco Solid Waste Transfer and Recycling Center. In response to this environment, he created Lessons Learned a sculptural installation made from recycled paper, office supplies, construction debris and other material from the city dump as part of his body of work, The Space Behind. Work Teruya's work touches upon issues of power and politics, often in relation to the San Francisco Bay Area. His work in 2010, The Gracious City at Its Neighbor‚Äôs Edge, explores the geographical and social juxtaposition of a golf course and Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall. His art also draws upon his own background, such as in his works related to the Hawaiian diaspora. His research involves the exploration of community histories in relation to the intersection of social movements and public space. Teruya's art has been presented by the San Francisco Arts Commission as part of the Market Street Poster Series, responding to the social dynamics related to sanctuary cities.  Exhibitions  Weston Teruya has exhibited widely. In 2019 he had a solo exhibition, expansion (land.water.sky), at the Commons Gallery, University of Hawai ªi at MƒÅnoa, Honolulu, HI. In 2018 he and Related Tactics exhibited Added Value, a public art project in collaboration with Stephanie Syjuco and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. In 2017-18 Teruya created Means of Exchange (South of Market), a public project with Kearny Street Workshop & Kimberley Acebo Arteche, in San Francisco, CA. In 2017 he was in a three-person show, The future needs new plans, at the Patricia Sweetow Gallery, in Oakland, CA. In 2016 he exhibited the installation the space left behind, as his Recology Artist-in-Residence show, in San Francisco, CA.

She was best known as a painter of floral still lifes, and by 1890 she was thought to be the most important flower painter in Canada. She also painted domesticated landscapes, night scenes, and, less frequently, studio interiors and figure studies. Her work as a painter is related in a broad sense to Tonalism and Aestheticism or \\"art for art's sake\\". She was made a member of the Ontario Society of Artists in 1887, and in 1907 became only the second woman to serve on its executive committee. She was also one of the first women to be elected an Associate of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts (RCA) in 1893. She was elected to join the Canadian Society of Applied Art in 1904. Biography Reid was born in Reading, Pennsylvania on April 10, 1854. From 1883 to 1885, Reid studied painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts with Thomas Eakins. In the Academy, she met her future husband Canadian artist George Agnew Reid (1860‚Äì1947). From 1888 to 1889, she studied at the Acad√©mie Colarossi in Paris, taking costume-study and life classes. She studied there again in 1896. During the 19th and early 20th century, at the time of her schooling, women were rarely allowed to pursue art as a career. If they attended art school, they were often not taught the same material as men.The Pennsylvania Academy and its women Although they both attended art school, Mary was restricted to traditionally feminine themes, and in turn became known for her flower paintings.REID, Mary Heister; by Canadian Women Artists History Initiative; published 28 November 2013; retrieved 1 February 2014; Despite the expectations for women to remain at home and care for children, Mary rose to prominence and became one of the first women to have her work included in the National Gallery of Canada. Reid exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinoisand to the exhibitions of the OSA and the RCA, the Art Association of Montreal, the Women's Art Association of Canada, and the Canadian National Exhibition. She also exhibited her work at the Pan-American exposition in Buffalo (1901), and the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St Louis (1904), with Mary Evelyn Wrinch at the galleries of the Art Metropole in Toronto (1912), and with her husband and Wrinch at the Royal Ontario Museum, in aid of the Red Cross Society (1915). In addition to producing paintings that were widely admired, Mary became financially successful and received significant reviews in the Toronto press. In 1893, she was elected an Associate of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts, one of the first women elected. Legacy A retrospective show of Reid's work was held in 1922 at the Art Gallery of Toronto, following her death on October 4, 1921. It included 308 works. She was the first woman to posthumously receive a solo retrospective exhibition at that institution. In 2000, Mary Hiester Reid's work was rediscovered (suggested CBC Radio, 21 June, 2020) when the Art Gallery of Ontario held an exhibition of her work, Quiet Harmony: The Art of Mary Hiester Reid, curated by Brian Foss and Janice Anderson.

Biography Farr was born on October 10, 1820 in Waterford, Vermont. He attended the common schools and then taught school to raise money to enter Dartmouth College. He graduated from the medical department of Dartmouth College in 1846 and commenced practice as a doctor and surgeon in St. Johnsbury, Vermont. He moved to Peacham, Vermont, in 1847, where he married Martha Jackson Wheeler and where his father died in 1852. He then moved to Kenosha, Wisconsin, in 1854, with his wife and son. In addition to his work in medicine, he served on the Kenosha school board and was president of the school board from 1871 to 1874. He was elected to his first one-year term as Mayor in 1859, then again in 1864, 1871, 1872, 1873, 1877, and 1878. Farr was a member of the Assembly in 1873 and represented the 8th district of the Senate (at the time Kenosha and Walworth counties) from 1876 to 1877. Politically, he was a Democrat until the outbreak of the American Civil War. At that time, he became a Republican and remained with that party for the rest of his life. Personal life and family Farr married Martha Jackson Wheeler of Vermont and together they had three children. Albert and William both became doctors like their father, and Martha married Colonel James R. Nutting. His wife died in 1878 and he remarried to Emma Marr Durfee of Waukegan, Illinois.

Her work has been shown in solo exhibitions at KINDL - Centre for Contemporary Art Berlin, the Kunstraum Dornbirn, the Neuer Berliner Kunstverein, the LENTOS Art Museum in Linz, and the Henry Moore Sculpture Institute, among others. She has also participated in international group exhibitions at venues including the Maas Museum in Sydney, the German Hygiene Museum in Dresden, the Hartware Medienkunstverein Dortmund, and the 22nd Bienal de S√£o Paulo. She is currently a professor at the Braunschweig University of Art. Gr√∂ting's earlier work focused on sculpture, before she also turned to video and performance, starting 1993. Gr√∂ting's works often present ordinary, familiar elements, where the viewer's attention is drawn towards their material transformation, caused by the exaggeration of the familiar. In Gr√∂ting‚Äôs work there is a focus on what is not visible, like the inner voice, the space between lovers having sex, the digestive system, or the inside of holes made by bullets, and the ways in which the invisible can be brought to the surface. As such, she allows absence to do the talking. In these explorations a sense of realism is at work that pays attention to what is not considered to be beautiful, or to what is seen as damaged or even damaging. It develops works that convert psychological and emotional perspectives to the complex relationships of people into clear forms. Often they are presented in work groups or series.Stella Rollig, \\"What is your standpoint? What can be known? Asta Gr√∂ting's sculpture and video\\", in: Asta Gr√∂ting, exhibition catalogue, eds.

See also the radio interview with the artist for rbb They track the traces of the bullet holes made during war in facades that have not yet been renovated. For Gr√∂ting the casts function as photographic long exposures that depict the story from the moment of the bullets‚Äô impact to the present time, taking along dust, dirt, and even graffiti. ‚ÄúI want to look from inside these destroyed walls and facades into the world,‚Äù Gr√∂ting says, ‚Äúas if I could see my own face staring back at me.‚ÄùPress text for the exhibition in KINDL - Centre for Contemporary Art, Berlin, 2017 Touch is an ongoing series, which the artist started in 2015. Gr√∂ting invited a number of friends to sit for a portrait. The portrait consists of the artist tracing the contours of their face with her hands. It recalls the gestures of sculpting, reading the face‚Äôs expression. Although it‚Äôs a touching of a surface, it‚Äôs at the same time also a most intimate conversation.Birgit Rieger, \\"Hautarbeit. Neue Filme von Asta Gr√∂ting\\", in: Tagesspiegel, February 2, 2016 In The Traveling Carriage of Goethe the Mercedes of Adenauer and My Smart (2011) Gr√∂ting made full-scale casts of the undersides of three vehicles from three different centuries. The rubber molds visualize a sculptural history of movement. Motion is also the topic of Gr√∂ting‚Äôs video Parken, in which from a bird‚Äôs eye view we see several cars competing for a parking space.Kerstin Stakemeier, press text for the exhibition \\"Asta Gr√∂ting The travelling carriage of Goethe the Mercedes of Adenauer and my smart\\", March 3 - April 14, 2012, carlier  gebauer, Berlin. Space Between Lovers (2008-) is the materialization of a physical intimate moment. Two actors were covered in silicone while they were having sex. In this way, the in-between, the inner space was visualized sculpturally. Both intimacy and distance define also Space Between a Family (2010-2015), which consists of life-size casts of members of Gr√∂ting‚Äôs family made over the course of several years. ‚ÄúIt is not hard to imagine that these introspective figures possess internal organs,‚Äù the British author Deborah Levy writes, ‚Äúbut they are uncanny too, mournful grey ghosts of substance who seem to be emerging from both a war and a womb.‚Äù Lentos Kunstmuseum TV, 2010 From the early nineties onwards, Gr√∂ting took beside sculpture an interest in immaterial media like performance and video. For The Inner Voice (1993-2004) Gr√∂ting explored ventriloquism as a performative instrument to research the soul and its inner workings.Stella Rollig, \\"Searching through the Domains of the Human\\", in: Asta Gr√∂ting. The Inner Voice, eds. Jan Hoet and Christoph Keller, translated into English by Tradukas, Revolver, Archiv f√ºr Aktuelle Kunst, Frankfurt am Main 2004 A series of videos came about depicting conversations between a dummy created by the artist and ventriloquists from all over the world. In their own native language they performed dialogues written by Gr√∂ting, Deborah Levy, and Tim Etchells. On several occasions Gr√∂ting worked together with the Native American ventriloquist Buddy Big Mountain.

Biography  Schwarcz studied industrial design at Pratt Institute in New York City from 1939 to 1941 and afterward created packages, greeting cards, textiles, and window displays in New York. In 1943 she married Leroy Schwarcz, an engineer whose work necessitated several moves. While visiting Denver en route to Sausalito in 1954, Schwarcz was introduced to enameling. She began creating enamels with pre-made metal forms but soon began pounding out her own, developing an expertise in the base-taille technique. When she moved to New Haven, Connecticut, in 1955, Schwarcz travelled to New York City to see examples of contemporary enamel. The curator of the Museum of Contemporary Crafts included her work in the museum's inaugural exhibition, Craftsmanship in a Changing World (1956), establishing her reputation. When Schwarcz moved to La Jolla later that year, she showed with the Allied Craftsmen of San Diego and received her first solo exhibition at the La Jolla Art Center (1957). That same year she returned to Sausalito. Beginning in 1962, Schwarcz used electroplating and electroforming to create more dramatic textures and varied shapes. Her innovative use of copper foil and mesh, which she started using in 1964, enables her to fold, cut, gather, and stitch to create unique, dynamic forms. Designated a Living Treasure of California in 1985, Schwarcz also received the James Renwick Alliance Masters of the Medium Award (2009). Since the late 1950s her work has appeared in numerous exhibitions and has been the subject of solo shows at the San Francisco Museum of Craft and Folk Art (1998), the Mingel International Museum in San Diego (2009‚Äì10), and the Renwick Gallery of the Smithsonian American Art Museum Her work is in the permanent collection of The Cleveland Museum of Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, and the Museum of Arts and Design, among others.

It continues to be a major field of art criticism.  Emergence  Linda Nochlin's 1971 groundbreaking essay, \\"Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?\\", analyzes the embedded privilege in the predominantly white, male, Western art world and argued that women's outsider status allowed them a unique viewpoint to not only critique women's position in art, but to additionally examine the discipline's underlying assumptions about gender and ability. Nochlin's essay develops the argument that both formal and social education restricted artistic development to men, preventing women (with rare exception) from honing their talents and gaining entry into the art world. In the 1970s, feminist art criticism continued this critique of the institutionalized sexism of art history, art museums, and galleries, as well as questioning which genres of art were deemed museum-worthy. This position is articulated by artist Judy Chicago: \\"...it is crucial to understand that one of the ways in which the importance of male experience is conveyed is through the art objects that are exhibited and preserved in our museums. Whereas men experience presence in our art institutions, women experience primarily absence, except in images that do not necessarily reflect women's own sense of themselves.\\" Genius Nochlin challenges the myth of the Great Artist as 'Genius' as an inherently problematic construct. 'Genius' ‚Äúis thought of as an atemporal and mysterious power somehow embedded in the person of the Great Artist.‚Äù This ‚Äògod-like‚Äô conception of the artist's role is due to \\"the entire romantic, elitist, individual-glorifying, and monograph-producing substructure upon which the profession of art history is based.\\" She develops this further by arguing that \\"if women had the golden nugget of artistic genius, it would reveal itself. But it has never revealed itself. Q.E.D. Women do not have the golden nugget of artistic genius.\\" Nochlin deconstructs the myth of the 'Genius' by highlighting the unjustness in which the Western art world inherently privileges certain predominantly white male artists. In Western art, ‚ÄòGenius‚Äô is a title that is generally reserved for artists such as, van Gogh, Picasso, Raphael, and Pollock‚Äîall white men. As recently demonstrated by Alessandro Giardino, when the concept of artistic genius started collapsing, women and marginal groups emerged at the forefront of artistic creation.Alessandro Giardino, \\"Caravaggio and the Enfranchisement of Women. New Discoveries\\"_, 2017. Museum organizations Similar to Nochlins‚Äô assertions on women's position in the art world, art historian Carol Duncan in the 1989 article, ‚ÄúThe MoMA Hot Mamas‚Äù, examines the idea that institutions like the MoMA are masculinized. In MoMA's collection, there is a disproportionate amount of sexualized female bodies by male artists on display compared to a low percentage of actual women artists included. According to data accumulated by the Guerrilla Girls, ‚Äúless than 3% of the artists in the Modern Art section of New York‚Äôs Metropolitan Museum of Art are women, but 83% of the nudes are female‚Äù, even though ‚Äú51% of visual artists today are women.‚Äù Duncan claims that, in regards to women artists: > In the MoMA and other museums, their numbers are kept well below the point > where they might effectively dilute its masculinity. The female presence is > necessary only in the form of imagery. Of course, men, too, are occasionally > represented. Unlike women, who are seen primarily as sexually accessible > bodies, men are portrayed as physically and mentally active beings who > creatively shape their world and ponder its meanings. This article narrows its focus on one institution to use as an example to draw from and expand on. Ultimately to illustrate the ways in which institutions are complicit in patriarchal and racist ideologies.  Intersectionality  Women of color in the art world were often not addressed in earlier feminist art criticism. An intersectional analysis that includes not only gender but also race and other marginalized identities is essential. Audre Lorde‚Äôs 1984 essay ‚ÄúThe Master‚Äôs Tools Will Never Dismantle The Master‚Äôs House,‚Äùhttp://www.muhlenberg.edu/media/contentassets/pdf/campuslife/sdp%20reading%20lorde.pdf briefly addresses a vital dilemma that artists who are women of color are often overlooked or tokenized in the visual arts. She argues that \\"in academic feminist circles, the answer to these questions is often, ‚ÄòWe did not know who to ask.‚Äô But that is the same evasion of responsibility, the same cop-out, that keeps Black women's art out of women's exhibitions, Black women's work out of most feminist publications except for the occasional ‚ÄòSpecial Third World Women's Issue,‚Äô and Black women's texts off your reading lists.‚Äù Lorde‚Äôs statement brings up how important it is to consider intersectionality in these feminist art discourses, as race is just as integral to any discussion on gender. Furthermore, bell hooks expands on the discourse of black representation in the visual arts to include other factors. In her 1995 book, Art on My Mind, hooks positions her writings on the visual politics of both race and class in the art world. She states that the reason art is rendered meaningless in the lives of most black people is not solely due to the lack of representation, but also because of an entrenched colonization of the mind and imagination and how it is intertwined with the process of identification. Thus she stresses for a ‚Äúshift [in] conventional ways of thinking about the function of art. There must be a revolution in the way we see, the way we look,\\" emphasizing how visual art has the potential to be an empowering force within the black community. Especially if one can break free from \\"imperialist white-supremacist notions of the way art should look and function in society.\\"  Intersection with other schools of thought  Feminist art criticism is a smaller subgroup in the larger realm of feminist theory, because feminist theory seeks to explore the themes of discrimination, sexual objectification, oppression, patriarchy, and stereotyping, feminist art criticism attempts similar exploration. This exploration can be accomplished through a variety of means. Structuralist theories, deconstructionist thought, psychoanalysis, queer analysis, and semiotic interpretations can be used to further comprehend gender symbolism and representation in artistic works. The social structures regarding gender that influence a piece can be understood through interpretations based on stylistic influences and biographical interpretations.  Freudian Psychoanalytic Theory  Laura Mulvey's 1975 essay, \\"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema\\" focuses on the gaze of the spectator from a Freudian perspective. Freud's concept of scopophilia relates to the objectification of women in art works. The gaze of the viewer is, in essence, a sexually charged instinct. Because of the gender inequity that exists in the art sphere, the artist's portrayal of a subject is generally a man's portrayal of women. Other Freudian symbolism can be used to comprehend pieces of art from a feminist perspective‚Äîwhether gender specific symbols are uncovered through psychoanalytic theory (such as phallic or yonic symbols) or specific symbols are used to represent women in a given piece.  Realism and Reflectionism  Are the women depicted in an artistic work realistic portrayals of women? Writer Toril Moi explained in her 1985 essay \\"'Images of Women' Criticism\\" that \\"reflectionism posits that the artist's selective creation should be measured against 'real life,' thus assuming that the only constraint on the artist's work is his or her perception of the 'real world.'\\"  Journals and publication  The 1970s also saw the emergence of feminist art journals, including The Feminist Art Journal in 1972 and Heresies in 1977. The journal n.paradoxa has been dedicated to an international perspective on feminist art since 1996.A List of Past and Present Feminist Art Journals on n.paradoxa's information pages Important publications on feminist art criticism include: * Betterton, Rosemary An Intimate Distance: Women Artists and the Body London, Routledge, 1996. * Deepwell, Katy ed.

Beyond the academy  In 1989, the Guerilla Girls' poster protest of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's gender imbalance brought this feminist critique out of the academy and into the public sphere. Exhibition In 2007, the exhibit \\"WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution\\" presented works of 120 international artists and artists‚Äô groups at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. It was the first show of its kind that employed a comprehensive view of the intersection between feminism and art from the late 1960s to the early 1980s. WACK! ‚Äúargues that feminism was perhaps the most influential of any postwar art movement-on an international level-in its impact on subsequent generations of artists.‚Äù  Today  Rosemary Betteron's 2003 essay, ‚ÄúFeminist Viewing: Viewing Feminism‚Äù, insists that older feminist art criticism must adapt to newer models, as our culture has shifted significantly since the late twentieth century. Betterton points out: > Feminist art criticism is no longer the marginalized discourse that it once > was; indeed it had produced some brilliant and engaging writing over the > last decade and in many ways has become a key site of academic production. > But, as feminist writers and teachers, we need to address ways of thinking > through new forms of social engagement between feminism and the visual, and > of understanding the different ways in which visual culture is currently > inhabited by our students. According to Betterton, the models used to critique a Pre-Raphaelite painting are not likely to be applicable in the twenty-first century. She also expresses that we should explore ‚Äòdifference‚Äô in position and knowledge, since in our contemporary visual culture we are more used to engaging with \\"multi- layered text and image complexes\\" (video, digital media, and the Internet). Our ways of viewing have changed considerably since the 1970s.

Background Cosgrove is a 2010 graduate of Harvard College, where he was a student of Hans Tutschku, and his music usually features his own performances on piano, guitar, mandolin, banjo, violin, trumpet, trombone, upright bass, and dynamic percussion, among other instruments. Cosgrove's first instrument was the piano. He began taking lessons as a young child after his family moved into a house and his parents purchased an upright. In addition to his solo work, he often tours and records with other artists and has frequently served as the touring keyboardist/accordionist for fellow New Englanders The Ghost of Paul Revere. Releases His 2011 album Yankee Division is based upon landscapes around Massachusetts and the rest of New England and takes its name from the Yankee Division Highway. His fourth album Field Studies deals with the wider American landscape, from the Sierra Nevada to the Everglades. It was released in January 2014.\\"It‚Äôs instrumental music intended to suggest the experience of certain physical landscapes,\\" he stated in an interview with Sound of Boston. The album's first track, ‚ÄúLafayette‚Äù is written about Mount Lafayette in New Hampshire; the song is meant to recreate the moment in the hike when ‚Äúyou get above the clouds and have a unique kind of clarity.‚Äù \\"Montreal Song\\", the album's second track, garnered a chapter in Matthew Doucet's 2020 title You've Never Heard Your Favorite Song: 100 Deep Cuts to Make Your World Sound Better. Cosgrove's landscape compositions are also credited in Conor Knighton's Leave Only Footprints, about a year traveling to each of America's National Parks. In 2014, he produced the album Ellery for singer-songwriter Max Garcia Conover, composing and performing arrangements to underpin Conover's melodies. In 2015, Cosgrove released a live album, \\"Solo Piano,\\" which features recordings collected from performances in thirteen different states. One reviewer called it \\"a humbling reminder of just how much emotion can be conveyed without a word on a solo piano that is expertly played.\\" His latest studio album, \\"Salt,\\" a concept record comparing landscapes of flux and ambiguity to personal tumult and emotional unrest, came out in the spring of 2017 and was described by Sound of Boston as \\"the human condition set to gorgeous, lush piano.\\" In Junction Magazine, reviewer James Napoli wrote that the music represented \\"a poetry of tones and turns and motion and play that transcends the gross signification of everyday language[...] Cosgrove‚Äôs music is about landscape, about place, about space. It reacts and responds and reflects and resonates in space. It creates and transforms space. This album, specifically, is about instability, uncertainty, liminality, disorientation. It‚Äôs about the unhinged feeling that comes from losing the solid ground on which one has comfortably and complicitly stood for too long, about the realization that the safety provided by such footholds is always illusory, and about learning to live with the shifting, floating impermanence that was there (and not there), enveloping us all along. It‚Äôs a break-up album. And it‚Äôs also a salve.\\" He has served as an Artist-at-Sea with the Schmidt Ocean Institutehttps://schmidtocean.org/cruise-log-post/artist-sea-ben-cosgrove- vietnam-guam/ and worked closely with the New England National Scenic Trail, serving for a year and a half as the trail's first-ever composer-in- residence.https://soundcloud.com/wnpr/in-studio-with-ben- cosgrovehttp://artists-in-residence-field-notes.com/artist-video-profile-ben- cosgrove-new-england-national-scenic-trail/ In 2020 Cosgrove also appeared on The Ghost of Paul Revere's album Good at Losing Everything and Darlingside's Fish Pond Fish. Literature Cosgrove also writes nonfiction essays that touch upon place, sound, and art. He began selling a short collection, Seven Essays, at performances and online in early 2016, and his writing has appeared in Orion, Northern Woodlands, and other magazines. He was a two-time artist in residence at the Signet Society and has also served as the artist-in-residence at Isle Royale National Park, Acadia National Park, and White Mountain National Forest.

History Initially following the invention of the seaplane, traditional boat docks were typically used as there was little need for purpose-built facilities. This would later change, however, as commercial seaplane operations proved financially viable, leading many companies, most notably Pan American Airways, to push for the construction of seaplane bases that were optimized for such use. These new seaplane bases often featured terminal buildings for passengers and cargo, concrete ramps for amphibious aircraft, and floating docks that connected to land. Seaplane bases would end up becoming very heavily utilized for commercial air traffic for a number of years, but they eventually fell out favor as land based aircraft rose in prominence. Advances in aircraft technology following World War II resulted in the development of land based aircraft that were capable of travelling greater distances, thus relegating seaplane bases to secondary use by about the 1950s. Although their commercial use has generally fallen out of the mainstream, many seaplane bases in remote areas still have commercial service as a means of providing easier access. Other bases still exist for general aviation use as well.

L Dubba E, the leader of the 245 gang, battles and defeats BTRO, the leader of the 248 gang. BTRO dies as a result. His younger brother JTRO is traumatized and leaves the FP. One year later, BTRO's best friend KCDC finds JTRO working as a lumberjack. KCDC convinces JTRO that the FP needs him because L Dubba E has taken control of the local alcohol industry and is refusing to sell alcoholic drinks to everyone. The lack of alcohol has led to an increase in methamphetamine addicts, a decrease in homeless people and, consequently, ducks. Reluctantly, JTRO returns with KCDC; he meets BLT and reunites with Stacy, an old friend. JTRO and Stacy are interrupted by L Dubba Enow Stacy's boyfriendwho is picking her up to go to a party.

L Dubba E demands that JTRO defeat Triple Decka 1K before he will accept JTRO's challenge. JTRO begins a grueling training regime with BLT to regain his former level of skill. Before his match with Triple Decka 1K, BLT gives BTRO's boots to JTRO. At the match venue, JTRO is tricked into drinking alcohol tainted with methamphetamine. Despite his drug-induced visual impairment, JTRO defeats Triple Decka 1K before vomiting and passing out. KCDC wakes JTRO, having taken him to the 248 headquarters. After JTRO's recovery, BLT takes him and KCDC shooting; they decide to take guns to JTRO's match against L Dubba E. Stacy tells JTRO that her relationship with L Dubba E began when he spiked her drink with turpentine and raped her. She continued the relationship so she could supply her father with beer to prevent him from turning to drugs. One day, JTRO hears Stacy's father assaulting her and intervenes. After a brief fight with him, JTRO persuades Stacy to leave. Immediately after their departure, L Dubba E arrives and says that he has been cheating on Stacy. Stacy decides to stay with him, which angers JTRO and causes him to end their friendship. Later the same day, Stacy, who has been badly beaten, finds JTRO and tells him that she has ended her relationship with L Dubba E. She apologizes, and they kiss. Meanwhile, L Dubba E tells his gang members to also take guns to the final match. At the venue, JTRO wears BTRO's outfit and L Dubba E taunts him. When the match begins, L Dubba E defeats JTRO in the first round but JTRO perseveres and wins the second and third rounds. L Dubba E tries to kill JTRO, triggering a lengthy gunfight between the 248 and the 245. L Dubba E escapes the event and kidnaps Stacy. JTRO and KCDC pursue him while BLT remains at the venue. L Dubba E abruptly pulls into a gas station; JTRO follows and a fight ensues. JTRO gains the upper hand, beats L Dubba E into submission and forces him to leave the FP. Freedom to buy alcohol is restored and control of the FP is returned to the 248. JTRO and Stacy go to the pond together as ducks fly over them.  Cast  * Jason Trost as JTRO, a member of the 248 gang who sets out to defeat L Dubba E. Trost wrote JTRO as the straight man and compared him to Rocky Balboa and John Rambo. * Lee Valmassy as L Dubba E, the leader of the 245, a rival gang to the 248. Jason Trost said the character is similar to Mr. T and that Valmassy was \\"so embarrassed ... when he first [played the part] he almost didn't want to talk to me again\\". Valmassy also appears several times as a background extra. * Caitlyn Folley as Stacy, L Dubba E's girlfriend and JTRO's old friend. * Art Hsu as KCDC, an energetic member of the 248 and BTRO's best friend who serves as the emcee for the Beat-Beat Revelation matches. The directors said Hsu needed little direction because he played his character well. Hsu described KCDC as \\"the sidekick\\" and \\"the guy who ... guides people through the FP\\". The Trosts originally wrote the character to be more bipolar and feminine but they decided to reduce those elements for the final draft. * Nick Principe as BLT, an abrasive member of the 248 and JTRO's trainer. Jason met Principe during the production of Laid to Rest, on which he worked as a costume assistant and as Principe's body double. * Dov Tiefenbach as Triple Decka 1K, a Russian Beat-Beat Revelation player who faces JTRO. Tiefenbach engaged in method acting by maintaining his Russian accent on- and off-set throughout filming. * James DeBello as Beat Box Busta Bill, a member of the 245 and one of L Dubba E's henchmen. * Bryan Goddard as Sugga Nigga, a member of the 245 and one of L Dubba E's henchmen. * Brandon Barrera as BTRO, JTRO's brother and the leader of the 248. Barrera appears as an extra in several scenes. Additional cast members include Mike Sandow as Jody, Rachel Robinson as Lacy, Natalie Minx as Macy, Sean Whalen as Stacy's father, and Clifton Collins, Jr. as CC Jam. Blayne Weaver makes a cameo appearance as the owner of a gas station KCDC robs, while James Remar narrates the film's prelude. Dash Mihok played a small role in the cut of the film shown at South by Southwest, but his scenes were removed from the theatrical release. Several of the production crew, including producer Christian Agypt, first assistant director Christopher Holmes, costume designer Sarah Trost, Valmassy's younger brother Kyle, and several of the Trosts' friends appear as background extras.

He noticed people playing the game intensely and thought of treating the gameplay \\"like some blood sport\\". Trost made short films throughout high school before briefly attending film school. After dropping out, he used his tuition money to fund a short film, also titled The FP (2007). The short film was based on the original feature-length script, but only the first ten pages were filmed. The feature film recreated several shots from the short film. Trost said the feature film was inspired by what they imagined a Dance Dance Revolution film made by producer Jerry Bruckheimer would look like. The Trost brothers asked producer Brandon Barrera to act in the short film. After seeing their work, Barrera suggested that the brothers expand the premise into a feature film. The filmmakers placed an advertisement in the Mountain Enterprise, the Mountain Communities of the Tejon Pass's newspaper, encouraging community members to call if they wanted to help with locations, catering, donations, or by serving as extras or crew members on the film. The Trost brothers named The FP after Frazier Park, California, where they grew up. Jason Trost said locals started referring to Frazier Park as \\"the FP\\" after The O.C. began airing. He also said the film's story copies that of Rocky \\"beat for beat\\" and that there were \\"near-plagiarism moments\\". All the character names were based on his friends. Over 80 percent of the dialogue was based on phrases frequently spoken by several Frazier Park residents. Much of the profanity in the script was taken from conversations overheard by costume designer Sarah Trost at parties, and what the Trost brothers thought of on set. Further inspiration for the dialogue came from Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Def Jam: Fight for NY, both of which Jason Trost played alongside Dance Dance Revolution. The settings in The FP were written using the materials that the Trosts' father had on his property due to the minimal budget. Jason Trost said he had seen several low-budget films that \\"try to be something they aren't\\" and did not want to feign the production value. When they are defeated in a dance-off, characters in the film die of a \\"187\\", which is slang for murder that originated from California Penal Code. The characters' actual causes of death are unexplained in the film. The Trost brothers found depicting the deaths as ambiguous funnier and believed it would remove doubts about the film being a comedy.  Casting  Jason Trost (JTRO), Lee Valmassy (L Dubba E), Brandon Barrera (BTRO), and James DeBello (Beat Box Busta Bill) reprised their roles from the original short film, while Diane Gaeta (Stacy), Kris Lemche (KCDC), and Torry Haynes (Sugga Nigga) were replaced with Caitlyn Folley, Art Hsu, and Bryan Goddard, respectively. Goddard was cast as a \\"rite of passage\\" for being a noteworthy resident of Frazier Park. Mike Sandow, who portrays Jody, originally had a larger part in the film but his scenes were almost entirely edited out for pacing reasons. Most of the cast were friends of the Trosts. James Remar, a friend of the Trosts since childhood, agreed to narrate the film's opening. The brothers had met Remar on the set of Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, on which their father Ron worked as the special effects supervisor. Brandon Trost knew Hsu and Clifton Collins, Jr. after working with them on Crank: High Voltage (2009) and invited them to join The FPs cast.  Costume design  alt=Sean Whalen in dim lighting, with heavy make-up around his eyes. He wears a light blue tank top with a pink scarf over it. His left nipple is exposed. Sarah Trost was the costume designer for The FP; she designed the costumes using fashions local to Frazier Park as her first influence. She was also inspired by the fashions of Elvis Presley, and the films Double Dragon, Rocky, Mad Max, The Warriors, 8 Mile, Escape from New York, X-Men, as well as the works of John Carpenter. Trost based the opposing gangs' outfits on American military uniforms of the American Civil War era. The 245's outfits were based on the uniforms of the Confederate Army, while the 248's outfits were based on those of the Union Army. The flags of the gangs were also based on those of the Confederacy and the Union. Trost designed the 245 costumes to look clean and the 248 costume to appear gritty. Most of the costumes were made from materials available to the crew; L Dubba E's costumes were made from jumpsuits. The boots worn by JTRO and BTRO were snow expedition boots. Most of the base clothing came from thrift stores, Sarah Trost's fabric storage, and the Trost's childhood clothing. Trost designed the costumes to be distinct from one another. JTRO and BTRO wear very similar costumes, the only noticeable difference being a color inversion. Both costumes had American flag-like emblems on the backs of their jackets, further enforcing the identification of the 248 with the Union. At the end of the film, JTRO takes BTRO's outfit, which required Trost to readjust it for the height difference between Jason Trost and Brandon Barrera, who portray JTRO and BTRO, respectively. As the film progresses, JTRO's color scheme changes from black and blue to military green to reflect his \\"becoming one with BLT\\". KCDC's costume design features ducks, referencing a speech in the film in which he notes the lack of ducks in the FP. Stacy and her father are both dressed to be somewhat transsexual, though it is more prominent in her father's character. Whalen told Trost he would wear anything as long as his nipple was exposed at all times. Stacy also wears an I Love New York shirt, with the words New York covered in duct tape and \\"The FP\\" written over it with a marker. CC Jam's costume was designed to be as colorful as possible to emulate rave culture.  Filming  Principal photography took place in Frazier Park, California, with a budget of $45,000. It began in September 2008 and lasted 20 days, most of which were spent on Ron Trost's property. Scenes set in BLT's house were filmed at the Trosts' childhood home, while the look of his basement was designed using the inside of a shipping container. Many set pieces were taken either from items Ron had collected or from other film sets. The Trost brothers split directorial duties between themselves; Brandon focused on visuals and Jason focused on the performances and story. Valmassy directed a driving scene featuring himself and Folley when the Trosts were briefly unavailable. A non-operational alt=A white and red Texaco gas station, with a chainlink fence surrounding it. There is a road in front of the station. Several planned filming locations were abandoned due to budget constraints. For thematic reasons, the film's penultimate fight scene between JTRO and L Dubba E was originally set at Dawn's Liquor Marta key location in the film. The store's owners refused permission for filming and the location was changed to a long-abandoned gas station. Bryan Goddard, who portrays Sugga Nigga, acquired permission for the crew to film on the property. The penultimate dance-off was filmed in three eight-minute long takes and edited down. Brandon Trost would \\"float around with the camera\\" while Valmassy and Jason Trost performed the dance-off sequence. While filming a tire training scene, Brandon asked Jason to increase the amount of spins he was performing. Jason broke his ankle and relied on his costume's snow boots as medical boots. Director of photography Brandon Trost shot The FP using digital cinematography with Canon XH-A1 cameras, which he had recently used while filming Crank: High Voltage. Using a single-camera setup, he filmed The FP using 35mm film to evoke the traditional look of films such as The Warriors and Total Recall. Trost ignored camera and lighting errors to make the film \\"feel genuine\\". Visual effects Visual effects artist Aaron Juntunen copied the visuals from the Beat-Beat Revelation dance tracks from Dance Dance Revolution by using computer graphics. The tracks were played live, allowing the actors to dance in unison. Visual effects were also used to cover the name of Dawn's Liquor Mart, as the actual location did not give the production permission to use its name and logo.  Music  George Holdcroft composed the score for The FP. He was invited to a screening of the film by producer Christian Agypt, and asked if he could compose the music for it. Holdcroft, who lived in Chicago at the time, spent 12 hours a day composing the score and e-mailed his compositions to the Trost brothers. To emulate the sound of a choir for one song, Holdcroft sang the same segment more than 200 times using different voices and melodies to achieve the desired result. For another song, he sang in falsetto and altered the pitch of his voice to make himself sound like a woman. Holdcroft had never played Dance Dance Revolution, though he was familiar with video game musicspecifically the compositions of Koji Kondo, the score of Final Fantasy, and the music of early Nintendo games. The film's soundtrack consists of 61 songs.  Release  alt=Seven of the filmmakers posing for a photo on the red carpet. The FP premiered on , 2011, at South by Southwest. It was later screened at several events, including the Fantasia Festival, the Lund International Fantastic Film Festival, the Philadelphia Film Festival, and Cinefamily.

Jordan Hoffman, writing for UGO Networks, gave it a B+, compared it to Black Dynamite, and wrote that it \\"is bursting with idiotic humor and in-your-face stoner wit\\". Eric Kohn of Indiewire also gave the film a B+, called it \\"loud, furious and recklessly funny\\", and mentioned the references to The Warriors, RoboCop, and Escape from New York. Scott Weinberg of Twitch Film echoed Hoffman's comparison to Black Dynamite. Weinberg said he \\"found quite a lot to enjoy\\" and praised the performances of Hsu, Valmassy, and Trost. Jacob Hall of Moviefone gave the film a positive review, praising Brandon Trost's cinematography and mentioned its similarities to Mad Max 2 and A Clockwork Orange. He commended the film's dedication to its \\"absolutely ludicrous premise\\" and called it \\"the rare 'ready-made cult hit' that actually works\\". Fred Topel of Screen Junkies predicted that the film \\"will be the Trosts' calling card\\" and praised it for being \\"exactly the kind of the movie [Topel] hope[s] to see at Fantastic Fest, or any film festival\\". Upon its theatrical release, The FP received mixed reviews from critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 48% approval rating, with an average rating of 5.2/10 based on 23 reviews. On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 based on reviews from critics, the film has a score of 48 based on 11 reviews, which is considered to be \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film a positive review, calling it \\"deadpan hilarious, a shameless satire of every teen gang, future-shock dystopian nightmare moviecombined with a brutal send-up of 8 Mile\\". Tom Keogh of The Seattle Times gave the film 2¬Ω stars out of 4; he praised its novelty and criticized its lack of \\"outright laughs\\". Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle gave the film 3 stars out of 5, saying it was \\"awash in silliness\\" and calling it a \\"potential cult-movie masterpiece\\". Angela Watercutter of Wired called it an \\"instant cult classic\\" and also compared it to 8 Mile, Rocky and The Karate Kid. Shawn Anthony Levy, writing for The Oregonian, gave the film a B; he praised its eccentricity and said, \\"It's very hard not to admire its zealous commitment to its ethos\\". In a mixed review, Peter Debruge of Variety praised Brandon Trost's cinematography but said the film \\"plays its boilerplate premise with endearing earnestness, but runs thin in no time\\". Matt Hawkins of Kotaku called it a \\"legit goofball comedy\\" and said it \\"speaks to gamers without flat-out insulting them\\". Michael Phillips, writing for the Chicago Tribune, gave the film 2 stars out of 4, praising its premise and filming technique while criticizing its \\"sometimes funny execution\\". Conversely, Andy Webster of The New York Times said, \\"Its bargain- basement production values and lack of wit unexpectedly prove a greater liability than an asset\\". Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times criticized its characters, costumes, and dialogue; he said it \\"so desperately wants to be cultishly admired ... that it forgets to be genuinely offbeat or funny\\". Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club gave the film a C+, mentioning the influences of John Carpenter, The Warriors, Mad Max 2, and A Clockwork Orange, and criticizing Jason Trost's performance. He said the film was \\"a junky, disposable lark, created for a midnight audience to swallow, belch, and forget about the next morning\\". Nick Schager of Slant Magazine gave it 1¬Ω stars out of 4, and called it a \\"humorless void\\" and a \\"wannabe cult hit\\". Eric Hynes of The Village Voice said, \\"the film's charm fades fast\\" and , \\"[t]he problem with paying such dogged homage to shitty movies is that integrity is best achieved by producing a shitty movie in turn. Mission accomplished, for whatever that's worth.\\" Ethan Gilsdorf of The Boston Globe gave the film 1 star out of 4, saying it was not \\"obliviously dreadful enough to be 'so bad it's good'\\". Christy Lemire of the Associated Press echoed this opinion, giving it 1 star out of 4; she said the film is \\"just plain badand boring, and repetitive\\" and that \\"as comedy, it just feels numbing\\". Max Nicholson of IGN said the film \\"is by no means the worst thing I've ever seen\\", but that it \\"should have been a three-minute sketch on Funny or Die\\".  Home media  Image Entertainment released The FP on DVD, Blu-ray Disc, video on demand, and digital download on June 19, 2012. The feature was accompanied by a making-of featurette, interviews with costume designer Sarah Trost and composer George Holdcroft, audio commentary by the Trost brothers, and a special edition collectors' booklet with introductions by Rob Zombie, Brian Taylor, and Mark Neveldine. Four special editions were made available for purchase on Drafthouse Films' website, all of which contain Holdcroft's soundtrack and a 720p HD digital download. Additional items sold include a Blu-ray or DVD copy of the film, a poster signed by the Trost brothers, a model of L Dubba E's grill, and a tampon in a glass tube signed by the Trost brothers.  Sequel  According to Jason Trost, two sequels to The FP have been planned, the first of which would involve going to Hong Kong. He said the first sequel would take place five years after the original and would feature more dancing and a Beat-Beat Revelation tournament. He also compared the sequel's plot to that of Escape from L.A. Trost also teased the possibility of a fourth film to come when he was older, comparing it to Rocky Balboa. In August 2013, Trost said that both he and the film's investors had not received any money from The FP, and \\"probably never will\\". He further stated that it was challenging \\"to figure out a way to get people to fund a sequel to a movie that recouped zero dollars\\". Trost started an Indiegogo fundraising campaign seeking $100,000 in February 2016, revealing the title to be Beats of Rage: The FP Part II. The campaign received over $19,000 in donations by its end, with the amount raised below the fundraising goal to finish a third of the film. In July 2017, Trost started another Indiegogo campaign to finish the film, now titled Beats of Rage: The FP 2. The first thirty minutes of the film had already been shot at the time of the posting, and the fundraising goal was set at $20,000, which was surpassed with over $34,000 donated. In April 2018, a synopsis and poster were released for the film, now simply titled Beats of Rage. The film follows the events of The FP, and features Trost, Hsu, Barrera, and Principe reprising their roles from the first film, alongside new cast members Mike O'Gorman, Tallay Wickham, and Bru Miller. Beats of Rage will again feature JTRO and KCDC trying to save the world from an alcohol withdrawal by competing in the titular Beat-Beat Revelation tournament against AK-47, the leader of The Wastes. Trost also said that the film will debut at \\"a major U.S. genre festival\\" in October 2018. The film premiered at Fantastic Fest on September 22, 2018, again retitled FP2: Beats of Rage.

She is known for still lifes, mostly of flowers, and fruits.

At length her father saw that this daughter, Gerardina‚Äîfor he had numerous daughters, and they all desired to be artists‚Äîhad talent, and when, in 1850, the Minerva Academy at Groningen gave out \\"Roses and Dahlias\\" as a subject, and offered a prize of a little more than ten dollars for the best example, he encouraged Gerardina to enter the contest.

In 1880 she sent paintings to the Melbourne International Exhibition (1880). Consequently she received a letter from an art collector on the other side of the world who later ordered a painting- on 2 Nov 1881, she wrote \\"Dear Sir, By the kindness of Capt.Schagen van Leeuwin, I have received this week your letter and I am much pleased that you approved of my paintings\\" and in 1882, \\"Dear Sir, I have the pleasure to write to you that I have sent away the three pictures you wished me to make for you,I have sent them to Mr.Ploos van Amstel who will have the kindness of delivering them to you.\\" In Amsterdam she participated in the International Colonial and Export Exhibition in 1883. Several years later she exhibited at the Palace of Fine Arts for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. Gerardine van de Sande Bakhuyzen died at the Hague in 1895.

Education Lisa Oppenheim was born in New York City in the year of 1975. She earned her Bachelor's degree from Brown University in 1998, concentrating in Modern Culture and Media, Art and Semiotics. In 2001, she earned her MFA in Film and Video from Milton Avery Graduate School of the Arts, Bard College. She completed a Whitney Museum Independent Study Program in 2003. She also completed the Rijksakademie van beeldedne kunsten in Amsterdam from 2004-2006. Work Oppenheim's work plays with the process of creating photographs and film. Her pieces often question the documentary genre as well as the concept of an archives. In utilizing archival sources, she interrogates and reappropriates the archival function of narrative-making and -omitting, and how narrative and imagery are intertwined but ultimately separate. In work such as Lunagrams, 2010, in which she exposed archival glass negatives using moonlight, Oppenheim experiments with time as a force of art and imagery. She has done works in fiber arts which is art created using strings, ropes and fabric. Her works in fiber arts were displayed in her Gramma exhibition at Tanya Bonakdar Gallery. Oppenheim has had the honor of many solo and group exhibitions at international venues including the Guggenheim Museum, Museum of Modern Art and the New Museum in New York City, the FRAC Champagne-Ardenne in France, Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Spain, the Museum of Modern Art of Republika Srpska in Bosnia, and the Royal Academy of Arts in London.

In 2007, she was appointed Deputy Chairman and CEO HSBC Bank Malaysia Berhad. In 2011, Dorner was appointed to run the US operations of HSBC. At the helm of HSBC during 2013's money laundering scandal, she's said \\"One of the things that I am trying to get through to our entire bank is I would rather you walked away from a piece of business that has a question mark next to it than do it in order to boost your bottom line.

Her art practice is primarily research-based and often takes the form of installation, video, photographs and audio. She received her BFA from Concordia University (2003), her post-graduate diploma in Critical Studies from the Malm√∂ Art Academy (2005) and is a graduate of the Whitney Independent Study Program. Themes Some of the themes that surface in Nguyen's work include resistance, power, and feminism. Many of her projects look at how histories are recorded within archival records and reclaim narratives of activism and citizen-led solidarity networks. As such, her work often creates new archives or explores existing archives, including Making of an Archive which explores the everyday of immigrants to Canada and looking at the work of Olive Morris, as a member of the Remembering Olive Collective (ROC). Works In her 25-channel sound installation For An Epidemic Resistance (2009), Nguyen explores a laughing epidemic which took place in 1962 in Tanganyika. In an article which appeared in Fuse Magazine in 2013, Amber Berson wrote that \\"the outbreak of laughter [...] lasted for six months and first occurred at a mission-run boarding school for [...] we can choose to read the girls' laughter as a form of resistance against their patriarchal society and the colonizers at their mission-run institution [...] Yet the girls' weapon ‚Äì laughter ‚Äì eventually shut down the school (and other institutions), proving it an effective means of resistance, which Nguyen celebrates in her piece.\\" Another work, Space Fiction & the Archives (2012), deals with the Canadian centennial celebrations of 1967 and the incident of a Martian landing pad created to welcome UFOs to St. Paul, Alberta. Nguyen \\"posits a relationship between science fiction and multiculturalism.\\" Her work is highly researched, but also involves an element of storytelling. Nguy·ªÖn's project, The Wages Dues Song (2016) takes up the work of The Wages Dues Collective, a feminist collective formed in 1974 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, which was linked to the Wages for housework movement in the US. The work appeared as part of the recent exhibition The Let Down Reflex, which ran from January 30 ‚Äì March 12, 2016 at EFA Project Space in New York. Jacqueline Ho√†ng Nguy·ªÖn's work has been exhibited at The New Gallery, MAI (Montr√©al, arts interculturels), Momenta Art, Kunstverein Braunschweig, VOX: Centre de l‚Äôimage contemporaine, the MTL BNL, A Space, Apexart, PAVED Arts, Or Gallery, and the Philadelphia Institute of Contemporary Art. In addition to her work as an artist, Nguyen is also a curator, a writer, and an educator. Her work is included in several public and private collections in Canada, Sweden, and the United States, including the NARS Foundation (Brooklyn, US). Nguy·ªÖn's project The Making of an Archive was initiated in 2014 at Gendai Gallery, in Toronto, with curator Maiko Tanaka. The Making of an Archive is a grassroots archival project aimed at capturing images of everyday life of the immigrant experience in Canada. The project involved digitization workshops where the artist invited immigrants and their families, who identify as persons of colour, to scan their photographs and ephemera. The project continued in 2017 at grunt gallery in Vancouver. Although the project is described as ongoing, a publication dedicated to the project was published by grunt gallery in 2018.

It consists of the Triploblasts/Bilateria as well as the Placozoa and Cnidaria.  Characteristics  The Parahoxozoa group was defined based on the presence of several gene (sub)classes (HNF, CUT, PROS, ZF, CERS, K50, S50-PRD), as well as Hox/ParaHox-ANTP from which the name of this clade originated. It was later proposed and contested that a gene of the same class (ANTP) as the Hox/ParaHox, the NK gene and the Cdx Parahox gene, is also present in Porifera. Nevertheless, the Parahoxozoa as originally defined without Porifera may be a monophyletic clade, and continues to be used as such. The position of Placozoa is not clear, as it may be sister the remaining Parahoxozoa (the Planulozoa hypothesis) or sister to the Cnidaria.  Planula- acoel, triploblasty, and bilaterian similarities  The original bilateria are hypothesized to be a bottom dwelling worm with a single body opening. A through-gut may already have developed with the ctenophora however. The through-gut may have developed from the corners of a single opening with lips fusing. E.g. Acoela resemble the planula larvae of some cnidaria, which exhibit some bilaterian symmetry. They are vermiformes, just as the cnidarian Buddenbrockia is. Placozoa has been noted to resemble planula. Usually, \\"Planulozoa\\" is to the exclusion of Placozoa, but not necessarily. In this case it appears synonymous with ParaHoxozoa.

The system was based on charters or hawakir (singular hakura) issued by the sultan entitling one to ownership of a certain estate, usually as a freehold, sometimes as fiefs in exchange for tribute or rent. The possessors of hawakir were usually wealthy aristocrats, while most the estates granted were worked by slaves or bondservants. A distinction can be made between the demesne lands of the estate-holder, whose slaves he personally owned, and the rest of the hakura, from whose inhabitants he exacted tribute and who owned their own slaves. The hakura system was introduced to Darfur during the reign of Kuuru, the second sultan of the Keira dynasty. When the itinerant court finally settled down around El Fasher towards 1790, the land around the capital was gradually given out to courtiers through hawakir. In exchange these landholders were responsible for tax collection on their estates, which were the most heavily taxed in the country. The right to employ nomads as herders was sometimes granted to hakura holders. After the conquest of Darfur in 1916, the Anglo-Egyptian government abolished the hakura system and abolished slavery, effecting \\"the release of Sudanese servants\\".

Whitmarsh received an MFA from the University of New Orleans and a BFA from the Kansas City Art Institute, both in painting. Working predominantly with textiles, Whitmarsh uses hand-stitched embroidery to fabricate replicas of personal and cultural ephemera. Her embroidered canvases and soft sculptures reference contemporary pop culture and the 1970s and '80s eras of her childhood. Her most recent body of work, Fabricated Revisions, consists of \\"imagined, handmade revisions\\" of past covers of prominent art magazines, featuring female artists who were overlooked at the time. About this body of work, Whitmarsh notes, \\"The way that I am interested in feminism is the way I am interested in many things. It's something peripheral to my view that influences my vision rather than being a focus. I am interested in watching the process of feminism rather than trying to locate it. I don't believe I could locate it‚Ä¶ The artists I find compelling are mostly women and I decided to pay tribute to this personal fact. Many of these works are from a fictionalized past. From 1970-1980, Artforum devoted 5 of its 99 covers to women artists.\\" Whitmarsh has shown her work internationally, including solo exhibitions at New Image Art, Jack Hanley (NY), Elaine Levy Project (Brussels), Kling & Bang Gallery (Reykjavik), Krets Galleri (Malmo), and Katherine Mulherin Contemporary Art Projects (Toronto), among others. Her work has been included in group shows at the Z√ºrich Museum of Design, Wolfsonian Museum (at Art Basel Miami Beach), Galerie Libraire (Hong Kong), White Columns and Gavin Brown's Enterprise as part of the Drunk vs. Stoned show. In 1996 Whitmarsh began creating merchandise under the moniker \\"Tiny Industries\\", self-publishing Snow Monkey comic books, producing puppet shows and 6mm stop action short films as well as making hand- embroidered wallets and bags. Since 2006, Tiny Industries has been on hiatus due to the demands of Whitmarsh's fine art career. In 2010, Whitmarsh was commissioned by Amy Sedaris to do the embroidery for \\"Simple Times, Crafts for Poor People\\". She was also commissioned by David Byrne to embroider the cover artwork of his \\"Ride Rise Roar\\" tour DVD. Todd Oldham has used two of her drawings for paint-by-numbers sets in his Kid Made Modern line of craft and art projects for children. In 2018 Hammer Museum curators announced that Whitmarsh would be one of the 32 artists included in the fourth edition of the Made in LA biennial, scheduled from June 3 to September 2, 2018.

She has discussed in lectures that she is a descendant of Black American enslaved individuals on all sides of her lineage as well as European American colonizers and Indigenous Americans through the institution of American Slavery. Her body of work spans photography, performance, painting, video, sound, sculpture, and installation. Her studio practice is rooted in an ongoing investigation of sensory experience, memory, and abstraction within present and future histories‚Äîspecifically shifting notions surrounding landscape‚Äîas cyclical versus linear. Simmons is committed to the examination of different artistic modes and processes; she may dedicate part of a year to photography, another part to performance, and other parts to installation, video, and sound work. As of 2019, Simmons is a visiting Professor and lecturer and the Inaugural Solomon Fellow at Harvard University. Education Simmons received her BFA from Bard College in 2004, studying under An-My L√™, Larry Fink, Mitch Epstein, Luc Santeand Stephen Shore. She completed the Whitney Museum of American Art‚Äôs Independent Study Program in Studio Art in 2005, while simultaneously completing a two-year actor-training conservatory with The Maggie Flanigan Studio. Simmons's work has been exhibited at international institutions including Museum of Modern Art (New York), MoMA PS1 (Long Island City, New York), Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, Studio Museum in Harlem (New York), Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, Walker Art Center (Minneapolis), the P√©rez Art Museum Miami, and the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston. In 2017, Simmons had a solo exhibition of her work at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University. To complement her practice as a visual artist, Simmons has also studied aspects of midwifery and herbalism. Works/Shows=2019 She was in exhibitions such as the \\"Live Dangerously\\" exhibition at the National Museum for Women in the Arts, the Platform section (large scale works) of the 25th Armory Show 2019, \\"Xaviera Simmons: Sundown\\" at David Castillo Gallery, in \\"When Home Won't Let You Stay\\" at the Institute of Contemporary Art/Boston. She is outspoken in the art world beyond her visual practice, writing a critical comment article for The Art Newspaper entitled \\"Whiteness must undo itself to make way for the truly radical turn in contemporary culture\\" and pulling out as a panelist at a New Museum festival when local Bronx organizers shut it down with their concerns. Her article was quoted (with her permission) in artist William Powhida's first solo art exhibition in five years at Postmasters Gallery.  Convene (2018): Organized by SculptureCenter  Simmons's sculpture has been displayed at the Hunter's point south park in Queens. Along the shore of the East River, there are multiple canoes overturned, with their backs painted in bright colors. The colors she uses represent the flags of the nations of the immigrant communities that live in Queens, making it one of the most diverse boroughs of New York City. Keeping in mind the Trump administration, this piece takes on more relevance. Xaviera Simmons: Coded (2016)  Coded was a survey exhibition at The Kitchen. In relation to the exhibition, Simmons also created a performance work that uses archival materials and resources to explore queer history, homoeroticism, and Jamaican dancehall culture. Xaviera Simmons: Underscore (2013‚Äì14) Drawing on Simmons's practice as a multidisciplinary artist, Underscore was staged at The Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, where she presented two photographs, a slide installation, and a site-specific performance titled Number 17. Each of these components drew upon elements of both live and recorded music: the photographs Warm Leatherette (2009) and Horse (2009) used familiar LP covers as masks for her characters, the slide installation Into the Rehearsal were digitzed manipulations of low-resolution images from Jamaican dance-hall footage (the popular form of dance called daggering is specifically referenced) pooled from the Internet, and Number 17 transformed the museum's Opatrny Gallery into a space for Simmons to construct improvised visual/sound performances coupled with high-endurance practices and action painting.http://www.aldrich.org/exhibitions/Simmons.php Archive As Impetus: Artists Experiment (2013) Simmons was a participant in the Artists Experiment series at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. She acted as both artist and archivist, tracing the museum's own history, while extracting and reinstating examples of political action through gesture. Index Series (2013) Simmons's Index series captured images of quasi-human torsos oriented at eye level: these forms were composed of ephemera such as rosaries, postcards, crushed photographs, and jewelry scraps, funneled into pairs of blue jeans and printed leggings. These works are, effectively, stills of constructed bodies bearing traces of the real world, but inhabiting a unique space just beyond it.

Thundersnow Road (2010) Commissioned by the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University as part of their 2010 exhibition The Record: Contemporary Art and Vinyl, Simmons collaborated with a group of artists to produce a hybrid landscape photography-music installation. Simmons traveled and explored the varying topographies of North Carolina over a ten-day period; the images she took would serve as \\"album covers\\" for songs recorded by artists such as My Morning Jacket's Jim James, Superchunk's Mac McCaughan, and TV On the Radio members Kyp Malone, Tunde Adebimpe, and Jaleel Bunton. Durham-based record label Merge Records served as the music producer.http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2010/09/16/simmons-speaks- record#.VQhbblr3bCR Bronx As Studio (2008) Public Art Fund's program for emerging artists, In the Public Realm, commissioned Simmons to produce a three-week project in June 2008, using the streets of the Bronx as a space for sidewalk games, classic photographic portraiture, and performance art. Passersby were encouraged to participate in various activities including hopscotch, soapbox speaking, chess, and Double Dutch. Simmons provided props and background elements, against which all of the publics' spontaneous activities were recorded. Color portraits were sent directly back to participants, as a way of completing the process of active, creative participation.

Hughes is a multimedia interdisciplinary artist, using performance, photography, print making, text, video, curating and collaboration as media for artistic expression. Education Hughes was an undergraduate at Hampshire College, from which she graduated in 1999. In 2002, she completed the Independent Study Program at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Hughes received an MFA in Interdisciplinary Studio from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2006. LTTR In 2002 Hughes helped co-found the feminist genderqueer artist collective and annual literary journal Lesbians To The Rescue (LTTR), which remained an active part of the queer art theory community until 2008. LTTR was dedicated to \\"highlighting the work of radical communities whose goals are sustainable change, queer pleasure, and critical feminist productivity.\\" The other co-founders of the collective are Ginger Brooks Takahashi and K8 Hardy. Ecstatic resistance Hughes developed the concept \\"ecstatic resistance\\" in 2009 to talk about the impossible and imaginary in politics. In her essay on the topic, Hughes says, \\"Ecstatic Resistance is a project, practice, partial philosophy and set of strategies. It develops the positionality of the impossible alongside a call to re-articulate the imaginary. Ecstatic Resistance is about the limits of representation and legibility ‚Äî the limits of the intelligible, and strategies that undermine hegemonic oppositions. It wants to talk about pleasure in the domain of resistance ‚Äî sexualizing modern structures in order to centralize instability and plasticity in life, living, and the self. It is about waiting, and the temporality of change. Ecstatic Resistance wants to think about all that is unthinkable and unspeakable in the Eurocentric, phallocentric world order.\\" In addition to her essay being published in Grand Arts and Toronto's C Magazine, the project also was inclusive of a \\"practice, partial philosophy, set of strategies, and group exhibition(s)\\" that were all organized and curated by Hughes. The two simultaneous sister shows were exhibited at Grand Arts (Nov. 13 - Jan. 16, 2010) and X Initiative in NYC (Nov. 21 - Feb. 6, 2010) and incorporated the art and performance of Yael Bartana, Sharon Hayes, Matthew Lutz-Kinoy, My Barbarian, Jeanine Oleson, Ulrike Ottinger, Adrian Piper, Dean Spade and Craig Willse, A.L. Steiner, Rosa Barba, Juan Davila, Xylor Jane, My Barbarian in collaboration with Liudni Slibinai, Ulrike Muller, A.L. Steiner, Joyce Wieland, Leah Gilliam, Julianna Snapper, PIG/ Politically Involved Girls (Wu Ingrid Tsang, Zackary Drucker, and Mariana Marroquin), and Ian White. In the New York Times review of the exhibition, Roberta Smith wrote that \\"Ms. Roysdon‚Äôs title connotes a spirit of Zen activism, with absurdity substituting for ideology, but with politics still in the picture.\\" Other collaborations Hughes's many other collaborations include costume design for choreographers Levi Gonzalez, Vanessa Anspaugh and Faye Driscoll, as well as lyric writing for The Knife, and JD Samson & MEN. Solo projects Recent solo projects include new commissions from Performance Room, Tate Modern (London), If I Can't Dance (Amsterdam), PICA's T:BA festival, Visual Art Center (Austin), Art in General (NY), The Kitchen (NY), Konsthall C (Stockholm) and a Matrix commission from the Berkeley Art Museum.

Background At nineteen in 1849, in Leon, France, Marie married Louis Adolphe Guiraud (pronounced GARO), who was seven years her senior. After a number of years in their native country, the Guirauds came to the United States through the port of New Orleans, Louisiana, where they remained for a month. They settled first in Cincinnati, Ohio, and then Leavenworth, Kansas. When a friend offered to pay his expenses, Adolphe came to the Colorado gold fields, where he opened a general store. He was likely in Hamilton when Park County was created as one of the first seventeen counties of the new state. Adolphe staked out 640 acres in Park County through the Homestead Act of 1862. He sold hay in Leadville for $80 per ton. On the homestead, he planted about forty-five acres in oats, wheat, rye, potatoes, and vegetables. After a year on the homestead and the accidental death of 10-year-old son Henry, the family moved to Denver. After another year in Denver, they had returned to the ranch. Another Guiraud store in Park County failed because Adolphe extended credit too leniently to customers. Woman rancher After Adolphe died in 1875 at the age of fifty- three, the widowed Marie took over their modest homestead. The couple had ten children, three of whom predeceased Adolphe. The remaining seven children ranged in age from 2-year-old Ernest to 25-year-old Louis. During her 34-year widowhood, Marie lost two other children. Oldest son Louis was struck by lightning in 1888 at the age of thirty-eight. Daughter Eugenia G. Spurlock died in 1908 at the age of forty-two from a lengthy illness. In time the Guiraud spread grew from the 640 acres to four ranches on five thousand acres. The ranch was worth $200,000 ($5.1 million in 2013 currency) when Marie died. She may have also had gold in the amount of $6 million in 2013 value.Laura King Van Dusen, \\"Marie Guiraud: 1860s Pioneer, Mother of Ten, Widowed at Forty-five, Amassed One of the Largest Estates in Park County Up to 1909\\", Historic Tales from Park County: Parked in the Past (Charleston, South Carolina: The History Press, 2013), , pp. 15-20. In her obituary published in The Flume, the newspaper of Park County based in the county seat of Fairplay, her holdings were said to be \\"very nearly as great, if not the equal, of the largest estate ever built up in Park County.\\"The Flume, Fairplay, Colorado, June 11, 1909 Guiraud's steers averaged 1,200 pounds; some weighed 1,800 pounds. She sold at four cents per pound ($1 million in 2013 value). She also raised horses; in 1892, she shipped two carloads of horses by train to Chicago. Guiraud had exclusive use of Trout Creek as a source of water for her ranch. When she learned that a railroad would pass within fifty feet of her ranch, she formed the now ghost town of Garo, the American pronunciation of the family name. In 1906, Guiraud's house burned down; she built a ten-room, one-story dwelling valued at $3,000 ($80,000 in 2013). Upon her paralysis and death of a possible stroke, the six heirs divided $60,000 in cash ($1.5 million in 2013 value), the proceeds from four ranches, and the water rights. There was no mention in the probate of any gold holdings. Youngest child Ernest was executor of the estate. In 1913, four years after Marie Guiraud's death, the United States Department of Agriculture for the first time acknowledged the important role that women played on farms and ranches. In its annual Yearbook, the department stated: > The woman on the farm is a most important economic factor in agriculture. > Her domestic work undoubtedly has a direct bearing on the efficiency of the > field workers, her handling of the home ... contributes to the cash intake, > and, in addition, hers is largely the responsibility for contributing the > social and other features which make farm life satisfactory and pleasurable. > On her, rests largely the moral and mental development of the children, and > on her attitude depends in great part the important question of whether the > succeeding generation will continue to farm or will seek the allurements of > life in the cities. In 2013, the former Guiraud estate, known as Buffalo Peaks Ranch, was owned by the city of Aurora and operated as a residential library in which patrons can stay overnight on the property while doing research into ranch-related topics. The ranch is located on Colorado State Highway 9 near Garo between Fairplay and Hartsel, a community named for Samuel Hartsel, one of Guiraud's neighboring ranchers who subsequently left Park County for Denver. Guiraud is included in the book Extraordinary Women of the Rocky Mountain West, edited by Tim Blevins.

She made contributions to the research of radioactive materials, determining that radioactivity could not be destroyed by heat or ionization due to chemical reactions, and that radioactive materials differ from phosphorescent materials both qualitatively and quantitatively. More specifically, Gates showed that the emission of blue light from quinine was temperature dependent, providing evidence that the emitted light is produced from phosphorescence rather than radioactive decay. She also served as head of the Physics department at Goucher, Professor of Physics and Dean of Women at Grinnell College, and the Dean of Women at the University of Illinois. Education and career Gates received her B.S. from Northwestern University in 1894 and her M.A. in 1895, and finally her Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1909. She published two papers during graduate school on the subject of radioactivity. From 1895-1897, she was a scholar and fellow in mathematics at Bryn Mawr College, where she received a President's European Fellowship. In the fall of 1897 she attended the University of G√∂ttingen to further her studies in mathematics and physics; and in the winter of 1898, furthered her studies at the Polytechnik Institute at Zurich. Gates returned to the U.S. in 1898 to accept a position at the Women's College of Baltimore (Goucher University), where she ordered in advance of her arrival, additional physics equipment to build her lab to study spectra and X-rays. She remained at Goucher for 13 years, leaving in 1911 to work for the University of Chicago. From 1902-1903 she took a leave of absence from Goucher and worked with Ernest Rutherford and Harriet Brooks at McGill University, Montreal, where her research on radioactivity continued, proving that radioactive phenomena were not simple chemical or physical processes. In 1905, Gates worked with J.J. Thomson, her research continued to support her reputation in the scientific community. In 1911, Gates left her position at Goucher in Baltimore to accept a research position at the University of Chicago. Two years after that she was offered a Professor of Physics and Dean of Women position at Grinnell College in Iowa. She continued in this role for three years before moving to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1916, where she held the position of Associate Professor of Physics and Dean of Women for two years, and served on the policy and planning committee of the university.CHF There is controversy on the subject of Gates' exit from her position at the University of Illinois, while some sources suggest that Gates was fired by the University for problems relating to drug use, others argue that she faced a great deal of difficulty with the school administration, either due to an inclination for research as opposed to administrative work, or due to discriminatory practices. After 1918, Gates largely retired to the private sector, serving as the General Secretary for the YMCA of New York (1918-1919, 1921-1922), and teaching at two private schools in New York and Bryn Mawyr, before retiring entirely to research work after a final stint as a physics teacher at Roycenmore School in Evanson, Illinois (1928-1931).  Contributions to physics = Effect of Heat on Excited Radioactivity  Published in 1903, this paper expands on the work that Gates did with Ernest Rutherford and Harriet Brooks. This paper explains in detail a series of experiments Gates performed under the direction of Rutherford examining the relationship between heat and excited radioactive particles, concluding with 4 distinct observations. # Excited radioactivity cannot be destroyed by heat. # Active particles are removed from wires (primarily platinum in the detailed experiments) at a temperature just below white heat, and are transferred unchanged to the surfaces of the cooler solids nearby. # By removing the surrounding gas as fast as the wire is heated, a majority of radioactive particles can be carried off with it. # The removal of the excited radioactivity from the wire is probably due to a volatilization of the radioactive material.  On the Nature of Certain Radiations from the Sulphate of Quinine  While under the supervision of Ernest Rutherford in 1903, Gates also researched the phosphorescent and conductive properties of quinine, and whether these properties are also present in other radioactive substances. This work was based on that of Le Bon, and detailed a series of experiments detailing the effects of various tests on samples of heated quinine and comparing them to known tests on the known properties of other radioactive materials, resulting in 5 distinct conclusions. # Radiation from quinine is only apparent when accompanied by great temperature change, is inconsistent during the change, and ends shortly after the temperature change. Temperature change does not affect the rate of discharge of electricity between plates exposed to the radiations from the active elements, and the radiation from said plates does not deteriorate appreciably with time. # Maximum ionization cannot be reached with quinine radiations even in a strong magnetic field, while a comparatively weak field will have this effect on radium and other active elements. # Quinine radiations are largely absorbed in 2‚Äì3 mm of air, and can be absorbed far sooner than that, while even the least penetrating radiations from the active elements will pass through at least several cm of air with no appreciable loss in intensity. # Quinine radiation can be completely blocked with a very thin sheet of aluminum, which does not affect the rays of uranium, radium, or thorium. # While the rate of ionization due to radon radiation is independent of the direction of the field they are generated in, ionization from quinine radiation changes dramatically when the field is reversed. Using these conclusions, Gates was able to assert that ionization from quinine radiation is completely different from that of active elements, resulting from molecular actions rather than he spontaneous projection of charged masses from the atom.  The Conductivity of the Air Due to the Sulphate of Quinine  In 1909, Gates researched and published this thesis, also known as The conductivity of air caused by certain chemical changes, on the affect that heated quinine has on conductivity. In this paper Gates thoroughly researched the phenomenon where heating quinine raised the conductivity of the surrounding air in a series of controlled tests, expanding on her previous work in On the nature of certain radiations from the sulphate of quinine. Gates eventually concluded that while quinine did indeed have the reported effect on air conductivity, several other compounds are present in the sulphate solution that the initial concept was based on, which would have a small interfering affect as the heating process progressed. Death Fanny Gates continued to work until her passing in Chicago on February 24, 1931. While the cause of her death was either undetermined or unreported, like many early scientists working with radioactive materials, it has been written that her death may have been due to a radiation-related disease.

William was the son of Gabriele Rossetti and his wife Frances Polidori. His siblings were: Maria, Dante Gabriel and Christina. They honeymooned in France and Naples, Italy, in April 1874. They attempted to live with William's family but, due to religious differences with Frances and Christina, who were devout Anglo-Catholics, moved out to their own accommodation in Bloomsbury by the end of 1876.Roe, Dinah The Rossettis in Wonderland. A Victorian Family History,(London: Haus Publishing, 2011, pp. 277-280 Their first child, Olivia Frances Madox, was born in September 1875, and their son, Gabriel Arthur, was born in February 1877, followed by Helen Maria, in November 1879, and twins, Mary Elizabeth and Michael Ford, in April 1881. Michael died in infancy. Lucy and Wiliam, who both were agnostics, did not have their children baptized. The children were schooled at home by their mother and governesses. In 1897, Olivia married an Italian anarchist refugee, Antonio Agresti. They later moved to Italy, where Olivia became a translator and writer. After she was widowed in 1926, she became an associate of Ezra Pound, and the two corresponded frequently. Gabriel Arthur, known as Arthur to the family, became a scientist, married Dora Lewis, and had several children. Helen became a painter of miniatures, and in 1903 married Gastone Angeli. He was in fragile health and died only a few months later. Helen gave birth to his posthumous daughter, Imogen Lucy, in 1904. Artistic and literary career The Duet by Lucy Madox Brown (1870) She began painting in 1868, and along with her half sister Catherine, modelled and worked as an assistant under their father. Other female Pre-Raphaelite artists such as Georgiana Burne-Jones, the sister of Thomas Seddon and Marie Spartali Stillman also took lessons in the same studio. Working mainly in watercolours, she exhibited in Dudley Museum and Art Gallery from 1869 to 1872.Gaze, Delia, Dictionary of Women Artists, Volume 1, (London: Routledge, 1997) , p. 324 Her painting, The Duet, which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1870,Thirlwell, Angela, Into The Frame: The Four Loves of Ford Madox Brown (London: Chatto & Windus, 2010), p. 139 was described by Dante Gabriel Rossetti as a \\"perfect picture\\". She stopped painting in 1874. She wrote the biography of Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, Mrs. Shelley, for John Ingram's Eminent Women series and it was published in 1890. Death From 1885 she suffered from consumption and went to Italy for her health during the winter. The illness worsened Lucy's temper and brought the permanent rift between her and William. Rossetti was deeply affected by Lucy's alienation: \\"This change in my relations of affection and home-life is about the most painful thing that could have occurred to me.\\"Peattie, Roger W., Selected Letters of William Michael Rossetti (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1990), p. xxviii She died on 12 April 1894 at the Hotel Victoria in Sanremo, Italy, in the presence of her husband and her daughter Olivia, and was buried in La Foce Cemetery.

The Manuscrit du Roi or Chansonnier du Roi (\\"King's Manuscript\\" or \\"King's Songbook\\" in English) is a prominent songbook compiled towards the middle of the thirteenth century, probably between 1255 and 1260 and a major testimony of European medieval music. It is currently French manuscript no.844 of the Biblioth√®que nationale de France. It is known by various sigla, depending on which of its contents are the focus of study: it is troubadour manuscript W, trouv√®re manuscript M, and motet manuscript R. It was first published by French musicologist Pierre Aubry in 1907 (\\"Les plus anciens textes de musique instrumentale au Moyen Age\\"). Background The manuscript contains more than 600 songs composed for the most part between the late twelfth and early thirteenth century. Some were written by famous trouv√®res, such as Theobald I of Navarre, Gace Brul√©, Guiot de Dijon or Richard de Fournival, but others are anonymous. It contains as an addendum a booklet of songs by King Theobald I of Navarre, sometimes known as manuscript Mt. Around 85% of its material is French, while only 61 songs are by troubadours, in a Frenchified form of Occitan. Of these, 51 have music. The songbook has close associations with the Principality of the Morea and was most likely created as a gift for William of Villehardouin, Prince of Achaea by Charles of Anjou, the King of Naples and William's father-in-law. By around 1270, it was in Charles's possession. Today, the state of conservation of the collection is bad. Eighteen pages have are missing and several decorative initials have been cut out, but it remains a major testimony of medieval music.

The anion contains aluminium tetrahedrally surrounded by four perchlorate groups. The perchlorate is covalently bonded to the aluminium, but perchlorate is much more well known as an ion. The covalent bond to aluminium distorts the perchlorate and renders it unstable. Related chemicals are the haloperchloroatoaluminates, where there is one perchloro group attached to aluminium, and three halogens such as chlorine (chloroperchloroatoaluminates) or bromine (bromoperchloroatoaluminates). Formation Nitronium tetraperchloratoaluminate is made from exact amounts of nitronium perchlorate and anhydrous aluminium chloride combined in liquid sulfur dioxide. Ammonium tetraperchloratoaluminate can be formed by three moles of nitronium perchlorate, one mole of anhydrous aluminium chloride, and one mole of ammonium perchlorate combined in liquid sulfur dioxide. Properties The tetraperchloratoaluminates are yellowish crystalline solids. They are stable up to 50 ¬∞C. Above this temperature they decompose to hexaperchloratoaluminates which are more temperature stable.

One of the most important examples of such curves is hyperelliptic curves in characteristic 2, whose Jacobian varieties have been suggested for use in cryptography. It is common to write these curves in the form :y^2 + h(x) y = f(x) for some polynomials f and h.  Definition  More generally, an Artin-Schreier curve defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p is a branched covering :C \\\\to \\\\mathbb{P}^1 of the projective line of degree p. Such a cover is necessarily cyclic, that is, the Galois group of the corresponding algebraic function field extension is the cyclic group \\\\mathbb{Z}/p\\\\mathbb{Z}. In other words, k(C)/k(x) is an Artin‚ÄìSchreier extension. The fundamental theorem of Artin‚ÄìSchreier theory implies that such a curve defined over a field k has an affine model :y^p - y = f(x), for some rational function f \\\\in k(x) that is not equal for z^p - z for any other rational function z. In other words, if we define polynomial g(z) = z^p - z, then we require that f \\\\in k(x) \\\\backslash g(k(x)). Ramification Let C: y^p - y = f(x) be an Artin‚ÄìSchreier curve. Rational function f over an algebraically closed field k has partial fraction decomposition :f(x) = f_\\\\infty(x) + \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha \\\\in B'} f_\\\\alpha\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{x-\\\\alpha}\\\\right) for some finite set B' of elements of k and corresponding non-constant polynomials f_\\\\alpha defined over k, and (possibly constant) polynomial f_\\\\infty. After a change of coordinates, f can be chosen so that the above polynomials have degrees coprime to p, and the same either holds for f_\\\\infty or it is zero. If that is the case, we define :B = \\\\begin{cases} B' &\\\\text{ if } f_\\\\infty = 0, \\\\ B'\\\\cup{\\\\infty} &\\\\text{ otherwise.}\\\\end{cases} Then the set B \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{P}^1(k) is precisely the set of branch points of the covering C \\\\to \\\\mathbb{P}^1. For example, Artin‚ÄìSchreier curve y^p - y = f(x), where f is a polynomial, is ramified at a single point over the projective line. Since the degree of the cover is a prime number, over each branching point \\\\alpha \\\\in B lies a single ramification point P_\\\\alpha with corresponding ramification index equal to :e(P_\\\\alpha) = (p - 1)\\\\big(\\\\deg(f_\\\\alpha) + 1\\\\big) + 1. Genus Since p does not divide \\\\deg(f_\\\\alpha), ramification indices e(P_\\\\alpha) are not divisible by p either. Therefore, Riemann-Roch theorem may be used to compute that the genus of an Artin‚ÄìSchreier curve is given by :g = \\\\frac{p-1}{2} \\\\left( \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha\\\\in B} \\\\big(\\\\deg(f_\\\\alpha) + 1\\\\big) - 2 \\\\right). For example, for a hyperelliptic curve defined over a field of characteristic p = 2 by equation y^2 - y = f(x) with f decomposed as above, :g = \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha\\\\in B} \\\\frac{\\\\deg(f_\\\\alpha) + 1}{2} - 1. Generalizations Artin‚ÄìSchreier curves are a particular case of plane curves defined over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p by an equation :g(y^p) = f(x) for some separable polynomial g \\\\in k[x] and rational function f \\\\in k(x) \\\\backslash g(k(x)). Mapping (x, y) \\\\mapsto x yields a covering map from the curve C to the projective line \\\\mathbb{P}^1. Separability of defining polynomial g ensures separability of the corresponding function field extension k(C)/k(x). If g(y^p) = a_{m} y^{p^m} + a_{m - 1} y^{p^{m-1}} + \\\\cdots + a_{1} y^p + a_0, a change of variables can be found so that a_m = a_1 = 1 and a_0 = 0. It has been shown that such curves can be built via a sequence of Artin-Schreier extension, that is, there exists a sequence of cyclic coverings of curves :C \\\\to C_{m-1} \\\\to \\\\cdots \\\\to C_0 = \\\\mathbb{P}^1, each of degree p, starting with the projective line.

Background and business  Fons was born on August 25, 1878 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He was educated in parochial school and at the age of 13 went to work for M. J. Wawrzyniakowski, a real estate broker and insurance agent, earning $2 a week as a full-time office clerk. Eight years later he became a partner of his former employer and became manager. In 1910 the firm was incorporated under the name of Fons & Co., of which he was president. In 1916 he also organized the Berthelet Pipe & Supply Co., of which he was corporate secretary. He was active in many Polish American organizations, and by 1919 was secretary of the Polish National Association, which boasted 2,500 members and over $1,000,000 in assets. At one time he published the Nowiny Polskie, a Polish language daily newspaper.  Political career In 1910, Fons was the Republican nominee for City Treasurer,\\"Republicans Name Pringle for Mayor\\", Milwaukee Sentinel February 3, 1910, p. 9, col. 1. but lost to Charles Whitnall in the Socialist sweep of that year. He was a delegate to the 1916 Republican National Convention. He served as a member of the State Senate from 1918 to 1920, being elected on January 2, 1918, in a special election to fill a vacancy caused by the expulsion of Socialist Frank Raguse (for suggesting that the sinking of the Maine was plotted by the McKinley administration). Fons received 4,180 votes to 3,962 for Socialist Edward Melms. He did not seek re-election, and was succeeded by fellow Republican George Czerwinski.  Later career  Fons became a building contractor, remained in the real estate business, and went into banking. He remained active in Polish American affairs, being honored in 1953 by the Polish National Alliance for his work; but was not as visible in partisan politics. Although early in the Great Depression, the Southern State Bank which Fons ran had to be liquidated, at the time of his death on May 15, 1959 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, he was president of the National Savings and Loan Association, as well as of Fons & Co.\\"Louis Fons, Builder Dies; Served in State Senate\\".

She is now the associate director of the School of Art and Art History at the University of Illinois, Chicago. Artistic practice Delos Reyes invests in artist-run culture and artist-run institutions by creating platforms to highlight and support other artists. This has taken the form of projects such as Open Engagement and collaborative writing projects and exhibitions. Her practice also explores ideas of group work through looking at music culture and band dynamics. Teaching activities From 2008 to 2013 Delos Reyes was the co-director of the Art and Social Practice MFA program at Portland State University. She was the area chair from 2010 to 2013. During her time at Portland State University she proposed, wrote, and realized the curriculum and structure for a low-residency MFA program in art and social practice that has since blended the localized program under a flexible residency model. This model allows students to reside outside of Portland during their course of study and create meaningful work in their communities. Delos Reyes has also created courses for Portland State University that explore the history of socially engaged art from 1920 to the present, and courses on teaching socially engaged art practice at the undergraduate level. Publishing Art and Social Practice Reference Points is a book series edited by Jen Delos Reyes and produced in conjunction with current MFA students that covers three areas related to socially engaged art: people, thematic volumes, and workbooks. Working in conjunction with faculty, students select individuals or groups that are influential for socially engaged artists, themes that capture currents in contemporary social art practice, and methods for creative application.

Biography Feves was academically trained in the late 1930s and early 1940s, first earning a degree in art with a strong secondary emphasis on music at Washington State College, now Washington State University, where she studied with the noted artist Clyfford Still. She studied during a summer session with Alexander Archipenko at the University of Washington, and later at his studio in Ney York during 1940. Feves worked at Design Technics, a design studio in New York City during World War II, where she also attended classes taught by Ossip Zadkine at the Art Student's League. Following her marriage to Dr. Lou Feves, she returned to the Pacific Northwest, where she lived in Pendleton, OR until her death in 1985. Betty Feves is recognized in her community as a mentor by many artists, including James Lavadour, who used Betty Feves' community activism as one of the models for the development of Crow's Shadow Institute for the Arts, Pendleton, OR. Music played an equally important role in her life. In 1967, Feves was instrumental in arranging a visit by Dr. Shinichi Suzuki to Pendleton, his only stop in the Pacific Northwest that year. Using primarily locally sourced materials and glazes she created herself, Betty Feves work is inspired by the land both through materials and forms. Feves earned a national and international reputation for her work, and established new approaches to working with clay. Her first entry into publicly exhibiting her artwork came in 1952, when she entered Three Figures in the Third Annual Exhibition of Northwest Ceramics at the Oregon Ceramic Studio, now the Museum of Contemporary Craft, and Four Figures in the 17th Ceramic National at Syracuse Museum of Fine Arts, now the Everson Museum of Art. In 1957, she was a presenter at the groundbreaking American Craft Council Conference at Asilomar, CA, recognized today as the first convening of modern craftsman and a pivotal moment in the American Craft Movement. Her work is included in collections of The Smithsonian Institution, Museum of Contemporary Craft in partnership with Pacific Northwest College of Art, Portland Art Museum, The Henry Art Gallery, and private collections. In 2012, the Museum of Contemporary Craft in partnership with the Pacific Northwest College of Art honored the artist with Generations: Betty Feves, the first museum retrospective exhibition and publication to focus on the artist's work and life.

According to the 2011 Census, there were 38,780 Canadians who claimed full or partial Maltese ancestry, having an increase compared to those 37,120 in 2006.  History  The Maltese emigration of significant manner occurred in 1840, followed by periods of emigration around 1907 and between 1918-1920. However, most Maltese emigrants settled in Canada after World War II. Most these immigrants settled in Ontario, mainly Toronto, but over time other Maltese immigrants moved to other Canadian cities including Montreal, Vancouver, and St. John's. Approximately 18,000 Maltese people emigrated to Canada between 1946 and 1981, but emigration slowly reduced over time. In 2006 only 145 people of Maltese origin settled in the country.Maltese - The Canadian Encyclopedia.

It includes music, dance, theater, films, creative writing and the visual arts. In addition to student performances, major artists perform original works and participate in master class work with members of the Reed College community. Visiting artists have included Karen Finley (2001), The Yes Men (2003), Tao Lin (2009), Chris Kraus (2012), and Antoine Catala (2014). RAW was conceived by professors David Schiff and Maeera Schreiber in 1990 as a weekend that would highlight the visual and performing arts at the college. It originally began as a weekend, but soon grew into a weeklong annual festival celebrated in February or March. RAW has been student-run since its inception by Schiff and Schreiber. Each year, RAW Student Coordinators are responsible for appointing students to other RAW positions, such as those in public relations and graphic design. Until 2003, the appointment of RAW Student Coordinators and the funding of RAW fell into the domain of the student body and its senate. Following a 2001 controversy in which an anonymous Title IX complaint was filed against the college after a purportedly pornographic performance piece, Reed community members, the student senate, and the administration engaged in a discussion about student management of RAW in spring of 2001. The Title IX complaint alleged that the piece constituted sexual harassment and lacked artistic merit. The 2001 discussion revealed that several community members supported the claim that it lacked artistic merit and demonstrated indecency, and senate discussed the possibility that RAW would be placed under administrative control, such that the administration would ‚Äúelect student coordinators and manage RAW funds.‚Äù In 2003, the Reed College administration announced that the RAW coordinator appointment process would be conducted by Reed's Student Services.

But Adnae's son, N√©de, who was away studying in Scotland, heard of his father's death on the waves while walking the shore. \\"One day the youth went forth along the edge of the sea - poets ever believed that the brink of water was a place of revelation.

Eleanor Hull, op. cit., pp. 439-40. Upon returning he met the troublesome Bricriu, who gave N√©de the Ollamhship in exchange for a valuable gift (a purple tunic, with its adornment of gold and silver) and told him to take the Ollamh's seat. Then Bricriu said: ‚Äòno beardless boy receives the ollaveship of Emain Macha' - for N√©de was still but a boy. So N√©de plucked a handful of grass, and cast a spell upon it so that it became like a beard upon him. Then he went and sat in the Ollamh's chair and pulled his robe about him. Three colors were on the robe: a covering of bright bird's feathers in the middle, at the bottom a scattered speckling of findruine, while on the top was a brilliant golden color. Bricriu then alerted Ferchertne, saying \\"It were sad, O Ferchertne, that thou shouldst be put out of the ollaveship today! A young honourable man has taken the ollaveship in Emain.\\" This caused an angry Ferchertne to return a confront N√©de, which begins the interchange.

Ahuja creates works of self-portraiture that combine themes of myth and legend with personal identity. Early life Mequitta Ahuja was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan to Indian and African-American parents, hailing from New Delhi and Cincinnati respectively. Ahuja grew up in a largely white community in Connecticut, and had little contact with African American communities and culture. Her upbringing in this environment is a common subject in her work. Ahuja received her BA at Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts in 1998, and her MFA at University of Illinois at Chicago in 2003, where she was mentored by contemporary artist Kerry James Marshall.  Career and Works  In 2007, in Ahuja's debut exhibition in New York city, New York Times art critic Holland Cotter said of Ahuja's work, \\"Referring to the artist's African-American and East Indian background, the pictures turn marginality into a regal condition\\". Ahuja's art explores the social construction of issues such as race, gender, and identity through a technique of self- portraiture. To create her paintings, Ahuja relies on a three-step process that involves performance, photography, and drawing/painting. Ahuja begins by developing a series of performances involving costumes, props, and poses. With the aid of a remote shutter, she then photographs her performances and documents them as \\"non-fictional source material.\\" Finally, she incorporates these photographs into her invented material, resulting in her completed self- portraits. Ahuja has discussed her paintings as being feminist, referring to the assertive, self-sufficient female presence prevalent in her work, and frequently turns to her African American and South Asian roots in her consideration of identity issues. She states that through her art, \\"I feel I can have relationships to these groups on my own terms\\". In 2007, Ahuja was included in the exhibition Global Feminisms at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, and in 2009 her painting \\"Dream Region\\", reflecting her various identities, was featured as the cover of the book War Baby/Love Child: Mixed Race Asian American Art. Ahuja appropriates ancient works of myth and legend, such as the fifteenth century Persian manuscript and Mughal miniature paintings, into her own commitment to certain kinds of identity fabrication. She articulated her own artistic style as \\"Of primary concern to me is the agency we have to self- invent and self-represent... creative processes that are necessarily bricolage. We draw on personal and cultural history as well as our creative imaginations\\". In her projects \\"Auto cartography I\\" and \\"Rhyme Sequence: Wiggle Waggle\\", the pictorial styles of the paintings are cross-cultural as well as autobiographical. Ahuja was compelled to study myths, folklore and ancient works as a way to discuss how they are represented in art. She combines her own cultural heritage with the Western art canon to explore stories and imagery related to her experience. Western art historical references are also apparent in Abuja's work, from early Italian Renaissance paintings to impressionism and post-impressionism. Combining those Western art cannons with South Asian art traditions, Ahuja is said to \\"reclaim creative authorship\\" or agency in her self-portraiture. Ahuja cites her work as \\"automythography,\\" an expansion of feminist Audre Lorde's \\"biomythography.\\" Ahuja describes \\"automythography\\" as a \\"combination of personal narrative with cultural and personal mythology.\\" Ahuja often paints over her own work, regarding failed paintings as an opportunity, which \\"allows for the sort of things you can't plan for.\\" Ahuja is also interested in the process, building surfaces by painting, stamping to create a complex surface. \\"I'm thinking of the ground as a cultural space. Instead of starting with the plain page, I'm starting it with this layer of culture so that when I'm building my imagery, it's really a wrestle between the figure and the ground. In the end, there's this integrated, stitched together element between them. . . I'm interested in mixing those traditions: flatness of space, but also some perspectival space and depth into the surface. I think that's where we are in painting. I think we, as artists, now have free range to take what we want from history.\\" Colored pencil on paper. In 2008, Ahuja created Tress IV, with the aim to convert the image of African American hair to a \\"space of infinite creative possibilities or generative possibilities.\\" Ahuja believes that African American hair is often weighted down with \\"personal and cultural history.\\" By exaggerating the image of African American hair, it shows the value that hair has in the lives of black people and how they are constantly evolving the standard of beauty, moving away from a more Eurocentric to Afrocentric idea of beauty. Her two central concerns during this period were \\"self-invention and self-representation.\\" Ahuja's work has been exhibited throughout the United States as well as in Paris, Brussels, Berlin, India, Dubai, and Milan. In 2010, Ahuja was profiled as an \\"Artist to Watch\\" in the February edition of ArtNews, and over the years she has been the recipient of multiple awards for her art, including the Tiffany Foundation Award in 2011, and a 2009 Joan Mitchell Grant. In 2018 she was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, which has been helping select artists expand their practice for nearly a century.  Exhibitions  Early in her career, Ahuja's exhibition, Myth and Memory: Dancing on the Hide of Shere Khan, was featured in MCA Chicago's UBS 12X12: New Artists/New Work, in November 2005. As with much of her work, the exhibition dealt with human identity, informed by her own experience as a multiracial woman. In 2008 Ahuja opened her solo exhibition, Flowback, at the Lawndale Art Center in Houston, Texas. Flowback dealt with the varying relationships between black women and their hair, through textured and patterned crayon drawings of black women's hair flowing out from their tilted back heads. The show also included a piece titled Loop, in which two women's hair is woven together in a net of straight and curly locks, with highlights and bursts of light. Ahuja was not new to solo ehibitions in 2008. She had a solo show at BravinLee Programs in New York, titled Encounters, in the spring of 2007. In 2009 she brought a new body of work to BravinLee Programs, this one titled Automythography I. During this time, Ahuja was ranked a finalist in the 2009 Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition at the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery in Washington, DC. The portrait she submitted, titled Repunzel, features the upended head of a black woman with curly hair flowing downward and severed into sections by two thin white lines. The piece was drawn in waxy chalk on paper by Ahuja in 2008, the same year as her Flowback solo exhibition. Following the exhibition of Automythography I, Ahuja brought a show she called Automythography II to Arthouse at The Jones Center in Austin, TX. The show ran from October 24, 2009 through January 2, 2010. Not long after that, Ajuha gained representation in Europe at Galerie Nathalie Obadia, in Paris, France, with a show that began in April of 2010 Later in 2010, Ahuja was an artist in residence at The Studio Museum in Harlem, located in New York city. The residency culminated in the exhibition, Usable Pasts, which ran from July to October. Ahuja's mythic self-portrait, Generator, was featured. In it Ahuja appears as a goddess in pink robes. Ahuja's work continued to show in group exhibitions throughout 2011 and 2012, appearing twice with Galerie Nathalie Obadiah in Brussels, beginning with the 2011 Armory Show. November of 2012 and into the following year Portraiture Now: Drawing on the Edge ran at the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery in Washington, DC, including Ahuja as one of the featured artists. In 2013 Ahuja exhibited at Thierry Goldbery, in New York, NY. In 2014 Ahuja was selected by Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art to be one of the emerging artists from across the United States featured in their exhibition State of the Art: Discovering American Art Now. The exhibition is the result of a 2013 road trip the museum's curatorial team took to research American art of the time by visiting over 1000 artists in their studios, conducting interviews and selecting around 100 diverse artists to present their unique American perspectives in the final exhibition. The exhibition was later shared with other arts institutions, such as Minneapolis Institute of Art, Minneapolis, MN in 2016, and Telfair Museums Jepson Center. In the same year, the Minneapolis Institute of Art included Ahuja's work in another show, Marks of Genius: One Hundred Extraordinary Drawings. Feeling isolated and seeking a way to participate and connect in the art world, Ahuja applied for the 2015 Sondheim Artscape Prize, and became a finalist, competing for a $25,000 fellowship and exhibiting work at the Baltimore Museum of Art in Maryland. While she did not receive the prize, her participation in the exhibition led to new friendships and acted as a catalyst to continue pursuing arts fellowships. She would become a finalist for the Sondheim Prize again in 2017, and receive the Guggenheim Fellowship in 2018. Ahuja participated in several more exhibitions through 2015 and 2016, including shows at Tiwani Contemporary in London, England, Baltimore Museum of Art in Mariland, Grand Rapids Art Museum in Michigan, and Silber Gallery at Goucher College in Towson, MD. The Tiwani Contemporary exhibition, titled Mythopoeia, brought together four artists from around the world to explore the theme of myth-making in art as a means of understanding our world and elevating culture. For this exhibition, Ahuja unveiled a new series of self-portraits as 'The Journeyman', which used her characteristic \\"automythography\\" to explore the artist as both archetype and individual. Ahuja participated in the 2016 show Champagne Life at Saatchi Gallery, in London, England. The show was criticized by some for its superficial feminism and lack of cohesiveness beyond having all female artists, though the artwork itself was lauded for its high quality. In 2017 Ahuja's work was part of a number of exhibitions, including Lucid Dreams and Distant Visions at the Asia Society in New York, which explored work by artists of the South Asian diaspora.

He expanded his knowledge of using performance-enhancing drugs and found that this was highly valued by other athletes looking to dope. Following in his father's background as a chemistry professor, Heredia earned a science degree which led him to deeply explore the chemical functions of various drugs and devise methods which both reduced the chances of detection in drug tests and made efficient use of their athletically enhancing effects. As an athletics coach and chemist he was largely known as √Ångel Heredia and gained the nickname \\"Memo\\". He worked with a number of prominent track and field coaches including Trevor Graham, Winthrop Graham, John Smith and Ray Stewart. He created a number of doping substances and methods, with a combination of testosterone, growth hormone and EPO being his most successful. Following revelations of widespread doping, stemming from the BALCO scandal, Heredia discussed his methods and doping in general with international media.

John Deakin, c.1966‚Äì67 Portrait of Isabel Rawsthorne Standing in a Street in Soho is a 1967 oil on canvas painting by the British figurative artist Francis Bacon, housed in the Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin. Described by art critic John Russell as one of Bacon's finest works, it depicts Isabel Rawsthorne, the painter, designer and occasional model for artists such as Andr√© Derain, Alberto Giacometti and Picasso. Bacon met her in the late 1940s through Erica Brausen, who was exhibiting both artists in her Hanover Gallery in London. He portrayed Rawsthorne many times, including three large scale canvases and three triptychs in the 1960s, as well as around 15 smaller portraits. She was a great beauty with striking facial features, and was a formidable character. She fascinated Bacon and was perhaps the friend he respected most during the 1960s. According to his biographer Michael Peppiatt, \\"in her animal exuberance and the resolute sense of her individuality ... she had a magnetism and mobility of expression that captivated Bacon\\". Although notably gay, in an interview soon after her death in January 1992, Bacon hinted that they had recently had an affair.His only earlier sexual encounter with a woman was with a prostitute. Bacon claims it was unsuccessful. Description Three Studies of Isabel Rawsthorne, Francis Bacon, 1966 Bacon's 1960s paintings are characterised by closely modelled heads. By this time he was highly social, and liked to spend long nights with associates such as Lucian Freud (they later fell out, for unexplained reasons), Peter O'Toole, George Melly, Muriel Belcher, John Deakin and Henrietta Moraes. Belcher was a close friend, and the proprietor of the highly selective Colony Room in Dean Street, Soho. The extant portraits of Belcher are unusual for Bacon who was so preoccupied with figures in rooms, in that it has an outdoor setting. After the 1950s, and apart from his bullfight series, it is one of the few to place the subject outdoors. In addition it is one of his few in which the subject seems aware and engaged with its surroundings. The other portraits that show a similarly outwards looking figure are also of Rawsthorne.

Terrain Exhibitions is an artist run project space in Oak Park, Illinois. Terrain Exhibitions differs from most artist run or \\"apartment spaces\\" insofar as the artists works are exhibited outdoors in the front yard and are accessible 24 hours a day, 365 days per year. Ott and Paulett invite artists to create interventions into the conventional or traditional idea of what a front yard should be and how it might function. Ott and Paulett ask artists to consider the differences between private and public space and explore intersections between decoration and utility. Terrain Exhibitions is located across from Longfellow School in Oak Park, at the intersection of Highland and Jackson Avenues. Exhibiting artists have included Claire Ashley, Lise Haller Baggesen, Leslie Baum, Judith Brotman, (f)utility Projects, Michelle Grabner, Brad Killam, Anna Kunz, and Jeroen Nelemans. In addition to Terrain Exhibitions, Ott and Paulett also organize the Terrain Biennial, a monthlong exhibition that asks the local community to adopt an artist for the duration of the project and work with them to create an installation or artwork situated in their front yard or garden space. The Terrain Exhibitions Biennial first occurred in 2013 and will take place once more in 2015, expanding to include other artist run spaces in the Oak Park area.

The earthquake and subsequent tsunami resulted in approximately 30,000 deaths. Despite its severity, the disaster had been mostly forgotten until the rediscovery of contemporary records in the early 20th-century.  Event  The earthquake is believed to have been caused by the Lower Tagus Fault Zone, and was preceded by a pair of foreshocks on 2 January and 7 January. Damage to the city, especially the downtown area, was severe: approximately one-third of structures in the city were destroyed and 1000 lives were lost in the initial shock. Contemporary reports tell of flooding near the Tagus River, ships being thrown onto rocks, and others grounded on the river's floor as the water retreated. Miranda et al. conclude that \\"These observations are coherent with the existence of a large change in the estuary seafloor, either tectonic displacement or a landslide.\\" Aftermath The earthquake was followed by several strong aftershocks, and fear of another earthquake was intense. Mass hysteria accompanied by all-manner of religious demonstrations (donations, pilgrimages, sermons, etc.) were felt through the Kingdom. The events that followed are closely compared to those following the 1755 earthquake, from the King taking refuge in tents, in Palmela, to the religious and civil repercussions and the response of the State. Quickly after the tremor rumors spread, apparently encouraged by the friars of Santar√©m, that the disaster was divine punishment (Latin: \\"Ira Dei\\"- Wrath of God) and that the Jewish community was to blame. Poet and playwright Gil Vicente, who was present in that city during the quake, reportedly personally defused the situation while scolding the friars for their fear-mongering in a powerfully written letter to King John III, and possibly averting a massacre of Jews and recent converts to Christianity. Rediscovery The 1531 earthquake, alongside the 1321 earthquake, had been largely forgotten until the early 20th century.Gon√ßalves, Victor Pereira.

In 1919, a four-page letter addressed to the Marquis of Tarifa was found in a Lisbon bookshop, which appeared to describe the earthquake. Sousa's 1919 investigation of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake provided more evidence for the 1531 event, particularly his compilation of answers to the Marquis of Pombal's survey in the wake of the 1755 disaster, which included a question about previous earthquakes.

The building has served as an event and meeting space since 1979, when it was purchased by the San Francisco Women's Center. The building is shielded from rising real estate costs in the Mission district because that group has owned the building since 1995. The four-story building rents to multiple tenants and serves over 20,000 women a year.  Building history  The structure was built by the German Turnverein exercise movement in 1910 and retained the name Mission Turn Hall until 1935, but was also used by other organizations of various ethnicities including the Native Sons and Daughters of the Golden West. In 1935, it was acquired by the Sons and Daughters of Norway, and subsequently was known as Dovre Hall, before taking its current name in 1978. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018.The Women's Building in 1998/1999. The San Francisco Women's Center began in 1973. By 1974, it hired its first full-time employee and had moved into a small storefront office. In 1976, its difficulty in locating a venue for the national conference on Violence Against Women it was organizing with other women's groups led it to search for a permanent space. Through 1978 and 1979, it raised funds to put down an initial $10,000 deposit, and then a $115,000 first payment towards the $535,000 purchase price of the building at 3543 18th Street. \\"Becoming Visible: The First Black Lesbian Conference\\" was held at the Women's Building, from October 17 to 19, 1980. It has been credited as the first conference for African-American lesbian women.Kyper, John. \\"Black Lesbians Meet in October.\\" Coming Up: A Calendar of Events 1 (Oct. 1980): 1. Web. Tracy Gary, one of the organizers of the Violence Against Women conference, and co-founder of the Women's Building, along with co-founder Marya Grambs and Women's Building staff member Carmen V√°zquez, were interviewed in 1982 by Julia Randall for KPFA for the building's 3rd birthday. The women discuss the difficulties of the early years and how the building was being used in 1982. Roma Guy and her partner Diane were also two of the Women's Building's co-founders. In the first year of operation, the Women's Building was targeted by two attacks: an arson fire that caused $50,000 worth of damage, and a pipe bomb set off on the front steps of the building. In 1997, the Women's Building began to undergo a $5 million renovation prompted by mandatory seismic retrofitting. In the course of that effort, it evicted the Dovre Club, an Irish bar that had been in the corner of the building on 18th and Lapidge Streets since 1979. The original owner of that bar had an oral agreement with the Women's Center that the bar could stay in place during his lifetime; after his death in 1997, the bar made an effort to stay in place but ultimately relocated. In 2018, the building received a $160,000 grant to retrofit its windows, by winning a vote in a preservation funding contest for historical buildings.  Mural  Part of the mural on the side of the building, in 2015 Painted by seven women artists including, Juana Alicia, Miranda Bergman, Edythe Boone, Susan Kelk Cervantes (cofounder of Precita Eyes Muralists Association), Meera Desai, Yvonne Littleton and Irene Perez along with their helpers and volunteers in 1994, the mural titled MaestraPeace covers both the outside of The Women's Building as well as the interior entrance hall and stairway. It features images of feminine icons from history and fiction, and the names of more than 600 women written in calligraphy. According to the San Francisco Women's Center, \\"This spectacular mural is a culmination of a multi-cultural, multi- generation collaboration of seven women artists, and a colorful work of art that sings to our community.\\" The Women's Building Many of the original artists returned to the building for an update in 2000, an expansion to the inside of the building in 2010, and a major $130,000 restoration in 2012.

HAWC is the successor to the Milagro gamma-ray observatory in New Mexico, which was also a gamma-ray observatory based around the principle of detecting gamma-rays indirectly using the water Cherenkov method. HAWC is a joint collaboration between a large number of American and Mexican universities and scientific institutions, including the University of Maryland, the National Autonomous University of Mexico, the National Institute of Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics, Los Alamos National Laboratory, NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center, the University of California, Santa Cruz, Michigan Technological University, Michigan State University, Benem√©rita Universidad Aut√≥noma de Puebla, the Universidad de Guadalajara, the University of Utah, the University of New Mexico, the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison and the Georgia Institute of Technology.http://www.hawc-observatory.org/collaboration/ HAWC with the Pico de Orizaba in the background, August 2014  Overview  The HAWC Gamma-ray Observatory is a wide field of view, continuously operating, TeV gamma-ray telescope that explores the origin of cosmic rays, study the acceleration of particles in extreme physical environments, and search for new TeV physics. HAWC was built at an elevation of 4100 m above sea level in Mexico by a collaboration of 15 US and 12 Mexican institutions, and it is operated with funding from the US National Science Foundation, the US Department of Energy and CONACyT (Mexico's science funding agency). HAWC was completed in spring of 2015, and consists of an array of 300 water Cherenkov detectors. It is designed to be more than an order of magnitude more sensitive than its predecessor, Milagro. HAWC monitors the northern sky and makes coincident observations with other wide field of view observatories. HAWC overlap with observatories, such as VERITAS, HESS, MAGIC, IceCube and later, CTA, so they can make overlapping multi-wavelength and multi-messenger observations and to maximize coincident observations with the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi). HAWC has the ability to detect a large ensemble of gamma-ray sources - measuring their spectra and variability to characterize TeV scale acceleration mechanisms. In a one-year survey, HAWC can perform a deep, unbiased survey of the TeV gamma-ray with a 50 mCrab sensitivity at 5œÉ. HAWC will observe hard-spectrum (high photon energies) Galactic sources in the TeV with a sensitivity similar to that of Fermi in the GeV, detect diffuse emission from regions of the Galactic plane, have sensitivity to see known TeV active galactic nuclei and the brightest known GeV gamma-ray bursts, and represents a large enough step in sensitivity to likely discover new phenomena. Because HAWC has a 2 steradian instantaneous field of view, it will observe diffuse gamma-ray emission from the plane of the galaxy over a broad range of galactic longitudes reaching to the galactic center. In September 2015, a Laboratory Directed Research and Development grant was awarded to Brenda Dingus of Los Alamos National Laboratory to improve HAWC's effective area and sensitivity by adding an array outrigger tanks, surrounding the larger central tanks. Due to the greater size of particle showers created by high energy cosmic rays, increasing the area of the detector will increase the sensitivity of the detector. The outriggers were predicted to increase the sensitivity and effective area of HAWC by 2 to 4 times for particles with energies above 10 TeV. The outrigger array was completed in early 2018, a year later than expected.http://www.hawc-observatory.org/news/  Principle of operation  HAWC detects electromagnetic radiation from air showers produced by high energy cosmic rays which hit the Earth's atmosphere. HAWC is sensitive to showers produced by primary cosmic rays with energies between 100 GeV and 50 TeV. Cherenkov radiation occurs when charged particles travel through a medium at a speed faster than the speed of light in that medium. High-energy gamma rays, upon striking the upper atmosphere, can create positron-electron pairs that move at great speeds. The residual effect of these particles traveling through the atmosphere can result in a cascading shower of particles and photons that are aimed towards the surface at predictable angles. 300px 250px HAWC consists of large metal tanks, 7.3 m wide by 5 m high, containing a light-tight bladder holding 188,000 liters of water. Inside are four photomultiplier tubes (3-8\\" and 1-10\\" high QE). High-energy particles striking the water result in Cherenkov light that is detected by the photomultiplier tubes. HAWC uses the difference in arrival times of the light at different tanks to measure the direction of the primary particle. The pattern of light allows for discrimination between primary (hadrons) and gamma-rays. From this, scientists can map the sky using gamma-rays. Closeup of HAWC tanks. Each tank contains circa 188,000 liters of water and four photomultiplier tubes.  Performance goals  HAWC will: * Detect a large sample of localized gamma-ray sources and measure their spectra and variability to characterize TeV scale acceleration mechanisms from an ensemble of sources. * Have a 50 mCrab sensitivity at 5œÉ in a one-year survey. HAWC will observe hard-spectrum Galactic sources at TeV energies with a sensitivity similar to that of Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope at GeV energies, detect diffuse emission from regions of the Galactic plane, have sensitivity to see known TeV active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the brightest known GeV gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and represents a large enough step in sensitivity to likely discover new phenomena. * Measure the spectrum and spatially characterize the diffuse TeV emission from the Milky Way galaxy to probe the cosmic ray flux in other regions of the galaxy. * Observe extragalactic transient sources, such as GRBs and AGN, and notify other observers promptly so they can make multi-wavelength and multi-messenger observations. * Perform a deep, unbiased survey of the TeV gamma-ray and cosmic-ray sky to understand TeV astrophysical sources sufficiently to search for new fundamental physics effects. * Have a 2 steradian (sr) instantaneous field of view to allow observations of diffuse gamma-ray emission from the plane of the Galaxy over a broad range of Galactic longitudes reaching to the Galactic center. This wide field of view also enables HAWC to observe phenomena such as GRBs, which are rare, from unknown directions, and last only a few seconds. HAWC can thus discover new TeV sources and observe flaring in known sources that may have no low energy counterpart, i.e. orphan TeV flares from AGN that are signatures of hadronic acceleration. * Operate for at least five years with >90% duty cycle, which will give it sufficient exposure to measure the low fluxes at higher energies and long enough to detect and monitor a variety of transient sources. * Have a median energy below 1 TeV for a Crab-like spectrum, which is needed to observe extragalactic sources that are attenuated at high energies by pair production with intergalactic photons. * Have a >95% hadronic background rejection for E >10 TeV by distinguishing the penetrating particles in the hadron-initiated background showers from the gamma-ray initiated electromagnetic showers. * Have an angular resolution of <0.5o for E >1 TeV and 0.25o for E >10 TeV. This resolution improves HAWC's flux sensitivity by rejecting the isotropic background and provides source localizations that are sufficient for targeting by other detectors and for determining the spatial morphology of the source. HAWC may also discover extended sources that can trigger deep observations by IACTs.  Science goals = Galactic sources at high energies  The origin of the cosmic radiation has been a mystery since its discovery by Victor Hess in 1912. The cosmic-ray energy spectrum extends from a few GeV to above 1020 eV. As yet there is no experimental proof of the transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays, though it is believed that cosmic rays below about 1017.5 eV are of Galactic origin. While there is a consensus that supernovae (SN) explosions accelerate cosmic rays up to energies of ~1015 eV, experimental evidence has been difficult to obtain. The theoretical arguments are based upon the energy released in SN being sufficient to maintain the observed cosmic rays in the Galaxy, and the creation of strong shocks by SN enabling first order Fermi acceleration. Thus the tasks for future experiments are to confirm that supernovae are sites of the acceleration of hadronic cosmic rays up to the knee, and to determine the sources of the Galactic cosmic rays above 1015 eV.  Galactic diffuse emission  The diffuse gamma radiation from our Galaxy also probes the origin of cosmic rays. This radiation is due to the interaction of hadronic cosmic rays with interstellar gas and subsequent decay of neutral pions, and the interaction of high-energy electrons with gas and radiation fields (radio, microwave, infrared, optical, UV and magnetic). If the distribution of matter and radiation is known through other measurements, knowledge of the diffuse emission allows one to measure the cosmic-ray flux and spectrum throughout the Galaxy. This information can be used to determine the regions within the Galaxy where particle acceleration has recently occurred.  Transient emission from AGN and the Crab  Over 20 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) have been detected in very high energy (VHE) gamma rays and extreme flares of up to 50 times the quiescent flux have been observed. Gamma rays are produced via interactions of the high-energy electrons and/or protons with lower energy photons. There exist several models to explain the source of photons including: synchrotron emission by the same population of electrons, radiation from the accretion disk, and cosmic microwave background photons. Simultaneous observations using multiple wavelengths and multi-messenger approaches are required to distinguish among these models. Monitoring at VHE energies is an efficient mechanism to initiate such observations because the highest energy gamma rays exhibit the most extreme variability and probe the highest energy particles. HAWC will have the sensitivity to detect strong flares, such as those that have been observed from Markarian 421, at greater than 10œÉ in under 30 minutes.  Gamma-ray bursts  The Fermi satellite has now observed both long and short gamma-ray bursts that emit multi-GeV gamma rays. No high energy cut off is observed in any of these GRBs, and the highest energy gamma ray observed in the three brightest bursts were emitted (i.e. corrected for the observed redshift) at energies of 70, 60, 94, and 61 GeV in GRBs 080916C, 090510, 090902B, and 090926 respectively. The highest energy gamma-rays require a bulk Lorentz factor of the outflow of nearly 1000 in order to have the rest-frame energies and photon densities be low enough to avoid attenuation by pair production interactions. The Fermi-LAT observations show the most intense GeV emission occurs promptly, and also extends longer than the emission at lower energies. A wide field of view, high duty factor observatory, such as HAWC, is required to observe this prompt emission and determine its extent at high energies especially for a burst such as 090510, in which the prompt emission was less than half a second in duration. HAWC has the sensitivity to continue these observations into the VHE range. The effective area of HAWC at 100 GeV (~100m2) is more than 100 times that of the Fermi-LAT.  Cosmic rays at TeV energies  HAWC is a very sensitive detector for TeV cosmic rays. The large number of cosmic rays detected with HAWC forms an undesirable background in the search for gamma-ray sources, but it also permits precise measurements of small deviations from isotropy in the cosmic-ray flux. Over the last few years, cosmic-ray detectors in the northern and southern hemisphere have found anisotropy in the arrival direction distribution of TeV cosmic rays at the per-mille level. Since we expect the arrival directions of charged particles at these energies to be completely scrambled by Galactic magnetic fields, these deviations are surprising and imply that the propagation of cosmic rays from their sources to us is not understood. Mapping the arrival direction distribution of cosmic rays to study the anisotropy with increased sensitivity is a major science goal for HAWC.  Fundamental physics  High-energy astrophysical observations have the unique potential to explore fundamental physics. However, deriving fundamental physics from the astrophysical observations is complex and requires a deep understanding of the astrophysical sources. The astrophysics background must be understood in order to determine the deviations from this background due to new physics. In some cases, astronomers can help with the understanding of the astrophysical background, such as using supernovae as standard candles to measure dark energy. However, high-energy physicists will have to detect and explain high energy astrophysical phenomena in order to derive the fundamental physics. The HAWC deep survey of the TeV gamma-ray sky will provide an unbiased picture necessary to characterize the properties of the astrophysical sources in order to search for new fundamental physics effects. Examples of HAWC investigations include: # Constraining the existence of nearby dark matter. HAWC's unbiased survey of 2œÄ sr of the TeV sky allows searches known and unknown dwarf spheroidal satellites of our galaxy. The number of satellites increases with decreasing mass so there could be very nearby clumps of dark matter, which would therefore have higher gamma-ray fluxes, but might not have optical counterparts. The known dwarf spheroidal galaxies have extents of up to ~1 degree which is well matched to HAWC's angular resolution of <0.5o. A stacked analysis of these satellites would improve the limit because all will have the same gamma-ray spectra. # Testing Lorentz invariance with transient gamma-ray observations. Many quantum gravity theories predict that the speed of light depends upon the energy of the photon as: Œîc/c = -(E/MQGn)n where n=1 or 2. While MQG may be the Planck mass (2.4x1018 GeV), some theories predict much smaller mass scales. For theories where n=1, the Fermi-LAT collaboration has set limits above the Planck mass, and HAWC will have similar sensitivity if a GRB is detected. For theories where n=2, the higher energy sensitivity of HAWC will lead to limits roughly an order of magnitude higher mass scale than is possible with Fermi-LAT. # Measuring the attenuation of astrophysical sources due to interactions with the extragalactic background light (EBL). HAWC will enable multiple sources to be observed in various flaring states to understand the intrinsic TeV spectrum. Current constraints on the EBL make a conservative assumption of a very hard intrinsic spectrum and are very close to the maximum allowed from galaxy counts. These observations have led to postulations of the existence of axions in order to reduce the attenuation of TeV emission from EBL. # Searching for exotic signals such as massive relic particles, e.g. supersymmetry Q-balls, and tau neutrinos. Special triggers will be developed, allowing HAWC to search for the slow moving and high dE/dx Q-balls and the horizontal air showers produced by tau neutrinos interacting in the nearby mountain.  HAWC funding  HAWC construction and operation is funded jointly by the U.S. National Science Foundation, the U.S. Department of Energy Office of High-Energy Physics, and Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog√≠a (CONACyT) in Mexico and the Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) program of Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Dusi was nicknamed by his contemporaries the \\"modern Tintoretto\\", for his liveliness of invention and rapidity at painting.Treccani Encyclopedia (in Italian), Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 42 (1993) by Maddalena Malni Pascoletti. Education and early work in the Veneto and Tyrol Cosroe was born in Venice. He enrolled in 1820 at the Academy of Fine Arts of Venice, where his mentor was the painter Teodoro Matteini, who had also taught the influential Hayez. At the Academy, Dusi studied alongside Michelangelo Grigoletti. After graduating in 1827, the Academy awarded Dusi a room near the school and he exhibited the large historical canvas, The Death of Alcibiades,Della litteratura veneziana del secolo XIV: notizie ed appunti, by Count Filippo Nani-Mocenigo, pages 211-212. followed by Paolo and Francesca da Rimini, exhibited in 1831 at the Brera. In 1829 at the annual exhibition of the Accademia, he displayed The Nymph Salmacis seduces the innocent Hermaphroditus, a Virgin and child with St John, and two small paintings depicting scenes from writings of Gasparo Gozzi.Treccani Encyclopedia. In 1830 he married Antonietta Ferrari, daughter and sister respectively of the sculptors Bartolomeo and Luigi Ferrari. Luigi had also studied at the Academy with Dusi.Exhibition at Marostica in 2012 : Cosroe Dusi, the adventures of an artists at the court of the Tsars. (In Italian)Cosroe Dusi 2012 Exhibition reviewed for Cultura Italia by Laura Larcan. In Venice, Dusi collaborated in the production of illustrations for books and lithographic series. For the journal of Il Gondoliere, he made a lithographic portrait Leopoldo Cicognara, that was used in Cicognara's obituary in 1834, and was based on a prior oil painting by Ludovico Lipparini. Dusi, along with Grigoletti and Michele Fanoli, completed a series of lithographs depicting various trades of Venetians, published by Galvani. The subjects were mostly genre figures (fishmongers, chimney sweeps, etc.) or portraits (including singers, actors, and dancers). The Museo Correr of Venice has engravings and lithography by Drusi. He also traveled through Monaco, Germany, and Russia. In 1831 he was commissioned to paint the main altarpiece depicting Saints Peter and Paul and another altarpiece of Virgin of the Rosary and St Dominic for the parish church of the same name in Sexten in Tyrol. for Parish Church of S.S. Pietro e Paulo in Sexten, which this source name \\"Sesto\\" in Italian. He painted St Luke painting the Virgin (right lateral altar, 1833) and the Assumption of Mary (1834, main altarpiece) of the Sanctuary of Santa Assunta of Maria Luggau in West Carinthia. He also painted frescoes on the Resurrection of the Dead for the chapel in the cemetery of Cortina d'Ampezzo.Cortina d'Ampezzo Parish. Among his other religious paintings are his Adoption of the Habit by St Gertrude (1835)Nani-Mocenigo, page 212. for the main altar of the parish church of M√ºhlwald;. M√ºhlwald is also referred with the alternate Italian name \\"Selva dei Molini\\". in 1836 he completed an altarpiece depicting a Santa Maria Assunta (1836) for the side altar of a parish church near Bruneck; a Crucifixion for the parish church of St Michael at Brixen; and a Glory of Saint Catherine for the main altar of the parish church of Graun im Vinschgau;Now in a reconstructed church. and a Transit of St Joseph (1839) for the church of San Luca Evangelista in Padua.of St Joseph is now in Diocesan Museum. (In Italian) For the parish church of St Martin in Gsies, he painted the altarpiece depicting Communion of St Martin, bishop of Tours. For the church of Santa Maria Assunta of Taufers, he painted a Holy Family with young St John the Baptist (1839). Dusi was commissioned to complete the main altarpiece of the Collegiata of Santa Maria Maggiore of the main city of the Dalmatian island of Cherso (now Cres, Croatia). A fire in 1826 had destroyed the ancient Renaissance altarpiece of Andrea Vicentino, depicting The Miracle of the Madonna of the Snow. Dusi attempted to make an accurate copy (1833) of the icon. In 1834 he painted an altarpiece of Saints Filomena, Lucy, and Agatha (1834) for the Venetian church of San Martino. Saints Filomena, Lucy, and Agatha Painting by Cosroe Dusi, San Martino Church After the Teatro La Fenice burned down in a fire, Dusri was commissioned in 1837-1838 to paint the sipario (main drop-curtain) for the newly rebuilt theater house.Nani-Mocenigo, page 212. The subject of the curtain was, appropriately, the Apotheosis of the Phoenix, however, by 1854, this curtain was replaced by a more patriotic and nationalistic scene. Drusi also painted screens for the San Samuele theater of Venice and the Nobile theater of Udine. The subject of the latter was Michelangelo presenting the young Giovanni da Udine to the Duke Gonzaga. In 1838, Drusi designed and Francesco Locatelli engraved prints celebrating the visit of Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria. The subjects were Celebration of the Completion of the Dam of Malamocco and Entry of the Emperor into Chioggia. For an exhibition held in the Venetian Academy to celebrate the visit, Drusi displayed seven works: Romeo and Juliet; the Communion of St Martin of Tours, (Socrates reproaches) Alcibiades among the Heterae;Alcibiades among the Heterae is exhibited in the Revoltella Museum in Trieste, the Prayers of his bride convince Henry IV to absolve the prisoners of Calais; a Landscape, Portraits of a family, and finally an unspecified sketch for a historical painting. Work in Russia Dusi had briefly lived in Munich, Bavaria, where he had painted mainly portraits, but around 1840, the Grand Duke Nicholas of Russia, after visiting his Venetian studio, invited Dusi to St Petersburg. In Russia, he painted portraits of the Grand Duke and members of the imperial family and the court, including General Suhozanet (1842), Kavos (1849), of Feodosiya Tarassova Gromova. His Mary Queen of Scots led to the scaffold granted him membership in the Academy of Fine Arts of St. Petersburg in 1842, another painting of Alcibiades among the Heterae, made him an academician (1843), and finally, his Deposition, obtained him a post of professor (1851). In Russia, he also painted still lifes and landscapes. He participated in the encaustic decoration of the wooden ceiling of the gallery of ancient painting of the Hermitage, depicting the Seasons and antique artworks and buildings, (based on drawings by Georg Hiltensperger).Hermitage Museum . Dusi also painted numerous icons for the Cathedral of Saint Isaac in St Petersburg, later replaced by copies in mosaic, depicting: the Savior and Mary, Mother of God, for the right side of the altar iconostasis, a Last Supper, a Deposition, St Anastasia and St Catherine of Alexandria (1844-1855). He painted for private chapels of the buildings of the capital and country estates. Dusi decorate the ceiling of the Marinsky Theater and two curtains, both lost, one for the Bolshoi theater in Moscow, depicting Ilsolenne entrance of Prince Po≈æorskij into Moscow, and the other, probably for the Alexandrine theater of St Petersburg in 1858. The czar awarded him the Order of St. Anne of third class and the Order of St Stanislaus of third class.Treccani Encyclopedia. Return to Venice In 1831, Dusi had been made honorary associate for the Venetian Academy,Exhibit on Dusi Arte Arti notes. (In Italian) and he had over the years periodically revisited his native Venice. He returned to Venice to stay finally in 1856, and hoped without success, for a professorship in the Academy.

It is a rough- woolled breed of southern Mediterranean type, and originates from the mountainous area of the Alta Langa, where the Apennines meet the Alps, in the province of Cuneo. It is raised mainly in the Langhe, but is found in several other regions of Italy including Abruzzo, Basilicata, Emilia‚ÄìRomagna, Liguria and Tuscany. History In the early twentieth century, attempts made to improve the meat yield of the breed by cross-breeding with Bergamasca stock were unsuccessful. Cross-breeding with French Lacaune and Larzac stock to improve milk production was also tried, but was soon abandoned in favour of selective breeding within the existing breed. The Delle Langhe breed is one of the seventeen autochthonous Italian sheep breeds for which a genealogical herdbook is kept by the Associazione Nazionale della Pastorizia, the Italian national association of sheep-breeders. Numbers were estimated at 40,000 in 1930, and at 12,000 in 1983. In 2006, 3653 head were registered in the herdbook; the conservation status of the breed was listed as \\"not at risk\\" by the FAO in 2007. In 2013 the total number recorded was 1800. The breed is listed as \\"at risk of extinction\\" by the region of Piemonte. Use The milk yield of the Delle Langhe breed, over and above that taken by the lambs, is about 102 ¬± 34 litres per lactation for primiparous, and 166 ¬± 63 l for pluriparous, ewes; it may reach 300 l per lactation. The milk has 6‚Äì7% fat and 5‚Äì6% protein. Lambs weigh 13‚Äì15 kg at 30 days, and are usually slaughtered at about that weight. Rams yield about 3 kg, ewes about 2.5 kg, of low-grade wool.

Biography * Born in Seville to a Catalan father (Floren√ß T√≥rtola Ferrer, d. 1891) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela, d. 1894), she was three years old when her family emigrated to London. In his book Tortola Valencia and Her Times (1982), Odelot Sobrac, one of her early biographers, said T√≥rtola Valencia developed a style that expressed emotion through movement and that she was inspired by Isadora Duncan. A member of Generaci√≥n del 13, her costumes are part of the collection of Centre de Documentaci√≥ i Museu de les Arts Esc√®niques. Her Spanish modernismo style enabled a career as a solo concert dance artist who performed classic, Oriental, and Spanish pieces. She made her debut at the Gaiety Theatre in London (1908), appearing at the Berlin Wintergarten theatre and the Folies Berg√®re of Paris in the same year. She performed in Nuremberg and London in 1909. One of the people she taught was the Anglo-Indian dancer Olive Craddock aka Roshanara.Roshanara, Victoria and Albert Museum, Retrieved 14 October 2015 In 1911, she made her Spanish debut at the Romea Theatre of Madrid.

She is \\"known for creating powerful folk-art-inspired tableaus that tackle traditional gender roles.\\" She works in a variety of media, including painting, installations, video, street art, and children's books.  Early life and education  As a teenager, Rojas visited a nursing home, where she would make portraits in pastel and oil, while she listened to the interesting stories of her subjects. She received her MFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and her BFA in Printmaking from the Rhode Island School of Design. At RISD, she originally studied printmaking, which informed her use of color, layering and sizing. In her search for non toxic paint, she discovered gouache, which she used to paint like a printmaker.  Career  Rojas work is inspired by folk art. She loves quilts and loves to tell stories, which is reflected in her work. In her more recent work, Rojas has moved from figurative paintings into pure geometric abstraction. Inspired by Native American textiles, Quaker Art, and Byzantine mosaics, Rojas creates narratives depicting interactions between humans and animals, focusing on history‚Äôs journey to find peace. She brings multiple artistic influences together in her textiles by incorporating abstract geometry found in quilts and architecture. Rojas is known for adding elements of female sexuality into her artwork. She does this to give credit to women and recognize their natural strengths.

History High on the wing of success at Lorient festival 1975, the band entered a Breton recording studio and released this rare album featuring for the first and last time Ricky Starrs. Volume I - Farewell to Nova Scotia is predating their first Topic album (released on LP in 1977 as Battlefield Band) and is followed by Volume II - Wae's me for Prince Charlie released on LP in 1978 on the Escalibur label as their second and last studio album on this label. The three studio albums that follow on the Topic label - Battlefield Band (1977), At The Front (1978) and Stand Easy (1979) - would be pretty much in the same vein. Battlefield Band is a trio made up of the founder members Alan Reid, Brian McNeill and string player Ricky Starrs. Alan Reid on vocals does the singing in much of the songs. Most of the music (7 songs, 5 instrumentals) is Scottish, but there is still Irish, Canadian, English and Australian influences here. Ricky Starrs would later be replaced by singer/bouzouki player Jamie McMenamy and whistle player John Gahagan, making Battlefield Band a quartet...

He was a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly. Early life Aloomba State School, circa 1914 Bunny Adair and Gladys Down, Freshwater Hall near Cairns after their marriage, 1928 Herbert Arthur Adair was born 23 August 1905 at Wolfram Camp, Queensland, Australia, the son of Cecil Henry Adair and his wife Helen (n√©e Barratt). Adair was educated at state schools in Herberton, Wolfram and Aloomba and at the Mount Carmel College, Charters Towers. In 1926, he moved to Freshwater where he resided for the rest of his life. He had a varied career as a miner, canecutter, cane farmer, contract carrier and publican. During World War II, Adair served in the 2nd Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF), Armoured Division, and 17 Field Regiment, 5th Division. On 15 February 1928, he married Gladys Hannah Down (daughter of the publican of the Freshwater Hotel) at Freshwater (near Cairns). The couple had two sons and a daughter. In later years, Bunny and Gladys would run the Freshwater Hotel. Politics Adair served as a councillor in the Mulgrave Shire Council from 1939 to 1946. He represented the electoral district of Cook from 7 March 1953 to 26 April 1957 as a member of the Labor Party. From 26 April 1957 to 1 June 1963, he represented Cook as a member of the Queensland Labor Party. From 1 June 1963 to 17 May 1969, he represented Cook as an independent. Adair did not contest the 1969 election in which Bill Wood won Cook for the Labor Party. Missing and rescue On Tuesday 27 July 1954, Bunny Adair, an experienced bushman, set out from Cape Tribulation to walk 20 miles to Bloomfield to inspect the country through which local people wanted to build a road. He was expected to arrive the following day and the alarm was raised when he did not appear. The police organised search parties. On Friday 30 July, a man was spotted on the beach about seven miles north of Cape Tribulation by Australian National Airways pilot Bob Rowell who was conducting an air search in an Auster aircraft. Rowell dropped a note onto the beach asking \\"Who are you?\\". The man responded by writing \\"Bunny Adair\\" with a stick in the sand. A note was then dropped telling him to stay put and another pilot did an aerial drop of food and cigarettes. The tug Tully Falls was dispatched from Port Douglas to rescue Adair. Unfortunately, rough seas prevented the tug from rescuing Adair and so an aerial ambulance (an Auster) made a hazardous landing on the beach at Cape Tribulation and Adair walked down the beach to be rescued from there. Adair explained that he had encountered impenetrable jungle about two miles from Bloomfield and had been forced to return to the coast. He had had little food left when the search aircraft spotted him. Adair was flown back to his home in Cairns, described as very tired but otherwise in good health. Later life Bunny Adair died on 21 October 1994 in North Queensland. On 25 October, a requiem mass was held at St Monica's Cathedral, Cairns, after which he was buried with his wife in the Martyn Street cemetery in Cairns. Legacy Bunny Adair Park on Lower Freshwater Road, Freshwater was named after him. Adair Street in Yorkeys Knob was named after him.

Print. Laura M√©ndez went against traditional catholic gender norms of her time to pursue a career as an influential teacher and writer. She entered several literary circles during her youth through which she first met and became friends with Mexican writers of the time Augustine Manuel Acu√±a and F. Cuenca. Beside her literary career, M√©ndez was also an educator. She attended several international conferences on pedagogy as a representative of Mexico. She pushed for the modernization and secularization of Mexico's schooling system which included a three-part focus on \\"education, hygiene, and diet\\". While living in San Francisco, she submitted articles to numerous literary magazines which gave an international platform to her work as an active feminist. She co-founded The Protectorate Society of the Woman alongside Sandoval de Zarco, advancing feminism and protecting women's rights. She is remembered for fighting for women's right to education, to work, to write, and to live freely. After Dolores Correa Zapata stepped down, M√©ndez became director of a feminist magazine, called La Mujer Mexicana (The Mexican Woman) published from 1904 to 1906. The ideology was directed to the nineteenth century culture of domesticity, but it was one of the first Mexican magazines written by women for women. The women who wrote for La Mujer Mexicana were poets, writers, teachers, lawyers, and doctors, including besides M√©ndez, attorney Mar√≠a Sandoval de Zarco; writers Mar√≠a Enriqueta Camarillo y Roa de Pereyra and her mother Dolores Roa B√°rcena, Dolores Jim√©nez y Muro and Dolores Correa Zapata, who was also a teacher; the medical doctors Columba Rivera, Guadalupe S√°nchez and Antonia Urs√∫a; and the teachers Luz Fern√°ndez Vda. de Herrera and Mateana Murgu√≠a de Aveleyra. Her accessible, yet powerful writing style is remembered for its role in the early advocacy of feminism and the elegant expression of one of Mexico's great writers.

Self- Portrait Biography Raimondi moved to Reggio Emilia as an infant, and lived there for 27 years. He studied in Reggio as a pupil of Prospero Minghetti, then studied with Giovanni della Rocca and finally Paolo Toschi at Parma (1822-1828). He became in 1848 a docent teaching engraving at the Brera Academy in Milan, until he was recruited in 1854 to direct the School of Engraving at the Parmesan Academy, where he later succeeded Toschi. He worked by his own and in collaboration with Toschi, making wood engravings of masterpieces of the galleries of Parma, Turin, and Florence. In Parma, Raimondi gathered prominent pupils: Antonio Costa from the Academy of Fine Arts of Florence, Tommaso Aloysio Juvara from the Academy of Fine Arts of Naples, Ludovico Bigola from the Albertina Academy of Turin, Odoardo Eichens from the School of Fine Arts of Berlin. When the 1860 decree of the minister Luigi Carlo Farini fused into one the Academies of Fine Arts of Parma, Modena, and Bologna; Parma was recognized as still being the premier school of engraving of the three. He also painted, mainly watercolors; again sometimes reproducing masterworks, but also portraits and genre works such as Canzone d‚Äôamore and Alla toilette, displayed at the 1852 exhibition at the Academy of Fine Arts of Parma. Among his masterworks are his portraits of Paolo Toschi and Vittorio Emanuele II, and his La Baccante from a painting of Annibale Carracci. Mostly worked in Parma. In the 1870 National Exposition of Fine Arts, he was awarded a personal merit medal.Biblioteche of Parma , short biography.

His book on male-male erotic scenes in ancient Athenian vase-painting (Images of Ancient Greek Pederasty: Boys Were Their Gods, co-authored with Eva Cantarella, Routledge 2008), was positively reviewed: it greatly expanded the number of known scenes and proposed a sophisticated framework for their interpretation. He has written articles on topics including gender ideals in the work of Greek poets Anacreon and Theognis, as well as book reviews for Classical World. Lear is seen as an expert on the comparison between ancient and modern views and practices of gender and sexuality. Lear has taught at Harvard, Columbia, Pomona College, and NYU. He won the Harvard Certificate for Excellence in Teaching four times. His teaching reflects a wide range of interests in the Humanities. Before doing his PhD in Classics, Lear taught French and Italian language courses at Harvard: he is fluent in both languages, as well as German. He was also a section leader for Helen Vendler's course \\"Poems, Poets, Poetry.\\" As a Classics professor, he has taught courses in departments of Classics, History, and Women's and Gender Studies, including Greek and Latin language, Greek and Roman history, Greek literature, and courses on gender and sexuality.

He was the president of the North Carolina chapter of the American Federation of Labor ‚Äì Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) from 1969 to 1981. Hobby also was active in North Carolina politics, running unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for Governor in 1972. Hobby strove to provide security and stability to the working lives of ordinary people, something he never had as a child. He used politics as a means to this end, but he entered the field at a time when segregationist forces were still very strong in the South. Hobby attempted to counter this by promoting a populist message that crossed racial lines that he hoped would become part of mainstream political conversation in North Carolina. However, his career ended in scandal with a conviction on felony corruption charges in 1981. Early life, education, and service Wilbur Hobby was born in Durham in 1925, the son of a bricklayer and a cleaning lady who divorced when he was eight years old. The family struggled to make ends meet throughout most of his childhood. Sometimes, he had to skip school to pick up free groceries for the family, which included four brothers. Hobby moved more than twenty times, usually within the blue-collar Edgemont section of Durham. His father abandoned the family when he was seven or eight years old.Hobby, Wilbur. \\"Interview with Wilbur Hobby, March 13, 1975.\\" By William Finger. Southern Oral History Program. Accessed November 6, 2014. http://docsouth.unc.edu/sohp/html_use/E-0006.html Hobby dropped out of school in the ninth grade. He then worked various odd jobs, including as the Durham Bulls first uniformed batboy. For a brief period of time, he moved to Dayton to work as a trainer for a minor league baseball team, the Dayton Ducks. Hobby returned to Durham in 1942. He stated that \\"[t]he war was going on and November rolled around and I became seventeen and so I threatened to kill myself if my mother didn't sign for me to get into the navy\\". Hobby served in the South Pacific. His ship participated in the retaking of the Philippines. Hobby also saw action near China before he was discharged in 1946. His oldest brother, however, did not survive the war; he was killed in Saint-L√¥, France, in 1944. Labor career=Early years at American Tobacco Hobby returned to Durham in 1946. He took a job at the American Tobacco Company's plant in Durham as a machine oiler for 75 cents per hour and joined the Tobacco Workers International Union without much thought.Smith, William M. \\"Labor's Big Boy Works 15 Hour Days.\\" Durham Morning Herald (Durham, NC), August 29, 1976, Front, A1. In fact, Hobby had developed some anti-labor sentiments during the war, viewing workers who went on strike as selfish while soldiers risked their lives defending the right to strike.Mosley, Terry Lynn. \\"Let's Keep the Big Boys Honest: Wilbur Hobby, the Life of a North Carolina Labor Leader, 1925-1992.\\" Master's thesis, North Carolina Central University, 2006. Hobby credits a specific instance during a night shift as changing his attitude towards unions. His tasks suddenly were split onto two floors instead of just one, making it extremely difficult to get everything required done in the allotted time. When he asked a friend what to do about the situation, Hobby was referred to their union representative. A day later, all was back to normal, and Hobby had discovered how a union could provide security and stability in the workplace. He went to the next meeting simply to express his gratitude, and he guessed that he ended up going to every successive one for the next fifteen years. Hobby's interest in the union was duly noted, and he was soon elected president of the plant's night shift. Hobby's tenure was short-lived, however, because he was called back into the U.S. Navy in 1950 during the Korean War. He served for 18 months. During this time period, Hobby's opinion on racial issues began to take on their mature form. During the Korean War, Blacks were not required to eat at separate tables from whites (President Truman legally desegregated the armed forces in 1948). Despite his expectations of an awful experience, Hobby decided to sit with two Blacks one day. Reflecting back on the experience years later, Hobby said, \\"I was visibly surprised when I didn't feel any physical pain. I was ‚Ä¶ twenty-five years old and expecting physical pain just because I sat down and ate with them\\". Rise to power Upon his return to Durham, Hobby decided to enroll at Duke University, where he studied political science and labor economics. He combined this with his old job at the tobacco plant and also became the editor of the Durham Labor Journal, a pro-union publication. Feeling overworked, Hobby dropped out of Duke a semester short of graduation in 1955.\\"Wilbur Hobby.\\" In The North Carolina Century, edited by Howard E. Covington, Jr. and Marion A. Ellis. N.p.: University of North Carolina Press, 2002. This aided Hobby's rise in the labor movement. Already well-versed in the North Carolina political scene, Hobby was appointed Southern political director of the Textile Workers Union of America in 1958, and became director of the AFL-CIO Committee on Political Education (COPE) for the seven southern states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, and West Virginia (comprising Area 3) only one year later. Hobby spent the 1960s organizing the spread of unions in the South and promoting AFL-CIO-endorsed candidates for public office. He also strove to become president of the North Carolina chapter of the AFL-CIO, and was successful on his fourth attempt in 1969. Hobby considered the previous president, Milton Barbee, too timid to lead the organization into the future. Political career The overarching theme of Hobby's career in politics was to advance populist causes and the position of labor. He served in a variety of roles to make this possible, with his interest in politics becoming evident by the late 1940s. Early years at Voters for a Better Government (VBG) Hobby's first union leadership position at the American Tobacco Company's local plant was his stepping stone into politics. He was elected president of Voters for a Better Government (VBG), an officially non-partisan, but Democratic-leaning, Durham-based organization in 1949. Uniting liberal academics from Duke University and North Carolina Central University with laborers of all races, VBG helped elect the progressive Dan Edwards as Mayor of Durham. Hobby became part of the Durham County Democratic Party power structure, and he soon involved VBG in the 1950 Senate race, which pitted conservative Democratic candidate Willis Smith against Frank Graham, the former president of the University of North Carolina, who had been appointed to the position. Smith won with a campaign that characterized Graham as pro-integration and as likely pro-communist. Hobby was frustrated by the obvious racial undertones of the loss and concluded he had to work harder to develop a message that would unite, not split, white labor and Blacks. VBG's efforts to register more Blacks increased under his leadership, with Hobby working with Dan Martin, a Black political organizer to try to end the Jim Crow system that prevented Blacks from exercising their rights as citizens. Director of Committee on Political Education (COPE) Hobby continually ran into the same racial issues in politics, particularly when he served as southern director of the AFL-CIO's Committee on Political Education (COPE) from 1958 to 1969. The Durham United Political Education Committee (DUPEC) allied with conservative businesspeople to eliminate Hobby's and his allies' control of the Democratic Party. DUPEC accused Hobby of \\"selling their jobs to the NAACP\\". Throughout North Carolina, white unionists flocked to segregationist gubernatorial candidate I. Beverly Lake in the 1960 election, and many supported Alabama Governor George Wallace in the 1960 and 1964 Presidential elections. Hobby used his position at COPE to fight back against the segregationists, rallying support around candidates including Al Gore, Sr. in Tennessee and Claude Pepper in Florida. He also spearheaded the AFL-CIO's endorsement of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in the South, a position that initially ran counter to many of the candidates he backed. Hobby said, quite bluntly, \\"Civil rights are not [just] Negro rights. Civil rights are the human rights of every citizen\\".  1972 gubernatorial campaign Over the course of a quarter century, Hobby developed a number of political allies, and forged relationships with a unique cross-section of the population. In 1972, he became the first union leader to run for governor in North Carolina history. Hobby knew he was an underdog, and hoped to use his candidacy to bring his populist viewpoints into mainstream political conversation. His campaign slogan was \\"Let's Keep the Big Boys Honest\\". =Platform and political positionsTaxes and income inequality A champion of the underprivileged, Hobby felt that relative tax rates were unjust and bad for the middle and lower classes. He believed that enough revenue was collected to create a useful pool of government services, but the wealthy were paying too little and the poor too much for them to have any meaningful impact on people's lives. He argued that setting the amount of state taxes due as a progressive proportion of the federal income rate owed would rectify the situation. Hobby also opposed existing sales taxes on food and medicine, which he thought unfairly targeted the least fortunate. Education Hobby called for expanded vocational programs for North Carolina's students, but opposed those who wished to technically train students from the very beginning of their educational careers.Hobby, Wilbur. Hobby and the Issues. N.p.: n.p., 1972. He felt that the purpose of the education system was to produce well-rounded individuals and capable citizens. He also wished to help more of North Carolina's students obtain at least some college training by having the state of North Carolina match pre-existing federal funds for community colleges, a plan that was not popular at a time when more than half of the state's high school graduates went on to no further schooling. Housing North Carolina provided one of the lowest qualities of life for its citizens of any state in the early 1970s. Twenty percent of residences were classified as having inadequate plumbing or being overcrowded, with far more substandard by other measures. Hobby's political agenda in this area was complicated by the fact that three quarters of these housing units were located in rural areas. Hobby wanted to increase the amount of funding for projects in cities, too, so there was no single solution. His goal was to create a third path for impoverished rural folks that did not involve accepting a substandard status quo or being forced into cities. Vietnam and women's rights Hobby's liberalism was evident in his views on a host of other foreign and domestic policy issues. He opposed the war in Vietnam, called out Blue Shield and Blue Cross for their extreme rate hikes, and supported the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), which passed Congress the year of his campaign (1972). Despite the initial opposition of the AFL- CIO, Hobby helped push the organization to reverse its stance on the ERA, which it did publicly in 1973. =Campaign= Hobby could not overcome his late start, lack of funding, and policy views that were to the left of what was a conservative electorate, even in a Democratic primary. He tried to organize debates, but his campaign was not important enough for other candidates to feel the need to reciprocate. One illuminating event involved a speech on the state capitol grounds about a week before the election. Labor was expected to bus in thousands of supporters, but only 250 people attended. Even with the small crowd, Hobby gave a blistering speech about the issues plaguing the little guy in North Carolina politics. He came in last in the primary with 7% of the vote, and the only municipality he won was Chapel Hill. However, his candidacy did help cause a runoff between the two frontrunners, Hargrove Bowles and Pat Taylor. Hobby also maintained that his cause helped the unions, bringing attention to the workers' issues in an anti-union state.Bass, Jack. The Transformation of Southern Politics: Social Change and Political Consequence Since 1945. N.p.: University of Georgia Press, 1995. Decline and felony conviction What ultimately brought down Wilbur Hobby was not electoral defeat; it was the criminal justice system. There were some early warning signs that Hobby did not always play by the rules: during the first day of his gubernatorial campaign he pledged to not accept donations of more than $200 from any group, but he took in $10,000 from the AFL-CIO the next day. Hobby's opponents also accused him of spending too much on himself as AFL-CIO President, leading a lavish lifestyle while not truly representing the workers.Adams, James I. \\"Another View of Hobby, Labor's \\"Big Boy.'\\" Durham Morning Herald (Durham, NC), September 12, 1976. Hobby's executive career came to a sudden end in 1981. Using connections with new, union-friendly governor Jim Hunt, Hobby secured $1,000,000 in funding for job training programs under the federal Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) between 1977 and 1979. Hobby initially got funds awarded to Precision Graphics, a printing company he headed. Hobby and his business partner, Mort Levi, recognized the need for computers at the union and hoped to cut out the middleman by founding Precision Data together in early 1979. Precision Data proceeded to purchase several expensive computers with multi-year payment plans.United States of America v. Wilbur Hobby, 702 LexisNexis (4th Cir. 1983). Despite having no substantive capital, employees, or history as a company, Precision Data, under Hobby's direction, applied for a CETA contract to help train women to gain data skills. The board in charge of approving such contracts met the application with skepticism, and instead decided to award it to Precision Graphics, whom they felt were better equipped to use the funds. Suddenly in financial trouble, Precision Data began leasing its computers to Precision Graphics for hefty fees. Over the course of the next few months, it became apparent that funds were being intentionally diverted from Precision Graphics to Precision Data, most notably a $28,000 payment for \\"transportation of students\\" that never occurred. A year later, state and federal audits that found substantial funds unaccounted for (around $34,000). This led to indictments for Hobby and Levi for defrauding the federal government. The two were convicted at trial. Hobby served a year in jail and paid a $40,000 fine. He also lost his position as North Carolina AFL-CIO President. Final years and legacy Upon his release, Hobby returned to the same machine-oiling job at American Tobacco that he occupied 35 years earlier. He remained there until his retirement in 1986. Hobby was bedridden for about 4 years before his death on May 9, 1992 at the Durham Veterans' Affairs Hospital after a long illness, involving a weak heart and lungs due to his obesity and diabetes.Orlando Sentinel (Orlando, FL). \\"Wilbur Hobby.\\" May 12, 1992, Other News to Note - Deaths. Though his personal political endeavors were unsuccessful and his career ended ignominiously, Hobby was an important figure in North Carolina's post-World War II era. He was a champion of the underprivileged, be they laborers or Blacks, and he tried to bring their struggles to the public's attention.

Personal  Ellen Eglin was born in 1849, in Washington, D.C. While living in D.C., Eglin made her living as a housekeeper and a government clerk.  Invention  thumbExample of a Clothes Wringer that was used during the 19th century In 1800s, she invented a special type of clothes-wringer which was a machine that had two rollers in a frame that was connected to a crank. Clothes would be fed in between the two rollers and as the crank was turned the clothes would have the water pressed out of them. A clothes wringer was made from two wooden pins that are on top of each other with a crank attached to allow the pins to roll. This invention came at a time when there were not a lot of ways to wash clothes other than with your hands. After scrubbing the laundry by hand on the washboard, it was necessary to wring the clothes out by hand and them hand them to dry. Ellen realized that there had to be a better way to wring the water out of clothes. So, she put her mind to it and came up with something that revolutionized the very necessary act of washing clothes. Because of this old, long process, this became an amazing invention and concept. However, Eglin decided to sell her patent to a ‚Äúwhite person interested in manufacturing the product‚Äù for $18. In the April 1890 issue of Woman Inventor, Eglin was quoted as saying ‚ÄúYou know I am black and if it was known that a Negro woman patented the invention, white ladies would not buy the wringer. I was afraid to be known because of my color in having it introduced into the market that is the only reason.‚Äù The buyer went on to reap considerable financial awards. Her wringer is still used for mops today.  Later work  After selling her clothes-wringer she remained hopeful to patent a second device. She was funding this invention by herself and wanted a patent for it so that people could know that ‚Äúthe invention will be known as a black woman‚Äôs.‚Äù Despite wanting to exhibit the new model at the Women's International Industrial Inventors Congress, she never went on to patent it. In fact, there is no information that she ever created this invention. She went on to work as a clerk in a census office. Eglin was in a rare position as an inventor because she was one of only a few African American women inventors. She set the stage for later inventors such as Madam C.J. Walker, as well as Sarah Boone. Although Eglin invention became very successful, there is still a lack of sources on the events that took place in her life.

The church was founded in the late 1960s by Stanley M. King and is currently led by his son, Fred King. It reportedly has under 40 members, down from a high of around 80. The group started as a fundamentalist offshoot of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church, now known as the Community of Christ). Like other fundamentalist Latter Day Saint churches, members practice polygamy and a form of the communal United Order. The church also runs a printing business called Resto Graphics, based in Mississauga, Ontario. After breaking from the RLDS Church, Stan King (known as \\"Prophet\\" by his followers) reinstated the old Mormon practice of plural marriage. Former church member Carol Christie claims King already had three \\"church wives\\" when she married him in the 1970s. One of his other wives was 14 years old at the time. Christie claims King later married three other children, ranging in age from ten to 17. In the 1980s, the church moved from a farmhouse in Sauble Beach to its current headquarters, a bankrupt ski resort near Chatsworth, Ontario. King died of stroke in 1986 at the age of 58. Church members prayed for his resurrection and kept his body unburied for a week, but King remained dead. Following King's death, leadership of the church passed to his son, Fred. The younger King also took on his father's wives, and allegedly has had as many as seven wives at one time. The Ontario Provincial Police initiated an investigation of the church following a CTV Television Network news story about alleged polygamy and abuse by church leaders. The investigation was ongoing as of April 2013. Bruce Grey Family and Children's Services also investigated the church, but found no evidence of children being harmed. Criminal charges In April 2014, after a 16-month police investigation, authorities charged Fred King and his brother Judson William King with 31 counts dating from 1978 to 2008. Two Canada-wide arrest warrants were issued, and on April 4, Judson was apprehended and charged with \\"assault with a weapon, uttering death threats and four counts of assault.\\" Fred King was arrested on April 11 without incident and was released on $50,000 conditional bail on April 16. Fred King was charged with sexual exploitation, sexual interference, three counts of sexual assault, three counts of assault causing bodily harm, four counts of uttering death threats, two counts of assault with a weapon, and 10 counts of assault. The brothers were scheduled to attend first-appearance court in the Ontario Court of Justice in Owen Sound, Ontario, on May 15, 2014. Preliminary hearings were set for both Judson and Fred King on November 17, 2014, and March 23‚Äì25, 2015, respectively. A publication ban has also been imposed.

This fourth installment is based on the experiences of the author both as a migrant and a Latino out. Plot summary This novel focuses on Latin-American immigrants‚Äô drama in the US, particularly undocumented experiences. In a deeper sense, Crisis talks about the universal experiences of people getting away from a geographical region, evidently seeking a better way of life but in truth, running away, escaping from realism distinguished as unjust but solved rarely by moving to another place. Escaping, moving, and missing persons are like regular characters in the novel of Jorge Majfud, which record their courses to their own identity‚Äôs discovery in various situations and realities. The characters within the novel encounter obstacles in terms of cultural, economic and moral cruelties as unavoidable factors of their experiences ‚Äì as existential and social living beings. Taiano, Leonor, \\"Huyendo hacia la paradoja del t√≠o Sam: Consideraciones sobre Crisis de Jorge Majfud\\", Finisterre: en el √∫ltimo lugar del mundo, Destiempos, 2017, pp. 123-148. According to the author Alberto Garc√≠a-Teresa, Crisis ‚Äúis formed by the juxtaposition of fragments from different stories, headed with the date, place (different towns in the USA located close to the southern borders) and the value of the Dow Jones Index. [...] At the same time, the multiplicity of cities in which we can find (apparently) the same characters, works as a hint about the wandering life of undocumented immigrants. In this way we obtain a novel with a collective main character in which we have no loss of individuality. Crisis turns out as a moving book, representing a hard story, full of injustice, pain and abuse of authority. The author explores the fears, dreams and hopes of the immigrants through representative scenes, with a great symbolic and metonymic value, happening to a specific character, even though they could also happen to any other. In fact, the dislocation works well to globalize the event, since it is possible for them to happen in one same place like in any other. On the one hand, it plays with diverse kinds of narrator and focuses on the different spheres involved: migrants,Taiano, Leonor. ‚ÄúCrisis: el compromiso majfudiano y la di√°spora latinoamericana‚Äù.

[...] Majfud shows a great success using this kind of construction in his novel, as he fosters his discourse targets and, by itself, the structure adds content in the same direction. As a result, it is a very rich work, in which tens of characters wander and try to survive in a world governed by a ruthless economic system. This way, the bright denunciation of Majfud appeals to dignity and humanism in a bitter and discouraging story.‚ÄùGarc√≠a-Teresa, Alberto. \\"Crisis\\", Revista Viento Sur, no. 126.

Bibliography Procesa del Carmen Sarmiento was born in San Juan, Argentina to Paula Zoila Albarrac√≠n and Jos√© Clemente Cecilio Sarmiento. She was the youngest of fifteen children. Her brother Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, taught Procesa to read and her mother taught her to make crafts. She learned drawing and painting in San Juan from Amadeo Gras. She taught at the College of Santa Rosa, while still taking classes in art and other specialties. Because of her opposition to the government of Juan Manuel de Rosas, Processa and her brothers Domingo and Bienvenida were forced to emigrate to Chile, where they founded a school in San Felipe de Aconcagua. In 1843, she moved to Santiago where her brother was a journalist. She took classes with the French painter Raymond Monvoisin. In 1850, she married the engineer Jean-Michel-Benjamin Lenoir, with whom she had two daughters (Sof√≠a and Victorina). Return to Argentina In 1857, the family returned to San Juan and soon moved to Mendoza where Sarmiento established an art school which was attended by children of local families where they painted portraits and still life. In 1868, she returned permanently to San Juan, where in 1872, she taught painting at the High School for Girls, and in 1878, was president of the Charitable Society. In 1882, her paintings were exhibited at the Continental Exhibition of Buenos Aires and in 1884, there was an organized exhibition in San Juan where her students exhibited their paintings. She died in 1899 in San Juan. The \\"Year of Procesa Sarmiento Lenoir\\" was declared in 2008 in honor of her 190th birthday. Her letters are preserved in the Museum of Buenos Aires.

It was originally constituted 22 May 1846 in the Kentucky Militia as the 1st Kentucky Cavalry and the 2d Kentucky Volunteer Infantry. After a year of Federal service (June 1846 to June 1847), it was reorganized on 15 June 1860 in the Kentucky State Guard as the Lexington Battalion (which included the Lexington Rifles). It was then expanded in November 1860 to comprise the Lexington Battalion and the Kentucky River Battalion. The Lexington and Kentucky River Battalions, antecedents to the 149th Infantry, are especially notable in military history in that they were some of the few military units to ever be split between two different countries for the duration of a war. Service Career=American Civil War In 1861, after the outbreak of the American Civil War, the 149th Infantry Regiment (at the time part of the Kentucky State Militia and comprising the Lexington Battalion and the Kentucky River Battalion), was split between the Union and the Confederacy by the Kentucky General Assembly. The reason for this was the Kentucky State Government had declared neutrality in the war. They were officially recognized as part of both countries, and, although Kentucky never officially seceded from the United States, many soldiers within the state militia held Confederate sympathies. This was made more complicated when President Abraham Lincoln began drafting soldiers to fight the Confederacy, as they needed military units to join. To prevent the collapse of the Kentucky State Militia, the General Assembly voted to split the entire militia in half. This included the antecedents of the 149th Infantry Regiment. Between April‚ÄìJune 1861, soldiers with Union sympathies were reorganized as the 1st and 2nd Volunteer Kentucky Infantry regiments, while soldiers with Southern sympathies were reorganized into the 1st Kentucky Brigade (The Orphan Brigade). The two halves of the Kentucky Militia only fought each other once, at the Battle of Shiloh. World War I The history of the 149th Infantry, with that number, goes back to April 28, 1917. But the History of the 149th Infantry correctly states that as the 2nd Kentucky, the regiment had many years of service before 1917. The 38th Division deployed to Europe in October 1918, where it landed in France at the height of the German \\"Peace Offensives\\". Because the division was not combat ready, it was largely stripped of officers and men, who served as replacements for units already in combat. The 149th Infantry Regiment was broken up in this way to provide replacements. World War II The 149th Infantry Regiment was officially activated from 17 January 1941, to 9 November 1945. Status today The military unit has been active in the Louisville, Kentucky area since the 149th Infantry Regiment Combat Team was activated after World War II. The U.S. Army Center for Military History attributes lineage and honors to the Louisville unit further back than that. It has the Special Designation 'Second Kentucky', commemorating its previous state designation. The numerical designation, but not the lineage or honors, is now carried on in the 149th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade.

He was one among the few founders of CPI(M-L) who remained active till the end of their lives. Childhood Patnaik spent his childhood days at Padmapur, Rayagada. He completed his primary education at Padmapur and then the family moved to Gunupur where his schooling continued in the Govt. Boys' High School, Gunupur. In one of his interviews at Gunupur, he has revealed one interesting story of his childhood. During his childhood once it so happened that his father got a complaint about Nagbhushan beating some boy and so his father chased him to punish. Nagbhushan started running and managed to enter into a temple, but his father closed the door. When Nagbhushan saw that there was no escape, he took a piece of brick in his hand to throw it at his father & warned him to face unwanted consequences, if he is caught. His father was very much annoyed, started laughing, took him to his back and surrendered before Lord Shiva. From that fearful day on wards the boy was known as Nagbhushan(means the Lord wearing snake). The spirit of Naxalbari At the age of 15, he joined the A.I.S.F. during his graduation at S.K.C.G. College of Paralakhemundi. Then he joined the BHU for his post graduation course. He was greatly influenced by the socialistic atmosphere at BHU. Very few people knew that Nagbhushan was a poet too. Najrul Islam was his inspiration. He knew well many languages like Oriya, Telugu, Bengali, but most of his writings are in English. Nagbhushan's poems of prisons has been released in Bhubaneswar on 26 August 2012 Nagbhushan was a practising lawyer at Gunupur. He met DBM Patnaik at Gunupur where both of them defended poor peasant cases. Campaigning true Naxalism Statue of N.B. Patnaik at By-pass chowk -Gunupur *When the Communist party was divided in 1964, Nagbhushan and his comrades joined CPIM. In the beginning of the 60th decade he made several efforts for uniting the local adivasis of Malkangiri and the workers of Balimela area and geared up the movement in his own ways. He was arrested with other leaders in 1966 & was kept at Tihar Jail. In the jail he met the Telangana leader-Sundaraya. He discussed with him about his action plan of which Sunderaya became a great supporter. *When Comrade Ramamurthy, who was in charge of the trade union movement directed him to slow down the movement and to keep it within the democratic process, he could not accept the policy. He then geared up his armed-peasants movement and workers movement in his own way. With the change in the policies of CPIM, he started getting away from the party policies. The revolutionary communist party CPIML.(Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) . was founded on 22 April 1969 & Nagbhushan was one of the founding leaders. *In 1966, he underwent a stomach operation which made him weak physically. In January 1969, he along with DBM Patnaik tried to mobilize the peasants in the villages in Gunupur area to fight their right, but Odisha police could get the information & swooped down upon Naxal hideouts. However Nagbhushan could manage to escape an arrest till 15 July 1969, when he was arrested along with 10 comrades. On 8 October 1969, he could manage to escape from Vishakhapatnam central jail with 10 others only to taste the freedom for a short period. He was again arrested and put behind bars & was subjected to inhuman tortures. He was sentenced to death by the Sessions court of Vishakhapatnam in the Parvatipuram conspiracy case(in which Nagbhushan Patnaik was one of the principal accused persons) in Dec 1970. The next year, the sentence was confirmed by Andhra Pradesh High Court. Nagbhushan refused to appeal for clemency. *He languished in jail even after Janata Dal came to power. After the emergency was over the civil liberties groups, all his admirers as well as intellectuals and political veterans like Dr. Harekrushna Mahatab, Jayaprakash Narayan & Sarvodays leader Malati Choudhury raised their voice for release of Nagbhushan Patnaik. He never moved a mercy petition, rather wrote a letter to the jail Suptd. asking him to comply with the orders and also to donate his body parts to the needy. At last their efforts compelled the Govt. to commute the death sentence to life sentence. It was only after a long and arduous legal battle that he was released in the middle of 1981 when he was almost on his death-bed. On release, the great leader moved to his residence at Gunupur. He was instrumental in the founding of Indian People's Front. Death After his release on parole, he spent his days mostly at Gunupur. Most of the time he remained busy with his profession. There he, with DBM Patnaik continued his profession as lawyer. Nagbhushan was instrumental in the historic judgment passed by the Hon'ble Supreme court of India, declaring section 309 of the India Penal Code as unconstitutional.\\"Prisoners rights-Google Books-Writ challenging the validity of sec.309 of the Indian Penal Code(GR 177/1984 pending in the court of Sub Judge-JMFC, Gunupur)\\" Nagbhushan's strong moral stand gave him popularity across party lines. His lifelong mission to unify various revolutionary groups still remains a dream to be fulfilled. Nowadays some of the Naxal groups even forgot to stick to true naxalism and to respect the great leader. On 9 October 1998, Comrade Patnaik died in a private hospital at Chennai due to renal failure.

Once the young boy discovers that his dog can talk with his grandfather's old pipe, they go on adventures and solve crimes. The story was created by Yuma Ando with art by Yuki Sato. The manga was released in Japan in 2012 and translated to English officially in 2013. Plot The main character is Takeru Wajima, a 16‚Äëyear-old boy who attends London Academy Highschool. His love for dogs prompts him to take a trip to the pound and adopt a dog for himself. Feeling drawn to a quiet puppy, Takeru adopts the animal and heads off on his bike back home. Along the way he runs into his father who helps his son come up with a name for the new member of the family. Driven by a mysterious voice, Takeru names his new puppy Sherdog (English translation). After solving their first 'crime', Sherdog acquires the Wajima family pipe from their living room. With the pipe giving him the ability to speak, Takeru can understand his dog. Sherdog introduces himself as the living legend Sherlock Holmes, and believes Takeru to be his partner Dr. Watson. Together they solve crimes that come their way and form a bond of trust and partnership.  Characters  ;Sherdog Sherdog is the reincarnation of Sherlock Holmes who had died 100 years ago. He is a mixed breed puppy with floppy ears and wrinkly feet. Adopted by a teenage boy, he seeks to continue to solve crimes and protect the world from murderers. He frequently forgets he is a dog, and continues to try and act like a normal human despite his physical appearance. Using a pipe kept by his owners family, he can speak to Takeru to solve the mysteries for him. Sherdog continues to learn about the new world he lives in and adapts to the everyday life of being a dog. ;Takeru Wajima Takeru is a 16‚Äëyear‚Äëold second year high school student who is an extreme dog lover. His entire family is made up of cops and detectives, making his meddling in crime scenes less questionable. After adopting Sherdog, Takeru takes the role as his dog's partner Watson and helps voice out Sherdog's discoveries to uncover the mystery. Takeru is a kind and compassionate young man who makes many connections with people but accidentally gets himself into strange situations. ; Miki Arisaka Miki is a 16‚Äëyear‚Äëold who is Takeru's classmate in London Academy Highschool and is his current crush. She adores Sherdog and loves to spend time with Takeru. She is also a member of her highschool newspaper staff. When she is in trouble she turns to Takeru for help, showing she treasures him as a good friend. ; Airin Wajima Airin is Takeru's 24‚Äëyear‚Äëold sister and a detective in the Violent Crimes Division. She is known as an attractive woman and is thorough in her line of work. Takeru uses her as a way to get into crime scenes. Sherdog calls her Irene because she reminds him of his long lost love from 100 years ago. A big hint to her connection to Irene is when she (indirectly) serves Sherdog tea that she used to make for him when he was human. ; K≈çsuke Wajima K≈çsuke is Takeru's 48‚Äëyear‚Äëold father who works as a police sergeant. He witnesses the naming of Sherdog and loves the puppy when he meets him. He makes important arrests of criminals when called out by Takeru to prevent danger to his son. ; Satoko Wajima Satoko is Takeru's 46‚Äëyear‚Äëold mother who is a former policewoman and current housewife for her family. She accepts Sherdog at first, but comes to loath the puppy after he destroys things and sits in her personal rocking chair. She regretfully tolerates his antics because the puppy stopped a robber in their own home (by accident). She is the scariest member of the family.  References  Ando, Yuma. Yuki Sato.

Transparency reports generally disclose how frequently and under what authority governments have requested or demanded data or records over a certain period of time. This form of corporate transparency allows the public to discern what private information governments have gained access to through search warrants and court subpoenas, among other methods. Some transparency reports describe how often, as a result of government action or under copyright provisions, content was removed. Disclosing a transparency report also helps people to know about the appropriate scope and authority of content regulation for online discussions. Google first launched a transparency report in 2010, with Twitter following in 2012. Additional companies began releasing transparency reports as during the aftermath of the global surveillance disclosures beginning in 2013, and the number of companies issuing them has increased rapidly ever since. Transparency reports are issued today by a variety of technology and communications companies, including Google, Microsoft, Verizon, AT&T;, Twitter, Apple, Dropbox, Facebook, Yahoo and CloudFlare. Several companies and advocacy groups have lobbied the U.S. government to allow the number of secret data requests (requests which include a gag orders - including National Security Letters) to be described within ranges in the report. Government demand increases in years=Google Google's latest (10th) transparency report indicates that the government demands for data are increasing in recent years. This report shows demands from government in the first six months of 2014, and the firm said that it includes demands made under the US Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and through National Security Letters (NSLs). \\"FISA and NSL demands have increased by 15 percent during the six months, according to the firm, and by 150 percent over the 10 reports and the five year reporting period. That's globally. In the US the figures for the same period are 19 percent and 250 percent.\\" Google legal director Richard Salgado accepted that the government has to fight crime and deal with threats, but the opposition of data demands need to be considered as well. \\"This increase in government demands comes against a backdrop of ongoing revelations about government surveillance programs. Despite these revelations, we have seen some countries expand their surveillance authorities in an attempt to reach service providers outside their borders,\\" he said. \\"Governments have a legitimate and important role in fighting crime and investigating national security threats. To maintain public confidence in both government and technology, we need legislative reform that ensures surveillance powers are transparent, reasonably scoped by law, and subject to independent oversight.\\" The report shows that the US makes the most demands for Google users' data, and Google said that it made 12,539 requests that affected some 22,000 accounts. It added that it provided data in 84 percent of cases. In the UK it said there were 1,535 requests covering 1,991 users or accounts, and Google provided data for 72 percent of the requests. Yahoo The latest Yahoo transparency report was released on 25 September 2014. The report states that 30,511 users were affected by 18,594 government data requests.,whereas 57,324 accounts were affected by 29,470 government requests. However, both of these figures do not include those secret requests sent by the FISA court. During the last six month from July 1, 2013, to December 31, 2013, it received between 0 and 1998 FISA requests for user data, affecting up to 54,997 users (including national security letters). Comparing to the first sixth month from January 1, 2013 to June 30, 2013, 32,997 accounts was affected. As we can see from the figures, although the total number of data request drop, the number of data request approved from the FISA court have increased significantly. Overall, 41 percent of accounts affected by government data requests came from requests made by the U.S. government. Purpose Transparency reports may be published for a variety of purposes. One purpose could be to clarify how much information governments ask for, how such requests are evaluated, and how the receiving entity chose to respond. This information may lead consumers to the conclusion that the report's publisher is more trustworthy. However, there is some debate about what transparency reports really reveal. Some critics argue that mere quantities of requests may mislead consumers, since most entities have little control over the number of requests they receive, the breadth of the requests they receive, or even the number of requests they ultimately comply with. Companies such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Facebook, and Twitter all release transparency reports, all of which list the type and number of government data requests each company receives. these reports include exact numbers and shed a bright light on government activity. The U.S. government will not, however, permit companies to report exact numbers for national security requests or the number of requests that came under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance (FISA) Section 702, Patriot Act Section 215, or national security letters. Instead, they have to aggregate the numbers or provide a range. And that's even if the government permits a company to publish that data. Google may publish national security letter information, but not FISA information. Facebook may publish FISA information, but it must lump such data in with NSL information. As a result, consumers cannot see the true figure for total government data requests. Critics of this policy, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation, argue that there is no clear national security justification for blocking entities from releasing this information. Conflicts between government and company In June 2013, Google asked the Department of Justice for permission to disclose details about the number of FISA requests it receives. As a result, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Facebook followed suit immediately. However, the Department of Justice refused those requests, and they only provide the companies with a heavily redacted version of their arguments. Here's what Google legal director Richard Salgado had to say about FISA requests: \\"We want to go even further. We believe it‚Äôs your right to know what kinds of requests and how many each government is making of us and other companies. However, the U.S. Department of Justice contends that U.S. law does not allow us to share information about some national security requests that we might receive. Specifically, the U.S. government argues that we cannot share information about the requests we receive (if any) under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. But you deserve to know.\\" ‚ÄúOur ability to speak has been restricted by laws that prohibit and even criminalize a service provider like us from disclosing the exact number of national security letters ('NSLs') and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ('FISA') court orders received - even if that number is zero.‚Äùavian network's veep for legal Ben Lee has blogged. On 7 October 2014, Twitter announce that there will be a lawsuit against the United States government for violating its First Amendment right to freedom of speech. The Transparency Report which would reveal how many national security letters (NSLs) and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) orders Twitter receives. They provided a draft of the transparency report to the Department of Justice and discussed it for months. Twitter was still unable to get the permission for allowing them to publish even a redacted version of the report from the government. The response form FBI for its stance is that the information Twitter wants to publish \\"is classified and cannot be publicly released\\", they also said according to the framework provided on 27 January 2014, Twitter is only permitted to qualify its description of the total number of accounts affected by all national security legal process it has received but it cannot quantify that description with specific detail that goes well beyond what is allowed under the 27th Jan 2014 framework and that discloses properly classified information.'' About the government The United States government announced on 30 August 2013 that a transparency report which is in its own form will be released. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper announced the change on his office's Tumblr blog. He said that the decision will come naturally after President Barack Obama ordered the declassification of as much intelligence information as possible. Total numbers for national security letters, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) business records requests, FISA one register/trap and trace requests will be stated in the transparency report. Beside that, the report will also include the number of targets being investigated in each of these requests. The number will reflect the 12 months prior to the date published. The inspiration of the report comes from the recent surveillance program leaks from former NSA-contractor Edward Snowden, according to an anonymous source speaking with the Washington Post. Google, Twitter,and Facebook all release their own forms of transparency report, however they are not allowed to release this sort of information in their report.

It is about Sati culture that was prevalent in the Nepalese society until the 1920s in which wife had to immolate herself upon her husband's death, typically on his funeral pyre. For her role, actress Garima Panta won Best Actress award at SAARC Film Festival held in Sri Lanka, 2014. The film was selected as the Nepali entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 87th Academy Awards, but was not nominated. Sati custom Sati custom is an ancient practice of burning a widow on her deceased husband's funeral pyre or burning her alive in his grave. According to Hindu Scriptures, the custom of Sati was a voluntary practice in which a woman voluntarily decides to end her life with her husband after his death. But later the practice was abused and women were forced to commit Sati or were even dragged against their wish and put into the burning pyres. Historical accounts show that several Royal and common women were burnt alive through this savage practice. In BS 1977 Ashad 25 (1920 AD), Chandra Shumsher J.B.R. officially abolished the Sati system from Nepal. Plot Kanchi (Garima Panta) is a young woman who was married to an old husband who is 40 years elder. At present, Kanchi's husband is ill because of his old age and finally dies. Now, as per the social rules and regulation, Kanchi had to go to Sati where she should burn herself with her husband's deceased body. But, fate is on her side and she manages to survive. She starts to live in the cave of a nearby jungle. Ghanashyam, being lonely in the absence of his loving mother, visits the jungle and finds his mother hiding in the cave. Kanchi unites with her son but they are unable to stay in the same society because the society people would kill the women even though they have survived Sati in any means. Ghanashyam makes a plan of leaving the village and getting settled in another place so that they could make a new beginning. He asks his mother to stay in the jungle and goes home to bring their belongings. Later, Kanchi's brother-in-law and his wife join and assist them to leave the village. As Kanchi with son Ghanashyam are going to leave the village, they witness a woman, who is to be Sati but couldn't do so and runs away, being killed by the people of the funeral.

As a club professional he taught thousands of golfers and as a player he won 91 professional tournaments on the Australian golf circuit. Harris also served 6 years in the Australian Army during the Second World War. Harris won a record six Victorian PGA Championship titles from 1950 to 1963 and the Victorian PGA Championship trophy is named the \\"Jack Harris Cup\\" in his honour. He became a life member of PGA Australia (2001) in recognition of his distinguished services as a PGA member and his achievements in the golfing community. He also became an inaugural inductee into the Victorian Golf Hall of Fame (in 2011), alongside Peter Thomson, Burtta Cheney, Doug Bachli, Ivo Whitton and Bob Shearer. Harris became a junior PGA member before age 18, under professional Colin Campbell at Long Island Golf Club in 1940. His professional golfing career was then put on hold for the next six years when he was enlisted in the Australian Army during the Second World War. He spent this time serving as a sapper (a soldier of the engineer corps) in Darwin and later on Labuan Island in Borneo. Harris was discharged from the army in 1946, aged 24, to resume a golfing career after missing a critical development period. Harris was reacquainted with Colin Campbell and Bob Spencer (Campbell's nephew) who were running a teaching school on top of the Manchester Unity Building in Melbourne CDB. Later they worked in Hartley's sports store on Flinders St. All of Harris's teaching and practice at this time was done by hitting into nets off rubber mats. Harris won his first Victorian PGA in 1950 at age 28 while he was still teaching golf at Hartley's sports store. In mid-1950 Harris became club professional at Keysborough Golf Club where he stayed for most of his tournament playing career. Bob Spencer later followed as Harris's assistant. Throughout his time at Keysborough he earned his living as a typical club pro (by teaching, running the pro shop etc.) and just like many of his contemporaries practice time to sharpen up his game for tournament play was very limited. Despite this, Harris, throughout the 1950s and early 1960s was still ranked in the top handful of Australian golfers along with the likes of Peter Thomson, Jim Ferrier, Kel Nagle, Ossie Pickworth, Norman Von Nida, Eric Cremin, Frank Phillips, Bruce Crampton, Bruce Devlin. Even without overseas experience Harris recorded multiple tournaments wins against many golfers who were Australian Open winners including three of whom were also major winners. He also played in tournaments with many top overseas golfers who visited Australia such as Jack Nicklaus, Sam Snead, Art Wall Jr., Arnold Palmer, Gary Player, Bobby Locke, Ed Furgol, Ed Oliver, Max Faulkner, Dai Rees, Harry Weetman, Harold Henning, Peter Alliss, Jimmy Adams, and Sewsunker Sewgolum. After his tournament playing days were over Harris also spent 13 years as the club and teaching professional at Sorrento Golf Club on the Mornington Peninsula. Harris also continued as a teaching professional at his own school in St Kilda. He will also be remembered for his golf segment on the Channel 7 TV World of Sport programme in the 1960s alongside AFL legend Lou Richards, following on in this role from his first golf teacher, Colin Campbell. Even into his 80s Harris continued to organise a series of pro-am events for senior professionals. Harris was always willing to teach anyone who was interested in the game and was still assisting with lessons at the Wattle Park GC into his 90s. Harris died aged 91 in August 2014.

Life Henry Stephens was born at Keerpoy in Bengal, the son of Dr Andrew Stephens, a surgeon in the East India Company. Upon the death of his father in 1806, his family returned to Dundee in eastern Scotland, and Henry was educated at Dundee Grammar School and the Dundee Academy. Stephens then attended lectures on farming and agricultural chemistry at the University of Edinburgh. He later became a pupil and farmhand of a Berwickshire farmer named George Brown, in order to obtain some practical experience.Preface to 2010 reprint of the 1844 edition of Stephens's The Book of the Farm: Detailing the Labours of the Farmer, &c.; (Cambridge University Press, 2011), p. i His mother Sarah Stephens died in 1832 at Keerpoy , aged 66 years, wife of the late Andrew Stephens, esq, of Keerpoy.

In 1830 he took over Redbraes farm between Edinburgh and Leith. In 1837, he gave up farming, and spent the rest of his life writing works promoting advanced farming practices, documenting traditional methods, and familiarizing the reading public with the basic principles of agricultural science.

As a young girl, Smith was involved in a variety of activities including ballet, modeling, roller skating, and ice hockey. She eventually settled on roller skating and made the United States' Junior World Inline Championships Team at age 12. She won 15 gold medals at the junior level before moving up the senior level at age 16. By 2007, Smith had collected 16 senior World Championships gold medals. After 2007, Smith switched to short track speed skating on the ice in hopes of making the Olympics. She made the US World Cup team each year from 2008‚Äì10. She made the 2009 World Championships, but narrowly missed the 2010 Olympics. After the disappointment, Smith rededicated herself to the sport and made the 2011 and 2012 World Cup and World Championships teams. She won a bronze at the 2011 World Team Championships and a silver at the 2012 World Championships. When national coach Jae Su Chun was dismissed from the team in 2012, Smith stayed with him, forgoing support from the national team. Smith made the US World Cup and World Championships Teams in 2013. At the 2014 Olympic Trials, she won all three events. As of 2014, Smith holds the US National Record in the 500 meters and has won twelve World Cup medals. Early life Jessica Smith was born in Dearborn, Michigan to parents Rick and Reina Smith. She began roller skating at age one, competing in her first race at age two. In addition to skating, Smith took ballet and tap dancing lessons, and modeled. Staying scrape and injury free while skating proved to be too much of a burden, so she dropped ballet, dance, and modeling. She began to play ice hockey while continuing to roller skate. After inline skating and playing hockey competitively for several years, she decided to concentrate on inline to see how far she could take it, citing a preference for individual sports over team sports. Smith grew up in Melvindale, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. She graduated from Cabrini High School in Allen Park, Michigan. Skating career Smith competing at the 2014 Winter OlympicsSmith was coached by her father until age nine when family friend, Rob Dunn, took over. She would remain with Dunn until she gave up inline in 2007. At age twelve, Smith became the youngest inline skater to make a Junior World Team. Over the next three years, she collected 15 gold medals at the junior level. At sixteen, she made the Senior World Team. She collected 16 senior gold medals over the next few years, wrapping up her inline career with a Pan American Gold Medal in 2007. At the 2007 Inline World Championships, she suffered a shoulder injury that required surgery. After 2007, Smith transitioned to short track speed skating. It was a tough decision ‚Äì she was making a living as an inline skater and transitioning would require that she move away from her family in Metro Detroit for the first time. But, winning and making money was not enough for Smith so she make the switch. \\"I decided to pursue my final goal and dream of becoming an Olympian,\\" she explained. \\"The only way to do it was to make the switch\\". She moved to Salt Lake City and joined Derek Parra's Wheels on Ice Program. According to Smith, the transition from an elite athlete in inline to a beginner in short track was difficult and \\"humbling\\". Smith briefly moved to Milwaukee to try long track speed skating, but did not like it. \\"If you put me next to someone, I can outrace [them],\\" she explained. \\"But if you put me on the line by myself, I just can‚Äôt pull it together.\\" She returned to Utah where national short track coach Jae Su Chun saw something in Smith that made him believe she could be elite. Under Chun's guidance, Smith improved quickly. She made the 2008, 2009, and 2010 World Cup Teams, and participated in the 2009 World Championships. At the 2009 World Team Championships, Smith helped the United States place third. However, Smith narrowly missed the 2010 Olympic team. \\"I was a little devastated,\\" she recalled. \\"[I had] always achieved [my goals] ... I was feeling good about making that team in 2010, but I fell short.\\" She was selected as an alternate, did not compete. A week after the Olympics, Smith had a World Cup meet. She came from behind in every round of the 1000 meters to make the finals. In the finals, she won bronze. Smith later called the meet the most memorable of her career, saying \\"I didn‚Äôt give up on myself ...[and] reminded myself that I am a champion.\\" Smith rededicated herself to the sport and made both the US World Cup and World Championships Teams in 2011 and 2012. She won a bronze at the 2011 World Team Championships and a silver in the 3000 meter relay at the 2012 World Championships. When Chun was accused of mental and physical abuse later in 2012 and forced out, Smith chose to leave the national program and stay with Chun, feeling it was too close to the Olympics to change coaches. \\"It wasn't a difficult decision,\\" Smith remarked. \\"I needed to have him behind me [because] he's the best technical coach I've ever seen.\\" The decision meant that she would receive no financial support from the United States, relying instead on her personal savings and any sponsorship money she could find. Smith again made the US World Cup and World Championships Teams in 2013. She opened the 2014 Olympic Trials by winning the overall point standings in the 1500 meters. She credited Chun for the win, which secured her a spot in the Olympics. Smith went on to win the 500 meter and 1000 meter events, completing a Trials sweep. Just prior to the start of the Olympics, she revealed that she had a torn quadriceps muscle, but said it was not bothering her. As of 2014, Smith holds the US National Record in the 500 meters. She has twelve World Cup medals to date ‚Äì two gold, five silver, and five bronze. Personal life Smith's father, Rick, works as a truck driver. Her mother, Reina, is a part-time barber. She has a brother, Travis, who is 14 years her junior. Smith's family is not wealthy, but was able to join her in Sochi, Russia, site of the 2014 Olympics, with the help of community fundraisers. Smith is married to Michael Kooreman, a former speed skater and current speed skating coach. Kooreman is also responsible for preparing Smith's skating blades for competition. No date has been set for the wedding. When she is not skating, Smith enjoys shopping, watching movies, and playing golf. She lists speed skater Jennifer Rodriguez as her hero, and her parents as the most influential people in her life. Smith is pursuing a degree in business management from Ashworth College as of 2014. When she retires from speed skating, she plans to work in real estate. She has a mortgage license in Wisconsin. Smith has also spent time volunteering with Play Well Play Safe.

She was especially known for her linocuts, which are included in the collections of major Australian and British Art Galleries. She was also a founder of the Contemporary Art Society, promoting modern art in Australia.  Early life  Ethel Louise Spowers was born on 11 July 1890, in South Yarra, Melbourne, daughter of a New Zealand father and a London-born mother. Her father, William Spowers, owned a newspaper. Spowers trained as an artist in Melbourne, with some study in Paris as well (most notably with Andr√© Lhote).Stephen Coppel, \\"Ethel Louise Spowers,\\" Australian Dictionary of Biography 16(2002). She was educated at Girls Grammar in Melbourne. Wealthy and cultured, her family owned a mansion in St Georges Road, Toorak. Ethel continued to live there as an adult and maintained a studio above the stables. \\\\----  Career  Spowers had her first solo exhibit in Melbourne at age 30, showing fairy-tale illustrations as those of Ethel Jackson Morris. Two further solo shows (1925 and 1927) at the New Gallery, Melbourne, confirmed her reputation as an illustrator of fairy tales, though by then she was also producing woodcuts and linocuts inspired by Japanese art and covering a broader range of subjects. \\\\----Her style and artistic focus changed in 1928‚Äì29 when she studied linocut printmaking with Claude Flight at the Grosvenor School of Modern Art in London. She was one of several Australian women artists at the Grosvenor School, including Dorrit Black and Eveline Winifred Syme.Stephen Coppel, \\"Claude Flight and his Australian Pupils,\\" Print Quarterly2(4)(December 1985): 263-283. Further classes followed in 1931, during which Spowers absorbed modernist ideas of rhythmic design and composition from the principal of Grosvenor School Iain Macnab. In the 1930s her linocuts attracted critical attention for their bold, simplified forms, rhythmic sense of movement, distinctive use of colour and humorous observation of everyday life, particularly the world of children. They were regularly shown at The Redfern Gallery, London. \\\\----Spowers mounted an exhibition of Australian linocuts in Melbourne in 1930. In 1932, she became a founder of the Contemporary Art Society, promoting modern art in Australia.Helen Topliss, Modernism and Feminism: Australian Women Artists, 1900-1940 (Sydney: Craftsman House 1996).

The centrally sponsored scheme aims at providing strategic funding to higher educational institutions throughout the country. Funding is provided by the central ministry through the state governments and union territories (UT), which in coordination with the central Project Appraisal Board will monitor the academic, administrative and financial advancements taken under the scheme. A total of 316 state public universities and 13,024 colleges will be covered under it. Background Innovative educational policies in India have been a huge success. Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) launched in 2001 for elementary education and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) launched in 2009 for secondary education produced great results in the educational developments. For higher education University Grants Commission (UGC) has a provision for routine innovation and development fundings. UGC funds are quite adequate for centrally funded universities and colleges, which are recognised under sections 12B and 2(f) of UGC Act. However, as of 31 March 2012 statistics, the higher education sector in India consisted of 574 universities and 35,539 colleges, out of which 214 universities are not covered under 12B of UGC Act, and only 6,787 colleges are registered under 12B and 2(f). Thus a larger number of higher institutes run by state governments, which are limited in their own management, are not provided with sufficient financial support to enhance their facilities for educational reforms. Therefore, a separate scheme for state/UT-managed universities and colleges was proposed by the National Development Council (NDC) as part of the 12th Five-Year Plan in 2012. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs approved it in October 2013. Objectives RUSA aims to provide equal development to all higher institutions and rectify weaknesses in the higher education system. Its target achievement is to raise the gross enrolment ratio to 32% by the end of XII Plan in 2017. The major objectives are to: #improve the overall quality of existing state institutions by ensuring that all institutions conform to prescribed norms and standards and adopt accreditation as a mandatory quality assurance framework. #usher transformative reforms in the state higher education system by creating a facilitating institutional structure for planning and monitoring at the state level, promoting autonomy in state universities and improving governance in institutions. #ensure academic and examination reforms in the higher educational institutions. #enable conversion of some of the universities into research universities at par with the best in the world. #create opportunities for states to undertake reforms in the affiliation system in order to ensure that the reforms and resource requirements of affiliated colleges are adequately met. #ensure adequate availability of quality faculty in all higher educational institutions and ensure capacity building at all levels of employment. #create an enabling atmosphere in the higher educational institutions to devote themselves to research and innovations. #expand the institutional base by creating additional capacity in existing institutions and establishing new institutions, in order to achieve enrolment targets. #correct regional imbalances in access to higher education by facilitating access to high quality institutions in urban and semi-urban areas, creating opportunities for students from rural areas to get access to better quality institutions and setting up institutions in un-served and underserved areas. #improve equity in higher education by providing adequate opportunities of higher education to SC/STs and socially and educationally backward classes; promote inclusion of women, minorities, and differently abled persons. Funding process RUSA is provided by the central Ministry of Human Resource Development directly to the state and UT governments. From the state/UT budget the funds are disbursed to individual institutions. The funding to states would be made on the basis of critical appraisal of state plans for higher education plans. The amount of funding from central government will be 60% of the total grants, and 40% will be contributed by the state/UT as matching share. For northeastern states, Sikkim, Jammu and Kashmir, and Uttarakhand the matching share is waived to 10%. During the 12th Five-Year Plan period between 2012‚Äì2017, RUSA is allotted a financial outlay of INR 228.55 billion, of which INR 162.27 billion will be contributed by the central government. During the first phase, 80 new universities would be created by converting autonomous colleges/colleges in a cluster to state universities. 100 new colleges would be set up and 54 existing colleges would be converted into model degree colleges. Infrastructure grants would be given to 150 universities and 3,500 colleges to upgrade and fill critical gaps in infrastructure especially libraries, laboratories, etc. Further additional 5,000 faculty positions would be supported. Then the scheme will extend into the 13th Five-Year Plan.

Up to forty pink flowers with darker blotches are borne in summer and winter on flowering spikes up to long.  Description  Dipodium pulchellum is a tuberous, perennial, mycoheterotrophic herb and for most of the year, plants are dormant and have no above-ground presence. Between five and forty pink flowers with heavy darker blotches are arranged on a flowering spike long with narrow egg- shaped leaves long at the base. The sepals are long and wide. The sepals and petals are flat and almost straight, unlike those of D. punctatum which are cupped and often slightly curved backwards. The labellum is long and dark- reddish pink with mauve hairs.  Taxonomy  Dipodium pulchellum was formally described in 1987 by Australian botanists David Jones and Mark Clements from a specimen collected in the Tallebudgera Range in Queensland. The description was published in Proceedings of the Royal Society of Queensland. The specific epithet (pulchellum) is the diminutive form of the Latin word pulcher meaning \\"pretty\\", hence \\"pretty little\\". Distribution and habitat This orchid occurs in south-east Queensland and north-east New South Wales near Wardell, Grevillia and Tia Falls. Ecology Pollination of this species, as for all species in the genus, is by native bees and wasps.  Cultivation  No leafless species of Dipodium has been sustained in cultivation due to the inability to replicate its association with mycorrhizal fungi in a horticultural context.

The squadron was also responsible for combat air patrol and Anti- submarine warfare (ASW) missions. It was based at NAS North Island in San Diego, California, but had detachments serving aboard 13 attack carriers and antisubmarine carriers in the Pacific Fleet. Squadron History AD-5W VAW-11 approaching In 1948, the squadron was established as VAW-1, then redesignated Fleet Composite Squadron 11 (VC-11) one month later. The squadron was first equipped with the Grumman TBM-3W Avenger. VC-11 worked on developing the airborne early warning (AEW) concept, and in 1950 deployed detachments that provided ASW and AEW protection throughout the Korean War, flying the Douglas AD-3W/4W Skyraider. These were later replaced by the AD-5W model of the Skyraider. In 1958, the squadron received the AD-5Q variant of the Skyraider and Grumman TF-1Q Trader aircraft, which jointly added electronic warfare to its capabilities. Both aircraft were later employed by VAW-13, which was trained by VAW-11 and commissioned in 1961. In 1959 the squadron received Grumman WF-2 Tracer, commonly known as \\"Willy Fudds\\" or \\"Stoof with a Roof\\" (as it was developed from the Grumman S2F \\"Stoof\\"). In July 1960, it deployed its first Grumman Tracer detachment to the Western Pacific. E-1B of VAW-11 prepares to launch from in 1962 In 1962, the AD-5W was redesignated EA-1E and the WF-2 became the E-1B. In early 1964, the squadron began receiving Grumman E-2A Hawkeye. This aircraft required very extensive ground support, particularly for its complex avionics system, causing the squadron to grow significantly in maintenance inventory and headcount. By 1966, VAW-11 had become the U.S. Navy's largest carrier-based squadron, providing E-2A detachments to large attack carriers and E-1B detachments to smaller Essex- class aircraft carriers. To increase efficiency and combat readiness, on 20 April 1967, the squadron was redesignated as Carrier Airborne Early Warning Wing 11 while the various detachments were established as separate individual VAW squadrons designated VAW-111, VAW-112, VAW-113, VAW-114, VAW-115 and VAW-116.Naval Aviation News May 1967 pg 3 See also *History of the United States Navy *List of inactive United States Navy aircraft squadrons References Category:Early warning squadrons of the United States Navy ","title":"VAW-11"},{"id":"41815527","title":"Emily Dole"},{"id":"41815531","text":"\\"The Me Decade and the Third Great Awakening\\" is an essay by American author Tom Wolfe, in which Wolfe coined the phrase Me' Decade\\", a term that became common as a descriptor for the decade of the 1970s. The essay was first published as the cover story in the August 23, 1976 issue of New York magazine and later appeared in his collection Mauve Gloves & Madmen, Clutter & Vine. In one of the essay's most famous passages, exemplifying his style of description, Wolfe called Jimmy Carter a \\"Missionary lectern-pounding Amen ten-finger C-major-chord Sister-Martha-at-the-Yamaha-keyboard loblolly piney- woods Baptist.\\" Origin of the term Me' Decade\\" The term \\"'Me' Decade\\" describes a general new attitude of Americans in the 1970s, in the direction of atomized individualism and away from communitarianism, in clear contrast with social values prevalent in the United States during the 1960s. Wolfe asserts the disappearance of the socioeconomic class he calls the \\"proletariat\\", in parallel with the concurrent appearance of an American \\"lower middle class\\". He cites the economic boom of postwar America as affording the average American a new sense of self-determination and individuation associated with the widespread economic prosperity. Wolfe describes the resulting abandoning of communal, progressive, and New Deal- style politics as \\"taking the money and running\\". He traces the preoccupation with self and self-development back to the aristocratic European gentry. Wolfe states that the \\"chivalric tradition\\" and the philosophy behind \\"the finishing school\\" are inherently dedicated to the building and forming of personal character and conduct. Wolfe believes that the counterculture of the 1960s and the New Left school of thought promoted a recovery of the self in a flawed and corrupt America, a philosophy extended in the 1970s with a spreading idea that use of the drug LSD, commonly known as \\"acid\\", would unveil a true and real self. He describes the revelatory experience of hallucinogens as similar to, even competitive with, religious ecstasy, transforming the religious climate in America. Wolfe chronicles the American periods of Christian revival known as the First and Second Great Awakenings, to which he analogizes the 1970s and their dominant social trends. He argues that the \\"Me\\" Decade of the 1970s is a \\"Third Great Awakening\\".

He held the seat until 5 May 1888 (the 1888 colonial election). The Electoral Districts Act of 1887 abolished the seat of Mulgrave, but effectively replaced it with the seat of electoral district of Bundaberg. Adams successfully contested Bundaberg in the 1888 state election and held that seat until his death on 15 May 1892. Labour candidate George Hall won the resulting by- election on 16 June 1892.

He underwent a 2-hour operation on Thursday 12 May at Prince Alfred Hospital which was expected to be successful. However, he died in the hospital on Sunday 15 May 1892. His body was brought to Bundaberg by train and buried in the Bundaberg Catholic cemetery on the afternoon of 21 May. Despite torrential rain, the funeral procession to the cemetery comprised hundreds of people and was nearly a mile long; all businesses were closed for the afternoon.

It was launched in March 2009. The implementation of the scheme has started from 2009-2010 to provide conditions for an efficient growth, development and equity for all. The scheme includes a multidimensional research, technical consulting, various implementations and funding support. The principal objectives are to enhance quality of secondary education and increase the total enrollment rate from 52% (as of 2005‚Äì2006) to 75% in five years, i.e. from 2009‚Äì2014. It aims to provide universal education for all children between 15‚Äì16 years of age. The funding from the central ministry is provided through state governments, which establish separate implementing agencies. The total budget allocated during the XI Five Year Plan (2002-2007) was . Objectives The objectives of Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan can be summarised as follows: #To improve quality of education imparted at secondary level through making all secondary schools conform to prescribed norms. #To remove gender, socio-economic and disability barriers. #Universal access to secondary level education by 2017, i.e., by the end of the XII Five Year Plan. #Universal retention of students by 2020.  Planning for secondary education = Background  * Since the initiation of the National Policy on Education (NPE), 1986, there have been no major changes in the structure and organization of the secondary and higher secondary school systems under the Ninth Plan period. * The focus in this plan was on minimising the various disparities, to renew the curricula giving importance to vocationalisation and employment-oriented courses. It also gives importance to expanding and diversifying the open learning system, teacher training and ICT. Free education and hostel facilities for girls and integrated education for the disabled children was also brought into highlight, etc.  Participation of private sector  * There was an increased participation of the private sector including non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Currently, these private sectors manage around 51% of the secondary schools and 58% of the higher secondary schools. * Opportunities were provided for those children who were not able to enroll themselves in formal education systems through national and state open schools by utilising contact-centres and multi-media packages. * It highly emphasized on the content, process and the quality of education especially the environment education, science, mathematics and computer literacy with the financial help from the central government. * After the revised NPE policy, 1992, new initiatives like revision of curriculum, resource centres for value education and National Centre for Computer-aided Education etc. have been taken up. * The appeal lacks in the vocationalisation of education due to the lack of manpower demand and academic restraints etc. Hence, by 2000, only 10% of the students opt for the vocational streams against 25%.  Planning for children with special needs (CWSN)  * With the enactment of the Persons with Disabilities Act, 1995, the education for the CWSN received an impetus. This act entrusts certain governments and authorities for the provision of free access for these children towards education, allotted lands for certain purposes, non-discrimination in transports, financial incentive for them to undertake research etc. * This scheme has also taken up programmes for the attitudinal changes and capacity building among teachers for the sake of these children.  Four major heads  * Quality improvement: In school, there was promotion of the science laboratories, environmental education, promotion of yoga, as well as centrally sponsored schemes of population education project, international mathematics and science olympiads. The state governments provide in-service training for the teachers and provide infrastructure and research inputs. * Information communication technologies (ICT): ICT comprises the centrally sponsored schemes like computer education and literacy in schools (CLASS) and educational technology (ET) which familiarizes the student with Information technology (IT). Due to the rise in IT demand in today's world, a major importance is given on it. Components of a merged scheme ICT in school include a) funding support towards computer education plans; b) strengthening and reorientation of the staffs of SIETS - state institutes of education and training; c) there is digitalisation of SIETs audio and video cassettes with the partnership of NGOs; and d) management of internet-based education by SIETs. * Access and equity: RMSA not only emphasizes on providing secondary education for the special focus groups that include scheduled tribe and scheduled caste groups, minority girls and CWSN children, but it also give importance on removing the existing disparities in socio-economic and gender background in the secondary level of education. They are termed as the vulnerable/ disadvantaged group. Certain strategies were implemented to provide free access towards secondary education and they are given as following steps: # Identification of the disadvantaged groups: For this purpose, educational indicators like gross enrollment ratio (GER), net enrollment ratio (NER), drop-out rate, retention rate, gender parity index (GPI), gender gap, etc. were analysed. # Need assessment: This is the critical step to prepare for the equity plan where the factors affecting the education of this group of children were evaluated with the involvement of the community members, teachers, civil society, etc. # Strategising for the addressing gaps: Since there are multiple interwoven factors that cause the un-equitable condition in this scenario, the strategy was called to have a set of multi- dimensional activities. # Project-based proposal: Development of a project- based strategy enables the RMSA to call for an evidence-based and outcome- oriented strategy. * Integrated education for disabled children (IEDC): Inclusive education have been highlighted to bring about expansion in terms of meeting/catering to the needs of the mentally and physically disadvantaged children. This schemes continues to be a separate centrally sponsored scheme. It includes several components for convergence with integrated child development services for early interventions, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) for the particular group at the elementary level, and special schools. Funding method The Ministry of Human Resource Development directly provides funds to the state governments. Each state government then release the funds to the approved implementing agencies or institutions. During the XI Five Year Plan the central government provided 75% of the total fund for each state, while 25% was borne by the state as matching share. However, in the remote northeastern states and Sikkim the matching share was waived to 10%. Achievements Achievements of RMSA listed in its 2015-2016 reportrmsaindia.org include: * 11,577 new secondary schools approved; 10,082 functional * 52,750 additional classrooms approved; 20,839 completed; 16,774 in progress * 25,948 science laboratories approved; 10,107 completed, 8,532 in progress * 21,864 computer rooms approved; 6,920 completed, 6,297 in progress * 27,428 libraries approved; 10,133 completed, 8,929 in progress * 31,453 art and craft rooms approved; 12,062 completed, 9,686 in progress * 12,327 drinking water facilities approved; 7,096 completed, 2,507 in progress * 5,408 teachers' quarters approved; 623 completed, 509 in progress * 2,975 major repairs approved; 1,313 completed, 271 in progress  Progress  There is a rise in demand for secondary education, but, despite an increase in the number of schools, their geographic distribution is uneven. The gender gap has narrowed. In the Tenth Plan the focus is on quality education at all levels.  Disintegration  In 2018, Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan along with Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and Centrally Sponsored Scheme on Teacher Education (CSSTE) was disintegrated to form Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan.

Jones was regarded as one of the best fighters in the sport and was ranked at number two on The Ring pound-for-pound list (Pernell Whitaker was number one). As a result, Pazienza was installed as a massive underdog with Jones being listed as a 12‚Äì1 favorite, though one Las Vegas oddsmaker listed the odds at 100‚Äì1 in Jones' favor.

In the fourth round, Jones would become the first fighter in the history of compubox to go an entire round without being hit by an opponent as Pazienza was unable to connect with any of the five punches he threw in that round. Jones would also bust Pazienza's nose open in that round as well. With less than a minute to go in round six, Jones would score a knockdown over Pazienza after a left hook followed by a combination sent Pazienza to the canvas. Though Pazienza was clearly shaken from the exchange, he was allowed to continue, but Jones quickly put him down again with a right hand with 25 seconds left in the round. The referee again let Pazienza continue, prompting Jones to almost immediately land a six-punch combination that sent Pazienza crashing to the canvas for the third time in the round.

London, CV Mosby, 2002. is a method used to isolate the paretic extraocular muscle, particularly superior oblique muscle and trochlear nerve (IVth cranial nerve), in acquired vertical double vision. It was originally described by Marshall M. Parks. Bielschowsky's head tilt test *Step 1: Determine which eye is hypertropic in primary position. If there is right hypertropia in primary position, then the depressors of the R eye (IR/SO) or the elevators of the L eye are weak (SR/IO). *Step 2: Determine whether the hypertropia increases on right or left gaze. The vertical rectus muscles have their greatest vertical action when the eye is abducted. The oblique muscles have their greatest vertical action when the eye is adducted. *Step 3: Determine whether the hypertropia increases on right or left head tilt. During right head tilt, the right eye intorts (SO/SR) and the left eye extorts (IO/IR). When a healthy individual tilts their head, the superior oblique and superior rectus muscles of the eye closest to the shoulder keep the eye level. The inferior oblique and inferior rectus muscles keep the other eye level. In patients with superior oblique palsy, the superior rectus muscle‚Äôs action is not counteracted by the superior oblique muscles. This leads to vertical deviation of the affected eye when the head is tilted towards the affected eye. However, there is no deviation when the head is tilted towards the unaffected eye because the superior oblique muscle is not stimulated in the affected eye, but rather it is stimulated in the unaffected eye.\\"Head Tilt Test.\\" Head Tilt Test. Orbis Telemedicine, 2003. Web. 08 Dec. 2011. . When there is a discrepancy in ocular deviation based on which way the head is tilted, the patient is diagnosed with unilateral palsy of the superior oblique muscle due to damage in the Trochlear Nerve. People with superior oblique palsy on one side experience double vision, which is improved or even abolished by tilting the head towards the shoulder on the unaffected side. Tilting the head towards the shoulder on the affected side will make the double vision worse by causing increased separation of the two images seen by the patient. History The physiologic basis of the head tilt test was explained by Alfred Bielschowsky and Hofmann1 citing Spielmann A: A translucent occluder for study of eye position under unilateral or bilateral cover test. Am Orthopt J 36:65, 1986. in 1935.Trochlear Nerve Palsy on eMedicine However, Nagel described it 30 years prior to Bielschowsky when he noted that the combined action of the superior rectus muscle and the superior oblique muscle of one eye and of the inferior rectus and inferior oblique muscles in the fellow eye causes incycloduction and excycloduction.1 citing The procedure that we now follow was given by Marshall M.

She is best known for her work in large-scale murals, New England landscapes, and later for her commissioned work of women workers in WWII shipyard and aircraft industries as published in Life magazine in 1944. Personal life and education Born in Detroit, Michigan, Edna Reindel began her formal artistic studies in 1918 at the Detroit School of Design. The next year, she moved to New York where she attended Brooklyn's Pratt Institute until her graduation in 1923. In the following years, she worked as a freelance illustrator and painter. She won a Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Fellowship in 1926 and 1932, and continued to live and work in New York until she moved to California in the 1938. Edna Reindel died in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan in 1990 at age 96. Artistic career After emerging from the Pratt Institute, Edna Reindel illustrated children's books and book jackets (1926). Between 1933 and 1937, she created at least five different still-life covers for Conde Nast's House and Garden magazine. Most of these were very sensual depictions of flowers (probably influenced by Georgia O'Keeffe) in a style somewhere between surrealistic and hyper-realistic. During the Great Depression, the Treasury Section of Painting and Sculpture (later Section of Fine Arts) and the WPA commissioned Reindel to create paintings, murals and sculptures around the country. During 1933 and 1934 Reindel was commissioned by the WPA to execute \\"easel paintings\\" for federal buildings. At least two of these paintings are apparently still on display, one in the Pentagon, and another at the Department of Labor building in Washington, D.C. A mural commissioned by the Treasury in 1935 was in a Stamford, Connecticut public housing project called Fairfield Court, and took up four walls of a small reception room. Reindel's 1939 Treasury mural depicting Eli Whitney‚ÄîExperimenting with the First Model of the Cotton Gin‚Äîcan still be viewed at the Emmanuel County Courthouse in Swainsboro, Georgia. The mural depicts Whitney's 1791 experiments and demonstration of the cotton gin in Swainsboro, Georgia. Reindel had work featured in exhibits in California between 1938 and 1953; during this time, she also painted portraits of stars of motion pictures. In 1939, her work Contemplation was purchased by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Also during this stretch, her work was exhibited in galleries that included the Stendahl Galleries, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Vigeveno Galleries. In 1944, Life magazine published pieces from a series they commissioned from Reindel in 1943, entitled Women at War. These images were meant to display the experiences of working women supporting the Allied war effort. Previously in 1937, Life magazine had included a featured piece on Reindel's Martha's Vineyard pieces including The Netmenders. In the 1943 series, with pieces like Calship Worker, Wilmington, California (1943), Reindel uniquely captured women workers in war time ‚Äì from the lens of a working woman artist. LIFE published nine paintings developed from observations of women workers at and sketches of the Lockheed Air Craft Factory in Los Angeles. Reindel's work capturing Rosie the Riveter (1943) types helped to popularize the song \\"Rosie the Riveter.\\" Four of these pieces are in the National Museum of Women in the Arts permanent collection. In 1948 and 1949, Reindel achieved notoriety with works that focused on the fear and horror of the atom bomb. These works were part of a series known as \\"The Effects of War on People,\\" and include Hiroshima (1949), The Praying Mothers (1949), Angels Wept at Los Alamos (1949), Beast on Bikini (1949), Radioactive Mother and Child (1949), and Brother and Sister (1949). Throughout her career, Reindel also illustrated, sketched, created collages, and developed restoration skills. Indeed, she applied her restoration skills in work for the heiress, art collector and philanthropist Doris Duke during the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1950s and 1960s, she worked in metal sculpture. During this time she also created teaching materials and wrote books about painting. Furthermore, Reindel painted portraits of famous actors such as Spencer Tracy, Ronald Colman, Gregory Peck as well as some of their family members. Spencer Tracy, Greer Garson, Vincent Price, Ray Milland and Hedda Hopper were among the Hollywood personalities who collected her art. Reception and genre Reindel's work was received in different ways across her career. With illustrations and landscape paintings, a portion of Reindel's work was identified with American Regionalism. Her early works of still life and landscape scenes were also noted for their surreal tendencies. Others described her work up until 1939 as Formalist Realism. Reindel described her work, in turns, as \\"psycho-realist\\" and noted in 1937 that her \\"landscapes and still lifes are straight realism with a modern trend.\\" Works *ca. 1931‚Äì1933 ‚Äì Tulips (oil, painting) *1934 ‚Äì Port of Edgartown *1935 ‚Äì Rhododendron *1937 ‚Äì Contemplation (oil on canvas, painting) *1939 ‚Äì Experimenting with the First Model of the Cotton Gin (mural) *1943 ‚Äì Calship Worker, Wilmington, California (painting) *1943 ‚Äì Rosie the Riveter (painting) Awards *1926 ‚Äì Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Fellowship Award *1932 ‚Äì Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Fellowship Award *1935 ‚Äì Art Director's Club, Fellowship Award (New York, NY, USA) *1939 ‚Äì Medal, Beverly Hills Art Festival (City of Beverly Hills, Beverly Hills, CA, USA) Notable exhibitions *1931 ‚Äì Weyhe Galleries (NY) (first exhibition) *1934 ‚Äì Macbeth Gallery (first solo show) *1930, 1937 ‚Äì Cororan Gallery biennials *1934‚Äì35, 1945, 1948 ‚Äì Art Institute of Chicago *1935‚Äì38, 1941 Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Art Annual *1937, 1940, 1947 ‚Äì Macbeth Gallery *1937‚Äì38, 1940, 1949 ‚Äì WMAA *1937‚Äì38, 1944‚Äì46, 1947‚Äì49 ‚Äì Carnegie Institute Notable collections and retrospectives *Preserving the Past, Securing the Future: Donations of Art, 1987‚Äì1997 *1991 ‚Äì Edna Reindel American Magic Realist (1894‚Äì1990), Robert Henry Adams Fine Art, Chicago, IL, USA ReferencesExternal links * Five exhibition catalogs of Reindel, available from the Metropolitan Museum of Art Libraries. * Edna Reindel Papers at the National Museum of Women in the Arts Category:1894 births Category:1990 deaths Category:American surrealist artists Category:Artists from Detroit Category:Pratt Institute alumni Category:Painters from Michigan Category:20th-century American painters Category:20th-century sculptors Category:American muralists Category:People of the New Deal arts projects Category:20th-century American women artists Category:Women muralists Category:Women surrealist artists Category:Surrealist artists ","title":"Edna Reindel"},{"id":"41816008","text":"The Haida Heritage Centre is the premier cultural centre and museum of the Haida people.

They were the first overreaching framework for effective public relations and communications measurement. The Principles serve as a guide for practitioners to incorporate the ever-expanding media landscape into a transparent, reliable, and consistent framework. The Barcelona Principles were agreed upon by PR practitioners from 33 countries who met in Barcelona, Spain in 2010 for a summit convened by the International Association for Measurement and Evaluation of Communication (AMEC). The Barcelona Principles identify the need for outcome-, instead of output-, based measurement of PR campaigns, call for the exclusion of ad value equivalency metrics, and recognize the communications value of social media.  Original 2010 Principles  The original Barcelona Principles were listed as follows: # Importance of goal setting and measurement # Measuring the effect on outcomes is preferred to measuring outputs # The effect on business results can and should be measured where possible # Media measurements requires quantity and quality # AVEs are not the value of Public Relations # Social Media can and should be measured # Transparency and replicability are paramount to sound measurement  Barcelona Principles 2.0 (2015)  These principles were updated in 2015: # Goal setting and measurement are fundamental to communication and public relations: A holistic approach that includes traditional and social media; keeping aware of changes in variables. Making goals qualitative and quantitative as well as integrating SMART criteriaevaluation across all channels # Measuring communication outcomes is recommended versus only measuring outputs: Applying standards best practices in target audience research # The effect on organizational performance can and should be measured where possible: Demand for models to evaluate the impact on target audiences and survey research (ex. Profitability, customer quality, revenue, market share, and customer retention) # Measurement and evaluation require both qualitative and quantitative methods: Measuring impressions among stakeholders, target audience, and the quality of media coverage. Measuring positive, negative, and neutral progress not only success # AVEs are not the value of communication. ¬¨ Instead use negotiated advertising rates relevant to the client, quality of coverage, and physical space or time of the coverage related to the portion of the coverage that is relevant # Social media can and should be measured consistently with other media channels. ¬¨ Focus measurement on engagement, ‚Äúconversation‚Äù and ‚Äúcommunities‚Äù, not just ‚Äúcoverage‚Äù or vanity metrics # Measurement and evaluation should be transparent, consistent and valid. ¬¨ Ensure integrity, honesty, openness, and ethical practices. Recognize and potential biasing effects in the research itself, or broader societal context  Barcelona Principles 2.0  In 2015 industry leaders and the original developers gathered together to modify the original principles in order to make them more reflective of the current communication industry, as the original Barcelona Principles were \\"never intended to be a final or complete solution.‚Äù The goal of the working group was to ensure that the Barcelona Principles could continue to act as a baseline for professionals. The original Barcelona Principles were predominantly focused on ‚Äúwhat not to do‚Äù and were created with the public relations industry in mind. Its quantitative methods outweighed qualitative methods and due to a constantly changing industry, standards needed to continuously evolve in order to accurately measure effectiveness. The modified principles were based on results accumulated from a wide array of communication agencies, organizations, and practitioners over the past five years of applied standards. Modifications included learnings that can be applied with a focus on, ‚Äúwhat to do‚Äù instead of, ‚Äúwhat not to do‚Äù. The Barcelona Principles 2.0 integrated all communication field measurement that now reflect the importance of evaluation, insight, and qualitative methods.  Barcelona Principles 3.0 (2020)  These principles were updated again in 2020: # Setting goals is an absolute prerequisite to communications planning, measurement, and evaluation # Measurement and evaluation should identify outputs, outcomes, and potential impact # Outcomes and impact should be identified for stakeholders, society, and the organization # Communication measurement and evaluation should include both qualitative and quantitative analysis # AVEs are not the value of communication # Holistic communication measurement and evaluation includes all relevant online and offline channels # Communication measurement and evaluation are rooted in integrity and transparency to drive learning and insights  Barcelona Principles 3.0  As public relations and communication practices have evolved, so too has the approach to measuring and evaluating the sector's performance. In 2020, the International Association for Measurement and Evaluation of Communication (AMEC) organised a committee of industry experts to review, update and evolve the Barcelona Principles. The committee, led by Dr David Rockland, sought to adapt the principles to \\"sharpen the communications industry‚Äôs focus on inclusion, impact, and integrity.\\" Barcelona Principles 3.0, which were launch at AMEC's 2020 Virtual Summit, acknowledges that common practices in 2010 ‚Äì even 2015 ‚Äì may now be outdated. Furthermore, the updated Principles have broadened its relevance to a wider and more diverse range of organizations and roles to reflect that measurement and evaluation best practice is equally essential in government communications, charities, NGOs, and other non-commercial entities. As such, the Principles now reflect a broader standard of measurement, focused heavily on measuring what matters to drive continuous improvement within an organization rather than solely attempting to prove the value of public relations and communications. And, with social and digital measurement now a table-stake in the sector, the Principles reflect a more holistic approach that standardizes measurement across all channels, with an eye toward allowing choice in where to invest in public relations and communications to drive optimal organizational performance.

The book was first published on September 3, 2013 by Atheneum Books and follows the ongoing adventures of Matteo \\"Matt\\" Alacran. Synopsis Raised as a clone of El Patr√≥n, the ruler of the land of Opium, the 14-year-old Matt is not entirely ready to fill the shoes of his predecessor. The daily struggles of the ruling are made even more difficult by the desperation of the people living in the lands surrounding his own; an ecological disaster has ravaged them almost to the point of no return. His enemies are many, but Matt finds himself equally afraid of his own potential to become every bit as bloodthirsty and ruthless as the tyrant from which he was cloned. Production Of the book, Farmer stated that she had never intended to create a sequel to The House of the Scorpion, as the writing process for the novel had depressed her. As a result, she began work on the Trolls Trilogy, but soon found that she wanted to revisit the world of the previous novel in order to resolve problems that remained at the end of Scorpion. Farmer began working on the novel in 2008 and the working title was God's Ashtray. Farmer wrote 80 pages of the book before having to stop due to an illness. When her health was better, Farmer tried to resume writing, but was exhausted after moving from California to Arizona. She was at last revived by listening to music and was able to finish the novel. Reception Critical reception of The Lord of Opium has been favorable, with starred reviews in Publishers' Weekly, which hailed it as a \\"superb novel ...well worth the wait,\\" and Booklist, which described it as \\"a brilliantly realized world,\\" and \\"a stellar sequel.\\" Kathleen Beck, in VOYA, judged the story \\"stronger and more cohesive, the moral questions more subtle than in House Of The Scorpion.\\" Even those reviewers who did not admire the book as much as its predecessor, found it an enjoyable read. Commonsensemedia gave The Lord of Opium four out of five stars, stating that the \\"Sci-fi sequel is gripping but can't top original.\\" Jonathan Hunt reviewed the novel for both the School Library Journal and the Horn Book magazine, and noted that the \\"landscape of dystopian literature has changed significantly since the first book, but this sequel is still a cut above the rest.\\" References Category:2013 American novels Category:Novels by Nancy Farmer Category:American young adult novels Category:American science fiction novels Category:Dystopian novels Category:Novels about cloning Category:Novels set in fictional countries ","title":"The Lord of Opium"},{"id":"41816054","text":"Federica Selva (born June 7, 1996 in Borgo Maggiore) is a Sammarinese alpine skier.

It is endemic to northern Australia and the common names derive from the fact that the wedge-shaped mound is aligned with its main axis running north and south. Description A large mound may house up to a million individual termites. Each is the nest of a colony of Amitermes meridionalis and houses the queen, king, reproductives, soldiers and workers. The outer surface of the mound is hard and durable whereas the material separating the chambers and galleries inside is more papery. The soldiers are long and their curved mandibles bear a single in-turned tooth. Many termites never leave the mound and as a result of this protected environment they have thin cuticles, colourless bodies, little sight and little ability to protect themselves. Distribution and habitat Amitermes meridionalis is native to the northern part of Northern Territory of Australia, around Darwin. The slab-like mounds are found in low-lying grassland areas that flood during the rainy season. The mounds are often widely scattered, but may be grouped together in a graveyard-like manner. Behaviour The mounds built by this termite can be up to tall, wide and deep. The nests are laterally flattened and are oriented so that they receive the warmth of the sun on their eastern and western sides in the morning and evening while exposing less surface to the sun at midday when the nest might overheat. The interior of the mound is kept at a relatively stable temperature and a high humidity. In the summer, when the land floods, the termites remain safely inside feeding on their stored food supplies. In the dry season, when the water drains away, the surrounding grass senesces and the termites gather the drying grass and other plant material to store as hay in chambers in the mound. Feeding as it does on grass and other vegetation, Amitermes meridionalis is of little economic importance.

Work Dani√´l de Blieck principally painted architectural studies but is also known for some portraits. He painted both real and imaginary church interiors. Interior of a church His imaginary architectural paintings of church interiors were in the style of the Flemish painter Hendrick Aerts, but under the influence of architectural painters of the Delft school such as Hendrick Cornelisz. van Vliet, he developed a more realistic style around 1650.Walter A. Liedtke, 'Architectural painting in Delft: Gerard Houckgeest, Hendrick van Vliet, Emanuel de Witte', Davaco, 1982, p. 24 His painting of the Rotterdam St. Lawrence Church of the early 1650s demonstrates this interest in realism.Walter A. Liedtke, 'Vermeer and the Delft School', Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1 Jan, 2001 However, he did not abandon the style of imaginary architecture paintings and it has been claimed that he never found his own style. Between 1655 and 1657 he kept a sketch book in which he drew 82 architectural drawings, and these are more realistic in style.Renate Trnek, 'Die holl√§ndischen Gem√§lde des 17.

He was an influential intellectual, a remarkable compelling writer and a creative thinker.Dulal, Govinda Prashad Satabdika Carcita Nepaliharu (Eminent Nepalese of the 20th Century), s.l. : Mawali Nepal, 2004. p. 133,  Early years  Born on May 21, 1930 to a businessman Chandra Das Shrestha and Dwarika Devi Shrestha in Calcutta (Kolkata), the then capital city of colonial British India, Shrestha did his early schooling in Calcutta. When the World War II broke out in 1939, the family moved back to Nepal. He then completed his higher education in Nepal with merit from Juddhodaya high School (JP), Kathmandu.Samaj Dainik (Daily) Newspaper, Vol 16, No.25, 1971 p.4  Freedom movement  While pursuing his intermediate level at Tri-chandra College, he was constantly inspired and motivated by the ongoing democratic movement taking place in the country against the autocratic Rana regime. This led Shrestha to participate in the freedom movement. He assisted the leading Nepali Rastriya (National) Congress (Nepali Congress Party) on several protest programs, awareness programs and mass meetings.Author's interview with family members of Shrestha substantiated this view When the then Rana regime banned Nepali Rastriya (National) Congress and declared illegal in April 1948, Shrestha along with the bunch of other senior coworkers namely Tripubar Singh Pradhan, Gopal Prasad Rimal and Bijaya Bahadur Malla formed a new party called ' Nepali Praja Panchyat ' on 12 October 1948. Grisma Bahadur Devkota, Nepal ko Rajanitik Darpan,p-112, It organized series of public meetings under the fundamental rights provisions of the constitution. But in spite of its legitimacy, the autocratic Rana regime suppressed its activities suspecting a more serious designs against them. Nepal Praja Panchyat then launched a Satyagraha movement in the three cities of Kathmandu Valley, demanding the implementation of the constitutional provisions relating to fundamental rights. Alarmed by this and its political connections with the earlier banned Rastriya Congress leaders, the Rana Government arrested hundreds of political suspects.Bhuwan Lal Joshi, Leo E. Rose, Democratic Innovations in Nepal: A Case Study of Political Acculturation , p-69.1966 University of California Press, Library of Congress Catalogue Card No:66-14092 At the age of just eighteen in late 1948, just few months after his marriage with Manorama Devi Shrestha, Shrestha was also arrested in the protest program at lalitpur, Patan and imprisoned. He was inhumanly beaten and tortured at times when he refused to co-operate with the ruthless authority. Later in early 1951, the regime was forced to release him and his other political coworkers nearly after two and half years in the wake of the deepening gravity of the peoples' movement in and across the border.Nepal Press Digest. Vol.5 No.5 1966, p.3 Soon after their release, in February 1951, one hundred and four years of autocratic regime was overthrown from the power. Democratic Nepal was finally established from a great sacrifice of the people and a long people's struggle. While he was still in prison, it is said that Shrestha was in the name list of twelve freedom fighters submitted by the prison authority to be exterminated for their active involvement in populist crusade.  Entry to journalism  An honest advocate of democracy and civil rights, Shrestha continued his service long after democracy as an active worker of Nepali Congress and Nepal Praja Party. Working alongside the party, Shrestha was strongly drawn to journalism when he was briefly associated with the first Nepali Daily newspaper 'AWAJ' in 1951 published by the eminent poet Yugkabi, late Siddhicharan Shrestha. But it was only in 1956, when he finally embarked into the real world of journalism leaving the politics behind for the rest of his life.Matribhumi Weekly Newsletter, Vol.8,1971, p.7  First in nepal  In July 1956, he launched The Commoner, Nepal's English pioneer daily heralding an era of English language journalism in Nepal amidst several impediments during the initial period of democracy. Shortly after two years of publication, in 1958, he was invited by the United States government, the Department of State to attend a study-work-travel program from a prestigious Medill School of Journalism, Northern Western University, Illinois. He was the first ever Nepali journalist to study, live and trained in the United States under US government funding. As a part of his training program, he worked with some newspapers, namely, New York Daily News, Baltimore Post and Washington Times. He further undertook another training program in United Kingdom working briefly with London Times  Active life in journalism  Apart from the regular publication of English daily newspaper The Commoner, he published and edited other Nepali Vernacular dailies and weeklies like Janata Daily, Nepal Times Daily (Hindi edition), and Yugdoot (weekly)as a sister publications at various times and later Prajatantra weekly and so on. Through these publications, he was able to inform and win the hearts and minds of the people. He also contributed thought provoking articles and editorials to other vernacular dailies and weeklies including Samaj (published and edited by Mani Raj Upadhyaya) and Samikshha (published and edited by Madan Mani Dixit) on regular basis.Grishma Bahadur Devkota, Nepal ko Chappakhana Ra Patra Patrikako Itihas (History of the printing press and papers of Nepal, Kathmandu 1967 He is believed to be the first journalist who is very immaculate and an eloquent writer who wrote in native (Nepali) and English language equally well. He is the journalist who strictly practiced ethics of journalism in Nepal and became a role model to modern journalism.Author's interview with some senior editors, substantiated this view Contemporary journalists, political leaders, ministers and other high-profile officials sought his ideas, visions and remarks whenever they need them whether in the time crisis or in political deadlocks.Yugeshwor Prashad Verma,The English Language press in Nepal, Ph.D Thesis, Tribhuvan University, 1973,P-18  Achievements and contributions  In his forty five years of illustrious and professional career, Shrestha held several media dignitary positions and played a key role in the gradual evolution of media from restrictive to the 'free press' of today. He was the founder member of Nepal's first Press Committee in 1957. He became the President of Nepal Journalists‚Äô Association twice in late 1959 and again in 1970, founder President of Nepal Press Institute, the first training center for the journalists in Nepal from 1984-1997, President of Press Club and later chairman of Press Council of Nepal in 1995. Serving as the head of different media bodies and a member of first press committee and Royal Press Commission, he made an important contribution to the formulation of press code of conduct in Nepal that strengthened the professional development of journalism in the country. He was always conscious of the fact that the Nepalese journalism needed a sustainable development program in order to attract and retain the people in the profession. When he was the chairman of Nepal Press Council in 1995, Media Development Fund was formed in his initiation which facilitated the small media operators, particularly operating outside the capital city with soft loans which in turn enabled them to sustain professionally. He is the person who first envisaged the need and development of the Media Village in the country for the institutionalized growth of media sector. Apart from that, he unveiled several plans and proposals to uplift the dwindling media sectors during his time but unfortunately, that could not be materialized due to various limitations and hindrances. Besides, his countless mind gripping editorials and articles were printed in various national and international print media. He has also translated and edited several books and articles that includes the translation of autobiographical book \\" The Confessions\\"(Devanagari:‡§ï‡§®‡•ç‡§´‡•á‡§∏‡§®‡•ç‡§∏ ) by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in Nepali Language published by Nepal Academy in 1973.  Honours  As a token of appreciation for his contribution to Nepalese society, the then late King Birendra nominated him as a distinguished member of Tribhuvan University Academic Council twice(the only one university at that time). In 1997, he was nominated as member of Raj Parishad (upper house during kingship). He was also decorated with Gorkha Dakshin Bahu (II and IV class) and Subikhayat Trishakti Patta II medal, the highest honors presented and honoured by the King for the distinguished contribution to the country in the field of arts, literature, sports, science, and Social service. In 1999, the Press Council of Nepal created a journalism award in honor of Shrestha, the \\"Gopal Das Journalism Award\\" for his contribution to the development of journalism in Nepal since 1951. This award is presented annually to an exceptional journalist who have contributed and practiced good ethics of journalism in the country. It carries a purse of Rs.100000 and a letter of appreciation. In September 23, 2003, Nepal's Postal Services Department issued a commemorative postage stamp bearing a picture of Shrestha. The then Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa affixed the first day cancellation mark on his stamp. This was for the first time in Nepal that a postage stamp has been issued to commemorate a journalist honoring the fourth estate of the country. Shrestha died November 4, 1998 at the age of 68 while still serving as the president of Press Council of Nepal.

It originally aired on November 5, 2009. The episode was written by Barbie Kligman and Gabrielle Stanton and directed by Rick Bota. Plot The episode starts with Stefan (Paul Wesley) waking up at the living room and hearing noises in the house. He thinks that is Damon (Ian Somerhalder) but it is really his old friend Lexi (Arielle Kebbel) who came to celebrate his birthday. Stefan is happy to see her and he tells her about the recent happenings in Mystic Falls, including Elena (Nina Dobrev) but he does not mention that Elena looks exactly like Katherine. At the police station, Sheriff Forbes (Marguerite MacIntyre) interrogates everyone about Vicki's (Kayla Ewell) disappearance. Stefan and Elena match their stories that Stefan was just trying to help her with her drug issues, Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) only remembers the things Damon compelled him to remember and Matt (Zach Roerig) does not know anything other than what Jeremy told him. Matt and Jeremy believe she just left town and even Sheriff is not convinced, there is nothing more she can do. When the interrogations are over, Elena tells Stefan that they should stay away from each other. Sheriff Forbes works late when Damon arrives at her office to bring her a package (supposedly from uncle Zach) that contains vervain. The Sheriff believes that Zach is out of town, as Damon made them believe, and now he tries to make the members of the council trust him and offers his help. That way, he can learn more things about the council and what they know. Bonnie (Kat Graham) visits Elena at her bedroom who is down after her break up with Stefan. Bonnie tries to cheer her up by showing her a trick her grandmother taught her and she tells her that she is truly a witch. Bonnie is afraid that Elena will not believe her but Elena does. Damon runs into Caroline (Candice Accola) who is still mad at him after the way he treated her. He compels her to throw a party and he also asks her to get his crystal back from Bonnie. Caroline says that she will do it. At the Salvatore house, Stefan and Lexi talk about Elena when Damon shows up to invite them to Caroline's party later. Stefan is not in the mood of partying but Lexi convinces him that they should go. While Stefan gets into the shower, Elena knocks on the door and Lexi calls her in. Lexi is shocked seeing how much she looks like Katherine and Elena is surprised seeing Lexi in a towel and knowing Stefan is in the shower, believing that the two of them slept together and leaves. Lexi immediately runs back to the bedroom and ask Stefan what is wrong with him and why is he after a girl who looks like Katherine's twin sister. Stefan reassures her that Elena has nothing in common with Katherine and Lexi sees that Stefan is really in love with Elena. Stefan stops by Elena's house before he goes to the party to ask her what she wanted to talk to him about. He realizes what Elena thought seeing Lexi and he explains that she is only a friend ‚Äî his oldest friend ‚Äî and she is in town for his birthday. Elena is relieved but she still does not want to go to Caroline's party and declines Stefan's proposal. At the party, Caroline asks Bonnie for the crystal, but Bonnie does not give it back. Caroline tries to take it, but it shocks her the moment she touches it. The two of them argue and Bonnie leaves. When later Damon asks Caroline if she got his crystal back and she tells him no, he tells her that she is useless and shallow and leaves the bar. When he gets out he sees a young couple making out, he attacks them, kills the boy and compels the girl. Elena changes her mind and arrives at the party seeing Lexi and Stefan having fun while playing pool. Lexi gets to the bar to order some drinks when she sees Elena. She approaches her and the two of them have a nice talk about Stefan making Elena relax a little bit about Stefan being a vampire, to give him some time and he will soon be totally himself around her. When Lexi goes back to Stefan, Stefan thanks her for what she did. Sheriff Forbes finds the girl who survived Damon's attack and she asks her if she saw anything. The girl nods that she did and the Sheriff asks her to tell her everything. Back at the party, a very drunk Caroline sits down with Matt who offers to take her back home. On their way out, they run into the Sheriff who sees that her daughter is drunk. She thanks Matt for offering to take her home and she gets back to work. Elena finally decides to go and talk to Stefan while Lexi talks with Damon at the bar and asks him why he really is in town. Damon admits that he has a diabolical plan but he refuses to reveal it to her. While they are talking, Sheriff brings in the girl from the attack, who points to Lexi as her attacker. Sheriff walks up to Lexi and injects her with vervain. The cops drag Lexi out of the bar and Stefan, who saw everything, tries to get out to see what is happening. Lexi throws off the men holding her and as she walks towards the Sheriff, Sheriff shoots her several times with wooden bullets but Lexi is strong and can handle the pain. Just as she is about to reach the Sheriff, Damon shows up and stakes her in heart. Lexi dies while Stefan and Elena watch from afar in shock. Damon whispers to Lexi before she dies that he did it because it was part of his plan. Sheriff thanks Damon for his help and asks him to put Lexi's body in the police car. Damon is relieved that his plan to throw the town off of his and Stefan's scent has worked. Stefan is furious with Damon after killing Lexi and convinced that Damon will never change he tells Elena that he will go home and kill him. Elena tries to stop him because she knows that Stefan killing his brother will not do any good to him. She tells him that she will be there for him but he warns her to stay away. Back at home, Stefan finds Damon waiting for him and the two of them get into a fight. Stefan stakes Damon, but not in the heart, telling him that now they are even; he saved his life once and now he spares his. Stefan walks away and Damon pulls the stake out of his body. The episode ends with Bonnie having a nightmare of her running through a forest. She trips and falls and when she rises her eyes she sees her ancestor Emily (Bianca Lawson) warning her that \\"It's coming\\".

A R&AW; unit was formed to rehearse Operation Sundown in the Sarsawa Air Force Base in Uttar Pradesh.  The operation  The rehearsals for the operation were carried out in the base.

A graduate of New York University, joined the faculty of the University of Notre Dame in 1938. During World War II, he served in the United States Navy as an engineering officer. He headed a group that conducted blast measurements for the Trinity nuclear test, and served on Tinian with Project Alberta. After the war he returned to Notre Dame. He was director of the Midwestern Universities Research Association Laboratory from 1960 to 1964, dean of its Notre Dame College of Science at Notre Dame from 1967 to 1979, and associate director of the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory from 1979 to 1983. Early life and education Bernard Waldman was born in New York City on October 12, 1913. He attended New York University, from which he received Bachelor of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees. His thesis, on \\"The Resonance Processes in the Disintegration of Boron by Protons\\", formed the basis of a paper published in the Physical Review. His research supported the estimates of J. Robert Oppenheimer and Robert Serber. Although he was a Congregationalist, Waldman joined the faculty of the University of Notre Dame in 1938. He became an assistant professor in 1941.  Manhattan Project  During World War II, Waldman served in the United States Navy as an engineering officer, and was involved in construction and extension of naval bases in the United States. He took a leave of absence from Notre Dame and joined Oppenheimer and Serber at the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory in 1943. He was assigned to Norman F. Ramsey's E-7 Group, which was part of the Ordnance (O) Division responsible for \\"integration of design and delivery\\". Most of the work involved preparing and checking instrumentation from drop tests involving dummy bombs. Waldman (bottom right) on Tinian with Harold Agnew (top left), Luis W. Alvarez (top right) and Lawrence H. Johnston (bottom left) Waldman was the head of Group TR-6 (Airborne Measurements) for the Trinity nuclear test in July 1945. He developed microphones that were dropped by parachute to measure the effect of the blast. He was then assigned to Project Alberta, the part of the Manhattan Project that oversaw the preparation of facilities to test and deploy nuclear weapons, and support their use during the actual missions. As such, he participated in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, as a camera operator on the observation aircraft. He was equipped with a special high-speed Fastax movie camera with six seconds of film in order to record the blast. Unfortunately, Waldman forgot to open the camera shutter, and no film was exposed. Later life After the war ended, Waldman returned to Notre Dame, where he continued his research into the photodisintegration of deuterium and beryllium. For a time he was in charge of a 3-million volt particle accelerator that was the world\`s second most powerful source of X-rays in 1949. In 1960, Waldman took a sabbatical from Notre Dame to become director of the Midwestern Universities Research Association (MURP) Laboratory. He set about fixing problems with the 50 MeV accelerator. These were resolved, but the Federal Government declined to fund MURP's activities, and Walden returned to Notre Dame in 1964. Waldman was appointed dean of Notre Dame's College of Science in 1967. He held this position August, 1979, when he retired at the age of 65. He then became as associate director of the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University, a position he held until 1983. Waldman died in a hospital in Sanford, North Carolina, where he was being treated for cancer, on November 1, 1986. He was survived by his wife, Glenna and three daughters. A funeral service was held at the Basilica of the Sacred Heart on the campus of the University of Notre Dame, and he was interred in its Cedar Grove Cemetery. His papers are in the University of Notre Dame Archives.

It is one of the most notable works by the Indian poet. The poet was very pained at the fact that India was under British rule and laments that fact in this poem. Summary The poet expresses a sense of personal loss in the downfall of his country, India. Addressing India, the poet says that in the old days, India was worshipped like a deity. He wonders where that glory and splendour has disappeared and regrets the fact that his motherland has now been reduced to the position of a slave of the British Empire. The poet also mentions that the country has been humiliated and ashamed of herself grovelling in the dust. There was time when the country soared like an eagle in the skies but now the wings of that great bird have been clipped and it is chained. The poet has no wreath of flowers to offer the country but instead, he will dig into the past and will try to sing of some parts of that great history which is no longer available to the younger generation. The only reward author wants for his effort is that the country should have a kind wish for the author and the countrymen should love him. The author says that his last wish to all the Indians is to dive deep into the past and bring back the lost glory of India Major themes The theme is mainly patriotism. Henry Louis Vivian Derozio talks of the past glory of India and how the country that was called the \\"Golden Bird\\" has been chained and enslaved. He proposes to write about some of that heritage of the distant past and in return hopes for a kind wish from the country and its people.Indispensable THE GOLDEN LYRE, By Mr. Usha Nagpal, National Publication house and did like himself , p-117 The poet has used the image of a golden bird, thus hinting at the past glory of India.

By the end of Napoleonic Wars he retired from military service as a General der Kavallerie in 1815. He became Proprietor of a dragoon regiment in 1809 and held that office until his death in 1832. Early life and career Kne≈æeviƒá was born on 30 November 1755 at Graƒçac (Lika region), in a part of Habsburg Monarchy known as Croatian Military Frontier, as the youngest son of baron Martin Kne≈æeviƒá (1708‚Äì1781), major general of the Habsburg army, and his wife Ur≈°ula Kne≈æeviƒá n√©e Vukasoviƒá (1717‚Äì1776). He had five brothers, who all were military officers, and two sisters. He started his career in 1772 as cadet in the Royal Hungarian Noble Body Guard at Viennese Court.

In the War of the Second Coalition Kne≈æeviƒá led his hussar regiment at the Battle of Cassano on 26 April 1799. The regiment's eight squadrons were part of Johann von Zoph's 1st Division. Near Vaprio d'Adda, the Palatine Hussars launched three attacks and finally broke through Paul Grenier's division, inflicting 200 casualties and capturing 300 French soldiers outright. Together with other Austrian and Russian units, they rounded up 2,800 prisoners and collected as trophies 12 cannons, one howitzer, six ammunition wagons, and one standard. The regiment's losses were severe, 153 killed. For this exploit, Kne≈æeviƒá received the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa on 15 May 1799. On 28 April, his regiment was part of the force that trapped Jean-Mathieu-Philibert Serurier's division and compelled it to surrender.

Biography Moshe Mann was born in Turka, Poland (today Ukraine). He immigrated to Mandatory Palestine in 1926 from Lviv, as part of HaShomer HaTzair movement. He lived in a kibbutz near Haifa and participated in the founding of the National Kibbutz Movement. He joined the Haganah and moved to Merhavia. Military career Mann was involved in building several pre-state Jewish police and paramilitary organizations, including the Notrim, Hish and Palmach. He participated in the Haganah's first rifle course and became an instructor. One of his students was Yigal Allon. He was then responsible for commanding the Afula area forces, and from 1939 the entire Jezreel Valley. During this time he worked with Orde Wingate. In 1942 he was tasked with curbing the activities of the Irgun and Lehi in his area under the nickname \\"Saadya\\". With the forming of the military structure of the Haganah from 1946 onward, Mann was appointed to head the newly created Levanoni Brigade, controlling the north of the country. As the 1947‚Äì48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine broke out, the brigade split into two‚ÄîGolani and Carmeli‚Äîand Mann got the command of Golani. One of Mann's first actions as commander of the north was to organize the Jewish pioneers in the Birya affair. During his tenure as Golani commander he was responsible among other things for the call-up of able men and women into the brigade and HIM in the areas under Golani's jurisdiction, and acquiring arms from the local population for the war effort. The most notable events of his tenure as commander of that brigade were the Battles of the Kinarot Valley in May 1948. Mann had tensions with the IDF high command after Moshe Dayan was appointed to an unspecified post in the Golani Brigade, technically higher than a battalion commander (a post usually reserved just for the brigade commander), and Moshe Carmel was appointed his superior as commander of the northern front. After Mann's wife Zilka died in an Iraqi air raid on his home village on 31 May 1948, Mann quit the military and returned home.

It was built by the prosperous coffee merchant Ludwig Roselius who admired the pioneering spirit of Daniel Defoe's fictional hero Robinson Crusoe. History and architecture In 1931, the Robinson Crusoe House and the Atlantis House opposite completed the construction of buildings in B√∂ttcherstra√üe. The coffee merchant Ludwig Roselius, who envisioned and financed the B√∂ttcherstra√üe project, had himself proposed the design which was developed by Karl von Weihe. The interior was designed by the architects Eduard Scotland and Alfred Runge. Roselius chose the name in memory of the novel by Daniel Defoe from 1719 whose hero was the son of a Bremen merchant who had settled in York. He admired the pioneering Robinson Crusoe for his Hanseatic spirit. Roselius foresaw a rather conventional Lower Saxony brick building with a stepped gable. The house stood at the Martinistra√üe end of the street with a straight-gabled building on the opposite corner. A curved opening supported by a column in the lower corner of each building is a special feature. The rooms in Robinson Crusoe House were devoted principally to the newly founded Club zu Bremen. In addition to the club room, dining room, bar, gallery and Scotland Room (Scotland Stube), there was also a Vogeler Room (Vogeler Saal) on the second floor with nine paintings showing the artistic evolution of the painter Heinrich Vogeler. In 1944, the house was destroyed by bombing but was rebuilt in 1954. None of the original decorations remain but today there are carved panels in the stairway representing scenes from the story of Robinson Crusoe crafted by Theodor Schultz-Walbaum. Located on the outside of the Robin Crusoe House are two sculptures from Bernhard Hoetger called \\"Panther carrying the Night (1912)\\" and \\"Puma carrying the Day (1912)\\". Panther carrying the Night Crusoe Hall The cat sculpture sits above the sea water aquarium outside the house The building's Crusoe Hall (Crusoe Halle) is used as an exhibition room by the Bremen Artisans Association (Angewandte Kunst Bremen) in collaboration with the two B√∂ttcherstra√üe museums, Paula Modersohn-Becker Museum and Ludwig Roselius Museum. A new exhibition is featured each month. From October every year, the hall houses the traditional Weihnachtsmarkt or Christmas market.

He was a member of the Montreal Hockey Club (Montreal HC) that won the Stanley Cup in 1902 and 1903. He died at 23 after only three years of senior hockey play. Hooper is believed to be the first ice hockey player to die from a hockey-related injury.\\"Turning Back Hockey's Pages\\" MacDonald, D. A. L.. Montreal Gazette. March 22, 1934 (p. 13). Personal life Hooper was born in St. Lambert, Quebec, one of six children. He was brother to Charles, Bruce, Reginald, Allan and Harley. In February 1903, Hooper was injured in an ice hockey game and he never fully recovered. In July 1904, he was admitted to Royal Victoria Hospital and he stayed there 'for a period' and was then released to go home, where he died in October 1904. Playing career Hooper had a short but productive ice hockey career. He joined the senior Montreal HC squad in 1901. That 1902 CAHL season he led the league with 17 goals in 8 games and Montreal HC won the league championship. After the league play, Montreal challenged the Stanley Cup champion Winnipeg Victorias and defeated them to win the championship. The series with Winnipeg earned the Montreal HC the nickname 'Little Men of Iron' for their steadfast defence in the final game of 1902 when Montreal was ahead by one goal in the final game of the challenge and Winnipeg was pressing to score. It was the first time since 1894 that Montreal HC had won the Stanley Cup. In the following 1903 CAHL season, Montreal HC defeated Winnipeg in a rematch Stanley Cup challenge, but Hooper and Montreal did not repeat as league champions. Although injured in February, Hooper scored ten goals in six games of league play and five goals in four games of Stanley Cup play. After the 1903 season, many of the Montreal HC players left to join the new Montreal Wanderers. Hooper was the only regular player to stay with the team and was named Captain. The rest of the team was restocked with new players from the junior ranks. The 1904 season would be Hooper's last. He played five games and scored six goals, but was injured when he was hit on the head by a hockey puck. He would eventually die from the injury on October 11, 1904.

The battle was fought in the initial stage of the Macedonian campaign, in the Balkans Theatre. On December 6, a Bulgarian troops attacked the French and British-held trenches in Kosturino, at the time part of the Kingdom of Serbia (present day North Macedonia). The offensive was at first held in check, however on December 8, Bulgaria managed to infiltrate the Memesli ravine. Bulgaria then seized Crete Simonet, thus threatening to outflank the Allies. The Entente defeat at Kosturino led to the complete withdrawal of Allied forces from Serbia, thus enabling the Central Powers to build the Berlin to Constantinople rail line. The Allies in the meantime concentrated on solidifying their defenses in Greece. Prelude The retreat of the Serbian army at the end of October 1915. The 28 June 1914, assassination of Austro-Hungarian heir presumptive Archduke Franz Ferdinand precipitated Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against Serbia. The conflict quickly attracted the involvement of all major European countries, pitting the Central Powers against the Entente coalition and starting World War I. After the entry of the Ottoman Empire into the war on the side of the Central Powers (November 1914), the decisive factor in the Balkans became the attitude of Bulgaria. Bulgaria occupied a strategically important position on the Serbian flank and its intervention on either side of the belligerents would be decisive. Bulgaria and Serbia had fought each other twice in the previous thirty years: in the Serbo-Bulgarian War of 1885 and in the Second Balkan War of 1913. Bulgaria had suffered defeat in 1913 and the Bulgarian government and people generally felt that Serbia had stolen land which rightfully belonged to Bulgaria. While the Allies could only offer Bulgaria small territorial concessions from Serbia and neutral Greece, the Central Powers' promises appeared far more enticing, as they offered to cede most of the land which Bulgaria claimed. With the Allied defeats at the Battle of Gallipoli (April 1915 to January 1916) and the Russian defeat at Gorlice-Tarn√≥w (May to September 1915) demonstrating the Central Powers' strength, King Ferdinand signed a treaty with Germany and on September 21, 1915 Bulgaria began mobilizing for war. After the victory of the Serbian army in the Battle of Kolubara in December 1914, the Serbian front saw a lull until the early autumn of 1915. Under the command of Field Marshal August von Mackensen, the Austro- Hungarian Balkan Army, the German 11th Army and river flotillas on the Danube and the Sava began an offensive on 6 October 1915, the largest offensive against Serbia. By September 1915, despite the extreme sacrifice of the Serbian army, the Austro-Hungarian Balkan Army, having crossed the rivers Sava and Drina and the German 11th Army after crossing the Danube, occupied Belgrade, Smederevo, Po≈æarevac and Golubac, creating a wide bridgehead south of the Sava and Danube rivers, and forcing Serbian forces to withdraw to southern Serbia. On 15 October 1915, two Bulgarian armies attacked, overrunning Serbian units, penetrating into the valley of the South Morava river near Vranje up to 22 October 1915. The Bulgarian forces occupied Kumanovo, ≈†tip, and Skopje, and prevented the withdrawal of the Serbian army to the Greek border and Salonika. For a year, the Allies had repeatedly promised to send serious military forces to Serbia, while nothing had materialized. But with Bulgaria's mobilization to its south, the situation for Serbia became desperate. The developments finally forced the French and the British to decide upon sending a small expedition force of two divisions to help Serbia, but even these arrived too late in the Greek port of Salonika to have any impact in the operations. The main reason for the delay was the lack of available Allied forces due to the critical situation in the Western Front. The Entente used Greek neutrality as an excuse, although they could have used the Albanian coast for a rapid deployment of reinforcements and equipment during the first 14 months of the war. (As the Serbian Marshal Putnik had suggested, the Montenegrin army gave adequate cover to the Albanian coast from the north‚Äîat a safe distance from any Bulgarian advance in the south in the event of a Bulgarian intervention.) The Entente also delayed due to protracted secret negotiations aiming at bringing Bulgaria into the Allied camp, which event would have alleviated Serbia's need for Franco-British help. In the event the lack of Allied support sealed the fate of the Serbian Army. Against Serbia the Central Powers marshaled the Bulgarian Army, a German Army, and an Austro-Hungarian Army, all under the command of Field Marshal Mackensen. The Germans and Austro-Hungarians began their attack on October 7 with a massive artillery barrage, followed by attacks across the rivers. Then, on the 11th, the Bulgarian Army attacked from two directions, one from the north of Bulgaria towards Ni≈°, the other from the south towards Skopje. The Bulgarian Army rapidly broke through the weaker Serbian forces which tried to block its advance. With the Bulgarian breakthrough, the Serbian position became hopeless; their main army in the north faced either encirclement and enforced surrender, or retreat. Marshal Putnik ordered a full Serbian retreat, southwards and westwards through Montenegro and into Albania. The Serbs faced great difficulties: terrible weather, poor roads and the need for the army to help the tens of thousands of civilians who retreated with them. Only soldiers reached the Adriatic coast and embarked on Italian transport ships that carried the army to Corfu and other Greek islands before it traveled on to Thessaloniki. Marshal Putnik had to be carried during the whole retreat; he died just over a year later in a French hospital. The French and British divisions marched north from Thessaloniki in October 1915 under the joint command of French General Maurice Sarrail, and British General Bryan Mahon. On 20 October, the French divisions reached Krivolak on the Vardar river, while the British occupied the strategically important area between the Kosturino Pass, Vardar and lake Doiran. This advance aided the retreating Serbian Army, as the Bulgarians had to concentrate larger forces on their southern flank to deal with a possible invasion into their territory. The French command then became aware of the Bulgarian presence in the Babuna Pass between Veles and Bitola, and attempted to reach a group of Serbian soldiers located to north west of the pass. This led to the Battle of Krivolak which lasted between 5 and 19 November 1915. The French slowed down the Bulgarian advance, thus enabling the bulk of the Serbians to escape; however, Bulgaria retained the dominant mount Arkhangel west of Gradsko, forcing Sarrail to initiate a retreat towards Thessaloniki. The British forces had in the meantime only encountered small bands of Bulgarian deserters, who informed them that the Second Bulgarian Army under General Georgi Todorov had been reinforced at Strumica. On 26 November 1915, a combination of high wind, rain and snow rendered the already steep terrain impassable. The downpour continued until 3 December, soaking the soldiers to the skin and destroying their greatcoats. A total of 23 officers and 1,663 soldiers had to be evacuated back to Salonika due to frostbite and exhaustion, depleting the 10th Irish Division. The division's efficiency was further lowered by the fact that a considerable number of its soldiers were recently arrived and unassimilated drafts pulled together from various parts of the British army. On the same day the French forces that were previously in touch with the British at the Kajali ravine began their evacuation, dangerously exposing the left flank of the 10th Irish Division. Expecting Greece to remain inert, Bulgaria was now able to launch a fresh offensive with its 120 battalions against the 50 that the Allies had in their disposal. On the morning of 4 December, the Bulgarians built trestle bridges across the Crna river, rapidly occupying Bitola. Battle The operations of the Second Bulgarian Army in 1915. On 4 December 1915, Bulgaria commenced an artillery barrage on British positions along the Kosturino ridge, the artillery preparation continued until 6 December when it was augmented. The bombardment reached its peak at 2:30 p.m., while concentrating on the Rocky Peak position south of Ormanli which was held by the Connaught Rangers. Half an hour later small bands of Bulgarian troops attempted to make their way down the ridge in front of the British trench, before being stopped at from the wire. Rocky Peak was briefly overrun by the Bulgarians before the Royal Irish Fusiliers drove them back in hand-to-hand fighting. At dusk the Rocky Peak was reinforced by half a company and a single machine gun, the 6th Royal Dublin Fusiliers were transferred to Kajali with three additional companies heading towards Hasanli. Before the dawn of 7 December, the Bulgarians utilized the heavy fog that covered the battlefield, sneaking up to Rocky Peak and engaging their adversaries with bayonets. Unable to distinguish the similar uniforms the defenders fought their way back the slope. A machine gun was quickly brought up upon the peak, targeting the 30th British Brigade to the south‚Äìeast with the support of mountain artillery. Between 9 and 10:00 a.m., the Connaught Rangers repulsed an infantry charge on their position, a parallel attack on the French portion of the front was also held in check. At 2:00 p.m., four Hampshire companies fell back to Crete Simonet after coming under enfilade fire. A follow up assault on the Connaught Rangers dislodged them from their trenches, and forced them to rally up in Dedeli along with the Hampshires. To the left the Royal Munster Fusiliers held their ground, however upon receiving news of the Connaught Rangers' retreat also retired to Dedeli. The 31st British Brigade abandoned Prsten for high ground in Tatarli. Upon General Mahon's request the 65th British Brigade was dispatched to Dojran, French General Maurice Bailloud also provided a mountain battery and two battalions that were sent to Tatarli. At the same time the French rear guard was engaged in skirmishes on both banks of the Vardar river while retreating towards Furka. On the morning of 8 December, French mountain artillery broke up a Bulgarian attack on the junction between the 156th French Division and the British positions. At 11:00 a.m., Bulgaria resumed its assault on Crete Rivet in front of Crete Simonet, two subsequent attacks were fended off, however the three companies holding the position had to withdraw after losing 64 men. At 3:30 p.m., the British command received a report indicating that Bulgarian troops had infiltrated the Memesli ravine, in an attempt to strike the right flank of the 31st British Brigade, while also seeping through between the 5th and 6th Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers in the center. The 31st and 30th British Brigades were immediately ordered to fall back to Causli and Dedeli respectively. At 5:45 p.m., the Bulgarian army overtook Crete Simonet seizing 10 artillery pieces and celebrating their victory by blowing bugles and launching flares. At 2:00 a.m. on 9 December, the 156th French Division plodded to Bajimia after repulsing a Bulgarian attack that left 400 Bulgarians dead, no fighting took place during the rest of the day. On 10 December, minor clashes continued as Bulgarian raiding parties harassed the retreating Allies. At 1:00 p.m. on 11 December, the 11th Bulgarian Division seized Bogdanci, cutting the local telephone line and capturing an ammunition depot. The Allies had now selected the Doiran train station as their new target, in preparation of a complete evacuation towards Salonika. However the 9th King's Own Royal Regiment remained isolated from the rest of Allies, only beginning its withdrawal at 12:45 a.m. on 12 December. An hour later the regiment encountered a battalion of soldiers resting by the roadside, belatedly realising that they belonged to the enemy. The resulting bayonet charge led to the death or capture of 122 British soldiers. By the evening of the same day the evacuation of the Entente troops into Greece had been complete, with the 10th British and the 57th, 122nd and 156th French Divisions crossing the border. Greek border guards assured the Allies that they would oppose any Bulgarian attempt to cross the frontier. An Allied spy later confirmed that Bulgaria had no intent of breaching the border, instead halting from it. The battle at Kosturino and the subsequent evacuation of the Allies resulted in 1,209 British casualties, including 99 killed, 386 wounded, 724 missing and 10 artillery pieces. French casualties amounted to 1,804 killed, wounded or missing, as well as 12 machine guns and 36 ammunition wagons. The number of Bulgarian losses during the battle are estimated to vastly greater than that of the Allies, with at least 400 being killed on 9 December. Aftermath Thus there resulted a clear, albeit incomplete victory for the Central Powers. As a consequence they opened the railway line from Berlin to Constantinople, allowing Germany to prop up its weaker partner, the Ottoman Empire. Despite the Central Powers' victory, the Allies managed to save a part of the Serbian Army, which although battered, seriously reduced and almost unarmed, escaped total destruction and after reorganizing resumed operations six months later. And most damagingly for the Central Powers, the Allies‚Äîusing the moral excuse of saving the Serbian Army‚Äîmanaged to replace the impossible Serbian front with a viable one established in Macedonia (albeit by violating the territory of an officially neutral country); a front which would prove key to their final victory three years later. The Allies were able to concentrate on fortifying the so-called Entrenched Camp, in preparation for a large scale Bulgarian invasion of Greece and an impending assault on Salonika. Following the failure of the August Offensive, the Gallipoli Campaign drifted. Ottoman success began to affect public opinion in the United Kingdom, with news discrediting Ian Standish Monteith Hamilton's performance being smuggled out by journalists like Keith Murdoch and Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett. Disaffected senior officers such as General Stopford also contributed to the overall air of gloom. The prospect of evacuation was raised on 11 October 1915 but Hamilton resisted the suggestion, fearing the damage to British prestige. He was dismissed as commander shortly afterwards and replaced by Lieutenant General Sir Charles Monro. Autumn and winter brought relief from the heat but also led to gales, blizzards and flooding, resulting in men drowning and freezing to death, while thousands suffered frostbite. After consulting with the commanders of VIII Corps at Helles, IX Corps at Suvla, and Anzac, Sir Herbert Kitchener agreed with Monro and passed his recommendation to the British Cabinet, who confirmed the decision to evacuate in early December. Suvla and Anzac were to be evacuated in late December, the last troops leaving before dawn on 20 December 1915. Troop numbers had been slowly reduced since 7 December 1915 and ruses, such as William Scurry's self-firing rifle, which had been rigged to fire by water dripped into a pan attached to the trigger, were used to disguise the Allied departure. At Anzac Cove troops maintained silence for an hour or more, until curious Ottoman troops ventured to inspect the trenches, whereupon the Anzacs opened fire. The final British troops departed from Lancashire Landing around 04:00 on 8 January 1916. The Newfoundland Regiment was chosen to be a part of the rearguard, finally withdrawing from Gallipoli on 9 January 1916.
