He works with high school placekickers and punters and evaluates them for college football programs. Sailer was named an All-American as both a kicker and a punter while playing college football for the UCLA Bruins. He played professionally in the Arena Football League (AFL). Early life Sailer was born to Elisabeth and Hans Sailer, who had emigrated in 1969 from West Germany to Burbank, California. His parents were soccer fans who knew nothing about football. They exposed him to soccer early, and he excelled as a youth soccer player. Sailer attended high school in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, where he was both the kicker and punter at Notre Dame High. As a senior, he set a state single-season record with 22 field goals, making seven from 50 yards of more to help his team win a Division III title. He was named to the USA Today All-USA team, and finished his prep career with a state record 33 career field goals. He also played soccer as a defender. College career Sailer decided to attend the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), because Bruins football coach Terry Donahue and soccer coach Sigi Schmid allowed him to play both sports, even though the two teams' seasons overlap. His athletic scholarship was rare for a kicker, a position which coaches often filled with walk-ons. He put soccer on hold as a freshman to get acclimated to school while playing football. Later, he decided he could not play both, and chose football. As a freshman in 1995, Sailer won the job as punter and ranked 15th in the country with a 42.2 yard average. After kicker Bjorn Merten graduated, Sailer assumed the position in 1997, becoming the first Bruin since Frank Corral in 1977 to handle both punts and kicks. That season, Sailer made four field goals in a 39‚Äì31 win over Oregon, including a 56-yard kick that stood as a school record until Ka'imi Fairbairn's 60-yarder in 2015. Sailer finished the season as the runner-up behind Mart√≠n Gram√°tica for the Lou Groza Award, given annually to the nation's top college kicker. He was named a first-team All-American kicker by the American Football Coaches Association and the Walter Camp Football Foundation. Additionally, the Football Writers Association of America named Sailer to their first team as a punter. He is the only player in UCLA history to have received first-team All-American honors at two positions in the same season. In his senior year in 1998, Sailer struggled with his field goals after being bothered for most of the season with a groin injury. He suffered the injury during practice when he did not warm up before participating in a kicking duel with a local sports anchorman. Professional career After leaving college, Sailer signed with the San Francisco 49ers in the National Football League (NFL), and played for the Los Angeles Dragons of the Spring Football League and four years in the AFL. While still playing, he also ran organized camps and provided private tutoring to high school kickers and punters. He started Chris Sailer Kicking in 1999, taking financial losses on his camps to build his client base in pursuit of his goal of forming the first national recruiting camp for kicking specialists at the high school level. He held the first national camp in Las Vegas in 2003, when 125 kickers and punters participated in the presence of 30 NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision coaches. Sailer's kicking camp became the most prominent in the country. He is routinely contacted by college coaches to assist in identifying potential college recruits for their special teams. Players which he identifies as top recruits generally receive scholarships from major football programs. Sailer partnered with former UCLA teammate Chris Rubio, who provides services for long snappers as part of Rubio Long Snapping. Greg Biggins of Scout.com described Chris Sailer Kicking as \\"pretty much a monopoly\\". , Sailer's camps were drawing an estimate of 450 to 500 kickers, punter, and long snappers. By 2014, thirteen of the 32 starting kickers in the NFL had attended his camp. Sailer is on the selection committee for the Chris Sailer Award, presented annually to the top high school placekicker in the nation. The award began in 2011, and is part of the Herbalife National High School Football Awards.

It was built from to . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 10 April 2006.  History  The Rocks Guesthouse was constructed -1900 as a private residence, on land held by Elizabeth Hamilton, wife of pastoralist and prominent publican Frederic Hamilton. Built as an investment, the house was leased to middle class tenants. In 1909 Dr Ernest Humphrey converted it into a private hospital, which it remained until a further conversion in the mid-1930s into a guesthouse. The Rocks continued as \\"gents only\\" accommodation throughout World War Two, during which it was made safe with the addition of an above-ground air raid shelter. While it has changed hands several times since, it has remained a guesthouse. The Rocks Guesthouse, is situated in the former grounds of John Melton Black's residence (since demolished), one of the first houses built in Townsville. JM Black arrived in Cleveland Bay in 1864, where he established at Ross Creek a small port to service the inland pastoral run he had taken up in partnership with Robert Towns. Townsville, as it became known, rapidly became one of the most successful ports in north Queensland. By late 1866 it was described as a thriving seaport with considerable trade and commerce facilities such as banks, hotels, stores, businesses and a post office, servicing the burgeoning pastoral properties in the Burdekin and North Kennedy districts. In the 1870s mining to the west provided a major impetus for the rapid growth of Townsville. As sugar growers moved into the coastal plains, a large fleet of vessels, providing export facilities for the sugar industry, was established at Townsville. In 1882 the Great Northern railway to Charters Towers was opened, with an extension to Ravenswood in 1884. The telegraph line from Townsville to Charters Towers was completed in July 1883 and the first telephone exchange was opened at Townsville during November 1883. By 1900, the economy of the city was soundly based on the mining, pastoral, sugar and transport industries. About 1864 JM Black had erected his private residence on a prominent hill overlooking the emerging port. In these establishment years Black controlled the affairs of Townsville and when the town became a municipality in early 1866 he was elected as the first Mayor. A year later he resigned and left for Scotland to take up business affairs associated with an inheritance. Title to his Melton Hill property (allotment 5 of section 3A, containing 6 acres), was held jointly by Towns and Black, but was transferred to Robert Towns in 1867 following Black's departure. In 1870 title was transferred to Shepherd Smith of Sydney, Manager of the Bank of New South Wales. Three years later Smith sub-divided the land into 24 lots. The site containing Black's former house and remaining grounds was situated on subdivisions 5-7 of allotment 5 of section 3a. The Melton Hill subdivisions attracted the business elite of Townsville. On 25 August 1877, well known squatter, wool provedore, businessman and separationist, Enoch Price Walter Hays, purchased Black's former house and remaining grounds. He leased the house to bank manager H Echlin, until the end of 1884. One year later Hays and his wife moved into Black's former house and they continued to reside there until Hays' death in 1893. Mrs Hays remained here until the property was transferred in 1895 to Elizabeth Hamilton, wife of Frederick Hamilton, pastoralist and publican. The Hamiltons resided nearly diagonally opposite Mrs Hays, and acquired at least two other properties on Melton Hill in Elizabeth Hamilton's name, and on which they erected investment houses. During the time that the Hamilton family owned the former JM Black residence, it was leased to middle-class tenants. A second house (later \\"The Rocks Guesthouse\\") was constructed in the grounds of JM Black's former residence between and 1900., It was a combined gabled and hipped roof structure consisting of four to five rooms with a central hallway, front verandah covered by a curved corrugated iron awning and a skillion verandah at the rear. The rooms were large and airy with high ceilings, picture rails, timber fretwork ceiling roses and interior partitions of tongue-in-groove boards. The main drawing room had a large bay window framed by an arch. The windows were large double-hung timber sashes with two panes per sash. A brick wall along the laneway was also constructed at this time and consists of bricks of similar make and type to the piers of the house. The new house was leased first to George Frazer, manager of the shipping firm Howard Smith and Sons, for two years and then to William Montgomerie. In 1903 Townsville was hit by Cyclone Leonta, which caused damage to most of the houses on Melton Hill, including the complete destruction of the residence of long term Townsville medical practitioner, Dr Ernest Humphrey. In 1905 Elizabeth Hamilton died and the property containing Black's former house and the 1897-1900 residence was transferred to Frederic Hamilton. A year later Hamilton sold the whole of the property (both houses) to Dr Ernest Humphrey and his wife, who moved into the residence and continued to let the new house to Montgomerie, who remained there until 1909. In late 1909 Dr Humphrey converted the residence into a private hospital. Alterations included substantial additions. A corridor led to new rooms at the rear of the building, which included a kitchen, common bathroom and laundry, sterilizing room, operating room and servants' quarters. The operating room and sterilizing room were adjoining and were accessed from the house but the operating room was also accessible externally. This room had three ceiling window lights to allow natural light for operations, Inside, fixed timber vents were situated on the lower third of the room on two sides and closable timber vents were located on the upper level. The lower vents were needed to dissipate the heavy ether used in operations. The front entrance to the hospital was accessed from imposing rendered brick stairs. The plans for the hospital conversion were approved in August and work was complete by November 1909. Miss I Campbell, Matron of the Townsville General Hospital, was employed to manage the hospital, which was called \\"The Rocks Private Hospital.\\" It was a modern and well-equipped hospital with a staff of one matron and seven nurses and aides. The nurses were housed in a building constructed at the rear of the block along Herbert Street. This burnt down in the 1970s. After 15 years operating his hospital and 30 years practicing medicine in Townsville, Dr Humphrey unexpectedly died on 16 September 1925 during a sea voyage south. Mrs Humphrey continued to reside in the family home (the former Black house) until at least 1938, but title to the whole of the Melton Hill property passed to their son Jack on Dr Humphrey's death. In 1926 Jack had subdivisions 5, 6 and 7 re-surveyed to clarify the unusual angle of the allotments resulting from JM Black's former house being built prior to the 1873 subdivisional survey. Notings on the 1926 survey plan indicate a \\"wood building\\" and \\"brick wall\\" on the hospital site. It appears that The Rocks continued to operate as a private hospital, managed by Matron M Williams, into the mid-1930s, despite title to the hospital site being transferred in 1929 from Jack Humphrey to Walter Bartlett Chapman. In 1934 the property was transferred to Frank Edward Payne, who converted it into a boarding house. The conversion may have reflected the impact of the Hospitals Act of 1923, which introduced a system of partly government-funded district hospitals, transforming public hospitals from charitable institutions for the poor to essential community services and a government responsibility. This system was enhanced under the Hospitals Act of 1936 and from 1 January 1946 access to public hospital treatment was made free for all Queenslanders. Between 1920 and 1940 the number of beds in Queensland's public hospitals rose from 3,700 to 7,606, increasing at a greater rate than population growth. In addition, the government- run hospitals tended to be better equipped than the small local private hospitals. In the 1930s the rooms in The Rocks Private Hospital were converted into guestrooms and are still used as such. The previously spacious recovery rooms were divided by high timber partitions while in other areas internal walls were removed. The western side of the house was extended with four new bedrooms under a skillion roof. As a large, airy and ornate building with panoramic views of Cleveland Bay and Townsville, it quickly became popular with affluent holiday-makers and visiting professionals. Utilising the former name, Payne advertised the place under the name \\"The Rocks Guest House\\". By 1939 a male clientele was targeted, offering services such as free lunch and a taxi service. The Rocks Guest House continued to advertise throughout World War Two and while little information regarding the use of the building at this period survives, anecdotal evidence suggests that it may have been used as a convalescent home for returning servicemen. An above ground air-raid shelter was constructed at the rear of the house during the war. In 1962 George and Sophie Gray purchased The Rocks Guest House. A world champion billiardist, George Gray had been a master cue-man during the 1920s. In 1936 Gray retired with his family to Townsville, running a billiard hall in Flinders Street. A large billiard table was the focal point of The Rocks during the 1960s, which continued to operate as a boarding house for young men. After this period the property deteriorated and functioned as budget lodging. An August 1966 plan detailing proposed alterations to the boarding house indicated that by that date a separate wooden structure had been erected toward the rear of the allotment. It consisted of four rooms plus a verandah built against the drystone wall of Herbert Street. This building was largely destroyed by fire in June 1977 and what remained was demolished in August that year. The Rocks Guesthouse changed hands in 1995 and extensive renovations were made. Partitions to the front rooms introduced as in the 1930s were removed and the large decorative arch, which announced the bay window, was reinstated as a key element to the main drawing room. Electrical re-wiring was undertaken and repairs were carried out to walls, floors and ceilings damaged by water and termite infestation. During the renovations one of the walls introduced in the 1909 additions was removed. Other elements were either revealed or rediscovered by the removal of introduced cladding, including original timber ceiling roses and stairs of brick rendered in stucco, left in situ under the extended front verandah. The ornate fretwork under the gable was restored as well as the gable finial and painted property sign. A new verandah balustrade was installed and the curved brick wall at the front of the property was reconstructed. In 1996 The Rocks was reopened as up-market Bed & Breakfast accommodation. During the course of renovations made in 1997, a concrete pit or bunker was discovered beneath the floorboards. It was concealed in one of the bedrooms, accessible by a small timber hatch in the bedroom floor. Its original use or date of construction is unknown. In 2016, the Rocks is a private residence.  Description  The Rocks Guesthouse is situated high on Melton Hill at 20 Cleveland Terrace, with panoramic views of the Coral Sea, Magnetic Island and Cleveland Bay. It is accessed from Cleveland Terrace. There is an unnamed laneway on the eastern side of the property and Herbert Street flanks the southern boundary. The place is an asymmetrical timber structure with readily discernable stages of metamorphous from private residence to hospital and later to guesthouse. The Rocks Guesthouse consists of a combination of gabled and hipped roof structures, each timber framed and timber clad, with roofs of corrugated iron. The original portion of the house () has a hipped roof with a projecting front gable and a half front verandah with a curved iron roof. A verandah has been added at an early date in front of the projecting gable and continuing around the eastern side of the house overlooking the adjacent laneway. A further skillion-roofed addition to the original front verandah extends over early brick and rendered stucco stairs, which remain in situ under the boards. The verandahs have a recent dowelling balustrade between timber columns, which have decorative timber brackets. The handrail is an angular shape. Flooring to the verandahs is of 4in wide hardwood. Modern replica work includes the fretwork under the gable, the gable finial and the property name sign. The large front entrance door is early as are the door fittings. The exterior walls of the original house are exposed stud frame lined internally with 8in deep chamfer boards. The piers for the original house are of brick (commons) similar to the ones used to construct the side wall. The piers (13?in x 13?in) are supporting bearers and in turn are supported by a layer of small rocks in a mud mixture. The brick piers extend partway to the middle of the house; beyond this, concrete piers are continued to the end of the operating theatre. Internally the rooms of the original house have high ceilings, picture rails, timber fretwork ceiling roses and timber partitioning in 5in wide tongue-and-groove boards. The main drawing room has a large bay window framed by an arch. The windows are large double-hung timber sashes with two panes per sash. While the side windows have long been removed and replaced by French windows and fanlights, evidence of their existence remains behind the door-jambs on the verandah, above the fan light and from the part removal of diagonal bracing. Original timber ceiling roses have been uncovered throughout the house and replicas have replaced those that were missing. Electric fans have been installed in some of the rooms and wired up through the ceiling roses. Above the internal doors are decorative timber fretwork panels. The pattern is very similar to the fretwork in Osler House and similar to fretwork attributed to Benjamin Toll that is found also in Charters Towers. Floors throughout are 6in wide hoop pine. The principal additions associated with the conversion of the residence into a hospital in 1909, including a former operating theatre, staff quarters and kitchen, are largely confined to the rear of the residence. Of particular note is an attached hipped roof structure, which formerly contained an operating room and sterilizing room. The former operating room (now a guestroom) is still accessible from outside. This room has three lights in the roof, covered with corrugated iron. Fixed timber vents are located on the lower third of the room on two sides and closable timber vents are located on the upper level. There is an ornate ceiling rose of pressed metal. The remainder of the rear rooms have been converted into guest rooms and some doors have been in-filled. Some of the smaller rooms have been converted into en-suites to service adjoining rooms. In the roof space above the hall in the rear section, is a large early water tank. Four rooms constructed on the western side of the house in the 1930s have been converted into two rooms, en-suite and porch area. These rooms are under a skillion roof and the entrance porch is concealed behind timber lattice. An above ground air-raid shelter constructed during World War Two is located at the back of the house and is currently used as a guest room. It has a modern en-suite added to the room. There is a concrete pit or bunker under the western side of the house, accessible via a small timber hatch in the floor of one of the 1930s rooms. It measures long by wide and is high. It has two large vent pipes inserted in the concrete ceiling, which emerge in the space between the top of the concrete structure and the floorboards of the house. There is a timber and iron garage in the back yard, next to the former operating theatre, which is a later addition. = Gardens = The Rocks Guesthouse occupies most of the allotment with two small landscaped garden areas at the front of the house and along the eastern side, dominated by a meandering brick pavement. At the rear of the house the garden is less defined and there is a paved car parking area. Two of the three flora identified in the 1997 Melton Hill Workshop Report as significant, remain. The frangipani (Plumeria) in particular, located on the eastern side of the house, has grown into a sizable and noteworthy tree as has the coconut palm (Cocos nucifera) that is located on the front western side to the building. = Stone and Brick Wall = The front of the property has a very impressive entrance stairway and rock wall, which was built in either the first or second stage of construction ( or 1909). The return section of the stairs leading up to the house survives under the present verandah. The front stone wall joins onto the side brick wall which curves around the corner of the property and is situated over the boundary line on an unnamed laneway which runs between Herbert Street and Cleveland Terrace. The brick wall and the stone wall are noted in the 1926 and later surveys. The bright red bricks are laid in a variation of Flemish bond and indicate signs of early brick making techniques with characteristic folding of the pug, lack of consistency in sizing and imperfections. The rendered capping course is painted white.  Heritage listing  The Rocks Guesthouse was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 10 April 2006 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Rocks Guesthouse, constructed -1900 as a private residence and converted in 1909 into a private hospital, is important in demonstrating part of the pattern of Queensland's history, in particular the construction of middle-class urban housing in areas with desirable amenity values; and the establishment of private hospitals in urban centres in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.A concrete air-raid shelter in the back yard remains as evidence of the impact of World War Two on the civilian population of Townsville. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Rocks Guesthouse demonstrates rare surviving evidence of early 20th century private hospitals in Queensland, which are no longer common. The former operating room in particular is now rare in Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Rocks Guesthouse is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a late 19th- century middle-class North Queensland timber residence converted into a private hospital in the early 20th century: The core includes spacious, high- ceilinged rooms; a large bay window to the principal public room; and decorative elements such as fretwork ceiling vents. Its grounds retain an early brick and stone retaining wall and front garden stairs. At the rear of the original house the former operating room remains substantially intact and is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of its type, including the need for adequate light and ventilation, demonstrated in the low fixed louvre vents, upper level movable louvres, overhead skylights and both internal and external entry. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Rocks Guesthouse makes an important aesthetic contribution to the Melton Hill historical precinct. Situated in Cleveland Terrace between St James Cathedral and Synod Hall at one end and the remnants of JM Black's Drystone Wall on the other, it forms part of a notable group of elite residences, including Selhurst and Warringa.

The structure is positioned near the point where the River Rh√¥ne flows out of Lake Geneva towards Lyon. It was created between 1883 and 1892 (and subjected to subsequent improvements) to exploit the flow of the river to provide water pressure to feed the city's water supply and a hydraulic power network. Furthermore, the weir of the structure was designed to regulate the level of the lake. The structure lost its original function as a power source in 1963, but it nevertheless continued to house pumping equipment to service Geneva's drinking water supply till 1988. The weir of the power plant was used some more years till it was taken over by the Barrage du Seujet (Seujet barrage) in 1995, which is located approximately fifty meters downstream from the BFM. Towards the end of the twentieth century the BFM was converted into an entertainment venue, reopening in 1997 as an opera house / concert hall designed by the architect Bernard Picenni in association with the acoustician Peutz and the scenographer dUCKS sc√©no. At the time when the project was defined as a \\"power plant\\" there was no automatic correlation between a \\"power plant\\" and a public electricity supply. The idea in 1882 was to feed power in the form of pressurized water to local manufacturing businesses, who could use it to operate their own powered machinery, which might indeed include generators. Another objective involved using the pumped water to feed the reservoirs of the public drinking water supply. However, in 1887 electricity generation started in a building nearby the BFM, where generators were driven by pressurized water supplied from the BFM. The hydraulic power network needed a pressure valve to avoid the damage from excessive pressure within the network which was located beside the BFM and which was the precursor to Geneva's Jet d'Eau (fountain). The project By 1880 it had become clear that the existing hydraulic structure, sited at the city's Pont de la Machine (\\"Machine Bridge\\"), was no longer sufficient for Geneva's growing needs, despite a succession of upgrades since the installation of the first structure back in 1709. The cantonal authorities therefore granted to the city a concession for exploitation of the \\"motor power\\" (in French \\"forces motrice\\") of the Rh√¥ne on 30 December 1882. The city committed to construct a new \\"hydraulic factory\\" (in French \\"usine hydraulique\\") which would provide drinking water to the city and energy in the form of pressurized water for the operation of machinery. At the same time they embarked on the work necessary to regulate the level of Lake Geneva, notably by construction of a curtain weir across the river. The project as originally envisaged involved building the B√¢timent des Forces motrices on land administered by the then separate municipality of Plainpalais (later subsumed into Geneva) which was in financial difficulties. The Geneva city administration therefore entered into negotiations to move the district frontiers in order to bring the proposed site within the Geneva city boundary. Plainpalais rejected the idea, however. It was therefore decided to reposition the site for the new building to an artificial island positioned in the middle of the river, after it had been agreed in 1882 that the river bed itself was part of Geneva. The river was divided into two parallel channels, called respectively the \\"Canal d'alimentation\\" (\\"Supply [of public drinking and fountain water] channel\\") on the left side and the \\"Canal de r√©gulation\\" (\\"Regulation [of the water level] channel\\") on the right side. On the initiative of Jean-Daniel Colladon, the civil engineer Th√©odore Turrettini now embarked on a parallel career as a local politician, when he was elected to the Geneva city council. He went on to head up the construction project with energy and imagination. Construction Before 1882 the level of the lake surface varied with the seasons, rising to it highest level at the end of the winter when the snows melted and the lake was filled by streams and torrents from the surrounding mountains. Work on the structure began in November 1893, when the level of the lake and the flow of water through it was expected to remain relatively low for the next five to six months. Along the part of the river where the powerhouse was built the river was separated into two parallel channels and these were drained successively in order to permit the construction of the building, the hydraulic structures and of a curtain weir attached to the Pont de la Machine (\\"Machine Bridge\\") located a few hundred meters upstream. Five Jonval turbines were installed in the small wing of the powerhouse crossing the river and commissioned in May 1886, producing a combined power of 900 kW. Two of the turbines supplied water pressure to what is today the city's old town, and the other three supplied surrounding districts, some of them as far as away. The pressurized water network served, primarily, small businesses including, notably, clock and watchmakers. In 1892 the larger main turbine hall was ready, with space for a further 15 turbines which were installed progressively over the next few years except the last two. The last of them was installed in 1897, by which time the full complement of 18 turbines was providing 3.3 MW of power. = Technical details = Curtain Weir  The curtain weir was attached to the superstructure of the Pont de la Machine bridging the right arm of the river Rh√¥ne. The old superstructure was replaced during the construction of the power plant by a new superstructure for pedestrian use made from puddled iron. The chosen building material was strong enough to support the additional lateral forces introduced by the curtain weir into the structure. The curtain weir consisted of 39 single roller blinds made from larch wood. It was able to dam the Rh√¥ne to a height of maximal 3.3 meters.  Powerhouse  The neo-classical powerhouse sat on an L-shaped floor plan, with the main hall aligned along the length of the river and a shorter hall connecting the main hall with the river bank at the western end of the building. The natural stone cladded concrete structure has large round arched glazed windows. The roof was supported by an iron truss structure without roof support pillars or dividing walls inside the building in a way that a vast open unencumbered space for the machinery inside the powerhouse was provided. The interior of the turbine hall was decorated in the flamboyant Beaux-Arts style fashionable at the time. Only the upper facade on the eastern end, facing the lake, reflected the extrovert decorated style of the interior, supplemented at the time by statues representing Neptune, Ceres and Mercury. The Jet d‚Äôeau in its original location ca. 1886 In order to avoid excessive pressure build-up in the hydraulic power network, a release valve was fitted beside the main hall of the powerhouse. A tall water fountain, the Jet d'Eau, was ejected by the device whenever it was activated. This happened typically at end of work when the factories switched off the machines one at the time, so that the pressure in the system was hard to control and the supply of pressurized water was difficult to adapt to the real demand. The tall fountain was visible from a long distance and became the landmark of the city. In 1891 it was moved to the current location in the lake where it is operated for the sole purpose of a tourist attraction without any other function.  Turbines  Jonval turbine wheel originating from the Usine des Forces Motrices shown in front of a former Escher Wyss & Cie. factory building in Zurich. Interior of the powerhouse with the pumps. Escher Wyss & Cie. of Zurich delivered the Jonval turbines designed for submerged operation. They were capable to process a total runoff of 600‚Äì800 m¬≥/s at a drop height of 2 to 4 m. Each had a maximal power of 210 hp. The three concentric arranged blade rings allowed to adjust the power of the turbine to the available drop height and the actual demand. The control was done by partially covering the guide vanes of the turbine. Each turbine powered two double-acting piston pumps in a lying V-configuration located in the hall of the powerhouse. The two pumps shared a vertical arranged common hydraulic accumulator. In the 1960s the Jonval turbines were one by one replaced by Kaplan turbines.  Distribution network  The distribution network used three different pressure levels. The lowest pressure level served for the drinking water supply, the intermediate and the high pressure level served as hydraulic power network. The intermediate pressure level had an operating pressure of 6.5 bar and was reached 1896 a length of 82 km. It was used for powering 130 water engines type Schmid with a gross power of 230 hp. The high pressure network had an operating pressure of 14 bar and reached an extension of 93 km. It was used to power 207 turbines and motors, as well as elevator drives. The gross power was 3000 hp. Many turbines were used for driving generators for electric lighting. In 1887 an electricity generation plant was built next to the powerhouse, which generated 110 V DC with a maximal power of 800 hp and an AC network with a maximal power of 600 hp. The generators were driven by a water turbine supplied from the hydraulic power network. The hydraulic power network was not in competition with the electric power supply, but was more considered a supplement to the electric power supply. Only during the economic crisis of the 1930s, the demand of pressurized water as energy supply declined. The last water engine was decommissioned in 1958. Conversion The Le B√¢timent des Forces motrices lost its principal original functions during the 1960s, as manufacturing industry moved out to the edge of the city. It was classified as a historic monument in 1988, and then as a cultural asset of national importance. Meanwhile, various avenues were explored to find a new use for the building. After various meetings with the responsible city department, and thanks to the generosity of a locally based benefactor, the decision was taken to adapt the main building as a 1,000 seat auditorium suitable for theatrical uses. The buildings should be able to host productions from the city's Grand Theatre for a year, during that buildings major renovation of 1997/98, following which the B√¢timent des Forces motrices should continue to be available for theatrical events and other entertainment spectacles. Regarding the BFM's original functions, just two small pumps would be left in the side wing. The conversion was based on plans drawn up by the Geneva-based architect Bernard PicenniBernard Lescaze et Tahani S. Khalil, Un op√©ra sur l'eau, ou la r√©v√©lation d'un lieu : L'usine des Forces Motrices de la coulouvreni√®re √† Gen√®ve, √âditions Suzanne Hurter, 1997 The side wing linking to the left (south) bank of the Rh√¥ne was converted into a reception area, while the main turbine hall became the main theatre. The theatre, opened in September 1997, was constructed entirely of wood. It provided 801 seats in the main area and a further 144 on the balcony/gallery. In December 1997 a pedestrian walkway was set up against the northern and western faces of the building, establishing a connection between the Promenade des Lavandi√®res (the unbuilt strip of land to the east of the BFM and between the two channels of the Rh√¥ne) and the Place des Volontaires (\\"le Place des Volontaires\\" - on the bank of the river at the southern end of the side wing that connects the main turbine hall with the shore). At the Place des Volontaires is a small cultural centre associated with the BFM. Construction of the walkway used the piles and supports originally created for the inspection walkway along the outside of the turbine hall, below the windows on its side.

It was designed by M. Vogiatzoglou and Joseph Gabriel Rooney, and built from 1947 to 1950 by Vause and Hayne. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 25 August 2000.  History  The foundation stone of Townsville's Saints Theodores Greek Orthodox Church was laid on 16 March 1947. In June 1950 this Church was officially opened and dedicated, though religious practice had commenced from 1948 while the building was still being completed. It is named after three saints called Theodore. Some of the earliest Greek migrants to Australia arrived in the 1850s. Many of these were sailors or deckhands who jumped ship after arriving aboard sailing vessels at the various Australian port cities. In the Australian Colonies these early Greeks found employment generally in mining, seamen aboard coastal shipping, or as wharf labourers. In Queensland little evidence exists to a Greek presence during the greater part of the 19th century, but the first Greek to this Colony to be naturalised was Christopher Arsenios in 1868. Arsenios was a Greek Orthodox Priest who heralded from Corfu, who settled in Clermont. The first real wave of Greek migration to Australia did not take place until the early part of the 20th century, in the years leading up to the commencement of World War I. By the turn of the 20th century the numbers of Greeks in Australia was insignificant. Even in the major cities such as Sydney and Melbourne, Greeks only composed a very small group. By 1915 though, some 1000 Greeks were estimated as residing in Sydney alone, and in Queensland 400, with fifty in Brisbane. In Queensland evidence suggests that the major place of origin of these Greek migrants by 1915 was from Kythira. One of the main reasons for these Greek arrivals in Australia was the political unrest at home in the period prior to World War I, as it was to occur again in the 1920s. The Balkan Wars took place during 1912 and 1913, involving Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria, Montenegro and Turkey. In order to escape the effects of this conflict many Greeks left Macedonia and other northern regions and came to places such as Australia. The first decade of the 20th century was a turbulent period in Greek politics, Greece being constantly in conflict with Bulgaria and Turkey over Macedonia and Crete. This factor gave a spur to Greek migration overseas. Most of the migrants went to North America but some came to Australia. The small number who had come to these shores in the nineteenth century had no doubt sent word back of possibilities in this country and their compatriots were now following them. After the end of World War I, another spur to Greek migration was a subsequent war between Greece and Turkey over Smyrna that broke out during 1921‚Äì1922. As a destination for Greek migrants, Australia was to become an even more obvious choice from 1924, due to the United States of America instituted a severe quota limit on migration into that country. The subsequent Greek arrivals in places such as Queensland accelerated the proliferation of Greek cafes and other eating places in Brisbane and the country. The new arrivals found that the path to success had already been carved out by the pioneers of the first two decades. One history of Greek migration to Queensland surmised: > \\"The period from 1915 to the Second World War marks the expansion of the > Greek Community throughout [Queensland] ... and its growing organisation. > Not only does the Greek population in Brisbane undergo a sharp increase but > there is a building up of significant Greek settlements in all the > provincial cities and the appearance of al least one Greek family in almost > every small town in the State. This is the period when the Greek cafe, with > its aproned proprietor and culinary aromas, became one of the focal points > of town life. If the town could not support a Greek cafe, it was still in > its infancy! Everywhere, there sprang up Busy Bee Cafes, and Blue Bird > Cafes, and Paragon Cafes, and Majestic Cafes and Bellevue Cafes!\\" In Queensland prior to World War I, one of the few significant regional Greek communities that came into existence was at Innisfail. This community commenced in about 1910, with its Greek residents becoming either shopkeepers or labourers. Other canefield communities with a Greek presence at this time were also Gordonvale and Ingham. In Townsville, Greeks began to arrive and settle in this locale in approximately 1916. Amongst the first arrivals recorded were Spyros and Vasilios Makris, Raftopoulos, Maltepes, John and Dimitrios Hondros and Nicholas and George Voyatzis. Though these early Townsville Greeks did not establish a formal Greek Community until the 1940s, they nonetheless periodically organised social, cultural and religious activities in celebration of their Greek origins. To meet the interim religious needs of this developing Townsville Greek community, a visiting priest from Innisfail conducted services in St James' Cathedral, as did Metropolitan of Australia Timotheos Evangelinidis when visiting this community. Metropolitan Timotheos was also to be instrumental in establishing the Greek Community in Townsville. In Brisbane the growing Greek community in the years prior to World War I made the first attempt to organise a community organisation with the formation of the Greek Association of Queensland in 1913. This Association had its headquarters in Adelaide Street, Brisbane, where members ran a coffee shop and discussion group, though little other information is known about it. As the Greek population grew further, so did the need for a Greek community centre to be instituted to cater for the community's social, religious and cultural needs. At a general meeting of the Association of Greeks in Queensland in 1921, the creation of a community centre was realised and the Greek Community of Queensland was formed. This meeting resolved that a proprietary company be established so that the purchase and management of a suitable property could be undertaken. Shortly after this company was able to purchase a building in Charlotte Street, Brisbane, which served as the Greek Community Centre until the 1970s. Before long, Hellenic House, as the building was named, became a household word throughout the Greek Community of Queensland, a Greek oasis, a place where a Greek could freely speak his language and not offend anyone. The newly established Greek Community of Queensland in 1922 soon had their own permanent priest, Father Maravelis, and a Greek School was also instituted. Regular Greek Orthodox services were held in the Church of England Churches of St Thomas' in South Brisbane, and St Luke's in Charlotte Street, Brisbane. The first Greek priest ordained in Brisbane was Elias Kotiathis in 1927, who succeeded Father Maravelis. The Brisbane Greek community was to truly come of age in 1929 with the opening of the first Greek Orthodox Church in Queensland, St Georges in Charlotte Street. The building set the seal on the work of the early pioneers and for a generation remained a centre of religious life for Queensland's Greeks. By the 1930s the Greek community in Brisbane developed further with the formation of the Kytherian Association in 1935, and a Greek newspaper, The Queensland Messenger, albeit short-lived, was launched in 1931. Outside of Brisbane in Biloela, where a large settlement of Rhodian cotton workers had established themselves, a Rhodian Fellowship was set up in 1931. While the second Greek Orthodox Church in Queensland was erected in Innisfail in 1935. This Church came as a result of the efforts of the local community who had already formed a Greek Brotherhood, which was renamed The Greek Orthodox Community of Innisfail and North Queensland in 1934. The Greek community of Queensland was also fortunate to have the services of a very active honorary consul residing in Brisbane, Christy Freeleagus. Freeleagus was appointed in 1919 and was to exert a major influence in the affairs of the Greek community of Queensland until his death in 1957. During one of the visits of Archbishop Timothios to Townsville in April 1944, one Greek resident, Thedoros Calagatis, offered His Grace ¬£1000 for the purpose of building a Greek Church in Townsville. As a result, Archbishop Timothios called a general meeting of all Townsville Greeks on Sunday 4 May 1944 to be held at the Cafe Beautiful. Approximately 65 people attended this meeting in which Archbishop Timothios was president, the chairman was Mr S. Nennas, and Mr George Keyatta, M.L.A., also presided: > The meeting ended at 1.30 a.m. and nearly ¬£3,000 was collected.

Laying of foundation stone for Sts.Theodores' Greek Orthodox Church, 1947 In approximately March 1945, a committee was elected at a general meeting with the power to acquire property and maintain the objects of the Greek Community of Townsville. This also included the commitment to build a church, priest's residence, and a community hall. Shortly afterwards a start was made to build a Greek Orthodox Church in Townsville when the granite foundation stone was laid in a ceremony performed by Archbishop Timothios, and attended by the Honorary Greek Consul Mr C. Freeleagus, on 16 March 1947. Also present was Mr A Stratigos, special envoy from Greece and Vice-President for the Greek- Australian Soldiers' League who six months earlier brought to Australia an urn containing earth from Australian soldiers' graves in Greece. By doing this, a 2600-year tradition was broken by which it was forbidden to send Greek soil to another country. This tradition was broken as a mark of admiration and esteem which the Greek Government holds towards Australia in sending men to help in the defence of Greek territory. The soil was presented to the then Prime Minister of Australia Mr Ben Chifley. The foundation Committee members responsible for the commencement of this church and the laying of the foundation stone were: > \\"Mr Theodoros Kalafatis, Great Benefactor and Honorary Chairman; Mr Michael > Leondarakis, President; Mr Emmanuel Atherinos, Vice President; Mr John > Manikaros, Secretary; Mr Spyridon Theo Nennas, Treasurer; Mr Charlie > Marendy; Mr George Kyriakakis; Mr Emmanuel Barboutis; Mr Michael N. > Bogiatzis, Members.\\" Townsville's Saints Theodores Church, the third Greek Orthodox Church built in Queensland, was designed by M.

The local Townsville firm of Gelling & Haig, a business which operated in Flinders Street (1931‚Äì1974), made the steelwork used in the construction of this Church. One history of Townsville produced several years after the official opening and dedication of Saints Theodores, describes the internal religious decoration and splendour that is visible within this Church: > \\"The interior of the church follows the Byzantine style of architecture; in > the congregation's section, graceful rounded columns merge into picturesque > arches to support a choir gallery; from this again rise columns and arches > which combine to produce a quintessence of reverend and artistic atmosphere. > The portion of the church allotted to the altar rises straight to the domed > roof in most effective fashion. The stranger, walking towards the altar, > automatically sweeps the eyes upwards to the dome, and the effect there is > startling and a trifle awe-inspiring-on the ceiling looms a painting of the > Christ, hands raised in benediction and gazing straight downwards.\\" The religious icons painted on the plaster of the dome were undertaken by artist Angelo Manolios, who was specially brought from Greece (from the Island of Lesvos) for the purpose. Manolios carried out this task over twelve months, lying on his back on scaffolding specially raised for the purpose. His outstanding work all across and around the altar depicts the teachings of the Orthodox Church. The first services held in Saints Theodores Church took place eleven months after the foundation stone ceremony (February 1948) while the Church was still under construction. The first parish priest was Father George Kateris who served Townsville's Greek community during 1946 to 1953. The first wedding to take place in this Church occurred on 19 September 1948 between Luke and Despo Lucas. Saints Theodores Church was officially opened and dedicated by Metropolitan Theophylactos Papathanasopoulos in June 1950. Four decades later, on Sunday 17 June 1990, Townsville's Greek Community celebrated the 40th anniversary of the official opening and dedication of their Church. On Sunday 30 March 1997, parishioners and guests of the Greek Orthodox Parish and Community of Saints Theodores Townsville celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Laying of the Foundation Stone of the Church. A service, followed by an Anniversary Dinner Dance was celebrated by parishioners in the presence of His Eminence Stylianos Harkianakis, Primate of the Greek Orthodox Church in Australia, the Consul General of Greece, the Consul General of Cyprus, as well as local, state and federal government representatives. One of the numerous congratulatory messages received at this time was from Mary Kalantzis, Professor of Education at the James Cook University, who summed up the importance of this Church to the local Greek Community: > The Church is a testimony to the important role the Greek Community has > played in this region. It has now stood for half a century, an impressive > reminder to all that the Greek Community is a part of the history of > economic and social development in Northern Australia. It is also living > evidence that loyal, contributing Australians can express faith in many > different ways and can hold dear different cultural traditions. Throughout its existence, Townsville's Saints Theodores Church has also been (and still continues to be) the central focus of activities contributing to the social and cultural aspects and well-being of Townsville's Greek Community. This includes the provision and fostering of an Ethnic Greek School, Greek Dancing School, Hellenic Youth Association, Greek Ladies' Auxiliary, Hellenic Senior Citizens, a Greek Orthodox Church Playgroup, and Debutante Balls through the Saints Theodores Parish of Townsville. The local Greek Community, as do many visitors, maintain that Townsville's Saints Theodores Church is the most beautiful Greek Orthodox Church in Australia.  Description  Saints Theodores Greek Orthodox Church fronts onto 654 Sturt Street, Townsville. This Church is a red brick building with a centrally located tower above the main entrance to Sturt Street. The roof of the tower and the dome above the altar are painted white, as are the window frames on the upper section of the tower. The Church's interior comprises the congregation's section, with a choir gallery above. The altar and side walls comprise a series of Greek Orthodox religious paintings and icons. Above the altar is a dome which depicts Christ with outstretched hands, as well as containing representations of the Apostles.

The recording was released in Australia in May 2015 and the rest of the world in June 2015. The album was distributed by Warner Music and is Lee's first release with Warner. Love Is the Great Rebellion marks a return to the pop sound of Ben Lee's previous work such as Awake Is the New Sleep and Ripe and is a change of direction from his previous release Ayahuasca: Welcome to the Work. Production In an interview with The Guardian to promote Love Is the Great Rebellion Lee discussed this move from his more recent work. \\"I thought it was going to be a natural progression from the Ayahuasca album,\\" he said. \\"I thought it was going to be something very obtuse and abstract and meditative but suddenly these pop songs started coming out. [...] And as I started exploring, I realised I still feel some degree of unfinished business with what the pop song can do, creatively. I don't feel entirely tapped out of the medium.\\" Critical reception Love Is the Great Rebellion received generally positive reviews. Lee Zimmerman of PopMatters praised the album's cohesiveness, stating \\"...it holds together remarkably well as a unified, complete concept, a series of songs conveying like a zen-like mantra and philosophical thoughts on life, love, God and related subjects of similar consequence.\\" Danelle Cloutier of Exclaim! recommended the album and also commended Lee's ability to explore deeper philosophical themes through pop music. Dan F. Stapleton of Rolling Stone Australia described listening to the album as pleasant but lamented that it lacked \\"grit\\".

Commenting on the movement away from these rigid and artificial design trends, Susannah Hagan, in her book Taking Shape, has this to say: \\"The oppositions between culture and nature, so importantly and brutally drawn up by modernism, are dissolving again, not in a return to what was, but a transformation of it...The division between the living organism and the machine continues to collapse.\\" Famous works Oriental Milwaukee Art Museum Some well-known examples of zoomorphic architecture can be found in the TWA Flight Center building in New York City, by Eero Saarinen, or the Milwaukee Art Museum by Santiago Calatrava, both inspired by the form of a bird‚Äôs wings.

The purpose of the centre is to increase knowledge and understanding of how people and cities interact in a rapidly urbanising world, focusing on how the physical form and design of cities impacts on society, culture and the environment; and educate and train new generations of researchers and executives through its postgraduate and executive programmes. The 13-year old Urban Age project is the centre's major outreach component. This international investigation of how the physical and social are interconnected in cities has held conferences in 13 cities across four continents, including Delhi, Rio de Janeiro, London, Hong Kong, Istanbul, S√£o Paulo, Mumbai, Mexico City, Johannesburg, Berlin, Shanghai and New York City. In 2010 the conference, which investigated the economic health of cities post- recession, was co-hosted with Brookings Institution in Chicago. In 2016, the conference was hosted as part of the 15th International Architecture Exhibition in Venice and the forthcoming conference is expected to take place in Addis Ababa in November 2018. Urban Age is jointly organised with Deutsche Bank‚Äôs Alfred Herrhausen Gesellschaft. The centre's main research activities are divided into three research units: :1. Cities, Space and Society :2. Cities and the Environment :3. Urban Governance Ricky Burdett is the director of LSE Cities. Philipp Rode acts as the executive director.  Education  The centre offers MSc, PhD and executive education. The MSc in City Design and Social Science is unique within the LSE as it has a practical, studio-based component. An 18-month part time Executive MSc in Cities for working professionals is also available as of 2016. Urban Age and Bloomberg Philanthropies scholarships provide financial support to applicants. The centre has offered a one-week Executive Education short course since 2014 on \\"London and Global Cities - Governance, Planning and Design\\".  Events and exhibitions  LSE Cities regularly organises a range of events, including public lectures, seminars, workshops and exhibitions in London and internationally. In November and December 2015, the centre collaborated with Guardian Cities for the \\"Urban Age 10 Global Debates\\", which included five public events on issues such as social equity and designing urban infrastructure, accompanied by articles published in the Guardian. Participants included sociologist Saskia Sassen, writer Suketu Mehta, architects Norman Foster and Alejandro Aravena, as well as the Executive Director of UN Habitat, Joan Clos. The centre has also co-led the organisation of several events, such as the 2015 Disrupting Mobility Summit in Cambridge, MA, along with MIT Media Lab, U.C. Berkeley‚Äôs Transportation Sustainability Research Center (TSRC) and the Berlin Social Science Centre. It also co-ledia policy unit on urban governance, capacity and institutional development in preparation for the October 2016 Habitat III conference in Quito, Ecuador as well as one of three Urban Talks, which were central to the official programme. In 2016, the Urban Age programme presented one of the three Special Projects featured at the 15th International Architecture Exhibition realised by La Biennale di Venezia. Titled Conflicts of an Urban Age, the exhibition examined global urban trends from 1990-2015 and asked how the world can accommodate five billion urban dwellers by 2030. In 2017, a version of the exhibition travelled to Berlin and the 2017 Seoul Biennale of Architecture and Urbanism. In Seoul, the exhibition was renamed Dynamics of the Urban Age.  Research and key publications  A variety of publications have been produced by LSE Cities. The centre's Urban Age project has led to the publication of two books edited by Ricky Burdett and Deyan Sudjic: The Endless City (2008) and Living in the Endless City (2011). A third book in the series, Shaping Cities in an Urban Age, is expected in 2018. These books address the broad themes discussed at Urban Age conferences, produce data on various economic, social and environmental indicators and provide more detailed chapters on specific cities. The centre has also published several reports, such as Going Green: How cities are leading the next economy (2013), the product of a survey of 90 city governments with the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) and ICLEI ‚Äì local governments for sustainability. Other reports have addressed issues ranging from transport and mobility, to cities and energy, including leading the cities research for the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, and the prospects for technological innovation in urban environments. Recent reports include Towards Urban Growth Analytics for Yangon and Resource Urbanisms: Asia‚Äôs divergent city models of Kuwait, Abu Dhabi, Singapore and Hong Kong. Several academic articles by LSE Cities researchers and directors have also been published. The Ordinary Streets project led by Suzanne Hall has produced a number ethnographic and sociological studies on diversity, migration and urban adaptation. It has also been captured in a short film looking at the inner workings of life and local business on Peckham's Rye Lane and has led to a ¬£100,000 Philip Leverhulme Prize for the work to be extended into South Africa. The findings of the Urban Uncertainty Project, coordinated by Sobia Ahmad Kaker and Austin Zeiderman, have similarly been presented in various academic journals and reports. The Urban Governance research unit has also produced the New Urban Governance project, co-funded by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, which features the urban governance survey, developed along with UN Habitat and United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG), aiming to redress the lack of empirical research on the functioning and capacity of local and city governments worldwide. The project includes a dedicated website which was shortlisted for a KANTAR Information is Beautiful Award and included in a book detailing how data visualisation will impact on scholarly, academic, cultural, social, and political spheres.  Awards and achievements  The Queen's Anniversary Prize for 2016-2018 was awarded in recognition of LSE Cities‚Äô work on ‚Äòtraining, research and policy formulation for cities of the future and a new generation of urban leaders around the world.‚Äô In the 2018 New Year Honours, Professor Richard Sennett was awarded an OBE for services to design. Sennett Chair of the Advisory Board at LSE Cities and contributed to founding the Urban Age. In the 2017 New Year Honours, Professor Ricky Burdett was appointed a CBE for services to urban planning and design. Burdett is the Director of LSE Cities and the Urban Age. Suzanne Hall, Director of the Cities Programme, won a Philip Leverhulme Prize (2017) to extend her Ordinary Streets project on how migrants inhabit the city to Cape Town, South Africa. Hall also won LSE Teaching Prize in 2017.

Geography The mound is situated in the rural area of Mut at close to road connecting Turkish state way to G√ºlnar. Its distance to Mut is and to Mersin is . It is just west of the G√∂ksu River (Calycadnus of the antiquity). History The earliest settlement is dated to third Millennium BC. During the Hittite Empire era, it was used to control the road between the Hittite lands in Central Anatolia and the Mediterranean ports. Mersin √ñren Yerleri Kaleleri M√ºzeleri , p 325 At the end of the 13th Century BC, the settlement was burnt down, like much of Anatolia at the time. In its wake, a reconstruction began, but this too was destroyed in the middle of the 12th Century BC. Mycenaean LHIIIC pottery from Cyprus and Crete was found in this layer, dating from 1200 to 1150 BC. Settlement continued during the Hellenistic period, but there is no indication of a settlement during the Roman period. The ruined church is an early 5th century Byzantine church.

While with the Peace Corps, she taught English for two years in the early 1960s in Togo.Robert Moran, \\"Peggy Anderson, 77, Author of Bestseller Nurse\\", Philadelphia Inquirer, Jan. 18, 2016. After her time in the Peace Corps, she worked as a reporter at The Washington Monthly and The Philadelphia Inquirer (from 1969-1973). She wrote three well-known books: The Daughters (1972), about the Daughters of the American Revolution; Nurse (1979); and Children's Hospital (1985). Nurse was a major best-seller. The book was an account of the working life of a nurse, based on an pseudonymized series of interviews with a 27-year-old nurse named Philadelphia. The book was made into a movie and a TV seriesMary Vespa, \\"A Woman in White Finds a Gentle Biographer in Peggy Anderson, and Now 'Nurse' Heads for TV\\", People Magazine, April 14, 1980, v. 13, n.15. starring Michael Learned, which won an Emmy award. It was suggested that she title the book \\"Scar Wars\\" (playing on the recent popularity of the film \\"Star Wars\\"), but Anderson stuck with the less sensationalistic title Nurse. The nurse, nicknamed \\"Mary Benjamin\\" in the book, at the time insisted on her anonymity, and \\"steadfastly protected her identity\\". She was later identified as Mary Fish and became a lifelong friend of Anderson's. For the book, Fish received $2,000 and 5% of profits from the book, for meeting with Anderson for 60 interviews, of two to six hours each. Anderson's 1972 book The Daughters \\"was a critical success and financial flop\\", providing her only a $2,500 advance. Anderson also had two incomplete manuscripts, one about the murder of her father in Chicago, and another about hospice nursing.

History  The oldest mention about the castle of San Pio delle Camere date back to 1173, indicating it as a fief of the Barons of Poppleto (nowadays Coppito), later becoming a fief of the House of Caracciolo. Placed above the town of San Pio delle Camere, the role of the castle was to provide shelter for people and their livestock in time of danger. The current state of the castle was the result of the attack brought in 1424 by the condottiero Braccio da Montone, involving also the castle of Barisciano.  Architecture  The structure of the castle is an enclosure, with its building that took place in two stages, the first one with the construction of the tower and the second one with the walls. The tower's plan is formed by a square and an equilateral triangle. The plan of the walls is triangular, with the tower at the top and other smaller towers along the walls. The structure of the castle has been revised several times, as shown, for example, by the raising of the walls, that probably took place in the 14th century.

He was investigated by the Communist Party of China's anti-graft agency in January 2016 and expelled from the party a few months later. He served as Communist Party Secretary of Luoyang, the top political position in the city, from July 2013 to January 2016. He is a member of the Henan Provincial Party Standing Committee. Early career Chen was born in a rural village in Qi County, Kaifeng, Henan, in September 1958. His mother died when he was just two years old; he was raised by his father and often foraged for food from his neighbours. His family was so poor that they did not have the money to cover the expenses of burial for his deceased mother. Chen's father served in the army for famed general Peng Xuefeng, a famed pre-revolution general of Mao's Red Army. Chen's father named him after General Peng. Chen had outstanding grades in school, eventually earning himself admission to the China University of Mining and Technology shortly after the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976. He majored in coal processing. Chen began working in October 1975, and joined the Communist Party of China in November 1985. In 1982, shortly after graduating, Chen was selected to work in the mines of Yima, Henan. There he rose steadily up its ranks, eventually overseeing the mine's operations. The Yima Coal Bureau was re-organized into the Yimei Group (), and Chen served as one of its executives. From July 2000 to November 2008, he was general manager, president, and party chief of Yongcheng Coal and Electric Power Group Corp (). Then he served as president and party chief of Henan Coal Chemical Industry Group Co., Ltd (), and held that office until January 2011. In January 2011 he was promoted to become vice-governor of Henan, he remained in that position until July 2013, when he was transferred to Luoyang and appointed the Communist Party Secretary. Luoyang In Luoyang, Chen spearheaded massive projects, many of which were abandoned. Luoyang's Luopu Park was thoroughly revamped but the project was never completed. These projects earned Chen the nickname Chen Yiban (literally, \\"Chen one half\\") among locals. However, Chen also contributed to Luoyang's economic development, bringing the city from a laggard in economic growth statistics in the province back to a 9% growth rate by the time he was removed from office. In 2014, his subordinate, then Luoyang vice-mayor Guo Yipin was captured by police after going into hiding as a result of a corruption investigation. Chen was also the subject of reports of misconduct submitted to the authorities, and rumours of his downfall began circulating as early as 2014. On January 15, 2016, Chen was taking part in an economic conference when he was surrounded by investigative personnel and taken away for investigation. The events took place so suddenly that much of the conference's agenda had to be changed following Chen being taken into custody. The investigation was announced by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection on January 16, as Chen emerged as the first \\"tiger\\" of 2016 in the anti-corruption campaign in China which began after the 18th Party Congress. He was expelled from the Communist Party on June 2, 2016 for violated Eight-point Regulation, membership in private clubs, falsifying age and bribery. Chen was sentenced to life in prison for taking bribes worth 125 million yuan, plundering the public fund worth 5.47 million yuan and abusing of power on May 31, 2017. He was a member of the 11th National People's Congress.

Some authors confirm that he was born in Chiquinquir√°, Boyac√°. He lived a major part of his life in Mexico. He married Ana Krauss in Czechoslovakia and had three children: R√≥mulo, Gloria and Leticia. His second wife was Manuela Vera, yucateca, with whom he had two children: Marco Antonio and Gloria Antonia. Rozo is best known for his internationally recognized sculpture, Bachu√©, which influenced a generation of Colombian artists. Studies Rozo completed his studies at the National School of Fine Arts, Central Technical Institute of Bogota. While he traveled through Europe between the years 1924 and 1929, he studied at the Saint Fernando Academy of Fine Arts in Madrid. He then completed his studies in Paris, France, with Antoine Bourdelle, who exerted a major influence on his works. He participated in the Ibero-American Exposition of 1929 in Seville, where he won the Big Prize and the Medal of Gold, before returning to the Americas. Bachu√© and Seville A statue in a traffic rotary on the Paseo De Montejo, M√©rida, Yucat√°n Sculpture of R√≥mulo Rozo Thought In 1925, Rozo made one of his most renowned works, the Bachu√© goddess generatriz of the chibchas, a granite sculpture inspired by Colombian and pre-Columbian mythology. The work is a reference to the goddess Bachu√©, mother of the Muisca civilisation in their mythology. The response of the international press to Bachu√© and Rozo's other works raised the sculptor to greater recognition. He mixed his academic knowledge of western art with elements of his own Latin American culture and native cultures of Asia and Africa, references he drew from the collections of the Louvre and museums of Trocad√©ro.AA. Admiration of Rozo's works was so great as to inspire a 1930 ephemeral literary movement in Colombia called \\"The Bachu√©s\\", which advocated the review of the vernacular roots for the creation of a common people's art, in opposition to academic art.Padilla, Christian. The continuity of this influence among the sculptors of this generation (such as Luis Alberto Acu√±a, Ignacio G√≥mez Jaramillo, Pedro Nel G√≥mez, Ram√≥n Barba, Jos√© Domingo Rodr√≠guez, Hena Rodr√≠guez, Miguel Sop√≥ and Rodrigo Arenas Betancourt) signal the Bachu√© as the foundational sculpture of modern art in Colombia. Colombian Pavilion at the Exhibition Iberoamerican of Sevilla. 1928-1929. Ornamentation of R√≥mulo Rozo. Colombian Pavilion at the Exhibition Iberoamerican of Sevilla. Romulo Rozo developed the Sculptural pavilion (1929). For the Ibero-American Exposition of 1929 in Seville, the Colombian government hired Rozo to make the ornamentation for the Colombian Pavilion. Rozo reformed Spanish architect Jos√© Granados' original idea, which did allusion to a baroque church, turning it instead into a temple with an ornamental reference to the Chibchas gods of the Colombian prehispanic territory. Rozo convinced the collector of the Bachu√© to loan the work, so it could be placed in the middle of the pavilion during the year that the event lasted. Around it, Rozo created figures in plaster and concrete, with clear referents to the cultures of Tolima, Saint Agust√≠n, Muiscas and the Mayas. The finished result of the installation was an odd beauty between the conjunction of religious architecture with a decoration based in pre-Columbian civilisations. Again, the international press concluded it to be an unprecedented success for the sculptor. Rozo decided not to return to Colombia, moving permanently to Mexico in 1931. In spite of the great influence of the Bachu√© in the nationalist generation of artists in Colombia, the work disappeared after its exhibition in Seville. Only in 1998 (68 years after) was it found by art historian √Ålvaro Medina, and returned to Colombia for the exhibition \\"Colombia in the threshold of the modernity\\", curated by the same researcher. During the time the work was missing, a new wave of young artists and the media power of the Argentinian art critic Marta Traba overshadowed the contributions of this generation, condemning it to a second place in the history of Colombian art that was only reassessed since its reappearance. In spite of its historical value, no cultural institution in Colombia showed interest in purchasing it. However, the work became part of the collection of the Foundation Project Bachu√©, a platform interested in the conservation and gathering of Colombian art.

It is one of twenty Yoga Upanishads in the four Vedas, and it is attached to the Samaveda.Alain Dani√©lou (1991), Yoga, Inner Traditions, , page 167 The text presents classical Yoga similar to the Patanjali's Yogasutras-style format in a sequential ascending eight yogic stages, but unlike Yogasutras, the Darshana Upanishad includes kundalini concepts. The ultimate goal of Yoga, states the Upanishad, is self-knowledge and realizing the identity of one's soul (Atman) with the universal reality (Brahman). History Gavin Flood dates the text to around 100 BCE to 300 CE. Georg Feuerstein suggests the text probably post- dates the Yogasutras.Georg Feuerstein (1990), Encyclopedia Dictionary of Yoga, Shambala, , page 418 This Upanishad is also referred to as Yoga Darshana Upanishad, Jabala Darshana Upanishad, JƒÅbƒÅladar·π£ana Upanishad,, The British Museum, page 920 and Dar≈õanopani·π£ad (‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§∂‡§®‡•ã‡§™‡§®‡§ø‡§∑‡§§‡•ç). It is listed at number 90 in the serial order of the Muktika enumerated by Rama to Hanuman in the modern era anthology of 108 Upanishads. Contents The Upanishad is structured into ten sections (or chapters) of unequal length with two hundred and nine verses. The text is structured as a discourse by Hindu god Dattatreya to sage Sankriti on Yoga. The text presents a fusion of Hatha Yoga and eight limbed Patanjali Yogasutras methodology, on a foundation of Vedanta and Yoga philosophies. The first and second chapters describe ethics of a Yogi, as necessary for success in Yoga. Many asanas (yogic postures) are mentioned, and nine explained in chapter 3. Chapter 4 asserts that god (Shiva) is within the temple of one's body, and the best pilgrimage is something one can make daily to this inner world. Some subsections in chapter 5 discuss its theory of blood vessels and inner energy flows, along with techniques for inner cleansing. One of the largest chapters is dedicated to breathing exercises, while the last four chapters describe steps for concentration, introspection, meditation, self- knowledge and ultimately union of the soul (Atman) with the Absolute Reality (Brahman). The first chapter of the Upanishad has 25 verses describing the Yamas or virtuous restraints; the second chapter with 16 verses lists the Niyamas or virtuous disciplines; the third chapter's 13 verses gives explanation on the yogic Asanas or exercise postures; while the fourth chapter, which is the longest, has 63 verses on its theory of the human body, the nadis or the blood vessels. The fifth chapter's 14 verses is a further elaboration on the previous section giving detailed procedure for inner cleansing or purification; the sixth chapter with 51 verses elaborates on Pranayama or breath exercises; the seventh chapter through its 14 verses explains Pratyahara or the ability to withdrawal senses from the external world; the eighth chapter with nine verses on concentration or Dharana; the ninth chapter has six verses describing meditation or Dhyana; and the last chapter in its 12 slokas deals with the samadhi stage of yoga which is attained when the Yogin realizes \\"the Atman (soul) is identical with Brahman\\". The text enunciates esoteric theories comparing the human body and blood veins with the terrestrial features of the earth such as river channels with their sacred fjords. The text is notable for presenting its ideas inclusively with some sections opening or closing with praises for Hindu gods Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma, Dattatreya or Shakti Devis, but the core of text is techniques discussed in nontheistic terminology and Vedantic. The axiology in the text includes a discussion of the value of Yamas and Niyamas, such as non-violence, truthfulness, compassion, abstinence from anger, temperance in food (Mitahara), among others. The text details yogic postures such as Svastikasana, Gomukhasana, Padmasana, Virasana, Simhasana, Bhadrasana, Muktasana, Mayurasana and Sukhasana. These Asanas are discussed in various breathing and cleansing exercises in later sections. The Upanishad thereafter proceeds to presenting its Vedantic ideas on meditation and nondualism, stating its premise in verse 7.13-7.14, that the Yogin should ascertain his Atman (soul) in the \\"nondual, cosmic Atman\\" (Brahman, unchanging, ultimate reality).

Early life Cornelia James was born Cornelia Katz in Vienna on 11 March 1917, the eldest of seven children of a family who ran a chain of grocery shops and a cold storage business. She left Vienna in 1939, immediately after having finished studying fashion design at the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts (the same college that rejected Adolf Hitler). She left for Paris and then London, with \\"a suitcase full of the coloured leather\\". Career Katz arrived in London a refugee but soon set up in business making gloves. In 1947, she was asked by the dress designer Norman Hartnell to make the \\"going-away\\" gloves for the then Princess Elizabeth to take on her honeymoon, following her impending marriage to Prince Philip, and she made several pairs for the Princess's trousseau. Thus began her long association with the British royal family. Fellow royal couturier Hardy Amies also appreciated her colourful designs. In 1948, she became known as \\"the Colour Queen of England\\" after launching her leather gloves range in 100 different shades. Her first workshop was on Davigdor Road in Hove, near Brighton, and was established by 1947. The business peaked in the 1950s, when she was known as \\"the Queen's favourite glovemaker\\" and had between 250 and 500 workers in her factory in a former dairy in Brighton; but the popularity of wearing fashion gloves declined.

In December 2000, human remains were discovered at a Panamanian National Guard base, incorrectly believed to be those of Jes√∫s H√©ctor Gallego Herrera, a priest murdered during the Torrijos dictatorship. Moscoso appointed a truth commission to investigate the site and those at other bases.Harding 2006, p.131 The commission faced opposition from the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), which had been the party of both Torrijos and Noriega. The PRD-controlled National Assembly slashed the commission's funding, and PRD president Balbina Herrera threatened to seek legal action against the president for its creation. The commission ultimately reported on 110 of the 148 cases it examined, of which 40 had disappeared and 70 were known to be murdered. The report concluded that the Noriega government had engaged in \\"torture [and] cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment\\", and recommended further exhumation and investigation.  Background  In 1981, General Omar Torrijos was killed in a plane crash and his defense force leader General Manuel Noriega took power. During this period the United States still controlled the Canal Zone and had immense influence in various areas of the country (including economic influence). Six years into Noriega‚Äôs rule, the United States decided to cut its economic assistance to Panama. In 1989, Noriega influenced the election a great deal since most Panamanians wanted to rid the country of military rule. This led to riots and instability, which caused the United States to send in troops. The US responded quickly to these riots and were able to use military force to crush the riots and rebellions. This was due to US-Panamanian treaties involving the Canal Zone. The result of US military involvement led to the arrest of Noriega. He was sentenced for forty-years on charges for drug trafficking. Finally in 2001, President Mireya Moscoso ‚Äì widow to former President Arnulfo Arias Madrid ‚Äì established the truth commission after the discovery of bones at several military bases. = Noriega, The Dictator = The reasoning behind the Panamanian Truth commission was to hold the dictator General Manuel Antonio Noriega accountable for his abuses of human rights as well as his involvement in drug trafficking and money laundering. Some Panamanians believe that the United States should be held responsible for Noriega‚Äôs regime and that they should be liable for the outcomes of the Panama Truth Commission. The US involvement with Noriega began in the early 1970s when he became involved with US Intelligence activities. One event in 1971 had President Richard Nixon requesting that Noriega travel to Havana, Cuba on behalf of the US to obtain two American ships that had been seized by Fidel Castro's government. During this time Noriega was already involved in drug deals and drug trafficking and President Nixon received a recommendation from a high ranking drug-officer to have Noriega assassinated rather than working with him. The assassination never occurred and Noriega through his blossoming career became the second most powerful man by 1975 through leading the G-2 (Panama's military intelligence command). From the late 1970s to the early 1980s, Noriega served US interests quite effectively. His service was seen in the form of asylum in Panama for the Shah of Iran in 1979 and also aiding in destabilizing the Sandinista government in Nicaragua in 1983. The involvement with the US benefited Noriega equally when in 1981 General Omar Torrijos was involved in an unexplained plane crash. It is alleged that Noriega used his connection with the US to engineer General Torrijos' death through the support of the C.I.A. (Central Intelligence Agency). After the death of General Torrijos his seat of power was fought for by both politicians and military officers. This struggle for power was eventually won by Noriega. After taking total control Noriega was promoted to General and Commander of the National Guard. He decided in 1983 to amalgamate both the Navy and the Air Force which would establish the Panama Defence Forces ‚Äì this included the national police. The following year the dictatorial regime, due to a previous agreement with the United States before signing the Canal Treaties held a national election to appoint a president. His nomination was Nicolas Arditos Barletta, who ran against Arnulfo Arias. Barletta narrowly won, promising to help improve the country's economy. When Barletta failed to do so, Noriega forced him out of power. At the time of this election Noriega was suspected of money laundering, gun trafficking, torture, murder and selling US intelligence to Cuba and Easter European governments. When approached by the US, Noriega denied all allegations and blaming US politicians of trying to undermine the Panama Canal treaties before its return to Panamanian control in December 1999. Noriega's support began to decline in 1987 when his former chief of staff stated that Noriega had fixed the 1984 elections and had Hugo Spadafora ‚Äì a critic of Noriega's drug trafficking- ordered to be killed. When this became public knowledge, Panamanians began to protest the removal of Noriega. His response to these protests was to declare a national emergency, which suspended all constitutional rights, close newspapers and radio stations and exile his political enemies. Even though Noriega had connections with the United States, they always remained distant from Noriega's government. This all took a sudden turn in 1988 when the US decided to become more directly involved in Panama. = United States involvement = By mid-1987, the United States government decided that Noriega was becoming too powerful and damaging for the Panamanian society. Under President Ronald Reagan's administration, the US terminated all economic and military assistance and encouraged Panamanian bankers to cut support funding as well. The only support left for Noriega was the Panama Defence Force. The US also suggested that Noriega resign and depart Panama before the US elections of 1988. In addition to these suggestions, the US Justice Department began filling charges against Noriega as a warning. The US even sent Assistant Secretary of State Elliot Abrams to Panama to discuss plans with President Eric Del Valle to fire Noriega. Noriega's response was to depose Del Valle. In 1989, now under President George Bush (who was the director of the C.I.A. when Noriega became involved with the US), began to increase pressure on Noriega. This pressure was visible when a Panamanian election was called and Noriega decided not to run but instead endorsed candidate Carlos Duque. The opposition chose Guillermo Endara and he was endorsed with $10 million by the Bush administration. During this election, Noriega found that Duque was losing and commanded the Panama Defence Force to confiscate ballot boxes. Noriega declared this election void and appointed another president. The US began to worry greatly given that control of the Panama Canal was going to be handed over in ten years time. They did not want to see one of Noriega's men as administrator of the Canal, not only for the country but also for the Panamanian image internationally. After the contested election, President Bush sent in US forces to overthrow Noriega on the grounds that hostile acts were performed against US military personnel. Noriega declared a state of war and the US launched an attack called \\"Operation Just Cause\\" with 24,000 troops. The fighting lasted several days and Noriega hid at the Papal Nunciature office during this time. Finally, after pressure from Vatican officials Noriega surrendered in January 1990.  The Commission = Mandate and structure = The Truth Commission in Panama was called the Comisi√≥n de la Verdad de Panam√° (Panama Truth Commission). It was established on January 18, 2001 by President Mireya Moscoso with a mandate to investigate human rights violations between 1968 and 1989, the years of rule by Torrijos and Noriega. The commission was barred from making any conclusions on legal responsibilities of individual perpetrators. The commission was made up of seven commissioners (five men and two women). It was led by Alberto Santiago Almanza Henr√≠quez, a lawyer and Catholic activist. All commissioners were appointed by President Moscoso. The commission last for a year and three months and came to an end in April 2002 when the Final Report (Informe Final de la Comisi√≥n de la Verdad de Panam√°) was presented. A follow up office operated until December 2004. = Findings = According to the commission's findings, the military regime was involved in torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of victims. There had been 148 cases of human rights abuse. Out of those, 110 were reported and documented. The cases took place during the first years of the military regime (1968‚Äì1972) against supporters of the former President Arias. It was discovered that seventy of the victims had been murdered, forty had disappeared and that another forty cases were yet to be investigated. A major aspect of the commission's work was investigating clandestine grave sites, establishing the identity of victims and determining the circumstances of their deaths. Through this investigation, the commission discovered twenty-four grave sites and excavated thirty-six graves. These sites were located at military establishments throughout the provinces of Panama and Bosca del Toro and at the prison on Coiba Island. Other sites included the Tocumen military airport, the houses occupied by Panamanian Air Force pilots, the old Los Pumas infantry barracks and firing range in Tocumen, the old cavalry base in Panama Viejo, the Joyita prison in Pacova and at houses used by secret police and other security units used for interrogation and torture. The discovery of the body of Colombian priest Jose Hector Gallego, who had been abducted by the military in 1971, is what initiated the Truth Commission. Other well-known people that were found to be victims of torture included Dora Moreno, Hip√≥lito Quintero, Floyd Britton, Encarnaci√≥n Gonz√°lez and Hugo Spadofora. The final conclusion that was made by the commission was that \\"the military regime had engaged in 'torture [and] cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment' of its victims.\\" = Recommendations, reforms & prosecutions = The recommendations made by the commission to the President were as follows: # To continue systematic excavations of suspected grave sites. # To reactivate the Special Prosecutor office as a way to take legal action against those who performed the atrocities. # That the government accept the obligations of international law relating to human rights by compensating the families of victims. # To create a permanent government agency that would continue the work of the commission as a way to maintain their files. # To have strict civilian control of the National police and other internal public security forces. # To improve human rights education in schools. # To put vigorous effort into disseminating the commission's report. A follow-up committee for the commission's work was created. It was decided by executive decree on October 20, 2003 that the truth commission was to be extended until December 2004. This follow-up commission was called the Office for Follow-up of the Institutional Truth Commission or Comisi√≥n Institucional de la Verdad-Oficina de Seguimiento. This office would report to the President and the Minister of Justice. Towards the end of the commission's existence, the office experienced a break-in upon its completion of the report. It is believed that the thief was trying to destroy any and all records, to make them unavailable to public access. This commission also experienced obstacles like budgetary restraints which affected its efforts to pay reparations, and the commission was unable to answer questions concerning the victims of the 1989 United States invasion. The Panamanian government has demanded that Washington declassify information that would be relevant to the US invasion, Operation Just Cause. These types of files have proven to be invaluable when understanding dictatorships in other countries like El Salvador, Chile and Guatemala and the role that the US played in backing them. The persecutions that have been made are directed at General Noriega and come from various countries. He was first charged in 1992 was for drug trafficking by the United States and sentenced to forty years imprisonment. This sentence was eventually reduced to twenty years. Following this sentence in 1995, Panamanian courts found Noriega to be guilty of murder during his dictatorship. This sentence encouraged Panama to demand Noriega be extradited from the US to complete his persecution time on his national soil; this demand was declined by the US. In April 2010, the US decided to extradite Noriega to France where he was charged for money laundering, convicted in 1999, and sentenced to serve thirty years. The President at the time, Martin Torrijos ‚Äì General Torrijos' son ‚Äì called for Noriega's extradition to Panama.  Legacy  As a way to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary President Juan Carlos Varela announced the creation of a commission to investigate the deaths and disappearances during Operation Just Cause. This commission's goal is to \\"heal the wounds, and promote national reconciliation.\\" The Panamanian government is demanding Washington recognize the invasion, provide compensation to the country and proclaim the grave sites where hundreds of Panamanians were buried. President Varela also announced that December 20 would be a day of national mourning for the victims.

It is located at 3 Reservoir Street in the town center. Built in 1863, it is a remarkably sophisticated example of Italianate architecture for a relatively small town, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986 for its architecture. Description and history Union Hall is located in the village center of Searsport, on the east side of Reservoir Street a short way north of United States Route 1. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboard siding. The ground floor is relatively low, housing town offices, while the upper level is tall, housing the auditorium space. The building has quoined corners, bracketed eaves, and entrances on the short ends that are flanked by pilasters. Ground floor windows are rectangular sash, while the upper floor windows are mainly very tall round-arch windows. On the ends there are paired segmented-arch windows in the gables. The building originally had a cupola. Its interior has modest but high quality woodwork, most of it original. The hall was designed by Portland architect George M. Harding, and was built in 1863, at the height of the American Civil War. It is one of Maine's more imposing small-town town halls. In addition to the loss of the cupola, other minor alterations include the loss of a balcony on one end, and the provision of a fire escape door on the western end.

The performance was part of a concert staged by the Dance Repertory Theatre, a group that included dancer/choreographers Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and Helen Tamiris. Their stated goal was \\"to give annually a season of continuous dance programs which will be representative of the art of dance in America and will give native artists an outlet for their creative work.\\"Lamentation (Ballet choreographed by Martha Graham), Performing Arts Encyclopedia, Library of Congress, http://memory.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/loc.natlib.ihas.200182679/default.html  Theme and structure  In program notes, Lamentation was subtitled Dance of Sorrow, \\"not the sorrow of specific person, time or place but the personification of grief itself.\\"Anna Kisselgoff, Dance; Powerful Emotions Distilled, The New York Times, September 13, 2001 https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/13/arts/dance-powerful-emotions-distilled.html The ballet is less than four minutes in length. It opens on a set containing a single low bench upon which the soloist sits, feet and lower legs in a wide second position. She wears a loose purple tube-like garment from which only her head, hands and feet protrude. Graham said of the costume, \\"I wear a long tube of material to indicate the tragedy that obsesses the body, the ability to stretch inside your own skin, to witness and test the perimeters and boundaries of grief.\\"Martha Graham, Blood Memory: An Autobiography, Washington Square Press, October 1992, p. 117 As the piece begins, the dancer shakes her head gently from side to side in silence. After cueing the music with a movement of her foot, she rocks and twists her upper body, swinging through deep contractions. The angular motions of torso, head and arms become increasingly exaggerated, shaping the jersey costume into squares, triangles and rhomboids that frame her emotionless face and a portion of her chest. Seemingly anchored to the bench, she ultimately struggles to an upright position. In a final gesture, she clutches the upper edge of her costume in an upraised fist, stretching the fabric tautly over her head and face. She sinks once again to a seated position and drops her head between her knees in resignation.Lamentation - Martha Graham https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf3xgbKYko  Critical reception  Lamentation has been praised highly since its premiere. In 1930, the critic for Dance Magazine described the work as \\"a statuesque composition, which relied for much of its eloquence upon an ingenious and simple costume arrangement.\\" After seeing a later performance, the Philadelphia Record's critic wrote, \\"When Miss Graham in her Lamentation depicts the dumb agony of grief she does not droop like a flower or attitudinize like Patience on a monument, she is grief from the first stricken bewildered gropings of her head and torso to the last moment when she averts her covered head with a finality that is pitiful and terrible.\\"  Critical analysis  Graham, her followers and critics have discussed Lamentation at length. It is one of the last dances made during what Graham referred to as her \\"long woolens\\" period, early works for which she costumed herself and female troupe members in stretch jersey.Anna Kisselgoff, Martha Graham Dies at 96; A Revolutionary in Dance, The New York Times, April 2, 1991 https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0511.html Graham scholars place the piece within her oeuvre of psychological expressionist balletsHelen Thomas, Dance, Modernity and Culture, Routledge, September 2, 2003, p. 118 alongside Errand into the Maze, Night Journey, Dark Meadow and others.Daniel Belgrad, The Culture of Spontaneity: Improvisation and the Arts in Postwar America, University of Chicago Press, Oct 1, 1999, p. 158 Lamentation has been characterized as a total break with the conventions of dance at the time. Critic Marcia Siegel wrote, \\"Our idea of dancing includes some picture of a person on his feet.\\" Not only is the work performed sitting down, the soloist is shrouded in constraining garb that not only limits her movements, but also hides her body from the audience. \\"What she achieved by restricting herself in this fashion was an unnaturally intense concentration on the body's dynamics.\\"It's not just that she makes herself into an odd shape, but the minute she starts to move, the tube gets pulled into diagonals that cross the center of her body; as she tugs asymmetrically in opposition to the rounded forms of her back, her head, her arching rib cage, the jersey converts the energy of stress and distortion into visible shapes and lines.\\"Marcia B. Siegel, The Shapes of Change: Images of American Dance, University of California Press, 1979, p. 38-39 Graham's inspiration for the piece reportedly came from the Old Testament Book of Lamentations, which begins \\"How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! How is she become as a widow.\\"Rhonda K. Garelick, Electric Salome: Loie Fuller's Performance of Modernism, Princeton University Press, 2007, p. 190 The work may also include New Testament references. The lone shrouded female figure bathed in blue stage lighting has been interpreted as a holy person, perhaps the Virgin Mary as Mater Dolorosa. To dance writer Helen Thomas, the solo has a maternal quality that suggests \\"the struggle of birth\\" for both mother and child. As the dancer rocks and twists with knees apart, her arms and legs strain against the fabric to resemble fetal movement within a pregnant belly. She \\"is also the child being born: her limbs are encased in an elastic sheath; they push and stretch outward, straining toward release, with only the head visible.\\"  Performance history  Lamentation is one of a handful of early works that have remained in the Martha Graham Dance Company repertoire. Troupe members who have appeared in the piece include Peggy Lyman, Janet Eilber, Terese Capucilli and Katherine Crockett. Films of Graham performing were made in the 1930s, exact date unknown, and in 1943. A film of Peggy Lyman performing with an introduction by Graham was made for television in 1976.Martha Graham on Film, Classical TV https://www.classicaltv.com/the- informer/martha-graham-on-film  References  External links  * Lamentation, performed by Peggy Lyman, introduced by Martha Graham Category:Ballets by Martha Graham Category:1930 ballet premieres ","title":"Lamentation (ballet)"},{"id":"49142722","text":"Fr√©d√©ric Fougea is a French author, director and cinema and television producer, born on 4 March 1961 in Paris. He heads the production company Bor√©ales, which he founded in 1987. His films are recognisable for their particular style, mixing documentary and fiction: constructed more like \\"narratives\\", than classic documentaries,¬´Les belles histoires des fr√®res Fougea¬ª, Le Monde, 9 janvier 2014 they are often described as \\"tales\\". Their focus tends to be the relationship between humans and animals; exploring the animalistic qualities of man and the human traits of animals. Biography From a young age, Fougea demonstrated a taste for travel and awareness for other cultures and civilisations. Alongside his traditional education (secondary school followed by Business School in Paris Sup de Co Paris) he set aside several months every year in order to travel: South America, Asia, a year in the United States of America and a year at the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore, one of the best business schools in the Asia-Pacific. He began his professional life with the establishment of a service-sector company in Equatorial Guinea, where he stayed for three years. On his return to Paris, he launched himself into audiovisual work: in 1987, with his mother and his brother Barth√©l√©my Fougea, he launched the production company Bor√©ales. Fougea‚Äôs knowledge of ethology and anthropology, along with his appreciation for the oral tradition, legends and singular destinies, can all be found in his films. Cormoran fishing son lake Erhai of Yunnan in China Between 1989 and 1999 he wrote and produced, with his company Bor√©ales and Canal+, a series of thirteen animal films, entitled Les Seigneurs des animaux (The Lords of the Animals).He has directed four : Le Joueur de singes (1990), Le Seigneur des aigles (1991), Il danse pour ses cormorans (1993) et Le Cochon de Gaston (1995) The series was primarily concerned with the extraordinary relationships maintained between humans and animals in traditional societies. Il danse pour ses cormorans (1993), the most famous work of the series, tells the story of a Chinese fisherman who has trained his cormorants using ancestral techniques: they obey his voice and movements and fish for him. This anthology saw great success, internationally. Broadcast on over one hundred channels in every country, translated into forty languages, it brought back more than one hundred awards from festivals worldwide, among them an International Emmy Award and the Grand National Prize for Audiovisual Creation (1994).Lib√©ration, 19 December 1994 At the same time, he produced, in collaboration with his brother Barth√©l√©my Fougea, the collection Passions d‚Äôenfants (1996) that portrays young musical prodigies from all four corners of the globe, through the discovery of their world and their music. Fr√©d√©ric Fougea has always been very drawn to music; he plays the saxophone and has been part of a jazz band, Messe C√¢line, for several years. Music also plays an important role in the films of Bor√©ales. He entrusts Laurent Ferlet with the composition of the majority of his film music. The city of Hampi in India, the ¬´monkey kingdom¬ª, set of the film Hanuman He made his first venture into cinema in 1998, in writing and directing the feature film Hanuman, in coproduction with Gaumont. The film depicts the remarkable friendship between a young Scotsman and a macaque who helps him to fight against cultural heritage traffic in India. After having produced animal documentaries such as \\"The Monkey Prince\\" or \\"The Fabulous Adventure of Men and Animals\\", he wrote the narration for \\"A Species Odyssey\\" (2003), Jacques Malaterre‚Äôs popular docu-fiction dedicated to the prehistoric. In its first broadcast on France 3, the docu-fiction was watched by 8.7 million viewers, 34.2% of the public; referred to by Le Parisien as a real \\"television event\\". Fr√©d√©ric Fougea produced sequels to this film: \\"Homo sapiens\\" in 2005 and \\"The Rise of Man\\" in 2007. This trilogy was broadcast globally. It benefitted notably from the scientific expertise of paleoanthropologist Yves Coppens. In the meantime, Fr√©d√©ric Fougea wrote and produced the true story of a chimpanzee and its trainer in \\"Ham, Astrochimp #65\\" (2006), directed by J√©r√¥me-Cecil Auffret. He encountered cinema again when he co-wrote the original screenplay with Michel Fessler for \\"Man to Man\\" (2005), the epic saga of two pygmies in Europe at the end of the 19th century, directed by R√©gis Wargnier, with Kristin Scott Thomas and Joseph Fiennes in the main roles. In 2008, he began the collection Ce jour-l√†, tout a change, for France T√©l√©visions. Created for a prime time audience, and made with substantial production value, the series aims to transport the viewer to behind the scenes of power and to relive all the intensity and drama of the key moments in our history. Following \\"L‚ÄôAssassinat d‚ÄôHenri IV \\"and \\"L‚Äô√âvasion de Louis XVI\\", \\"L‚ÄôAppel du 18 juin\\" was broadcast in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the event. In 2010, he organised an ambitious shoot in Japan: \\"Facing the Killer Volcano\\", a docu-fiction directed by J√©r√¥me Cornuau that recounts the final days of Maurice and Katia Krafft on the slopes of Mount Unzen. This \\"super-production\\" blends exclusive archive footage and aerial views with reconstructed scenes with comedians. A brown bear in the Pyrenees Broadcast 17 December 2013 on France 2, \\"Le Plus Beau Pays du monde\\" (Wild France), which he wrote, produced and directed in collaboration with Jacques Malaterre, is an immense success: it welcomed 6.5 million viewers (another 500,000 on replay) a 23.4% market share, France 2‚Äôs best audience (outside sport and politics) in the year 2013,¬´La France est bien \\"le plus beau pays du monde\\"¬ª, Le Parisien, 19 d√©cembre 2013 and voted France‚Äôs favourite programme in 2013 (with a score of 8.9/10 on the Qualimat barometer for Harris Interactive). L'Express described it as a \\"spectacular celebration of nature\\". The film is a journey to the heart of French wildlife, made up of little animal \\"stories\\" filmed as closely as possible: two stags who fight for the attentions of a group of does, two wolf cubs leaving their den for the first time, a family of geese featuring a rebellious daughter, the \\"fabulous destiny of a grouper who changes sex\\"‚Ä¶This \\"documentary event of international proportions\\"Serge Siritzky in √âcran total n¬∞973, 4 December 2013, p. 10 took three years of work and a budget of remarkable size for a documentary ‚Äì more than 3 million euros.\\"Comment a √©t√© film√© le 'Plus Beau Pays du monde'\\", Le Parisien, 17 December 2013 The shooting was carried out having resorted to ultra perfected materials: drones, subaquatic cameras, helicopters, hot-air balloons, flights in Microlights. It is the actor Guillaume de Tonqu√©dec who lends his voice to the narration of the film. All these ingredients have permitted the genre of animal documentary to raise itself to a place rarely reached in prime time. Fr√©d√©ric Fougea has developed a second opus for the documentary. In 2015, Why I Did (Not) Eat My Father\\" will be released, which Fougea co-authored and co-directed with Jamel Debbouze, and co-produced with Path√©. It‚Äôs an animated, comedy adaption of Roy Lewis‚Äô book \\"Why I Did (not) Eat my Father\\" (1960), a project that Fougea has had in mind since 1991. The film took at least three years of writing and five years of directing. It is entirely filmed in motion capture. This process has helped to \\"resuscitate\\" the film for actor Louis de Fun√®s, who served as the model for the character of Vladimir. In 2016, he will direct \\"First Man\\", a docu-fiction coproduced by Bor√©ales and Nilaya Productions, which recounts the great adventure of evolution through the saga of a single family. This new story of our origins will be brought to light thanks to recent scientific discoveries and new imaging technology. For his capacity for innovation, Fr√©d√©ric Fougea has been listed by Realscreen magazine among the 100 most influential producers in the world. His singular style, in the line of Robert Flaherty, sets him apart from other documentary film makers: \\"he is a storyteller\\" (Realscreen). Since the 1990s, he has taken an opposite stance to the \\"factual\\", Anglo-Saxon school of thought, which dominates the genre of documentary. His documentary \\"tales\\" will finally find an audience and recognition even in the English speaking world.

Charles Ewart Eckersley grew up in the North of England and attended Manchester University, where he gained an M.A. in English. He served in the Royal Artillery during World War I and later gained his first civilian job as a schoolmaster. He was appointed to the staff of the Polytechnic Boys‚Äô School in Regent Street, London, in 1921. The school was associated with the Polytechnic Institute, which specialised in technical education and language teaching, and provided classes in English for foreigners. It was a frequent occurrence for Boys‚Äô Schoolmasters to be asked to help with the Institute‚Äôs evening classes, and so it was that Eckersley gained his first experience of teaching English as a foreign language. The methods used by a French master at the Boys‚Äô School, H.O.

In some reports she accompanied Ogle's daughter Mary to White Hall Plantation in 1764 upon Mary's marriage to John Ridout, Ogle's secretary;Trail of Souls: A Pilgrimage Toward Truth & Reconciliation at St. Margaret‚Äôs Episcopal Church, Westminster Parish, Annapolis MD, page 11 Historian Jessica Millward places the transfer sometime between 1765 and 1767, saying that 'It is equally possible that Charity became the property of John Ridout when he served as executor of the estates of Benjamin Tasker, Sr. and Benjamin Tasker, Jr.' Family While still enslaved, she married her husband Thomas who was enslaved by another Annapolis merchant until 1794Millward, Jessica. \\"The Relics of Slavery\\": Interracial Sex and Manumission in the American South.\\" Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies 31.3 (2010): 22-30. She and her husband had several children including Harriet Calder (1789-??), who married and had three children with white man William Calder; Mary Folks (1799-??); and namesake Charity Folks Bishop (1793-1877), who married William Henry Bishop, Jr. (1802-1870)finding aid to Joan C.

Freedom She was freed in 1797 by Mary (Ogle) Ridout after John Ridout's death. However, it has been noted that 'the 1797 deed for manumission...was not a gift of immediate freedom.'Anne Arundel County Court, Manumission Record, 1797-1807, Volume 825, Page 17‚Äì18 December 8, 1797 and recorded December 14, 1797 As a freed woman, she continued working for the same family, and was named in Mary's will.

Schmidlin (1861-1939) was an Australian X-ray pioneer, that was among the first to utilize the new technology of x-rays for medical applications. In Australia, the medical men of the day took a slow approach in the adoption of the new science that involved x-rays. Many of the early demonstrations were made by investigators outside the medical field. Upon examination of the initial investigators, several key factors were common. The individuals had already either been experimenting along similar lines to Wilhelm R√∂ntgen with Crookes tubes and such, the physicists or scientists, or were actively associated with electrical work, the electricians, which made them particularly receptive to the technical appeal of the new science of x-rays. Records of the events reveal that among the medical men who witnessed the first images produced as radiographs, a rather small number had any great desire to employ X-rays directly in their own medical practice. After the early investigative work of Thomas Ranken Lyle, William Henry Bragg, Joseph Patrick Slattery, and others, almost all medical men were satisfied with soliciting the services of the external X-ray man when necessity arose for skiagraphs to be produced. As the utilization of x-rays became more acceptable, the involvement of electricians began to decline. As the hospitals started to be equipped with x-ray apparatus and installations under the care of radiologists and radiographers, the medical men began to accept the eventuality of the new technology. Up to this point, the private experimenters and investigators continued to be the initiators of new ideas for the medical profession in this new field. Life and times In 1861, Schmidlin was born in Switzerland. In 1881, the Census of England and Wales records indicate that he was living as a boarder in the James Tomkinson family residence in Manchester, England. His occupation was listed as a mechanic (fitter).England and Wales Census, 1881. Database with images. FamilySearch.

Tilley, (born in 1868, New South Wales). Schmidlin died in 1939.

In 1899, Schmidlin was elected to the Royal Society of New South Wales.Maiden, J.H. and Knibbs, G.H. (1907). Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales. Royal Society of New South Wales. Sydney. In 1900, the business of F. Schmidlin was located at 44 Elizabeth Street, Sydney and advertised in the Australasian Medical Gazette. The advertisement mentioned the availability of all necessary apparatus for x-rays. F. Schmidlin was listed as electrician and importer of electro-medical apparatus.Bruck, L. (20 October 1900).

In 1901, Schmidlin was elected to the Rontgen Society.Gardiner, J.H. and Low, Harrison F. (July 1906). Annual Report. The Rontgen Society. The Journal of the Rontgen Society. London, England. Schmidlin became an agent for the London electrical firm of Karl Schall from RGS, Reiniger, Gebbert & Schall.Reiniger, Gebbert & Schall. (1897). Trade Catalog. Katalog √ºber Elektro-medizinische Apparate von Reiniger, Gebbert & Schall: Elektrotechnische Fabrik Abteilung A Erlangen Luitpoldstrasse 45. Page 46. Of interest to note, Schall just happened to be Schmidlin's brother-in-law. With the connection to Schall, Schmidlin became an initial importer and supplier of X-ray coils and tubes into Sydney for the medical practitioners. In the early days with this new technological advancement, the supplier of X-ray apparatus became the expert and the demonstrator. Schmidlin operated in the capacity as demonstrator and instructor for several years. He trained the medical men in the electrics of the new techniques. Beginning in June 1896, Schmidlin and his expertise as radiographer with x-ray apparatus were requested by surgeons for locating foreign bodies. His equipment consisted of a 6-inch coil, a 6 cell bichromate battery configuration and Crookes Focus Tube, and on occasion necessitated that a 30-minute exposure be applied. With this apparatus, he produced successful negatives. In 1906, F. Schmidlin, electrician, business located at 83 Elizabeth Street, Sydney, New South Wales advertised equipment available from his line of goods, that included portable accumulators for x-ray work and x-ray apparatus kept in stock with ‚Äúa complete X-Ray Apparatus is always in readiness for Screen Examinations or to take Radiographs of Patients‚Äù.Editor. (20 December 1906). The Australasian Medical Gazette Advertiser. Australasian Medical Gazette: The Journal of the Australasian Branches of the British Medical Association. Volume 25: page 16. Coverage in the local press In an effort to depict the mindset of the time and place, a few articles are reproduced here. In a typical example of the work that Schmidlin was called upon to perform, the Sydney Morning Herald carried this story on 15 August 1896.Editor. (15 August 1896). The Rontgen Rays and Surgery. The Sydney Morning Herald. Sydney. New South Wales. > The Rontgen Rays and Surgery. The bullet in the leg of the man Acheson, who > was shot near Tilpa, and is now in the Sydney Hospital, was located by means > of the Rontgen rays applied by Mr. Schmidlin.

The name Brennilis is made up of two Breton words- \\"Bren\\" means a hill and \\"iliz\\" means a church. Brennilis stands at the foot of Brasparts' Mont Saint- Michel in the Monts d'Arr√©e. The √âglise Notre Dame dates to 1485 according to an inscription near the main altar which reads \\"Yves Toux, procureur, l'an 1485, commencement de cette chapelle\\".

The statue stands on the crescent of a moon and below is a bust of Eve holding the fatal apple. This statue is held within a shuttered niche, the shutters being painted with depictions of the Annunciation Sainte Genevi√®ve, Sainte Apolline and others. The church comprises a nave with aisles of four bays and a transept. The church dates mainly from the late fifteenth century but was rebuilt several times. The west gable, whose twin doors date from the sixteenth century, was radically changed in 1694 and restored in 1862 and in 1955. Above the gate, we see the arms of Qu√©len with the dates 1693 and 1694 above them. The main stained glass window depicts the life of the Virgin Mary and dates to the 16th-century and has eight scenes: the presentation in the temple, the Annunciation, her marriage, the Visitation, the Nativity, the visit of the three wise men, the circumcision and the Flight into Egypt. The Sibyls At the altar by the lower south side of the church are bas-reliefs representing the 12 Sibyls. Processional cross The church has a beautiful processional cross dating to 1650. The altar-piece of the main altar This altar-piece is decorated with seven bas-relief panels depicting the Annunciation, the Visitation, the Nativity, an angel announcing the news of Jesus' birth to the shepherds, the Adoration of the Magi, the circumcision and the Assumption. In the annunciation scene the Virgin Mary is kneeling at a prie-Dieu and the Angel Gabriel carries a sceptre and a banner inscribed with the words \\"Ave Maria Dominus tecum\\". In the visitation Elizabeth kneels before her cousin the Virgin Mary and Zechariah (priest) is advancing towards them. In the Nativity the Virgin Mary and Joseph kneel before the baby Jesus with an angel placed between them. To the rear the cow and the ass are shown. The scene is set not in a stable but the ruins of the old palace of David. In the scene depicting the angel appearing to the shepherds, the angel appears standing in a cloud and she has a banner inscribed \\"Gloria in excelsis Deo\\". Three shepherds are shown, two asleep and one just waking up. In the scene showing the appearance of the three wise men the Virgin Mary is seated with baby Jesus on her lap. Joseph stands behind her. The first king has taken off his crown and kneels before them. He is accompanied by a page. The two other kings, still wearing their crowns, stand holding the gifts they will soon offer to Jesus. In the circumcision scene an old man holds Jesus above a table and the Virgin Mary is kneeling whilst Joseph stands. Two other men stand witnessing the scene. Finally in the depiction of the Assumption, carved on the tabernacle door, the Virgin Mary stands in the clouds surrounded by four angels who help her climb up to heaven. Two of the angels place a crown on her head. The angels are surrounded by depictions of the heads of cherubs. The bas-reliefs are separated by six statuettes. Calvary Outside Brennilis' Notre Dame church, we can see Dor√©'s 5 metre high \\"Croix de calvaire\\" which dates to 1625 and includes the group \\"Notre-Dame de Piti√©\\" at the Cross' base. The Cross is located to the north of the church and has the coat of arms (\\"Blason\\") of the Qu√©len family at the base. Dor√© depicts an angel holding the titulus above Jesus' head. At the base of the pedestal supporting the Cross is the piet√† \\"Notre-Dame de Piti√©\\", with a sword bearing image of the resurrected Christ on the reverse side.

First modeled in Amsterdam in the late 1970s where they were innocently called coffee shops, it would take the Americans more than a generation to successfully duplicate the idea of a retail cannabis storefront. Unlike the Dutch coffee shops, today dispensary customers are prevented from consuming cannabis on the site of a regulated dispensary in all known markets. In a traditional Medical cannabis dispensary store a patient receives cannabis medication as allowed per the patient's doctor's recommendation. These dispensaries sell cannabis products that have not been approved by the FDA and are not legally registered with the federal government. As of 2016 there are state regulated marijuana dispensaries in Washington, Oregon, California, Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Illinois, Michigan, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Washington, D.C. A cannabis dispensary differs from similar retail stores known as head shops, in that only state licensed cannabis dispensaries are authorized to sell cannabis. History The first dispensary San Francisco Cannabis Buyers Club was founded in 1992 by Proposition 215 coauthors \\"Brownie Mary\\" Rathbun, Dennis Peron and Dale Gieringer. Washington state became the second state in the U.S. to develop a regulatory framework for marijuana dispensary operators improving the access to cannabis patients beyond the caregiver model.History of Washington State marijuana laws http://www.ncsl.org/documents/summit/summit2015/onlineresources/wa_mj_law_history.pdf National Conference of State Legislators The term \\"marijuana dispensary\\" in the United States is most often used to refer to private organizations or companies that sell cannabis, particularly in the states of California, Colorado, Washington and Oregon. \\"Cannabis dispensary\\" is starting to become a more politically correct term as conscientious people prefer the use of the word cannabis which avoids using the more common Spanish slang word \\"marijuana\\". Medical dispensaries Medical cannabis Twenty three of the United States regulate some form of medical cannabis sales despite federal laws. As of 2016 seventeen of those states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, and Washington, D.C.) have at least one medical marijuana dispensary, with varying product laws. The medical dispensaries in these states buy their exit shop products (excluding medical marijuana), like child proof safety bags, and in- store storage products, from a plethora of new manufacturing companies in mainly China via importers based in the U.S. The growing need of dispensaries to comply with various legislative laws has given birth to thousands of new products ranging from vials with child locks on them to, to pop top bottles that are childproof and even childproof joint tubes. For example, according to Title 16 C.F.R. 1700 of the Poison Prevention Packaging Act in Washington, any marijuana products, whether they are edibles, concentrates, or waxes that can be consumed either by inhaling or swallowing must be sold in child resistant packaging. Recreational dispensaries Today eight states Alaska (Alaska Measure 2 (2014)), California (2018), Colorado (Colorado Amendment 64), Massachusetts (2012), Nevada (2017), Oregon (Oregon Ballot Measure 91 (2014)), Michigan, and Washington (Washington Initiative 502) currently regulate recreational sellers. These are stores where any adult 21+ can enter to purchase cannabis and or cannabis smoking accessories.

The City of Oakland tried to help the marijuana dispensary by filing a lawsuit against the Department of Justice, but the effort was thrown out by a federal magistrate.

Robert was an Augustinian canon at Bridlington Priory. He held the office of prior, the fourth to hold that office. He occurs as prior in documents dating to sometime between 1147 and 1156. He was out of office by 1159, and may have resigned the office rather than dying in office.Knowles, et al. Heads of Religious Houses p. 154 The historian Richard Sharpe gives his death date as after 1154.Sharpe Handlist of the Latin Writers pp. 526‚Äì528 The sixteenth-century antiquary John Leland recorded that Robert was buried in the cloister of the priory near the doors of the chapter house. According to Leland the inscription on his monument read \\"Robertus cognomento Scriba quartus prior\\" or \\"Robert surnamed Scribe fourth prior\\". Leland saw copies of his works in the priory library, and his alternate name \\"the Scribe\\" arose from the number of writings that he authored.Postles \\"Bridlington, Robert of\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Robert wrote a number of works of biblical commentary, some of which survive and some which are not extant. He is occasionally confused with another contemporary author who was Augustinian canon ‚Äì Robert of Cricklade, who was prior of St Frideswide's Priory in Oxfordshire. Robert of Bridlinton's surviving works include a commentary on the Book of Exodus, which survives in two manuscripts, a commentary on the minor prophets, surviving in three copies, a commentary on the Pauline Epistles in two extant copies, and a commentary on the visions in the Book of Revelation, surviving in two manuscripts. The work on Revelation may have been by Robert of Cricklade. None of these works have been published yet. Robert's works that do not survive include a commentary on the Book of Genesis, one on the Book of Leviticus, a commentary on the Book of Numbers, a treatise on the Book of Deuteronomy, a commentary on the Gospel of Matthew, a work on the Gospel of John, a work entitled De corpore et sanguine Domini, and a treatise entitled De ecclesia catholica. Robert is known to have written a commentary on the Book of Psalms, which may be the same as a work at Syon known as \\"Bridlyinton super Psalterium\\" (MS F.20). This may be the same work as two other manuscripts ‚Äì one held in the British Library (MS Royal 3 B.xi) and the other at the Durham University in the Library. (MS CosinV.V. 19) ‚Äì but these are not securely ascribed to Robert. A work titled Dialogus in regulam S. Augustini has been published as The Bridlinton Dialogue and ascribed to Robert, but further research by M. L. Colker has argued that this work can be dated to after Robert's lifetime and thus is not by Robert. A work on the Lord's Prayer is often ascribed to Robert but this rests entirely on the witness of John Bale in the sixteenth-century and is not considered to be correct. J. C. Dickinson concurred with Colker's conclusions, arguing that the Robert's works show contacts with continental scholarship that is lacking in the Dialogus. The historian Beryl Smalley considered Robert to be a compiler as an author, and that he worked within a conservative framework for his scholarship.

She was accused of spying and arrested in October 2014. In March 2015, federal prosecutors dropped all charges against her without explanation before the trial began. Even with the case dropped, Sherry was fired from her job in March 2016 for many of the same reasons that she was originally prosecuted for. In October 2016, Sherry filed a case of wrongful employment termination to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). In April 2018, MSPB issued a decision stating that Sherry was \\"a victim of gross injustice\\" and ordered the Department Of Commerce (NWS is an agency under DOC) to give her job back with back pay. In June 2018, DOC filed an appeal of the MSPB decision. Unfortunately, MSPB has lacked a quorum to process appeals and its backlog has grown to 1,600 cases by the end of October 2018. In January 2019, with her case in an indefinite limbo, Sherry's legal team filed a civil lawsuit against the U.S. government for the malicious prosecution and false arrest in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. The case is now pending.  Historical context  The National Security Strategy issued in late 2017 officially declared China to be a competitive rival to the U.S. Implementation of the strategy has followed with intensified information campaigns and additional legislations and regulations that also enable the profiling practice, such as the \\"whole-of-society\\" approach advocated by FBI Director Christopher Wray and the Department of Justice's China Initiative.  Sherry Chen's background and employment in NWS  Sherry Chen is a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Beijing, China. From an early age, she was interested in engineering, especially in the abstract nature of water and air. She earned advanced degrees in Hydrology in Beijing, married and moved to the United States to pursue a graduate degree in Water Resources and Climatology. After graduation, she worked for the Missouri Department of Natural Resources for over 11 years before moving to the Ohio River Forecast Center (OHRFC) of the National Weather Service in March 2007. Sherry‚Äôs primary work was to develop and implement the Ohio River Community HEC-RAS Model, which was the largest of its kind in the nation at that time. The goal of the computer model is to significantly improve flood prediction for over 2,000 miles along the Ohio River and its tributaries. The modeling effort is a critical part of the joint mission of OHRFC and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Substantial Geographic Information System (GIS) work must be done to geo-referencing the channel cross-section data and extend the cross-sections into floodplain areas, including levees and dams that protect communities from flooding, bridges, and off-channel storage areas. Sherry was the hydraulic modeler in the team, responsible for setting up the model in great detail. Inches matter because it represents the difference between levees being breached or not. Levee failure can lead to significant loss of property and, possibly, lives. Her team received the 2011 National Weather Association Larry R. Johnson Special Award for the ‚Äúdevelopment of and operational success with the Ohio River Community HEC-RAS Model during May 2011 Ohio and Mississippi River flooding.\\" Sherry worked many long hours during a critical period of the record-setting flood event to get the best possible model results to aid the USACE in their operational decision-making process.  Federal prosecution and case dismissal  Sherry's case was triggered by her trip to Beijing to visit her elderly parents in 2012. One of her relatives had a dispute with local government about a water pipeline and approached Sherry for help since Mr. Jiao Yong at China‚Äôs Ministry of Water Resources is Sherry's former classmate in Hydrology. Sherry met with Mr. Jiao for 15 minutes and told him about her relative‚Äôs complaint. Towards the end of the meeting, Mr. Jiao said his office was trying to fund the repairs of China‚Äôs aging reservoir system and was curious how this may work in the U.S. As a favor to a former classmate and also for a fellow professional in the same field, Sherry agreed to help. Once returned to USA, Sherry sent Mr. Jiao some public websites and also asked around at work to see if any of her co- workers could help. Her boss introduced her to talk to a colleague at Water Management Division of the US Army Corps of Engineers (ACE). The colleague said Mr. Jiao could talk to her directly. Sherry then emailed Mr. Jiao to contact the colleague, without following up further herself. Later, the colleague reported Sherry to the government security agency, suggesting that Sherry may be a Chinese spy and may be stealing government information. Since then, Sherry had unwittingly become a Chinese spy suspect by the US government. In June 2013, Sherry was interviewed in her office by two security agents from the Department of Commerce. It was a 7-hour marathon interrogation with no food, water, or break. The agents told Chen that she could not tell this interview to anyone, and that she didn't need a lawyer. Chen tried to cooperate and told the agents everything she knew. The agents failed to find any ‚Äúspying‚Äù evidence. But they still claimed that Sherry was ‚Äúlying‚Äù to federal investigators because she couldn't quite recall some of the dates or events. On October 20, 2014, six FBI agents took her away in handcuffs in front of her colleagues. The Department of Justice (DOJ) issued an indictment with a punishment of up to 25 years in jail and $1M in fines. The original charges included accusing Sherry of stealing data, intentionally exceeded authorized access to a database and two false statements, meaning that she lied to investigators. Sherry's lawyer, Peter R. Zeidenberg, a partner at Arent Fox in Washington, D.C., defended her case. He found fatal flaws in the case and filed three motions pointing out these flaws and request DOJ to have the case dismissed. The prosecutor went back to grand jury to fix the problems and came back with eight charges and added another prosecutor on his team. After extensive interviews of witness including almost all of Chen's coworkers, search of the history of Chen's bank account statements over twenty years since she came to the US, personal and official email accounts, computer activities, the government decided to drop all the charges against Chen in March 2015 without explanation.  Firing and MSPB verdict  Despite the dropping of all charges, the NWS fired her in March 2016 citing many of the same reasons that she was originally prosecuted for. In October 2016, Sherry filed a case of wrongful employment termination to Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), an independent quasi-judicial agency established in 1979 to protect federal merit systems against partisan political and other prohibited personnel practices and to protect federal employees against abuses by agency management. In Sherry's case, the management agency is the Department of Commerce (DOC), which oversees the NWS housed in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. MSPB held a public hearing on Sherry's case in Cincinnati, Ohio on March 14‚Äì15, 2017. After two full days of testimonies, the hearing ended promptly at 4:00 pm on March 15. It was subsequently completed by video conference on March 28. On April 23, 2018, Chief Administrative Judge Michele Schroeder issued her verdict. In her 135-page written decision, the judge agreed that Sherry is the ‚Äúvictim of gross injustice.‚Äù The judge ruled that DOC did not have cause to fire Sherry Chen and ordered the agency to reinstate her employment at the National Weather Service and pay her back pay plus benefits. The judge deemed it ‚Äúinconceivable‚Äù in the way the DOC‚Äôs criminal investigators were selective and biased in producing their investigative reports. The judge also found it ‚Äútroubling‚Äù that, before firing Sherry, DOC officials utterly failed to include in the DOC file a dozen sworn declarations from Sherry‚Äôs co-workers that were ‚Äúclearly relevant‚Äù to the termination decision. The judge further excoriated DOC officials for \\"digging their heels in when it came time to support the decision they had made,\\" observing that \\"Ms. Furgione and Admiral Devany seemed more concerned about being right than doing the right thing. Based on the unyielding nature of their testimony, I would not have been surprised if they rejected that 2 + 2 = 4.\\" The historical chance of a federal employee winning a MSPB appeal is less than 2%. Not only did Sherry beat the odds and overwhelmingly won her appeal against DOC, the decision also provided a strong indictment of the mishandling of her case.  DOC appeal  In June 2018, despite the clear verdict and the lack of new arguments, DOC filed an appeal of the MSPB decision. Sherry filed a cross-appeal. The written arguments from both sides were completed on August 28, 2018. The next step is for MSPB to review and decide on the petitions, which require a quorum of at least two members. Unfortunately MSPB had only one member at that time and it's down to zero as of Feb. 28, 2019. Three individuals were nominated to MSPB in 2018, but one withdrew and the Senate Republicans refused to confirm the other two until a third member is nominated. The backlog of appeals in MSPB has grown to more than 1,600 cases at the end of 2018. Sherry's case is in indefinite limbo with MSPB.  Civil lawsuit  On January 18, 2019, Sherry Chen's legal team filed a civil lawsuit against the U.S. government for the malicious prosecution and false arrest of Sherry Chen in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. The case is now pending. Sherry still doesn't have her job back or got the back pay owed to her. A group of volunteers are helping her raise the mounting legal fee through Sherry Chen Defense Fund.

The tanker \\"Kherson\\" with deadweight of 11,800 tons was the first large-tonnage ship which was delivered to the customer on 2 December 1952. Leftist revolutionaries headed by Fidel Castro and Raul Castro, Ernesto Che Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos arrived to Cuba on the yacht \\"Granma\\" and landed in December, 1956. They started the armed struggle against the regime. To support Cuba The Soviet Union needed transatlantic big ships to support Cuba and able to work in tropical areas. Some shipbuilding specialists from Leningrad were replaced in Kherson. During 1957 the main efforts of the entire staff of the shipyard was directed to the construction of the first in this class cargo ship with deadweight 16 000 mt? the bigger merchant ship in USSR. From the beginning the pre-production was delayed due to the backlog of the design work in the Nicholayev Central Design Buro \\"Chernomorsudoproekt\\", as well as extremely unsatisfactory receipt of rolled metal products. These circumstances made a very difficult situation for shipbuilders. A particularly large amount of work was to perform The chief technologist's department and technicians workshops had too much works: to develop a fundamentally new technology of ship's construction, create standard technological processes and schedules for preparation of production in a short time. Technologists had made all the drawings separately for each workshop, drawn up statements of technological units and determined their laboriousness in early 1957. Still had to develop a standard technology and working technology on all kinds of hull works, installation of the main turbine gear unit, auxiliary machineries, shaft, main boilers, piping systems and to carry out finally works. The komsomols and youth of Kherson Shipyard took patronage over the construction of the first cargo vessel in new class of ships and committed to pass this ship into operation to the 40th anniversary of Komsomol organization; that meant two months earlier than planned. Due to request of the komsomols and youth of Kherson Shipyard, the Ministry of the Merchant Fleet named this ship Leninsky Komsomol. The construction of the head freighter begun in the metalworking shop in June 1957. Sectional assembly shop mastered the construction of large sections weighing up to 100 tons. Lack of experience and new technology increased difficulties for the collective. In addition, some problems were created due to the mistakes that were made in the manufacture of rigging, as well as poorly assembled beds used as support for big sections of the ship. Supply with the timber, specific thickness metal production were received with delay. However, the innovators of the shipyard have made various proposals to improve the methods of ship's construction. For example, a group of engineers by name Eppel A.R., Kulikova A.A., Ziberova V.K., Bagnenko F.M. proposed to amend the scheme of pipeline for tank bottom heater. This greatly reduced the pipe's bending works. It is very time-consuming operation was a trimming of places for the installation of a set of sections, which was carried by a grinding machine manually. Workers of sectional assembly shop Piller M.A. and Eremenko A.V. offered and produced a special pushcart with a load to which the grinding machine was attached. Now workers move the pushcart in places where the cleaning required and operate by switch which is mounted on the handle of the pushcart. Works on assembling the aft part of the ship's hull and the stern frame installation required a great experience. To get the job done accurately and in time it always entrusted brigade of foreman Ivanov P.C. who came to shipbuilding in 1946 and began to build ships at the Leningrad shipyard. In 1951, he arrived with the accumulated experience at the Kherson shipyard in 1951 and was assigned to lead a team of fitters, which consisted of 17 people at the time of the cargo ship Leninsky Komsomol construction. Most of this 17 people were his students who later become experienced fitters. The assembly of the most complex parts of the ship's hull was assigned this particular team. A change of leaders was at the Kherson shipyard in August 1958: the director of the shipyard IG Anatsky I.G. was transferred to work in the Kherson Economic Council, as well as former chief technology officer of the Black Sea Shipyard Zakharov A.N. was appointed the Kherson shipyard director. The new director has paid much attention to the construction of the head of general cargo vessel Leninsky Komsomol. The volume of work on the freighter has increased more than 2 times as compared with the tanker. Therefore, the director understood what an enormous effort will require the shipbuilding of this more complex vessels and the implementation of the production program as a whole.

On Soviet freighter increased the speed also ... The captain of a foreign ship increased speed again and overtake our tweendecker. Then our turbo-runner increased speed up to Full Ahead, made circulation around the running foreign vessel, run far ahead and has not give a chance for the foreign vessel to overtake Soviet ship. The captain of the foreign ship call by VHF radio communication: \\\\- Whose ship? Which nationality? It looks like a fictitional story. But it is partly fictitionally. Can be the circulation was not made only. To understand from where it had come we have to back in March 1962. The cargo ship Leninsky Komsomol briefly returned to the port of Kherson in March 1962 and meeting of sailors and shipbuilders was carried out. The ship's captain Kud' I.A. spoke with admiration about the design of the ship, navigation instruments and equipment, about the fast speed of turbine-runner: We are entering the Red Sea and abserve smoke of some steamers on the horizon. After some time we overtake and leave them behind our stern. \\\\- Whose ship and from where? - British ship \\"Chitrol\\" asks using the Flag semaphore. \\\\- From Kherson. - It is our answer. \\\\- Where is this city, we do not know? I had answered in details: \\\\- \\"Kherson is a native brother of Odessa and they are living close one to another\\" - we sending by pass flags with humor. Well, everybody knows Odessa. But the foreigner did not calm down and asked the company name that built the ship. The captain ordered to spell the Ministry. The Englishman again did not let up and wanted to know who the president of the company. The radio operator said the name of the director of the Kherson shipyard. Now the Englishman thanked and asked him to convey greetings to President of the company which is building such magnificent ships. And that will be very glad to see Mr. Zabotin personally (Zabotin became director of Kherson shipyard in 1961). This meeting took place then. Assertive English captain was the president of a major shipbuilding company. He was surprised with the Kherson shipyard. On departure he invited Mr. Zabotin to his guests. The invitation was accepted ... This story was described in the magazine Ogonyok ‚Ññ16 dated 15 of April, 1962, in which the author of the article \\"The flags remain astern\\" Mrs. Korobova R. wrote using own overdone manner: Approaching the Suez in January of this year the Soviet turbine-runner \\"Leninsky Komsomol\\" has overtaken the British passenger ship \\"Chitral\\". The ships passed one to another so close that you could see the surprised faces of the passengers on the \\"Chitral\\" using the binoculars. The captain of the British ship wanted to give up and he ordered to increase speed. Result was unsuccessfully and the British flag remained behind the stern of the Soviet vessel. \\"Leninsky Komsomol\\" is the young ship ... but for such a short time the liner has added fame to the Soviet sailors and shipbuilding in Motherland. Not so long time ago the captains of foreign ships were surprised that \\"Leninsky Komsomol\\" overtook a convoy after sailing from the Suez Canal. However, if it is considered an fortuity. But the second, third, fourth voyages - and again at the crossroads of marine Soviet ship meets with foreign ships. Again vessels under flags of different countries are being left behind ... To see: SS Chitral and sister ships. Turbine-runner \\"Leninsky Komsomol\\" was able to increase speed up to 18.5 knot when the best cargo steamers in the Black Sea Shipping Company had a maximum speed not more than 14 knots and the old vessels had less speed. Only foreign warships and the latest model passenger ships could achieve equal or greater speeds. A 5 knot difference in speed is enough for circulation around another vessel that is underway. Soviet fans and crewmembers of Leninsky Komsomol class ships call these ships \\"clippers of XX century\\". =Voyage during Operation Anadyr and the break of Cuban blockade.= The Minister of the USSR Merchant Marine Fleet Bakayev V.G. was summoned to the Kremlin to the Deputy Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers Kosygin A.N. on 11 of June, 1962. Leonid Brezhnev and head of the Main Operations Directorate of the General Staff of the USSR Armed Forces, Colonel-General Ivanov S.P. were in the office already. Bakaev was informed that to be a major military operation for the transfer of personnel and equipment to Cuba, which would require the ocean going ships support. Thus began Operation Anadyr. This operation required the transportation of 230,000 tons of cargo and more than 43,000 people - representatives of all kinds and types of the USSR Armed Forces including the Strategic Missile Forces consisting troops of the strategic destination equipped with medium-range missiles R-12, R-14 with a range from 2,500 to 4,500 km (total 42 missile launchers) with nuclear warheads. All this had to be transported during the period from 15 July to 15 November 1962. Voyage Feodosiya-Cuba The ship Leninsky Komsomol sailed from Feodosiya on 28 of August, 1962. The destination port was announced Casablanca, (Morocco). The ship transported 3,000 tons of general cargo and air defense division. Many years later, at the conference about Caribbean crisis, Robert McNamara, who in the 60s was the Minister of Defense, said that his office has even conducted an experiment. For some bulk carriers put Goo enough auantity of US marines were boarded the ships and this ships were replaces at the roadstead. \\"Those mariners stay on board one or two days and raised a riot. They had to back them concluding that like this situation can not be. And we have 18 to 20 days of sailing in such conditions\\", - says Soviet military Nikolay Goncharov later. The former Soviet military commander Dmitry Yazov gave information: \\"Russian soldiers are hardy. Of course, it was hard and especially in case the 12-Bouthort gale. It was such terrible during the pitching and rolling. Many persons stopped to eat.\\" Dmitry Yazov - the future Marshal of the Soviet Union and the defense minister, and at that time was a Colonel appointed to command the 400th motorized infantry regiment hundredths, which was specially created to be sent to Cuba. Those who used northern route were severely shaken by the storm. Soldiers, which coming to Cuba via the Black Sea, suffered for another reason. They still remember the voyage as a 20-day hell through after which they remain alive miraculously. \\"On the first night, approaching the Bosphorus international sanitary inspection checked the ship and we all closed and shut up. All stripped to his underpants due to heat. We thought that the inspectors would come now and will see us. No, nothing like that. A little launch moored alongside, they dropped the rope ladder was dropped for them and two large boxes were lowered by rope. Later we received information that caviar and cognac were inside the boxes\\", - said Nikolai Goncharov. This bribe saved the ship from the inspection and the possible failure of the operation ¬´Anadyr¬ª. People slept on the multi-tiered benches. \\"We, 500 people, were placed in a compartment under the main deck. I slept on the benches there. Roasting was 50 degrees Celsius when moved from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic Ocean. If the coast was near or some ships were close all curtains had been closed and no one outside. When the red-hot iron leafs of hatches were finally shifted to open the hold pairs like in the bath began to fell in the direction from the hatch,\\" - says Valentin Polkovnikov. In addition to that bunks an infinitely long table was maden in the holds where they ate also. \\"We had the turn from the stern deck down by the ladder on the deck close to the forecastle. In the middle stood a man with a fire hose stood in the middle and damp you,\\" - added Valentin Krasotkin. \\"There are two \\"holes\\" on the ship only for natural needs for 700 people. Once a queue. And while the two men did not come back from there, others are waiting for them here,\\" - says Nikolai Goncharov. If somebody needs to use the toilet urgently and at this moment to go out on the deck was not possible, then he lowered to the bottom of the hold. \\"There were buckets or bins, which then were pulled up by rope via our compartment and thrown overboard¬ª, - said Nikolai Goncharov. Who had poor health the conditions of transportation have become a death sentence. \\"Somebody could not withstand and was buried in the sea and with a wreath as per sea custom. Like this our comrades were buried\\", - shared secret Dmitry Senko. It was a little easier for those who went out to sea on board the ship in the late autumn when the heat was subsided. But even in the open ocean it was necessary to hide constantly. American planes appeared over the Soviet ships several times per day. Photos were taken by them and fell immediately to the analysts at the CIA. Military equipments were installed on deck in a special containers. Their production was controlled by Alexei Kosygin personally. The top of containers were trimmed with boardsboards with inscriptions \\"Tractor-export\\" or \\"Agroexport\\" and un der cover the metal sheets to make it impossible to educate by X-ray. \\"We were able to determine that they are carrying weapons, but we could not say exactly what they are carrying in the holds. The Soviet people were very wise. They kept the rocket deep down, and when they unloaded them in Cuba, it was carried at night only\\", - shared the information the American expert Dino Brugioni. \\"We are more concerned about the fact that ships were high in the water indicating that they not loaded fully as per drafts\\", - says Dino Brugioni. Perhaps if it will be possible to provoke the crew the Soviets reveal their intentions during the defense? It is why American planes whirled for days over slowly merchant ships that crossed the ocean to reach Cuba. With the ship's approach to Cuba the US Navy guard ships come close also. Metallurg Anosov in 1960-s. \\"Are flying all day. One goes away and another comes like jumping out from the water out and begins to swoop down and trying to go up over the ship or somewhere nearby. It was a powerful roar. It is happened at the Leninsky Komsomol. She is a powerful cargo ship on which were our guys. One sergeant told me that an American plane began to fly in the morning to nosedive over the ship. Once he flyed up over the ship again then he dives into the ocean\\" - says Nikolai Goncharov. The plane just had not goes out of the last nosedive. The captain of the ship Leninsky Komsomol had requested Moscow and received permission to search and rescue of the American pilot. The ship circled for a while at the crash site, but even on the surface the wreckage did not appear. The ship Leninsky Komsomol arrived at Cuban port Nicaro on 12 of September, 1962. Privily. Personally. Reporting to Comrade Kozlov F.R.: On the approach to island Cuba the US planes fly over the Soviet ships regularly. There were registered 50 cases of flyby over the 15 Soviet ships in September of this year. The flybies were committed to an extremely dangerous heights. Leninsky Komsomol was under the flyby of unknown plane twice on approaching to the port Nicaro at 4.00 Moscow time on the 12 of September. The plane crashed into the sea 150 meters from the ship and sank after the last approach. Starting from the 18 of September, 1962, US warships began to ask repeatedly about the nature of the Soviet transports cargo. * The next voyage to Cuba was in the period of the embargo against Cuba in October 1962. The ship came from Baltic. That was the transportation of subdivisions of 51 missile division to the Cuba. =Removal of the missiles from Cuba. –ì–∞–∑–µ—Ç–∞ \\"OGDENSBURG ADVANCE- NEWS\\". SUNDAY.

But in October USSR agreed with Americans to start removal due to Americans sussed about troops and missiles redeploy to Cuba. means covert operations Anadyr was broken and perhaps the Americans do not know the name of the operation. So secret operation Anadyr was broken. Perhaps Americans do not know the name of the operation and that gave rise the Soviet military to declare in the press that the operation was carried out successfully. Newspaper \\"Utica Observer- Dispatch\\" dated 11 of November, 1962. The Navy was taking no chances that some of the Russian vessels might try to return to Cuba. The U.S. guided missile warship Dahlgren trailed a Soviet freighter through the windward passage yesterday to be sure there was no turnback. The Soviet ship was the 12,015-ton Leninsky Komsomol with eight canvas- shrouded long objects on its deck. These apparently were the missiles the Russian skipper exposed to a U.S. check Friday after holding out for six hours against inspection. When the destroyed Barry inspected the freighter Anosov at dawn yesterday the Soviet skipper refused repeated requests to completely uncover missiles lashed to the deck. But there seemed no doubt that they were rockets and the Pentagon said the count was carried, out \\"without incident\\". The guided missile warship took up the escort of the Leninsky Komsomol after the U.S. destroyer leader Norfolk had photographed the eight uncovered missiles on the Russian vessel's deck. The Norfolk had made radio contact Friday morning and went alongside the Leninsky Komsomol. It had the nose and tail sections of two missil¬´s uncovered. An hour later the Norfolk asked that all missiles be uncovered and repeated the request soon after noon. The Sovietle skipper declined, saying he would have to radio his government to get authority to show missiles. But some six hours tater, the Soviet crew uncovered all the missiles.

The reporters flew in a plane at an altitude of 150 feet over the vessels and could see deck crews at work. The newsmen saw on the deck, four to a side, canvas-shrouded long objects, presumably missiles. Lashed to the fore and aft decks were eight trucks. The Dahlgren was following about 900 feet behind.

President Fulbert Youlou became the first President and he was deposed on 15 of August 1963 as a result of inspired by Trade unions due to powerful protests against corruption in the administrative apparatus on the background of deteriorating economic conditions. Brazzaville became the capital of the independent Republic of the Congo in 1960. The one-party political system was taken as per low. During two days, 15 and 16 of August 1963, the country was ruled by interim government whose leaders were David Moussaka and Felix Muzabakani. The power was taken by provisional government headed by Alphonse Massamba-D√©bat on 16 of August, 1963.

The ship passed Bosphorus, Dardanelles, Suez Canal, Red Sea, Bab-el- Mandeb and entered the Indian Ocean bound for Japan where the ship made the first stoppage in Nagoya. The next week stevedores unloaded the ship manually and the crew went out in small groups to the city. From the port of Nagoya Leninsky Komsomol run to Vladivostok for bunkering. After the ship in ballast crossed the Pacific Ocean and through Panama Canal reached Cuba. In the port of Cienfuegos ship was fully loaded with cane sugar which was shoveled by buldousers. After the ship was on the way at home, back to Black Sea, in Novorossiysk. Due to the bulkhead between the cargo hold No 4 and engine room was heated. The raw sugar turned into stone close to this bulkhead and it was possible to unload using the jackhammers only. The circumnavigation took 88 days including 7 days for discharge in Nagoya, 3 days for bunkering in Vladivostok and 1 day in Cienfuegos. The ship passed 26,156 nautical miles (48,388 km). If we will discard the time of stoppages in the ports The Leninsky Komsomol was underway 77 days about - it was even less time then was allotted by Jules Verne (80 days). Can be it was a record time for the merchant ships for that time and eny way was the record for Soviet Union merchant ships. =1973 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War= The Yom Kippur War, Ramadan War, or October War, also known as the 1973 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, was a war fought by the coalition of Arab states led by Egypt and Syria against Israel from October 6 to 25, 1973. The ship Leninsky Komsomol was one of eight Leninsky Komsomol class of cargo ships which carried out military cargo to Siria and Egypt in October and November, 1973. Also Soviet ships took part in this carriage. According to U.S. information the ship Leninsky Komsomol one time carried military cargo in Egypt: the ship passed Bosphorus on the 26 and arrived Alexandria on the 28 of October, 1973. =Other voyages= To see photo: Soviet ship Leninsky Komsomol at Illichivsk ship's repair dock in 1966.

Her married name was Louise M. Nathanson. The daughter of Lujza Eberhardt, a concert pianist, and John Meiszner, a flautist, both immigrants from Hungary, she was born in St. Louis, Missouri. A child prodigy, she began playing the piano at the age of three and gave her first public concert at the age of five. In 1930, the family moved back to Hungary, where she attended the Franz Liszt Academy of Music for eight years. At the age of thirteen, she was invited by Austrian composer Erich Kleiber to perform with his orchestra as a soloist. In 1938, she returned to the United States and appeared in concert with the Kansas City Philharmonic. She continued her education at the Juilliard School, graduating in May 1945. In the same year, she received the Leventritt Award. Meiszner performed with most of major orchestras in the United States and Europe, including the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the Budapest Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1959, she married Martin Jay Nathanson, an Illinois businessman; the couple had one child and Meiszner retired from performing. When her son Kevin began playing the flute during the early 1970s, she began playing again to accompany him. She also on occasion accompanied musicians performing in the Quad Cities area. During the 1980s, she began teaching part-time at Augustana College and Rivermont Collegiate. Meiszner died at the Trinity Medical Center in Rock Island, Illinois at the age of 83.

This species is very similar to Rhizopus stolonifer, but it can be distinguished by its smaller sporangia and air-dispersed sporangiospores. It differs from R. oligosporus and R. microsporus by its larger columellae and sporangiospores. R. oryzae is used economically in the production of the enzymes, glucoamylase and lipase, in the synthesis of organic acids, and in various fermented foods. The many strains of R. oryzae produce a wide range of enzymes such as carbohydrate digesting enzymes and polymers along with a number of organic acids, ethanol and esters giving it useful properties within the food industries, bio-diesel production, and pharmaceutical industries. It is also an opportunistic pathogen of humans causing mucormycosis. History and taxonomy Rhizopus oryzae was discovered by Frits Went and Hendrik Coenraad Prinsen Geerligs in 1895. The genus Rhizopus (family Mucoraceae) was erected in 1821 by the German mycologist, Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg to accommodate Mucor stolonifer and Rhizopus nigricans as distinct from the genus Mucor. The genus Rhizopus is characterized by having stolons, rhizoids, sporangiophores sprouting from the points of which rhizoids were attached, globose sporangia with columellae, striated sporangiospores. In the mid 1960s, researchers divided the genus based on temperature tolerance. Numerical methods were later used in the early 1970s where researchers arrived at similar conclusions. R. oryzae was relegated to a distinct section because it grew well at 37 ¬∞C but failed to grow at 45 ¬∞C. In the past, strains were identified through isolating active components of the species that were commonly found in food and alcoholic drinks in Indonesia, China, and Japan. There are approximately 30 synonyms, the most common being R. arrhizus. Scholer popularized R. oryzae because he thought R. arrhizus represented an extreme form of R. oryzae. Growth and morphology Rhizopus oryzae is characterized to be a fast growing fungus where growth under optimal temperatures is fast at 1.6mm per hour (nearly 0.5 Œºm per second - enough to be able to directly visualize hyphal elongation in real-time under the microscope). R. oryzae can grow in temperature of 7 ¬∞C to 44 ¬∞C and the optimum growth temperature is 37 ¬∞C. There is very poor growth from 10 ¬∞C to 15 ¬∞C and no growth is observed at 45 ¬∞C. In a NaCl solution, there is good growth at a 1% NaCl concentration and there is very poor growth of the mycelia in media containing 3% NaCl. There is also no growth seen in a 5% NaCl solution. R. oryzae favors acidic media where good growth is observed at a pH of 6.8 and in the range of 7.7-8.1 there is very poor growth. Most amino acids, with the exception of L-valine, promote R. oryzae growth with L-tryptophan and L-tyrosine being the most effective. It also grows well on mineral nitrogen sources, except nitrate, and can utilize urea. Rhizopus oryzae has variable sporangiosphores. They can be straight or curved, swollen or branched, and the walls can be smooth or slightly rough. The colour of sporangiosphores range from pale brown to brown. Sporangiosphores grow between 210-2500 Œºm in length and 5-18 Œºm in diameter. The sporangia in R. oryzae are globose or subglobose, wall spinous and black when mature, 60-180 Œºm in diameter. They can be distinguishable from Rhizopus stolonifer as they have smaller sporangia and spores. The optimal conditions for sporangium production are temperatures between 30 ¬∞C to 35 ¬∞C and low water levels. Sporulation is stimulated by amino acids (except L-valine) when grown in light, while in darkness only L-tryptophan and L-methionine effect stimulation of growth. The columellae are globose, subglobose, or oval in shape. The wall is usually smooth and the colour is pale brown. The average diameter growth ranges from 30-110 Œºm. Sporangiospores are elliptical, globose, or polygonal, they are striated and grow 5-8 Œºm in length. Dormant and germinated sporangiospores show deep furrows and prominent ridges with a pattern that makes it distinguishable from that of R. stolonifer. The germination of sporangiospores can be induced by the combined action of L-proline and phosphate ions. L-ornithine, L-arginine, D-glucose and D-mannose are also effective. Optimal germination occurs on media containing D-glucose and mineral salts.R. oryzae has abundant, root-shaped rhizoids. Zygospores are produced by diploid cells when sexual reproduction occurs under nutrient poor conditions. They have colors that range from red to brown, they are spherical or laterally flattened, and ranges from 60-140Œºm in size. In high nutrient levels, R. oryzae reproduces asexually, producing azygospores. The stolons found in R. oryzae are smooth or slightly rough, almost colorless or pale brown, 5-18 Œºm in diameter. The chlamydospores are abundant, globose ranging in 10-24 Œºm in diameter, elliptical, and cylindrical. Colonies of R. oryzae are white initially, becoming brownish with age and can grow to about 1 cm thick. Habitat and ecology Rhizopus oryzae can be found in various soils across the world. For example, it has been found in India, Pakistan, New Guinea, Taiwan, Central America, Peru, Argentina, Namibia, South Africa, Iraq, Somalia, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Israel, Turkey, Spain, Italy, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Ukraine, British Isles, and USA. The soils where R. oryzae has been isolated are varied ranging from grassland, cultivated soils under lupin, corn, wheat, groundnuts, other legumes, sugar canes, rice, citrus plantations, steppe type vegetation, alkaline soils, salt-marshes, farm manure soils, to sewage filled soils. The pH of the soils where the species has been isolated typically range from 6.3 to 7.2. Rhizopus oryzae is isolated from foods, often identified as R. arrhizus. It is found in rotting fruits and vegetables where it is often called R. stolonifer. Unlike the other species such as R. stolonifer, R. oryzae is common in tropical conditions. In East Asia, it is common in peanuts. For instance, there was 21% isolation from peanut kernels from Indonesia. It is present in maize, beans, sorghum, and cowpeas, pecans, hazelnuts, pistachios, wheat, barley, potatoes, sapodillas, and various other tropical foods. Maize meal on which isolates of R. oryzae had been grown was found to be toxic to ducklings and rats, causing growth depression. Pathogenicity Rhizopus oryzae commonly causes a disease known as mucormycosis characterized by growing hyphae within and surrounding blood vessels. The causal agents of mucormycosis is the ergot alkaloid agroclavine which is toxic to humans, sheep and cattle. This infection usually occurs in immunocompromised individuals but is rare. Common risk factors associated with primary cutaneous mucormycosis is ketoacidosis, neutropenia, acute lymphobloastic leukemia, lymphomas, systemic steroids, chemotherapy, and dialysis. Treatment includes amphotericin B, posaconazole, itraconazole, and fluconazole. The majority of the cases of infection are rhinocerebral infections. At the same time, it has been found in literature that R. oryzae can produce antibiotic activity on some bacteria. In Indonesia, where white cakes are commonly consumed are made from coconut and fermented with R. oryzae, traditionally called \\"bongkrek\\" caused food poisoning. Symptoms included hypoglycemia, severe spasms, convulsions, and death. The pathogenicity towards plants is attributed to the presence of large number of carbohydrate digesting enzymes. Physiology and industrial uses Rhizopus oryzae is involved in steroid transformations and it produces 4-desmethyl steroids which has been useful in the fermentation industry. The carbon sources does influence the ratio of polar and neutral lipids. The mycelium found in R. oryzae contains lipids and the highest lipid content occurs when grown on fructose. The highest unsaturated fatty acid content is observed at 30 ¬∞C and lowest at 15 ¬∞C. Proteolytic properties have been observed well under the conditions of pH 7 at 35 ¬∞C. Pyridozine and thiamine prefer proteinase production. R. oryzae can degrade aflatoxin A1 to isomeric hydroxy compounds and aflatoxin G1 to fluorescent metabolite aflatoxin A1. There are various factors that influence the production of dextro-lactic acids, fumaric acid, and metabolism of R. oryzae. For examples, in 40 ¬∞C there is more favorable growth for glucose consumption, however this influenced production of d-lactic acid production negatively. Glucose concentration of 15% is needed for optimal production of d-lactic acid. Fumaric acid production was suppressed in media containing more than 6 grams of NH4NO3 per liter and is favorable to d-lactic acid production. Rhizopus oryzae is considered GRAS by the FDA and thus recognized as safe to use industrially as it can consume a range of carbon sources. During fermentation. R. oryzae produce amylase, lipase, and protease activity to increase nutrient's ability to use many compounds as an energy and carbon source. Historically, it has been used in fermentation, specifically to ferment soybean and create tempeh in Malaysia and Indonesia. Using the same methods to create traditional tempeh, R. oryzae can be inoculated in other cooked legumes such as peas, beans, and fava beans. Similarly in tempeh making, there is an initial bacterial fermentation in legumes when they are soaked for a while before being cooked. Fermentation incubation lasts for 48 hours at 33 ¬∞C. After incubation, mycelium can be observed between the legumes creating a larger, uniform product. Overall, fruits, grains, nuts, and legumes mold-fermentation with R. oryzae produces sensory changes in foods such as creating acidity, sweetness and bitterness. R. oryzae can produce lactate from glucose at high levels, which is used as a food additive and can also degrade plastics. In enzyme modified cheese products,R. oryzae provides microbial enzymes where milk fat and proteins are broken down to create powder and paste forms of cheese. Specifically, it breaks down cheese curds and acid casein. Among finding cellulases and hemicellulases, other enzymes such as protease, urease, ribonuclease, pectate lyase, and polygalacturonase are found in cultural media of R. oryzae. Besides producing a number of enzymes, it can also produce a number of organic acids, alcohol, and esters. Cellulases in R. oryzae can be applied to biotechnology, in food, brewery and wine, animal feed, textiles and laundry, pulp and paper industries, and agriculture. R. oryzae can convert both glucose and xylose under aerobic conditions into pure L (+)-lactic acids with by-products such as xylitol, glycerol, ethanol, carbon dioxide and fungal biomass. Endo-xylanase is a key enzyme for xylan depolymerization and was produced by R. oryzae fermentation from different xylan-containing agricultural by-products such as wheat straw, wheat stems, cottons bagasse, hazelnut shells, corn cobs, and oat sawdust. Pectinases are required for extraction and clarification of fruit juices and wines, extraction of oils, flavors and pigmentation from plant material, preparation of cellulose fibers for linen, jute and hemp manufacture as well as, coffee and tea fermentations. R. oryzae can break down starch content in rice plants and therefore shows amylolytic activities. Also, it has been reported to produce extra cellular isoamylase which is used in food industries. Isoamylase was found to saccharify potato starch, arrow root, tamarind kernel, tapioca, and oat. The saccharifying ability of the enzyme is highly applicable in sugar production industries. Proteases, which can be found in R. oryzae are highly useful in commercial industries. For instance, it has increased application in food, pharmaceutical, detergent, leather, tanning industries. It is also involved in silver recovery and peptide synthesis. One strain of R. oryzae was found to secrete alkaline serine protease which shows high pH stability within 3 to 6 and poor thermos- stability. Lipase that is extracted from R. oryzae have been consumed as digestive aids without adverse reactions. Lipases hydrolyze fats and oils with subsequent release of free fatty acids such as diacylglycerols, monoacylglycerols and glycerol. Lipases have been involved in biotechnology applications because of its ability to catalyze synthetic reactions in non- aqueous solutions. One study has reported the expression of a fungal 11 alpha- steroid hydroxylase from R. oryzae which can be used to perform the 11 alpha- hydroxylation of the steroid skeleton which has simplified steroid drug production.R. oryzae can produce intracellular ribonuclease in a metal ion- regulated liquid medium with the addition of calcium and molybdenum stimulating ribonuclease production. R. oryzae strain ENHE isolated from contaminated soil was found to be capable of tolerating and removing pentachlorophenol. R. oryzae is known to produce L (+)-lactic acid because the fungus cells possess better resistance to high concentration of accumulated lactic acid and lower content of nutrient requirement compared to the commonly used bacterial procedures. Thus, R. oryzae is the most efficient approached to improve lactic acid production process that facilitates multiple reuses of fungal cells for long-term lactic acid production. Ethanol is the main by- product in the fermentation process of R. oryzae during the production of L-lactic acid. R. oryzae can be used as a biocatalyst for ester production in organic solvent. Dry mycelium of four R. oryzae strains proved effective for catalysing the synthesis of different flavor esters. For example, the pineapple flavour or butyl acetate esters was produced by the esterification reactions between acetic acid and butanol by R. oryzae. This flavor compound can be used in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. Within the biodiesel industry, biodiesel fuel as fatty acid methyl ester is produced by the esterification of plant oil or animal fat with methanol. This is a renewable fuel resource compared to the traditional petroleum-based fuels. Production of biodiesel fuel from plant oils from cells of R. oryzae immobilized within biomass support particles were investigated for the methanolysis of soybean oil. Olive oil or oleic acid was found to be effective for enhancing methanolysis activity which is a promising results within the biodiesel industry.

It is managed by the Foodsharing association (foodsharing e.V.) and was founded on December 12, 2012. On foodsharing.de individuals, retailers and producers can offer or collect food that would otherwise be thrown away. This service is completely free, and functions thanks to volunteer work. The project's goal is to fight everyday food waste and to raise awareness about this problem in society.  History  The original idea to create a platform against food waste arose between Valentin Thurn, director of the film Taste the Waste, and Sebastian Engbrocks, supervisor of the film's social media campaign, in the summer of 2011. In early 2012 the design students Thomas Gerling and Christian Zehnter, and television journalist Ines Rainer, independently came up with a similar idea. The joint project is the result of the collaboration of all these individuals. From April to July 2012 they raised the necessary starting capital through crowdfunding via Startnext.de. The goal was to collect 10.000 EUR and in the end 11.594 EUR was received from 394 supporters.Project description at Startnext Crowdfunding (in German), Retrieved: 6 February 2014.

As of February 2014 the German foodsharing.de has attracted close to 35.000 active users.foodsharing.de: foodsharing.de (in German), Retrieved: 9 February 2014. It won the Greentec Award in the communication category on July 10, 2013.Greentec Awards: Awards 2013 - Category Communication (in German), Retrieved: 6 February 2014. In December 2014, foodsharing.de and lebensmittelretten.de, a website founded by Raphael Fellmer and Raphael Wintrich, merged their operations. The functionality for sharing food with other individuals was taken from foodsharing.de, while the collaborations with shops and supermarkets was taken from lebensmittelretten.de. In 2018 and 2019, the team behind www.foodsharing.de published the source code and worked on the development of a mobile app.  Concept  foodsharing.de enables individuals to share food, whilst also allowing volunteers to pick up food from businesses to distribute it through public storage places, so called fairteiler. Since most supermarkets are organized as chains and therefore each branch has to follow standardized rules and regulations, the management is contacted directly.Foodsharing sites and apps stop leftovers going to waste, Retrieved: 18 January 2016 This results in regional and sometimes even national collaborations,foodsharing.de: These companies participate (in German), Retrieved: 6 February 2014. e.g. with Bio Company.Bio Company: Raises awareness against waste (in German), Retrieved: 6 February 2014. There are also many local co-operations with single supermarkets or bakeries, which are often started independently by members of the community. Additionally, foodsavers also collect surplus food from businesses at large events such as Christmas markets.  Foodsharer vs. Foodsaver  Everyone is invited to sign up as a foodsharer on the official website. As soon as an account is created, individuals can see other peoples' so called \\"Essenskorb\\" (engl. Foodbasket) and pick up surplus food from private individuals. They can of course also offer their own surplus food. In order to become a Foodsaver, one has to pass a test regarding hygiene and behavioural rules and can then apply to become a member of a group that regularly pick up food from cooperating businesses.  Differentiation from other methods of foodsaving  Other organizations like the German Tafel differ from foodsharing in that in the latter, the surplus food is given to people before date expires. Whereas with foodsharing.de expired food is also distributed if it is still edible and does not pose a health risk. Volunteers (so-called 'foodsavers') need to sign a legal agreement that renders the businesses not liable and obliges the foodsavers to pass on the food for free. While the main focus of Tafel is to assert if someone is in need, foodsharing.de is interested only in saving food, without focusing on the financial circumstances of the recipient.https://foodlocate.com/blog/foodsharing-rette-lebensmittel Foodsharing In contrast to dumpster diving, which is about taking non-spoiled food from waste containers, foodsaving.de wants to prevent food from being thrown away in the first place.

She is known for her 2009 documentary Boul Fall√©, la Voie de la lutte and her most recent documentary The Revolution Won‚Äôt be Televised (2016).  Personal life and education  Rama Thiaw was born April 30, 1978 in Nouakchott, Mauritania to Mauritanian and Senegalese parents. Thiaw spent her first five years in Nouakchott (Quartier 5), before going to Pikine, in the suburb of Dakar, the capital of Senegal. After her parents‚Äô divorce, she began splitting her time living in Senegal and France. Thiaw obtained a master's degree in International Economics at the Sorbonne in Paris. She then began to develop an interest in cinema, which led her to receive a diploma in filmmaking from the University of Paris 8 and later on, another master's degree at the University of Paris 3 at Censier Daubenton.  Career  After completing her post- secondary education, Thiaw met with Algerian filmmaker Mohamed Boumari (assistant on the film La Bataille d‚ÄôAlger) in 2002 with whom she participated in a production workshop. Thereafter, Thiaw collaborated with Zal√©a TV where she made a series of film portraits on the inhabitants of the French commune, Aubervilliers and their poor housing conditions. This series was then followed up by a 15-minute documentary short titled Les jeunes de quartier et la religion. Thiaw was the assistant of communications of Fabienne Godet's producer, on the film Burnt Out starring Marion Cotillard in 2006. While still in France, Thiaw met French producer Philippe Lac√¥te who agreed to work with her on what would be Thiaw's first feature-length documentary film. Her film Boul Fall√©, la Voie de la lutte was released in 2009. The film follows the ‚Äúrevival of traditional wrestling‚Äù in the suburbs of Dakar, where Thiaw grew up and ‚Äúconsiders the sport‚Äôs influence in terms of the recent social and political transformations in Senegal‚Äù revolving around the Senegalese Independence. Additional to creating parallels between Senegal's wrestling and politics, Thiaw draws upon the expression found in Senegalese reggae and hip hop. In 2010, Thiaw began production on her second documentary feature entitled The Revolution Won‚Äôt be Televised (2016), the title based on the poem by musician Gil Scott-Heron. This second work maintained the political and social Senegalese discourse as her previous film, however revolving primarily around the rise of the apolitical group ‚ÄúY‚Äôen a Marre‚Äù (We‚Äôre Fed Up‚Äù), led by rappers Thiat and Kilifeu. The documentary followed Y‚Äôen a Marre's protests against President Abdoulaye Wade‚Äôs continuous run for presidency. The Revolution Won't be Televised was screened at the Berlin International Film Festival in February 2016, winning the Fipresci Prize and a special mention in the Caligari Filmpreis.http://www.fipresci.org/people/rama- thiawhttp://www.marianne.net/sono-mondiale/les-paves-poesie-100241059.html  Filmography  * Boul Fall√©, la Voie de la lutte, 2009, director Rama Thiaw.

Chibber is the author of two books, Postcolonial Theory and the Specter of Capital (Verso, 2013) and Locked in Place: State- Building and Late Industrialization in India (Princeton, 2003). In 2017, Chibber launched Catalyst: A Journal of Theory and Strategy, with Robert Brenner, published by Jacobin magazine. Early life Chibber was born in India in 1965, and moved to United States in 1980, where he has lived since. He completed a BA in political science in 1987 at Northwestern University. In 1999, he finished his PhD in sociology at the University of Wisconsin, where his dissertation was supervised by Erik Olin Wright. Chibber began as an assistant professor at New York University in 1999, where is now a full professor. Career Chibber‚Äôs first book, Locked in Place, attempted to answer why some countries were able to build \\"developmental states\\" in the decades after World War II while others were not. He argued that the literature on developmental state had unduly ignored the constraints that class power imposed on state-building, particularly the power and influence of domestic capitalists. Chibber showed that the main reason Indian industrial policy only met with middling success was that domestic capital blocked attempts to build an effective planning apparatus. Whereas in South Korea, the state managed to build an alliance with domestic business houses around industrial planning. Chibber‚Äôs book was widely acclaimed and won several awards including, in 2005, Barrington Moore Book Award, and honorable mention for the American Sociological Association‚Äôs Distinguished Publication Prize. =Criticism of postcolonialism= Soon after Locked in Place, Chibber‚Äôs agenda took a turn when, in 2006, he published ‚ÄúOn The Decline of Class Analysis In South Asian Studies‚Äù in Critical Asian Studies. This article examined the sociological conditions for the decline of class analysis and its displacement by postcolonial theory in the South Asian context. While Chibber located the demise of class in the social conditions of the 1980s and 1990s, he did not in this article take on the content of postcolonial theory itself. This engagement came in his second book, Postcolonial Theory and the Specter of Capital. In the Preface to the book, Chibber explains that once he examined the conditions that gave rise to postcolonial theory, he felt that he also had to examine its core arguments. Postcolonial Theory and the Specter of Capital was focused on one particular strand of theorizing, namely the Subaltern Studies collective. Chibber took Subaltern Studies as a representative of the key sociological and historical arguments in postcolonial studies. His basic argument in the book is that, even though postcolonial theory advertises itself as a critique of Orientalism and Eurocentrism, in fact the theory ends up resurrecting them. In other words, postcolonial theory gives new life to Orientalist notions of the Global South, by presenting a highly exoticized and essentialized understanding of it ‚Äì as fundamentally different from the West, incapable of being understood by Western categories, its people untouched by reason and rationality, etc. Chibber bases his claims on an examination of the Subalternists‚Äô historical sociology as well as their theoretical arguments. He embeds his critique in a defense of the radical Enlightenment tradition as represented by Marx. The publication of Specter touched off a very intense and wide-ranging debate between Chibber, members of the Subaltern Studies collective, and other intellectuals. Most prominently, Partha Chatterjee and Gayatri Spivak both criticized Chibber for his representation of the Subalternists‚Äô work and postcolonial theory more generally. Chibber responded in turn, denying that he had misrepresented his interlocutors and launching a counterattack of his own. The ensuing debate was collected and published by Verso Books in 2016 as Rosie Warren (ed.), The Debate on Postcolonial Theory and the Specter of Capital. =Catalyst= In the spring of 2017, Chibber and Robert Brenner launched as well as assumed the editorial duties for the journal Catalyst: A Journal of Theory and Strategy. Published by Jacobin Magazine, Chibber and Brenner wrote of their intent for the new publication: > Discussion of capitalism is not off the table any longer. Catalyst: A > Journal of Theory and Strategy launches with the aim of doing everything it > can to promote and deepen this conversation. Our focus is, as our title > suggests, to develop a theory and strategy with capitalism as its target ‚Äî > both in the North and in the Global South.

Biography = Early life = Mizushima was born into a wealthy family; her mother's family had a bookstore where she would consult novels. In 1960 (at the age of 13), she was introduced to Nobuko Yoshiya, a commercially successful novelist who specialized in serialized romance novels for teenage girls and is known to be the pioneer of Japanese lesbian literature. These serials are what made Mizushima want to become a novelist. At the age of 14, she contributes to the local newspaper and a magazine. At the age of 18, she enters the Japanese Women College in home economics. On September 1, 1923, the Great Kanto earthquake strikes and Mizushima is affected in her region. = Career = Mizushima was born by the name of Chitose Takano. Her pen name was created upon the release of The Song of the Fallen Leaves (Ogasawara, 1924), a film for which she wrote the script, in order to avoid expulsion from Japan Women's University, where viewing films (and therefore partaking in any production) was prohibited. She received on screen credit for this film, making her the first Japanese woman to have been recognized as a screenwriter. She worked at the Shochiku Kamata Studios until 1935, when it moved to ≈åfuna. She is known for writing melodramas and comedies and has credit for 29 screenplays. In 1928, she wrote the screenplay for Sora No Kanata (Beyond the Sky), based on the novel by Nobuko Yoshiya. Her last film, Kagayate Shonen Nihon (Shine On! Boy Japan), was her first and only talkie. Therefore, the advent of sound in film coincides with the end of her career as a screenwriter. She then retired to become a children's writer until 1955.

Founded in 1883 as Pickands Mather & Company, it once had the second largest shipping fleet on the Great Lakes in the 1910s and 1920s. The company was purchased by the Diamond Shamrock Corporation in 1968, which in turn sold it to the Moore-McCormack Resources in 1973. Moore-McCormack sold Pickands Mather's mining interests to Cleveland-Cliffs in 1986. Moore-McCormack then spun off the Interlake Steamship Company to James Barker (former CEO of Moore- McCormack) and Paul R. Tregurtha (former CFO of Moore-McCormack) in 1987. Pickands Mather was sold to a management group in 1992, and continues to operate as a private company. History Pickands Mather and Company was formed in 1883 by James Pickands, Samuel Mather, and Jay C. Morse. Pickands had risen to the rank of colonel in the 124th Ohio Volunteer Infantry during the American Civil War. In 1867, he moved to Marquette, Michigan, where he opened a hardware store selling tools and supplies to iron mining companies. He opened a fuel coal supply business three years later. He was elected mayor of Marquette in 1875, and five years later formed the Taylor Iron Co. (an iron mining concern) with Jay C. Morse. After Pickands' wife died in 1882, he moved to Cleveland. Jay C. Morse was a shipping agent for the Cleveland Iron Mining Company in Marquette. He invested widely in Michigan iron mines, and by 1882 was a wealthy man ready to form his own company. Samuel Mather was the son of Samuel Livingston Mather, founder of the Cleveland Iron Mining Company. While recuperating from a mining accident, he met and married Flora Stone, daughter of Cleveland industrialist and railroad magnate Amasa Stone. Determined to make his own fortune and impress his father-in-law, Mather sought out business partners. Pickands Mather and Company was formed in 1883, dealing in iron ore and pig iron, and mining iron ore from two mines in the Marquette Iron Range. In the 1880s and 1890s, Pickands Mather rapidly added to their iron mine holdings, and expanded into coal mining, iron ore and coal shipping, dock ownership, and the manufacture of coke and iron and steel rolling mills. In April 1886, Mather hired local stenographer Harry Coulby, who swiftly worked his way up in the corporate ranks to become head of the company's Marine Department. After some years leasing and managing the freighters of other companies, in 1894 Pickands Mather formed the Interlake Company (later the Interlake Steamship Company). By 1912, Interlake had grown to be the second- largest shipping fleet on the Great Lakes, with 37 freighters. The Interlake fleet expanded to 52 ships in 1916. After 1900, Pickands Mather began acquiring blast furnaces to manufacture pig iron, and continued to expand its iron mining interests. By the 1920s, the company was the second-largest iron mining company in the United States. It formed a subsidiary, the Interlake Iron Corp., to hold its smelters, and expanded coal mining into Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. In the 1930s, Pickands Mather began researching how to turn taconite into a usable form of iron ore. This research bore fruit in the 1940s, and Pickands Mather formed the Erie Mining Co. process taconite into usable taconite pellets. Pickands Mather was making large profits from taconite within a decade. Coulby died in 1929 and Mather in 1931. Elton Hoyt II, who had succeeded Coulby as head of the Marine Department in 1929, became president and chief executive officer of Pickands Mather in 1939. He died in March 1955, and was succeeded by John Sherwin. To enable the company to better meet the challenges of the rapidly changing economic environment, Sherwin incorporated Pickands Mather in 1960. In 1968, Sherwin engineered the sale of Pickands Mather to the Diamond Shamrock Corporation, a Cleveland-based shipping, chemical manufacturing, and oil refining and consumer sales company. Diamond Shamrock held the company for just four years. In December 1972, Diamond Shamrock sold Pickands Mather for $66 million to the Moore-McCormack Company, operator of a large fleet of international freighters and some of the last American-owned passenger ocean liners. (The sale did not include Pickands Mather's chemical manufacturing arm.) The sale was consummated by 36-year-old James R. Barker, Moore-McCormack's CEO and a former mid-level manager in the Marine Vessel Department of Pickands Mather from 1963 to 1967. Paul R. Tregurtha, Moore-McCormack's chief financial officer, oversaw the financing of the purchase. In the 1970s, Interlake disposed of a large number of its smaller ships and built three long Great Lakes freighters: the James R. Barker, the Mesabi Miner, and the William De Lancey. In 1973, Elton Hoyt III was named president and chief executive officer of Pickands Mather, a position he held until his retirement in 1983. Continuing downward price pressure on commodities and shipping rates significantly harmed Pickands Mather's revenues in the 1970s and 1980s. In July 1986, LTV Steel (the successor company to the Jones and Laughlin Steel Company and Republic Steel) filed for bankruptcy, citing $4 billion in debt. The economic shock to the Pickands Mather's iron and coal investments caused by the default of one of the largest consumers of its products deeply alarmed Moore-McCormack Resources (the successor to the Moore-McCormack Company). Moore-McCormack sold the iron and coal mining businesses of Pickands Mather to Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. in November 1986 for an undisclosed sum. The price was later revealed to be 2 million barrels of oil and natural gas reserves owned by Cleveland-Cliffs. Cleveland Cliffs (later Cliffs Natural Resources) appointed George Newcombe Chandler II the president of the Pickands Mather subsidiary in 1987. He retired from the company in 2000. Moore-McCormack, however, retained control of the Interlake Steamship Company. But in early 1987, Barker resigned from Moore-McCormack and bought the Interlake Steamship Company from Moore- McCormack. Paul R. Tregurtha joined Barker in managing the company, which was now a privately held company. Pickands Mather was sold by Cliffs in 1992 in a private transaction to management.

Attached to the Samaveda, it is one of twenty Yoga Upanishads in the four Vedas. The text is notable for its discussions of Kundalini yoga. History The text has been a reference for studies on Kundalini theories and tantra traditions.SS Saraswati (2003), Yoga chudamani Upanishad: Crown Jewel of Yoga, Yoga Publications, Richard Rosen dates Yogachudamani Upanishad to about 14th- to 15th-century CE.Richard Rosen (2006), Pranayama beyond the Fundamentals, Shambala, , page 184 Swami Satyadharma Saraswati says that this Upanishad is an advanced treatise for higher sadhana or learning for Yogins. Its Kundalini discussion has been a precursor to related books on the subject. It is also referred to as Yoga- cudamany Upanishad and Yogachudamanupanisad (‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó‡§ö‡•Ç‡§°‡§æ‡§Æ‡§£‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Å‡§™‡§®‡§ø‡§∑‡§§‡•ç). It is listed at number 46 in the serial order of the Muktika enumerated by Rama to Hanuman in the modern era anthology of 108 Upanishads, and in printed in 1883 in the Telugu language though with some errors The Upanishad under the Sama Veda is one of the ten Upanishads of the Raja Yoga genre. Contents The Upanishad is mostly poetic verses, and structured as one chapter with one hundred and twenty one verses. The opening verses of the text assert its goal to be the attainment of Kaivalya (liberating aloneness). The first seventy verses present its theories of Kundalini yoga including a discussion of chakras (energy centers), nadis (blood and energy vessels), prana vayus (life force air), mudras and shakti (power).Daren Callahan (2007), Yoga: An Annotated Bibliography of Works in English 1981-2005, McFarland, , page 289 The rest of the text describes meditative exercises with Om, asserting that enlightenment is achievable by combining Hatha yoga, Kundalini yoga and reflection on one's innermost consciousness. In the closing verses, the text asserts that just like a lion or elephant can be tamed in slow stages, various illness of the body can be tamed with asanas and breathing exercises, and state of liberating consciousness and mental fortitude achieved with higher limbs of yoga. The Upanishad states that there are 72,000 nerves emanating from the location, which is below the navel but over the procreation organ in the form of an \\"egg-like bulb or knot,\\" known as the nerve center, of which only 72 have been named. The text is notable for its discussion of sexual fluids over verses 55 to 64, calling it bindu of two colors: Shukla (pale white, male) and Rajas (red, female). The text asserts that both have creative powers, the Shukla is Brahman (universal principle) and the Rajas is the Shakti (energy, power). The highest state of union is the unification of these two in Yoni-mudra, according to the text. In later verses, the female and the male continue to be a part of its discussion, stating Para Shakti as the essence of pure radiance, Brahma as mobility, Vishnu as rhythm, Rudra as inertia, and Indra as enjoyment. The text asserts that these deities are present in Pranava syllable (Om mantra) it discusses for meditation.

Synopsis During the First World War, Canadian aviators made their mark as combat pilots. After the war, many of them became part of the Royal Canadian Air Force, taking on peacetime roles of mapping the frontiers and forest fire patrols. Bush pilots built a system of commercial flying that led to Trans-Canada Air Lines, a transcontinental airline. When war came again, veterans took on the task of training a new generation of aviators in the Commonwealth Air Training Plan. While youth sign up and begin training, the Commonwealth Air Training Plan bases are being constructed across the country. In Canadian aircraft factories, training aircraft such as the North American Harvard are being manufactured to add to those sent from Great Britain, including the Fairey Battle and Avro Anson. To train for the modern aerial combat environment, pilots undergo a rigorous ground training program that includes classroom work, high altitude chambers and Link Trainer simulation sessions. After initial flying training, the successful candidates complete a solo flight in the Canadian designed and built Fleet Finch trainer, before going on to advanced flight training. Other air crew learn how to navigate, drop armament and fire weapons in other simulated training programs. Mechanics also have to learn all the skills required to repair and maintain an aircraft. When pilots, ground crew and air crew trainees have completed their training, they receive their \\"wings\\" at a special graduation ceremony often presided over by high ranking RCAF officers such as Air Marshal Billy Bishop.

When he was an extra on the set of the action film Wolverine while it was filming in British Columbia, he became intrigued by filmmaking. He had always been a fan of directors such as Christopher Nolan, Rob Zombie, and Martin Scorsese, and began writing several films of his own. He produced and acted in a few short films, then expanded into writing and recording some hip hop music and creating some music videos, releasing tracks such as \\"Dear Nas\\", \\"Rap Wars\\", and \\"Dying Gods\\". In 2014, he also branched into comic book writing, creating (with the assistance of artist Aaron Foster) his own comic book Diaries of the Invasion.

Early years Celia Joyce was born in 1914, the daughter of barrister Henry Stephen Guy Buckmaster. In her twenties, she and a friend, poet Lynette Roberts, went into business, setting up as florists. At some point they took time off from the business and traveled by cargo boat to Madeira, where they lived for a time. Roberts began writing poetry seriously, and Celia may have worked on her painting, because she was referred to as a promising painter only a few years later. On their return journey to England, their ship, the cruise liner Hilary, ran aground in fog at Carmel Head. In 1940, she married anthropologist Edmund Leach, who was then in the military; the marriage took place in Rangoon, Burma, where Leach was stationed. They had a daughter, Louisa in 1941, and Buckmaster spent time both writing and painting. As World War II intensified in the region, Buckmaster escaped with her daughter, leaving as part of an airlift of nursing mothers in early 1942. Reunited at the end of the war, the couple had a son, Alexander in 1946. Writing Beginning around 1940, Buckmaster published poems in magazines such as Poetry: London, Twentieth Century Verse, and Seven. She also published at least one short story and a book review of a novel by Neil M. Gunn in Wales magazine. In the early 1950s, Buckmaster published her only two novels, Village Story (1951) and Family Ties (1952), both with the prestigious Hogarth Press founded by Leonard Woolf and Virginia Woolf. Village Story was praised by the writers John Betjeman and Stevie Smith when it first appeared. Both novels focus on life in an English village, following the dynamics of various relationships with a mixture of warmth and wry humor that recalls such contemporary writers as Barbara Pym. Buckmaster and Leach spent a lot of 1961 in California, where Buckmaster returned to painting. In 1966 Edmund Leach became Provost of King's College, Cambridge. After his retirement, he and his wife settled in the nearby village of Barrington. Leach died in 1989 and Buckmaster in 2005.

She performed in several of Vienna‚Äôs most prestigious concert venues and made several recordings. Life She was born Malka Kanarvogel in Rzeszow, Poland, on September 12, 1875. She studied music performance at the Vienna Conservatory, and changed her name to a more operatic-sounding \\"Amalia Carneri\\". In her private life she used the name Amalie. She married government mine inspector Heinrich (Henryk) Pollak (b. June 7, 1877 in Krakow, d. October 7, 1938) in Vienna at the Seitenstettengasse synagogue. Together they had two sons. Fritz (Fred), who became a design engineer, was born on February 28, 1909, and Karl (Charles), who became an engineering professor for the University of Rhode Island, was born on January 15, 1920, both in Vienna. Carneri had an international singing career which included tours of Austria, France, Germany, and Hungary. The locations of her performances included the Deutsches Theater in Plze≈à, the Eden Theater in Strasbourg, and the Stadttheater, Landestheater, Carl-Theater, and the Volkstheater in Vienna. Between 1905 and 1907 she made several phonograph recordings for Edison Records, Odeon Records and Zonophone Records. Her initial mention in the Vienna newspaper Neue Freie Presse was very positive, describing a successful recital in 1898 that was met with enthusiasm by the public. Her last apartment was in Vienna's Untere Donaustra√üe 33, right at the Danube Canal. She was expelled from Vienna on September 10, 1942 and interned at the Theresienstadt concentration camp. From there, on September 29, 1942, at the age of 68, she was taken by Holocaust train to the Treblinka extermination camp along with 2001 other prisoners, none of whom survived.

He was a leader in the Shanghai Green Gang, Chief of Intelligence under the political leader Chen Qimei's provisional Shanghai Military Government, Chief Inspector of Jiangsu Province, and later Commander of Sun Yat-sen's Presidential Guard. He was also closely associated with Yuan Shikai's government. Ying Guixin was directly involved in the assassination of Song Jiaoren who had been deemed a threat by various political factions loyal to Yuan Shikai. He was born in Ningbo into a family whose fortune derived from stoneworks and land. This enabled him to be well-educated to the point that he even knew English. Unable to take the Imperial examinations when they were abolished in 1905 he moved to Shanghai and became wealthy in his own right through large real estate holdings. It was probably around this time he became involved with the Green Gang, a fraternal organization that promoted both political and criminal enterprises. The Green Gang were also early supporters of Chiang Kai-shek and many other powerful political figures; indeed, the gang functioned as a kind of secret society and was often employed as enforcers by politicians keen to stabilize rivalries. Ying Guixin had long harbored political tendencies and his 30-room villa in Shanghai's French Concession became a hub for political discussions and a refuge for political thinkers such as Yu Youren and Chen Qimei. While with the Green Gang he became acquainted with Yuan Shikai's second son Yuan Kewen with whom he shared an appreciation of antiques. After Chen Qimei's provisional government was overturned by Yuan Shikai, Ying Guixin switched loyalties. In 1913 Ying Guixin was contracted by Yuan Shikai's government to assassinate Song Jiaoren who had become a threat to not only Yuan Shikai but also a rival of both Sun Yat-Sen and Liang Qichao. He subcontracted this out to an ex-soldier named Wu Shiying who on March 20, 1913 approached Song Jiaoren at a Shanghai railway station and shot him with a Browning pistol; Song Jiaoren died two days later in the hospital. Due to the outcry, Ying Guixin and others who were believed to be involved were rounded up and arrested. Incriminating telegrams were found at his house and he was detained but managed to escape to Beijing in order to secure protection from Yuan Shikai. Indeed, all those suspected to be involved died mysteriously in order to deflect any responsibility from Yuan Shikai including the Premier of the Republic of China Zhao Bingjun, who was found poisoned. Ying Guixin was killed by two swordsmen in a first-class train compartment en route to Tianjin.

Fox 1991, p. 219. The site was excavated during the 20th century by A. Ledyard Smith. Ceramic evidence excavated at the site suggests a close relationship with the K'iche' capital of Q'umarkaj.Lovell 2005, p. 51. Chutixtiox may have been a settlement in a polity that included the nearby sites of Chutinamit and Xolpacol.Fox 1980, p. 50. The site has been dated to the Late Postclassic period and shows two distinct architectural phases, with the late phase demonstrating close similarity to the central K'iche' region around Q'umarkaj. This matches ethnohistoric documents that describe an early 15th-century conquest of the region by the central K'iche'. The site has been identified as the settlement of the Kumatz group, described as migrating to the area in the Popul Vuh. Location The site is located on a high ridge in an area later dominated by the K'iche' Maya.Adams 1996, p. 314. The ridge overlooks an agricultural valley of the R√≠o Negro.Babcock 2012, p. 303. The site was heavily fortified and may have been a settlement of the Postclassic K'iche',Adams 1996, pp. 314, 318. used to control the valley. Chutixtiox is west of the contemporary site of Tuja.Fox 1991, p. 219. The site is surrounded on three sides by sheer cliffs dropping over down to the river. On the fourth side it connects to a long ridge via a narrow neck of land just wide. Although the site dominates the fertile floodplains below, the site itself is arid; the vegetation consists of thorny acacias and cacti.Fox 1978, p. 72. Settlement context Ceramic evidence dates the site to the Late Postclassic (c. 1200‚Äì1524 AD). A significant amount of Early Phase ceramics were recovered (c. 1200‚Äì1350), but the majority of ceramics dated to the Late Phase (c. 1350‚Äì1524) and these demonstrated strong similarities with contemporary ceramics from Q'umarkaj, suggesting close links between the two sites during this phase.Fox 1978, pp. 3, 74. Site architecture is also closely related to architecture at the K'iche' capital, with west-facing temples, similar layout of flanking structures, a defensive ditch at the entrance, and the plaza floor coated with plaster.Fox 1978 pp. 74‚Äì75. There are also important differences to the typical K'iche' settlement pattern as represented at the capital; the ballcourt is not oriented east-west, the architecture is mounted upon an acropolis with a steep defensive wall, and the main temple was radial. Investigator John Fox suggested that the differences may represent the Early Phase settlement pattern, before the site came under the influence of the central K'iche' region, and the similarities being the result of the later close relation with Q'umarkaj.Fox 1978, p. 75. The K'iche' epic Popul Vuh describes four groups that settled around Sacapulas; these were the Lamakib, the Kumatz, the Tuhal Haa, and the Uch'aba Haa. Kumatz is now associated with the north side of the river, and Chutixtiox may have been Kumatz. The early colonial indigenous Annals of the Kaqchikels and the T√≠tulo Xpantzay II both relate that Kumatz was conquered by the central K'iche' in the early 15th century AD.Fox 1978, p. 76. These ethnohistoric documents closely match the strong central K'iche' influence evidenced in the archaeology of the site.Fox 1978, pp. 76‚Äì77. Site description The earliest archaeological exploration of Chutixtiox was undertaken by A. Ledyard Smith in 1955.Chocano Alfaro 2012, p. 488. The site covers approximately and contains about 30 structures, with approximately half of these grouped around the main plaza.Babcock 2012, p. 304. =Defences= The ruins of Chutixtiox occupy a steep hilltop in a curve of the R√≠o Negro Chutixtiox occupies a highly defensible location, with a defensive wall and additional protection provided by surrounding cliffs.Borgstede and Mathieu 2007, p. 202. In two places where the drop to the river is not sheer, the natural slope has been fortified. A gentler slope westwards to the river, on the north side of the site, was reinforced with a high wall running down from the hilltop to the river bank. On the northeast side the slope down to the river is naturally steep, but the top was cut away to present a vertical drop. Chutixtiox had a single entrance on the northwest side, close to the upper end of the defensive wall. A defensive ditch was cut across the neck of land connecting the site to the adjacent ridge to defend the approach.Fox 1978, pp.72‚Äì73. =Architecture= The site core consists of an acropolis supporting a plaza, around which all the civic architecture is arranged, with the exception of two structures. The acropolis terrace rises above the adjoining level, and has inset masonry retaining walls. Five stairways were used to access the acropolis level. The masonry is well- preserved and built from cut schistose slabs. In some places a later building stage uses dressed limestone blocks. The masonry was coated with plaster. The majority of structures at the site are aligned with the cardinal directions. The long structures at the site featured corbel vaulting, an architectural form derived from the Maya lowlands.Fox 1987, 2008, p. 121. Main plaza The main plaza of the site features a radial pyramid with a single stairway on each side;Fox 1987, 2008, pp. 118, 122. it stands tall. The pyramid is flanked by roughly symmetrical architectural complexes on the north and south sides of the plaza, consisting of a long council-house structure and a smaller shrine standing between the east end of each long structure and the radial temple.Fox 1987, 2008, pp. 122‚Äì123. The flanking shrines stand approximately high, and each possessed a single west-facing stairway.Fox 1978, pp. 72, 74. The long structures flanking the plaza each possessed a single room upon a basal platform, with benches set against the back and side walls.Fox 1978, p. 74. One of the long structures measures , standing upon a basal platform measuring . Structure 10 possessed a stone-lined tomb, rectangular in form, with its doorway sealed by a stone slab. Structure 12 was a small shrine with doorways in all four sides.Smith 1965, pp. 76‚Äì94. During excavations, a well-preserved sculpture of a crouching jaguar was uncovered at the base of the stairway of Structure 3, one of the long structures,Fox 1987, 2008, pp. 41‚Äì43. Smith 1965, pp. 76‚Äì94. and a life-size stucco sculpture of a jaguar was found buried with the deceased in a tomb under another of northern long structure flanking the main plaza.Fox 1987, 2008, pp. 41‚Äì43. Fox 1978, p. 74. The ballcourt measures along its major axis and is aligned 15‚Äì17¬∞ off north-south.Fox 1991, pp. 216, 219. It is situated along the side of the plaza,Fox 1987, 2008, pp. 118‚Äì119. upon a lower terrace,Fox 1987, 2008, p. 131. and may have been regarded as a part of the plaza complex. The walls of the playing area are almost vertical, and the top of the eastern range of the ballcourt is on the same level as the adjoining floor of the main plaza. Secondary plaza Long structure in the secondary plaza On the same level as the ballcourt there is a secondary plaza that contains an unusual long structure with a sunken court.Babcock 2012, p. 304. Fox 1978, p. 74. The superstructure possessed free-standing masonry walls, with a single room that contained benches. Holes near the top of the walls probably held wooden beams that supported a wooden roof. The long structure contained a raised plaster ring standing high, and measuring across.Babcock 2012, p. 305. An altar accompanies the long structure in the secondary plaza. Other structures Numerous low residential platforms are located on the western terraces of the site. An underground passage is said to lead down from the ruins to the river, but archaeologists were unable to verify its existence.  Notes  References  : (1996). Prehistoric Mesoamerica (Revised ed.).

History The Vizianagaram- Parvatipuram line was opened in 1908‚Äì09. The Parvatipuram-Raipur line was completed in 1931. In 1960, Indian Railway took up three projects: the Kottavalasa-Koraput-Jeypore-Kirandaul line ( Dandakaranya Project ), the Titlagarh-Bolangir-Jharsuguda Project and the Rourkela-Kiriburu Project. All the three projects taken together were popularly known as the DBK Project or the Dandakaranya Bolangir Kiriburu Project. The Sambalpur-Titlagarh line was opened to traffic in 1963. Railway reorganisation The Bengal Nagpur Railway was nationalised in 1944.Eastern Railway was formed on 14 April 1952 with the portion of East Indian Railway Company east of Mughalsarai and the Bengal Nagpur Railway. In 1955, South Eastern Railway was carved out of Eastern Railway. It comprised lines mostly operated by BNR earlier. Amongst the new zones started in April 2003 were East Coast Railway and South East Central Railway. Both these railways were carved out of South Eastern Railway. Khurda Road-Balangir rail link The Khurda Balangir rail link was surveyed in 1945 but the project was sanctioned in 1994‚Äì95. The stretch of only from to Rajsunakhala has been constructed out of the project. The work on infrastructure started in 2007. The state government has signed Memorandum of Understanding with Indian railways to undertake some parts of the project on cost sharing basis. The project which was initially estimated to be is now estimated to be nearly after almost 20 years of delay due to low budgetary provisions and issues of land acquisition. This rail line will link cities of Nayagarh, Boudh and Sonepur with Bhubaneswar and Balangir. Smaller towns like Dasapalla, Banigocha and Manipur will also be linked by this rail line.

Its ground floor was built in 1233, and it is believed to be the oldest surviving building in the city. The upper floor is of a much later construction, being built in the 20th century. History The ground floor of Palazzo Santa Sofia was built in the 13th century, and the date 1233 is inscribed on the moulding of one of its windows. The upper floor was built sometime after 1938. The building was periodically rented and used as a school run by Roman Catholic nuns.Cuschieri, Doreen (25 October 2010). \\"Sisters of Dorothy enter their first 100 years in Malta\\". Times of Malta. Retrieved 12 March 2016. Today, the palace is privately owned, and it is managed by a local heritage foundation Fondazzjoni Patrimonju Malti. It is not open to the general public, although it can be hired for dinner or cocktail parties, lectures or other events. The palace is scheduled as a Grade 1 national monument, and it is also listed in the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands. Architecture The narrow street Palazzo Santa Sofia originally had a single story, and was built around a central courtyard. The main doorway to the palace was originally through an arched passageway known as a siqifah, which led to the courtyard. The passageway was eventually converted into a narrow street called Triq Santa Sofia (Santa Sofia Street). The fa√ßade of the ground floor is rather plain, and it contains two doors with the passageway in between. A two-tiered palline losanghe cornice separates the ground floor from the first floor. This cornice is similar to the one found at the nearby Palazzo Falson. The more recent upper floor is characterized by four ornate mullioned windows, and a one- tiered palline losanghe cornice is located at roof level. A number of coats of arms can be found on both floors of the fa√ßade.

It managed South African Airways from 1934 to 1997. The Central South African Railways, the Cape Government Railways, and the Natal Government Railways were all fused by an Act of Parliament.http://mysite.mweb.co.za/residents/grela/transnet.htm The South African Railways and Harbours Service Act, 1912 made striking by railway employees punishable by fine or imprisonment. The total track had expanded to 18000 kilometres by the end of 1916. Labour policies In 1924 as a result of the industrial depression, the government adopted a \\"civilised labour\\" policy, the intention of which was to ensure that the European minority did not sink below the level of the non-European workers. Unskilled white labour was recruited to the railways and a probation grade introduced, restricted to white employees. The number of black employees fell from 47,157 in 1924 to 41,533 in 1929, while the number of white employees increased from 39,024 to 58,562. This policy continued until 1939. Die Spoorbund, an Afrikaner trade union formed in 1934, advocated a policy of replacing all black railway workers by Afrikaners. Most of the black workers were migrants, housed in company labour compounds. In 1936, starting pay for single black workers was 3/6d a day and for coloured workers 4/-d a day. After 11 years, pay rose to 4/6d for black and 5/- for coloured workers. Married workers got between 4d and 6d more per day. 28,000 of the 45,000 employed were casual day labourers. Dock workers were often required to \\"stand by\\" waiting for a ship to arrive. The South African Railways and Harbours Union was formed after a meeting of the staff in Cape Town on 1 April 1936 addressed by Rachel Simons. In 1939, the organisation had 47,000 African employees. The railways were a stronghold of the National Party. A special white labourer grade was created for Afrikaners from which most were eventually promoted. In 1962, there were 218,000 employees, of which about 100,000 were Africans. About a third of the Africans were officially casual workers, paid a daily rate with no leave, pension rights of marriage allowance. The remainder were mostly temporary workers who were eligible for 15 days paid leave. Permanent workers were in addition entitled to a marriage allowance and a pension at the age of 60. South African Transport Services From April 1981, the country's railway, harbour, road transport, aviation, and pipeline operations became known as South African Transport Services. At the same time, the enterprise was restructured into units and divisions with strong emphasis placed on localized management. http://mysite.mweb.co.za/residents/grela/transnet.html In 1984, the organisation had 240,237 employees, of which 110,160 were African, 109,710 were White, 18,377 Coloured, and 1,990 Indian. Wages were then not much worse than in other industries, but migrant workers, the majority, were forced to live in hostels or compounds in primitive conditions. The Delmore hostel near Germiston had 7,000 beds. Workers shared a room with four or five other men. There was no hot water. Visitors were not allowed. Food was supplied from a communal kitchen. It had 77% of the GDP of the transport sector in South Africa. Industrial relations were regulated by the Conditions of Employment (South African Transport Services) Act, 1983. Black workers were still regarded as labourers even if in skilled work. Benefits available to white workers were denied to them and they were subject to arbitrary and oppressive sanctions. By 1987, numbers employed had declined to about 199,000. The Legal Succession to the South African Transport Services Act, 1989 transformed the South African Transport Services from a government department into a public company. On 1 April 1990, after 80 years of government and parliamentary control, SATS received company status. It is now known as Transnet.

The brigade fought on the Western Front during World War I from January 1916 to November 1918, and in Normandy and north-west Europe in 1944‚Äì1945 during World War II. It was a square formation of four infantry battalions during World War I, but was reduced to a triangular formation of three battalions during World War II. History=World War I=Formation During World War I, the brigade was formed as part of the 3rd Canadian Division. Placed under the leadership of Brigadier-General Frederic William Hill, it initially consisted of the 43rd, 52nd, 58th and 60th Battalions, which came respectively from Winnipeg, Port Arthur, the Niagara area and Montreal. The unit sailed to France from Southampton late in February. Thereafter, it travelled to its billets in the vicinity of Eecke. The different battalions were then attached to other Canadian brigades already in the line, near Locre and Dranoutre, for trench familiarisation and training. By late March 1916, the unit was complete, except for the divisional artillery, which would be available by the middle of July of the same year. In the meantime, as part of the 3rd Division, its artillery support was assured by the Indian 3rd (Lahore) Division. The unit spent the next months rotating in and out of trenches in the Ypres area, where other units of the Canadian Corps were located. It witnessed the German gas attacks at Hulluch and at Wulverghem, without taking part. In the last few days of May, the Brigade suffered casualties as a result of German artillery fire. Battle of Mont Sorrel A map of the situation before and after the Battle of Mont Sorrel Then, on June 2, the Germans launched an attack, in an attempt to divert Allied resources from the upcoming offensive in the Somme region and to gain a tactical advantage in the Ypres salient by capturing the only part of the Ypres ridge that was still in British hands. The brigade not being in the front line at the time of the attack, two battalions (the 52nd and the 60th) were ordered to strengthen the 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade. The brigade then relieved the 8th Canadian Infantry Brigade and parts of the 7th, which had borne the brunt of the German attack. From the 4th through to the 10th, no significant action happened except for repeated shelling and a German attack by about 100 men in the evening of the 4th on positions held by the 43rd battalion, which was repulsed. Further attempts, on the 10th and 11th, were again repulsed. On the night of the 12 and 13th, the Brigade's 58th Battalion participated in a counter-attack, in conjunction with other forces from the Canadian Corps, to attempt to recapture lost positions on the heights of Mont Sorrel and Tor Top. After prolonged artillery fire, the troops went over the top at 1:30 AM. Despite achieving objectives, the attack being described as an \\"unqualified success\\", the battalion nevertheless incurred 165 casualties. After the battle, the brigade was relieved by two battalions from the 2nd Guards Brigade on the night between the 15th and the 16th and moved behind the front line. In all, the brigade suffered 1083 casualties from June 2 to June 16.

She served for almost 30 years before retiring. During her duty, she never wore a military uniform or saluted a superior officer.  Early life  Hoskins was born in Pasadena, California, around 1890.  Career  Hoskins initially worked for the U.S. Army as a civilian grade headquarters clerk in 1907. During World War I in 1916 she was attached to an intelligence unit in an army field clerk position. She did well in this position and in 1917 she was made a Warrant Officer. She became an office manager director in charge of personnel at the Judge Advocate General's Office in San Francisco, California. Hoskins served in the Philippines from 1919 to 1922. She then served ten years at the Seventh Corps Headquarters in Omaha, Nebraska, initially in a director's position. The director's position was dissolved in 1926 while she was serving there. She was appointed a warrant officer, a technical position specifically designed as an upper grade level. It was a skilled trained position for a specific job, uncommon to the normal duties of the area. It ranked between enlisted people and commissioned officers. Hoskins stayed in Omaha through 1933. Hoskins had served in the military about 20 years when she received the warrant officer position. Hoskins was the first woman to be a United States Army warrant officer. The second woman to receive the warrant officer's position was Jen Doble. She also had served about 20 years in the military. There were no more female warrant officers until after Hoskins and Doble retired. Hoskins went back to the Philippines in 1934 and stayed there into mid 1936. Her final assignment from 1936 until retirement in 1937 was at the Ninth Corps Headquarters in San Francisco.

Toupin (August 31, 1886 ‚Äì October 7, 1965), was an American lawyer and politician of French Canadian descent. He served as Lieutenant Governor of Rhode Island and Mayor of Woonsocket, Rhode Island. He is most remembered for his 1924 filibuster in the Rhode Island Senate during a time of extreme partisanship. Early and personal life Toupin was born in the village of Manville, Rhode Island, in the town of Lincoln. His parents Dieudonne and Mary (Proulx) Toupin were French Canadian immigrants. Toupin is a graduate of La Salle Academy, and Joliette Seminary in Quebec. He graduated from Boston University School of Law in 1913. On return from his service in World War I, Toupin practiced law in Manville and Woonsocket. Toupin owned extensive real estate across northern Rhode Island and nearby Massachusetts. Toupin's first wife, Delia A. Chapon, died in 1962. Toupin remarried to Blanche B. Lavimodiere (1902-82) in 1963. He had no children. Political life Felix A. Toupin served as Lieutenant Governor of Rhode Island, and later as Mayor of Woonsocket. =Lieutenant Governor= Toupin was elected Lieutenant Governor on a ticket with fellow Democrat William S. Flynn. Together with Robert E. Quinn, a state senator from West Warwick, the three young politicians wanted to push through a progressive agenda for Rhode Island. Their set of reforms included a 48-hour work week and an end to property qualifications for voting. At this time, Rhode Islanders who did not own property were not allowed to vote in city council elections (although they could vote in other races). Unfortunately, the Democrats were five votes shy of a majority, and were unable to pass their reforms. The Senate was at a deadlock for months. Most of Toupin's 1923 and 1924 were spent biding time and looking for ways to get a majority. =Filibuster, fistfight, and stink bomb= Finally, in 1924, Democrats introduced a bill calling for a constitutional convention, despite the fact that the state Supreme Court had ruled that the legislature lacked the power to do so. Toupin and Quinn came up with a desperate plan: they would stage a marathon multi-day filibuster. Toupin read from \\"Hamlet\\" and the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, in hopes that enough exhausted Republicans would leave the chamber, giving Democrats the majority they needed to pass the measure. Toupin did not leave the rostrum for 42 continuous hours. He ate and shaved at the rostrum, and \\"a device\\" was placed near his seat so he could relieve himself without giving up the floor. On the morning of June 18, 1924, Toupin was momentarily absent as roll was to be called. Republicans attempted to call the meeting to order without Toupin. Democrat Robert Quinn jumped across his desk to \\"wring the judge's throat\\" to prevent roll from being called without Toupin present. This prompted a fistfight to break out in the Senate chamber: \\"In the minutes that followed, every person in the State House ‚Äî representatives, reporters and the hundreds of civilian onlookers alike ‚Äî jumped into the fray, a massive movement of swinging arms, screaming and stomping on the Senate floor.\\" Toupin returned to the chamber, untouched, and resumed his filibuster. Finally at 7:45 a.m. on June 19, Republicans had had enough. They hired Boston gangster William \\"Toots\\" Murray to set off a bromine gas bomb in the senate chamber. The plan backfired: several Republicans became violently ill but Toupin, who was being shaved at the time, had a towel over his face and was not affected by the attack; nor was Quinn. Quinn and Toupin, sensing an advantage, attempted to resume the session and call for a vote, but this time the entire Republican delegation fled the chamber (and the state) to Rutland, Massachusetts. With no Republicans in the chamber, a quorum could not be reached, and no state business could be passed. The combination of the fistfight, bomb attack, and inability of the state to function drew nationwide attention and ridicule. = 1924 election = Toupin ran for governor in the November 1924 election. The Republican-leaning Providence Journal falsely blamed the gas attack on Democrats, and the November 1924 elections saw Democrats lose statewide. Republicans, seeking to undercut Toupin's French Canadian American support, convinced Aram Pothier to leave retirement to run against him. With the press against Democrats, Pothier carried the election. = Mayor of Woonsocket = Toupin moved to Woonsocket, Rhode Island in 1930. He served as Woonsocket mayor for three terms (1930‚Äì1936) as a Democrat, and one term (1939‚Äì1940) as a Republican. Toupin's relationship with the Woonsocket city council was contentious. In March 1935, president of the Board of Aldermen James H. Holland called a surprise council session, without informing Mayor Toupin. When Toupin later asked to be read the minutes of that meeting, City Clerk Raymond A. Jarret refused. Toupin reached for the minutes book, and \\"a melee followed.\\" Toupin sustained a cut over his right eye from the altercation. In 1936, nearing the end of his third term as mayor, Toupin switched parties. The reason is unclear; perhaps he calculated that his base of French-Canadian voters were mostly Republican. Or perhaps the Democrats simply kicked him out. Either way, the newly Republican Toupin lost his re- election bid in 1936 to Joseph Pratt. He lost in part because the Woonsocket Independent Textile Union (ITU) saw Toupin as being anti-union. Three years later, however, Toupin successfully returned to the Mayoralty for one final term, 1939-1940, as a Republican.  Death and burial  Toupin died on October 7, 1965, and is buried in St. James Cemetery in Lincoln, Rhode Island.

His work has a strong vintage comic book and street art influence while also making use of pop cultural references in music, cinema, art, literature, games, history and politics. Often crossing reality and fiction, his projects promote creative concepts that reference fictional characters with real life personalities such as musicians, artists, historical figures and politicians. His work started going viral on the internet in 2012 via social media and since then he has been getting attention online and offline from newspapers, books, magazines and vehicles such as The Guardian/Observer, Rolling Stone, The Huffington Post, NME, Wired, Elle, Maxim, Vanity Fair, Yahoo!, and MTV. His body of work has since been leading to exhibitions in contemporary art galleries in cities like London, San Francisco, Chicago, Miami, Lisbon and Dubai, and has attracted collaborations with companies such as ESPN, Michael Jordan, Foot Locker, E.Leclerc, British Gas, Billboard and Winsor & Newton. Butcher Billy's artistic name derives from an Irish ancestor who earned the nickname \\"Butcher\\" for fighting in the Irish War of Independence brandishing a cleaver. Works= The Post-Punk/New Wave Super Friends Project= In 2013 he released \\"The Post-Punk/New Wave Super Friends\\" series which discussed what makes a pop culture icon. The concept was to cross post-punk artists from the early 1980s with vintage comics superheroes. The series was widely spread through social media gaining online and offline media coverage from main websites and blogs around the world; also published in the book Comics Feeeever! Uncover The Power of Comics in Art and Design released by Victionary. In 2015 the series had a follow-up called All-New Super-Powered Post-Punk Marvels. This series was featured in the Art and Design section of the British newspaper The Guardian, and in the French art book collection ARTtitude, by publisher Plan9 Entertainment. = The Legion of Real Life Supervillains Project = In this series, released in 2014, Butcher Billy proposed an experiment where notorious dictators, psychopaths and murderers or even suspicious figures from real life are mashed up with comics supervillains - strangely related some way or the other with their counterparts. The project gained an article in the Arts & Culture section at The Huffington Post. This series caused debates in many countries for the use of controversial figures such as Adolf Hitler, Charles Manson, Chairman Mao Zedong, Osama bin Laden and Mark Zuckerberg. Billy is quoted on the project: \\"Some might say all art is a reflection of the times we live in. If back in the day comics and movies were pretty naive and faced only as pure escapism, today's fiction has to evoke reality to create something truly meaningful... and frightening.\\" = The Superhero Media Crossover Project = In this series from 2012 Butcher Billy interlaces cinematography with storyboard, replacing live action scenes from contemporary super-hero blockbuster movies with cuts from the 1960s and 1970s comic books they were born from. The concept aims to explore how thin is the line that separates modern from classic, and pixels from ink. A successful superhero live action movie is mostly dependent on how the filmmakers have captured the exact character found on its two-dimensional, spandex-clad origin. The classic look and style in comics combined with some modern aspects like slight changes in costumes and storyline is a common technique found in making movies today. The project makes us realize how often movie makers rely on the format of classic comic books and graphic novels, making them easy to translate them on the screen. = Batman: The Nolan vs Burton Experiment Project = A design experiment in which Butcher Billy mashed together Tim Burton‚Äôs 1989 Batman and Christopher Nolan‚Äôs Dark Knight trilogy. By placing their differing elements in proximity, the images revealed the contrasts between the two similar yet disparate cinematic universes. By doing that the artist discussed the meaning of what is classic and timeless and the contemporary recycle of concepts in modern cinema. = Butcher Billy's \\"Tales From The Smith\\" Comic Book Series = This time the artist has taken goth rock icon Robert Smith of the band The Cure, and given him his own series of illustrations he's named \\"Tales From the Smith\\". Butcher Billy has once again opted to use the comic book genre as a guide for his new project. However instead of the usual superhero genre, the musician is portrayed in a series of retro style horror comic covers, and as an ode to his band, each of the horror comics in this series are named after a particular song. In addition, some of the art in this series are represented with homages to past iconic horror movies, such as Friday the 13th and Evil Dead. Billy is quoted on the series: \\"This frightening series of strange tales is an homage to the goth legend who truly taught us love and darkness\\". The collection has been published at Adobe Create, the Adobe online platform that features curated projects from leading creatives on the internet. =Tales from the Black Mirror= Butcher Billy took inspiration from the episodes of Black Mirror and created covers akin to a comics anthology about each. Once series creator Charlie Brooker discovered the images through Twitter, Billy was eventually hired to do artwork featured in the episodes themselves.Artista curitibano faz ilustra√ß√µes sobre a s√©rie Black Mirror para a Netflix, Folha de S.

Described as a Southern belle, her politics shifted from pro-Union or neutral during the Civil War, after the Union seized her family's hotel to serve as the Mansion House Hospital. A fictionalized version of her is played by Hannah James in Mercy Street, where the character is a nurse. Early life Emma Green was born in 1843 into a wealthy and socially aspiring family in Alexandria, Virginia. She was raised in a devout Episcopalian household. She had three brothers who lived in town, three older sisters, and three younger sisters. She grew up in the Carlyle House in Alexandria along with her older sister Lydia, her mother Jane Muir Green, and her father James. In her youth, Emma Green sometimes stayed at the adjacent Mansion Hotel House owned by her family, or stayed at their 232 acre family farm outside town called The Grove. Her father, James Green, was the owner of the Mansion House Hotel and also the richest man in Alexandria by 1859. His hotel housed boarders, servants, and 16 slaves, including several enslaved children. The family also owned the Green & Brother furniture factory, which when the Civil War reached the outskirts of Alexandria in 1860, was confiscated as a prison for Union deserters. Emma's brothers were not directly involved in owning or renting slaves, unlike their father. Her little Alice sister died in March 1860 of a sudden illness. Her two eldest sisters Mary and Elizabeth married into the Stringfellow family, Sarah married into the Jacobs family, and Lydia never married. By 1861, Green had made the acquaintance of her future husband Frank Stringfellow, a student in Alexandria. He then began teaching Latin in Mississippi at age 20, to earn money to marry Green. The Civil War After Virginia voted to secede from the United States on May 24, 1861, Green's father received a notice in early November 1861, stating he had three days to vacate the hotel. The Union Army took over the building on November 11, 1861, with the Green family to receive rent from the government in the future. On December 1, 1861, Mansion House Hospital was opened as a General Hospital. Green's family initially had pro-Union sympathies due to their manufacturing background, but increasingly sided with the Confederates as the Civil War progressed. Green's own politics shifted from pro-Union or neutral during the Civil War, possibly influenced by the strong Confederate leanings of her fiance. During the war, Green's fianc√© Benjamin Franklin \\"Frank\\" Stringfellow operated as a Confederate spy. It is possible that Green assisted in the espionage. Enlisting in the Confederate Army at the start of the war, in January 1862, Stringfellow was sent to spy in Alexandria under the guise of a dental assistant. At one point in April, in the dentist office Green incidentally encountered him and called him by name, but they succeeded in not raising suspicions. They avoided further contact through 1862 while he remained with the dentist, before he left Alexandria for other missions as a scout and spy. On September 20, 1862, people began using the Green family hotel as a First Division General Hospital, and it was the largest of the confiscated buildings used as a military hospital in the city, able to hold up to 700 sick and wounded soldiers. Stringfellow returned again to Alexandria in 1863, again on a mission to spy and recruit new agents. He took the opportunity to meet Green, and they had several meetings with Frank using the name R.M. Franklin. He left the city again after a near exposure of his identity. According to some historians, such as author Virginia Morton, Green assisted Stringfellow throughout 1863. In one story told by Morton, one day \\"Stringfellow proceeded to Emma‚Äôs house alone but discovered Union officers occupying the upper levels. Undeterred, he crept into the cellar from the back of the house and asked Emma‚Äôs maid to fetch her‚Ä¶ Emma agreed to call on the informers and returned within a few hours with vital information of Union Gen. Irvin McDowell‚Äôs planned attack.\\" Stringfellow again returned to Washington in March 1865, and reports say that Green moved to live with family friends in an effort to be closer to him. She rendezvoused with Frank Stringfellow in 1865 at gatherings of Union friends, when he was undercover spying for Jefferson Davis and courting her. However, by the end of the war he was known as dangerous, and had a $10,000 bounty for his capture. When Richmond fell, Stringfellow left for Virginia, and discovered he was a rumored accomplice in Lincoln's assassination. He left for Canada. Following the surrender of the Confederacy on April 9, 1865, the Mansion House Hospital was returned to the Greens and reopened as a hotel, operating as the Mansion House Hotel until it was then acquired by new proprietors in the early 1880s. Later life and family After the war, Green moved to the boarding school Woodberry Forest School near Alexandria. Green and Stringfellow reunited after the war when he returned from his flight into Canada in 1867, and they married on January 23, 1867. Frank became an Episcopalian minister, and they had four children together: Ida (b. 1867), Alice Lee (b. 1871), Frank (b. 1881) and John Stanton (b. 1883). In 1883 the Green family was awarded late rent by the US government for its use of the Mansion House Hotel, after both of Emma Green's parents had died. After her husband died in 1913, Green died in 1929, with their tombstone at the Ivy Hill Cemetery in Alexandria. Cultural legacy In 2016, PBS began broadcasting Mercy Street, a television series based on the hospital in the Green family hotel, the Mansion House Hospital, set in 1862. A fictionalized version of Emma Green is a key character in the series, serving as a nurse, and is played by Hannah James. Through local friends, James contacted great- great-grandchildren of Green's, who shared relics, clothing, and stories that had belonged to her. The real Emma Green served only as a template for the depiction on the show. The only details that the two women share are that Emma Green was a daughter of the Greens who owned the Mansion House Hotel and that she was engaged to Frank Stringfellow. The real Emma Green was never a nurse. Her husband was also never implicated in an assassination plot.

Working in the television industry since 1947, Coopersmith has authored more than 100 television scripts for anthology dramas, episodic series and television movies and specials. His television work includes \\"Johnny Jupiter\\" (1953-1954), \\"Armstrong Circle Theater\\" (1955-1963), \\"Hawaii Five-O\\" (1967-1976), and \\"Streets of San Francisco\\" (1973), and the holiday classics \\"'Twas the Night Before Christmas\\" (1974) and \\"An American Christmas Carol\\" (1979). Coopersmith's theatrical plays span Broadway, off-Broadway, and regional productions. His Broadway musical, \\"Baker Street\\" (1965), based on the stories of Sherlock Holmes, earned him a Tony Nomination as Author of Best Musical. He is a member of the Dramatists Guild, the Mystery Writers of America, and is a current member and past officer of the Writers Guild of America, East On November 12, 2019, at age 94, Coopersmith was honored with the highest distinction of Chevalier, or Knight, in the National Order of the French Legion of Honor in recognition of his service to France in World War II. Early years Born in New York in 1925, Jerome Coopersmith was 16 when he got his first job as an office boy for the Shubert Theatrical Company in New York City. Coopersmith's education was interrupted by two years of service in WW2's 94th Infantry Division of the United States Army, where he was awarded a Purple Heart. In 1945, 20 year old Coopersmith returned to college and earned his degree from New York University. Television career Jerome Coopersmith landed his first television job in 1947 with pioneer TV producer Martin Stone, who had a number of shows on the air including the popular \\"Howdy Doody\\". Coopersmith's first assignment was with the quiz show entitled \\"Americana\\" which challenged a panel of high school students to answer questions about American history based on brief dramatizations performed by actors. Coopersmith wrote the short vignettes of American history which aired on the show. This led to Stone's production of \\"The Gabby Hayes Show\\", a series of full half-hour dramas of events in American history. The stories were co-written by Jerome Coopersmith and the more experienced playwright Horton Foote. Foote was a mentor to Coopersmith, and together they wrote more than 50 episodes which aired on NBC. Many successful actors began their television careers on the show, including Ernest Borgnine, Rod Steiger, and Leslie Nielsen. In 1952, Martin Stone wanted to try his hand at producing a comedy, and so he and Coopersmith came up with the idea of a series called \\"Johnny Jupiter\\" about a television studio janitor, played by Vaughn Taylor, who succeeds in contacting the planet Jupiter. His attempt to explain the strange ways of Earth to the Jupiterians, portrayed by hand puppets, provided the satirical content of the series. In reviewing the show, Jack Gould of the New York Times wrote, ‚ÄúIf Mr. Coopersmith can sustain the brilliant pace of the opening show, he obviously is going to move quickly to the head of the class among TV‚Äôs satirists.‚Äù The 13-week series was produced on the independent station, DuMont Television Network, and was extended for another 26 weeks as a sitcom on ABC. By 1954, the one-hour anthology drama series, such as The Philco Television Playhouse and US Steel Hour had become extremely popular. David Susskind, wishing to enter that realm, took over as executive producer of \\"Armstrong Circle Theater,\\" originally a half-hour dramatic show, and recruited Coopersmith to help him change the show's format. The series was reinvented as a one-hour docu-drama based on true stories and real events, and at Coopersmith's suggestion, each episode was narrated by a renowned newscaster to stress the reality of the series. Coopersmith's first episode, \\"The Strange War Of Sergeant Krenzer\\", was the true story of United States Sergeant Werner Krenzer, an army sergeant in Korea who was given the job of rounding up homeless kids on the streets and placing them in shelters, but the kids didn't want to go. Coopersmith became a principal writer for the ‚ÄúArmstrong Circle Theatre‚Äù, penning 19 additional teleplays airing from 1955-1963 and providing him with some extraordinary experiences. For the episode \\"SSN 571 The Nautilus\\" Coopersmith took a 6-day underwater journey in America's first atomic submarine, the , for which his agents and lawyers required David Susskind to insure Coopersmith's life for one million dollars. The episode \\"I Was Accused\\" was based on the true experience of actor George Voskovec, who was kept interned at Ellis Island during the days of Senator Joseph McCarthy's \\"witch hunt\\". For this teleplay, Coopersmith was presented with the 1956 Robert E. Sherwood Award by a committee that included Eleanor Roosevelt. In 1964, Coopersmith wrote an episode for \\"Decision: The Conflicts of Harry S. Truman\\", A documentary series based on the writings of Harry S. Truman during his U.S. Presidency, produced by Ben Gradus for Screen Gems. Coopersmith met President Truman when he wrote the 25th episode, \\"I Am an American\\", reflecting on the attempted assassination of Truman in 1950. By 1965 the series was widely broadcast and was reaching about 70% of American households. Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s Coopersmith wrote episodes for many popular television series including \\"Justice\\", \\"Appointment with Adventure\\", \\"The Big Story\\", \\"Decoy\\", \\"Brenner\\", and \\"Combat!\\", as well as anthology dramas for \\"Goodyear Playhouse\\", \\"The Alcoa Hour\\", \\"Kraft Television Theater\\", and \\"Hallmark Hall of Fame\\". By the mid-1960s the bulk of the TV industry had moved from New York to Hollywood. In 1967, Coopersmith was hired by producer Leonard Freeman to write a script for a new TV series \\"Hawaii Five-O\\". That script, \\"Samurai\\", became the 4th episode of hit show‚Äôs first season. \\"Hawaii Five-O\\" became Coopersmith's focus for the next 8 years, during which he wrote 30 one-hour episodes and 2 feature-length movies for the show. One of Coopersmith‚Äôs episodes, \\"Retire In Sunny Hawaii ‚Äì Forever\\" featured Helen Hayes, mother of James MacArthur (Danno), in the leading guest role. Hayes received an Emmy Nomination for this performance. Another Coopersmith episode, \\"I'm A Family Crook... Don't Shoot!\\" was a comedy-crime drama guest starring Andy Griffith and Joyce Van Patten. \\"Nine Dragons\\", one of Coopersmith's feature-length episodes, was filmed in Hong Kong and continues to air as a full-length movie in foreign countries. Coopersmith continued to write scripts for many popular television series throughout the 70's and 80's including \\"Streets of San Francisco\\", \\"Medical Center\\", \\"The Andros Targets\\", \\"Nurse\\", \\"Spencer for Hire\\" and its spin-off \\"A Man Called Hawk\\". Coopersmith also wrote screenplays for TV movies and specials which aired on the major networks in the 1970s and 80s. His first feature film of this era, \\"Mr. Inside/Mr. Outside\\", was originally planned as a series pilot, and was produced by Philip D'Antoni (\\"The French Connection\\") in 1973. The movie starred Tony LoBianco and Hal Linden as cops thwarting a gang of diamond smugglers. In 1973, Coopersmith wrote the screenplay for \\"'Twas The Night Before Christmas\\" an animated adaptation of Clement Moore's classic poem \\"A Visit From Saint Nicholas\\". The Rankin/Bass production featured voices by Joel Grey, George Gobel, Tammy Grimes, and John McGiver. The special became an annual holiday classic, airing on CBS for 20 years from 1974 to 1994. In 1994 The Family Channel (now ABC Family) purchased the syndication rights. The special was also released commercially in most media formats. Coopersmith celebrated the holiday theme with two additional works. \\"Have I Got A Christmas For You\\" was a 1-hour television special based on the true story of a Jewish congregation whose members filled the jobs of their Christian neighbors for one night, so they could be with their families on Christmas Eve. The holiday special, produced by Gilbert and Joseph Cates in 1977 and directed by Marc Daniels, starred Milton Berle, Steve Allen, Jayne Meadows, Herb Edelman, Jim Backus, and Adrienne Barbeau. \\"An American Christmas Carol\\", another holiday-inspired work, is a feature-length movie adaptation of the Charles Dickens classic transplanted to New England during the great depression. The movie, produced by Stanley Chase and Jon Slan, first aired in 1979 with Henry Winkler starring as Benedict Slade (the adaptation version of Scrooge), and David Wayne and Dorian Harewood co-starring. The movie continues to air annually, and was released commercially in all media formats. Another of Coopersmith's TV movies was an adaption of the Mary Higgins Clark best- selling novel, \\"The Cradle Will Fall\\", a murder-mystery about a doctor obsessed with creating a fountain-of-youth drug. The movie, which premiered on CBS in 1983, was produced by Joseph Cates and starred Lauren Hutton, Ben Murphy, and James Farentino. Appealing to the network's daytime audience, the story was set in the soap opera Guiding Light's fictional town of Springfield USA, home of Cedars Hospital, and featured six of the soap's key characters in supporting roles. Theatrical career In the 1960s, Jerome Coopersmith sought to expand his work from television to the theatrical stage. His first effort was a biographical play entitled \\"Eleanor\\" about the early life of Eleanor Roosevelt when she worked as a volunteer teacher in a New York Settlement House. In 1967 the play won the prestigious \\"S. Elizabeth Pope Playwriting Award\\" from Massachusetts State College, and was performed by the college in Bridgewater, MA. In 1974, a concert version of the play was performed at Hunter College in New York, with Jane Alexander in the title role. Roosevelt's family and friends attended this performance. Years later, in 1984, the Smithsonian Institution selected \\"Eleanor\\" to be performed in Washington DC in conjunction with the Eleanor Roosevelt Centennial. The show ran in the National Portrait Gallery, a branch of the Smithsonian Institution, and was performed by the students of DC's Catholic University. Coopersmith's next stage venture was \\"Baker Street\\" a musical based on the stories of Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It was produced on Broadway by Alexander H. Cohen, directed by Harold Prince, with a musical score by Marian Grudeff and Raymond Jessel. The show opened in 1965 at The Broadway Theatre, where it ran for nine months and then moved off-Broadway to the Martin Beck Theatre (now the Al Hirschfeld Theatre), for a total of 311 New York performances. The cast included Fritz Weaver, Peter Sallis, Martin Gabel, Inga Swenson, Virginia Vestoff, Teddy Green, and featured the Broadway debuts of Tommy Tune and Christopher Walken in small supporting roles. Bil Baird's Marionettes were also featured in an elaborate scene of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee Parade. The show received three Tony Nominations in 1965 including Coopersmith's nomination in the category Best Author (Musical). \\"Baker Street\\" returned to New York City for an off-Broadway production at the York Theatre in 2001. In November 2016, \\"Baker Street\\" was produced by the 42nd Street Moon Theater in San Francisco. The show ran for three weeks, as part of their 2016 season. While \\"Baker Street\\" was running, Coopersmith was offered a writing assignment for a show, \\"The Apple Tree\\", a 3-part musical based on three famous short stories, with music by Jerry Bock and lyrics by Sheldon Harnick. Coopersmith wrote the first act, a playlet based on Mark Twain's stories \\"The Diary of Adam and Eve\\" and \\"Eve's Diary\\". Bock and Harnick wrote the other two playlets based on Frank R. Stockton's \\"The Lady or the Tiger?\\" and Jules Feiffer's \\"Passionella\\". The musical, produced by Stuart Ostrow, opened on Broadway in 1966 at the Shubert Theatre, where it ran for 463 performances. This production starred Barbara Harris, Alan Alda, and Larry Blyden, and was directed by Mike Nichols. Harris won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical, 1967. \\"The Apple Tree\\" also received several other major Tony nominations including Best Musical of 1967. The Roundabout Theatre Company mounted a revival in 2006 that ran for a total of 117 performances starring Kristin Chenoweth in the multiple roles originally played by Harris. This production received a Tony nomination for Best Revival Musical of 2007. Coopersmith's next theater project was \\"Mata Hari\\", a stage play with music and lyrics by Martin Charnin and Edward Thomas and directed by Vincente Minnelli. The story centered on the alleged spy's affair with a French intelligence officer which led to her execution by a firing squad. \\"Mata Hari\\" was an anti-war play at the time the Vietnam War was unpopular with many Americans. The show had been planned for Broadway by producer David Merrick, and premiered at the National Theatre in Washington, DC. Production challenges led to Merrick withdrawing his support of the musical. In 1968, Coopersmith, Charnin, and Thomas produced the show at New York's off-Broadway Theatre DeLys (now the Lucille Lortel Theater) with the alternate title \\"Ballad For A Firing Squad\\". In 1996 the York Theatre in New York revived the 1968 version under the original title \\"Mata Hari\\". In the early 1970s puppeteer Bil Baird, who's marionettes appeared years earlier in \\"Baker Street\\", hired Coopersmith to author an original stage version of \\"Pinocchio\\" to be performed by the Baird Marionettes with music by Mary Rodgers and lyrics by Sheldon Harnick. The show ran in 1974 at the Bil Baird Marionette Theater in New York City. In 1988, shortly after Baird's death, \\"Pinocchio\\" was brought back to life, with his son Peter Baird among the cast of puppeteers. The revival was produced by Arthur Cantor and ran at the Minetta Lane Theatre in New York. Coopersmith continued bringing children's stories to the stage with his musical adaption of Johann David Wyss's \\"Swiss Family Robinson\\". The play was produced by the prestigious team of Barry and Fran Weissler, who later went on to produce many Broadway musical hits. Coopersmith's \\"Swiss Family Robinson\\" toured with the Weissler's National Theater Company, known for bringing high quality plays to high school, college and adult audiences with professional casts throughout America. In 1991, Coopersmith collaborated with Lucy Freeman to co-author \\"The Mystery of Anna O\\", a full-length non-musical play about the first person in the world ever to be psychoanalyzed. \\"Anna O\\" was a code name given to the young Austrian woman, so treated to protect her identity, as mental Illness was considered shameful in those days. The play was produced off-Broadway at the John Houseman Studio Theater in the fall of 1992. In 1992, Ruth Gruber enrolled in Coopersmith's writing class at Hunter College. She shared with him a book she had written, \\"Haven\\", the remarkable true story of her involvement in the rescue of 1000 Holocaust refugees and her fight to keep them in America. The story inspired Coopersmith's musical stage play, \\"Haven\\" with music by William Goldstein and lyrics by Joe Darion. The show's original title \\"Oswego - An American Haven\\" was named after Fort Oswego, the old army camp in Oswego, New York, where the refugees found themselves imprisoned upon their arrival in America. The 1993 transcript for \\"Oswego - An American Haven\\" can be found in the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC. At Gruber's request, the play's name was changed to \\"Haven\\" so that it would be more closely associated with her book. After the name change, the show was produced in 2001 by Robert Block at the Gindi Theater in Los Angeles. Gruber declared herself highly pleased with the musical version of her book, and celebrated her 90th birthday on stage after curtain call on opening night. In 1998, Coopersmith and Freeman joined forces again to create \\"Reflections of a Murder\\", a full-length non-musical mystery about the murder of a famous ballerina, and her charming son who is held as the primary suspect. It was produced at the Arena Stage Theatre on Long Island and was awarded Best New Play of 1998 by the Charlotte Repertory Theater Festival. Coopersmith's research led him to learn of the controversial relationship between illusionist Harry Houdini and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle over the subject of spiritualism. This inspired his one-act play \\"The Other Side\\" a drama which explores the conflict between Houdini and Doyle, who clashed over whether the dead can be reached. The play has been performed by Sherlock Holmes societies on both sides of the Atlantic. In America, the show was first performed in 2008 by the Baker Street Irregulars in the auditorium of the New York Bar Association. In 2009, the show was staged in London by the Sherlock Holmes Society at the historic 17th century pub \\"The Old Dr. Butler's Head\\". Other work Jerome Coopersmith wrote the children's book, \\"A Chanukah Fable for Christmas\\", illustrated by Syd Hoff, about a young Jewish boy dreaming for something to celebrate during Christmas time. Published by Putnam in 1969. Coopersmith was an Adjunct Professor at Hunter College and Brooklyn College spanning 1970 to 2009, teaching screenplay and television writing.

It is in Szczƒô≈õliwice Park, in the western part of Warsaw's Ochota district and it is the highest hill in the city. The biggest attraction of the hill is skiing at the Szczƒô≈õliwice Centre. History The hill was created as a dump for rubble from the destruction of Warsaw during the war, and later as a dump for trash. From 1967 to 1970 the dump was covered with earth and a park was created. By the 1980s, an illuminated slope with a ski lift already existed. The hill was 138 meters above sea level. In June 1997, the resort was leased for 30 years to Energopol Trade SA, which made the hill 14 m taller (raising it to 152 m above sea level) and built a chairlift. In the winter of 2005/2006 the center was closed as a result of conflict between the tenant and the City of Warsaw. In subsequent seasons 2006/07 and 2007/08 was opened for several winter months until September 2008, when an agreement was reached under which the city took over the equipment and buildings. Equipment The ski slope has an area of 9,500 square meters covered with a Dendix mat made in England, which at zero and positive temperatures is sprayed with a \\"water spray\\" to reduce friction and improve slipperiness, while at sub-zero temperatures and with the absence of, or low amounts of snow, can be covered by a snow cannon (initially installed in 1999). The camber (difference in height) of the slope is 44 m, which at its approximately 227 m gives the average slope of 19% (11¬∞), which in turn qualifies the route as blue (easy). The maximum slope is 17¬∞. At the bottom of the slope there are isolated practice runs with a length of approximately 60 m. The site has a chairlift with a capacity for 1200 people per hour (in winter) and 782 (in summer), and a ski lift with a capacity for 700 people per hour (winter and summer). There is an observation deck at the foot of the slope which is about 900 m¬≤. The hill is one of the 3 year-round ski sites in Poland, along with one in Pozna≈Ñ and the other in Bytom.

She also was the only woman guest invited at international bank conference events for some two decades.  Early life  Born Claire Evelyn Giannini in San Francisco, California, on December 30, 1904. Her father was Amadeo Peter Giannini, founder of the Bank of America. Her mother was Clorinda \\"Clara\\" Agnes Cuneo.

He died in 1949 and she then took over his seat on Bank of America's board of directors, becoming the bank's first female director. Her brother Lawrence died in 1952 and she took over his position in the bank also. Hoffman was deeply loyal to her father's banking principles and policies. Her relationships with the bank's management were often tempestuous, since they had their own different agendas as to how the bank should be managed. She resigned from the board of the Bank of America in 1985 because she felt the bank's executives were irresponsible in their management. The major issue she was disheartened over was the sale of the bank's World Headquarters at 555 California Street ‚Äì which she considered sacred as a testament to her father. She further protested showing her displeasure by boycotting the annual meeting of the board of directors in 1987. Hoffman credited her mother with teaching her how to focus on specific corporate goals. Women in business was uncommon at the time.

In 1965 President Lyndon Johnson asked her to be a director of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. President Nixon appointed her to the Financial Investment Advisory Panel of Amtrak in 1970. In 1972, she became the first female member of the Board of Regents of St. Mary's College. In 1973, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Arthur Burns and President Nixon asked Hoffman to become the governor of the Federal Reserve Board.

Some were the United States Chamber of Commerce, the Association of California County Treasurers, the Soroptimist Club of San Francisco, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, the U.S. Small Business Administration, the California Lieutenant Governors' Club and the San Francisco Opera company. Jackling House in ruins, circa 2007  Hobbies  Hoffman enjoyed ballroom dancing and golfing as hobbies. She also loved horseback riding and took it more seriously than just a hobby. On her 11-acre multimillion-dollar horse property in Woodside, California, she had stables for her horses. The property was known as the Jackling House Stables and Grounds. The stables separately were called \\"Champagne Paddock.\\"  Family  In 1930 Claire Giannini married Biff Hoffman, All-American sports star at Stanford University who was also an investment banker.

The charity has worked with Open House London, the Royal National Institute of Blind People, and the Art Fund. Audio description of London Zoo, by Andrew Sachs. Part of the London Beyond Sight project The 2012 London Beyond Sight campaign organised by VocalEyes recruited celebrities from London, such as Andrew Sachs, Alison Steadman and Barbara Windsor, to record audio descriptions of London landmarks so that they could be enjoyed by people who could not see them. In 2013 the project won a Jodi Award, for the best use of digital technology in widening access for disabled people and in 2016 the recordings were released under an open licence. On 8 October 2008, it set the Guinness World Record for the \\"largest audience for audio described theatre\\", one hundred and sixty-eight people, at a performance of Les Mis√©rables at the Queen's Theatre, on Shaftesbury Avenue, in London.

The goal of the commission was to establish an \\"accurate, complete and historical record of violations and abuses of human rights inflicted on persons by public institutions and holders of public office during periods of unconstitutional government.\\"Hayner, Priscilla. Unspeakable Truths. New York: Routledge, 2011. The Commission was formed after a new democratic party won the elections in 2000. The Commission covered human rights violations in Ghana from 1957 to 1993. It looked into government abuses and military coups staged by former president Jerry Rawlings. The members of the Commission worked until the end of 2004.  History  There were two main parties in Ghana when the country, then known as Gold Coast, was seeking independence. These parties were: Convention People's Party (CPP) which was a socialist based party who was pro-independence and the National Liberation Movement (Ghana) (NLM) which was a capitalist-oriented party opposed to unitary system of government and the radical approach of the C.P.P. . The United Party (Ghana) was a branch of the NLM and they worked together. Kwame Nkrumah was the leader of the CPP, which won the general elections of 1951, 1954 and 1956. He became the first president of Ghana when it gained independence from the British Empire in 1957. In 1960, Ghana became a republic and four years later, it became a one-party state where the CPP was the only party. As part of the 1964 constitutional amendments Nkrumah declared Ghana a one party state. In response to opposed views of his political opponents, Nkrumah introduced the Preventative Detention Act (PDA) which gave the President the power to arrest those whose actions appeared to him as not being conducive to public peace and order. The PDA was used as a tool to victimize and unlawfully incarcerate popular members and leaders of the NLM such as Baffour Osei Akoto, Chief linguist to the Asantehene( see, RE AKOTO & 7 others Supreme Court case) and Dr. J.B Danquah who was Nkrumah‚Äôs major political opponent at the time. = 1966 to 1981 = In 1966, Nhrumah's government was overthrown in a coup d'√©tat while he was away in Vietnam. The coup d'√©tat had massive support from the members of the NLM and UP governments. A general election was held in 1969 and was won by the Progress Party (Ghana), a branch of the NLM led by Kofi Abrefa Busia. The opposition was the National Alliance of Liberals. In 1972, a bloodless military coup led by Ignatius Kutu Acheampong, while Busia was in the United Kingdom, overthrew Busia's government and he created the National Redemption Council (NRC), a military government. In 1975, the government changed from the NRC to the Supreme Military Council (Ghana) still lead by Acheampong. In 1978, Acheampong was replaced by Fred Akuffo. Akuffo promised he would work towards a civilian rule within the next year. In 1979, a attempted military coup brought Rawlings and his Armed Forces Revolutionary Council, Ghana to power. He launched his military coup two weeks before the national election. The election was held and Rawlings lost. The country was returned to the People's National Party (Ghana), a successor party carrying out Nkrumah's legacy with the same ideologies. = 1981 to 2000 = In 1981, Rawlings held a military coup to regain power. His government, the Provisional National Defence Council (PNDC) remained in power until 1992. Rawlings declared a 'holy war' aimed \\"at restructuring national political institutions, establishing genuine democracy based on Ghanaian ideals and traditions, and rehabilitating the economy.\\" Rawlings banned all other political parties and suspended the constitution. In 1991, the PNDC set up a consultative assembly to draft a new constitution and to restore a new multiparty democracy. A year later, the new constitution was approved and political parties were unbanned. The PNDC changed into the National Democratic Congress (Ghana). After an election in 1992, observed by the Commonwealth of Nations, Rawlings was re-elected. In 1996, Rawlings was re-elected once again. The opposition won enough seats to oppose constitutional changes which was a true step in the path of democracy. In 2000, Rawlings was not allowed to run in the election because of the two term limit in the constitution. His party lost to the New Patriotic Party (NPP) and John Kufuor became president. This was the first peaceful democratic transition in over forty years in Ghana.  Commission = Establishment = In January 2002, the National Commission of Reconciliation began with the first government after Rawlings' reign. Nine commissioners were selected to carry out the commission. The commissioners consisted of six men and three women, all whom were Ghanaian. It was chaired by former Chief Justice K. E. Amua-Sekyi. There were one hundred and fifteen staff members. The Commission set up six committees such as legal profession, professional bodies other than legal, the press and student movements, security services and religious bodies and chiefs. The objective of the commission was to establish an accurate representation of the human rights violations between three time periods over forty years during political unrest. The Commission received over three million dollars to produce it and 66% (two million) was coming directly from the Ghanaian government. The rest of money came from foreign governments and foundations through donations and grants. It was given a year to complete its work and findings but it was able to extend the length for another six months when the hearings concluded in July 2004. The Commission allowed investigation into when the country was in political unrest after independence (1966‚Äì69, 1972‚Äì1979, and 1981‚Äì1993) and the human violations that went with it. = Mandate = The mandate allowed the commissioners to address killings, abductions, disappearances, detention, torture and illegal seizure of property. The Commissioners were allowed to look into other human rights violations if they found that it would help achieve reconciliation. They were allowed to search premises without mandate and those who refused to give access were bought to court. They received over 4,200 statements from victims of human rights abuses. Similar to South Africa, they had public hearings which brought more attention to the Commission. The hearings began in January 2003 and aired on the television and the radio. The Commission heard over two thousand testimonies from victims and seventy-nine alleged perpetrators. In the final report, the Commissioners wrote that \\"it tried to apply a very broad and liberal definition to each of the categories and types of violations in its mandate, and drew on international human rights law, humanitarian law principles and common law understanding of the violations\\". For example, they could categorize \\"mock-execution\\" as torture. = Findings = The report concludes that the government during these years highly contributed to the \\"legacy of human rights abuse\\" and concluded that law enforcement institutions and the military were responsible for the majority of the abuses and human rights violations. The events of the military coup in 1979 was one of the conclusions towards their findings.  1979 military coup  In 1979, Rawlings had been arrested for attempting a military coup against Acheampong. While in custody, he escaped with his soldiers and held an actual military coup. They executed six military officials who had previously served in the military including Lt. General Akwasi Afrifa, Rear Admiral Joy Amedume, Major General R.E.A Kotei, Colonel Roger Joseph Felli as well as two political leaders: Ignatius Kutu Acheampong and Akwasi Afrifa. They were executed on June 26, 1979. Three supreme court justices were killed during this coup as well. They imprisoned a dozen of high-ranked military official with sentences of up to fifteen years. There was over three hundred killings and abductions that happened during the coup. After this, Rawlings took over the government.  Publishing  The Commission ended their discussions in October 2004, and their report was published in April of the following year. They were reluctant to share it with the public because it was very expensive to make the report public. It was made clear that the human rights violations in Ghana do not compare to the human rights violations in other African countries which could be a reason why the government did not want to publish the report. = Recommendations = The report outlined a comprehensive reparation program that included apologies, memorials and monetary compensation, the return of stolen property and the establishment of medical trauma facilities. The Commission recommended monetary reparations for approximately 3000 victims of human rights violations during Rawlings' rule. The recommended reparations varied between $120 and $3,500 depending on the type of reparation needed. Those who lost property had it returned, while health and education benefits were also given. The commission gave these small amounts in a way to encourage the government to give more in reparations. This tactic worked and they gave 1.5 million dollars in reparation. The reparations came directly from the recommendations of the commission. By June 2007, the financial reparations had been paid. = Criticism = The government was criticized for appearing weak while they were trying reconcile the country. The government's actions contradicted the Commission and its actions towards reconciliation. Chris Dadzie, director of public education at the Commission for Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ), concludes that \\"more could have been done if the government had purposefully shown a gracious face ‚Ä¶ if government as government had purposely shown some graciousness, it would have negated some of the bitter expressions from other people.‚Äù There could have been more done with the commission and through the reparations There had been complaints about the reparations were not sufficient and the government has recognized that the amounts paid to the victims may have not been satisfactory. There were some institutional reforms that took place but police brutality has been on the rise in Ghana and the justice system cannot keep up. The Commission was criticized for allocating more importance to financial reparations than to restitution.

Historically, the laboratory techniques of isolation first developed in the field of bacteriology and parasitology (during the 19th century), before those in virology during the 20th century. Methods of microbial isolation have drastically changed over the past 50 years, from a labor perspective with increasing mechanization, and in regard to the technology involved, and hence speed and accuracy. History The laboratory techniques of isolating microbes first developed during the 19th century in the field of bacteriology and parasitology using light microscopy. Proper isolation techniques of virology did not exist prior to the 20th century. The methods of microbial isolation have drastically changed over the past 50 years, from a labor perspective with increasing mechanization, and in regard to the technologies involved, and with it speed and accuracy. General techniques In order to isolate a microbe from a natural, mixed population of living microbes, as present in the environment, for example in water or soil flora, or from living beings with skin flora, oral flora or gut flora, one has to separate it from the mix. Traditionally microbes have been cultured in order to identify the microbe(s) of interest based on its growth characteristics. Depending on the expected density and viability of microbes present in a liquid sample, physical methods to increase the gradient as for example serial dilution or centrifugation may be chosen. In order to isolate organisms in materials with high microbial content, such as sewage, soil or stool, serial dilutions will increase the chance of separating a mixture. In a liquid medium with few or no expected organisms, from an area that is normally sterile (such as CSF, blood inside the circulatory system) centrifugation, decanting the supernatant and using only the sediment will increase the chance to grow and isolate bacteria or the usually cell-associated viruses. If one expects or looks for a particularly fastidious organism, the microbiological culture and isolation techniques will have to be geared towards that microbe. For example, a bacterium that dies when exposed to air, can only be isolated if the sample is carried and processed under airless or anaerobic conditions. A bacterium that dies when exposed to room temperature (thermophilic) requires a pre-warmed transport container, and a microbe that dries and dies when carried on a cotton swab will need a viral transport medium before it can be cultured successfully. Bacterial and fungal culture=Inoculation= Laboratory technicians inoculate the sample onto certain solid agar plates with the streak plate method or into liquid culture medium, depending what the objective of the isolation is: * If one wants to isolate only a particular group of bacteria, such as Group A Streptococcus from a throat swab, one can use a selective medium that will suppress the growth of concomitant bacteria expected in the mix (by antibiotics present in the agar), so that only Streptococci are \\"selected\\", i.e. visibly stand out. To isolate fungi, Sabouraud agar can be used. Alternatively, lethal conditions for streptococci and gram negative bacteria like high salt concentrations in Mannitol salt agar favor survival of any staphylococci present in a sample of gut bacteria, and phenol red in the agar acts as a ph indicator showing if the bacteria are able to ferment mannitol by excreting acid into the medium. In other agar substances are added to exploit an organism's ability to produce a visible pigment (e.g. granada medium for Group B Streptococcus) which changes the bacterial colony's color, or to dissolve blood agar by hemolysis so that they can be more easily spotted. Some bacteria like Legionella species require particular nutrients or toxin binding as in charcoal to grow and therefore media such as Buffered charcoal yeast extract agar must be used. * If one wants to isolate as many or all strains possible, different nutrient media as well as enriched media, such as blood agar and chocolate agar and anaerobic culture media such as thioglycolate broth need to be inoculated. To enumerate the growth, bacteria can be suspended in molten agar before it becomes solid, and then poured into petri dishes, the so-called 'pour plate method' which is used in environmental microbiology and food microbiology (e.g. dairy testing) to establish the so-called 'aerobic plate count'. =Incubation= After the sample is inoculated into or onto the choice media, they are incubated under the appropriate atmospheric settings, such as aerobic, anaerobic or microaerophilic conditions or with added carbon dioxide (5%), at different temperature settings, for example 37 ¬∞C in an incubator or in a refrigerator for cold enrichment, under appropriate light, for example strictly without light wrapped in paper or in a dark bottle for scotochromogen mycobacteria, and for different lengths of time, because different bacteria grow at a different speed, varying from hours (Escherichia coli) to weeks (e.g.mycobacteria). At regular, serial intervals laboratory technicians and microbiologists inspect the media for signs of visible growth and record it. The inspection again has to occur under conditions favoring the isolate's survival, i.e. in an 'anaerobic chamber' for anaerobe bacteria for example, and under conditions that do not threaten the person looking at the plates from being infected by a particularly infectious microbe, i.e. under a biological safety cabinet for Yersinia pestis (plague) or Bacillus anthracis (anthrax) for example. =Identification= When bacteria have visibly grown, they are often still mixed. The identification of a microbe depends upon the isolation of an individual colony, as biochemical testing of a microbe to determine its different physiological features depends on a pure culture. To make a subculture, one again works in aseptic technique in microbiology, lifting a single colony off the agar surface with a loop and streaks the material into the 4 quadrants of an agar plate or all over if the colony was singular and did not look mixed. Gram staining the raw sample before incubation or staining freshly grown colony material helps to determine if a colony consists of uniformly appearing bacteria or is mixed, and the color, and shape of bacteria allow a first classification based on morphology. In clinical microbiology numerous other staining techniques for particular organisms are used (acid fast bacterial stain for mycobacteria). Immunological staining techniques, such as direct immunofluorescence have been developed for medically important pathogens that are slow growing (Auramine-rhodamine stain for mycobacteria) or difficult to grow (such as Legionella pneumophila species) and where the test result would alter standard management and empirical therapy. Biochemical testing of bacteria involves a set of agars in vials to separate motile from non-motile bacteria. In 1970 a miniaturized version was developed, called the analytical profile index. Successful identification via e.g. genome sequencing and genomics depends on pure cultures. Bacteria, culture-independent While the most rapid method to identify bacteria is by sequencing their 16S rRNA gene, which has been PCR- amplified beforehand, this method does not require isolation. Since most bacteria cannot be grown with conventional methods (particularly environmental or soil bacteria) metagenomics or metatranscriptomics are used, shotgun sequencing or PCR directed sequencing of the genome. Sequencing with mass spectrometry as in Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI-TOF MS) is used in the analysis of clinical specimens to look for pathogens. Whole genome sequencing is an option for a singular organism that cannot be sufficiently characterized for identification. Small DNA microarrays can also be used for identification.

The Commission was given a time limit of three years to complete its work and submit a report. Kostunica ordered the Commission to outline its own terms as far as the scope of the mandate. The Commission was eventually tasked with investigating the causes of conflicts in the territories of the Former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In February 2002, nearly a year after it was announced, the Commission began its work. During the years specified in the Commission's mandate (2001-2004), former President Slobodan Milosevic was standing trial before the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) on charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. The Commission had planned to fully cooperate with the ICTY and briefly entertained the idea of holding regional hearings throughout the former republic to gather evidence. In early 2003, Yugoslavia formally dissolved and became Serbia and Montenegro. This effectively ended the Commission as it relied on a mandate from the president of Yugoslavia, an office that no longer existed. As far as it is known, the Commission never conducted any interviews, held any hearings, or filed any reports.  Background  The ‚ÄúYugoslav idea‚Äù developed out of a desire expressed by Serbs and Croats to be independent from the former Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian Empires. Following World War I, Yugoslavia was created from the remains of these empires. However, there would be a number of reconstructions of the land until World War II. In 1945, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was officially established. The population of Yugoslavia was made up of two main ethnic groups. The Narodi included Croatians, Serbs, Macedonians, and Montenegrins. The Narodnosti were Albanians, Hungarians, Turks, and Slovenians. Originally, these groups lived relatively harmoniously. It was only in recent decades that major conflicts erupted. There have been four notable ethnically based conflicts in Yugoslavia: Serbs and Croats, Serbs and Muslims, Serbs and the multiethnic population of Sarajevo, and Muslims and Croats. Similarly, recent Yugoslavian history is marked by three main conflicts: war in Slovenia in 1991, war in Croatia in 1991, and war in Bosnia- Herzegovina in 1992. During the years of the Kosovo Conflict (1998‚Äì99), Yugoslavia saw a dramatic increase in anti-Serb propaganda which caused Serbs to react violently towards other ethnic groups, mostly Albanians. Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, a Serb himself, attempted to re-write the historical narrative by countering with his own propaganda to make the Serbs look like victims. It was well-known that the Serbs were the cause of many past conflicts in the region The violence between Serbs and Albanians created what Milo≈°eviƒá referred to as the \\"Kosovo problem\\". He believed that, although Albanians had the right to self-determination, they did not have a right to independence. The Kosovo region was historically and culturally significant to Serbs and needed to remain a part of Yugoslavia. On May 24, 1999 Milo≈°eviƒá was indicted on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity by the ICTY. However, he would stay in power until October 2000 when he lost the presidential election to Kostunica. On April 1, 2001 Yugoslavian authorities arrested Milo≈°eviƒá on charges of corruption and abuse of power. After a lengthy debate in the government, he was extradited to The Hague in July. Kostunica denounced the extradition, saying that it violated a policy in the Yugoslavian constitution which prohibited the extradition of criminals to other countries. The government maintained that because the UN is not a country, the policy does not apply. The formation of the Commission was formally announced by Kostunica in March 2001. It began its work in February 2002, nearly a year later. The Commission ended in early 2003, a year short of its mandated time limit. Since the Commission required a mandate from the president of Yugoslavia (a position that did not exist after the disbanding of Yugoslavia), the work could not be continued.  Mandate  Despite the fact the Kostunica authorized the Commission, he allowed the commissioners to outline their own terms. His only stipulation was that the Commission would have three years to conduct its work and submit a final report. Eventually the Commission was tasked with investigating the \\"causes and the course of events of all conflicts in the territory of the former Yugoslavia.\\" The Commission was state funded, but it also accepted private donations, though little funding came from outside the government. Although the funding came from the government, the Commission was in charge of determining how the budget would be spent. There was also a permanent staff that would work for the Commission. However, by August 2001, no funding or staff had been put in place yet. The staff positions were eventually filled with much of the staff being on loan from Kostunica's office. Two staff members resigned from their posts shortly after the Commission's work began in 2002. The Commission stated that it would work in full compliance with the ICTY and raised the idea of holding regional hearings across the former republic.  Criticism  Due to the premature end of the Commission, a formal report was never submitted. No hearings were ever held nor were any interviews ever conducted. The Commission faced much criticism from both domestic and international sources. Some Yugoslavian citizens pushed for more diversity in the Commission's staff. They felt that the commissioners were too close to Kostunica and thus their judgement was being influenced. It was clear that neither the Commission nor the government had any inclination to conduct a real investigation. Others worried that the Commission was trying to re-write history rather uncover the truth. International critics felt that the mandate needed to be clarified and streamlined. They also remarked on the fact that three years is an unusually long time for a truth commission to last.

The Commission was tasked to investigate the dispossession of land, and ‚Äúdetermine appropriate measures to be extended to descendants of slaves and indentured laborers.‚Äù It was ‚Äúunique in that it [dealt] with socio-economic class abuses\\" and explored the possibility of reparations. The inclusion of reparations, whether for individuals or communities, was a controversial decision within the country which aimed to correct inequality. The Commission attempted to cover more than 370 years, the longest period of time that a truth commission has ever covered. The Commission consisted of five members who were appointed by the then President Sir Anerood Jugnauth. The President selected Alex Boraine, the former deputy chair of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and four Mauritians to oversee the research and publication of a document consisting of seven volumes, and detailing over three centuries of Mauritian history. The Truth and Justice Commission documented the \\"economics of colonialism, slavery, and indentured servitude, the experiences of indentured Africans, Indians, and French engag√©s, and living and working conditions on sugar estates.\\" In order to aid Mauritians in reconciling the past the commission recommended: \\"1) memorializing slavery; 2) a better understanding and more inclusive account of Mauritian history and culture; 3) a better and increased protections of Mauritian heritage; 4) a less racist and elitist society; 5) a more democratic public life, and; 6) empowerment of Mauritians of African and Malagasy origin (Mauritian Creole people), as well as other recommendations to increase economic and social justice, particularly related to land issues and equitable and judicious use of the environment.\\" Many of these recommendations have yet to be acted upon.  Creation of Commission  The Truth and Justice Commission of Mauritius, beginning its work in February 2009, sought to explore the impact of slavery and indentured labour on the islands since colonization in 1638. Traditionally the historic narrative presented to Mauritians has been ‚Äúthe history of the ruling class consisting of French colons and their descendants.‚Äù Slavery and indentured labourers entry into the popular Mauritian historiography has been a recent phenomenon, something which the commission hoped to rectify. Uniquely the Mauritian Truth commission sought to ‚Äúinvestigate complaints of the dispossession of land, and to ‚Äòdetermine appropriate measures to be extended to descendants of slaves and indentures labours.‚Äô\\" The inclusion of reparations, whether for individuals or communities, was a controversial decision within the country which aimed to correct inequality. Despite the advance brought by the last century many of Afro-Malagasy origin are living in poverty, while descendants of the plantation class enjoy higher living conditions, and importantly land ownership. The Truth and Justice Commission wished to correct this land owning imbalance on the islands. Prime Minister Ramgoolam, calling for the creation of the commission, argued: > ‚ÄúYears have passed since slavery and indentured labor were abolished. The > horrors of such brutality and bondage no longer exist today. But such > treatment meted out to human beings does have its psychological impact, > which can be permanent and as destructive if not more so, compared to > physical slavery.‚Äù The Prime Minister outlined his hopes for the commission stating: > The history of our country is based on a continuous quest for freedom and > social justice. Our past has been marked by the forcible removal of > thousands of people from the mainland of Africa, Madagascar and Asia. These > are the darkest and most shameful pages of our history. The introduction of > indentured labour under slavish conditions was no less shameful and evil. Finally, the Prime Minister stated his hope that: > This Commission will pave the way to reconciliation, social justice and > national unity through the process of re-establishing the historical truth. > It is the legitimate expectation of everyone to know our true history. It is > only after we have been faced with this reality that we can consolidate > unity in our country. It is important therefore that we recognise our past > history and lay that past to rest so that we can move on to reconciliation, > justice and national unity.  History of Slavery and Indentured Servitude in Mauritius  Top line represents deaths.The Dutch East India Company introduced slavery to Mauritius in 1638. The labour force, largely from Batavia, were the preferred form of labour used by the Dutch. The company would maintain their control of the islands until 1710, leaving due to piracy, and the result of wars with both France and Britain. Before their exit however, the Dutch made several attempts to develop the slave trade in the Indian Ocean. The French were the next colonial power to enter the Mauritians, taking possession of what they named Isle de France, in 1715. The French continued the Dutch practice of using slave labour in the islands agricultural sector. The Islands were ceded to the French East India Company who began dividing the land, the upper classes receiving 126 hectares and the soldiers and workers being given 63 hectares. Throughout the French rule of the territory, until its loss following the Treaty of Paris of 1814, the slave trade would continue to grow in economic importance in the Indian Ocean. Following the defeat of Napoleon and the loss of Mauritius to Great Britain, the territory continued to rely upon slave labour until slavery's abolition in the British Empire in the 1830s. This would not end exploitation however, as the plantocracy, reliant upon cheap labour, turned to indentured labourers from India and China to work the fields. These labourers, having little rights, would be ruthlessly exploited by the planter class until the late colonial period.  Commissioners  * Dr. Alexander Boraine - Chairperson from January 2010 until release of the report. * Professor Robert Shell - Chairperson until November 2009. * Dr. Vijayalakshmi Teelock - Vice-Chairperson * Mr. Jacques David - Commissioner * Mr. Rephael Benjamin Moutou - Commissioner * Dr. Parmaseeven P. Veerapen - Commissioner * Mr. Lindsay Morvan - Commissioner until April 2009. During the first month of the Commission planning difficulties were experienced due to Professor Shell being unable to assume full-time chairmanship, visiting the Islands on three occasion during his tenure. A search began for a replacement, and with the aid of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Dr. Alex Boraine was selected. Dr. Boraine, a South African Professor of Law, was one of the main architects of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa, a commission often viewed as a model in the reconciliation process. Lindsay Morvan, due to personal reasons, was forced to resign as a member of the Commission in April 2010, replaced by Jacques David in July 2011.  Mandate  The Truth and Justice Commission sought to ‚Äúconduct inquiries into slavery and indentured labour in Mauritius during the colonial period.‚Äù The Commission had as its mandate: * Make an assessment of the consequences of slavery and indentured labour during the colonial period up to the present; * Conduct inquiries into slavery and indentured labour in Mauritius during the colonial period and, for that purpose, gather information and receive evidence from any person; * Determine appropriate reparative measures to be extended to descendants of slaves and indentured labourers; * Enquire into complaints, other than a frivolous and vexatious complaints, made by any person aggrieved by a dispossession or prescription of any land in which he/she claimed to have an interest; and * Prepare a comprehensive report of its activities, research and findings, based on factual and objective information and evidence received by it and submit the report to the President. In addition, the Commission also had an underlying mandate to promote reconciliation. In Mauritius, \\"reconciliation was seen by many as being possible, only if one did not talk about one‚Äôs history. This was no longer possible in contemporary Mauritius.\\"  Activities of the Commission  Collar worn by slaves. In order to carry out its mandate the Commission \\"focused on three aspects: History; consequences, and how to achieve a more just society.\\" To understand the 'Truth' of the past the Commission adopted the perspective of public historians, choosing to understand the perception of truth in Mauritian society, over a traditional historical understanding of the past often changing with new data. The commission conducted interviews, archival research, archival digs, and hearings while conducting their research, largely acting as oral historians. The Commission sought the impute of all members of the public, asking those who wished to participate to submit notices. Over 400 cases relevant to the mandate were received, resulting in 230 hearings spanning 2 years. While conducting inquiries the Commission, wishing to streamline the process, identified 9 areas of interest to be researched. The areas were: * Slave Trade and Indentured Immigration * The Economics of slavery and indenture * Land Issues * Culture, Ethnicity, and Identity * Health * Education * Demographic history and spatial distribution * Monitoring and Communication of the Commission * The territories of Rodrigues, Agalega, and Chagos. Originally scheduled to complete their report in June 2011 the Commission requested an extension to September, then October, and finally to completion on 25 November 2011. The delay was primarily due to administrative problems experienced while finalizing the report.  Findings and Recommendations  The Commission published its report in 2011 recommending: * ‚ÄúThat in the light of injustices suffered by descendants of slaves and indentured labourers, the Republic of Mauritius and other institutions make an official apology through the President of the Republic, the Prime Minister and private institutions connected with slavery and indenture, such as the Catholic Church, the Chamber of Commerce and the Mauritius Sugar Producers‚Äô Association.‚Äù * A memorial and Slave Museum be constructed to remember the inhuman treatment suffered by the victims constituting a crime against humanity. The Commission further recommended the 23rd of August be recognised as a Day of Remembrance and Reconciliation. * The creation of an enhanced Technical College to train adult Creoles in an attempt to increase equity within Mauritian society. Creole be introduced in schools to aid working class families in understanding course material. * The State, it is recommended, should consider granting small pieces of land to deserving citizens, and establish a ‚ÄúLand Monitoring and Research Unit‚Äù to assist persons in ‚Äútheir search for land which they believe [to be] rightly theirs.‚Äù The report makes over 300 recommendations to the Mauritian government. These largely detail ways in which to bring those persons affected by slavery and indentured labour out of poverty.  Impact and Criticism  The Truth and Justice Commission submitted its report to the President of Mauritius on 25 November 2011. In the subsequent 3 years several government committees were established to study the report and investigate which of the over 300 recommendations were to be implemented. These committees have provided little feedback and the implementation of recommendations made by the Commission has been so slow in coming that Parmaseeven Veerapen, a former commissioner, has accused the government committees of being little more than an \\"eyewash.\\" It is unclear if the recommendations forwarded to the government will ever be implemented throughout the country.

The first diesel-engined Bangor-class vessel, Melville served in the Battle of the Atlantic during the Second World War. After the war, she was transferred to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) under the same name and served until being broken up in 1961. Design and description The Bangor class was initially to be a scaled down minesweeper design of the in Royal Navy service.Brown, p. 124Chesneau (1980), p. 61 However due to the difficulty procuring diesel engines led to the small number of the diesel version being completed.

This may have been due to all the additions made during the war with the installation of ASDIC, radar and depth charges. The Bangor class came in two versions. Melville was of the diesel-powered version, being equipped with a 9-cylinder diesel engine driving two shafts that produced . This gave the ship a maximum speed of . The vessels carried of oil. The vessels had a complement of 6 officers and 77 ratings. Melville was singular among the diesel-powered Bangors by being armed with a single quick- firing (QF) /40 caliber Mk IV gun mounted forward. Melville was also fitted with a QF 2-pounder Mark VIII gun aft and was eventually fitted with single- mounted QF 20 mm Oerlikon guns on the bridge wings.Macpherson (1997), p. 58 For those Bangors assigned to convoy duty, they were armed with two depth charge launchers and two chutes for the 40 depth charges they carried. Service history Melville was ordered as part of the 1940‚Äì41 building programme. The minesweeper's keel was laid down on 17 December 1940 by Davie Shipbuilding at Lauzon, Quebec. The ship was launched on 7 June 1941 and commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy at Quebec City with the pennant number J263 on 4 December later that year.Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 187 After performing her work ups, Melville was assigned to the Western Local Escort Force (WLEF). In May 1942, the minesweeper was reassigned to Shelburne Force, a local convoy escort force deploying out of Shelburne, Nova Scotia. In September, the vessel was reallocated to WLEF and remained with them until February 1943. On 3 February Melville began a major refit at Lunenburg which was eventually completed at Halifax on 6 June. After the ship's return to service, Melville was assigned to Sydney Force, a local escort group that worked out of Sydney, Nova Scotia. The minesweeper remained with this unit until June 1945. The minesweeper was paid off on 18 August 1945 at Sydney. The ship was handed over to the RCMP in 1946 for conversion to a fisheries patrol vessel. The ship emerged in 1950 as the Cygnus.Colledge, p. 404 The vessel remained in RCMP service until 1961 when she was sold for scrap and broken up.

The Israeli government incorporated its territory within Jerusalem after the Israeli occupation of the West Bank in the 1967 Six-Day War. The village is regarded as neither part of the West Bank, nor part of Jerusalem. A United Nations report has described the villagers as \\"living in limbo.\\" In terms of local government it is treated together with the neighbouring village Al-Khas, to the west, as one unit. Historical background Nuaman itself is a tiny hamlet, built on a single street, and composed of roughly 25 houses, 13 of which existed, as shown by aerial photos of the period, before 1967. Since 1994, together with Al Khas to the west, Nuaman has been governed by a village council of five members appointed by the Palestinian Authority. The hamlet's name is an eponym, taken from that of the traveler, Nu'man Ben Bisher, who resided there, and its history of habitation goes back at least to 1900. Palestinians began to develop the hamlet of Nuaman on a windy plateau between Jerusalem and Bethlehem in the 1930s during the period of the British Mandatory Government of Palestine. Two families, Bedouin of the Ta'amreh tribe,.On the Ta'amreh see . moved there, the Shawarwa and Darawi, fashioning dwellings from hollowed-out caves initially, and then moving into tents, and finally stone houses. The area was planted with pine breaks, cypress groves, lemon and olive orchards, and vegetable plots, and, in addition they maintained a pastoral economy of grazing sheep. It lies at an altitude of 576 m above sea level and has a mean annual rainfall of 356 mm. Together with Al- Khas, Nuaman lies on 1,474 dunams of land, of which 1,294 are arable, though not particularly fertile, and 31 residential. Title to extensive parts of the Nuaman territory is held by families in Beit Sahour and Sur Baher. 1967 In 1967, when Israel occupied of the area, it made a military census that erred, according to B'Tselem, by defining Nuaman's population as residents of the West Bank. Since the head of a clan resided in Um A-Talla, all the villagers were registered as belonging to that village, and Nuaman was erased from the Israeli map, being renamed Mazmuriya, a reference to a nearby Roman archaeological site. In consequence, they were issued with West Bank identity cards, as opposed to the Israeli identity cards that were distributed to other Palestinian residents in the now municipally unified area of Jerusalem. The oversight transformed most of the townsfolk overnight into illegal residents of the area under Israeli law. As of 2006, the population consisted of some 220 people, of whom an exiguous minority (10%) retained Jerusalem identity cards, having migrated there from neighbouring villages..According to Levy () only one Nuaman resident had a Jerusalem blue card. The village was left undisturbed for over two decades. The lives and prospects of the Nuaman villagers have been affected since the mid 1990s by several developments. They were informed by the Jerusalem administration under Ehud Olmert in 1992/3 that no building would be permitted. A further threat arose with the establishment of the Israeli settlement of Har Homa in 1997, which then began to extend its growth over Nuaman's village land, and is planned to replace Nuaman itself. Secondly further confiscations were made to create a military zone. Thirdly, Israel requisitioned some 30 dunams of their land for the Mazmuriya trade terminal (2005), and fourthly, the Jerusalem Ring Road was routed in a way that cut through the hamlet. Finally, the Israeli Separation Barrier, which the Palestinians call the Apartheid Wall, girds the hamlet, cutting it off from Beit Sahour two hundred yards away. The barrier effectively cuts them off from the very West Bank where the Israeli authorities say they belong. Altogether the Wall spread over 2.89 km of the Nuaman-Khas village territory, confiscating 776 dunums of arable land and forest, while isolating Nuaman from its sister community. The Israeli authorities have over the past decades uprooted an estimated 1,000 olive trees, 150 grapevines and 1,000 stone-fruit trees from the joint Nuaman/Al-Khas lands. The anomalous registration has meant that the Jerusalem municipality refuses to supply Nuaman with water, sewage and garbage collecting systems, and denies the inhabitants permits to build houses by denying them a zoning and residential development plan. Garbage trucks are denied entrance. The water pipes to the village from the Palestinian Authority were frequently broken by Israeli bulldozing from 1998 through to 2003, however, it being presumed because in that regard the village was treated as though it were part of the Jerusalem municipality. Bulldozing work on the Separation Wall in May 2006 again uprooted the water mains connections and tore down the only electricity pylon serving the village. The Israeli High Court of Justice, hearing an appeal by the villagers gave the Israeli Ministry of the Interior and the Jerusalem Municipal Council 2 months to resolve the status of the village, as either part of the West Bank or of Jerusalem. No decision either way has ever been forthcoming, and the indeterminacy of their status leaves them in a legal limbo. Family members, mothers, grandmothers and children separated by a few hundred metres cannot visit each other in Nuaman if they lack the proper village ID. Couples who married are prohibited from building a proper home, so no new families can be established, and of 13 expected to marry in 2006, 2 were constrained to build elsewhere, in al-Khas Some of the infrastructural services they were refused by the Jerusalem authorities were met subsequently by the initiative of the Palestinian Authority. Young Nuaman women considering marriage find that their suitors are turned back by Israeli soldiers stationed at the village entrance. Other Palestinian suitors, from Jerusalem, back off because they would lose their Jerusalem residency rights if they marry a woman from Nuaman. Schooling Nuaman has no school. For two years after the Oslo Peace Agreements in 1993, Nuaman children continued to receive their education in Jerusalem. In 1995 they began to be turned away or expelled from schools in Sur Baher and Umm Tuba because of a decision made by the Israeli Ministry of Knowledge of Jerusalem municipality, and now must walk across a valley, through checkpoints daily, to schools in the West Bank. The distance they must travel on foot each day is 6 kilometres each way. The measures mean they must waste much time in travel, and are frequently late to school because of checkpoint delays. As a university student, Ashraf Jamal Shawawra, had to travel daily to Al-Quds University in nearby Abu Dis, testified that he had to strip to the waist every day at the Nuaman checkpoint, then walk to al-'Beidiyya Street, where transport was available, a trip taking 45 minutes in all weather. From there the bus to Abu Dis suffer would suffer frequent delays of up to 2 hours, to pass the Container checkpoint. In normal circumstances, a journey from Nuaman to the Abu Dis campus would take 20 minutes. It took him roughly 6 hours to make the trip both ways each day. Home demolitions The earliest demolition took place in 1986 when a garage was knocked down for lacking a permit. An order to desist from all building was given in 1993, and since then demolition orders have been delivered on several homes. Nidal Darawi, a schoolteacher, married and added a kitchen to their home in 2005. Border police noticed the change, and their home was demolished. His brother exclaimed to a reporter: \\"This is a threat to Israel? This was his blood and the blood of his children -- all of his savings.\\" Two houses were demolished on 31 December 2005. One, owned by Nidal Ahmad al- Dir'awi, a teacher by profession, had lacked a permit and he agreed to pay a fine of $12,000 in 2000 as a preliminary to obtaining one. It had cost him $30,000 to build. Siham Shawara (from al-Khas) married a man from Nuaman in 2002, and they, and their three young children, had their home demolished in 2010. Siham, who managed to graduate from Bethlehem University in Chemistry, recalls that a soldier on checkpoint duty once ripped up her chemistry textbook after deciding it would have been used for terroristic purposes. The family is now housed in a converted stable. By 2012, Israel had demolished 5 homes in Nuaman. Legal measures The High Court judgement giving the Israeli authorities 60 days to clarify the status of the village in the 1990s was never acted on. In response to a further petition in 2004 regarding the routing of the West Bank Barrier and a request the villagers be permitted access to Bethlehem, and a permit to stay in their village, the court ruled in 30 June 2004 that it was forbidden to arrest residents as being illegally present in Israel. An agreement drawn up by their lawyer, Shlomo Lacker, with the Israeli authorities was endorsed by the court on 22 March 2005, and gave them unimpeded access to the West Bank by law. The authorities also undertook not to hamper the routines of normal life in Nuaman. This agreement also foresaw the creation of a body of Israeli appointees to determine who could and could not reside in the hamlet. The villagers however stated that they had not consented to this agreement, and that in any case the authorities were in breach of its provisions. In 2009 the villagers of Nuaman had made two petitions to the Israeli Supreme Court requesting that the matter be resolved by either recognizing the village as an integral part of the West Bank, or by conceding its residents the status of residents of Jerusalem. Incidents In early 2003, Dvir Kahana, an Israeli working for a private company, turned up in Nuaman passing himself off as a representative of the Israeli government, for which his company was a subcontractor. He said that due to measures of closure they would soon find themselves like 'a tree without water', and therefore suggested that they sell their lands to him. The residents rebuffed the proposal adamantly. In December 2005 a labourer from Nuaman, Mahmoud Shawara (43), father of 9 children, living in a roofless structure lacking an Israeli building permit, set out on his mule to look for work in Umm Tuba which is designated as lying within Jerusalem's borders. He was arrested by Israel Border Police engaged in checking for illegal workers (shabahim) entering into Israel, but refused to be taken away by jeep since it would have meant abandoning his mule. Several hours later, the animal was seen dragging something at a gallop, and an Umm Tuba resident stopped it, and saw that an unconscious Shawara had had his hands roped to the mule, and was in a battered state. He stopped breathing, was revived, and taken to the Hadassah Medical Center and received in the intensive care ward where he died a week later. The cause of his death is unknown, and an Israeli police investigation closed the matter stating it was an accident caused by a fall from the mule. Nuaman residents stated that border police had a practice of tying illegals to their animals. Gideon Levy collected testimonies of several Palestinians regarding the practice, which involves placing a cinder block on the prone labourer, once tethered to an animal and then whipping it to drag the person away. Expulsion? The confiscation order delivered on 2 September 2007, claiming a further 22 dunams of agricultural land, had a notification attached demanding that those living on the expropriated territory leave immediately. From 1998 to 2003 Israel repeatedly closed the road linking the village to Bethlehem for periods of up to a month. In April/ May 2006, Israel locked the western entrance to the village, once used by villagers to go on foot to Al- Aqsa for prayers, by mounting a steel gate, and the road to Jerusalem has been partially destroyed by being ploughed over and blocked with dirt mounds. All transit through the village by vehicles other than personal cars is forbidden, including taxis and buses. A military checkpoint guards the other entrance, and no one other than Nuaman residents are permitted passage into the hamlet. Since May 2006, only Nu'man residents with West Bank IDs may enter the village, though even the resident doctor, Dr. Ibrahim Abu-Sitta al-Dir'awi, encounters delays and threats at the checkpoint to deny him entry to his home if he leaves the hamlet, and the new village lawyer, Labib Habib, who has an Israeli ID, is denied entry to consult with the villagers. Even the number of chickens one may carry back to one's home is subject to arbitrary rules, sometimes only one being allowed. An ambulance was refused entry when answering a call for help from the village and the child, bitten by a spider, had to be carried to the checkpoint to reach the ambulance and be taken to hospital. Ibrahim Darawi imputes to the Israelis an intention to force them to leave, calling it 'a quiet transfer.' The villagers themselves are not permitted to truck in heavy supplies like flour, fodder and gas cylinders but are required by the Israeli military to carry them on foot through the checkpoint to their homes 1.5 kilometers away. The former UN Special Rapporteur Richard Falk has endorsed this description, calling the constrictive policies applied to the village an example of \\"indirect forcible transfer.\\" According to B'Tselem, behind the restrictions on Nuaman lie a government policy which aims to maintain the demographic balance of Jerusalem by encouraging refusing to allow Palestinians to exceed the ceiling of 30% of the city's population, with measures that include forced expulsions. Israeli officials deny there is any wish to expel the villagers. Lt. Col. Shlomo Dror that Nuaman's difficulties will eventually be smoothed out. > \\"Some of them are not legally there, but we are not going to push anyone > out. We'll find a solution for this problem. Maybe, one day, the fence will > be in another place, or maybe that part of East Jerusalem will be part of > the West Bank.\\" Al-Haq claims that what Israel is doing in Nuaman is in clear violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention, and International Humanitarian Law, the former prohibiting \\"individual or mass forcible transfers\\". =Citations=References   * External links * Al Khas & An Nu'man Village (Fact Sheet), Applied Research Institute‚ÄìJerusalem, ARIJ * Al Khas & An Nu‚Äôman Village Profile, ARIJ * Al Khas & An Nu‚Äôman, aerial photo, ARIJ * The priorities and needs for development in Al Khas and An Nu'man village based on the community and local authorities‚Äô assessment, ARIJ Category:Arab neighborhoods in Jerusalem Category:Bethlehem Governorate Category:Villages in the West Bank ","title":"Nuaman"},{"id":"49147602","text":"Outlawed Guns is a 1935 American Western film directed by Ray Taylor and written by John T.

This may have been due to all the additions made during the war with the installation of ASDIC, radar and depth charges. The Bangor class came in two versions. Noranda was of the diesel- powered version, being equipped with a 9-cylinder diesel engine driving two shafts that produced . This gave the ship a maximum speed of . The vessels carried of oil. The vessels had a complement of 6 officers and 77 ratings. The Canadian diesel-powered Bangors were armed with a single quick-firing (QF) 12-pounder 12 cwt gun mounted forward.

In June 1943, WLEF's escorts were placed in groups, with Noranda joining W-9. She remained with that unit until May 1944 when the ship transferred to Sydney Force, a local escort force operating out of Sydney, Nova Scotia. Noranda underwent a major refit at Lunenburg, Nova Scotia from September to December 1944 before returning to service on 2 February 1945.

In January 2012, Haley shipped out for a year-long tour of duty in Afghanistan as a captain in the South Carolina Army National Guard. The unit served in Helmand Province as an Agribusiness Development Team helping Afghan farmers improve farming techniques and develop cash crops to replace opium poppies. Haley served as a liaison between the military and civilian authorities. He is thought to have been the first spouse of a governor to serve on active duty in a war zone.

Born in Hungary into a Jewish family, Isaacson was deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp with her mother and aunt in July 1944, where she spent eight months in forced labor in an underground munitions plant in Hessisch Lichtenau. After liberation, she married a United States intelligence officer and moved to his hometown of Lewiston, Maine. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees in mathematics in Maine colleges in the mid-1960s and taught at Lewiston High School and Bates College, serving as dean of women and dean of students at the latter institution. Her 1990 memoir, Seed of Sarah: Memoirs of a Survivor, inspired a 1995 electronic chamber opera and a 1998 experimental film. The recipient of numerous awards and three honorary degrees, Isaacson was inducted into the Maine Women's Hall of Fame in 2004. Early life and deportation to Auschwitz Born Judit Magyar in Kaposv√°r, Hungary, she was the daughter of Jeno and R√≥zsi (Rose) Magyar. She attended the gimnazium (high school) in that city and was valedictorian of her graduating class. Her plans to study literature at the Sorbonne were halted by the Nazi occupation of Hungary in March 1944. In May she and her family were incarcerated in a ghetto, from which her father and uncles were taken for forced labor. On July 2, 1944, one day before her nineteenth birthday, she was deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp with her mother, grandmothers, and aunts. While her grandmothers and one aunt were immediately sent to the gas chamber, she managed to stay together with her mother and another aunt, Magda Rosenberger. Her father was transported to a Hungarian labor camp and from there to the Buchenwald concentration camp; at the end of the war, he died of starvation at the M√ºhldorf subcamp. The three women remained at Auschwitz until late August 1944, when they were transported to Hessisch Lichtenau for forced labor in an underground munitions plant. In April 1945 they were transferred to the Tekla camp near Leipzig, where they were liberated by U.S. troops the same month. During their wait for a transport back to Hungary, in May 1945, Judith met Irving Isaacson, an intelligence officer for the U.S. Army Office of Strategic Services, who reportedly \\"fell in love with her on the spot\\". The couple married at the Nuremberg City Hall in December 1945, and Isaacson, a lawyer in private life, arranged for her, her mother and aunt to immigrate to his hometown of Lewiston, Maine the next year. Teaching career Following the birth of her third child in 1960, Isaacson became interested in studying mathematics through a program on public television. She went on to attain a bachelor's degree in mathematics at Bates College in 1965, and a master's degree in mathematics at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, in 1967. After earning her bachelor's degree, she began teaching math at Lewiston High School and chaired that school's department of mathematics. In 1968 she joined Bates College as lecturer in mathematics and computer science, becoming Bates' first computer science teacher. In 1969 she was appointed dean of women at Bates. During her interview, a member of the selection committee asked if she had ever resided in a dormitory, and she replied, \\"Yes, at Auschwitz\\". In 1975 she became the first dean of students at Bates. In the latter position, she successfully ended the \\"unequal and antiquated codes of social conduct for men and women\\", including a prohibition against students visiting the dorm rooms of students of the opposite sex, and improved the athletic opportunities for women students. She retired in August 1978. Speaker and author Isaacson willingly shared her wartime experiences with students and friends. In 1976, while speaking to a group of students after the showing of a Holocaust film on campus, a student asked her \\"how she could smile after everything she had been through\\", and she did not have a satisfactory answer. That night, she dreamed of her Holocaust experiences, and began writing her memoirs the next morning. She revisited her Hungarian hometown to conduct research for the book, which was published in 1990 as Seed of Sarah: Memoirs of a Survivor. The epigram of the book contains a verse from Hungarian poet Endre Ady: All who live, rejoice, rejoice. The book was later translated into German as Freut Euch Ihr Lebenden, Freut Euch (Rejoice, You Who Live, Rejoice) and into Hungarian as Koszonet Az Eletert (Thank You for Life). In 1991, Seed of Sarah was included on the New York Public Library list of \\"Books for the Teen Age\\". The book made Isaacson a popular speaker for schools, youth groups, and community groups throughout Maine. Although she planned to write a sequel, she did not find the time due to her speaking schedule. In 1995 Mark Polishook composed an electronic chamber opera for one voice called Seed of Sarah, which was made into a 28-minute experimental film by director Andrea Weiss in 1998. Isaacson read portions of her book on the film soundtrack. Isaacson recorded an oral history interview with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 1993, and contributed a chapter on her life experiences to the 1999 book A Heart of Wisdom: Making the Jewish journey from midlife through the elder years (Jewish Lights Publishing). Memberships She was a member of the Bowdoin College Board of Overseers from 1984 to 1996. She was also a board member of the Auburn Public Library, Central Maine Medical Center (CMMC), and the CMMC School of Nursing and Health Professions. She was a director of the Holocaust and Human Rights Center of Maine in the late 1980s. Honors and awards Isaacson received honorary degrees from Bates College (Doctor of Laws, 1994), Colby College, and the University of New England. She was a recipient of the Deborah Morton Award for outstanding women from Westbrook College in 1993, the Gordon S. Hargraves Preservation of Freedom Prize from Bowdoin College in 1996, the Maryann Hartman Award for distinguished Maine women from the University of Southern Maine, and the Remember Me Award from the Maine Healthcare Association. In 2003 she was honored as one of the Women of Distinction by the Kennebec Council of the Girl Scouts. In 2004 she was inducted into the Maine Women's Hall of Fame. In 1987 she was a guest of the city of Hessisch Lichtenau, where she had been a forced laborer in a munitions plant during the war, on the occasion of their dedication of a monument to victims of the Holocaust. Personal Despite her wartime experience, Isaacson was \\"a warm and humorous optimist\\". Bates Holocaust professor Steve Hochstadt described her as \\"an extraordinarily joyous person who could tell you about very sad things that happened to her, her relatives and her friends, but who was able to retain joy in life\\". She was fluent in five languages: Hungarian, German, French, Latin, and English. She and her husband Irving Isaacson, who survived her, had two sons and a daughter. She died on November 10, 2015, at the age of 90 at her home in Auburn, Maine.

Harger, the son of Alfred Harger, a farmer and land surveyor of Huguenot descent, was born in Oxford, New Haven County, Conn, January 12, 1843. He graduated from Yale College in 1868. He was obliged throughout his college course to maintain himself by teaching and mathematical work, and he perhaps injured his health permanently by the severe economy which he practiced at that time. In his boyhood he had been an enthusiastic student of botany, and his success in this department of natural history led him on graduation to take up the study of zoology with Professor Verrill of the Sheffield Scientific School. He had already shown his special aptitude for original work and had begun important investigations, when he accepted in 1870 the position of Assistant in Paleontology under Professor Marsh, which he retained until his death. He continued, however, his investigations in invertebrate zoology, as long as his health allowed; of his publications in this field the most important is a valuable \\"Report on the Marine Isopoda of New England and the Adjacent Waters\\" (in the Report of the United States Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries for 1878). His best work and highest attainments, however, were in the department of vertebrate paleontology. In 1879 he was attacked by cardiac trouble, which increased from year to year. He continued engaged in his regular duties, until prostrated by cerebral hemorrhage on Monday, October 31, 1887. He died on the following Sunday, November 6, in his 45th year. He married, May 13, 1875, Jessie Craig, of New Haven, who survived him without children. He is commemorated in the genus Hargeria, a fossil bird, and the species Miacis hargeri, an extinct carnivorous mammal.

History  Two brothers, Tyler Catalana and Justin Catalana, started Fort Point in 2014. The pair owned a small restaurant and brewery, Mill Valley Beerworks, in Mill Valley, California; Mill Valley Beerworks employee Mike Schnebeck joined the Catalanas as head brewer at the new beer-only venture. Their brewery is located in the Presidio of San Francisco's Crissy Field, overlooking Fort Point. They are a member of the San Francisco Brewers Guild. They began canning their beers in 2015, selling them in local San Francisco retailers. Uniquely, they are serving as their own distributors. In 2016, Fort Point opened a kiosk at the Ferry Building in San Francisco. The kiosk includes six tap handles, with beer delivered daily from the brewery, and available in pints or to-go in growlers.  Production  Fort Point's beer lineup focuses on everyday session beers designed to compete with popular macrobrewers such as Stella Artois or Budweiser rather than other local microbrewers. They brew four core beers: KSA (a kolsch-style ale), Villager (an IPA), Westfalia (a red ale), and Park (a witbier), as well as a host of seasonal and special releases. They brewed a special beer designed to be paired with food, Tosca, exclusively for local restaurant Tosca Cafe. In 2015, they won a Good Food Award for Manzanita, a smoked altbier with manzanita wood. In 2014, their production was 2,000 barrels; by 2015, they produced 6,000 barrels of beer. The brewery currently produces over 20,000 barrels a year and plans to produce 30,000 in 2018.

She lives in London. Her most prominent work has been made within the long- standing artist collective Boyle Family which she founded in the 1980s with her partner Mark Boyle (1934 - 2005). The collaborative group also includes their two children Sebastian Boyle (b. 1962) and Georgia Boyle (b.1963).  Boyle Family  One of Boyle Family's most renowned works is World Series or Journey to the Surface of the Earth which began at a party at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London in 1968, where Joan Hills and Mark Boyle invited the guests to throw darts at a 1:10,000,000 map of the world. The exact points where the darts landed have been the focus and source material for photographic, sculptural and film works. The introduction of chance (and performance) within the conception of the work aligns their approach with Fluxus although their pared back, literal copying (casting) of plain urban environments often looks like Minimalism. Boyle Family's work is held within collections including The National Galleries of Scotland and The Scottish Parliament. In 1978 the Boyle Family went to Venice to participate in the Venice Biennale, selected to exhibit in the British Pavilion. The work was made collaboratively but was labelled as Mark Boyle's. By the end of 1978 they were exhibiting as 'Mark Boyle and Joan Hills', but it took until the mid 1980s for them to start exhibiting as Boyle Family.  Formative years of collaboration  In the 1950s Joan Hills lived in Sussex and had a son, Cameron Hills (b.1952), who was initially also involved in Boyle Family art projects. Joan Hills and Mark Boyle met in April 1957 in Harrogate, Yorkshire. At that point Mark Boyle considered himself a poet and it was only after experimenting with Joan Hills' paints that he became involved in Visual arts. Mark Boyle cited Joan Hills as one of his greatest influences, saying she was \\"she was gentle, brave and immensely resourceful\\" in an interview with Henry Lydiate. The couple then moved onto making Assemblage (art) a progression towards the sculptural work which forms much of their oeuvre as Boyle Family. During the 1960s they were heavily involved in the Psychedelic era night club and Happening scene in England, pioneering the use of transparent surfaces, oil, acid, body fluids and collaged images combined with projectors to create Liquid light shows. During this era they worked with rock band Soft Machine and musician Jimi Hendrix, regularly performing at the UFO nightclub in London.  Later life  Joan Hills and Mark Boyle married in 1999. Mark Boyle died in 2005.

It was founded in 1983 by Carolie and Tom Hensley, owners of The Cotton Patch, a quilting and sewing supplies store in Lafayette, CA. Roberta Horton, a friend of Carolie's, wanted to publish a book on Amish-inspired quilting, so Carolie and Tom raised money from friends and followed do-it-yourself advice from a library book to publish their very first book, An Amish Adventure. The first edition sold 90,000 copies. The business grew from there, and Carolie and Tom's sons, Todd and Tony Hensley, purchased it from their parents in 1990. Since then, C&T; has introduced two new imprints: Stash Books and FunStitch Studio, as well as a website, Patternspot.com, where quilt patterns can be posted and purchased directly by consumers. C&T; Publishing has also made efforts to become more environmentally friendly, becoming a certified Bay Area Green Business especially in light of the trend for green quilting projects. In Summer 2015, C&T; also acquired Kansas City Star Quilts. Authors published with C&T; include Barbara Brackman, Yvonne Porcella, and Michael James. C&T; Publishing books are distributed in the book trade by National Book Network and in the UK by Search Press (since 2014).  Stash Books  The 2010 launch of this imprint, which publishes handmade fabric arts books at lower price points than C&T;‚Äôs other books, signaled C&T;'s new focus on the book trade (the company had previously sold mainly to quilt stores and craft chains and through craft distributors). The books have minimalistic aesthetic with a lot of white space and set-shot photography. Publisher's Weekly called the launch \\"a key factor in driving up sales\\" for C&T; Publishing, leading to a 47% increase in sales in 2010. 10 of the books published in 2010 under Stash Books were reprinted within the following year. As of 2014, Stash Books made up about half of the publisher's catalogue. One of the books from this imprint, Sew Adorkable by Samarra Khaja, won the Gold in the Craft Book category in the PubWest Book Design Awards in 2016.  FunStitch Studio  The success of the Stash Books imprint led to the creation of FunStitch Studio, an imprint aimed at kids ages 8‚Äì14, in 2013. This imprint released 12 titles within its first year, and C&T; Publishing's best-selling book of 2013, We Love to Sew, by Annabel Wrigley came from this imprint. The imprint then released 10 titles in 2014. Due to the success of this imprint and Stash Books, C&T; Publishing was named one of Publisher Weekly's 11 Fast-Growing Independent Publishers for 2013. Two of the books from this imprint, The Amazing Stitching Handbook for Kids by Kristin Nicholas and Girl's Guide to DIY Fashion by Rachel Low, won the Silver and Gold respectively in the Craft Book category in the PubWest Book Design Awards in 2016.

It is the first book in The Dark Artifices, which is chronologically fourth in The Shadowhunter Chronicles. The book follows the events that occur in the Los Angeles area in 2012, focusing on the residents of the Los Angeles Institute. The title was based upon Annabel Lee by Edgar Allan Poe and all of the chapter titles are lines from the poem. Plot Emma Carstairs has been living with the Blackthorn family: her parabatai, Julian; his siblings Livvy, Ty, Dru, and Tavvy; and their uncle, Arthur, in the Los Angeles Institute since her parents' deaths during the Dark War five years ago. Having grown into a prodigious Shadowhunter, she is still investigating the true cause of her parents' demise, despite the Clave telling her that they were killed by the late Sebastian Morgenstern. According to Johnny Rook, a mundane shopkeeper from the Shadow Market, similar murders befell eleven faeries, whose kind are ostracized by the Clave under the Cold Peace for their support of the Endarkened. Later, Emma also investigates a mundane murdered apparently by the same culprit who killed the faeries. Ty's research points to the victims being killed inside sacred locations known as the ley lines as part of a dark ritual. Meanwhile, Julian struggles between running the Institute, since Arthur is functionally insane by his previous experiences in Faerie, and his love for Emma, despite parabatai being forbidden from pursuing a romantic relationship. He gets the medication for Arthur's illness from Malcolm Fade, the High Warlock of Los Angeles. Diana Wrayburn occasionally helps the younger Shadowhunters with the upkeep of the Institute, but refuses to replace Arthur as leader and frequently leaves for other missions. One day, the Wild Hunt, a group of traveling faeries led by Gwyn ap Nudd, arrive to deliver Mark, the eldest Blackthorn brother, kidnapped by them during the Dark War. They demand that the Shadowhunters solve the faeries' murders‚Äîsecretly, because of the Cold Peace‚Äîor else they will take Mark back. Changed by his time in Faerie, Mark finds solace only in Cristina Rosales, a Shadowhunter from the Mexico City Institute currently staying in Los Angeles. With Mark's help, Emma finds a cave which serves as a convergence point for the ley lines, managing to take evidences before being attacked by demons. Ty's research about the mundane victim points them to the victim's girlfriend, who has committed suicide in her house. Taking an invitation to the \\"Lottery\\", Emma and Julian are attacked by demons and the latter is gravely injured. Despite this, Emma manages to heal him quickly. Ty and Livvy translate the evidences from the cave and are puzzled to find that they are passages from \\"Annabel Lee\\", the last poem by Edgar Allan Poe. Meanwhile, Emma, Julian, Mark, and Cristina attend the Lottery and see that it is held by a cult whose members kill to achieve luck. Emma and Julian question Rook further, learning the place where Casper Sterling, the latest winner of the Lottery, currently lives and that the Lottery's participants are followers of the mysterious Guardian, before being shooed away when they and Ty meet his son, Kit. Emma goes back to the cave and finds a portal which transports her to the sea. Julian, through his parabatai bond, rescues her. They subsequently admit their love for each. Eventually, Ty completely translates the runes carved onto the victims' bodies and learns that the ritual, which requires thirteen sacrifices, also demands a Blackthorn blood. Emma and Cristina race to capture Sterling, but are too late to stop him from murdering the thirteenth victim, a witch. Sterling himself is murdered by the Followers, his hand cut and taken. The two unexpectedly meet with Diego Rosales, Cristina's ex-boyfriend and the reason why she left Mexico City. Diego is a Centurion‚Äîgraduates of Scholomanche‚Äîand claims that he was sent to investigate the Guardian's ritual, whose goal is to resurrect someone. Back home, the Blackthorns connect the ritual to an old Shadowhunter folktale, \\"Lady Midnight\\". In the story, a woman was killed by her parents and her lover made a deal with the Faerie king to conduct a ritual which required Blackthorn blood and the Black Volume of the Dead. Meanwhile, Mark is visited several times by his boyfriend from the Wild Hunt, the Unseelie prince Kieran. Kieran becomes jealous of Mark's growing relationship with Cristina. When Kieran overhears Mark telling her Gwyn's weakness, he reports this to Gwyn, who comes alongside Iarlath, the right-hand man of the Unseelie King, to punish Mark by flagellation. Julian initially volunteers, but Emma, unable to see him being tortured, volunteers herself and is badly injured. This causes Mark to reject going back to the Wild Hunt and accept being a Shadowhunter. Eventually, the Blackthorns research their family history and find out that \\"Lady Midnight\\" is based on the story of Annabel Blackthorn, a Shadowhunter who fell in love with a warlock. Emma calls Rook, the latter admitting that he worked with the Guardian to trick the Lottery winners. By piecing together the clues, she realizes that Malcolm is the Guardian. However, before they can act, Malcolm has tricked Dru to give Tavvy to him. Kieran visits the Institute and, in goodwill, reveals two information: Iarlath is working with Malcolm, and Emma's parents were killed to test the resurrection spell. The group and Kieran go to the cave. Confronting Malcolm, he threatens to reveal Diana's secret before knocking her out. The younger Shadowhunters fight Malcolm and Emma manages to steal the Hand of Glory, which contains the hands of the Lottery winners. Upon being cornered, Emma opens the cave portal, sending Malcolm to be eaten by sea demons. The Shadowhunters head back home and are greeted by Clary Fairchild, Jace Herondale, and Inquisitor Lightwood, fresh from attending Simon Lovelace's and Isabelle Lightwood's engagement party. The three agree to let Mark stay at Los Angeles. Meanwhile, with Malcolm's death, Rook loses the protection on his house and is immediately killed by demons. Kit is rescued by Tessa Gray and Jem Carstairs and told that he is a descendant of the Lost Herondale. The two then take him to the Los Angeles Institute. Approaching Jem, Emma is told that parabatai who are in love with each other have strengthened runes, but they will also bring misery to everyone around them. With this in mind, she breaks up with Julian and pretends to date Mark. In the epilogue, Annabel Blackthorn opens her eyes. Characters *Emma Carstairs - a 17 year old Shadowhunter that has lived most of her life in the Los Angeles Institute with the Blackthorn family. She has brown eyes, long, pale blond hair, and pale skin. As an effect of working extraordinarily hard at her training, her body is strong, tough, and scarred. She has a deep scar up her right arm, which she got when she was young for hugging her sword Cortana. *Julian \\"Jules\\" Blackthorn - another 17 year old Shadowhunter who has lived his entire life at the Los Angeles Institute. He lives there alongside his siblings and Emma Carstairs, his best friend and parabatai. Julian has dark brown messy hair and the startling Blackthorn blue-green eyes, the color of the sea. He is described as tall and slender, lanky, with high cheekbones. As an artist, he is usually seen untidy or splattered with paint, and his nails are bitten. His hair is the color of dark chocolate and wildly wavy and he is said to be the kind of person to wear all black and pull his sleeves over his hands. *Mark Blackthorn - a Shadowhunter residing at the Los Angeles Institute and is one of the many Blackthorn children. He was a former Hunter who rode with the Wild Hunt. He and his older sister, Helen, have the same faerie mother known as Nerissa and are part-faerie. He is 21 years old as of 2012 and is described as being tall, thin, has broad shoulders, and bore the signature blue-green eyes of the Blackthorns. However, since Mark became part of the Wild Hunt; his right eye has since turned gold. Like Helen, he also has pointed ears and pale white-gold hair that curls in ringlets. As they both share their mother's faerie blood, both have a rather delicate bone structure. *Tiberius \\"Ty\\" Blackthorn - a Shadowhunter from the Los Angeles Institute and is very likely on the autistic spectrum. He is 15 years old as of 2012. Tiberius, unlike most of his siblings, has black hair and gray eyes, as opposed to the family's trademark brown hair and blue-green eyes. He and his twin sister Livvy were born with gray eyes, though hers had changed to blue- green since, though they both still have long lashes and Cupid's bow lips. Julian puts down Ty's ability to be different to sheer stubbornness. Ty is apparently also quite skinny. He is often considered by his family members as \\"fragile\\". *Livia \\"Livvy\\" Blackthorn - the twin sister of Tiberius Blackthorn, as well as the sister of Jules, Dru, and Tavvy, and the half-sister of Helen and Mark.

She has the Blackthorns' signature dark brown hair and blue-green eyes. She is quite tall for her age. As a child, she was already compact, expected to grow to be curvy unlike her mostly lanky siblings. Her body has since already gone through puberty early, showing off her curves to the point where Dru, at thirteen, has been mistaken for seventeen or eighteen years old by mundane boys. This has made her very self-conscious about her body because unlike most Shadowhunters who are wiry or muscular, she is round-bodied and doesn't fit into the gear designed for girls in her age group. She often wears her hair in two braids. Drusilla is quite shy and often feels self-conscious about her body. *Octavian \\"Tavvy\\" Blackthorn - a Shadowhunter of the Blackthorn family and is the youngest in their family. He resides in the Los Angeles Institute. He is 7 years old as of 2012. Tavvy shares the Blackthorn family's dark brown hair and blue-green eyes.

Arthur resembles his brother, Andrew Blackthorn, albeit smaller and paler. He has a slight figure, a round face, brown hair, and the trademark Blackthorn blue-green eyes. He also wears spectacles. He is often plagued by a curious madness and does not like to be disturbed. *Malcolm Fade - a very powerful warlock and the High Warlock of Los Angeles. Malcolm is a tall man with an angular face, white hair, and purple eyes. He is strangely attractive. He has the appearance of a twenty-seven-year-old man. *Kieran - a faerie and a member of the Wild Hunt. He is one of the Unseelie King's many children and is thus considered a prince of the Unseelie Court. Kieran is said to be beautiful ‚Äî inhumanly so ‚Äî and fierce. He has high cheekbones and wide spaced eyes, the left black and the right a deep silver. He is pale and his body is lithe and graceful. As a prince of Faerie, Kieran wears battered white gauntlets. His thick hair changes color ‚Äîspecifically colors of the sea, due in part to his nixie heritage‚Äî depending on his mood, from dark black when he was in a bad mood to a pale blue when he happy, though he could also change them at will. *Johnny Rook - a mysterious figure who ran a booth at the Los Angeles Shadow Market. He is described as having blond graying hair and blue eyes. Johnny rarely showed affection, but when he did, it was only for his son, Kit. *Christopher \\"Kit\\" Rook - a Shadowhunter who was raised as a mundane, previously unaware of his heritage. He was born Christopher Jonathan Herondale and is the son of the man who called himself Johnny Rook. He and his late mother, Rosemary are descendants of the notorious Tobias Herondale and his lost line as well a long line of royal-blooded faeries. He is described as having waves of gold hair and sky blue eyes. *Magnus Bane - The High Warlock of Brooklyn. Being over four centuries old, his life has since intertwined with several Shadowhunters and Downworlders over the centuries. Magnus stopped ageing at around 19 and thus looks quite young. Magnus has brown skin, is very tall, with a long and lean body. His warlock marks are his yellow-green \\"cat-like eyes\\" with vertical pupils and his lack of a belly button. He is also noted to have a somewhat Asian appearance, due to the curve of his eyes. He has dark black hair; his hairstyles has changed over the years, ranging from short and spiked to straight and shoulder length. He wears all kinds of make-up, such as glitter around his eyes, lipstick, and nail polish. He likes to flaunt his beauty by often dressing in flamboyant and glitzy ensembles, which is seen by some as strange, or unique. *Theresa \\"Tessa\\" Gray - an American warlock, particularly a new kind of warlock‚Äîthe rare half-Shadowhunter, half-Eidolon demon. She moved to London in 1878 and her life has since been entangled in the lives of the Nephilim. Tessa has smooth, thick, wavy brown hair, steely gray-blue eyes, an oval face, and a slender body. She is around 5'9. While she used to think herself average, several of her friends have noted that Tessa is pretty and beautiful; not conventionally beautiful, but kindly attractive. Being immortal, Tessa stopped aging young and appears like a young woman in her early twenties. *James \\"Jem\\" Carstairs - an inactive Shadowhunter and a former Silent Brother. Once an orphan living in the London Institute in the 1870s, along with his parabatai, Will Herondale, he is now a mortal who is over a hundred years old, cured of his illness. Jem's hair is dark brown, almost black, with only a single silver streak remaining, and his eyes are dark brown with gold flecks. Due to his stagnancy as a Silent Brother, Jem maintained his youthful appearance, looking like someone in his early twenties, though his wisdom and experiences in his long life as a Silent Brother reflects in his eyes.  Reception  The book has received mixed response since its publishing. Some reviews like the on thenational.ae suggests good things about the book, it says, \\"Clare¬ís imagination once again fills the pages with a thrilling world that promises political deviance, never-ending drama and unwavering love\\". The Palatinate.org.uk reviewed the book as, \\"Lady Midnight might not be Cassandra Clare¬ís best work, but fans of The Mortal Instruments and The Infernal Devices will still likely find it an interesting read.\\" Common Sense Media said that fans of the Shadowhunter Chronicles will love this book but anyone who is expecting something new will likely be disappointed. However, The Guardian also agreed that the book was overhyped and not the best work, calling it predictable. Another review appreciate the books, quoting, \\"The world in which Cassandra Clare has created in her Shadowhunter series is slightly chilling\\" Kirkus also praised the book saying that fans of her books will enjoy the new characters, who are full of 'secret ardor and murderous zeal.'

Its goal was to investigate the ‚Äúillegal detentions, assassinations, disappearances, torture, mistreatment, other attacks on the physical and mental integrity of persons; plus all violations of human rights, illicit narcotics trafficking and embezzlement of state funds between 1982 and 1990‚Äù, when former President Hiss√®ne Habr√© was in power.Hayner, Priscilla (2011).

The commission published the names and photographs of the worst perpetrators, and its work has been widely used by victims‚Äô families trying to seek justice. Its recommendations were however largely ignored by President D√©by‚Äôs regime.Hayner, Priscilla (2011). Unspeakable Truths: Transitional Justice and the Challenge of Truth Commissions. 711 Third Avenue, New York, NY 10017: Routledge. p.246  Background  African's fifth largest country, Chad, is a poor country suffering from inadequate structure and internal conflict. Its post-independence history has seen instability and violence, most of which was due to tensions between the mainly Arab-Muslim North and the predominantly Christian and animist South. In 1982, Hiss√®ne Habr√©, then defense minister, captured the capital, N'Djamena, and ousted the northerner President, Goukouki Oueddei. Habr√© began a programme of widespread repression including torture and killings, until he was himself overthrown by one of his former generals, the Libyan-backed Idriss Deby, in December 1990.  The Commission's Work = Formation and Mandate = One month after coming to power, the new president established by presidential decree \\"The Commission of Inquiry into the Crimes and Misappropriations Committed by Ex- President Habr√©, His Accomplices and/or Accessories\\". Its legitimacy came from the president himself, who gave the commission a broad mandate: \\"investigate the illegal imprisonments, detentions, assassinations, disappearances, tortures and practices of acts of barbarity, the mistreatment, the other attacks on the physical or mental integrity of persons, and all violations of human rights and illicit trafficking in narcotics\\", but also \\"audit the financial operations and bank accounts of the ex-president, his accomplices and/or accessories\\", as there were allegations of corruption and embezzlement. In order to fulfill this large mandate, the commission was given the right to investigate, collect documentation, take testimonies, confiscate material and \\"summon any natural or legal person in a position to assist it in the investigation\\". The commission was originally made up of 12 members: * President: Mahamat Hassane Abakar, first deputy prosecutor * 1st Vice- President: Ali Abdoulaye, director of Police Security Branch * 2nd Vice- President: Isseine Djibrine, principal police superintendent * Beassoum Ben N'Gassoro, magistrate * Dimanche Beramgoto, director of research in the Commissariat of the Interior and Security * Bemba Jonas, police officer * Wadar Moudalbaye, administrative officer in the sub-directorate of external finance * Sam Manang, military police warrant officer * Ousmane Mahamat, records clerk * Naindo Dalroh, records clerk * Secretaries : Madjitoloum Ngardedji, police secretary * Koh Djabou, magistrate's clerk = Difficulties = Despite the huge task it had to undertake, the commission was given limited resources. This led to numerous practical problems: for example, when starting their job, the commissioners were supplied with only two cars, neither of which was suited to travel to Chad‚Äôs desert regions. Because of that, they were not able to investigate personally in the provinces and outside of the capital. Even their work inside of N‚ÄôDjamena was impeded. Indeed, there was not enough office space available for the commission in the city. As a result, they had to use the former secret detention centre of the security forces, a place where many had been tortured and killed, as their headquarters. Many victims and potential witnesses were effectively scared of going back to that place and thus did not give testimonies the commission could have used. Commissioners were also regularly threatened by former DDS personnel, scaring some of them away from doing their job, to the extent that three quarters of them had to be replaced after six months.  Findings and Recommendations  Even though the commission faced many challenges, it managed to produce and publish in May 1992 a detailed report. It pointed to a minimum of 40,000 people killed and 200,000 cases of torture carried out by the security services, with the personal involvement of former President Hiss√®ne Habr√©. It revealed both the names and the photographs of the perpetrators, which had never been done by a Truth Commission before. In addition, it accused Habr√© and his ethnic community, the Goranana, of genocide against the Zaghawa community. It also uncovered the fact that the United States was directly involved in the abuses, providing training to the DDS personnel, on American soil as well as in N‚ÄôDjamena. Moreover, a US official worked with the DDS in their headquarters, where people were being tortured and killed. The report indicates as well that the US, along with France, Zaire and Egypt, contributed to the DDS budget. To avoid further abuses, the commission made several recommendations to the new government: * Set up an independent judiciary * Reform the security forces * Create a national Human Rights Commission * Prosecute the perpetrators, including Habr√©, in a lawful manner * Give symbolic reparations to victims notable perpetrators *Saleh Younous and sentenced to life in Chad for complicity in the Habr√© regime in Chad for complicity in the Habr√© regime https://trialinternational.org/latest- post/saleh-younous/ *Mahamat Djibrine,  Impact = National Impact = Idriss D√©by, who ordered the commission, did not follow up on its recommendations and alluded to a lack of resources to stop the publication of the report. Because of that and the fact that there were no public hearings, few Chadians have been aware of the commission‚Äôs work. Meanwhile, human rights abuses continued under D√©by's rule, and he even integrated into his government, as high officials, about 40 well-known perpetrators identified by the commission. Therefore, it seems his real goal in setting up the commission was only to show Habr√© as a criminal, to improve his own image and legitimize his rule. = International Impact = Nonetheless, the report having been leaked via a French publishing house, its findings have been known and used outside of Chad by victims seeking justice. Human rights advocates have used it in their attempts to put Habr√© on trial, since it helped them find witnesses. In september 2005, Hiss√®ne Habr√© was imprisoned in his Senegalese villa. His trial opened on July 20, 2015 in Dakar.

It was purposely built as a family residence by the Maltese nobility, and it is named after the Falson family. It is presently open to the public as a house-museum with seventeen rooms of historic domestic belongings and a number of antique collections. The building is believed to have been built in around 1495, probably incorporating parts of a 13th-century building. This makes it the second oldest building in Mdina, after the ground floor of Palazzo Santa Sofia. During the rule of the Order of St. John, the building might have received Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam, the first Grand Master in Malta. The building was further enlarged in the mid-16th century. Its architect is unknown, but the distinctive upper floor windows might be the work of Jacobo Dimeg. Palazzo Falson was acquired by Olof Frederick Gollcher in the 20th century, and he restored and altered parts of the building. It is now owned by a foundation established by Gollcher, and since 2007 it has been open to the public as the Palazzo Falson Historic House Museum, which is managed by the Fondazzjoni Patrimonju Malti, a Maltese heritage foundation. It displays permanent collections which originally belonged to Gollcher, and occasionally other temporary exhibits from private collections. The building was included on the Antiquities List of 1925, it has been a Grade 1 scheduled property since 1992, and is on the list of the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands. History The Falsone family was one of the prominent families of medieval Mdina, and its members were often involved in the city's municipal affairs. The earliest recorded reference to the family dates back to 1299. The site of Palazzo Falson was originally occupied by a building known as La Rocca. By the 13th century, a single-story house had been built, and eventually a synagogue existed on the site. According to Quentin Hughes, the ground floor of the present building was built in around 1495, probably incorporating parts of the synagogue. Changes to the fa√ßade, including a shift in the orientation of the building as well as the addition of a double serrated string course and the hood mould framing the main doorway were completed at this point. These features are typical of the Siculo-Norman style, prevalent in the period.https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/123456789/49376/1/Lehen%20is- Sewwa_1976_10_16_Bonnici_Arturo_Palazzi%20Medjevali.pdf Reuse of a Roman column (lower-left) and a pregnant window (upper-right), both as part of the rear fa√ßade According to tradition, soon after the arrival of the Order of St. John in Malta, Grand Master Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam visited the palace for a banquet after a ceremony in which he took possession of Mdina on 13 November 1530. L'Isle-Adam's visit to the Falsone residence in Mdina is documented by Giovanni Francesco Abela in his 1647 book Della Descrittione di Malta, and until recently, the residence in question was assumed to be Palazzo Falson. However, there is some uncertainty as who owned the palace at the time. Documents suggest that the building originally belonged to the Cumbo family, and that the main branch of the Falsone family never owned the palace. On the other hand, some sources claim that in the 16th century the building was owned by Ambrosio de Falsone, Head of the Town Council, and in 1524 it was inherited by his cousin, Vice-Admiral Michele Falsone. The latter is said to have made further changes to the building including the addition of mullioned windows on the second floor. These windows are sometimes known in Italian and Maltese architecture as bifora. The decorative windows were probably designed by the local architect Jacobo Dimeg (1464-1527). The palace's piano nobile is believed to have been added in the mid-16th century. The building eventually passed to Matteo Falson, who was the Master of the Rod. He fled to Sicily in 1574 after being persecuted by the Inquisition for his Lutheran views. The palace was seized by the Inquisition and it eventually passed to the Cumbo- Navarra family. In 1657, the palace belonged to Ugolino Cumbo Navarra, and on his death it was inherited by his aunt Guzmana Cassar. She passed the building to her nephew Federico Falsone, who was not a member of the main branch of the family and who probably never lived at the palace. The building eventually passed into the hands of the Muscati-Falsone-Navarra family, and by the 1920s it belonged to Count Francesco Palermo Navarra Bonici, a resident of Catania. Throughout the centuries a number of changes were made to the house, including a reduction in the size of the building by separating it into more than one tenement. In 1927, Olof Gollcher and his mother purchased part of the palace from Count Navarra Bonici for ¬£680, and he later bought the remaining part of the palace in 1938 for ¬£550.Galea; Balzan (2007) p. 9. Gollcher was an art collector, and he transferred his collections into the palace, which he called The Norman House since at the time its architectural features were considered to be Siculo-Norman. In 1929, the palace's fa√ßade was restored, but it was also modified in the process. Parts of the interior were also altered. The most significant changes Gollcher made can be seen in the courtyard where he built a Siculo-Renaissance inspired external staircase, as well as a pseudo Siculo-Norman fountain and a Byzantine-Romanesque folly.Galea; Balzan (2007) p. 15. He also added a pointed-arched doorway to complement the main portal of the fa√ßade. The palace is scheduled as a Grade 1 national monument, and it is also listed in the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands. =Olof Gollcher= The yard or garden Olof Frederick Gollcher was born in Valletta in 1889 to Chevalier Gustav Gollcher (1854-1922) and Elisa Gollcher n√©e Balbi (1857-1935). The family was of Swedish descent and owned a shipping business which still operates in Malta today, under the name of The Gollcher Group. In 1914 Gollcher joined the British Army and subsequently served in both World Wars, gaining the rank of Captain in 1945. In 1936 he was named Knight of Grace of the Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem. A year later he was appointed Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE). In 1947 he married Teresa ‚ÄòNella‚Äô Lucia n√©e Prior (1890-1962). Nella, was an officer in the Nursing Division of St. John‚Äôs Ambulance, later becoming an Honorary Secretary. Gollcher was a keen collector, artist and cultural enthusiast.Galea; Balzan (2007) p. 12. His vast collection includes paintings, furniture, Oriental carpets, silver, books and jewellery. He was also a member of Malta‚Äôs Antiquities Committee and secretary to both the International Institute of Mediterranean Archaeology and The Malta Underwater Archaeological Branch.Galea; Balzan (2007) p. 82. A number of archaeological items are presently exhibited at the museum. Capt. Gollcher intended the house and its collection to be opened to the public. After his death, in 1962, both were eventually made over to the Captain O F Gollcher OBE Art and Archaeological Foundation, but it was not until 2001 that restoration on the house and the collections began. The museum opened its doors to the public in 2007 and continues to operate under the management of Fondazzjoni Patrimonju Malti. =The museum and its collection= The Studio at Palazzo Falson The museum is divided into 17 rooms that aim to create the atmosphere of a home. They include a Kitchen, an Armoury, a Carpet Gallery, as well as Capt. Gollcher‚Äôs Library, Studio and Study. One of the rarest items in the museum, is the 10-hour French Revolution-era time piece. This watch is one of only three such watches that are known to survive by the maker Robert Robin (1742-1799). It is numbered the 2nd in the series. Robin had been King Louis XVI‚Äôs (r.1774-1791) favourite watch maker, but at the introduction of the Revolution‚Äôs Decimal time he produced this watch. Secondary entrance and exit Other items of particular note include the painting Portrait of a Boy attributed to the Spanish baroque artist Bartolom√© Esteban Murillo (1617-1682); four small pictures representing the Four Seasons traditionally attributed to the French painter Nicolas Poussin (1594-1665),Galea; Balzan (2007) pp. 45-49. and a landscape ink and wash sketch by the British 19th century artist and poet Edward Lear (1812-1888) made during one of his stays in Malta.Galea; Balzan (2007) p. 81. Engravings of importance include a series by Italian baroque artist Salvator Rosa (1615-1673).Galea; Balzan (2007) p. 39. The collection is not just limited to paintings and the decorative arts, but he also collected typical household objects or items of unique historical interest. One of the more intriguing items is a chastity belt, originally believed to have been worn during the Middle Ages as a sign of a woman‚Äôs fidelity while her husband was away at war. Nowadays the chastity belt is commonly thought to be a Victorian fabrication, and an item of curiosity.Galea; Balzan (2007) p. 21. The museum also has some Maltese earthenware containers traditionally used to cook rabbit stew. They are known as ‚ÄòIl-Baqra‚Äô which translates to ‚Äòthe cow‚Äô in Maltese and refers to the shape of the pot resembling that of a cow.Galea; Balzan (2007) p. 27. These pots have today fallen out of use. Gollcher had an extensive silverware collection, varying from decorative figurines to coffee pots and other tableware. Two large silver Nefs form part of the collection. A nef, or silver ship, would have been placed at the dinner table, not just as a decorative item but to contain and dispense salt, pepper and other spices down the table. At times, they were also used to hold napkins or cutlery. The Library Over his lifetime Capt. Gollcher amassed a collection of 4,500 books and manuscripts, presently still to be found in the library of the museum.Galea; Balzan (2007) p. 62. This impressive collection has been catalogued and the titles can be viewed on the website. A number of books have also been digitised in collaboration with the Hill Museum & Manuscript Library of Saint John‚Äôs University, Minnesota (U.S.) and one can view the digital versions upon special request. The collection covers a wide variety of subjects that reflect Capt. Gollcher‚Äôs varied interest, in art history, biographies and the two world wars, to mention but a few. He also collected Melitensia books (ie. books about the Maltese Islands or written by Maltese authors or published in Malta) including Giacomo Bosio‚Äôs 1594 Dell‚ÄôIstoria della Sacra Religione and its update by Bartolomeo Del Pozzo.Galea; Balzan (2007) p. 63. Another well- known book within the palazzo's rich collection is a travel guide named ‚ÄúBaedeker‚Äôs Northern France‚Äù, published in 1894. The Baedekers, have published more than 1.000 different editions for travellers, setting the standards for clarity and accuracy in maps. Besides, one can find a leather-bound 9th edition of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, published in 1875 and the History of the Knights of Malta (1728). Temporary Exhibitions  Palazzo Falson regularly holds temporary exhibitions which highlight particular objects from Capt. Gollcher‚Äôs collection that are complemented by artefacts loaned from other museums and private collections in Malta. The exhibitions are generally accompanied with the publication of a catalogue and a calendar of activities - such as gallery talks and children‚Äôs workshops. Remains of the original door of the building, on permanent display The first exhibition, held in 2009, was titled Whistles: From Rituals to Toys. A total of 150 different whistles were included in the exhibition, highlighting the varied uses of whistles throughout history. The exhibition included whistles ranging from antique Maltese whistles to bird calls as well as more modern examples. The exhibition was guest-curated by music historian Anna Borg Cardona. An exhibition on pipes followed in 2010. Smoking pipes had particular significance in Gollcher‚Äôs life. He belonged to a group of artists that called themselves the Confraternit√† della Pipa (Brotherhood of the Pipe). This group held regular exhibitions and festive gatherings.Galea; Balzan (2007) p. 29. The exhibition was titled Pipes: From Habit to Art and brought together over 160 pipes showcasing the history of pipes from all around the world. The exhibition was curated by Francesca Balzan. The 2011 exhibition was dedicated to scent bottles. Titled Scent Bottles: From Ceremony to Seduction, it showcased over 250 examples sourced from local private and museum collections. The exhibition was guest-curated by Joseph Galea Naudi. The exhibition Edward Lear: Watercolour and Words focused on the literary and artistic output of the British artist, poet and author Edward Lear, and was held in 2014. The show was dedicated primarily to Lear‚Äôs stay in Malta and married his water colours with his corresponding diary entries, highlighting the unique personality of the artist. The exhibition was guest-curated by John Varriano, Professor Emeritus of Art History at Mount Holyoke College, Massachusetts who published a book about Lear in Malta in conjunction with the exhibition. In 2015 the exhibition Watches: Timekeepers to Trendsetters dealt with the theme of antique watches. The exhibition was guest-curated by David Thompson, former senior curator of Horology at the British Museum. The exhibition brought together over 50 watches and a specially commissioned animation about French decimal time. The exhibition Snuff Boxes: From Accessories to Objets d‚ÄôArt opened in 2016. It brought together 200 snuff boxes and related artefacts, sourced from museum, ecclesiastical and never-seen-before private collections in a show that charted the history of the snuff box from the most stunning examples to the variety of boxes that were created to hold the once precious powder, snuff. The exhibition was curated by Francesca Balzan. Architecture Palazzo Falson has two stories, and it is built around a central courtyard. The ground floor is built in a vernacular style, possibly incorporating part of an earlier synagogue. The piano nobile is more ornate. The fa√ßade has Spanish influences, having a number of mullioned windows in the Catalan style. A two-tiered palline losanghe cornice separates the ground floor from the first floor, while a similar cornice but with a single tier is located at roof level. These cornices are similar to those found at Palazzo Santa Sofia in Mdina and Palazzo Montalto in Syracuse. There are also comparisons to Palazzo Maria in Sicily.http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Journal%20of%20Maltese%20Studies/Journal%20of%20Maltese%20Studies.%2017-18(1987-1988)/orig18cutajar.pdf Further reading *More details about the visit of the Grand Master, the days he stayed and the food served *During WWII the building was directly hit by an aerial bomb but has received minor damages in the courtyard References Notes Further reading   External links  * palazzofalson.com Falson Category:Mdina Category:15th-century establishments in Malta Category:Houses completed in the 15th century Category:Houses completed in the 16th century Category:Medieval Maltese architecture Category:Limestone buildings in Malta Category:Museums in Malta Category:Museums established in 2007 Category:Historic house museums in Malta Category:National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands ","title":"Palazzo Falson"},{"id":"49149737","text":"Jaegyu Knoll () is an undersea knoll (a submarine volcano) northwest of Rosamel Island in the Antarctic Sound.

This requirement involved only conducting one on one interviews without doing generalized press interviews and announcements. The magazine later, in 1986, split into versions that served Japan domestically, re-titled to Rockin'On Japan, and that covered international music content, titled Rockin'On. The current owner of the magazine is Yoichi Shibuya, who oversaw the expansions of the magazine and the creation of official music festivals sponsored by the magazine itself. Festivals and production The main festival created by the magazine is named Rock in Japan Festival and sets itself apart by having strict regulations banning moshing and stage-diving so that the festival is more open to the public and general music crowd. The other large festival created and sponsored by the magazine is named Countdown Japan and the two festivals make up the promotion arm of the magazine's focus on Japanese music. Music production is also sponsored by the magazine due to their creation of a music studio named Jackman Records.

Anderson Jardine, was an ordained priest of the Church of England and vicar of a parish in Darlington in the north of England. He is best known for performing the marriage ceremony of the Duke of Windsor and his fianc√©e Wallis Simpson, who thus became the Duchess of Windsor, in June 1937; this was a marriage that was seen as scandalous at the time. Jardine's offer to carry out the wedding, as a sacrament of a church which opposed it, cost him his career in England. An unprecedented marriage Following his abdication from the thrones of all his kingdoms and dominions in December 1936, the Duke of Windsor left England immediately to start the process of marrying Wallis Simpson, \\"the woman he loved\\". This process awaited the conclusion of a legally-required six-month period to allow the completion of Simpson's divorce from her husband Ernest Simpson. Following the conclusion of this period, it was the former King's strong desire to be married to Wallis under the auspices of the Church of England, the church of which he had been Supreme Governor. However, it was Church law at the time to forbid the re-marriage of divorced partners. The Bishop of Durham who warned Jardine that he was acting \\"without episcopal licence\\" The dilemma facing the Duke and his fianc√©e was heavily covered at the time in the British and European press. An obscure vicar from the North of England, the Rev. Robert Jardine, publicly volunteered to perform the ceremony. Press supporters of the wedding called Jardine, whose working- class parish was dominated by heavy industry, the \\"poor man's pastor\\". The marriage was set for 3 June 1937 in the Ch√¢teau de Cand√©, Wallis's French home in exile. Mr and Mrs Jardine, with their 19-year-old son, Donald, left Darlington on Monday 31 May, but Mrs Jardine and Donald stayed with relations in Letchworth, while Jardine crossed the Channel. The Bishop of Durham, Dr Herbert Hensley Henson, warned Jardine by telegram that he was ‚Äúwithout episcopal licence or consent to unite the Duke of Windsor and Mrs. Simpson.‚Äù The bishop did not have jurisdiction over Jardine's celebration of the sacraments while on the Continent, and under the immediate circumstances had no choice but to presume that the vicar had the permission of the Anglican bishop with jurisdiction.The Darlington vicar and a royal wedding in Evening Gazette dated 29 April 2011, accessed 4 March 2018 J. A. Kensit, a leader of the Protestant Truth Society, to which Jardine belonged, commented ‚ÄúMr Jardine is quite fearless in his advocacy of any cause which he judges right and would pursue his own line regardless of the consequences to himself.\\" The wedding was boycotted by almost the entire British establishment, and a small number of guests and a single pool reporter witnessed the wedding, which was conducted by Jardine \\"in a strong voice\\". Following the brief ceremony, the couple departed for a honeymoon in Austria, and Jardine returned home to Darlington, unsuccessfully attempting to return to his duties in his parish. However, he was soon made aware that he had performed an act which the church could not accept. His vestry committee resigned, and he was encouraged to follow them. Under pressure, he left England and emigrated to California. In 1943 Jardine published a memoir, At Long Last, of the unusual event. The marriage ceremony of the Duke and Duchess was not deemed to be a royal wedding. Letters patent, published just before the ceremony in the London Gazette as the Depriving Act of 1937, explicitly stated that the title of Royal Highness, which conveyed precedence, would be enjoyed by the Duke but not by the Duchess.

After the war Stringfellow married Green, and became an Episcopal minister. Shortly after joining the Confederate Army, Stringfellow became the \\"personal scout\\" for Confederate General J.E.B. Stuart. He crossed into Union territory on multiple missions, until the Union placed a $10,000 reward for his capture. American Civil War When war broke out, Stringfellow sought a commission in the Confederate Army. Despite four denials due to his fragile health (and 94 pound weight), Stringfellow eventually secured a commission as Captain in the 4th Virginia Cavalry (his brothers also served the Confederacy, although his cousins Pleasant and Robert Stringfellow served in the U.S. Army). Stringfellow rode with General J.E.B. Stuart at Seven Pines, Cold Harbor, and the raid at Catlett's Station. Stringfellow also rode with Colonel John Singleton Mosby of the 43rd Virginia Cavalry, most notably in the raid at Loudoun Heights on January 9, 1864. However, Stringfellow's fame derived from his confidential service, sometimes directly for General Robert E. Lee, but much through J.E.B. Stuart until his death in March 1864. By the end of the war, Stringfellow was known as the most dangerous man in the Confederacy, with a $10,000 bounty placed on his head. Stringfellow posed as a dental assistant in Alexandria, Virginia and gathered intelligence, and later even obtained a dental license and did the same in Washington, D.C. Unlike the plot line of the PBS drama Mercy Street, there is no evidence that Stringfellow was involved in any attempt on the life of President Abraham Lincoln. Postbellum Stringfellow would risk his life to visit, and court, Emma Green, who lived in Alexandria, Virginia, under Union occupation. Stringfellow refused to take the loyalty oath after the war and moved to Canada. He returned to Alexandria, Virginia in 1867, enrolling at what became the Virginia Theological Seminary and marrying his high school sweetheart, Emma Green with whom he had four children: Ida (born 1867), Alice Lee (Born 1871), Frank (born 1881) and John Stanton (born 1883). After graduating, from Virginia Theological Seminary, he was ordained an Episcopal priest in 1876. Rev. Stringfellow served in various parishes in Virginia, including in Franklin, Patrick, and Henry Counties. As rector, Rev. Stringfellow led the campaign that built Christ Episcopal Church in Martinsville in the 1890s, but moved on soon after the building was finished. At age 57, Rev. Stringfellow enlisted as a chaplain in the U.S. Army, after obtaining a reference from former President Grant, who noted Stringfellow had refrained from shooting him years earlier.http://www.ivyhill- historical.org/ihchpsnl14.pdf During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898, Stringfellow served as a minister for the camps. He considered ministry among fellow Confederate veterans as his mission, and often regaled audiences with stories about his military escapades. He also became the first chaplain of the Woodberry Forest School, a male boarding school in Madison, Virginia, which had been established by a fellow Mosby Ranger in 1889. During his postwar years, Stringfellow maintained contact with his Civil War era acquaintances. Notably, he continued correspondence with Jefferson Davis regarding the nature of the Confederate government during the war years. Stringfellow ultimately retired to Alexandria. He died in Lindsay, Virginia on June 8, 1913, and is buried beside his wife Emma at Ivy Hill Cemetery in Alexandria, Virginia.

Harris pleaded guilty in June 2018 in federal court to two counts of wire fraud, one count of making false statements to the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and one count of witness tampering, after having been indicted in January following allegations she stole $25,000 in federal funds by falsely claiming that damage from Superstorm Sandy forced her from her Coney Island home. Biography Harris has been a lifelong resident of Coney Island and the assembly district she represented. She graduated from John Dewey High School in Brooklyn in 1977. She has an associate‚Äôs degree in general studies from John Jay College of Criminal Justice, a bachelor‚Äôs degree in health and human services from St. Joseph's College, and a master‚Äôs degree in human development and family studies from Capella University. Prior to becoming an assemblywoman, she worked for the New York City Department of Correction as an officer on Riker's Island, and after she retired from that job, became a community activist who was well known locally for her work as head of Coney Island Generation Gap and for her advocacy and participation in relief efforts to help those who lost their homes or had damage to their property as a result of Hurricane Sandy. Election to the New York State Assembly On July 7, 2015, Alec Brook-Krasny, then the assemblyman for the 46th district, resigned to take a private sector job. Because of the timing of his resignation, the Democratic nominee for the special general election to fill the remainder of Brook-Krasny's term was selected by the Kings County Democratic Party Executive Committee, not a party primary election. Harris obtained the political backing and endorsement of several key local Brooklyn Democrats, including U.S. Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, New York State Assemblyman William Colton, New York State Senator Diane Savino, New York City Councilmen Mark Treyger and David Greenfield, and Brooklyn Democratic District Leader Nancy Tong, and was selected by the committee as the Democratic nominee. She also won the backing of the Working Families Party. After obtaining the Democratic nomination, Harris obtained more endorsements from local politicians, as well as from organizations such as labor unions local 1199-SEIU United Healthcare Workers, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association of the City of New York, District Council 37, the New York City and Vicinity District Council of Carpenters, the New York City Corrections Officers' Benevolent Association, the New York State AFL-CIO, and the United Federation of Teachers. In the special election held on November 3, 2015, Harris won by a margin of 62.9% to 37.1% over Lucretia Regina-Potter, who ran on both the Republican Party and Conservative Party Party lines. She was sworn into office the following month. With the victory, Harris became the first black woman to represent a majority white district in New York City. Harris won re-nomination in the Democratic primary in September 2016, defeating Katie A. Cucco, and was re-elected in the general election on November 8, 2016, defeating Regina- Potter again (Republican and Fusion), Mikhail Usher (Conservative), and Patrick Dwyer (Green). Indictment On January 9, 2018, Harris was indicted on two counts of wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, four counts of making false statements, two counts of bankruptcy fraud, one count of witness tampering, and one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice. The charges stemmed from false claims and statements alleged to have occurred following Superstorm Sandy, and were brought by Richard Donoghue, the interim United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. Harris was alleged to have stolen nearly $25,000 from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as well as money from other agencies including the New York City Council, the New York City Department of Youth and Community Development, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the New York City Build it Back Program. Prosecutors said Harris falsely claimed that she was forced out of her Coney Island home because of Hurricane Sandy damage, submitted fake lease agreements and rent receipts for a home in Staten Island while still in her Coney Island residence, and pocketed the FEMA cash. Harris was accused of \\"spending thousands [of the stolen funds] on lavish vacations and lingerie.\\" She then allegedly obstructed the investigation into her crimes and pressured witnesses to lie to the FBI and cover up her various fraud schemes. Harris allegedly commenced her criminal activity in 2012, before she held elective office, and continued it during her assembly tenure. She pleaded not guilty to the charges. Resignation from the assembly On April 2, 2018, two days after the assembly finished its deadline work on the New York State state budget, Harris resigned her seat in a letter to Carl Heastie, the assembly speaker, in order to address her criminal case. Guilty plea and sentencing Harris' trial was scheduled for July 2018, but in June, she pleaded guilty to four of the charges in the indictment ‚Äì two counts of wire fraud, one count of making false statements to FEMA, and one count of witness tampering. In September, she was ordered to forfeit $10,000 to the United States government, and on October 24, she was sentenced to six months in jail followed by three years of supervised release, 400 hours of community service, and restitution of $45,600 to the City of New York for the money stolen from Coney Island Generation Gap and $24,800 to the U.S. government for the money stolen from FEMA. She reported to prison on December 4, 2018 and served her sentence at Alderson, a minimum security federal prison camp, inmate locator 90597-053.

Painting from 1783 by Lorentz Svensson Sparrgren. Brita Margaretha Horn (1745 ‚Äì 13 March 1791), was a Swedish countess and courtier. She is known for being the love interest of Charles XIII of Sweden from 1765 to 1771, during which time Charles' wish to marry her was given political significance and used by the Caps and Hats parties during the Age of Liberty. She is also known for her correspondence with her spouse from 1775 to 1791, which has been partially published. Life Brita Horn was one of two children born to riksr√•d count Adam Horn af Ekebyholm (1717-1778) and countess Anna Katarina Meijerfelt (1722-1779), and the sister of general major Johan Gustaf Horn. Her father, a sympathizer of the Caps, was an infamous rake known for his parties and his many mistresses - the opera singer Carl Stenborg was reputed to be the half brother of Brita Horn, and among his more known lovers where the lady-in-waiting Hedda von Berchner, the actress Marie Baptiste, the dancer Ninon Dubois Le Clerc and the opera singer Elisabeth Olin: his death reportedly caused great fear that his correspondence would expose his former sexual partners to the public. Her mother was insane and lived with the Meijerfelt family, and her father tried without success to divorce her.Erdmann, Nils, Vid hovet och p√• adelsgodsen i 1700-talets Sverige: en tidskr√∂nika, Wahlstr√∂ms, Stockholm, 1926 From 1764 to 1775, Brita Horn served as hovfr√∂ken (maid of honour) to Queen Louisa Ulrika. =Life at court= In 1765, Prince Charles fell in love with Horn. A personal friend and confidante of Charles, count Claes Julius Ekeblad, commented: \\"It is assumed on good grounds, that the prince is in love with miss Horn. It is a love worthy of a prince\\", and characterizes Horn as a melancholic neurotic. \\"... she is possessed by a great deal of languish and a crippling prudishness: you never know if your words please her, because it takes almost nothing to offend her.\\" In parallel, Prince Frederick courted another lady in waiting, Ulla von Fersen, with the same intent. This is mentioned in the memoirs of the courtier Adolf Ludvig Hamilton from 1767, when he mentioned the love of the princes for \\"the maids of honor Brita Horn and Ulrika Fersen. Prince Charles' love for the first, prince Frederick's for the second, were both adjusted to the character of the two ladies. Miss Horn was blond, virtuous, sometimes cold, sometimes tender. She had almost made passion of her influence. Miss Fersen, funny, jolly, happy, capricious, considered the whole affair as a pastime which flattered her confidence and left it at that\\". Hamilton described a scene at Kina slott that summer: :\\"In one corner, the queen discussed politics, in another, the king talked about the hay- and oat prices with his equerry, the crown prince about fashion and France with Countess Ribbing (born L√∂wen). Prince Frederick bickered with his beauty [Ulla Fersen], Prince Charles stood faithfully by his [Brita Horn], but in silence. The crown princess stood changing feet in boredom - the rest of the court yawned or slept.\\" Both couples exchanged rings as a token of an unofficial engagement with the intent to marry. In both cases, the royal family was opposed to the love matches. However, while the family of Brita Horn supported a marriage between prince Charles and Brita Horn, the family of Ulla von Fersen opposed her marriage to prince Frederick. The desired love matches of the princes came to be used by the political parties during the Riksdag of 1769 following the December Crisis (1768). The Caps (party), supported by the family of Brita Horn, promised prince Charles the support of his love marriage with Brita Horn from the Riksdag against the will of the royal house in exchange for his support. As a counter attack, the Hats made the same offer to prince Frederick. This caused a crisis. However, the family of Ulla von Fersen refused to cooperate with the Hats as they did not wish the marriage to take place, and in 1770, they had Ulla von Fersen married. The same year, prince Charles was refused permission by his mother and elder brother to marry Brita Horn, and sent abroad on a trip to forget her. Upon his return in 1771, Brita Horn was selected to accompany the queen dowager Louisa Ulrika on her trip to Berlin in 1771-72, and during her absence Charles became the lover of Augusta von Fersen. Neither of the affairs were, as far as it is known, sexually consummated, and neither Horn nor von Fersen had any position of being a royal mistress. =Later life= In 1775, she resigned from court service upon her marriage to the courtier Count Claes Julius Ekeblad (1742-1808), a friend of her former love prince Charles. The marriage was childless but described as happy. The marriage between Brita Horn and Claes Julius Ekeblad was a love match, which is evident from their correspondence and which was, at the time, unusual and considered curious and controversial, as it was not the contemporary custom among the aristocracy to marry for love. After their wedding, Brita Horn lived with her mother-in-law Eva Ekeblad on the Stola estate in the country side, while Claes Julius Ekeblad continued in his court service for economic reasons. Consequently, they were separated for large parts of the year, during which they corresponded with each other. The couple was themselves aware that their love marriage was considered odd, and remarked about it in their correspondence, where Ekeblad once wrote: \\"My humble vision of happiness is to love and be loved by you. May the masses view it as they wish, I have other standards than the masses\\": he stated that he considered the liberal sexual morals at court decadent, and seven years after their marriage passionately asked her for strands of her hair to make a ring which could remind him of her during their separation, upon which she answered: :\\"My sweet Claes, what do you want with my hair? All people du bon ton will laugh and make fun of you for wearing a ring made of hair from your own wife. Had it been mixed with the hair from some of the fair ladies, it would not be so ridicule, but keep quite about it, otherwise they would never want you in Stockholm any more after having done such a thing. Though I have no more hair than I need, it is so dear to me that you wish to wear it that I cannot deny you even if it would make me bald.\\" Their correspondence is preserved and has been partially published.

The strain and pain of the separation caused by the court service of her spouse is however increasingly evident in the letters, a matter of which she often complained and lamented about in between news of politics, gossip, fashion and affairs of the estate, and as the years progressed, she asked him to refuse further court appointments for her sake.

It was situated on the northern edge of the village of Distington, Cumbria, England where the C&WJR;'s north-south main line crossed the Joint Line's east-west Gilgarran Branch. History The C&WJR; line was one of the fruits of the rapid industrialisation of West Cumberland in the second half of the nineteenth century, specifically being born as a reaction to oligopolistic behaviour by the London and North Western and Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Railways. The Gilgarran Branch was in large part a countermeasure to the C&WJR; \\"interloper.\\" All lines in the area were primarily aimed at mineral traffic, notably iron ore, coal and limestone, none more so than the C&WJR;'s new line to Workington, which earned the local name \\"The Track of the Ironmasters\\". General goods and passenger services were provided, but were very small beer compared with mineral traffic. The Gilgarran Branch never had any pretensions to being a passenger line, though services were sometimes provided on the western section, as shown below. The W&CJR;'s founding Act of Parliament of June 1878 confirmed the company's agreement with the Furness Railway that the latter would operate the line for one third of the receipts. The Gilgarran Branch was mainly operated using LNWR locomotives. Services C&WJR; passenger trains consisted of antiquated Furness stock hauled largely by elderly Furness engines referred to as \\"rolling ruins\\" by one author after a footplate ride in 1949. No Sunday passenger service was ever provided on either line. The initial passenger service in 1879 consisted of *two Up (northbound) trains a day, leaving at 09:20 and 13:45, calling at , , Distington, and terminating at Workington, taking 30 minutes in all. *they returned as Down trains, leaving Workington at 10:30 and 16:00 In 1880 the extension northwards to was opened. The service was extended to run to and from Siddick and an extra train was added, with * three up trains a day, leaving Moor Row at 07:40, 10:12 and 14:45, taking 30 minutes to Workington and an extra four to proceed to Siddick, where connections were made with the MCR. * Down trains left Siddick at 08:45, 12:22 and 17:00 From 1 June 1881 the WC&ER; provided a passenger service from Distington to via , using the western section of the Gilgarran Branch. The fares received were less than ¬£10 per annum, so the service was withdrawn after operating on 8 December 1883. From autumn 1913 the service was given another try; sources disagree about the start date, citing the beginning of either October or November (a working timetable for February 1913 included the service but that may have been premature). The service ran only on Thursdays (one round trip) and Saturdays (two round trips), and was withdrawn after Saturday 29 August 1914 amongst service withdrawals upon the outbreak of war. This service has been explained as being for workers from Distington to expanding collieries and coke ovens around Lowca, but the service pattern gainsays this (perhaps arising from confusion with a service which started in January 1915 between Whitehaven and the halt at Parton, mentioned below). No passenger service ever ran on the eastern section between Distington and Ullock. By 1922 the service reached its high water mark, with: * five up trains a day from Moor Row through to Siddick, leaving Moor Row at 07:20, 09:50, 13:15, 16:50 and 1820. * one train Mondays to Fridays Only from Moor Row to Workington, leaving at 13:45 and also calling at , making that halt qualify as a publicly advertised passenger station * one Saturdays Only train leaving Cleator Moor (NB not from Moor Row) at 12:50 for Workington * one Saturdays Only train leaving Moor Row at 19:35 for Workington There was one fewer Down train, as the 09:50 Up was provided to give a connection at Siddick with a fast MCR train to with connections beyond. Two Saturdays Only trains left at 16:05 and 21:35 for Workington, calling at Distington and High Harrington, with balancing workings leaving Workington at 15:30 and 21:00. There were also trains using the Lowca Light Railway plying between and Workington; they turned off the main line at Harrington Junction, north of Distington, and therefore served no \\"pure\\" C&WJR; stations other than Workington Central. As with advertised passenger trains, in 1920 workmen's trains ran on the company's three southern routes: * between Workington Central and Lowca using the Lowca Light Railway * between (Rowrah's \\"other station\\") and on the single track \\"Baird's Line\\", and * on the \\"main line\\" between Siddick Junction and Moor Row ** from Siddick Junction to Moor Row, calling at all passenger stations except Moresby Parks, calling at instead ** from Moor Row to , calling at Cleator Moor and The situation in 1922 was similar. In January 1898 the company agreed with the Postmaster General to carry a mail bag daily between Workington and Siddick and between Workington and Distington. It is likely that this was conveyed on passenger trains. At some point thereafter the service was extended to Rowrah. The \\"Mail Train\\" beyond Distington to Oatlands and Arlecdon usually consisted of a C&WJR; 0-6-0ST and a guards van. The 1920 Working Time Table shows relatively few Goods trains, with just one a day in each direction booked to call at High Harrington. Mineral traffic was an altogether different matter, dwarfing all other traffic in volume, receipts and profits. The key source summarises it \\"...the 'Track of the Ironmasters' ran like a main traffic artery through an area honeycombed with mines, quarries and ironworks.\\" The associated drama was all the greater because all the company's lines abounded with steep inclines and sharp curves, frequently requiring banking. The saving grace was that south of Workington at least, most gradients favoured loaded trains. During the First World War especially, the company ran \\"Double Trains\\", akin to North American practice, with two mineral trains coupled together and a banking engine behind, i.e. locomotive-wagons-guards van-locomotive-wagons-guards van- banker. Such trains worked regularly between Distington and . The practice was discontinued after dark from 1 April 1918. Most stations on the C&WJR;'s lines had heavy industrial neighbours, such as ironworks next to Cleator Moor West, or served primarily industrial workforces, such as Keekle Colliers' Platform. Distington was also an Iron Town, with an iron works established next to the Gilgarron branch a short distance east of the station in the Summer of 1879 and Whythemoor Colliery a short distance beyond that. Like any business tied to one or few industries, the railway was at the mercy of trade fluctuations and technological change. The Cumberland iron industry led the charge in the nineteenth century, but became less and less competitive as time passed and local ore became worked out and harder to win, taking the fortunes of the railway with it. The peak year was 1909, when 1,644,514 tons of freight were handled. Ominously for the line, that tonnage was down to just over 800,000 by 1922, bringing receipts of ¬£83,349, compared with passenger fares totalling ¬£6,570. Rundown and closure The Gilgarran Branch east of Distington was moribund within ten years of opening, with only one out-and-back working from per day, Monday to Saturday. Distington Ironworks closed in 1922. The western, Parton to Distington, section had just one through train a day, with a second going part way along the line from the Parton end, to a colliery. A workmen's service to at the western end of the branch, which never reached Distington, started on 11 January 1915 and ended in 1929. The high water mark for tonnage along the C&WJR; was 1909, the high water mark for progress was 1913, with the opening of the Harrington and Lowca line for passenger traffic. A chronology of the line's affairs from 1876 to 1992 has almost no entries before 1914 which fail to include \\"opened\\" or \\"commenced\\". After 1918 the position was reversed, when the litany of step-by-step closures and withdrawals was relieved only by a control cabin and a signalbox being erected in 1919 and the Admiralty saving the northern extension in 1937 by establishing an armaments depot at Broughton. Distington station and small engine shed closed on 13 April 1931 when normal passenger traffic ended along the line. Diversions and specials, for example to football matches, made use of the line, but it was not easy to use as a through north-south route because all such trains would have to reverse at Moor Row or . An enthusiasts' special called on 6 September 1954, the only one to do so using main line passenger stock. The next such train to traverse any C&WJR; metals did so in 1966 at the north end of the line, three years after the line through Distington closed. Afterlife By 2013 the village had grown and the ironworks site was a substantial industrial estate. By 2013 aerial images clearly show the lines of route through the station site. The general line of the C&WJR; trackbed through the station site was used by the West Cumbria Cycle Network. The general line of the Gilgarran Branch west of the station site was used by the A595, whereas its general line to Ullock Junction was fragmented; some was clear, some had been reused as minor or service roads and others had been returned to farmland.

It was designed by W G Smith & Sons and built from 1888 to 1950s. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Osler House was designed in 1888, by William George Smith and Sons, for prominent North Queensland businessman and Member of the Queensland Parliament, John Deane. It is believed to have been designed specifically for rental as a doctor's surgery and residence and was ready for occupation in April 1889. The building was constructed as an investment property for John Deane, a prominent northern parliamentarian, businessman and mining magnate, who had owned the land since 1869. The building, as described in the North Queensland Telegraph of 29 April 1889, did not have a projecting gable on the northern side. As such it would have resembled a single bay of a terrace of the kind built in the southern colonies and to a far lesser extent in Brisbane. As the house was built to one side of Deane's block, it is possible that it was originally intended to add adjoining bays. Osler House is the only known example of the domestic work of the important North Queensland architectural firm of W.G. Smith and Sons. William George Smith was born in London and arrived in Brisbane in 1861, initially working as a carpenter and joiner. By 1869 he was a building contractor in Maryborough. In 1875, he became a foreman for the Queensland Department of Public Works and was transferred to Townsville in this capacity in 1879. In 1886, he left the department to join his son, W.G. Smith Junior, who was already in practice as an architect in Townsville. In time they were joined by Smith's other sons; Charles, Frederick and George. The firm had branch offices in Charters Towers, Mackay and Cairns and are best known for the Town Hall and Market Reserve Buildings in Townsville and also designed a number of large hotels. The firm continued in business until 1910. At the time the house was built, its style was considered most unusual in Townsville, representing \\"a departure in residential street architecture\\", according to the local newspaper. When built, it had a surgery and dining room on the ground floor and a drawing room, two bedrooms and a pantry on the upper floor. A separate brick building to the rear contained the kitchen, bathroom and servant's room. That it was intended as a doctor's surgery and residence is indicated by the fact that the largest room, which would normally be used as the drawing room, was located upstairs and a rather smaller room downstairs was designated as the surgery. It was common practice in the 19th century for doctors to set up a surgery in their home, but this was normally an adaptation of an ordinary house. This is the earliest surviving building identified in Queensland which appears to have been purpose designed for a medical practitioner's use. The building was also well ventilated being praised as \\"about the coolest in town\\". Dr Sidney Spark was the first tenant and occupied the house until he moved to the South in 1891. Dr Walter Nisbet, another well-known medical practitioner, was the next tenant until 1899 when he left to join the Australian medical contingent during the Boer War. Nesbit served at one of the largest military hospitals in South Africa for 2 years, rising to the rank of Major. In 1901, the property was leased by the Commercial Travellers Association who established a club in the building. This may have been the period when the two storey verandah extension was added, as in the 1890s a small shop occupied that section of the block, but in a view of the area taken in 1906, the shop has gone and the verandah can clearly be seen. It had arches and a cast iron valance matching the front of the building and may well have also been designed by Smith and Sons. If there had been any intention of constructing a small terrace, it had been abandoned at this point. The club only lasted in the building for a few years and in 1906 the building was again occupied by a medical man, Dr Stuart Burnie. In 1910 it was purchased by Jane McWilliam. The medical association continued as she rented the property to Dr DEA Buchanan, later well known as the Superintendent of the hospital at Rockhampton. In 1918, the property was purchased by Dr Gordon Ross, who had rented it since 1914. Dr Ross was prominent in northern medical circles. He was founder of the Lister Hospital, the forerunner of the present Mater Misericordia Hospital, and had been superintendent of the Townsville General Hospital. Ross sold Osler House in 1928 to yet another well-known northern medical practitioner, Dr H.J. Taylor. It is thought that the building may have been named Osler House in the 1930s in honour of Sir William Osler, a distinguished Canadian physician who developed modern methods of clinical training and was the author of the influential Principles and Practice of Medicine. In 1937, Dr Taylor sold the building and the practice to Dr Leslie Halberstater. Dr Halberstater was well known throughout the north, both in medical and racing circles, and was prominently associated with the development of the Mater Hospital. In 1957, the land was subdivided into 2 blocks and in 1875 a building was constructed on Lot 1 and was sold in 1981. After Dr Halberstater's retirement, the building was rented by other well- known medical practitioners, the last being Dr Michael Rooney who purchased the property in 1983, but sold it soon afterwards. The building fell into disrepair for a few years, but was renovated as offices. Osler House was originally free standing but is now flanked by modern buildings. The verandah to the side has been enclosed and a further timber extension has been made at the first floor level over the driveway. The original cast iron frieze, columns and balustrade were replaced with a full height screen of louvres and the curved profile verandah roof was replaced by a straight profile sheeting, possibly in the Interwar period. This alteration has recently been reversed. Changes have also been made to the interior to accommodate change of use over the years. In 2016, it is occupied by a tax and accountancy business.  Description  Osler House is a two-storeyed house of rendered brick in an Italianate style reminiscent of terraced housing of its period. It has a corrugated iron roof and lantern concealed by a balustraded parapet and has a projecting bay on the northern side. Adjoining this is a verandah to the upper level with cast iron balustrading, It is supported on cast iron pillars with decorative cast iron brackets in-filling the upper corners to create an arched effect. Each level of the house on the front elevation has two entrances with a sash windows between. Both doors and windows have round headed transom lights. There is a balcony to the rear and this has been enclosed, having casement windows to the upper level, although a lattice section remains at the side. A single-storey service wing projects at the rear. This is of brick and has apparently been re- roofed. In the 1950s the building was joined to the next door structure by an enclosed timber bridging section at the upper level, to allow ingress of vehicles to the rear yard. The interior of the building, though now used as offices, retains the original layout of the earliest section and joinery details including doors, windows and elaborate fretwork transoms over ground floor doors.  Heritage listing  Osler House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Osler House, as an early purpose designed surgery and residence for medical practitioners, demonstrates an aspect of the growth of medical services in Queensland. Buildings designed for private medical practice are known in Brisbane at this date, but not in North Queensland and foreshadow the move towards such specialised buildings in the early 20th century. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. It is a rare surviving example of a 19th century combined doctor's residence and surgery which appears to have been specifically designed for this usage. It is also a rare example of a building of this style and material in North Queensland. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Osler House has a long history of usage as the home and workplace of a number of noted North Queensland medical practitioners. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Osler House is the only identified example of the domestic architecture of W G Smith and Sons, an architectural firm that had considerable influence on the architecture of north Queensland.

The Sanskrit text is one of the 20 Sannyasa Upanishads, and is attached to the Krishna Yajurveda. This ancient text on renunciation describes the lifestyle of Hindu monks. A Sannyasi, states the text, should contemplate on soul, lead a simple life without any possession, be chaste and compassionate to all living beings, neither rejoice when someone praises him, nor curse when someone abuses him. History The century in which Kathashruti Upanishad was composed, like most ancient Indian texts, is unclear. Textual references and literary style suggest that this Hindu text is ancient, probably in the centuries around the start of the common era. This text was likely composed before the Asrama Upanishad which itself is dated to the 3rd-century CE. The Kathashruti Upanishad, states Sprockhoff, is quite similar in sections to the more ancient Vedic text Manava-Shrauta Sutra, which means the Upanishad had a prehistory and was likely a compilation of traditions that existed in the earlier centuries of the 1st millennium BCE.Joachim Sprockhoff (1987), Kathasruti und Manavasrautasutra ‚Äì eine Nachlese zur Resignation, Studien zur Indologie und Iranistik, Vol. 13‚Äì14, pages 235‚Äì257 Gavin Flood dates the Sannyasa Upanishads like Kathashruti to the first few centuries of the common era. Its Sanskrit manuscript was translated by Ramanathan in 1978, but this translation has been reviewed as \\"extremely poor and inaccurate\\". Two additional translations were published by Sprockoff in 1990,Joachim Sprockhoff (1990), Vom Umgag mit den Samnyasa Upanishads, Wiener Zeitschrift f√ºr die Kunde S√ºdasiens, Vol. 34, pages 5‚Äì48 (in German) and by Olivelle in 1992. This text has been sometimes titled as Kanthashruti Upanishad in some discovered manuscripts, and in southern Indian manuscript versions as Katharudra Upanishad.Joachim Sprockhoff (1989), Versuch einer deutschen Ubersetzung der Kathasruti und der Katharudra Upanisad, Asiatische Studien, Vol. 43, pages 137‚Äì163 (in German)Yael Bentor (2000), Interiorized Fire Rituals in India and in Tibet, Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 120, No. 4, page 602 with footnote 45 According to Max Muller, Kanthashruti Upanishad has been supposed as a misnomer for Kathasruti. In the Telugu language anthology of 108 Upanishads of the Muktika canon, narrated by Rama to Hanuman, it is listed at number 83.In the Colebrooke's version of 52 Upanishads, popular in north India, it is listed at number 26 The Narayana anthology also includes this Upanishad at number 26 in Bibliothica Indica. Content The text presents the theme of renunciation as well as a description of the life of someone who has chosen the monastic path of life as a sannyasi in Hindu Ashrama culture. The Upanishad opens by stating that the renouncer, after following the prescribed order, and performing prescribed rites becomes a renunciant, should obtain the cheerful approval of his mother, father, wife, other family members and relatives, then distribute his property in any way he wishes, cut off his topknot hair and discard all possessions, before leaving them forever. As he is leaving, the sannyasi thinks of himself, \\"you are the Brahman (ultimate reality), you are the sacrifice, you are the universe\\". The sannyasi should, states the text, contemplate on Atman (soul, self), pursue knowledge, lead a simple life without any possession, be chaste and compassionate to all living beings, neither rejoice when someone praises him, nor curse when someone abuses him. The Hindu monk, according to Kathashruti, states Dhavamony, is not tied to any locality, he is enjoined to silence, meditation and Yoga practice. Renunciation in Hindu texts such as this Upanishad, adds Dhavamony, is more than physical and social renunciation, it includes inner renunciation of \\"anger, desire, deceit, pride, envy, infatuation, falsehood, greed, pleasure, pain and similar states of existence\\". The text is notable for asserting a view that was opposite to that of Jabala Upanishad, on \\"who can appropriately renounce\\". The Kathashruti Upanishad asserts, in verses 31‚Äì38, that the four stages of life be sequential, that a man should first get the student should get educated in Vedas and thereafter he should marry, raise a family in household, settle his children in life, retire, and then renounce after getting the consent of his wife, family and elders at one place. In contrast, the Jabala Upanishad, another ancient Hindu text of the same era, first acknowledges the sequential steps, but thereafter asserts the view that anyone in any stage of life can renounce, whether he is married or unmarried, immediately after education or at a time of his choice, if he feels detached from the world. Jabala Upanishad recommends pre-informing and persuading one's elders, family members and neighbors, but leaves the ultimate choice to the one who wants to renounce and lead a wandering monastic life.

Reviews of Shrill Mist  \\"Shrill Mist is a novel quite different from anything I have ever read, a superb novel, a breakthrough in Nepal fiction. It re-energizes our culture even as it criticizes it. The characters leave an indelible impression on the mind. I was spellbound....\\" Dr. Bishnu Rai \\"Ram Krishna Bantawa's Shrill Mist is a radical novel in which a militant female spirit struggles against the overpowering cultural geography of Nepal, both and magical. This is fiction that is new in every aspect.\\" Dr. Tulasi Bhattarai \\"A marvelous novel! I want to be Mother! Like art that has found a new frequency on which to reach us, there is beautiful rebellion here. But there is also a profound message told against the majestic landscape of Nepal: injustice is a sin!\\" Momila Joshi \\"This is new craftsmanship, a remarkable contribution from a writer of our diaspora. Shrill Mist breaks the chain of our literary tradition, exposing the evil, irrational senseless inhumanity of Nepali consciousness from within an experimentally fractured, existentialist, even romantic story that ends as mysteriously as does all history that has yet to complete its journey.\\" Purna Infada External links * Shrill Mist by Ram Krishna Bantawa. * RTHK Ram Krishna Bantawa.

She is the daughter of writer Zhang Bojun, an intellectual denounced as a \\"rightist\\" during Mao Zedong's Anti-Rightist Movement in the 1950s. She is a graduate of the National Academy of Chinese Theatre Arts. She is the author of a history of early figures in the Republic of China, and of a history of Peking opera stars.  Censorship  In January 2007, Wu Shulin, the deputy director of the General Administration of Press and Publications, had read out a list of books that \\"violated regulations.\\" Her volume was third on the list. Wu told the publishers: \\"We have reminded you repeatedly about this person. Her books are not to be published ... you dared to publish it. This book is banned because of that person.\\" The publishing house, Hunan Literature Publishers, was then punished. This incident prompted Zhang to begin a campaign against China's book censor at the time, Long Xinmin, sending letters and petitions to the government and demanding a change in the way books are censored. In one open letter, titled \\"My Statement and Position,\\" she writes: \\"I know -- in Mister Wu's eyes, Zhang Yihe is a rightist. Alright, so let us say that I am rightist. Then I ask: Is a rightist a citizen? In contemporary China, a rightist cannot speak or write? Everybody knows that as soon as there is a society, there will be leftists, centrists and rightists, of which the leftists will always be a minority. Does our country only allow leftists to speak and publish? Should the broad mass of centrists and rights shut up? If this is true, then we better immediately amend our constitution to state who is allowed to publish and enjoy the basic rights of citizenship; and who is not allowed to publish and cannot enjoy the basic rights of citizenship.\\" Zhang's was one among eight books to be censored. Her previous two books, The Past is Not Like Smoke (also translated as The Past Has Not Gone Up in Smoke) and A Memoir of Ma Lianliang, were also banned for what South China Morning Post called \\"uncomfortable recollections of political campaigns.\\"  Body of Work  Having grown up in a family of intellectuals quintessential to the experience of the early years of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Zhang had first-hand access to the political and culture figures of the 1950s and 1960s. Her memoir-style work of the early 2000s‚Äîwhich differed considerably from the state-sanctioned, cathartic \\"scar literature' of the 1970s and 1980s‚Äîwas groundbreaking is providing an objective expose of the \\"unimaginable cruelty and atrocity of political movements and the actions of the authorities who created the environment for the Red Guards and the Gang of Four to commit their crimes.\\" = The Past is Not Like Smoke = Zhang's works highlight episodes in which family members and friends are forced to betray one another in the name of revolution. In The Past is Not Like Smoke, for instance, Zhang tells the life stories of eight intellectuals and officials who became friends, and explains how they suffered in the Party's political campaigns. Those narrated include key players in the early establishment of the People's Republic, including Shi Liang, the minister of justice and deputy chairman of the standing committee of the National People's Congress; Chu Anping, editor-in-chief of the Guangming Daily; Pan Su and husband Zhang Boju (not to be confused with Zhang Yihe's father Zhang Bojun), a scholar and director of the Beijing Zhongshan Calligraphy and Painting Society; Luo Yufeng, the daughter of the late-Qing reformist intellectual Kang Youwei, Nie Gannu, a renowned writer and member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; and Luo Longji, the minister of forestry and a member of the standing committee of the CPPCC. Her writing \\"stresse[s] the importance of not allowing history to be forgotten, a deeply sensitive issue,\\" according to Richard Spenser of The Telegraph. The banning of her book \\"Past Stories of Peking Opera Stars,\\" inspired her response to the authorities. Zhang has written commentaries on Ai Weiwei and many other issues of contemporary import.

Group platform Through their actions, members of Aam Aadmi Sena have demanded a responsive government, increased financial regulations, and greater accountability of government officials. The members of Aam Aadmi Sena have embraced the use of direct action in their protests. Leadership Within AAS, there are organisational units, such as one for states unit and one called national working committee and youth, trade workers or mahila morcha. Complaints with AAP Aam Aadmi Sena was reportedly formed after AAP members grew dissatisfied with the ruling tactics of Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal. Amongst the complaints made by members of Aam Aadmi Sena against AAP include the charges that AAP tolerated corruption tried to divide Hindus and Muslims. Actions In February 2014, members of Aam Aadmi Sena peacefully protested outside the residence of AAP party official Arvind Kejriwal after he had resigned from the post of Chief Minister of Delhi after 49 days in office. Among the accusations made by members of AAS were that Kejriwal took no action to deal with issues facing Delhi residents. In May 2014, a large group of activists from Aam Aadmi Sena marched through Delhi in a demonstration against the Delhi government, and against Kejriwal in particular, over failure to provide services, including the deployment of marshals on DTC buses. Later in the month, members protested against Kejriwal outside the Delhi High Court during proceedings related to court orders seeking to place Kejriwal into custody. In June 2014, residents of New Delhi continued to deal with rolling brown-outs, also referred to as load-shedding, due to peak demands for electricity and the consequences of damage to the power grid following a storm. Some members of Aam Aadmi Sena threatened to cut the electrical power supply to the residences of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal in order to spur the officials into action to deal with the summer power outrages. In July 2014, members of Aam Aadmi Sena again peacefully protested outside the Kejriwal's residence. In October 2014, activists from the group protested outside the residence of Union Finance minister Arun Jaitley. The activists were pressuring the Finance minister to disclose the holders of black money, which is untaxed income earned in the black market. In April 2015, a member of Aam Aadmi Sena reportedly threw ink on AAP leader Somnath Bharti after a farmer committed suicide during an AAP rally. In January 2016, a woman who identified as a member of Aam Aadmi Sena was reported to have thrown ink on Kejriwal at a press event in Delhi. Aam Aadmi Sena president Pawan Pandit later told the press that the member who threw ink on Kejriwal had video evidence of corruption that the government of the Chief Minister of Delhi took no action to address. Officials with AAP claimed that the attack was made possible by a security breach for which the New Delhi police were responsible. They further claimed that the ink attack was part of a \\"big rehearsal\\" to possibly \\"physically harm\\" Kejriwal in the future. They also accused officials of the rival Bharatiya Janata Party of participating in a conspiracy that resulted in the attack. Officials from the BJP and police rejected the accusations. In February 2016 and in the wake of the sedition controversy at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), individuals vandalised the exterior of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)) headquarters in New Delhi. At least one of the three individuals arrested for the attack claimed to be a member of Aam Aadmi Sena. Prior to the attack, an official speaking on behalf of CPI(M) had called for the release of a JNU student leader facing sedition charges following a pro-Afzal Guru protest at JNU.

Failure of the state to make successful use of the price system to generate sufficient grain sales was met with a regimen of increasingly harsh administrative sanctions against the Soviet peasantry. The state of national emergency which followed led to the termination of the New Economic Policy and spurred a move towards the collectivization of agriculture in 1929. History=Background= The Russian Revolution of November 1917 ushered in a period of civil war and economic dislocation, in which the ruling All- Union Communist Party (bolsheviks) (VKP) made use of forced grain requisitions (Russian: prodrazvyorstka), trading to the peasantry a mix of virtually worthless paper currency and an altogether insufficient quantity of consumer goods in exchange for each household's marketable surplus ‚Äî effectively a seizure.Alec Nove, An Economic History of the USSR. London: Allen Lane/Penguin Press, 1969; pg. 74. Viewed by most Soviet contemporaries as a temporary wartime expedient, this system of \\"War Communism\\" was extremely unpopular with Russia's grain-producing peasantry and the cause of a massive wave of unrest and revolts that threatened to fatally destabilize the government.Nove, An Economic History of the USSR, pg. 83. This force-based system of War Communism was abandoned in the spring of 1921 with the adoption of the so-called \\"New Economic Policy\\" (NEP), under which a stable, gold-based currency was restored and a return made to the market system. Instead of forced requisitions of all marketable surpluses, a food tax (Russian: prodnalog) was implemented which necessitated peasant households providing a limited portion of their production to the state, after which households would be free to sell its remaining surplus not needed for household survival on the open market.Nove, An Economic History of the USSR, pp. 83-84. By 1924 this system of prodnalog had been replaced by a money tax, with Soviet state grain requisitions accomplished via buying and selling.Nove, An Economic History of the USSR, pg. 84. Although the return to the market system in agriculture was ideologically problematic for many Bolsheviks, the years from 1922 to 1926 were successful in practical terms, with total agricultural production by the peasant-based economy fully returning to pre-revolutionary levels.R.W. Davies, The Industrialisation of Soviet Russia: Volume 1: The Socialist Offensive: The Collectivisation of Soviet Agriculture, 1929-1930. London: Macmillan, 1980; pg. 4. Henceforth The Collecitivisation of Soviet Agriculture. Production of cereal grains approximated pre-war figures, potato production greatly exceeded such figures, and livestock populations, gravely impacted during the war, returned to normalcy for pigs and sheep while the count of horses was slowly and steadily restored.Davies, The Collecitivisation of Soviet Agriculture, pg. 4. Note especially Table 1 (pg. 419) and Table 2 (pg. 420). The period of War Communism saw Soviet cities largely depopulated when former peasants returned en masse to their native villages amidst the ongoing economic collapse. This trend was reversed under NEP and industrial facilities were restored and restarted, approaching the pre-war levels of output during the second half of the 1920s.Naum Jasny, Soviet Industrialization, 1928-1952. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1961; pg. 54. Further growth of the economy and improvement of living conditions, it was felt by Soviet planners, would require new investment in factory facilities and capital goods. With access to world capital markets severely restricted to the revolutionary Soviet regime, these funds that would need to be generated by the state either through a loosening of the backing of the gold-based currency, a raising in the level of taxation of the largely rural population, or some combination of these factors. Communist Party penetration of the countryside remained weak, amounting to an average of 1 rural Communist for every 6 village sovietsDaniel Thorniley, The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Rural Communist Party, 1927-39. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1988; pg. 15. ‚Äî a mere 0.52% of the rural population vs. 1.78% of the total population in 1927.E.H. Carr, A History of Soviet Russia: Foundations of a Planned Economy, 1926-1929: Volume 2. London: Macmillan, 1971; pb. 179. Henceforth \\"Foundations of a Planned Economy, Vol. 2.\\" Moreover, these rural Communists, who took leading roles in village soviets and cooperatives, included a disproportionate number of comparatively well-to- do peasants ‚Äî a social group, party and non-party, which dominated local administration.Thorniley, The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Rural Communist Party, 1927-39, pp. 14-15. This persistent strength of so-called \\"kulaks\\" in the Soviet countryside further contributed to the dissatisfaction with the economic status quo on the part of many members of the largely urban Communist Party. From the end of 1926 demand among planners and party activists for a new program of mass industrialization that would modernize the largely peasant country.Thorniley, The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Rural Communist Party, 1927-39, pg. 13. Although NEP was seen at the time as a permanent structure throughout 1927, the 15th Congress of the VKP(b), held in Moscow in December 1927, acceded to this sentiment, approving a new program for the industrialization of the USSR ‚Äî an acceleration which would ultimately prove incompatible with a small peasantry freely exchanging a comparatively small fraction of its production in the marketplace.Jasny, Soviet Industrialization, 1928-1952, pp. 51-52. Collectivization of agriculture was held by the Communists to be the essential corollary of any successful industrial campaign, it being faithfully maintained that collective organization would eliminate the inefficiencies inherent in capitalist agriculture, thereby expanding production and making a greater quantity of grain available to the state for conversion to capital goods. =Goods shortage= Throughout the early years of the Russian revolution the peasantry faced a shortage of basic farm and household items, including agricultural implements, construction material, cloth, and finished consumer goods.James Hughes, Stalin, Siberia and the Crisis of the NEP. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1991; pg. 109. This marked a continuation of the wartime situation, in which industrial production had been moved from a consumer orientation to fulfillment of the military needs of the state in the war against the German empire. The Bolshevik regime had never been able to catch up with pent up demand, and state and cooperative supplies remained spotty, while the prices demanded by private traders remained high. A so-called Scissors Crisis had developed in the early years of the New Economic Policy as prices of consumer goods escalated while market prices of agricultural products fell. Early in 1927 the Communist Party decided to address the disparity by lowering the selling prices of industrial goods by approximately 10%. Although this pricing decision was meant to undercut the high prices charged by private traders, in practice it only exacerbated the miserable supply situation as goods were snapped up from the market, leaving the inventories of state supply agents barren.Hughes, Stalin, Siberia and the Crisis of the NEP, pp. 108-109. Those goods which were available tended to be committed to larger towns, located along railway lines, rather than to smaller villages deep in the countryside. The net result of this situation was a goods famine that provided an inadequate incentive for peasants to participate in grain sales to state grain purchasing agents, who had little of practical value to offer the peasantry in exchange. =Emergence of the crisis= The Soviet economic year (October 1 to September 30) 1925/26 had generated state grain procurement of 8.4 million tons.James Hughes, Stalin, Siberia and the Crisis of the NEP, pg. 102. This was far exceeded in 1926/27, when a post-revolutionary record harvest of 76.8 million tons resulted in a state procurement of 10.6 million tons at stable prices. No upward price adjustment had been necessary owing to the massive size of the harvest, which resulted in a supply glut.Hughes, Stalin, Siberia and the Crisis of the NEP, pg. 103. Expectations for the coming year were raised accordingly, with planned procurement for the coming economic year 1927/28 exceeding quantities obtained during the previous year of record harvest.Hughes, Stalin, Siberia and the Crisis of the NEP, pp. 103-104. In addition to planned establishment of a new state grain reserve of 819,000 tons, economic planners sought increased quantities of grain for export to the European market as a means of generating the foreign currency needed for purchase of capital goods from abroad.Hughes, Stalin, Siberia and the Crisis of the NEP, pg. 104. Calls for an official policy of centrally-planned industrialization had emanated from the Left Opposition headed by Leon Trotsky throughout the middle 1920s, with an explicit criticism levied in a September 1927 program of a \\"frank and open drift to the Right,\\" to accommodation with the most wealthy segment of the peasantry to the detriment of national industrialization and further development of a socialist economy.Carr, Foundations of a Planned Economy, Vol. 2, pg. 56. This demand was easy to ignore when grain was readily available to the state on the market and unused factory capacity remained to be restarted. However, late in 1927 the pervasive optimism associated with the boom period of NEP began to dissipate. A severe slump in state grain collections began in October 1927, following the new harvest of wheat and rye. This trend continued in November and December, with planned total procurements for the quarter of 7 million tons missed by a massive 2.1 million tons. This quantity was not only insufficient for creation of the planned grain reserve and the meeting of export targets, but was viewed by planners as insufficient for the feeding of the nation's cities and the members of the Red Army. Reasons for the decline set off a fierce debate in the ranks of the VKP(b). Party leader Joseph Stalin depicted the shortfall as political in nature, the result of \\"sabotage\\" by the rich peasantry in an effort to force the state to raise grain procurement prices.Hughes, Stalin, Siberia and the Crisis of the NEP, pp. 104-105. This Stalin likened to blackmail ‚Äî forcing the state to abandon its industrialization plans in favor of filling their own pockets with the proceeds of sales to the market.Hughes, Stalin, Siberia and the Crisis of the NEP, pg. 105. Stalin's joint leader of the party during previous years, Nikolai Bukharin, regarded this perspective as a \\"fairy tale,\\" instead arguing that rather than hoarding and speculation the cause of grain supply difficulties was a poor harvest, combined with insufficiently attractive procurement prices that deterred sales to state grain collectors. The crisis in grain collections caused a split of the top leadership of the Communist Party, with a majority of party activists rallying around Stalin, who had now begun vigorously espousing the virtues of rapid industrialization previously associated with Trotsky and the Left Opposition.Carr, Foundations of a Planned Economy, Vol. 2, pg. 57. Only a minority supported Bukharin and his call for continued social peace between the state and the peasantry and his criticism of those who would \\"neglect a sense of moderation, to skip over necessary stages\\" on the slow and measured path to industrial development. Stalin and the rapid industrializers retained effective control over the VKP(b), controlling 6 of 9 seats of the party's Political Bureau, which handled matters of day-to-day governance, with Bukharin able to muster the support of Alexei Rykov and Mikhail Tomsky in favor of a moderate pace of industrialization and social peace.Carr, 'Foundations of a Planned Economy, Vol. 2, pp. 60-61. Behind the scenes Stalin organized diligently, obliquely criticizing moderates in speeches to groups of party activists and with his new right-hand man, Viacheslav Molotov maintaining effective control of the official party daily newspaper, Pravda, and efforts being made to take over editorial control of the party's monthly theoretical magazine, Bolshevik.Carr, 'Foundations of a Planned Economy, Vol. 2, pg. 61.

History=Mansion House Hotel= The hospital was built in the old Mansion House Hotel, an establishment also known as Green‚Äôs Hotel operated by James Green. By 1848, furniture manufacturer James Green had acquired the former Bank of Alexandria building to convert into a hotel. A four-story addition on the building‚Äôs east side was built around 1855. and made it the largest hotel in Alexandria. Green received a notice in early November 1861, stating he had three days to vacate the hotel. =Military hospital= On December 1, 1861, Mansion House Hospital was opened as a General Hospital. Parts of the nearby Bank of Alexandria building at 133 North Fairfax Street were also used as part of the hospital, as were parts of the Carlyle House behind the hotel. The hospital used female nurses, which by the spring of 1862, resulted in harsh treatment and prejudice towards nurses based on their gender. Nurses such as Mary Phinney, however, kept accounts and ‚Äúhelped set the stage for women not just in nursing, but in the medical profession as a whole.‚Äù In March 1862, there was a court case concerning conditions at The Mansion Hospital, concerning the behavior of surgeon J. B. Porter, after allegations of mistreatment of patients were published in the New-York Tribune and Washington National Republican on February 6, 1862. A Court of Assembly met on the issue in February 1862 led by General William H. French, and determined that the complaints were not valid, and that ‚Äúthe Court, from its own observation, cannot speak too highly of the condition of the Mansion Hospital, which is exhibited in the fact, that out of 500 patients, there have been but 32 deaths.‚Äù On September 20, 1862, people began using the hospital as a First Division General Hospital, and it was the largest of the confiscated buildings used as a military hospital in the city, out of 30 total converted hospitals in the city. It could hold up to 700 sick and wounded soldiers. The hospital was the largest Union hospital in the region, with 500 beds. =After the war= Following the surrender of the Confederacy on April 9, 1865, the Mansion House Hospital was returned to the Greens and reopened as a hotel. First again called the Mansion House Hotel, it was then acquired by new proprietors in the early 1880s and renamed Braddock House. By 1886, it was advertised as the only first-class hotel in the city. By the 1970s, the building was vacant and deteriorating. The Northern Virginia Park Authority acquired the entire property, and despite protests from some preservationists, in early 1973 a portion was torn down that decade to restore the nearby John Carlyle House and open area for the Carlyle House Historic Park. A part of the old hospital was, however, partly preserved in what is now an adjacent bank building. Media In 2016 PBS broadcast a miniseries, Mercy Street, set in the hospital. The PBS drama is set in 1862. Some of the characters are based on real historical figures associated with the hospital, for example the Green family and nurse Mary Phinney von Olnhausen.

The text is attached to the Atharva Veda, and is one of the 20 Sannyasa (renunciation) Upanishads. The Naradaparivrajaka text describes the rites of passage associated with renunciation and the life of someone who has chosen the monastic path of life as a sannyasi in Hindu Ashrama tradition. It is significantly longer than many related Sannyasa Upanishads, states Patrick Olivelle, and resembles a \\"medieval legal compendia\\". History The word Parivrajaka means \\"roaming ascetic\\". The title refers to the teachings of the Vedic sage Narada as a roaming sannyasi. The century in which Naradaparivrajaka Upanishad was composed is unclear. This text was likely composed much after the Ashrama Upanishad which is itself dated to the 3rd- century CE. It refers to the Manusmriti and other Dharmasastras, and therefore is chronologically placed to a period after. Sprockhoff dates Naradaparivrajaka Upanishad to be a 12th-century text. The Naradaparivrajaka Upanishad was translated by Ramanathan in 1978, but this translation has been reviewed as \\"extremely poor and inaccurate\\". Another translation was published by Olivelle in 1992. This text has been sometimes titled as Naradaparivrajakopanishad in some discovered manuscripts. In the Telugu language anthology of 108 Upanishads of the Muktika canon, narrated by Rama to Hanuman, it is listed at number 43. Contents The Upanishad, which is presented in nine chapters, opens by describing the tale of NƒÅrada, a Vedic sage revered in numerous texts of the Hindu tradition, who deeply meditates in mythical Naimisha Forest mentioned in the epic Mahabharata. He is approached by other sages, and they ask him, \\"please tell us the way to moksha (liberation)\\". NƒÅrada, asserts the text, tells them that a man should first complete the samskaraas (rites of passage in life), complete studies in Brahmacharya from a Guru (teacher) he reverentially loves for twelve years, then be a householder or Grihastha for twenty five years, be a Vanaprastha or retired forest hermit for another twenty five, then finally renounce if he has no more attachments, is calm, free from enmity against anyone. Upanishad states in chapter 8 that of the four states of ambulating, dreaming, delta sleep and turiya or pure consciousness, the omnipresent is part of the fourth state only. The sannyasi, states the Upanishad, is one who is attached to his soul and nothing else, he seeks and knows the highest truth, he is one with imperishable Brahman (ultimate reality), he is peaceful, tranquil, pure, truthful, content, sincere, kind, compassionate, free from anger, free from love or hate, he is without material possessions. He is rapt in contemplation, to others he may appear dumb or mad. A sannyasi lives a simple life, he never hurts any living being, he remains happy when people assault him just as much as when they honor him. The text asserts the view also found in much older Sannyasa Upanishad, that a sannyasi does not do \\"social rituals, divine worship, propitiatory rites and such practices\\", he is beyond pilgrimages, vows, injunctions and temporal actions, states Olivelle. Verses 193‚Äì194 of the text assert that the renouncer lives in his own self, and therefore transcends all social classes and orders of life, for him no laws or restrictions or prohibitions apply. The Naradaparivrajaka text is notable for describing the rites of passage at time of renunciation in a manner similar to those for the dying and dead, implying that the renouncer was leaving his world and the family, social and material ties that he had, and for his family and friends the rite was akin to they accepting him as deceased. The text is also notable for its description of how anyone in mortal danger may renounce, as well as describing the life of renunciation as the highest Yoga, as that of aloof self-content person who is a meditator of Brahman and Vedanta philosophy.

It has 20 robotic telescopes in both the northern and southern hemispheres. It can survey the entire sky approximately once every day. Initially, there were four ASAS-SN telescopes at Haleakala and another four at Cerro Tololo, a Las Cumbres Observatory site. Twelve more telescopes were deployed in 2017 in Chile, South Africa and Texas, with funds from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the Ohio State University, the Mount Cuba Astronomical Foundation, China, Chile, Denmark, and Germany. All the telescopes (Nikon telephoto f400/2.8 lenses) have a diameter of 14 cm and ProLine PL230 CCD cameras. The pixels in the cameras span 7.8 arc seconds, so follow up observations on other telescopes are usually required to get a more accurate location. The main goal of the project is to look for bright supernovae, and its discoveries have included the most powerful supernova event ever discovered, ASASSN-15lh. However, other transient objects are frequently discovered, including nearby tidal disruption events (TDEs) (e.g., ASASSN-19bt), Galactic novae (e.g., ASASSN-16kt, ASASSN-16ma, and ASASSN-18fv), cataclysmic variables, and stellar flares, including several of the largest flares ever seen. In July 2017 ASAS-SN discovered its first comet, ASASSN1, and in July 2019 it provided crucial data for the near-Earth asteroid 2019 OK. It can detect new objects with magnitudes between 18 and 8.

The micro-distillery is owned by husband and wife, Greg Stark and Karen Robinson-Stark. Stark Spirits is located just blocks from the Pasadena Rose Bowl. It is Pasadena's first micro-distillery, currently its only distillery, and one of two distilleries operating in Los Angeles County. Stark Spirits is a Certified Craft Distillery, certified by the American Distilling Institute. The Pasadena micro-distillery is known for producing hand crafted small batches of these spirits currently: whiskey, rum, gin, brandy. History leftDistillery planning started in late 2011. In 2012 the location was identified near the Craftsman Brewing Co. The area is zoned for \\"light industrial\\" in the City of Pasadena Enterprise Zone. In April 2013 a space became available and leased. Applications where submitted to the TTB and CA ABC. Waiting several months the TTB application started its review, at that moment in time the Congress shutdown the government for six weeks, plus three more weeks to get it going again; TTB approved and issued its license November 21, 2013. The CA ABC approved and issued its license December 21, 2013. Actually doing business was delayed by municipal concerns about the manufacture of alcoholic beverages, and Stark Spirits only sold its first products in December 2014. Stark Spirits facility is less than 1200 square feet, and is essentially a nano-distillery because of the annual production capacity. At full production capacity, including the bottling of barrel-aged rum and whiskey, the distillery can manufacture fewer than 5000 cases annually. The local community had shown advanced interest in the distillery, and three cases of their Sunshine Orange Brandy were purchased in retail venues within days of appearing on shelves. Greg Stark is the head distiller and Karen Robinson is the assistant distiller. Greg started his distilling business after many years of making highly acclaimed home-brewed wine and beer. Stark Spirits has the goal of producing premium single malt whiskey. The diverse product line also includes rum, orange brandy, and gin. Stark Spirits received recognition as a certified craft distillery because it meets the criteria of being owned by the distiller, manufactures and bottles all its products, and produces less than 50,000 cases a year. (ADI link) Stark Spirits is dedicated to the tradition of producing small batches of hand-crafted spirits by traditional methods. Micro-Distillery Industry Small scale craft distilling has been a legitimate enterprise in the United States for about 20 years. (RN) The micro-distilling industry began in California and now has a presence in all 50 states. The craft distilling industry accounts for 1% of the spirit manufacturing industry in the United States. (RN-IBIS) The Federal regulation of spirit-producing businesses does not distinguish between those producing a few thousand cases a year and those producing millions. The industry is regulated by the TTB‚Äîthe Tobacco and Trade Bureau, which has regulations as diverse and minute as the size of type font on the labels of bottles. (RN‚ÄîTTB regs) The Federal government does allow individual state government to set their own regulations in many areas governing the production of spirits, including the implementation of the 3-tier system. The 3-tier system was put in place when Prohibition ended, with the good intention of preventing monopolies of retail venues by manufacturers. (RN‚Äîlegislation info) Manufacturers are required to sell only to distributors, who are independent of manufacturing of spirits, and the distributor then is the only business authorized to sell to retailers. Consumers can buy spirit beverages only from retailers‚Äîunless the state in which they live authorizes direct sales. In 42 states legislation has been passed to allow micro-distilleries in their state to sell directly to customers on the premises or at a legally established tasting room. (RN) California, where Stark Spirits is located, is not one of those states. Generally, a micro-distillery has been characterized as one that produces no more than 100,000 cases of spirits annually. A strong case has been made to further reduce the allowable output for a distillery to be labeled a craft distillery to 50,000 cases or less annually. (RN‚ÄîADI and others) Several organizations have been formed within the craft distilling industry to improve the economic issues that undermine the viability of artisan distilling, and this has added to the fuzziness of the label \\"craft distillery\\". Many spirit products being sold as artisan or craft-produced are made by small companies owned by the mega-spirit manufacturing businesses. (RN) This has had a significant effect on the definition of terms, which has now expanded to include distilleries producing less than 316,000 cases a year. (RN‚Äîcurrent Federal legislation under consideration) Politics continues to make strange bedfellows. Micro-distilleries throughout the United States, regardless of which definition applies to them, are hoping that recently introduced Federal legislation will pass that permits a lower taxation rate on the spirits that they produce. Currently mega and micro and nano distilleries all pay $13.50 per proof gallon. (RN‚ÄîTTB) Proof is the determination of the amount of alcohol by volume contained in a gallon of liquid, doubled. A spirit beverage of 80 proof has 40% alcohol by volume, and therefore is taxed at less than the amount of a full gallon, or 80% of $13.50. 151 proof rum is 75.5% alcohol by volume, and is taxed at 150% of $13.50. The Federal alcohol taxes paid by micro-breweries and micro-wineries are $7/each 31 gallon barrel up to 60,000 barrels annually. If the brewery produces less than 2,000,000 barrels annually, the balance is taxed at $18/barrel; if the brewery manufactures more than 2,000,000 barrels annually, every barrel is taxed at $18/barrel. (RN_TTB regs) This tax break is a significant factor in equalizing the playing field for the micro-breweries and micro-wineries that compete with the mega- producers. Micro-distilleries are hoping that the same consideration will be given them. Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy, and industry organizations such as American Craft Spirits Association and California Artisan Distillers Guild are working for legislative changes that promote the success of the micro-distillery industry.

Originally developed by the Malaysian oil company Petronas in 1997, the engine patents were acquired by Proton in 2012. The engine is currently being reworked in order to meet the upcoming Euro 6C, as the original engine was designed for Euro 2 standard. The E01 engine will become one of the upcoming seven engines being developed by Proton as successors of the CamPro engine family, which are expected to be ready in 2017. Technical specifications The E01 engine is a 2-litre DOHC 16-valve engine featuring gasoline direct injection, aluminum block and continuous variable valve timing system. The engine is capable to produce of power at 7,300 rpm and of torque at 5,300 rpm. The E01 engine can be installed 15 degrees tilting forward or backward of the engine compartment. Besides the initial 2-litre engine, the E01 engine can also be configured to spawn 1.8-litre and 2.2-litre variants. When the E01 engine was developed by Petronas, the engine was designed to meet the Euro 2 emission standard. As a result, Proton is currently reworking the engine, in addition to the development of an all-new family of six engines, to meet the upcoming Euro 6C standard. History A Proton Waja with the E01 engine at Proton's Centre of Excellence. The E01 engine was originally developed by Sauber Petronas Engineering, a 60:40 joint-venture between Petronas and Sauber. It was the first commercial automotive engine in Malaysia. The development of the engine started in March 1997, with the engine start-up ceremony being held on 20 February 1998. The engine was intended to be supplied to Proton; however, Proton had ultimately opted for their self- designed CamPro engines instead to be used in their upcoming models. Only 6 known cars were fitted with the Petronas E01 engine - 2 Series 1 Lotus Elise, a Proton Perdana, a Proton Putra, a Proton Satria GTi and a Proton Waja. After the first failed attempt to sell the engine patents to Proton, Petronas was looking for other carmakers who were willing to buy the engine patents. In 2005, a Chinese carmaker Nanjing Automobile was interested to buy the engine patents. A letter of intent was signed on 2 September 2005. Nanjing Automobile also had set up a plan to mass-produce the E01 engine; however, the plan did not materialize at all. It was not until 2006 that Proton intended to take over the patents of the E01 engine. A memorandum of intention was signed by both parties on 29 January 2006. However, the patent purchase was only finalized in 2012, as Petronas decided to exit from all engine development activities since 2010. The engine patent purchase provided Proton with an immediate ownership of a family of powertrains consisting 2.0-litre and 2.2-litre engines in normally-aspirated and turbocharged variants. Besides, the ownership of the E01 engine patents also enabled Proton to derive the gasoline direct injection technology which would also be applied to their own Proton GDi engine family. With the patents of the E01 engine being acquired from Petronas, the E01 engine becomes one of the two upcoming engine families to succeed the CamPro engine which was in service since 2004 via the Proton Gen-2. Both engine families are expected to be debuted by the end of 2017.

As a metafictional game, the game has the player interact with what appears to be an old arcade cabinet game called \\"Pony Island\\". The player soon discovers the game is corrupted by Lucifer himself, who is trying to claim the player's soul for itself. The player is aided by the soul of a previous player who helps the player access Pony Island internal programming to get around the traps left by Lucifer and save not only their soul, but the many tormented souls that are trapped within the game's code.  Gameplay  Pony Island is presented as a crude arcade game. It is primarily a point-and-click style adventure game, frequently referencing other user- interface metaphors, such as a simulated operating system. The player must explore the internal programming of the \\"Pony Island\\" arcade game in order to progress. At times, the player must play \\"Pony Island\\", a type of endless runner game with shoot 'em up elements, guiding a pony character through a grassy valley, avoiding obstacles and shooting enemies that might attack it. The \\"programming\\" of \\"Pony Island\\", as well as of the operating system, may be accessed by clicking on \\"portals\\" that appear on the screen, presenting the player with simplified pseudocode along with one or more boxes and visual instruction commands, such as \\"move down\\", \\"move left\\" or \\"repeat\\". On these screens, the player will be required to reorder the visual instructions as to modify how the \\"programming\\" will execute. This will either bypass any \\"corruptions\\" in the game's code, or in some cases \\"cheat\\" (for example raising their experience points) the game, in order to progress. The person that you are talking to in the game on messenger (when you hacked your way out of PonyIsland.exe) gave you portals to the core files (When the arcade game screen tilts a little bit, the boss fight and when you found a game in the recycle bin in h0peles$0ul's desktop). In one part of the game, there are 4 people, including you, Guest. Basically, the Devil (or 1U¬©iF#r) is trying to get rid of the person that is making portals of the 3 core files (this person is known as h0peles$0ul) (Also, you will explore in CORRUPTED's desktop later in the game). But this isn't about the 4 people. These are the 4 people: The Devil (\\"1U¬©iF#r\\"), CORRUPTED, h0peles$0ul, and you, Guest.  Development  Prior to working on Pony Island, Daniel Mullins had just graduated from college and attempted to launch a game, Catch Monsters through Kickstarter during November 2014, but failed to raise sufficient funds, and instead found a programming job though still wanted to develop games. Pony Island was primarily developed during the 48-hour Ludum Dare game jam in December 2014, in which the theme was \\"Entire Game On One Screen\\". The game placed high in both the Ludum Dare's Mood and Humor categories, and was featured in Zoe Quinn's top 10 games of 2014. Inspired by the positive reception, Mullins prepared the game on his off time from his job for release through Steam Greenlight, and subsequently published the game in January 2016. Mullins wanted to create a game that defied players' expectations from standard game interfaces, and \\"flipping them upside down\\". Mullins had been intrigued with games that are \\"dark and mysterious\\", but also wanted to create something that felt like it was not meant to be played. Part of this last goal was accomplished by minimizing the amount of instruction that the game provided, particularly once the player began to reveal the internal code workings, but built these systems on familiar interfaces so that the player would have intuition on what to do. For example, in the pseudo-code sections of the game, he found that adding iconography for locks and keys for the commands the players could manipulate helped them to understand how to interact with the code without direct instruction. At the same time, Mullins wrote the language of the pseudocode to make the programming commands seem ominous as to make the player seem like they were \\"toying with a system that [one] may not fully understand\\". Mullins also built in fake error screens and messages through the Steam software that appeared to come from the player's friends, to further the unease that he wanted the players to feel while playing the game. Mullins attributed part of the game's success to popular streamer PewDiePie, who had early on asked Mullins if he could post a Let's Play of Pony Island. Mullins believed this helped him to get the game voted on by players for Steam Greenlight.  Reception  Pony Island has generally been well received by critics, praising it for being a metafiction on the nature of video games. The game holds an aggregated score of 86/100 on Metacritic based on 29 critic reviews. IGN awarded it a score of 9.0 out of 10, saying \\"Pony Island is a punk rock experiment in storytelling and game design that delights in toying with the player.\\" Lizzy Finnegan of The Escapist compared the experience of playing Pony Island as what it might have been like playing Polybius, an urban legend of a cursed video game cabinet, and is \\"psychological horror done so incredibly right\\". On the success of Pony Island, Mullins announced his next game The Hex for a planned early 2017 release, but since was pushed to release on October 16, 2018. The Hex, like Pony Island, is a meta-fictional game where the player takes the role of an innkeeper to solve a murder mystery where the suspects are characters that represent specific video game genres.

It was built outside the city walls, in front to the Gate of Malaventura in the south side of the Walls. In √Åvila, there remains an area known as the Atrium of San Isidro. After the Spanish confiscation, it was moved to Madrid, where it had different locations. Its remains finally found accommodation in the Buen Retiro Park in central Madrid.The ruins are located in Buen Retiro Park, near the confluence of avenida de Men√©ndez Pelayo and calle de O'Donnell. Specifically, they are located in the vicinity of Monta√±a Artificial and Casa del Pescador, two constructions made in early-19th century within the gardens during reign of Ferdinand VII \\"the Felon King\\".  History  Its first patronage was to the C√≥rdoban child martyr, Pelagius, and thus is cited in a document of the year 1250, in which it says that the church was exempt of tax. Moreover, there is a text of consecration carved on a tombstone dated to the year 1270. Historians who have studied this tombstone assume that this might refer to a second consecration of the church, when the dedication of Saint Pelagius was changed to Saint Isidore. After this, there have not come to light more documents that would inform the development and evolution of the small temple until 19th century, thanks to the book of the Cofraternity of San Isidro which was discovered in the sacristy of the church of San Nicol√°s in √Åvila. Also is cited that before the patronage that this hermitage had inside the Saint Isidore's saint's relics before being transferred to Le√≥n in 1062. Also are known through the documents of the Archives of √Åvila, the Academy of Fine Arts and the General Archive of the Administration of Alcal√° de Henares, the circumstances of its transfer to Madrid after the Spanish Confiscation. ; Confiscation and move to Madrid Ashlars that stayed in situ after the remove of the hermitage in √Åvila atrnageIn 19th century the church belonged to the Asociaci√≥n de Labradores (Association of Farm workers); it must be then when changed its patronage to Saint Isidore. Around 1854 the building was badly damaged and the City Council ordered to the Association its demolition. At the same time, the Association offered the temple to the City Council but was not accepted, so they prepared to carry out the required work of demolition. But passed a years without doing anything until in 1876 the State applied the law of Confiscation, demolishing in 1877 to sell the remains of the demolition to individuals. That was how a neighbor of √Åvila bought most of the stones;it may see all that stones that were used to rise a wall for commercial use, in the site where was the church, in the Atrium of San Isidro. Emiliano Rotondo Nicolau -engineer and businessman with interests of archaeologist, resident in Madrid- bought the rest of the ashlars and architectural elements. After a failed attempt of sell to the City Hall of San Sebastian, Rotondo Nicolau could sell the ruins to the Real Academia de la Historia in 1893 for 18.000 pesetas. The new location of the church was in the gardens of the Museo Arqueol√≥gico and its fate would, besides of show it as relic of the Romanesque, use as a chapel where is to give Mass with the Mozarabic Rite every Sunday. Environment of the hermitage; view of the Monta√±a artificial from the ruins But all just was a project until C√°novas del Castillo in 1897 it interested in the monument and the museum it ceded to City Hall of Madrid ordering its transfer to the Buen Retiro Park under the supervision and project of the architect Ricardo Vel√°zquez Bosco.Friends of Romanesque. Retrieved April 7, 2014 The location, next to the intersection of O 'Donnell with Men√©ndez Pelayo, very close to the Monta√±a Artificial, is pleasant, surrounded by greenery and centenary trees and could have been a ruins to the romantic taste, but the building suffered another forgotten and abandoned. Finally at the beginning of 21st century City Council of Madrid sent to tidy the place recovering stones, capitals, shafts, cornices, etc. that were scattered in the environment. Building description Drawing of Francisco Aznar within the work Architectural Monuments of Spain ', 1856-1882 The hermitage was made in rectangular ashlars of limestone. It was a temple of unique nave with wood cover. The head was semicircular with semi-dome, and straight section with barrel vault in turn divided into two parts. Both the architectural structure of the head as the decorative motifs that can be seen in the drawings of Van den Wyngaerde, Repull√©s and Francisco Aznar link this building with San Vicente, San Pedro and San Andr√©s of √Åvila, so the date of construction can approach that of those temples, the mid-12th century. In the unique nave it opened two doors, one to south and one to the west (puerta de los pies); still the remains of one of the two in which it can see the three midpoint archivolts that support in the abacuses united to impost. Although almost not noted, this impost is carved with roses of four petals inscribed in circles. The same rosettes formed the decoration carved of the archivolts; yet it can guess its trace. The capitals had a zoomorphic and vegetal decoration. Despite the deterioration it can still see the acanthus leaves. In the apse it opened three semicircular windows with archivolt and chambrana. Remain two as witness and in its it can distinguish the deep flare ending in narrow arrowslit. The archivolts rest on abacuses and capitals that were decorated with leaves and birds with the beak between the legs, like those that can be seen in the Iglesia de San Andr√©s of √Åvila. According to the preserved drawings, in the straight section had blind arches of a single arch whose capitals were decorated with plant motifs, lions and birds. The study of this decoration has suggested in the workshops that carved San Pedro and San Vicente and the covers of San Andr√©s.
