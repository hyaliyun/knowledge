Biography He was born to James Thaddeus Rutherford and the former Allee Lillian Johnson in Hot Springs, Arkansas.\\"J. T. Rutherford,\\" Who's Who in America, Vol 31 (1960-1961), (Chicago: Marquis Who's Who, 1960), p. 2504 In 1934, his family relocated to Odessa, Texas, where he attended public schools. He served as an enlisted man in the United States Marine Corps from 1942 to 1946, of which twenty-eight months were spent overseas. He was awarded the Purple Heart. As an assault amphibian vehicle crewman, he landed in the first waves on D-Day at Tarawa, Saipan, where he was wounded, and Tinian. He retired as a major in the United States Marine Corps Reserve. From 1946 to 1947, Rutherford studied at San Angelo College in San Angelo. He then transferred to Sul Ross State College in Alpine, which he attended from 1947 to 1948. From 1948 to 1950, he attended Baylor Law School in Waco, Texas. In 1948, Rutherford married the former Sara Jane Armstrong, and the couple had three children, Cleo Ann, Charles Lane Rutherford, and Jane Ellen. Rutherford was a partner in an industrial electrical construction firm and also owned an advertising business. Rutherford served in the Texas House of Representatives from 1948 to 1952 and the Texas State Senate from 1953 to 1954. He was elected to the 84th to 87th United States Congresses from January 3, 1955, to January 3, 1963. An unsuccessful candidate for re-election in 1962 to the 88th United States Congress, Rutherford was unseated by Republican Ed Foreman of Odessa, later of Dallas. His loss to Foreman was attributed to the Billie Sol Estes scandal. He missed only one floor vote of the several thousand cast while he was a representative. He was one of the majority of the Texan delegation to decline to sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto opposing the desegregation of public schools ordered by the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education. Rutherford voted against the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960, but voted in favor of the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. He was the first chairman of the House Subcommittee on National Parks. He was awarded the U.S. Department of Interior's Conservation Service Award in 1962 for his efforts to spearhead conservation legislation including laws that created a new national seashore on Padre Island, Cape Cod National Seashore, and Point Reyes in California. Rutherford's district was the old jumbo 16th district, Midland being its eastmost point and El Paso at its westmost. It also stretched hundreds of miles along the border with Mexico. The 19 counties it embraced covered 42,067 square miles‚Äîmaking it geographically larger than Ohio or Tennessee, among others. After leaving Congress, he formed J. T. Rutherford and Associates, a government relations consulting firm. He was a director of the Gonzales Warm Springs Foundation for Crippled Children, which was established in 1943 in Gonzales County, Texas. He was also a Shriner, another group which promotes the welfare of crippled children. Rutherford died of complications of Alzheimer's disease in Arlington, Virginia, where he spent his later years.

Following BMW's break-up of the Rover Group a financially complex deal involving a ¬£500 million \\"dowry payment\\" from BMW, resulted in PVH purchasing the Rover marque in May 2000 for the notional sum of ¬£10, relaunching the car company as MG Rover. MG Rover and related companies placed themselves in administration on 8 April 2005. Four years later and after spending ¬£16m the Government finally released the report investigating the collapse of the company. The report, which was only concerned with dealing with the directors and their actions while MG-Rover Group was still trading, revealed that the five executives involved took ¬£42m in pay and pensions from the troubled firm before it collapsed. The report also commented on the personal relationship between Nick Stephenson and Dr Qu Li, who was paid more than ¬£1.6m in the 15-month period up to April 2005 for consultancy services. Additionally, fellow Director Peter Beale was accused of installing a software application, Evidence Eliminator, which may have destroyed documentation relevant to the investigation. The investigators further accused Mr Beale of giving \\"untruthful\\" evidence during interviews. In return the Directors have accused the findings of being a whitewash and a witch-hunt, and it remains unknown the exact details of the actions of key Government Ministers at the time of the collapse. Conservative business spokesman Kenneth Clarke said it was right the report criticised the Phoenix Four, whose behaviour was \\"disgraceful\\". Lord Mandelson said the Phoenix group had not shown an \\"ounce of humility\\" about the firm's demise and they owed an apology to the firm's employees and creditors. However his comments that steps will be taken to disbar the five executives have been discredited, and the report at no point uses language stronger than 'inappropriate' in describing the activities of the Group Directors.

In January 2000, it was reported that UK sales had fallen from more than 190,000 in 1998 to 143,000 in 1999 - a fall of more than 25% in sales for the company, despite overall new car sales increasing by 7%. Even Rover's newest model, the Rover 75 (launched in the spring of 1999), had failed to meet sales expectations. Since September 1999 the venture capital company Alchemy Partners, run by Jon Moulton and Eric Walters, had been in talks with BMW about acquiring Rover. When news of the talks became public on 16 March 2000, Alchemy was widely expected to take control of at least some of the Rover Group, which BMW was prepared to sell. By that time, it was already decided that BMW would retain Mini (with the launch of an all-new Mini only a year away) and sell Land Rover to Ford. These were widely seen as the two most viable parts of the Rover Group. Alchemy intended to name the company the MG Car Company, producing the MG F roadster and possibly developing additional, limited production sports cars. The Rover brand would have been dropped and all volume production of family cars abandoned, despite these cars making up the bulk of Rover sales - with more than 100,000 being sold in Britain alone during 1999. A large percentage of the workforce at Longbridge would also have been made redundant. Jon Moulton withdrew the Alchemy bid when the Government added extra conditions to the sale, and a march through Birmingham led by Prof Carl Chinn opposed the Alchemy bid. On 6 April 2000, John Towers ‚Äî the most prominent of the four men known as the Phoenix consortium ‚Äî presented a counter-offer to BMW. The Transport and General Workers Union (T&G;), the UK Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), and the British public in general all threw their support behind Towers and the Phoenix Consortium, as Phoenix were the only potential bidders proposing to retain high-volume car production and full employment at the Rover plant in Longbridge, Birmingham. On 8 May, following a last-minute injection of finance from the First Union Bank of North Carolina, a deal with Phoenix was agreed. The sale was completed the next day. Due to UK regulations that hold the prior owner of a company responsible for all redundancy payments if the said company declares bankruptcy within 3 years of sale, BMW guaranteed that Phoenix Venture Holdings (initially named MG Rover Holdings) would have enough money to keep Rover Group in business for at least 3 years following the sale. The agreed \\"dowry\\" from BMW was made up of a ¬£427million interest-free loan and stocks of cars. Kevin Howe was appointed MG Rover's managing director in July 2000. Phoenix's short-term plan was to expand the MG range with sporting versions of existing Rovers, introduce new versions of the Rover 25, 45 and 75 models, reengineer and redesign the MG F, and eventually replace the entire model range with new cars developed through joint venture with another carmaker. The MG-badged versions of the Rover models were launched in the summer of 2001, and were reasonably popular. A 1.1 litre engine had already been added to the Rover 25 range, to give it a competitor at every level with most rival superminis. The MG F was updated shortly afterwards to become the MG TF, and a number of concept cars were shown to the public, hinting at all-new models which MG Rover was hoping to launch in the near future. The consortium continued to enjoy strong UK press support for several years following the Phoenix coup, despite no all-new models being launched by the company. By 2003, MG Rover was the ninth best selling carmaker in Britain, whereas the Rover Group (which had still included Land Rover and Mini) had been the third biggest seller just five years earlier. It still had a 3.72% share of the new car market, accounting for more than 95,000 sales. By the beginning of 2005, however, sales figures of MG Rover cars were declining sharply, not helped by the fact that most rival companies had launched all-new competitors in the previous five years. During 2004, the media had regularly reported that the company's sales were in decline. The Rover 25 and 45, for instance, were updated versions of designs which had first been launched in 1995, and all of their major rivals had been replaced once - and in some cases twice - since then.

History Whitemoor Prison was built on the site of an old railway marshalling yard and was opened in 1991 by Norma Major. In September 1994 while under the governorship of Brodie Clark, six prisoners including London gangster Andy Russell, Paul Magee and other IRA members, escaped from the prison's Special Secure Unit after smuggling a gun into the prison. All were later recaptured. In April 2005, it was alleged that a wind turbine situated near Whitemoor Prison was being switched off in the early mornings because the flickering shadows it created annoyed inmates. The turbine had been halted because of possible security problems if prisoners became upset over the flickering shadows. In August 2005, the prison was locked down for two days following an explosion in a wing. A full search was carried out after the firework-like blast, however it caused no damage to the prison. In June 2006, an inspection report from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons criticised staff at Whitemoor Prison for ignoring prisoners, and not responding to their queries and requests for help promptly enough. The report also criticised the prison's healthcare provision and pharmacy, as well stating that black and Asian prisoners felt subtle discrimination against them. However, the report did praise Whitemoor's specialist units ‚Äì such as the dangerous and severe personality disorders wing ‚Äì which were said to be performing well. A further inspection report stated, in October 2008, that staff at Whitemoor Prison felt fear that Muslim inmates were attempting to radicalise others held at the jail. According to inspectors, officers tended to treat Muslim prisoners as extremists and potential security risks, even though only eight of them had been convicted of terrorist offences. Due to the concerns raised by this inspection, further visits by researchers from the Cambridge Institute of Criminology, commissioned by the Ministry of Justice, were arranged between 2009 and 2010 to interview staff and inmates. In November 2011, the Cambridge Institute of Criminology published their researchers' findings. A number of prisoners had told researchers that they had converted to Islam for protection or because they were bullied into it: reasons given for conversion included \\"seeking care and protection\\", \\"gang membership\\" and \\"coercion\\" as well as \\"rebellion\\" as Islam was seen as the \\"underdog\\". Non-believers avoided confrontation with any Muslim in case it led to retribution from the wider group, and would avoid cooking pork in communal kitchens or undressing in the showers in case it caused offence. A number of non-Muslims and prison officers claimed that converts did so to join an \\"organised gang\\" and a \\"protection racket\\" which \\"glorified terrorist behaviour and exploited the fear related to it\\". Non- Muslims would be visited by inmates with Islamic literature, who would tell them to \\"read this\\" and promise they would be safe from physical assault if they changed faith. In its conclusion, the report noted: \\"The new population mix, including younger, more black and minority ethnic and mixed race, and high numbers of Muslim prisoners, was disrupting established hierarchies in the prison. Social relations among prisoners had become complex and less visible. Too much power flowed among some groups of prisoners, with some real risks of serious violence. There were high levels of fear in the prison. In particular, there were tensions and fears relating to 'extremism' and 'radicalisation'.\\" A report by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons on Whitemoor, following an inspection in January 2014, stated that the prison housed 454 adult men, of which approximately 40% were Muslim. The report identified \\"some Muslim prisoners convicted of terrorist offences who were an adverse influence on others\\".Bullying fears at Cambridgeshire high security prison raised BBC News 22 May 2014, accessed 22 May 2014  2020 Terror attack  At approximately 9.10am, on 9 January, two prisoners wearing fake suicide belts approached and attacked a prison officer. The prison officer received injuries to his head and neck and the attackers used improvised bladed weapons during the assault. Three prison officers and a nurse also suffered injuries as they rushed to the aid of their stabbed colleague. One of the attackers was understood to be Brusthom Ziamani, 24, who was found guilty of preparing an act of terrorism in 2015. Ziamani was assisted by another prisoner, a Muslim convert who was serving time for a violent offence. The Met Police said it was \\"deemed appropriate\\" its counter-terrorism command unit was sent to HMP Whitemoor \\"due to certain circumstances relating to this incident\\". The prison today Whitemoor houses around 500 of the most dangerous prisoners in the UK. The prison has a Dangerous Severe Personality Disorder (DSPD) unit and a Close Supervision Centre (CSC). The centre is a prison inside the prison. Whitemoor does not accept any prisoners who are serving less than 4 years. The regime includes vocational training courses in the construction industry and furniture craft, and production workshops involve recycling work and a laundry. The prison offers full-time, half-time and part-time education courses including basic skills, GCSEs, Level 3 Access to Higher Education, and Open University courses. The Healthcare Centre includes a nine bed in- patients' facility. The centre employs a full-time doctor and provides twenty- four-hour nursing services. Out of hours medical cover is provided by an on- call service. Other facilities include a gymnasium and prison shop.

Career In 1972, the state of Texas began electing members of the state House of Representatives and State Senate, for the first time, by single-member districts. Washington, along with four other minority candidates, Anthony Hall, George T. \\"Mickey\\" Leland, Benny Reyes and Cecil Bush, (dubbed the \\"People's Five\\"), ran for seats in the Texas House of Representatives. Washington was elected, and represented District 86 in the state House from 1973 to 1982. He then represented District 13 in the state senate from 1983 until 1989. Washington was elected as a Democrat to the 101st United States Congress for Texas's 18th congressional district, by special election, December 9, 1989, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Mickey Leland. He was reelected to the 102nd United States Congress and 103rd United States Congress and served from December 9, 1989, to January 3, 1995. He took stands against some projects, like the International Space Station, where spending would have flowed to his district. In March, 1994, Washington was routed in the Democratic primary by Houston City Councilwoman Sheila Jackson Lee, winning only 36.5 percent of the vote. Lee won in November and still holds the seat today. Since leaving Congress, Washington has practiced law in Houston and Bastrop, Texas.

He won five times, in 1977, 1979, 1981, 1982, and 1991, and is the only person to win in three separate decades. He won his first Iditarod race at the age of 27. Swenson competed in the Iditarod for the first time in 1976, placing 12th. The next year, he beat Jerry Riley by just 4 minutes and 52 seconds, and became known for close finishes. Swenson has won by less than an hour four times, and by less than five minutes twice. Between 1976 and 2012, he has entered the race 36 times and has completed 34 Iditarods, more than any other musher, finished in the top ten 24 times and has won $612,576 in prizes, third among all entrants. He was awarded Sportsmanship awards in 1983 and 1996, and the Leonhard Seppala Humanitarian award for dog care twice, in 1992 and 2004.

The Labour Government led the Scotland Act 1978 through Westminster which provided for the establishment of the Scottish Assembly. Although the majority of those who voted at the referendum on 1 March 1979 voted in favour of the Act, the provisions were not put in place due to the additional requirement that 40% of the total electorate also vote in favour. The Scottish National Party subsequently refused to support the government in a later vote of no confidence. Home rule for Scotland would not become a reality until 1999 following the Scotland Act 1998 establishing the Scottish Parliament. History A devolved Scottish Assembly that would have some form of legislative powers in jurisdiction over Scotland was a long-held political priority for many individuals and organisations. The drive for home rule first took concrete shape in the nineteenth century, as demands for it in Ireland were met with similar (although not as widespread) demands in Scotland. 19th Century In 1853 the National Association for the Vindication of Scottish Rights was established. This body was close to the Conservatives and was motivated by a desire to secure more focus on Scottish problems in response to what they felt was undue attention being focused on Ireland by the then Liberal government. This body was concerned with increasing the attention that Scotland was receiving and did not advocate legislative devolution in the form of an assembly as such, but nevertheless, it marked the beginning of a political focus on Scotland. Shortly after this, the Liberals began to commit to home rule. In 1871, William Ewart Gladstone stated at a meeting held in Aberdeen that if Ireland was to be granted home rule, then the same should apply to Scotland. In 1885 the post of Secretary for Scotland was re- established as the demands for greater political focus on Scotland grew. In the following year Gladstone introduced a home rule bill for Ireland helping to prompt the formation of the Scottish Home Rule Association, a nominally non-partisan political organisation, but actually closely tied with the Liberals, which aimed for the establishment of an assembly. Early 20th Century From 1895 to 1905 the Conservatives and their Liberal Unionist allies were in power (the two combined usually referred to by the single moniker \\"Unionist\\"), and home rule did not feature as part of their plans. However, the return of a Liberal government in 1905 gave great hope to those seeking an assembly, as the Liberals were officially committed to the idea. But it did not feature as an immediate priority of government, and by the time a Scottish home rule bill was presented to the Westminster Parliament in 1913, and passed second reading but did not proceed further due to the First World War. After the war a second Scottish Home Rule Association was formed (the first had fallen into inactivity). This was driven not only by Liberals but also by those involved in the growing Labour Party and the Independent Labour Party in particular. The Labour Party, formed in 1900, was formally committed to establishing an assembly for Scotland and this seemed to increase prospects for home rule. The demands for political change in the way in which Scotland was run changed dramatically in the 1920s when Scottish nationalists started to form various organisations. The Scots National League was formed in 1920 in favour of Scottish independence, and this movement was superseded in 1928 by the formation of the National Party of Scotland, which became the Scottish National Party (SNP) in 1934. At first the SNP sought only the establishment of a devolved Scottish assembly, but in 1942 they changed this to support all- out independence. This caused the resignation of John MacCormick from the SNP and he formed the Scottish Covenant Association. This body proved to be the biggest mover in favour of the formation of a Scottish assembly, collecting over two million signatures in the late 1940s and early 1950s and attracting support from across the political spectrum. However, without formal links to any of the political parties it withered, and devolution and the establishment of an assembly were put on the political back burner. However, by the 1960s the SNP's support was growing, as shown by their victory in the 1967 Hamilton by-election. The pro Union parties responded by committing themselves to supporting devolution. The Labour government formed the Kilbrandon Commission to draw up devolution plans, and Edward Heath committed the Conservatives to supporting some form of devolution at the 1968 Scottish Conservative Conference in Perth (commonly known as his Declaration of Perth). 1970s New Parliament House, the proposed site of the Scottish Assembly However the SNP had a disappointing result in the 1970 general election, and for the first part of the 1970s devolution under Heath's government was off the cards. But significant SNP advances in the general elections in 1974 brought the issue to the fore again. In 1978 the Labour government passed the Scotland Act which legislated for the establishment of a Scottish Assembly, provided the Scots voted for such in a referendum. However, the Labour Party was bitterly divided on the subject of devolution. Despite officially favouring it, vast numbers of members opposed the establishment of an assembly, and this division caused the failure to reach the required 40% of the electorate voting in favour of an assembly (that itself was a quota only added to the Scotland Act by an amendment proposed by a Labour MP). The ensuing general election in 1979 proved electorally disastrous for both Labour and the SNP, and it seemed that the prospects for a Scottish Assembly were remote. However, in the early 1980s a number of Labour Party and SNP members decided to form the Campaign for a Scottish Assembly, which pamphleteered and lobbied for devolution. This campaign, combined with growing resentment at the fact that despite a majority of Scots voting against the Conservatives they were forming their government, increased demands for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly. Scottish Assembly proposed in the Scotland Act 1978=Structure Had the Scotland Act 1978 entered force, it would have created a Scottish Assembly with limited legislative powers. There would have been a Scottish Executive headed by a \\"First Secretary\\", taking over some of the functions of the Secretary of State for Scotland. Meetings of the Scottish Assembly would have been held at the Old Royal High School in Regent Road, Edinburgh. The former school hall was adapted for use by the Scottish Assembly, including the installation of microphones and new olive green leather seating. Members would have been elected by the first past the post system. Powers and legislation The Scottish Assembly would have had the power to introduce primary legislation (to be known as Acts of the Scottish Assembly) within defined areas of competence. This form of legislation would not receive royal assent like Acts of Parliament do. Instead, the legislation is signed via an Order in Council, which the monarch signs and appends to the Act of Assembly once passed. The areas of responsibility included: *Education *The environment *Health *Home affairs *Legal matters *Social services Responsibility for agriculture, fisheries and food would be divided between the Assembly and the United Kingdom government, while the latter would retain control of electricity supply. Two possible contenders for the post of First Secretary were the Reverend Geoff Shaw, leader of Strathclyde Regional Council, and Professor John P Mackintosh MP ‚Äì but both died in 1978. Scottish Constitutional Convention In 1989 the Scottish Constitutional Convention was formed encompassing the Labour Party and the Lib-Dems as well as other parties, local authorities, and huge sections of civic Scotland. Its purpose was to devise a scheme for the formation of a devolution settlement for Scotland. Suddenly the prospects for a Scottish Assembly seemed much brighter, despite the fact the SNP decided not to take part as they felt that independence would not be a constitutional option countenanced by the convention. The convention produced its final report in 1995 and, with the return of a Labour government in 1997, devolution seemed assured. Later that year the Scottish people voted overwhelmingly in favour of establishing the devolved Scottish Parliament in a referendum, and the first elections for that body took place in 1999.

The aircraft took its service name from the town (latterly, city) and port of Sunderland in North East England. Developed in parallel with the civilian S.23 Empire flying boat, the flagship of Imperial Airways, the Sunderland was developed specifically to conform to the requirements of British Air Ministry Specification R.2/33 for a long-range patrol/reconnaissance flying boat to serve with the Royal Air Force (RAF). As designed, it served as a successor to the earlier Short Sarafand flying boat. Sharing several similarities with the S.23, it featured a more advanced aerodynamic hull and was outfitted with various offensive and defensive armaments, including machine gun turrets, bombs, aerial mines, and depth charges. The Sunderland was powered by four Bristol Pegasus XVIII radial engines and was outfitted with various detection equipment to aid combat operations, including the Leigh searchlight, the ASV Mark II and ASV Mark III radar units, and an astrodome. The Sunderland was one of the most powerful and widely used flying boats throughout the Second World War.Eden 2004, p. 442. In addition to the RAF, the type was operated by other Allied military air wings, including the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), South African Air Force (SAAF), Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF), French Navy, Norwegian Air Force, and the Portuguese Navy. During the conflict, the type was heavily involved in Allied efforts to counter the threat posed by German U-boats in the Battle of the Atlantic.Norris 1967, pp. 11‚Äì12. On 17 July 1940, a RAAF Sunderland (of No. 10 Squadron) performed the type's first unassisted U-boat kill. Sunderlands also played a major role in the Mediterranean theatre, performing maritime reconnaissance flights and logistical support missions. During the evacuation of Crete, shortly after the German invasion of the island, several aircraft were used to transport troops. Numerous unarmed Sunderlands were also flown by civil operator British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), traversing routes as far afield as the Pacific Ocean.Norris 1967, p. 14. During the post-war era, use of the Sunderland throughout Europe rapidly declined, while greater numbers remained in service in the Far East, where large developed runways were less prevalent. Between mid-1950 and September 1954, several squadrons of RAF Sunderlands saw combat action during the Korean War. Around a dozen aircraft had also participated in the Berlin airlift, delivering supplies to the blockaded German city. The RAF continued to use the Sunderland in a military capacity up to 1959. In December 1960, the French Navy retired their aircraft, which were the last remaining examples in military use within the Northern Hemisphere.Norris 1967, pp. 14, 16. The type also remained in service with the RNZAF up to 1967, when they were replaced by the land-based Lockheed P-3 Orion. A number of Sunderlands were converted for use within the civil sector, where they were known as the Hythe and the Sandringham; in this configuration, the type continued in airline operation until 1974. Several examples were preserved, including a single airworthy Sunderland which has been placed on display in Florida at Fantasy of Flight. Development=Origins During the early 1930s, there was intense international competition to develop suitable aircraft to operate new long-range intercontinental passenger service between the United Kingdom, the United States, France and Germany. It was recognised that the United Kingdom had no existing equivalent to the new American Sikorsky S-42 flying boats or the German Dornier Do X. Accordingly, in 1934, the British Postmaster General declared that all first-class Royal Mail sent overseas was to travel by air, establishing a subsidy for the development of intercontinental air transport in a fashion similar to the U.S. domestic programme a decade earlier. In response, Imperial Airways announced a competition to design and manufacture a fleet of 28 large flying boats, each weighing and having a range of with a capacity for 24 passengers. A corresponding contract was issued to Short Brothers of Rochester for their design, which became the S.23 Empire. While the Empire flying boat has often been credited as a predecessor of the Sunderland, according to aviation author Geoffrey Norris, this impression \\"is not strictly true\\".Norris 1967, p. 3. During November 1933, the British Air Ministry released Specification R.2/33, which called for the development of a next-generation long-range general purpose flying boat, intended to perform ocean reconnaissance missions. The specification envisioned an aircraft, either a monoplane or biplane, which would have to have performance equal to the recently delivered Short Sarafand flying boat, along with various other requirements, including the need to be powered by a maximum of four engines and to be much more compact than the Sarafand. The release of Specification R.2/33 had been in advance of the publication of the commercial Imperial Airways requirement; by the time that Short received Imperial Airway's priority request, the company had already started planning the design of the prospective military flying boat. After reviewing both sets of requirements, Short decided to prioritise the development of the civil S.23 design but also to work on a response to specification R.2/33. Chief Designer Arthur Gouge had originally intended for a COW 37 mm gun to be mounted in the bow of the craft to accompany the single Lewis gun installed in its tail. As with the S.23, he made efforts to produce a fuselage that generated the lowest amount of drag possible, while a much longer nose than had been used for the S.23 was ultimately adopted. Selection During October 1934, Shorts settled upon the general configuration and geometery of the design, opting for a monoplane configuration that bore a resemblance to the earlier Short Scion Senior flying boat. The military flying boat design soon received the internal designation of S.25. While the S.25 design bore a strong resemblance to the civil S.23, it featured an improved shape to reduce aerodynamic drag and greater use of external protrusions. During late 1934, the S.25 proposal was submitted by the company to the Air Ministry. Rival firm Saunders-Roe had also designed and submitted their own flying boat, known as the Saro A.33, as their response to the issuing of Specification R.2/33. Following an initial evaluation of the submissions, the Ministry decided to place orders for the production of prototypes for both the S.25 and A.33 proposals; this measure was originally made for the purpose of performing flight tests in support of a detailed evaluation, after which production order would be awarded to one of the competitors. During April 1936, the Air Ministry was sufficiently confident in Short's submission that a development contract for an initial batch of 11 further S.25 boats was issued to the company. On 4 July 1936, the first of the Empire flying boats to be built, G-ADHL, named 'Canopus', conducted its first flight; according to Norris, this occurrence served as a highly visible affirmation of the basic principles of the S.25's design and that, coincidentally, the crucial final design conference was held around the same time as the ground-breaking flight. The competitive fly-off was abandoned before such an effort could take place as a result of the sole A.33 having being lost in an accident, resulting in the S.25 being the only remaining entry thereafter. As construction of the prototype S.25 proceeded, several design changes were performed for various reasons. In terms of its armament, in response to feedback from Air Ministry and Royal Air Force (RAF) experts reviewing the project, it was decided to change its intended defensive weapons, resulting in the switch to a single 0.303 Vickers K machine gun for the nose turret while an arrangement of four 0.303 Browning machine guns in the tail position was also adopted at the same time.Norris 1967, pp. 3‚Äì5. The tail turret was also changed to a powered version; Gouge therefore had to devise a solution to account for the resulting movement aft of the aircraft's centre of gravity, which was in part achieved via the presence of ballast positioned in the forward area. and by pivoting the wings back by 4.25 degrees.url=http://homepage.eircom.net/~wrgi/sunderlandker.html accessdate=May 2018 By the end of September 1937, the prototype had been completed.Norris 1967, p. 5. Flight testing On 16 October 1937, the initial S.25 prototype (K4774) performed the type's maiden flight, fitted with Bristol Pegasus X radial engines capable of generating of thrust each. The more powerful Pegasus XXII model was unavailable at the time. Flown by Short's chief test pilot John Lankester Parker and Harold Piper, the initial flight lasted for around 45 minutes; later that day, a second flight of a similar duration was performed. Parker later declared his satisfaction with the basic design. Prior to the first flight, the type had received the name Sunderland. Following early flight trials with the first prototype, the aircraft was returned to the workshop where it underwent further modifications; the adoption of a wing sweepback of 4¬∞ 15' was achieved via the addition of a spacer into the front spar attachments. This design change, which had been made to account for the changes in defensive armament, repositioned the flying boat's centre of lift enough to compensate for the altered centre of gravity; further alterations were necessary to maintain the hydrodynamics properties. On 7 March 1938, K4774 conducted its first post-modification flight, having been outfitted with the intended Bristol Pegasus XXII radial engines, each one capable of generating . On 21 April 1938, the first Sunderland Mark 1 of the development batch conducted its first flight. By this point, manufacturer testing of the prototype had already been completed and the prototype had been transferred to the Seaplane Experimental Station at Felixstowe, Suffolk for its official evaluation by the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment (MAEE); on 8 March 1938, it was joined by the second production aircraft. On 28 May 1938, this second aircraft, which had been cleared for operations under tropical conditions, flew a record-breaking flight to Seletar, Singapore, stopping off along the route at Gibraltar, Malta, Alexandria, Habbaniyah, Bahrain, Karachi, Gwalior, Calcutta, Rangoon, and Mergui. Testing showed that the aircraft could be fully refueled in 20 minutes, and that its most economical cruising speed was about at 2,000 ft. At this speed and altitude, a consumption rate of 110 gallons per hour gave the aircraft an endurance of 18 hours, during which it could cover 2750 miles. The take-off distance was found to be . Design=Overview Bunk area The Short S.25 Sunderland was a large four-engined flying boat developed for military use. The design of the S.25 shared much in common with the civil-orientated S.23, principally differing in its use of a deeper hull profile.Norris 1967, p. 6. As with the S.23, the interior of the Sunderland's fuselage contained two individual decks; the lower deck contained a total of six bunks, along with a galley outfitted with a twin kerosene pressure stove, a yacht-style porcelain flush toilet, an anchoring winch, and a small machine shop for performing inflight repairs. The crew was originally intended to total seven members; this was subsequently increased for later versions of the Sunderland to around 11 crew members and sometimes greater, dependent upon the specific mission being undertaken. The Sunderland featured all-metal, mainly flush-riveted construction, except for the flight control surfaces, which used a fabric- covered metal frame construction. Of these, the flaps employed unusual Gouge- patented devices that slid backwards along curved tracks, moving rearwards and downwards to increase the wing area and generating 30% greater lift for landing.Eden 2004, p. 443. The thick wings, upon which the aircraft's four nacelle-mounted Bristol Pegasus XXII radial engines were carried, also accommodated a total of six drum-style fuel tanks, which possessed a total capacity of 9,200 litres (2,025 Imperial gallons, 2,430 U.S. gallons). In addition to the main fuel tanks, an arrangement of four smaller fuel tanks were installed behind the rear wing spar later on; with the extra tanks fitted, the Sunderland possessed a combined total fuel capacity of 11,602 litres (2,550 Imperial gallons, 3,037 U.S. gallons), which was enough to enable the type to conduct eight- to 14-hour patrols. The FN13 rear turret of a Sunderland of No 210 Squadron at Oban, August 1940. The Sunderland was the first RAF flying boat to be fitted with power-operated gun turrets. The specification to which the Sunderland was developed to conform with had called for an offensive armament of a 37 mm gun and up to of bombs, mines or (eventually) depth charges. The ordnance was stored inside the fuselage in a purpose-built bomb room and was winched up to racks, under the wing centre section, that could be traversed out through doors on each side of the fuselage above the waterline to the release position. Defensive armament included a Nash & Thompson FN-13 powered turret with four .303 British Browning machine guns in the extreme tail and a pair of manually-operated .303 set on either side of the fuselage, firing from ports just below and behind the wings. These machine guns were later upgraded to 0.5-inch calibre Brownings. There were two different nose turret weapons, the most common, later, being two Browning machine guns. The nose weapons were later augmented by four fixed guns, two each side, in the forward fuselage that were fired by the pilot.RAF AP1566(A thru E)-PN, paragraph 32. Much later, a twin-gun turret was to be dorsal-mounted on the upper fuselage, about level with the wing trailing edge, bringing the total defensive armament up to 16 machine guns.Eden 2004, pp. 443‚Äì444. Equipment and on-water management As with all water-based aircraft, there was a need to be able to navigate on water and to control the craft up to and at a mooring. In addition to the standard navigation lights, there was also a demountable mooring mast that was positioned on the upper fuselage just aft of the astrodome hatch with a 360-degree white light to show that the aircraft was moored. The crewmembers were trained in common marine signals for watercraft to ensure safety in busy waters.RAF AP1566 (A thru E)-PN paragraphs 36‚Äì38, 49‚Äì51, 61‚Äì63. The craft could be moored to a buoy by a pendant that attached to the keel under the forward fuselage. When the craft was off the buoy, the forward end of the pendant was attached to the front of the hull just below the bomb aimer's window. For anchoring, there was a demountable bollard that fixed to the forward fuselage from where the front turret was retracted to allow an airman to man the position and pick up the buoy cage or to toss out the anchor. A mooring compartment was situated in the nose of the Sunderland, containing anchor, winch, boat-hook and ladder. The front turret was designed to slide back, enabling the crew to secure the aircraft to a buoy, as demonstrated here. For taxiing after landing, the galley hatches were used to extend sea drogues that could be used to turn the aircraft or maintain its crosswind progress (by deploying the drogue on one side only), or to slow forward motion as much as possible (both deployed). When not in use, the drogues were hand hauled back inboard, folded, and stowed in wall-mounted containers just below the hatches. Operation of the drogues could be a very dangerous exercise if the aircraft was travelling on the water at speed or in strong currents, because the approximately three-ft (1 m) -diameter drogue would haul up on its five-tonne attachment cable end inside the galley very sharply and powerfully. Once deployed, it was normally impossible to recover a drogue unless the aircraft was stationary relative to the local tidal flow. Portable beaching gear could be attached by ground crew so that the aircraft could be pulled up on land. The gear consisted of a pair of two-wheeled struts that could be attached to either side of the fuselage, below the wing, with a two- or four- wheel trolley and towbar attached under the rear of the hull. A standard stocked anchor was stowed in the forward compartment alongside the anchor winch. Depending on the operating area, a number of different kinds of anchor could be carried to cope with different anchorages. Another means of direction control on the water was by application of the rudder and aileron flight controls. The ailerons would cause asymmetric lift from the airflow and, ultimately, drop a float into the water to cause drag on that wing. The pilots could vary engine power to control the direction and speed of the aircraft on the water. In adverse combinations of tide, wind, and destination, this could be very difficult.RAF AP1566 (A thru E)-PN paragraphs 37‚Äì38. Access and servicing A crew member of a Short Sunderland Mark I of No. 10 Squadron RAAF, washing up in the galley during a flight. The Sunderland was usually entered through the bow compartment door on the left forward side of the aircraft. The internal compartments‚Äîbow, gun room, ward room, galley, bomb room and the after compartments‚Äîwere fitted with swash doors to keep them watertight to about two feet (610 mm) above normal water level; these doors were normally kept closed. There was another external door in the tail compartment on the right side. This door was intended for boarding from a Braby (U-shaped) pontoon that was used where there was a full passenger service mooring alongside a wharf or similar. This door could also be used to accept passengers or stretcher-bound patients when the aircraft was in the open water; this was because the engines had to be kept running to maintain the aircraft's position for the approaching vessel and the front door was too close to the left inboard propeller. Normal access to the external upper parts of the aircraft was through the astrodome hatch at the front of the front spar of the wing centre section, just at the rear of the navigator's station.Norris 1967, pp. 6‚Äì7. View of a deployed bomb rack Bomb rack from the inside Bombs were loaded in through the \\"bomb doors\\" that formed the upper half walls of the bomb room on both sides. The bomb racks were able to run in and out from the bomb room on tracks in the underside of the wing. In order to load them, weapons were hoisted up to the extended racks that were run inboard and either lowered to stowages on the floor or prepared for use on the retracted racks above the stowed items. The doors were spring-loaded to pop inwards from their frames and would fall under gravity so that the racks could run out through the space left in the top of the compartment. The bombs could be released locally or remotely from the pilot's position during a bomb run. Normally, the weapons were either bombs or depth charges and the racks were limited to a maximum of each. After the first salvo was dropped, the crew had to get the next eight weapons loaded before the pilot had the aircraft positioned on the next bombing run. The fixed nose guns (introduced when in service with Australian units) were removed when the aircraft was on the water and stowed in the gun room just aft of the bow compartment. The toilet was in the right half of this same compartment and stairs from the cockpit to the bow area divided the two. WAAF engine mechanics servicing a Bristol Pegasus engine of a Short Sunderland Maintenance was performed on the engines by opening panels in the leading edge of the wing either side of the powerplant. A plank could be fitted across the front of the engine on the extensions of the open panels. A small manually started auxiliary petrol engine, which was fitted into the leading edge of the right wing, powered a bilge pump for clearing water and other fluids from the fuselage bilges and a fuel pump for refuelling. Generally, the aircraft were reasonably water tight, and two people manually operating a wobble pump could transfer fuel faster than the auxiliary pump. In sheltered moorings or at sea, fuelling was accomplished by a powered or unpowered barge and with engine driven or hand powered pumps. At regular moorings, there would be specially designed refuelling barges to do the job, normally manned by trained marine crew. These vessels could refuel many aircraft during the course of the day. Handling of the fuel nozzles and opening/closing the aircraft fuel tanks would normally be an aircraftman's task. Tank Landing Craft Airframe repairs were either effected from the inside or delayed until the aircraft was in a sheltered mooring or beached. One serious problem that beset the aircraft was that the heat-treated rivets in the hull plates were susceptible to corrosion after a period in salt water (depending on the quality of the heat treatment process). The heads would pop off from stress corrosion, allowing seawater to leak into the bilges. The only option was to haul the aircraft out onto the \\"hard\\" and replace them, usually at the cost of many additional heads breaking off from the vibration of the riveting. Damage control A large float mounted under each wing maintained stability on water. With no wind, the float on the heavier side was always in the water; with some wind, the aircraft could be held using the ailerons with both floats out of the water. In the event of a float being broken off for some reason, as the craft lost airspeed after landing crew members would go out onto the opposite wing, to keep the remaining float in the water until the aircraft could reach its mooring. Marine growths on the hull were a problem; the resulting drag could be enough to prevent a fully loaded aircraft from gaining enough speed to become airborne. The aircraft could be taken to a freshwater mooring for sufficient time to kill off the fauna and flora growing on the bottom, which would then be washed away during takeoff runs. The alternative was to scrub it off, either in the water or on land. Aircraft with lower hull damage were patched or had the holes filled with any materials to hand before landing. The aircraft would then be immediately put onto a slipway with its wheeled beaching gear or beached on a sandy shore before it could sink. More than two fuselage compartments had to be full of water to sink the aircraft. During the Second World War, a number of severely damaged aircraft were deliberately landed on grass airfields ashore. In at least one case, an aircraft that made a grass landing was repaired to fly again.Nicolaou 1998, p. 124. On the Sunderland Mk V, fuel could be dumped from retractable pipes that extended from the hull and were attached to the bomb room side of the galley aft bulkhead. It was expected that dumping would be done while airborne, but it could also be performed while floating on the water, albeit with care to ensure that the floating fuel went downwind away from the aircraft.RAF AP1566E-PN. Pilots Notes, March 1945, paragraph 78. Sunderland EK573/P of No. 10 Squadron RAAF 'unsticks' after picking up three survivors from a Wellington shot down in the Bay of Biscay, 27 August 1944. The takeoff run of a flying boat was often dependent only on the length of water that was available. The first problem was to gain sufficient speed for the craft to plane, otherwise, there would never be enough speed to become airborne. Once planing, the next problem was to break free from the suction (from Bernoulli's principle) of the water on the hull. This was partly helped by the \\"step\\" in the hull just behind the craft's centre of buoyancy at planing speed. The pilot could rock the craft about this point to try to break the downward pull of the water on the surface of the hull. Somewhat rough water was a help in freeing the hull, but on calm days it was often necessary to have a high speed launch cross in front of the aircraft to cause a break in the water flow under the aircraft. It was a matter of judgement of the coxswain to get the crossing close enough but not too close. Because it was expected that some takeoffs would be protracted affairs, often the crews were not very careful to keep within maximum all-up weight limitations, and getting airborne just took a little longer. Operational history=Second World War , a Type VIIC submarine, down by the stern and sinking, after being attacked by a Short Sunderland flying boat. During the Second World War, although British anti-submarine efforts were disorganized and ineffectual at first, Sunderlands quickly proved useful in the rescue of the crews from torpedoed ships.Norris 1967, pp. 7, 10‚Äì11. On 21 September 1939, two Sunderlands rescued the entire 34-man crew of the torpedoed merchantman Kensington Court from the North Sea. As British anti- submarine measures improved, the Sunderland began to inflict losses as well. A Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Sunderland (of No. 10 Squadron) made the type's first unassisted kill of a U-boat on 17 July 1940. During its service, the Sunderland Mark I received various improvements.Norris 1967, p. 10. The nose turret was upgraded with a second .303 (7.7 mm) gun. New propellers together with pneumatic rubber wing de-icing boots were also fitted. Although the .303 guns lacked range and hitting power, the Sunderland had a considerable number of them and it was a well-built machine that was hard to destroy. On 3 April 1940, a Sunderland operating off Norway was attacked by six German Junkers Ju 88C fighters; during the engagement, it shot one down, damaged another enough to cause it to retreat and later perform a forced landing and drove off the rest. The Germans are reputed to have nicknamed the Sunderland the Fliegendes Stachelschwein (\\"Flying Porcupine\\") due to its defensive firepower.Werner 1999, p. 105. Sunderlands also proved themselves in the Mediterranean theatre. They flew many evacuation missions during the German seizure of Crete, carrying as many as 82 passengers. One flew the reconnaissance mission to observe the Italian fleet at anchor in Taranto before the famous Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm's torpedo attack on 11 November 1940.Cacutt, Len. \\"The World's Greatest Aircraft,\\" Exeter Books, New York, NY, 1988. . New weapons made the flying boats more deadly in combat. In 1939 during an accidental fratricidal attack, one 100 lb anti-submarine bomb hit the British submarine doing no more damage than breaking its light bulbs; other bombs had reportedly bounced up and hit their launch aircraft. In early 1943, these ineffective weapons were replaced by Torpex-filled depth charges that would sink to a determined depth and then explode. This eliminated the problem of bounce-back, and the shock wave propagating through the water augmented the explosive effect. Sunderland Mark II, showing ASV Mark II \\"stickleback\\" antennas in front of the tail While the bright Leigh searchlight was rarely fitted to Sunderlands, ASV Mark II radar enabled the flying boats to attack U-boats on the surface. In response, the German submarines began to carry a radar warning system known formally as \\"Metox\\", and informally as the \\"Cross of Biscay\\" due to the appearance of its receiving antenna, that was tuned to the ASV frequency and gave the submarines early warning that an aircraft was in the area. Kills fell off drastically until ASV Mark III radar was introduced in early 1943, which operated in the centimetric band and used antennas mounted in blisters under the wings outboard of the floats, instead of the cluttered stickleback aerials. Sunderland Mark IIIs fitted with ASV Mark III were called Sunderland Mark IIIAs. Centimetric radar was invisible to Metox and baffled the Germans at first. Admiral Karl D√∂nitz, commander of the German U-boat force, suspected that the British were being informed of submarine movements by spies. In August 1943, a captured RAF airman misled the Germans by telling them that the aircraft were homing in on the signals radiated by the Metox,Johnson 1978, p. 229.Miller 2002, p. ? and consequently U-boat commanders were instructed to turn them off. The Germans responded to Sunderland attacks by fitting some U-boats with one or two 37 mm and twin quad 20 mm flak guns to fire back at their attackers. While Sunderlands could suppress flak to an extent with their nose turret guns, the U-boats guns had superior range, hitting power and accuracy. Attempting to shoot down Allied aircraft did, however, prolong the U-boat's presence on the surface, which made sinking the vessel easier. Nonetheless, fitting of substantial arrays of anti-aircraft guns temporarily decreased U-boat losses while both Allied aircraft and shipping losses rose. As a countermeasure to the increased defensive armament of the U-boats, the Australians fitted their aircraft in the field with an additional four .303s in fixed mounts in the nose, allowing the pilot to add fire while diving on the submarine before bomb release. Most aircraft were similarly modified. The addition of single .50 inch (12.7 mm) flexibly mounted M2 Browning machine guns in the beam hatches behind and above the wing trailing edge also became common. =1943 encounter with Ju 88s= Two airmen demonstrate the dorsal .303in Vickers 'K' guns of a Sunderland The type's capacity to defend itself was demonstrated in particular by an air battle over the Bay of Biscay on 2 June 1943, when eight Junkers Ju 88Cs attacked a single Sunderland Mk III of No. 461 Squadron RAAF: EJ134, squadron code: \\"N for Nuts\\". The 11 crew,Southall 1976, p. ? (This was one of several stories of the type's operations related by author Ivan Southall, who flew in Sunderlands during the war.) led by F/Lt Colin Walker, were on an anti- submarine patrol, while also watching for any signs of a missing airliner, BOAC Flight 777.BOAC Flight 777 had left Lisbon the day before and had subsequently been shot down over the , killing 17, among them, the actor Leslie Howard. At 1900 hours, the rear gunner saw the Ju 88s, which belonged to V.Kampfgeschwader 40 and were led by Leutnant Friedrich Maeder. Walker ordered the dumping of the bombs and depth charges, and took the engines to full power. Two Ju 88s made simultaneous passes at EJ134 from both sides, scoring hits and disabling one engine, while the pilots fought fires and took the Sunderland through corkscrew manoeuvres. On a third pass, the dorsal turret gunner badly damaged or shot down a Ju 88, although the Sunderland's rear gunner was knocked unconscious. Two gunners in a Short Sunderland Mark I sit at their positions with .303 Vickers K-type machine guns, mounted in the upper fuselage hatches. The next Ju 88 that attacked was hit by fire from the dorsal and nose turrets, and appeared to have been shot down. By this time, one crew member on the Sunderland had been mortally wounded and most of the others were wounded to varying degrees, while the aircraft's radio gear had been destroyed, among other damage. However, the rear gunner had recovered, and when EJ134 was attacked from behind, another Ju 88 was badly damaged and left the fight. The remaining Ju 88s continued to attack and the front gunner damaged one of these, setting its engines on fire. Two more Ju 88s were also damaged and the Germans disengaged. EJ134 was badly damaged and the crew threw everything they could overboard, while nursing the aircraft over the 350-mile journey to Britain. At 2248 hours, Walker managed to beach the aircraft at Praa Sands, Cornwall. The 10 surviving crew members were able to wade ashore, while the Sunderland broke up in the surf. Walker received the Distinguished Service Order and several other crew members also received medals. They claimed three Ju 88s destroyed. (With the exception of Walker, the crew returned to operations in a new \\"N for Nuts\\", which was lost over the Bay of Biscay two months later, in an attack by six Ju 88s. On 2 June 2013, a memorial was opened on the green at Praa Sands.) Postwar 205 Squadron Short Sunderland Mark V ML797 \\"P\\" at the ramp of RAF Seletar. This particular airframe became the last of its type to retire from active RAF service on 30 June 1959. At the end of the Second World War, a number of new Sunderlands built at Belfast were simply taken out to sea and scuttled as there was nothing else to do with them. In Europe the type was removed from service relatively quickly but in the Far East, where well developed runways were less common and large land based maritime patrol aircraft like the new Avro Shackleton could not be used so easily, there was still a need for it, and it remained in service with the RAF Far East Air Force at Singapore until 1959, and with the Royal New Zealand Air Force's No. 5 Squadron RNZAF until 1967. During the Berlin Airlift (June 1948 ‚Äì August 1949) 10 Sunderlands and two transport variants (known as \\"Hythes\\") were used to transport goods from Finkenwerder on the Elbe near Hamburg to the isolated city, landing on the Havel river near RAF Gatow until it iced over. The Sunderlands were frequently used for transporting salt, as their airframes were already protected against corrosion from seawater. Transporting salt in standard aircraft risked rapid and severe structural corrosion in the event of a spillage. When the Havelsee did freeze over the Sunderland's role was taken by freight-converted Handley Page Halifaxes with salt being carried in panniers fitted under the fuselage to avoid the corrosion problem. A RNZAF Sunderland MR.5 with a USN Martin P5M Marlin and a RAAF Lockheed P-2 Neptune in 1963. From mid-1950, RAF Sunderlands also saw service during the Korean War initially with No. 88 Squadron but shortly followed by Nos. 205 and 209 Squadrons. The three squadrons shared the operational task equally with rotational detachments of three or four aircraft and crews based at Iwakuni, Japan. Missions lasting 10 to 13 hours were flown daily throughout the war, and also during the Armistice period that followed, until September 1954.Empson, Group Captain Derek K.

The French Navy Escadrille 7FE, which received Sunderlands when it was formed in 1943 as No. 343 Squadron RAF, continued to operate them until December 1960, the last unit to operate Sunderlands in the Northern Hemisphere.Barnes and James 1989, p. 559. Variants=Prototype The first S.25, now named the Sunderland Mark I, flew from the River Medway on 16 October 1937 with Shorts' Chief Test Pilot, John Lankester Parker at the controls. The deeper hull and installation of nose and tail turrets gave the Sunderland a considerably different appearance from the Empire flying boats. The prototype was fitted with Bristol Pegasus X engines, each providing 950 hp (709 kW ), as the planned Pegasus XXII engines of 1,010 hp (753 kW) were not available at the time. The 37 mm gun, originally intended as a primary anti-submarine weapon, was dropped from the plans during the prototype phase and replaced with a Nash & Thompson FN-11 nose turret mounting a single .303-inch (7.7 mm) Vickers GO machine gun. The turret could be winched back into the nose, revealing a small \\"deck\\" and demountable marine bollard used during mooring manoeuvres on the water. The change of armament in the nose to the much lighter gun moved the centre of gravity rearwards. After the first series of flights, the prototype was modified to have a wing that was swept 4.25¬∞ to the rear, thereby moving the centre of pressure into a more reasonable position in relation to the new centre of gravity. This left the engines and wing floats canted out from the aircraft's centreline. Although the wing loading was much higher than that of any previous Royal Air Force flying boat, a new flap system kept the takeoff run to a reasonable length. Sunderland Mark I The RAF received its first Sunderland Mark I in June 1938 when the second production aircraft (L2159) was flown to 230 Squadron at RAF Seletar, Singapore. By the outbreak of war in Europe, in September 1939, RAF Coastal Command was operating 40 Sunderlands. The main offensive load was up to of bombs (usually 250 or 500 lb), mines (1,000 lb) or other stores that were hung on traversing racks under the wing centre section (to and from the bomb room in the fuselage). Later, depth charges (usually 250 lb) were added. By late 1940, two Vickers K machine guns had been added to new hatches that were inserted into the upper sides of the fuselage just aft of the wing, with appropriate slipstream deflectors. A second gun was added to the nose turret. New constant speed propellers and deicing boots were installed as well during 1940. The Sunderland had difficulty in landing and taking off from rough water, but, other than in the open sea, it could be handled onto and off a short chop, by a skilled pilot. Many rescues were made, early in the war, of crews that were in the Channel having abandoned or ditched their aircraft, or abandoned their ship. During May 1941, during the Battle of Crete Sunderlands transported as many as 82 armed men from place to place in one load. Steep ocean swells were never attempted, however a calm ocean could be suitable for landing and takeoff. Beginning in October 1941, Sunderlands were fitted with ASV Mark II \\"Air to Surface Vessel\\" radar. This was a primitive low frequency radar system operating at a wavelength of 1.5 m, that used a row of four prominent \\"stickleback\\" yagi antennas on top of the rear fuselage, two rows of four smaller aerials on either side of the fuselage beneath the stickleback antennas, and a single receiving aerial mounted under each wing outboard of the float and angled outward. A total of 75 Sunderland Mark Is were built: 60 at Shorts' factories at Rochester and Belfast, Northern Ireland, and 15 by Blackburn Aircraft at Dumbarton. Sunderland Mark II In August 1941, production moved on to the Sunderland Mark II which used Pegasus XVIII engines with two-speed superchargers, producing 1,065 hp (794 kW) each. The tail turret was changed to an FN.4A turret that retained the four .303 guns of its predecessor but provided twice the ammunition capacity with 1,000 rounds per gun. Late production Mark IIs also had an FN.7 dorsal turret, mounted offset to the right just behind the wings and fitted with twin .303 machine guns. The hand held guns behind the wing were removed in these versions. Only 43 Mark IIs were built, five of these by Blackburn. Sunderland Mark III A Mark IIIA with Mk III engines and bomb windows, but Mk V radar blisters and nose guns Production quickly changed in December 1941 to the Sunderland Mark III,Eden 2004, pp. 444‚Äì445. which featured a revised hull configuration which had been tested on a Mark I the previous June. This modification improved seaworthiness, which had suffered as the weight of the Sunderland increased with new marks and field changes.Norris 1967, pp. 10‚Äì11. In earlier Sunderlands, the hull \\"step\\" that allows a flying boat to \\"unstick\\" from the surface of the sea was an abrupt one, but in the Mk III it was a curve upwards from the forward hull line. The Mark III turned out to be the definitive Sunderland variant, with 461 built. Most were built by Shorts at Rochester and Belfast, a further 35 at a new (but temporary) Shorts plant at White Cross Bay, Windermere;Barden, Karen. \\"Mystery Surrounds reports.\\" The Westmoreland Gazette archives, 28 November 2002. Retrieved: 2 January 2010.Renouf, Jane. \\"The Way We Were: Lakeland Industries.\\" aohg.org.uk. Retrieved: 2 January 2010. while 170 were built by Blackburn Aircraft. The Sunderland Mark III proved to be one of the RAF Coastal Command's major weapons against the U-boats, along with the Consolidated Catalina. As the U-boats began to use Metox passive receivers the ASV Mk II radar gave away the presence of aircraft and the number of sightings diminished drastically. The RAF response was to upgrade to the ASV Mk III, which operated in the 50 cm band, with antennas that could be faired into fewer more streamlined blisters. During the Mk III's life there were a large number of almost continuous improvements made, including the ASV Mk IIIA and four more machine guns in a fixed position in the wall of the forward fuselage just behind the turret (developed on RAAF aircraft first) with a simple bead and ring sight for the pilot. Sunderlands with upgraded ASV Mk III equipment were designated Mk IIIA. Despite the 14-hour-long patrols expected of their crews, early Sunderland gunners were provided with only 500 rounds of ammunition each. Later 1,000 round ammunition boxes were installed in the turrets. The beam hatch guns were removed from Mk II aircraft but Mk IIIs and then Mk Is gained much more capable .5 guns, one each side. Offensive weapons loads increased too. The introduction of the hydrostatically fused depth charge meant that additional weapons could be carried on the floor of the bomb room in wooden restraints, along with ammunition boxes of 10 and 25 lb anti-personnel bombs that could be hand launched from various hatches to harass U-boat crews otherwise manning the twin 37 and dual quadruple 20 mm cannons with which U-boats were fitted. As radar detection became more effective there were more night patrols to catch U-boats on the surface charging their batteries. Attacking in the dark was a problem that was solved by carrying one inch (25.4 mm), electrically initiated flares and dropping them out of the rear chute of the aircraft as it got close to the surface vessel. Sunderlands were never fitted with Leigh lights. Sunderland Mark IV The Sunderland Mark IV was an outgrowth of the 1942 Air Ministry Specification R.8/42, for a generally improved Sunderland with more powerful Bristol Hercules engines, better defensive armament and other enhancements. The new Sunderland was intended for service in the Pacific. Although initially developed and two prototypes built as the \\"Sunderland Mark IV\\" it was different enough from the Sunderland line to be given a different name, the S.45 \\"Seaford\\".Norris 1967, p. 13. Relative to the Mark III, the Mark IV had a stronger wing, larger tailplanes and a longer fuselage with some changes in hull form for better performance in the water. The armament was heavier with .50 inch (12.7 mm) machine guns and 20 mm Hispano cannon. The changes were so substantial that the new aircraft was redesignated the Short Seaford. Thirty production examples were ordered; the first delivered too late to see combat and only eight production Seafords were completed and never got beyond operational trials with the RAF.Norris 1967, pp. 13‚Äì14. Sunderland Mark V A Sunderland Mark V operated by No. 461 Squadron RAAF The next production version was the Sunderland Mark V, which evolved out of crew concerns over the lack of power of the Pegasus engines. The weight creep (partly due to the addition of radar) that afflicted the Sunderland had resulted in running the Pegasus engines at combat power as a normal procedure and the overburdened engines had to be replaced regularly. Australian Sunderland crews suggested that the Pegasus engines be replaced by Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp engines.Tillman 2004, p. 17. The 14-cylinder engines provided 1,200 hp (895 kW) each and were already in use on RAF Consolidated Catalinas and Douglas Dakotas, and so logistics and maintenance were straightforward. Two Mark IIIs were taken off the production lines in early 1944 and fitted with the American engines. Trials were conducted in early 1944 and the conversion proved all that was expected. A Sunderland Mk V. The bulges under the outer wings are the ASV6 radar antennae The new engines with new Hamilton Hydromatic constant-speed fully feathering propellors provided greater performance with no real penalty in range. In particular, a Twin Wasp Sunderland could stay airborne if two engines were knocked out on the same wing while, in similar circumstances, a standard Mark III would steadily lose altitude. Production was switched to the Twin Wasp version and the first Mark V reached operational units in February 1945. Defensive armament fits were similar to those of the Mark III, but the Mark V was equipped with new centimetric ASV Mark VI C radar that had been used on some of the last production Mark IIIs as well. A total of 155 Sunderland Mark Vs were built with another 33 Mark IIIs converted to Mark V specification. With the end of the war, large contracts for the Sunderland were cancelled and the last of these flying boats was delivered in June 1946, with a total production of 777 aircraft completed. Transport variants Sunderland III of Aquila Airways at Hamble Beach in 1955. This aircraft was the first transport conversion that had served BOAC 1943‚Äì1948, it still carried the name given to it by BOAC Hadfield. In late 1942, the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) obtained six Sunderland Mark IIIs, which had been de-militarised on the production line, for service as mail carriers to Nigeria and India, with accommodation for either 22 passengers with 2 tons of freight or 16 passengers with 3 tons of freight. Armament was removed, the gun positions being faired over, and simple seating fitted in place of the bunks. As such they were operated by BOAC and the RAF jointly from Poole to Lagos and Calcutta. Six more Sunderland IIIs were obtained in 1943. Minor modifications to the engine angles and flight angle resulted in a significant increase in the cruise speed, which was a relatively unimportant issue for the combat Sunderlands. In late 1944, the RNZAF acquired four new Sunderland Mk IIIs already configured for transport duties. In the immediate postwar period, these were used by New Zealand's National Airways Corporation to link South Pacific Islands in the \\"Coral Route\\" before TEAL Short Sandringhams took over after 1947. Post-war civilian use At the war's end BOAC obtained more Mark IIIs and gradually came up with better accommodation for its passengers, in three configurations. Bench seats were removed, and civil-standard seating installed: The H.1 configuration had 16 seats on one deck, while the H.2 had an additional promenade deck, and the H.3 had 24 seats, or sleeping berths for 16. These conversions were given the name Hythe and BOAC operated 29 of them by the end of the war. In February 1946, the first of these, G-AGJM, made a 35,313-mile route survey from Poole to Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Tokyo in 206 flying hours. It was the first British civil flying boat to visit China and Japan.Evans 1993, p. 63. A more refined civilian conversion of the Sunderland was completed by the manufacturer as the postwar Short Sandringham. The Sandringham Mk. I used Pegasus engines while the Mk. II used Twin Wasp engines.

A defensive design to prevent the operator from cutting their own hands because it makes it impossible to accidentally have one hand in the way of harm. Defensive design is the practice of planning for contingencies in the design stage of a project or undertaking. Essentially, it is the practice of anticipating all possible ways that an end-user could misuse a device, and designing the device so as to make such misuse impossible, or to minimize the negative consequences. For example, if it is important that a plug is inserted into a socket in a particular orientation, the socket and plug should be designed so that it is physically impossible to insert the plug incorrectly. Power sockets are often keyed in such a manner, to prevent the transposition of live and neutral. They are also recessed in the wall in a way that makes it impossible to touch connectors once they become live. Defensive design in software engineering is called defensive programming. Murphy's law is a well-known statement of the need for defensive design, and also of its ultimate limitations. Examples * Many electrical connectors apply this principle by being asymmetric.

His first Iditarod was in 1992. His first victory came in 1995 and he followed it by winning in 1999, 2000, and 2001. He competed in every Iditarod from 1992 to 2002, and during his rookie outing he won the Dorothy G. Page Halfway award, for being the first musher to reach the halfway point of the race. He is the only winner from the lower 48 states and second in number of wins. Prior to his Iditarod wins, he also won the Montana Race to the Sky in 1991. Swingley pulled out of the 2004 Iditarod because of frostbite in his corneas (eyes). Since the injury, his night vision has diminished, so he prefers to race during the day. He placed 14th in the 2005 race. He entered the 2006 race. The only five-time winner is Rick Swenson. Doug took control of the race early and led the race coming into the Takotna checkpoint 436 miles in where he elected to take his mandatory 24-hour layover. During the layover he was passed by Jeff King, but those two would challenge each other for the lead until the race reached the Bering Sea coast where Jeff King finally pulled away as Doug's team was having difficulty negotiating occasional stretches of bare ice. Doug finished the race in second place behind King, but vowed to return in 2007 with a very strong team. Swingley was born and raised in Great Falls.

A Liberal, he was elected Liberal state leader in 1981 and in 1982 defeated the Labor government of Harry Holgate on a policy of \\"state development,\\" particularly the building of the Franklin Dam, a hydroelectric dam on the Franklin River. He was only the second non-Labor premier to hold the post in 48 years, and the first in 51 years to govern in majority. Early life Robin Gray was born in Kew, a suburb of Melbourne. Once he had completed high school, he won a scholarship to Dookie Agricultural College and completed a Bachelor of Agricultural Science at the University of Melbourne. His qualifications led to a job as an agricultural consultant at a firm in Victoria's Western District. In 1965, the firm sent Gray to northern Tasmania to operate a branch of the firm in Launceston. Political career During 1976, the state leader of the Liberal Party, Max Bingham, convinced Gray to stand as a candidate in the state election for that year. Gray ended up out-polling three sitting Liberal members in Wilmot. Bingham resigned as leader following his party's poor performance at the 1979 election, which resulted in a marked swing away from the Liberals. Gray was elected Deputy Leader under Geoff Pearsall, and when Pearsall resigned in 1981 for unexplained personal reasons, Gray took over the party's leadership. The campaign on which Gray embarked, to build the Franklin Dam, aroused protests from environmentalists, led by Dr Bob Brown (later a Senator). Gray in 1982 allied with militant left wing FEDFA trade union leader Kelvin McCoy to form in November 1982 the Organisation for Tasmanian Development (OTD) which was directly associated with notable stickers seen on cars in Tasmania like Doze in a Greenie: help Fertilize the South-West, If It's Brown, Flush It, and Keep Warm This Winter:Burn a Greenie. Gray and McCoy praised each other publicly in their promotion of the Gordon-below-Franklin dam. One of the more notable events of Gray's involvement with the OTD was the 3,000-strong rally in Queenstown on 11 December 1982, which included former Premier Eric Reece.Pink 2001, pp.71-88 for accounts of Grays involvement with the Organisation for Tasmanian Development, and the events just mentioned Despite Reece's ALP background, Gray praised Reece as \\"the greatest living Tasmanian.\\" In 1983, the newly elected federal Labor government led by Bob Hawke intervened to prevent the building of the dam. However it was finally a High Court of Australia decision (Commonwealth v Tasmania)‚Äîdespite the persistent clamour for states' rights in which even Joh Bjelke-Petersen was utilisedPink 2001, p.86 for photo‚Äîwhich stopped the dam's construction. Tasmania was the recipient of $276 million in grants by way of compensation.Pink 2001, p.87 Gray was elected to a second term in 1986. This marked the first time in 58 years that a non-Labor government had managed to win a second term in Tasmania. In 1989, he became the center of the debate over LGBT rights in Tasmania. Gray stated that homosexuals were not welcome in Tasmania. But after seven years in power, Gray's Liberals suffered a two-seat swing at the 1989 election, which left them one seat short of a majority, although they were still the largest single group in parliament. The ALP formed an accord with the Greens, whose unprecedented five seats gave them the balance of power.Ward, Airlie: Minority Government, Stateline Tasmania (Australian Broadcasting Corporation), 10 March 2006. Gray refused to resign and asked the Governor, Sir Phillip Bennett, to call fresh elections. Bennett refused to accept his advice, believing that Gray had lost the support of the House and was no longer in a position to ask for a dissolution. When the new legislature rejected Gray's choice for Speaker, Gray realised he stood no chance of surviving a vote of confidence on the floor of the House and resigned. ALP leader Michael Field became the new Premier. A Royal CommissionReport Royal Commission Rouse and others, The Age. later found that Edmund Rouse, a prominent Launceston businessman and chairman of the forestry company Gunns Limited, had tried to bribe a Labor backbencher to cross the floor and keep Gray in power. Gray denied any knowledge of this but an ALP appointed Royal Commission criticised his conduct (having an unexplained $10,000 in the freezer was a problem), but found no legal case to answer. He resigned as Liberal leader on 17 December 1991. Post the Royal Commission conclusion, in 1992 Gray won one of the highest personal votes ever recorded at the next State election. Life after politics From 1996 until his retirement on 5 May 2010, Gray was a director of Gunns.Gunns - Board Of Directors, Gunns Limitedhttp://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/03/16/2846857.htm His son, Ben Gray, was a co-founder of private equity firm BGH Capital. In 2020, he published a book \\"Proud to be Tasmanian\\" (co-authored with his former chief of staff Andrew Tilt). In the book he attacked then party president (and subsequently Senator) Eric Abetz for moving to get rid of him as party leader.

The game was originally published by Battleline Publications in 1974 and republished by Avalon Hill in 1975, and is known as the definitive simulation of the period. The game is played on a hex board with rectangular cardboard counters representing ships and long enough to cover two hexes, which represents the ship's orientation. Players write down their planned moves at the beginning of each turn, then move simultaneously (possibly entangling their ships if they are close to each other), fire their broadsides if any ships are within range, and attempt to board ships that are adjacent. The rules are not especially complicated, but as The Complete Book of Wargames puts it, \\"two turns of this game speak volumes about the significance of wind direction for sailing ships-of-the-line,\\" and, \\"Purely for the feel of being there, this game is unsurpassed.\\" WS&IM; was later published as a computer wargame, winning the Origins Award for Best Military or Strategy Computer Game of 1996. Wooden Ships and Iron Men is no longer being produced but Hasbro, which purchased Avalon Hill, has released the game as a free online promotional item. Criticism Critics have maintained that the simplicity of the rules often creates ahistorical strategies and results, which conflicts with the \\"definitive\\" claim made by some. The complaints arise primarily because most battles end up with ships entangled and battles being resolved by boarding parties fighting until one ship's crew is eliminated. Such situations rarely occurred in history during this period. Other problems occurred due to \\"gamey\\" tactics which invalidate Nelson's strategies and prevent replication of historical tactics from working. However, the legacy and popularity of WS&IM; has spawned descendants based on the original which have strived to correct most of these perceived design flaws.

It is one of the largest conservation areas in Australia, covering 15,800 km¬≤, or almost 20% of Tasmania. It is also one of the last expanses of temperate wilderness in the world, and includes the South West Wilderness. In 2014, the Abbott Government proposed de-listing the Tasmanian Wilderness as a World Heritage Site so as to allow the logging of trees within the protected area. This would have been the first time a developed nation has de-listed a site for economic purposes. It was rejected by the World Heritage Committee the same year. In 2016, the Tasmanian government withdrew the bid to allow logging in the Tasmanian Wilderness after a UNESCO report opposed the idea.  History  The area is one of the largest conservation areas in Australia, covering 15,800 km¬≤, or almost 20% of Tasmania after extensions in 1989 and 2013.Bridie Jabour: \\"Tasmania's old growth forests win protection after three-decade battle. World Heritage Centre has extended heritage listed boundary by more than 170,000 hectares\\" in The Guardian, 24 June 2013 It constitutes one of the last expanses of temperate wilderness in the world, and includes the South West Wilderness. The Tasmanian Wilderness, a network of parks and reserves with steep gorges, underwent severe glaciation. Human remains dating back more than 20,000 years have been found in limestone caves in the area. Despite advising the UN World Heritage Committee (WHC) in 2010 that it had no intention to extend the property any further the federal labor government submitted a proposal for a minor boundary modification (MBM) to the property in January 2013 which was accepted at the 37th session of the WHC in June 2013. Former Greens Senator Bob Brown, claimsBrown stated \\"As the Leader of the Australian Greens, now holding the balance of power in the Australian national parliament, I worked early with colleagues to have the government of Prime Minister Julia Gillard promulgate the 2013 forest lands nomination.\\" in Submission 310 to Australian Senate Inquiry into the TWWHA 2014 to have secured the government backflip on extending the property further, using the Greens political leverage in minority Labor government and with holding the balance of power in the Australian senate following the 2010 election. The underpinning science used to justify the MBM was that generated by the 2011/12 Tasmanian Forest Agreement (TFA) Independent Verification Group (IVG). This group was jointly appointed by Tasmanian and Federal governments to verify claims of high conservation value in 572,000ha of reserves proposed by the TFA environmental signatories The Wilderness Society (TWS), The Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) and Environment Tasmania (ET). The Terms of Reference for the Verification group issued by the former Prime Minister Julia Gillard explicitly required those involved in the IVG process to be independent of government and all other stakeholders. The IVG process validated all the TFA ENGO claims as did the peer review. Public concerns were raised about the independence of the IVG's work in 2012/13 with former World Heritage Centre Director, Mr Kishore Rao, who subsequently wrote to the Australian Government in early 2013 requesting clarification on the independence of the IVG's work. The Australian government responseLetter Dr Kimberly Dripps, Deputy Secretary, Environment Protection and Heritage Conservation to Mr Kishore Rao dated 28 March 2013 stated that the process and academics involved were independent. Subsequent information released under Department of Environment FOI during 2014-16 revealed that many involved in the IVG process failed to comply with the Terms of Reference and were substantially affiliated with TFA signatory ENGOs ‚Äì including holding senior positions within those organisations or having received substantial payments from these very organisations. Even the \\"independent\\" peer review scientist had clear links to the Wilderness Society. This scientist, Professor Reed Noss, was the co-founder of the US based Wildlands Project of which The Wilderness Society is their Australian partner, implementing Wildlands concepts in Australia. Wildlands co-founder Michael Soul√© was on the Wilderness Society's Wild Country Science Council as was IVG lead scientist Professor Brendan Mackey.. The released FOI information showed that no conflicts of interest were declared in this regard and that although the Department of Environment was completely aware of the conflicts, they chose not to rely on conflict of interest clauses in contractors contracts or held a single document on either the declaration of or the management of conflicts of interest.Australian National Audit Office investigation into IVG September 2014 In 2014, the Abbott Government proposed de-listing the Tasmanian Wilderness as a World Heritage Site so as to allow the logging of trees within the protected area. If successful, the proposal would have marked the first time a developed nation had de-listed a site for economic purposes. The proposal was rejected by the 38th Session of the World Heritage Committee in June 2014, which met in Doha, Qatar. The Abbott Government has since stated it intends to respect the decision of the committee. Other controversial environment related projects spearheaded by the Abbott Government include the Great Barrier Reef dredging project. In 2016, the Tasmanian government withdrew the bid to allow logging in the Tasmanian Wilderness after a UNESCO report opposed the idea, despite UNESCO World Heritage procedures UNESCO Managing Natural World heritage Properties 2012, S5.1, Sustainable Use and Benefit Sharing allowing for such an activity and the WHC approving a much higher level of timber harvesting in another WH property ‚Äì Gros Morne National Park.

Despite its name, the 6th was actually the second of two airborne divisions raised by the British Army during the war, the other being the 1st Airborne Division. The 6th Airborne Division was formed in the Second World War, in mid-1943, and was commanded by Major- General Richard N. Gale. The division consisted of the 3rd and 5th Parachute Brigades along with the 6th Airlanding Brigade and supporting units. The division's first mission was Operation Tonga on 6 June 1944, D-Day, part of the Normandy landings, where it was responsible for securing the left flank of the Allied invasion during Operation Overlord. The division remained in Normandy for three months before being withdrawn in September. The division was entrained day after day later that month, over nearly a week, preparing to join Operation Market Garden but was eventually stood down. While still recruiting and reforming in England, it was mobilised again and sent to Belgium in December 1944, to help counter the surprise German offensive in the Ardennes, the Battle of the Bulge. Their final airborne mission followed in March 1945, Operation Varsity, the second Allied airborne assault over the River Rhine. After the war the division was identified as the Imperial Strategic Reserve, and moved to the Middle East. Initially sent to Palestine for parachute training, the division became involved in an internal security role. In Palestine, the division went through several changes in formation, and had been reduced in size to only two parachute brigades by the time it was disbanded in 1948. Creation On 31 May 1941, a joint Army and RAF memorandum was approved by the Chiefs-of-Staff and Winston Churchill; it recommended that the British airborne forces should consist of two parachute brigades, one based in England and the other in the Middle East, and that a glider force of 10,000 men should be created.Tugwell, p.123 Then on 23 April 1943 the War Office authorised the formation of a second British airborne division.Harclerode, p.223 This second formation was numbered the 6th Airborne Division, and commanded by Major-General Richard Nelson Gale, who had previously raised the 1st Parachute Brigade.Tugwell, p.202 Under his command would be the existing 3rd Parachute Brigade, along with two battalions (2nd Ox and Bucks and 1st Ulster Rifles) transferred from the 1st Airborne Division, to form the nucleus of the new 6th Airlanding Brigade. The airlanding brigade was an important part of the airborne division, its strength being almost equal to that of the two parachute brigades combined,Guard, p.37 and the glider infantry battalions were the heaviest armed infantry units in the British Army. At the same time, several officers, combat veterans from the 1st Airborne Division, were posted to the division as brigade and battalion commanders.Tugwell, p.209 Between May and September, the remainder of the divisional units were formed, including the 5th Parachute Brigade, the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment, the 53rd (Worcester Yeomanry) Airlanding Light Regiment, Royal Artillery and the division's Pathfinders the 21st Independent Parachute Company.Ford, pp.19‚Äì20 Headquarters were at Syrencot House, Figheldean, Wiltshire. GOC, Major-General Richard Nelson \\"Windy\\" Gale. From June to December 1943, the division prepared for operations, training at every level from section up to division by day and night.Harclerode, p.225 Airborne soldiers were expected to fight against superior numbers of the enemy, who would be equipped with artillery and tanks. Training was therefore designed to encourage a spirit of self-discipline, self-reliance and aggressiveness, with emphasis given to physical fitness, marksmanship and fieldcraft.Guard, p.225 A large part of the training consisted of assault courses and route marching. Military exercises included capturing and holding airborne bridgeheads, road or rail bridges and coastal fortifications. At the end of most exercises, the troops would march back to their barracks, usually a distance of around . An ability to cover long distances at speed was expected; airborne platoons were required to cover a distance of in 24 hours, and battalions . At the end of the war in Europe, in May 1945, the division was selected to go to India and form an airborne corps with the 44th Indian Airborne Division.Gregory, p.125 The division‚Äôs advance party, formed around the 5th Parachute Brigade, had already arrived in India, when the Japanese surrendered after the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.Wilson, p.3 Following the surrender, all these plans changed. The post-war British Army only needed one airborne division, and the 6th Airborne was chosen to remain on strength and was sent to the Middle East as the Imperial Strategic Reserve.Wilson, p.4 When the division was dispatched to the Middle East, the 2nd Parachute Brigade was assigned to bring them up to strength.Wilson, pp.212‚Äì213 In May 1946, after the 1st Airborne Division was disbanded, the 1st Parachute Brigade joined the division, replacing the 6th Airlanding Brigade.Wilson, pp.214‚Äì215 The next major manpower development came in 1947, when the 3rd Parachute Brigade was disbanded and the 2nd Parachute Brigade, while remaining part of the division, was withdrawn to England, then sent to Germany.Wilson, pp.216‚Äì217 On 18 February 1947, it was announced that the 6th Airborne Division would be disbanded when they left Palestine. Gradually the division's units left the country and were disbanded, the last ones comprising part of divisional headquarters, the 1st Parachute Battalion and the 1st Airborne Squadron, Royal Engineers, departed on 18 May 1948.Cole, p.209 Operational history pathfinders, prior to take off for Normandy 5 June 1944. On 23 December 1943, the division was told to be prepared for active service from 1 February 1944.Harclerode, p.226 Training intensified and in April 1944, under the command of I Airborne Corps, the division took part in Exercise Mush. Held in the counties of Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire and Wiltshire, this was an airborne military exercise spread over three days involving both the 1st and 6th Airborne Divisions. Unknown to the 6th Airborne, the exercise was a full-scale rehearsal for the division's involvement in the imminent Normandy invasion.Gregory 1979, p.100 During which, the division's two parachute brigades would land just after midnight on 6 June, while the airlanding brigade arrived later in the day at 21:00. The division's objective was to secure the left flank of the invasion area, by dominating the high ground, in the area between the rivers Orne and Dives. This included the capture of two bridges crossing the Orne river and canal; destroying the Merville Gun Battery, which was in a position to engage troops landing at the nearby Sword Beach; and destroying bridges crossing the Dives, to prevent German reinforcements approaching the landing beaches from the north.Saunders 1971, p.143Gregory 1979, p.101 D-Day The invasion of Normandy started just after midnight 6 June 1944\\\\. The first units of the division to land were the pathfinders and six platoons from 'D' Company of the 2nd Battalion, Ox and Bucks Light Infantry, from Brigadier Hugh Kindersley's 6th Airlanding Brigade. While the pathfinders marked the division drop zones, 'D' Company carried out a coup de main glider assault on the two bridges crossing the River Orne and the Caen Canal. Within minutes of landing, both bridges had been captured and the company dug in to defend them until relieved. The company commander, Major John Howard, signalled their success by transmitting the codewords \\"Ham and Jam\\". The 6th Airborne Division positions in Normandy 6 June 1944 Shortly afterwards the aircraft carrying Brigadier Nigel Poett's 5th Parachute Brigade arrived overhead heading for their drop zone (DZ) to the north of Ranville. The brigade were to reinforce the defenders at the bridges, the 7th Parachute Battalion in the west, while the 12th Parachute Battalion and the 13th Parachute Battalion dug in to the east, centred around Ranville, where brigade HQ would be located. Brigadier James Hill's 3rd Parachute Brigade had two DZs, one in the north for the 9th Parachute Battalion who were tasked to destroy the Merville Gun Battery and the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion who would destroy bridges over the River Dives. The 8th Parachute Battalion would land at the other DZ, and destroy bridges over the Dives in the south. NormandyBreakout With the capture of Breville the division was not attacked in force again, apart from an almost continuous artillery bombardment between 18 and 20 June.Cole 1963, p.93 Further reinforcements arrived east of the River Orne on 20 July; the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division moved into the line between the 6th Airborne and the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division.Harclerode, p.348 Then on 7 August the 6th Airborne Division was ordered to prepare to move over to the offensive, with its objective being the mouth of the River Seine.Otway 1990, pp.187‚Äì188 The three divisions east of the Orne came under command of British I Corps, part of the First Canadian Army, and when issuing his orders Lieutenant-General John T. Crocker, aware that the 6th Airborne had almost no artillery, vehicles or engineer equipment, did not expect them to advance very quickly. To reach the Seine the division would have to cross three major rivers, and there were only two main lines of advance; one road running along the coast and another further inland from Troarn to Pont Audemer.Saunders 1971, p.196 The division returned to England in early September, having suffered over 4,500 casualties since D-Day. Ardennes In England the division went into a period of recruitment and training, concentrating on house to house street fighting in the bombed areas of Southampton and Birmingham. The training programme culminated in Exercise Eve, an assault on the River Thames, which was intended to simulate the River Rhine in Germany.Saunders, p.279 By December the division, now commanded by Major- General Eric L. Bols, was preparing for Christmas leave, when news of the German offensive in the Ardennes broke. With 29 German and 33 Allied divisions involved, the Battle of the Bulge became the largest single battle on the Western Front during the Second World War.Gregory, p.118 As part of the First Allied Airborne Army, the 6th Airborne Division was available as a component of the Allied strategic reserve. The division was shipped to the Continent by sea, through Calais and Ostend. Together with the other two reserve formations, the American 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, already at Rheims in northern France, they were sent to Belgium.Hastings, p.239 On Christmas Day the 6th Airborne moved up to take position in front of the spearhead of the German advance; by Boxing Day they had reached their allocated places in the defensive line between Dinant and Namur, with the 3rd Parachute Brigade on the left, the 5th Parachute Brigade on the right, and the 6th Airlanding Brigade in reserve.Harclerode, p.549 Over the next days the German advance was halted and forced back until, at the end of January 1945, the brigade crossed into the Netherlands. Here the division was made responsible for the area along the River Maas between Venlo and Roermond. The division carried out patrols on both sides of the river against their opponents from the German 7th Parachute Division. Near the end of February, the 6th Airborne Division returned to England to prepare for another airborne mission; to cross the River Rhine.Saunders, p.283 Rhine crossing glider troops of the 1st Battalion, Royal Ulster Rifles digging in on the banks of the River Issel, Germany, after landing, March 1945. Whereas all other Allied airborne landings had been a surprise for the Germans, the Rhine crossing was expected, and their defences were reinforced in anticipation. The airborne operation was preceded by a two- day round-the-clock bombing mission by the Allied air forces. Then on 23 March 3,500 artillery guns targeted the German positions. At dusk Operation Plunder, an assault river crossing of the Rhine by the 21st Army Group, began.Gregory, p.85 For their part in Operation Varsity, the 6th Airborne Division was assigned to Major General Matthew Ridgway's U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps, serving alongside Major General William Miley's U.S. 17th Airborne Division.Harclerode, p.551 Far East The 5th Parachute Brigade was sent to the Far East arriving after VJ Day, they were sent to protect and secure Dutch East Indies interest and property, as well as dealing with internal security in Java and Singapore, whilst disarming members of the Japanese Army till 1946. By this time they were sent back to Palestine to take part in peacekeeping with the rest of the 6th Airborne Division. Palestine Arms and ammunition found during Operation Bream, a search of a Jewish settlement In late 1945, the 6th Airborne Division deployed to Palestine as the Jewish insurgency against British rule there intensified. Its duties included enforcement of curfews and searches of cities, towns, and rural settlements for arms and guerrillas. In late 1947, as the British withdrawal from Palestine began, it was involved in the 1947-48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine between the Jewish and Arab communities, and engaged both Jewish and Arab forces. The division's units gradually departed the country, with the last of the division's troops leaving Haifa on 18 May, only a few days after Israeli independence. Between October 1945 and April 1948, the division's losses to enemy action were 58 killed and 236 wounded. Another 99 soldiers died from causes other than enemy action.Wilson, p.228 During searches of Jewish and Arab areas for arms, the division's soldiers had uncovered 99 mortars, 34 machine guns, 174 sub machine guns, 375 rifles, 391 pistols, 97 land mines, 2,582 hand grenades and 302,530 rounds of ammunition.Wilson, p.250 Order of battle The 6th Airborne Division was constituted as follows during the war:Joslen, p. 106-107. 6th Airlanding Brigade (from 6 May 1943) * 2nd Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry * 1st Battalion, Royal Ulster Rifles * 12th Battalion, Devonshire Regiment 3rd Parachute Brigade (from 15 May 1943) * 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion (left 11 August 1943) * 8th (Midlands) Parachute Battalion * 9th (Eastern and Home Counties) Parachute Battalion * 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion (from 11 August 1943) 5th Parachute Brigade (from 1 June 1943, left 19 July 1945) * 12th (Yorkshire) Parachute Battalion * 13th (Lancashire) Parachute Battalion * 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion (from 11 August 1943) 2nd Independent Parachute Brigade Group (from 29 August 1945) * 4th Parachute Battalion * 5th (Scottish) Parachute Battalion * 6th (Royal Welch) Parachute Battalion Divisional Troops * 22nd Independent Parachute Company, Army Air Corps (from 26 October 1943, left 19 July 1945) * 1st Airborne Light Tank Squadron, Royal Armoured Corps (left 13 January 1944) * 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment (from 14 January 1944) * 3rd Airlanding Anti-Tank Battery, Royal Artillery * 4th Airlanding Anti-Tank Battery, Royal Artillery * 53rd (Worcester Yeomanry) Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery (from 27 October 1943, became 53rd (Worcester Yeomanry) Airlanding Light Regiment, Royal Artillery 3 November 1943) * 2nd Airlanding Light Regiment, Royal Artillery (from 24 February 1945) * 2nd Airlanding Light Anti-Aircraft Battery, Royal Artillery (from 26 May 1943, left 20 February 1944) * 249th (East Anglian) Field Company (Airborne), Royal Engineers (from 7 June 1943) * 3rd Parachute Squadron, Royal Engineers (from 7 June 1943, became 3rd Airborne Squadron, Royal Engineers 28 May 1945) * 591st (Antrim) Parachute Squadron, Royal Engineers (from 7 June 1943, left 28 May 1945) * 9th Airborne Squadron, Royal Engineers (from 1 June 1945) * 286th (Airborne) Field Park Company, Royal Engineers (from 7 June 1943) * 6th Airborne Divisional Signals Regiment, Royal Corps of Signals (from 7 May 1943) Units attached *1st Special Service Brigade *4th Special Service Brigade *1st Belgian Infantry Brigade *Royal Netherlands Motorized Infantry Brigade Commanders *Major-General Richard Gale (1943 - 1944) *Major General Eric Bols (1944 - 1946) \\"Major-General James Cassels (1946 - 1947) *Major-General Hugh Stockwell (1947 - 1948) See also * List of British divisions in World War II Notes ; Footnotes ; Citations References      * * Category:British World War II divisions Category:Airborne divisions of the United Kingdom Category:Military units and formations established in 1943 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1948 Category:1943 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:1948 disestablishments in the United Kingdom Category:Military units and formations of the British Empire in World War II ","title":"6th Airborne Division (United Kingdom)"},{"id":"457344","text":"The Trebbia (stressed Tr√®bbia; ) is a river predominantly of Liguria and Emilia Romagna in northern Italy. It is one of the four main right-bank tributaries of the river Po, the other three being the Tanaro, the Secchia and the Panaro. Along its eastern banks in 218 BC was fought one of the battles of the Second Punic War: the Battle of Trebbia, where Hannibal defeated a Roman consular army. The drainage basin is divided among Emilia Romagna, , Liguria, , and Lombardy, . Its principal tributaries are the torrents Aveto and Perino (from the right) and the torrent Boreca (from the left). Geography The source of the river, the Trebbia river spring, is in the Ligurian Apennines on the south slopes of Monte Prel√†, to the south of Monte Antola in the comune of Torriglia, Province of Genoa. Monte Prel√†, high,The other reference has . is part of the Antola massif. The spring is not on the peak but is at roughly . Across a small ridge to the west, on which sits Torriglia, and slightly further downslope is the source of the Scrivia river. Over a ridge to the northeast is the Brugneto reservoir, water supply for Genoa. The reservoir was created in 1959 by damming Brugneto stream, which formerly joined its waters to the Trebbia, but now only does so when the reservoir is full. A ridge running north from Prel√† connects to Monte Druso, then to Monte Cremado, and finally to Monte Antola at . From its peak on a clear day can be seen Genoa, Corsica, the Tuscan Archipelago and the Alps. From its source the river flows towards north-east for The other reference has . until it reaches the Po just to the west of Piacenza. The Alta Val Trebbia (\\"High Trebbia Valley\\") includes the valley down to Bobbio. It straddles eight comuni of the Province of Genoa: Torriglia, Rondanina, Propata, Fascia, Montebruno, Rovegno, Fontanigorda and Gorreto. Each of these contains numerous hamlets, some on the river, most on the slopes. Gorreto is on the Ligurian side of the border with Piacenza province. The Ponte Gobbo (‚Äòhunchback bridge‚Äô) or Ponte Vecchio (‚Äòold bridge‚Äô) is a Devil‚Äôs Bridge of , which spans the river at Bobbio. Past Gorreto the Trebbia flows under a few mountain villages arriving at the next town, Ottone. Below Ottone Val Boreca enters from the left opposite the frazione of Losso. The Boreca is a mountain brook falling from the heights of the \\"four provinces\\" region generally too small to be shown on maps but visible in satellite photographs. Just below Zerba (from which it is accessed) its waters are impounded by a dam diverting them through the turbines of a hydroelectric power station. The border with the Province of Pavia in southernmost Lombardy follows the Trebbia for about where it bends around Ponte Organasco, so that some of the river and bottom lands are in Lombardy. Further downstream the valley opens to accommodate Corte Brugnatella and then closes to form steep sides again. Receiving the Torrente Carlone from the left it enters Bobbio on the left bank. Here the high valley ends and the valley becomes the Val Trebbia. The river goes on under a good many small communities located up on the flanks of the hills before reaching the next good-sized town on it, Travo, and then Rivergaro. Here the val ends. It widens and merges with the Pianura Padana, \\"plain of the Po\\", beyond Rivergaro and a few miles later encounters the suburban communities on the west side of Piacenza before entering the Po. Geologically the course of the lower Trebbia and that of the Po is unstable except where stabilized by man. Nearly the whole course of the river is paralleled by the Strada statale della Val Trebbia, highway SS45, running between Piacenza and Genoa. It encounters the river at Rivergaro and winds with it through the mountains, breaking away just below the source to bend southwest over the ridges to Genoa. Ecology=Flora The following trees are predominant in the forests of Val Trebbia: Fagus silvatica at to ; over 1500 m: Sorbus aucuparia, Sorbus aria, Laburnum anagyroides, Acer pseudoplatanus, Abies alba, Larix decidua, Alnus incana, Populus tremula; below : Quercus cerris, Quercus sessiflora, Quercus pubescens, Ostrya carpinifolia, Carpinus betulus, Fraxinus ornus, Acer campestre, Ulmus campestris, Populus alba, Populus canescens, Alnus glutinosa, Prunus avium, Pirus communis, Malus communis, Corylus avellana; below : Castanea sativa. The shrubbery includes the following species: Juniperus communis, Rubus fruticosus, Rubus idaeus, Polygala chamaebuxus, Daphne mezereum, Vaccinium myrtillus, Cornus mas, Euonymus europaea, Cytisus sessilifolius, Erica arborea, Ruscus aculeatus, Clematis vitalba, Lonicera caprifolium, Crataegus oxyacantha, Rosa canina, Spartium junceum. The ferns are Polypodium volgare, Asplenium ruta-muraria, Dryopteris filix-mas, Pteridium aquilinum, Notholaena marantae. Fauna The Val Trebbia is within the endemic range of Moltoni's warbler, a subspecies of Sylvia cantillans better known in the western Mediterranean islands. The birds forage for insects in mixed shrubland of varying heights and both broad-leaved and coniferous composition. The other birds include Buteo buteo, Falco tinnunculus, Accipiter nisus, Pernis apivorus, Cinclus cinclus, Charadrius dubius, Motacilla alba, Motacilla flava, Alcedo atthis, Alectoris rufa and Picus viridis. Geologic history The northern Apennines are a belt of northeast-southwest mountains on the coast of northwest Italy folded by transverse thrusting from sedimentary rock. The streams draining it run primarily in a northeastern direction perpendicular to the line of the folds and project into the Po river an average of from the source. The eroded landscape of the north Apennines covers about . For much of their lengths, these heavily braided streams run through montane terrain that is minimally developed, is known for its wildlife, and remains in a pristine state. The sediment eroded from the mountains is deposited in alluvial fans and terraces in the Po valley, which is heavily populated and in ancient times flooded regularly. Diking has prevented much of the flooding but now due to confinement of deposition within the stream beds significant lengths of stream run entirely above ground, in places as high as the rooftops. This is a development of the previous thousand years. The native rock differs between the two banks. On the left is mainly sedimentary rock, the Monte Antola limestone, which is actually a marlstone. On the right is both sedimentary and metamorphic rock: ophiolite, serpentinite, basalt, jasper. Val Trebbia is covered with a blanket of rich soil reddish or brown in color from hematite an average of deep. It consists of loess deposited in layers during periods of glacial maxima beginning about 400000 years ago in the Middle Pleistocene. The loess initially accumulated on gravelled terraces deriving from native rock. Cultural history Judging from the archaeological evidence, the Trebbia valley has been continuously occupied since the end of the Acheulian in the Paleolithic, about 150000 years ago. In the Mesolithic various summer camps for high-altitude hunting were located in the valley. Neolithic cultures were at first diverse (4500 BC). Later in the Neolithic, at about 4000 BC, the Square-mouthed pottery culture began to prevail; at about 3000 BC, the Chassey-Lagozza culture of the Chalcolithic. The Bronze Age population resided in settlements located at positions with natural defenses. Etruscan elements began in the Iron Age, about the 5th century BC. Celtic artifacts immediately preceded the Roman presence. Along its eastern banks in 218 BC was fought one of the battles of the Second Punic War: the Battle of Trebbia, where Hannibal defeated a Roman consular army. The name of the river is first known from Polybius, who wrote in the middle Roman Republic, but used materials dating to earlier. Which people first assigned it and during which period remains unclear. Without knowing the probable language the few etymologies are highly speculative.

It is among the largest libraries in the world and the largest in the Nordic countries.Den store danske: Det kongelige bibliotek In 2017 it merged with the State and University Library in Aarhus to form a combined national library. The combined library organisation (the separate library locations in Copenhagen and Aarhus are maintained) is known as the Royal Danish Library (). It contains numerous historical treasures, and a copy of all works printed in Denmark since the 17th century are deposited there. Thanks to extensive donations in the past, the library holds nearly all known Danish printed works back to and including the first Danish books, printed in 1482 by Johann Snell. History The library was founded in 1648 by King Frederik III, who contributed a comprehensive collection of European works. It was opened to the public in 1793. In 1989, it was merged with the prestigious Copenhagen University Library (founded in 1482) (UB1). In 2005, it was merged with the Danish National Library for Science and Medicine (UB2), now the Faculty Library of Natural and Health Sciences. The official name of the organization as of 1 January 2006 is The Royal Library, the National Library of Denmark and the Copenhagen University Library. In 2008, the Danish Folklore Archive was merged with the Royal Library. Librarians The first librarian was Marcus Meibom, followed 1663-1671 by Peder Griffenfeld.Albert Fabricius: Det kongelige Biblioteks Embedsm√¶nd og Funktion√¶rer 1653-1943, 1943 Later librarians included J. H. Schlegel, Jon Erichsen, Daniel Gotthilf Moldenhawer (1787-1823 notorious for stealing numerous books to enrich the library collections) and Chr. Bruun. Since 1900 the former librarians are H.O. Lange (1901-1924), Carl S. Petersen (1924-1943), Svend Dahl (1943-1952), Palle Birkelund (1952-1982), Torkil Olsen (1982-1986), Erland Kolding Nielsen (1986-2017), followed by the present Director General Svend Larsen. Items collected Books, journals, newspapers, pamphlets and corporate publications, manuscripts and archives, maps, prints and photographs, music scores, documentation of folkways and popular traditions, four annual electronic copies of the Danish Internet by legal deposit. As of 2017, there Royal Library had 36,975,069 physical units and 2,438,978 electronic titles. The Royal Library today Today, The Royal Library has five sites: The main library at Slotsholmen, Copenhagen harbour (in the Black Diamond), covering all subjects and special collections; one at N√∏rre Alle, Faculty Library of Natural and Health Sciences; one at Gothersgade, central Copenhagen, Faculty Library of Social Sciences; one at Amager, Faculty Library of Humanities; and, one in Studiestr√¶de, central Copenhagen, The Faculty of Law Library. The annual circulation is 11,400,000 loans (10,900,000 of these are electronic loans). The members are 32,196 active users. The annual budget: 394M Danish Kroner (58M US Dollars), including building expenses and maintenance. The library is open to anyone above the age of 18 with a genuine need to use the collections. Special rules apply for use of rare and valuable items. Buildings at the Slotsholmen site The old building of the Slotsholmen site was built in 1906 by Hans J√∏rgen Holm. The central hall is a copy of Charlemagne's Palace chapel in the Aachen Cathedral. The building is still being used by the library.Panoramic view of the new building opened in 1999 (taken by Peter Pihlmann Pedersen, 2013) In 1999, a new building adjacent to the old one was opened at Slotsholmen, known as the Black Diamond. The Black Diamond building was designed by Danish architects schmidt hammer lassen. Named for its outside cover of black marble and glass, the Black Diamond building houses a concert hall in addition to the library. The Black Diamond is formed by two black cubes that are slightly tilted over the street. In between, there is an eight-storey atrium whose walls are white and wave- shaped, with a couple of transversal corridors that link both sides, and balconies on every floor. The atrium's exterior wall is made of glass; so, you can see the sea; and, on the opposite shore, you can see Christianshavn's luxury buildings. Three bridges connect the Black Diamond with the old part of the Royal Library; those three bridges (two small ones for internal transport and a big one with the circulation desk) go over the road. At the ceiling of the big bridge, there is a huge painting by Danish painter Per Kirkeby. First page of the Primer nueva cor√≥nica y buen gobierno of Guam√°n Poma de Ayala Significant holdings The Royal Library acquires Danish books through legal deposit. The holdings include an almost complete collection of all Danish printed books back from 1482. In 2006, legal deposit was extended to electronic publications and now the library harvests four electronic copies of the Danish Internet each year. The library also holds a large and significant collection of old foreign scholarly and scientific literature, including precious books of high value and of importance for book history, including a rare copy of the Gutenberg Bible. The library holds treasures which are inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Register: A collection of about 2,000 books by and about Carl Linn√© (1997); the manuscripts and correspondence of Hans Christian Andersen (1997); the S√∏ren Kierkegaard Archives (manuscripts and personal papers) (1997); Guam√°n Poma de Ayala's El Primer Nueva Coronica y Buen Gobierno, an autographed manuscript of 1,200 pages including 400 full- page drawings depicting the indigenous point of view on pre-conquest Andean life and Inca rule, the Spanish conquest in 1532, early Spanish colonial rule, and the systematic abuse of the rights of the indigenous populationt (2007). Biblia Latina. Commonly called the Hamburg Bible or the Bible of Bertoldus (MS. GKS 4 2¬∞), a richly illuminated Bible in three very large volumes made for the Cathedral of Hamburg in 1255. The 89 illuminated initials in the book are unique both as expressions of medieval art and as sources to the craft and history of the medieval book. (2011); Other treasures are the Copenhagen Psalter, the Dalby Book (a Latin Gospel on parchment), the Angers fragment (parts of Denmark's first national chronicle), and maps of the Polar Region. The library also holds important collections of Icelandic manuscripts, primarily in Den gamle kongelige samling (The Old Royal Collection) and Den nye kongelige samling (The New Royal Collection). Denmark's most outstanding Icelandic collection, the Arnamagn√¶an Manuscript Collection, is however not a holding of The Royal Library but of the University of Copenhagen. Book thefts Between 1968 and 1978, the library saw one of the largest book thefts in history. Someone had managed to steal some 1,600 historical books worth more than $50 million, including prints by Martin Luther and first editions by Immanuel Kant, Thomas More and John Milton. The theft remained undetected until 1975. Between 1998 and 2002, the thief succeeded in selling books worth about $2 million at various auctions. The case was finally solved in September 2003, after a stolen book had surfaced at Christie's auction house in London. The thief, a director of the library's oriental department named Frede M√∏ller- Kristensen, had died in January 2003. His family then became careless in selling the remaining books. At a coordinated raid of the family's homes in Germany and Denmark in November 2003, some 1,500 books were recovered. In June 2004, his wife, son, daughter-in-law and a family friend were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 18 months to three years; the friend was acquitted on appeal. In April 2005, a daughter of the thief was also found guilty.

The artist's real surname is uncertain. He is said to have borne the family name of \\"Sodona\\" but also the name \\"Tizzioni\\". Sodona is the signature on some of his pictures. While Bazzi was corrupted into Razzi, Sodona may have been corrupted into \\"Sodoma\\" (Latin and Italian for Sodom, the biblical city). Il Sodoma painted in a manner that superimposed the High Renaissance style of early 16th-century Rome onto the traditions of the provincial Sienese school; he spent the bulk of his professional life in Siena, with two periods in Rome. Biography Giovanni Bazzi was born in Vercelli, Piedmont, in 1477. His first master was the \\"archaic\\" Martino Spanzotti;A minor painter, called \\"archaic\\" by Freedberg 1993:117, of whom one signed picture is known. he also appears to have been a student of the painter Giovenone. After acquiring the strong colouring and other distinctive stylistic features of the Lombard school and ‚Äì though he is not known to have travelled to MilanMorelli, in his Italian Pictures in German Galleries said that he ripened into an artist only during two years (1498‚Äì1500) that he spent with Leonardo in Milan. ‚Äì somehow absorbing the superficial mannerisms of Leonardo (Freedberg 1993:117), he travelled to Siena before 1503, perhaps at the behest of agents of the Spannocchi family, and began with fresco cycles for Olivetan monks and a series of small Ovidian ceiling panels and a frieze depicting the career of Julius Caesar for Sigismondo Chigi at Palazzo Chigi. . Sigismondo was the guarantor of Sodoma's performance for Julius, October 1508, and his brother Agostino became Sodoma's notable patron. Colander through Prayer (—Å. 1502), Chiostro Grande, Abbazia territoriale di Monte Oliveto Maggiore Along with Pinturicchio, Sodoma was one of the first to practice in Siena the style of the High Renaissance. His first important works were frescoes in the Benedictine monastery of Monte Oliveto Maggiore, on the road from Siena to Rome, illustrating the life of St Benedict in continuation of the series that Luca Signorelli had begun in 1498. Gaining fluency in the prevailing popular style of Pinturicchio, Sodoma completed the set in 1502 and included a self- portrait with badgers and ravens. Sodoma was invited to Rome in 1508 by the celebrated Sienese merchant Agostino Chigi and was employed there by Pope Julius II in the Stanza della Segnatura in the Vatican. He executed two great compositions and various ornaments and grotesques in vaulted ceilings divided in feigned compartments in the antique manner that Pinturicchio had recently revived, working at the same time as Raphael. Vasari's rhetorical story that Sodoma's larger works did not satisfy the pope, who engaged Raphael to substitute a program of Justice, Poetry, and Theology is not borne out by the documents.Recent cleaning revealed the essential intergrity of Sodoma's existing ceilings, illustrated by Bartalini 2001. Before October 1510 he was in Siena, where he painted the exterior of Palazzo Chigi in monochrome chiaroscuro with scenes from the Bible and from Antiquity, the first such work seen in Siena (Bartalini 2001:553). His painting at this time began to show distinct Florentine influences,Freedberg (1993:117) notes the source of his Crucifixion (Pinacoteca, Siena) in the composition of an altar for Santissima Annunziata, Florence, begun by Filippino Lippi and finished by Perugino. especially of Fra Bartolommeo. Detail from Roxanne Receiving Her Husband's Crown Called again to Rome by Chigi, in the Villa Chigi (now the Villa Farnesina), working alongside Baldassarre Peruzzi, Sodoma painted subjects from the life of Alexander the Great: Alexander in the Tent of Darius and the Nuptials of the Conqueror with Roxanne, which some people consider his masterpiece. When Leo X became pope (1513), Sodoma presented him with a picture of the Death of Lucretia (or of Cleopatra, according to some accounts). Leo gave him a large sum of money as a reward and created him a cavaliere. In his youth, Bazzi had married, but he and his wife soon separated. A daughter married Bartolomeo Neroni, called also Riccio Sanese or Maestro Riccio, one of his principal pupils. Bazzi acquired his nickname of Il Sodoma, as it were \\"the sodomite\\", from as early as 1512. This appears to have been one among various nicknames, he was also known as Mattaccio or Matazo (\\"the madman\\") among the monks of Monte Oliveto. Robert H. Hobart Cust, Giovanni Antonio Bazzi hitherto usually styled ‚ÄòSodoma‚Äô, The man and the painter 1477‚Äì1549 (1906), 65. It is due to the contemporary art historian Giorgio Vasari that Bazzi's nickname of Il Sodoma has become conventional. According to Vasari's testimony, Bazzi always surrounded himself with \\"boys and beardless youths, whom he loved more than was decent\\", for which reason he acquired the nickname Il Soddoma. Still according to Vasari, Bazzi took pride in the nickname and composed stanzas and songs about it.. Giorgio Vasari, Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects, trans.

Adrienne DeAngelis: \\"since he always had about him boys and beardless youths, whom he loved more than was decent, he acquired the by-name of Sodoma; and in this name, far from taking umbrage or offence, he used to glory, writing about it songs and verses in terza rima, and singing them to the lute with no little facility.\\") See also: Jeanne Morgan Zarucchi, \\"Vasari‚Äôs Biography of Bazzi as ‚ÄòSoddoma‚Äô: Art History and Literary Analysis\\", Italian Studies 70.2 (2015), . Bazzi returned to Siena and, at a later date, sought work in Pisa, Volterra, and Lucca. From Lucca he returned to Siena not long before his death on 14 February 1549 (older narratives say 1554). He had supposedly squandered his property and is said, without documentary support, to have died in penury in the great hospital of Siena. One of his pupils is known as Giomo del Sodoma. Work Holy Family with young Saint John St. Sebastian (1525). Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence Some critics see in Sodoma's Madonna in the Pinacoteca di Brera (if it really is by him) the direct influence of this master. Modern criticism tends not to follow Morelli in supposing that Raphael painted Sodoma's portrait next to himself in The School of Athens,The face looks too old, apart from anything else; Perugino or Timoteo Viti are considered more likely models while a drawing at Christ Church is supposed to be a portrait of Raphael by Sodoma. Among his masterpieces are the frescoes, completed in 1526, in the chapel of St. Catherine of Siena painted for the church of San Domenico (Siena), depicting the saint in ecstasy, fainting as she receives the Eucharist from an angel. In the Oratory of San Bernardino, are scenes from the history of the Virgin, painted in conjunction with Pacchia and Beccafumi (1536‚Äì1538). These frescoes depict the Visitation and the Assumption. In San Francesco are the Deposition from the Cross (1513) and Christ Scourged. Many critics regard one or the other of these paintings as Sodoma's masterpiece. In the choir of the Pisa Cathedral is the Sacrifice of Abraham, and in the Uffizi Gallery of Florence a St. Sebastian. Some of his works, including the Holy Family now in the Pinacoteca, Siena have been mistaken for works of Leonardo da Vinci. His easel pictures are rare; there are two in the National Gallery, London.

According to Vasari, the name by which Bazzi was known was \\"Il Mattaccio\\" (the Madcap, the Maniac), this epithet having been bestowed upon him by the monks of Monte Oliveto. He dressed gaudily, like a mountebank, and his house was a Noah's ark, owing to the strange miscellany of animals he kept there. He was a cracker of jokes and fond of music, and he sang poems composed by himself on indecorous subjects. Vasari alleges that Sodoma was always a negligent artist, his early success in Siena, where he painted many portraits, being partly due to lack of competition, a judgment in which Sidney Freedberg concurs. Vasari asserts that as he aged, he became too \\"lazy\\" to make cartoons for his frescoes but daubed them straight onto the wall. Vasari nevertheless admits that Sodoma produced some works of very fine quality and that during his lifetime his reputation was high.

He was also the 27th Mayor of Buffalo, serving from 1862 until 1866 during the U.S. Civil War. Early life William George Fargo was born in Pompey in Onondaga County, New York on May 20, 1818. He was the eldest of twelve children of William C. Fargo (1791‚Äì1878) (formerly of New London, Connecticut) and Stacy Chappel Strong (1799‚Äì1869). His younger brother was James Congdell Strong Fargo (1829‚Äì1915), president of the American Express Company for 30 years. William's education consisted only of the rudiments taught in a country school as he left school at the age of 13 to carry the mail in Pompey and help support his family. His father, who was born in New London, Connecticut, fought in the War of 1812. The elder Fargo was stationed at Fort Niagara and fought in the battle of Queenston Heights under General Van Rensselaer that resulted in the death of British General Isaac Brock. Fargo was wounded in right thigh, just before the Americans took possession of the ground. His grandfather was William Beebe Fargo (1757‚Äì1801), who served with distinction in the Revolutionary War, the son of William Fargo (1726‚Äì1813). His great- grandfather was the son of Moses Fargo (1691‚Äì1798) and the grandson of Moses Fargo (1648‚Äì1742), who was born in Lyons, France. His father Jacent Fargeau, had emigrated with his wife and children to Wales, from where Moses and his elder brother Aaron went to Norfolk, Connecticut in 1670. Career At the age of 13, Fargo left school and started carrying mail for his native village of Pompey, New York. In the winter of 1838, Fargo started working with Hough & Gilchrist, grocers, from Syracuse. He remained there for a year until he went to work with the grocers Roswell and Willett Hinman. After three years, Fargo obtained a clerkship in the forwarding house of Dunford & Co., Syracuse. In 1841, he became a freight agent, an express messenger between Albany and Buffalo, for the Auburn and Syracuse Railroad in Auburn. A year later in 1843, Fargo was a Resident Agent in Buffalo, New York. He left the Auburn and Syracuse Railroad and joined Livingston, Wells & Co., as messenger. American Express Company Share of the American Express Company, issued 13. October 1865; signed by William G. Fargo as Secretary and Henry Wells as President William G. Fargo in 1865On April 1, 1845, along with Henry Wells and Daniel Dunning, Fargo organized the Western Express which ran from Buffalo to Cincinnati, St. Louis, Chicago and intermediate points, under the name of Wells & Co. At that time, there were no railroad facilities west of Buffalo, and Fargo, who had charge of the business, made use of steamboats and wagons. In 1845, Daniel Dunning withdrew from the company and in 1846, Henry Wells sold out his interest in this concern to William A. Livingston, who became Fargo's partner in Livingston, Fargo & Company. In 1850, three competing express companies: Wells & Company (Henry Wells), Livingston, Fargo & Company (Fargo and William A. Livingston), and Wells, Butterfield & Company, the successor earlier in 1850 of Butterfield, Wasson & Company (John Warren Butterfield), were consolidated and became the American Express Company, with Wells as President and Fargo as Secretary. In 1866, upon the resignation of Henry Wells and American Express' merger with the Merchants Union Express Company, Fargo was elected President of the American Express Company. He was the company's president until his death in 1881, at which point his brother, J. C. Fargo, assumed the presidency, holding the post until 1914. Wells Fargo & Company In 1852, Henry Wells and Fargo created Wells Fargo & Co. when Butterfield (and other directors of American Express) objected to the extension of its operations to California. The original Wells Fargo & Co. was created to facilitate an express business between New York and San Francisco by way of the Isthmus of Panama and on the Pacific coast. The new company offered banking services, which included buying gold and selling paper bank drafts, and express services, which included rapid delivery of gold and anything else valuable. The company opened for business in the gold rush city of San Francisco, and soon the Company's agents opened offices in the other new cities and mining camps in the West. In 1861, Wells Fargo & Company bought and reorganized the Overland Mail Co., which had been formed in 1857 to carry the United States mail, and of which Fargo had been one of the original promoters. Other Fargo was a director and vice-president of New York Central Railroad Company, a director and shareholder of the Northern Pacific Railway, a director of the Buffalo, New York and Philadelphia Railroad Company, and a shareholder in the Buffalo Coal Company and the McKean and Buffalo Railroad Company. He was also a stockholder in several large manufacturing establishments in Buffalo. Political career In 1861, he was elected mayor of Buffalo, serving from 1862 to 1866, as he was elected to a second term in 1863. During his term as mayor, the Buffalo riot of 1862 took place. Fargo was a lifelong Democrat and stood against secession. He supported the Union during the Civil War by paying a part of the salary of his employees that were drafted. Personal life Wiliam G. Fargo Mansion in Buffalo, New YorkIn January 1840, Fargo married Anna H. Williams (1820‚Äì1890), daughter of Nathan Williams, one of the proprietors of Pompey, with whom he had eight children: *Georgia Fargo (1841‚Äì1892), who died unmarried *Alma Cornelia Fargo (1842‚Äì1842), who died young *Sarah Irene Fargo (1843‚Äì1854) *William George Fargo, Jr. (1845‚Äì1872), who married Minerva Elizabeth Prendergast (1848‚Äì1873) *Hannah Sophia Fargo (1847‚Äì1851), who died young *Mary Louise Fargo (1851‚Äì1852), who died young *Helen Lacy Fargo (1857‚Äì1886), who married Herbert G. Squiers (1859‚Äì1911), a diplomat who served as Minister to Cuba (1902‚Äì1905) and Panama (1906‚Äì1909) *Edwin Morgan Fargo (1861‚Äì1865), who died young William G. Fargo Mansion as it appeared in 1900 before it was demolished In 1868, when he was 50, Fargo bought on the Buffalo's west side and between 1868‚Äì1872, he built the Fargo Mansion at Jersey and Fargo Streets, which was Buffalo's largest mansion. The home was completed in 1872 at a cost of $600,000 (). Another $100,000 () was spent to furnish and decorate the mansion. Michael Rizzo, a Buffalo historian, wrote: He died on August 3, 1881 after battling an illness for several months. After his funeral on August 7, 1881, he was buried at Forest Lawn Cemetery. At the time of his death, only two of his children were living, Georgia and Helen Fargo. William's brother, J.C. Fargo, succeeded him as President of American Express after his death. Legacy Fargo's wife Anna died in 1890 and their two surviving children lived elsewhere so the Fargo Mansion stood vacant for 10 years. It was deemed too expensive to maintain and with no buyer, the mansion was demolished and the block cut into residential lots in 1901. The mansion and estate grounds were only 30 years old. Fargo Avenue in Buffalo; the Fargo Quadrangle at the University at Buffalo; and Fargo, North Dakota are named after him. The Fargo Estate Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. See also * American Express * Wells Fargo * J.C.

Job duties Admin assistants perform clerical duties in nearly every industry. Some administrative assistants, like those in the legal industry, may be more specialized than others. Most administrative assistant duties revolve around managing and distributing information within an office. This generally includes answering phones, taking memos and maintaining files. Administrative assistants may also be in charge of sending and receiving correspondence, as well as greeting clients and customers. Bookkeeping Admin assistants in some offices may be charged with monitoring and recording expenditures. Duties may range from creating spreadsheets to reporting expenses to an office manager. As such, some administrative assistants may be required to be knowledgeable in office bookkeeping software, such as Microsoft Excel. Planning and scheduling Planning events like board meetings and luncheons may also be the responsibility of admin assistants. This may require researching vendor prices or inquiring about participants' availability. Other duties may include scheduling appointments and preparing presentation materials. Documentation Admin assistants may also help office members with documentation. Aside from storing, organizing and managing files, assistants may need to type, edit and proofread documents. Some assistants may need to take dictation or record the minutes of meetings. Specialized job duties Administrative assistants in some fields may be required to have extensive professional knowledge. Accordingly, duties for these assistants may be more specialized. For example, legal administrative assistants may need to have a thorough understanding of legal terminology and procedures, while medical assistants may need to be well versed in dealing with insurance companies and reading medical reports. In this perspective they are also referred as the Administrative Support Specialists.

He is the main character of the novels The Caves of Steel, The Naked Sun and The Robots of Dawn, and of the short story \\"Mirror Image.\\" He is seen in flashbacks several times and talked about frequently in Robots and Empire, which is set roughly 160 years after his death. He is further mentioned in passing in \\"Foundation and Earth\\" as a \\"Culture Hero\\". Besides Asimov's works he appears in the Foundation's Friends story \\"Strip-Runner\\" by Pamela Sargent, and \\"Isaac Asimov's 'The Caves Of Steel'\\" poem by Randall Garrett.\\"Takeoff!\\" a book by Randall Garrett. Biography He is a plainclothesman, a homicide detective in the New York City Police Department 3,000 years in the future. He is a doleful character with a quick temper. Like Sherlock Holmes, he is a pipe-smoker ‚Äì a habit he fights against in The Robots of Dawn. He has a strong sense of duty and loyalty and is very protective of his family and his status. His wife, Jezebel Baley, prefers to be called Jessie. Their son, Bentley, became a leader in the second wave of interplanetary space exploration. Baley, like most earth-born human beings of his century, is strongly agoraphobic, as The Caves of Steel reveals that most natives of Earth live their entire lives in immense domed cities (\\"caves of steel\\") and rarely, if ever, travel to the outside surface. Baley's agoraphobia is an important personality characteristic and plot point in several of the novels in which he appears. In the later stories he has limited success in overcoming his agoraphobia, which he recognizes as a potential limitation to his species and more directly his son. (Baley's agoraphobia mirrors Asimov's own personality, who was a well known claustrophile.) Asimov's novels are typically devoid of profanity. Consequently, Baley's favourite expletive is \\"Jehoshaphat!\\" which he says in times of great stress or excitement. In The Caves of Steel, he is called upon to help solve the murder of a Spacer. The Spacers assign him a robot partner, R. Daneel Olivaw, who becomes his lifelong friend. He meets up with R. Daneel again in The Naked Sun, where again he is asked to investigate the murder of a Spacer, this time on the planet Solaria, making him the first Earthman to leave Earth since the first wave of colonization. Later, in the Robots of Dawn, while investigating another murder on behalf of the Spacers he recognizes R. Giskard's telepathic abilities long before anyone else does. Giskard modifies Baley's mind to prevent him from being able to tell anyone. While off Earth he develops a somewhat romantic and sexual relation with Gladia, a Spacer woman who, prompted by meeting him, becomes the first Solarian in centuries to willingly leave Solaria and the last to do so. In \\"Robots and Empire\\" he is seen in a number of flashbacks, in particular over the course of the novel, Giskard, Gladia and finally Daneel all recall the last time they ever met him. Daneel's memory is notable as it covers an extremely elderly Baley bestowing his last words upon Daneel and reveals he perished mere moments after Daneel left his presence (at Baley's request, to prevent the sight of his death from distressing the Three Laws-compliant Daneel). His words have a profound impact on Daneel's behavior even many thousands of years on. Some details of Baley's life lack continuity throughout the Robot novels. In The Caves of Steel, for example, it is noted that Baley's mother died shortly after his father was declassified (lost his civil classification and therefore all social and economic status), and that Baley did not remember her. However, in The Robots of Dawn, Baley recalls his mother cajoling him to eat her chicken soup and telling him that even the Spacers did not have anything as good. In The Caves of Steel, Baley is also reported to have a sister, but she is never referred to again. In the same way, Baley's intense shame at his father's declassification and the resulting deprivations of his childhood are not referred to in succeeding novels. In later stories, it is revealed that Baley becomes a legendary hero for millennia. References to him can be found in Prelude to Foundation and Foundation and Earth. List of Appearances Novels: *The Caves of Steel (1953) *The Naked Sun (1955) *The Robots of Dawn (1983) *Robots and Empire (1985) (Baley only appears via flashbacks as he is deceased in the timeline of the main plot, although he still plays an important part in the story.)

According to its own statements, the group \\"exists in order to defend and develop an anti-imperialist trend within Britain, based on the long term interests of the entire working class and the oppressed internationally. We stand for the creation of a society organised both to meet the needs of the entire population, and to ensure the fullest possible development of every individual.\\"Revolutionary Communist Group. Emphasising a campaign against capitalism and the oppression of the working class, the group is also highly critical of British foreign policy, which they consider to be imperialistic in nature. In particular, they criticise British control of Northern Ireland and the Falkland Islands, the involvement of British troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the British government's support for Israel. Believing that the British electoral system under capitalism cannot bring about any real change in society, and as it does not consider itself a party (believing that a communist party, led by a vanguard of the proletariat, has not yet developed in Britain), the RCG has not taken part in elections since 1979. The group also publish their own newspaper, Fight Racism! Fight Imperialism!, which has been running since November‚ÄìDecember 1979 and now appears every two months.  Political ideology =Marxist position The Revolutionary Communist Group is a communist organisation. It believes that the United Kingdom is a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie (i.e., a state where the ruling capitalist class control the economic and political powers to the detriment of the working class, in this case through a representative democracy), and believe that the only real way to enact social change is for the working class to take power in a revolution, thereby establishing a dictatorship of the proletariat (i.e., a state ruled through participatory democracy by the working class for the benefit of the masses). Writing in 2007, the British Trotskyist group Permanent Revolution characterised the RCG's position as being \\"distinctive on the British left by their open espousal of left Stalinism, which essentially consists of an uncritical support for the leadership of anti-imperialist struggles, an uncritical support for the Cuban regime, a completely undemocratic internal structure, an active participation in anti-racist struggles and complete rejection of any united front work within the British labour movement, trade unions or Labour Party.\\"Permanent Revolution 2007.

Criticism of British imperialism  The RCG believes that the United Kingdom has been an imperialist power since the end of the nineteenth century, stating that \\"Britain is the oldest imperialist country in the world. It was the first to develop into finance monopoly capitalism ‚Äì imperialism, and is still a major imperialist power, second only to the United States. Britain's imperialist character has been decisive in determining British economic, social and political developments.\\" In this way they believe that the British state has interfered in foreign affairs, historically through the British Empire and continuing through foreign wars and corporate dominance, to the detriment to the working class masses living in these countries. The group supports revolutionary national democratic governments in various Third and Second World countries such as the Bolivarian government of Hugo Ch√°vez in Venezuela, and the government of Evo Morales in Bolivia. It supports socialist Cuba and the socialist government of Cuba. The RCG believes that such movements in alliance with Cuba have the ability to radically help the working class masses living in these nations, and fight against the imperialism of the United Kingdom, United States and other First World states who use them for cheap labour. As they make clear on their website, \\"The resistance movements in the oppressed nations are weakening imperialism; an anti-imperialist movement in this country in unity with these struggles can deal a decisive blow against British imperialism and the British ruling class. For this reason the RCG has always given complete and unconditional support to liberation movements fighting imperialism and we support their right to carry out their struggles by any means necessary.\\" The RCG argues that socialists should not give their support to the centre/centre-left Labour Party, which is one of the major political parties in the United Kingdom. On this subject, David Yaffe stated the RCG's position that \\"no anti-imperialist or socialist movement can be built unless the British left makes a fundamental and irrevocable break with the British Labour Party.\\" He went on to characterise the party's policies in government as being \\"openly racist, imperialist and warmongering\\".Yaffe 2004-2005. At the same time it has remained critical of other socialist organisations in Britain such as the Communist Party of Great Britain, Militant, the International Marxist Group and the Socialist Workers Party for what it sees as being \\"major obstacle[s]\\" to the building of an anti- imperialist movement in Britain. This is because many of these groups denounced the governments of socialist states such as the Soviet Union, China and Cuba, and instead encouraged their members to vote for the Labour Party.  Criticism of racism, immigration controls and discrimination  The RCG has been firmly critical of racism and particularly the racism of the British government and state. It has supported groups of black nationalists in the United States in their attempt to defend themselves from racist attacks. It also opposes any constraints on immigration, believing that any constraints on immigration are inherently racist in an imperialist country. It also criticises all other forms of discrimination in society, stating that \\"We oppose all discrimination against anyone on grounds of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation and disability.\\" History=Early years: 1970-1976 Developing in the early 1970s, the RCG grew out of the \\"Revolutionary Opposition\\" faction of the International Socialists (IS), (forerunners of the Socialist Workers Party), being strongly influenced by the politics of Roy Tearse. When the leading figures of the \\"Revolutionary Opposition\\", the name itself only first appearing in print in their appeal document, were expelled from the IS its members met to decide on their course of action, and disagreements between Tearse's allies and the majority of the faction around David Yaffe rapidly surfaced. The result was that Tearse's supporters formed the Discussion Group which led a quiet life for a number of years inside the Labour Party before dissolving. Meanwhile, Yaffe and his comrades proceeded to found the Revolutionary Communist Group in 1974.Revolutionary Communist No 1 October 1974 p14 In 1975 the RCG began publishing a theoretical journal called Revolutionary Communist in which it in part espoused a view of crisis theory, a theme they had already addressed in the IS when challenging the work of the theoreticians of that group.Revolutionary Communist They developed Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and Vladimir Lenin's analysis of the labour aristocracy, and showed its relevance for politics in the period after the Second World War. Their conclusions led them to call for no vote for the Labour Party. The early years of the RCG saw the group lose a large part of its initial membership. For example, in September 1975 the Birmingham branch decamped in order to join the Workers' Socialist League. A few years after the RCG's foundation, disagreements emerged amongst its members regarding such topics as Stalinism and the South African government. One group, dominated by Frank Furedi (1947-), a sociologist at the University of Kent who used the pseudonym of \\"Frank Richards\\", began to argue against the views put forward by David Yaffe and his supporters. Yaffe himself later remarked that Furedi had been \\"organising among a clique of middle-class members, and became their self- styled guru\\".Beckett 1999. In November 1976, Furedi and his followers were expelled from the RCG, following which they went on to form their own rival organisation, the Revolutionary Communist Tendency (RCT). Soon, the RCT itself splintered, with a group calling itself the Committee for a Communist Programme (CPP) being founded by several dissenting members.Leversha 1978. p. 26. Following this, the RCT went on to change its name to the Revolutionary Communist Party in 1981, and would publish the magazine Living Marxism from 1988 to 2000, in which their political position moved from Leninism to Libertarian Marxism. The RCG recognised the progressive role played by some of the traditional communist parties such as the South African Communist Party and from that position developed into a more orthodox communist grouping supporting the socialist revolution in Cuba. Whilst many self-proclaimed socialist organisations, especially those regarding themselves as Trotskyist, in the UK welcomed the demise of the Eastern Bloc and then of the Soviet Union the RCG argued that these events were counterrevolutionary and constituted a setback in the class struggle internationally because many national liberation movements and socialist states in the Third World were supported by the Soviet Union and the Comecon. The RCG believed that while the Soviet Union was a socialist state, as a result of both internal developments in the Soviet Union itself and the reactionary role of working class parties (social democratic and communist) in the imperialist countries, the revolution degenerated and the communist party became an elite party separate from the working class. These developments laid the foundation for the counterrevolution between 1989-91. Solidarity with Ireland and South Africa: 1977-1989 During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the RCG became heavily involved in support for the Irish national liberation struggle, working with the Prisoners Aid Committee, Sinn F√©in and the Troops Out Movement (TOM), and focusing particularly on support for Irish republican prisoners held in British prisons. The analysis which the RCG developed through this work, on the role of national liberation movements in opposing imperialism, laid the foundations for much of its later positions, and its relationship to the rest of the British left. Unlike many other left organisations, the RCG consistently argued that British troops had no progressive role to play in Ireland, and called for total support for the Republican movement in the struggle against British imperialism. Their involvement with the prisoner support groups established a tradition of outspoken support for prison struggles which has continued to the present, with a page of every issue of their newspaper dealing with prison conditions and struggles. In 1990, when prisoners at Strangeways (see 1990 Strangeways Prison riot) took over the prison in protest at conditions, the RCG was active together with other groups supporting them on the outside, and later published a book, 'Strangeways: A Serious Disturbance', largely written by prisoners and former prisoners. During the 1980s, the RCG's most notable activity was its participation in the non-stop picket of the South African embassy in London calling for the release of Nelson Mandela. This was organized by the City of London Anti-Apartheid Group, within which the RCG played a leading role alongside elements of the Workers' Revolutionary Party, the Humanist Party and members of the Kitson family. City AA, as it became known, had been founded by Norma Kitson, the wife of the South African Communist activist David Kitson who served 19 years and 5 months in prison in a South African prison for his work in the National High Command of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), the military wing of the African National Congress. City AA was eventually expelled by the national leadership of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, over differences centering on City Group's insistence on making the link between British support for apartheid in South Africa, and racism within Britain. Another significant campaign during the 1980s was the Viraj Mendis Defence Campaign, against the deportation of one of the group's members to Sri Lanka. This developed into a high-profile national campaign involving people from left-wing groups such as the RCG, local residents of Manchester, and extending to church leaders and Labour Party Members of Parliament.  Solidarity with Cuba and Palestine: 1990-present  In 1995 the RCG set up Rock Around the Blockade (RATB), a solidarity organisation with the Cuban Revolution. As well as campaigning on issues such as the US economic blockade and the Cuban Five, and sending political solidarity brigades to Cuba, RATB raised funds to take sound systems out to Cuba. These were used with young people in cultural and political work, and the RATB has donated five sound systems over a ten-year period. In 2001 three members were asked to leave or resign because of what were described as their reactionary ultra-left views. One example of the division was over the September 11th attacks in 2001, which the three people who left viewed as a victory against imperialism. They had previously alleged that the leadership was bureaucratic and failing to train the membership in Marxism-Leninism. The three left to form Communist Forum, often known by the name of their newsletter, Fightback. They have ceased to be active. Following the start of the Palestinian second intifada in September 2000, in October the RCG joined a group which had begun to picket Marks and Spencer in Manchester over their support for Israel, and helped to spread this to other cities. Over the next six years pickets of Marks and Spencer were held in places including Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, Newcastle, Stockton, Middlesbrough, Durham, Rochdale, Nottingham, Leicester, across London, Stratford and Brighton. Throughout this period the flagship store on Oxford Street in London was picketed weekly, and in many other places pickets were sustained on a regular basis. In 2005 and 2006, the RCG stepped up their work in solidarity with asylum seekers, supporting the setting up of UNITY, an asylum seekers' union, in Glasgow, and helping to establish Tyneside Community Action for Refugees (TCAR) in Newcastle and Gateshead and the North West Asylum Seekers Defence Group (NWASDG) in Manchester (for a selection of reports from this period see 1, 2). Opposition to government spending cuts In October 2010 the Conservative- Liberal Democrat coalition government announced cuts in state spending of ¬£81bn, ¬£11bn greater than the ¬£70bn cuts which the preceding Labour government had said in autumn 2009 were necessary. There would be cuts in state benefits, central government departments and a 26% reduction in central government funding for local government. In its newspaper, the RCG said the ruling class \\"has declared class war.\\".FRFI 218, December 2010/January 2011 The RCG adopted a slogan \\"No cuts ‚Äì full stop!\\" It condemned Labour-run councils implementing the cuts. It described Labour councillors voting for such cuts as \\"class enemies\\", opposing any alliance with them against the coalition government. It criticised those on the left who sought unity at any price with such politicians.FRFI 219, February/March 2011 As a part of the government cuts, the coalition announced plans to simultaneously cut much university funding and dramatically increase the tuition fees charged to students. This move led to widespread student protests taking place in November and December 2010, during which demonstrators occupied the central Jeremy Bentham Room in University College London (UCL) for several weeks. The protesting UCL students (some of whom were RCG members or supporters) organised a panel discussion to be held during which representatives from several leftist organisations (including the RCG's David Yaffe as well as figures from the Green Party of England and Wales, Socialist Appeal and Workers Power) discussed the reforms then being made by the government and university authorities to higher education in Britain.Revolutionary Communist Group 2010. Allegation of sexual harassment (2017) In October 2017 the RCG posted on their website \\"The Revolutionary Communist Group is aware of a historic allegation of sexual harassment by a member of the organisation. The RCG views such allegations with utmost seriousness. The comrade involved has been suspended from membership and will remain suspended until an internal enquiry completes an investigation into the matter and reports with recommendations on further action\\".http://www.revolutionarycommunist.org/9-uncategorised/5056-our-311217 At the end of that year in December, the RCG updated on their website \\"Following an investigation and a period of suspension, the comrade has been reinstated as of 1 January 2018. The comrade understands that his actions were unacceptable for a communist and a member of the RCG. Through the process we have undertaken, his consciousness and behaviour has changed, and continues to change to the extent that we have decided he can now be readmitted as a full member. The RCG takes seriously the sexism, discrimination and exploitation women face and is committed to building an organisation that opposes all such oppression.\\"  Fight Racism! Fight Imperialism! newspaper  The April/May 2011 issue of FRFI, with a headline commenting critically on the 2011 military intervention in Libya. The newspaper of the Revolutionary Communist Group, Fight Racism! Fight Imperialism! (FRFI) commemorated 25 years of publication with issue Number 182 December 2004/January 2005. The paper is still published every two months. Commenting on the reason for the paper's title, David Yaffe has stated that it was chosen because it was in \\"itself a political statement. It declares that fighting racism and imperialism must be at the heart of any socialist movement in imperialist Britain.\\" References=FootnotesBibliography ;News, articles and reports  ;Websites and e-publications   External links  * Revolutionary Communist Group Category:Communist parties in the United Kingdom Category:1974 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Political parties established in 1974 Category:Far-left political parties Category:Anti-austerity political parties in the United Kingdom ","title":"Revolutionary Communist Group (UK)"},{"id":"457394","title":"Franz Klammer"},{"id":"457395","text":"Tiddlywinks is a game played on a flat felt mat with sets of small discs called \\"winks\\", a pot, which is the target, and a collection of squidgers, which are also discs. Players use a \\"squidger\\" (nowadays made of plastic) to shoot a wink into flight by flicking the squidger across the top of a wink and then over its edge, thereby propelling it into the air. The offensive objective of the game is to score points by sending your own winks into the pot. The defensive objective of the game is to prevent your opponents from potting their winks by \\"squopping\\" them: shooting your own winks to land on top of your opponents' winks. As part of strategic gameplay, players often attempt to squop their opponents' winks and develop, maintain and break up large piles of winks. Tiddlywinks is sometimes considered a simple-minded, frivolous children's game, rather than a strategic, adult game. (of the UK Olympic Committee) However, the modern competitive adult game of tiddlywinks made a strong comeback at the University of Cambridge in 1955. The modern game uses far more complex rules and a consistent set of high-grade equipment.  Rules  The French (\\"flea game\\"), a catapult version of tiddlywinks Tiddlywinks is a competitive game involving four colours of winks. Each player controls the winks of a colour, the colours being blue, green, red and yellow. Red and blue are always partners against green and yellow. There are six winks of each colour, which begin the game in the corners of a felt mat measuring 6 feet by 3 feet. This mat is ordinarily placed on a table, and a pot is placed at its centre. There are two primary methods of play with the four colors of winks: a pairs game, and a singles game. The pairs game involves four players, playing in partnerships, with each winker playing a single color. The singles game involves a single winker playing against another single winker, each playing two colors of winks in alternation. The players take turns, and there are two basic aims: to cover (or squop) opponent winks, and to get one's own winks into the pot. As in pool or snooker, if a player pots a wink of his own colour, then he is entitled to an extra shot, and this enables a skilled player to pot all of his winks in one turn. The point of squopping, which is the key element distinguishing the adult game from the child's game (though recognized in even the earliest rules from 1890), is that a wink that is covered (even partially) may not be played by its owner. The wink on top may be played, though, and sophisticated play involves shots manipulating large piles of winks. The game ends in one of two ways: either all the winks of one colour are potted (a pot-out), or play continues up to a specified time limit (usually 25 minutes), after which each colour has a further five turns. Then a scoring system is used to rank the players, based on the numbers of potted and unsquopped winks of each colour.  National and international organisations  A European wooden mushroom-style container with nylon tiddlywinks discs (1960s) There are two national associations, the English Tiddlywinks Association (ETwA) and the North American Tiddlywinks Association (NATwA) (the Scottish Tiddlywinks Association having disbanded in the late 1990s). These organisations are responsible for conducting tournaments and maintaining the rules of the game (which actually differ only slightly between the two organisations; the NATwA rules are based on the ETwA rules). International competition is overseen by the International Federation of Tiddlywinks Associations (IFTwA), though in practice it is rarely called upon to intervene.  Competitive play  Although tiddlywinks nowadays is a singles or pairs game, competition in the 1950s until the 2000s centred on team competition, with teams consisting of several (two to four) pairs. There were a number of university teams, and international matches were also played. More recently, singles and pairs tournaments have come to be the focus of competitive tiddlywinks, with only a few team matches being played each year. The four most prestigious tournaments are the National Singles and National Pairs tournaments held in England and the United States. The World Singles and World Pairs championships operate on a challenge basis; anyone winning a national tournament (or being the highest-placed home player behind a foreign winner) is entitled to challenge the current champion. There are several other less prestigious tournaments in England and the United States throughout the year, often with a format designed to encourage inexperienced players. The results of tournaments and world championship matches are used to calculate Tiddlywinks Ratings, which give a ranking of players.  Skill versus strategy, and comparable games  The important appeal of the game for many players is the required combination of manual dexterity and strategic thought as well as tactics. Tiddlywinkers often claim that the game combines physical skill (such as in snooker or golf) with the strategy of chess. Tiddlywinks is unique in the combination of skill and strategy it requires. Strategy in tiddlywinks is often rather deep, since winks can be captured. Strategic and tactical planning involves anticipating opponents' moves rather than just building a sequence of one's own moves. Another factor that complicates the game is that there is a time limit to the play of the game; it does not merely run until some objective in the game has been met. All in all, tiddlywinks goes beyond the purely cerebral nature of a game such as chess. The fact that shots can be made or missed, together with the continuum of possible outcomes, makes strategy much less rigid than in chess, and prevents planning more than seven or eight shots in advance.  Equipment  The winks and pot used in competitive play are standard, and are supplied by the English Tiddlywinks Association. The pots are made of moulded plastic (historically always red, though there is no known reason for this), with specified diameters at the top and the base, and specified height. The winks are made in Italy to specified measurements, and are made by slicing an extruded cylinder rather than by moulding, and then smoothing them in a tumbler. Although this leads to some minor variation in thickness, it produces a much smoother edge to the wink than that seen on cheap moulded winks. The mats are made of thick felt. Mats obtained from different suppliers have different characteristics, and part of the skill of a tournament player is to adjust to different mats. Squidgers are custom-made by their owners or purchased from squidger makers. A player may use as many as he likes, selecting an appropriate squidger for each shot. Top players may carry up to twenty different squidgers, but will not typically use all of them in one game. The rules governing squidgers are liberal; a range of dimensions are permitted, and the material is not specified, except for the condition that squidgers must not damage either the winks or the mat. Typically squidgers are made from different types of plastic, though glass, rubber, cork and onyx are occasionally seen. The squidgers are usually filed or sanded to give a sharp edge and then polished.  Terminology  The game of tiddlywinks has a rich lexicon. Selected terms include: Appendix devoted to tiddlywinks jargon. Blitz: an attempt to pot all six winks of a given player's colour early in the game Bomb: to send a wink at a pile, usually from distance, in the hope of significantly disturbing it Boondock: to free a squopped wink by sending it a long way away, leaving the squopping wink free in the battle area Bristol: a shot which moves a pile of two or more winks as a single unit; the shot is played by holding the squidger at a right angle to its normal plane Carnovsky (US)/Penhaligon (UK): potting a wink from the baseline (i.e., from 3 feet away) Cracker (UK): a simultaneous knock-off and squop, i.e. a shot which knocks one wink off the top of another while simultaneously squopping it Crud (UK): a forceful shot whose purpose is to destroy a pile completely Good shot: named after John Good. The shot consists of playing a flat wink (one not involved in a pile) through a nearby pile with the intent of destroying the pile Gromp: an attempt to jump a pile onto another wink (usually with the squidger held in a conventional rather than a Bristol fashion) John Lennon memorial shot: a simultaneous boondock and squop Lunch: to pot a squopped wink (usually belonging to an opponent) Scrunge (UK): to bounce out of the pot Squidger: the disc used to shoot a winkEntry for squidger, n. Squop: to play a wink so that it comes to rest above another winkEntries for squop, v. and squop, n. Sub: to play a wink so that it (unintentionally) ends up under another wink Tiddlies: points calculated when determining the finishing placement of winkers in a tiddlywinks game  History =Nineteenth century Tiddley Winks by William Somerville Shanks (1897) The game began as an adult parlour game in Victorian England. Bank clerk Joseph Assheton Fincher (1863‚Äì1900)Joseph Assheton Fincher birth registration, General Register Office, England.Joseph Assheton Fincher death registration, General Register Office, England. filed the original patent application for the game in 1888 UK patent # 16,215 (1888). and applied for the trademark Tiddledy-Winks in 1889. John Jaques and Son were the exclusive distributors of the game named Tiddledy-Winks. However, competition was quite fierce, and for several years starting in 1888 other game publishers came out with their own versions of the game using other names, including Spoof, Flipperty Flop, Jumpkins, Golfette, Maro, Flutter, and many others.UK copyright applications at the National Archives, Kew It became one of the most popular crazes during the 1890s, played by adults and children alike. In its earlier years, many different varieties were produced to meet the marketplace demands, including those combining tiddledy-winks principles with tennis, basketball, croquet, golf, and other popular sports and endeavours. Throughout the first half of the twentieth century, the public perception of the game changed. 1950s The birth of the modern game can be traced to a group of Cambridge University undergraduates meeting in Christ's College on 16 January 1955. Their aim was to devise a sport at which they could represent the university. Within three years the Oxford University Tiddlywinks Society was formed; although the two universities had been playing matches since 1946. In 1957, an article appeared in The Spectator entitled \\"Does Prince Philip cheat at tiddlywinks?\\" Sensing a good publicity opportunity the Cambridge University Tiddlywinks Club (CUTwC) challenged Prince Philip (later to become Chancellor of the University in 1976) to a tiddlywinks match to defend his honour. The Duke of Edinburgh appointed The Goons as his Royal champions. The Duke presented a trophy, the Silver Wink, for the British Universities Championship. The English Tiddlywinks Association (ETwA) was founded on 12 June 1958 with the Reverend Edgar \\"Eggs\\" Ambrose Willis as its first Secretary-General. 1960s During the 1960s as many as 37 universities were playing the game in Great Britain. In 1962, the Oxford University Tiddlywinks Society (OUTS) toured the United States for several weeks under the sponsorship of Guinness. They were undefeated against teams from the New York Giants and various American colleges and newspapers. A very prominent article appeared in Life magazine on 14 December 1962 with coverage of the Harvard team. Harvard's Gargoyle Undergraduate Tiddlywinks Society (GUTS) dominated winks in this era. In the next few years, Harvard and other colleges continued to play, though at a low ebb. From 1962 to 1966, tiddlywinks play in the United States was governed by the National Undergraduate Tiddlywinks Association (NUTS). The North American Tiddlywinks Association (NATwA) was formed on 27 February 1966 (article concluded in February 1975 issue, pages 10, 11). with founders from both American (Harvard University and Harvard Medical School) and Canadian (University of Waterloo and Waterloo Lutheran University) teams. In the meantime, in the fall of 1965, Severin Drix started a team at Cornell, and challenged his friend Ferd Wulkan of MIT to start a tiddlywinks team. MIT and Cornell played in NATwA's tiddlywinks tournaments starting in February 1967, and became dominant. The Harvard and Waterloo teams disappeared from the scene by 1968. The game took particularly strong root at MIT, and the early development of most American players can still be traced to MIT today. While the basic elements of the adult game were devised by CUTwC in its early years, the rules have continued to be modified under the auspices of the various national tiddlywinks associations. ETwA coordinated the game throughout the boom period of the 1960s when winks flourished. A decline in interest within the UK in 1969-1970 led to the establishment of the three national competitions which have been contested to date, namely the National Singles, National Pairs, and the Teams of Four. There are also annual Open Competitions, notably in Oxford, Cambridge and London. 1970s The first serious trans-Atlantic contact was established in 1972, when a team from MIT including Dave Lockwood toured the UK. The success of the Americans shocked complacent Britons. Competition started at the highest level, the World Singles, in 1973. A challenge system was agreed between ETwA and NATwA. The supreme ruling body in world contests is the International Federation of Tiddlywinks Associations (IFTwA). To challenge at the world level, a player must win one of the national titles, or finish as the highest placed home player behind a foreign winner. There have been over 65 World Singles contests to date. The Americans dominated all the early matches, and it was not until the 22nd contest that a Briton won for the first time. Since then the top Britons and Americans have been closely matched. After the establishment of the World Singles, a World Pairs event followed, and there have since been over 40 World Pairs contests. International matches have been played since 1972. Twenty-first century During its history, winks has enjoyed variable levels of interest. The game has never taken a strong hold outside the UK and North America. The focus of British tiddlywinks is still at Cambridge, and CUTwC's 50th anniversary celebrations in 2005 were well attended. The Oxford University Tiddlywinks Society has recently fallen out of existence. Despite this there has recently been some resurgence in the game, with new clubs having been formed recently in the University of York and in Shrewsbury School. In America, there has been a tradition of tiddlywinks in Washington D.C., Boston, Eastern Ohio, and Ithaca, New York. There was a renewal of winks in 2007 through the MIT Tiddlywinks Association. National competitions are well attended, with a group of enthusiastic young players joining the stock of veteran players who have proved themselves at the highest level in world competition. In the US, the game had a firm footing in certain high schools, since the children of many of the players who took up the game in the late 1960s and early 1970s played when they were in high school. These players are now looking to revive university tiddlywinks in the United States. On 1 March 2008, there was a Royal Match in Cambridge to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the original Royal Match played against The Goons in 1958 (see above). CUTwC players took on HRH Prince Philip's Royal Champions, the Savage Club, with members of the original 1958 CUTwC team in attendance. Cambridge repeated their victory from 1958 by winning the match 24-18.

Synopsis = \\"The Small Rain\\"  This was Pynchon's first published story. It centers around Nathan Levine, a lazy Specialist 3/C in the Army stationed at New Orleans who, along with several of his companions in the battalion are assigned to help with the cleanup at a small island named Creole, which has just been hit by a hurricane. He picks up dead bodies back at the island and after the horrific day of work, he heads back thinking about how to go forward with his life, if at all.  \\"Low- lands\\"  Dennis Flange, a lawyer at Wasp and Winsome, Attorneys at Law, calls into the office, telling them he's not coming in. What he's going to do instead is sit at home and drink wine with the neighborhood garbage man, Rocco Squarcione. As they sit and talk, Dennis's wife, Cindy, comes home and is noticeably frustrated by Dennis's afternoon activities. To make matters worse, an old rowdy college \\"friend\\" of the Flanges, named Pig Bodine, shows up in a stolen MG to see his old friend. At this, Cindy orders the three men off the premises. They all get in Rocco's garbage truck, and head down to the dump, patrolled by an old man named Bolingbroke. There, Dennis waxes philosophical about the dump, thinking of it as an allegory for his life up to that point, and possibly his life in the future. Rocco leaves for home, and Bolingbroke, Bodine, and Dennis turn in for the night, swapping sea stories as they doze off. Then, in the middle of the night, Dennis hears a woman's voice calling \\"Anglo! Anglo with the golden hair!\\". Realizing this is him, Dennis runs off into the dump looking for the woman. Remembering that Bolingbroke said that gypsies were in the area, Dennis wonders if the woman he's looking for is a gypsy. Then he sees her. She is the most beautiful woman he's ever seen... and is also three feet tall. She takes him to her home, tunneling deep into the dump, where she asks him to marry her. He declines, saying he's already married. To this, she starts crying, thinking Dennis won't take her. He then thinks she looks like a child, and that he always wanted children, but Cindy was too busy. He then tells her he'll stay... for a while.  \\"Entropy\\" A weekend-long lease-breaking party devolves into disarray as Meatball Mulligan entertains a revolving door of cronies, servicemen, and jazz musicians while, in a hothouse room, Callisto and his lover Aubade ponder the everpresent condition of enclosed systems creating disorder while trying to nurse a baby bird back to health. The temperature outside remains 37 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the day, fueling apocalyptic paranoia in Callisto, who pontificates on the discoveries of the Laws of Thermodynamics, the Clausius theorem, and Gibbs and Boltzmann, finally deciding that entropy is an adequate metaphor to apply to American consumerist society, \\"a similar tendency from the least to the most probable, from differentiation to sameness, from ordered individuality to a kind of chaos.\\" Meanwhile, Meatball juggles his attention between conversations about communication theory and personal relationships, keeping the musicians from smoking marijuana in his place, and the unexpected entrances of three coed philosophy majors lugging gallons of Chianti and, later, five sailors searching for a whorehouse. As the musicians discuss music theory, the girls and sailors chant drunken songs together, and childish chicanery break out all over, Meatball debates whether to hide in a closet until the party subsides its second wind or try to calm everyone down, one by one. He decides on the latter, patching up each out-of-control situation until the party tapers down to a din. Callisto's bird fails to improve under the unchanging conditions, which causes Aubade to smash out a window of the hothouse with her bare hands, displacing the constant temperature of inside and outside and leaving the story in a state of hovering uncertainty of where the next moment will lead.  \\"Under the Rose\\"  Two English spies, named Porpentine and Goodfellow, are sitting in a cafe in Upper Egypt. Their mission is to find out what their nemesis, Moldweorp, is up to in the area. Porpentine theorizes his plan is to assassinate the Consul-General, and so they travel to Cairo to intercept him, along with Goodfellow's new girlfriend, named Victoria Wren, her family, and a man named Bongo-Shaftsbury. During the trip, Bongo- Shaftsbury attempts to attack Victoria's younger sister Mildred, but Porpentine stops him. He then realizes that the man is a spy working for Moldweorp, and Bongo-Shaftsbury is put under guard. Upon reaching Cairo, the two men check into their hotels. The next morning, they head to the opera house where the Consul-General is a guest. Upon reaching their destination, they realize their hunch was correct, and Moldweorp and his spies are swarming the place. After Porpentine foils the assassination attempt, a chase across the streets of Cairo ensues. They reach the Sphinx, and exit their cabs, running across the desert. Porpentine and Goodfellow catch Moldweorp, and they talk a moment. Porpentine tells Goodfellow to return to the cab. He does, and a shot rings out. Turning around, he sees his companion face-down in the hot desert sand, as Moldweorp walks away. Sixteen years later, Goodfellow surveys a motorcade containing Archduke Franz Ferdinand, upon hearing rumors of a possible assassination. He's joined by his new girlfriend, a barmaid this time, who thinks of him as just a simple-minded Englishman, no good in bed but liberal with his money.  \\"The Secret Integration\\"  Grover Snodd and his friends Tim Santora, Carl Barrington, Etienne Cherdlu, and Hogan Slothrop, neighborhood kids from Mingeborough, New York, meet up at Grover's house one Saturday afternoon to discuss activities for the weekend. Their \\"Inner Junta\\" talk about planning elaborate practical jokes, collecting milk money from schoolkids. The meeting adjourns and the five of them depart, through a lush section of forest they dub King Yjro's Woods, then down a stream aboard a refurbished flat-bottomed boat they christened the S.S. Leak, to an abandoned manor known as \\"The Big House\\". Here they solidify plans to infiltrate and disrupt a PTA meeting with smoke bombs and sodium/water explosions when Hogan, an 8-year-old AA member, gets a call to sit with another member who is alone and afraid. He and Tim abandon the group and go to the hotel where Mr. Carl McAfee, a Negro musician from Mississippi, was staying. Mr. McAfee eyes the situation with the kids and, chalking it up to a bad joke, sends them away and calls room service for a fifth of whiskey. Hogan steadfastly claims his seriousness and the kids stay to keep him company. After failing to shoo them away, Grover calls the hotel and asks to show up with Etienne. McAfee can't afford to pay for the bottle of whiskey, much less the room he's staying in, and breaks down into screaming and crying in his bed, passing out in-between fits. The police are called in to escort Mr. McAfee out as a vagrant, despite protests from the kids and Hogan's insistence that the man is sick, not a criminal. The timeline gets flipped here and, after the Junta had successfully completed a few of their practical jokes, talk about Carl Barrington's family moving into the neighborhood had taken over the parents. In response to the word \\"integration\\" being thrown around, Grover, the boy genius, offers the calculus definition. Later it is realized that the parents were discussing the other meaning for \\"integration\\", white and black kids in the same schools, was what was really meant. Carl's family, who is Negro, is a sort of trigger for the gentrification of the area, an easy target, an explanation for the racist remarks made by Tim's mother and reflected around the neighborhood, and gives light to the mockery of Hogan's dispatch to Mr. McAfee's aid. Carl, although accepted by the boys as a legitimate member of the Junta, could only be related to by grownups as an \\"imaginary playmate\\", someone who is talked about and reflected through safe White suburban eyes, then left to harmlessly evaporate at day's end.

During his lifetime, he compiled and published detailed accounts of the city of Norwich, the Borough of Thetford and the southern hundreds of the county, but died before the whole work could be completed. Biography  Memorial tablets to Henry and Alice Blomefield, parents of Francis Blomefield, St Andrew's Church, Fersfield, Norfolk Francis Blomefield was born in the village of Fersfield in south Norfolk, the eldest son of yeoman farmers, Henry and Alice Blomefield. He was educated at Diss and Thetford Grammar Schools. In April 1724, he was admitted to Caius College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1727 and MA in 1728. On leaving university in 1727, he was ordained a priest, appointed Rector of Hargham in 1729, and shortly afterwards Rector of Fersfield, his father's family living. On 1 September 1732, he married Mary Womack, the daughter of a former rector of Fersfield. They had three daughters, two of whom survived him. Title page of Blomefield's Collectanea Cantabrigiensia, published in Norwich in 1751 As a boy, Blomefield began recording monumental inscriptions from churches he visited in Norfolk, Suffolk and later Cambridgeshire. Whilst at college, he also kept genealogical and heraldic notes relating to local families. Soon after leaving university, he was collecting materials for an account of the antiquities of Cambridgeshire, but in 1732, this project was deferred when he was given access to Peter Le Neve's huge collection of materials for the history of Norfolk, by Le Neve's executor \\"Honest Tom\\" Martin. In July 1733, Blomefield published his proposals for publishing An Essay towards a Topographical History of Norfolk in parts. Soon afterwards, while collecting further information for his history, he discovered some of the famous Paston Letters. By 1736, he was ready to begin putting the results of his researches into type, assisted by his friend Charles Parkin, Rector of Oxborough. At the end of 1739, the first volume of Blomefield‚Äôs History of Norfolk was completed. It was printed at the author's own press at Fersfield, acquired specially for the purpose. The second volume, consisting of a detailed history of Norwich, was begun in 1741 and completed by 1745. In 1751, Blomefield published his Cambridgeshire notes as a single volume entitled Collectanea Cantabrigiensia. He was two-thirds through his third volume, but had only covered about 40 per cent of the county when he contracted smallpox on a visit to London, and died in Fersfield in January 1752. In 1871, clergyman and naturalist Leonard Jenyns inherited the property of his distant cousin Francis Blomefield, which was worth more than ¬£7000 and came with 140 acres near Diss, Norfolk. As a condition of the inheritance Jenyns changed his name to Blomefield by royal licence. Completion of the History of Norfolk The topographical history of the remaining areas of Norfolk was subsequently completed by Blomefield‚Äôs friend, the Rev Charles Parkin, between 1753 and 1765 (albeit in a far less detailed and accurate manner than Blomefield had managed). The remaining sheets of volume 3 and two further folio volumes were published at King's Lynn between 1769 and 1775. The entire work was subsequently reprinted in eleven quarto volumes in London in 1805‚Äì1810. Assessment Blomefield's Norfolk was both detailed and largely reliable and comparable with the best county histories of the period. There is little doubt that in compiling his book Blomefield had frequent recourse to the existing historical collections of Peter Le Neve, John Kirkpatrick of Norwich and Tanner, his own work being to some extent one of expansion and addition, despite some extensive collections of his own.

He was active in a variety of environmental protests including that in Fairmile, Devon, against the expansion of the A30 road in 1996. Biography Daniel Marc Hooper was born in Luton, (Bedfordshire). He became a nationally known figure in 1996 after spending a week in a complex series of tunnels dug in the path of a new extension to the A30 road in Fairmile, Devon, resisting attempts at eviction by police. Peter Faulding was called in as a confined space rescue specialist to safely remove Swampy and a number of other protesters locked on deep inside the network of manmade tunnels. Several people took part in the protest, but Swampy was the last one evicted. The magistrate passing sentence on him was David Cameron's mother. Swampy was originally from Newbury, Berkshire, the site of the protest over the Newbury bypass, and he then lived with his parents in Hazlemere, Buckinghamshire.Road Protesters Plan next course of action, The Independent 1997.

Economic theory and economic policy have long seen income and its distribution as a central concern. Classical economists such as Adam Smith (1723-1790), Thomas Malthus (1766-1834), and David Ricardo (1772-1823) concentrated their attention on factor income- distribution, that is, the distribution of income between the primary factors of production ( land, labour and capital). Modern economists have also addressed issues of income distribution, but have focussed more on the distribution of income across individuals and households. Important theoretical and policy concerns include the balance between income inequality and economic growth, and their often inverse relationship. The Lorenz curve can represent the distribution of income within a society. The Lorenz curve is closely associated with measures of income inequality, such as the Gini coefficient.  Measurement  The concept of inequality is distinct from that of povertyFor poverty see FGT metrics. and fairness. Income inequality metrics (or income distribution metrics) are used by social scientists to measure the distribution of income, and economic inequality among the participants in a particular economy, such as that of a specific country or of the world in general. While different theories may try to explain how income inequality comes about, income inequality metrics simply provide a system of measurement used to determine the dispersion of incomes.  Causes of income inequality Causes of income inequality and of levels of equality/inequality include: tax policies, other economic policies, labor union policies, Federal Reserve monetary policies & fiscal policies, the market for labor, abilities of individual workers, technology and automation, education, globalization, gender bias, racism, and culture.  Distribution measurement internationally  Using Gini coefficients, several organizations, such as the United Nations (UN) and the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), have measured income inequality by country. The Gini index is also widely used within the World Bank. It is an accurate and reliable index for measuring income distribution on a country by country level. The Gini index measurements go from 0 to 1 for 1 being perfect inequality and 0 being perfect equality. The world Gini index is measured at 0.52 as of 2016. File:2014 Gini Index World Map, income inequality distribution by country per World Bank (monocolor scale).svg2014 World Gini Index The World Inequality Lab at the Paris School of Economics published in December 2017 the World Inequality Report 2018 that provides estimates of global income and wealth inequality.[wir2018.wid.world Dedicated website for World Inequality Report 2018]  Trends  Idealized hypothetical Kuznets curve Standard economic theory stipulates that inequality tends to increase over time as a country develops, and to decrease as a certain average income is attained. This theory is commonly known as the Kuznets curve after Simon Kuznets. However, many prominent economists disagree with the need for inequality to increase as a country develops. Further, empirical data on the proclaimed subsequent decrease of inequality is conflicting. There are two ways of looking at income inequality, within country inequality (intra-country inequality) ‚Äì which is inequality within a nation; or between country inequality (inter-country inequality) which is inequality between countries. According to intra-country inequality at least in the OECD countries, a May 2011 report by OECD stated that the gap between rich and poor within OECD countries (most of which are \\"high income\\" economies) \\"has reached its highest level for over 30 years, and governments must act quickly to tackle inequality\\".Society: Governments must tackle record gap between rich and poor, says OECD Furthermore, increased inter-country income inequality over a long period is conclusive, with the Gini coefficient (using PPP exchange rate, unweighted by population) more than doubling between 1820 and the 1980s from .20 to .52 (Nolan 2009:63).Nolan, P., 2009. Crossroads: The End of Wild Capitalism Marshall Cavendish: London, New York However, scholars disagree about whether inter-country income inequality has increased (Milanovic 2011),Milanovic, B., 2011. Haves and the Have-Nots, Basic Books: New York remained relatively stable (Bourguignon and Morrison 2002), or decreased (Sala-i-Martin, 2002)Sala-i-Martin, X., 2002. \\"The Disturbing \\"Rise\\" of Global Income Inequality,\\" NBER Working Papers 8904, National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc. since 1980. What Milanovic (2005) Milanovic, B., 2005. Worlds Apart: Measuring International and Global Inequality, Princeton University Press: Princeton calls the ‚Äúmother of all inequality disputes‚Äù emphasizes this debate by using the same data on Gini coefficient from 1950‚Äì2000 and showing that when countries‚Äô GDP per capita incomes are unweighted by population income inequality increases, but when they are weighted inequality decreases. This has much to do with the recent average income rise in China and to some extent India, who represent almost two-fifths of the world. Notwithstanding, inter-country inequality is significant, for instance as a group the bottom 5% of US income distribution receives more income than over 68 percent of the world, and of the 60 million people that make up the top 1% of income distribution, 50 million of them are citizens of Western Europe, North America or Oceania (Milanovic 2011:116,156). In a TED presentation shown here, Hans Rosling presented the distribution and change in income distribution of various nations over the course of a few decades along with other factors such as child survival and fertility rate. As of 2018, Albania has the smallest gap in wealth distribution with Zimbabwe having the largest gap in wealth distribution.  Income distribution in different countries =Thailand *Thailand has been ranked the world's third most unequal nation after Russia and India, with a widening gap between rich and poor according to Oxfam in 2016. A study by Thammasat University economist Duangmanee Laovakul in 2013 showed that the country's top 20 land owners owned 80 percent of the nation's land. The bottom 20 owned only 0.3 percent. Among those having bank deposits, 0.1 percent of bank accounts held 49 per cent of total bank deposits. , Thai per capita income is US$8,000 a year. The government aims to raise it to US$15,000 (498,771 baht) per year, driven by average GDP growth of five to six percent. Under the 20-year national plan stretching out to 2036, the government intends to narrow the income disparity gap to 15 times, down from 20 times in 2018.  Income distribution in the United States  In the United States, income has become distributed more unequally over the past 30 years, with those in the top quintile (20 percent) earning more than the bottom 80 percent combined.Congressional Budget Office: Trends in the Distribution of Household Income Between 1979 and 2007. October 2011.  Income distribution in the United Kingdom  Inequality in the UK has been very high in the past, and did not change much until the onset of industrialization. Incomes used to be remarkably concentrated pre-industrial evolution: up to 40% of total income went into the pockets of the richest 5%. In the more recent years income distribution is still an issue. The UK experienced a large increase in inequality during the 1980s‚Äîthe incomes of the highest deciles increase while everyone else was stagnant. Uneven growth in the years leading up to 1991 meant further increases in inequality. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, more even growth across the distribution meant little changes in inequality, with rising incomes for everybody. In sight of Brexit, there is more predicted income distribution discrepancies between wages. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

The background to the strike The textile industry, once concentrated in New England with outposts in New Jersey and Philadelphia, had started moving South in the 1880s. By 1933 Southern mills produced more than seventy percent of cotton and woolen textiles in more modern mills, drawing on the pool of dispossessed farmers and laborers willing to work for roughly forty percent less than their Northern counterparts. As was the rest of economic life, the textile industry was strictly segregated and drew only from white workers in the Piedmont. Until 1965, when passage of the Civil Rights Act broke the color line in hiring, less than 2% of textile workers were African American.Thomas Lyons, \\"Review of Timothy Minchin, Hiring the Black Worker: The Racial Integration of the Southern Textile Industry, 1960-1980.\\" EH.Net Economic History Services, Jun 18 1999. , accessed 28 Mar 2008 Throughout the 1920s, however, the mills faced an intractable problem of overproduction, as the wartime boom for cotton goods ended, while foreign competition cut into their markets. Although manufacturers tried to reduce the oversupply by forming industry associations to regulate competition, their favored solution to the crisis was to squeeze more work out of their employees through what workers called the \\"stretch-out\\": speeding up production by increasing the number of looms assigned to each factory hand, limiting break times, paying workers by piece rates, and increasing the number of supervisors to keep workers from slowing down, talking or leaving work. The stretch-out sparked hundreds of strikes throughout the Southeast: by one count, there were more than eighty strikes in South Carolina in 1929 alone. While most of them were short-lived, these strikes were almost all spontaneous walkouts, without any union - or other - leadership. That year also saw the massive strikes that began in Gastonia, North Carolina, and Elizabethton, Tennessee, which were violently suppressed by local police and vigilantes. Here again, workers were often more militant than their trade union leadership: to take one striking example, the workers at the Loray Mill in Gastonia walked out under the leadership of the communist-led National Textile Workers Union. The Communist Party founded the NTWU in its short-lived attempt to create revolutionary unions.Taylor, Gregory S., \\"The History of the North Carolina Communist Party.\\" Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 2009, p. 22 ff. In the meantime, the Great Depression made matters worse. The economic collapse drove a number of New England and Mid-Atlantic manufacturers into bankruptcy, while those employers who survived laid off workers and increased the amount and pace of work for their employees even further. Textile workers across the region, from worsted workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts and silk weavers in Paterson, New Jersey, to cotton millhands in Greenville, South Carolina, engaged in hundreds of isolated strikes, even though there were thousands of unemployed workers desperate to take their places. Rising hopes under the New Deal The election of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the passage of the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) appeared to change things. The NIRA, which Roosevelt signed in June 1933, called for cooperation among business, labor and government and established the National Recovery Administration (NRA). It was to oversee the creation of codes of conduct for particular industries that would reduce overproduction, raise wages, control hours of work, guarantee the rights of workers to form unions, and stimulate an economic recovery. The NIRA rarely, if ever, lived up to its promises: employers usually dominated the panels that created these codes, which often offered far less than what workers and their unions demanded, and the NIRA and the codes themselves were toothless, since the Act did not provide any effective means to enforce the standards. Even so, the promise of the right to join a union had an electrifying effect on textile workers: the United Textile Workers (UTW), which had no more than 15,000 members in February, 1933, grew to 250,000 members by June, 1934, of whom roughly half were cotton mill workers. Textile workers also put tremendous faith in the NIRA to bring an end to the stretch-out, or at least temper its worst features. As one union organizer said, textile workers in the South saw the NIRA as something that \\"God has sent to them.\\" The NIRA quickly promulgated a code for the cotton industry regulating workers' hours and establishing a minimum wage; it also established a committee to study the problem of workloads. In the meantime, however, the employers responded to the new minimum wages by increasing the pace of work. When the labor board set a forty-hour work week, mill owners required the same amount of work in those forty hours as they had in the previous fifty- to sixty-hour week. By August 1934, workers had filed nearly 4,000 complaints to the labor board protesting \\"code chiseling\\" by their employers ; the board found in favor of only one worker. Union supporters often lost their jobs and found themselves blacklisted throughout the industry. Workers, both north and south, wrote thousands of letters to the White House, the Department of Labor, the NRA, and Eleanor Roosevelt asking for them to intervene. In what proved to be a dry run of the larger strike to follow, cotton mill workers in South Carolina's Horse Creek Valley struck to force employers to live up to the code, only to face special deputies, highway patrolmen and a machine-gun unit of the National Guard sent to keep the mills open. When the NIRA's special board came to Horse Creek, it did not respond to the workers' complaints, but urged them to return to work. When they attempted to do so, the mill owners not only refused to allow the workers back, but evicted them from company housing. The NIRA took no action to stop the employers from violating the codes. First steps toward a national strike When the mill owners made the cotton mill employees' hours larger still further - with the blessing of the NRA - without raising their hourly wage rates in May, 1934, the UTW threatened a national strike. This talk was largely bluster; the union had made no preparations for a strike that size. When the NRA promised to give the UTW a seat on the board, balanced by the addition of another industry representative, the UTW canceled the planned strike. While the UTW called off its plans for a strike, local leaders thought differently. The UTW locals in the northern part of Alabama launched a strike that began on July 18 in Huntsville, then spread to Florence, Anniston, Gadsden, and Birmingham. While the strike was popular, it was also ineffective: many employers welcomed it as a means of cutting their expenses, since they had warehouses full of unsold goods. In Columbus, Georgia, a city on the Alabama border, the Georgia Webbing and Tape Company had been on strike since July. On August 10, 1934 Reuben Sanders was killed in a scuffle between strikebreakers and strikers.Janet Irons, Testing the New Deal:The General Textile Strike of 1934 in the American South (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2000), 116-117 \\"Eight thousand people viewed Sander's body as it lay in state at the Central Textile Hall in the heart of the city on Sunday, August 12.\\"Ibid. The UTW called a special convention in New York City on Monday, August 13, 1934 to address the crisis. The UTW drew up a list of demands for the industry as a whole: a thirty-hour week, minimum wages ranging from $13.00 to $30.00 a week, elimination of the stretch-out, union recognition, and reinstatement of workers fired for their union activities. The delegates, especially those from the southern states, voted overwhelmingly to strike the cotton mills on September 1, 1934 if these demands were not met. They planned to bring out the woolen, silk and rayon workers at a date to be set later. Mill owners had seen the strike threat as more empty talk from the union. The White House took a largely \\"hands off\\" attitude, leaving it to the first National Labor Relations Board to set up a meeting of the parties. The employers refused to meet with the union. The strike begins The strike swept through Southern cotton mills, outpacing the union organizers and employing \\"flying squadrons\\" which traveled by truck and on foot from mill to mill, calling the workers out. In Gastonia, where authorities had violently suppressed a strike led by the National Textile Workers Union in 1929, an estimated 5,000 people marched in the September 3rd Labor Day parade. The next day union organizers estimated that 20,000 out of the 25,000 textile workers in the county were out on strike. It is not clear whether the UTW expected to have this much success so easily and so quickly in the South; it had only shallow roots and few regular organizers in that region. But Southern textile workers had a good deal of experience in confronting management, both by impromptu strikes and other means, and a deep well of bitterness against their employers. Some workers converted their experience into a nearly messianic belief in the power of unionism to take them out of bondage. One labor official made the connection in Biblical terms: \\"The first strike on record was the strike in which Moses led the children of Israel out of Egypt. They too struck against intolerable conditions\\". Textile workers in the North went out on strike in great numbers as well, although they were spread more evenly across different industries and had more diverse grievances than the Southern cotton mill workers. Within a week, almost 400,000 textile workers nationwide had left their jobs and the textile industry was shut down. Music also played an important role in the strike as radio stations looking for an audience located themselves near mill stations spreading information to workers and giving them a better sense of community. The stations would mainly play music that was popular and well known among the workers. \\"Music for the People: The Role of Music in the Southern Textile Strikes of 1929-34\\", Monthly Labor Review, May 2017. The authorities respond The mill owners were initially taken by surprise by the scope of the strike. They immediately took the position that these flying squadrons were, in fact, coercing their employees to go out on strike. Governor Blackwood of South Carolina took up this theme, announcing that he would deputize the state's \\"mayors, sheriffs, peace officers and every good citizen\\" to maintain order, then called out the National Guard with orders to shoot to kill any picketers who tried to enter the mills. Governor Ehringhaus of North Carolina followed suit on September 5. Millowners persuaded local authorities throughout the Piedmont to augment their forces by swearing in special deputies, often their own employees or local residents opposed to the strike; in other cases they simply hired private guards to police the areas around the plant. Violence between guards and picketers broke out almost immediately. The major known incidents include: * in Trion, Georgia, a picketer and mill guard died in a shootout on September 2 * guards killed two picketers in Augusta, Georgia on September 2 * six picketers were shot to death, one died later in the hospital, and more than twenty other picketers wounded, most shot in the back as they were fleeing the picketline, in Honea Path, South Carolina on September 6 Authorities ordered out the National Guard elsewhere in the second week of the strike. Governor Green sent the Guard to Saylesville, Rhode Island after several thousand strikers and sympathizers trapped several hundred strikebreakers in a factory. Governor Green declared martial law in the area on September 11, after picketers armed with rocks, flowerpots and broken headstones from a nearby cemetery battled troops armed with machine guns, in a 36-hour incident that resembled a civic insurrection. Casualty figures vary. A granite marker erected at one of the battle sites names four workers who died in the Saylesville conflict.http://www.uri.edu/research/lrc/info/Labor_Day-2010.pdf Another picketer was shot to death the following day, about five miles away in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, when guardsmen fired into the crowd attempting to storm the Woonsocket Rayon Plant. Governor Green then asked the federal government to send federal troops; the Roosevelt administration ignored the request. Maine deployed the Guard in a more tactical manner, sending them to Augusta and Lewiston to discourage wavering employees from joining the strike. That tactic did not work, however, everywhere: workers at Pepperell Mills' plant in Biddeford and York Manufacturing's plant in Saco went out even though the guard was sent to prevent the arrival of flying squadrons rumored to be coming from New Bedford, Massachusetts. Governor Wilbur L. Cross of Connecticut also mobilized the Guard, but did not declare martial law. Instead the state labor commissioner met with picketers during the second week of the strike and brought about a reduction in tensions by urging strikers to respect the law and not hurl epithets at strikebreakers. Things were different in Georgia, where Governor Eugene Talmadge declared martial law in the third week of the strike and directed the National Guard to arrest all picketers throughout the state, holding them in a former World War I prisoner of war camp for trial by a military tribunal. While the state only interned a hundred or so picketers, the show of force effectively ended picketing throughout most of the state. End of the strike The strike was, in fact, already falling apart, particularly in the South, where local government refused to provide any relief assistance to strikers and there were few sympathetic churches or unions to provide support. Although the union had pledged before the walkout began to feed strikers, it was wholly unable to fulfill this promise. While roughly half of the textile workers in North and South Carolina and roughly three fourths in Georgia were on strike at this point, with similar figures in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, workers had started to drift back to work and struck plants were reopening, if with only skeleton crews. At that point the mediation board that Roosevelt had appointed in the first week of the strike issued its report. As was typical of federal commissions of this era, the board temporized, urging further studies of the economic plight of the employers and the effects of the stretch-out on their employees. It urged the President to create a new Textile Labor Relations Board to hear workers' complaints and urged employers not to discriminate against strikers. President Roosevelt announced his support for the report, then urged employees to return to work and the manufacturers to accept the commission's recommendations. The UTW took the opportunity to declare victory and held a number of parades to celebrate the end of the strike. In fact, the strike was a total defeat for the union, particularly in the South. The union had not forced the mill owners to recognize it or obtained any of its economic demands. The employers refused, moreover, to reinstate strikers throughout the South, while the Cotton Textile National Industrial Relations Board never ceded any authority to any other board. Thousands of strikers never returned to work in the mills. Aftermath In March 1935, approximately 2,000 textile workers at Callaway Mills went on strike in LaGrange, Georgia, and martial law was declared in the city. At least one striker was killed by National Guardsmen as the soldiers evicted families from mill-owned homes. Some consider the 1935 strike in LaGrange to be the last throes of the General Textile Strike. Ironically, President Roosevelt was a friend and frequent visitor of Cason Callaway, President of Callaway Mills at the time. The strike represented the high point for union hopes of organizing textile workers in the South for the next several decades. When the CIO formed the Textile Workers Organizing Committee three years later, the TWOC focused on northern manufacturers outside the cotton industry. TWOC's successor, the Textile Workers Union of America, faced similar problems organizing in the South; the CIO's postwar organizing drive in the South fell apart chiefly because of its inability to organize textile workers there. The union might have escaped this disaster if it had characterized the strike as a first step, rather than attempting to pass it off as a victory. That, however, would have required that the union also devote the resources necessary to follow up with renewed, systematic organizing efforts in the immediate aftermath of the strike, instead of concerning itself with the futile effort to win reinstatement for discharged strikers through the Textile Labor Board. The memory of blacklisting and defeat soured many Southern textile workers on unions for decades. The 1934 defeat was less cataclysmic in the North, in that the strike was in fact, a number of separate events, commencing at different times in separate industries and in furtherance of local goals. Northern employers were not as ruthless in blacklisting workers and the TWOC made some headway in organizing these plants in the years that followed. Those victories were impermanent, however, as much of northern industry either went South or went bankrupt in the years that followed. Anti-union sentiment in the South kept wages low for decades, but also acted as a catalyst for development later when industries moved there from the North and Midwest because of lower costs. Employers resisted integrating textile mills; when they were forced to do so by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, researchers found that African Americans were accepted overall by other employees, although they continued to face discrimination in job training and advancement. By the time this occurred, many jobs in the textile industry were already moving overseas, a trend that accelerated in the 1980s.Thomas Lyons, \\"Review of Timothy Minchin, Hiring the Black Worker: The Racial Integration of the Southern Textile Industry, 1960-1980.\\" EH.Net Economic History Services, Jun 18 1999 , accessed 28 Mar 2008 See also * Murder of workers in labor disputes in the United States ReferencesFurther reading Books * Conway, Mimi.

He has served as senior scientist for climate studies at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. He is known for his satellite-based temperature monitoring work, for which he was awarded the American Meteorological Society's Special Award. Education and career Spencer received a B.S. in atmospheric sciences from the University of Michigan in 1978 and his M.S. and Ph.D. in meteorology from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1980 and 1982. His doctoral thesis was titled, A case study of African wave structure and energetics during Atlantic transit. After receiving his Ph.D. in 1982, Spencer worked for two years as a research scientist in the Space Science and Engineering Center at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. He then joined NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center as a visiting scientist in 1984, where he later became senior scientist for climate studies. After leaving NASA in 2001, Spencer has been a principal research scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). As well as his position at UAH, Spencer is currently the U.S. Science Team leader for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) on NASA's Aqua satellite, a position he has held since 1994. In 2001, he designed an algorithm to detect tropical cyclones and estimate their maximum sustained wind speed using the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU). Spencer has been a member of several science teams: the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Space Station Accommodations Analysis Study Team, Science Steering Group for TRMM, TOVS Pathfinder Working Group, NASA Headquarters Earth Science and Applications Advisory Subcommittee, and two National Research Council (NRC) study panels. He is on the board of directors of the George C. Marshall Institute, and on the board of advisors of the Cornwall Alliance for the Stewardship of Creation. Spencer's research work is funded by NASA, NOAA, DOE, and the DOT Peer-reviewed articles on climate change=Negative cloud feedback In 2007, Spencer and others published a paper in Geophysical Research Letters regarding negative cloud feedback in the tropics that potentially supports Richard Lindzen's Iris hypothesis, which proposes that as the tropical atmosphere warms, cirrus clouds decrease, allowing infrared heat to escape from the atmosphere to outer space. Spencer stated, \\"To give an idea of how strong this enhanced cooling mechanism is, if it was operating on global warming, it would reduce estimates of future warming by over 75 percent. [...] Right now, all climate models predict that clouds will amplify warming. I'm betting that if the climate models' 'clouds' were made to behave the way we see these clouds behave in nature, it would substantially reduce the amount of climate change the models predict for the coming decades.\\" Cloud formation and temperature change In 2008, Spencer and William Braswell published a paper in the Journal of Climate which suggests that natural variations in how clouds form could actually be causing temperature changes, rather than the other way around, and could also lead to overestimates of how sensitive the Earth's climate is to greenhouse gas emissions. Spencer stated, \\"Our paper is an important step toward validating a gut instinct that many meteorologists like myself have had over the years, [...] that the climate system is dominated by stabilizing processes, rather than destabilizing processes ‚Äì that is, negative feedback rather than positive feedback.\\" Energy lost to space as compared to climate models In 2011, Spencer and Braswell published a paper in Remote Sensing concluding that more energy is radiated back to space and released earlier than previously thought. Spencer stated, \\"The satellite observations suggest there is much more energy lost to space during and after warming than the climate models show. There is a huge discrepancy between the data and the forecasts that is especially big over the oceans.\\" The paper was criticized by numerous climate scientists. Kerry Emanuel of MIT, said this work was cautious and limited mostly to pointing out problems with forecasting heat feedback. The editor-in-chief of Remote Sensing, Wolfgang Wagner, later resigned over publication of Spencer and Braswell (2011), stating, \\"From a purely formal point of view, there were no errors with the review process. [...] the problem I see with the paper by Spencer and Braswell is not that it declared a minority view ...but that it essentially ignored the scientific arguments of its opponents. This latter point was missed in the review process, explaining why I perceive this paper to be fundamentally flawed and therefore wrongly accepted by the journal.\\" Wagner added he, \\"would also like to personally protest against how the authors and like-minded climate skeptics have much exaggerated the paper's conclusions in public statements\\". Andrew Dessler later published a paper opposing the claims of Spencer and Braswell (2011) in Geophysical Research Letters. He stated, among other things: Views=Climate change In 2006 Spencer criticized Al Gore's documentary An Inconvenient Truth, saying, \\"For instance, Mr. Gore claims that the Earth is now warmer than it has been in thousands of years. Yet the latest National Academies of Science (NAS) report on the subject has now admitted that all we really know is that we are warmer now than we were during the last 400 years, which is mostly made up of the 'Little Ice Age'\\".Star Search by Roy Spencer, TCS Daily, June 30, 2006 In a New York Post opinion column on February 26, 2007, Spencer wrote: In an interview with conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh on February 28, 2007, Spencer stated that he didn't believe \\"catastrophic manmade global warming\\" was occurring. He also criticized climate models, saying \\"The people that have built the climate models that predict global warming believe they have sufficient physics in those models to predict the future. I believe they don't. I believe the climate system, the weather as it is today in the real world shows a stability that they do not yet have in those climate models.\\"Global Warming Update: Facts, Science Smash the Global Warming Myth Roy Spencer is also included in a film that argues against the theory of man-made global warming called The Great Global Warming Swindle. He testified before the Waxman committee's examination of political interference with climate science on March 19, 2007. Spencer has published two books on climate change: In 2008, Climate Confusion: How Global Warming Hysteria Leads to Bad Science, Pandering Politicians and Misguided Policies that Hurt the Poor,Climate Confusion and in 2010, The Great Global Warming Blunder: How Mother Nature Fooled the World‚Äôs Top Climate Scientists.Bickmore, Barry (February 27, 2011). \\"Roy Spencer‚Äôs Great Blunder, Part 1\\".

Climatologist Patrick Michaels, also a self-professed skeptic of global warming, has defended Spencer, arguing that his religious beliefs have nothing to do with his climate change research. On July 18, 2013 before U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer's Environment and Public Works committee, Spencer suggested the hearing title could easily be renamed \\"Climate Change, It's Happened Before\\" rather than the actual title, \\"Climate Change, It's Happening Now\\". He added \\"The last 2000 years of proxy reconstructed temperature variations for the Northern Hemisphere shows that the Modern Warm Period (today) is not significantly different from the Medieval Warm Period of ~1000 years ago, or the Roman Warm Period of ~2000 years ago.\\"Noon, Marita (July 21, 2013). \\"Why Is Obama Lying on Climate Change?\\" Town Hall. In February 2014 Spencer posted on his blog that he was going to start referring to those who referred to those questioning the mainstream view of global warming (such as Spencer himself) as \\"climate change deniers\\" as \\"global warming Nazis\\", contending that \\"...these people are supporting policies that will kill far more people than the Nazis ever did.\\" The Anti-Defamation League responded with a statement condemning Spencer's comparison. Shelley Rose, the ADL's Southeast Interim Regional Director, argued that the comparison of global warming advocates to Nazis was \\"outrageous and deeply offensive,\\" and \\"This analogy is just the latest example of a troubling epidemic of comparisons to Hitler and the Holocaust.\\" In reply, Spencer asked whether the ADL was being hypocritical. Spencer quoted syndicated columnist Ellen Goodman's famous statement that \\"global warming deniers are now on a par with Holocaust deniers,\\" and said that the ADL should condemn that use of \\"denier.\\"UAH climate expert Roy Spencer sharply rebukes criticism from Anti-Defamation League, The Huntsville Times (AL.com), February 28, 2014 Spencer was defended by Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow adjunct policy analyst Alan Caruba, who wrote that \\"Dr. Spencer‚Äôs decision to call a Nazi a Nazi ignited a lot of discussion among the global warming hustlers and those whom they have been calling ‚Äúdeniers‚Äù for many years.\\" Intelligent design In TCS Daily, Spencer wrote, \\"Twenty years ago, as a PhD scientist, I intensely studied the evolution versus intelligent design controversy for about two years.

In the scientific community, I am not alone. There are many fine books out there on the subject. Curiously, most of the books are written by scientists who lost faith in evolution as adults, after they learned how to apply the analytical tools they were taught in college.\\" In the book The Evolution Crisis, Spencer wrote, \\"I finally became convinced that the theory of creation actually had a much better scientific basis than the theory of evolution, for the creation model was actually better able to explain the physical and biological complexity in the world. [...] Science has startled us with its many discoveries and advances, but it has hit a brick wall in its attempt to rid itself of the need for a creator and designer.\\" Awards * 1989 ‚Äì Marshall Space Flight Center Center Director's Commendation * 1990 ‚Äì Alabama House of Representatives Resolution #624 * 1991 ‚Äì NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal (with John Christy) * 1996 ‚Äì American Meteorological Society Special Award \\"for developing a global, precise record of earth's temperature from operational polar-orbiting satellites, fundamentally advancing our ability to monitor climate.\\" (with John Christy) See also * John Christy (satellite temperature record) * UAH satellite temperature dataset Selected publications=Articles  * Books  Peer-reviewed papers  * * ReferencesExternal links * * Roy Spencer ‚Äì NASA Profile US AMSR-E Science Team Leader * Roy Spencer ‚Äì Select Works, George C.

The festival is also observed among Keralites and is vernacularly called Thaipooyam (Malayalam: ).https://www.keralatourism.org/event/thaipooyam-festival-haippad/46 It is mainly observed in countries where there is a significant presence of Tamil community such as India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Mauritius, Singapore,Thaipusam in Singapore. South Africa, Canada and other places where ethnic Tamils reside as a part of the local Indian diaspora population such as R√©union, Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Jamaica and the other parts of the Caribbean. It is a national holiday in many countries like Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Mauritius. In certain states of Malaysia and in the nations of Sri Lanka and Mauritius it is a government and a bank holiday. In Singapore , it was previously a national holiday but was removed from the official list of national holidays to improve business competitiveness. The word Thaipusam is a combination of the name of the month, Thai, and the name of a star, Pusam (Tamil word for Pushya). This particular star is at its highest point during the festival. The festival commemorates the occasion when Parvati gave Murugan (aka Kartikeya) a Vel \\"spear\\" so he could vanquish the evil demon Soorapadman. It is commonly believed that Thaipusam marks Murugan's birthday; Some other sources suggest that Vaikhasi Vishakam, which falls in the Vaikhasi month (May/June), is Murugan's birthday. Origin This festival was (according to one tradition) said to have been supposedly created during one of the battles between the Asuras (or to be more specific Soorapadman) and the Devas. At one point, the latter were defeated several times by the former. The Devas were unable to resist the onslaught of the Asura forces. In despair, they approached Shiva and entreated to give them an able leader under whose heroic leadership they might obtain victory over the Asuras. They surrendered themselves completely and prayed to Shiva. Shiva granted their request by creating the mighty warrior, Skanda, out of his own power or Achintya Shakti. He at once assumed leadership of the celestial forces, inspired them and defeated the Asura forces and to recognise that day the people created the festival, Thaipusam. According to Skanda Puranam, the legend of Murugan, and Thirupugal which are divine verses on Murugan, adhere to Shaivam principles. Murugan is the embodiment of Shiva's light and wisdom and devotees pray to him to overcome the obstacles they face, as He is the divine vanquisher of evil. The motive of Thaipusam festival is to pray to God to receive his grace so that bad traits are destroyed.Significance of Thaipusam , OmTamil published 15 October 2012 Kavadi Attam The Kavadi Attam (\\"kavadi dance\\") is a ceremonial act of devotional sacrifice through dance, food offerings, and bodily self-mortification. It is often performed by devotees during the festival of Thaipusam in honor of Murugan. The kavadi is a semicircular, decorated canopy supported by a wooden rod that the pilgrim carries on their shoulders to the temple. The devotee makes the pilgrimage (the nadai payanam) with bare feet, bearing food offerings on the kavadi. Depending on the location of the temple, this walk to the temple can take more than a week. The temple of Murugan in Palani is a popular destination, as it is one among the arupadai veedu (\\"six houses\\" - the sites sacred to Murugan). The Palani Murugan temple also has a reputation as a place of healing. Bogar (an ancient siddhar and devotee of Murugan) made the statue of Murugan in Palani, with the mixture of several sidhha medicines. Devotees prepare for the celebration by keeping their body always clean, doing regular prayers, following a vegetarian diet and fasting before the Thaipusam. Kavadi-bearers have to perform elaborate ceremonies at the time of assuming the kavadi and at the time of offering it to Murugan. The kavadi-bearer observes celibacy and consumes only certain types of foods known as satvik food, once a day, while continuously thinking of God. On the day of the festival, devotees shave their heads and undertake a pilgrimage along a set route, while engaging in various acts of devotion, notably carrying the various types of kavadi. The devotees believe that worshiping lord Murugan every year in this way makes them physically and mentally healthy, and helps clear them of karmic debts they may have incurred. At its simplest, the pilgrimage may entail walking the route carrying a pot of milk, but mortification of the flesh by piercing the skin, tongue or cheeks with vel skewers is also common. In addition, some pierce their tongues or cheeks, all the way through, with a small spear.Palani Thai Pusam, accessed 5 December 2006 A similar practice is performed by the Nagarathar community in Pazhani, India. This is known as the Nagarathar Kavadi. Thaipusam in India In Palani Sri Dhandayuthapani temple, 10 day Festival (Brahmotsavam) is held during Thaipusam. Thirukalyanam (Celestial Wedding) will be held on the day before Thaipusam. On Thaipusam, Therottam will be held. Lord Muthukumaraswamy will bless devotees in Thanga Guthirai Vahanam (Golden Horse), Periya Thanga Mayil Vahanam (Golden Peacock), Theppotsavam (Float Festival) during the 10 day festival.

While the festival is celebrated across the country, the grandest one is always at Kovil Montagne (Sri Siva Subramanya Thirukovil). Nestled in Corps de Garde Mountain in Quatre Bornes, it was founded in 1890 by a humble and pious Tamil Indian immigrant, Velamurugan. Also celebrated at nearby islands of Seychelles and Reunion Thaipusam Kavady ceremony is celebrated in cities of Durban (Clairwood Shree Siva Soobramonior Temple) and Cape Town of South Africa. At Fiji , the Thaipusam Festival is celebrated at Sri Siva Subrahmanya Swami Temple , Nadi Town. In Indonesia, the procession mainly held in the capital of North Sumatra province, Medan. On the eve of Thaipusam, the Hindus gathered together at Sree Soepramaniem Nagarattar Temple at Kejaksaan Road to accompanying a 125 years old chariot or locally known as Radhoo from the temple to the main temple nearby (about ) at Sri Mariamman Temple at Kampung Madras which opens 24-hours for the festival. The kavadi procession are also happening at the day, but it takes on different temples around Medan and other parts in the province depends on them celebrate it. In the United States of America, the Shiva Murugan Temple in Concord, California celebrates the Thaipoosam preceded by a walk. Some people walk more than from the city of Fremont, some walk from the city of San Ramon to Concord, and most walk from Walden Park in Walnut Creek to Concord. Over 2000 people participated in the walk for last several years.

It lies a couple of miles to the north of Hathersage, and the northern part of the edge forms the border between the High Peak of Derbyshire and Sheffield in South Yorkshire. Its highest point is High Neb at above sea level. Areas of Stanage were quarried in the past to produce grindstones, and some can still be seen on the hillside‚Äîcarved, but never removed. A paved packhorse road ran along the top of the edge, and remains of it can be seen, as can remains of the Long Causeway, once thought to be a Roman road which works its way over the edge on its route from Templeborough to Brough-on-Noe, crossing Hallam Moor and passing Stanedge Pole (note the slightly different spelling), an ancient waymarker on the route to Sheffield. Some cairns along the top are even older, and there is a well-known cave in the cliff known as Robin Hood's Cave. More recent features include early 20th-century drinking basins, designed to collect pure rainwater for grouse to drink. Stanage is a magnet for climbers and ramblers in addition to runners. The Fat Boys Stanage Struggle is a popular local fell race that starts in nearby Hathersage and rises to High Neb before returning to the village 500 feet below. During the construction of the Rivelin tunnel a sighting tower was constructed on the edge to assist in surveying the route of the tunnel. All that remains of the tower is a heap of stones at Ordnance Survey grid reference . Rock climbing graded E1 5b) Stanage's naturally weathered Millstone Grit face is now known as a highly popular location for rock climbing in the Peak District. The edge runs three miles north from the Cowper Stone to Stanage End. It is the northernmost of an almost continuous line of cliffs, including Burbage Rocks, Froggatt Edge, Curbar Edge, Baslow Edge and Birchen Edge. The Cowper Stone is a block of gritstone at the most southerly point of Stanage. Set alone a few hundred metres from the last buttress of the main crag, it is a large boulder with distinctive rounded breaks running across it.Rockfax page on the Cowperstone It is the scene of some classic hard-grit routes of the 1980s first climbed by protagonists such as Johnny Dawes and John Allen. The Edge was notably omitted from the first rock climbing guidebook to the Peak District, Some Gritstone Climbs by John Laycock, published in 1913, due to the then severe access restrictions to the land. It has subsequently been featured regularly in over a century of regular climbing guidebooks, which document the growth in the number of routes and the rise in climbing standards. Although the edge reaches only 25 metres in height it is one of the most famous UK climbing venues: aside from having a multitude of routes close to a major population centre, it is home to the route Right Unconquerable (HVS 5a), which, when first climbed by Joe Brown in 1949, was considered a milestone achievement in British climbing. In spite of its height, the edge is home to the longest recorded rock route in the United Kingdom; the 5000m Girdle Traverse, completed by Ron Fawcett in 1992 and graded \\"E5 6b(ish)\\".Stanage (BMC Guide), David Simmonite et al, (2002) Gallery File:Cowper Stone Stanage Edge.jpgThe Cowper Stone File:Stanage_Edge.jpg File:Stanage edge2.JPG File:View-north-west-along- stanage-edge-uk.jpg See also * Standedge, a moorland escarpment and Pennine crossing point References Category:Hills and edges of South Yorkshire Category:Mountains and hills of Derbyshire Category:Mountains and hills of the Peak District Category:Climbing areas of England Category:Geography of Sheffield Category:Escarpments of England ","title":"Stanage Edge"},{"id":"457441","text":"John Starks may refer to: *John Starks (basketball) (born 1965), former NBA basketball player *John \\"Jabo\\" Starks (1938‚Äì2018), drummer from the James Brown band See also *John Stark (disambiguation) ","title":"John Starks"},{"id":"457446","text":"Chƒ´malmƒÅ, C√≥dice Laud Chimalman or Chƒ´malmƒÅ is a goddess in Aztec mythology, and was considered by the Aztecs to be the mother of the Toltec god Quetzalcoatl. Her name means \\"shield-hand.\\" Several oral traditions consider that Chimalman is that she was a spirit which accompanied the Azteca from the homeland of Aztl√°n. Huitzilopochtli and Quetzalcoatl were spiritual entities adopted from the Toltec legacy when the Azteca lived among the Chichimeca. As with many Aztec myths, there are multiple versions of the Chƒ´malmƒÅ story depending on which tribe and time period is examined. Mother of Quetzalcoatl According to the Manuscript of 1558, section 7, the begetting of Quetzalcoatl happened in this way: \\"And then when Mixcoatl went to... Huitznahuac, the woman Chimalman came out to confront him... She stood naked, without skirt or shift.\\" While she stood thus, Mixcoatl shot an arrow \\"between her legs\\"‚Äîon two separate occasions. \\"And when this had occurred, he took the woman of Huitznauac, the one who is Chimalman, and lay with her and so she became pregnant.\\"Miguel Le√≥n-Portilla & Earl Shorris: In the Language of Kings. Norton & Co., NY, 2001. Page 62. Another version indicates that Mixcoatl saw Chimalman while hunting in the Morelos valley and fell in love with her. When his efforts to approach her failed, he became angry and shot five arrows at her, all of which she caught in her bare hand. She was given the name \\"shield-hand\\" and they were later married, but unable to conceive a child. After praying on the altar of Quetzalcoatl, the priest told Chimalman to swallow a small precious stone, after which she became pregnant. This angered Quetzalcoatl's brother, Tezcatlipoca, such that he persuaded others to kill Mixcoatl. Chimalman fled to her hometown of Tepoztlan and died giving birth to her son Topiltzin. Topiltzin would later discover his identity as Quetzalcoatl and that he was sent to help the Toltec civilization. This version is similar to the Codex Chimalpopoca, that indicated, \\"...Quetzalcoatl was placed in her belly when she swallowed a piece of jade.\\"John Bierhorst: History and Mythology of the Aztecs; the Codex Chimalpopoca.

Because they are very near the border of Scotland and England, nearby Gretna Green, and to a lesser extent Gretna, are traditionally associated with eloping English couples because of the more liberal marriage provisions in Scots law compared to English law. Because of this, \\"Gretna\\" has become a term for a place for quick, easy marriages.E.g., State v. Clay, 182 Md. 639, 642, 35 A.2d 821, 822-23 (1944). Gretna is part of the historic county of Dumfriesshire.Thomson Atlas of Scotland, 1832 History=Etymology Gretna means \\"(place at the) gravelly hill\\", from Old English greot \\"grit\\" (in the dative form greoten (which is where the -n comes from) and hoh \\"hill-spur\\". The Lochmaben Stone is a megalith standing in a field, nearly west of the Sark mouth on the Solway Firth, three hundred yards or so above high water mark on the farm of Old Graitney. It was one of the traditionally recognised meeting places on the England / Scotland border. 17th century Prior to the Acts of Union 1707 of the Parliaments of England and Scotland, Gretna was a customs post for collecting taxes on cattle crossing the border between the two kingdoms. The Gretna customs post was established in 1612.Haldane, pages 161 & 167. A Drove road was constructed between Gretna and Annan in 1619, possibly to facilitate the transportation of cattle from Wigtownshire, Kirkcudbrightshire and Dumfriesshire to markets in England.Haldane, pages 31 & 161. 18th century Gretna's principal claim to fame arose in 1753 when an Act of Parliament, Lord Hardwicke's Marriage Act, was passed in England, which provided, among other things, that if both parties to a marriage were not at least 21 years old, consent to the marriage had to be given by the parents. This Act did not apply in Scotland, which allowed boys to marry at 14 and girls at 12, with or without parental consent. In addition, the Act required procedures that gave notice of an impending marriage to the community. As a result, many elopers fled England, and the first Scottish village they reached was often Gretna. With the construction of a new highway, Gretna Green became easier to reach, and Gretna's appeal as an elopement destination waned. World War I The village was notable for HM Factory, Gretna, codenamed Moorside, a huge cordite munitions factory built nearby on the shore of Solway Firth to supply ammunition to British forces during World War I. The factory, the biggest munitions factory ever built, stretched for from Eastriggs along the Solway coast as far as Longtown in England and across. The factory took 10,000 navvies to build it, and employed 30,000 workers, mostly women. The workers mixed by hand a devil‚Äôs porridge of nitro-glycerine and guncotton into cordite paste, and loaded the extruded cordite strands into shell cases. Gretna and Eastriggs were built to house the workforce, and many were accommodated nearby in Carlisle. When 5,000 workers arrived back by train to Carlisle, one publican had 1,000 whiskies lined up. The labourers and workers had such a reputation for drunkenness, which was seen by Government as such a threat to the national interest, that Gretna and the surrounding area became a historical curiosity for a considerable period. Under the Defence of the Realm Act 1914 a State Management Scheme was set up in 1916 to bring the liquor industry, including public houses (pubs) and the local breweries, under Government control over a wide area stretching as far as Carlisle and Maryport. There were Spiritless Saturdays, and buying anyone else a drink (shouting), and heaters and coolers (drinking beer and spirits in the same pub) were banned. The pub landlords, became civil servants, were instructed to follow a disinterested management policy and not allow people to get drunk in the pubs. The State Management Scheme persisted for many years after the First World War was long over and the munitions factories dismantled. It was not until the early 1970s, when the low prices and unadulterated beer in the Gretna area began to become conspicuous, that the government enterprise was sold off by the Heath government. Geography and administration Gretna is in Dumfries and Galloway, in the south of Scotland, on the A74(M) near the border to England, and near the mouth of the River Esk.1:50,000 OS map 85 The township is distinct from the smaller nearby village of Gretna Green, famous for marriages, which borders but is a separate area from Gretna proper. To the west in Scotland are Eastriggs (about to the west) and Annan (about to the west), both situated on the B721 and linked to the nearby A75. Transport A military road was built in 1763 by General Wade linking Gretna to Portpatrick, then the main ferry port to Northern Ireland.Taylor, Christopher (1979). The Roads & Tracks of Britain. London, Toronto and Melbourne: J. M. Dent & sons ltd. , Page 171. This was later to become the route of much of the A75 road to Stranraer. However, the A75 is a modern road, post-dating World War I. The original route between Gretna and Annan is now the B721 road, and the A75 diverges significantly from it; similarly, the B724 was the original route between Annan and Dumfries.See for instance the re-scaled 1:50,000 Cassini Historical Maps, number 85, for Carlisle & Solway Firth, Revised New Series 1901-1904 () and Popular Edition 1925 (). In the 1840s, there were three main railway companies building lines around Gretna and this resulted in three railway stations named \\"Gretna\\". The first station called \\"Gretna\\" was opened by the Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway on 23 August 1843, this station was renamed Gretna Green railway station in April 1852. It closed on 6 December 1965, but a new station was opened by British Rail nearby on 20 September 1993, the station is served by Glasgow South Western Line. This station had a new platform added in 2009,to coincide with the redoubling of this section of track. The other two stations were located a short distance to the east of Gretna, over the border in England. Gretna (Caledonian) railway station was opened on 9 September 1847 by the Caledonian Railway on its main line between Carlisle and Glasgow and Edinburgh.Butt, page 110 The station closed on 10 September 1951. The North British Railway built Gretna (Border Union) railway station next to the Caledonian station, at Gretna junction, on its short link to the Border Union Railway. The station opened on 1 November 1861 and closed during World War One on 9 August 1915. The main Anglo-Scottish trunk road running north‚Äìsouth through Gretna was the A74 road. With the opening of the M6 motorway to the south of Carlisle in December 1970,Chatsworth, Table 7.3, pages 100 - 123. much of the A74 in Scotland was upgraded to motorway standard in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, and the upgraded sections of road were renamed the A74(M). The, so called, Cumberland Gap was the remaining of non-upgraded dual-carriageway A74 between the northern terminus of the M6 at Carlisle, and the southern end of the A74(M) at the Scottish border. The A75 is a major trunk road heading west along the south coast of Scotland from Gretna. Its eastern terminus at Gretna was originally the A74, but this was changed to a junction with the A74(M). The A75 runs past Eastriggs, Annan, Dumfries, Castle Douglas, Gatehouse of Fleet, Newton Stewart and Glenluce before ending in the west at Stranraer. Present day Much of the local economy is driven by the marriage industry, where by some accounts, as many as one of every six Scottish weddings takes place in Gretna / Gretna Green. Most marriages take place in Gretna itself, at the Register office, the Anvil Hall, or in the numerous Hotels in the centre of the township. Gretna is also the location of the Gretna Gateway Outlet Village, a development of discount factory shops. Thousands of starlings occasionally fly in flocks above Gretna. The birds gather in flocks called murmurations, having migrated in the millions from Russia and Scandinavia to escape the harsher winters there. A nearby sculpture has been approved called the Star of Caledonia. Sport Gretna was also the official home of Gretna Football Club, who played in the Scottish Premier League during the 2007‚Äì2008 season, the club playing 'home' games at Fir Park, Motherwell. The club also reached the 2006 Scottish Cup Final. Mounting financial problems saw the club relegated from the SPL at the end of the season, then demoted to Division 3 of the Scottish Football League. After attempts to find a buyer for the club proved fruitless, Gretna finally resigned from the SFL on 3 June 2008. A new club, Gretna FC 2008 has been founded in its place. Rugby league also has a large following in the area. References=NotesSources * * Chatsworth, George (1984). A history of British motorways. London: Thomas Telford Limited. . * Haldane, A.R.B. (1997).

The primary goal of a guaranteed minimum income is reduction of poverty. In circumstances when citizenship is the sole qualification, the program becomes a universal basic income system. Elements A system of guaranteed minimum income can consist of several elements, most notably: * Calculation of the social minimum, usually below the minimum wage * Social safety net that helps those without sufficient financial means survive at the social minimum through payments or a loan, generally conditional on availability for work, performance of community services, some kind of social contract, or commitment to a social integration trajectory * State child support * Student loan and grants * State pensions for the elderly * Disability pensions for those who physically can't work Differences from basic income Basic income means the provision of identical payments from a government to all of its citizens. Guaranteed minimum income is a system of payments (possibly only one) by a government to citizens who fail to meet one or more means tests. While most modern countries have some form of GMI, a basic income is rare. History Persian monarch Cyrus the Great ( ca 590-ca 529 B.C.), whose government used a regulated minimum wage, also provided special rations to families when a child was born. The Roman Republic and Empire offered the Cura Annonae, a regular distribution of free or subsidized grain or bread to poorer residents. The grain subsidy was first introduced by Gaius Gracchus in 123 B.C., then further institutionalized by Julius Caesar and Augustus Caesar.Erdkamp, Paul, \\"The Food Supply of the Capital,\\" in The Cambridge Companion to Ancient Rome, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 262-264https://www.academia.edu/853118/Grain_Distribution_in_Late_Republican_Rome The first Sunni Muslim Caliph Abu Bakr, who came to power in 632 C.E., introduced a guaranteed minimum standard of income, granting each man, woman and child ten dirhams annually. This was later increased to twenty dirhams.Grace Clark: Pakistan's Zakat and 'Ushr as a Welfare System In 1795, American revolutionary Thomas Paine advocated a citizen's dividend to all United States citizens as compensation for \\"loss of his or her natural inheritance, by the introduction of the system of landed property\\" (Agrarian Justice, 1795). French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte echoed Paine's sentiments and commented that 'man is entitled by birthright to a share of the Earth's produce sufficient to fill the needs of his existence' (Herold, 1955). The American economist Henry George advocated for a dividend paid to all citizens from the revenue generated by a land value tax. In 1963, Robert Theobald published the book Free Men and Free Markets, in which he advocated a guaranteed minimum income (the origin of the modern version of the phrase). In 1966, the Cloward‚ÄìPiven strategy advocated \\"overloading\\" the US welfare system to force its collapse in the hopes that it would be replaced by \\"a guaranteed annual income and thus an end to poverty\\". In his final book Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community? (1967), Martin Luther King Jr. wroteMartin Luther King jr., Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community? (New York: Harper & Row, 1967) In 1968, James Tobin, Paul Samuelson, John Kenneth Galbraith and another 1,200 economists signed a document calling for the US Congress to introduce in that year a system of income guarantees and supplements.Economists' Statement on Guaranteed Annual Income, 1/15/1968-4/18/1969 folder, General Correspondence Series, Papers of John Kenneth Galbraith, John F.

The proposal by Nixon passed in the House but never made it out of committee in the Senate. In 1973, Daniel Patrick Moynihan wrote The Politics of a Guaranteed Income, in which he advocated the guaranteed minimum income and discussed Richard Nixon's Guaranteed Annual Income (GAI) proposal. In 1987, New Zealand's Labour Finance Minister Roger Douglas announced a Guaranteed Minimum Family Income Scheme to accompany a new flat tax. Both were quashed by then Prime Minister David Lange, who sacked Douglas.\\"New Zealand Is Jolted By a Speedy Decontrol\\", Seth Mydans, The New York Times (24 February 1988) In his 1994 \\"autobiographical dialog\\", classical liberal Friedrich Hayek stated: \\"I have always said that I am in favor of a minimum income for every person in the country\\".Hayek on Hayek: An Autobiographical Dialogue by F. A. Hayek, edited by Stephen Kresge and Leif Wenar (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1994) In 2013, the Equal Life Foundation published the Living Income Guaranteed Proposal, illustrating a practical way to implement and fund a minimum guaranteed income. In 2017, Harry A. Shamir (US) published the book Consumerism, or Capitalism Without Crises, in which the concept was promoted by another label, as a way to enable our civilization to survive in an era of automation and computerization and large scale unemployment. The book also innovates a method to fund the process, tapping into the underground economy and volunteerism. Other modern advocates include Ay≈üe Buƒüra (Turkey), The Green Economics Institute (GEI), and Andrew Coyne (Canada).\\"A minimum income, not wage, is a fairer way to distribute wealth\\" The Financial Post (8 April 2013) Funding Tax revenues would fund the majority of GMI proposals. As most GMI proposals seek to create an earnings floor close to or above poverty lines amongst all citizens, the fiscal burden would require equally broad tax sources, such as income taxes or VATs. To varying degrees, a GMI might be funded through the reduction or elimination of other social security programs, such as unemployment insurance. Another approach for funding is to acknowledge that all modern economies use fiat money and thus taxation is not necessary for funding. However, the fact that there are no financial constraints does not mean other constraints, such as on real resources, do not exist. A likely outcome based on the economic theory known as Modern Monetary Theory would be a moderate increase in taxation to ensure the extra income would not cause demand-pull inflation. This hypothetical Chartalist approach can be seen in the implementation of quantitative easing programs where, in the United States, over three trillion dollarsFredgraph were created without requiring taxes. Examples around the world=Cyprus In July 2013, the Cypriot government unveiled a plan to reform the welfare system in Cyprus and create a Guaranteed Minimum Income for all citizens. France In 1988, France was one of the first countries to implement a minimum income, called the Revenu minimum d'insertion. In 2009, it was turned into Revenu de solidarit√© active (RSA), a new system that aimed to solve the poverty trap by providing low-wage workers a complementary income to encourage activity. United States The United States has multiple social programs that provide guaranteed minimum incomes for individuals meeting certain criteria such as assets or disability. For instance, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is a United States government program that provides stipends to low-income people who are either aged (65 or older), blind, or disabled. SSI was created in 1974 to replace federal-state adult assistance programs that served the same purpose. Today the program provides benefits to approximately eight million Americans. Another such program is Social Security Disability Insurance (SSD or SSDI), a payroll tax- funded, federal insurance program. It is managed by the Social Security Administration and is designed to provide income supplements to people who are restricted in their ability to work because of a disability, usually a physical disability. SSD can be supplied on either a temporary or permanent basis, usually directly correlated to whether the person's disability is temporary or permanent. An early guaranteed minimum income program in the U.S. was the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), established by the Social Security Act. Where previously the responsibility to assist needy children lay in the hands of the states, AFDC transferred that authority to the federal government. Over time, the AFDC was often criticized for creating disincentives to work, leading to many arguing for its replacement. In the 1970s, President Richard M. Nixon proposed the Family Assistance Program (FAP), which would replace the AFDC. FAP was intended to fix many of the problems of the AFDC, particularly the anti-work structure. Presidential nominee George McGovern also proposed a minimum income‚Äîin the form of a Universal Tax Credit. Ultimately, neither of these programs were implemented. Throughout the decade, many other experimental minimum income programs were carried out in cities throughout the country, such as the Seattle-Denver Income Maintenance Experiments. In 1996, under President Bill Clinton, the AFDC was replaced with the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. This would block grant funds to the states to allow them to decide how aid would be distributed. Another guaranteed minimum income program in the U.S. is the Earned Income Tax Credit. This is a refundable tax credit that gives poorer families cash assistance every year. The EITC avoids the welfare trap by subsidizing income, rather than replacing it.  Brazil  Minimum income has been increasingly accepted by the Brazilian government. In 2004, President Lula da Silva signed into law a bill to establish a universal basic income. This law is primarily implemented through the Bolsa Fam√≠lia program. Under this program, poorer families receive a direct cash payment via a government issued debit card. Bolsa Fam√≠lia is a conditional cash transfer program, meaning that beneficiaries receive their aid if they accomplish certain actions. Families who receive the aid must put their children in school and participate in vaccination programs. If they do not meet these requirements, they are cut off from aid. The program has been criticised as vote-buying, trading productive individuals' earning for the votes of welfare recipients As of 2011, approximately 50 million people, or a quarter of Brazil's population, were participating in Bolsa Fam√≠lia.  Canada  Canada has experimented with minimum income trials. During the Mincome experiment in Manitoba in the 1970s, Mincome provided lower-income families with cash transfers to keep them out of poverty. The program resulted in shuttering of the program due to budget shortfalls or a change in government. The province of Ontario began a minimum income experiment in 2017. Approximately 4000 citizens began to receive a stipend based on their family situation and income. Recipients of this program could receive upwards of $10,000 per year. Government researchers used this pilot as a way of testing to see if a minimum income can help people meet their basic needs. On August 31, 2018, following a change in government, incoming Premier Doug Ford announced that the pilot would be cancelled at the end of the current fiscal year. China China's Minimum Livelihood Guarantee, also called dibao, is a means-tested social assistance scheme introduced in 1993 and expanded to all Chinese cities in 1999.  Saudi Arabia  Saudi Arabia has a Citizen‚Äôs Account Program which provides a basic income to registered citizens. In December 2017, immediately before the program began, more than 3.7 million households had registered, representing 13 million people, or more than half the population., between one fifth and one third of Saudi residents are estimated to be non-citizens.The Economist magazine lists an estimated nine million: out of a population of 30 million:  Spain  In Spain, the ingreso m√≠nimo vital is an economic benefit guaranteed by the Social security in Spain in its modality no contributory. The IMV is defined as a \\"subjective right\\" and is intended to prevent poverty and social exclusion of people who live alone or integrated into a coexistence unit when they are in a situation of vulnerability due to lack of sufficient financial resources to cover their basic needs. The benefit, which is not fixed and varies depending on various factors, ranges between 462 and 1015 euros per month, is expected to cover 850,000 households (approximately 2.5 million people) and will cost the government 3 billion euros per year.

Intuitively, a matrix interpreted as a block matrix can be visualized as the original matrix with a collection of horizontal and vertical lines, which break it up, or partition it, into a collection of smaller matrices. Any matrix may be interpreted as a block matrix in one or more ways, with each interpretation defined by how its rows and columns are partitioned. This notion can be made more precise for an n by m matrix M by partitioning n into a collection rowgroups, and then partitioning m into a collection colgroups. The original matrix is then considered as the \\"total\\" of these groups, in the sense that the (i, j) entry of the original matrix corresponds in a 1-to-1 way with some (s, t) offset entry of some (x,y), where x \\\\in \\\\mathit{rowgroups} and y \\\\in \\\\mathit{colgroups}. Block matrix algebra arises in general from biproducts in categories of matrices. Example A 168√ó168 element block matrix with 12√ó12, 12√ó24, 24x12, and 24√ó24 sub-Matrices. Non-zero elements are in blue, zero elements are grayed. The matrix :\\\\mathbf{P} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 2 & 7 \\\\ 1 & 5 & 6 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\ 3 & 3 & 6 & 7 \\\\end{bmatrix} can be partitioned into four 2√ó2 blocks : \\\\mathbf{P}_{11} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 1 & 5 \\\\end{bmatrix},\\\\quad \\\\mathbf{P}_{12} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 7\\\\ 6 & 2 \\\\end{bmatrix},\\\\quad \\\\mathbf{P}_{21} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 3 \\\\ 3 & 3 \\\\end{bmatrix},\\\\quad \\\\mathbf{P}_{22} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 4 & 5 \\\\ 6 & 7 \\\\end{bmatrix}. The partitioned matrix can then be written as :\\\\mathbf{P} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{P}_{11} & \\\\mathbf{P}_{12} \\\\ \\\\mathbf{P}_{21} & \\\\mathbf{P}_{22} \\\\end{bmatrix}. Block matrix multiplication It is possible to use a block partitioned matrix product that involves only algebra on submatrices of the factors. The partitioning of the factors is not arbitrary, however, and requires \\"conformable partitions\\" between two matrices A and B such that all submatrix products that will be used are defined. Given an (m \\\\times p) matrix \\\\mathbf{A} with q row partitions and s column partitions :\\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{A}_{11} & \\\\mathbf{A}_{12} & \\\\cdots & \\\\mathbf{A}_{1s} \\\\ \\\\mathbf{A}_{21} & \\\\mathbf{A}_{22} & \\\\cdots & \\\\mathbf{A}_{2s} \\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\ \\\\mathbf{A}_{q1} & \\\\mathbf{A}_{q2} & \\\\cdots & \\\\mathbf{A}_{qs} \\\\end{bmatrix} and a (p \\\\times n) matrix \\\\mathbf{B} with s row partitions and r column partitions :\\\\mathbf{B} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{B}_{11} & \\\\mathbf{B}_{12} & \\\\cdots &\\\\mathbf{B}_{1r} \\\\ \\\\mathbf{B}_{21} & \\\\mathbf{B}_{22} & \\\\cdots &\\\\mathbf{B}_{2r} \\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots &\\\\vdots \\\\ \\\\mathbf{B}_{s1} & \\\\mathbf{B}_{s2} & \\\\cdots &\\\\mathbf{B}_{sr} \\\\end{bmatrix}, that are compatible with the partitions of A, the matrix product : \\\\mathbf{C}=\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{B} can be formed blockwise, yielding \\\\mathbf{C} as an (m \\\\times n) matrix with q row partitions and r column partitions. The matrices in the resulting matrix \\\\mathbf{C} are calculated by multiplying: : \\\\mathbf{C}_{q r} = \\\\sum^s_{i=1}\\\\mathbf{A}_{q i}\\\\mathbf{B}_{i r}. Or, using the Einstein notation that implicitly sums over repeated indices: : \\\\mathbf{C}_{q r} = \\\\mathbf{A}_{q i}\\\\mathbf{B}_{i r}. Block matrix inversion If a matrix is partitioned into four blocks, it can be inverted blockwise as follows: :\\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{A} & \\\\mathbf{B} \\\\ \\\\mathbf{C} & \\\\mathbf{D} \\\\end{bmatrix}^{-1} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{A}^{-1} + \\\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{B}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{D} - \\\\mathbf{CA}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{B}\\\\right)^{-1}\\\\mathbf{CA}^{-1} & -\\\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{B}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{D} - \\\\mathbf{CA}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{B}\\\\right)^{-1} \\\\ -\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{D}-\\\\mathbf{CA}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{B}\\\\right)^{-1}\\\\mathbf{CA}^{-1} & \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{D} - \\\\mathbf{CA}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{B}\\\\right)^{-1} \\\\end{bmatrix}, where A, B, C and D have arbitrary size. (A and D must be square, so that they can be inverted. Furthermore, A and D ‚àí CA‚àí1B must be invertible. ) Equivalently, by permuting the blocks: :\\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{A} & \\\\mathbf{B} \\\\ \\\\mathbf{C} & \\\\mathbf{D} \\\\end{bmatrix}^{-1} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{A} - \\\\mathbf{BD}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{C}\\\\right)^{-1} & -\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{A}-\\\\mathbf{BD}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{C}\\\\right)^{-1}\\\\mathbf{BD}^{-1} \\\\ -\\\\mathbf{D}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{C}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{A} - \\\\mathbf{BD}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{C}\\\\right)^{-1} & \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{D}^{-1} + \\\\mathbf{D}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{C}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{A} - \\\\mathbf{BD}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{C}\\\\right)^{-1}\\\\mathbf{BD}^{-1} \\\\end{bmatrix}. Here, D and A ‚àí BD‚àí1C must be invertible. For more details and derivation using block LDU decomposition, see Schur complement. Block diagonal matrices  A block diagonal matrix is a block matrix that is a square matrix such that the main- diagonal blocks are square matrices and all off-diagonal blocks are zero matrices. That is, a block diagonal matrix A has the form :\\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{A}_1 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\\\mathbf{A}_2 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & \\\\mathbf{A}_n \\\\end{bmatrix} where Ak is a square matrix for all k = 1, ..., n. In other words, matrix A is the direct sum of A1, ..., An. It can also be indicated as A1 ‚äï A2 ‚äï ... ‚äï An or diag(A1, A2, ..., An) (the latter being the same formalism used for a diagonal matrix). Any square matrix can trivially be considered a block diagonal matrix with only one block. For the determinant and trace, the following properties hold :\\\\begin{align} \\\\det\\\\mathbf{A} &= \\\\det\\\\mathbf{A}_1 \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times \\\\det\\\\mathbf{A}_n, \\\\ \\\\operatorname{tr}\\\\mathbf{A} &= \\\\operatorname{tr} \\\\mathbf{A}_1 + \\\\cdots + \\\\operatorname{tr} \\\\mathbf{A}_n.\\\\end{align} A block diagonal matrix is invertible if and only if each of its main-diagonal blocks are invertible, and in this case its inverse is another block diagonal matrix given by :\\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\mathbf{A}_{1} & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\\\mathbf{A}_{2} & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & \\\\mathbf{A}_{n} \\\\end{pmatrix}^{-1} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\mathbf{A}_{1}^{-1} & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\\\mathbf{A}_{2}^{-1} & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & \\\\mathbf{A}_{n}^{-1} \\\\end{pmatrix}. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A are simply those of A_{1} and A_{2} and ... and A_{n} combined. Block tridiagonal matrices A block tridiagonal matrix is another special block matrix, which is just like the block diagonal matrix a square matrix, having square matrices (blocks) in the lower diagonal, main diagonal and upper diagonal, with all other blocks being zero matrices. It is essentially a tridiagonal matrix but has submatrices in places of scalars. A block tridiagonal matrix A has the form :\\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{B}_{1} & \\\\mathbf{C}_{1} & & & \\\\cdots & & 0 \\\\ \\\\mathbf{A}_{2} & \\\\mathbf{B}_{2} & \\\\mathbf{C}_{2} & & & & \\\\ & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & & & \\\\vdots \\\\ & & \\\\mathbf{A}_{k} & \\\\mathbf{B}_{k} & \\\\mathbf{C}_{k} & & \\\\ \\\\vdots & & & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & \\\\ & & & & \\\\mathbf{A}_{n-1} & \\\\mathbf{B}_{n-1} & \\\\mathbf{C}_{n-1} \\\\ 0 & & \\\\cdots & & & \\\\mathbf{A}_{n} & \\\\mathbf{B}_{n} \\\\end{bmatrix} where Ak, Bk and Ck are square sub-matrices of the lower, main and upper diagonal respectively. Block tridiagonal matrices are often encountered in numerical solutions of engineering problems (e.g., computational fluid dynamics). Optimized numerical methods for LU factorization are available and hence efficient solution algorithms for equation systems with a block tridiagonal matrix as coefficient matrix. The Thomas algorithm, used for efficient solution of equation systems involving a tridiagonal matrix can also be applied using matrix operations to block tridiagonal matrices (see also Block LU decomposition). Block Toeplitz matrices A block Toeplitz matrix is another special block matrix, which contains blocks that are repeated down the diagonals of the matrix, as a Toeplitz matrix has elements repeated down the diagonal. The individual block matrix elements, Aij, must also be a Toeplitz matrix. A block Toeplitz matrix A has the form :\\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{A}_{(1,1)} & \\\\mathbf{A}_{(1,2)} & & & \\\\cdots & \\\\mathbf{A}_{(1,n-1)} & \\\\mathbf{A}_{(1,n)} \\\\ \\\\mathbf{A}_{(2,1)} & \\\\mathbf{A}_{(1,1)} & \\\\mathbf{A}_{(1,2)} & & & & \\\\mathbf{A}_{(1,n-1)} \\\\ & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & & & \\\\vdots \\\\ & & \\\\mathbf{A}_{(2,1)} & \\\\mathbf{A}_{(1,1)} & \\\\mathbf{A}_{(1,2)} & & \\\\ \\\\vdots & & & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & \\\\ \\\\mathbf{A}_{(n-1,1)} & & & & \\\\mathbf{A}_{(2,1)} & \\\\mathbf{A}_{(1,1)} & \\\\mathbf{A}_{(1,2)} \\\\ \\\\mathbf{A}_{(n,1)} & \\\\mathbf{A}_{(n-1,1)} & \\\\cdots & & & \\\\mathbf{A}_{(2,1)} & \\\\mathbf{A}_{(1,1)} \\\\end{bmatrix}. Block transpose A special form of matrix transpose can also be defined for block matrices, where individual blocks are reordered but not transposed. Let A=(B_{ij}) be a k \\\\times l block matrix with m \\\\times n blocks B_{ij}, the block transpose of A is the l \\\\times k block matrix A^\\\\mathcal{B} with m \\\\times n blocks (A^\\\\mathcal{B})_{ij}=B_{ji}. As with the conventional trace operator, the block transpose is a linear mapping such that (A + C)^\\\\mathcal{B} = A^\\\\mathcal{B} + C^\\\\mathcal{B} . However in general the property (A C)^\\\\mathcal{B} = C^\\\\mathcal{B} A^\\\\mathcal{B} does not hold unless the blocks of A and C commute. Direct sum For any arbitrary matrices A (of size m √ó n) and B (of size p √ó q), we have the direct sum of A and B, denoted by A \\\\oplus B and defined as : \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\oplus \\\\mathbf{B} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & \\\\cdots & a_{1n} & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\cdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\cdots & \\\\vdots \\\\ a_{m1} & \\\\cdots & a_{mn} & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & b_{11} & \\\\cdots & b_{1q} \\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\cdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\cdots & \\\\vdots \\\\ 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & b_{p1} & \\\\cdots & b_{pq} \\\\end{bmatrix}. For instance, : \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 3 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\oplus \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 2 & 3 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 6 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}. This operation generalizes naturally to arbitrary dimensioned arrays (provided that A and B have the same number of dimensions). Note that any element in the direct sum of two vector spaces of matrices could be represented as a direct sum of two matrices. Direct productApplication In linear algebra terms, the use of a block matrix corresponds to having a linear mapping thought of in terms of corresponding 'bunches' of basis vectors. That again matches the idea of having distinguished direct sum decompositions of the domain and range. It is always particularly significant if a block is the zero matrix; that carries the information that a summand maps into a sub-sum. Given the interpretation via linear mappings and direct sums, there is a special type of block matrix that occurs for square matrices (the case m = n). For those we can assume an interpretation as an endomorphism of an n-dimensional space V; the block structure in which the bunching of rows and columns is the same is of importance because it corresponds to having a single direct sum decomposition on V (rather than two). In that case, for example, the diagonal blocks in the obvious sense are all square. This type of structure is required to describe the Jordan normal form. This technique is used to cut down calculations of matrices, column-row expansions, and many computer science applications, including VLSI chip design.

Part of the moor, at above sea level, is the highest point in the Peak District, the highest point in Derbyshire, and the highest point in the East Midlands. In excellent weather conditions the city of Manchester and the Greater Manchester conurbation can be seen, as well as Winter Hill near Bolton, and the mountains of Snowdonia in North Wales. To the north across the Snake Pass lie the high moors of Bleaklow and Black Hill, which are of similar elevation. Kinder Scout featured on the BBC television programme Seven Natural Wonders (2005) as one of the wonders of the Midlands, though it is considered by many to be in Northern England, lying between the cities of Manchester and Sheffield. The history and meaning of the name have been studied by Broderick. In chronostratigraphy, the British sub- stage of the Carboniferous period, the 'Kinderscoutian' derives its name from Kinder Scout. Public access Kinder Scout is accessible from the villages of Hayfield and Edale in the High Peak of Derbyshire. It is a popular hiking location and the Pennine Way crosses Kinder Scout and the moors to the north. This has resulted in the erosion of the underlying peat, prompting work by Derbyshire County Council and the Peak District National Park to repair it, in conjunction with the landowner, the National Trust.Peak District National Park Authority, Landscape Strategy and Action Plan, September 2009 (section on Dark Peak) The plateau was the location of the mass trespass in 1932. From the National Park's inception, a large area of the high moorland north of Edale was designated as 'Open Country'. In 2003, the \\"right to roam\\" on uncultivated land was enshrined into law, and this area of open country has been significantly extended. Parts of the Kinder Scout plateau (except legal rights of way) are still occasionally closed for conservation, public safety, grouse shooting or fire prevention reasons, but prior notice is generally given on the Peak District National Park Authority's website. Landmarks=Kinder Downfall Kinder Downfall is the tallest waterfall in the Peak District, with a 30-metre fall. It lies on the River Kinder, where it flows west over one of the gritstone cliffs on the plateau edge. The waterfall was formerly known as Kinder Scut, and it is from this that the plateau derives its name. Although usually little more than a trickle in summer, in spate conditions it is impressive. In certain wind conditions (notably when there is a strong westerly wind), the water is blown back on itself, and the resulting cloud of spray can be seen from several miles away. In cold winters the waterfall freezes providing local mountaineers with an icy challenge that can be climbed with ice axes, ropes and crampons. Below the Downfall the River Kinder flows into Kinder Reservoir. The gritstone edges Some of Kinder's many gritstone cliffs were featured in the first rock-climbing guide to the Peak District, Some Gritstone Climbs, published in 1913 and written by John Laycock. Edale Cross Edale Cross The Edale Cross lies immediately south of Kinder Scout, under Kinder Low and on the former Hayfield to Edale road. It marks the former junction of the three wards of the Forest of Peak: Glossop and Longdendale, Hopedale and Campagna. The first cross on the site may have been set up by the Abbots of Basingwerk Abbey to mark the southern boundary of their land, granted in 1157. The date of the current cross is unknown, although an adjoining plaque and its listing as a Scheduled Monument date it to the mediaeval period. At some point it fell down, and was re-erected in 1810, when the date and initials JG, WD, GH, JH and JS were carved into it. These stand for John Gee, William Drinkwater, George and Joseph Hadfield and John Shirt, local farmers of the day who raised the cross. Mermaid's Pool Mermaid's Pool, a small pool below Kinder Downfall, is said, according to legend, to be inhabited by a mermaid who will grant immortality upon whoever sees her on Easter Eve. Kinderlow bowl barrow A bowl barrow, thought to be unexcavated and to date from the Bronze Age, stands on Kinder Low, a western projection of the main massif above Hayfield. View Major English and Welsh peaks visible (in ideal conditions) from Kinder Scout include (clockwise from west) Winter Hill (), Pendle Hill (), Ingleborough (), Whernside (), Pen-y-ghent (), Fountains Fell (), Buckden Pike (), Great Whernside (), Bleaklow (), Margery Hill (), the Weaver Hills (), Axe Edge (), The Roaches (), Shutlingsloe (), Shining Tor (), the Long Mynd (), Stiperstones (), Corndon Hill (), Cilfaesty Hill (), Moel y Golfa (), Plynlimon (), Cadair Berwyn (), Beeston Castle (), Alderley Edge (), Arenig Fawr (), Moel Famau (), Snowdon (), Glyder Fach (), Tryfan (), Y Garn (), Carnedd Llewelyn () and Foel-fras (). Tone poem The orchestral sketch Kinder Scout was composed by Patrick Hadley, written for the Buxton Spa Orchestra and its occasional director George Cathie. It was first performed in Buxton in September 1923. Hadley had an emotional attachment to the Derbyshire peaks, which are also celebrated in his later cantata The Hills (1943).Foreman, Lewis.

In this device, UIQ runs on top of Symbian. Screenshot of UIQ v3.1, showing Agenda UIQ (formerly known as User Interface Quartz) was a software platform based upon Symbian OS, created by UIQ Technology AB. It is a graphical user interface layer that provides additional components to the core operating system, to enable the development of feature-rich mobile phones that are open to expanded capabilities through third-party applications. History UIQ was the result of 'Quartz', a user interface for pen PDAs that was one of the three provisional interfaces that were designed by Symbian Ltd. The first three Quartz phones never made it to market, including Psion's \\"Odin\\" in a joint venture with Motorola, which was cancelled in January 2001, causing Psion's shares to deteriorate.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1196220.stm Engineers thereafter created a lighter version of the software which was presented in 2002,https://www.geek.com/blurb/check-out-symbians-new- uiq-548300/ and first shipped that year with Sony Ericsson P800. Sony Ericsson was the main OEM using the UIQ platform in its products. Motorola also developed some products using UIQ, but abandoned the platform in 2003 in favour of Linux, along with its stake in Symbian Ltd. In 2007, Motorola returned to UIQ with the launch of Motorola RIZR Z8.https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/10/15/motorola_uiq_investment/ Nokia, which was using the competing Series 60 (later S60) platform, created one UIQ device called Nokia 6708, which is a rebadged BenQ P31,https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1000858/nokia-apparently- ashamed-of-uiq-phone and was only released in the Asia-Pacific region.http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/news/item/Nokia_China_announce_N6708_UIQ_Phone.phphttps://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1000858/nokia- apparently-ashamed-of-uiq-phone Sony Ericsson bought UIQ Technology in November 2006, and the next year, Motorola bought half of it.http://www.itpro.co.uk/130145/motorola-to-buy-half-of-uiq-from-sony- ericsson After the creation of the Symbian Foundation and its favouring of S60 as their user interface of choice, UIQ's future was uncertain, as it could no longer develop the software for the Symbian operating system. Many Motorola UIQ devices planned for 2009 were cancelled, including Motorola Razr3, codenamed \\"Ruby\\".https://www.slashgear.com/motorola-razr3-aka-ruby-axed-in- uiq-to-android-transition-2824486/ UIQ Technology filed for bankruptcy in January 2009, which effectively ended the UIQ platform.The end of UIQ . Esato. Retrieved on 2013-12-08. Sony Ericsson moved on to Windows Mobile and the open source Symbian from the Symbian Foundation, whilst Motorola adopted Google's Android software.http://www.brighthand.com/news/uiq-technology-files-for- bankruptcy/ UIQ 3.3 was the last version of the platform, based upon Symbian OS v9.3. Developers that developed on the UIQ 3.x platform had a much better story than with previous releases, since all UIQ 3.x phones were served by a single, core SDK.  UIQ programming languages  Native applications can be written in C++ using the Symbian/UIQ SDK. All UIQ-based phones (2.x and 3.x) also support Java applications. UIQ phones employ touch screens with a resolution of 208√ó320 pixels (UIQ 1.x & 2.x) and 240√ó320 (UIQ 3.x). Depending on the phone, the color depth is 12-bit (4096 colors), 16-bit (65536 colors), 18-bit (262144 colors), and 24-bit (16,777,216 colors) on some newer phones. For developers, the significant items are: * Single SDK model - developers targeting core UIQ features can use the UIQ SDK to target any UIQ 3 device. Extensions targeting specific device features (such as WiFi, etc.) are available from phone manufacturers' websites. * Increased tools support - developers can use whichever tools they are familiar with (DevStudio, Eclipse, Carbide, CodeWarrior, NetBeans). Many of these tools are beginning to support extensive RAD features for both C++ and Java developers. Visual Basic programmers can use NS Basic/Symbian OS. * High volume, mid-range devices are now possible, to significantly increase the potential customer base.

He was Chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) from 2004 to 2005 and again from 18 October 2008 to 13 November 2009. He served as Federal Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, as well as Vice-Chancellor, from 2005 to 2007. Early life and education M√ºntefering was born in Neheim (now part of Arnsberg). He trained as an industrial salesman and worked for local metalwork companies.Franz M√ºntefering Financial Times, September 9, 2008. Political career M√ºntefering joined the SPD in 1966. He was a member of the Bundestag from 1975 to 1992 and again since 1998; from 1995 to 1998 he was a member of the Landtag (state parliament) of North Rhine-Westphalia. M√ºntefering was Bundesgesch√§ftsf√ºhrer (executive director) of the national SPD from 1995 to 1998. In this capacity, he managed the 1998 campaign that returned the SPD to power in the federal government after 16 years in opposition.William Boston (March 22, 2002) Schroeder's Campaign Manager Testifies in SPD Finance Scandal Wall Street Journal. From 1998 until 1999, M√ºntefering briefly held the post of Minister of Transportation and Construction in the first cabinet of Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der. In this capacity, he organized the government's move from Bonn to Berlin.Roger Cohen (August 24, 1999) Schroder Moves, and So Does Germany's Center of Gravity New York Times. M√ºntefering was the first to hold the new post of SPD Secretary General from 1999 to 2002, and thereafter became leader of the SPD parliamentary group in the Bundestag. In February 2004 he was designated to succeed Schr√∂der as party chairman in March 2004.Udo Kempf/ Hans-Georg Merz (eds.): Kanzler und Minister 1998-2005. Biographisches Lexikon der deutschen Bundesregierungen. Wiesbaden: VS Verlag f√ºr Sozialwissenschaften, 2008, p. 243. Following Schr√∂der‚Äôs defeat in the close 2005 elections, M√ºntefering helped form a grand coalition under the new Chancellor Angela Merkel and her center-right CDU/CSU parties.Nicholas Kulish and Judy Dempsey (November 14, 2007) German Official Resigns in Blow to Coalition New York Times. During the coalition talks, on 31 October 2005, M√ºntefering's favoured candidate for Secretary General of the SPD, Kajo Wasserh√∂vel, was defeated by the left-wing candidate Andrea Nahles in a preliminary internal election. M√ºntefering subsequently announced his intention to resign as SPD Chairman, and was succeeded by Matthias Platzeck at the next party convention on 15 November 2005. M√ºntefering became Federal Minister of Labour and Social Affairs and Vice-Chancellor in the cabinet of Chancellor Angela Merkel on 22 November 2005. During his time in office, the government agreed to raise the retirement age in steps to 67 from 65 by 2029. After two years in those posts, M√ºntefering's spokesman said on 13 November 2007 that M√ºntefering would resign from them later in the month. The decision was said to be based on \\"purely familial reasons\\".\\"German Labor Minister M√ºntefering to Resign\\", Deutsche Welle, November 13, 2007. Later in the day, M√ºntefering said that he would leave his positions in the government on 21 November attributing his decision to the illness of his wife, Ankepetra, who was suffering from cancer.Andreas Cremer and Brian Parkin, \\"Muentefering, Vice-Chancellor Under Merkel, Quits\\", Bloomberg.com, 13 November 2007. Upon leaving office on 21 November 2007, he was replaced as Vice-Chancellor by Frank-Walter Steinmeier and as Minister of Labor by Olaf Scholz, both of whom are also members of the SPD.\\"Merkel defends record as Germany's tense governing coalition hits 2-year mark\\", Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), 21 November 2007. M√ºntefering's wife Ankepetra died on 31 July 2008. Following her death, M√ºntefering decided to return to active politics and was elected Chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany on 18 October 2008.Judy Dempsey, \\"German foreign minister picked to challenge Merkel\\", International Herald Tribune, 7 September 2008. On 7 September 2008, Kurt Beck had resigned as SPD Chairman.\\"German SPD party reshuffles leadership, with eye on election\\", Xinhua, 7 September 2008. Following the SPD's defeat in the federal election of 2009, M√ºntefering resigned from the position of party chairman of the Social Democratic Party. Political positions In April 2005, M√ºntefering criticized the market economy of Germany and proposed more state involvement to promote economic justice. In this speech, he described private equity firms as \\"locusts\\". He subsequently published a \\"locust list\\" of companies, which he circulated within the SPD.http://service.spiegel.de/cache/international/0,1518,354733,00.html This began a debate which dominated the national news, being the subject of front- page articles and covered on the main television news broadcasts nearly every day. M√ºntefering's suggestions were criticized by employers and many economists, but met with popular support (up to 75% in some opinion polls). The word has since found its way into German language as an established term for shady financial business practices. Life after politics Since leaving active politics, M√ºntefering has held a variety of honorary positions, including the following: * Berlin Demography Forum, Chairman of the Advisory Board * Friedrich Ebert Foundation (FES), MemberMembers Friedrich Ebert Foundation (FES). * Witten/Herdecke University, Member of the Board of Trustees (since 2014)Franz M√ºntefering neu im Kuratorium der Universit√§t Witten/Herdecke Witten/Herdecke University, press release of November 14, 2014 * Herbert and Greta Wehner Foundation, Member of the Board (since 2002) * Deutsche Hospiz- und PalliativStiftung, Member of the Board of TrusteesBoard of Trustees Deutsche Hospiz- und PalliativStiftung. M√ºntefering was a SPD delegate to the Federal Convention for the purpose of electing the President of Germany in 2017.Wahl der Mitglieder f√ºr die 16. Bundesversammlung Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia, decision of 14 December 2016. Controversy In 2002, news surfaced that, while M√ºntefering was head of the SPD in the North Rhine-Westphalia during the 1990s, local officials in the city of Cologne and possibly elsewhere allegedly engaged in corruption that involved illegal political donations from builders of waste-disposal facilities. M√ºntefering denied any knowledge of the anonymous donations and launched an internal investigation into all contracts awarded for the construction of waste- disposal facilities in North Rhine-Westphalia in the 1990s. On March 22, he testified about the affair before Parliament's investigative committee.

For example, a list of three countries might be punctuated either as \\"France, Italy and Spain\\" (without the serial comma) or \\"France, Italy, and Spain\\" (with the serial comma).The terms Oxford comma and Harvard comma come from Oxford University Press and Harvard University Press, where serial-comma use is the house style.Sometimes, the term also denotes the comma that might come before etc. at the end of a list (see the Australian Government Publishing Service's Style Manual for Authors, Editors, and Printers, below). Such an extension is reasonable, since etc. is the abbreviation of the Latin phrase et cetera (lit. and other things).The serial comma sometimes refers to any of the separator commas in a list, but this is a rare, old-fashioned usage. Herein, the term is used only as defined above. Opinions among writers and editors differ on whether to use the serial comma, and usage also differs somewhat between regional varieties of English. British English allows constructions with or without this comma, while in American English it is common and sometimes even considered mandatory to use the comma. A majority of American style guides mandate use of the serial comma, including APA style, The Chicago Manual of Style, Garner's Modern American Usage, The MLA Style Manual, Strunk and White's Elements of Style and the U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual. By contrast, the Associated Press Stylebook advises against it. In Canada, the stylebook published by The Canadian Press advises against it. Most British style guides do not mandate its use. The Economist Style Guide notes that most British writers only use it where necessary to avoid ambiguity. However, a few British style guides mandate it, most notably The Oxford Style Manual.The Oxford Style Manual, 2002: \\"The presence or lack of a comma before and or or ... has become the subject of much spirited debate. For a century it has been part of OUP style ..., to the extent that the convention has come to be called the 'Oxford comma'. But it is commonly used by many other publishers here and abroad, and forms a routine part of style in US and Canadian English\\" (p. 121). The Oxford Companion to the English Language notes that, \\"Usage varies as to the inclusion of a comma before and in the last item ... This practice is controversial and is known as the serial comma or Oxford comma, because it is part of the house style of Oxford University Press.\\"McArthur, Tom, \\"Comma.\\" Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language. 1998. Encyclopedia.com. There are cases in which the use of the serial comma can avoid ambiguity (see Resolving ambiguity) and also instances in which its use can introduce ambiguity (see Creating ambiguity).  Arguments for and against  Common arguments for consistent use of the serial comma: # Use of the comma is consistent with the conventional practice of the region.The Oxford Style Manual, 2002: \\"But it is commonly used by many other publishers here and abroad, and forms a routine part of style in US and Canadian English\\" (p. 121). # It matches the spoken cadence of sentences better.The Oxford Style Manual, 2002; from discussion of the serial comma: \\"If the last item in a list has emphasis equal to the previous ones, it needs a comma to create a pause of equal weight to those that came before\\" (p. 121). The University of Oxford itself is quite distinct from Oxford University Press, and gives different advice. See University of Oxford Writing and Style Guide, below in this article. # It can resolve ambiguity (see examples below).The Oxford Style Manual, 2002; from discussion of the serial comma: \\"The last comma serves also to resolve ambiguity, particularly when any of the items are compound terms joined by a conjunction\\" (p. 122).U.S. House Legislative Counsel's Manual on Drafting Style, No. HLC 104-1, ¬ß 351 at 58 (1995) # Its use is consistent with other means of separating items in a list (for example, when semicolons are used to separate items, one is always included before the last item).The Oxford Style Manual, 2002; in discussion of the semicolon, examples are given in which complex listed items are separated by semicolons, with the same structure and on the same principles as are consistently recommended for use of the comma as a list separator in the preceding section (pp. 124‚Äì5) # Its omission may suggest a stronger connection between the last two items in a series than actually exists.\\"Rhetorical Grammar: Grammatical Choices, Rhetorical Effects. 4th Ed.\\", 2003; This punctuation style, however, does have a drawback: It may imply a closer connection than actually exists between the last two elements of the series (p. 89) Common arguments against consistent use of the serial comma: # Use of the comma is inconsistent with the conventional practice of the region.Ridout, R., and Witting, C., The Facts of English, Pan, 1973, p. 79: \\"Usually in such lists 'and' is not preceded by a comma, [‚Ä¶]\\". # It can introduce ambiguity (see examples below). # Where space is at a premium, the comma adds unnecessary bulk to the text. Many sources are against both systematic use and systematic avoidance of the serial comma, making recommendations in a more nuanced way (see #Recommendations by style guides and subsequent sections). Ambiguity=Resolving ambiguity Omitting the serial comma may create ambiguity. Writers who normally avoid the serial comma often use one when it avoids ambiguity. Consider this apocryphal book dedication:Based on example quoted in :To my parents, Ayn Rand and God. There is ambiguity about the writer's parentage, because \\"Ayn Rand and God\\" can be read as in apposition to my parents, leading the reader to believe that the writer claims Ayn Rand and God are the parents. A comma before and removes the ambiguity: :To my parents, Ayn Rand, and God. But lists can also be written in other ways that eliminate the ambiguity without introducing the serial comma, such as by changing the word order or by using other punctuation, or none, to introduce or delimit them (though the emphasis may thereby be changed): :To God, Ayn Rand and my parents. An example collected by Nielsen Hayden was found in a newspaper account of a documentary about Merle Haggard: :Among those interviewed were his two ex-wives, Kris Kristofferson and Robert Duvall. A serial comma following \\"Kris Kristofferson\\" would help prevent this being understood as Kris Kristofferson and Robert Duvall being the ex-wives in question. Another example is: :My usual breakfast is coffee, bacon and eggs and toast. It is unclear whether the eggs are being grouped with the bacon or the toast. Adding a serial comma removes this ambiguity: :My usual breakfast is coffee, bacon and eggs, and toast. Creating ambiguity In some circumstances using the serial comma can create ambiguity. If the book dedication above is changed to :To my mother, Ayn Rand, and God the serial comma after Ayn Rand creates ambiguity about the writer's mother because it uses punctuation identical to that used for an appositive phrase, leaving it unclear whether this is a list of three entities (1, my mother; 2, Ayn Rand; and 3, God) or of only two entities (1, my mother, who is Ayn Rand; and 2, God). Unresolved ambiguity The Times once published an unintentionally humorous description of a Peter Ustinov documentary, noting that \\"highlights of his global tour include encounters with Nelson Mandela, an 800-year-old demigod and a dildo collector\\". This would still be ambiguous if a serial comma were added, as Mandela could still be mistaken for a demigod, although he would be precluded from being a dildo collector. Or consider :They went to Oregon with Betty, a maid, and a cook. This is ambiguous because it is unclear whether \\"a maid\\" is an appositive describing Betty, or the second in a list of three people. On the other hand, removing the final comma: :They went to Oregon with Betty, a maid and a cook. leaves the possibility that Betty is both a maid and a cook (with \\"a maid and a cook\\" read as a unit, in apposition to Betty). So in this case neither the serial-comma style nor the no-serial- comma style resolves the ambiguity. A writer who intends a list of three distinct people (Betty, maid, cook) may create an ambiguous sentence, regardless of whether the serial comma is adopted. Furthermore, if the reader is unaware of which convention is being used, both versions are always ambiguous. These forms (among others) would remove the ambiguity: * One person ** They went to Oregon with Betty, who was a maid and a cook. ** They went to Oregon with Betty, both a maid and a cook. ** They went to Oregon with Betty (a maid and cook). ** They went to Oregon with Betty, their maid and cook. * Two people ** They went to Oregon with Betty (a maid) and a cook. ** They went to Oregon with Bettya maidand a cook. ** They went to Oregon with Betty, a maid, and with a cook. ** They went to Oregon with the maid Betty and a cook. ** They went to Oregon with a cook and Betty, a maid. * Three people ** They went to Oregon with Betty, as well as a maid and a cook. ** They went to Oregon with Betty and a maid and a cook. ** They went to Oregon with Betty, one maid and a cook. ** They went to Oregon with a maid, a cook, and Betty. ** They went to Oregon with a maid, a cook and Betty. ** They went with Betty to Oregon with a maid and a cook. In general * The list x, y and z is unambiguous if y and z cannot be read as in apposition to x. * Equally, x, y, and z is unambiguous if y cannot be read as in apposition to x. * If neither y nor y[,] and z can be read as in apposition to x, then both forms of the list are unambiguous; but if both y and y and z can be read as in apposition to x, then both forms of the list are ambiguous. * x and y and z is unambiguous if x and y and y and z cannot both be grouped. Ambiguities can often be resolved by the selective use of semicolons instead of commas; this is sometimes called the \\"super comma\\" function of semicolons. Recommendations by style guides Lynne Truss writes: \\"There are people who embrace the Oxford comma, and people who don't, and I'll just say this: never get between these people when drink has been taken.\\" Omitting a serial comma is often characterized as a journalistic style of writing, as contrasted with a more academic or formal style. Journalists typically do not use the serial comma, possibly for economy of space. In Australia, Canada and South Africa, the serial comma tends not to be used in non-academic publications unless its absence produces ambiguity. It is important that usage within a document be consistent; inconsistent usage can seem unprofessional. Mainly American style guides supporting mandatory or typical use ;The United States Government Printing Office's Style Manual :\\"After each member within a series of three or more words, phrases, letters, or figures used with and, or, or nor.\\" It notes that an age (\\"70 years 11 months 6 days\\") is not a series and should not take commas. ;Wilson Follett's Modern American Usage: A Guide (Random House, 1981), pp. 397‚Äì401: :\\"What, then, are the arguments for omitting the last comma? Only one is cogent ‚Äì the saving of space. In the narrow width of a newspaper column this saving counts for more than elsewhere, which is why the omission is so nearly universal in journalism. But here or anywhere one must question whether the advantage outweighs the confusion caused by the omission. ‚Ä¶ The recommendation here is that [writers] use the comma between all members of a series, including the last two, on the common-sense ground that to do so will preclude ambiguities and annoyances at a negligible cost.\\" ;The Chicago Manual of Style, 16th edition (University of Chicago Press, 2010), paragraph 6.18 :\\"When a conjunction joins the last two elements in a series of three or more, a comma ‚Ä¶ should appear before the conjunction. Chicago strongly recommends this widely practiced usage.\\" In answer to a reader's query, The Chicago Manual of Style Online notes that their style guide has been recommending use of the serial comma ever since the first edition in 1906, but also qualifies this, saying \\"the serial comma is optional; some mainstream style guides (such as the Associated Press) don't use it. ‚Ä¶ there are times when using the comma (or omitting it) results in ambiguity, which is why it's best to stay flexible.\\" ;The Elements of Style (Strunk and White, 4th edition 1999), Rule 2 :\\"In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last.\\" This has been recommended in The Elements of Style since the first edition by Strunk in 1918. ;The American Medical Association Manual of Style, 9th edition (1998) Chapter 6.2.1 :\\"Use a comma before the conjunction that precedes the last term in a series.\\" ;The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, 6th edition (2010) Chapter 4.03 :\\"Use a comma between elements (including before and and or) in a series of three or more items.\\" ;The CSE Manual for Authors, Editors, and Publishers (Council of Science Editors, 7th edition, 2006), Section 5.3.3.1 :\\"To separate the elements (words, phrases, clauses) of a simple series of more than 2 elements, including a comma before the closing 'and' or 'or' (the so-called serial comma).

In keeping with the general trend toward less punctuation, the final comma is best omitted where clarity permits, unless there is a need to emphasize the last element in a series.\\" Individual disputes=Maine labor dispute In the U.S. state of Maine, the lack of a serial comma became the deciding factor in a $13 million lawsuit filed in 2014 that was eventually settled for $5 million in 2017. As the U.S. appeals judge David J. Barron wrote, \\"For want of a comma, we have this case.\\" In the case known as O'Connor v. Oakhurst Dairy,O'Connor v. Oakhurst Dairy a federal court of appeals was required to interpret a statute under which the \\"canning, processing, preserving, freezing, drying, marketing, storing, packing for shipment or distribution\\" of certain goods were activities exempted from the general requirement of overtime pay; the question was whether this list included the distribution of the goods, or only the packing of the goods for distribution. The lack of a comma suggested one meaning, while the omission of the conjunction or before \\"packing\\" and the fact that the Maine Legislative Drafting Manual advised against use of the serial comma suggested another. It said \\"Although authorities on punctuation may differ, when drafting Maine law or rules, don‚Äôt use a comma between the penultimate and the last item of a series.\\" In addition to the absence of a comma, the fact that the word chosen was \\"distribution\\" rather than \\"distributing\\" was also a consideration, as was the question of whether it would be reasonable to consider the list to be an asyndetic list (a list in which the coordinating conjunction is absent). Truck drivers demanded overtime pay, and the defense conceded that the expression was ambiguous, but said it should be interpreted as exempting distribution activity from overtime pay. The district court agreed with the defense and held that \\"distribution\\" was an exempt activity. On appeal, however, the First Circuit decided that the sentence was ambiguous and \\"because, under Maine law, ambiguities in the state's wage and hour laws must be construed liberally in order to accomplish their remedial purpose\\", adopted the drivers' narrower reading of the exemption and ruled that those who distributed the goods were entitled to overtime pay. Oakhurst Dairy settled the case by paying $5 million to the drivers, and the phrase in the law in question was later changed to use serial semicolons and \\"distributing\\" resulting in \\"canning; processing; preserving; freezing; drying; marketing; storing; packing for shipment; or distributing\\". The opinion in the case said that 43 of the 50 U.S. states had mandated the use of a serial comma and that both chambers of the federal congress had warned against omitting it, in the words of the U.S. House Legislative Counsel's Manual on Drafting Style, \\"to prevent any misreading that the last item is part of the preceding one\\"; only seven states \\"either do not require or expressly prohibited the use of the serial comma\\". British 50p Brexit coin The new United Kingdom 50p coin commemorating Brexit day, 31 January 2020, was minted with the phrase \\"Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations\\". English novelist Sir Philip Pullman and others criticized the omission of the Oxford comma, whilst others said it was an Americanism and not required in this instance.

Parasitic twins occur when a twin embryo begins developing in utero, but the pair does not fully separate, and one embryo maintains dominant development at the expense of its twin. Unlike conjoined twins, one ceases development during gestation and is vestigial to a mostly fully formed, otherwise healthy individual twin. The undeveloped twin is defined as parasitic, rather than conjoined, because it is incompletely formed or wholly dependent on the body functions of the complete fetus. The independent twin is called the autosite. Genetic variants * Conjoined parasitic twins joined at the head are described as craniopagus or cephalopagus, and occipitalis if joined in the occipital region or parietalis if joined in the parietal region. *Craniopagus parasiticus is a general term for a parasitic head attached to the head of a more fully developed fetus or infant. * Fetus in fetu sometimes is interpreted as a special case of parasitic twin, but may be a distinct entity. * The twin reversed arterial perfusion, or TRAP sequence, results in an acardiac twin, a parasitic twin that fails to develop a head, arms and a heart. The parasitic twin, little more than a torso with or without legs, receives its blood supply from the host twin by means of an umbilical cord-like structure, much like a fetus in fetu, except the acardiac twin is outside the autosite's body. The blood received by the parasitic twin has already been used by the normal fetus, and as such is already de-oxygenated, leaving little developmental nutrients for the acardiac twin. Because it is pumping blood for both itself and its acardiac twin, this causes extreme stress on the normal fetus's heart. Many TRAP pregnancies result in heart failure for the healthy twin. This twinning condition usually occurs very early in pregnancy. A rare variant of the acardiac fetus is the acardius acormus where the head is well developed but the heart and the rest of the body are rudimentary. While it is thought that the classical TRAP/Acardius sequence is due to a retrograde flow from the umbilical arteries of the pump twin to the iliac arteries of the acardiac twin resulting in preferential caudal perfusion, acardius acormus is thought to be a result of an early embryopathy.Abi Nader Khalil, Whitten Sara Melissa, Filippi Elisa, Scott Rose-Mary, Jauniaux Eric.

Dick. It was his first published genre story, originally appearing in Planet Stories in July 1952.Damien Broderick, Transrealist Fiction: Writing in the Slipstream of Science, p. 135. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2000. It was first collected in The Preserving Machine in 1969, and was included in The Best of Philip K. Dick in 1977. It was the title story for the first volume of the original edition of Dick's collected stories.ISFDB publication history Translations of \\"Beyond Lies the Wub\\" have appeared in Dutch, French, German, Italian, Polish and Spanish; and the story has been included in more than a dozen anthologies. Plot Peterson, a crew member of a spaceship loading up with food animals on Mars, buys an enormous pig-like creature known as a \\"wub\\" from a native just before departure. Franco, his captain, is worried about the extra weight but seems more concerned about its taste, as his ship is short of food. However, after takeoff, the crew realizes that the wub is a very intelligent creature, capable of telepathy and maybe even mind control. Peterson and the wub spend time discussing mythological figures and the travels of Odysseus. Captain Franco, paranoid after an earlier confrontation with the Wub which left him temporarily paralyzed, bursts in and insists on killing and eating the wub. The crew becomes very much opposed to killing the sensitive creature after it makes a plea for understanding, but Franco still makes a meal out of him. At the dinner table, Captain Franco apologises for the \\"interruption\\" and resumes the earlier conversation between Peterson and the Wub - which now has apparently taken over the Captain's body.

The Popham Colony‚Äîalso known as the Sagadahoc Colony‚Äîwas a short-lived English colonial settlement in North America. It was established in 1607 by the proprietary Virginia Company of Plymouth and was located in the present-day town of Phippsburg, Maine, near the mouth of the Kennebec River. It was founded a few months after its more successful rival, the colony at Jamestown. That colony was established on May 4, 1607 by the Virginia Company of London in present-day James City County, Virginia. The Popham Colony was the second colony in the region that would eventually become known as New England, coming five years after a short French encampment on Cuttyhunk. The first colony was St. Croix Island, near what is now the Downeast town of Robbinston. (St. Croix Island was settled initial in June of 1604, and subsequently abandoned).The colony was abandoned after only 14 months, apparently more due to the death of patrons and the first colony president than lack of success in the New World. The loss of life of the colonists in 1607 and 1608 at Popham was far lower than that experienced at Jamestown. The first ocean going ship built by the English in the New World was completed during the year of the Popham Colony and was sailed back across the Atlantic Ocean to England. The pinnace, named Virginia of Sagadahoc, was apparently quite seaworthy, and crossed the Atlantic again successfully in 1609 as part of Sir Christopher Newport's nine vessel Third Supply mission to Jamestown. The small Virginia survived a massive three-day storm en route which was thought to have been a hurricane and which wrecked the mission's large new flagship Sea Venture on Bermuda. The exact site of the Popham Colony was lost until 1888 when a plan for the site was found in the General Archives in Simancas Spain. This plan exactly matches the location at Sabino Head near Maine's Popham Beach State Park. Later archaeology in 1994 confirmed the location and the accuracy of the plan. The site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History=Founding Popham was a project of the Plymouth Company, which was one of the two competing parts of the proprietary Virginia Company that King James chartered in 1606 to raise private funds from investors in order to settle Virginia. At the time, the name \\"Virginia\\" applied to the entire east coast of North America from Spanish Florida to New France in modern-day Canada. That area was technically under the claim of the Spanish crown, but was not occupied by the Spanish. The Plymouth Company was granted a royal charter and the rights to the coast between 38¬∞ and 45¬∞ N; the rival London Company was granted the coast between 34¬∞ and 41¬∞ N. The colonists were to plant first within their respective non- overlapping areas; the overlapping area between 38¬∞ and 41¬∞ would then go to the first company that proved \\"strong enough\\" to colonize it. Colonists The first Plymouth Company ship, Richard, sailed in August 1606, but the Spanish intercepted and captured it near Florida in November. The next attempt was more successful. The expedition's mission was to find gold, the Northwest Passage, a river passage to China, to fish and hunt beaver for fur and to sell and prove that New World forests could build English ships. About 120 colonists (all men and boys) left Plymouth on May 31, 1607, in two ships. They intended to trade precious metals, spices, furs, and show that the local forests could be used to build English ships. George Popham was president of the colony and captain of Gift of God. Raleigh Gilbert was admiral (second in command) of the colony and captain of Mary and John. Neither of these men were mariners and the ships officers of Mary and John were Robert Davies and James Davis. The ships log and diary from the voyage and first 6 weeks of the colony is the main contemporary source of the information about the Popham Colony. (It was called \\"Popham\\" after its principal financial backer, Sir John Popham)Beckenstein, Myron. \\"Maine‚Äôs Lost Colony\\", Smithsonian Magazine, February 2004 The diary is kept in Lambeth Museum in London. James Davis was later made captain of the ship built by the colonists, Virginia, which made at least two voyages across the Atlantic. Robert and James were most likely from a family of mariners from Devon, England. Sir John Popham was the Lord Chief Justice of England, while Gilbert was the son of Sir Humphrey Gilbert and half nephew of Sir Walter Raleigh. Other financiers included Sir Ferdinando Gorges, the military governor of Plymouth. Much of the information about the events in the colony comes from his letters and memoirs. Settlers included the Reverend Richard Seymour, grandson of Sir Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset and brother to Jane Seymour. Nine council members and six other gentlemen accompanied the expedition, while the rest were soldiers, artisans, farmers and traders. In August they arrived at Pemaquid, returning a native, Skidwarres, who had been captured by George Weymouth in 1605. The Gift of God arrived at the mouth of the Kennebec River (then called the Sagadahoc River) on August 13, 1607. The Mary and John arrived three days later. They quickly began construction of large star-shaped Fort St. George.\\"Popham Colony\\", Maine: An Encyclopedia Fort St. George John Hunt's map Fort St. George, named for the patron saint of England, was built on the headland of an area named Sabino, ten miles/15 kilometres south of what is now Bath, Maine, in the town of Phippsburg. On October 8, 1607, colonist John Hunt drew a plan of the colony. Hunt was listed in the colony register as \\"draughtsman\\". His map showed a star-shaped fort with ditches and ramparts, and 18 buildings including the admiral's house, a chapel, a storehouse, a cooperage, and a guardhouse. The plan for Fort St. George shows nine guns that ranged in size from demi- culverin to falcon. The plan was drafted when work on the site was just beginning, so it is unclear how much was actually built. As a result of espionage, Hunt's map was sold to the Spanish ambassador to London, Pedro de Zuniga. The map then passed to King Philip III of Spain, in 1608. In 1888 it was discovered in the Spanish national archives. Fort St. George was abandoned after 14 months of occupation. Most of the site is privately owned, but part of it is within the Fort Baldwin State Historic Site. Between 1994 and 2013 a number of archaeological explorations were done at the site.. Archaeological excavations show some but not all of the buildings in the plan, and shallow ditches where defensive trenches are shown on the plan. No stonework was found, but many of the defenses are based on the natural geography. Troubles begin Popham and Gilbert sent survey expeditions up the river and west across Casco Bay and contacted the Abenaki, an Indian tribe belonging to the Algonquian peoples of northeastern North America. In a letter to the King, Popham wrote that the natives had told them that the area was full of easily exploitable resources. However, the colony failed to establish cooperation with the tribe. Late summer arrival meant that there was no time to farm for food. With inadequate supplies, half of the colonists returned to England in December 1607 aboard the Gift of God and almost starved on the return trip and had to sell their cargo in the Azores. Others faced a cold winter during which the Kennebec River froze. Historical records indicate that fire destroyed parts of the storehouse and its provisions, but archaeological excavations indicate that other building were burned and not the storehouse. George Popham died on February 5, 1608,. He is the only colonist known to have died (in contrast to Jamestown which lost half its population that year) although the Abenaki claim that they killed eleven colonists and set fire to the site. Raleigh Gilbert became president of the colony at the age of 25. The colonists completed one major project: the building of a 30-ton ship, a pinnace they named Virginia. It was the first English ocean-going ship built in the Americas. The primary purpose of Virginia was for use in exploration of the area, but was later refitted and some of the colonists returned to England in it when the colony was abandoned. This was the beginning of a 400 year shipbuilding legacy in the Bath, Maine area. In May 1608 a supply ship brought a message that Sir John Popham had died. The supply ship returned to England with a cargo. When Mary and John returned in September 1608, it brought news that Gilbert's elder brother John had died. Gilbert thus inherited the title and the estate of Compton Castle in Devon. He decided to return to England and as no other leader was found, the colony decided to disband and the remaining colonists sailed home in Mary and John and Virginia. (The Virginia would make at least one more Atlantic crossing, going to Jamestown the next year with the Third Supply, piloted by Captain James Davis). The colony lasted just 14 months. It is likely that the failure of the colony was due to multiple problems: the lack of financial support after the death of Sir John Popham, the inability to find another leader, the hostility of the native people and the French, and the cold winter. Sir Frances Popham (son of Sir John) tried several times to reestablish the colony, but was unable to get the financial backing. The settlement of New England was delayed until it was taken up by refugees instead of adventurers. Later developments Site of Fort George in 2018 French colonist Jean de Biencourt with Father Pierre Biard visited the abandoned site in 1611. In 1624, Samuel Maverick of the Massachusetts Bay Colony also visited the site and reported that it was \\"over-grown\\" but garden herbs could still be seen. In the 18th Century the site was divided into farmland and several houses were built on the site. During the American Civil War, the Union army built Fort Popham in the area, directly on the Kennebec River at the mouth of Atkins Bay (about 500 meters east of the Popham Colony site). In 1905 the US Army built Fort Baldwin on Sabino Head just west of the site, but parts of the site were used for transport and storage. The state of Maine bought some of the area in 1924. Fort Baldwin was reactivated during World War II. After the War, Fort Baldwin was returned to the state of Maine and is now part of the Fort Baldwin State Historic Site. Much of the Popham Colony Site is privately owned. Modern excavations The first excavations of the area in the 1960s were unsuccessful. In 1994, Jeffrey Brain of the Peabody Essex Museum confirmed the site of the colony using Hunt's plan as a guide, and confirmed the accuracy of the plan. He began a larger excavation in 1997 and later uncovered the Admiral's house, the storehouse and a liquor storage building. He also proved that Hunt's map was very accurate for those buildings which were actually built.. Parts of the fort, probably including the chapel and graveyard, lie on private property not open for digging and the fort's southern portion is under a public road. One major find in the later excavations was that iron smelting had been done in the Popham Colony, presumably using local bog iron. This might have been the earliest iron smelting in what is now the United States. The excavation was concluded in 2013. ReferencesSources and further reading * Richard L.

It was jointly owned by Bell Canada and Northern Telecom. BNR was absorbed into Nortel Networks when that company changed its name from Northern Telecom in the mid-1990s. BNR was based at the Carling Campus in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, with campuses at locations around the world, including Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; Richardson, Texas; and Maidenhead, United Kingdom. Bell-Northern Research pioneered the development of digital technology, and created the first practical digital PBX, (SL1), and central office (DMS). Under the direction of then Nortel Chief Officer, John Roth, BNR lost its separate identity in the 1990s, and was folded into the Nortel R&D; organization. History For much of its early history, Bell Canada operated as the Canadian division of the Bell System. Development and manufacturing of their various telephony products generally took place in the US, and then, to avoid duty, were manufactured in Canada at their Northern Electric subsidiary (which would later become Nortel Networks), the Canadian analog to the US Western Electric. Pre-1970s Northern Electric spun off a subsidiary in 1934, Dominion Sound Equipment, originally to develop equipment for sound in movies. Over time, the division evolved in an attempt to use its design talent and manufacturing ability on third party projects. In 1937, this aspect became the Special Products Division. For many years the SPD was used as Bell Canada's R&D; arm, although as before, most telephony designs were created at Bell Labs in the US. In 1949, the United States Justice department attempted to force AT&T; to divest itself of its Western Electric subsidiary. As a result of this legal action, Western Electric sold its shares in Northern Electric to Bell Canada. In 1957, Northern Electric started its own research and development labs in Belleville, Ontario. Two years later, Northern Electric created the Northern Electric Research and Development Laboratories in Ottawa. 1970s In 1971, Bell Canada and Northern Electric combined their R&D; organizations and formed Bell-Northern Research. BNR's researchers pioneered the view that a telephone switch (PBX or Central Office) was best regarded as a special form of real- time computer, a view that was considered to be highly innovative in the 1970s. Although George Stibitz had foreseen this evolution at AT&T; in the 1930s, subsequent generations of engineers, prior to the 1970s, regarded the switch as a piece of hardware, best hard-wired, to handle the basic telephone call where two parties connect, speak and hang up. In the 1960s, however, this view was coming under a great deal of strain. Increasingly, telephone users wanted to conference call, forward, and record voice greetings, so common today. Such features required more flexibility in the controller, leading to the development of computer-controlled switching machines, notably the Bell Labs ‚àí Western Electric 1ESS. These early machines still had an analog, usually electromechanical switching matrix because the technology of the time did not permit the cost-effective dedication of a filter-codec to each subscriber. (Transmission systems had already gone digital, for example the D4 carrier system.) Northern Electric introduced its first electronic central office system in 1969 with the SP1. The SP1 had a fully computer-based electronic control system, thus the name \\"SP,\\" short for \\"stored program.\\" Its switching matrix was still electromechanical. Rather than the reed relay matrix of the 1ESS, it used the minibar, a version of the crossbar switch. BNR was, with Northern Telecom, a part owner of MicroSystems International a semiconductor manufacturer based in Kanata, outside Ottawa. =The Digital Switch= BNR introduced the Meridian SL-1 in 1975, the world's first all- digital PABX aimed at medium-sized businesses. The SL-1 was fully digital in both control and switching. As such the SL-1 was smaller, much more reliable, and offered many more features than an equivalent electromechanical system. The SL-1 design evolved into Meridian-1, and subsequently the CS1000x as Nortel's private network (or enterprise) flagship offering. The SP-1 design was superseded by the DMS-100 central office switch and other members of the DMS family of products (DMS: digital multiplex switch). DMS extended the technology by fully integrating switching and transmission. This was a major advance that changed the way systems were built. BNR's products were architecturally based on Complex Instruction Set (CISC) architectures prevalent in the 1970s, and on a series of underlying technologies. This was greatly influenced by the late 1970s success of the DEC VAX computer, a highly \\"elegant\\" and rather layered technology, realizable in a range of power. In the early 1990s, under Nortel CEO Jean Monty, the software for the flagship DMS product was segmented into layers ('Base', 'Telecom', and 'IEC' or Inter- Exchange Carrier) to improve maintainability of the product. The IEC layers were customer-specific, targeted towards Sprint, MCI, and a large group of small \\"United Carrier\\" companies that were subsequently swallowed up by Worldcom. Once the IEC layer was established, customer-specific releases could occur quarterly, whereas Telecom and Base programming was for baked-in code that only had infrequent, maintenance updates. 1980s Through the 1980s attention turned from pure hardware to software development. The BNR Toronto lab introduced Meridian Mail in the 1980s, which went on to be a very successful product and forced the introduction of similar products from other telephony vendors. They later added automatic call distribution and other similar services. At its zenith in the early 1980s, when it opened R&D; centers in Mountain View, and later in Research Triangle Park and Richardson, Texas, BNR's notable American employees included Whitfield Diffie, a noted authority on cryptography, and Robert Gaskins, who invented PowerPoint after leaving BNR, influenced in part by BNR's response to the very cumbersome presentation tools used by his department there.Robert Gaskins, Sweating Bullets: Notes about Inventing PowerPoint, (San Francisco and London: Vinland Books, 2012, 512pp), ¬ß14, pp.30‚àí32. https://books.google.com/books?id=t3INw5KknpYC&printsec;=frontcover&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=Wpt3U8zmEdawoQTuxoHQCw&ved;=0CEkQuwUwAA#v=onepage J.W.J. Williams, the inventor of Heapsort was also an influential figure in the development of digital switching.Penny and Williams (1982) As part of its internal IT infrastructure, BNR also created an email system called COCOS (COrporate COmmunication System), and a powerful relational database system called GERM (General Entity-Relationship Model). BNR also had labs in Maidenhead, England, Montreal, Quebec, Edmonton, Alberta, Wollongong, Australia, and Tokyo, Japan; as well as Atlanta, Georgia and Ann Arbor, Michigan. 1990s With the formation of Bell Canada Enterprises (later shortened to BCE) in 1983 as the parent company of Bell Canada and Northern Telecom, BNR in Canada was jointly owned 50-50 by Bell Canada and Nortel. Nortel assumed a majority share in BNR in 1996, and BNR was gradually folded into Nortel, which acquired the remainder of BNR when BCE divested itself of Nortel. Unfortunately, the collapse in demand for Nortel products in the wake of the bursting of the dot-com bubble, which occurred after aggressive spending on acquisitions and hiring under CEO John Roth, required Nortel to trim its workforce from 96,000 (in 2001) to 35,000 people (as of 2006).

He was educated at The Crypt School, Gloucester. He was a student at Pembroke College, Oxford (matriculated 1745; BA 1748; MA 1751). Having taken holy orders, he was for some years tutor to Lords Charles and Robert Spencer, younger sons of Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough. On 21 September 1761, he was preferred to the fifth prebendal stall in the church of Durham, and in April 1763, to a canonry at Christ Church, Oxford. On 1 July 1764, he took the degrees of B.D. and D.D. On 19 September 1771, he was made dean of Canterbury, and on 10 February 1775, bishop of Bangor.

It came into effect on 4 April 2005. Operation of the law The Gender Recognition Act 2004 enables transsexual people to apply to receive a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC). A Gender Recognition Certificate is the document issued that shows that a person has satisfied the criteria for legal recognition in the acquired gender. The Act gives people with gender dysphoria legal recognition as members of the sex appropriate to their gender identity allowing them to acquire a Gender Recognition Certificate. People whose birth was registered in the United Kingdom or abroad with the British authorities are able to obtain a birth certificate showing their recognised legal sex. People granted a full GRC are from the date of issue, considered in the eyes of the law to be of their 'acquired gender' in most situations. Two main exceptions to trans people's legal recognition are that the descent of peerages will remain unchanged (important only for primogeniture inheritance) and a right of conscience for Church of England clergy (who are normally obliged to marry any two eligible people by law). Additionally, sports organisations are allowed to exclude transsexual people if it is necessary for 'fair competition or the safety of the competitors'; courts are allowed to disclose an individual's trans status; employers are allowed to exclude trans people as a 'genuine occupational requirement'; and organisations are allowed to exclude trans people from single sex or separate sex services as 'a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim'. The example given in the Act is a group counselling session provided for female victims of sexual assault. The Gender Recognition Act 2004 aimed to safeguard the privacy of transsexual people by defining information in relation to the gender recognition process as protected information. Anyone who acquires that information in an official capacity may be breaking the law if they disclosed it without the subject's consent. However, in the first seven years of operation, birth certificates drawn from the Gender Recognition Register were immediately distinguishable from a natal birth certificate, since they had only nine columns of information, omitting the item 'Signature, description and residence of informant' that appears on birth certificates. These Gender Recognition Certificates also replaced the rubric 'Certified to be a true copy of an entry in the certified copy of a Register of Births in the District above mentioned', which appears on birth certificates, with the rubric 'Certified to be a true copy of a record in the custody of the Registrar General'. These issues were corrected by the Gender Recognition Register (Amendment) Regulations 2011. A Gender Recognition Panel, including medical and legal experts considers evidence submitted to it to assess whether the criteria for issuing a Gender Recognition Certificate have been met.Example of a Gender Recognition Certificate The evidence must show a documented mental health diagnosis of gender dysphoria. If the person involved is in a legally recognised marriage, they require spousal consent for the certificate to be issued, after which a new marriage certificate can be issued; if the spouse does not consent, the person will be issued an Interim Gender Recognition Certificate,Example of an Interim Gender Recognition Certificate which for a limited period can then be used as grounds for annulment of the marriage, but otherwise has no status. A person currently in a civil partnership must dissolve it and/or marry, since UK law currently only recognises same sex civil partnerships. Background The Act was drafted in response to court rulings from the European Court of Human Rights. The previous precedent dated back to 1970, when Arthur Cameron Corbett, 3rd Baron Rowallan had his marriage annulled on the basis that his wife, April Ashley, being transsexual, was legally male. This argument was accepted by the judge, and the legal test for sex in the UK had been since been based on the judgement in Corbett v Corbett; it had even led to the curiosity of a legal marriage between two lesbians since one had been born male. The European Court of Human Rights ruled on 11 July 2002, in Goodwin & I v United Kingdom [2002] 2 FCR 577, that a trans person's inability to change the sex on their birth certificate was a breach of their rights under Article 8 and Article 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Following this judgement, the UK Government had to introduce new legislation to comply. Legislative progress The bill was introduced in the House of Lords in late 2003. It was passed by the House of Lords on 10 February 2004, with 155 votes in favour and 57 against. The House of Commons passed it on 25 May. It received Royal Assent on 1 July 2004. The bill faced criticism in the House of Lords, including a wrecking amendment from Lord Tebbit (who has described sex reassignment surgery as \\"mutilation\\"), and from Baroness O'Cathain, who introduced an amendment to allow religious groups to exclude transsexual people. However, this amendment was narrowly defeated after opposition from Peter Selby, Bishop of Worcester, and Michael Scott- Joynt, Bishop of Winchester. Support for the bill in the House of Commons was split broadly down party lines. At both the second and third readings (i.e. before and after amendments), all Labour Party, Liberal Democrat, Plaid Cymru and Scottish National Party votes were in favour of the bill; all Ulster Unionist and Democratic Unionist Party votes were against. Conservative Party MPs were split on the issue, and the party leadership did not issue a whip mandating MPs to take a particular stance on the bill, instead allowing its MPs a free vote. 25 Conservative MPs voted in favour and 22 against the bill at its second reading, and 20 voted in favour and 39 voted against the bill at its third reading. Less than half of the Conservative Party's 166 MPs participated in either vote. Among those who voted against the bill were Ann Widdecombe (who opposed it on religious grounds), Dominic Grieve, Peter Lilley and Andrew Robathan. Among Conservative MPs who supported the bill were Kenneth Clarke, Constitutional Affairs spokesman Tim Boswell, and future speaker John Bercow. Updates In 2016, the Women and Equalities Committee published a root-and-branch review of the Gender Recognition Act, noting its deficiencies and making recommendations for its review. At the same time, it noted similar deficiencies in the Equality Act (2010) as it affected the protected characteristic of Gender reassignment. In November 2017, the Scottish government published its review of the GRA with intentions to reform it \\"so that it is in line with international best practice.\\" The \\"Ministerial Foreword\\" to the review acknowledges that the 2004 GRA is \\"out of date\\" and places \\"intrusive and onerous\\" requirements on the person applying for the gender change. The government recommends keeping the existing requirements for applicants to declare that \\"they fully understand the implications of their application and intend to live in their acquired gender for the rest of their lives\\" but proposes eliminating the requirement \\"to provide medical evidence and to have lived in their acquired gender for two years before applying.\\" In 2017, Minister for Equalities Justine Greening considered reforms to the Gender Recognition Act to de-medicalise the process, with the principle of self-identification. One of Greening's successors, Penny Mordaunt, affirmed that the consultation on the Gender Recognition Act would come from the starting place that 'transgender women are women'. In a June 2020 report the European Commission classified the legal procedures for gender recognition of 28 European countries into 5 categories based on the barriers to access. This placed the Gender Recognition Act 2004 in the second from bottom category with \\"intrusive medical requirements\\" that lags behind international human rights standards. In September 2020 the UK government published the results of the public consultation which showed wide support for all aspects of reform, including 64% in favour of removing the requirement for a diagnosis of Gender dysphoria and 80% in favour of removing the requirement for a medical report. However the UK government decided not to change the current law, which was described as \\"a missed opportunity\\" by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. Concerns regarding marriages and civil partnerships Concerns about the act were raised by supporters of transsexual rights, particularly regarding marriages and civil partnerships.Till Political Convenience Do Us Part; Christine Burns The act required people who are married to divorce or annul their marriage in order for them to be issued with a Gender Recognition Certificate but this is to change with effect from 10 December 2014, from which date a gender recognition certificate may be granted while still in an existing marriage. In both England and Wales, and Scotland, such an application from a married person will require written consent from the spouse ‚Äì the so-called spousal veto. However, applicants in Scotland benefit from a workaround, where it is possible for applicants in Scotland to apply to the sheriff court to have their interim GRC replaced with a full GRC, bypassing the \\"spousal veto\\". Some parliamentarians, such as Evan Harris, viewed the original requirement as inhumane and destructive of the family.See the Honourable Dr. Harris, House of Commons Standing Committee A, 9 March 2004, Col 60. ‚Äì https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmstand/a/st040309/pm/40309s09.htm MP Hugh Bayley said in the commons debate \\"I can think of no other circumstance in which the state tells a couple who are married and who wish to remain married that they must get divorced\\".The Honourable Hugh Bayley, House of Commons 2nd Reading 23 February 2004, Col. 60; the Honourable Andrew Selous, House of Commons 2nd Reading, 23 February 2004, Col. 64 Despite this opposition, the government chose to retain this requirement of the Bill. Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Constitutional Affairs, David Lammy, speaking for the Government, said ‚Äò\\"it is the Government's firm view that we cannot allow a small category of same-sex marriages\\"The Honourable David Lammy, House of Commons Standing Committee A, 9 March 2004, Col. 69. It was suggested in the debates that the number of transgender people who have undertaken gender reassignment and who are currently living in a marriage was no more than 200.( the Honourable Mr. Oaten, House of Commons 2nd Reading 23 February 2004, Col. 69) Although the Civil Partnership Act 2004 allows the creation of civil partnerships between same sex couples, before 2013, a married couple that included a transgender partner could simply re-register their new status. They had to have their marriage dissolved, gain legal recognition of the new gender and then register for a civil partnership. This is like any divorce with the associated paperwork and costs. Once the annulment is declared final and the GRC issued, the couple can then make arrangements with the local registrar to have the civil partnership ceremony. The marriage is ended and a completely new arrangement brought into being which does not in all circumstances (such as wills) necessarily follow on seamlessly. This is also true for civil partnerships that included a transgender partner: the existing civil partnership needed to be dissolved and the couple could then enter into a marriage afterward. For a couple in a marriage or civil partnership where both partners are transgender, they can have their gender recognition applications considered at the same time, however they were required to dissolve their existing marriage/civil partnership and then re-register their marriage/civil partnership with their new genders. Tamara Wilding of the Beaumont Society pressure group said that it was \\"not fair that people in this situation should have to annul their marriage and then enter a civil partnership. The law needs tidying up. It would be easy to put an amendment in the civil partnership law to allow people who have gone through gender-reassignment, and want that to be recognised, to have the status of their relationship continued.\\" The emotional stress caused is immeasurable as in the case of a Scottish couple. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) appreciated the challenges to married transsexual people and their partners presented by Schedule 2 of the Act and in a recent submission to governmentSubmission on the United Kingdom's sixth periodic report under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights they recommend > The government amends the Gender Recognition Act to allow for the automatic > conversion of a marriage into a civil partnership upon one member of the > couple obtaining a gender recognition certificate.  Post-2013  These concerns were ameliorated somewhat by the passage of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013, since marriage is now available to both opposite-sex and same-sex couples alike. Under the current law, when a married couple includes a transgender person, the marriage may continue if the transgender person's spouse consents to the marriage continuing. This has been described, and opposed, by transgender activists as a \\"spousal veto\\" on their legal transition. In 2019, the Liberal Democrats included the removal of the \\"spousal veto\\" as part of their manifesto. Elizabeth Barker, Baroness Barker introduced a Private Member's Bill to amend the law in 2019.  Relationship with the Equality Act 2010  The operation of the GRA interacts with sex- based discrimination as interpreted by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC): > A trans person is protected from sex discrimination on the basis of their > legal sex. This means that a trans woman who does not hold a GRC and is > therefore legally male would be treated as male for the purposes of the sex > discrimination provisions, and a trans woman with a GRC would be treated as > female. The sex discrimination exceptions in the Equality Act therefore > apply differently to a trans person with a GRC or without a GRC. However, irrespective of their legal sex the Equality Act 2010 protects trans people from discrimination on the basis of the protected characteristic of Gender reassignment, while also defining exceptions where discrimination can be allowed. The Equality Act allows exceptions for single-sex services and single-sex activities, but only if it can be shown that they are a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. The EHRC has also stated that this is unaffected by whether or not an individual holds a GRC: > There are some exceptions permitting different treatment on the basis of > gender reassignment, for example the exceptions related to single-sex > services and associations. These exceptions do not hinge on whether or not > an individual has a GRC. In practice some groups have suggested there is a lack of guidance about how to interpret the interaction between the Gender Recognition Act and the Equality Act. The Women's Budget Group in its submission to the UK government's consultation on reforming the GRA said: > there is widespread confusion and lack of information about the Equality Act > exemptions, meaning that many service providers and commissioners do not > know what the law does and does not allow. Some commissioners [i.e. of > public service contracts] do not believe that single sex services are lawful > at all. Many do not appear to be aware of the exemptions for gender > reassignment. In its submission the EHRC restated their earlier view but suggested a reformed GRA could clarify the scope of a GRC in this regard: > While we do not consider changes to these provisions of the EA 2010 are > appropriate, further consideration should be given to other ways of > addressing those concerns. We recommend that the UK Government considers > including a provision in the legislation reforming the GRA to put beyond > doubt that having a GRC is not a determining factor in how the exceptions > relating to gender reassignment discrimination apply. We consider that > clear, practical guidance and other forms of assistance to help trans > people, single-sex and separate-sex service providers should accompany > reform of the GRA.

It changed the age of consent for male homosexual sexual activities (including anal sex) from 18 (or for some activities, 21) to that for heterosexual and lesbian sexual activities at 16, or 17 in Northern Ireland. It also introduced the new offence of 'having sexual intercourse or engaging in any other sexual activity with a person under 18 if in a position of trust in relation to that person'. Lowering the homosexual age of consent had last been addressed by Parliament in 1994, when the then Conservative MP Edwina Currie proposed an amendment to the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill to lower the age of consent to sixteen years. Even though over forty Tory MPs joined Currie, the measure was lost by twenty-seven votes.House of Commons Hansard, 21 February 1994The Independent, 23 February 1994 Immediately afterwards, MPs agreed on division (427 to 162) to reduce the age of consent for homosexual sexual activities to eighteen.House of Commons Hansard, 21 February 1994 The election of a Labour Government in 1997 afforded Parliament a further opportunity to examine the issue. In 1996, the European Court of Human Rights heard Morris v. The United Kingdom and Sutherland v. the United Kingdom, cases brought by Chris Morris and Euan Sutherland challenging the inequality inherent in divided ages of consent. The government stated its intention to legislate to negate the court cases, which were put on hold. Ann Keen, a Labour MP, introduced an amendment to Crime and Disorder Bill in 1998, and this was carried on 22 June 1998 by a majority of 207 in the House of Commons. The amendment was then removed by the House of Lords by a majority of 168. Not wishing to lose the whole bill, the government allowed the issue to be dropped. Later in the year, the government reintroduced the measure in what eventually became this Act. It once again sailed through the House of Commons by a majority of 183 on 25 January 1999, but was again blocked in the House of Lords after a concerted campaign by Conservative peer Baroness Young. The government once again re-introduced the measure, this time threatening to invoke the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949. After the bill once again sailed through the House of Commons before being rejected by the House of Lords, the government carried through its threat and on 30 November 2000, Speaker Michael Martin announced the passage of the Act. It received Royal Assent a few hours later. This Act was effectively superseded in England and Wales by the Sexual Offences Act 2003 which repealed most of its provisions as they applied to England and Wales. The new Act which consolidated most previous sexual offences legislation maintained the decriminalisation that had been achieved in this Act. This fact became significant in the wake of passage of the Hunting Act 2004 which was also passed using the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949. The passage of that Act was challenged in the case of R (Jackson) v Attorney General on the basis that the Parliament Act 1949 itself had been unlawfully passed. If the latter point were true, then the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000 would also be invalid, though the point would be moot since the provisions had been consolidated in legislation not passed under the Parliament Acts. The challenge to the Hunting Act was ultimately unsuccessful.

Biography=Political life Colin Thatcher was born in Toronto when his father, Ross Thatcher, worked for Canada Packers, and moved to Saskatchewan when his father returned home to run the family business. His father subsequently entered politics, becoming premier of Saskatchewan from 1964 to 1971. Colin began studying agriculture at the University of Saskatchewan. After one year, he transferred to Iowa State University where he met JoAnn Geiger. In 1962, Thatcher and Geiger married. Thatcher graduated from Iowa State with B.S. and M.S. degrees in Agriculture; he then went to work on his father's ranch in Moose Jaw. After his father's death in 1971, Thatcher cultivated his own interest in politics. In 1975 he won the provincial riding of Thunder Creek as a Liberal, but defected to the Progressive Conservatives two years later when voter popularity shifted from the Liberals to the Conservatives. The move was denounced by the Liberals, and also privately by his wife JoAnn. Marital issues Geiger felt disgraced by Thatcher's behaviour, and their marriage began to disintegrate. Thatcher began a number of extramarital relationships, which he made little effort to hide from public scrutiny. When Geiger confronted him with these indiscretions, Thatcher is reported to have verbally and physically abused her. Thatcher's dalliances did not adversely affect his popularity as a politician, and in 1978 he was re-elected to the Legislative Assembly. Divorce His marriage, however, did not fare so well, and in 1980, after nearly a year of legal battling, the couple divorced. Geiger was awarded custody of two of their three children, plus $820,000 for her share of the marital property; the amount was one of the highest ever awarded by a Canadian divorce court. Thatcher formally contested the settlement and ignored its custody terms, at one point flying to Geiger's new home in Brampton, Ontario to kidnap the children. Geiger married Tony Wilson soon afterward, but she had to endure almost constant harassment from her ex-husband. After Geiger was shot and injured by an unidentified assailant the following year, thought to be Thatcher, she gave up her claim to custody of Regan, the middle child, and settled for about half of her original court award. Geiger and Wilson believed that Thatcher was behind the shooting, but the Crown never pressed charges. Again, Thatcher's political life was largely unaffected, and he won his third straight term as MLA at the 1982 election. The Saskatchewan Tories won a majority government in that election, and Thatcher was appointed to the provincial cabinet as Minister of Energy and Mines. However, following public criticism and disputes with then-premier Grant Devine, he resigned from the post the following year. Murder Four days after Thatcher's resignation, on 21 January 1983, JoAnn was found bludgeoned and shot to death in the garage of her Regina home. Again, rumours abounded that Thatcher was in some way involved, though he was not formally charged until 7 May 1984, after a lengthy police investigation. Evidence Four key pieces of evidence eventually led to Thatcher's arrest: *A credit card receipt dated 17 January, four days before the murder, with Thatcher's name and signature on it, was found near the murder scene. *Neighbours reported seeing a suspicious car, a black Ford Mustang, parked outside the Wilson residence around the time of the murder. The car's licence plates were illegible because they were covered with mud. When a neighbour tried to wipe off the mud, she was only able to uncover the numbers \\"292\\" before the car pulled away. A car with a matching description and licence plate was subsequently found on Thatcher's property; it was traced to the Saskatchewan government loaned vehicles parking lot. *The ammunition (.357 Magnum) and the type of gun (Ruger Security-Six) thought to be used in the murder match those Thatcher had previously purchased on a trip to Palm Springs, California. *Most damningly, a man named Gary Anderson confessed to police that he had been approached by Thatcher for help in the murder. He resembled the man neighbours described as sitting in the orange Ford Mustang while it was parked outside the Wilson residence. He also named two other men ‚Äî Cody Crutcher and Charlie Wilde ‚Äî as participants with him in the plot. The three men told police that (a) it was Anderson whom neighbours had seen sitting in the Ford Mustang outside the Wilson residence, (b) there was a disguise in the Mustang back seat, and (c) it was Colin Thatcher wearing the disguise who actually committed the murder. Police convinced Anderson to wear a wire and meet with Thatcher to try to elicit a confession or reveal details of the murder. During the recorded conversation, Thatcher made several statements that implied he was involved in the crime. Though Anderson made several attempts to elicit an incriminating statement, Thatcher did not confess directly. However, he did tell Anderson repeatedly to deny any direct accusations or indirect allegations. His responses and evasiveness, in addition to other evidence, convinced police that he was the mastermind. Conviction Thatcher was tried in Saskatoon for the murder of his ex-wife in the autumn of 1984. In addition to the evidence presented, he insisted on testifying so that he could try and explain the recorded conversation between Gary Anderson and him. He was found guilty under the prosecution of Serge Kujawa, and was given a sentence of life imprisonment with no eligibility for parole for 25 years. He appealed the verdict, but the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal rejected the plea in 1986. Subsequent requests to the Supreme Court of Canada and the national Minister of Justice for a review of his case were also denied. A request for an early parole hearing was rejected in 2000, though the jury of a later hearing in 2003 decided that he was eligible to apply. He did so, and on 31 March 2004 the National Parole Board rejected his bid for early release. Throughout his trial and his appeals, Thatcher has steadfastly maintained his innocence, which he admits is probably the reason he was not paroled until late 2006. Parole On December 18, 2006, he made his first public appearance since being paroled two weeks before, when he appeared at the Saskatchewan Legislature for a ceremony honouring former Premiers of the province. Thatcher spoke with the media about the accomplishments of his late father, but refused to discuss the murder of his ex-wife. Thatcher has written a 440-page book about his case, entitled Final Appeal: Anatomy of a Frame. It was released by ECW Press on September 1, 2009. On April 21, 2010, Thatcher agreed to relinquish any profits related to the sale of his book, beginning with his $5,000 advance from his publisher. Thatcher has also instructed the publisher of his book to forward any further royalties from its sale to the Saskatchewan Minister of Finance. In 2011, funds from the sale of Final Appeal in the amount of $13,866.44 were turned over to the Ministry of Justice. Biographies *Bird, Heather.

The film was directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer and stars Ren√©e Jeanne Falconetti as Joan. It is widely regarded as a landmark of cinema,The Criterion Collection: Passion of Joan of Arc, The ‚Äì Synopsis by Anonymous. Retrieved 22 March 2007. especially for its production, Dreyer's direction and Falconetti's performance, which is often listed as one of the finest in cinema history. The film summarizes the time that Joan of Arc was a captive of England,DVD commentary by Casper Tybjerg, Associate Professor of Film Studies at the Department of Media, Cognition and Communication at the University of Copenhagen. depicting her trial and execution. Danish director Dreyer was invited to make a film in France by the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale des Films and chose to make a film about Joan of Arc due to her renewed popularity in France. Dreyer spent over a year researching Joan of Arc and the transcripts of her trial before writing the script. Dreyer cast stage actress Falconetti as Joan in her only major film role. Falconetti's performance and devotion to the role during filming have become legendary among film scholars. The film was shot on one huge concrete set modeled on medieval architecture in order to realistically portray the Rouen prison. The film is known for its cinematography and use of close-ups. Dreyer also didn't allow the actors to wear make-up and used lighting designs that made the actors look more grotesque. Prior to its release, the film was controversial due to French nationalists' skepticism about whether a Danish person could direct a film that centered on one of France's most revered historical icons. Dreyer's final version of the film was cut down due to pressure from the Archbishop of Paris and from government censors. For several decades it was released and viewed in various re-edited versions that had attempted to restore Dreyer's final cut. In 1981 a film print of Dreyer's final cut of the film was finally discovered in Gaustad Hospital, a mental institution in Oslo, Norway and re-released. Despite the objections and cutting of the film by clerical and government authorities, it was a major critical success when first released and has consistently been considered one of the greatest films ever made since 1928. It has been praised and referenced by many film directors and musicians. Plot After having led the French in numerous battles against the English during the Hundred Years' War, Joan of Arc is captured near Compiegne and eventually brought to Rouen, Normandy to stand trial for heresy by French clergymen loyal to the English. On 30 May 1431, Joan is interrogated by the French clerical court. Her judges, who are on the side of the Burgundian-English coalition, and against the King of France, try to make her say something that will discredit her claim or shake her belief that she has been given a mission by God to drive the English from France, but she remains steadfast. One or two of them, believing that she is indeed a saint, support her. The authorities then resort to deception. A priest reads a false letter to the illiterate prisoner supposedly from King Charles VII of France, telling her to trust in the bearer. When that too fails, Joan is taken to view the torture chamber, but the sight, though it causes her to faint, does not intimidate her. When she is threatened with burning at the stake, Joan (Jeanne) finally breaks and allows a priest to guide her hand in signing a confession. However, the judge then condemns her to life imprisonment. As the jailer shaves her head, however, she realises she has been unfaithful to God. She demands that the judges return and she recants her confession. As more and more around her begin to recognise her true faith and calling, she is permitted a final communion mass. She is then dressed in sack-cloth and taken to the place of execution. She helps the executioner tie her bonds. The crowds gather and the fire is lit. As the flames rise, the women weep and a man cries out, \\"vous avez br√ªl√© une sainte\\" (\\"you have burned a saint\\"). The troops prepare for a riot. As the flames consume Joan, the troops and crowd clash and people are killed. Joan is consumed by the flames, but they protect her soul as it rises to heaven.Dreyer, Carl Theodor. Four Screenplays.

He claimed that the final decision on the film's subject was determined by drawing matches. Joan of Arc was in the news after World War I, having been canonized as a saint by the Roman Catholic Church in 1920, and named one of the patron saints of France.Wakeman, John. World Film Directors, Volume 1. The H. W. Wilson Company. 1987. p. 268. . Dreyer spent over a year and a half researching Joan, the script based on the original transcripts of her trial, condensing 29 interrogations over the course of 18 months into one day.Wakeman. p. 268. The rights to Joseph Delteil's 1925 anti-conformist book on Joan was bought for the production. Nothing from Delteil's book was used in the film, however, he was credited as a source.Dreyer. p. 21. In an essay for the Danish Film Institute, Dreyer stated what he sought to achieve: \\"I wanted to interpret a hymn to the triumph of the soul over life.\\" \\"Realized Mysticism in The Passion of Joan of Arc by Carl Theodor Dreyer The Criterion Collection (8 November 1999); retrieved 15 September 2020 Casting Joan of Arc was Ren√©e Jeanne Falconetti's second and last film role. Although she always preferred the art of theater to cinema and said she never understood the positive reaction to the film's acting, Falconetti's performance achieved iconic status in film history almost immediately.Criterion. Interview with H√©l√®ne Falconetti. Dreyer had gone to see Falconetti backstage at a performance of Victor Margueritte's La Gar√ßonne, a comedic play in which she was appearing. He was initially unimpressed, but upon seeing her a second time the day after, Dreyer said he \\"felt there was something in her which could be brought out; something she could give, something, therefore, I could take. For behind the make-up, behind the pose and that ravishing modern appearance, there was something. There was a soul behind that facade.\\"Milne. p. 95. Dreyer asked her to do some screen tests the next day, but without any make-up. During the tests, he \\"found in her face exactly what I wanted for Joan: a country girl, very sincere, but also a woman of suffering.\\"Milne. pp. 95-96. Dreyer then told Falconetti about the film and her role in great detail. She agreed to star in the film, secretly hoping that she would not have to cut her hair or forgo make-up. Jean Renoir praised her performance and said \\"That shaven head was and remains the abstraction of the whole epic of Joan of Arc.\\" She was famously treated harshly by Dreyer, who had a reputation for being a tyrannical director. Dreyer would always clear the set whenever Falconetti needed to act in a particularly emotional or important scene, allowing her to focus without any distractions. Dreyer often had difficulties explaining himself to Falconetti and was known to turn bright red and begin stammering when passionately directing her.Milne. p. 97. Dreyer had stated that a director \\"must be careful never to force his own interpretation on an actor, because an actor cannot create truth and pure emotions on command. One cannot push feelings out. They have to arise from themselves, and it is the director's and actor's work in unison to bring them to that point.\\" Later in post-production, Falconetti was the only cast member to watch the rushes and the film's editing. According to critic Roger Ebert: > For Falconetti, the performance was an ordeal. Legends from the set tell of > Dreyer forcing her to kneel painfully on stone and then wipe all expression > from her face‚Äîso that the viewer would read suppressed or inner pain. He > filmed the same shots again and again, hoping that in the editing room he > could find exactly the right nuance in her facial expression. Among the other cast members was French playwright Antonin Artaud as the monk Massieu. Artaud later stated that the film was meant to \\"reveal Joan as the victim of one of the most terrible of all perversions: the perversion of a divine principle in its passage through the minds of men, whether they be Church, Government or what you will.\\"Milne. pp. 106-107. Cinematography Falconetti in a scene from the film. Dreyer dug holes in the set to achieve the low camera angles seen here. The camerawork of The Passion of Joan of Arc was highly unconventional in its radical emphasis on the actors' facial features. Dreyer shot much of the film in close-up, stating, \\"There were questions, there were answers- very short, very crisp... Each question, each answer, quite naturally called for a close-up... In addition, the result of the close-ups was that the spectator was as shocked as Joan was, receiving the questions, tortured by them.\\" Dreyer also did not allow his actors to wear makeup, the better to tell the story through their expressions‚Äîthis choice was made possible through use of the recently developed panchromatic film, which recorded skin tones in a naturalistic manner. Dreyer often shot the priests and Joan's other interrogators in high contrast lighting, but then shot Joan in soft, even lighting.Milne. p. 103. Rudolph Mat√©'s high-contrast cinematography also allowed unappealing details in people's faces, such as warts and lumps, to be fully visible. In addition, Dreyer employed many low- angle shots of Joan's persecutors so that they would appear more monstrous and intimidating; in the effort to do this, several holes were dug on the set for the camera to film from the appropriate angle, causing the crew to nickname him \\"Carl Gruy√©re\\". Dreyer also shot the film \\"from the first to the last scene ... in the right order.\\" Art direction The film had one of the most expensive sets ever built for a European film up to that time.The Criterion Collection. The Passion of Joan of Arc DVD. Special features: Production design. 1999. Upon being given a budget of seven million francs, Dreyer constructed an enormous octagonal concrete set to depict Rouen Castle. Production designers Hermann Warm and Jean Hugo were inspired by medieval miniatures for their designs, adding unnatural angles and perspectives to add to Joan's emotional state of mind. They also relied on medieval manuscripts with accurate architectural drawings, such as John Mandeville's Livre de Merveilles.Criterion. Production design. The huge set was built as one complete, interconnecting structure instead of in separate locations. The castle had towers in all four corners with concrete walls running along the sides. Each wall was 10 centimeters thick so that they could support the weight of actors, technicians and equipment. A functional drawbridge was also built into one of the walls. Inside the walls were small houses, the courtyard where the burning took place and a cathedral. The entire set was painted pink so that it would appear grey in the black and white film and contrast against the white sky above it. Despite all of the detail put into the set, only segments of it are ever visible in the film,Milne, Tom. The Cinema of Carl Dreyer. New York: A. S. Barnes & Co. 1971. SBN 498-07711-X. p. 94. which later angered the film's producers since so much money was spent on the set. Dreyer later expressed, however, that the scope of the set heightened the abilities of the actors and actresses to give convincing performances. \\"When the first rounds of the film were released the producers were horrified to find that the rebuilt city was not featured in the film. Dreyer explained that the city was not for the film, but rather for the actors so that they could experience the milieu of the old city for themselves.\\" Hermann Warm's original models for the film's set are currently stored at the Danish Film Institute Archives. Release and different versions The Passion of Joan of Arc debuted on 21 April 1928 at the Palads Teatret cinema in Copenhagen. After a few private screenings, it finally premiered in Paris on 25 October 1928 at the Cinema Marivaux. The film's release was delayed due to the persistent efforts of many French nationalists ‚Äì who objected to the fact that Dreyer was neither Catholic nor French, and to the then-rumored casting of Lillian Gish as Joan. As early as January 1927, Jean-Jose Frappa said that \\"whatever the talent of the director (and he has it)...he cannot give us a Joan of Arc in the true French tradition. And the American 'star'...cannot be our Joan, wholesome, lively, shining with purity, faith, courage and patriotism. To let this be made in France would be a scandalous abdication of responsibility.\\"Criterion. Version History. Before its French premiere, several cuts were made by order of the Archbishop of Paris and by government censors. Dreyer was angered by these cuts, as he had no control over them. Later that year on 6 December, a fire at UFA studios in Berlin destroyed the film's original negative; only a few copies of Dreyer's original cut of the film existed. Dreyer was able to patch together a new version of the original cut using alternate and initially unused takes. This version was also destroyed in a 1929 lab fire. Over the next four decades, it became difficult to find copies of Dreyer's second version, and copies of the original were thought to be even scarcer. It was re-released in 1933 in a 61-minute cut which included a new narration by radio star David Ross, but no intertitles. In 1951, Joseph-Marie Lo Duca found a copy of the negative of Dreyer's second version in the Gaumont Studios vaults. Lo Duca then made several significant changes, including the addition of a Baroque score and the replacing of many intertitles with subtitles. For many years, Lo Duca's version was the only one available. Dreyer himself objected to this cut, however. The next version of the film was produced by Arnie Krogh of the Danish Film Institute. Krogh cut together scenes and sequences from several different available prints to attempt to create a cut that was as true to Dreyer's original vision as possible. Rediscovery of original version The original version was lost for decades after a fire destroyed the master negative and only variations of Dreyer's second version were available. In 1981, an employee of the Dikemark Hospital mental institution in Oslo found several film canisters in a janitor's closet that were labeled as being The Passion of Joan of Arc. The canisters were sent to the Norwegian Film Institute where they were first stored for three years until finally being examined. It was then discovered that they were Dreyer's original cut prior to government or church censorship. There were never any records of the film being shipped to Oslo, but film historians believe that the then director of the institution may have requested a special copy since he was also a published historian. Reception On its initial release, the film was a critical success and immediately called a masterpiece. It was a huge financial flop and caused the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale to cancel its contract with Dreyer after the failure of this film and of Abel Gance's Napol√©on. Dreyer angrily accused the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale of mutilating the film so as to avoid offending Catholic viewers and sued them for breach of contract. The lawsuit went on until the fall of 1931, during which time Dreyer was unable to make another film. It was banned in Britain for its portrayal of crude English soldiers who mock and torment Joan in scenes that mirror biblical accounts of Christ's mocking at the hands of Roman soldiers. The archbishop of Paris was also critical, demanding changes be made to the film. The New York Times film reviewer Mordaunt Hall raved: > ... as a film work of art this takes precedence over anything that has so > far been produced. It makes worthy pictures of the past look like tinsel > shams. It fills one with such intense admiration that other pictures appear > but trivial in comparison. Of the star, he wrote, \\"... it is the gifted performance of Maria Falconetti as the Maid of Orleans that rises above everything in this artistic achievement.\\" However Variety gave the film a negative review on its initial release, calling it \\"a deadly tiresome picture.\\" In 1929 The National Board of Review named the film one of the best foreign films of the year. Legacy The film and Falconetti's performance have continued to be praised by critics. Pauline Kael wrote that Falconetti's portrayal \\"may be the finest performance ever recorded on film.\\" Roger Ebert praised the film and said that \\"You cannot know the history of silent film unless you know the face of Ren√©e Maria Falconetti.\\" Jean S√©molu√© called it \\"a film of confrontation\\" and Paul Schrader has praised \\"the architecture of Joan's world, which literally conspires against her; like the faces of her inquisitors, the halls, doorways, furniture are on the offensive, striking, swooping at her with oblique angles, attacking her with hard-edged chunks of black and white.\\" Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote that \\"Dreyer's radical approach to constructing space and the slow intensity of his mobile style make[s] this ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù in the sense that, like all the greatest films, it reinvents the world from the ground up.\\" Some critics have found faults in the film, and Paul Rotha called it \\"one of the most remarkable productions ever realized in the history and development of cinema, but it was not a full exposition of real filmic properties\\". Tom Milne stated that \\"somehow the style Dreyer found for the film seems irremediably false. Instead of flowing naturally from his chosen materials...it seems imposed upon them...Throughout the film there is a constant stylistic uncertainty, an impurity, which jars heavily today,\\" but adds that \\"Jeanne d'Arc has a majestic power which steamrollers its way through all its faults and excesses.\\" The Passion of Joan of Arc has appeared on Sight & Sound magazine's top ten films poll five times: as number seven in 1952 and 1972, as number ten (Critic's List) and six (Director's List) in 1992 and as number nine in 2012 (Critic's List). It ranked thirty-seventh on the Director's List in 2012 and was listed by such filmmakers as Manoel de Oliveira, Atom Egoyan, Tsai Ming-Liang, Walter Salles, B√©la Tarr, Michael Mann, who called it \\"Human experience conveyed purely from the visualisation of the human face: no one else has composed and realised human beings quite like Dreyer in The Passion of Joan of Arc\\", and Kutlug Ataman, who said the film \\"taught me film could be just poetry and timeless.\\" The Village Voice ranked it the eighth of the twentieth century in a 2000 poll of critics.100 Best Films ‚Äì Village Voice.

MusicScores of Dreyer's lifetime= Different scores were used for the two premieres of the Passion of Joan of Arc in Copenhagen and Paris. The music of the Paris version, for orchestra and singers, has survived and has been revived. It was composed by Leo Pouget and Victor Alix, who as well as being film composers, both wrote operettas; Pouget was coming to the end of his career, whereas Alix was regarded by Le M√©nestrel as becoming an established composer.Le M√©nestrel. Vol. 94 no. 19 (6 May 1932): 200. Accessed via RIPM (subscription required). Their score for the Passion of Joan of Arc has been seen in recent years as having some limitations,Gillian Anderson, The Passion of Joan of Arc but seems to have been regarded as acceptable at the time. In the 1920s, film music was normally played live in the theatre. However, some of the Pouget/Alix score was recorded. In 1929, selections were released in 78 format in a performance by \\"l'orchestre symphonique du Lutetia Wagram\\" (the Lutetia Wagram being a large Parisian cinema of the time, since demolished). Dreyer also heard the soundtrack of Joseph-Marie Lo Duca's version of the film which came out in the 1950s. It featured Bach, Albinoni and Vivaldi: Dreyer disapproved; he appears not to have encountered a score which he considered definitive. =Musical accompaniment since 1968= Since Dreyer's death and the rediscovery of the original print, numerous composers have provided music for the film. * In 1988, the Dutch composer Jo van den Booren wrote a modern score for symphony orchestra.Jo van den Booren.

The college was established in 1869 by Emily Davies and Barbara Bodichon as the first women's college in Cambridge. In 1948, it was granted full college status by the university, marking the official admittance of women to the university. In 1976, it was the first Cambridge women's college to become coeducational. The main College site, situated on the outskirts of the village of Girton, about 2.5 miles (4 km) northwest of the university town, comprises of land. In a typical Victorian red brick design, most was built by architect Alfred Waterhouse between 1872 and 1887. It provides extensive sports facilities, an indoor swimming pool, an award-winning library and a chapel with two organs. There is an accommodation annexe, known as Swirles Court, situated in the Eddington neighborhood of the North West Cambridge development. Swirles opened in 2017 and provides up to 325 en-suite single rooms for graduates, and for second-year undergraduates and above. The college has a reputation for admitting a high number of UK state-school students, its community feel and for musical talent. Several art collections are held on the main site, including People's Portraits, the millennial exhibition of the Royal Society of Portrait Painters, and an Egyptian collection containing the world's most reproduced portrait mummy. Among Girton's notable alumni are Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, UK Supreme Court President Lady Hale, HuffPost co-founder Arianna Huffington, the comedian/author Sandi Toksvig, the comedian/broadcaster/GP Phil Hammond, the economist Joan Robinson, and the anthropologist Marilyn Strathern, also Mistress from 1998 to 2009. Its sister college is Somerville College, one of the first two women's colleges of Oxford. History Main gate with porter's lodge 1869 to 1976: Pioneering for women's education The early feminist movement began to argue for the improvement of women's education in the 1860s: Emily Davies and Barbara Bodichon met through their activism at the Society for the Employment of Women and the Englishwoman's Review.Stephen 1933, p.6 They shared the aim of securing women's admission to university.Stephen 1933, p.7 In particular, they wanted to determine whether girls could be admitted at Oxford or Cambridge to sit the Senior and Junior Local Examinations.Megson and Lindsay 1961, pp.1‚Äì2 Davies and Bodichon set up a committee to that effect in 1862. In 1865, with the help of Henry Tomkinson, Trinity College alumnus and owner of an insurance company with good contacts within the University,Bradbrook 1969, p.7 91 female students entered the Cambridge Local Examination.Megson and Lindsay 1961, p.2 This first concession to women's educational rights met relatively little resistance, as admission to the examination did not imply residence of women at the university site.Stephen 1933, p.10 Water colour by the architect of Girton College Alfred Waterhouse At that time, students had the option of doing a Pass degree, which consisted of \\"a disorderly collection of fragmented learning\\",Brooke p.209 or an Honours degree, which at that time meant the Mathematics Tripos, classics, natural or moral sciences. An Honours degree was considered more challenging than the Pass degree. In 1869, Henry Sidgwick helped institute the Examinations for Women, which was designed to be of intermediate difficulty.Winstanley 1977 p.154 This idea was heavily opposed by Emily Davies, as she demanded admittance to the Tripos examinations.Stephen 1933, p.23 The college was established on 16 October 1869 under the name of the College for Women at Benslow House in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, which was considered to be a convenient distance from Cambridge and London.Jones 1913, pp.16‚Äì17 It was thought to be less \\"risky\\" and less controversial to locate the college away from Cambridge in the beginning.Stephen 1933, p.25 The college was one of England's first residential colleges for women. (Whitelands College, now part of the University of Roehampton, was established as a college of higher education for women earlier, in 1841.) They worked with Fanny Metcalfe to develop the curricula. In July and October 1869, entrance examinations were held in London, to which 21 candidates came; 16 passed.Stephen 1933, p.24 The first term started on 16 October 1869, when five students began their studies: Emily Gibson, Anna Lloyd, Louisa Lumsden, Isabella Townshend and Sarah Woodhead.Jones 1913, p.20Stephen 1933, p.26 Elizabeth Adelaide Manning was also registered as a student, although with the intention of staying for a single term, and her step-mother Charlotte Manning was the first Mistress. The first three students to unofficially sit the Tripos exams in Lent term 1873, Rachel Cook and Lumsden, who both took the Classical Tripos, as well as Woodhead, who took the Mathematical Tripos, were known as \\"The Pioneers\\".Jones 1913, p.30 Through fundraising, ¬£7,000 were collected, which allowed for the purchase of land either at Hitchin or near Cambridge in 1871.Jones 1913, p.18 By 1872, sixteen acres of land at the present site were acquired near the village of Girton.Megson and Lindsay 1961, p.17 The college was then renamed Girton College, and opened at the new location in October 1873. The buildings had cost ¬£12,000,Jones 1913, p.40 and consisted of a single block which comprised the east half of Old Wing.Bradbrook 1969, p.161 At the time, thirteen students were admitted.Jones 1913, p.5 The Great Hall is a grand Victorian hall featuring wood panelling and large dominating arched windows In 1876, Old Wing was completed, and Taylor's Knob, the college laboratory and half of the Hospital Wing was built. In the following year, Caroline Croom Robertson joined the management team as secretary to reduce the load on Emily Davies. In 1884, Hospital Wing was completed, and Orchard Wing, Stanley Library and the Old Kitchens added. At that time, Girton had 80 students. By 1902, Tower Wing, Chapel Wing and Woodlands Wing as well as the Chapel and the Hall were finished, which allowed the college to accommodate 180 students. In 1921, a committee was appointed to draft a charter for the college. By summer 1923 the committee had completed the task, and on 21 August 1924 the King granted the charter to \\"the Mistress and Governors of Girton College\\" as a Body Corporate.Stephen 1933, 120‚Äì121 Girton was not officially a college yet, nor were its members part of the University. Girton and Newnham were classed as \\"recognised institutions for the higher education for women\\", not colleges of the university. On 27 April 1948, women were admitted to full membership of the University of Cambridge, and Girton College received the status of a college of the university. 1976 to present: Pioneering for sexual equality Social and cultural changes in the post-war period led to an increasing number of British universities to become co-educational. In Cambridge, Churchill College, King's College and Clare College were the first men's colleges to admit women in 1972.Horsler and Strathern 2005, p.58 Girton had already amended its statutes in 1971 in such a way as to allow the admission of men should the Governing Body vote in favour at an unspecified date in the future.Horsler and Strathern 2005, p.63 The decision to become mixed came in November 1976, when the Governing Body voted to act upon the statute, which made Girton the first women's college to admit men.Horsler and Strathern 2005, p.17 In January 1977, the first two male Fellows, Frank Wilkinson and John Marks, arrived, followed by male graduate students in 1978, and, finally, undergraduates in October 1979.Horsler and Strathern 2005, p.19 One reason for the change was that the first mixed colleges in Cambridge immediately shot to the top of the Tripos league tables, as they seemed to attract bright students, who preferred to stay in co-educational colleges.Horsler and Strathern 2005, p.80 Girton became co-residential as well, which meant that male and female students shared the same facilities. Only one all-female corridor in which rooms were reserved exclusively for women remained. Upon the arrival of male undergraduates, JCR and MCR social facilities had to be enlarged. The college bar was opened in 1979 as well as rugby, cricket and soccer pitches provided from 1982 onwards.Horsler and Strathern 2005, p.73Horsler and Strathern 2005, p.40 In the 22-year period from 1997 to 2019, the Tompkins Table annual ranking of Cambridge colleges by undergraduate academic performance ranked Girton College an average of 20 out of the 29 colleges researched. In 2019, it came 20th, with 22% of all undergraduate students gaining a First class. Mistresses The Mistress is the formal head of the college. Her main task is to exercise general superintendence over the college's affairs. She presides the College Council and several college committees. The Mistress is elected by the council, and has to reside at the college precincts for at least two-thirds of each term, or 210 days of each academic year.Girton College Statutes 2009 p.7 Ever since the establishment of Girton college, this position has been held by a female, even though male candidates have had equal rights for running for the office since 1976 and would, if elected, be called by the female term \\"Mistress\\".Girton College Statutes 2009 p.26f. The current Mistress is Susan J. Smith, who has held the position since 2009. Accommodation and Fees Undergraduate room (grade A) at college main site The cost of undergraduate and graduate accommodation, at ¬£180.50 per week, is the most expensive of all 31 Cambridge colleges, but Girton is unique in setting a cohort charge, which means that the price of accommodation is fixed for an incoming cohort for the three years of their degree, whilst students at other colleges are subject to unknown rent rises every year. The college consults regularly with the JCR and MCR on its policy of charging equal rents for all non-en suite rooms. All students, regardless of whether or not they live in college, are also charged a ¬£100 per term (¬£300 per year) \\"facilities charge\\" for the right to use college grounds and services, which is in effect a tuition fee specific to Girton College students. Students at Girton College can expect to pay several thousand pounds more for the cost of accommodation over the length of their degree than at most other colleges. The Cambridge Student writes in 2018: \\"An investigation carried out by TCS has revealed that, at the lower end of the scale, ¬£70 a week is enough to stay at Peterhouse and Trinity Hall, while Girtonians must shell out ¬£160 for even the worst rooms. Such a huge spread of minimum rents creates significant disparities in a less well off student‚Äôs ability to enjoy Cambridge life, especially given that many are not aware of the price of accommodation when applying.\\" Undergraduates Girton, along with Newnham College, are the only colleges to charge the same fee for undergraduate accommodation on their premises. The main site offers 348 rooms, rented for the entire year (38 or 39 weeks, depending on the term dates). The weekly rent for the incoming undergraduate cohort of 2019/20 was ¬£180.50.. Rooms in the main site are arranged along corridors, which makes it possible to walk from one location in the building to another without going outside. Some of the rooms originally designed as sets by Alfred Waterhouse. The rooms range in several quality grades but are all charged at the same weekly rate. Every year, a ballot is organised by the JCR to determine room distribution. To first years, rooms are allocated randomly. It is customary for Cambridge colleges to provide accommodation for the first three-year undergraduate students. Most undergraduate students live in the main site, and second years have the option of living at Swirles Court, or at one of the college houses: The college owns six houses along Girton Road, another one located opposite the college on Huntingdon Road called The Gate and one house located on the college grounds, called The Grange. These houses are available for second and third year undergraduates. Graduates and Fellows Since 2017, Graduate students live in Swirles Court. It is part of the Eddington development in West Cambridge. One house on Huntingdon Road is used to accommodate research fellows. The Graduate Union specifically identified Girton as providing an insufficient amount of housing to married postgraduates, with no rooms available at Swirles Court for married students. Girton is, however, one of only two Cambridge colleges that guarantees ensuite accommodation for all graduate students. Swirles Court =Swirles Court= Swirles Court, part of the Eddington neighbourhood of the North West Cambridge Development, opened in 2017. Girton's graduate accommodation is the farthest from the city centre among all Cambridge (and Oxford) colleges, the most expensive of all Cambridge colleges, and a kilometre further from the college main site and dining facilities. The bus ride to the city centre takes approximately 20 minutes. Named after Bertha Swirles (Lady Jeffreys), a Girton alumna, it provides 325 en-suite rooms for graduate students. Unlike the main college site, which closes for two weeks during Christmas break, Swirles is open year-round to student living. It also has a college porter on staff 24/7, separate laundry facilities, and a separate mailing address from the main college. Girton College does not own Swirles Court but leases it on a five-year renewable contract from the university. =Wolfson Court= In 2017, Girton College moved the graduate accommodation from Wolfson Court (half a kilometre from the city centre) to Swirles Court (five kilometres away). Wolfson Court was an annexe to Girton College built on a site. It was funded by the 1969 Centenary Appeal, and designed in 1971 by Cambridge architects David Roberts and Geoffrey Clarke.Brown 1999, p.42 It had its own catering and accommodation facilities (106 single student rooms). Queen Elizabeth Court, which was linked to the main building and comprised two blocks of three linked houses (36 large single student rooms), was built for the purpose of graduate accommodation in 1992. It was frequently used as a location for conferences. The site also contained a nursery, operated by Bright Horizons. Main site=Architecture The initial and defining parts of the college were designed by Alfred Waterhouse: The architect built the main site with the Old Wing, the Hospital Wing, the Orchard Wing, the Stanley library and Old Kitchens between 1873 and 1886, as well as the parapetted gatehouse tower in 1886 and 1887. The red brick design (English bond) is typical of Victorian architecture, and is enhanced by black mortar courses and terracotta details to the eaves, windows and doorways.English heritage 1981 The roofs are steeply pitched with crested tiles. In 1913, the site consisted of 33 acres.Jones 1913, p.39 Library The College library's upper reading room Girton's first library, the Stanley library, was established in 1884 with a donation from Lady Stanley of Alderley.Bradbrook 1969, p.61 It was considered to be luxurious and comfortable, as it contained stained-glass windows, leather furniture and a large chimney. Books were acquired mostly through donations. By 1932 the collection had become so large that a new library was opened. Designed by Michael Waterhouse, descendant of the architects Paul Waterhouse and Alfred Waterhouse, the new library consisted of an upper reading room, crafted in oak, and a ground floor, in which the book collections are held. An annexe containing archives was added in 1967. The Duke building, a modern library extension offering IT facilities and a reading room, was opened in 2005. Named after Alison Duke, a fellow and major donor, the building was designed by Allies and Morrison. It won a national RIBA award in 2006, a SCONUL Library Design Award in 2007, and a Civic Trust Award in 2007. Chapel The chapel's south facing window Emily Davies first mooted plans for a chapel in Girton college in 1890; however, building only started in 1899,Bradbrook 1952 four years after the death of Henrietta Stanley, Baroness Stanley of Alderley, who had opposed the idea and instead favoured improving staff salaries and equipment. The chapel, which was designed by Alfred and Paul Waterhouse, was completed in 1901, and inaugurated on 23 May 1902. It seats about 200 people and the interior is held very simply with the exception of oak carvings at the Chancel end and on two long desks in front of the choir seats, which were crafted by the mathematician Margaret Meyer, along with students and friends of the college.Jones 1913 In 1910 came a fine Harrison & Harrison organ, the purchase of which was made possible through donations from students and friends of the college.Jones 1913, p.46 The organ was rebuilt in 1974 and can still be found in the college chapel. A second organ was acquired in 2002. In 1952, the year of the Golden Jubilee of the inauguration, a stained glass window was erected. In the Girton Review, the college's official termly newsletter, from Michaelmas term 1955, a description of the glass window can be found: > The centre light depicts Our Lord in Majesty, as it were the culmination of > the Tree of Jesse and in the form described in the book of Revelation. The > Lamb who may alone open the book sealed with seven seals is shown at the > foot of the light, while the descent of the Holy Spirit in the form of a > dove is shown at its apex. The flowers and fruit in the centre light > represent the Tree of Jesse. The two lights flanking that in the centre > depict scenes from the Passion of Our Lord. On the left are the entry into > Jerusalem, the Betrayal of Judas and the Ecce Homo: on the right, the > Scourging, Christ bearing His Cross, the Crucifixion. The scenes are linked > with a pattern of leaves. Palm is used for the Entry into Jerusalem, and > among other plants represented are the Star of Bethlehem, the Passion Flower > and the Thorn. The lowest medallion on the right, portraying the > crucifixion, is darker than the others, suggesting the darkness that was > over the land. The uppermost tracery light depicts the Pelican in her Piety, > and the remaining tracery lights contain the symbols of the Passion; the > betrayal money, Peter‚Äôs lantern, pillar and scourges, dice, ladder and > nails, hammer and pincers, crown of thorns and chalice. In the original statement of aims and scope for the 'Proposed College for Women' in 1867, it was announced that religious services and instruction would be in accordance with the principles of the Church of England, but where conscientious objections were entertained, attendance would not be necessary. A modified version of this statement appears in the modern college statutes, where it reads that \\"services in the Chapel shall normally be held in accordance with the practice of the Church of England, but other religious services may also be held there.\\"Girton College Statutes 2009 p.18 At the outset, Chapel was used for morning prayers, usually said by the Mistress, and for Sunday services, taken by clergy of various denominations.Megson and Lindsay 1961, p.45 Today, at least two services are held on a weekly basis: Evensong on Sunday at 5:30pm, and Compline on Tuesday at 10pm. They are organised by the college's part-time chaplain, who is assisted by student chapel wardens.College chapel GC 2010 The Mistress holds general responsibility in regard to services in the chapel, which she partly delegates to the Chapel Committee. The current Chaplain is the Reverend Dr Malcolm Guite, a poet and singer-songwriter, who is also a bye-fellow at Girton.Girton College, University of Cambridge, Malcolm Guite, Chaplain (faculty page). Retrieved 19 July 2015. Gardens Girton College's duck pond with the Great Hall in the background When the land was bought, trees were planted on bare land.Jones 1913, p.6 Today, the gardens of Girton are large compared to those of other Cambridge colleges.Brown 1999, p.7 They became a preoccupation for the college in 1875 when Miss Davies handed over the responsibility for developing the gardens to Miss Bernard.Brown 1999, p.43 A pond, which originated from excavations for the construction of the Stanley library and the Orchard Wing, dates from 1884.Brown 1999, p.16 A 1983 report of the college ornithologists' society found sixty species of birds, and a moth report from 1986 recorded over 100 species.Brown 1999, p.39 The Fellows' garden was redesigned in 1992 and hosts a green theatre.Brown 1999, p.40 Outdoor plays are no longer performed in the Fellows' garden because of noise from the A14.Strathern 2005, p.41 A rare breed of black squirrels can sometimes be seen in Girton. Lawrence Room Eliza Baker Court In 1934, the Lawrence Room on the college main site was dedicated to be the college museum. Named after Girton natural scientist Amy Lawrence, it houses an Anglo- Saxon, an Egyptian and a Mediterranean collection. Before the establishment of the Lawrence room in 1934, antiquities had been stored in and around the college library. Donations allowed for refurbishments in 1946, 1961, 1991 and 2008. In 2010/11, Lawrence room is opened once a week to visitors. The exhibitions are free of charge. The Anglo-Saxon collection stems from excavations on the college main site made during construction work in 1881 and 1886, when an Anglo-Saxon cemetery, presumably from the fifth and sixth century AD, was discovered. Most findings, such as domestic utensils and personal items, were long held in the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Cambridge. Some were only returned to the college as late as in 2008. The highlight of the Egyptian collection consists of a portrait mummy bearing the inscription Hermion√™ Grammatik√™ (translation: 'Hermione the literary lady' or 'Hermione the language teacher'). It is one of the most widely reproduced and famous portrait mummies. Dating from the first century AD, it was discovered in the Roman cemetery of Hawara by the archeologist Flinders Petrie in 1911. 'Hermione' is thought to be an 18- to 25-year-old girl from a wealthy background. Petrie and his wife Hilda wanted the mummy to go to a women's college due to its inscription. Funds were gathered, and in 1911 'Hermione' moved to Girton college, where she has remained since then. The Egyptian collection also holds four mummified baby crocodiles, which were thought to bring favour of Sobek, the ancient god of fertility and water. They were presented to the college by Alfred Waterhouse senior, the father of architect Alfred Waterhouse. The Mediterranean collection offers both Classical and pre- Classical material. A collection of Greek Tanagra figurines, which date to the fourth and third century BC, form the most remarkable pieces of this collection. People's Portraits Since 2002, Girton has held the millennial exhibition of the Royal Society of Portrait Painters, entitled People's Portraits. The exhibition, aimed at showing \\"ordinary\\" British people at the verge of the 21st century, toured Britain in 2000. Girton then won the bid to house the collection, to which new works are added annually. All pictures were created by members of the Royal Society of Portrait Painters. The collection currently comprises 45 paintings, and artists include Anthony Morris, Daphne Todd, June Mendoza and Alastair Adams, the current president of the Society. The choice of Girton, one of the largest and thus most diverse colleges in Cambridge, to hold the collection is believed to reflect the college ethos of community and interest in art. Student life= Sport teams  Girton College Boat Club take part in the May Bumps Girton College is the only Cambridge College with an indoor heated swimming pool. It is Grade II listed. Girton college has a variety of student-run sports teams and it provides its own sports pitches for cricket, football, hockey, lacrosse, netball and volleyball. An extensive refurbishment of the pitches was completed in 2009. There are men's and women's teams for badminton, football, hockey, rowing (Girton College Boat Club) and rugby. Hockey has a mixed team as well. Cricket, cross country, lacrosse, netball, squash, swimming, table tennis, tennis, volleyball and waterpolo teams are open to both male and female participants. The college has outdoor tennis and indoor squash courts, and a gym. The indoor-heated swimming pool has been in use since 1900.Jones 1913 p.42 A one-mile running path leads around the college grounds. College alumni are currently raising money in order to build a new sports pavilion. In 1995 the men's football team won Cuppers for the first time and in 1997-98 they followed this up by winning their first League Championship. in 2003‚Äì04, Girton won the League Championship for a second time.  Music  The college has a strong history of music, which is supported by the university's Chairman of the Faculty Board of Music, also Director of Studies in Music at Girton. In the last decade, the college has consistently been within the top three colleges for music in the university. In 2005, the highest ever first- class honours in the music Tripos was attained by a Girtonian. The student-run and fellow-led Girton College Music Society hosts weekly concerts in term time, as well as termly orchestral concerts. The college provides four practice grand pianos (including a Steinway Model B), a double-manual harpsichord and two organs. Moreover, all undergraduate music students are provided with a practice piano in their room for the duration of their course. The chapel's organ is a four-manual, crafted by the Swiss firm St. Martin and acquired in 2002. The chapel choir has 28 members and sings Choral Evensong (Sunday) and Compline (Tuesday) in the college chapel every week. The choir has released eight CDs. Girton grants two undergraduate organ scholarships for ¬£300 per annum, choral scholarships for ¬£100 per annum each, and choral exhibitions.  Societies  Admitting undergraduate students studying all subjects except for the Education Tripos, the college hosts a variety of student-run societies which cater for a wide range of interests. Seven subjects have their own societies: Biology, History, Economics (Joan Robinson society), Geography, Music, Medicine and Law. There is furthermore the Art society, the Film society and the Girton Amateur Dramatic Society (GADS) which produces around two plays per term. Finally, Girton Amnesty and the Orchestra on the Hill serve students with specific interest in human rights and music, respectively.  Spring Ball  Girton Spring Ball is understood to have evolved from a traditional dance, the earliest record of which dates to 1883; it was only in the mid-1900s that the Ball began to resemble its contemporary form, notably in 1969 when the College celebrated its centenary anniversary. Currently, the Ball is usually held biennially on the Friday after the end of Lent term, contrasting with most other Cambridge Colleges who host May Balls. It is organised by a committee of around 20 current Girton students. Recent Girton Balls have become much larger and more decadent than their earlier counterparts and the majority of the College site is now included in the Ball area. The 2016 Spring Ball, to feature headliners Tinchy Stryder and Bipolar Sunshine, was anticipated to be the largest and greatest Girton Ball to date. It ultimately received widespread media attention when it was cancelled by Girton College Council following the death of a student at the college. Cancellation was then implemented and overseen almost exclusively by senior officials of the college, with all ticket holders receiving full refunds. On 13 March 2020, the college held its Spring Ball, which was the culminating event of the college's 150th anniversary celebrations. Despite the oncoming Coronavirus and national lockdown set to begin the next week, the event still went ahead with about 1,000 guests.

Tomkinson, Madame Bodichon (n√©e Leigh Smith), Henrietta Stanley, Baroness Stanley of Alderley (daughter of the 13th Viscount Dillon), and Miss Emily Davies who did not have arms and was instead represented by the Welsh colours, vert and argent. The Rev. Edward Earle Dorling submitted a great variety of designs to the council, however the task was not easy. \\"A patch-work of elaborate charges and many colours was to be avoided. Mr Tomkinson's fascinating martlets and Lady Stanley's lion had to be abandoned with regret, as was also a design of green and silver chequers which would have given more prominence to Miss Davies.\\"Girton Review, Michaelmas 1928, pp. 2‚Äì4 Finally in 1928 the design was accepted by all and the college was granted the following: > We ‚Ä¶ grant and assign unto The Mistress and Governors of Girton College the > Arms following that is to say: Quarterly Vert and Argent a cross flory > countercharged a Roundel Ermine and in the second and third quarters a > Crescent Gules, ‚Ä¶ to be borne and used for ever, hereafter by the Mistress > and Governors of Girton College and by their Successors upon Seals Shields > or otherwise according to the Laws of Arms. Gown The college gown has the standard pattern of an undergraduate gown at the University of Cambridge, with the sleeves sewn up for a length of eight inches from the shoulder. The proper dress of the gown and cap was observed at the first honorary degree to a woman, given to the Queen, an LL.D. on 21 October 1948. As academic dress, gowns were adopted with little changes (the sleeves had to be closed so that even in the summer, when women wear short- sleeved dresses their bare shoulders do not show), and square caps were chosen as head-dress. However, to remember the time when women were not allowed to obtain degrees of the University of Cambridge, no gowns are worn during the college feast, when students in their final year are celebrated. Graces Girton College has a traditional two-word grace and a more recent full grace, both in Latin. On regular formal occasions, such as Formal Halls, the two-word graces are spoken, Benedictus benedicat (May the blessed one give blessing) at the start of the meal, and Benedictus benedicatur (May praise be given to the blessed one) at the end of the meal. There is evidence that the two-word grace was used in 1926, and it is thought the two-word grace was used from the foundation of the college onwards. The words and the music of the full grace were composed in 1950 by Alison Duke and Jill Vlasto respectively. The grace came after the admission of women to full membership of the university so as to bring Girton in line with the other colleges. It is used on the most formal occasions, such as the Foundation Dinner, and it is sung once a year at the College Feast, which all final year students attend. Full grace (in Latin): > Benedic Domine, nobis et omnibus huius collegii alumnis, donisque tuis quae > de munificentia tua sumus iam sumpturi; et illis salubriter nutriti debitas > tibi gratias pie reddamus. Custodi, quaesumus, Domine, filios et filias et > consule necessitatibus animarum et corporum, hoc ipso momento et in > aeternum. Full grace (English translation): > Bless us, O Lord, and all members of this college, and also thy gifts, which > of thy bounty we are about to receive; and having been wholesomely nourished > by the same let us dutifully render to thee the thanks that are owed. > Protect, we beseech thee, O Lord, thy sons and daughters and provide for the > needs both of our souls and bodies, at this present time and for evermore. Songs The Girton Pioneers (tune of The British Grenadiers) honours the first three women to sit the Tripos exams The oldest college song, The Girton Pioneers, was composed by several students in Hitchin in 1873. Its purpose was to celebrate the first three students who sat the Tripos examinations in 1871.Jones 1913 p.28f. It is sung with the tune of The British Grenadiers. This is the first stanza: > Some talk of Senior Wranglers, And some of Double Firsts, And truly of their > species These are not the worst; But of all the Cambridge heroes There‚Äôs > none that can compare With Woodhead, Cook and Lumsden, The Girton Pioneers. More recently, Girtonians have become known for their chant of We are Girton ‚Äì super Girton! No one likes us, but we don't care!, in imitation of the Millwall fans' famous song: No one likes us, we don't care. The reference to no one likes us is supposedly due to the relative distance of Girton in comparison to many of the other colleges. In 2016 the Casual Choir performed Long Way to Girton College, an adaptation of It's a Long Way to Tipperary, written and arranged by two choir members. The college song I love to go a-bicycling, sung with the tune of I love to go a-wandering also alludes to Girton's 2.5 miles distance from the town centre. It has been sung since the 1960s. For example, the second stanza reads: > But when I climb up Castle Hill In the wind and squall A strong desire does > then me fill To be-e at New Hall. Chorus: Fol-de-re, Fol-de-ra, Fol-de-re, > Fol-de-ra-a-a-a- .... To be-e at New Hall. Another song, composed in 1972 by JCR president Anna Cocconi, is called Song to Wolfson Court. The annexe of the college was opened in that year. Students often found fault with the modern architecture of the building, which was less spacious and elegant than the main site. The first two stanzas go as follows: > In a wheat field, west of Cambridge, Off a lane called Clarkson Road, > Wolfson Court is standing proudly; Let its story now be told Hundred rooms > with running water, Could you ever ask for more? Not unless you choose a > boy-friend, Meas‚Äôring over five foot four!

Since 2015 it has also been known as the Wyre Forest Independent Party and has successfully contested local elections within the Wyre Forest local government area, which includes Kidderminster.http://search.electoralcommission.org.uk/English/Registrations/PP44 Dr Richard Taylor The party had one MP in the House of Commons, Dr Richard Taylor, who won a surprise landslide victory in the 2001 general election standing for the Wyre Forest constituency, which includes Kidderminster. He was the only person not from a major London-based or national party elected as an MP in the 2001 Parliament. Health Concern benefited from a decision by the Liberal Democrats not to put up a candidate of their own. Taylor was re- elected as member for Wyre Forest in the 2005 election, albeit with a considerably reduced majority. The party lost its only seat in the 2010 election to the Conservative candidate, Mark Garnier, by a margin of 2,643 votes. Dr Taylor was awarded the MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours List in 2014, for services to Worcestershire, particularly Kidderminster Hospital. Local government ICHC is also active in local government, although it has lost much support in recent years. Before the 2004 local elections it held 16 seats on Wyre Forest District Council, making it the largest party, but in those elections it lost half of these seats to the Conservative Party. The 2005 local elections to Worcestershire County Council, held on the same day as the general election, also saw Health Concern perform poorly, losing five of its six seats. However, in the 2006 local elections for the district council, it held its own, making one net gain to take its representation from eight to nine. In the 2007 local elections its representation again increased, from nine to 10 members. The party has since gradually lost further seats on Wyre Forest District Council, with just 7 seats after the 2014 elections. After the May 2014 local elections, Health Concern lost two district seats, reducing the overall number to seven, but managed to gain control of Bewdley Town Council, taking seven of the 13 available seats, a gain of three.http://www.ichcbewdley.co.uk County councillors Health Concern has four councillors at the county level: three on Worcestershire County Council, having recently won a seat in Kidderminster and regained a seat in Stourport, and one on Shropshire Council (for Cleobury Mortimer, a town just over the border) who sits as part of that council's Independents group.Shropshire Council Councillors by Party Grouping Organisation According to the Electoral Commission's register of parties, its leader is Dr Taylor, Peter Young is the nominating officer, Keith Robertson is treasurer, and Gerald Wheeler is campaigns officer. The party does have a formal membership. It had expenditure of about ¬£12,000 and income of about ¬£9,000 in the 2005 calendar year.

The film follows Lulu, a seductive, thoughtless young woman whose raw sexuality and uninhibited nature bring ruin to herself and those who love her. It is based on Frank Wedekind's plays Erdgeist (1895) and Die B√ºchse der Pandora (1904). Released in 1929, Pandora's Box was a critical failure, dismissed by German critics as a bastardization of its source material. Brooks' role in the film was also subject to criticism, fueled by the fact that Brooks was an American. In the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, the film was shown in significantly truncated and re-edited versions, which eliminated certain subplots, including the film's original, downbeat ending. By the mid-20th century, Pandora's Box was rediscovered by film scholars and began to earn a reputation as an unsung classic of Weimar German cinema. Plot Lulu is the mistress of a respected, middle-aged newspaper publisher, Dr. Ludwig Sch√∂n. One day, she is delighted when an old man, her \\"first patron\\", Schigolch, shows up at the door to her highly contemporary apartment. However, when Sch√∂n also arrives, she makes Schigolch hide on the balcony. Sch√∂n breaks the news to Lulu that he is going to marry Charlotte von Zarnikow, the daughter of the Minister of the Interior. Lulu tries to get him to change his mind, but when he discovers the disreputable-looking Schigolch, he leaves. Schigolch then introduces Lulu to Rodrigo Quast, who passed Sch√∂n on the stair. Quast wants her to join his new trapeze act. The next day, Lulu goes to see her best friend Alwa, who happens to be Sch√∂n's son. Sch√∂n is greatly displeased to see her, but comes up with the idea to have her star in his son's musical production to get her off his hands. However, Sch√∂n makes the mistake of bringing Charlotte to see the revue. When Lulu refuses to perform in front of her rival, Sch√∂n takes her into a storage room to try to persuade her otherwise, but she seduces him instead. Charlotte finds them embracing. A defeated Sch√∂n resigns himself to marrying Lulu. While the wedding reception is underway, he is disgusted to find Lulu playfully cavorting with Schigolch and Quast in the bedchamber. He gets his pistol and threatens to shoot the interlopers, but Lulu cries out not to, that Schigolch is her father. Schigolch and Quast thus escape. Once they are alone, Sch√∂n insists his new wife take the gun and shoot herself. When Lulu refuses, the gun goes off in the ensuing struggle, and Sch√∂n is killed. At her murder trial, Lulu is sentenced to five years for manslaughter. However, Schigolch and Quast trigger a fire alarm and spirit her away in the confusion. When Alwa finds her back in the Sch√∂n home, he confesses his feelings for her and they decide to flee the country. Countess Augusta Geschwitz, herself infatuated with Lulu, lets the fugitive use her passport. On the train, Lulu is recognized by another passenger, Marquis Casti-Piani. He offers to keep silent in return for money. He also suggests a hiding place, a ship used as an illegal gambling den. After several months however, Casti-Piani sells Lulu to an Egyptian for his brothel, and Quast blackmails Lulu for financing for his new act. Desperate for money to pay them off, Alwa cheats at cards, but is caught at it. Lulu turns to Schigolch for help. He has Geschwitz lure Quast to a stateroom, where she kills him. Schigolch, Lulu, and Alwa then flee. They end up living in squalor in a drafty London garret. On Christmas Eve, driven to prostitution, Lulu has the misfortune of picking a remorseful Jack the Ripper as her first client. Though he protests he has no money, she likes him and invites him to her lodging anyway. Schigolch drags Alwa away before they are seen. Jack is touched and secretly throws away his knife. Inside, however, he spots another knife on the table and cannot resist his urge to kill Lulu. Unaware of Lulu's fate, Alwa deserts her, joining a passing Salvation Army parade. CastThemes The film is notable for its lesbian subplot in the attraction of Countess Augusta Geschwitz (in some prints Anna) to Lulu. The character of Geschwitz is defined by her masculine look, as she wears a tuxedo. Roberts resisted the idea of playing a lesbian. The title is a reference to Pandora of Greek mythology, who upon opening a box given to her by the Olympian gods released all evils into the world, leaving only hope behind. In the film this connection is made explicitly by the prosecutor in the trial scene. Production=Development Pandora's Box had previously been adapted for the screen by Arz√©n von Cser√©py in 1921 in Germany under the same title, with Asta Nielsen in the role of Lulu. As there was a musical, plays and other cinema adaptations at the time, the story of Pandora's Box was well known. This allowed writer-director G. W. Pabst to take liberties with the story. Casting Pabst searched for months for an actress to play the lead character of Lulu. After seeing American actress Louise Brooks portray a circus performer in the 1928 Howard Hawks' film A Girl in Every Port, Pabst tried to get her on loan from Paramount Pictures. His offer was not made known to Brooks by the studio until she left Paramount over a salary dispute. Pabst's second choice was Marlene Dietrich; Dietrich was actually in Pabst's office, waiting to sign a contract to do the film, when Pabst got word of Brooks' availability. In an interview many years later, Brooks stated that Pabst was reluctant to hire Dietrich, as he felt she was too old at 27, and not a good fit for the character. Pabst himself later wrote that Dietrich was too knowing, while Brooks had both innocence and the ability to project sexuality, without coyness or premeditation. Filming In shooting the film, Pabst drew on Brooks' background as a dancer with the pioneering modern dance ensemble Denishawn, \\"choreographing\\" the movement in each scene and limiting her to a single emotion per shot. Pabst was deft in manipulating his actors: he hired tango musicians to inspire Brooks between takes, coached a reluctant Alice Roberts through the lesbian sequences, and appeased Fritz Kortner, who did not hide his dislike for Brooks. During the first week or two of filming, Brooks went out partying every night with her current lover, George Preston Marshall, much to Pabst's displeasure. When Marshall left, a relieved Pabst imposed a stricter lifestyle on his star. Tensions rose between the performers as well, with Fritz K√∂rtner refusing to speak to Brooks on the set. Per Brooks' own recollection, \\"K√∂rtner, like everybody else on the production, thought I had cast some blinding spell over Pabst that allowed me to walk through my part... K√∂rtner hated me. After each scene with me, he would pound off the set to his dressing room.\\" Despite these tensions, Brooks reflected that Pabst used the actors' personal animosities and dispositions toward one another to the benefit of the film's character dynamics, subtly urging them to sublimate their frustrations, and recalled his direction as masterful. Release=Reception and censorship Upon the film's release in Germany, Pabst was accused of making a \\"scandalous version\\" of Wedekind's plays, in which the Lulu character is presented as \\"a man-eater devouring her sexual victims.\\" Critics in Berlin particularly dismissed the film as a \\"travesty\\" of its source material. The film's presentation of the Countess as a lesbian was also controversial, and Brooks was castigated as a \\"non- actress.\\" According to film historians Derek Malcolm and J. Hoberman, the ire Brooks received for her performance was largely rooted in her being an American. The film underwent significant censorship in various counties: In France, the film was significantly re-edited from its original cut, making Alwa's secretary and the countess become Lulu's childhood friends, eliminating the lesbian subplot between the countess and Lulu; furthermore, in the French cut, Lulu is found not guilty at her trial, and there is no Jack the Ripper character, as the film ends with Lulu joining the Salvation Army. This cut was also released in the United Kingdom. Significantly truncated cuts of the film were screened in the United States, ranging various lengths, and concluding the same as the French and British cuts, with Lulu escaping to join the Salvation Army. =U.S. reviews= In the United States, the film screened in New York City beginning December 1, 1929, also in a truncated version. Film critic Irene Thirer of the New York Daily News noted that the film suffered greatly from the edits made to what \\"must have been ultra-sophisticated silent cinema in its original form.\\" On 8 December 1929, the widely read New York- based trade paper The Film Daily also published a review; that assessment, written by Jack Harrower, was based too on his viewing a heavily censored version of the film, a version identified to have a running time of only 66 minutes.Harrower, Jack (1929). \\"Louise Brooks in 'Pandora's Box' (Silent)\\", review, The Film Daily (New York, N.Y.), December 8, 1929, p. 8. Internet Archive, San Francisco. Retrieved July 15, 2019. Harrower describes what he saw as a \\"hodgepodge\\" that offers \\"little entertainment\\" due to the film being \\"hacked to pieces by the censors\\": Variety, the American entertainment industry's leading publication in 1929, characterizes Pandora's Box as incoherent or \\"rambling\\" in its December 11 review.\\"Waly\\" (1929). \\"Pandora's Box (German made)/(Silent)\\", Variety (New York, N.Y.), December 11, 1929, p. 39. Internet Archive. Retrieved July 15, 2019. That review, attributed to \\"Waly\\", was based on the film's presentation at the 55th Street Playhouse in Manhattan, which apparently screened a longer version of the motion picture than the one seen by Harrower. Variety's critic estimated the duration of the film he saw at 85 minutes; nevertheless, he also recognized the ruinous effects of extensive cuts to the film. \\"Management at this house [theater]\\", notes Waly, \\"blames the N.Y. censor with ending everything with Pandora and boy friends joining the Salvation Army.\\" The New York Times reviewed the film as well in December 1929. The newspaper's influential critic Mordaunt Hall also saw the picture at Manhattan's 55th Street Playhouse. Hall in his review judges it to be \\"a disconnected melodramatic effusion\\" that is \\"seldom interesting\\".Hall, Mordaunt (1929). \\"THE SCREEN; Paris in '70 and '71\\", review, The New York Times, December 2, 1929. NYT digital archives. Retrieved July 15, 2019. He notes that Brooks is \\"attractive\\" and \\"moves her head and eyes at the proper moment\\", but he adds that he finds her facial expressions in portraying various emotions on screen \\"often difficult to decide\\". Hall then concludes his remarks by indirectly complimenting the film's cinematography, asserting that the German production was \\"filmed far better than the story deserves\\". Rediscovery and restoration Though it was largely dismissed by critics upon initial release, Pandora's Box was rediscovered among film scholars in the 1950s, and began to accrue acclaim, eventually earning the reputation of being an unsung classic. Contemporarily, it is considered one of the classics of Weimar Germany's cinema, along with The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Metropolis, The Last Laugh, and The Blue Angel. Brooks' talent as an actress, which had been criticized upon the film's initial release (specifically by German critics), was also subject to international reappraisal and acclaim from the likes of European critics such as Lotte H. Eisner, Henri Langlois, and David Thomson. Film critic Roger Ebert reviewed the film in 1998 with great praise, and remarked of Brooks' presence that \\"she regards us from the screen as if the screen were not there; she casts away the artifice of film and invites us to play with her\\". He included the film on his list of The Great Movies. , the film has a 92% approval rating on internet review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 36 reviews, with a weighted average of 8.82/10. In 2009, Hugh Hefner funded a restoration of the film. This restoration was screened at the 2012 San Francisco Silent Film Festival. In their program, the festival noted: \\"As a heavily censored film that deals with the psychological effects of sexual repression, Pandora‚Äôs Box meets two of Hefner‚Äôs charitable objectives: artistic expression and a pristine new film, both finally unfurled after decades of frustration.\\" Quentin Tarantino listed the movie among his 10 greatest films of all time. Home media In the United Kingdom, Pandora's Box was released on DVD on 24 June 2002, by Second Sight Films. In North America, Pandora's Box was released on a two-disc DVD set on 28 November 2006, by The Criterion Collection. Four soundtracks were commissioned for the film's DVD release: an approximation of the score cinema audiences might have heard with a live orchestra, a Weimar Republic-era cabaret score, a modern orchestral interpretation, and an improvisational piano score.

Solid modeling (or modelling) is a consistent set of principles for mathematical and computer modeling of three-dimensional solids. Solid modeling is distinguished from related areas of geometric modeling and computer graphics by its emphasis on physical fidelity. Together, the principles of geometric and solid modeling form the foundation of 3D-computer- aided design and in general support the creation, exchange, visualization, animation, interrogation, and annotation of digital models of physical objects.  Overview  The use of solid modeling techniques allows for the automation of several difficult engineering calculations that are carried out as a part of the design process. Simulation, planning, and verification of processes such as machining and assembly were one of the main catalysts for the development of solid modeling. More recently, the range of supported manufacturing applications has been greatly expanded to include sheet metal manufacturing, injection molding, welding, pipe routing, etc. Beyond traditional manufacturing, solid modeling techniques serve as the foundation for rapid prototyping, digital data archival and reverse engineering by reconstructing solids from sampled points on physical objects, mechanical analysis using finite elements, motion planning and NC path verification, kinematic and dynamic analysis of mechanisms, and so on. A central problem in all these applications is the ability to effectively represent and manipulate three-dimensional geometry in a fashion that is consistent with the physical behavior of real artifacts. Solid modeling research and development has effectively addressed many of these issues, and continues to be a central focus of computer-aided engineering.  Mathematical foundations  The notion of solid modeling as practised today relies on the specific need for informational completeness in mechanical geometric modeling systems, in the sense that any computer model should support all geometric queries that may be asked of its corresponding physical object. The requirement implicitly recognizes the possibility of several computer representations of the same physical object as long as any two such representations are consistent. It is impossible to computationally verify informational completeness of a representation unless the notion of a physical object is defined in terms of computable mathematical properties and independent of any particular representation. Such reasoning led to the development of the modeling paradigm that has shaped the field of solid modeling as we know it today. All manufactured components have finite size and well behaved boundaries, so initially the focus was on mathematically modeling rigid parts made of homogeneous isotropic material that could be added or removed. These postulated properties can be translated into properties of subsets of three- dimensional Euclidean space. The two common approaches to define solidity rely on point-set topology and algebraic topology respectively. Both models specify how solids can be built from simple pieces or cells. Regularization of a 2-d set by taking the closure of its interior According to the continuum point-set model of solidity, all the points of any X ‚äÇ ‚Ñù3 can be classified according to their neighborhoods with respect to X as interior, exterior, or boundary points. Assuming ‚Ñù3 is endowed with the typical Euclidean metric, a neighborhood of a point p ‚ààX takes the form of an open ball. For X to be considered solid, every neighborhood of any p ‚ààX must be consistently three dimensional; points with lower-dimensional neighborhoods indicate a lack of solidity. Dimensional homogeneity of neighborhoods is guaranteed for the class of closed regular sets, defined as sets equal to the closure of their interior. Any X ‚äÇ ‚Ñù3 can be turned into a closed regular set or regularized by taking the closure of its interior, and thus the modeling space of solids is mathematically defined to be the space of closed regular subsets of ‚Ñù3 (by the Heine-Borel theorem it is implied that all solids are compact sets). In addition, solids are required to be closed under the Boolean operations of set union, intersection, and difference (to guarantee solidity after material addition and removal). Applying the standard Boolean operations to closed regular sets may not produce a closed regular set, but this problem can be solved by regularizing the result of applying the standard Boolean operations. The regularized set operations are denoted ‚à™‚àó, ‚à©‚àó, and ‚àí‚àó. The combinatorial characterization of a set X ‚äÇ ‚Ñù3 as a solid involves representing X as an orientable cell complex so that the cells provide finite spatial addresses for points in an otherwise innumerable continuum. The class of semi-analytic bounded subsets of Euclidean space is closed under Boolean operations (standard and regularized) and exhibits the additional property that every semi-analytic set can be stratified into a collection of disjoint cells of dimensions 0,1,2,3. A triangulation of a semi-analytic set into a collection of points, line segments, triangular faces, and tetrahedral elements is an example of a stratification that is commonly used. The combinatorial model of solidity is then summarized by saying that in addition to being semi-analytic bounded subsets, solids are three-dimensional topological polyhedra, specifically three-dimensional orientable manifolds with boundary. In particular this implies the Euler characteristic of the combinatorial boundary of the polyhedron is 2. The combinatorial manifold model of solidity also guarantees the boundary of a solid separates space into exactly two components as a consequence of the Jordan-Brouwer theorem, thus eliminating sets with non-manifold neighborhoods that are deemed impossible to manufacture. The point-set and combinatorial models of solids are entirely consistent with each other, can be used interchangeably, relying on continuum or combinatorial properties as needed, and can be extended to n dimensions. The key property that facilitates this consistency is that the class of closed regular subsets of ‚Ñùn coincides precisely with homogeneously n-dimensional topological polyhedra. Therefore, every n-dimensional solid may be unambiguously represented by its boundary and the boundary has the combinatorial structure of an n‚àí1-dimensional polyhedron having homogeneously n‚àí1-dimensional neighborhoods. Solid representation schemes Based on assumed mathematical properties, any scheme of representing solids is a method for capturing information about the class of semi-analytic subsets of Euclidean space. This means all representations are different ways of organizing the same geometric and topological data in the form of a data structure. All representation schemes are organized in terms of a finite number of operations on a set of primitives. Therefore, the modeling space of any particular representation is finite, and any single representation scheme may not completely suffice to represent all types of solids. For example, solids defined via combinations of regularized boolean operations cannot necessarily be represented as the sweep of a primitive moving according to a space trajectory, except in very simple cases. This forces modern geometric modeling systems to maintain several representation schemes of solids and also facilitate efficient conversion between representation schemes. Below is a list of common techniques used to create or represent solid models. Modern modeling software may use a combination of these schemes to represent a solid.  Primitive instancing This scheme is based on notion of families of object, each member of a family distinguishable from the other by a few parameters. Each object family is called a generic primitive, and individual objects within a family are called primitive instances. For example, a family of bolts is a generic primitive, and a single bolt specified by a particular set of parameters is a primitive instance. The distinguishing characteristic of pure parameterized instancing schemes is the lack of means for combining instances to create new structures which represent new and more complex objects. The other main drawback of this scheme is the difficulty of writing algorithms for computing properties of represented solids. A considerable amount of family-specific information must be built into the algorithms and therefore each generic primitive must be treated as a special case, allowing no uniform overall treatment. Spatial occupancy enumeration This scheme is essentially a list of spatial cells occupied by the solid. The cells, also called voxels are cubes of a fixed size and are arranged in a fixed spatial grid (other polyhedral arrangements are also possible but cubes are the simplest). Each cell may be represented by the coordinates of a single point, such as the cell's centroid. Usually a specific scanning order is imposed and the corresponding ordered set of coordinates is called a spatial array. Spatial arrays are unambiguous and unique solid representations but are too verbose for use as 'master' or definitional representations. They can, however, represent coarse approximations of parts and can be used to improve the performance of geometric algorithms, especially when used in conjunction with other representations such as constructive solid geometry. Cell decomposition This scheme follows from the combinatoric (algebraic topological) descriptions of solids detailed above. A solid can be represented by its decomposition into several cells. Spatial occupancy enumeration schemes are a particular case of cell decompositions where all the cells are cubical and lie in a regular grid. Cell decompositions provide convenient ways for computing certain topological properties of solids such as its connectedness (number of pieces) and genus (number of holes). Cell decompositions in the form of triangulations are the representations used in 3d finite elements for the numerical solution of partial differential equations. Other cell decompositions such as a Whitney regular stratification or Morse decompositions may be used for applications in robot motion planning. Boundary representation In this scheme a solid is represented by the cellular decomposition of its boundary. Since the boundaries of solids have the distinguishing property that they separate space into regions defined by the interior of the solid and the complementary exterior according to the Jordan-Brouwer theorem discussed above, every point in space can unambiguously be tested against the solid by testing the point against the boundary of the solid. Recall that ability to test every point in the solid provides a guarantee of solidity. Using ray casting it is possible to count the number of intersections of a cast ray against the boundary of the solid. Even number of intersections correspond to exterior points, and odd number of intersections correspond to interior points. The assumption of boundaries as manifold cell complexes forces any boundary representation to obey disjointedness of distinct primitives, i.e. there are no self-intersections that cause non- manifold points. In particular, the manifoldness condition implies all pairs of vertices are disjoint, pairs of edges are either disjoint or intersect at one vertex, and pairs of faces are disjoint or intersect at a common edge. Several data structures that are combinatorial maps have been developed to store boundary representations of solids. In addition to planar faces, modern systems provide the ability to store quadrics and NURBS surfaces as a part of the boundary representation. Boundary representations have evolved into a ubiquitous representation scheme of solids in most commercial geometric modelers because of their flexibility in representing solids exhibiting a high level of geometric complexity. Surface mesh modeling Similar to boundary representation, the surface of the object is represented. However, rather than complex data structures and NURBS, a simple surface mesh of vertices and edges is used. Surface meshes can be structured (as in triangular meshes in STL files or quad meshes with horizontal and vertical rings of quadrilaterals), or unstructured meshes with randomly grouped triangles and higher level polygons. Constructive solid geometry Constructive solid geometry (CSG) is a family of schemes for representing rigid solids as Boolean constructions or combinations of primitives via the regularized set operations discussed above. CSG and boundary representations are currently the most important representation schemes for solids. CSG representations take the form of ordered binary trees where non-terminal nodes represent either rigid transformations (orientation preserving isometries) or regularized set operations. Terminal nodes are primitive leaves that represent closed regular sets. The semantics of CSG representations is clear. Each subtree represents a set resulting from applying the indicated transformations/regularized set operations on the set represented by the primitive leaves of the subtree. CSG representations are particularly useful for capturing design intent in the form of features corresponding to material addition or removal (bosses, holes, pockets etc.). The attractive properties of CSG include conciseness, guaranteed validity of solids, computationally convenient Boolean algebraic properties, and natural control of a solid's shape in terms of high level parameters defining the solid's primitives and their positions and orientations. The relatively simple data structure and elegant recursive algorithms have further contributed to the popularity of CSG. Sweeping The basic notion embodied in sweeping schemes is simple. A set moving through space may trace or sweep out volume (a solid) that may be represented by the moving set and its trajectory. Such a representation is important in the context of applications such as detecting the material removed from a cutter as it moves along a specified trajectory, computing dynamic interference of two solids undergoing relative motion, motion planning, and even in computer graphics applications such as tracing the motions of a brush moved on a canvas. Most commercial CAD systems provide (limited) functionality for constructing swept solids mostly in the form of a two dimensional cross section moving on a space trajectory transversal to the section. However, current research has shown several approximations of three dimensional shapes moving across one parameter, and even multi-parameter motions. Implicit representation A very general method of defining a set of points X is to specify a predicate that can be evaluated at any point in space. In other words, X is defined implicitly to consist of all the points that satisfy the condition specified by the predicate. The simplest form of a predicate is the condition on the sign of a real valued function resulting in the familiar representation of sets by equalities and inequalities. For example, if f= ax + by + cz + d the conditions f(p) =0, f(p) > 0, and f(p) < 0 represent, respectively, a plane and two open linear halfspaces. More complex functional primitives may be defined by boolean combinations of simpler predicates. Furthermore, the theory of R-functions allow conversions of such representations into a single function inequality for any closed semi analytic set. Such a representation can be converted to a boundary representation using polygonization algorithms, for example, the marching cubes algorithm. Parametric and feature-based modeling Features are defined to be parametric shapes associated with attributes such as intrinsic geometric parameters (length, width, depth etc.), position and orientation, geometric tolerances, material properties, and references to other features. Features also provide access to related production processes and resource models. Thus, features have a semantically higher level than primitive closed regular sets. Features are generally expected to form a basis for linking CAD with downstream manufacturing applications, and also for organizing databases for design data reuse. Parametric feature based modeling is frequently combined with constructive binary solid geometry (CSG) to fully describe systems of complex objects in engineering.  History of solid modelers  The historical development of solid modelers has to be seen in context of the whole history of CAD, the key milestones being the development of the research system BUILD followed by its commercial spin-off Romulus which went on to influence the development of Parasolid, ACIS and Solid Modeling Solutions. One of the first CAD developers in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), ASCON began internal development of its own solid modeler in the 1990s. In November 2012, the mathematical division of ASCON became a separate company, and was named C3D Labs. It was assigned the task of developing the C3D geometric modeling kernel as a standalone product ‚Äì the only commercial 3D modeling kernel from Russia. Other contributions came from M√§ntyl√§, with his GWB and from the GPM project which contributed, among other things, hybrid modeling techniques at the beginning of the 1980s. This is also when the Programming Language of Solid Modeling PLaSM was conceived at the University of Rome.  Computer- aided design  The modeling of solids is only the minimum requirement of a CAD system's capabilities. Solid modelers have become commonplace in engineering departments in the last ten years due to faster computers and competitive software pricing. Solid modeling software creates a virtual 3D representation of components for machine design and analysis. A typical graphical user interface includes programmable macros, keyboard shortcuts and dynamic model manipulation. The ability to dynamically re-orient the model, in real-time shaded 3-D, is emphasized and helps the designer maintain a mental 3-D image. A solid part model generally consists of a group of features, added one at a time, until the model is complete. Engineering solid models are built mostly with sketcher-based features; 2-D sketches that are swept along a path to become 3-D. These may be cuts, or extrusions for example. Design work on components is usually done within the context of the whole product using assembly modeling methods. An assembly model incorporates references to individual part models that comprise the product. Another type of modeling technique is 'surfacing' (Freeform surface modeling). Here, surfaces are defined, trimmed and merged, and filled to make solid. The surfaces are usually defined with datum curves in space and a variety of complex commands. Surfacing is more difficult, but better applicable to some manufacturing techniques, like injection molding. Solid models for injection molded parts usually have both surfacing and sketcher based features. Engineering drawings can be created semi-automatically and reference the solid models. Parametric modeling Parametric modeling uses parameters to define a model (dimensions, for example). Examples of parameters are: dimensions used to create model features, material density, formulas to describe swept features, imported data (that describe a reference surface, for example). The parameter may be modified later, and the model will update to reflect the modification. Typically, there is a relationship between parts, assemblies, and drawings. A part consists of multiple features, and an assembly consists of multiple parts. Drawings can be made from either parts or assemblies. Example: A shaft is created by extruding a circle 100 mm. A hub is assembled to the end of the shaft. Later, the shaft is modified to be 200 mm long (click on the shaft, select the length dimension, modify to 200). When the model is updated the shaft will be 200 mm long, the hub will relocate to the end of the shaft to which it was assembled, and the engineering drawings and mass properties will reflect all changes automatically. Related to parameters, but slightly different, are constraints. Constraints are relationships between entities that make up a particular shape. For a window, the sides might be defined as being parallel, and of the same length. Parametric modeling is obvious and intuitive. But for the first three decades of CAD this was not the case. Modification meant re-draw, or add a new cut or protrusion on top of old ones. Dimensions on engineering drawings were created, instead of shown. Parametric modeling is very powerful, but requires more skill in model creation. A complicated model for an injection molded part may have a thousand features, and modifying an early feature may cause later features to fail. Skillfully created parametric models are easier to maintain and modify. Parametric modeling also lends itself to data re-use. A whole family of capscrews can be contained in one model, for example.  Medical solid modeling  Modern computed axial tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scanners can be used to create solid models of internal body features, so- called volume rendering. Optical 3D scanners can be used to create point clouds or polygon mesh models of external body features. Uses of medical solid modeling; * Visualization * Visualization of specific body tissues (just blood vessels and tumor, for example) * Designing prosthetics, orthotics, and other medical and dental devices (this is sometimes called mass customization) * Creating polygon mesh models for rapid prototyping (to aid surgeons preparing for difficult surgeries, for example) * Combining polygon mesh models with CAD solid modeling (design of hip replacement parts, for example) * Computational analysis of complex biological processes, e.g. air flow, blood flow * Computational simulation of new medical devices and implants in vivo If the use goes beyond visualization of the scan data, processes like image segmentation and image-based meshing will be necessary to generate an accurate and realistic geometrical description of the scan data. Engineering Cobalt  Mass properties window of a model in Cobalt Because CAD programs running on computers \\"understand\\" the true geometry comprising complex shapes, many attributes of/for a 3D solid, such as its center of gravity, volume, and mass, can be quickly calculated. For instance, the cube with rounded edges shown at the top of this article measures 8.4 mm from flat to flat. Despite its many radii and the shallow pyramid on each of its six faces, its properties are readily calculated for the designer, as shown in the screenshot at right.

The islands are administratively part of Krabi Province. Ko Phi Phi Don (; ) (ko 'island') is the largest and most populated island of the group, although the beaches of the second largest island, Ko Phi Phi Le (; ) are visited by many people as well. The rest of the islands in the group, including Bida Nok, Bida Nai, and Bamboo Island (Ko Mai Phai), are not much more than large limestone rocks jutting out of the sea. The islands are reachable by speedboats or long-tail boats most often from Krabi town or from piers in Phuket Province. Phi Phi Don was initially populated by Muslim fishermen during the late-1940s, and later became a coconut plantation. The resident Thai population of Phi Phi Don remains more than 80 percent Muslim. The current population however‚Äîif counting transient workers‚Äîis more Buddhist than Muslim. The resident population is between 2,000 and 3,000 people (2013). The islands came to worldwide prominence when Ko Phi Phi Le was used as a location for the 2000 British-American film The Beach. This attracted criticism, with claims that the film company had damaged the island's environment - the producers supposedly bulldozed beach areas and planted palm trees to make it better resemble descriptions in the book, an accusation the film's makers contest. An increase in tourism was attributed to the film's release, which resulted in increased environmental degradation. Phi Phi Le is home to the \\"Viking Cave\\", where there is a thriving industry harvesting edible bird's nests. Ko Phi Phi was devastated by the Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004, when nearly all of the island's infrastructure was destroyed.  History  Gypsy boat, Ko Phi Phi From archaeological discoveries, it is believed that the area was one of the oldest communities in Thailand, dating back to the prehistoric period. It is believed that this province may have taken its name from Krabi, which means 'sword'. This may come from a legend that an ancient sword was unearthed prior to the city's founding. The name Phi Phi (pronounced \\"phi-phi\\") originates from Malay. The original name for the islands was Pulau Api-Api ('the fiery isle'). The name refers to the Pokok Api-Api, or \\"fiery tree\\" (grey mangrove) which is found on the islands.  Geography  There are six islands in the group known as Phi Phi. They lie southeast of Phuket and are part of Hat Nopparat Thara-Ko Phi Phi National Park. The national park covers an area of 242,437 rai (38,790 ha). which is home to an abundance of corals and marine life. There are limestone mountains with cliffs, caves, and long white sandy beaches. Phi Phi Don and Phi Phi Le are the largest and best-known islands. Phi Phi Don is : in length and wide. Phi Phi Le is . In total, the islands occupy .  Administration  Phi Phi Islands There are two administrative villages on Ko Phi Phi under the administration of the Ao Nang sub-district, Mueang Krabi District, Krabi Province. There are nine settlements under these two villages. The villages are: *Laem Thong (‡∏ö‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡πÅ‡∏´‡∏•‡∏°‡∏ï‡∏á, Mu 8, between 300-500 people) :* Ban Ko Mai Phai (about 20 fishermen live on this island) :* Ban Laem Tong :* Ao Loh Bakhao :* Ao Lana *Ko Phi Phi (‡∏ö‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏∞‡∏û‡∏µ‡∏û‡∏µ, Mu 7, between 1,500 - 2,000 people) :* Ao Maya (about 10 people, mostly in the ranger station) :* Ton Sai, the capital and largest settlement :* Hat Yao :* Ao Lodalum :* Laem Pho  Climate  Hat Noppharat Thara - Mu Ko Phi Phi National Park is influenced by tropical monsoon winds. There are two seasons: the rainy season from May till December and the hot season from January till April. Average temperature ranges between . Average rainfall per year is about , with wettest month being July and the driest February.  Transportation and communication ;Roads Since the re- building of Ko Phi Phi after the 2004 tsunami, paved roads now cover the vast majority of Ton Sai Bay and Loh Dalum Bay. All roads are for pedestrian use only with push carts used to transport goods and bags. The only permitted motor vehicles are reserved for emergency services. Bicycling is the most popular form of transport in Ton Sai. ;Air The nearest airports are at Krabi, Trang, and Phuket. All three have direct road and boat connections. ;Ferry There are frequent ferry boats to Ko Phi Phi from Phuket, Ko Lanta, and Krabi town starting at 08:30. Last boats from Krabi and Phuket depart at 14:30. In the \\"green season\\" (Jun-Oct), travel to and from Ko Lanta is via Krabi town only. There is a large modern deep water government pier on Tonsai Bay, Phi Phi Don Village, completed in late-2009. It takes in the main ferry boats from Phuket, Krabi, and Ko Lanta. Visitors to Phi Phi Island must pay 20 baht on arrival at the pier. Dive boats, longtail boats, and supply boats have their own drop off points along the piers, making the pier highly efficient in the peak season.  Tourism  Sunset, Ko Phi Phi Phi Phi party The islands feature beaches and clear water, and the natural environment is protected by national park status. Tourism on the islands exploded since the release of the movie The Beach. Phi Phi Le's Maya Bay was closed to tourists from June 2018 until the ecosystem recovers, but at least a year.  Medical There is a small hospital on Phi Phi Island for emergencies. Its main purpose is to stabilize emergencies and evacuate to a Phuket hospital. It is between the Phi Phi Cabana Hotel and the Ton Sai Towers, about a 5‚Äì7 minute walk from the main pier. 2004 tsunami On 26 December 2004, much of the inhabited part of Phi Phi Don was devastated by the Indian Ocean tsunami. The island's main village, Ton Sai (Banyan Tree, ), is built on a sandy isthmus between the island's two long, tall limestone ridges. On both sides of Ton Sai are semicircular bays lined with beaches. The isthmus rises less than above sea level. Shortly after 10:00 on 26 December, the water from both bays receded. When the tsunami hit, at 10:37, it did so from both bays, and met in the middle of the isthmus. The wave that came into Ton Sai Bay was high. The wave that came into Loh Dalum Bay was high. The force of the larger wave from Loh Dalum Bay pushed the tsunami and also breached low-lying areas in the limestone karsts, passing from Laa Naa Bay to Bakhao Bay, and at Laem Thong (Sea Gypsy Village), where 11 people died. Apart from these breaches, the east side of the island experienced only flooding and strong currents. A tsunami memorial was built to honor the deceased but has since been removed for the building of a new hotel in 2015. At the time of the tsunami, the island had an estimated 10,000 occupants, including tourists. Post-tsunami reconstruction Ko Phi Phi Don, March 2005 in the aftermath of the tsunami. After the tsunami, approximately 70% of the buildings on the island had been destroyed. By the end of July 2005, an estimated 850 bodies had been recovered, and an estimated 1,200 people were still missing. The total number of fatalities is unlikely to be known. Local tour guides cite the figure 4,000. Of Phi Phi Don residents, 104 surviving children had lost one or both parents. In the immediate aftermath of the disaster, the permanent residents were housed in a refugee camp at Nong Kok in Krabi Province. On 6 January 2005, a former Dutch resident of Phi Phi, Emiel Kok, set up a voluntary organization, Help International Phi Phi (\\"HI Phi Phi\\"). HI Phi Phi recruited 68 Thai staff from the refugee camp, as well as transient backpacker volunteers (of whom more than 3,500 offered their assistance), and returned to the island to undertake clearing and rebuilding work. On 18 February 2005, a second organization, Phi Phi Dive Camp, was set up to remove the debris from the bays and coral reef, most of which was in Ton Sai Bay. By the end of July 2005, 23,000 tonnes of debris had been removed from the island, of which 7,000 tonnes had been cleared by hand. \\"We try and do as much as possible by hand,\\" said Kok, \\"that way we can search for passports and identification.\\" The majority of buildings that were deemed fit for repair by government surveyors had been repaired, and 300 businesses had been restored. HI Phi Phi was nominated for a Time Magazine Heroes of Asia award. As of 6 December 2005, nearly 1,500 hotel rooms were open, and a tsunami early-warning alarm system had been installed by the Thai government with the help of volunteers. Impact of mass tourism Bryde's whale swims off the islands Since the tsunami, Phi Phi has come under greater threat from mass tourism. Dr Thon Thamrongnawasawat, an environmental activist and member of Thailand's National Reform Council, is campaigning to have Phi Phi tourist numbers capped before its natural beauty is completely destroyed. With southern Thailand attracting thousands more tourists every day, Dr Thon makes the point that the ecosystem is under threat and is fast disappearing. \\"Economically, a few people may be enriched, but their selfishness will come at great cost to Thailand\\", says Dr Thon, a marine biology lecturer at Kasetsart University and an established environmental writer. More than one thousand tourists arrive on Phi Phi daily. This figure does not include those who arrive by chartered speedboat or yacht. Phi Phi produces about of solid waste a day, rising to during the high season and most of this waste leaves Phi Phi island into the ocean - untreated; in fact, Phi Phi Island releases 83% wastewater untreated. All tourists arriving on the island pay a 20-baht fee at Ton Sai Pier to assist in \\"keeping Ko Phi Phi clean\\". \\"We collect up to 20,000 baht a day from tourists at the pier. The money is then used to pay a private company to haul the rubbish from the island to the mainland in Krabi to be disposed of\\", Mr Pankum Kittithonkun, Ao Nang Administration Organization (OrBorTor) President, said. The boat takes about 25 tonnes of trash from the island daily, weather permitting. Ao Nang OrBorTor pays 600,000 baht per month for the service. During high season, an Ao Nang OrBorTor boat is used to help transport the overflow of rubbish. Further aggravating Phi Phi's waste issues is sewage. \\"We have no wastewater management plant there. Our only hope is that hotels, restaurants and other businesses act responsibly ‚Äì but I have no faith in them,\\" Mr Pankum said. \\"They of course have to treat their own wastewater before releasing it into the sea, but they very well could just be turning the devices on before officers arrive to check them.\\" The fundamental issue is that the budget allocated for Ao Nang and Phi Phi is based on its registered population, not on the number of people it hosts every year, Mr Pankum said. In June 2018, Maya Beach, made famous by Leonardo DiCaprio's 2000 film The Beach, was closed indefinitely to allow it to recover. The beach used to receive up to 5,000 tourists and 200 boats a day.

W. Pabst. The French-German co- production drama is noted for combining expressionism and realism.Butler, Craig \\"Review\\" on Allmovie.com. Quote: \\"Pabst brings a sense of realism to the proceedings, aided enormously by Robert Baberske and Fritz Arno Wagner's cinematography, which manages to be both starkly naturalistic and emotionally subjective at the same time.\\" The picture concerns a mine disaster where German miners rescue French miners from an underground fire and explosion. The story takes place in the Lorraine‚ÄìSaar regions, along the border between France and Germany. It is based on one of the worst industrial accidents in history, the Courri√®res mine disaster in 1906 in Courri√®res, France, where rescue efforts after a coal dust explosion were hampered by the lack of trained mine rescuers. Expert teams from Paris and miners from the Westphalia region of Germany came to the assistance of the French miners. There were 1,099 fatalities, including children.Steffen, James \\"Kameradschaft\\" (article) on TCM.com. Last accessed: December 11, 2007. Kameradschaft in German means a bond between soldiers or those who have similar opinions and are in friendship. The word is similar to comradeship, camaraderie or fellowship.Google translate Plot Two boys, one French and the other German, are playing marbles near the border. When the game is over, both boys claim to have won, and complain that the other is trying to steal their marbles. Their fathers, border guards, come and separate the boys. In 1919, at the end of World War I the border changes, and an underground mine is divided, with a gate dividing the two sections. An economic downturn and rising unemployment adds to tension, as German workers seek employment in France but are turned away, since there are hardly enough jobs for French workers. In the French part of the mine fires break out, which they try to contain by building brick walls, with the bricklayers wearing breathing apparatus. The Germans continue to work in their section, but start to feel the heat from the French fires. Three German miners visit a French dance hall and one almost provokes a fight when Francoise, a young French woman, refuses to dance with him. The rejected miner thinks it is because he's German, but it is actually because she is tired. She and her boyfriend, Emile, a miner, leave, and she expresses her distress over the stories about fires and explosions in the mine. The next morning, he stops in to say goodbye to her before she leaves for Paris, then he and her brother, Jean, another miner, leave for work. The fire gets out of control, igniting gas and causing roof collapses that traps many French miners. In response, the German miner, Wittkopp, appeals successfully to his bosses to send a rescue team. As the German rescue team leave in two lorries, its leader explains to his wife that the French are men with women and children and he would hope that they would come to his aid in similar circumstances. In the mine itself, a trio of German miners breaks through the grille on the border between the two countries. On the French side, an old retired miner sneaks into the shaft hoping to rescue his young grandson. The Germans rescue the French miners, not without difficulties. After all the survivors are rescued, there is a big party with speeches about friendship between the French and Germans. French and German officials then reinstall the underground border grille and things return to the way they were before.

As with his previous film, Westfront 1918, his first talkie, Pabst did not utilize the soundproof booths which Hollywood studios used to mask the sound of the camera from the microphone, instead employing a sound proof case called a \\"blimp\\", which gave the freedom to move the camera around. Critical response Film critic Daniel Curran calls the film \\"A heartfelt plea for peace and internationalism.\\" While calling the narrative over-sentimental, Curran wrote, \\"Pabst's plea for a peaceful future is both noble and honest, his direction of the heartbreak and devastation [is] enhanced by the brilliant cinematography by Fritz Arno Wagner and Robert Baberske, and the frighteningly real set design by Erno Metzner and Karl Vollbrecht.\\"Curran, Daniel (ed.) Foreign Films. Evanston, Illinois: Cinebooks, 1989 . p.85 When the film was released in the United States in 1932, Mordaunt Hall, film critic for The New York Times, praised the realism and the screenplay, writing \\"[Kameradschaft is] one of the finest examples of realism that has come to the screen ... [the] scenes in the mine are so real that one never thinks of them as being staged ...

Variety also gave the film a positive review, praising the direction, story, and cinematography, writing that \\"Pabst has made [the film] a powerful recounting and accentuates more the happenings than the men ...

A number of its serovars are serious human pathogens.  Epidemiology  Most cases of salmonellosis are caused by food infected with S. enterica, which often infects cattle and poultry, though other animals such as domestic catsFood Poisoning News and hamsters have also been shown to be sources of infection in humans. Investigations of vacuum cleaner bags have shown that households can act as a reservoir of the bacterium; this is more likely if the household has contact with an infection source (i.e., members working with cattle or in a veterinary clinic). Raw chicken eggs and goose eggs can harbor S. enterica, initially in the egg whites, although most eggs are not infected. As the egg ages at room temperature, the yolk membrane begins to break down and S. enterica can spread into the yolk. Refrigeration and freezing do not kill all the bacteria, but substantially slow or halt their growth. Pasteurizing and food irradiation are used to kill Salmonella for commercially produced foodstuffs containing raw eggs such as ice cream. Foods prepared in the home from raw eggs, such as mayonnaise, cakes, and cookies, can spread salmonellae if not properly cooked before consumption. S. enterica genomes have been reconstructed from up 6,500 year old human remains across Western Eurasia, which provides evidence for geographic widespread infections with systemic S. enterica during prehistory, and a possible role of the Neolithization process in the evolution of host adaptation. Additional reconstructed genomes from colonial Mexico suggest S. enterica as the cause of cocoliztli, an epidemic in 16th-century New Spain.  Pathogenesis  Secreted proteins are of major importance for the pathogenesis of infectious diseases caused by S. enterica. A remarkably large number of fimbrial and nonfimbrial adhesins are present in Salmonella, and mediate biofilm formation and contact to host cells. Secreted proteins are also involved in host-cell invasion and intracellular proliferation, two hallmarks of Salmonella pathogenesis.  Small noncoding RNA  Small nonprotein-coding RNAs (sRNA) are able to perform specific functions without being translated into proteins; 97 bacterial sRNAs from Salmonella Typhi were discovered. AsdA (antisense RNA of dnaA) is a cis- encoded antisense RNA of dnaA described in S. enterica serovar Typhi. It was discovered by deep sequencing and its transcription was confirmed by Northern blot and RACE analysis. AsdA is estimated to be about 540 nucleotides long, and represents the complementary strand to that encoding DnaA, a protein that plays a central role in the initiation of DNA replication and hence cellular division. In rich media, it is highly expressed only after reaching the stationary growth phase, but under limiting iron or osmotic stress, it is already expressed during exponential growth. Overexpression of AsdA stabilizes dnaA mRNA, increasing its levels and thereby enhancing its rate of translation. This suggests that AsdA is a regulator of DNA replication. Nomenclature S. enterica has six subspecies, and each subspecies has associated serovars that differ by antigenic specificity. S. enterica has over 2500 serovars. Salmonella bongori was previously considered a subspecies of S. enterica, but it is now the other species in the genus Salmonella. Most of the human pathogenic Salmonella serovars belong to the enterica subspecies. These serogroups include S. Typhi, S. Enteritidis, S. Paratyphi, S. Typhimurium, and S. Choleraesuis. The serovars can be designated as written in the previous sentence (capitalized and nonitalicized following the genus), or as follows: \\"S. enterica subsp. enterica, serovar Typhi\\".

He is flanked by commission co-chairs Senator Charles Robb (left) and Judge Laurence Silberman (right).The Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction is a panel created by Executive Order 13328, signed by U.S. President George W. Bush in February 2004. Alt URL The impetus for the Commission lay with a public controversy occasioned by statements, including those of Chief of the Iraq Survey Group, David Kay, that the Intelligence Community had grossly erred in judging that Iraq had been developing weapons of mass destruction (WMD) before the March 2003 start of Operation Iraqi Freedom. President Bush therefore formed the Commission, but gave it a broad mandate not only to look into any errors behind the Iraq intelligence, but also to look into intelligence on WMD programs in Afghanistan and Libya, as well as to examine the capabilities of the Intelligence Community to address the problem of WMD proliferation and \\"related threats.\\" However, the commission was not directed to examine the extent to which the Bush administration may have manipulated the intelligence. Following intense study of the American Intelligence Community, the Commission delivered its report to the President on March 31, 2005, the so-called Robb- Silberman Report. Findings Regarding Iraq, the Commission concluded that the United States Intelligence Community was wrong in almost all of its pre- war judgments about Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction and that this constituted a major intelligence failure. The Commission's report also described systemic analytical, collection, and dissemination flaws that led the intelligence community to erroneous assessments about Iraq's alleged WMD programs. Chief among these flaws were \\"an analytical process that was driven by assumptions and inferences rather than data\\", failures by certain agencies to gather all relevant information and analyze fully information on purported centrifuge tubes, insufficient vetting of key sources, particularly the source \\"Curveball,\\" and somewhat overheated presentation of data to policymakers. The 601-page document detailed many U.S. intelligence failures and identified intelligence breakdowns in dozens of cases. Some of the conclusions reached by the report were: *the report notes in several places that the commission's mandate did not allow it \\"to investigate how policymakers used the intelligence they received from the Intelligence Community on Iraq's weapons programs,\\" *One of the main and crucial intelligence sources for the case in Iraq was an informant named Curveball. Curveball had never been interviewed by American intelligence until after the war and was instead handled exclusively by German intelligence agents, who regarded his statements as unconvincing. An October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate that concluded Iraq \\"has\\" biological weapons was \\"based almost exclusively on information obtained\\" from Curveball, according to the report. *Information about aluminum tubes to be used as centrifuges in a nuclear weapons program were found by the commission to be used for conventional rockets. *The Niger Yellowcake scandal was due to American intelligence believing \\"transparently forged documents\\" purporting to show a contract between the countries.

Vest, former President of MIT * Henry S. Rowen, former Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, Chairman of the National Intelligence Council, and President of RAND. The first seven members of the panel were appointed on February 6, 2004, the date of the executive order which created it. The final two members, Vest and Rowen, were appointed on February 13. Vice Admiral John_Scott_Redd served as the Executive Director for the Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction sometimes called the Iraq Intelligence Commission. He also served as the first Director of the National Counterterrorism Center under President George W. Bush and founded and served as the first Commander of the United States Navy Fifth Fleet (COMFIFTHFLT). Days before the American commission was announced, the government of the United Kingdom, the U.S.'s primary ally during the Iraq War, announced a similar commission to investigate British intelligence, known as the Butler Inquiry or the Butler Review. The commission was independent and separate from the 9-11 Commission.

This is intended to prevent the destruction of relevant evidence, particularly in cases of alleged trademark, copyright or patent infringements. Overview The order is named after the 1975 English case of Anton Piller KG v Manufacturing Processes Limited, dealing with the theft of trade secrets,. although the first reported such order was granted by Templeman J earlier that year.EMI Limited v Pandit [1975] 1 All ER 418. They are now formally known as search orders in England and Wales, New Zealand, Australia, and India. In Anton Piller, Lord Denning described the nature of the relief: Because such an order does not give the accused party the ability to defend themselves, Anton Piller orders are only issued exceptionally and according to the three-step test set out by Ormrod LJ in Anton Piller: # There is an extremely strong prima facie case against the respondent. # The damage, potential or actual, must be very serious for the applicant. # There must be clear evidence that the respondents have in their possession relevant documents or things and that there is a real possibility that they may destroy such material before an inter partes application can be made.Anton Piller KG v Manufacturing Processes Limited [1976] Ch 55: \\"There are three essential pre-conditions for the making of such an Order, in my judgment. First, there must be an extremely strong prima facie case. Secondly, the damage, potential or actual, must be very serious for the applicant. Thirdly, there must be clear evidence that the defendants have in their possession incriminating documents or things, and that there is a real possibility that they may destroy such material before any application inter partes can be made.\\" In England, it has been reported that approximately 500 Anton Piller orders were granted per year between 1975 and 1980. During the 1990s, this rate had dropped tenfold. Although the name persists in normal usage, the common law application of this order has been largely superseded by a statutory search order under the Civil Procedure Act 1997. A search order under this act \\"does not affect any right of a person to refuse to do anything on the ground that to do so might tend to expose him or his spouse to proceedings for an offence or for the recovery of a penalty\\".S. 7(7), . Hugh Laddie is generally credited with the \\"invention\\" of the Anton Piller order.See Guardian; Telegraph; UCL News (\\"he is credited with having invented the 'Anton Piller' (search and seizure) order and was described by Lord Denning as the 'enterprising' Mr Laddie.\\"); Rouse. . (\\"He is widely credited as being the founding father of the Anton Piller Order.\\"); Howard Knopf. (\\"It was he as a young barrister at the age of 29 who developed the remedy known as the 'Anton Piller order' and won the landmark appellate ruling in a judgment written by Lord Denning confirming its historic place in legal history.\\"). An obituary in The Daily Telegraph stated that he later described the Anton Piller order \\"as a Frankenstein's monster that went far beyond his original design brief\\". In some jurisdictions (for example, Hong Kong and South Africa) where there is no statutory search order, the Anton Piller order is still often used. In South Africa, for example, in Mathias International Ltd v Baillache,. the applicants instituted motion proceedings in which they claimed (i) an Anton Piller order and (ii) interdictory relief directed at prohibiting unlawful competition by the first and second respondents using the applicants' \\"confidential information\\". In Lock International plc v Beswick,Lock International plc v Beswick, (1989) 1 WLR 1268. Anton Piller orders were mentioned as \\"inherently oppressive\\".  Outside England  Anton Piller orders also constitute a common ex parte procedure in intellectual property related cases in some other countries, such as Canada, France, and Italy. France and Belgium Anton Piller orders are known in France and Belgium as saisie-contrefa√ßon (literally, \\"infringement seizure\\") ordersin Belgium also as saisie-description (literally, \\"descriptive seizure\\") orders. The court order may only allow the description of the alleged counterfeited goods and processes, with the aim of obtaining evidence of infringement, or may additionally allow real seizure to take place in addition to the description measures.Pierre V√©ron, Benefiting from National Procedures , IBC Conference 15 & 16 May 2000, International Patent Disputes, Paris, Multinational Actions and Tactics. Such a seizure is enforced by a bailiff, usually accompanied by at least one expert. It can take place on the premises of the alleged infringer, but also at a trade fair for instance. Art. L. 615-5. of the French IP code reads as follows (excerpt only): : The owner of a patent application or the owner of a utility certificate application or the owner of a patent or of a utility certificate shall have the possibility of furnishing proof by any means whatsoever of the infringement of which he claims to be a victim. :He shall further be entitled, on an order given by the President of the First Instance Court of the place of the presumed infringement, to direct any bailiffs, accompanied by experts of his own choice, to proceed with a detailed description, with or without effective seizure, of the allegedly infringing articles or processes. Such order shall be provisionally enforced. It may be subjected to a security on the part of the plaintiff. In that same order, the President of the Court may authorise the bailiff to carry out any enquiry required to ascertain the origin, nature and scope of the infringement. ... \\" (emphasis added)France: Industrial Property (Part II), Code (Consolidation), 01/07/1992 (18/12/1996), No. 92-597 (No. 96-1106) Art. L. 615-5. [OUT OF DATE, 27.08.20: European Union Similar provisions are now required in the rest of Europe, under Article 7 of the European Union Directive on the enforcement of intellectual property rights, approved in April 2004. Australia Anton Piller orders are also used in Australia and are available on grounds similar to that of England. Each superior court jurisdiction provides rules and forms for the manner in which Anton Piller orders are available. In technical modern terminology, Anton Piller orders are referred to as \\"search orders\\", but \\"Anton Piller order\\" remains dominant in everyday use, including in universities. Of great importance is the onus upon an applicant to establish proper grounds for obtaining such an order. This is due to the largely ex parte nature of the application. As such, an applicant must demonstrate not only that it has reasonable grounds for success in its case but must put the likely counter arguments of a respondent if that respondent were present to oppose the order being granted. This is a heavy burden faced by an applicant: its avoidance is not taken lightly by the courts and can result in penalties for its breach (see Columbia Picture Industries v Robinson [1987] Ch 38). Also of great importance is the likely effect of a search upon occupants of the premises, given in particular that the intrusion would otherwise be a trespass: Adani Mining Pty Ltd v Pennings (2020). CanadaCommon-law jurisdictions= The Supreme Court of Canada, in Celanese Canada Inc. v. Murray Demolition Corp.. established guidelines for Anton Piller Orders. The orders are meant to protect evidence from being destroyed, not to gain litigious advantage, and should only be issued if: * The plaintiff has demonstrated a strong prima facie case. * The damage to the plaintiff of the respondent's alleged misconduct, potential or actual, must be very serious. * There must be convincing evidence that the defendant has in its possession incriminating documents or things. * It must be shown that there is a real possibility that the defendant may destroy such material before the discovery process can do its work.Celanese Canada, par. 35. The Court laid out basic protection for the rights of parties involved.Celanese Canada, par. 40. The protections in place are meant to protect solicitor-client privilege by preventing privileged documents from being disclosed.Celanese Canada, par. 1. The search must be conducted according to the following guidelines: * During normal business hours. * Defendant or responsible employee of the defendant should be present. * The persons who may conduct the search should be specified and limited in number. * A copy of the claim should be served on the defendant. * The defendants have a right to contact their lawyer within a reasonable amount of time. * A detailed list of evidence should be made. * Where possible, documents seized should be placed in custody of the supervising lawyer and defence should have the opportunity to review them. * Contested evidence should be kept in the supervising lawyer's custody. The supervising lawyer, referred to as an Independent Supervising Solicitor (ISS), should: # act as a neutral officer of the court, # explain the court‚Äôs order to the defendant, # supervise the search for and seizure of evidence from the defendant, # objectively report to the Court, # aid the Court and counsel for all parties in technical matters. In addition, following the search: * The Order should make clear the responsibilities of the supervising solicitor continue beyond the search itself. * Supervising lawyer should file a report of the search within a time limit describing the execution including who was present and what was seized. * The plaintiff may be required to file and serve a motion for review within a set time in case the defendant does not request such a review. If counsel gains access to privileged documents as a result of an Anton Piller Order, the court must ensure precautionary steps are taken to prevent any potential prejudice ‚Äì including removal of counsel if no alternative is available.Celanese Canada, par. 58‚Äì68. =Quebec (civil law jurisdiction)= The Quebec Court of Appeal has recognized Anton Piller orders as being valid in that province under its civil law., citing and s. 9.1 of the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms  Ireland  Anton Piller orders have been granted by the High Court in William A. Grogan (copyright owner of RAMDIS) v. Monaghan Electrical Ltd & Michael Traynor (1998) related to an unlicensed copy of the RAMDIS software system, Joblin-Purser v. Jackman and Microsoft v. Brightpoint, but the issue has not come before the Supreme Court and, owing to the civil nature of the order and the strong protection given to the family home in the constitution, it currently exists in something of a grey area.  New Zealand  The Anton Piller case is the basis for rule 33.3 of the High Court rules. This rule states that: : (a) an applicant seeking the order has a strong prima facie case on an accrued case of action, : (b) the potential or actual loss or damage to the applicant will be serious if the search order is not made, : (c) there is sufficient evidence in relation to a respondent that: :# the respondent possesses relevant evidentiary material, :# there is a real possibility that the respondent might destroy such material or cause it to be unavailable for use in evidence in a proceeding or anticipated proceeding before the court.Judicature Act 1908 No 89 (as at 1 February 2009), Public Act, Act by section, Schedule 2 High Court Rules, Part 33 Search orders. , New Zealand Legislation: Acts, Consulted on 7 May 2009. Impoundment orders in the United States Orders comparable to Anton Piller orders have long been available in the United States under section 503(a) of the Copyright Act (17 USC, ¬ß 503(a)), which provides for the impounding of allegedly infringing copies of works and equipment for making them.Section 503(a) provides: \\"At any time while an action under this title is pending, the court may order the impounding, on such terms as it may deem reasonable, of all copies or phonorecords claimed to have been made or used in violation of the copyright owner's exclusive rights, and of all plates, molds, matrices, masters, tapes, film negatives, or other articles by means of which such copies or phonorecords may be reproduced.\\" The corresponding provision of the 1909 Copyright Act (¬ß 25) provided for issuance of orders to \\"deliver up on oath for destruction all the infringing copies or devices, as well as all plates, molds, matrices, or other means for making such infringing copies as the court may order. In recent years, questions have been raised about the abusive use of these orders,In , the court found that the copyright owner used \\"high-handed methods\\" and that the impoundment \\"action was conducted in a ‚Äòvexatious,‚Äô ‚Äòoppressive,‚Äô and ‚Äòunreasonable‚Äô manner.\\" and the doubtful constitutionality of the procedures used.In the Dae Rim case, the district court found that the procedures used violated the U.S. Constitution, but the court of appeals found it unnecessary to reach the constitutional issue because of other defects in the impoundment, stating: \\"Because we agree that Warner's attorney ran roughshod over the applicable statutes and rules, we follow standard practice in not reaching the issue of constitutionality.\\" See also . More recent decisions in the field have tended to require that impoundment must be necessary, reasonable, and comport with the requirements of due process.See  Combination with Mareva injunction  An Anton Piller order is often combined with a Mareva injunction, enabling an applicant to have the respondent's assets frozen so they cannot be dissipated to frustrate the judgment. This can, however, be disastrous for a defendant as the cumulative effect of these orders can be to destroy the whole of a business' custom, by freezing most of its assets and revealing important information to its competitors.

He was Professor of Anatomy and Chemistry at the University of Glasgow for 10 years from 1756, and then Professor of Medicine and Chemistry at the University of Edinburgh from 1766, teaching and lecturing there for more than 30 years. The chemistry buildings at both the University of Edinburgh and the University of Glasgow are named after Black. Early life and education Black was born in Bordeaux, France, the sixth of the 12 children of Margaret Gordon (d. 1747) and John Black. His mother was from an Aberdeenshire family that had connections with the wine business and his father was from Belfast, Ireland and worked as a factor in the wine trade. (Translated from the second German edition.) He was educated at home until the age of 12, after which he attended grammar school in Belfast. In 1746 at the age of 18 he entered the University of Glasgow, studying there for four years before spending another four at the University of Edinburgh, furthering his medical studies. During his studies he wrote a doctorate thesis on the treatment of kidney stones with the salt magnesium carbonate. Work=Chemical principles Like most 18th-century experimentalists, Black's conceptualisation of chemistry was based on five 'principles' of matter: Water, Salt, Earth, Fire and Metal. He added the principle of 'Air' when his experiments definitely confirmed the presence of carbon dioxide, which he called 'fixed air'. Black's research was guided by questions relating to how the 'principles' combined with each other in various different forms and mixtures. He used the term 'affinity' to describe the force that held such combinations together. Throughout his career he used a variety of diagrams and formulas to teach his University of Edinburgh students how to manipulate 'affinity' through different kinds of experimentation. Analytical balance A precision analytical balance In about 1750, while still a student, Black developed the analytical balance based on a light-weight beam balanced on a wedge-shaped fulcrum. Each arm carried a pan on which the sample or standard weights was placed. It far exceeded the accuracy of any other balance of the time and became an important scientific instrument in most chemistry laboratories. Latent heat The world's first ice-calorimeter, used in the winter of 1782‚Äì83, by Antoine Lavoisier and Pierre-Simon Laplace, to determine the heat evolved in various chemical changes, calculations which were based on Joseph Black's prior discovery of latent heat. In 1757, Black was appointed Regius Professor of the Practice of Medicine at the University of Glasgow. In 1761 he deduced that the application of heat to ice at its melting point does not cause a rise in temperature of the ice/water mixture, but rather an increase in the amount of water in the mixture. Additionally, Black observed that the application of heat to boiling water does not result in a rise in temperature of a water/steam mixture, but rather an increase in the amount of steam. From these observations, he concluded that the heat applied must have combined with the ice particles and boiling water and become latent. The theory of latent heat marks the beginning of thermodynamics. Black's theory of latent heat was one of his more-important scientific contributions, and one on which his scientific fame chiefly rests. He also showed that different substances have different specific heats. The theory ultimately proved important not only in the development of abstract science but in the development of the steam engine. Black and James Watt became friends after meeting around 1757 while both were at Glasgow. Black provided significant financing and other support for Watt's early research in steam power. Black's discovery of the latent heat of water would have been interesting to Watt, informing his attempts to improve the efficiency of the steam engine invented by Thomas Newcomen and develop the science of thermodynamics. Carbon dioxide Black also explored the properties of a gas produced in various reactions. He found that limestone (calcium carbonate) could be heated or treated with acids to yield a gas he called \\"fixed air.\\" He observed that the fixed air was denser than air and did not support either flame or animal life. Black also found that when bubbled through an aqueous solution of lime (calcium hydroxide), it would precipitate calcium carbonate. He used this phenomenon to illustrate that carbon dioxide is produced by animal respiration and microbial fermentation. Professorship In 1766, treading in the footsteps of his friend and former teacher at the University of Glasgow, Black succeeded William Cullen as Professor of Medicine and Chemistry at the University of Edinburgh (Cullen had moved to Edinburgh in 1755). His position at Glasgow University was filled by Alexander Stevenson.Medical and Philosophical Commentaries 1792 At this point he gave up research and devoted himself exclusively to teaching. In this he was successful with audience attendance at his lectures increasing from year to year for more than thirty years. His lectures had a powerful effect in popularising chemistry and attendance at them even came to be a fashionable amusement. Black was widely recognised as one of the most popular lecturers at the University. His chemistry course regularly attracted an exceptionally high number of students, with many attending two or three times. In addition to regularly introducing cutting-edge topics and meticulously selecting visually impressive experiments, Black employed a wide array of successful teaching tools that made chemistry accessible to his students (many of whom were as young as 14 years old). His students came from across the United Kingdom, its colonies and Europe, and hundreds of them preserved his lectures in their notebooks and disseminated his ideas after they left university. On 17 November 1783 he became one of the founders of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf From 1788 to 1790 he was President of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. He was a member of the revision committee for the editions of the college's Pharmacopoeia Edinburgensis of 1774, 1783, and 1794. Black was appointed principal physician to King George III in Scotland. Black's research and teaching were reduced as a result of poor health. From 1793 his health declined further and he gradually withdrew from his teaching duties. In 1795, Charles Hope was appointed his coadjutor in his professorship, and in 1797 he lectured for the last time.  Personal life  Joseph Black's grave in Greyfriars Kirkyard in Edinburgh Black was a member of The Poker Club. He was 1st cousin, great friend and colleague to Adam Ferguson FRSE who married his niece Katherine Burnett in 1767, and associated with David Hume, Adam Smith, and the literati of the Scottish Enlightenment. He was also close to pioneering geologist James Hutton.Records of the Clan and Name of Ferguson 1895 p.138 note 1 accessed 22 Dec 2018 In 1773 he is listed as living on College Wynd on the south side of the Old Town.Edinburgh Post Office directory 1773 Black never married. He died peacefully at his home in Edinburgh in 1799 at the age of 71 and is buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard. The large monument lies in the sealed section to the south-west known as the Covenanter's Prison. In 2011, scientific equipment believed to belong to Black was discovered during an archaeological dig at the University of Edinburgh.

Fair value accounting has been a part of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the United States since the early 1990s, and is now regarded as the \\"gold standard\\" in some circles. Failure to use it is viewed as the cause of the Orange County Bankruptcy, even though its use is considered to be one of the reasons for the Enron scandal and the eventual bankruptcy of the company, as well as the closure of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen. Mark-to-market accounting can change values on the balance sheet as market conditions change. In contrast, historical cost accounting, based on the past transactions, is simpler, more stable, and easier to perform, but does not represent current market value. It summarizes past transactions instead. Mark-to-market accounting can become volatile if market prices fluctuate greatly or change unpredictably. Buyers and sellers may claim a number of specific instances when this is the case, including inability to value the future income and expenses both accurately and collectively, often due to unreliable information, or over-optimistic or over- pessimistic expectations of cash flow and earnings. History and development In the 1800s in the U.S., marking to market was the usual practice of bookkeepers. This has been blamed for contributing to the frequent recessions up to the Great Depression and for the collapse of banks. The Securities and Exchange Commission told President Franklin Roosevelt that he should get rid of it, which he did in 1938. From minute 13. But in the 1980s the practice spread to major banks and corporations, and beginning in the 1990s mark-to-market accounting began to result in scandals. To understand the original practice, consider that a futures trader, when beginning an account (or \\"position\\"), deposits money, termed a \\"margin\\", with the exchange. This is intended to protect the exchange against loss. At the end of every trading day, the contract is marked to its present market value. If the trader is on the winning side of a deal, his contract has increased in value that day, and the exchange pays this profit into his account. On the other hand, if the market price of his contract has decreased, the exchange charges his account that holds the deposited margin. If the balance of this account becomes less than the deposit required to maintain the account, the trader must immediately pay additional margin into the account in order to maintain the account (a \\"margin call\\"). (The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, doing even more, marks positions to market twice a day, at 10:00 am and 2:00 pm.)SEC Info - Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc - S-4/A - On 3/10/00 Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives on the other hand are formula-based financial contracts between buyers and sellers, and are not traded on exchanges, so their market prices are not established by any active, regulated market trading. Market values are, therefore, not objectively determined or available readily (purchasers of derivative contracts are typically furnished with computer programs which compute market values based upon data input from the active markets and the provided formulas). During their early development, OTC derivatives such as interest rate swaps were not marked to market frequently. Deals were monitored on a quarterly or annual basis, when gains or losses would be acknowledged or payments exchanged. As the practice of marking to market became more used by corporations and banks, some of them seem to have discovered that this was a tempting way to commit accounting fraud, especially when the market price could not be determined objectively (because there was no real day-to-day market available or the asset value was derived from other traded commodities, such as crude oil futures), so assets were being \\"marked to model\\" in a hypothetical or synthetic manner using estimated valuations derived from financial modeling, and sometimes marked in a manipulative manner to achieve spurious valuations. The most infamous use of mark-to-market in this way was the Enron scandal. After the Enron scandal, changes were made to the mark to market method by the Sarbanes‚ÄìOxley Act during 2002. The Act affected mark to market by forcing companies to implement stricter accounting standards. The stricter standards included more explicit financial reporting, stronger internal controls to prevent and identify fraud, and auditor independence. In addition, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) was created by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the purpose of overseeing audits. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also implemented harsher penalties for fraud, such as enhanced prison sentences and fines for committing fraud. Although the law was created to restore investor confidence, the cost of implementing the regulations caused many companies to avoid registering on stock exchanges in the United States.Moffett, R., & Grant, G.. (2011, March). Internal Controls and Fraud Prevention. Internal Auditing, 26(2), 3-12. Retrieved March 29, 2012, from ABI/INFORM Global. (Document ID: 2329679601). Internal Revenue Code Section 475 contains the mark to market accounting method rule for taxation. Section 475 provides that qualified securities dealers who elect mark to market treatment shall recognize gain or loss as if the property were sold for its fair market value on the last business day of the year, and any gain or loss shall be taken into account for that year. The section also provides that dealers in commodities can elect mark to market treatment for any commodity (or their derivatives) which is actively traded (i.e., for which there is an established financial market that provides a reasonable basis to determine fair market value by disseminating price quotes from broker/dealers or actual prices from recent transactions). FAS 115 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, commonly known as \\"FAS 115\\", is an accounting standard issued during May 1993 by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which became effective for entities with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1993.Financial Accounting Standards Board, \\"Summary of Statement No. 115\\" Retrieved August 23, 2014.Financial Accounting Standards Board, \\"Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115\\" Retrieved August 23, 2014. FAS 115 addresses the accounting and reporting for investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values and for all investments in debt securities. Those investments are to be classified in three categories and accounted for as follows: *Debt securities that the enterprise has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as \\"held-to- maturity\\" securities and reported at amortized cost less impairment. (Amortization refers to spreading payments over multiple periods.) *Debt and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as \\"trading\\" securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. *Debt and equity securities not classified as either held-to-maturity securities or trading securities are classified as \\"available-for-sale\\" securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in a separate component of shareholders' equity (Other Comprehensive Income). FAS 124 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 124, Accounting for Certain Investments Held by Not- for-Profit Organizations, commonly known as \\"FAS 124\\", is an accounting standard issued during November 1995 by FASB, which became effective for entities with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995.Financial Accounting Standards Board, \\"Summary of Statement No. 124\\" Retrieved August 31, 2014.Financial Accounting Standards Board, \\"Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 124\\" Retrieved August 31, 2014. FAS 124 requires that, for investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values and for all investments in debt securities, a not-for-profit organization must report them at fair value, with gains and losses included in a Statement of Activities. A narrow exception is made to allow limited held- to-maturity accounting for a not-for-profit organization if comparable business entities are engaged in the same industry. FAS 157 / Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, commonly known as \\"FAS 157\\", is an accounting standard issued during September 2006 by FASB, which became effective for entities with fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007.Financial Accounting Standards Board, \\"Summary of Statement No. 157\\" Retrieved June 13, 2009.Financial Accounting Standards Board, \\"Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157\\" Retrieved August 23, 2014.Taub S. (2007). FAS 157 Could Cause Huge Write-offs. CFO.com. FAS Statement 157 includes the following: *Clarity of the definition of fair value; *A fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of information used in fair value measurements (i.e., market-based or non-market based); *Expanded disclosure requirements for assets and liabilities measured at fair value; and *A modification of the long-standing accounting presumption that a measurement- date-specific transaction price of an asset or liability equals its same measurement-date-specific fair value. *Clarification that changes in credit risk (both that of the counterparty and the company's own credit rating) must be included in the valuation. FAS 157 defines \\"fair value\\" as: \\"The price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date\\". FAS 157 only applies when another accounting rule requires or permits a fair value measure for that item. While FAS 157 does not introduce any new requirements mandating the use of fair value, the definition as outlined does introduce certain important differences. First, it is based on the exit price (for an asset, the price at which it would be sold (bid price)) rather than an entry price (for an asset, the price at which it would be bought (ask price)), regardless of whether the entity plans to hold the asset for investment or resell it later. Second, FAS 157 emphasizes that fair value is market-based rather than entity-specific. Thus, the optimism that often characterizes an asset acquirer must be replaced with the skepticism that typically characterizes a dispassionate, risk-averse buyer. FAS 157's fair value hierarchy underpins the concepts of the standard. The hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of information used to determine fair values, with level 1 inputs being the most reliable and level 3 inputs being the least reliable. Information based on direct observations of transactions (e.g., quoted prices) involving the same assets and liabilities, not assumptions, offers superior reliability; whereas, inputs based on unobservable data or a reporting entity's own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use are the least reliable. A typical example of the latter is shares of a privately owned company the value of which is based on projected cash flows. Problems can occur when the market-based measurement does not accurately represent the underlying asset's true value. This can occur when a company is forced to calculate the selling price of these assets or liabilities during unfavorable or volatile times, such as a financial crisis. For example, if the liquidity is low or investors are fearful, the current selling price of a bank's assets could be much less than the value under normal liquidity conditions. The result would be a lowered shareholders' equity. This case occurred during the financial crisis of 2008/09 where many securities held on banks' balance sheets could not be valued efficiently as the markets had disappeared from them. During April 2009, however, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) voted on and approved new guidelines that would allow for the valuation to be based on a price that would be received in an orderly market rather than a forced liquidation, starting during the first quarter of 2009. Although FAS 157 does not require fair value to be used on any new classes of assets, it does apply to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value in accordance with other applicable rules. The accounting rules for which assets and liabilities are held at fair value are complex. Mutual funds and securities companies have recorded assets and some liabilities at fair value for decades in accordance with securities regulations and other accounting guidance. For commercial banks and other types of financial services companies, some asset classes are required to be recorded at fair value, such as derivatives and marketable equity securities. For other types of assets, such as loan receivables and debt securities, it depends on whether the assets are held for trading (active buying and selling) or for investment. All trading assets are recorded at fair value. Loans and debt securities that are held for investment or to maturity are recorded at amortized cost, unless they are deemed to be impaired (in which case, a loss is recognized). However, if they are available for sale or held for sale, they are required to be recorded at fair value or the lower of cost or fair value, respectively. (FAS 65 and FAS 114 cover the accounting for loans, and FAS 115 covers the accounting for securities.) Notwithstanding the above, companies are permitted to account for almost any financial instrument at fair value, which they might elect to do in lieu of historical cost accounting (see FAS 159, \\"The Fair Value Option\\"). Thus, FAS 157 applies in the cases above where a company is required or elects to record an asset or liability at fair value. The rule requires a mark to \\"market\\", rather than to some theoretical price calculated by a computer ‚Äî a system often criticized as \\"mark to make-believe\\". (Occasionally, for certain types of assets, the rule allows for using a model.) Sometimes, there is a weak market for assets which trade relatively infrequently - often during an economic crisis. During these periods, there are few, if any buyers for such products. This complicates the marking process. In the absence of market information, an entity is allowed to use its own assumptions, but the objective is still the same: what would be the current value of a sale to a willing buyer. In developing its own assumptions, the entity can not ignore any available market data, such as interest rates, default rates, prepayment speeds, etc. FAS 157 does not distinguish between non cash-generating assets, i.e., broken equipment, which can theoretically have zero value if nobody will buy them in the market ‚Äì and cash-generating assets, like securities, which are still worth something for as long as they earn some income from their underlying assets. The latter cannot be marked down indefinitely, or at some point, can create incentives for company insiders to buy them from the company at the under-valued prices. Insiders are in the best position to determine the creditworthiness of such securities going forward. In theory, this price pressure should balance market prices to accurately represent the \\"fair value\\" of a particular asset. Purchasers of distressed assets should buy undervalued securities, thus increasing prices, allowing other Companies to consequently mark up their similar holdings. Also new in FAS 157 is the idea of nonperformance risk. FAS 157 requires that in valuing a liability, an entity should consider the nonperformance risk. If FAS 157 simply required that fair value be recorded as an exit price, then nonperformance risk would be extinguished upon exit. However, FAS 157 defines fair value as the price at which you would transfer a liability. In other words, the nonperformance that must be valued should incorporate the correct discount rate for an ongoing contract. An example would be to apply higher discount rate to the future cash flows to account for the credit risk above the stated interest rate. The Basis for Conclusions section has an extensive explanation of what was intended by the original statement with regards to nonperformance risk (paragraphs C40-C49). In response to the rapid developments of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, the FASB is fast-tracking the issuance of the proposed FAS 157-d, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset in a Market That Is Not Active.FASB News Center Under Accounting Standards Codification, FASB's fair value accounting guidance has been codified as Topic 820. IFRS 13 IFRS 13, Fair Value Measurement, was adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board on May 12, 2011. IFRS 13 provides guidance for how to perform fair value measurement under International Financial Reporting Standards and took effect on January 1, 2013. It does not provide guidance as to when fair value should be used. The guidance is similar to the US GAAP guidance. Simple example Example: If an investor owns 10 shares of a stock purchased for $4 per share, and that stock now trades at $6, the \\"mark-to-market\\" value of the shares is equal to (10 shares * $6), or $60, whereas the book value might (depending on the accounting principles used) only equal $40. Similarly, if the stock decreases to $3, the mark-to-market value is $30 and the investor has an unrealized loss of $10 on the original investment. This can create problems in the following period when the \\"mark-to-market\\" (accrual) is reversed. If the market price has changed between the ending period (12/31/prior year) and the opening market price of the following year (1/1/current year), then there is an accrual variance that must be taken into account. Marking-to-market a derivatives position In marking-to-market a derivatives account, at pre- determined periodic intervals, each counterparty exchanges the change in the market value of their account in cash. For Over-The-Counter (OTC) derivatives, when one counterparty defaults, the sequence of events that follows is governed by an ISDA contract. When using models to compute the ongoing exposure, FAS 157 requires that the entity consider the default risk (\\"nonperformance risk\\") of the counterparty and make a necessary adjustment to its computations. For exchange traded derivatives, if one of the counterparties defaults in this periodic exchange, that counterparty's account is immediately closed by the exchange and the clearing house is substituted for that counterparty's account. Marking-to-market virtually eliminates credit risk, but it requires the use of monitoring systems that usually only large institutions can afford.* Use by brokers Stock brokers allow their clients to access credit via margin accounts. These accounts allow clients to borrow funds to buy securities. Therefore, the amount of funds available is more than the value of cash (or equivalents). The credit is provided by charging a rate of interest and requiring a certain amount of collateral, in a similar way that banks provide loans. Even though the value of securities (stocks or other financial instruments such as options) fluctuates in the market, the value of accounts is not computed in real time. Marking-to-market is performed typically at the end of the trading day, and if the account value decreases below a given threshold (typically a ratio predefined by the broker), the broker issues a margin call that requires the client to deposit more funds or liquidate the account.  Mark-to-market accounting use by Enron  In Enron's natural gas business, the accounting had been fairly straightforward: in each time period, the company listed actual costs of supplying the gas and actual revenues received from selling it. However, when Skilling joined the company, he demanded that the trading business adopt mark-to-market accounting, claiming that it would represent \\"true economic value\\". Enron became the first nonfinancial company to use the method to account for its complex long-term contracts. Mark-to-market accounting requires that once a long-term contract has been signed, income is estimated as the present value of net future cash flow. Often, the viability of these contracts and their related costs were difficult to estimate. Owing to the large discrepancies between reported profits and cash, investors were typically given false or misleading reports. Under this method, income from projects could be recorded, although the firm might never have received the money, with this income increasing financial earnings on the books. However, because in future years the profits could not be included, new and additional income had to be included from more projects to develop additional growth to appease investors. As one Enron competitor stated, \\"If you accelerate your income, then you have to keep doing more and more deals to show the same or rising income.\\" Despite potential pitfalls, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the accounting method for Enron in its trading of natural gas futures contracts on January 30, 1992. However, Enron later expanded its use to other areas in the company to help it meet Wall Street projections. For one contract, in July 2000, Enron and Blockbuster Video signed a 20-year agreement to introduce on-demand entertainment to various U.S. cities by year's end. After several pilot projects, Enron claimed estimated profits of more than $110 million from the deal, even though analysts questioned the technical viability and market demand of the service. When the network failed to work, Blockbuster withdrew from the contract. Enron continued to claim future profits, even though the deal resulted in a loss. Effect on subprime crisis and Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 Former Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chair William Isaac placed much of the blame for the subprime mortgage crisis on the Securities and Exchange Commission and its fair-value accounting rules, especially the requirement for banks to mark their assets to market, particularly mortgage-backed securities (MBS).\\"Former FDIC Chair Blames SEC for Credit Crunch\\", CNBC, October 9, 2008. Retrieved January 25, 2010. A review found little evidence that fair-value accounting had caused or exacerbated the crisis.Laux C, Leuz C. (2010). Did Fair-Value Accounting Contribute to the Financial Crisis? . See also a free preprint. The debate occurs because this accounting rule requires companies to adjust the value of marketable securities (such as the MBS) to their market value. The intent of the standard is to help investors understand the value of these assets at a specific time, rather than just their historical purchase price. Because the market for these assets is distressed, it is difficult to sell many MBS at other than prices which may (or may not) be representative of market stresses, which may be less than the value that the mortgage cash flow related to the MBS would merit. As initially interpreted by companies and their auditors, the typically lesser sale value was used as the market value rather than the cash flow value. Many large financial institutions recognized significant losses during 2007 and 2008 as a result of marking-down MBS asset prices to market value. For some institutions, this also triggered a margin call, such that lenders that had provided the funds using the MBS as collateral had contractual rights to get their money back.Example of a margin call This resulted in further forced sales of MBS and emergency efforts to obtain cash (liquidity) to pay off the margin call. Markdowns may also reduce the value of bank regulatory capital, requiring additional capital raising and creating uncertainty regarding the health of the bank.Katz, Ian. \\"Behind Schwarzman Spat With Wasserstein Lies Rule 115\\" Bloomberg News. December 8, 2008. Retrieved June 13, 2009. It is the combination of the extensive use of financial leverage (i.e., borrowing to invest, leaving limited funds in the event of recession), margin calls and large reported losses that may have exacerbated the crisis.Westbrook, Jesse. \\"SEC, FASB Resist Calls to Suspend Fair-Value Rules\\" Bloomberg News.

If cash flow-derived value ‚Äî which excludes market judgment as to default risk but may also more accurately represent \\"actual\\" value if the market is sufficiently distressed ‚Äî is used (rather than sale value), the size of market-value adjustments required by the accounting standard would be typically reduced. On September 30, 2008, the SEC and the FASB issued a joint clarification regarding the implementation of fair value accounting in cases where a market is disorderly or inactive. This guidance clarified that forced liquidations are not indicative of fair value, as this is not an \\"orderly\\" transaction. Further, it clarifies that estimates of fair value can be made using the expected cash flows from such instruments, provided that the estimates represent adjustments that a willing buyer would make, such as adjustments for default and liquidity risks.Clarifications on Fair Value Accounting, SEC, September 30, 2008.

IR performs both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures through very small incisions or body orifices. Diagnostic IR procedures are those intended to help make a diagnosis or guide further medical treatment, and include image- guided biopsy of a tumor or injection of an imaging contrast agent into a hollow structure, such as a blood vessel or a duct. By contrast, therapeutic IR procedures provide direct treatment‚Äîthey include catheter-based medicine delivery, medical device placement (e.g., stents), and angioplasty of narrowed structures. The main benefits of interventional radiology techniques are that they can reach the deep structures of the body through a body orifice or tiny incision using small needles and wires. That decreases risks, pain, and recovery compared to open procedures. Real-time visualization also allows precision guidance to the abnormality, making the procedure or diagnosis more accurate. These benefits are weighed against the additional risks of lack of immediate access to internal structures (should bleeding or a perforation occur), and the risks of radiation exposure such as cataracts and cancer.  Types of interventional radiology =Common elements Interventional radiology is a set of techniques that allows access to the internal structures of the body through body orifices or very small incisions and guidance with medical imaging. Regardless of the reason for the intervention, the procedure will likely use common elements such as a puncture needle (to pass through the skin), guidewires (to guide through structures such as blood vessels or the biliary or urinary systems), a sheath (which slides over the guidewire and hold the path open without injuring it), and catheters (that allow fluids to be pushed through them). Also common to all intervention radiology procedures are the medical imaging machines that allow the healthcare provider to see what is occurring within the body. Some use x-rays (such as CT and fluoroscopy) and some do not (such as ultrasound and MRI). In each case, the images created may be modified by computer to better visualize the structures as is in the case with digital subtraction angiography, CT and MRI, or the display of the images improved with virtual reality or augmented reality presentation. Diagnostic interventional radiology * Angiography: Imaging the blood vessels to look for abnormalities with the use of various contrast media, including iodinated contrast, gadolinium based agents, and CO2 gas. * Cholangiography: Imaging the bile ducts within the liver to look for areas of blockage. * Biopsy: Taking of a tissue sample from the area of interest for pathological examination from a percutaneous or transvenous approach. Therapeutic interventional radiology Vascular * Balloon angioplasty/stent: Opening of narrow or blocked blood vessels using a balloon, with or without placement of metallic stents to aid in keep vessel patent. * Endovascular aneurysm repair: Placement of endovascular stent-graft across an aneurysm to prevent expansion or progression of the defective vessel. * Embolization: Placement of a metallic coil or embolic substance (gel-foam, poly-vinyl alcohol) to block blood through to a blood vessel, either to stop bleeding or decrease blood flow to a target organ or tissue. **Uterine artery embolization (UAE) or uterine fibroid embolization (UFE) ** Prostate artery embolization (PAE) **Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) embolization * Thrombolysis: Catheter-directed technique for dissolving blood clots, such as pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis, with either pharmaceutical (TPA) or mechanical means. * IVC filters: Metallic filters placed in the vena cava to prevent propagation of deep venous thrombus. * Dialysis related interventions: Placement of tunneled hemodialysis catheters, peritoneal dialysis catheters, and revision/thrombolysis of poorly functioning surgically placed AV fistulas and grafts. *TIPS Procedure SchematicTIPS: Placement of a Transjugular Intrahepatic Porto-systemic Shunt (TIPS) for select indications in patients with critical end-stage liver disease and portal hypertension. * Endovenous laser treatment of varicose veins: Placement of thin laser fiber in varicose veins for non-surgical treatment of venous insufficiency. Biliary stenosis Biliary intervention * Placement of catheters in the biliary system to bypass biliary obstructions and decompress the biliary system. * Placement of permanent indwelling biliary stents. * Cholecystostomy: Placement of a tube into the gallbladder to remove infected bile in patients with cholecystitis, an inflammation of the gallbladder, who are too frail or too sick to undergo surgery. Catheter placement * Central venous catheter placement: Vascular access and management of intravenous devices (IVs), including both tunneled and non-tunneled catheters (e.g., PIC, Hickman, port catheters, hemodialysis catheters, translumbar and transhepatic venous lines). * Drainage catheter placement: Placement of tubes to drain pathologic fluid collections (e.g., abscess, pleural effusion). This may be achieved by percutaneous, trans- rectal, or trans-vaginal approach. Exchange or repositioning of indwelling catheters is achieved over a guidewire under image guidance. * Radiologically inserted gastrostomy or jejunostomy : Placement of a feeding tube percutaneously into the stomach and/or jejunum. Ablative * Chemoembolization: Combined injection of chemotherapy and embolic agents into the arterial blood supply of a tumor, with the goal of both local administration of chemotherapy, slowing \\"washout\\" of the chemotherapy drug, and also decreasing tumor arterial supply * Radioembolization: Combined injection of radioactive glass or plastic beads and embolic agents into the arterial blood supply of a tumor, with the goal of both local administration of radiotherapy, slowing \\"washout\\" of the radioactive substance, and also decreasing tumor arterial supply * Radiofrequency ablation (RF/RFA): Local treatment in which a special catheter destroys tissue with heat generated by medium frequency alternating currents * Cryoablation: Local treatment with a special catheter that destroys tissue with cold temperature generated by rapid expansion of compressed argon gas‚Äîused mostly to treat small renal cancers and for the palliation of painful bone lesions * Microwave ablation: Local treatment with a special catheter that destroys tissue with heat generated by microwaves Genitourinary * Percutaneous nephrostomy or nephroureteral stent placement: Placement of a catheter through the skin, directly into the kidney to drain from the collecting system. This is typically done to treat a downstream obstruction of urine. * Ureteral stent exchange: indwelling double-J type ureteral stents, typically placed by urologist using cystoscopy, may be exchanged in retrograde fashion through the female urethra. The IR uses a thin wire snare under fluoroscopy to capture the distal portion of the stent. After partially extracting the distalmost stent, exchange for a new stent can be accomplished over a guidewire. Techniques for specific disorders= Biliary intervention  Gastrointestinal Bleeds = The treatment of a gastrointestinal bleed can range anywhere from monitoring an asymptomatic bleed to supporting and maintaining the hemodynamic function of the patient. The role for the interventional radiologist is to offer patients an image- guided, minimally invasive procedure to alleviate a condition that could be otherwise be potentially life-threatening. The avenue for the interventional radiologist to dictate the clinical course of a GI bleed is largely influenced by location of bleed, overall patient health and other conditions the patient may have, most notably heart and liver functions. For most cases, collaboration between the gastroenterologist and interventional radiologist optimizes patient outcome but again, is largely dictated by anatomical location of the GI bleed. If a patient is evaluated and determined to be a candidate for an interventional procedure, then the bleed is often treated by embolization. Embolization is a process in which the interventional radiologist accesses the culprit bleeding vessel via a small catheter and interrupts blood flow to the site of bleeding via various mechanisms. Side effects of this procedure are minimal but there is a risk of bleeding and infection‚Äîthough much less than the equivalent surgical procedure. When successful, the procedure often eliminates the bleed and patients can walk after a few hours of rest. = Hepatobiliary = A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is a procedure an interventional radiologist performs to create a shunt (essentially, a new conduit allowing for blood flow) between the hepatic inferior vena cava and the portal vein, a vessel that returns blood from the intestines to the liver. The portal vein is the site where hypertension (high blood pressure) can produce a myriad of deleterious effects throughout the liver and small or large intestine. Primarily, a TIPS functions to alleviate two different conditions: an emergent/life-threatening GI bleed or ascites (excessive abdominal fluid) caused by too high of blood pressure in the portal vein that is otherwise uncontrolled by diet and medications. The workup for the procedure is straightforward and the interventional radiologist performing the procedure often orders several tests to assess how well the patient will tolerate the procedure. These are often simple blood tests, and an ultrasound of the heart and liver. The procedure is often well tolerated and can result in a permanent reduction or elimination of symptoms. The procedure can take anywhere between 15 minutes to an hour and has lower risks of bleeding or infection compared to an equivalent surgical procedure. A TIPS may cause temporary confusion or worsening of liver/heart function. The degree of these two side effects largely depend on the health of the patient's heart and liver prior to the procedure and the risk-benefits of the procedure must be thoroughly discussed with their interventional radiologist before beginning. If the post-procedural consequences are more troublesome to the patient than their initial symptoms the artificial conduit created by the procedure can be reversed if the post- procedural side effects outweigh those caused by the prior conditions. = Biliary disease = In addition to normal normal liver tissue, the liver has three main vessels traversing it: arteries, veins and bile ducts. While bile is made in the liver and stored in the gallbladder, the bile eventually passes into the GI tract through the hepatic, cystic and common bile ducts. Any condition that prevents the normal flow of bile from the liver, through these bile vessels and into the GI tract can cause a condition called jaundice. While jaundice can be caused by a few viruses that the human body can naturally clear, jaundice in the setting of an obstruction is usually caused by a cancer and can result in intolerable itching and a worsening of liver function that can be life-threatening. Depending on a patient's condition, this type of obstructive jaundice can be alleviated with surgery or chemotherapy but if these measures fail to restore proper flow of bile, an interventional radiologist can perform a procedure called a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC). A PTC is an outpatient procedure lasting anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour where an interventional radiologist accesses the patient's bile duct system with a needle through the skin and liver under imaging guidance. Using fluoroscopy (essentially an Xray camera) to guide a wire (followed by a catheter over the wire) through the bile duct system and into the GI tract, essentially restoring the normal flow of bile. If the patient's GI tract cannot be accessed due to the obstruction, the catheter can be placed to drain the bile duct system into a bag that the patient can wear during daily activities. Risks of this procedure include bleeding and infection but these are much lower than an equivalent surgical procedure.  Genitourinary diseases  Benign prostatic hyperplasia = Benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, is a noncancerous condition that commonly affects men over the age of 50. The prostate gland enlarges and compresses the adjacent urethra, making it difficult for men to control frequency and/or urgency of urination. First line therapy involves medication, though long-term treatment for symptoms that are persistent despite medical optimization typically involves transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) as the \\"gold standard\\" of care. However, TURP can lead to urinary incontinence or permanent male infertility and may not be the ideal procedure for a certain subset of patients. For those reasons, a physician may recommend undergoing a treatment known as prostate artery embolization (PAE). Patients typically go home the same day as the procedure and can expect to feel some symptom relief in a matter of days. Though rare, risks of PAE include unintentional embolization of nearby blood vessels, which can result in loss of blood flow to surrounding areas of the bladder or rectum. Data suggests that TURP may have higher rates of symptom resolution at 1 and 6 months, but PAE appears to provide lower risks of complications more commonly associated with surgery, such as infection. = Kidney stone disease = Kidney stones can be present along any part of the course of the urinary tract from the kidneys to the urethra. The most common symptoms, whether in men or women, are sudden onset, intense flank pain accompanied by blood in the urine. Most kidney stones pass spontaneously, but larger ones (greater than 5 mm) are less likely to, and can cause severe pain or infection. The interventional radiologist plays a large clinical role in the treatment of kidney stones that are unlikely to pass on their own. The gold standard of treatment for these types of stones is surgical removal. However, some patients have an infected stone and are simply too ill for an operative surgical removal. In these instances, the mainstay of IR treatment is a percutaneous nephrostomy tube. This is a procedure where a small caliber catheter is placed through the skin and into the urinary collecting system upstream of the stone. This procedure not only drains any infection, often bringing about a precipitous improvement in the patient's symptoms but also diverts urine‚Äîthus giving the patient more time to recover before definitive surgical treatment. = Varicocele = A varicocele is defined as an enlargement of the veins within the scrotum, most commonly occurring on the left side due to anatomical reasons. When this happens, blood can stagnate within these dilated veins and cause temperature fluctuations within the testicle itself. The exact cause to this condition remains unknown and an ill-favored sequela can be male infertility. The mainstay of treatment for this condition within the field of interventional radiology is varicocele embolization. An embolization, within the context of this procedure, results in the interruption of venous blood flow. The interruption of blood flow abates venous dilation of blood that can lead to impaired testicular temperature regulation and theoretically improve infertility. The physician accesses the dilated scrotal veins with a small catheter via a vein in the groin and embolize the varicocele. Patients often tolerate this procedure well and are able to return home the same day.  Neurological intervention  Acute ischemic stroke = About 87% of all strokes are ischemic strokes, in which blood flow to the brain is blocked. A clot-busting medication such as tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) can be used in a controlled hospital setting to dissolve the clot and help restore blood flow to the damaged area of the brain. Certain patients who are suffering from an acute ischemic stroke may be candidates for endovascular therapy. Endovascular therapy is a procedure performed by neurointerventionalists to remove or dissolve the thrombus (clot) and restore blood flow to parts of the brain. Using a catheter that is directed through the blood vessels in the arm or leg up to the brain, the interventionalist can remove the thrombus or deliver drugs to dissolve the thrombus. These procedures are referred to as mechanical thrombectomy or thrombolysis, and several factors are considered before the procedure is completed. People who may be eligible for endovascular treatment have a large vessel occlusion, which means the thrombus is in an artery that is large enough to reach and there are no contraindications such as, a hemorrhagic stroke (bleeding in the brain), greater than six hours since onset of symptoms, or greater than 24 hours in special cases. Hospitals with comprehensive stroke centers are equipped to treat patients with endovascular care. Long-term care after an ischemic stroke is focused on rehabilitation and preventing future blood clots using anticoagulant therapy. Patients work with specialists from fields such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy to complete recovery. = Intracranial aneurysm = Although there are no clearly defined recommendations on treatment of asymptomatic aneurysms, all symptomatic unruptured brain aneurysms should be treated. Endovascular therapy is an effective treatment for select cases. During this treatment, an interventional radiologist inserts a catheter into the patient's leg and uses it to guide a coil through blood vessels to the site of the aneurysm. The coil induces clotting within the aneurysm, which reduces the risk of rupture. Multiple coils may be used depending on the size. Imaging studies (DSA, CTA, or MRA) help characterize the aneurysm to decide the best course of treatment, whether endovascular coiling or surgical clipping. Endovascular coiling is associated with a reduction in procedural morbidity and mortality over surgical. For cases of ruptured aneurysms, emergent treatment is based on the type of aneurysm, and may use a combination of techniques. Conservative therapy focuses on minimizing modifiable risk factors with blood pressure control and smoking cessation. = Cerebral arteriovenous malformation = Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are abnormal blood vessel structures in which an artery connects to a vein via an abnormal channel. This creates a high flow system that puts the vessel at risk of rupture. Ruptured AVMs require emergency management of the patient; unruptured AVMs require expert consultation to discuss the risks and benefits of treatment. Current treatment options include conservative management, surgical resection, stereotactic radiosurgery, endovascular embolization, or combinations of these treatments. Endovascular embolization is a technique used by neurointerventionalists in which particles, glue, or coils are lodged inside the AVM to prevent blood flow through the abnormal channel. During this treatment, an interventional radiologist guides a catheter through a blood vessel accessed from the patient's leg to the site of the AVM. The particles, glue, or coils induce clotting within the malformation, which reduces the risk of rupture.  Pain management  Joint and local injections = Utilizing image guidance, local anesthetics and/or long-acting steroid medications can be directly delivered to localized sites of pain. The use of image guidance helps to confirm appropriate needle placement. This includes common imaging modalities used in joint injections: ultrasound, fluoroscopy and computerized tomography (CT).  Facet joints  * Facet joints, also known as zygapophyseal joints, refer to small bony structures located between the vertebrae of the spine that promote spinal stability. * Degeneration or damage to the facet joints can often lead to facet joint syndrome, which can be both diagnosed and treated by image-guided injection of anesthetics. * Facet joint block is a minimally invasive procedure in which a physician uses fluoroscopy or CT imaging to guide the placement of an injection of medication into a facet joint to provide pain relief.  Sacroiliac joints  * The sacroiliac joint is a structure that is located at the bottom of the spine, and connects the spine to hips. The purpose of this joint is to help the spine bear the weight of the upper region of the body. The sacroiliac joint also decreases the incidence of injuries by improving overall stability and restricting the torso's range of movement. * A sacroiliac joint injection is typically performed to decrease persistent back pain that developed due to an injured or inflamed sacroiliac joint.  Epidural space  * In the spine, the epidural space is an anatomic space that is the outermost part of the spinal canal. It is the space within the canal (formed by the surrounding vertebrae) lying outside the dura mater (which encloses the arachnoid mater, subarachnoid space, the cerebrospinal fluid, and the spinal cord). * Injection of local anesthetics is often performed to treat local pain or radiculopathy, particularly due to disc herniation or central/foraminal stenosis. * Usually performed under fluoroscopic guidance.  Selective nerve root injection  * A spinal nerve root is the initial or proximal segment of one of the thirty-one pairs of spinal nerves leaving the central nervous system from the spinal cord. * Damage to nerve roots can cause paresis and paralysis of the muscle innervated by the affected spinal nerve. It can also cause pain and numbness in the corresponding dermatome. A common cause of damage to the nerve roots are lesions in the spine, such as prolapse of the nucleus pulposus, spinal tuberculosis, cancer, inflammation and spinal tabes. Root pain syndromes, known colloquially as radiculitis (i.e., sciatica) are one of the most common symptoms caused by damage to the nerve root. * Used to treat patients with radicular symptoms in the cervical, thoracic, lumbar or sacral region. * Helps to alleviate pain by dealing with inflammation of the nerve root. A very large (9cm) fibroid of the uterus causing pelvic congestion on US = Chronic pelvic pain = * Veins have one-way valves that help blood flow toward the heart. If the valves are weak or damaged, blood can pool in veins, making them swell. When this happens near the pelvis, it is called pelvic congestion syndrome, which can lead to chronic pain beneath the level of the belly button. * Pelvic congestion syndrome usually affects women who have previously been pregnant, because the ovarian veins and pelvic veins had widened to accommodate the increased blood flow from the uterus during pregnancy. After the pregnancy, some of these veins remain enlarged and fail to return to their previous size, causing them to weaken and allowing blood to pool. * An interventional radiologist can offer a minimally invasive treatment option for pelvic congestion syndrome: ovarian vein embolization * Ovarian vein embolization is a same-day treatment, which takes place in an interventional radiology suite. The interventional radiologist gains access through a large vein in the groin, called the femoral vein, by using a small catheter, which is a flexible tube like a strand of spaghetti. The catheter is moved through the vein to the enlarged pelvic veins, allowing the introduction of embolic agents, which are medications that cause the vein to seal off and relieve the painful pressure. ** This treatment can be less expensive than surgery and is much less invasive. * A number of diagnostic tests can be performed through minimally invasive methods, to determine whether a patient's chronic pelvic pain is a result of pelvic varicose veins. These tests include: ** Pelvic and Transvaginal Ultrasound ** Pelvic Venogram ** Computed Tomography (CT) ** Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) = Palliative care = * Palliative care is an interdisciplinary approach to specialized medical and nursing care for people with life-limiting illnesses. It focuses on providing relief from the symptoms, pain, physical stress, and mental stress at any stage of illness. The goal is to improve quality of life for both the person and their family. * The interventional radiologist may be uniquely skilled as hospice and palliative medicine providers. As an imager, the radiologist is the expert in obtaining maximum imaging value; furthermore, the radiologist has extensive experience in diagnostic image interpretation and disease prognostication. In addition, the interventional radiologist has an array of both therapeutic and palliative interventions to offer the patient coping with a life-threatening illness. = Nerve block/ablations = * Injection of medication or anesthetic to decrease inflammation or \\"turn off\\" a pain signal along a specific distribution of nerve. * ‚ÄúBlock‚Äù vs. Ablation‚Äù: Although these terms are often used interchangeably, they differ in terms of duration of action ** Nerve block: ‚Äútemporary disruption of the disruption of pain transmission via the celiac plexus and is accomplished by injecting corticosteroids or long- acting local anesthetics‚Äù. ** Neurolysis: ‚Äúpermanent destruction of the celiac plexus with ethanol or phenol‚Äù. * Types of blocks/neurolyses: ** Celiac plexus block/neurolysis: A procedure performed to manage refractory cancer-related abdominal pain by modulating the celiac plexus, which is a network of nerve fibers located in the retroperitoneum along the anterolateral wall of the aorta. *** Often used in the management of incurable pancreatic cancer. *** Often utilizes multidetector CT for image guidance. ** Superior hypogastric plexus block/neurolysis: A procedure performed to manage refractory abdominal/pelvis pain by modulating the superior hypogastric plexus, which is a network of nerve fibers located in the retroperitoneum that modulate pain from the bladder, vulva, vagina, uterus, urethra, penis, perineum, prostate, testes, rectum, and colon. ** Lumbar sympathetic block: A procedure performed to manage pain originating from the lower back, buttocks or legs. *** Common indications: complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)/regional sympathetic dystrophy (RDS), post-herpetic neuralgia, neuropathy. ** Pudendal nerve block: A procedure performed to manage chronic pelvic pain. *** Common indications: pudendal neuralgia (i.e., repetitive use from cycling), cancer-related pain ** Sphenopalatine ganglion block *** A procedure performed to manage head and neck pain/headaches related to the trigeminal nerve, usually in the treatment of migraine headaches. = Palliative bone/musculoskeletal = * The standard of care for local treatment of extraspinal osseous metastases is external-beam radiation therapy. Fifty percent of patients who undergo this therapy achieve complete response or resolution of symptoms. Of the remaining patients, half fail therapy (20‚Äì30% of the total), 10% require retreatment, and 1‚Äì3% experience debilitating complications such as fracture of the treated bone. * Due to the need for multiple treatments requiring multiple transports to and from the hospital and potential disruption to treatment/therapy, minimally invasive options in the treatment of extraspinal osseous metastases have emerged as attractive options in management of symptomatic metastases. These typically take the form of three types of ablative therapy: microwave thermal ablation, radiofrequency ablation (‚Äúcoblation‚Äù) and cryoablation. ** Microwave thermal ablation *** Microwave ablation is a treatment that uses heat to treat tumors. An interventional radiologist makes a tiny incision in the skin to insert a special needle into the body. Using a live computed tomography (CT) scan or an ultrasound, the doctor guides the needle to the tumor. The interventional radiologist generates electromagnetic microwaves that can destroy the tumor. *** The advantages of microwave ablation (removal of tissue) compared to radiofrequency ablation include a generation of higher temperatures and the ability to use multiple needles to better destroy larger tumors. *** After the treatment, patients follow up with their physician for several months. The treatment team also orders additional imaging scans to evaluate whether the microwave ablation successfully destroyed the tumor. ** Plasma-mediated radiofrequency ablation (‚Äúcoblation‚Äù) *** Radiofrequency ablation is a treatment that uses heat to destroy multiple small tumors. An interventional radiologist makes a tiny incision and uses either a computed tomography (CT) scan or ultrasound to guide a special needle to the site of the tumors. Next, radiofrequency (RF) electrodes are placed into the tumor. The electrodes generate an electric current (RF energy), which produces heat that destroys the tumor. This technique can be repeated at multiple sites, as necessary, before the interventional radiologist removes the RF electrode. *** After the treatment, patients follow up with their physician for several months. The treatment team orders additional imaging scans to evaluate whether the radiofrequency ablation successfully destroyed the tumor. ** Cryoablation *** Cryoablation is a treatment option that destroys cancer cells by applying extremely cold temperatures at the location of the tumor. A small cut is made in the skin and a tiny needle called a cryoprobe is inserted. Using image- guidance ‚Äì either by a computed tomography (CT) scan or by ultrasound‚Äìthe interventional radiologist maneuvers the cryoprobe toward the location of the tumor. *** Next, the cryoprobes are inserted into the tumor to begin freezing it with a gas called argon, creating an ‚Äúice ball‚Äù over the entire tumor to freeze it for about ten minutes. Nitrogen gas is then used to thaw the tumor for five minutes. This cycle is repeated two or three times depending on the tumor type and size. = Vertebral augmentation = Vertebral augmentation, which includes vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, are similar spinal procedures in which bone cement is injected through a small hole in the skin into a fractured vertebra to try to relieve back pain caused by a vertebral compression fractures. It was found ineffective in treating osteoporosis- related compression fractures of the spine. The people in both the experimental and placebo groups reported improvement in their pain, suggesting that the benefit is related to the placebo effect. , routine use is thus not recommended. = Sarcoplasty = * Sacral insufficiency fractures are an infrequent but often disabling cause of severe low back pain. At times, the pain can be so severe that it may cause the patients to become bedridden, placing them at risk for complications of immobility such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, muscle atrophy, decubitus ulcers, and bone demineralization. Until the development of the sacroplasty technique, there was no definitive treatment other than bed rest. * Sacral insufficiency fractures result from an axial loading mechanism on abnormal bone, such as osteoporosis or underlying neoplasm. * Analogous to vertebroplasty, the purpose of sacroplasty is to provide stabilization to prevent painful micromotion at the fracture site. A needle is placed through the skin and into the bone under CT guidance and a polymethylmethacrylate mixture is injected into the sacrum under real-time fluoroscopy. * Sacroplasty is a safe and effective procedure in the treatment of sacral insufficiency fractures that can provide substantial pain relief and lead to a better quality of life.  Interventional oncology  Procedures performed = * Image guided ablation: Uses different types of energy to burn (radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA)), deliver electrical fields/electroporate (irreversible electroporation(IRE)) or freeze (cryoablation) solid tumors resulting in tumor cell death. Ablation techniques can be performed throughout the body such as in the lung, liver, kidney, prostate, breast, bone, and other organs using image guidance to place a needle/probe through the skin into the target tissue. ** Radiofrequency ablation video demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Xu0mxkLSzE ** Microwave ablation video demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcU7HFumIk ** Irreversible electroporation video demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NL- IIq-c3Ic ** Cryoablation video demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goLRh3UX0vM * High Intensity Focused Ultrasound: Uses a machine that emits high frequency sound waves to kill cancer cells and provide relief for tumor-related pain, such as in the bone. * Transarterial embolization (TAE)/Bland embolization: Injection of embolic material (microparticles, alcohol, glue) through a catheter into the arteries feeding a tumor to completely occlude the tumor's blood supply and cause cell death. The most common indication is for treatment of unresectable liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma). * Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE): Injection of a chemotherapy agent often with microparticles through a catheter into arteries feeding a tumor that both delivers chemotherapy and blocks the blood supply to the tumor to cause cell deathTACE * Can be performed in different ways: ** Conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE): Injection of lipiodol with high dose chemotherapy with or without microparticles directly into the tumor-feeding arteries. ** Drug eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE): delivery of microparticles that are themselves loaded with the chemotherapy agent ‚Äì typically doxorubicin or irinotecan. * Selective internal radiation therapy (also known as SIRT or Y-90 radioembolization): Injection of small beads loaded with a radioactive isotope, Yittrium-90 (Y-90), into blood vessels feeding a tumor to deliver a lethal dose of radiation to cause cell death. Can be performed in a segmental (radiation segmentectomy) or a lobar (Radiation Lobectomy) fashion. Radiation lobectomy is commonly performed with the goal of inducing growth of the non- diseased lobe in order to have adequate liver function necessary to undergo surgical resection. ** Y-90 video demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YndyQkSZl5I * Portal vein embolization (PVE): delivery of embolic material into the portal vein feeding the lobe of liver containing the tumor(s) of interest to induce growth of the non-diseased lobe to maintain adequate liver function necessary to undergo surgical resection of lobe containing the tumor(s). = Diseases treated = Interventional oncology (IO) procedures are commonly applied to treat primary or metastatic cancer. IO treatments may be also offered in combination with surgery, systemic chemotherapy/immunotherapy, and radiation therapy to augment the therapeutic outcome. A variety of interventional oncological treatments for tumors arise: * Liver cancer: primary liver tumors such as hepatocellular carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma and liver metastases are often treated by procedures such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT/Y-90 radioembolization), portal vein embolization, transarterial/bland embolization, or image guided ablation (RFA, MWA, IRE, Cryoablation) * Lung cancer: lung metastases or inoperable primary lung cancer can be treated by interventional radiology procedures such as image guided ablation (cryoablation, microwave ablation and radiofrequency ablation). ** Cryoablation of lung cancer video demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH4po_14mDY * Kidney cancer: kidney tumors such as renal cell carcinoma can be treated with image guided ablation (RFA, MWA, cryotherapy) with similar results to partial nephrectomy. Generally, surgery via an either partial or total nephrectomy (removal of kidney) is most often curative but for patients with a smaller lesion or who are not ideal surgical candidates, radiofrequency or cryoablation ablation can be a curative option. Advantages of cryoablation include the ability to visualize the ice ball as well as use more than one probe simultaneously to create the desired ice ball shape. Benign kidney tumors such as angiomyolipomas can be treated with transarterial embolization to shrink the tumor size and reduce the risk of rupture/bleeding. Other embolizations are also performed for symptom relief or prior to surgery to reduce bleeding * Bone Cancer: bone metastases located in the spine, pelvis and long bones can be treated with image guided ablative techniques (RFA, MWA, cryoablation, electrocorporation) with or without injection of cement (cementoplasty) to stabilize the bone. These treatments may be palliatively for bone metastases pain or for some cases such as osteoid osteoma can curatively treat tumors. Embolizations are also performed for prior to surgery to reduce bleeding. * Breast Cancer: for small, solitary breast cancer image guided ablative techniques are used to treat tumors, however their efficacy versus surgical resection has not yet been studied. * Prostate Cancer: inoperable tumors can be treated with image guided ablative techniques and more recently irreversible electroporation. ** Irreversible electroporation video demonstration: https://www.mskcc.org/videos/irreversible-electroporation-nanoknife-treat- prostate-tumors * Pancreatic cancer: inoperable, or borderline resectable, locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma can be treated with irreversible electroporation Vascular disease Vascular Disease refers to disorders of the vasculature or circulatory system, most commonly involving the arteries, veins and lymphatics. The symptoms related to vascular disease can range from asymptomatic, bothersome symptoms or limb and/or life-threatening conditions. Vascular and Interventional Radiologists are at the forefront of treating a wide variety of vascular diseases. =Basics of vascular intervention= Since its development by Charles Dotter when he did a percutaneous peripheral vascular revascularization procedure for the first time on January 16, 1964 on Laura Shaw, Vascular & Interventional Radiology (commonly Interventional Radiology or IR) distinguished itself from earlier approaches to vascular disease by the use of medical imaging to guide endovascular therapies (fixing this from inside the vessel). The Seldinger technique is the basic principle that underlies endovascular procedures. Briefly, this involves using a needle to puncture a target vessel, then using a series of small medical guidewires and catheters to pass various tools inside for treatment. When these minimally-invasive techniques can be used, patients avoid the need for larger surgical exposure to treat diseased vessels. Though numerous factors can affect patient's post-operative course, in general an endovascular approach is associated with a more rapid recovery time compared to a traditional open vascular surgery. Over the past few decades, many endovascular procedures have been developed and refined. Numerous tools are at the disposal of modern Vascular and Interventional Radiologists to perform these procedures, and developing new tools is a burgeoning focus of international research. While some Interventional Radiology endovascular procedures are highly specialized, a few standard techniques apply to most: # Angiography: Sometimes referred to as traditional angiography, catheter angiography or digital subtraction angiography (DSA.) A small needle is inserted into a blood vessel, then exchanged for a catheter over a wire. The catheter is directed at the vessel to be studied, and contrast is directly injected to evaluate the lumen under video X-ray. This is an older technique than modern CT Angiography or MR Angiography, but provides unique advantages. With a catheter in place, provocative maneuvers can be performed such as breath holds or instillation of vasodilators, to evaluate a patient's blood flow dynamically. This can reproduce symptoms and identify functional abnormalities in a vessel that a static CT or MR imaging cannot. Angiography provides the basis for all endovascular therapy. #Balloon Angiography: The foundational IR procedure. Small balloons can be inflated inside a narrowed vessel to open it. These can then be safely deflated and removed. Some balloons have a specialized surface material, such as fine razor blades (‚Äúcutting balloons‚Äù) to crack the plaque or instill a coating of medicine (‚ÄúDrug-coated balloon‚Äù) that keeps the vessel open longer. #Stents and stent-grafts: Stents are used to provide a scaffold along a segment of diseased vessel. These are available in a variety of sizes to accommodate placement in vessels throughout the body from head to toe. Endografts are stents with fabric covering that are used for the treatment of bleeding or aneurysms. These devices typically come folded up very small on a scaffold, or delivery device, such as a balloon. Stents then expand into pipe- like cylinders (demonstration video) to support a vessel wall and keep the pathway for blood flow as large as possible. Some stents are bare-metal, allowing blood to leak through the walls of the stent, while others have a thin covering that keeps flow moving through only from one open end to the other. These can be used for a variety of applications depending on the vessel and the nature of the disease. Sometimes multiple stents are deployed end-to- end or side by side to maintain laminar flow. Like balloons, some stents come coated with medicine to help prevent the treated vessel from closing again. #Embolization: The goal of embolization is to decrease or stop flow only in a target vessel, while avoiding cutting off the flow to nearby non-target vessels. This can be performed to stop active bleeding (as in trauma) to limit anticipated blood loss (such as in a complex surgery,) or to cut off blood supply to either an abnormal vessel (e.g.,aneurysm) or abnormal structure (e.g., tumor.) There are many embolic agents available, from metallic plugs and coils to various biologically compatible particles and glues. Further information about these embolic agents can be found here. Depending on the clinical situation, embolization can be temporary or permanent. #Thrombolysis and Thrombectomy: The body forms blood clots as a natural protective mechanism against bleeding. However, when arising outside this context, blood clots can wreak havoc in the human body including disabling strokes. Thrombolysis is the process of breaking down blood clots, by injecting them with powerful medications. Thrombectomy (demonstration video) involves using a device to remove the clot directly. The goal of endovascular therapy is to revascularize an affected or diseased vessel. =Arterial disease= Arteries are the component of the circulatory system that carry oxygenated blood away from the heart to the vital organs and extremities. Arteries have relatively thick, muscular walls, composed of multiple layers, because they transport freshly oxygenated blood through the body at relatively high pressures. Arterial diseases can affect one or multiple layers of the artery wall. The aorta is the largest artery in the body, and the major aortic branches continue to divide multiple times, giving way to smaller arteries, muscular arterioles and thin-walled capillaries. In contrast to arteries, capillaries have thin single-layered walls, so oxygen and nutrients can be exchanged with tissues in capillary beds before the de-oxygenated blood is carried away by the venous system. Perfusion refers to the flow of oxygen and nutrient rich blood into the capillary beds of the muscles and organs, this is critical for their function. The lack of adequate perfusion is referred to as ischemia and is typically the cause of symptoms related to vascular disease. The goal of revascularization therapies, whether endovascular or surgical, is to re- establish or optimize perfusion and stop ischemia. Atherosclerosis refers to a progressive narrowing of the arteries due to atheroma, derived from the Greek word for gruel or porridge. Atheromatous plaque is a mixture of fat and inflammatory debris that sticks to the inner walls of an artery. Plaque can be soft or become firm as it accrues layers of calcium, a byproduct of chronic inflammation. Atherosclerosis has no single cause but many recognized risk factors. Some risk factors are modifiable, and others are not. Age and genetic predispositions are an example of non-modifiable risk factors. Medical management of atherosclerosis aims to address the many other known modifiable risk factors, such as smoking, diet, exercise as well as blood sugar levels in patients with diabetes. Using medications to control blood pressure and cholesterol have also been shown beneficial. Atherosclerosis is described, evaluated, and treated differently depending on the affected artery, as described below. However, multiple studies have shown strong correlations between the different types of atherosclerosis. In particular, patients with Peripheral Arterial Disease have an increased risk of Coronary Artery Disease, and severe Peripheral Artery Disease symptoms can be a predictor of cardiac related mortality. The majority of patients begin to develop symptoms from ischemia around middle age, even though vessel narrowing can develop silently and slowly over decades. Unfortunately, sudden cardiac death or stroke can be a patient's first sign of vascular disease. Therefore, controlling risk factors is crucial in those with known atherosclerosis to prevent progression of disease, and screening is recommended by some Vascular Disease Specialists for those at increased risk, such as those with diabetes, smoking or a strong family history of cardiovascular disease. Screening tests typically use the non invasive evaluation called the Ankle-Brachial Index, which compares the blood pressure between the arm and the ankle. This can help detect narrowing in the major vessels of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and legs. CT scans of the heart with evaluations of coronary artery calcium are also used in some instances to stratify risk of coronary artery disease. Historically, open vascular surgical approaches were required for all critically advanced atherosclerotic disease. An endarterectomy is a large operation, where blood flow is temporarily stopped using clamps, the vessel is cut open, the plaque removed and then the vessel resealed. If an occlusion is too dense or complex, a bypass could also be performed, where two segments of vessel are bridged by an additional vein or synthetic graft. Modern endovascular approaches to treating atherosclerosis can include combinations of angioplasty, stenting, and atherectomy (removal of plaque). # Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD, sometimes PVD or ‚ÄúPeripheral Vascular Disease‚Äù) is most often a result of atherosclerosis and affects the arteries of the lower extremities, those below the aortic bifurcation. A hallmark symptom is claudication, or progressive pain in a limb associated with activity, due to ischemia. As the perfusion to a limb diminishes further pain in the foot can occur even at rest and in fact the tissues of the foot can even die. There are several systems for staging PAD, but an often used scale is the revised Rutherford Classification. Plaque and blood flow can be evaluated using ultrasound, CT Angiography, MR angiography and catheter based angiography to establish anatomic segments of disease. The severity of ischemia can be evaluated by correlating symptoms and non-invasive physiologic vascular studies including toe pressures, TCPO2, and skin perfusion studies. Certain monitored exercises, such as walking regimens, have been shown to significantly improve walking distance especially when used consistently for at least 6 months. When medical management fails, Vascular Interventional Radiologists can attempt to restore blood flow to extremities using angioplasty and stenting. Sometimes repeat interventions are required. The goal of therapy is to maintain perfusion, avoid amputation and preserve the limb structure and function. # Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)is a severe variant of PAD (Rutherford 4 and above) characterized by rest pain or tissue loss. Each year this affects just under 1% of the population, but develops in approximately 11% of PAD patients. Symptoms develop due to chronic ischemia from vessel plaque burden, which builds up over time. Rest pain is a continuous burning pain in the limb that is aggravated by elevating it and improved by dangling over the bed as the perfusion is so poor that it becomes gravity dependent. Tissue loss refers to arterial insufficiency ulcers, which can progress to frank gangrene. Arterial ulcers are classically painful and located on the distal aspect of the extremities. A diagnosis of CLI incurs a higher risk of amputation (up to 25% within 1 year) and death (up to 25% within 1 year.) This is a serious condition that requires multi-modality treatment. The goal of Vascular Interventional Radiology and others who work in Limb Salvage is to minimize tissue loss by preserving direct blood flow to the affected limb by treating vessel blockages, controlling any infection and optimizing wound care. Increasingly, this can be accomplished with primary endovascular therapies before open surgery is considered. # Acute Limb Ischemia (ALI)results when blood flow to an extremity is abruptly cut off. It occurs most commonly in those with a history of atrial fibrillation or underlying PAD/PVD. Unlike chronic ischemia, which the body can partially adapt to, ALI is an emergency that can result in an amputation or even death if not treated in hours. It is typically due to an embolus from the heart or a thrombus that develops in a pre-existing area of narrowed artery. Once diagnosed clinically, CT or MR Angiography may be used to evaluate the cause and extent of disease. Vascular Interventional Radiologists may use thrombectomy devices or clot dissolving medications to remove or dissolve the clot. Surgical options include open thrombectomy and even vascular bypass. # Carotid Atherosclerosis involves the major branch arteries that provide blood to the brain. Carotid artery disease incurs an increased risk of stroke by two different mechanisms, either from limiting overall blood flow or more often by showering pieces of plaque or clot deep into the small vessels in the brain. Either can result in degrees of cerebral ischemia. Carotid artery disease can be typically addressed with open surgical techniques (carotid endarterectomy) or though endovascular stenting. # Chronic mesenteric ischemia can produce severe pain with eating and result in food fear and weight loss. These vascular disorders can be repaired by endovascular approaches using angioplasty and stenting. # Renal arterial ischemia can contribute to hypertension, which can be severe and refractory to medical therapy. # Coronary Artery Disease involves the arteries supplying blood to heart muscle. Coronary ischemia results in myocardial infarction, also known as a heart attack. The coronary arteries were one of the earliest widely accepted applications of angioplasty and stenting developed by cardiology and interventional radiology. # Aortoiliac Occlusive Disease (Leriche Syndrome) is a constellation of symptoms due to significant occlusion of the distal aorta and common iliac arteries, most commonly by atherosclerotic disease The classic symptoms include buttock claudication and erectile dysfunction, with decreased femoral pulses. Additional symptoms of Critical Limb Ischemia can be present. Both surgical and endovascular approaches to revascularization can be considered. Aneurysm refers to pathologic dilation of an artery to greater than 1.5 times its normal size. True vascular aneurysms are due to degenerative processes in the wall of the artery. Aneurysms can be solitary or multiple and are sometimes found in association with various clinical syndromes, including forms of vasculitis or connective tissue diseases. Aneurysms are typically classified by major shapes, either fusiform (tubular) or saccular (eccentric). Ectasia is another broad term for an enlarged vessel, but is not necessarily pathological. Rupture is a dreaded complication of aneurysms that can lead to extensive, difficult to control bleeding. Aneurysms can also clot, or thrombose, and rapidly occlude the involved vessel, leading to acute distal ischemia. # Aortic Aneurysms include thoracic, abdominal or thoracoabdominal. Treatment strategies are customized depending on the location, size, rate of growth and extent of the aneurysm as well as the medical comorbidities of the patient. For example, an intact, small but slowly growing aneurysm may be safely monitored with serial imaging for months or years before elective repair is considered. Elective endovascular aortic grafting is now routinely attempted when possible. Endovascular Aortic Repair (EVAR) refers to treatment of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, while Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair (TEVAR) is performed on the thoracic aorta. A ruptured aneurysm may be taken emergently for open, endovascular or combination repair. A variety of endovascular grafts are available, and each has advantages and disadvantages depending on the characteristics of the aneurysm and patient (RFS EVAR/TEVAR webinar: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjRClHP1dEc) # Aneurysms refers to aneurysms in the arms and legs. These can typically be evaluated and monitored with vascular ultrasound, CT angiography and MR angiography. Popliteal aneurysms are associated with distal embolization and are also associated with concurrent contralateral popliteal artery aneurysms and abdominal aortic aneurysms. When amenable, endovascular treatments for popliteal aneurysms can include endovascular stenting or surgical bypass. # Visceral Aneurysm affect the vessels that supply the solid organs. Similar to other aneurysms, treatment depends on several factors including size, location, shape and growth. Endovascular treatments for visceral aneurysms can usually be performed with less morbidity when compared to open surgical techniques. # Intracranial Aneurysms arise in the arterial supply of the brain. Endovascular approaches to treatment include stenting and coiling and are preferable in most cases since clipping and resection require a surgical craniotomy. Rupture of intracranial aneurysms can have devastating clinical effects. For further discussion, refer to the Neuro-Interventional Radiology Section. # Pseudoaneurysm is when there is not all 3 layers surrounding the artery. These structures can technically be considered a type of contained bleed. They are most often due to focal damage to a blood vessel, which could be the result of trauma, infection or inflammation. Splenic artery pseudoaneurysms, for example, may develop as a result of pancreatitis. In some cases, pseudoaneurysms of the femoral and radial arterials can be a complication of arterial access for endovascular procedures. Depending on the size and location of the pseudoaneurysm, it may be treatable with minimally-invasive Interventional Radiology methods, though some particularly the infected ones may require open surgery. Dissection refers to a tear in the inner layer of the arterial wall. Blood pumps into this defect and dissects its way between the layers in the wall of an artery, creating a false channel separate from the true arterial lumen. Dissections can develop due to trauma, spontaneously due to high blood pressure and native vascular disease, or in some cases as a complication of prior surgical or endovascular treatment. When an arterial dissection expands, it can restrict normal flow through the affected artery or potentially block the origin of a branch vessel- this can compromise distal perfusion in either case. When acute and symptomatic, this is an emergency that requires prompt treatment. However, as medical imaging has improved, chronic, asymptomatic dissections have also been discovered, and in some cases these may be safely managed with blood pressure control, follow-up imaging and proper counseling for the warning signs of potential ischemia. Dissections can occur in any artery and are named for their vessel of origin. Aortic dissections can be further classified and treated depending on whether they involve the thoracic aorta, the abdominal aorta or both. Classic pain related to acute aortic dissections is described as ‚Äútearing‚Äù or ‚Äúripping‚Äù and possibly radiating to a patient's back. Acute aortic dissection can be difficult to diagnose but is more common than aortic aneurysm rupture. Thoracic aortic dissections are further characterized with the Stanford classification. Type A dissections involve the root and ascending aorta. These require prompt treatment, which currently is mostly surgical in nature. Type B dissections begin in the distal aortic arch beyond the left subclavian artery origin, and may often be addressed with pain medication and blood pressure control. If the type B aortic dissection results in poor circulation to the intestines, kidneys or legs it often requires urgent endovascular repair with endografts and/or fenestrations. If a type B aortic dissection has ruptured, or has features that indicate impending rupture, they are urgently repaired too. Takayasu Arteritis Angiography Dissections can also arise in virtually any other artery. Carotid artery Dissection, for example, places patients at increased risk for stroke and may extend further into the blood vessels within the brain. Vertebral Artery Dissection are less common but also dangerous for similar reasons. Mesenteric Artery Dissection may limit the blood supply to the intestines. Renal Artery Dissections can decrease blood flow to the kidneys and contribute to hypertension. Peripheral Arterial Dissections can be found elsewhere in the arms and legs. These dissections can occur primarily due to focal traumas, underlying vascular disease, or as an extension of a larger, complex aortic dissection that tears further into these smaller branches. Treatment of dissections depends on several factors, including the location, extent, how long it has been developing (acute or chronic) and whether it is limiting perfusion. Surgical approaches to dissections can include reconstructing the aorta, surgical bypass and surgical fenestration. Like other arterial disorders, endovascular approaches to dissection such as stent-grafting and percutaneous fenestration can be utilized- either primarily or in combination with surgery depending on the complexity of the dissection. Penetrating Aortic Ulcer (PAU)is an advanced focal form atherosclerosis, most often encountered in the aorta. It starts as a small plaque in the inner-most layer of the aorta called the intima, but the inflammatory process ulcerates and penetrates through this layer into the media. While PAU is considered a distinct entity, many think this is a precursor lesion to dissection or aneurysm. Along with Intramural Hematoma, Aneurysm and Dissection, PAU is recognized as one of several Acute Aortic Syndromes‚Äîa spectrum of related conditions correlated to potential aortic rupture. They thus have a high potential morbidity and mortality, and should at least be followed closely. Acute or Active Bleeding can occur throughout the human body due to a variety of causes. Interventional Radiologists can address bleeding with embolization, usually with small plastic particles, glues or coils. Traumatic rupture of a blood vessel, for example, may be addressed this way if a patient is at risk of fatal bleeding. This has revolutionized medicine and interventional radiologists commonly treat refractory nose bleeds, excessive coughing of blood, intestinal bleeding, post-pregnancy bleeding, spontaneous intra- abdominal on intra-thoracic bleeding, bleeding related to trauma and post- surgical bleeding. In some instances where severe bleeding is anticipated, such as in complex surgery or the excision of a highly vascular tumor, Interventional Radiologists may embolize certain target blood vessels prior to the operation to prevent major blood loss. Transplant Organs rely on healthy blood supply to survive. In some instances, the arteries that feed a transplant may narrow, typically where the donor vessel is sewn to the recipient. Interventional Radiologists evaluate the blood supply of these patient's and may use balloons or stents to open narrowed vessels and keep the transplant organ functional. =Venous disease= The veins of the human body are responsible for returning de-oxygenated blood back to the heart. Like a rock rolling down a hill, blood flows from the highest pressure (the blood in the aorta) to the lower venous pressure (the blood in the vena cava as it empties back to the heart.) Unlike arteries, veins are thin walled and distensible, allowing them to accommodate large volumes of blood without significant changes in pressure. In fact, the venous system is so low pressure that veins have valves to keep blood from flowing backward. The motion of the human body helps pump blood through the veins- squeezing leg muscles while walking, for instance, helps push venous blood back up to the heart against the pull of gravity. Unfortunately, without this extra push some blood can sit stagnant in veins, leading to a multitude of clinical problems. The largest vein in the body is the vena cava. The superior vena cava (SVC) drains blood from the top half of the body while the inferior vena cava (IVC) drains blood from below the diaphragm. Elsewhere in the body, veins can be categorized into superficial, primarily associated with the skin and soft tissues, or deep veins, which drain muscles and organs. =Venous access= Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD or Chronic Renal Disease) is a condition in which there is a progressive loss of kidney function. It has numerous recognized causes and risk factors. CKD affects approximately 14% of the world population, and over 600,000 people in the United States alone. There are five recognized stages of CKD, the fifth stage is also called End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and invariably requires some form of renal replacement therapy. Around the turn of the 20th century, breakthroughs in our understanding of renal physiology led many to believe that dialysis using artificial kidneys was a potential cure for renal disease. Over 100 years later, the only available curative, renal replacement therapy for CKD is kidney transplantation. However, many patients can live for decades utilizing dialysis. Dialyzer technology initially outpaced the ability of clinicians to apply it to patients. In the 1920s, the first dialysis catheter was created using thin fragile glass tubes. Early methods required surgical incision to reach large vessels, which carried a large risk of major bleeding. The first somewhat permanent, reliable dialysis access, the Scribner Teflon Shunt, was invented nearly 40 years later and allowed a patient with kidney failure to survive 11 more years. As medicine and surgery have grown more sophisticated, more patients now live with chronic renal disease than ever before. The most common type of dialysis in the United States is hemodialysis, which can be performed through several types of vascular access. The Arteriovenous Fistula (AVF) is the preferred method. [Arteriovenous Fistula] (AVF) are created surgically by directly connecting an artery and a vein, most commonly in the arm. An Arteriovenous Graft (AVG) relies on the same principle but bridges the gap between the artery and vein with a medical-grade prosthetic shunt. Over time, altered flow mechanics can result in changes within the involved vessels. Vascular narrowing, thrombosis, aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms are commonly encountered complications over the life of an AVF or AVG. Interventional radiologists can use angiography to evaluate these structures (commonly called a Fistulogram) and treat dysfunctional access with angioplasty, stenting, and thrombectomy. Most patients require regular evaluation and treatment to keep their access working. When possible, AVFs are preferred to AVGs due to their relatively lower complication rate and longer patency. The Fistula First initiative works to promote physician and patient awareness about the benefits of first attempting hemodialysis through a fistula. There are a few devices (endo AVF) that are being utilized by interventional radiologists to percutaneously create fistulas in a minimally invasive fashion. Venous Access Port Catheter Dialysis Catheters include temporary and tunneled large-bore central venous access lines placed for administering hemodialysis. When possible, these catheters are placed in the right internal jugular vein, but the left internal jugular and femoral veins may also be utilized. Temporary dialysis lines may be placed when patients are hospitalized and either too sick or at a high risk of bleeding. Permanent hemodialysis catheters are longer overall but a segment is tunneled through the skin of the chest, which lets the catheter lie flat and lowers the risk of infection. Central Venous Access refers to a variety of intravenous catheters placed in patients requiring certain long-term medications. These are much smaller in diameter than dialysis lines, but are larger and longer than a standard intravenous line (IV.) Examples include Hickman Catheters, Peripherally Inserted Central Cathethers (or PICCs), Tunneled small bore central venous catheters and Mediports. These lines differ in where they are inserted but are all placed under imaging guidance and adjusted so the end of the catheter sits in the vena cava adjacent to the heart. These catheter are designed to deliver strong medications, such as chemotherapy or prolonged courses of antibiotics, which are either dosed too frequently to keep placing new IVs or too irritating to small veins be injected through a standard IV.

The word is often used figuratively in colloquial British English and Hiberno-English as a noun to mean \\"nonsense\\", an expletive following a minor accident or misfortune, or an adjective to mean \\"poor quality\\" or \\"useless\\". Similarly, common phrases like \\"Bollocks to this!\\" and \\"That's a load of old bollocks\\" generally indicate contempt for a certain task, subject or opinion. Conversely, the word also figures in idiomatic phrases such as \\"the dog's bollocks\\" or more simply \\"the bollocks\\" (as opposed to just \\"bollocks\\"), which will refer to something which is admired, approved of or well-respected. Etymology The word has a long history, with the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) giving examples of its usage dating back to the 13th century. One of the early references is Wycliffe's Bible (1382), Leviticus xxii, 24: \\"Al beeste, that ... kitt and taken awey the ballokes is, ye shulen not offre to the Lord ...\\" (any beast that is cut and taken away the bollocks, you shall not offer to the Lord, i.e. castrated animals are not suitable as sacrifices). The OED states (with abbreviations expanded): \\"Probably a derivative of Teutonic ball-, of which the Old English representative would be inferred as beall-u, -a, or -e\\". The Teutonic ball- in turn probably derives from the Proto-Indo- European base *bhel-, to inflate or swell. This base also forms the root of many other words, including \\"phallus\\". Meaning \\"nonsense\\" From the 17th to the 19th century, bollocks or ballocks was allegedly used as a slang term for a clergyman, although this meaning is not mentioned by the OED's 1989 edition. For example, in 1684, the Commanding Officer of the Straits Fleet regularly referred to his chaplain as \\"Ballocks\\". It has been suggested that bollocks came to have its modern meaning of \\"nonsense\\" because some clergymen were notorious for talking nonsense during their sermons.According to Merriam Webster the term has been used before the 12th century. Severity Originally, the word \\"bollocks\\" was the everyday vernacular word for testicles‚Äîas noted above, it was used in this sense in the first English- language Bible, in the 14th century. By the mid-17th century, at least, it had begun to acquire coarse figurative meanings (see section on \\"bollocking\\"), for example in a translation of works by Rabelais. It did not appear in Samuel Johnson's 1755 dictionary of the English language.*Downloadable copy of Johnson's Dictionary, 6th Edition, Volume 1 and Volume 2 at the Internet Archive It was also omitted from the 1933 Oxford English Dictionary and its 1941 reprint, finally appearing in the 1972 supplement.Melvin J. Lasky: The language of journalism: Profanity, obscenity and the media, Aldine Transaction, 2007. , . p.134 The first modern English dictionary to include an entry for \\"bollocks\\" was G. N. Garmonsway's Penguin English Dictionary of 1965. The relative severity of the various profanities, as perceived by the British public, was studied on behalf of the Broadcasting Standards Commission, Independent Television Commission, BBC and Advertising Standards Authority. The results of this jointly commissioned research were published in December 2000 in a paper called \\"Delete Expletives?\\".ASA Reports and Surveys , Delete Expletives paper. Retrieved 19 March 2010. This placed \\"bollocks\\" in eighth position in terms of its perceived severity, between \\"prick\\" (seventh place) and \\"arsehole\\" (ninth place).Delete Expletives, p.9 By comparison, the word \\"balls\\" (which has some similar meanings) was down in 22nd place. Of the people surveyed, 25% thought that \\"bollocks\\" should not be broadcast at all, and only 11% thought that it could acceptably be broadcast at times before the national 9 pm \\"watershed\\" on television (radio does not have a watershed).Delete Expletives, p.28 25% of the people regarded \\"bollocks\\" as \\"very severe\\", 32% \\"quite severe\\", 34% \\"mild\\" and 8% considered it \\"not swearing\\".Delete Expletives, p.12 A survey of the language of London teenagers (published in 2002) examined, amongst other things, the incidence of various swearwords in their speech.

There is a whole parodic book entitled The Little Book of Management Bollocks.Alistair Beaton 2001 When a great deal of bollocks is being spoken, it may be said that the 'bollocks quotient' is high.John Pilger, 'The politics of bollocks', New Statesman 5 February 2009 A \\"bollocks\\" (singular noun) Comparable to cock-up, screw-up, balls-up, etc. Used with the indefinite article, it means a disaster, a mess or a failure. It is often used pejoratively, as in to have \\"made a bollocks out of it\\",Henry Friedman, Sander Meredeen, The dynamics of industrial conflict: lessons from Ford, Taylor & Francis, 1980, , 9780709903741, p.104: \\"Birch had admitted to Rees that the Union had 'made a bollocks of it' by confusing the grading and equal pay issues in court.\\" and it is generally used throughout Britain and Ireland. Bollocks up (transitive verb) To bollocks something up means \\"to mess something up\\". It refers to a botched job: \\"Well, you bollocksed it up that time, Your Majesty!\\" or \\"Bollocksed up at work again, I fear. Millions down the drain\\". To \\"drop a bollock\\" To \\"drop a bollock\\" describes the malfunction of an operation, or messing something up, as in many sports, and in more polite business parlance, dropping the ball brings play to an unscheduled halt. \\"Guy Ritchie ... was about to drop a bollock from a mile high.

Actively, one gives or delivers a bollocking to someone; in the building trade one can 'throw a right bollocking into' someone. The Oxford English Dictionary gives the earliest meaning as \\"to slander or defame\\" and suggests that it entered the English language from the 1653 translation of one of Rabelais' works, which includes the Middle French expression \\"en couilletant\\", translated as \\"ballocking\\".

An example of this usage is: \\"Before Tony Blair's speech, a chap near me growled: 'He thinks he's the dog's bollocks.' Well, he's entitled to. It was a commanding speech: a real dog's bollocks of an oration.\\" Although this is a recent term (the Online Etymology Dictionary dates it to 1989), its origins are obscure. Etymologist Eric Partridge and the Oxford English Dictionary believe the term comes from the now obsolete typographical sequence of a colon and a dash. This typography, using a dash following a colon, was used to introduce a list. Thus, it is a very early example of an emoticon. The Oxford English Dictionary says the following mark (\\":‚Äî \\") is entitled \\"the dog‚Äôs bollocks\\", defined as: \\"typogr. a colon followed by a dash, regarded as forming a shape resembling the male sexual organs.\\" The usage is cited to the year 1949. This phrase has found its way into popular culture in a number of ways. There is a beer brewed in England by the Wychwood Brewery called the \\"Dog's Bollocks\\", as well as a lager cocktail. \\"Chuffed to one's bollocks\\" The phrase \\"chuffed to one's bollocks\\" describes someone who is very pleased with themselves. Nobel laureate Harold Pinter used this in The Homecoming\\"He'll be chuffed to his bollocks in the morning when he sees his eldest son\\". The phrase provided a serious challenge to translators of his work. Pinter used a similar phrase in an open letter, published in The Guardian, and addressed to Prime Minister Tony Blair, attacking his co-operation with American foreign policy. The letter ends by saying \\"Oh, by the way, meant to mention, forgot to tell you, we were all chuffed to the bollocks when Labour won the election.\\" Other uses * \\"Bollock-head\\" is a vulgar British term for a shaven head.\\"My baldy chum wasn't smiling now...This bollock-head was obviously an amateur, a cowboy\\". It can also refer to someone who is stupid, as can \\"bollock-brain\\". The Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue (1811) cites the expression \\"His brains are in his ballocks\\", to designate a fool. Rhyming slang The rhyming slang for bollocks is \\"Jackson Pollocks\\".Eric Partridge, Tom Dalzell, Terry Victor, The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English, Taylor & Francis, 2006, , 9780415259385. p.1082 It can be shortened to Jacksons, as in \\"Modern art? Pile o' Jacksons if you ask me!\\". Sandra Bullocks is occasionally used to approximate rhyming slang; it does not quite rhyme, but preserves meter and rhythm. The Beautiful South bowdlerised their original line \\"sweaty bollocks\\" as \\"Sandra Bullocks\\", as one of several changes to make their song \\"Don't Marry Her\\" acceptable for mainstream radio play. =\\"Horlicks\\"= The term \\"Horlicks\\" was brought to prominence in July 2003, when then-British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw used it to describe irregularities in the preparation and provenance of the \\"dodgy dossier\\" regarding weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Straw used the expression \\"a complete Horlicks\\", instead of the more impolite \\"make a complete bollocks of something\\". This euphemism stems from an advertising campaign for the Horlicks malt drink, where people were seen to be shouting \\"Horlicks!\\" in a loud voice, to give vent to stress or frustration. Eric Morecambe was also known to cough \\"Horlicks!\\" behind his hand on The Morecambe and Wise Show. =Rowlocks/rowlocking= Rollocking is sometimes used as a euphemism for \\"bollocking\\". A rollocking bollocking may be delivered by an electorate.Polly Toynbee, \\"Only Alan Johnson can prevent catastrophe\\", The Guardian, 15 May 2009. Bollards The 2007 Concise new Partridge dictionary of slang and unconventional English quotes \\"bollards\\" as meaning \\"testicles\\" and that it is a play on the word bollocks.Tom Dalzell, Terry Victor: The concise new Partridge dictionary of slang and unconventional English, Routledge, 2007. , . p.76 Literature The play Sodom, or the Quintessence of Debauchery, published in 1684 and ascribed to John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, includes a character named Bolloxinion, King of Sodom (along with other characters with names such as General Buggeranthos and the maid of honour, Fuckadilla).

His body wasn't found until 1932, when a field was being ploughed, and the body was identified by its tags.Paul Ricoeur - La critique et la conviction: entretien avec Fran√ßois Azouvi et Marc de Launay (Paris: Calmann-L√©vy, 1995), p. 11\\"On an Impact of WWI\\" - by Cherine Marie Veronique Munkholt (blog entry dated April 16, 2016) Some writers have stated that before World War I began, Paul's father (L√©on \\"Jules\\" Ric≈ìur) was a professor of English at the Lyc√©e Emile Loubet in Valence. However, it was a different person ‚Äî Jules Paul Ric≈ìur (1887‚Äì1918) ‚Äî who held that position.Jules Paul Ricoeur (April 28, 1887 - November 7, 1918) was a son of Paul Lucien Auguste Ricoeur (a.k.a. Paul Lucien Augustin Ricoeur) and Elisabeth \\"Mina\\" Elzer, who were married on 4 December 1886 in Poussay. Jules was born in Montb√©liard, Doubs, and died from gas poisoning in World War I at Baccarat, Meurthe-en- Moselle. He was a Private in the 356th Infantry Regiment (2nd Class) of the French army. Before fighting in World War I he was a professor of English in the Lyc√©e Emile Loubet in Valence. He had a brother named Louis Charles Adrien Ricoeur (1 October 1889 ‚Äì 20 August 1914) who was born in √âpinal, Vosges. Louis was a Private in the 153rd Infantry Regiment of the French army. He was killed in WWI in 1914 at Morhange, Moselle.\\"La Guerre et le lyc√©e Loubet\\" (The War and Lyc√©e Loubet) - These are photos of commemorative plaques in the entrance hall of the Lyc√©e Emile Loubet in Valence.

Paul, whose penchant for study was fueled by his family's Protestant emphasis on Bible study, was bookish and intellectually precocious. He discovered philosophy while attending the Lyc√©e de Rennes (now ), where he studied under Roland Dalbiez (1893‚Äì1976), who was professor of philosophy at the lyc√©e.Marcelino Ag√≠s Villaverde, Knowledge and Practical Reason: Paul Ricoeur's Way of Thinking, LIT Verlag M√ºnster, 2012, p. 18. Ric≈ìur received his bachelor's degree in 1932 from the University of Rennes and began studying philosophy, and especially phenomenology, at the Sorbonne in 1933‚Äì34, where he was influenced by Gabriel Marcel.Micha√´l F≈ìssel and Fabien Lamouche, Paul Ric≈ìur. Anthologie (Paris, √âditions Points, 2007), p. 417. In 1934 he completed a DES thesis (', roughly equivalent to an M.A. thesis) titled Probl√®me de Dieu chez Lachelier et Lagneau (The Problem of God in Lachelier and Lagneau),Alan D. Schrift (2006), Twentieth-Century French Philosophy: Key Themes And Thinkers, Blackwell Publishing, p. 172. concerning some of the theological views of French philosophers Jules Lachelier (1832‚Äì1918) and Jules Lagneau (1851‚Äì1894). In 1935, Paul was awarded the second-highest agr√©gation mark in the nation for philosophy, presaging a bright future. On 14 August 1935, in Rennes, Paul married Simone Lejas (23 October 1911 ‚Äì 7 January 1998),Genealogy of the Ricoeur and Lejas families\\"Paul Ricoeur, un philosophe protestant\\" with whom he had five children: Jean-Paul (born 15 January 1937), Marc (born 22 February 1938), No√´lle (born 30 November 1940), Olivier (10 July 1947 ‚Äì 22 March 1986), and Etienne (born 1953).Charles E. Reagan, Paul Ricoeur: His Life and His Work (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996), pages 6, 8, 15, and 20. In 1936‚Äì37, he fulfilled his military service. World War II interrupted Ric≈ìur's career, and he was drafted to serve in the French army in 1939. His unit was captured during the German invasion of France in 1940 and he spent the next five years as a prisoner of war in Oflag II-D. His detention camp was filled with other intellectuals such as Mikel Dufrenne, who organized readings and classes sufficiently rigorous that the camp was accredited as a degree- granting institution by the Vichy government. During that time he read Karl Jaspers, who was to have a great influence on him. He also began a translation of Edmund Husserl's Ideas I. 1946‚Äì2005: Strasbourg University to death Ric≈ìur taught at the University of Strasbourg between 1948 and 1956, the only French university with a Protestant faculty of theology. In 1950, he received his State doctorate, submitting (as is customary in France) two theses: a \\"minor\\" thesis translating Husserl's Ideas I into French for the first time, with commentary, and a \\"major\\" thesis that he published the same year as Philosophie de la Volont√© I: Le Volontaire et l'Involontaire (Philosophy of the Will I: The Voluntary and the Involuntary).A second volume under the title Philosophie de la Volont√© II: L'homme faillible et La symbolique du mal (Philosophy of the Will II: Fallible Man and The Symbolism of Evil) appeared in 1960. Ric≈ìur soon acquired a reputation as an expert on phenomenology, then the ascendent philosophy in France. In 1956, Ric≈ìur took up a position at the Sorbonne as the Chair of General Philosophy. This appointment signaled Ric≈ìur's emergence as one of France's most prominent philosophers. While at the Sorbonne, he wrote three works that cemented his reputation: Fallible Man and The Symbolism of Evil published in 1960, and Freud and Philosophy: An Essay on Interpretation published in 1965. Jacques Derrida was an assistant to Ric≈ìur during that time (early 1960s).Geoffrey Bennington (1991), Jacques Derrida, University of Chicago Press, p. 330. From 1965 to 1970, Ric≈ìur was an administrator at the newly founded University of Nanterre in suburban Paris.During that time, Ric≈ìur was Cornelius Castoriadis' long-distance doctoral advisor (Dosse 2014, p. 264). Nanterre was intended as an experiment in progressive education, and Ric≈ìur hoped that he could create a university in accordance with his vision, free of the stifling atmosphere of the tradition-bound Sorbonne and its overcrowded classes. Nevertheless, Nanterre became a hotbed of protest during the student uprisings of May 1968 in France. Ric≈ìur was derided as an \\"old clown\\" (vieux clown) and tool of the French government.Reagan 1996, p. 69. Disenchanted with French academic life, Ric≈ìur taught briefly at the Universit√© catholique de Louvain in Belgium, before taking a position at the Divinity School of the University of Chicago,Dosse 1997, p. 529. where he taught from 1970 to 1985. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1971. His study culminated in The Rule of Metaphor: Multi-Disciplinary Studies of the Creation of Meaning in Language published in 1975 and the three-volume Time and Narrative published in 1983, 1984, 1985 Ric≈ìur gave the Gifford Lectures in 1985/86, published in 1990 as Oneself as Another. This work built on his discussion of narrative identity and his continuing interest in the self. Time and Narrative secured Ric≈ìur's return to France in 1985 as a notable intellectual. His late work was characterised by a continuing cross-cutting of national intellectual traditions; for example, some of his latest writing engaged the thought of the American political philosopher John Rawls. In 1995 he received an honorary doctorate from the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. In 1999, he was awarded the Balzan Prize for Philosophy, the citation being \\"[f]or his capacity in bringing together all the most important themes and indications of 20th-century philosophy, and re-elaborating them into an original synthesis which turns language ‚Äì in particular, that which is poetic and metaphoric ‚Äì into a chosen place revealing a reality that we cannot manipulate, but interpret in diverse ways, and yet all coherent. Through the use of metaphor, language draws upon that truth which makes of us that what we are, deep in the profundity of our own essence\\".Balzan.org That same year, he and his co-author Andr√© LaCocque (professor emeritus of Hebrew Bible at Chicago Theological Seminary) were awarded the Gordon J. Laing Award by the University of Chicago's Board of University Publications for their book Thinking Biblically: Exegetical and Hermeneutical Studies. On 29 November 2004, he was awarded with the second John W. Kluge Prize for Lifetime Achievement in the Human Sciences (shared with Jaroslav Pelikan). Ric≈ìur died on 20 May 2005, aged 92, at his home in Ch√¢tenay-Malabry, France, of natural causes.University of Chicago News Office, University of Chicago philosopher Paul Ricoeur, 1913-2005 French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin declared that \\"the humanist European tradition is in mourning for one of its most talented exponents\\". Paul Ric≈ìur was buried in the Ch√¢tenay-Malabry New Cemetery, Ch√¢tenay-Malabry, Department des Hauts-de-Seine, √éle-de-France, France. Thought=Hermeneutic phenomenology One of Ric≈ìur's major contributions to the field of hermeneutics was the entwining of hermeneutical processes with phenomenology. In this union, Ric≈ìur applies the hermeneutical task to more than just textual analysis, but also to how each self relates to anything that is outside of the self. For Ric≈ìur, hermeneutics is understanding the link between the self and the symbol‚Äîneither things in themselves, but the dialectical engagement between the two. Moreover, Ric≈ìur, on the goal of hermeneutics, puts emphasis upon self-understanding as the outcome of the hermeneutical process: > \\"In proposing to relate symbolic language to self-understanding, I think I > fulfill the deepest wish of hermeneutics. The purpose of all interpretation > is to conquer a remoteness, a distance between the past cultural epoch to > which the text belongs and the interpreter himself. By overcoming this > distance, by making himself contemporary with the text, the exegete can > appropriate its meaning to himself: foreign, he makes it familiar, that is, > he makes it his own. It is thus the growth of his own understanding of > himself that he pursues through his understanding of others. Every > hermeneutics is thus, explicitly or implicitly, self-understanding by means > of understanding others.\\"Ric≈ìur, Paul, Charles E. Reagan, and David Stewart. > \\"Existence and Hermeneutics.\\" In The Philosophy of Paul Ric≈ìur: An Anthology > of His Work. Boston: Beacon Press, 1978, pp. 101 and 106. Ricoeur maintains that the hermeneutical task is a coming together of the self and an other, in a meaningful way. This explication of self-meaning and other- meaning is principally bound up and manifested in existence itself. Thus, Ricoeur depicts philosophy as a hermeneutical activity seeking to uncover the meaning of existence through the interpretation of phenomena (which can only emerge as) embedded in the world of culture: > \\"This is why philosophy remains a hermeneutics, that is, a reading of the > hidden meaning inside the text of the apparent meaning. It is the task of > this hermeneutics to show that existence arrives at expression, at meaning, > and at reflection only through the continual exegesis of all the > significations that come to light in the world of culture. Existence becomes > a self ‚Äì human and adult ‚Äì only by appropriating this meaning, which first > resides \\"outside,\\" in works, institutions, and cultural movements in which > the life of the spirit is justified.\\" Furthermore, the process of hermeneutics, and extracting meaning, is a reflective task. The emphasis is not on the external meaning, but the meaning or insight of the self which is gained through encountering the external text‚Äîor other. The self-knowledge gained through the hermeneutical process is, thus, indirectly attained. This is in opposition to the Cartesian cogito, \\"which grasps itself directly in the experience of doubt,\\" and is \\"a truth as vain as it is invincible.\\" In point of fact, the difference Ric≈ìur aims to distinguish is the means by which the self is discovered, which for him is only by means of interpreting the signified. According to Ric≈ìur, the aim of hermeneutics is to recover and to restore the meaning. The French philosopher chooses the model of the phenomenology of religion, in relation to psychoanalysis, stressing that it is characterized by a concern on the object. This object is the sacred, which is seen in relation to the profane.Eliade, Mircea (1987), The Sacred and the Profane: The Nature of Religion, translated by Willard R. Trask. San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc. Ric≈ìur's hermeneutical work Freud and Philosophy contains the famous assertion that Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud are masters of the school of suspicionPaul Ric≈ìur (1965), Freud and philosophy: an essay on interpretation, Book I Problematic, section 2: The conflict of interpretations, title: Interpretation as exercise of suspicion, p. 32Waite, Geoff (1996). Nietzsche's Corpse, Duke University Press, 1996, p. 106. (ma√Ætres du soup√ßon/√©cole du soup√ßon). Marx is reductionist, because he reduces society to economy, particularly to means of production; Nietzsche is a reductionist, because he reduces man to the 'will-to-power' and an arbitrary concept of superman; Freud is a reductionist because he reduces human nature to sexual instinct.I≈£u, Mircia (2002), Introducere √Æn hermeneuticƒÉ (Introduction to Hermeneutics), Bra»ôov: Orientul latin, p. 63. Ric≈ìur's theory has been particularly influential to postcritique, a scholarly movement in literary criticism and cultural studies that seeks for new forms of reading and interpretation that go beyond the methods of critique, critical theory, and ideological criticism. The literary critic Rita Felski, for instance, argues that he is a crucial figure in the history of this tradition. She claims that his influential analysis of the \\"hermeneutics of suspicion\\" \\"invites us to think about how we read and to what end.\\" Philosophy of language In The Rule of MetaphorRic≈ìur, P., The Rule of Metaphor: Multi-Disciplinary Studies of the Creation of Meaning in Language, trans.

Jotham was 25 when he began his reign, and reigned for 16 years. and Edwin R. Thiele concluded that his reign commenced as a coregency with his father, which lasted for 11 years. Because his father Uzziah was afflicted with tzaraath after he entered the Temple to burn incense, Jotham became governor of the palace and the land at that time, i.e. coregent, while his father lived in a separate house as a leper. William F. Albright dated his reign to 742 - 735 BC. Thiele dated his coregency with Uzziah starting in 751/750 BC and his sole reign from 740/39 to 736/735 BC, at which time he was deposed by the pro-Assyrian faction in favor of his son Ahaz. Thiele places his death in 732/731 BC. The Gospel of Matthew lists Jotham of Judah in the genealogy of Jesus. The archeologist Nelson Glueck found an imprint of king Jotham near Eilat. Also near Eilat there is a wadi called \\"Yatam wadi\\". Reign Jotham inherited a strong government, well officered and administered.

Traditionally Ioatham is the man in green on the left and the child with him is his son Achaz. Biblical chronologies for the two Israelite kingdoms in the 8th century BC are both profuse and perplexing. Some of the reign lengths or synchronisms are given from the start of a sole reign, while others are given from the start of a coregency, or, in the case of Pekah, from the start of a rival reign. Thiele maintained that the key to understanding these records lies in a proper appreciation of the growing threat from Assyria that both kingdoms faced. In 754 BC, Ashur-nirari V led the Assyrians against Arpad in northern Aram.Assyrian Eponym Canon for the years 743-740, as cited in Thiele, 1965, p. 212. His successor Tiglath-Pileser III warred against Arpad in the years 743 to 740 BC, capturing the city after three years. In face of this threat, Rezin of Damascus made an alliance with Pekah of Israel, and the two were therefore enemies of the pro-Assyrian king of Judah, Ahaz (). Meanwhile, Menahem, ruling in Samaria, sent tribute to Tiglath-Pileser (Biblical Pul) in order to \\"strengthen his hold on the kingdom,\\" (2 Kings 15:19), apparently against his anti-Assyrian rival Pekah. According to Thiele, it is the existence of strong pro-Assyrian and anti-Assyrian factions in both Israel and Judah that explains the way the chronological data for the time were recorded: > When Jotham began his rule in Judah his reign was synchronized with that of > Pekah and not with Menahem, although both were then on their thrones. This > points to close Judean ties with Pekah than with Menahem, and a common > resistance against the Assyrian threat could well have been the cause. The > fact that Jotham's accession in 751/50 is synchronized with the years of > Pekah provides strong evidence that Pekah was then ruling as king. And the > fact that Ahaz's accession in 736/35 is likewise synchronized with a reign > of Pekah that began in 752/51 provides further proof that it was at that > time that Pekah began his reign. These synchronisms of II Kings 15:32 and > 16:1 are not artificial and they are not late. No scribe of a later period > unacquainted with the historical details of the time would, or could, have > invented them. In Judah, the growing Assyrian pressure strengthened the hand of those who sought accommodation to the enemy from the north, resulting in a change of leadership: > In 736 and 735 Tiglath-pileser was again in the northwest, in the regions of > Mount Nal and Urartu. Many in Judah would no doubt think that the time had > come to submit or be crushed. In 735 it is altogether likely that a pro- > Assyrian group felt itself strong enough to force Jotham into retirement and > to place Ahaz on the throne. Although Jotham continued to live to his > (Ahaz') twentieth year (II Kings 15:30), 732/31, it was Ahaz who directed > affairs from 735. Thiele therefore explained the reason for the complexity of the chronological data for this time by taking into account the historical background. He then found that the regnal years for Judah and Israel that can be constructed from the Biblical texts fit into the known movements of the Assyrian kings during this time. Further chronological notes The calendars for reckoning the years of kings in Judah and Israel were offset by six months, that of Judah starting in Tishri (in the fall) and that of Israel in Nisan (in the spring). Cross-synchronizations between the two kingdoms therefore often allow narrowing of the beginning and/or ending dates of a king to within a six-month range. For Jotham, the Scriptural data allow the narrowing of the beginning of his coregency with Uzziah as occurring some time in the six-month interval on or following Nisan 1, 750 BC. In terms of Judean reckoning, this would be in the year that started in Tishri of 751 BC, i.e. in 751/750 or, more simply, 751 BC. His sole reign began in the year that started on Tishri 1, 740 BC, and its end was in the six-month interval that started on Nisan 1, 735 BC, i.e. in 736/735 according to the Judean calendar, or more simply 736 BC. His death occurred in the year that started in Tishri, 732 BC. Archeological Findings In the mid-1990s a very important bulla showed up on the antiquities market. A bulla is a flattened lump of hardened clay bearing the impression of a seal. They were used to seal papyrus documents. The papyrus would be folded and tied with a string. A soft lump of clay would then be placed on the string and impressed with a signet ring or pendant bearing the seal of the sender. The clay would harden, thus securing the contents of the document. This bulla measures a mere 2/5‚Äù wide. The back of the bulla still bears the imprint of the papyrus it once sealed, as well as the double string which held it together. It even contains a fingerprint on the left edge. Like many bullae, it was preserved due to fire. When a city was burned by an invading army, it would cause the destruction of most artifacts, but would cause the bullae to be preserved. Just as in a kiln, these bullae were baked to perfection. What makes this bulla remarkable is its inscription. It reads: ‚ÄúBelonging to Ahaz (son of) Yehotam, King of Judah‚Äù. Given the process that created and preserves bullae, they are virtually impossible to forge, so most scholars believe this bulla to be authentic. It bears the seal of King Ahaz of Judah.

Early life and education Cutler was born in New York City. His father was a trial lawyer. He graduated from Yale University in 1936 at age 18, with a bachelor's degree in history and economics. In college, he was a member of Elihu. Three years later, he graduated magna cum laude from Yale Law School, where he was editor-in-chief of the Yale Law Journal. Career Following his graduation, he clerked for Judge Charles Edward Clark for a year before entering private practice at Cravath, Swaine & Moore. During World War II, he worked briefly for the Lend- Lease Administration, later enlisting in the U.S. Army and becoming an intelligence analyst. In 1962, he co-founded the Washington, D.C., based law firm Wilmer Cutler & Pickering, specializing in international law and public policy. He also co-chaired the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, formed at the request of President John F. Kennedy. White House Cutler served as the White House Counsel to President Jimmy Carter, whom he had met first while both were serving on the Trilateral Commission. Cutler served as a special counsel and consultant to the president on the ratification of SALT II and other international matters. In 1994, President Bill Clinton was looking for a new lawyer, as Bernard Nussbaum had resigned, so Clinton decided to hire Cutler under unusual terms. Cutler was able to remain as counsel at his firm and to counsel private clients as long as their interests did not conflict with those of the government‚Äîa first for a White House Counsel. Thus, he also served as counsel in Clinton's administration. Cutler came into national news as a result of the Whitewater investigations and Lewinsky scandal. He went on PBS's News Hour on February 6, 1998, and defended President Clinton as the Lewinsky investigation started by denying that Lewinsky had visited 37 times. On his work in Washington, Cutler said, \\"This is an excitement to us, a feeling of being in on it, and whichever part of the Washington milieu we come from, we want to play a part. That's why we're here.\\" Intelligence Commission On February 6, 2004, Cutler was appointed to the Iraq Intelligence Commission, an independent panel tasked with investigating U.S. intelligence surrounding the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the allegations that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Personal life On May 8, 2005, he died at his home in Washington, D.C., due to complications of a broken hip. He was survived by his wife, Polly Kraft, and four children.

From 1993 to 2013, he was the 22nd President of Yale University. From March 2014 to June 2017, he was Chief Executive Officer of Coursera. Early life and education Born in San Francisco, California, to Jewish-American parents, Levin graduated from Lowell High School in San Francisco in 1964. At Lowell, he was a member of the Lowell Forensic Society and debated in high school debate tournaments regionally. He graduated from Stanford University in 1968 with a B.A. in history. He received a Bachelor of Letters in politics and philosophy from Merton College, Oxford. He earned his Ph.D. in economics from Yale in 1974. His academic specialties include industrial research and development, intellectual property, and productivity in manufacturing.  Career  Levin became an Assistant Professor of Economics at Yale in 1974 and was elevated to Associate Professor in 1979. In 1982, he was promoted to Professor of Economics and Management at the Yale School of Management. In 1992, he was appointed Frederick William Beinecke Professor of Economics. Before becoming president, he served as chairman of the Economics Department and dean of Yale's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. On February 6, 2004, Levin was appointed to the Iraq Intelligence Commission, an independent panel convened to investigate U.S. intelligence surrounding the United States' 2003 invasion of Iraq and Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. He had previously served on a government panel reviewing the U.S. Postal Service and an independent panel appointed by Major League Baseball to examine the sport's economics. Levin is a director of the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, American Express, and Satmetrix. Although described in Who's Who as a Democrat, Levin was one of the first guests of President George W. Bush in the White House during his first term and the president stayed at Levin's house when he received an honorary degree from Yale in 2001. Levin had been rumored as a possible replacement for Larry Summers as Director of the White House National Economic Council until Gene Sperling was selected instead. Levin stepped down as president of Yale on June 30, 2013. Shortly before his retirement as President of Yale University, he published a book, The Worth of the University, a sequel to his previous work, The Work of the University. He was succeeded by Peter Salovey. As President of Yale, Levin studied and helped to some extent to guide what he called \\"the rise of Asia's universities\\".http://m.foreignaffairs.com/articles/66216/richard-c-levin/top- of-the-class Yale's role in Asia is briefly set out below. In 2013, Levin agreed to serve on the Advisory Board for the newly created Schwarzman Scholars - fellowships that will take students from many countries for post- graduate study together at Tsinghua University in Beijing, with the aim of promoting international understanding. In March 2014, Levin became Chief Executive Officer of Coursera. In June 2017, Coursera announced that Levin was being replaced by Jeff Maggioncalda. Levin and his wife Jane, also a professor at Yale, reside in New Haven, Connecticut.See, e.g., http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2008/04/28/at-mr-levins-side-a-first-lady-and-a- conscience/ They have four children and seven grandchildren. Yale under Levin During Levin's tenure, Yale's endowment grew from $3.2 billion to over $20 billion. Yale's admissions standards and academic prestige also recovered from a significant lull in the early 1990s since Levin's appointment. Applications to Yale College rose from fewer than 11,000 for the class entering in 1993 to 28,975 for the class entering in 2012,http://www.yale.edu/oir/open/pdf_public/W033_Fresh_Admissions.pdfhttp://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/mar/29/yale- offers-admission-1975-applicants/?cross-campus with the most recent classes reporting the highest range of standardized test scores for any college in America.http://premium.usnews.com/best-colleges Under Levin, Yale aggressively expanded its efforts to recruit international students and students from previously underrepresented regions of the United States. Levin helped established a program for undergraduates in Beijing and increase participation in international work/study programs. Levin has made a special effort to expand Yale's engagement with China and was elected to the board of the National Committee on United States-China Relations. Levin was president during the largest building and renovation program since the 1930s, including all of the university's residential colleges. About 70 percent of the space on campus was partially or comprehensively renovated between 1993 and 2013. Levin approved the creation of Yale's first two new residential colleges since the 1960s with the purpose of increasing the undergraduate population from around 5,400 to over 6,000. The project was delayed due to the financial crisis, but construction was begun in 2013, shortly after Levin stepped down. Levin vastly expanded the Yale campus with the creation of Yale's West Campus. The campus was created by the purchase of the 136-acre, 17-building Bayer Pharmaceutical campus in Orange, Connecticut, seven miles from Yale's main campus. The purchase was completed for $107 million in 2007 and was described at the time as a \\"ready-made, state-of-the-art research facility\\".http://westcampus.yale.edu/about/history Levin's administration worked to improve Yale University's relationship with its local workers. In 2003, Levin negotiated eight-year contracts with the university's unionized workers that provided health care, extensive paid leave, and cumulative raises ranging from 32% to 43%, although he has also fought strongly against new unionization drives by hospital workers, graduate employees, and security guards. Levin spearheaded the creation of the first liberal arts college in Asia, Yale-NUS College, a joint venture between Yale University and the National University of Singapore. Yale initially faced strong criticism that Singapore's various restrictions on press freedom and public protests, as well as its anti-homosexuality policies, would undermine Yale-NUS's liberal arts mission. Honors In 1998, as President of Yale, Levin was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Oxford in a ceremony in which the President of Harvard University, Neil Rudenstine, was also honored.

It was designed by Douglas on behalf of the United States Navy, which sought a carrier-capable strategic bomber. During July 1949, Douglas was awarded the contract to produce its design, having bested eight other aircraft companies' submissions. Unlike rival designs, which had aimed for a maximum take-off weight, the Skywarrior was developed for a take-off weight, facilitating its use from the navy's existing s. Large portions of the aircraft were produced by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, including its early Westinghouse J40 turbojet engines, which failed to meet promises and were replaced by the rival Pratt & Whitney J57 engine by mid-1953. On 28 October 1952, the prototype XA3D-1 performed the type's maiden flight. On 31 March 1956, the Skywarrior entered squadron service with the Navy. Initially used in the nuclear-armed strategic bomber role, the emergence of effective ballistic missiles led to this mission being deprioritised by the early 1960s. Throughout the majority of its later service life, the Skywarrior was tasked with various secondary missions, which included use as an electronic warfare platform, tactical reconnaissance aircraft, and high capacity aerial refueling tanker.Winchester 2006, p. 74. It was among the longest serving carrier-based aircraft in history, having entered service during the mid-1950s and withdrawn from use in 1991. Throughout its service, the Skywarrior was the heaviest operational aircraft to operate from an aircraft carrier,the heaviest aircraft operated from a carrier was a USMC KC-130F used in a test from unarrested and unassisted in takeoff in 1963 which contributed to its nickname of \\"Whale\\". The Skywarrior is one of only two U.S. Navy attack aircraft intended as a strategic bomber to enter full-scale service, the other being its predecessor, the North American AJ Savage. The carrier-based supersonic North American A-5 Vigilante was also originally designed for strategic nuclear strike missions and initially, very briefly, supplanted the A-3 in that role beginning in the early 1960s. A modified derivative of the Skywarrior, the B-66 Destroyer, served in the United States Air Force, where it was operated as a tactical bomber, electronic warfare aircraft, and aerial reconnaissance platform up until its withdrawal during the 1970s. Development=Background A3D-1 at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida in the 1950s During World War II, the United States Navy (USN) began to explore the concept of operating jet- powered aircraft from its aircraft carriers. Success encouraged further development of the concept; early in the post-war years, officials within the USN began to investigate the use of jet power as a potential means of operating larger carrier-based aircraft that would be capable of performing the strategic bombing mission. The USN had a growing awareness that it could operate in a broader role that had been previously possible, and that the strategic bomber fleet operated by the United States Air Force (USAF) was unable to reach large parts of the world, a limitation that was not present upon its aircraft carrier fleet and their air wings.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 128. In January 1948, the Chief of Naval Operations issued a requirement to develop a long-range, carrier-based attack plane that could deliver either a bomb load or a nuclear weapon.Winchester 2006, p. 75. The envisioned aircraft was intended to be operated from the planned United States-class \\"supercarriers,\\" which were significantly larger than the USN's existing carriers, thus the specification set a target loaded weight of . Additionally, the USN sought for this bomber to possess greater speed and range than its existing North American AJ Savage fleet. A total of eight aircraft manufacturers produced responses to the specification, but all except Douglas Aircraft Company and Curtiss-Wright would drop out, declaring that there was no means that the requirements could be met within the 100,000 lb weight limitation.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 129. Uncertainty over the performance and requirements of both engines and bombs were major contributing factors towards this climate of negativity. Ed Heinemann, Douglas' chief designer, later to win fame for the A-4 Skyhawk, fearing that the United States class was vulnerable to cancellation, proposed a significantly smaller aircraft of loaded weight, capable of operating from the USN's existing carriers.Polmar 1988, pp 50‚Äì51.Francillon 1979, pp. 493‚Äì494. Heinemann had reasoned (correctly) that as technology developed, the size and weight of nuclear weapons would substantially decrease, which increased the rationale for designing a more compact bomber.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 128-129. However, figures such as USAF general Hoyt Vandenberg ridicules Heinemann's proposal as \\"making irresponsible claims\\". During this period, the USN and USAF were vigorous rivals, each seeking to maintain funding for its projects at the expense of the other in a time marked by drastically declining defense budgets; specifically, USAF officials frequently voiced their open opposition to the construction of the United States-class carriers. Selection During late 1948, both Douglas and Curtiss-Wright were awarded preliminary design contracts to further develop and refine their proposals. While Douglas managed to maintain the take-off weight at 68,000 lb, Curtiss were unable to meet the more generous 100,000 lb target during this phase, and thus were eliminated from consideration. During April 1949, the USN's critics succeeded in getting the United States-class carriers cancelled; this outcome validated Heinemann's decision to focus on a design that could operate from the navy's smaller s. During July 1949, the USN, recognizing the suitability of Douglas' design, awarded a contract for the production of two flight-capable prototypes and a single static airframe to the company. Douglas sourced significant portions of the aircraft, including responsibility for the turbojet engines, radar, tail-mounted turret, electrical generators and various other secondary systems, from the Westinghouse Electric Corporation; this heavy reliance on Westinghouse allegedly caused to some discomfort to Douglas. In particular, development of the Westinghouse J40 engine proved to be incapable of meeting development schedules or performance promises; Heinemann later commented that \\"the first thing we learned was that the J40 was not powerful enough\\". Even prior to the first flight being conducted, Douglas was considering switching to rival manufacturer Pratt & Whitney's J57 engine, which was heavier, but allowed the overall aircraft to be lighter due to being less fuel hungry.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 130-131. On 28 October 1952, the prototype XA3D-1 performed the type's maiden flight; flown by George Jansen, this initial test flight was carried out with a high degree of secrecy. Early on, the aircraft was found to handle particularly well in flight, in part due to the attention Heinemann and the design team had paid to the hydraulically- boosted control surfaces.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 130. On 16 October 1953, the first YA3D-1, powered by the rival J57 engine, made its first flight.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 131. Considerable development problems, largely associated with the original J40 engines, had delayed the introduction of the Skywarrior until 31 March 1956. The A-3 was, by far, the largest and heaviest aircraft ever designed for routine use on an aircraft carrier, though ironically it was the smallest proposal among other proposals that could only be deployed on even larger carriers not yet in service. As had been predicted by Heinemann early on, the Skywarrior had been designed to carry larger and bulkier bombs that it ever would in service due to the rapid improvements made in weapons technology. Despite this, at the Navy's insistence, the aircraft was qualified for an 'overload' payload capacity of , the testing of which would establish a weight-related record for carrier operations. Because of its cumbersome size, and less-than-slender profile, it was nicknamed \\"The Whale\\".O'Rourke, G.G., CAPT USN. \\"Of Hosenoses, Stoofs, and Lefthanded Spads\\". United States Naval Institute Proceedings, July 1968. By the end of the 1950s, it was becoming clear that the nuclear mission of the Skywarrior would be passed onto ballistic missiles; however, its high weight clearance and size meant that the aircraft would be useful in various other capacities.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 132-133. Accordingly, large numbers of Skywarriors were retrofitted as aerial refuelling tankers or as electronic warfare platforms; notably, the EKA-3B model could readily swing between performing strike, refuelling, and electronic warfare duties as required. Numerous other models of the type were developed, leading to the type being used for aerial reconnaissance and as a trainer aircraft as well.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 131-133. Production of the type ceased in 1961. Design The Skywarrior had a 36¬∞ degree swept wing and two Pratt & Whitney J57 turbojet engines. Early prototypes had used the intended Westinghouse J40, a powerplant that proved to be disastrous and was subsequently canceled. The turbojets could be supplemented by a provision for twelve thrust JATO bottles. The aircraft had a largely conventional semi-monocoque fuselage, with the engines in underwing nacelles. Flight controls were hydraulic, and for storage below deck, the A-3's wings folded outboard of the engines, lying almost flat, and its vertical stabilizer was hinged to starboard. Capacious internal fuel tanks provided long range. Camera arrangement of a camouflaged RA-3B of Heavy Photographic Squadron 61 The early A-3 variants had a crew of three: pilot, bombardier/navigator (BN) and crewman/navigator (aka: third crewman). An unusual cockpit configuration was incorporated with the three crew sitting under a framed canopy. In the raised compartment, the pilot and bombardier/navigator sat in a side-by-side arrangement with the pilot's station on the port side having full flight controls. On initial variants, a third crew member, who also acted as a gunner for the twin tail-mounted 20mm cannon that briefly equipped the original bomber version of the A3D/A-3A (removed and replaced by ECM equipment), sat behind the pilot in an aft-facing seat. The third crewman station had the sextant for celestial navigation and the defensive electronic counter measures equipment. Later electronic reconnaissance variants could accommodate a crew of seven with the flight crew consisting of a pilot, co-pilot and navigator plus four electronic systems operators occupying stations in the former bomb bay in the spacious fuselage. Efforts to reduce weight to make the aircraft suitable for carrier operations had led to the deletion of ejection seats during the design process for the Skywarrior, based on the assumption that most flights would be at high altitude. A similar arrangement with an escape tunnel had been used on the F3D Skyknight.Francillon 1979, p. 494. Aircrews began joking morbidly that \\"A3D\\" stood for \\"All Three Dead\\".Polmar 1988, p. 53. (In 1973, the widow of a Skywarrior crewman killed over Vietnam sued the McDonnell Douglas Aircraft Company for not providing ejection seats in the A-3.) In contrast, the US Air Force's B-66 Destroyer, not subject to the weight requirements for carrier operations, was equipped with ejection seats throughout its service life. The documented history of mechanical failures in the A3D / A-3 showed a rate well above average. While there were magazine articles that conjectured that the safety problem was compounded by assigning weaker pilots to slower jets like the A-3, during their heyday, Skywarrior pilots were often \\"best-of-the-best\\" and were, with few exceptions, senior pilots with a minimum of 1,500 hours jet time, due to its critical nuclear strike mission and the difficulty of bringing such a large plane aboard, especially at night on the smaller carriers. Originally, the Skywarrior bombers were assigned to all attack carriers, which included: the World War II-era and the (just) postwar Midway class.\\"A-3 dispositions, accident reports.\\" Click ready room. Retrieved: 28 July 2012. The Skywarrior could carry up to of weaponry in the fuselage bomb bay, which in later versions was used for sensor and camera equipment or additional fuel tanks. An AN/ASB-1A bomb-director system was initially installed, later replaced by a revised AN/ASB-7 with a slightly reshaped nose. Defensive armament was two 20mm cannons in a radar-operated tail turret designed by Westinghouse, soon removed in favor of electronic counter measure equipment. Although some bombing missions would be carried out early in the Vietnam War, most bombing would be carried out by more nimble attack and fighter bombers, and the Skywarrior would serve mostly as a tanker and electronic warfare support aircraft. Operational history=Nuclear bomber An A3D-2 from VAH-9 suffers a nose wheel collapse while landing on , c. 1959 Prior to the initial operational capability of the U.S. Navy's Polaris-armed Fleet Ballistic Missile submarines, the A-3 was the Navy's critical element in the U.S. nuclear deterrent. Squadrons were established in two Heavy Attack Wings (HATWINGs), with one wing initially established at Naval Air Station North Island, California before relocating to Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington in December 1957 while the other wing was initially established at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida before relocating to Naval Air Station Sanford, Florida. The wing at NAS Whidbey Island would disestablish in 1959 but the squadrons which had made up the wing would later transition to the EKA-3B variant, eventually forming the nucleus for the Navy's Grumman EA-6B Prowler community, while the wing at NAS Sanford would convert to the A3J Vigilante (later A-5A) in the nuclear heavy attack mission, followed by conversion to the RA-5C and transition to the reconnaissance attack mission. The Vigilante wing would also continue to retain a small number of TA-3B aircraft for training Naval Flight Officers in the Vigilante's radar and navigation systems. The Skywarrior's strategic bombing role faded after 1964, briefly being complemented by the A3J Vigilante. Soon afterward, the Navy abandoned the concept of carrier-based strategic nuclear weaponry for the successful Polaris missile-equipped Fleet Ballistic Missile submarine program and all A-5As were converted to the RA-5C Vigilante reconnaissance variant. Many A-3Bs were converted to a combination tanker-electronic warfare aircraft. Vietnam War era VAH-4 A-3B from dropping a Mk 83 bomb, 1965. A black RA-3B from VAP-61 aboard , 1967. Skywarriors saw some use in the conventional bombing and mine-laying role (A-3B) during the Vietnam War from 1964 through 1967, often to deliver Mk84 bombs. The A-3 found subsequent service in the tanker (KA-3B), photographic reconnaissance (RA-3B), electronic reconnaissance (EA-3B), and electronic warfare (ERA-3B, EKA-3B) roles. For most of the Vietnam War, EA-3Bs of Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron 1 (VQ-1) flew from Da Nang Air Base in South Vietnam, providing continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the Ho Chi Minh Trail and all the way north to Haiphong harbor. This was known as VQ-1 Det.B. The aircrew and ground support personnel were temporarily assigned from their home base at Naval Air Station Atsugi, Japan and after 1970, Naval Air Station Agana, Guam. After Det B was disestablished, VQ-1 provided detachments of two EA-3B aircraft that deployed with Western Pacific and Indian Ocean (WESTPAC/IO) bound aircraft carrier battle groups up until the late 1980s when it was replaced by the Lockheed ES-3A Shadow. In addition, a version of the A-3B was modified into the RA-3B and used in Vietnam as a photo reconnaissance aircraft.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 132. Heavy Photographic Squadron 61 (VAP-61) at Naval Air Station Agana, Guam and sister squadron VAP-62 at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida furnished crews and flew out of Da Nang AB performing mapping and intelligence gathering flight over the Southeast Asia area. With 12 camera stations the RA-3B was well equipped to perform cartographic mapping of areas where no detail maps existed. With IR gear installed, the RA-3B was used at night to monitor the movement of troops down roads and trails in Laos. Other locations included Det Tango at Don Muang Royal Thai Air Force Base in Bangkok, Thailand, Det Southpaw at RAAF Base Townsville, Australia, as well as work out of Osan Air Base, South Korea. =Tanker role= VAQ-135 refueling an VF-211 F-8J off Vietnam, 1972. During the Vietnam War, the A-3 attack aircraft were modified to KA-3B tankers while some were modified into a multi- mission tanker variant, the EKA-3B, which was a real workhorse for the carrier air wing. Electronic jamming equipment was added without removing tanker capability so the EKA-3B could jam enemy radar while waiting to refuel tactical aircraft.Lake, Julian S., RADM USN & Hartman, Richard V., LCDR USN \\"Air Electronic Warfare\\" United States Naval Institute Proceedings October 1976 p. 49 Eventually, the EKA-3B was replaced by the smaller dedicated Grumman KA-6D Intruder tanker, which although it had less capacity and endurance, was deployed in greater numbers within the carrier's air wing. Two additional Naval Reserve units were established in the early 1970s as air refueling squadrons, VAQ-208 and VAQ-308, at Naval Air Station Alameda, California. Both units operated aircraft with electronic warfare equipment removed and were redesignated as KA-3Bs. VAK-208 and VAK-308 were decommissioned in the early 1990s. Cold War An EA-3B of Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron Two (VQ-2) lands on in 1987 The EA-3 variant was used in critical electronic intelligence (ELINT) roles operating from aircraft carrier decks and ashore supplementing the larger Lockheed EP-3. Its last service was as an ELINT platform during Desert Storm. Reconnaissance The EA-3B variant was modified for electronic intelligence against the Warsaw Pact. Missions were flown around the globe beginning in 1956, with the U.S. Air Force EB-47 Stratojet flying a similar mission. The EA-3B carried a crew of seven, with flight crew of three in the cockpit and an Electronic Warfare Officer and three electronic systems operators/evaluators in the converted weapons bay. It offered unique electronic reconnaissance capabilities in numerous Cold War-era conflicts and the Vietnam War. Retirement wings folded aboard museum ship at Patriots Point Park in Charleston, South Carolina A handful of EA-3Bs remained in service long enough to participate in the first Gulf War in 1991.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 133. The Skywarrior was withdrawn from USN service during September 1991, the last examples of the type being retired on 27 September 1991. U.S. Navy RDT&E; units, notably Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) activities at Naval Air Station Point Mugu and NAWS China Lake, attempted to retain their A-3 testbeds. These ambitions were ultimately unsuccessful when Vice Admiral Richard Dunleavy, as Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Air Warfare and a former A-3 bombardier/navigator himself, made the final decision to retire the type. Post-retirement career The A-3 had been used as a civilian operated testbed for many years before the type's retirement from US Navy, with Hughes Aircraft Company using the type as a testbed for developing the weapons system for the General Dynamics‚ÄìGrumman F-111B and Grumman F-14 Tomcat, with Westinghouse and Raytheon also using the A-3 as a testbed.Munzel 2001, pp. 73‚Äì75. On the retirement of the type from US Navy service in 1991, the US Navy decided to end logistic support for the civilian operated testbeds. Rather than abandon the A-3, Hughes, Westinghouse and Raytheon agreed to acquire the remaining A-3s and spares from the Navy, allowing their test fleets to continue to operate and saving the US Navy the cost of storage and disposal. As the plan matured, two other contractors, Thunderbird Aviation and CTAS also elected to participate in similar agreements, with eleven A-3s spread between the five operators.Munzel 2001, p. 75. The fleet spares from ASO (Aviation Supply Office) were distributed between the contractors evenly, and warehouses were emptied all over the US. Due to misunderstandings and reorganizations within the US Navy, the worldwide ASO assets were scrapped, not getting to the contractors. In early 1993, CTAS decided that they no longer had use for their aircraft, and Hughes had several programs needing additional assets. NRA-3B of the Pacific Missile Test Center in 1982 In early 1994, a US Air Force program decided to modify an A-3 for F-15 radar tests, and the only available airframe was stored at Naval Air Station Alameda since the fleet shutdown. Hughes added that aircraft to the bailment, and ferried the aircraft to Van Nuys for modifications. An entire nose section was removed from a stricken F-15B at AMARC at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona and grafted onto the front of the aircraft. Racks and equipment were installed in the cabin, and the aircraft was used by Hughes and the USAF for F-15 software development. In 1994, Westinghouse decided to terminate their agreement with the Navy, and Thunderbird added their aircraft to the Thunderbird bailment. In 1996, Thunderbird Aviation went into receivership, and Hughes, through mutual cost savings to the government, added the Thunderbird assets to the contract, prepping them for ferry at Deer Valley airport, and relocating them to Mojave, California and Tucson, Arizona for long-term storage. In December 1996, Raytheon bought the aerospace units of Hughes Aircraft Company. Hughes Aeronautical Operations, now a part of Raytheon Systems, continued to operate the A-3s from their base at Van Nuys Airport, California.\\"A picture of the modified A-3 currently (2011) based at Van Nuys.\\" air-and-space.com. Retrieved: 29 June 2011. These aircraft have participated in several military air shows, telling visitors that the plane continued to be valuable for its load capacity compared to corporate jets, and its performance compared to small airliners. On 30 June 2011, the last flyable EA-3B, BuNo 144865 / FAA registration N875RS, a Raytheon aircraft, arrived at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida for retirement and display at the National Naval Aviation Museum. Variants An A3D-1 of Heavy Attack Squadron 3 (VAH-3) on in 1957. VAH-3 became the A3D/A-3 Replacement Air Group (RAG) squadron for the Atlantic Fleet in 1958. Note: under the original Navy designation scheme, the Skywarrior was designated A3D (third Attack aircraft from Douglas Aircraft). In September 1962, the new Tri-Services designation system was implemented and the aircraft was redesignated A-3. Where applicable, pre-1962 designations are listed first, post-1962 designations in parentheses. * XA3D-1: Two prototypes with Westinghouse J40 turbojets, no cannon in tail turret. * YA3D-1 (YA-3A): One pre-production prototype with Pratt & Whitney J57 engines. Later used for tests at the Pacific Missile Test Center. * A3D-1 (A-3A): 49 initial production versions, serving largely in developmental role in carrier service. * A3D-1P (RA-3A): One A3D-1 converted as a prototype for the A3D-2P with camera pack in the weapon bay. * A3D-1Q (EA-3A): Five A3D-1s converted for the electronic reconnaissance (ELINT) role, with ECM equipment and four operators in weapons bay. * A3D-2 (A-3B): Definitive production bomber version, with stronger airframe, more powerful engines, slightly larger wing area (812 ft¬≤/75 m¬≤ versus 779 ft¬≤/72 m¬≤), provision for in-flight refueling reel for tanker role. Final 21 built had new AN/ASB-7 bombing system, reshaped nose; deleted tail turret in favor of electronic warfare installation. * A3D-2P (RA-3B): 30 photo-reconnaissance aircraft with weapons bay package for up to 12 cameras plus photoflash bombs. Increased pressurization allowed camera operator to enter the bay to check the cameras. Some retained tail guns, but most were later converted to ECM tail of late A-3Bs. * A3D-2Q (EA-3B): 24 electronic warfare versions with pressurized compartment in former weapon bay for one Electronic Warfare Officer and three ESM operators, various sensors. Some early models had tail guns, but these were replaced with the ECM tail. It was assigned to fleet reconnaissance squadrons VQ-1 (Japan and later Guam) and VQ-2 (Rota. Spain) where they flew alongside the Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star and the EP-3B and EP-3E. It served for almost 40 years, being the longest serving variant, and was replaced by the ES-3A Shadow flown by two Fleet Air Reconnaissance (VQ) squadrons: VQ-5 at Naval Air Station North Island, California and VQ-6 at Naval Air Station Cecil Field, Florida. They were decommissioned due to budget constraints less than 10 years after commissioning. * A3D-2T (TA-3B): 12 bomber-trainer versions. Five later converted as VIP transports (two redesignated UTA-3B). * KA-3B: 85 A-3B bombers refitted in 1967 for the tanker role with probe-and-drogue system in place of bombing equipment. * EKA-3B: 34 KA-3B tankers refitted for dual Electronic countermeasures (ECM)/tanker role, with electronic warfare equipment and tail fairing in place of rear turret. Most were converted back to KA-3B configuration (with no ECM gear) after 1975. * ERA-3B: Eight RA-3Bs converted as electronic aggressor aircraft (primarily for war-at sea exercises) with ECM gear in an extended tail cone and fairings, along with two detachable ram-air turbine powered ALQ-76 countermeasures pods (one under each wing), chaff dispensers (on the tail cone and aft fuselage) and four ram-air turbines (two per side) to power equipment located in the former bomb bay. Crew increased to four: pilot, navigator, crew chief, and Electronic Countermeasures Officer (ECMO) with one mostly unused \\"jumpseat\\" in the aft crew compartment (the former weapon bay) which lacked an equipment position for a second Electronic Countermeasures Officer or enlisted crewman. The \\"jump seat\\" was used by instructor ECMOs training new ECMOs, as well as by guest observers and passengers during operational flights. While the ERA-3B could withstand a cable-arrested landing, the ALT-40 and ALR-75 equipment was not stressed to withstand catapult launches, thus it was never deployed aboard carriers. The ERA-3B served with VAQ-33 and later with VAQ-34. * NRA-3B: Six RA-3Bs converted for various non-combat test purposes. A VA-3B used by the Chief of Naval Operations at Nellis AFB. * VA-3B: Two EA-3B converted as VIP transports. Both aircraft were assigned to the Chief of Naval Operations flying from Andrews AFB in Washington, DC. * NTA-3B: One aircraft converted by Hughes/Raytheon used to test radar for the F-14D Tomcat. B-66 Destroyer The U.S. Air Force ordered 294 examples of the derivative B-66 Destroyer, most of which were used in the reconnaissance and electronic warfare roles. The Destroyer was fitted with ejection seats.

Recherches sur Diderot et sur l'Encyclop√©die. 1989, Volume 7, Num√©ro 7, S. 137 in particular, the multi-volume G√©ographie-physique.Sir Archibald Geikie, The Founders of Geology (1897) Desmarest was born at Soulaines, in the department of Aube. Of humble parentage, he was educated at the college of the Oratorians of Troyes and Paris. Taking full advantage of the instruction he received, he was able to support himself by teaching, and to continue his studies independently. Buffon's Theory of the Earth interested him, and in 1753 he successfully competed for a prize by writing an essay on the ancient connection between England and France. This attracted much attention, and ultimately led to his being employed in studying and reporting on manufactures in different countries, and in 1788 to his appointment as inspector-general of the manufactures of France. He utilized his journeys, travelling on foot, so as to add to his knowledge of the Earth's structure. In 1763 he made observations in Auvergne, recognizing that the prismatic basalts were old lava streams, comparing them with the columns of the Giant's Causeway in Ireland, and referring them to the operations of extinct volcanoes. It was not, however, until 1774 that he published an essay on the subject, accompanied by a geological map, having meanwhile on several occasions revisited the district. He then pointed out the succession of volcanic outbursts and the changes the rocks had undergone through weathering and erosion. As remarked by Sir Archibald Geikie, the doctrine of the origin of valleys by the erosive action of the streams which flow through them was first clearly taught by Desmarest. An enlarged and improved edition of his map of the volcanic region of Auvergne was published after his death, in 1823, by his son Anselme Ga√´tan Desmarest (1784-1838), who was distinguished as a zoologist, and author of memoirs on recent and fossil crustaceans. He died in Paris.

He was an active promoter and expert writer in many fields, interested in science, medicine, agriculture, politics, and education. He was a contemporary of Robert Boyle, whom he knew well, and a neighbour of Samuel Pepys in Axe Yard, London, in the early 1660s. He studied briefly at the University of Cambridge upon arriving in England. \\"Intelligencer\\" Hartlib is often described as an \\"intelligencer\\", and indeed has been called \\"the Great Intelligencer of Europe\\".Arved H√ºbler, Peter Linde and John W. T. Smith, Electronic Publishing '01: 2001 in the Digital Publishing Odyssey (IOS Press, 2001). His main aim in life was to further knowledge and so he kept in touch with a vast array of contacts, from high philosophers to gentleman farmers. He maintained a voluminous correspondence and much of this has survived, having been lost entirely from 1667 to 1945;Hugh Trevor-Roper, From Counter- Reformation to Glorious Revolution (1992), p. 227. it is housed in a special Hartlib collection at the University of Sheffield in England. Hartlib became one of the best-connected intellectual figures of the Commonwealth era, and was responsible for patents, spreading information and fostering learning. He circulated designs for calculators, double-writing instruments, seed-machines and siege engines. His letters, in German, Latin, English and other languages, have been the subject of close modern scholarship. Hartlib set out with the universalist goal \\"to record all human knowledge and to make it universally available for the education of all mankind\\".The Hartlib Papers Project ‚Äì University of Sheffield His work has been compared to modern internet search engines.Eine Vorgeschichte der Internet-Suchmaschine Life Hartlib was born in Elbing (ElblƒÖg) in Poland. His mother was the daughter of a rich English merchant in Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk). His father is said to have been a refugee merchant from Poland. He studied at the Gymnasium in Brieg (Brzeg) and at the Albertina. He went on to Herborn Academy, where he studied under Johannes Heinrich Alsted and Johannes Bisterfeld.M. M. Slaughter, Universal Languages and Scientific Taxonomy in the Seventeenth Century (2010), p. 232; Google Books. Although briefly at the University of Cambridge, supported by John PrestonAndrew Pyle (editor), Dictionary of Seventeenth-Century British Philosophers (2000), article Hartlib, Samuel, pp. 393‚Äì395, he does not seem to have formally studied there.He is not mentioned in J. and J. A. Venn's Alumni Cantabrigienses, 10 vols, 1922‚Äì1958. Hartlib met the Scottish preacher John Dury in 1628. In the same year Hartlib relocated to England, faced with the prospect of being caught in a war zone, as Imperial armies moved into the western parts of Poland and the chance of intervention by Sweden grew. He first unsuccessfully set up a school in line with his theories of education, in Chichester, and in 1630 moved permanently to London, living in Duke's Place, Holborn.Hugh Trevor-Roper, \\"Three Foreigners: The Philosophers of the Puritan Revolution\\", The Crisis of the Seventeenth Century: Religion, the Reformation, and Social Change, Indianapolis, 1967, p. 232. An early patron was John Williams, the Bishop of Lincoln, who was leading the clerical opposition to Archbishop William Laud. Roper 1967, p. 237; Hugh Trevor-Roper, From Counter-Reformation to Glorious Revolution (1992), p. 256. Another supporter was John Pym; Pym would use Hartlib later, as a go-between with Dutch Calvinists in London, in an effort to dig up evidence against Laud.Roper 1992, p. 257.Ole Peter Grell, Dutch Calvinists in Early Stuart London: The Dutch Church in Austin Friars, 1603‚Äì1642 (1989), p. 245. Hugh Trevor-Roper argues in his essay Three Foreigners (referring to Hartlib, Dury and the absent Comenius) that Hartlib and the others were the \\"philosophers\\" of the \\"country party\\" or anti-court grouping of the 1630s and early 1640s, united in their support for these outside voices if agreeing on little else.Roper 1967, pp. 237‚Äì293, especially p. 258.Three Foreigners, online text. During the Civil War, Hartlib occupied himself with the peaceful study of agriculture, publishing various works by himself, and printing at his own expense several treatises by others on the subject. He planned a school for the sons of gentlemen, to be conducted on new principles, and this probably was the occasion of his friend John Milton's Tractate on Education, addressed to him in 1644, and of William Petty's Two Letters on the same subject, in 1647 and 1648. We may assume that Chisholm relates to The Advice to Hartlib (1647); the other letter may have been the pamphlet on Double Writing (1648). Another associate in that period was Walter Blith, a noted writer on husbandry. For his various labours, Hartlib received a pension of ¬£100 from Oliver Cromwell, afterwards increased to ¬£300, as he had spent all his fortune on his experiments. But Hartlib died in poverty: Samuel Pepys in 1660 noted that Hartlib's daughter Nan was penniless.Pepys's Diary 1 July 1660. His association with Oliver Cromwell and the Commonwealth resulted in him being sidelined after Charles II's Restoration. He lost his pension, which had already fallen into arrears. Some of his correspondents went so far as to ask for their letters from his archive, fearing they could be compromised by them.Lisa Jardine, On a Grander Scale: the outstanding career of Sir Christopher Wren (2002), p. 88. Family In 1629 he married Mary Burmingham, daughter of Philip Burmingham; she died about 1660. They had at least six children. His family life is rather poorly documented: one useful source of information is the Diary of Samuel Pepys, since Pepys was a close neighbour of the Hartlib family in Axe Yard in the early 1660s and a friend of Hartlib's son Samuel Jr, a clerk in the government service.Claire Tomalin Samuel Pepys ‚Äì the Unequalled Self Penguin Books edition, 2003, p. 69. Hartlib's daughter Mary married the physician and chemist Frederick Clod, or Clodius, referred to as \\"Doctor Clodius\\" in the Diary.Pepys's Diary 17 March 1660. Another daughter Anna (Nan) married the merchant, writer and preacher Johannes Roder of Utrecht in 1660, despite her lack of a dowry. Samuel Pepys, a guest at the wedding, described it as an occasion of \\"very great state, cost and noble company\\".Pepys's Diary 10 July 1660. Always the realist, Pepys thought it an excellent match for Nan: \\"a great fortune for her to light on, she having nothing in the world.\\"Pepys's Diary 1 July 1660. Hartlib, having heard a good deal of this kind of gossip, indignantly denied that he had married off his daughter to gain a share of the Roder fortune, but the marriage was certainly advantageous, since Roder's father was a rich man, and also because Roder, as a prophet/preacher during the Cromwell years, had foretold the \\"coming of a king\\". This worked to his advantage after the return of Charles II.See footnote to the Complete Diary of Samuel Pepys, entry for 1 July 1660. Baconian Hartlib was indebted to Francis Bacon for a general theory of education, and this formed common ground for him and Jan Comenius.John Paul Russo, The Future Without a Past: The Humanities in a Technological Society (2005), p. 90. Hartlib published two studies of Comenius's work: Conatuum Comenianorum praeludia (1637) and Comenii pansophiae prodromus et didactica dissertatio (1639). He also put much effort into getting Comenius, of the Protestant Moravian Brethren, to visit England. Hartlib's two closest correspondents were John Dury, and Comenius. The latter had the concept of a \\"tree of knowledge\\", continuously branching out and growing. He also put his own spin on Bacon's ideas. In 1640 he addressed the English Parliament with his Utopian plans involving a new commonwealth and the advancement of learning. Shortly before the English Civil War broke out, John Gauden preached in 1640 to Parliament, recommending that Dury and Comenius be invited to England, and naming Hartlib as a likely contact.Roper 1967, p. 300. Men like Hartlib and Comenius wanted to make the spread of knowledge easier, at a time when most knowledge was not categorised or standardised by any widespread conventions or academic disciplines, and libraries were mostly private. They wanted to enlighten and educate, and to improve society, as religious people who saw this as the work of God. Comenius arrived in England in 1641, bad timing considering that war was imminent. His presence failed to transform the position in education, though a substantial literature grew up, particularly on university reform, where Oliver Cromwell set up a new institution. Comenius left in 1642; under Cromwell elementary schooling was expanded from 1646, and Durham College was set up, with staff from Hartlib's associates.Roper 1992, p. 225. Bacon had formulated a project for a research institute, under the title \\"Salomon's House\\" in his New Atlantis of 1624. This theoretical scheme was important for Hartlib, who angled during the 1640s for public funding for it. He was unsuccessful except for a small pension for himself, but gathered like- minded others: Dury, John Milton, Kenelm Digby, William Petty, and his own son-in-law Frederick Clod (Clodius).Markku Peltonen, The Cambridge Companion to Bacon (1996), pp. 164‚Äì165. Milton dedicated his 1644 Of Education to Hartlib, whom he had come to know the year before and who had pressed him to publish his educational ideas. But he gave the Comenian agenda short shrift in the work. Barbara Lewalski considers his dismissive attitude as disingenous, since he had probably used texts by Comenius in his own teaching.Barbara Lewalski, The Life of John Milton (2003), pp. 172‚Äì173. Hezekiah Woodward, linked at the time in the minds of Presbyterians and officialdom with Milton as a dangerous writer, was also significant as an educational follower of Comenius and Bacon, and friend of Hartlib.Christopher Hill, Intellectual Origins of the English Revolution (1965), p. 102. Hartlib Circle ‚Äì Royal Society The \\"Hartlib circle\\" of contacts and correspondents, built up from around 1630, was one of the foundations of the Royal Society of London which was established a generation later, in 1660. The relationship, however, is not transparent, because Hartlib and close supporters, with the exception of William Petty, were excluded from the Royal Society when it was set up from 1660. Economics, agriculture, politics The utopian Description of the Famous Kingdome of Macaria appeared under Hartlib's name, but is now considered to be by Gabriel Plattes (1600‚Äì1655), a friend of his..John L. Brooke, The Refiner's Fire: The Making of Mormon Cosmology, 1644‚Äì1844 (1996), p. 20. A practical project was the establishment of a workhouse, as part of the Corporation of the Poor of London. This initiative is reckoned a major influence on the later philanthropic schemes of John Bellers.. In 1641, Hartlib wrote Relation of that which hath been lately attempted to procure Ecclesiastical Peace among Protestants. After Comenius left England, and in particular from 1646 onwards, the Hartlib group agitated for religious reform and toleration, against the Presbyterian dominance in the Long Parliament. They also proposed economic, technical and agricultural improvements, particularly through Sir Cheney Culpeper, and Henry Robinson.J. P. Cooper, Social and Economic Policies under the Commonwealth, pp. 125 and 131, in G. E. Aylmer, editor, The Interregnum (1972). Benjamin Worsley, Secretary to the Council of Trade from 1650, was a Hartlibian.Christopher Hill, God's Englishman (1972 edition), p. 126. Hartlib valued useful knowledge: anything that could increase crop yields, or cure disease. One of Hartlib's great interests was agriculture. He worked to spread Dutch farming practices in England, such as using nitrogenous crops like cabbage to replenish the soil with nitrogen, to increase the yield of next season's crop. In 1652 he issued a second edition of Richard Weston's Discourse of Flanders Husbandry (1645). Hartlib corresponded with many landowners, as well as academics, in his quest for knowledge. From 1650 Hartlib was interested in and influential on fruit husbandry. A letter by Sir Richard Child, surveying the area, received publication in one of his books Samuel Hartlib, his Legacy, or an Enlargement of the Discourse of Husbandry used in Brabant and Flanders; and Hartlib introduced John Beale, another author on orchards, to John Evelyn who would eventually write an important work in the area, Sylva (1664).Adam Smyth, A Pleasing Sinne: Drink and Conviviality in Seventeenth-century England (2004), pp. 163‚Äì165. In 1655 Hartlib wrote The Reformed Commonwealth of Bees, featuring a transparent glass beehive, to a design by Christopher Wren.Lisa Jardine, On a Grander Scale: the outstanding career of Sir Christopher Wren (2002), p. 108. John Evelyn showed him the manuscript of his Elysium Britannicum, at the end of the 1650s.Therese O'Malley, John Evelyn's \\"Elysium Britannicum\\" and European Gardening (1998), p. 143. Science and medicine The work of Paracelsus, a 16th-century physician and alchemist who made bold claims for his science, was also one of the inspirations to Hartlib and early chemistry. Hartlib was open-minded, and often tested the ideas and theories of his correspondents. For his own trouble with kidney stones, Hartlib took to drinking diluted sulphuric acid ‚Äì an intended cure that may have contributed to his death. Hartlib was interested in theories and practices that modern science would deem irrational, or superstitious ‚Äì for example, sympathetic medicine, based on the idea that things in nature that bore a resemblance to an ailment could be used to treat it. Hence a plant that looked like a snake might be used to treat snake bites, or a yellow herb to treat jaundice.

The device is therefore capable of correcting most life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. The ICD is the first-line treatment and prophylactic therapy for patients at risk for sudden cardiac death due to ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. Current devices can be programmed to detect abnormal heart rhythms and deliver therapy via programmable antitachycardia pacing in addition to low-energy and high-energy shocks. \\"AICD\\" was trademarked by the Boston Scientific corporation, so the more generic \\"ICD\\" is preferred terminology. A single chamber ICD with its right ventricular lead connected into the header; note, starting from the end of the lead, the tip and adjacent first ring, used to sense the cardiac electrical activity and stimulate the right ventricle, the coil and the two rings for atrial sensing. Current device batteries last about 6‚Äì10 years, With advances in the technology (batteries with more capacity or, potentially in the future with rechargeable batteriesWiTriCity being looked at for use in pacemakersWireless Qi developed for use in pacemakers) it may be possible to increase this well past 10 years. The lead (the electrical cable connecting the device to the heart) has a much longer average longevity but can incur various types of malfunction, specifically insulation failure or fracture of the conductor and require replacement.Replacing of ICD and leads needs to be done every 5 to 10 years The process of implantation of an ICD system is similar to implantation of a pacemaker. In fact, ICDs are composed of an ICD generator and of wires. The first component or generator, contains a computer chip or circuitry with RAM (memory), programmable software, a capacitor and a battery; this is implanted typically under the skin in the left upper chest. The second part of the system is an electrode wire or wires that, similar to pacemakers, are connected to the generator and passed through a vein to the right chambers of the heart. The lead usually lodges in the apex or septum of the right ventricle. Just like pacemakers, ICDs can have a single wire or lead in the heart (in the right ventricle, single chamber ICD), two leads (in the right atrium and right ventricle, dual chamber ICD) or three leads (biventricular ICD, one in the right atrium, one in the right ventricle and one on the outer wall of the left ventricle). The difference between pacemakers and ICDs is that pacemakers are also available as temporary units and are generally designed to correct slow heart rates, i.e. bradycardia, while ICDs are often permanent safeguards against sudden life-threatening arrhythmias. Recent developments include the subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD), and the ability to pace the left ventricle from multiple sites near-simultaneously with Multipoint Pacing (Abbott). Indications Implantation of ICD is meant to prevent sudden cardiac death and is indicated under various conditions. Two broad but distinct categories are primary and secondary prevention. Primary prevention refers to patients who have not suffered a life-threatening arrhythmia episode. Secondary prevention has the strongest evidence for benefit and it refers to survivors of cardiac arrest secondary to ventricular fibrillation or hemodynamically unstable sustained ventricular tachycardia after reversible causes are excluded. Similarly, ICD use in primary prevention is to prevent cardiac death in patients who are at risk for sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. This population accounts for the bulk of all ICD implants. There are a multitude of guideline indications for ICD use in primary preventions with varying degree of supporting evidence. Periodically, both the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) and European Society of Cardiology provide an update to this guideline. Some of the Class I indications are as follows: * With LVEF ‚â§ 35% due to prior Myocardial Infarction (MI) who are at least 40 days post-MI and are in NYHA Functional Class II or III * With LV dysfunction due to prior MI who are at least 40 days post-MI, have an LVEF ‚â§ 30%, and are in NYHA Functional Class I * With nonischemic DCM who have an LVEF ‚â§ 35% and who are in NYHA Functional Class II or III * With nonsustained VT due to prior MI, LVEF < 40%, and inducible VF or sustained VT at electrophysiological study * With structural heart disease and spontaneous sustained VT, whether hemodynamically stable or unstable * With syncope of undetermined origin with clinically relevant, hemodynamically significant sustained VT or VF induced at electrophysiological study Clinical trials A number of clinical trials have demonstrated the superiority of the ICD over AAD (antiarrhythmic drugs) in the prevention of death from malignant arrhythmias. The SCD-HeFT trial (published in 2005)Bardy GH, Lee KL, Mark DB, Poole JE, Packer DL, Boineau R, Domanski M, Troutman C, Anderson J, Johnson G, McNulty SE, Clapp-Channing N, Davidson-Ray LD, Fraulo ES, Fishbein DP, Luceri RM, Ip JH; Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial (SCD-HeFT) Investigators. Amiodarone or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for congestive heart failure. N Engl J Med. 2005 Jan 20; 352(3):225‚Äì37. showed a significant all-cause mortality benefit for patients with ICD. Congestive heart failure patients that were implanted with an ICD had an all-cause death risk 23% lower than placebo and an absolute decrease in mortality of 7.2 percentage points after five years in the overall population.1 Reporting in 1999, the Antiarrhythmics Versus Implantable Defibrillators (AVID) trial consisted of 1,016 patients, and deaths in those treated with AAD were more frequent (n = 122) compared with deaths in the ICD groups (n = 80, p < 0.001). In 2002 the MADITII trial showed benefit of ICD treatment in patients after myocardial infarction with reduced left ventricular function (EF<30). Initially ICDs were implanted via thoracotomy with defibrillator patches applied to the epicardium or pericardium. The device was attached via subcutaneous and transvenous leads to the device contained in a subcutaneous abdominal wall pocket. The device itself acts as an electrode. Most ICDs nowadays are implanted transvenously with the devices placed in the left pectoral region similar to pacemakers. Intravascular spring or coil electrodes are used to defibrillate. The devices have become smaller and less invasive as the technology advances. Current ICDs weigh only 70 grams and are about 12.9 mm thick. A recent study by Birnie and colleagues at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute has demonstrated that ICDs are underused in both the United States and Canada. An accompanying editorial by Dr. Chris Simpson of Queen's University explores some of the economic, geographic, social and political reasons for this. History The development of the ICD was pioneered at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore by a team including Michel Mirowski, Morton Mower, Alois Langer and William Staewen. Mirowski teamed up with Mower and Staewen and together they commenced their research in 1969 but it was 11 years before they treated their first patient. The work was commenced against much skepticism even by leading experts in the field of arrhythmias and sudden death. There was doubt that their ideas would ever become a clinical reality. In 1972 Bernard Lown, the inventor of the external defibrillator, and Paul Axelrod stated in the journal Circulation ‚Äì \\"The very rare patient who has frequent bouts of ventricular fibrillation is best treated in a coronary care unit and is better served by an effective anti-arrhythmic program or surgical correction of inadequate coronary blood flow or ventricular malfunction. In fact, the implanted defibrillator system represents an imperfect solution in search of a plausible and practical application.\\" The problems to be overcome were the design of a system which would allow detection of ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. Despite the lack of financial backing and grants, they persisted and the first device was implanted in February 1980 at Johns Hopkins Hospital by Dr. Levi Watkins, Jr. The first devices required the chest to be cut open and a mesh electrode sewn onto the heart; the pulse generator was placed in the abdomen. Working mechanism ICDs constantly monitor the rate and rhythm of the heart and can deliver therapies, by way of an electrical shock, when the heart rate exceeds a preset number. More modern devices have software designed to attempt a discrimination between ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia (VT), and may try to pace the heart faster than its intrinsic rate in the case of VT, to try to break the tachycardia before it progresses to ventricular fibrillation. This is known as overdrive pacing, or anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP). ATP is only effective if the underlying rhythm is ventricular tachycardia, and is never effective if the rhythm is ventricular fibrillation. Many modern ICDs use a combination of various methods to determine if a fast rhythm is normal, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation. Rate discrimination evaluates the rate of the lower chambers of the heart (the ventricles) and compares it to the rate in the upper chambers of the heart (the atria). If the rate in the atria is faster than or equal to the rate in the ventricles, then the rhythm is most likely not ventricular in origin, and is usually more benign. If this is the case, the ICD does not provide any therapy, or withholds it for a programmable length of time. Rhythm discrimination will see how regular a ventricular tachycardia is. Generally, ventricular tachycardia is regular. If the rhythm is irregular, it is usually due to conduction of an irregular rhythm that originates in the atria, such as atrial fibrillation. In the picture, an example of torsades de pointes can be seen; this represents a form of irregular ventricular tachycardia. In this case, the ICD will rely on rate, not regularity, to make the correct diagnosis. Morphology discrimination checks the morphology of every ventricular beat and compares it to what the ICD knows is the morphology of normally conducted ventricular impulse for the patient. This normal ventricular impulse is often an average of a multiple of normal beats of the patient acquired in the recent past and known as a template. The integration of these various parameters is very complex, and clinically, the occurrence of inappropriate therapy is still occasionally seen and a challenge for future software advancements.

Note the 2 opaque coils along the ICD lead. People who have an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator can live full lives. Usually the ICD may not improve the quality of life of the patient, although it may provide a strong degree of reassurance. As with a pacemaker, however, living with an ICD does impose some restrictions on the person's lifestyle, outlined below. Physical activities Almost all forms of physical activities can be performed by patients with an ICD. All forms of sports that do not pose a risk of damaging the ICD or because of the underlying cardiomyopathy can be undertaken by the patient. Special care should be taken not to put excessive strain on the shoulder, arm and torso area where the ICD is implanted. Doing so may damage the ICD or the leads going from the ICD generator to the patient's heart. Particularly to be avoided are exercises that cause the clavicle to be pulled down towards the ribs, such as lifting weights with the arm, on the ICD site, while standing. Electro-magnetic equipment Equipment using large magnets or generating magnetic fields, or any similar environment, must be avoided by patients with an ICD. As with other metallic objects, an ICD is normally a contraindication to the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, several ICD manufacturers have recently introduced MR-Conditional ICDs, which allow the use of MRI under specified safe operating conditions. Quality of life Implantable cardioverter defibrillators have demonstrated clear life-saving benefits, but concerns about patient acceptance and psychological adjustment to the ICD have been the focus of much research. Researchers, including those from the field of cardiac psychology, have concluded that the quality of life (QoL) of ICD patients is at least equal to, or better than, that of those taking anti- arrhythmic medications. The largest study of examined 2,521 patients with stable heart failure in the SCD-HeFT trial.Bardy, Lee, Mark et al., 2005 Results indicated that there were no differences between ICD-treated and medication-treated groups at 30 months in patient-reported QoL.Mark DB, Anstrom KJ, Sun JL, Clapp-Channing NE, Tsiatis AA, Davidson-Ray L, Lee KL, Bardy GH. Quality of life with defibrillator therapy or amiodarone in heart failure. N Engl J Med 2008; 359(10):999‚Äì1008 Psychological adjustment following ICD implantation has also been well studied. In rare cases, the ICD can become infected and is usually bacterial in origin but other organisms such as certain fungi have occasionally been implicated. This is more likely to occur in people with diabetes, heart failure, kidney failure, or a suppressed immune system. Anxiety is a common psychological side effect, with approximately 13‚Äì38% of ICD patients reporting clinically significant anxiety. The primary etiological factors contributing to anxiety in ICD patients have not been determined, however. Depressive symptoms are also common, but the incidence of these problems has been shown to be similar to those observed in other cardiac patient groups, with approximately 24‚Äì41% of patients with ICDs experiencing depressive symptoms. Problems in psychosocial adjustment to ICDs, including the experience of anxiety, among spouses or other romantic partners are also prevalent. This phenomenon may be related, at least in part, to shared shock anxiety and avoidance of physical and sexual contact.

Triple knots at both ends of the interval ensure that the curve interpolates the end points In mathematics, a spline is a special function defined piecewise by polynomials. In interpolating problems, spline interpolation is often preferred to polynomial interpolation because it yields similar results, even when using low degree polynomials, while avoiding Runge's phenomenon for higher degrees. In the computer science subfields of computer-aided design and computer graphics, the term spline more frequently refers to a piecewise polynomial (parametric) curve. Splines are popular curves in these subfields because of the simplicity of their construction, their ease and accuracy of evaluation, and their capacity to approximate complex shapes through curve fitting and interactive curve design. The term spline comes from the flexible spline devices used by shipbuilders and draftsmen to draw smooth shapes. Introduction The term \\"spline\\" is used to refer to a wide class of functions that are used in applications requiring data interpolation and/or smoothing. The data may be either one-dimensional or multi-dimensional. Spline functions for interpolation are normally determined as the minimizers of suitable measures of roughness (for example integral squared curvature) subject to the interpolation constraints. Smoothing splines may be viewed as generalizations of interpolation splines where the functions are determined to minimize a weighted combination of the average squared approximation error over observed data and the roughness measure. For a number of meaningful definitions of the roughness measure, the spline functions are found to be finite dimensional in nature, which is the primary reason for their utility in computations and representation. For the rest of this section, we focus entirely on one-dimensional, polynomial splines and use the term \\"spline\\" in this restricted sense.  Definition  We begin by limiting our discussion to the univariate polynomial case. In this case, a spline is a piecewise polynomial function. This function, call it S, takes values from an interval [a,b] and maps them to \\\\mathbb{R}, the set of real numbers, :S: [a,b]\\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}. We want S to be piecewise defined. To accomplish this, let the interval [a,b] be covered by k ordered subintervals with pairwise disjoint interiors, :[t_i, t_{i+1}] \\\\mbox{ , } i = 0,\\\\ldots, k-1 :[a,b] = [t_0,t_1] \\\\cup [t_1,t_2] \\\\cup \\\\cdots \\\\cup [t_{k-2},t_{k-1}] \\\\cup [t_{k-1},t_k] :a = t_0 \\\\le t_1 \\\\le \\\\cdots \\\\le t_{k-1} \\\\le t_k = b On each of these k \\"pieces\\" of [a,b], we want to define a polynomial, call it Pi. :P_i: [t_i, t_{i+1}]\\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}. On the ith subinterval of [a,b], S is defined by Pi, :S(t) = P_0 (t) \\\\mbox{ , } t_0 \\\\le t < t_1, :S(t) = P_1 (t) \\\\mbox{ , } t_1 \\\\le t < t_2, :\\\\vdots :S(t) = P_{k-1} (t) \\\\mbox{ , } t_{k-1} \\\\le t \\\\le t_k. The given k+1 points ti are called knots. The vector {\\\\bold t}=(t_0, \\\\dots, t_k) is called a knot vector for the spline. If the knots are equidistantly distributed in the interval [a,b] we say the spline is uniform, otherwise we say it is non-uniform. If the polynomial pieces Pi each have degree at most n, then the spline is said to be of degree \\\\leq n (or of order n+1). If S\\\\in C^{r_i} in a neighborhood of ti, then the spline is said to be of smoothness (at least) C^{r_i} at ti. That is, at ti the two pieces Pi-1 and Pi share common derivative values from the derivative of order 0 (the function value) up through the derivative of order ri (in other words, the two adjacent polynomial pieces connect with loss of smoothness of at most n - ri). A vector {\\\\bold r}=(r_1, \\\\dots, r_{k-1}) such that the spline has smoothness C^{r_i} at ti for i = 0,\\\\ldots, k-1 is called a smoothness vector for the spline. Given a knot vector {\\\\bold t}, a degree n, and a smoothness vector {\\\\bold r} for {\\\\bold t}, one can consider the set of all splines of degree \\\\leq n having knot vector {\\\\bold t} and smoothness vector {\\\\bold r}. Equipped with the operation of adding two functions (pointwise addition) and taking real multiples of functions, this set becomes a real vector space. This spline space is commonly denoted by S^{\\\\bold r}_n({\\\\bold t}). In the mathematical study of polynomial splines the question of what happens when two knots, say ti and ti+1, are moved together has an easy answer. The polynomial piece Pi(t) disappears, and the pieces Pi‚àí1(t) and Pi+1(t) join with the sum of the continuity losses for ti and ti+1. That is, : S(t) \\\\in C^{n-j_i-j_{i+1}} [t_i = t_{i+1}], where j_i = n - r_i This leads to a more general understanding of a knot vector. The continuity loss at any point can be considered to be the result of multiple knots located at that point, and a spline type can be completely characterized by its degree n and its extended knot vector : (t_0 , t_1 , \\\\cdots , t_1 , t_2, \\\\cdots , t_2 , t_3 , \\\\cdots , t_{k-2} , t_{k-1} , \\\\cdots , t_{k-1} , t_k) where ti is repeated ji times for i = 1, \\\\dots , k-1. A parametric curve on the interval [a,b] :G(t) = ( X(t), Y(t) ) \\\\mbox{ , } t \\\\in [ a , b ] is a spline curve if both X and Y are spline functions of the same degree with the same extended knot vectors on that interval. Examples Suppose the interval [a,b] is [0,3] and the subintervals are [0,1], [1,2], and [2,3]. Suppose the polynomial pieces are to be of degree 2, and the pieces on [0,1] and [1,2] must join in value and first derivative (at t=1) while the pieces on [1,2] and [2,3] join simply in value (at t = 2). This would define a type of spline S(t) for which :S(t) = P_0 (t) = -1+4t-t^2 \\\\mbox{ , } 0 \\\\le t < 1 :S(t) = P_1 (t) = 2t \\\\mbox{ , } 1 \\\\le t < 2 :S(t) = P_2 (t) = 2-t+t^2 \\\\mbox{ , } 2 \\\\le t \\\\le 3 would be a member of that type, and also :S(t) = P_0 (t) = -2-2t^2 \\\\mbox{ , } 0 \\\\le t < 1 :S(t) = P_1 (t) = 1-6t+t^2 \\\\mbox{ , } 1 \\\\le t < 2 :S(t) = P_2 (t) = -1+t-2t^2 \\\\mbox{ , } 2 \\\\le t \\\\le 3 would be a member of that type. (Note: while the polynomial piece 2t is not quadratic, the result is still called a quadratic spline. This demonstrates that the degree of a spline is the maximum degree of its polynomial parts.) The extended knot vector for this type of spline would be (0, 1, 2, 2, 3). The simplest spline has degree 0. It is also called a step function. The next most simple spline has degree 1. It is also called a linear spline. A closed linear spline (i.e, the first knot and the last are the same) in the plane is just a polygon. A common spline is the natural cubic spline of degree 3 with continuity C2. The word \\"natural\\" means that the second derivatives of the spline polynomials are set equal to zero at the endpoints of the interval of interpolation :S(a) \\\\, = S(b) = 0. This forces the spline to be a straight line outside of the interval, while not disrupting its smoothness. Algorithm for computing natural cubic splines Cubic splines are of the form {S}_{j} \\\\left ( x \\\\right ) = a_j + b_j \\\\left ( x-x_j \\\\right ) + c_j {\\\\left ( x-x_j \\\\right ) }^{2} + d_j {\\\\left ( x-x_j \\\\right ) }^{3}. Given set of coordinates C= \\\\left[ \\\\left ( {x}_{0},{y}_{0} \\\\right ) , \\\\left ( {x}_{1},{y}_{1} \\\\right ) , .... , \\\\left ( {x}_{n},{y}_{n} \\\\right ) \\\\right ] we wish to find set of n \\\\, splines {S}_{i} \\\\left ( x \\\\right ) for i = 0 , \\\\ldots , n-1. These must satisfy: * S_i \\\\left (x_i \\\\right) = y_i = S_{i-1}\\\\left (x_i \\\\right ), i = 1 , \\\\ldots , n-1. *S_i' \\\\left (x_i \\\\right) = S_{i-1}'\\\\left (x_i \\\\right ), i = 1 , \\\\ldots , n-1. *S_i \\\\left (x_i \\\\right) = S_{i-1}\\\\left (x_i \\\\right ), i = 1 , \\\\ldots , n-1. *S_0 \\\\left (x_0 \\\\right) = S_{n-1} \\\\left (x_n \\\\right ) =0. Let us define one cubic spline S \\\\, as a 5-tuple (a,b,c,d,x_t) \\\\, where a,b,c \\\\, and d \\\\, correspond to coefficients in the form shown earlier and x_t \\\\, is equal to x_j. \\\\, Algorithm for computing Natural Cubic Splines: Input: set of coordinates C \\\\,, with \\\\left  C \\\\right  =n+1 Output: set splines which is composed of n 5-tuples. # Create new array a of size n + 1 and for i = 0 , \\\\ldots , n set a_i = y_i \\\\, # Create new arrays b and d each of size n. # Create new array h of size n and for i = 0 , \\\\ldots , n-1 set h_i = x_{i+1} - x_i \\\\, # Create new array Œ± of size n and for i = 1 , \\\\ldots , n-1 set { \\\\alpha }_{i}= \\\\frac{3 }{{h}_{i} } \\\\left ( {a}_{i+1}-{a}_{i} \\\\right ) - \\\\frac{3 }{{h}_{i-1} } \\\\left ( {a}_{i}-{a}_{i-1} \\\\right ) . # Create new arrays c, l, Œº, and z each of size n+1 \\\\,. # Set l_0 = 1, {\\\\mu}_0 = z_0 = 0 \\\\, # For i = 1 , \\\\ldots , n-1 \\\\, ## Set { l}_{i } =2 \\\\left ( {x}_{i+1}-{x}_{i-1} \\\\right ) - {h}_{i-1}{\\\\mu}_{i-1}. ## Set {\\\\mu}_{i}= \\\\frac{ {h}_{i}}{{l}_{i} } . ## Set {z}_{i} = \\\\frac{ {\\\\alpha}_{i}-{h}_{i-1}{z}_{i-1}}{{l}_{i} } . # Set l_n = 1; z_n = c_n = 0. \\\\, # For j = n-1 , n-2 , \\\\ldots , 0 ## Set c_j = z_j - {\\\\mu}_j c_{j+1} \\\\, ## Set b_j = \\\\frac{{a}_{j+1}-{a}_{j} }{{h}_{j} } - \\\\frac{ {h}_{j} \\\\left ( {c}_{j+1} +2{c}_{j} \\\\right ) }{ 3} ## Set d_j = \\\\frac{{c}_{j+1}-{c}_{j} }{3{h}_{j} } # Create new set Splines and call it output_set. Populate it with n splines S. # For i = 0 , \\\\ldots , n-1 ## Set Si,a = ai ## Set Si,b = bi ## Set Si,c = ci ## Set Si,d = di ## Set Si,x = xi # Output output_set Notes It might be asked what meaning more than n multiple knots in a knot vector have, since this would lead to continuities like :S(t) \\\\in C^{-m} \\\\mbox{ , } m > 0 at the location of this high multiplicity. By convention, any such situation indicates a simple discontinuity between the two adjacent polynomial pieces. This means that if a knot ti appears more than n + 1 times in an extended knot vector, all instances of it in excess of the (n + 1)th can be removed without changing the character of the spline, since all multiplicities n + 1, n + 2, n + 3, etc. have the same meaning. It is commonly assumed that any knot vector defining any type of spline has been culled in this fashion. The classical spline type of degree n used in numerical analysis has continuity :S(t) \\\\in \\\\mathrm{C}^{n-1} [a,b],\\\\, which means that every two adjacent polynomial pieces meet in their value and first n - 1 derivatives at each knot. The mathematical spline that most closely models the flat spline is a cubic (n = 3), twice continuously differentiable (C2), natural spline, which is a spline of this classical type with additional conditions imposed at endpoints a and b. Another type of spline that is much used in graphics, for example in drawing programs such as Adobe Illustrator from Adobe Systems, has pieces that are cubic but has continuity only at most :S(t) \\\\in \\\\mathrm{C}^{1} [a,b]. This spline type is also used in PostScript as well as in the definition of some computer typographic fonts. Many computer-aided design systems that are designed for high-end graphics and animation use extended knot vectors, for example Maya from Alias. Computer-aided design systems often use an extended concept of a spline known as a Nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS). If sampled data from a function or a physical object is available, spline interpolation is an approach to creating a spline that approximates that data. General Expression For a C2 Interpolating Cubic Spline The general expression for the ith C2 interpolating cubic spline at a point x with the natural condition can be found using the formula :S_i(x)= \\\\frac{z_i(x-t_{i-1})^3}{6h_i} +\\\\frac{z_{i-1}(t_i-x)^3}{6h_i}+\\\\left[ \\\\frac{f(t_i)}{h_i}-\\\\frac{z_ih_i}{6}\\\\right](x-t_{i-1})+\\\\left[ \\\\frac{f(t_{i-1})}{h_i}-\\\\frac{z_{i-1}h_i}{6}\\\\right](t_i-x) where * z_i = f^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}(t_i) are the values of the second derivative at the ith knot. * h_i^{} = t_i-t_{i-1} * f(t_i^{}) are the values of the function at the ith knot. Representations and Names  For a given interval [a,b] and a given extended knot vector on that interval, the splines of degree n form a vector space. Briefly this means that adding any two splines of a given type produces spline of that given type, and multiplying a spline of a given type by any constant produces a spline of that given type. The dimension of the space containing all splines of a certain type can be counted from the extended knot vector: : a = t_0 < \\\\underbrace{t_1 = \\\\cdots = t_1}_{j_1} < \\\\cdots < \\\\underbrace{t_{k-2} =\\\\cdots =t_{k-2}}_{j_{k-2}} < t_{k-1} = b : j_i \\\\le n+1 ~,~~ i=1,\\\\ldots,k-2. The dimension is equal to the sum of the degree plus the multiplicities :d = n + \\\\sum_{i=1}^{k-2} j_i. If a type of spline has additional linear conditions imposed upon it, then the resulting spline will lie in a subspace. The space of all natural cubic splines, for instance, is a subspace of the space of all cubic C2 splines. The literature of splines is replete with names for special types of splines. These names have been associated with: * The choices made for representing the spline, for example: ** using basis functions for the entire spline (giving us the name B-splines) ** using Bernstein polynomials as employed by Pierre B√©zier to represent each polynomial piece (giving us the name B√©zier splines) * The choices made in forming the extended knot vector, for example: ** using single knots for Cn-1 continuity and spacing these knots evenly on [a,b] (giving us uniform splines) ** using knots with no restriction on spacing (giving us nonuniform splines) * Any special conditions imposed on the spline, for example: ** enforcing zero second derivatives at a and b (giving us natural splines) ** requiring that given data values be on the spline (giving us interpolating splines) Often a special name was chosen for a type of spline satisfying two or more of the main items above. For example, the Hermite spline is a spline that is expressed using Hermite polynomials to represent each of the individual polynomial pieces. These are most often used with n = 3; that is, as Cubic Hermite splines. In this degree they may additionally be chosen to be only tangent-continuous (C1); which implies that all interior knots are double. Several methods have been invented to fit such splines to given data points; that is, to make them into interpolating splines, and to do so by estimating plausible tangent values where each two polynomial pieces meet (giving us Cardinal splines, Catmull-Rom splines, and Kochanek-Bartels splines, depending on the method used). For each of the representations, some means of evaluation must be found so that values of the spline can be produced on demand. For those representations that express each individual polynomial piece Pi(t) in terms of some basis for the degree n polynomials, this is conceptually straightforward: * For a given value of the argument t, find the interval in which it lies t \\\\in [t_i,t_{i+1}] * Look up the polynomial basis chosen for that interval P_0, \\\\ldots, P_{k-2} * Find the value of each basis polynomial at t: P_0(t), \\\\ldots, P_{k-2}(t) * Look up the coefficients of the linear combination of those basis polynomials that give the spline on that interval c0, ..., ck-2 * Add up that linear combination of basis polynomial values to get the value of the spline at t: :\\\\sum_{j=0}^{k-2} c_j P_j(t). However, the evaluation and summation steps are often combined in clever ways. For example, Bernstein polynomials are a basis for polynomials that can be evaluated in linear combinations efficiently using special recurrence relations. This is the essence of De Casteljau's algorithm, which features in B√©zier curves and B√©zier splines. For a representation that defines a spline as a linear combination of basis splines, however, something more sophisticated is needed. The de Boor algorithm is an efficient method for evaluating B-splines. History Before computers were used, numerical calculations were done by hand. Although piecewise-defined functions like the sign function or step function were used, polynomials were generally preferred because they were easier to work with. Through the advent of computers splines have gained importance. They were first used as a replacement for polynomials in interpolation, then as a tool to construct smooth and flexible shapes in computer graphics. It is commonly accepted that the first mathematical reference to splines is the 1946 paper by Schoenberg, which is probably the first place that the word \\"spline\\" is used in connection with smooth, piecewise polynomial approximation. However, the ideas have their roots in the aircraft and shipbuilding industries. In the foreword to (Bartels et al., 1987), Robin Forrest describes \\"lofting\\", a technique used in the British aircraft industry during World War II to construct templates for airplanes by passing thin wooden strips (called \\"splines\\") through points laid out on the floor of a large design loft, a technique borrowed from ship-hull design. For years the practice of ship design had employed models to design in the small. The successful design was then plotted on graph paper and the key points of the plot were re-plotted on larger graph paper to full size. The thin wooden strips provided an interpolation of the key points into smooth curves. The strips would be held in place at discrete points (called \\"ducks\\" by Forrest; Schoenberg used \\"dogs\\" or \\"rats\\") and between these points would assume shapes of minimum strain energy. According to Forrest, one possible impetus for a mathematical model for this process was the potential loss of the critical design components for an entire aircraft should the loft be hit by an enemy bomb. This gave rise to \\"conic lofting\\", which used conic sections to model the position of the curve between the ducks. Conic lofting was replaced by what we would call splines in the early 1960s based on work by J. C. Ferguson at Boeing and (somewhat later) by M.A. Sabin at British Aircraft Corporation. The word \\"spline\\" was originally an East Anglian dialect word. The use of splines for modeling automobile bodies seems to have several independent beginnings. Credit is claimed on behalf of de Casteljau at Citro√´n, Pierre B√©zier at Renault, and Birkhoff, Garabedian, and de Boor at General Motors (see Birkhoff and de Boor, 1965), all for work occurring in the very early 1960s or late 1950s. At least one of de Casteljau's papers was published, but not widely, in 1959. De Boor's work at General Motors resulted in a number of papers being published in the early 1960s, including some of the fundamental work on B-splines. Work was also being done at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft, where two of the authors of (Ahlberg et al., 1967) ‚Äî the first book-length treatment of splines ‚Äî were employed, and the David Taylor Model Basin, by Feodor Theilheimer. The work at General Motors is detailed nicely in (Birkhoff, 1990) and (Young, 1997). Davis (1997) summarizes some of this material.

The party was originally called the New People's Party until changing its name in 1980. History The new party, formed by the pro-EEC minority of the Liberal Party, originally wanted to call itself the \\"Popular Party - New Liberals\\" (Folkepartiet Nye Venstre), but was denied the use of this name, as it was deemed too similar to the Liberal Party, which in Norway is called \\"Venstre\\" (literally \\"Left\\"). Instead, the party called itself the New People's Party (Det Nye Folkepartiet). The name was in 1980 changed to the Liberal People's Party. At the time of the split, eight of the thirteen Liberal Party MPs joined the new party. At the 1973 parliamentary election, the Liberal People's Party however won merely one seat, from Hordaland (the Liberal Party won two seats). At the next election, in 1977, the Liberal People's Party lost this seat, and was never represented in Parliament again. The party's popularity declined throughout the 1980s. In the local elections in 1987 the two parties ran on common lists in several counties and municipalities. In 1988, it was decided to officially merge back together with the Liberal Party. In 1992, some of the old members decided to recreate DLF, reviving the Liberal People's Party name.

From 1992 to 1994 he also was federal spokesperson of the Greens. His main area of interest is legal matters and political corruption. Commonly known wearing a black jacket and a red, grey or green T-shirt, he was the first Austrian politician to keep a blog on the Internet. In January 2005, Pilz made international news when he called for Arnold Schwarzenegger to be stripped of his Austrian citizenship. As Governor of California, Schwarzenegger had refused to intercede in the execution of a convicted murderer, Donald Beardslee. Pilz pointed to an Austrian law which prohibits any Austrian from taking part in, or ordering, an execution. A few months later, Pilz claimed that a person whom he called \\"Zeuge D\\" (German: \\"witness D\\") has information that Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had participated in the murder of 3 Kurds in Vienna in 1989. According to him the Austrian police had already contacted the witness, who supposedly lived in France, but this was denied by the Austrian Ministry of Justice. On 25 July 2017, with the disappointment of Green leadership and lack of responses in refugee and migrant crisis, he announced his independent campaign for the elections to the Austrian parliament in the autumn. He headed the Peter Pilz List, a group of intellectuals, artists and entrepreneurs, critical toward the establishment.

Early life Lilburn was born in Whanganui and spent his early years on the family sheep farm in the upper Turakina River valley at Drysdale. He attended Waitaki Boys' High School from 1930 to 1933, before moving to Christchurch to study journalism and music over the next three years at Canterbury University College, then part of the University of New Zealand. In 1936 his career in music was set when his tone poem Forest won visiting composer Percy Grainger's national composition competition. In 1937 he began studying at the Royal College of Music in London, tutored in composition by Ralph Vaughan Williams until 1939. The two men remained close: in later years Lilburn would send Vaughan Williams gifts of New Zealand honey, knowing that the older man was fond of it. Career Lilburn returned to New Zealand in 1940 and served as guest conductor in Wellington for three months with the NBS String Orchestra. He shifted to Christchurch in 1941 and worked as a freelance composer and teacher until 1947. Between 1946 and 1949 and again in 1951, Lilburn was Composer-in-Residence at the Cambridge Summer Music Schools. During these years he was heavily involved in New Zealand arts activity, and became friends with other artists such as Allen Curnow, Denis Glover, Rita Angus, and Alistair Campbell. In 1947, Lilburn shifted to Wellington to take up a position at Victoria University as part-time lecturer in music. He became a full-time lecturer in 1949, senior lecturer in 1955, was appointed Associate Professor of Music in 1963 and Professor with a personal chair in music in 1970. Following visits to studios in Europe and Canada in 1963, Lilburn founded the electronic music studio at the university‚Äîthe first in Australasia‚Äîin 1966 and was its director until 1979, a year before his retirement. Later years Lilburn was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Otago in 1969 and in 1978 was presented with the Citation for Services to New Zealand Music by the Composers Association of New Zealand. On 6 February 1988, Lilburn was the eighth appointee to The Order of New Zealand.\\"The Order of New Zealand\\" (12 February 1988) 23 New Zealand Gazette 447 at 448.

As a schoolteacher, she became known for her \\"Blue eyes/Brown eyes\\" exercise. She first conducted her famous exercise for her class on April 5, 1968, the day after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. When her local newspaper published compositions that the children had written about the experience, the reactions (both positive and negative) formed the basis for her career as a public speaker against discrimination. Elliott's classroom exercise was filmed the third time she held it with her third-graders in 1970, becoming the documentary The Eye of the Storm. This in turn inspired a retrospective that reunited the 1970 class members with their teacher fifteen years later in \\"A Class Divided\\", an episode of the PBS series Frontline. After leaving her school, Elliott became a full-time diversity educator. She still holds the exercise and gives lectures about its effects all over the U.S. as well as in several locations overseas.An Unfinished Crusade, PBS, December 19, 2002 She has conducted the exercise with college students, as seen in the 2001 documentary The Angry Eye. Early life and career Elliott was born in 1933 to Lloyd and Margaret (Benson) Jennison on her family's farm in or near Riceville, Iowa. Her father, who delivered her, was Irish-American. She was the fourth of several children. In 1952, after graduating from high school, Elliott attended the Iowa State Teachers College (now the University of Northern Iowa), where she attained an emergency elementary teaching certificate in five quarters. In 1953, she began her teaching career in a one- room school in Randall. Motivation to teach about racism's effects On the evening of April 4, 1968, Elliott turned on her television and learned of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. She says that she vividly remembers a scene in which a white reporter pointed his microphone toward a local black leader and asked things like \\"When our leader [John F. Kennedy] was killed several years ago, his widow held us together. Who's going to control your people?\\" She then decided to combine a lesson that she had planned about Native Americans with a lesson that she had planned about Martin Luther King Jr. for February's Hero of the Month project. At the moment she was watching the news of King's death, Elliott says she was ironing a teepee for use in a lesson unit about Native Americans. To tie the two lessons together, she used the Sioux prayer \\"Oh great spirit, keep me from ever judging a man until I have walked in his moccasins.\\" She wanted to give her small-town, all-white students the experience of walking in a \\"colored child's moccasins for a day\\". First exercise involving eye color and brown collars Steven Armstrong was the first child to arrive in Elliott's classroom; (referring to Martin Luther King Jr.) he asked \\"Why'd they shoot that King?\\" After the rest of the class arrived, Elliott asked them how they think it feels to be a black boy or girl. She suggested to the class that it would be hard for them to understand discrimination without experiencing it themselves and then asked the children if they would like to find out. The children agreed with a chorus of \\"yeahs.\\" She decided to base the exercise on eye color rather than skin color to show the children what racial segregation would be like. On the first day of the exercise, she designated the brown-eyed children as the superior group. Elliott provided blue fabric collars and asked the brown-eyed students to wrap them around the necks of their blue-eyed peers as a method to easily identify the minority group. She gave the brown-eyed children extra privileges, such as second helpings at lunch, access to the new jungle gym, and five extra minutes at recess. The brown-eyed children sat in the front of the classroom, and the blue-eyed children were sent to sit in the back rows. The brown-eyed children were encouraged to play only with other brown-eyed children and to ignore those with blue eyes. Elliott would not allow brown-eyed and blue-eyed children to drink from the same water fountain and often chastised the blue- eyed students when they did not follow the exercise's rules or made mistakes. She often exemplified the differences between the two groups by singling out students and would use negative aspects of blue-eyed children to emphasize a point. At first, there was resistance among the students in the minority group to the idea that brown-eyed children were better than blue-eyed children. To counter this, Elliott lied to the children by stating that melanin was linked to their higher intelligence and learning ability. Shortly thereafter, this initial resistance fell away. Those who were deemed \\"superior\\" became arrogant, bossy, and otherwise unpleasant to their \\"inferior\\" classmates. Their grades on simple tests were better, and they completed mathematical and reading tasks that had seemed outside their ability before. The \\"inferior\\" classmates also transformed ‚Äì into timid and subservient children who scored more poorly on tests, and even during recess isolated themselves, including those who had previously been dominant in the class. These children's academic performance suffered, even with tasks that had been simple before.Peters, Williams. A Class Divided: Then and now: 1st Edition. Yale University Press, 1987 The next Monday, Elliott reversed the exercise, making the blue-eyed children superior. While the blue-eyed children did taunt the brown-eyed children in ways similar to what had occurred the previous day, Elliott reports it was much less intense. At 2:30 on that Wednesday, Elliott told the brown-eyed children to take off their collars. To reflect on the experience, she asked the children to write down what they had learned. Reactions and public attention The compositions that the children wrote about the experience were printed in the Riceville Recorder on page 4 on April 18, 1968, under the headline \\"How Discrimination Feels\\", and the story was picked up by the Associated Press. Because of the Associated Press article, Elliott was invited to appear on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. After she spoke about her exercise in a short interview segment, the audience reaction was instant as hundreds of calls came into the show's telephone switchboard, much of it negative. An often-quoted letter stated, \\"How dare you try this cruel experiment out on white children? Black children grow up accustomed to such behavior, but white children, there's no way they could possibly understand it. It's cruel to white children and will cause them great psychological damage.\\" The publicity that Elliott was getting did not make her popular in Riceville. When she walked into the teachers' lounge the day after her Tonight Show appearance, several other teachers walked out. When she went downtown to do errands, she heard whispers. When her oldest daughter went to the girls' bathroom in junior high, she came out of a stall to see a hateful message scrawled in red lipstick for her on the mirror. Of all her coworkers, Elliott states that only one of them, Ruth Setka, continued to speak to her after her exercise went public. Setka said that she realized she was the only one who kept speaking to her. Setka believed that the reason Eliott's exercise got so much backlash was because the students were very young and that the exercise should have been done on at least junior high school-aged students. In a 2003 interview, Elliot said that about 20% of the Riceville community were still furious with her over what she did on April 4, and some still called her \\"nigger lover\\", but she was grateful for the other 80%. However, as news of her exercise spread, she appeared on more television shows and started to repeat the exercise in professional training days for adults. On December 15, 1970, Elliott staged the experience to adult educators at a White House Conference on Children and Youth. In 1970, ABC produced a documentary about Elliott called The Eye of the Storm, which made her even more nationally known. Subsequently, William Peters wrote two books‚ÄîA Class Divided and A Class Divided: Then and Now‚Äîabout her and the exercise. A Class Divided was turned into a PBS Frontline documentary in 1985 and included a reunion of the schoolchildren featured in The Eye of the Storm, for which Elliott received The Hillman Prize. A televised edition of the exercise was shown on Channel 4 on October 29, 2009, entitled The Event: How Racist Are You?\\"The Event: How Racist Are You?\\", channel4.com, accessed October 30, 2009 This documentary was intended, according to the producers in their agreement with Jane Elliott, to create an awareness of the effects of racist behavior. After the exercise, Elliott said that the result \\"wasn't as successful as I am accustomed to being\\",Jane Elliott, the American schoolmarm who would rid us of our racism, Andrew Anthony, The Observer, Sunday October 18, 2009 leaving journalist Andrew Anthony with the \\"nagging suspicion that she's more excited by white fear than she is by black success.\\" Elliott was featured by Peter Jennings on ABC as \\"Person of the Week\\" on April 24, 1992. She is listed on the timeline of 30 notable educators by textbook editor McGraw-Hill along with Confucius, Plato, Booker T. Washington, and Maria Montessori. She has been invited to speak at 350 colleges and universities and has appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show five times. In November 2016, Elliott's name was added to the BBC's annual list of 100 Women. Origin of workplace diversity training Elliott is considered to be the forerunner of diversity training, with the \\"Blue Eyes/Brown Eyes\\" exercise as the basis of much of what is now called diversity training. She has done such training for corporations such as General Electric, Exxon, AT&T;, and IBM, as well as lectured to the FBI, IRS, US Navy, US Department of Education, and US Postal Service. The Riceville school system granted Elliott unpaid leave to conduct workshops and training that were based on her exercise to organizations outside of her school system. However, the increasing demands to be away from the classroom eventually caused problems with her public school teaching career. Elliott left teaching in the mid-1980s to devote herself full-time to diversity training, redeveloping her classroom exercise for the corporate world. This was promoted positively as a way to promote teamwork, profits, and a \\"winning together\\" atmosphere. For this corporate exercise, Elliott divides a multiracial group based on the color of their eyes and then subjects the blue-eyed individuals to a withering regime of humiliation and contempt. In only a few hours, Elliott's treatment makes the blue-eyed workers become distracted and despondent, stumbling over the simplest commands.The Essential Blue-Eyed, DVD-description by the official distributor's site for the DVD Companies found the idea of offering such training attractive, not only because in the 1970s and 1980s there were increasing numbers of people of color in their organizations, but also because of U.S. court rulings and federal policies to promote multiculturalism brought about by pressure from civil rights groups during the same two decades.NLPC Special Report The Authoritarian Roots of Corporate Diversity Training by the National Legal and Policy Center by Dr. Carl F. Horowitz Many companies at that time came to see diversity training as a way to ward off negative legal action and publicity. Elliott said, \\"If you can't think of any other reason for getting rid of racism, think of it as a real money saver.\\" Elliott- inspired diversity training has been used outside the United States. When the Race Relations Amendment Act 2000 passed in the United Kingdom, it listed 100 diversity training firms in the Diversity Directory. According to a survey by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, 70% of those firms have diversity policies in which diversity training plays a major role. Many of these courses follow Elliott's model in regards to understanding the issues presented. Legacy of the original exercise Dean Weaver, who was superintendent of Riceville schools from 1972 to 1979, thought she was an outstanding teacher who did things differently and made other teachers envious of her success. Ex-principal Steve Harnack commented that she was excellent at teaching academics and suggested she would have had fewer problems with the community if she had involved parents. Elliott's former colleague Ruth Setka commented on Riceville's attitude on Elliott, \\"Everyone's tired of her. I'm tired of hearing about her and her experiment and how everyone here is a racist. That's not true. Let's just move on.\\" Academic research into the \\"Blue Eyes/Brown Eyes\\" exercise Academic research into Elliott's exercise shows moderate results in reducing long-term prejudice but is inconclusive on the question of whether the possible psychological harm outweighs the potential benefits.Prejudice-Reduction Simulations: Ethics, Evaluations, and Theory into Practice by Deborah A. Byrnes and Gary Kiger; Utah State University, Simulation & Gaming December 1992 vol. 23 no. 4 457‚Äì471Prejudice- Reduction Simulations: Social Cognition, Intergroup Theory, and Ethics, by Angie Williams, Howard Giles, University of California, Simulation & Gaming, December 1992 vol. 23 no. 4 472‚Äì484 Two professors of education in England, Ivor Goodson and Pat Sikes, argue that what Elliott did was unethical, calling the exercise psychologically and emotionally damaging. They also stated ethical concerns pertaining to the fact that the children were not told of the purpose of the exercise beforehand. Measured results of the diversity training for adults are moderate. The outcomes of a 1990 research study by the Utah State University were that virtually all the subjects reported that the experience was meaningful for them. However, the statistical evidence supporting the effectiveness of the activity for prejudice reduction was moderate; and virtually all the participants, as well as the simulation facilitator, reported stress from the simulation. Another program evaluation in 2003, conducted by Tracie Stewart at the University of Georgia, showed that white college students had significantly more positive attitudes toward Asian- American and Latino individuals, but only marginally more positive attitudes toward African-American individuals. In some courses, participants can feel frustrated about \\"their inability to change\\" and instead begin to feel anger against the very groups to which they are supposed to be more sensitive. It can also lead to anxiety because people become hyper-sensitive about being offensive or being offended. There are not very good measures of effects on long-term outcomes of these training initiatives. In a 2003 study, Murdoch University did not include the \\"Blue Eyes/Brown Eyes\\" exercise in their list of successful strategies to reduce racism.Anti-Racism ‚Äì What Works?

The group was founded in 1991 by sixteen expelled members of the Socialist Party of Great Britain (SPGB) who claim that their expulsions were the result of an anti-socialist conspiracy. Though small, the group has remained an active and vocal critic of the SPGB since its inception.  The publication  Socialist Studies was first published in 1989 by the Camden and North West London branches of the Socialist Party of Great Britain (SPGB), though since issue ‚Ññ 3 (1991) it has been published by an independent organisation. The early issues consisted primarily of material reprinted from the works of Karl Marx and the Socialist Standard, though the paper now consists of original material. The format has remained the same for the past fifteen years, namely three to twelve A4 sheets of single-column word- processed text, photocopied and folded to produce an A5 booklet. The publication is text-only, with no graphics or photographs, none of the articles have a byline and until the ‚Ññ 35 (Spring 2000) none of the issues were dated.  The group  Harry Baldwin The history of the group now known as Socialist Studies dates to 1991, when the Camden and North West London branches were expelled from the SPGB in a party-wide referendum. Some of these ex members, comprising sixteen individuals, refused to recognise the expulsions and attempted to continue operating as the SPGB, which they claimed to have \\"reconstituted\\".According to a Socialist Studies retrospective article (), the sixteen founder members were J Bell, O Blomley, J D'Arcy, E Hardy, G Howlett, L Lestor, L Frank, A D'Arcy, T D'Arcy, D Davies, M Davies, K Knight, R Lloyd, C May, G Wilson and H Young. Among them were Edgar Hardcastle and Cyril May, who became their central organiser. As the original SPGB had never been dissolved and indeed continued to operate following the expulsions, it successfully mounted various legal challenges against Socialist Studies's use of the SPGB name.The Socialist Party of Great Britain v Britannia Building Society (1993, Edmonton County Court case ‚Ññ ED400825) Because of this and to differentiate itself from the original SPGB, the group has variously referred to itself in its publicity material as the Reconstituted Socialist Party of Great Britain, the New Socialist Party of Great Britain and Socialist Studies. Third parties refer to them as the Socialist Studies group. The group's activity consists primarily of publishing Socialist Studies and various pamphlets and holding occasional propaganda meetings. Socialist Studies was not a registered political party until December 2006, when they registered with the Electoral Commission as Socialist Studies Party (1904). As of 2015, they have never contested a local, national, or European Union election.  Differences with the Socialist Party of Great Britain  Socialist Studies adopted the object and principles of the SPGB and thus claims to hold that party's general ideology and stance on most social, economic and political issues. However, there are several ideological and practical differences between Socialist Studies and the SPGB, most of which arise from the former's narrower interpretation of the object and principles and its views on how strictly these interpretations must be adhered to. For the matters discussed in this section, Socialist Studies generally adopts the position that anyone who does not hold their interpretation cannot be regarded as a true socialist. On the other hand, the SPGB holds that at least some of the following issues are ones upon which genuine socialists may disagree with each other; disagreement with the majority position does not automatically disqualify one from being a socialist or from membership in the party. Socialist Studies's less accommodating stance has been labelled \\"doctrinaire\\", a characterisation which they categorically reject. = Political franchise = The principal ideological disagreement Socialist Studies has with the SPGB is its attitude towards attempts by workers living under political dictatorships to establish elementary democratic and trade union rights, especially in Eastern Europe in the 1980s and early 1990s. The stance of the SPGB since 1939 is summarised by the following 1990 party conference resolution: > This Conference re-affirms the stand taken in the September [actually > October] 1939 Socialist Standard and repeated in the September 1989 > Socialist Standard, that the Socialist Party of Great Britain wholeheartedly > supports the efforts of workers everywhere to secure democratic rights > against the powers of suppression. Whilst we avoid any association with > parties or political groups seeking to administer capitalism, we emphasise > that freedom of movement and expression, the freedom to organise in trade > unions, to organise politically, and to participate in elections, are of > great importance to all workers and are vital to the success of the > socialist movement. On the other hand, Socialist Studies regards the struggle by workers living under a dictatorship to establish some measure of political democracy as a reformist struggle which socialists should oppose. They believe that the difference between democratic capitalist governments and dictatorial capitalist governments is of no significance to workers, that political democracy is not essential for the propagation of socialist ideas and that workers in dictatorships should not directly confront the forces of suppression. Instead, Socialist Studies believes that they must be \\"hostile to such movements for democracy and to call on workers to form instead a socialist political party based on [their] principles\\". The SPGB does not consider Socialist Studies's position to be incompatible with socialism, but rather simply a different (albeit illogical) interpretation of its principles: > Indifference to moves by workers to try to establish a minimum of political > democracy has, once again, been a minority position within the SPGB though > not a matter for expulsion. If [a companion party] were to adopt this > position, we could live with it and would not consider it a matter for its > exclusion from the World Socialist Movement (though we would reserve the > right to criticise it as illogical). = Cooperation with capitalist law = Despite calling for the establishment of socialist political parties, Socialist Studies believes that such parties should not engage in political action which requires use of or active cooperation with what they call \\"capitalist law\\" or \\"bourgeois legislation\\". This arises from their interpretation of Clause 8 of their Declaration of Principles. That clause states that \\"Socialist Studies [...] enters the field of political action\\". The group interprets this as specifically excluding \\"legal or moral action\\" and as \\"overrid[ing] any other consideration\\". In light of this, they accuse the SPGB of being capitalist collaborators for having registered with the Electoral Commission, which is a legal requirement to contest elections in the United Kingdom. Nonetheless, members of the group had previously registered as candidates for parliamentary and council elections when they were members of the SPGB Relevant candidates are H. Baldwin, M. Sansum and H. Young. Relevant candidate is J D'Arcy. and the group itself eventually registered with the Electoral Commission. The group as a whole has also occasionally appealed to the state's legal institutions, such as their 1994 lawsuit against the Britannia Building Society. They have also accused others of \\"criminal libel\\" and have repeatedly indicated that they are prepared to sue, if necessary. = Party name = The SPGB had been using the short form of its name, the Socialist Party, for publicity purposes as far back as 1910. In 1988, the party passed a resolution at its annual conference indicating when to use the full-form and short-form names: the full-form name was to be retained as the official name for use on legal documents and publication credits and the short form was to be used for most other purposes, including election ballots and propaganda. This is analogous to how the Conservative and Unionist Party publicises itself as the Conservative Party. The resolution was made partly to codify an existing practice and partly to avoid what some members considered the nationalistic connotation of Great Britain. Socialist Studies interprets the 1988 resolution as having completely changed the party's name and proscribing the use of the full form. They see this resolution as conflicting with the party's Declaration of Principles, one clause of which mentions the party's full name explicitly. It is largely on this basis that they justified their continued operation as the Socialist Party of Great Britain, claiming that they were expelled from the Socialist Party, not the Socialist Party of Great Britain. They also claim that they are entitled to use the name because the original Socialist Party of Great Britain no longer exists: > The Socialist Party of Great Britain of 52 Clapham High Street, London SW4 > 7UN, is defunct and no longer exists as a political party. It does not > produce political literature, hold propaganda meetings or contest elections. > It cannot exist merely as a name without a body. [...] We are the only > political organisation in this country bearing the title 'The Socialist > Party of Great Britain'. More recently, the 1988 resolution was reversed at a conference in 2008. = Reformism = Socialist Standard, October 1904, editorial \\"The Futility of Reform\\" The SPGB has a longstanding position that it is \\"opposed to a reform programme and to reformist organisations, but not opposed to reforms as such\\". Hence, the party does not campaign for reforms itself since its sole object is the establishment of socialism, but it is not opposed to reforms passed by the government when they are clearly in the interests of the working class. The Socialist Studies group disagrees with this position, explicitly stating that socialist Members of Parliament should vote against reform measures even when they are in the interests of the working class. The SPGB considers Socialist Studies's position on how socialist Members of Parliament should vote to be \\"a legitimate position for a socialist to hold, even though it is not the one that, as a matter of historical fact, has been adopted by the SPGB\\" and \\"do[es] not regard it as a matter for serious dispute\\". = Abolition of the state = Socialist Studies accuses the SPGB of coming under the influence of anarchist ideas and not sufficiently emphasising the parliamentary aspect of the socialist revolution. Socialist Studies claims that the SPGB's position is that the state would be abolished immediately upon the overthrow of class society whereas Socialist Studies's position is that the state would \\"gradually wither away\\" instead. Referring to the SPGB's 1984 conference resolution (since rescinded) that \\"Socialism will entail the immediate abolition of and not the gradual decline of the State\\", Socialist Studies writes: > If you are in favour of the immediate abolition of the State when Socialism > is established then you are in favour of its immediate abolition here and > now, which is of course the anarchist position. [...] Unless Socialists use > the power of the machinery of government to dispossess the capitalist class > they will be unable to establish Socialism. We find it inconceivable that > intelligent Socialists of a future generation would even consider such an > act of monumental stupidity. A page from The Clapham-based Socialist Party ‚Äì Just Another Capitalist Party, one of dozens of Socialist Studies publications attacking the Socialist Party of Great Britain  Relations with the Socialist Party of Great Britain  Much of the material published by Socialist Studies is highly critical and often outright contemptuous of the SPGB, which it refers to as the \\"Clapham- based Socialist Party\\" or the \\"Socialist Party of Clapham\\". The group variously claims that the SPGB is anarchist, reformist, capitalist, fascist, Stalinist, Trotskyist, undemocratic and democracy fetishist. According to Socialist Studies, the SPGB colludes with the Electoral Commission to \\"prevent Socialists [from] carrying out political propaganda on the web\\" and does this because its own propaganda is not being read as widely as that of Socialist Studies. Socialist Studies also claims that the SPGB has a secret de facto leadership of \\"godfathers\\", who conspire to suppress socialist ideas and to destroy Socialist Studies. Socialist Studies has repeatedly called on the SPGB to respond to some of these accusations and to engage in debates on their ideological differences. However, as these calls were made at the time Socialist Studies was still claiming to be the Socialist Party of Great Britain, the SPGB refused to recognise their legitimacy. The only official published comment the SPGB has made on the Socialist Studies group has been in an article devoted to the history of breakaway groups in the centenary issue of the Socialist Standard, which described them as \\"a small group of rather disgruntled ex-members\\".

Found in tropical to subtropical waters throughout the world, the threadfin family contains eight genera and about 40 species. An unrelated species sometimes known by the name threadfin, Alectis indicus, is properly the Indian threadfish (family Carangidae). Ranging in length from in the dwarf threadfin (Parapolynemus verekeri) to in fourfinger threadfin (Eleutheronema tetradactylum) and giant African threadfin (Polydactylus quadrifilis), threadfins are both important to commercial fisheries as a food fish, and popular among anglers. Their habit of forming large schools makes the threadfins a reliable and economic catch. Description Their bodies are elongated and fusiform, with spinous and soft dorsal fins widely separated. Their tail fins are large and deeply forked; indicating speed and agility. The mouth is large and inferior; a blunt snout projects far ahead. The jaws and palate possess bands of villiform (fibrous) teeth. Their most distinguishing feature is their pectoral fins: they are composed of two distinct sections, the lower of which consists of three to seven long, thread-like independent rays. Polynemus species may have up to 15 of these modified rays. Polydactylus sexfilis or moi (sixfinger threadfins), were reserved for Hawaiian royalty or the ali ªi. . In some species, such as the royal threadfin (Pentanemus quinquarius), the thread-like rays may extend well past the tail fin. This feature explains both the common name threadfin and the family name Polynemidae, from the Greek poly meaning \\"many\\" and nema meaning \\"filament\\". Similar species, such as the mullets (family Mugilidae) and milkfish (family Chanidae) can be easily distinguished from threadfins by their lack of filamentous pectoral rays. Distribution and habitat Threadfins frequent open, shallow water in areas with muddy, sandy, or silty bottoms; they are rarely seen at reefs. Their pectoral rays are thought to serve as tactile structures, helping to find prey within the sediments. Noted for being euryhaline, threadfins are able to tolerate a wide range of salinity levels. This attribute allows threadfins to enter estuaries and even rivers. They feed primarily on crustaceans and smaller fish. Reproduction Presumed to be pelagic spawners, threadfins probably release many tiny, buoyant eggs into the water column, which then become part of the plankton. The eggs float freely with the currents until hatching. Cuisine Threadfin has been used as an ingredient in creating crab stick. Mariculture In Hawaii, sixfinger threadfins are the subject of commercial open-ocean cage mariculture. https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v371/p65-72/ https://www.int-

On 25 May 2017 it was announced that the open source support for the project would be discontinued in January 2018 , due to a lack of financial support for that work. The Globus service continues to be available to the research community under a freemium approach, designed to sustain the software, with most features freely available but some restricted to subscribers .  Introduction The Globus toolkit contains a set of libraries and programs that provides the developers of specific tools or apps with solutions for common problems that are encountered when creating a distributed system services and applications. Globus is a software with components and capabilities that includes: #A set of service Implementations that Indicate resource management, data alterations service finding and relevant issues #Tools for building web services #A powerful standards-based security prerequisites for authentication and authorisation. #Various services in java c and python for clients of API and command line programs #Detailed documentation on these various components Standards implementation The Globus Toolkit adheres to or provides implementations of the following standards: * Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) * Open Grid Services Infrastructure (OGSI), originally intended to form the basic ‚Äúplumbing‚Äù layer for OGSA, but has been superseded by WSRF and WS-Management. * Web Services Resource Framework (WSRF) * Job Submission Description Language (JSDL) * Distributed Resource Management Application API (DRMAA) * WS-Management * WS- BaseNotification * SOAP * Web Services Description Language * Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI) The Globus Toolkit has implementations of the OGF-defined protocols to provide: #Resource management: Grid Resource Allocation & Management Protocol (GRAM) #Information Services: Monitoring and Discovery Service (MDS) #Security Services: Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI) #Data Movement and Management: Global Access to Secondary Storage (GASS) and GridFTP The following Globus Toolkit components are supported by the OGF-defined SAGA C++/Python API: # GRAM (2 and 5) via the SAGA job API # GridFTP via the SAGA filesystem API # Replica Location Service via the SAGA C++ Reference Implementation API Compatible third-party software A number of tools can function with Globus Toolkit, including: *SAGA C++ Reference Implementation - The Simple API for Grid Applications *WebCom and WebCom-G *Nimrod tools for meta-scheduling and parametric computing *Gridbus Grid Service Broker *Grid Portal Software such as GridPort, OGCE, GridSphere and P-GRADE Portal *Grid Packaging Toolkit (GPT) *MPICH-G2 (Grid Enabled MPI) *Network Weather Service (NWS) (Quality-of-Service monitoring and statistics) *HTCondor (CPU Cycle Scavenging) and Condor-G (Job Submission) *HPC4U Middleware (Fault Tolerant and SLA aware Grid Middleware) *GridWay metascheduler XML-based web services offer a way to access the diverse services and applications in a distributed environment. In 2004, Univa Corporation began providing commercial support for the Globus Toolkit using a business model similar to that of Red Hat. Job schedulers GRAM (Grid Resource Allocation Manager), a component of the Globus Toolkit, officially supports the following job schedulers or batch- queuing systems: *Portable Batch System, a computer software job scheduler that allocates network resources to batch jobs. * HTCondor High-Throughput Computing System, a software framework for coarse-grained distributed parallelization of computationally intensive tasks. *Platform LSF, a commercial computer software job scheduler. Unofficial job schedulers that can be used with the Globus Toolkit: *Sun Grid Engine, an open source batch- queuing system, supported by Sun Microsystems. Globus does not officially support SGE, but third parties offer methods to integrate it: **The London e-Science Center has created a \\"Transfer-queue over Globus (TOG)\\" package and provides instructions on how to configure a Globus Toolkit 2 or 3 or a Globus Toolkit 4 server so that it can submit jobs for execution on a local Sun Grid Engine installation. * Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM), an open source batch-queuing system originally developed at LLNL and currently managed by SchedMD. Globus can be used with SLURM via shell wrappers.FAQ: Can SLURM be used with Globus? Development plans The Globus Alliance announced a release of Globus Toolkit version 5 (GT5) in late 2009. A major change will be abandoning GRAM4 (although continuing support at least through December, 2010) in favor of an enhanced GRAM2, called GRAM5, which will solve scalability issues and add features. The Reliable File Transfer (RFT) service will be replaced by a new Globus.org service. Globus.org is an online, hosted service (i.e., Software-as-a-Service) that provides higher-level, end-to-end Grid capabilities, initially concentrating on reliable, high-performance, fire-and-forget data transfer. To retain the Web-Service functionality without technology and standards now considered obsolete, a new project called Globus Crux has been started, which expects to release an alpha version by the end of 2009.

The red lion is a symbol of Great Britain and alludes to Bermuda's relationship with that country. The Latin motto under the coat of arms, Quo Fata Ferunt, means \\"Whither the Fates Carry [Us]\\". The wrecked ship is the Sea Venture. The arms were formally granted by Royal Warrant on 4 October 1910, but had been in use since at least 1624. The coat of arms first appears on the cover of the 1624 edition of The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles. The \\"Somers Isles\\" is another name for Bermuda, named after Sir George Somers, the colony's founder.  Blazon  The heraldic blazon is: Argent, on a mount vert a lion sejant affront√© gules supporting between the fore-paws an antique shield azure thereon a representation of the wreck of the ship Sea Venture proper. Sea Venture On 10 April 1591, three ships sailed from Plymouth, England for the East Indies. They were the Penelope, the Merchant Royal, and the Sea Venture. On 2 June 1609, Sea Venture set sail from Plymouth as the flagship of a seven- ship fleet (towing two additional pinnaces) destined for Jamestown, Virginia as part of the Third Supply, carrying 500 to 600 people (it is unclear whether that number includes crew, or only settlers). On 24 July, the fleet ran into a strong storm, likely a hurricane, and the ships were separated. A pinnace, Catch, went down with all aboard lost. Sea Venture however, fought the storm for three days. Comparably sized ships had survived such weather, but Sea Venture had a critical flaw in her newness: her timbers had not set. The caulking was forced from between them, and the ship began to leak rapidly. All hands were applied to bailing, but water continued to rise in the hold. The ship's starboard-side guns were reportedly jettisoned to raise her buoyancy, but this only delayed the inevitable. The Admiral of the Company himself, Sir George Somers, was at the helm through the storm. When he spied land on the morning of 25 July, the water in the hold had risen to 9 feet (2.7 m), and crew and passengers had been driven past the point of exhaustion. Somers deliberately had the ship driven onto the reefs of Discovery Bay, in what later proved to be eastern Bermuda, in order to prevent its foundering. This allowed 150 people, and one dog, to be landed safely ashore. The survivors, including several company officials (Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas Gates,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Thomas_and_Bridges_story_1540_1840.html?id=VThWAAAAMAAJ the ship's captain Christopher Newport, Sylvester Jordain, Stephen Hopkins, later of Mayflower, and secretary William Strachey), were stranded on Bermuda for approximately nine months. The crew cut down Bermuda cedar trees and built a seaworthy craft of eighteen tons. They caulked her seams with lime salvaged from the ship and oil extracted from local turtles they caught for food. They ate turtle meat fish, birds - and wild hogs.  Flag of Bermuda  On 4 October 1910, the coat of arms (without the banner holding the motto) was added to the Red ensign to create the current Flag of Bermuda. The coat of arms replaced a badge which had been in use on the Bermuda red ensign before October 1910. The badge was based on a sketch, made in 1869, of the 1817 seal, which depicted a wet dock of the time showing with some boats in the background. It is assumed that the scene alludes to the fact that the islands were a stopover base for the sailing ships when the badge was approved by the Admiralty.

De Chastelain was born in Romania to Scottish and American parents and was educated in England and Scotland before his family emigrated to Canada in 1954. There, de Chastelain became a Militia private and enrolled in the Royal Military College of Canada, going on to pursue a career in the Canadian Army. He was commissioned into Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry and rose eventually to be twice Chief of the Defence Staff, with a break of a year during which he served as Canada's ambassador to the United States. In 1995, de Chastelain became active in the Northern Ireland peace process and eventually focused on the disarmament of paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland. Early life and education De Chastelain was born in 1937 in Bucharest, Romania, to Alfred Gardyne de Chastelain, a Scottish oil engineer then working in Bucharest for British Petroleum, (later an agent of SOE) and Marion Elizabeth de Chastelain, an American. He was educated in England and later at Fettes College, Edinburgh. The de Chastelain family emigrated to Canada in 1954, and a year later, after finishing his education at Fettes College, De Chastelain joined his family and attended Mount Royal College (now Mount Royal University) in Calgary. He married Mary Ann Laverty. Military On parade with The Calgary Highlanders on 30 June 1990; General de Chastelain (top left) De Chastelain started his military career as a Militia private in the Calgary Highlanders in which he served from January to September 1956. He was enrolled in the Royal Military College of Canada in September 1956 and graduated in 1960 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and a commission in Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (PPCLI), two years before he became a naturalized Canadian. Performing regimental duty in Canada, Germany, and Cyprus, de Chastelain subsequently attended the British Army staff college in Camberley in 1966 and was commanding officer of the Second Battalion PPCLI from 1970 to 1972. As a colonel, he commanded CFB Montreal for a two-year period ending with the 1976 Summer Olympics in that city. He was also Deputy Chief of Staff of the United Nations Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) and Commander of the Canadian contingent there. As a brigadier-general, he successively became Commandant of the Royal Military College of Canada in 1977, Commander of 4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group in Lahr, Germany in 1980 and Director General Land Doctrine and Operations at National Defence Headquarters in Ottawa, Ontario in 1982. As a major-general, de Chastelain was Deputy Commander of the Canadian Army (then called Mobile Command) and Commander of the Mobile Command Division, which was exercised as such in 1985 on Exercise RV '85. As a lieutenant-general, he became Assistant Deputy Minister for Personnel in 1986 and then Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff in 1988. In 1989, he was promoted to the rank of general and appointed Chief of the Defence Staff. In 1993, he transferred to the Reserves and was appointed Ambassador to the United States by Brian Mulroney. In 1994, shortly after the election of Jean Chr√©tien, he was recalled to Regular Force duty and re-appointed Chief of the Defence Staff, replacing Admiral Anderson and vacating the office of Ambassador for Raymond Chr√©tien. de Chastelain served as Chief of Defence Staff until his retirement in December 1995. Civilian Since November 1995, de Chastelain has been involved in the Northern Ireland peace process and from 1997 to 2011 he was Chairman of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning, which was responsible for ensuring the decommissioning of arms by paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland.

(d. 616) was an Anglo-Saxon King of Essex (r. 604 ‚Äì 616), in succession of his father King Sledd. He is known as the first East Saxon king to have been converted to Christianity. The principal source for his reign is the early 8th-century Historia Ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum by Bede (d. 735), who claims to have derived his information about the missionary work of Mellitus among the East Saxons from Abbot Albinus of Canterbury through the London priest Nothhelm, later Archbishop of Canterbury (d. 739).Bede, Historia Ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, Book 2, chapters 3, 5 and 6. Other sources include the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, an East Saxon genealogy possibly of the late 9th century (British Library Add MS 23211), and a handful of genealogies and regnal lists written down by Anglo-Norman historians. Family The genealogies and regnal lists are unanimous in describing S√¶berht as the son of Sledd, who may have been regarded as the founder of the East Saxon dynasty.Yorke, \\"The Kingdom of the East Saxons\\", pp. 15-6. According to Bede, S√¶berht's mother was Ricula, a sister of King √Üthelberht of Kent.Bede, Historia Ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum. Book 2, chapter 3. Bede omits the names of S√¶berht's three sons, who succeeded himBede, Historia Ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum. but two, Sexred and S√¶ward, are named in the genealogy of Add MS 23211.Yorke, \\"The Kingdom of the East Saxons\\", p. 4. Conversion and succession In 604, the churchman Mellitus was consecrated by AugustineFryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 219. as bishop in the province of the East Saxons, which had a capital at London, making him the first Saxon Bishop of London.Brooks Early History of the Church of Canterbury p. 11‚Äì13a Bede tells that S√¶berht converted to Christianity in 604Hindley, Geoffrey A Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons: The beginnings of the English nation New York: Carrol & Graf Publishers 2006 p. 33-36 and was baptised by Mellitus, while his sons remained pagan.Bede, Historia Ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum; Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (MSS A,B and C) s.a. 604. S√¶berht then allowed the bishopric to be established. The episcopal church which was built in London was probably founded by √Üthelberht, rather than S√¶berht, though a charter which claims to be a grant of lands from √Üthelberht to Mellitus is a forgery. Death and burial 1906 plan of Westminster Abbey showing S√¶berht's putative tomb by the entrance of the south ambulatory Both √Üthelberht and S√¶berht died in 616, leaving the Gregorian mission without strong patrons. S√¶berht's pagan sons drove Mellitus from London.Hindley A Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons p. 36 According to Bede's explanation, this happened because Mellitus refused the brothers' request for a taste of the sacramental bread.Brooks \\"Mellitus (d. 624)\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Westminster Abbey Later medieval legend claimed that S√¶berht and his wife Ethelgoda had founded a monastery in London dedicated to St Peter at the site of the present Westminster Abbey, and that they had been buried in the church there. In the reign of Henry III, during rebuilding work in 1245-1272, their supposed remains were transferred into a tomb which the king had especially erected for them in the Chapter House, close to the entrance of the Royal Chapels. The King's remains were reportedly still clothed in royal robes and a ruby thumb ring was seen. In 1308, the bones were said to have been relocated once again to a marble tomb which still stands today in the south ambulatory. There is no genuine evidence to support this tradition however, and modern scholars cast doubt on the claim that S√¶berht's bones were ever genuinely entombed here. Great Burstead There is a local tradition that S√¶berht lived, and was buried at Great Burstead in Essex.A History and Guide to the church of St Mary Magdelene Great BursteadK.D. Box, 24 Essex Churches (Letchworth, 1965), p.48. Prittlewell burial In 2003 a high-status Anglo-Saxon tomb was discovered at Prittlewell, just north of Southend in Essex. The artefacts found were of such a quality that archaeologists surmised that Prittlewell was a tomb of one of the Kings of Essex, and the discovery of golden foil crosses indicates that the inhabitant was an early Christian. As the initial evidence pointed to an early seventh-century date, S√¶berht was considered the most likely candidate for the burial,Channel 4 Time Team, Prittlewell Southend, The name of the kingHolland, Jennifer S., 2005, \\"Crossing Over,\\" National Geographic \\"Geographica,\\" March 2005 although other possibilities such as his Christian grandson Sigeberht the Good, or an unknown individual of high status, were not ruled out.Blair, I., Barham, E., and Blackmore, L.

In May 2019, it was reported that a team of 40 specialists from the Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA) now believe the tomb could have belonged to Seaxa, S√¶berht's brother. Carbon dating had indicated that the tomb was built between 575 and 605, at least 11 years before S√¶berht's death. Further details of the latest research have been published on the MOLA website.

He is well known for his leadership of Continental Airlines and Texas International Airlines, between 1972 and 1990, through airline deregulation. Lorenzo also led the creation and management of the holding company for the group, Texas Air Corporation, through which New York Air was formed in 1980 and Eastern Air Lines was acquired in 1986, as well as Frontier Airlines and People Express Airlines. As an airline manager, he gained a reputation of union acrimony, stemming from his leadership during the 1983 bankruptcy of Continental that enabled the employees to vote out their union contracts, and become a low-cost, successful airline, and during the strike and bankruptcy of Eastern that eventually led to its permanent shutdown in 1991. Lorenzo's airline history is contentious, as he is both \\"despised by unions and admired by airline strategists.\\" In 1990, after Lorenzo liquidated his holdings after 18 years in the airline industry, Alfred E. Kahn, the \\"main architect of airline deregulation,\\" offered this perspective on Lorenzo's leadership: \\"I don‚Äôt think there is any question that he saved Continental, but his tactics obviously didn‚Äôt work when he took over Eastern.\\" Since 1990, Lorenzo has been chairman of Savoy Capital, Inc., professionally devoted to asset management, private investments and venture capital, as well as a number of philanthropic activities. Early life Born to Spanish immigrants Olegario (d. 1980) and Ana (n√©e Mateos, d. 1996), Lorenzo grew up in Queens, New York. His father was a long-time beauty salon proprietor in Manhattan; his mother worked as a hairdresser at their salon. Public High School, Columbia and Harvard Business School Lorenzo attended Forest Hills High School and then worked his way through Columbia University, holding several jobs, including at Macy's as a salesperson and Coca-Cola as a truck driver and member of the Teamster's Union. He graduated in 1961 with a B. A. degree in economics, followed by an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1963, as he was turning 23. Jobs at TWA, Eastern, and the Army Lorenzo's first professional jobs, from 1963‚Äì1966, were at Trans World Airlines, as a Senior Analyst, and then at Eastern Airlines, as Manager of Financial Analysis. He also spent six months in the Army reserve in 1964, and then returned to his job in New York. Lorenzo, Carney & Co. He formed Lorenzo & Carney, Inc., a financial advisory firm specializing in airlines, in 1966 with Robert Carney, who had also attended Harvard Business School. Their first offices were atop the Pan Am Building in New York. The firm participated in the establishment of a supplemental airline, Universal Airways, and also in the refinancing of British West Indian Airlines (BWIA). Jet Capital Lorenzo and Carney later formed Jet Capital Corporation in 1969, initially as an aircraft leasing company. Jet Capital raised $1.5 million in a public stock offering, and was later asked by Chase Manhattan Bank to attempt a refinancing plan for Texas International Airlines (TIA) as an alternative to bankruptcy, as the airline was in default on its aircraft bank loans. Jet Capital put together a refinancing and equity infusion for Texas International Airlines in 1971. Early airline career=Texas International Airlines As part of the refinancing plan for Texas International Airlines (TIA), Jet Capital acquired control of TIA in 1972, and received 26% of TIA's equity interest and 59% of its voting power for $1.15 million. Lorenzo became its president and Carney its executive vice president in August 1972. The deal was approved by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), which regulated the airline industry in the United States at the time, after a contentious CAB approval process fought with Howard Hughes, who at the time controlled America West Airlines. When Lorenzo took control of TIA in 1972, it was on the verge of financial collapse, having lost money since 1966. Two years later, Lorenzo's management was able to steer the company to break even due to significant streamlining of operations.Petzinger Jr., Thomas (1995). Hard landing. Three River Press, New York, 594 p. ISBN 0-8129--2835-0. Some years later an analyst from Oppenheimer & Company, citing Lorenzo and business-partner Carney's strategies of substituting obsolete planes with jets, eliminating unprofitable routes in exchange for destinations with higher demand, and instituting half-price \\"peanut-fares\\" for the first time in the aviation industry, noted TIA's ability to compete and win against much larger and financially stronger companies. TIA also had to compete with a new-at-the-time Texas intrastate airline, Southwest Airlines, which was union free then and had much lower costs. Lorenzo's management changed the character of the airline, having revamped its fleet, increased utilization, cut costs and dropped many losing routes, while adding flights on strong segments. The average trip distance per passenger boarded jumped 25% from 1972 to 1976. In 1977, the company earned $8 million, and in 1978, TIA's reported net income was up to $13.2 million and it was described as an \\"aggressive, innovative carrier\\". TIA implemented in 1977, just before the advent of airline deregulation, the first unrestricted airline low fares, which were called \\"Peanut Fares.\\" The success of this promotion drove major improvement in TIA's financial position. In his book on aviation history, author R.E.G. Davies refers to these fares as \\"...a watershed in airline passenger tariffs.\\" Airline takeover attemptsNational Airlines= A McDonnell Douglas DC-10 of National Airlines at London Heathrow Airport in 1974. In 1978, the airline world was astonished to learn that Lorenzo (TIA) had moved to take over National Airlines, a domestic trunk airline three times its size, having purchased 9.2% of the stock of National Airlines. For several weeks starting in June 1978, Texas International Air had acquired shares of National Airlines, filing documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission when its stake reached just short of the 10% that would require prior approval of the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). TIA was reported at the time to be studying the \\"possibility of seeking control\\" of National. Several weeks later, TIA announced intentions to buy up to 25% of National's stock, and requested approval from the CAB to acquire the stock and direct control of National. TIA's attempted takeover of the much larger National \\"surprised a lot of people\\", because National was so much larger than TIA at the time and no airline had ever attempted an \\"unfriendly\\" takeover of another airline before. Lorenzo's management team viewed National's stock as significantly undervaluing the assets of the company, and the move was financial in addition to being strategic and aimed at combining the routes of the two airlines. A competing offer for control of National was submitted to the CAB by Pan Am, and National ultimately agreed to be acquired by Pan Am; these actions drove up the price of National's stock. The CAB gave TIA and Pan Am each permission to acquire up to 25% of National's shares, and the two companies acquired 45% of the shares in total. The management and directors of National, as a group, owned less than 5% of the outstanding shares. In December, Eastern Airlines also joined the bidding for National. TIA and Pan Am considered the bid a \\"ploy to block their own chances\\" of completing the deal, but Eastern chairman Frank Borman called the offer serious. In April 1979, the United States Department of Justice and the United States Department of Transportation both announced opposition to a merger of Eastern and National on the grounds that the merger would be anti-competitive. In July, the CAB said it \\"would not stand in the way of airline mergers that appear to benefit the public\\". National accepted the Pan Am offer and did not submit TIA's offer to its shareholders, which rendered the TIA offer \\"effectively dead\\". TIA agreed to sell its shares in National to Pan Am, earning TIA a net profit on the merger attempt of approximately $46 million. =TWA in 1980 and 1985= With a large amount of cash on hand, observers said that TIA was likely to begin another acquisition attempt quickly, to preclude becoming a takeover target itself. TIA did exactly that, accumulating shares of Trans World Airlines (TWA), an even bigger target than National. TWA had airline revenues about 14 times those of TIA, and the total revenue of TWA's parent corporation, Trans World Corp., was 20 times TIA's. TIA's plan was to merge TIA with the TWA subsidiary of Trans World Corp., providing it with smaller feed aircraft and a feed network. TWA was opposed to the merger; its board \\"unanimously affirmed\\" publicly that TWA was not for sale. After accumulating more than 4% of Trans World's stock, TIA eventually backed out of the proposed deal, selling all of its holdings by January 1980. In 1985, Lorenzo's team again sought TWA as a merger partner. This time they were approached by the management of TWA as a \\"white knight\\" against the threatened acquisition of TWA by Carl Icahn, who was feared by TWA management and employees. Lorenzo signed a formal contract for the acquisition of TWA in June 1985. However, Icahn pressed on with his acquisition attempt after he received the backing of TWA's pilot union who promised major cost cuts. In August 1985, the TWA board voted to cede the company to Icahn who didnt require any government approval, while Lorenzo's airline would, since airline acquisitions of another airline still required DOT approval. Formation of Texas Air as holding company of group DC-9-32 of New York Air Lorenzo restructured TIA in 1980, forming a holding company called Texas Air Corp, which was controlled by Jet Capital, as TIA had been. Texas Air owned TIA and had cash holdings of about $100 million, which Lorenzo said would be used primarily for investments in the airline industry. Startup of New York Air as separate sub in New York Later in 1980, Texas Air formed a new airline, New York Air, with $25 million in capital. Lorenzo was the chairman of the new company, which was to fly shuttle flights between New York La Guardia, the airline's hub, and Boston-Logan, and Washington-National Airports. Plans included expansion to several cities in the Northeast. New York Air planned to win customers by charging lower fares and providing better service and roomier seats than the dominant carrier between New York and Washington, Eastern Airlines, which responded by offering lower fares. Pan Am, which had announced competing service after New York Air's formation, also lowered its fares. The formation of New York Air was opposed by the unions of Texas International Airlines, who were upset that employees were being hired with pay rates substantially lower than union rates at TIA; in the case of pilots, the rate was about half of the union rate. The unions felt the company was set up specifically to \\"sidestep longstanding labor contracts with organized employees\\" and that the jobs should have been offered to TIA employees. The pilots' union planned a $1 million protest campaign and a boycott of companies that did business with Texas Air, the parent company, but the campaign was unsuccessful and was called off because of the 1981 air traffic controllers' strike. New York Air, independently managed away from the other airline subs, expanded in the 1980's to new cities and was successful in building a strong presence in the profitable Northeast shuttle markets. Continental Airlines=Purchase Continental Boeing 747 at Los Angeles in 1987. Continental Airlines (CAL) had been on TIA's potential merger screen for quite a while. CAL had been losing money regularly and seemed not to have developed an effective strategy to deal with airline deregulation and the new competition that it brought. Its western oriented route structure fit well with TIA's network. Lorenzo made two attempts to merge the companies on a friendly basis, but was rejected by its long-time Chairman Bob Six. In January 1981, Texas International Airlines announced an offer to buy Continental. It had already purchased just over 9% of Continental's shares, and offered to buy enough to bring its stake to between 35% to 49%. Continental already had an agreement to merge with Western Airlines, and Texas Air announced that it would seek to vote its shares to block the merger which it felt was not in the interests of CAL shareholders. As with previous attempts, TIA's takeover target was a much larger company than itself. There was opposition to TIA's planned takeover. In particular, unions feared that Lorenzo would lay off workers and that he was anti-union, demonstrated by formation of New York Air as a non-unionized company, charges which Lorenzo denied by making clear the employees had the right to select union representation should they have so desired. While TIA acquired 49% of Continental's shares, an employee group attempted to stop the plan through legal maneuvers designed to give them control of the company rather than sell to TIA. Continental's chairman, Alvin Feldman, objected to the purchase, telling Lorenzo that he thought the combined company would be \\"very weak\\"; as the takeover battle continued, Feldman was described as being \\"bitterly opposed\\" to the plan. The financing for the employee group's planned purchase fell through, and as Continental was preparing a public announcement, Feldman committed suicide in his Los Angeles office. TIA received approval for its purchase from the CAB, and President Ronald Reagan did not block the deal. The legal battles between the two companies ended in November, with Lorenzo and two associates elected to the board of directors of Continental. 1981 was a financially difficult year for Texas International, New York Air, and Continental. Lorenzo claimed, and some analysts agreed, that Continental's problems were worse than they had appeared before his purchase of the airline. Continental's losses for 1981 were over $100 million, and an economic recession further hurt Continental's finances. It attempted to renegotiate contracts with several unions. A series of steps to combine TIA and Continental followed. Lorenzo consolidated the historic TIA Houston as part of a plan to combine the routes of TIA and Continental in a hub and spoke system centered in Houston and Denver. Continental moved its annual meeting from May to March 1982; at that meeting, Lorenzo was named chairman of Continental. In July, Continental and Texas Air approved a \\"financial merger\\" of the companies, although operations were still to remain separate. In September, the employees of both Texas International and Continental were informed that there would be \\"operational and management integration of the two companies effective Oct. 31 [1982]\\". Although Texas Air remained the parent company, the combined companies operated under the Continental name, brand, and aircraft livery. Strike and bankruptcy After 19 months of negotiations, Continental and its mechanics' union failed to reach a labor agreement, and the mechanics went on strike in August 1983. Continental continued to operate, partially by hiring replacement mechanics. Continental continued to lose money significantly due to its cost structure, and management gave a final proposal to its pilots which provided for ownership by the pilots and other employees of 35% of the company's stock, but with the plan rejected, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors on Saturday evening, September 24th, 1983, laying off 65% of its employees. Following the bankruptcy filing, the pilots' union went on strike to protest lower wages being offered by the company. The bankruptcy filing allowed Continental to void union contracts. It returned to operating profitability in 1984, but remained under bankruptcy protection until 1986, after working out plans with creditors to repay 100% of its debt over a period of 10 years. During the bankruptcy, Continental claimed that its labor costs were too high and would force the company out of business completely if left unchanged. The unions claimed the bankruptcy was simply a legal maneuver intended to void contracts. The company trimmed operations and expenses during the reorganization, cutting one-third of its employees, introducing new labor contracts with its employees, thus voiding the old Union contracts. The average salary of Continental's pilots after the bankruptcy filing was 30% to 50% lower than before the filing. Senior Management also reduced their salaries to those of the pilots. Expansion after the New Continental is \\"born\\" The \\"New Continental\\" began emerging while in bankruptcy. With its cost structure in line with any post deregulation upstart carrier, the airline began competing effectively with legacy carriers. By May 1984, Continental was operating 83 of its 105 aircraft, which had been mostly grounded upon filing for bankruptcy. Though operating near capacity, it was doing so with nearly half the 12,000 employees, on half the average wage cost, than prior to bankruptcy. By the summer of 1984, the Lorenzo team had filled many of the positions downsized during the strike, and employment had reached 9,000 with a route system that served 67 destinations. Planes were averaging a 67% load factor, amongst the highest in the industry. New Continental's low-cost carrier strategy was beginning to bear fruit. In February 1984, Continental received a favorable ruling from Bankruptcy Judge R.F. Wheless Jr. who ruled that \\"Continental was justified in rejecting its [pilots‚Äô union] contract it described as burdensome\\" and that it \\"had no choice but to file for reorganization.\\" Continental's Lorenzo and his team had successfully argued that labor \\"costs would force the airline to liquidate.\\" In the second quarter of 1984, led by Lorenzo's team, Continental's restructuring showed more promise. The company reported a net profit of $10.4 million, which was a $36.9 million improvement from the $26.5 million loss during the same time period in 1983. Further signs that the Lorenzo management team's new low-fare, high-frequency business model was working began to show. With all fares initially set at $49, the airline was able to compete with legacy carriers. It also put in place a stock ownership plan with a grant of 1 million shares, profit sharing and other new forms of compensation, including options to buy new stock to reward employees‚Äô loyalty during and after the union strikes. Pioneering innovations in the industry, such as the self-service ticketing Flying Machines and Continental's partnership with Federal Express to provide overnight ticket delivery nationwide to customers, proved effective. Emergence from Bankruptcy By September 1984, Lorenzo's team had led the airline to surpass the number of seat miles flown prior to bankruptcy with 25% fewer employees. Though the airline was price competitive with new entry carriers, it still offered full services such as hot meals, checked baggage, a frequent flier program and code-sharing with partner airlines. Record profits of $30.3 million were reported for the third quarter in 1984. Continental had successfully transitioned from \\"a high-cost airline losing its proverbial shirt to being a low-cost carrier making good profits.\\" In September 1986, the \\"New Continental\\" successfully emerged from bankruptcy as a lean, sustainable and profitable airline. Notably, Lorenzo's management team had reached agreement with its creditors to repay them at 100 cents-on-the-dollar with no equity dilution, a rarity in previous bankruptcies. Employees and management were issued equity and equity incentives. Growth of Continental in the 1980's Continental‚Äôs rapid growth continued through the 1980‚Äôs. It began service to Europe and added services to Asia, during this period, in addition to growing its operations domestically. In February 1987, Continental merged with the operations of People Express, which had been acquired, and New York Air expanding its route system. Severe service disruptions were experienced during this merger. In 1987, Continental also inaugurated a major new hub operation at Newark Airport‚Äôs Terminal C, with rights acquired in the People Express acquisition. SAS moved its operations to Newark, from JFK airport, in a joint service arrangement in 1988. Continental also made a major image change, currently in use, and eliminated first class service, giving business class passengers the same first class seats‚Äîthis service was later to be marketed as Business First. By 1989, Continental served 133 airports around the world, carried approximately 9% of US commercial air traffic and offered more than 1,250 daily departures. Eastern Air Lines=Background Eastern Airbus A300 at Sint Maarten in 1986. In 1975, Frank Borman became president and CEO of Eastern Air Lines. It was ailing financially, and Borman negotiated concessions from its employees, but he also ordered expensive new airplanes. He also clashed frequently with the head of the machinists' union, Charlie Bryan. The atmosphere at Eastern was such that \\"[l]abor brawls struck Eastern with the regularity of tropical storms in Florida\\". (The company was later described as having been \\"anemic for most of the past 20 years\\" and as having \\"lurched from one financial crisis to another\\".) Takeover In December 1985, Borman met with Lorenzo to elicit possible Eastern interest. CAL had been looking to gain more critical mass and strategic assets. Then, in January 1986, Eastern faced another financial crisis and sought more concessions from its unions. Borman said that Eastern needed to \\"either get long term economic relief from its labor unions or enter bankruptcy and impose that relief, just as now-thriving Continental did under Frank Lorenzo in September 1983\\", but Eastern's machinists' union refused to renegotiate its contract. After Texas Air made an offer to buy Eastern, despite the unions' generally negative opinion of Lorenzo's tactics, union leader Bryan said, \\"it might be surprising the relationship that could develop between Lorenzo and our organization\\". Eastern established a deadline with its three major unions to grant concessions or have the company sold to Texas Air; when the deadline passed without the concessions, the Eastern sale was signed early Monday morning on March 24, 1986. Although there was more litigation to stop the deal, it was approved by shareholders in November 1986. Phil Bakes, who had been President of Continental, was named President and Chief Executive Officer of Eastern, in November 1986, and moved his family to Miami to assume direction of the airline. Lorenzo, appointed Chairman, remained in Houston as Continental's CEO. In December 1986, Texas Air also finalized a deal to acquire People Express Airlines, a low-cost airline that had been formed by eight executives who had left Texas Air in 1980. The deal included the assets of the bankrupt Frontier Airlines, which People Express had purchased in 1985. At that point, the combination of the airline companies controlled by Lorenzo through Texas Air accounted for 20% of the airline industry in the United States, and some estimates described it as the largest airline in the Western world, and second only to Aeroflot worldwide. Asset transfers; Sale of shuttle to Donald Trump In March 1987, Texas Air, realizing that Eastern's labor difficulties were hurting its computer system service sales to other airlines and also wanting to combine its other computer system assets, transferred Eastern's reservation system to a new subsidiary, System One. The transfer value was set at $100 million based on investment banking opinions, although it was substantially below some value estimates of $200 million to $400 million. Eastern then paid fees to lease back the system. The system was combined with Texas Air's other computer system assets and grew to have 5,100 travel agent customers. Texas Air later sold half of its interest in the system to Electronic Data Systems, based on an overall system value of $250 million. In early 1988, with Eastern's cash being consumed by its losses, discussions began with Donald Trump and others to buy the Eastern Shuttle. Lorenzo had contacted Trump as a logical buyer, who importantly wouldn't have provided the competitive threat of one of the major airlines -- who were not contacted. The negotiations with Trump stretched on for several months, and most all of the negotiations were between Trump and Lorenzo in the Edwardian Room of the Plaza Hotel, in New York, which Trump had just bought in early 1988. An agreement was finally reached in October 1988, for Trump to buy Eastern's shuttle service for $365 million, wanting to rebrand it as Trump Shuttle. The deal was closed in June 1989 and Trump went into the airline business. Donald Trump had much to say about buying the shuttle and negotiations with Lorenzo in his 1990 book: Trump, Surviving at the Top. In it he discussed the union fights at Eastern and the making of Lorenzo as a symbol. He said, \\"through it all, Frank just kept quiet and took the heat. In life, most people are big talk and no action. Frank is that rare person who is all action and no talk.\\" Trump also wrote that \\"the funny thing is, I found Frank, man-to-man to be a very different guy from the reclusive, evil maniac you read about in the business press. I met with him numerous times... and invariably found him relaxed, charming, and compassionate, despite his feelings about the union leaders [at Eastern]. Frank is also a devoted family man who cares very deeply about his wife, Sharon, and their children.\\" Trump went on to lose the Trump Shuttle in September, 1990, when the difficult economic times and large debt positions caused a default on Trump's debt to a Citibank led group. The banking group leased the airline to US Air in late 1990, which promptly took off the Trump name. Labor strike and resulting decline in service Due to management and the unions' ongoing battle over labor contracts, service at the airline declined resulting in a series of increasingly contentious and politically charged events. In April 1988, the United States Department of Transportation began an inquiry into the financial fitness and safety of Texas Air and Eastern; the inquiry was announced at the same time as a fine of $823,000 levied by the FAA for safety violations. Texas Air and Eastern's operations were vindicated when the inquiry deemed Texas Air to have passed its tests and added that labor disputes \\"could endanger safety at Eastern\\".Bernstein, p. 128. After negotiations with the three unions failed to produce any labor agreements, a mandated 30-day cooling off period began on 1 February 1989.Bernstein, p. 153. If an agreement could not be reached, strikes would begin on 4 March 1989. During this period, Lorenzo and Phil Bakes, Eastern's CEO, met with several potential buyers of Eastern, including Carl Icahn, Jay Pritzker and Peter Ueberroth, but no deal materialized.Bernstein, p. 155. On 3 March 1989, President George H. W. Bush issued a statement outlining his decision not to act on a National Mediation Board recommendation to appoint a presidential emergency board to attempt to reach a labor agreement with machinists, which had been impossible for many years before Texas Air's acquisition. After the IAM struck, flight attendants, and the pilot union honored the IAM picket lines, and thousands of Eastern flights were canceled, and also thousands of employees were laid off.Bernstein, p. 62. Bankruptcy and shutdown Eastern filed for bankruptcy protection on 9 March 1989. However, the law had been changed since Continental's bankruptcy in 1983 and it was much more difficult to void union contracts in a bankruptcy.Bernstein, p. 169. Eastern continued to operate a reduced schedule, using pilots who crossed picket lines. By November, it claimed it was back on the road toward profitability and asked for more time to submit a reorganization plan to the bankruptcy court. After Bush declined to appoint an emergency board to mediate the labor dispute, Congress passed a compromise bill designed to establish a bi-partisan commission specifically to \\"investigate the labor dispute\\" at Eastern, but it was vetoed by Bush on 21 November 1989. The following day, the pilots' union voted to end its strike, after about 800 of its members had crossed picket lines, and many others had taken early retirement or gone to work for other airlines. The flight attendants ended their strike the following day, but the machinists continued to strike.Bernstein, p. 213. Although Eastern was still operating, it was still losing money and proposed plans to its unsecured creditors that called for payment of 50% of the debt, and as conditions worsened, only 25% of the debt. Unable to reach agreement with Eastern, creditors requested that a trustee be appointed.Bernstein, p. 220. The bankruptcy court agreed to the request and named a trustee, Martin Shugrue, to run Eastern in April 1990, with the goal of continuing to operate the company and find a buyer. With the trustee unable to bring the airline to profitability, Eastern ceased operations on 18 January 1991 and its assets were liquidated. Airline legacy Lorenzo's Jet Capital Corporation agreed to sell its controlling stake in Continental Airlines‚Äô holding company to Scandinavian Airlines Systems (SAS) on August 10, 1990, and the Jet Capital officers at Continental stepped down. \\"Frank Lorenzo has etched an indelible mark on the U.S. airline business. Whether he is a union buster, an opportunist, or a keen businessman depends on one's perspective, but his mark has been deep and may be lasting,\\" wrote James Ott on Lorenzo's departure from Continental. ‚ÄúWhen Lorenzo took over the ailing Texas International in 1972, he became the youngest CEO of any airline of substance in the history of air transportation,‚Äù according to R.E.G. Davies who has been the Lindbergh Chair of Aerospace history at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum and is often considered the dean of aviation history. Davies went on to say that ‚Äú(Lorenzo‚Äôs) subsequent progress toward greater goals has been marked with no less success and has been just as systematic,‚Ä¶Lorenzo became the most controversial single personality in the airline world‚Ä¶because he challenged the entire structure of cost-and-revenue relations that had long existed in a closely protected corporate environment and in doing so generated a cause c√©lebre of historic proportions.‚Äù Lorenzo has frequently been described as \\"anti-union\\", particularly after the bankruptcy at Continental, which ended by unionized employees voiding their union contracts in the successful effort to save the airline from liquidation and permanent job losses. Earlier at Texas International Air, the airline sought wage concessions in 1974 to return the company to viability given its competition with low cost Southwest Airlines. After a union went on strike, TIA began hiring replacement workers, and after four months, the unions returned to work and TIA went on to reach profitability in 1976.Bernstein, pp. 13‚Äì14. Before Texas Air's takeover of Eastern was completed, their efforts to build a sustainable, profitable airline model were criticized, with opponents saying his companies' profits were earned \\"on the backs of broken labor contracts, extremely low wages and harsh work rules.\\" Investment career=Departure from Continental and establishment of Savoy Capital Lorenzo had been CEO for Continental and Texas International for 18 years, when he sold through Jet Capital his controlling interest in Continental Airlines in 1990 to Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), and stepped down from his CEO role to pursue other entrepreneurial and investment ventures. Lorenzo's departure from Continental was a basic part of the deal, required by both Lorenzo and SAS, although he remained a director of Continental for two years afterwards as part of the arrangements with SAS.Share purchase agreement between Jet Capital Corporation and Scandinavian Airline System (SAS) dated August 2, 1990. During his eighteen-year tenure, his airline empire grew from 15 jet aircraft (at Texas International) with revenues of $73 million, to Continental's combined fleet of 350 jet aircraft and revenues of over $5 billion. After the sale of his interest in Continental, Lorenzo founded Savoy Capital, Inc. in 1990 in Houston, TX. Savoy is a private investment firm largely investing for its own account, both on a liquid basis and privately, but which also has invested on behalf of accredited outside investors. ATX, Inc. In 1992, a company in which Lorenzo was a significant shareholder, but not part of management, ATX Inc., attempted to start a low-cost airline serving the east coast of the United States. A regulatory application by ATX, strongly fought by organized labor, was rejected by the U.S. Department of Transportation in 1993, shortly after it had come under a Democratic administration; the agency said that under Lorenzo's supervision, Eastern Airlines and Texas Air had \\"experienced operational, maintenance and labor-related problems that were among the most serious in the history of U.S. aviation.\\" Lorenzo had previously reduced his stake in the company to 24 percent and said that he would only serve on its board. Philanthropy Lorenzo is a long-time trustee of The Hispanic Society of America, an institution with a free-entrance museum of art located in New York City. It houses the largest collection of Spanish art outside Spain, with major paintings by Vel√°zquez, Goya, Zurbar√°n, El Greco, and Sorolla. He is additionally a trustee emeritus of the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation located in Princeton, New Jersey. Lorenzo and his wife are involved as a director, donor, or advisor to a number of other arts and charitable organizations. In 1986, Lorenzo established the Olegario Lorenzo Memorial and Lorenzo Family Scholarship Funds at Columbia College. Personal Lorenzo married Sharon Neill (n√©e Murray) in 1972, and has four children. His wife is an adjunct professor at University of Penn law school, where she teaches a course in art law.

The unorthodox design featured a top-mounted BMW 003 jet engine (identical in terms of make and position to the powerplant used by the Heinkel He 162) and the pilot in a prone position. The Soviet Army occupied the factory just as the Hs 132 V1 was nearing flight testing, the V2 and V3 being 80% and 75% completed. Design and development There had been interest in the idea of a prone pilot for combat aircraft to reduce the effect of g-forces during maneuvering. Several aircraft had already experimented with this layout for various reasons, the Horten IIIf had a prone pilot, but this was primarily to reduce drag in this high-performance glider,Horten H IIL, H IIIf, H IIIh, H VI V2 while the DFS 228 reconnaissance glider also used a prone pilot to make it easier to seal its pressurized cabin. It was not until the Berlin B9 was built specifically to test this arrangement for improved g-load that any serious effort toward development could be carried out. Starting in early 1943, the Berlin B9 twin- piston engined experimental aircraft demonstrated that it was indeed possible for a pilot to fly the aircraft lying down, and that it did improve his ability to handle high loads. The pilot had an extremely restricted field of view upward or to the rear that made it suitable only for certain roles, including bombers or fighters or interceptors with a major speed advantage over their opposition.Berlin B9 Experimental Aircraft Based on this research, several late-war German designs followed the B9's lead and used a prone pilot. Better g-load performance was not the only reason, however, as this layout also reduced the frontal area of the aircraft. This was a serious concern for interceptors attacking the USAAF's B-17 Flying Fortress, as calculations showed that the chance of being hit by its defensive guns was largely a function of frontal area. The genesis for the Hs 132 was an 18 February 1943 specification published by the German Air Ministry (RLM) calling for a single- seat shipping attack aircraft to counter an expected invasion of Europe. A piston-engined aircraft was called for at the time, but the performance requirements led to a switch to jet power. Henschel submitted their design for RLM approval in April/May 1944, by which point they had already started wind tunnel testing the basic layout. The aircraft that emerged had a roughly cigar-shaped fuselage with short-span mid-set wings and a horizontal stabilizer with considerable dihedral ending in twin rounded-front vertical stabilizers. The BMW 003 engine was mounted on the back of the aircraft above the wing, likely to make servicing easier due to the low ground height of the aircraft that put the engine roughly shoulder-height. The sharply dihedraled 'butterfly'-like twin rudder arrangement kept the tail surfaces clear of the jet efflux. The cockpit was completely faired into the fuselage contour, with a rounded clear nose-cone on the front of the aircraft. Behind this was the actual \\"window,\\" a large armored-glass plate located some distance behind the extreme nose; the glazing extended almost to the wing root.Christopher, John. The Race for Hitler's X-Planes (The Mill, Gloucestershire: History Press, 2013), p.147. The design in terms of engine mounting and tailplane bore a very strong resemblance to the contemporary Volksj√§ger (\\"people's fighter\\") design competition winner, the Heinkel He 162 Spatz (sparrow). The basic A model carried one bomb; it had no other armament. It was to begin its attack in a shallow dive outside the ships' range of fire, and after reaching a speed of , the pilot would \\"toss\\" the bomb at the target using a simple computerized sight, and then climb back out of range. The aircraft was designed to withstand 12 g during pullout. The computerized bombsight was not delivered in time to be fitted to the aircraft. Several other versions of the basic airframe were proposed as well. The Hs 132B used the Junkers Jumo 004 engine in place of the BMW 003, and added two MG 151/20 cannons. The HS 132C was a more extensively modified version intended for bomber interception, featuring the larger Heinkel HeS 011 engine, two 151/20s and two MK 103 or MK 108 cannons. The HeS 011, intended to power a wide variety of new and existing Luftwaffe aircraft (an example of the latter being the proposed D and P series of the Arado Ar 234 jet bomber), was still in the pre-production phase when the war ended. It was hoped that by the time the HS 132B became available, the Panzerblitz anti-tank missile would be in production and available for use. The Hs 132D included a new wing of increased span. A contract for six prototypes was approved in May 1944, and construction was begun in March 1945. Hs 132V1 was scheduled to have its first flight in June 1945, but the completed wings and fuselage were never mated, and Soviet forces captured the intact fuselage in May 1945 while the wings were never moved from their factory in France.

The first incarnation of Duran Duran in 1978 included Rhodes as keyboardist, John Taylor on guitar and Duffy as songwriter/vocalist and bassist (along with Simon Colley). This lineup performed live for almost a year before Duffy and Colley left the band. Duffy moved on to a solo career and The Lilac Time, and Duran Duran eventually went on to fame with drummer Roger Taylor, guitarist Andy Taylor and singer Simon Le Bon. In 1999, Duffy came across an old tape recording of a live Duran Duran concert from a 1979 show. Shortly afterwards, Rhodes and Duffy met by chance at a fashion show, and began talking about the old music. They decided it might be fun to re-record some of those original, dark, art-school, pre-Le Bon Duran Duran songs. A few months later they took to the studio, using vintage analog instruments but modern production techniques to recreate the early Duran Duran sound. The lyrics remained unchanged. Dark Circles The band played live only two times, in London (19 November 2002), and Cologne (17 February 2003), before both members returned to their normal careers. In early June 2008, Rhodes and Duffy were interviewed by the music journalist Pete Paphides for BBC Radio 4, and relived the whole Dark Circles experience. Duffy also publicly stated through his website that a Devils DVD could be released later.

He is the creator and host of the Food Network television show Good Eats that ran for 14 seasons, host of the mini-series Feasting on Asphalt and Feasting on Waves, and host and main commentator on Iron Chef America and Cutthroat Kitchen. Brown is a best-selling author of several books on food and cooking. A \\"recap\\" series titled \\"Good Eats Reloaded\\" aired on Cooking Channel starting in October 2018, and a true sequel series titled Good Eats: The Return premiered on August 25, 2019, on Food Network. Early life Alton Brown was born July 30, 1962, in Los Angeles and spent his youth in Georgia. Brown's father, Alton Brown Sr., was a media executive in Cleveland, Georgia, owner of radio station WRWH, and publisher of the newspaper White County News. He died on Alton's last day of sixth grade from an apparent suicide. The experience is what Brown credits for his work ethic, stating in one interview with Delish ‚ÄúI think I've built a life that's based on running away from my life.\\" In the late 1980s and early 1990s, after studying film in the University of Georgia drama department, Brown was the cinematographer for several music videos, including \\"The One I Love\\" by R.E.M. Career Brown was dissatisfied with the quality of cooking shows airing on American television, so he set out to produce his own show. In preparation, he enrolled in the New England Culinary Institute, graduating in 1997. Brown says that he was a poor science student in high school and college, but he focused on the subject to understand the underlying processes of cooking. He is outspoken in his shows about his dislike of single-purpose kitchen utensils and equipment (\\"unitaskers\\"), such as garlic presses and margarita machines, although he adapts a few traditionally single-purpose devices, such as rice cookers and melon ballers, into multi-purpose tools. TV seriesGood Eats= The pilot for Good Eats first aired in July 1998 on the PBS member TV station WTTW in Chicago, Illinois. Food Network picked up the show in July 1999. In May 2011, Alton Brown announced an end to Good Eats after 14 seasons. The final episode, \\"Turn on the Dark\\", aired February 10, 2012. Many of the Good Eats episodes feature Brown building makeshift cooking devices in order to point out that many of the devices sold at conventional \\"cooking\\" stores are simply fancified hardware store items. Good Eats was nominated for the Best T.V. Food Journalism Award by the James Beard Foundation in 2000. The show was also awarded a 2006 Peabody Award. On Alton's 2017 book tour he stated Good Eats will have a \\"sequel\\" and it will be released to the Internet in 2018. This was changed in late 2018, when Brown made arrangements with Cooking Channel to air \\"revised\\" versions of several episodes with new recipes entitled Good Eats Reloaded, in which he stated new episodes of Good Eats are also in the works. 13 episodes of \\"Good Eats Reloaded\\" aired late winter and early spring 2019, and were added to the Good Eats reruns on The Cooking Channel. It was then announced on June 5, 2019, that the new show will be called \\"Good Eats Returns\\" and would premier on the Food Network Sunday, August 25 at 10p.m. =Good Eats Reloaded and Good Eats: The Return= Brown relaunched the show in two versions: as Good Eats Reloaded on Cooking Channel (which updates, reworks and adds to original Good Eats episodes), and on Food Network as Good Eats: The Return in August 2019 (all new episodes). Both the Reloaded series and the Return series are said to be returning in 2020. New episodes of Reloaded are set to premiere on Friday, April 10, 2020. New Return episodes are currently in the writing process, and were planned to be filming over the Summer, but may be delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. =Iron Chef America= In 2004 Brown appeared on Iron Chef America: Battle of the Masters. This was the second attempt to adapt the Japanese cooking show Iron Chef to American television (the first being UPN's Iron Chef USA, which featured William Shatner, and was not well received). Brown served as the expert commentator, a modified version of the role played by Dr. Yukio Hattori in the original show. When the show became a series, Brown began serving as the play-by-play announcer, with Kevin Brauch as kitchen reporter. Brown also served as the host for all five seasons of the spin-off The Next Iron Chef. =Feasting on Asphalt= Brown's third series, Feasting on Asphalt, explores the history of eating on the move. Brown and his crew crossed the United States via motorcycle in a four-part miniseries about the history of road food. Brown samples food all along his travel route. He includes a \\"history of food\\" segment documenting famous road trips and interviews many of the foodies he meets en route. The series premiered on Food Network on July 29, 2006. The mini-series was picked up for a second run, entitled Feasting on Asphalt 2: The River Run, in 2007. Six episodes were filmed during April and May 2007. The episodes trace the majority of the length of the Mississippi River through Brown's travels. The second run of episodes began airing on Food Network on August 4, 2007. The third season uses the title Feasting on Waves and has Brown traveling the Caribbean Sea by boat in search of local cuisine. =Cutthroat Kitchen= In 2013, Brown began hosting the cooking competition series Cutthroat Kitchen on the Food Network. In each episode, four chefs are each given $25,000 with which to bid on items that can be used to hinder their opponents' cooking, such as confiscating ingredients or forcing them to use unorthodox tools and equipment. Three chefs are eliminated one by one, and the winner keeps his/her unspent money as the day's prize. The series premiered on August 11, 2013. ToursThe Edible Inevitable Tour= In October 2013, Brown launched \\"Alton Brown Live: The Edible Inevitable Tour,\\" his first national tour visiting 46 cities through March 2014. The show included stand- up comedy, talk show antics, a multimedia lecture, live music and \\"extreme\\" food experimentation Debbi Snook (September 18, 2013). \\"Food Network star Alton Brown coming to Akron for first national tour\\", The Plain Dealer, Retrieved October 22, 2013. After a hiatus of several months while Brown worked on his Food Network shows, the tour resumed in October 2014 and concluded on April 4, 2015, in Houston, Texas, after visiting more than 60 cities. =Eat Your Science= Brown mounted a second tour show: Alton Brown Live: Eat Your Science in 2016. The show toured through the fall of 2017. All totaled, Brown's shows have played over 225 dates including Broadway. Both his tours have included \\"large, unusual and probably dangerous\\" food demonstrations, audience participation and even food songs performed by Brown and his combo. Brown has been quoted as saying his final tour will launch in fall of 2020. Awards Brown is the recipient of two James Beard Awards. He won the Best Book award in 2003 for his first book, I'm Just Here for the Food, and the Broadcast Media Award in 2011 for TV Food Personality/Host. He has also been nominated four additional times. Other appearances Brown served as a mentor on Season 8 of The Next Food Network Star alongside Bobby Flay and Giada De Laurentiis. During season 8, each mentor selected and mentored a team of five finalists. Team Alton's finalist, Justin Warner, was the season 8 winner; however, Brown will not be producing Warner's show. Brown appeared on the Travel Channel show The Layover with Anthony Bourdain which focused on the city of Atlanta in 2013. In the episode Bourdain takes Brown to the Clermont Lounge. Brown guest-starred as the \\"Guest Bailiff\\" and \\"Expert Witness\\" in John Hodgman's comedy/court show podcast Judge John Hodgman. In October 2017, Brown was featured on the Food Network television show Chopped in a five-part series called \\"Alton Brown's Challenge.\\" Brown voices Yum Labouch√© in Big Hero 6: The Series. The character is a judge for an underground cooking competition. Brown appeared on episode 196 of MythBusters titled \\"Food Fables\\". Commercials Brown has done commercial work for General Electric (GE) products, including five infomercials touting the benefits of GE refrigerators, washers and dryers, water purifiers, Trivection ovens, and dishwashers. The infomercials are produced in the Good Eats style, employing the use of unusual camera angles, informational text, props, visual aids, scientific explanations, and the same method of delivery. These infomercials are distributed to wholesale distributors of appliances/plumbing devices. Brown has also aided GE in developing a new type of oven. He was initially called by GE to help their engineers learn more about the effects of heat on food; that grew into an active cooperation to develop GE's Trivection oven. Brown has promoted Colgate toothpaste, Dannon yogurt, Welch's, Shun knives, and for Heifer International. In 2010, he endorsed kosher salt use in a campaign for Cargill. Twitter In 2012, Brown gained popularity by pioneering the use of humorous \\"Analog Tweets,\\" wherein he posts pictures of hand-drawn Twitter responses on Post-it notes which he has stuck to his computer monitor. The Alton Browncast On June 28, 2013, Alton Brown joined the Nerdist Podcast Network with his podcast The Alton Browncast. In this podcast, Brown reviews recent food news, takes calls and questions from listeners, and interviews celebrities and other guests. Food is often a focal point of the podcast, but several episodes have branched off into other areas of Brown's interest, including men's style, production and recording of music, and various aspects of acting and cinematography. So far, it has featured chats with food luminaries such as Justin Warner, Hugh Acheson, Alex Guarnaschelli, Bobby Flay, and Keith Schroder. Guests have also included men's style maven Sid Mashburn and clothing manufacturing team Adam Schoenberg and Cory Rosenberg; producer Jim Milan and soundman Patrick Beldin from \\"The Edible Inevitable Tour\\" and actor Bart Hansard, who played multiple characters on Good Eats. Pantry Raid and Quarantine Quitchen With the COVID-19 Quarantine in 2020 and the subsequent delays in production on Season 16 of GOOD EATS (Season 2 of \\"The Return\\"), Alton took to YouTube to make two new online cooking series. Pantry Raid was a series of once-weekly shorts (usually released on Fridays or Saturdays) for making palatable foods while staying safe at home. The episodes were filmed in the GOOD EATS Test Kitchens at Brain Food Productions, and consist of Alton and a cameraman as the only personnel onsite. Some are classic comfort foods (like popcorn and Rice Krispie treats), while others are favorite food hacks (hot saltines, lacquered bacon, etc.) and a few are foods Alton has never made before (most notably Dalgona coffee). Each episode ran from between 3 and 10 minutes, with most coming in around the 7-minute mark. Each episode ended with an on-screen graphic with the words \\"This has been another...ALTON BROWN PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT. Thank you for washing.\\" This last line is in reference to a Handwashing Tutorial Alton posted prior to doing these cooking shorts. When the second season of GOOD EATS: THE RETURN went into pre-production, Alton stopped production of these mini- episodes.PANTRY RAID series on YouTube Quarantine Quitchen started as a single livestream entitled \\"The Browns Make Dinner\\", referring to Alton and his wife Elizabeth making dinner at their loft apartment in Georgia. After the success of the first such \\"episode\\", the once- weekly series is now released live every Tuesday. The episodes were initially streamed at 7:00PM EST, but as of August 2020, the episodes now start at 8:00PM EST, as Alton went into pre-production for the second season of GOOD EATS: THE RETURN. To start, little or no planning went into these shows, save for Alton & Elizabeth performing a song on guitars (Alton on Electric, Elizabeth on bass) every other week. As the show has progressed, a bit more pre-planning has gone into the series (mostly thanks to Elizabeth). As for the dishes, most are prepared from what they have on hand in their kitchen, where stocks of certain items can be scarce, due to the quarantine requirements. Alton self-films these episodes on a smartphone, and the dialogue DOES occasionally edge into the \\"Mature\\" category. While cooking, Alton & Elizabeth often try to answer inquiries from the ongoing chat of viewers. The Browns' two dogs, Scabigail and Francis, often appear in the episodes as well. Alton plans on keeping this series going post-quarantine. He recently solicited for possible new titles for the show, but the majority of respondents insisted they keep the \\"Quarantine Quitchen\\" title. Episodes started at about 30‚Äì45 minutes, but more recently run about an hour, give or take 15 minutes.QUARANTINE QUITCHEN series on YouTube Personal life Brown lives in Marietta, Georgia. He and his former wife DeAnna, an executive producer on Good Eats, divorced in 2015. DeAnna and Alton have one daughter, Zoey (born in 1999). A few members of his extended family appeared on Good Eats (such as his late grandmother, Ma Mae, his mother, and daughter, Zoey, who is known on the show as \\"Alton's Spawn\\"), but most of his \\"family\\" portrayed on the series were actors or members of the show's production crew. Brown and Atlanta restaurant designer Elizabeth Ingram became engaged in 2018. According to Brown's Instagram account, as of September 2018, he and Ingram had married, on a boat in Charleston, SC. Brown and Elizabeth Ingram have two dogs: a terrier named Francis Luther and a Boston terrier/pug mix that the couple rescued in 2018 named Scabigail Van Buren. Brown was once a motorcycling enthusiast, owning a BMW R1150RT,Alton Brown at Roadfly magazine although he no longer owns one. He gave up motorcycling by 2012, citing issues of slowing reflexes and safety. In a recent Quarantine Quitchen episode, Brown stated that he currently owns a 1980 BMW R60. Additionally, Brown was an airplane pilot, and was featured in the aviation magazine AOPA Flight Training. He owned two planes, a Cessna 206 and a Cessna 414. Brown enjoys vintage watches, and wore a different watch for every season of Good Eats; this was used in production to quickly identify which season a clip is from. When his watch broke down mid-season, he continued to wear the broken timepiece to maintain this system. Twenty years after the Omega Seamaster watch his father left him was stolen, Brown bought it from an eBay seller and had it restored. Brown changed his eating habits in 2009 in order to lose weight and become healthier, losing over the course of nine months. Brown discussed his Christian beliefs in a 2010 interview with Eater. He said at the time: > I'm not a spooky snake handler because I live in Georgia and I'm Christian‚Ä¶ > that I believe in the Bible, that I travel with the Bible, that I read the > Bible every day. I'm still me. I'm still a guy doing a job. I find, > actually, that people ask me a lot about it. I don't hit people over the > head with the Bible ... I still feel a funny little tinge in my stomach when > I'm out to dinner with my wife and daughter in New York. We'll go to dinner > and we'll be sitting around the table and we'll say grace. You know what? > People are going to stare at you. I used to feel really self-conscious. But > I've gotten to a point where I think, nah, I'm not going to feel bad about > that. I'm not going to apologize about that. Brown said in a December 2014 interview in Time that he \\"could no longer abide the Southern Baptist Convention's indoctrination of children and its anti-gay stance\\" adding that he is now \\"searching for a new belief system.\\" Bibliography * I'm Just Here for the Food: Food + Heat = Cooking (, 2002) * Alton Brown's Gear for Your Kitchen (, 2003) * I'm Just Here for the Food: Kitchen User's Manual (, 2003) * I'm Just Here for the Food: Cook's Notes (, 2003) * I'm Just Here for More Food: Food √ó Mixing + Heat = Baking (, 2004) * I'm Just Here for the Food: Version 2.0 (, 2006) * Feasting on Asphalt: The River Run (, 2008) * Good Eats: The Early Years (, 2009) * Good Eats 2: The Middle Years (, 2010) * Good Eats 3: The Later Years (, 2011) * Good Eats: Two-Volume Set - Episodes 1 Through 164 (, 2011) * Good Eats: Three-Volume Set - The Complete Episodes (, 2013) * EveryDayCook (, 2016) See also * Shirley Corriher ReferencesExternal links * Official website * * Alton's YOUTUBE Channel * FoodNetwork.com: Good Eats * * His James Beard Foundation Award, including a video of his acceptance speech * Interview, Macworld * Food for Thought, Guideposts, August 2006 Category:1962 births Category:American male chefs Category:Chefs from California Category:American television chefs Category:American bloggers Category:American food writers Category:American cookbook writers Category:American male non-fiction writers Category:American cinematographers Category:American male voice actors Category:Male actors from Los Angeles Category:Male actors from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Food Network chefs Category:Living people Category:Writers from Los Angeles Category:People from Marietta, Georgia Category:Writers from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:University of Georgia alumni Category:James Beard Foundation Award winners Category:21st-century American non-fiction writers Category:American male bloggers Category:Chefs from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Shorty Award winners ","title":"Alton Brown"},{"id":"457791","text":"Waterboro may refer to a place in the United States: *Waterboro, Maine *Waterboro, New York *Waterboro, South Carolina ","title":"Waterboro"},{"id":"457792","text":"The Church Brew Works is a brewpub in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, set in the confines of a restored Roman Catholic church (formerly St. John the Baptist Church).

It was created by writ in 1461 for William Herbert, who was later made Earl of Pembroke. The second Earl of Pembroke surrendered his earldom in return for the earldom of Huntingdon, which became extinct on his death without male issue. The barony, however, passed to his daughter Elizabeth, who later married the first Earl of Worcester. At Elizabeth's death, the title passed to her son, who later inherited his father's earldom of Worcester. Later, the fifth Earl was made Marquess of Worcester, and the third Marquess became Duke of Beaufort. Thereafter, the barony and dukedom remained united until 1984 when, upon the death of the tenth Duke without issue, the barony fell into abeyance. Then, in 2002, the Queen terminated the abeyance of the barony of Herbert in favour of the last holder's great-nephew, David John Seyfried.

Photo: Frances Resor Waite c.1937. Norman Bel Geddes (born Norman Melancton Geddes; April 27, 1893 ‚Äì May 8, 1958) was an American theatrical and industrial designer. Early life Bel Geddes was born Norman Melancton Geddes in Adrian, Michigan, and raised in New Philadelphia, Ohio, the son of Flora Luelle (n√©e Yingling) and Clifton Terry Geddes, a stockbroker. When he married Helen Belle Schneider in 1916, they combined their names to Bel Geddes. Their daughters were actress Barbara Bel Geddes and writer Joan Ulanov. Career The insignia used by Bel Geddes in his published works Bel Geddes began his career with set designs for Aline Barnsdall's Los Angeles Little Theater in the 1916‚Äì17 season, then in 1918 as the scene designer for the Metropolitan Opera in New York. He designed and directed various theatrical works, from Arabesque and The Five O'Clock Girl on Broadway to an ice show, It Happened on Ice, produced by Sonja Henie. He also created set designs for the film Feet of Clay (1924), directed by Cecil B. DeMille, designed costumes for Max Reinhardt, and created the sets for the Broadway production of Sidney Kingsley's Dead End (1935). Bel Geddes opened an industrial-design studio in 1927, and designed a wide range of commercial products, from cocktail shakers to commemorative medallions to radio cabinets. His designs extended to unrealized futuristic concepts: a teardrop-shaped automobile, and an Art Deco House of Tomorrow. In 1929, he designed \\"Airliner Number 4,\\" a 9-deck amphibian airliner that incorporated areas for deck-games, an orchestra, a gymnasium, a solarium, and two airplane hangars. His book Horizons (1932) had a significant impact: \\"By popularizing streamlining when only a few engineers were considering its functional use, he made possible the design style of the thirties.\\" He wrote forward-looking articles for popular American periodicals. In the classic science fiction film of H. G. Wells' Things to Come (1936), he assisted production designer William Cameron Menzies on the look of the world of tomorrow. Bel Geddes designed the General Motors Pavilion, known as Futurama, for the 1939 New York World's Fair. For that famous and enormously influential installation, Bel Geddes exploited his earlier work in the same vein: he had designed a \\"Metropolis City of 1960\\" in 1936. Bel Geddes's book Magic Motorways (1940) promoted advances in highway design and transportation, foreshadowing the Interstate Highway System, along with aspects of driver assist and autonomous driving.Magic motorways by Norman Bel Geddes, 1940, pp. 43-56. Quote: \\"But these cars of 1960 and the highways on which they drive will have in them devices which will correct the faults of human beings as drivers. They will prevent the driver from committing errors. They will make it possible for him to proceed at full speed through dense fog.\\" The case for the Mark I computer was designed by Norman Bel Geddes. IBM's Thomas Watson presented it to Harvard. At the time, some saw it as a waste of resources, since computing power was in high demand during this part of World War II and those funds could have been used to build additional equipment.  Death and legacy  Bel Geddes died in New York on May 8, 1958. His autobiography, Miracle in the Evening, was published posthumously in 1960. Bel Geddes is a member of the American Theater Hall of Fame, a distinction he shares with his daughter, actress Barbara Bel Geddes. The United States Postal Service issued a postage stamp honoring Bel Geddes as a \\"Pioneer Of American Industrial Design\\". The archive of Norman Bel Geddes is held by the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. This large collection includes models, drafts, watercolor designs, research notes, project proposals, and correspondence. The Ransom Center also holds the papers of Bel Geddes' wife, the noted costume designer and producer Edith Lutyens Bel Geddes.

Walsh School of Foreign Service, Georgetown University He is also known for IslamOnline, a website he helped to found in 1997 and for which he serves as chief religious scholar. Al-Qaradawi has published more than 120 books, including The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam and Islam: The Future Civilization. He has also received eight international prizes for his contributions to Islamic scholarship,\\"Qaradawi Wins Hijra Award\\" ION, 15 December 2009 and is considered one of the most influential such scholars living today.Raymond William Baker, Islam Without Fear: Egypt and the New Islamists (2003), p.4 Al-Qaradawi has long had a prominent role within the intellectual leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Egyptian political organization, although he has repeatedly stated that he is no longer a member and twice (in 1976 and 2004) turned down offers for the official role in the organization. Some of al-Qaradawi's views, such as his condoning of Palestinian suicide bombings against Israelis, have caused reactions from governments in the West:Controversial preacher with 'star status' BBC article, by agdi Abdelhadi on 7 July 2004 he was refused an entry visa to the United Kingdom in 2008, and barred from entering France in 2012. Biography Al- Qaradawi, during his days at Azhari Institute at Tanta Al-Qaradawi was born in 1926 in Saft Turab village in the Nile Delta, now in Gharbia Governorate, Egypt, into a poor family of devout Muslim peasants. He became an orphan at the age of two, when he lost his father. Following his father's death, he was raised by his uncle. He read and memorized the entire Quran by the time he was nine years old. He then joined the Institute of Religious Studies at Tanta, and graduated after nine years of study. While in Tanta, Al-Qaradawi first encountered Hassan al Banna, the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, when al Banna gave a lecture at his school. Al-Qaradawi has written of the lasting impact of this encounter, describing al Banna as \\"brilliantly radiating, as if his words were revelation or live coals from the light of prophecy.\\" He moved on to study Islamic Theology at the Al-Azhar University in Cairo, from which he graduated in 1953. He earned a diploma in Arabic Language and Literature in 1958 at the Advanced Arabic Studies Institute. He enrolled in the graduate program in the Department of Quran and Sunnah Sciences of the Faculty of Religion's Fundamentals (Usul al-Din), and graduated with a master's degree in Quranic Studies in 1960.Al Qaradawi in Al Azhar Asharq Aawsat 17 July 2008 In 1962, he was sent by Al-Azhar University to Qatar to head the Qatari Secondary Institute of Religious Studies. He completed his PhD thesis titled Zakah and its effect on solving social problems in 1973 with First Merit and was awarded his PhD degree from Al-Azhar. In 1977, he laid the foundation for the Faculty of Shari'ah and Islamic Studies in the University of Qatar and became the faculty's dean. In the same year he founded the Centre of Seerah and Sunna Research. He also served at the Institute of Imams, Egypt under the Egyptian Ministry of Religious Endowments as supervisor before moving back to Doha as Dean of the Islamic Department at the Faculties of Shariah and Education in Qatar, where he continued until 1990. His next appointment was in Algeria as Chairman of the Scientific Council of Islamic University and Higher Institutions in 1990‚Äì91. He returned to Qatar once more as Director of the Seerah and Sunnah Center at Qatar University, a post he still occupies today. In 1997, Al-Qaradawi helped found the European Council for Fatwa and Research, a council of important and influential Muslim scholars dedicated to researching and writing fatwas in support of Western Muslim minority communities based in Ireland, and he serves as its head.The European Council for Fatwa and Research He also serves as the chairman of International Union for Muslim Scholars (IUMS). He was imprisoned under King Farouq in 1949, then three times during the reign of former President Gamal Abdul Nasser, until he left Egypt for Qatar in 1961. He returned to Egypt in 2011 in the wake of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution. Al-Qaradawi is a principal shareholder and former Sharia adviser to Bank Al-Taqwa, a member bank of the Lugano-Switzerland Al- Taqwa group, a bank that the U.S. states finances terrorism and that the UN Security Council had listed as associated with Al Qaeda. On 2 August 2010, the bank was removed from a list of entities and individuals associated with Al Qaeda maintained by the Security Council.The UN -The Consolidated List September 2009 Al-Qaradawi finished 3rd in a 2008 poll on who was the world's leading public intellectual. The poll, Top 100 Public Intellectuals, was of the readers of Prospect Magazine (UK) and Foreign Policy (United States). 2011 return to Egypt After the 2011 Egyptian Revolution, Qaradawi made his first public appearance in Egypt after 1981. In Tahrir Square, he led Friday prayers on 18 February, addressing an audience estimated to exceed two million Egyptians.For a complete English translation, see: The Tahrir Square Sermon of Shaykh Y√ªsuf al-Qarad√¢w√Æ. Translation by Yahya M. Michot with the collaboration of Samy Metwally, on http://www.hartsem.edu/ It began with an address of \\"O Muslims and Copts\\", referring to Egypt's Coptic Christian minority instead of the customary opening for Islamic Friday sermons \\"O Muslims\\". He was reported to have said, \\"Egyptian people are like the genie who came out of the lamp and who have been in prison for 30 years.\\" He also demanded the release of political prisoners in Egyptian prisons, praised the Copts for protecting Muslims in their Friday prayer, and called for the new military rulers to quickly restore civilian rule. He referred to Mubarak as a Tyrannical Pharaoh. On 21 February 2011, he talked about the protests in Libya and issued a fatwa permitting the killing of Muammar Gaddafi:For a complete English translation, see: The fatwa of Shaykh Y√ªsuf al-Qarad√¢w√Æ against Gaddafi. Translation by Yahya M. Michot with the collaboration of Samy Metwally, on https://www.scribd.com/doc/51219918/Qadhafi/ He also called on Libyan ambassadors around the world to distance themselves from Gaddafi's government.Sunni cleric says Gaddafi should die, IOL News, 21 February 2011Egyptian cleric: Kill Gaddafi, PressTV, 22 February 2011 In the Jerusalem Post, Barry Rubin drew a parallel between Qaradawi's sermon and the Ayatollah Khomeini returning to Iran. He also said that Qaradawi was encouraging the Muslim Brotherhood to suppress opposition when he made reference to hypocrites in his sermon. Brookings Institution member Shadi Hamid says that Qaradawi is in the mainstream of Egyptian society, and that he also has appeal among Egyptians who are not Islamist. In the Eurasia Review, Princeton University student Aaron Rock dismisses claims that Qaradawi is the Khomeini of Egypt, but he does see his influence as a sign that Islam will play a significant role in the shaping of Egypt's politics. He writes, \\"Neither Qaradawi's popularity nor his rhetoric should distract from the fact that Egyptian revolution's grievances were based on a desire for political liberty and economic opportunity. That said, Islam remains an important framework for public debate and a reservoir of political symbolism.\\" Views and statements=Religious and sectarian viewsMuslim sectsExtremism Al-Qaradawi has written on the danger of extremist groups of Islam, in his dissertation on the subject Islamic Awakening between Rejection and Extremism. In it he warns of the dangers of blind obedience, bigotry and intolerance; rigidity‚Äîwhich deprives people of clarity of vision and the opportunity for dialogue with others; commitment to excessiveness, including the excessive application of minor or controversial Islamic issues to people in non-Muslim countries or to people who have only recently converted to Islam; harshness in the treatment of people, roughness in the manner of approach, and crudeness in calling people to Islam, all which are contrary to the teachings of the Qur'an and Sunnah. () On the other hand, Al- Qaradawi himself has advocated extremism and anti-semitism, denouncing Jews for their \\"corruption\\" and describing Adolf Hitler as having put Jews \\"in their place\\", while others believe Al-Qaradawi is merely \\"not afraid to state firmly that 'Palestinian martyr operations are a weapon of the weak'\\". Sufism Al-Qaradawi has been an avid caller to what he calls \\"Islamic Sufism\\", praising those who practice it as pious. Shi'as Al-Qaradawi has disparaged Shi'ites as innovators (mubtadi ø≈´n) and warned of the \\"Shiitization\\" of the Middle East, saying Shiite Muslims were \\"invading\\" Sunni societies. In response, the Iranian Mehr News Agency described Qaradawi as \\"a spokesman for international Freemasonry and rabbis\\".Try to be nice about each other, A Sunni preacher upsets the Shias 25 September 2008, CAIRO, The Economist Fellow members of the International Union of Muslim Scholars such as Mohammad Salim Al-Awa criticized Qaradawi for promoting divisions among Muslims. In May 2013, al-Qaradawi has also verbally attacked the Alawite sect, which many describe as an offshoot of Shia Islam and of which President Bashir al-Assad is a member, as \\"more infidel than Christians and Jews\\" (ÿ£ŸÉŸÅÿ± ŸÖŸÜ ÿßŸÑŸäŸáŸàÿØ ŸàÿßŸÑŸÜÿµÿßÿ±Ÿâ). However, in 2010, al-Qaradawi met with Shi'a scholar Ayatollah Hassan al-Saffar and urged to work their differences and come together and promote peace and disregard for sectarian strife like what the hardline are doing to create more dissension and discord between Shi'a and Sunni. Salafism (Wahhabism) Al-Qaradawi has been a staunch critic of Salafism (Wahhabism). He says this group stems its roots from Saudi Arabia and is just 200-years-old since its establishment compared to Islam which have existed for over 1,400 years who've lived in peace and harmony with Christians, Jews and other faiths. He says this group was created by Saudi Arabia's founder Ibn Saud together with Salafi (Wahhabi) founder Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab whom was all from Najd (today Riyadh) with the help of British after toppling the legitimate Islamic Empire of Ottomans which was mainstream Sunni Islam at that time and that it also see the oust of Hussein bin Ali (Sharif of Mecca) who're the original Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques in charge of Makkah's Al-Masjid al-Haram and Madinah's Al-Masjid an-Nabawi for over a thousand years since the time of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad whom is also the Prophet's direct descendant; the Hashemites, which now resides and rule over Jordan which have no natural resources and regarded as among the poorest Arab countries in the Middle East. Qaradawi warned the world that it were Salafists (Wahhabists) that has caused terrorism all over the world especially groups like Islamic State, Boko Haram, Al-Qaeda, Taliban, Al- Shabaab, Abu Sayyaf and other similar groups alike. He also said that Israel and America heavily exploits from these groups by funding them since the 1970s until the present-day to pursue their (Western) political agenda in controlling the vast wealth of oil, gas, coal and mine to further destabilized the natural-resource-rich Middle East and beyond. Qaradawi also said that if more terrorist attacks were to occur, Israel will greatly benefit from it as it will give boosts to the sales of Israeli security companies and firms to promote their high-tech equipment globally in both hard and software forms. Qaradawi stated that the deceitful evil implications of those countries' complicity with this group is irreversible and has no end in sight. He compared them (takfiri groups) to dogs from Hell-fire for using religion to kill the innocents. He further said that Ash'aris, Maturidis can overcome their tiny existence. He issued a fatwa (edict) in 2014 denouncing the Islamic State (Daesh) declaration of \\"caliphate\\" and its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as \\"invalid, null and void\\" from every aspect, every angle of the Islamic Sharia Law. =Non-Muslims= Al-Qaradawi has called for dialogue with Non- Muslims. He also puts emphasis on conversations with the West, including Jews, Christians, and secularists. He writes that this effort should differentiate itself from a debate, for the latter does not often result in mutual cooperation. Regarding the rights and citizenship of non-Muslim minorities, Qaradawi has said, \\"those people who live under the protection of an Islamic government enjoy special privileges. They are referred to as 'the Protected People' (dhimmi) ... In modern terminology, dhimmies are 'citizens' of the Islamic state. From the earliest period of Islam to the present day, Muslims are in unanimous agreement that they enjoy the same rights and carry the same responsibilities as Muslims themselves, while being free to practice their own faiths.\\" In his book titled The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam, al- Qaradawi wrote, \\"Islam does not prohibit Muslims to be kind and generous to peoples of other religions, even if they are idolaters and polytheists, ... it looks upon the People of the Book, that is, Jews and Christians, with special regard, whether they reside in a Muslim society or outside it. The Qur'an never addresses them without saying, 'O People of the Book' or 'O You who have been given the Book', indicating that they were originally people of a revealed religion. For this reason there exists a relationship of mercy and spiritual kinship between them and the Muslims.\\" Jews In May 2008, al-Qaradawi told visiting Rabbis from the Haredi, Anti-Zionist Neturei Karta sect, \\"there is no enmity between Muslims and Jews ... Jews who believe in the authentic Torah are very close to Muslims.\\" He has also expressed his belief that relations between Muslims and Jews became strained with the emergence of Zionism and the establishment of Israel. \\"Muslims are against the expansionist, oppressive Zionist movement, not the Jews.\\" Reportedly, in 1998 the Associated Press quoted al-Qaradawi writing, \\"There should be no dialogue with these people [Israelis] except with swords.\\"Profile: Yusuf al-Qaradawi The Investigative Project on Terrorism. In August 2005, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Dublin-based European Council for Fatwa and Research, of which al-Qaradhawi is president, had used the antisemitic Protocols of the Elders of Zion in its theological deliberations.Islamic Justice Finds a Foothold In Heart of Europe The Wall Street Journal, 4 August 2005, Vol nr. 24 Al-Qaradawi's remarks were sharply criticized by the Anti- Defamation League (ADL), which accused him of inciting violence against Jews.Sheik Yusuf al-Qaradawi: Theologian of Terror , Anti-Defamation League, 4 August 2009.Muslim Brotherhood Ideologue Incites Violence Against Jews and Israel , Anti-Defamation League (ADL), 2 February 2009.Multiculturalists diminish 'rough beast' ravaging Islam by Rory Leishman, IFPress.com, 31 October 2009.The bond between Nazis and Islam by Paul Berman, The Australian, 13 July 2010. In a 9 January 2009 sermon during the Gaza War, shown on Al- Jazeera, Qaradawi prayed (as translated by MEMRI): In a sermon broadcast on Qatar TV on 26 April 2013 (as translated by MEMRI), Qaradawi announced that he would not participate in an inter-faith dialogue if Jews were present, stating, \\"If you invite the Jews, I will not participate. I will participate in a Muslim-Christian meeting, but with the Jews there should be no debate.\\" Qaradawi stated that there can be \\"no debate whatsoever with those who have committed injustice\\" and \\"Those Jews have committed clear injustice against us. They have shed our blood, killed our children, displaced our people, seized our lands, and usurped our rights.\\" Later in his sermon, Qaradawi restated: \\"I cannot be a part of a conference in which wrongdoing Jews participate. They have committed great injustice, and I cannot possibly shake hands with them. Their hands are soiled with blood. They have murderous, violent, and oppressive hands. I cannot soil my hands by shaking theirs.\\"Leading Sunni Scholar Yousuf Al-Qaradawi Refuses to Participate in Interfaith Dialogue with Jews , MEMRITV, Clip No. 3825 (transcript), 26 April 2013. (Video clip available here ). Al-Qaradawi's statements were described as incitement to genocide in a Jewish Political Studies Review article, which connected his belief in Jewish conspiracies to the appeals to violence against them. The conspiracies al-Qaradawi is described as endorsing are \\"the Jews as the greatest enemies of Islam; alleges a Jewish plot to take over the entire Middle East, including Mecca and Medina; blames the Jews for the abolition of the Islamic Caliphate in 1924 and the spread of communism; and accuses the Jews of planning to tear down the al-Aqsa Mosque\\". Views on the Holocaust Al-Qaradawi has defended the mass murder of millions during the Holocaust as a \\"punishment.\\" In a statement that aired on Al-Jazeera TV on 28 January 2009 during the Gaza War, al-Qaradawi said the following regarding Adolf Hitler and the Holocaust (as translated by MEMRI):‚Äì Sheik Yousuf Al- Qaradhawi: Allah Imposed Hitler upon the Jews to Punish Them ‚Äì \\"Allah Willing, the Next Time Will Be at the Hand of the Believers\\" , MEMRITV, Clip no. 2005, Al-Jazeera TV (Qatar) ‚Äì 28‚Äì30 January 2009.Islamist movements casts shadow over Egypt by Robert Wistrich, Washington Jewish Week, 18 January 2012.Militant Islamism, Islamism, Islam by Clifford D. May, National Review, 19 January 2012.Sheik Yusuf al-Qaradawi: Theologian of Terror , Anti- Defamation League (ADL), 15 March 2011. =Apostasy= Al-Qaradawi says that apostasy ‚Äì Muslims leaving Islam ‚Äì is a grave danger to the Muslim community and that it is the duty of all Muslims \\"is to combat apostasy in all its forms and wherefrom it comes, giving it no chance to pervade in the Muslim world\\". In February 2013, Qaradawi stated on Egyptian television that the application of the death penalty for those who leave Islam is a necessity, stating, \\"If they had gotten rid of the apostasy punishment, Islam wouldn't exist today.\\" Qaradawi also cited several speeches and writings by Muhammad and his followers, such as Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:33, which he quoted as \\"The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His apostle is that they should be murdered or crucified.\\" Qaradawi further explained, \\" ... many hadiths, not only one or two, but many, narrated by a number of Muhammad's companions state that any apostate should be killed. Ibn 'Abbas's hadith: 'Kill whoever changes his faith [from Islam].'\\" With regards to the punishment of apostasy, al- Qaradawi supports the classical Islamic tradition on some points but differs on others. He considers execution as a penalty in principle, but the only apostates that are to be executed are those that combine other crimes with apostasy (e.g., \\"incit[ing] a war against Islam\\"). He also advocates apostates to be given a chance to repent. Finally, he believes that \\"hidden apostasy\\" (where the apostate does not \\"proclaim\\" his conversion) may be left to the judgement of God in the Hereafter. While al-Qaradawi believes that the Muslim community is not allowed to punish \\"intellectual apostasy\\", where the apostates do not \\"swagger\\" about their conversion, he still strongly condemns it. He says \\"These people are not noticed when they invade or begin to disseminate their falsehood, but they are mostly felt when they affect the minds. They do not use guns in their attacks, however, their attacks are fierce and cunning.\\" Nevertheless, he concedes, \\"Erudite scholars and well versed jurists ... can not take an action in face of such professional criminals who have firmly established themselves and have not left a chance for law to be enforced on them.\\" Political viewsFreedom and democracy= Al-Qaradawi has spoken in favor of democracy in the Muslim world, speaking of a need for reform of political climates in the Middle East specifically.Reform according to Islam . Al Jazeera English Muslim world needs democracy, says Qaradawi ‚Äì The Muslim News ‚Äì 8 July 2006 On 22 February 2011, he held an exclusive interview with OnIslam.net, dismissing the allegation that he wanted a religious state established in Egypt: \\"On the contrary, my speech supported establishing a civil state with a religious background, I am totally against theocracy. We are not a state for mullahs.\\"Govt pressure bans Qaradawi , 22 February 2011 =Terrorism= After the September 11 attacks, al-Qaradawi urged Muslims to donate blood for the victims and said: He denies that Palestinian suicide bombing attacks constitute terrorism, claiming, \\"when Palestinians face such unjust aggression, they tend to stem bloodletting and destruction and not to claim the lives of innocent civilians,\\" but qualifies that with \\"I do agree with those who do not allow such martyr operations to be carried out outside the Palestinian territories.\\" Al-Qaradawi has suggested the legitimate use of (defensive) suicide bombings against enemy combatants in modern times if the defending combatants have no other means of self-defense. The Oxford-based Malaysian Islamic Scholar, Dr. Afifi al-Akiti, rules that there is no Islamic legal precedent for this view and that female soldiers can only be killed in direct combat. With regards to suicide bombings he says that they are \\"breaching the scholarly consensus ... because to endanger one's life is one thing and to commit suicide during the attack is obviously another\\". With regards to male soldiers he states, \\"It goes without saying that they are considered combatants as soon as they arrive on the battlefield even if they are not in direct combat ‚Äì provided of course that the remaining conventions of war have been observed throughout, and that all this is during a valid war when there is no ceasefire.\\" Western governments have met al-Qaradawi to request release of European civilians kidnapped in Iraq and have thanked him officially, praising his cooperation. The French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier wrote to al-Qaradawi: \\"With such a clear condemnation of the abduction of the French hostages you have sent a clear-cut message demonstrating respect for the tenets of Islam.\\" =Israeli-Palestinian conflict= Al-Qaradawi condones Palestinian attacks on Israelis only if Israel continues its oppression and averts peace. A resolution issued by The Islamic Fiqh Council affiliated to the Saudi-run Muslim World League in its 14th session, held in Doha (Qatar) on 11‚Äì16 January 2003 has upheld his views on the matter.source? Defending bombings against Israeli civilians, al-Qaradawi told BBC Newsnight in 2005 that: * \\"An Israeli woman is not like women in our societies, because she is a soldier.\\" * \\"I consider this type of martyrdom operation as an evidence of God's justice.\\" * \\"Allah Almighty is Just; through His infinite Wisdom He has given the weak a weapon the strong do not have and that is their ability to turn their bodies into bombs as Palestinians do.\\" He supports suicide attacks on all Israelis, including women since he views the Israeli society as a \\"completely military\\" society that did not include any civilians. He also considers pregnant women and their unborn babies to be valid targets on the ground that the babies could grow up to join the Israeli Army. At the press conference held by the organizations sponsoring his visit to London, al- Qaradawi reiterated his view that suicide attacks are a justified form of resistance to Israeli occupation of the rightfully Palestinian territories. He has also justified his views by stating that all Israeli civilians are potential soldiers, since Israel is a \\"militarized society\\". Because of these views, al-Qaradawi has been accused by Western countries and Israel of supporting terrorism. An article wrote by Jewish editor Michael Slackman from Los Angeles Times later (The New York Times), commenting on suicide bombings conducted by Palestinians against Israelis al-Qaradawi declared during an interview with the newspaper Al Raya in April 2001: \\"They are not suicide operations. These are heroic martyrdom operations, and the heroes who carry them out don't embark on this action out of hopelessness and despair but are driven by an overwhelming desire to cast terror and fear into the hearts of the oppressors.\\" Al-Qaradawi is opposed to attacks outside of the Palestinian Territories and Israel, and against non-Israeli targets. For example, on 20 March 2005, he condemned a car bombing that had occurred in Doha, Qatar the previous day. One Briton, Jon Adams was killed. Al-Qaradawi issued a statement that said According to IslamOnline, Qaradawi released a fatwa on 14 April 2004 stating boycott of American and Israeli products was an obligation for all who are able. The fatwa reads in part : On 8 May 2013, Qaradawi visited Gaza and gave a speech in support of Hamas. He asked all of the Palestinian people to work with other Arab people and Muslims around the world to destroy Israel, saying inflammatory things such as \\"Our wish should be that we carry out Jihad to death\\" and \\"We should seek to liberate Palestine, all of Palestine, inch by inch.\\" More recently according to The Investigative Project on Terrorism report wrote by Anti-Islam journalist Steven Emerson, al-Qaradawi published a message in Arabic on his website which was translated by The Investigative Project on Terrorism in which he called on Muslims to join the \\"greatest battle of liberation\\" against Israel and against the Jews in general. The preacher allegedly protested the closure of Temple Mount after the assassination attempt that killed an Israeli activist, where the third holiest shrine for Islam is located, namely Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque. Along the same line citing from New York-based Jewish-run ADL (Anti-Defamation League) report, on 24 January 2011 al-Qaradawi had voiced his desire to see Jerusalem conquered in a fatwa in which he claimed that it was the Muslims' duty to \\"defend\\" Jerusalem with \\"their lives, their money and all they pos-sess, or else they will be subject to Allah's punishment.\\" In July 2015, al-Qaradawi argued on the TV show Ala-Masouliyati (I Am Responsible) that it is permissible for suicide bombers to self-detonate if requested by a group. Conversely, individuals are prohibited from carrying out suicide bombings on their own. On the subject of the Western Wall, Qaradawi said: =Iraq war= In 2004 the International Union of Muslim Scholars, an organization chaired by al-Qaradawi which counts a great number of prominent individual affiliated to the Muslim Brotherhood and/or Hamas among its members, ruled that \\"resisting occupation troops in Iraq is a 'duty' on able Muslims in and outside the war- torn country and that aiding the occupier is impermissible.\\" In an address aired on Qatar TV on 5 January 2007, al-Qaradawi questioned the trial of Saddam Hussein under American supervision in Iraq, but agreed to it if it were conducted by the Iraqi people \\"after liberating Iraq from American colonialism\\". He also suggested that the trial was \\"an act of vengeance by the Americans\\" for his missile attacks on Israel. He strongly criticized the way Saddam was hanged: =Hezbollah= In 2006, in response to Muslim scholar Abdullah Ibn Jibreen's fatwa declaring that it was forbidden for Muslims to support or pray for Hezbollah because they are Shia, al-Qaradawi said that supporting Hezbollah is a religious duty for all Muslims and that resistance, whether in Palestine or Lebanon, is the most noble act. He added \\"Shias agree with the Sunnis in the main principles of Islam while the differences are only over the branches\\" and also called upon the Sunnis and Shia of Iraq to end the civil war.. Gulf Times Seven years later, during the Syrian Civil War, Qaradawi urged all Sunnis to fight Hezbollah, attacking Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah and Iran: \\"The leader of the Party of Satan comes to fight the Sunnis ... Now we know what the Iranians want ... They want continued massacres to kill Sunnis.\\"Syria conflict: Cleric Qaradawi urges Sunnis to join rebels BBC News, 1 June 2013 Qaradawi also stated that he now regretted having advocated rapprochement between Sunnis and Shias and his 2006 defense of Hezbollah. =Arab Spring= Qaradawi declared his support for the rebels led by the National Transitional Council in the 2011 Libyan civil war, urging Arab nations to recognize them and \\"to confront the tyranny of the regime in Tripoli\\". He suggested weapons be sent to the rebels to assist the, and said \\"Our Islamic nation should stand against injustice and corruption and I urge the Egyptian government to extend a helping hand to Libyan people and not to Gaddafi.\\" In response to the 2011 Bahrain protests, Qaradawi was reluctant to give support: \\"The protests in Bahrain are sectarian in nature. The Shias are revolting against the Sunnis.\\" He claimed that Shia protesters attack Sunnis and occupied their mosques. He acknowledged that the Shia majority had legitimate concerns in regards to fairness with the Sunnis: \\"I want them to be real citizens of their country.\\" Qaradawi said that all Arabs should back up the protesters in the 2011 Syrian uprising, saying \\"Today the train of revolution has reached a station that it had to reach: The Syria station,\\" and \\"It is not possible for Syria to be separated from the history of the Arab community.\\" He declared his support for the protests against what he called Syria's \\"oppressive regime\\", claiming \\"atrocities\\" were committed by it. He called for victory against the ruling Ba'ath party and claimed the army would be the major factor in the revolt. He claimed that when he offered to mediate negotiations between the Muslim Brotherhood and the Syrian government, someone deliberately sabotaged it. Qaradawi also expressed his support for the No Fly zone put in place by western nations over Libya, saying \\"The operation in Libya is to protect the civilians from Gaddafi's tyranny\\" and slamming Arab League leader Amr Moussa for criticism of it. Women, gender and other issues Commenting on the role women played in social active issues: =Rape= According to Kamal Badr, Qaradawi advocates that rape victims be protected by society: > Thus, many Muslim scholars, led by Sheikh Al-Qaradawi, have maintained that > young Muslim men should hasten to marry women who fall as rape victims, so > as to reduce their suffering and console them, to compensate them for the > loss of the most precious thing that they possess. This reflects mutual > love, rapport and altruism that prevail in the Muslim society.‚ÄúQaradawi: > Muslim men should hasten to marry women who fall as rape victims‚Äù > www.aboutislam.net =Wife beating= Al-Qaradawi told The Guardian that wife beating was neither \\"obligatory nor desirable\\" but that he \\"accepts it as a method of last resort ‚Äì though only lightly\\". He stated on Channel 4 News that it was justifiable in certain circumstances but the \\"ideal was for Muslim men never to beat their wives, and if husbands wrongly beat their wives, they have the right to fight back\\". The British newspaper The Daily Telegraph writes that al-Qaradawi, in his book The Lawful and Prohibited in Islam, states that wife- beating is permissible after the failure of all other means of persuasion. In such circumstances, a husband may beat his wife \\"lightly with his hands, avoiding her face and other sensitive areas\\".Al-Qaradawi, Yusuf. The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam, Chapter 3:The Halal and the Haram in Marriage And Family Life -> Divorce -> Rebelliousness and Strife =Female genital mutilation (FGM)= Qaradawi says female genital mutilation surgery is forbidden in Islam. He calls on ending and banned to Female Circumcision in some parts of the Muslim world, especially in rural Africa where most still practice it. His views were supported by Sheikhs in Al-Azhar. =Female masturbation= Qaradawi urged women to not masturbate and said that its dangerous to insert things into the vagina. =Homosexuality= On 5 June 2006, on the Al Jazeera program Sharia and Life, al-Qaradawi (a regular on the program) reiterated orthodox views on homosexuality. When asked about the punishment for people who \\"practise liwaat (sodomy) or sihaaq (lesbian activity)\\", al-Qaradawi replied: \\"The same punishment as any sexual pervert ‚Äì the same as the fornicator.\\" (MEMRI translation). The punishment for fornication is lashing. In an interview with Der Spiegel, Qaradawi said that his attitude towards homosexuality is the same as that found in Christianity. In the interview he stated, \\"One year ago, there was a demonstration against me in London because I spoke out against homosexuality. People seem to have forgotten that it wasn't me who came up with this mindset. It's part of God's order spoken of by Moses and even mentioned by Jesus.\\" However, there are rigorous scholarly debates among the Islamic School of Law (Fiqh) as to whether LGBT are define by genetic disorders and that it may be permissible or not for those who're scientifically-medically-proven to be part of the LGBT category as with hermaphrodite denoting whether a person is incline towards the naturality of female or male instinct. Same for Mukhannathun (Transgender), in which there are many prophetic Hadith that allows male who have inclinations towards being female (effeminate) that occurred during the Islamic prophet Muhammad's time and that they were accepted as part of the larger community in Madinah having equal rights. Qaradawi is one of many among the leading Islamic scholars who's in this ongoing debate. =Stoning= Al- Qaradawi calls \\"stoning\\" un-Islamic for it has nothing to do with Islam at all but laws made by the religion of Judaism; Jewish Religious Laws. He says there are more than dozens of verses in the Torah that support stoning for adulterers, fornicators, LGBT people, and for many other reasons. =Honor killing= Al-Qaradawi says that honor killing is a tradition that was carried out thousands of years ago by ancient civilization; the Romans, the Dark Ages, Chinese Emperors, etc. He says, it has nothing to do with Islam; neither Qur'an nor Sunnah (Prophetic Hadith). He calls on those who done it to be punishable with death for their crime; a life for a life. =Mawlid (Muhammad's birthday)= Al-Qaradawi fully supports and advocates Mawlid. He says that to use the birth date of Muhammad in remembrance of his life story is not Bid'ah (Innovation). In fact, it is encouraged in Islam to do good action (Man Sanna Sunnatun Hassanah) based on a Sahih Hadith. And that Allah (God) himself have said in Al-Qur'an, Chapter 21, Verse 107: Al-Qaradawi explains that Allah (God) is talking about Muhammad's miracle birth as the verse mentions \\"sent you\\". In other words, his presence, his birth, his coming. A \\"mercy\\" (rahmah) to the worlds. Means mercy to all mankind. It means everything; all of his creations (all creatures). It's in this Sahih Hadith that Sheikh Prof. Dr. Yusuf al-Qaradawi emphasizes that good innovative actions is strongly encouraged for as long as it doesn't goes against the Sharia (Islamic Law). What more involving religion itself than worldly good deeds like holding an old person's hand while crossing the road guiding him/her to safety and many more. It's encouraging for both. He says these is the true meaning and emphasis of Islam, to be the religion of mercy (rahmah) and to do more good than just good so that others may lead by our good examples and that they may successively follows them till End of Time.Sheikh Prof. Dr. Yusuf al-Qaradawi on the Importance of Mawlid, , 15 June 2017 =Niqab= Al-Qaradawi says that niqab (veil) is not obligatory in Islam. He has pointed out that a woman's face is not an awrah. He calls those who don the niqabs as following tradition and culture before Islam came to Arabia. Those people, be it male or female at that time, had to cover their faces from dusty desert and from inhaling dust especially during sandstorms. Al-Azhar's Grand Imam, also an Egyptian Grand Mufti Sheikh Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy, have also called out that niqab has nothing to do with Islam.Shaykh Yusuf Qaradawi (HA) on Niqab and \\"Interaction\\" of men and women , 20 June 2017Niqab in Focus by IslamOnline.net, 21 June 2017 =Organ transplant= At the same time Qaradawi issued a fatwa (edict) that organ transplant from living to a living person is permissible in Islam but through donation as donation is considered charity. As for a dead person, only when the brain stops, the transplant can then be carried out. Other views ;Mecca Time In April 2008, at a conference in Qatar titled \\"Mecca: the Center of the Earth, Theory and Practice\\", al-Qaradawi advocated the implementation of Mecca Time to replace the Greenwich Meridian as the basis of the world time zone system. ;Muhammed Cartoon Controversy Al-Qaradawi called for a \\"Day of Anger\\" over the cartoons, but condemned violent actions in response to them. ;Amman Message Al-Qaradawi is one of the Ulama signatories of the Amman Message, which gives a broad foundation for defining Muslim orthodoxy. ;Salman Rushdie Al-Qaradawi said, \\"Rushdie disgraced the honor of the Prophet and his family and defiled the values of Islam,\\" but he never backed the fatwa calling for his death. ;Muslim Brotherhood In 1997, Qaradawi's affiliation with the Muslim Brotherhood led to his expulsion from Egypt, a country where this organisation was at the time prohibited. Al-Qaradawi was a follower of Hasan al-Banna during his youth and a longtime member of the Muslim Brotherhood. He has twice turned down offers to be its leader. In an interview on the Dream channel, al-Qaradawi states the following about his relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood (MB): On 16 May 2015 al-Qaradawi has been sentenced to death in absentia by an Egyptian court along with the ousted President Mohamed Morsi and over 100 other Egyptians affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood. As reported by the Interpol website, Qaradawi is wanted by the judicial authorities of Egypt for \\"Agreement, incitement and assistance to commit intentional murder, helping the prisoners to escape, arson, vandalism and theft.\\" ;Reality TV Qaradawi has criticised reality TV programs, saying that the aim of these is to 'mislead the [Muslim] nation'. Reception in the Muslim world Al-Qaradawi, a forefront of contemporary Muslim thinkers and scholars. His vast contributions include more than 80 books and hundreds of articles on different Islamic issues, ranging from the fundamental principles and laws of Islam to the needs and challenges of modern Muslim societies. His knowledge, intellect, moderation and unrelenting efforts to bring Islam to a larger audience have gained him the respect of millions of Muslims and non-Muslims worldwide. His famous Television program Ash-Shariah wal-Hayat (Sharia and Life) has an estimated 700‚Äì800 million viewers worldwide.King Faisal International Prize, Biography Yousef A. Al-Qaradawi, 10 June 2010 Despite his fame. In 2012, Qardawi traded barbs with fellow Muslim cleric Abu Abd al-Rahman Ibn Aqil al-Zahiri due to what Ibn Aqil perceived as hypocritical positions of Qardawi during the Arab Spring,Khalid al-Saif, \\"This is what Ibn Aqil said about Qardawi!\\" 6 October 2012. a charge he denied. Pakistani scholar, Muhammad Taqi Usmani stated, \\"There is no doubt that I‚Äîas the lowest student of Islamic Fiqh‚Äîwith my benefitting from the books of the outstanding Dr al-QaradƒÅwƒ´ to a very large extent, and my supreme wonderment at the majority of [his works], have found myself, in some particular issues, not in agreement with him in the results that he has arrived at, but these sorts of differences (ikhtilƒÅf) in views based on juristic judgement (ijtihƒÅdƒ´) are natural, and cannot be the [sole] basis for judging [their author] so long as the people of knowledge do not deem [the bearers of such opinions] to be weak intellectually, or in religion, and [in any case] the importance of these books and their value in scholarship and da'wa are not affected by this to even the slightest, most insignificant degree.\\" In addition, he refers to some modern scholars by writing, \\"What we see today, very unfortunately, is that the one who brings forward elevated ideas in his writings and lofty theories in his speech and his sermons often does not rise above the level of the layman\\" but exempts Qardawi by saying, \\"As for the outstanding, erudite scholar, Dr Y≈´suf al-QaradƒÅwƒ´, may God (Most High) preserve him, God (Most High) has indeed made me fortunate enough to accompany him in travels and in residence, and sit with him and closely associate with him in long and repeated meetings. [From this] I found him manifest in his personality exemplary Islamic qualities, for he is a human being before he is a Muslim, and a devoted Muslim before he is a caller to Islam (dƒÅ'i), and a caller to Islam before he is a scholar and jurist.\\" The Doƒüu T√ºrkistan B√ºlteni Haber Ajansƒ±, which supports the Turkistan Islamic Party, attacked Yusuf al-Qaradawi and called his creed \\"perverted\\" and claimed that he was followed by \\"democratic polytheists\\". Qaradawi was attacked by Hani Al-Siba'i. Controversy=On Syria and Russia Qaradawi stated that Russia is an \\"enemy of Islam\\" due to the country's military relations with the Syrian regime. His remarks drew harsh criticism from Muslims in Russia. According to Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov, \\"Qaradawi's statements had given rise to amazement among the Muslims of Russia.\\" Kadyrov asserted that Qaradawi's statements are mainly \\"directed against the Muslims of Russia, who are citizens of this country, were born here and live here, and who care about their country\\". Kadyrov claimed that \\"It is not Russia that is supplying weapons and money for the thousands of mercenaries from all over the world who have flooded Syria and are committing daily terrorist attacks, in which the blood of women, old people and children is shed,\\" Entry into western countries Al-Qaradawi has been banned from entering the United States since 1999 and the United Kingdom since 2008, though he visited London in 2004.Militant Ideology Atlas , Combating Terrorism Center, West Point The lobby group MEMRI said it helped play a role in the measures. In July 2003, he visited Stockholm, Sweden, for a conference at the Stockholm Mosque arranged by the Muslim Association of Sweden. During the conference al-Qaradawi expressed his support for suicide attacks against Israeli civilians, calling the fight against the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian Territories a \\"necessary Jihad\\". France announced in March 2012 it will not let him enter.France election: Sarkozy vows ban on militant preachers , BBC, 26 March 2012 Fatwa controversy with MEMRI The Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) (citing Asharq Al-Awsat), alleges that al-Qaradawi issued a Fatwa following the Iraqi insurgency, saying, > All of the Americans in Iraq are combatants, there is no difference between > civilians and soldiers, and one should fight them, since the American > civilians came to Iraq in order to serve the occupation. The abduction and > killing of Americans in Iraq is a [religious] obligation so as to cause them > to leave Iraq immediately. The mutilation of corpses [however] is forbidden > in Islam. Al-Qaradawi, however, denies this allegation: > I have not published a Fatwa on this issue. At the Egyptian Journalists' > Union a few days ago I was asked about the permissibility of fighting > against the occupation in Iraq, and I answered that it is permitted. > Afterwards I was asked concerning the American civilians in Iraq and I > merely responded with the question ‚Äì are there American civilians in Iraq? > It is a matter of common knowledge that in Fatwas such as these I do not use > the word \\"killing\\" but rather I say \\"struggle\\", which is a more > comprehensive word than the word \\"killing\\" and whose meaning is not > necessarily to kill. In addition, I have condemned the taking of hostages on > a number of occasions in the past and have demanded that they be released > and that their lives not be threatened.MEMRI as above, citing Al Hayat Shaker Al-Nabulsi, a former Muslim who writes for the liberal site Ethal, called for the creation of a petition to the UN calling to put Qaradawi and his like on trial for incitement and support of terrorism. Alcohol fatwa controversy Al-Qaradawi issued a fatwa in 2008, stating that the consumption of tiny amounts of alcohol (<0.5% concentration or 5/1000) was acceptable for Muslims. The statement was made regarding energy drinks, where fermentation occurs naturally as part of the production process. Some people think that this does not contradict the widespread view that consuming alcohol is totally forbidden to Muslims. The fermentation in this process is natural and unavoidable, similarly it is an extremely small proportion. Terrorist allegations In October 2004, according to Saudi Arabia's newspaper \\"The Arab News\\" based in New York and Jeddah, over 2,500 Muslim intellectuals from 23 countries signed a petition addressed to the United Nations to raise awareness on the use of religion for incitement to violence. Al-Qaradawi was mentioned among \\"the sheikhs of death,\\" as the signatories defined those who manipulate religion to incite violence, for \\"providing a religious cover for terrorism.\\" A charge al-Qaradawi dismissed as baseless and slanderous. For his stance, he was against Salafism (Wahhabism) extremist ideology culminating from Saudi Arabia itself. The sheikh has been banned from entering the U.S. since 1999. In 2008, the UK Home Office stated that al-Qaradawi was denied a visa to enter Britain for medical treatment because of fears that his preaching \\"could foster inter-community violence.\\" In March 2012, the French President Nicolas Sarkozy declared his decision to block the entry of extremists in the country after the Toulouse attacks, and specifically mentioned al-Qaradawi as one of those barred from entering France. Qaradawi chairs the Union of Good, a coalition of Islamic charities supporting Hamas' infrastructure, an organisation on the US State Department list of foreign terrorist organizations. In December 2014 the International Union of Muslim Scholars led by al-Qaradawi was expelled from the Cairo-based International Islamic Council for Da'wah and Relief based on the allegation that the group mixed religion and politics and supported terrorism. The Consortium Against Terrorist Finance reports that, in 2010, Qaradawi was listed as the chairman of the Sharia supervisory board of Qatar Islamic Bank, one of the Qatari sharia-compliant giants which has allegedly a long history of cooperation with controversial financial entities. He is also a former Sharia adviser and shareholder to Bank al-Taqwa, once listed by the U.S and the UN as a terrorist financier associated with al-Qaeda but delisted in 2010. Personal life Al-Qaradawi was born in Egypt but lives in Qatar. He has three sons and four daughters, three of whom hold doctorates from British Universities. His daughter, Ilham Yousef Al-Qaradawi, is an internationally recognized nuclear scientist. His son, Abdurrahman Yusuf al-Qaradawi, is a poet and a political activist in Egypt.Abdurrahman Yusuf al-Qaradawi: new branches of National Association for Change Will open soon in Europe and the United States Awards and recognition Al-Qaradawi has been awarded by various countries and institutions for his contributions to Islamic society.

His most famous work is The Lawful and Prohibited in Islam. Professor Mustafa al-Zarqa declared that owning a copy of it was \\"the duty of every Muslim family\\". Fiqh al-Zakat His book Fiqh al-Zakat is considered by some as the most comprehensive work in the area of zakat. Abul Ala Maududi commented on it as \\"the book of this century in Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh)\\" The prominent Deobandi Islamic scholar Muhammad Taqi Usmani, said this about the work:Y≈´suf al-QaradƒÅwƒ´, as I Have Known Him () > The first book that read in its entirety of his works is his valuable book > Fiqh al-Zakat, and I benefitted much from this great, encyclopedic, > rewarding work through which the author did a great service to the second of > the pillars of Islam, in a way that the umma needs today, when it comes to > the application of zakat at the level of the individual and the group. > Indeed this work manifested the genius of its author, and his inventive > methodology, not only in the clarification of issues pertaining to zakat and > their compilation, but in stimulating research in contemporary topics that > no one before him had touched upon, and basing them upon the principles fiqh > and its jurisprudential theory.

The second creation, in 1800, was for Charles Cadogan, 3rd Baron Cadogan. History Of Welsh origin, the family name was spelled Cadwgan until the early 15th century. According to Burke's Peerage, the family descends from: Rees ap Griffith ap Llewelyn ap Meredith Bengoch ap Howell (Lord of Penbuallt) ap Sitsylt (Lord of Builth) ap Llewelyn (Lord of Builth) ap Cadwgan ap Elystan Glodrydd (\\"The Renowned\\"), Prince of Fferreg, of Dol-y- Gaer, Breconshire. Major William Cadogan (1601‚Äì1661), a cavalry officer in Oliver Cromwell's army. His son Henry Cadogan was a barrister in Dublin. His eldest son William Cadogan was a noted soldier, politician and diplomat. He was a general in the army and fought in the War of the Spanish Succession and also served as Ambassador to the Netherlands and as Master-General of the Ordnance. In 1716, he was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain as Baron Cadogan, of Reading in the County of Berkshire, with normal remainder to the heirs male of his body. In 1718, he was further honoured when he was made Baron Cadogan, of Oakley in the County of Buckingham, with remainder, failing heirs male of his own, to his younger brother Charles Cadogan and the heirs male of his body, and Viscount Caversham, in the County of Oxford, and Earl Cadogan, in the County of Denbigh, with remainder to the heirs male of his body. These titles were also in the Peerage of Great Britain. Lord Cadogan had two daughters but no sons, so on his death in 1726, three titles‚Äîthe barony of 1716, the viscountcy, and earldom‚Äîbecame extinct. However, he was succeeded in the barony of 1718 according to the special remainder by his brother Charles, the second Baron. He was a General of the Horse and also represented Reading and Newport, Isle of Wight, in the House of Commons. Cadogan married Elizabeth, second daughter and heiress of the prominent physician and collector Sir Hans Sloane. Through this marriage the Sloane estates in central London came into the Cadogan family, and these have been the basis of the family wealth ever since. His son, the third Baron, sat as Member of Parliament for Cambridge and served as Master of the Mint. In 1800 the earldom of Cadogan held by his uncle was revived when he was created Viscount Chelsea, in the County of Middlesex, and Earl Cadogan. These titles were in the Peerage of Great Britain. His youngest son, the third Earl (who succeeded his half- brother in 1832), was an admiral in the Royal Navy. In 1831, one year before he succeeded in the earldom, he was raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom in his own right as Baron Oakley, of Caversham in the County of Oxford. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the fourth Earl. He was a Conservative politician and served under Lord Derby and Benjamin Disraeli as whip, Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard from 1866 to 1868. His eldest son, the fifth Earl, was also a noted Conservative politician. He held office under Disraeli and later Lord Salisbury as Under-Secretary of State for War, Under- Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord Privy Seal and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (with a seat in the cabinet). His second son Henry Cadogan, Viscount Chelsea, heir apparent to the earldom from 1878 to 1908, represented Bury St Edmunds in Parliament as a Conservative, but died in 1908, seven years before his father. His only son Edward, Viscount Chelsea, died in 1910 at the age of seven. Lord Cadogan was therefore succeeded by his third but eldest surviving son, the sixth Earl. As of 2017, the titles are held by the latter's grandson, the eighth Earl, who succeeded his father in 1997. Several other members of the Cadogan family have gained distinction. Lady Sarah Cadogan, daughter of the first Earl of the first creation, married Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond, and was the mother of the famous Lennox sisters (and also the grandmother of Charles James Fox). The Hon. Sir George Cadogan, second son of the third Earl, was a general in the army. Two further members represented seats in the House of Commons. The Hon. Sir Alexander Cadogan, eighth and youngest son of the fifth Earl, was the most senior civil servant to a troubled government department (Permanent Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs) between 1938 and 1946, that of World War II and his personal notes reflect his part in shaping the policies which aided the survival of Britain and its British Empire's resources in Asia during that war. The Earls Cadogan are wealthy landowners, having planned and developed and still owning Cadogan Estates, which covers much of Chelsea and parts of the much smaller area of Knightsbridge, and second only to the Duke of Westminster as Central London's richest landlords (whose surname, Grosvenor, is also closely associated with some of the most ornate London architecture).

The encoding resembles that used by many abacuses, with four beads indicating either 0 through 4 or 5 through 9 and another bead indicating which of those ranges. Several human languages, most notably Khmer and Wolof, also use biquinary systems. For example, the Khmer word for 6, pram muoy, literally means five [plus] one. The numerals from 0 to 9 in Japanese Sign Language is based on bi-quinary, with the thumb acting as 5 units, and the rest of the fingers each standing for 1 unit. Roman numerals use a symbolic, rather than positional, bi-quinary base, even though Latin is completely decimal. Examples Copy of a Roman abacus Suanpan (the number represented in the picture is 6,302,715,408) Several different representations of bi-quinary coded decimal have been used by different machines. The two- state component is encoded as one or two bits, and the five-state component is encoded using three to five bits. Some examples are: * Roman and Chinese abacuses * Stibitz relay calculators at Bell Labs from Model II onwards * FACOM 128 relay calculators at Fujitsu * IBM 650 - seven bits : Two bi bits: 0 5 and five quinary bits: 0 1 2 3 4, with error checking. : Exactly one bi bit and one quinary bit is set in a valid digit.

It follows the design of the national flag. The three pointed shield is used to symbolize the three major ethnic groups of Bosnia, as well as allude to the shape of the country. Historic arms One of the earliest, if not the earliest, coats of arms attributed to Bosnia come from the Fojnica armorial, which was completed in 1340. The Fojniƒçki arms are shown upon a gold shield, two black ragged staffs are crossed in saltire with two Moor's heads surmounting the upper portion of each staff. Overall is a red inescutcheon that was charged with an eight-pointed star and crescent. In the subsequent centuries, European sources would attribute arms to Bosnia that were heavily influenced by this depiction. Coat of arms of the Kingdom of Bosnia The coat of arms of the Kings of Bosnia, who ruled from 1377 until 1463 over the area that is present day Bosnia-Herzegovina and Dalmatia, consisted of a blue shield with six Golden Lilies displayed around a white bend, all within a gold bordure; the Golden Lily is the Lilium bosniacum, which is a native lily to the area. The crest is a plume of peacock feathers that sit within a coronet of lilies. The House of Kotromaniƒá reigned until 1463 when the Ottomans conquered the region, ceasing then the use of the royal coat of arms in Bosnia. The heraldic display of the kings would later be the basis for the arms adopted by the republic in 1992. After Herzegovina and Bosnia were occupied by the Austrian-Hungarian Empire in 1878, both condominia received arms from the Empire. The heraldic achievement of Stjepan Vukƒçiƒá Kosaƒça served as inspiration, who was a fifteenth-century nobleman that ruled over the region as Grand Duke of Bosnia and Herzeg of St. Sava. His armorial bearings displayed both a red armoured arm brandishing a sword and a red lion rampant upon a white shield, with two red bars running across the chief. Herzegovina would be given a red shield with a bare arm holding a broken lance for its coat of arms in this same fashion. The coat of arms of Bosnia would be gold with a red armoured arm issuing out of clouds, brandishing a sword. Though both condominia fell under the crown of Hungary, only Bosnia would be included in the greater arms of the Hungarian Kings. In the nineteenth century, the nationalist movement that had risen against both the former Ottoman rule and contemporary Austro-Hungarian occupation temporarily revived the arms from the Fojnica armorial. Communist Era Emblem of the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Yugoslav period. The emblem, along with the flag, of the socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was adopted on 31 December 1946. The description of the emblem was similar to the other Yugoslav republics. The device had two crossing stems of wheat in front of scheme of a neighbourhood with two factory chimneys out of which there is smoke. Around the decorative branches and wheat, there is a red track that spirals around. At the top of the emblem is a red star with a golden frame. The red star symbolizes the socialism and communism of Yugoslavia at the time. The device represents the industry Bosnia and Herzegovina had at the time. The factory chimneys show the industry of several important Bosnian, then Yugoslav, towns and their vital influence towards the economy. All of the Yugoslav republics had similar emblems, but Bosnia and Herzegovina was the only that did not portray nationalistic symbols, representing its multiethnic composition. The national emblem of the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was exactly the same as was the previous device of the People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and defined in its Constitution. This was the first emblem ever in the history of both the regions of Herzegovina and Bosnia that was specific to the entire modern country of Bosnia and Herzegovina.ƒêorƒëeviƒá, Jovan. Ustavno pravo FNRJ, Izd. Arhiva za pravne i dru≈°tvene nauke, Beograd, 1953., str. 427. Modern arms Coat of arms used from 1992 until 1998, taken from the arms of Tvrtko I of Bosnia. The coat of arms of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was adopted on 4 May 1992 and is aesthetically similar to that of the Kotromaniƒá dynasty. It had a blue background divided by a diagonal white line (called bendlet or riband in heraldry). The diagonal white line is supposed to symbolize the sword of Tvrtko and his might as a ruler. The coat of arms was designed in a hurry, right at the beginning of the Bosnian War, which lasted for three years. At the end of the war, there came uproar from the Bosnian Serbs arguing that the coat of arms solely represented Bosniaks. The international community, represented in Bosnia and Herzegovina through the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, was the instrument to solve the controversy. In early 1998, a commission for the flag change was created and the same year the current coat of arms was adopted in order to help alleviate the tensions among the country's various ethnicities. Official description The official description of the coat of arms is as follows:Zakon o grbu Bosne i Hercegovine, ƒålan 4 The coat of arms of Bosnia and Herzegovina is blue and in shape of a shield with a pointed end. In the upper right corner of the shield is located a yellow triangle. Parallel to the left side of the triangle stretches a row of white five-pointed stars.

Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy and the director of the Cambridge Observatory, he investigated a wide range of physical phenomena though made few lasting contributions outside astronomy. He is best remembered for his missed opportunity to discover the planet Neptune in 1846. Early life Challis was born in Braintree, Essex where his father, John Challis, was a stonemason. After attending various local schools, he graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1825 as Senior Wrangler and first Smith's prizeman. He was elected a fellow of Trinity in 1826 and was ordained in 1830. He held the benefice of Papworth Everard, Cambridgeshire from the college until 1852. In 1831 Challis married Sarah Copsey, n√©e Chandler, a widow, and consequently resigned his Trinity fellowship. The couple had a son and a daughter.Clerke (2006) Plumian professor In 1836, he became director of the Cambridge Observatory and Plumian Professor, holding the latter post until his death. He lectured in all areas of physics. As examiner for the Smith's prize, he appraised the early work of G. G. Stokes, Arthur Cayley, John Couch Adams, William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin), Peter Guthrie Tait and James Clerk Maxwell. For over a decade, in correspondence and publications, Challis repeatedly disagreed with Stokes's conclusions from his research.David B. Wilson, 'Stokes, Sir George Gabriel, first baronet', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 Challis was referee for Thomson and for Stokes in their respective applications for chairs at the University of Glasgow, and for Maxwell at Aberdeen. He and Thomson together set and examined the Adams prize topic on Saturn's rings, won by Maxwell in 1857. Cambridge Observatory Challis succeeded George Biddell Airy at the observatory and gradually improved the instrumentation and accuracy of observations. He made some early observations of the fracture of comet 3D/Biela into two pieces on 15 January 1846 and re-observed both fragments in 1852. He published over 60 scientific papers recording other observations of comets and asteroids. He invented the meteoroscope (1848) and the transit- reducer (1849). Challis published twelve volumes of Astronomical Observations Made at the Observatory of Cambridge. He and his wife lived at the observatory as genial hosts for 25 years, though Challis once left his wife to guard an intruder while he summoned assistance. Challis eventually resigned the observatory post because of the chronic stress that his inability to keep up with processing new astronomical observations was causing him. His predecessor Airy had taken a more relaxed attitude. He was succeeded by Adams though he maintained his professorship until his death. The search for the eighth planet In 1846, Airy finally persuaded a skeptical Challis to join in the search for an eighth planet in the solar system. Adams had predicted the location of such a planet as early as 1844, based on irregularities in the orbit of Uranus. Adams failed to promote his prediction successfully and there was little enthusiasm for a systematic search of the heavens until Airy's intervention. Challis finally began his, somewhat reluctant, search in July 1846, unaware that Frenchman Urbain Le Verrier had independently made an identical prediction. German astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle, assisted by Heinrich Louis d'Arrest, finally confirmed Le Verrier's prediction on 23 September. The planet was named \\"Neptune\\". It soon became apparent from Challis's notebooks that he had observed Neptune twice, a month earlier, failing to make the identification through lack of diligence and a current star chart. Challis was full of remorse but blamed his neglect on the pressing business of catching up on the backlog of astronomical observations from the observatory. As he reflected in a letter to Airy of 12 October 1846:Eggen (1970‚Äì1981) p.187 Physicist Challis also worked in hydrodynamics and in optics where he supported the wave theory of light and advanced the theory of a luminiferous ether as a medium for its propagation. However, he rejected the idea that the ether was an elastic solid, insisting that it was a fluid, bringing him into conflict with Airy and Stokes. Driven by Sir Isaac Newton's somewhat obscure assertion of \\"a certain most subtle spirit which pervades and lies hid in all gross bodies\\",Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, 2.547 Challis was driven to attempt to derive all physical phenomena from a model of inert spherical atoms embedded in an elastic fluid ether,Challis (1869) an enterprise described as an attempt at a \\"Victorian unified field theory\\". His work included a mechanical explanation of gravitation.Taylor, W. B. (1876), \\"Kinetic Theories of Gravitation\\", Smithsonian Report, 205‚Äì282 His ideas won few supporters. Theological views Challis took issue with Charles Wycliffe Goodwin's views on Genesis expressed in Essays and Reviews (1860). Challis saw Genesis as an \\"antecedent plan\\" for creation, rather than a literal chronology, and argued that the biblical account could be reconciled with the geological record.Challis (1861) He went on to interpret the word \\"law\\", as used in a spiritual sense by Saint Paul, in the sense of scientific law.Challis (1871) Assessment Challis published 225 papers in mathematics, physics and astronomy.[Anon.] (2001) He was re-elected fellow of Trinity in 1870. He died in Cambridge and was buried beside his wife in Mill Road Cemetery, Cambridge. His wealth when he died was ¬£781 (). Despite the embarrassment over Neptune, Challis did make genuine contributions to astronomy. His blend of theology and science was in the spirit of Stokes, and his search for a unified theory akin to the endeavours of Thomson and Maxwell. However, despite his tenacity in advocating his physical and theological theories, they had little impact, and in fact Richard Carrington credited him as his professor with inspiring his decision to pursue astronomy rather than become a clergyman. Olin J. Eggen claimed that \\"At a later time, or under less amiable circumstances, he would have been branded a charlatan. He would now be as forgotten as his peculiar ideas had not the events surrounding the discovery of Neptune in 1845 given him a genuine opportunity for scientific immortality. But he fumbled it.\\"Eggen (1970‚Äì1981) p.186 Honours and memorials *Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, (1836); *Fellow of the Royal Society, (1848); *Bronze medal at The Great Exhibition for his transit- reducer, (1851). *Lunar crater Challis is named after him.

The character is loosely based on comedian Kenny Kramer, Larry David's ex-neighbor across the hall. Kramer is the friend and neighbor of main character Jerry, who resides in Apartment 5B, and is friends with George and Elaine. Of the series' four central characters, only Kramer has no visible means of support; what few jobs he holds seem to be nothing more than larks, although he never seems to be short of money. A lovable rogue, his trademarks include his upright hairstyle and vintage wardrobe, whose combination led Elaine to characterize him as a \\"hipster doofus\\"; his taste in fresh fruit; love of occasional smoking, Cuban cigars in particular; bursts through Jerry's apartment door without even bothering to knock first; frequent pratfalls and penchant for nonsensical, percussive outbursts of noise to indicate skepticism, agreement, irritation and a variety of other feelings. He has been described as \\"an extraordinary cross between Eraserhead and Herman Munster\\". Kramer appeared in all but two episodes: \\"The Chinese Restaurant\\" and \\"The Pen\\", in the second and third seasons, respectively. In \\"The Seinfeld Chronicles\\", the pilot episode of Seinfeld, Kramer was originally called \\"Kessler\\" to prevent legal issues since it was based on Larry David's real- life next-door neighbor Kenny Kramer. Kenny apparently liked Seinfeld and permitted Larry David, who was the writer of Seinfeld from seasons 1‚Äì7, to use \\"Kramer\\" as Kessler's name. Beginning with The Stake Out, the character's name was changed to Kramer.https://uproxx.com/tv/10-fascinating-facts-about-the- seinfeld-pilot/ Background and family In \\"The Trip\\", Kramer admits that a man in a park exposed himself to him when he was a young boy. In \\"The Big Salad\\" Kramer reveals to Jerry that he grew up in a strict household where he had to be in bed every night by 9:00PM. In \\"The Letter\\", Kramer tells two art patrons that he ran away from home at the age of seventeen and stowed away aboard a steamer bound for Sweden. Kramer never completed high school; however, it is made clear in \\"The Barber\\" that Kramer has a GED. Kramer was estranged for a long period from his mom, Babs Kramer, who works as a restroom matron at an upscale restaurant. Unlike George and Jerry, Kramer's character does not have a well-developed network of family members shown in the sitcom. He is the only main character on the show whose dad never makes an appearance; however, in \\"The Chinese Woman\\", Kramer mentions that he is the last male member of his family, implying that his father had died. He also mentions in \\"The Lip Reader\\" that he has or had a deaf cousin, from whom he learned fluent American Sign Language, but when Kramer tries to communicate in ASL, he speaks complete gibberish and cannot correctly translate the ASL he sees others using. He also apparently has no biological children, although he adopted mile 114 of the Arthur Burkhardt Expressway in \\"The Pothole\\". During an opening discussion, Kramer reveals to Jerry that in 1979 he was struck on the head by a falling air conditioner while walking on the sidewalk. Jerry asks if that was when Kramer lived in Greenwich Village, to which Kramer replies that he cannot remember. This is discussed in the beginning of \\"The Little Kicks\\". In \\"The Strong Box\\", it is revealed that Kramer spent a brief time in the Army, although info about this time is \\"classified\\". In episode three of season one he says he lived in Los Angeles for three months. Personality Kramer has conflicting personality traits. He is sometimes shallow, callous and indifferent. Though eccentric, Kramer is generally caring, friendly and kind- hearted; he often goes out of his way to help total strangers, and tries to get his friends to also help others and to do the right thing even when they do not want to. He is confident in his own unique way of doing things, yet he can be neurotic and highly-strung. His quirkiness, strange body movements and frequent gibberish mutterings have become his trademark. Kramer was originally envisioned as a recluse who never left his apartment except to visit Jerry. This is why he is conspicuously absent from the season two episode \\"The Chinese Restaurant,\\" which takes place entirely outside of the building. However, in season three Kramer starts to join Jerry, Elaine, and George in various scenes outside of the building. As the series progresses, Kramer completely loses any hints of reclusiveness and becomes one of the most extroverted characters on the show. Kramer also gets his friends directly into trouble by talking them into unwise or even illegal actions such as parking illegally in a handicapped space (\\"The Handicap Spot\\"), urinating in a parking garage (\\"The Parking Garage\\"), committing mail fraud (\\"The Package\\") or even hiring an assassin to get rid of a dog (\\"The Engagement\\"). Kramer is also known to mooch off his friends, especially Jerry. Kramer regularly enters and uses Jerry's apartment without his consent or knowledge, and often helps himself to Jerry's food. Kramer also uses tools/appliances of Jerry's, only occasionally with permission, and often returning them in a state of disrepair. The reason for all this is because Kramer is told \\"What's mine is yours\\" on his first meeting with Jerry (\\"The Betrayal\\"). Kramer is known for his extreme honesty and, correspondingly, lack of tact; in \\"The Nose Job\\", he tells George's insecure girlfriend that she needs a nose job. In \\"The Kiss Hello\\" when Elaine tries to take advantage of this personality quirk by inviting Kramer to meet her friend, Wendy, whose hairstyle she feels is outdated, Kramer tells her he loves it. Instead of being horrified, many characters end up thanking Kramer for his candor. Kramer rarely gets into trouble for it, but his friends often do; in \\"The Cartoon\\", Kramer makes comments to Sally Weaver (Kathy Griffin), who then blames Jerry for \\"ruining her life\\" as a result. One explanation as to Kramer's personality and traits, with respect to his mysterious childhood and background, is hinted in \\"The Chicken Roaster\\". After a series of conflicts, Jerry is forced to live in Kramer's apartment and vice versa. Jerry, bothered by the many oddities and idiosyncrasies associated with Kramer's home, begins behaving like his wacky friend. Conversely, when Kramer begins living in Jerry's regular, normal apartment, he briefly becomes more like his calm, quick-witted friend. In general, Kramer excels at persuading Jerry into doing things against his better judgment. On the other hand, Kramer has displayed an almost unbending loyalty toward Jerry in many episodes, especially when choosing to help him against Newman in many episodes, including \\"The Suicide\\" and \\"The Millennium\\" (in this episode, Kramer calls Jerry \\"my buddy\\" and even keeps a photograph of them arm in arm at a previous New Year's Eve on his nightstand). In the same respect, Jerry has helped Kramer out of good will and always seems to forgive and ultimately accept Kramer's mooching tendencies. At times, Jerry is clearly quite entertained by Kramer's antics, which may also be a factor in the friendship's endurance. In \\"The Serenity Now\\", overemotional Jerry declares a near-brotherly love for Kramer, to which Kramer easily responds, \\"I love you, too, buddy.\\" His relationship with Newman is defined from the start in \\"The Suicide\\", where they get along very well. Like the main characters they also get into conflict with each other, most notably \\"The Junk Mail\\". Their get- rich-quick schemes are noted in \\"The Old Man\\" and \\"The Bottle Deposit\\". One of Kramer's best friends, Bob Sacamano, is referred to by Kramer on several occasions, yet never makes an onscreen appearance. Jerry even mentions speaking with him in \\"The Chicken Roaster\\" episode. Sacamano is used as a source for several weird anecdotes, nutty ideas, or inaccurate information. Lomez is another good friend of Kramer's who is mentioned, yet never makes an appearance. His relationship with Susan is mixed. Although they get along in \\"The Pool Guy\\", there are many episodes in which he makes her life a mess. He throws up on her in \\"The Pitch\\", unwittingly burns her dad's cabin in \\"The Bubble Boy\\", dates Mona while Susan is a lesbian in \\"The Smelly Car\\" and after calling her \\"Lily\\" in \\"The Invitations,\\" she insists that he not be an usher at her and George's upcoming wedding (she was also concerned that \\"he'd fall or something ...and ruin the whole ceremony\\"). Kramer's apartment is the subject of numerous radical experiments in interior design. Oftentimes, the \\"experiments\\" never happen due to Kramer's inherent short-attention span, including his plan to eliminate all furniture and build \\"levels... like ancient Egypt\\" in \\"The Pony Remark\\". He reconstructed the set of The Merv Griffin Show in \\"The Merv Griffin Show\\". Inside views of Kramer's apartment are seldom seen, but it's known that he installed hardwood flooring and woodgrain-like wallpaper to, as he explains to Jerry, \\"give it the feel of a ski lodge.\\" The apartment is centered around a large hot tub and couch styled after a 1957 Chevy. The apartment is decorated with many small statues of people, all made entirely out of pasta: Kramer also gives these to his friends as gifts, for example to Jerry in \\"The Fusilli Jerry\\" and Bette Midler in \\"The Understudy\\". Kramer has also experimented with his apartment entrance, including reversing his peephole \\"to prevent an ambush\\" in \\"The Reverse Peephole\\" and installing a screen door (after salvaging it from George's parents' house) in \\"The Serenity Now\\". Kramer has a liking for smoking Cuban cigars. It starts in \\"The Wallet\\" and in \\"The Abstinence\\" he sets up a smoking club in his apartment, which included a regularly-scheduled \\"pipe night\\" for those who preferred pipe tobacco to cigars and/or cigarettes. His face gets ruined after so much smoking and he hires Jackie Chiles to sue the cigarette company, but instead gets his image as the Marlboro Man on the Marlboro billboard in Times Square. At one point, he goes so far as to try to hire Cuban cigar rollers in an attempt to make his own Cuban cigars in \\"The English Patient\\", but the scheme goes awry when the \\"Cubans\\" turn out to be Dominicans. Richards's portrayal of the Kramer character closely resembles that of Stanley Spadowski, a janitor-turned-children's-TV-host he played in the 1989 comedy UHF, starring \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic. Kramer's conversation sometimes contains onomatopoeia or nonsensical sounds in order to stress an emotional point or describe earlier actions. He sometimes expresses his agreement with a sentiment or suggestion via the word \\"Giddyup!\\". He is also known to indicate pleasure with, \\"Oh, Mama!\\" Of the four main characters, Kramer has the fewest on-screen romantic relationships. He does not seem to have trouble attracting women, but his relationships often come to an embarrassing end, and, like Jerry's, are usually short lived. Kramer has on a few occasions taken people under his wing and aggressively protected their interests. Kramer is known to embrace strange philosophies unique to himself, and reject acceptable social behaviors or established facts. Development Michael Richards, who played Cosmo Kramer, in 1993. Inspiration The character of Kramer was originally based on the real-life Kenny Kramer, a neighbor of co-creator Larry David from New York. However, Michael Richards did not in any way base his performance on the real Kramer, to the point of refusing to meet him. This was later parodied in \\"The Pilot\\" when the actor that is cast to play him in Jerry and George's sitcom refuses to base the character on the real Cosmo Kramer. At the time of the shooting of the original Seinfeld pilot, \\"The Seinfeld Chronicles,\\" Kenny Kramer had not yet given consent to use his name, and so Kramer's character was originally known as \\"Kessler.\\" Larry David was hesitant to use Kenny Kramer's real name because he suspected that Kramer would take advantage of this. David's suspicion turned out to be correct; Kenny Kramer created the \\"Kramer Reality Tour\\", a New York City bus tour that points out actual locations of events or places featured in Seinfeld. The \\"Kramer Reality Tour\\" is itself spoofed on Seinfeld in \\"The Muffin Tops.\\" In the episode, when Kramer's real-life stories are used by Elaine to pad the biography of J. Peterman she was ghostwriting, he develops a reality bus tour called \\"The Peterman Reality Tour\\" and touts himself as \\"The Real J. Peterman,\\" even though, as Jerry notes, reality is the last thing Kramer is qualified to give a tour on. Richards' physicality can be seen in his early 1980s appearances on The Tonight Show, the early 1980s ABC sketch comedy show \\"Fridays\\", and his appearance in the film \\"Young Doctors in Love\\" where he plays a hit man; a nod to this appears in the \\"Air Conditioner\\" episode. Given and surnames Kramer was known only as \\"Kramer\\" during the show's first five seasons (from 1990 to 1994). In \\"The Seinfeld Chronicles\\", Jerry referred to him as \\"Kessler\\", which was his original name for the show, until it was changed to \\"Kramer\\". However, in the first draft of the script, he was named \\"Hoffman\\". In \\"The Betrayal\\", when it is shown how Jerry met Kramer, Kramer says that his name is incorrectly listed as \\"Kessler\\" in the apartment building. This retcons the pilot's use of \\"Kessler\\" as the character's name. George finds out his unusual first name of \\"Cosmo\\" through an encounter with Kramer's long estranged mom, Babs (Sheree North), in \\"The Switch\\". Despite this, most characters continued to call him Kramer for the remainder of the show's run (although many minor characters referred to him as \\"Cosmo\\"). The name \\"Cosmo\\" was suggested by Larry David; he took the name from a boy who lived in the same apartment building as him and Kenny Kramer. Additionally, the episode titled \\"The Bet\\" would have revealed Kramer's first name as \\"Conrad\\", not \\"Cosmo\\", but it was never filmed. Employment Despite the failure of the majority of his schemes and his unwillingness to even apply for a normal job, Kramer always seems to have money when he needs it. In the episode, \\"The Shoes\\", Jerry remarks that Kramer received a \\"ton of money\\" at some earlier point in his life (presumably via inheritance). In \\"The Visa\\", George makes a comment about Kramer going to a fantasy camp, and how Kramer's \\"whole life is a fantasy camp. People should plunk down two thousand dollars to live like him for a week. Do nothing, fall ass-backwards into money, mooch food off your neighbors, and have sex without dating. That's a fantasy camp.\\" As a younger man, Kramer had several jobs. In the episode \\"The Strong Box\\", Kramer says one of the things in his strongbox is his military discharge. Upon being asked, \\"You were in the Army?\\", Kramer replies, \\"Briefly,\\" and claims the reason for his discharge is classified. Also, in the episode \\"The Muffin Tops\\", Kramer mentions shaving his chest when he was a lifeguard. His long term unemployed status is partially, if nonsensically, explained in \\"The Strike\\", when he went back to work at H&H; Bagels after being on strike since 1985. His union finally settled the strike when the minimum wage of New York was raised to the hourly rate the strikers had demanded twelve years earlier (Kramer still felt the strike was a success although his fellow strikers apparently all moved on years earlier). He only worked at H&H; Bagels a short time before he was fired, and, during the brief period he was re-employed there, he went on strike at least once more because he was forced to work on Festivus, a holiday only celebrated by Frank Costanza. Along with his stint at H&H; Bagels, Kramer is engaged in a variety of short-lived jobs. In the episode The Bizarro Jerry Kramer accidentally begins working for a company called Brandt-Leland. He is fired later in the episode because he has \\"no business training at all\\". He is a compulsive gambler who successfully avoids gambling for several years until \\"The Diplomat's Club\\", in which he bets with a wealthy Texan on the arrival and departure times of flights going into New York's LaGuardia Airport. A struggling (and terrible) actor, Kramer's first gig was a one-line part in a Woody Allen movie in \\"The Alternate Side\\" (his line, \\"These pretzels are making me thirsty\\", becomes the show's first catchphrase). Although he is fired before completing his scene, he says he \\"caught the bug\\" because of it, and briefly moves to Los Angeles to pursue a career in Hollywood. After returning to New York, Kramer auditions for the role of \\"Kramer\\" in the pilot of a new sitcom called Jerry, using his stage name of Martin van Nostrand (\\"The Pilot\\"). He is unable to complete the audition due to an intestinal problem. Kramer later works as a stand-in on a soap opera with his friend Mickey Abbott in \\"The Stand In\\" and various other low-paying or non-paying theater projects, such as acting out illnesses at a medical school in \\"The Burning\\". Inventions, entrepreneurship, and lawsuits Kramer shows an entrepreneurial bent with \\"Kramerica Industries,\\" for which he devises plans for a pizza place where customers make their own pie (\\"Male Unbonding\\"), a bladder system for tankers that will \\"put an end to maritime oil spills\\" (\\"The Voice\\"), and a product that will put ketchup and mustard in the same bottle. In \\"The Friar's Club\\", he creates a concept restaurant that only serves peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, which he calls P.B. & Js. He also comes up with the idea of a beach-scented cologne in \\"The Pez Dispenser\\", but a marketing executive for Calvin Klein tells him the idea is ridiculous. Despite this, it is revealed in the episode The Pick that Calvin Klein began making an ocean-scented cologne. Instead of suing, Calvin Klein offer to allow Kramer to be an underwear model, which Kramer accepts. In \\"The Doorman\\", Kramer and Frank Costanza co-develop a prototype for a bra for men called the \\"bro\\" or the \\"manssiere\\". In \\"The Muffin Tops\\", Kramer cries foul after failing to receive due credit for J. Peterman's book success which is based on Kramer's misadventures. He then confronts Peterman during a book signing and is kicked out of the event. Kramer then declares himself \\"The Real Peterman\\" and initiates The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour, charging customers $37.50 for a tour of his life. Kramer also hatches a scheme to smuggle Cubans to the United States to make Cuban cigars, only to learn the \\"Cubans\\" are actually Dominicans (\\"The English Patient\\"). He participates in lawsuits against various people and companies and considers himself \\"very litigious\\". He is always represented in these lawsuits by Jackie Chiles, a parody of Johnnie Cochran. In \\"The Maestro,\\" he settles one such suit (though receiving no monetary compensation) against a coffee company whose beverages are too hot (a reference to the McDonald's coffee case). In \\"The Abstinence,\\" Kramer sues a tobacco company for the damage its products cause to his appearance, and in \\"The Caddy,\\" he sues Sue Ellen Mischke for causing a traffic accident that ruins his chances of becoming a professional golfer. Coffee table book about coffee tables A storyline running throughout the fifth season is the development of one of Kramer's few successful ideas. Kramer first thinks of the book in \\"The Cigar Store Indian\\", although he later claims that he first had the idea when skiing. Throughout the season, his quest to get the book published becomes a running gag. Although Elaine is shown as disliking the idea, Mr. Lippman, her boss, likes it, which surprises her. Pendant Publishing (where Elaine and Kramer's then-girlfriend work) decides to publish it in \\"The Fire\\". In \\"The Opposite\\", Kramer starts his \\"book tour\\" with an appearance on Regis and Kathie Lee. By accidentally spitting his coffee over Kathie Lee Gifford (\\"All over my Kathie Lee Casuals!\\"), his book tour immediately goes down in flames. Also in the episode, as a result of a bizarre chain of events, Elaine inadvertently causes the end of Pendant Publishing and therefore the end of Kramer's book. Nevertheless, the book is mentioned later in the episode \\"The Wizard\\" where it is revealed that the book is being made into a movie and the money Kramer makes allows him to briefly retire to Florida and run for president of the condo board at Del Boca Vista, Phase 3. The book itself is full of pictures of celebrities' coffee tables, and even had a pair of foldable wooden legs so that it could itself be turned into a coffee table. He also says that he has plans for a coaster to be built into the cover. Tom Gammill and Max Pross, writers of \\"The Cigar Store Indian\\", came up with the idea of the coffee table book about coffee tables, and Larry David added on the idea of the foldout legs to turn it into a coffee table. Physical moments Kramer's physical eccentricities are a frequent source of humor. His entrance is a recurring gag. He frequently 'slides' into Jerry's apartment, often resulting in applause, as in \\"The Virgin\\". In \\"The Revenge\\", Kramer clumsily carries a dry sack of cement powder to the washing machine. In \\"The Foundation\\", he takes on a group of kids at a karate school, and in \\"The Van Buren Boys\\", after giving his stories to Elaine to write, he slips up on the golf balls and lands on the floor. Pseudonyms Like the other three characters, Kramer has pseudonyms he uses in various schemes. Under the name H.E. Pennypacker in \\"The Puerto Rican Day\\", Kramer poses as a prospective buyer interested in an elegant apartment in order to use its bathroom. Kramer also appears as Pennypacker to help Elaine get revenge on a Mayan clothing store, \\"Putumayo\\", by repricing all the merchandise in the store with a pricing gun in \\"The Millennium\\", though due to a mishap with the pricing gun, Pennypacker was forced to instead remove the desiccants from clothes in the store in order to render them \\"noticeably musty in five years\\". In this latter capacity, he claims Pennypacker is \\"a wealthy American industrialist.\\" As Dr. Martin van Nostrand, Kramer tries to get hold of Elaine's medical chart to erase the negative comments her doctor has made in \\"The Package\\". He also uses the Van Nostrand alias in the episode \\"The Slicer\\", posing as a \\"Juilliard- trained dermatologist\\" for a cancer screening at George's company, Kruger Industrial Smoothing. Mr. Kruger later recognizes him as Dr. Van Nostrand in \\"The Strike\\". Kramer uses the name Martin van Nostrand (without the \\"doctor\\" prefix) while auditioning for the role of himself on the show Jerry in \\"The Pilot, Part 1\\". Kramer poses as Professor Peter van Nostrand in \\"The Nose Job\\" in order to retrieve a favorite jacket from another man's apartment; Kramer's jacket, to which he attributes at least some of his amorous success, is a minor plot point in other episodes until, in \\"The Cheever Letters\\", he trades it to a Cuban embassy official for several boxes of authentic Cuban cigars. Kramer is also occasionally called \\"the K-Man\\" (\\"The Barber\\", \\"The Bizarro Jerry\\", \\"The Busboy\\", \\"The Note\\", \\"The Hamptons\\", \\"The Scofflaw\\" and \\"The Soup Nazi\\"). A derogatory designation for Kramer has been \\"hipster doofus\\", a moniker assigned to him by a woman in a wheelchair he once dated in the episode \\"The Handicap Spot\\", and occasionally directed at him by Elaine, as in \\"The Glasses\\". The nickname was first used in The Atlantic Monthly review of Seinfeld. Reception Ken Tucker wrote in a 1992 review in Entertainment Weekly that Kramer is \\"the most cartoonish, least-defined person in Seinfeld. Kramer is an earnest dope whose long, gangly body always seems to surprise his mind ‚Äî he‚Äôs always running, stumbling, bumping into things; he doesn‚Äôt enter Jerry‚Äôs apartment so much as he explodes into it.\\" In 1999, TV Guide ranked him number 36 on its '50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time' list. In popular culture The band Kramer's Place made reference to the character Kramer. It is shown that Kramer is subletting his apartment from Paul Buchman, one of the main characters in NBC's Mad About You. Paul and Kramer have a conversation about Paul giving Kramer the apartment in Mad About You episode \\"The Apartment\\" (Season 1, Episode 8). Pop-Punk band Ledger make reference to Kramer in the title of the song \\"Some Days You're Kramer, Some Days You're Costanza.\\" Alternative hip hop group Das Racist indirectly reference Kramer by referring to the show Seinfeld and the actor Michael Richards who portrays him in the song \\"Rapping 2 U.\\" CitationsExternal links *Kramer's Best Lines Category:Fictional actors Category:Fictional bakers Category:Fictional characters based on real people Category:Television characters introduced in 1989 Category:Fictional gamblers Category:Fictional golfers Category:Fictional inventors Category:Fictional smokers Category:Fictional unemployed people Category:Seinfeld characters Category:American male characters in television ","title":"Cosmo Kramer"},{"id":"457824","text":"Unigov is the colloquial name adopted by the city of Indianapolis, Indiana, to describe its consolidated city‚Äìcounty government. By an act of the Indiana General Assembly, Indianapolis consolidated with the government of Marion County in 1970. Within Unigov are eleven \\"included towns\\". Under Indiana Code 36-3-1-4 sec. 4(a)(2)), included towns retain their identity as towns under Indiana law and have some limited autonomy. However, they are legally part of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis and are fully subject to the laws and control of the government of Indianapolis. Four other municipalities in Marion County are not part of the Indianapolis government (\\"excluded cities and towns\\"), but receive county-level services from Unigov and take part in elections for the Indianapolis City‚ÄìCounty Council and mayor. The area of Marion County not within the included or excluded towns, but including what was the City of Indianapolis prior to the enactment of Unigov, is designated by the U.S. Census Bureau as the Indianapolis (balance), and its population is usually quoted as the population of Indianapolis for census purposes. Background Indianapolis was intentionally surveyed and founded as the capital of the U.S. state of Indiana. Given the state of urban planning in 1821, little thought was given to the growth of the city. Original planners were of the opinion that it would never grow beyond its original square mile (2.6 km¬≤) layout (still known as \\"the Mile Square\\"). Contrary to their belief, Marion County soon was filled with small communities with connections to Indianapolis, or with businesses that had formed to take advantage of Indianapolis's location midway between Lake Michigan and both Cincinnati, Ohio, and Louisville, Kentucky. City growth occurred in fits and starts. By the late 1960s, it was possible in some areas to leave and re-enter Indianapolis while traveling in a straight line. The movement of affluent citizens to more fashionable suburbs, especially to the north of the city limits, accelerated into full white flight in the period after World War II. While this sprawl was generally within Marion County, it hastened the decay of the city itself. Unigov was proposed in the late 1960s by then mayor (and later Senator) Richard Lugar to address these problems and a number of other related issues. In order to support Unigov, a compromise was arranged; the cities of Beech Grove, Lawrence, and Southport, and the town of Speedway each maintained limited autonomy, with their own police forces, school systems, and mayors (except Speedway); in addition, fire service and school districts were maintained at their pre-Unigov borders, and some of the included towns retained independent police forces. Nevertheless, the excluded cities are also part of the consolidated city-county government and are thus represented within the City-County Council. In addition to voting for the mayors and councils of their respective cities and towns, residents are also able to vote for the mayor of Indianapolis, and a district City-County Council member, and, until those positions were abolished by the General Assembly, four at-large council members. A number of services and governmental responsibilities, including road maintenance, natural resource management, zoning, and flood control, are delegated by the state of Indiana to county-level government; As a result, residents of the excluded cities are obligated to pay county-wide taxes, and the powers of the mayor of Indianapolis extend to all of Marion County. Included towns Clermont is located on Indianapolis's northwest side. It is an example of an included town. Several towns that existed outside the city limits were incorporated into Unigov, but elected to retain some measure of autonomy. Most of these towns hold elections for Town Council and Clerk-Treasurer. The town governments have taxing authority, and several continue to appoint their own police departments, maintain their own streets, and perform various other functions independently of the city of Indianapolis. However, they cannot pass any ordinance that conflicts with, or permits a lesser standard than, any City-County ordinance. The included towns are: * Clermont * Crows Nest * Homecroft * Meridian Hills * North Crows Nest * Rocky Ripple * Spring Hill * Warren Park * Williams Creek * Wynnedale Note that Cumberland is divided between Marion County and Hancock County. While Cumberland has full governmental autonomy on the Hancock County side of town, it is an included town under Unigov on the Marion County side. For purposes such as rezoning in the portion in Marion County, Indianapolis officials have final say over policy. Excluded cities and town Speedway, an enclave of Indianapolis, is an example of an excluded city. The cities of Beech Grove, Lawrence, and Southport, and the town of Speedway are known as \\"excluded cities,\\" and retain government autonomy in most respects. They elect their own city officials and city councils. They also are represented on the City-County Council and vote for the Mayor of Indianapolis, since these countywide officials have taxing and other powers over the whole county. Political implications For many years, the incorporation of the city's suburbs was seen as working to the political benefit of the Republican Party, which held the mayor's office from the election of Richard Lugar in 1967 until the election of Democrat Bart Peterson in 1999. Democrats gained a one-seat majority on the City-County Council for the first time in citywide elections in 2003. Facing a budget crisis, Peterson made a proposal to further consolidate city and county functions, dubbed \\"Indianapolis Works!\\". He claimed it would eliminate remaining duplication, while opponents saw it as an effort to further consolidate the power of the Democratic Party in Marion County. The extension of city government was now seen as benefiting the Democrats, who had made many gains (as they did nationally) in the inner-ring suburbs, many more of which are included within the boundaries of the city than in many comparable metropolitan areas. In December 2005, the City-County Council approved a merger of the Indianapolis Police Department and the Marion County Sheriff's Department, creating the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, headed by the Marion County Sheriff. In the 2007 municipal elections, the Republican party, led by Gregory A. Ballard, recaptured the Mayor's office and also won back a majority of the City-County Council. One of the planks of Ballard's campaign platform was that the police department needed to be under the responsibility of the Mayor, and not the Sheriff. In February 2008, the new GOP-led council gave the authority over the county-wide Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department to the Mayor, leaving Sheriff Frank J. Anderson with authority over the county jail, protection of City- County buildings and the traditional roles of tax collection and paper serving, but left him as the only Sheriff in Indiana without territory to protect. Democrats won all four citywide Council seats for the first time in the 2011 election (and a majority for the second time), prompting Republicans in the Indiana General Assembly to eliminate the at-large seats for the 2015 election. Other city‚Äìcounty consolidations Under the Unigov provision of Indiana Law, city-county consolidation is automatic when a city's population exceeds the threshold for qualification as a so-called First Class City. When the Unigov provision was enacted, the First Class City population threshold was 250,000. Indianapolis had a population of over 500,000 people in 1970, more than double the threshold. The next most populous city was Fort Wayne with a population of 174,000; so Indianapolis was the only city affected by the legislation. By 2006, Fort Wayne nearly met the threshold for designation as a First Class City as it annexed the populous portions of Aboite Township. However, a pre-emptive legislative change in 2004 raised the population requirements for a First Class City from 250,000 to 600,000, which ensured Indianapolis's status as the only First Class City in Indiana. As a result, any foreseeable city-county consolidation in Indiana will be voluntary rather than automatic.

Design and development The DFS 194 was based on the Alexander Lippisch Delta series of tailless designs. As originally conceived, it would have been a tailless aircraft similar to his DFS 40, powered by a conventional piston engine driving a pusher propeller. The airframe was completed in this configuration in March 1938. Lippisch's designs had attracted the attention of the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM - Reich Aviation Ministry) who believed that tailless aircraft were the best basis for a rocket-powered fighter. On January 2, 1939, Lippisch and his team were transferred to the Messerschmitt company to begin work on such an aircraft, under what was known as Project X. The DFS-194 was modified to accept a Walter R I-203 rocket engine designed by Hellmuth Walter, and by October, the aircraft was undergoing engine tests at Peenem√ºnde. These were followed by glide tests in early 1940 leading to the first powered flight in August with Heini Dittmar at the controls. The flight went well, the DFS 194 reaching , bettering the speed of the earlier (20 July 1939), Walter rocket powered Heinkel He 176. The aircraft proved to have excellent flying characteristics and proved safe to fly at nearly twice the anticipated speed. These results paved the way for the next stage of the project, which now received priority status from the RLM. The Messerschmitt Me 163, a considerably refined design along the same basic lines, flew the following year.

It is a close relative of the jabuticaba (Myrciaria cauliflora) and the guavaberry or rumberry (Myrciaria floribunda). As much as 2-3% of the fresh fruit by weight is vitamin C. Description Camu camu has small flowers with waxy white petals and a sweet-smelling aroma. It has bushy, feathery foliage. The evergreen, opposite leaves are lanceolate to elliptic. Individual leaves are m in length and wide. Native range The current range of camu camu consists of the Amazonian lowlands of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil. Its distribution extends from the center of Par√° state, Brazil, along the mid and upper Amazon River to the eastern part of Peru; in the north, it appears in the Casiquiare and the upper and middle Orinoco River. In Brazil, it is found in Rond√¥nia along the Ma√ßangana and Urupa Rivers and in Amazonas, in the municipalities of Manaus and Manacapuru and along the Javar√≠, Madeira, and Negro Rivers. Harvest  Long used by native peoples, wild camu camu fruit is harvested directly into canoes. The fruit has only recently come into large-scale cultivation and sale to the world market, with Japan being the major buyer. The tree is relatively easy to cultivate within certain growing conditions. It survives best in hot, damp, tropical climates, but will grow in the subtropics, surviving temperatures down to just above freezing. It requires copious water. Fair trade is present in low-land production from the Association of Camu Camu Producers of the Peruvian Amazon. The tree occurs in locally dense populations or even monospecific stands in Amazonian flood plains and riparian vegetation. The plant is extremely tolerant of flooding, withstanding four to five months with the roots and even much of the aerial parts submerged in water. The species propagates through seeds. In cultivation, the tree begins bearing fruits after attaining in stem girth (three years after emergence of the seedling). Plants flower at the end of the dry season and produce fruit at the peak of the rainy season. Observations with both wild and cultivated plants suggest that the trees can remain productive for several decades. Wild trees have been found to yield of fruit on average. At suggested planting densities of 600‚Äì1100 trees per , about fruit may be derived in cultivation from one hectare. It is thought that much higher yields could be achieved using improved horticultural techniques, such as the use of clonal elite material, pruning, and fertilization.

Camu camu has an extraordinarily high vitamin C content (on the order of 2‚Äì3% of fresh weight,Peruvian Camu Camu fruit conquers Japan Percy Takayama, Living in Peru - Business, 12 February 2007. Accessed July 2012. second only to the Australian native Terminalia ferdinandiana), and this property of the fruit has been exploited in positioning it on international markets. Vitamin C content declines as full maturity is reached, with a trade-off between vitamin C and flavor expression. The fruit is rich in flavonoids, such as anthocyanins, flavonols, flavanols, catechins, delphinidin 3-glucoside, cyanidin 3-glucoside, ellagic acid, and rutin. Other analysis revealed the presence of gallic and ellagic acids, suggesting that the fruit possesses hydrolyzed tannins (gallo- and/or ellagitannins).Antioxidant compounds and antioxidant capacity of Peruvian camu camu (Myrciaria dubia (H.B.K.)

Rosana Chirinos, Jorge Galarza, Indira Betalleluz-Pallardel, Romina Pedreschi and David Campos, Food Chemistry, Volume 120, Issue 4, 15 June 2010, Pages 1019‚Äì1024, Uses Documentation of traditional camu camu uses is scarce. In traditional Amazonian societies, camu camu is not likely to have ever been nutritionally relevant except for its vitamin C content. The fruit is extremely acidic and the flavor much like a sour grape with a large pit. The fruit is often used to make a very pink juice with a little sugar (like lemonade). A reddish pigment in the leathery skin of the fruit imparts a pink color on juices extracted from camu camu. The aroma is subtle, but is not so captivating as in more popular fruits. Recently, camu camu is used in ice creams and sweets and processed powder from the fruit pulp is beginning to be sold in the west as a health food in loose powder or capsule form.

Fulke Greville, 1st Baron Brooke and 5th Baron Willoughby de Broke Baron Willoughby de Broke is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created by writ in 1491 for Sir Robert Willoughby, of the manor of Broke, part of Westbury, Wiltshire, who according to modern doctrine was de jure 9th Baron Latimer. On the death of his son, the two baronies (the recognised barony of Willoughby de Broke and the de jure barony of Latimer) fell into abeyance. Around 1535, the abeyance was naturally terminated when the second Baron's granddaughter Elizabeth, who had married Sir Fulke Greville, became the only surviving co-heir, passing her claim to her son Sir Fulke Greville, father of the poet of the same name. The title stayed in the Greville family until after the death of the 5th Baron, when it passed to his sister, Margaret Greville, the wife of a Verney. Thereafter it remained in the Verney family.

Traditional medicine (also known as indigenous or folk medicine) comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines traditional medicine as \\"the sum total of the knowledge, skills, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness\\". Traditional medicine is contrasted with scientific medicine. In some Asian and African countries, up to 80% of the population relies on traditional medicine for their primary health care needs. When adopted outside its traditional culture, traditional medicine is often considered a form of alternative medicine. Practices known as traditional medicines include traditional European medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, traditional indigenous Mayongia magic and medicine(Assam), traditional indigenous medicine of Assam and rest of NE India, traditional Korean medicine, traditional African medicine, Ayurveda, Siddha medicine, Unani, ancient Iranian Medicine, Iranian (Persian), Islamic medicine, Muti, and If√°. Scientific disciplines which study traditional medicine include herbalism, ethnomedicine, ethnobotany, and medical anthropology. The WHO notes, however, that \\"inappropriate use of traditional medicines or practices can have negative or dangerous effects\\" and that \\"further research is needed to ascertain the efficacy and safety\\" of such practices and medicinal plants used by traditional medicine systems. Ultimately, the WHO has implemented a nine-year strategy to \\"support Member States in developing proactive policies and implementing action plans that will strengthen the role traditional medicine plays in keeping populations healthy.\\" Usage and history= Classical history  In the written record, the study of herbs dates back 5,000 years to the ancient Sumerians, who described well-established medicinal uses for plants. In Ancient Egyptian medicine, the Ebers papyrus from c. 1552 BC records a list of folk remedies and magical medical practices. The Old Testament also mentions herb use and cultivation in regards to Kashrut. Many herbs and minerals used in Ayurveda were described by ancient Indian herbalists such as Charaka and Sushruta during the 1st millennium BC. The first Chinese herbal book was the Shennong Bencao Jing, compiled during the Han Dynasty but dating back to a much earlier date, which was later augmented as the Yaoxing Lun (Treatise on the Nature of Medicinal Herbs) during the Tang Dynasty. Early recognised Greek compilers of existing and current herbal knowledge include Pythagoras and his followers, Hippocrates, Aristotle, Theophrastus, Dioscorides and Galen. Roman sources included Pliny the Elder's Natural History and Celsus's De Medicina. Pedanius Dioscorides drew on and corrected earlier authors for his De Materia Medica, adding much new material; the work was translated into several languages, and Turkish, Arabic and Hebrew names were added to it over the centuries. Latin manuscripts of De Materia Medica were combined with a Latin herbal by Apuleius Platonicus (Herbarium Apuleii Platonici) and were incorporated into the Anglo- Saxon codex Cotton Vitellius C.III. These early Greek and Roman compilations became the backbone of European medical theory and were translated by the Persian Avicenna (Ibn Sƒ´nƒÅ, 980-1037), the Persian Rhazes (RƒÅzi, 865-925) and the Jewish Maimonides. Some fossils have been used in traditional medicine since antiquity. Medieval and later Arabic indigenous medicine developed from the conflict between the magic-based medicine of the Bedouins and the Arabic translations of the Hellenic and Ayurvedic medical traditions. Spanish indigenous medicine was influenced by the Arabs from 711 to 1492. Islamic physicians and Muslim botanists such as al-Dinawari and Ibn al-BaitarDiane Boulanger (2002), \\"The Islamic Contribution to Science, Mathematics and Technology\\", OISE Papers, in STSE Education, Vol. 3. significantly expanded on the earlier knowledge of materia medica. The most famous Persian medical treatise was Avicenna's The Canon of Medicine, which was an early pharmacopoeia and introduced clinical trials. The Canon was translated into Latin in the 12th century and remained a medical authority in Europe until the 17th century. The Unani system of traditional medicine is also based on the Canon. Translations of the early Roman-Greek compilations were made into German by Hieronymus Bock whose herbal, published in 1546, was called Kreuter Buch. The book was translated into Dutch as Pemptades by Rembert Dodoens (1517-1585), and from Dutch into English by Carolus Clusius, (1526-1609), published by Henry Lyte in 1578 as A Nievve Herball. This became John Gerard's (1545-1612) Herball or General Historie of Plantes. Each new work was a compilation of existing texts with new additions. Women's folk knowledge existed in undocumented parallel with these texts. Forty-four drugs, diluents, flavouring agents and emollients mentioned by Dioscorides are still listed in the official pharmacopoeias of Europe. The Puritans took Gerard's work to the United States where it influenced American Indigenous medicine. Francisco Hern√°ndez, physician to Philip II of Spain spent the years 1571‚Äì1577 gathering information in Mexico and then wrote Rerum Medicarum Novae Hispaniae Thesaurus, many versions of which have been published including one by Francisco Xim√©nez. Both Hernandez and Ximenez fitted Aztec ethnomedicinal information into the European concepts of disease such as \\"warm\\", \\"cold\\", and \\"moist\\", but it is not clear that the Aztecs used these categories. Juan de Esteyneffer's Florilegio medicinal de todas las enfermedas compiled European texts and added 35 Mexican plants. Mart√≠n de la Cruz wrote an herbal in Nahuatl which was translated into Latin by Juan Badiano as Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis or Codex Barberini, Latin 241 and given to King Carlos V of Spain in 1552. It was apparently written in haste and influenced by the European occupation of the previous 30 years. Fray Bernardino de Sahag√∫n's used ethnographic methods to compile his codices that then became the Historia General de las Cosas de Nueva Espa√±a, published in 1793. Castore Durante published his Herbario Nuovo in 1585 describing medicinal plants from Europe and the East and West Indies. It was translated into German in 1609 and Italian editions were published for the next century. Colonial America In 17th and 18th-century America, traditional folk healers, frequently women, used herbal remedies, cupping and leeching.Rosalyn Fraad Baxandall, Linda Gordon, Susan Reverb, America's Working Women: A Documentary History, 1600 to the Present, W.

Some modern medicine is based on plant phytochemicals that had been used in folk medicine.Gilani, A.H., (2005) Role of Medicinal Plants in Modern Medicine. Malaysian Journal of Science, 24 (1). pp. 1-5.\\" Researchers state that many of the alternative treatments are \\"statistically indistinguishable from placebo treatments\\".The Economist, \\"Alternative Medicine: Think yourself better\\", 21 May 2011, pp. 83‚Äì84.  Knowledge transmission and creation  Indigenous medicine is generally transmitted orally through a community, family and individuals until \\"collected\\". Within a given culture, elements of indigenous medicine knowledge may be diffusely known by many, or may be gathered and applied by those in a specific role of healer such as a shaman or midwife. Three factors legitimize the role of the healer - their own beliefs, the success of their actions and the beliefs of the community. When the claims of indigenous medicine become rejected by a culture, generally three types of adherents still use it - those born and socialized in it who become permanent believers, temporary believers who turn to it in crisis times, and those who only believe in specific aspects, not in all of it.  Definition and terminology  Traditional medicine may sometimes be considered as distinct from folk medicine, and the considered to include formalized aspects of folk medicine. Under this definition folk medicine are longstanding remedies passed on and practiced by lay people. Folk medicine consists of the healing practices and ideas of body physiology and health preservation known to some in a culture, transmitted informally as general knowledge, and practiced or applied by anyone in the culture having prior experience.Acharya, Deepak and Shrivastava Anshu (2008): Indigenous Herbal Medicines: Tribal Formulations and Traditional Herbal Practices, Aavishkar Publishers Distributor, Jaipur- India. . pp 440.  Folk medicine  Curandera performing a limpieza in Cuenca, Ecuador Many countries have practices described as folk medicine which may coexist with formalized, science-based, and institutionalized systems of medical practice represented by conventional medicine. Examples of folk medicine traditions are traditional Chinese medicine, traditional Korean medicine, Arabic indigenous medicine, Uyghur traditional medicine, Japanese Kamp≈ç medicine, traditional Aboriginal bush medicine, and Georgian folk medicine, among others. =Australian bush medicine= Generally, bush medicine used by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia is made from plant materials, such as bark, leaves and seeds, although animal products may be used as well. A major component of traditional medicine is herbal medicine, which is the use of natural plant substances to treat or prevent illness. = Native American medicine = American Native and Alaska Native medicine are traditional forms of healing that have been around for thousands of years. Home remedies A home remedy (sometimes also referred to as a granny cure) is a treatment to cure a disease or ailment that employs certain spices, herbs, vegetables, or other common items. Home remedies may or may not have medicinal properties that treat or cure the disease or ailment in question, as they are typically passed along by laypersons (which has been facilitated in recent years by the Internet). Many are merely used as a result of tradition or habit or because they are effective in inducing the placebo effect. One of the more popular examples of a home remedy is the use of chicken soup to treat respiratory infections such as a cold or mild flu. Other examples of home remedies include duct tape to help with setting broken bones; and duct tape or superglue to treat plantar warts; and Kogel mogel to treat sore throat. In earlier times, mothers were entrusted with all but serious remedies. Historic cookbooks are frequently full of remedies for dyspepsia, fevers, and female complaints.Catherine Esther Beecher Mrs. Beecher's Housekeeper and Healthkeeper 1874. Retrieved on 2007-11-05. Components of the aloe vera plant are used to treat skin disorders. Many European liqueurs or digestifs were originally sold as medicinal remedies. In Chinese folk medicine, medicinal congees (long-cooked rice soups with herbs), foods, and soups are part of treatment practices.Prince Wen Hui's Cook Bob Flaws and Honora Wolf 1985 Criticism=Safety concerns Although 130 countries have regulations on folk medicines, there are risks associated with the use of them (i.e. zoonosis, mainly as some traditional medicines still use animal-based substancesAfrica‚Äôs growing risk of diseases that spread from animals to peopleUse of animal products in traditional Chinese medicine: environmental impact and health hazards). It is often assumed that because supposed medicines are natural that they are safe, but numerous precautions are associated with using herbal remedies. Use of endangered species Sometimes traditional medicines include parts of endangered species, such as the slow loris in Southeast Asia. Endangered animals, such as the slow loris, are sometimes killed to make traditional medicines. Shark fins have also been used in traditional medicine, and although their effectiveness has not been proven, it is hurting shark populations and their ecosystem. The illegal ivory trade can partially be traced back to buyers of traditional Chinese medicine. Demand for ivory is a huge factor in the poaching of endangered species such as rhinos and elephants.

It is normally abbreviated with the dollar sign $, or alternatively BZ$ to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies. It is divided into 100 cents. The official value is pegged at 2 BZ$ = 1 US$. History The first dollars to circulate in British Honduras were Spanish dollars, some of which were counterstamped with the monogram of a crowned ‚ÄìG-R‚Äì (Latin: Georgius Rex, King George.) They circulated between 1765 and 1825 at a value of 6 shillings 8 pence. i.e. one third of a pound sterling. In 1825, an imperial order-in-council was passed for the purpose of introducing the British sterling coinage into all the British colonies. This order-in-council made sterling coinage legal tender; it set the exchange rate between sterling and the Spanish dollar at $1 = 4s 4d. This exchange rate was supposed to be based on the value of the silver in the Spanish dollars as compared to the value of the gold in the British sovereigns. The realistic exchange rate would have been $4.80 = ¬£1 (equivalent to $1 = 4s 2d), and so the unrealistic exchange rate that was contained in the 1825 order-in-council led to the initiative being largely a failure. Remedial legislation came about in 1838 with a new order-in-council, which did not apply to the British North American colonies due to minor rebellions in Upper and Lower Canada. The 1838 legislation introduced the correct rating of $1 = 4s 2d. When the original order-in-council of 1825 was introduced in Jamaica, Bermuda, and British Honduras, the local authorities set aside the mistaken rating of $1 = 4s 4d, and they unofficially used the alternative rating of $1 = 4s. The Bahamas would later adopt this same approach. When the 1838 remedial legislation came into force, sterling was well established in these territories, the Spanish dollar had been barred from circulation, and the authorities had no desire to adopt the devaluation that would have been associated with the correct rating of $1 = 4s 2d. The British shilling, referred to locally as a 'Maccaroni', was equal to one quarter of a dollar, and the system was working very satisfactorily. For a period in the middle of the nineteenth century British Honduras operated the British sterling monetary system just like Jamaica and Bermuda. In the wake of the international silver crisis of 1873 the silver peso of neighbouring Guatemala drove the British currency out of circulation. In an attempt to return British Honduras to the gold standard, and influenced by the fact that most imports were coming from New Orleans in the United States, a new currency was introduced into British Honduras based on the US dollar, bringing British Honduras into line with Canada. At that time, the Canadian dollar was on the gold standard, and one Canadian dollar was equal to one American dollar. This is the point where the currency history of British Honduras diverges from that of the rest of the British West Indies. In 1885, 1 cent coins were issued, followed by higher denominations in 1894. This year also saw the first issue of banknotes by the government and a switch from the silver Guatemalan peso to the gold U.S. dollar as the base for the currency, with $4.866 = 1 pound. The rate of $4.866 as opposed to $4.80 is explained by the fact that when the US dollar was first created in 1792, it was based on the average weight of a selection of worn Spanish dollars. Hence, the US dollar was at a slight discount in relation to the Spanish dollar. Following the introduction of the US dollar gold standard to British Honduras, the 25 cent coins were referred to as shillings due to their closeness in value to shilling sterling. When the United Kingdom abandoned the gold standard in 1931 the British Honduras dollar continued with its attachment to the US dollar and as such it did not become part of the sterling bloc. At the outbreak of the second world war, unlike in the case of Canada, Newfoundland, and Hong Kong, British Honduras did join the sterling area even though it maintained its fixed exchange rate with respect to the US dollar. The sterling bloc should not be confused with the sterling area. The former was a group of countries who pegged their local currencies to sterling when the United Kingdom abandoned the gold standard in 1931, whereas the latter was an exchange control arrangement introduced as an emergency measure at the outbreak of the second world war. In 1949 the British pound was devalued from US$4.03 to US$2.80. Since the British Honduras dollar was pegged to the US dollar, this caused a sudden increase in the value of the British Honduran dollar relative to the pound. Protests ensued which led to a devaluation of the British Honduran dollar to a value of 70 U.S. cents (equal to 5 shillings sterling). Following Harold Wilson's devaluation of sterling in November 1967, the British Honduran dollar again devalued in sympathy with the British pound to 60 US cents. In 1978, the link to the British pound of BZ$4 = ¬£1 was abandoned and once again the Belize unit was pegged to the US dollar at a fixed rate of BZ$2 = US$1. This new rate which still continues today, reflects the devaluation of 50% in relation to the original parity with the US dollar in 1885, which last applied in 1949.  Coins  The coins of Belize In 1885, bronze 1 cent coins were introduced, followed by silver 5, 10, 25 and 50 cents in 1894. These coins were minted at the Royal Mint and their style was similar to that of other British colonial dollar fractional coinage used in Hong Kong and Canada. Cupronickel replaced silver in the 5 cents in 1907. This was itself replaced by nickel-brass in 1942. In 1952, cupro-nickel replaced silver in the 25 cent coins, with the same happening for the 50 and 10 cents in 1954 and 1956, respectively. Following a reduction in size in 1954, the 1 cent coin switched to a scalloped shape in 1956. In 1976, aluminium 1 and 5 cent coins were introduced. A nickel-brass, decagonal 1 dollar coin was introduced in 1990.  Banknotes  The Board of Commissioners of Currency operated from 1894 to 1976. In 1894, the government introduced notes in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 50 and 100 dollars. Production of 50 and 100 dollars ceased after 1928. 20 dollar notes were introduced in 1952. British Honduras was officially renamed Belize in 1973, and the following year a new family of notes was introduced with the new country name. On November 1, 1976, the Monetary Authority of Belize was established, and took over note issuance. The first and only notes issued under its name were dated 1ST JUNE 1980, and included a 100-dollar note for the first time. The Central Bank of Belize was established on January 1, 1982 by the Central Bank of Belize Act No. 15 (Chapter 262 of the Laws of Belize Revised Edition 2000). The first notes issued under its name were dated 1ST JULY 1983. Production of 50 dollar notes recommenced in 1990, the same year that the 1 dollar note was issued for the last time, and then replaced by a coin. On April 30, 2012, the Central Bank of Belize issued a $20 commemorative note dated 01.01.12 (January 1, 2012) to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Central Bank.

Baron Wharton is a title in the Peerage of England, originally granted by letters patent to the heirs male of the 1st Baron, which was forfeited in 1729 when the last male-line heir was declared an outlaw. The Barony was erroneously revived in 1916 by writ of summons, thanks to an 1844 decision in the House of Lords based on absence of documentation. As such, the current Barony of Wharton could more accurately be listed as a new Barony, created in 1916, with the precedence of the older (and extinct) Barony. The barony of 1544 Philip Wharton, 1st Duke of Wharton. The title Baron Wharton was created in 1544 by letters patent for Sir Thomas Wharton, who had previously served as a Member of Parliament for Cumberland, in recognition of his victory at the Battle of Solway Moss. Because of its creation by letters patent, the Barony could only be passed down to male heirs. The 5th Baron (1648‚Äì1715) had a long and distinguished political career, serving at various times as a Member of Parliament, Lord Lieutenant of Oxford and Buckingham, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and Lord Privy Seal. He was created Earl of Wharton, in the County of Westmorland, and Viscount Winchendon, of Winchendon in the County of Buckingham, in 1706, in the Peerage of England, and in 1715 was further created Marquess of Wharton, in the County of Westmorland, and Marquess of Malmesbury, in the County of Wilts, in the Peerage of Great Britain. Later that year, he was also created Marquess of Catherlough, Earl of Rathfarnham, in the County of Dublin, and Baron Trim, in the County of Meath, in the Peerage of Ireland. (The Marquessate of Catherlough referred to the town now spelled Carlow.) His son, the 2nd Marquess (1698‚Äì1731), was created Duke of Wharton, in the County of Westmorland, in the Peerage of Great Britain, in 1718, but all the titles were forfeit in 1729 when the Duke of Wharton was declared an outlaw. In any event, since on the Duke's death there were no male heirs of the 1st Baron remaining, all the titles would have become extinct at that point. The Barony revived, or new Barony created In 1844, however, the Barony was claimed by Colonel Charles Kemeys-Tynte,The Law Times, Volume 3, Page 1 and, since the document creating the peerage had been lost, the Committee for Privileges of the House of Lords ruled erroneously that the Barony was created by writ and could therefore be passed down through the female line. As a consequence of their resolution, it was determined that at the death of the Duke of Wharton, the Barony had fallen into abeyance between the Duke's sisters, Lady Jane Holt and Lady Lucy Morice. It was further determined that, at Lady Lucy's death in 1739, Lady Jane (by now Lady Jane Coke) remained the sole heir, and had been therefore entitled to the Barony. Finally, it was determined that at her death the Barony again fell into abeyance, where it remained in the nineteenth century. The Committee for Privileges, however, also ruled that it did not have the authority to terminate the abeyance because of the existence of a judgement of outlawry against the Duke of Wharton. Thus the matter remained unresolved for 72 years. On 15 February 1916, the abeyance was terminated by a writ of summons from King George V to Parliament in favour of Charles Theodore Halswell Kemeys- Tynte, who became the 8th Baron.Dictionary of Welsh Biography - Kemeys and Kemeys-Tynte family, of Cefn Mabli, Monmouth - Charles Theodore Halswell Kemeys -Tynte, born 18 September 1876 (He should be more properly listed as the 1st Baron Wharton, of the new barony.) At his death, the title was inherited by his son and thereafter by his granddaughter Elisabeth, who became the 10th Baroness. At her death in 1974, the Barony again fell into abeyance. It was once again revived in 1990, when the abeyance was terminated in favour of Myrtle Robertson. At her death, the Barony was inherited by her son Myles.

History White Wolf had a hole in their 1997 publishing schedule, so CEO Steve Wieck went to designer Andrew Bates to fill it; the result was a new game, √ÜON (1997), which went from first conception to publication in just 10 months. √ÜON was a science- fiction game intended to create a whole new trilogy of games, and although it used a variant of the Storyteller game system, √ÜON was intended to appeal to a more action-oriented audience than the World of Darkness. √ÜON ran into troubles almost immediately due to a lawsuit from Viacom who felt that it violated the trademark of their TV show, Aeon Flux (1991-1995); the names on the first printing of √ÜON actually had to be stickered over with the game's new name, Trinity. Because of White Wolf's imprint ArtHaus' success, acclaimed-but-low-selling games were added to the imprint over the years, and Trinity came to ArtHaus in 2000. ArtHaus produced d20 Trinity books to test the waters for White Wolf's other universes, but Trinity d20 (2004) came and went in a time when the d20 market was already weakened. Description Trinity was the first installment in the Trinity Universe series of games (the two others being Aberrant and Adventure!) sharing a common background and developing an alternate history of humanity through two centuries, and allowing players to play almost all genres of science fiction - from comic- book superhero action to cutting edge technothriller, space opera, and old- fashioned pulp standards. Though it had a vocal fanbase the whole game line was discontinued due to low sales in 2001; an adaptation for the d20 system was released in 2004. Onyx Path Publishing has recently acquired the rights to the Trinity Universe and has announced its intention to release a new edition of Trinity, using the original √Üon name under the new line name Trinity Continuum.  Setting  Set in the twenty-second century, Trinity portrays a future Earth slowly recovering from a disastrous war (the origins of which are covered in Aberrant) and expanding in space. Former depressed areas such as Africa, South America and Eastern Asia, which suffered moderate traumas during the Aberrant War are now the leading political forces in the international arena, while Europe is a landscape of ruins and hard struggling survivors, and North America is under a fascist regime (the FSA, or Federated States of America). Bio-engineering is the leading technology and psionics are known and studied if not exactly widespread. Alien contact has been made, with mixed results. Characters take the roles of psionic individuals, working for one of the many organizations in the gaming world, and tackling troubles when they arise. The game setting, which is detailed in a number of supplements, allows for a variety of styles, from cyberpunk-like corporate espionage to Mad Max- style post-holocaust frontier adventure, to space exploration. Orders Players have a choice of six \\"Orders\\" for their characters to join. Each Order possesses a mastery over a specific \\"Aptitude\\", a category of psionic powers. Each Order is based in a specific geographic location, often the homeland of its founder, and is heavily influenced by local culture. Actually, there are eight \\"Orders\\" in the Trinity Universe, but one only became playable after some metaplot hooks made it so, and the other has almost been exterminated by the year where the playable timeline begins. ;The √Üsculapian Order :Based in Europe, this Order is a global medical clinic first and foremost; its members fulfill the roles of combat medics, healers and scientists. They teach the Aptitude of vitakinesis, the usage of the mind to heal the body. ;Interplanetary School for Research and Advancement :Based on the Moon, this Order is a quasi-monastic school of philosophy associated with the real religion the Bah√° º√≠ Faith (see popular media references). Its members learn clairsentience and use their sensory powers to become scouts and detectives. ;The Legions :Based in Austronesia, these are high tech military corps (similar to that found in Starship Troopers), using the powers of psychokinesis to protect humanity from extrasolar threats. ;Ministry of Psionic Affairs :(Also the Ministry of Noetic Affairs.) This cloak and dagger spy agency is based in China and a part of the Chinese government. Members are skilled in telepathy and are the most secretive and mistrusted of the Orders for their abilities. ;Nova For√ßa das Na√ß√µes (Portuguese for \\"The New Nationals Force\\") :(Also known as nor√ßa, or \\"bryony\\"). This Order takes the form of a vigilante militia, based somewhere in the jungles of South America. They wield the powers of biokinesis, and possess complete biological mastery over their physical forms. They are as widely, if not more, distrusted than the Ministry. ;Orgotek :A multinational technology corporation headquartered in North America, its members are all employees in some fashion or another. They can control the electromagnetic spectrum with the electrokinesis Aptitude. They often take the role of technical experts and engineers. ;Upeo wa Macho (Swahili for \\"Horizon\\") :The Upeo are an African trade organization with the teleportation Aptitude. Although they had been missing for six years as of the core rules, they have since returned, although their absence has not altogether been explained to the public. With their return, regular contact with extrasolar colonies is being re-established. ;Chitra Bhanu :The Chibs are an Indian physics laboratory with the ability to manipulate the nuclear forces of the universe (quantakinesis). They were exterminated because the other psi orders claimed that they had an alliance with the monstrous Aberrants, although there have been rumors of survivors either hiding on their own, or working secretly for other orders. The Chitra Bhanu are an unplayable order.  System  The game runs on a slightly modified version of the White Wolf Storyteller System. A reprint was announced in late 2003 of the three Trinity Universe games using the Open Gaming License 3.5 rules, better known as the d20 System. The latest version by Onyx Path Publishing uses their new Storypath System.

Services = Overview  The JMA is responsible not only for gathering and reporting weather data and forecasts in Japan, but also for observation and warning of earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons and volcanic eruptions. The agency has six regional administrative offices (including five DMOs and Okinawa Meteorological Observatory), four Marine Observatories, five auxiliary facilities, four Aviation Weather Service Centers and 47 local offices composed of the LMOs. These are also used to gather data, supplemented by weather satellites such as Himawari, and other research institutes. In 1968, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) designated the JMA as a Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC) for Asia. In June 1988, the WMO also assigned the JMA as a RSMC for the Northwestern Pacific under its Tropical Cyclone programme. In July 1989, the RSMC Tokyo ‚Äì Typhoon Center was established within the headquarters office, which dealt with the forecasting and dissemination of active tropical cyclones, as well as preparing a summary of each year's cyclone activity.  Observation and forecast  Weather  Land weather  Each DMO and LMO issues weather forecasts and warnings or advisories to the general public live in its own area. Weather data used to these forecasts are acquired from the Surface Observation (represented by the AMeDAS), the Radar Observation, the Upper-air Observation and the Satellite Observation mainly using the Himawari series.  Marine weather  The Marine Observatories are seated in Hakodate, Maizuru, Kobe and Nagasaki. These stations observe ocean waves, tide levels, sea surface temperature and ocean current etc. in the Northwestern Pacific basin, as well as the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk basin, and provide marine meteorological forecasts resulted from them, in cooperation with the Hydrographic and Oceanographic Department, Japan Coast Guard.  Aviation weather  In 2005, in accordance with the ICAO's new CNS/ATM system, the Civil Aviation Bureau of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism set up the Air Traffic Management Center (ATMC) in Fukuoka, where the FIR is fixed. Along with this establishment, JMA placed the Air Traffic Meteorology Center (ATMetC) inside the ATMC. The agency forecasts SIGMET for aircraft in flight within the Fukuoka FIR airspace, while VOLMET is broadcast by each Aviation Weather Service Centers at the airports of Haneda, Narita, Centrair and Kansai. Additionally, Aviation Weather Stations (beside the airports of New Chitose, Sendai, Osaka, Fukuoka, Kagoshima and Naha) deal with the similar tasks as these.  Tropical cyclones  In the Northwestern Pacific area, the typhoon season ordinarily comes almost from May to November. The JMA forecasts and warns or advises on tropical cyclones to the public in Japan and its surrounding countries as well because it also works as the RSMC Tokyo ‚Äì Typhoon Center. = Earthquakes = The JMA has its own 624 observation stations across the country that set up at intervals of 20 km approximately in order to measure seismic intensity of earthquakes precisely. The agency also utilize about 2,900 more seismographs owned by the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED) and local governments. A 24-hour office has been housed within the JMA headquarters in Tokyo, for monitoring and tracking seismic events in the vicinity of Japan to collect and process their data, which issues observed earthquake's information on its hypocenter, magnitude, seismic intensity and possibility of tsunami occurrence after quakes quickly to the public through the Earthquake Phenomena Observation System (EPOS). The Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) system began to work fully for the general public on October 1, 2007. The agency is one of the representatives of the national Coordinating Committee for Earthquake Prediction. = Tsunamis = It is essential to provide coastal regions for tsunami information so that its catastrophic damages can be reduced and mitigated there. In case of there is a possibility of tsunami after an earthquake, JMA issues Tsunami Warning or Advisory for each region in Japan with information of estimated tsunami heights and arrival times within 2 to 3 minutes of the quake. = Volcanoes = The agency set up four Volcanic Observations and Information Centers within DMOs in Sapporo, Sendai, Tokyo and Fukuoka. They are monitoring volcanic events on 110 active volcanos in Japan and 47 of these volcanos selected by the Coordinating Committee for Prediction of Volcanic Eruption are under the 24-hour observation with seismographs, accelerometers, GPS, air- shock recorders, fixed point observation cameras and other equipment. If it is predicted that a volcanic eruption will affect inhabited areas or are around a crater, Volcanic Warnings are issued and supplemented by Volcanic Alert Levels.

Trained as a nuclear physicist, he co-discovered the element neptunium, worked on isotope separation in the Manhattan Project, and wrote the first study of nuclear marine propulsion for submarines. He later worked on a broad range of scientific topics and related public policy, including organic geochemistry, paleobiology and energy policy. Abelson served as editor-in-chief of the journal Science from 1962-84, president of the Carnegie Institution of Washington from 1971-78, and president of the American Geophysical Union from 1972-74. His frequent editorials in Science, both during and after his term as editor, became known for their strident and thought-provoking views. A collection of 100 of his editorials was published as a book, entitled Enough of Pessimism. He may have been the original source of the phrase 'extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence'. Life Abelson was born on April 27, 1913, in Tacoma, Washington. He attended Washington State University, where he received degrees in chemistry and physics, and the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), where he earned his PhD in nuclear physics. As a young physicist, he worked for Ernest Lawrence at the UC Berkeley. He was among the first American scientists to verify nuclear fission in an article submitted to the Physical Review in February 1939. From 1939 until 1941, he worked as an assistant physicist at the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C. It was while he was here that he worked on a substance that emitted beta rays and was produced by irradiation of uranium with neutrons. After he collaborated with the Nobel Prize laureate Luis Alvarez they isolated the material, and became the co-discoverer of neptunium on 8 June 1940 with Edwin McMillan. McMillan was awarded the Nobel Prize for this discovery among other elements. Abelson was a key contributor to the Manhattan Project during World War II, while working with the Naval Research Laboratory. Although he was not formally associated with the atom bomb project, the liquid thermal diffusion isotope separation technique that he invented at the Philadelphia Navy Yard was used in the S-50 plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and proved a critical step in creating the large amount of nuclear fuel required for building atomic bombs. After the war, he turned his attention under the guidance of Ross Gunn to applying nuclear power to naval propulsion. While not written at an engineering-design level, he wrote the first physics report detailing how a nuclear reactor could be installed in a submarine, providing both propulsion and electrical power. His report anticipated the nuclear submarine's role as a missile platform. This concept was later supported by Admiral Hyman G. Rickover and others. Under Rickover, the concept became reality in the form of , the world's first nuclear submarine. In 1946, he returned to work at the Carnegie Institution, which published his report \\"Atomic Energy Submarine,\\" in March of that year.\\"Underway on Nuclear Power\\" -- The Man Behind the Words: Eugene P. \\"Dennis\\" Wilkinson, Vice Admiral USN. The American Nuclear Society. From 1953 until 1971 he served as the director of the Carnegie Institution of Washington's Geophysical Laboratory, and as president from 1971 to 1978, and as a trustee from 1978 on. From 1962 to 1984 he was editor of Science, one of the most prestigious academic journals, and served as its acting executive officer in 1974, 1975 and 1984. From 1972 until 1974 he served as the president of the American Geophysical Union. Abelson was outspoken and well known for his opinions on science. In a 1964 editorial published in Science magazine, Abelson identified overspecialization in science as a form of bigotry. He outlined his view that the pressure towards specialization beginning in undergraduate study and intensifying in PhD programs leads students to believe that their area of specialization is the most important, even to the extreme view that other intellectual pursuits are worthless. He reasoned that such overspecialization led to obsolescence of one's work, often through a focus on trivial aspects of a field, and that avoidance of such bigotry was essential to guiding the direction of one's work. In a 1965 article he described his work in paleobiology and reported evidence of amino acids recovered from fossils hundreds of millions of years in age and fatty acids in rocks dating over a billion years old. He estimated that based on his experiments alanine would be stable for billions of years. Abelson may have been the original source of the phrase 'extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence', which he used in 1978 and was subsequently popularised by Carl Sagan.Rao, K.R., 1978, Psi: Its place in nature. Journal of Parapsychology vol 42. Perhaps his most famous work from this time period is an editorial entitled \\"Enough of Pessimism\\" (\\"enough of pessimism, it only leads to paralysis and decay\\"). This became the title of a 100 essay collection. During the 1970s he became interested in the problem of world energy supplies. Books on the topic include Energy for Tomorrow (1975), from a series of lectures at the University of Washington, and Energy II: Use Conservation and Supply. He pointed out the possibilities of mining the Athabascan tar sands, as well as oil shale in the Colorado Rockies. In addition he urged conservation and a change of attitude towards public transit. After 1984, he remained associated with the magazine. Some have claimed him to be an early skeptic of the case for global warming on the basis of a lead editorial in the magazine dated March 31, 1990, in which he wrote, \\"[I]f the global warming situation is analyzed applying the customary standards of scientific inquiry one must conclude that there has been more hype than solid fact.\\" However, this contrasts what is said in a US National Research Council, Energy and Environment report on which his name appears along with Thomas F. Malone over a decade earlier in 1977: Abelson died on August 1, 2004, from respiratory complications following a brief illness. He was married to Neva Abelson, a distinguished research physician who co- discovered the Rh blood factor test (with L. K. Diamond). Their daughter, Ellen Abelson Cherniavsky, worked as an aviation researcher for the MITRE corporation in Virginia. Awards and legacy Abelson received many distinguished awards, including the National Medal of Science in 1987,National Science Foundation - The President's National Medal of Science the National Science Foundation's Distinguished Achievement Award, the American Medical Association's Scientific Achievement Award, the Navy Distinguished Civilian Service Medal and the Waldo E. Smith Medal in 1988. In 1992 he was awarded the Public Welfare Medal, the National Academy of Sciences's highest honor. He was elected a fellow of the American Physical Society in 1949 and theAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958. The mineral abelsonite is named after Abelson in recognition of his contribution to organic geochemistry. The Philip and Neva Abelson Hall at Washington State University was named in his honor.

Its 1:120 scale (from a common engineering scale where one inch equals ten feet) and gauge are roughly halfway between HO scale (1:87) and N scale (1:160). Its original purpose, like the name suggests, was to make a train set small enough to be able to assemble and operate it on a tabletop. TT retains a comparatively small niche in the United States and in the United Kingdom, but it is the second most popular scale in Eastern Europe and Russia. Adherents to TT maintain it is the smallest practical scale, especially for those who like to build models from scratch. TT scale was widespread in the Eastern Bloc thanks to \\"Berliner Bahnen\\", a manufacturer of the trainsets in TT scale. In wargaming the TT scale roughly equals the 15 mm scale where the height of \\"standard\\" soldier height is . History TT scale was invented in the United States by Hal Joyce, a former automotive designer. He founded a company, H. P. Products, in 1945, and the first advertisement appeared in 1946. The product line included locomotive kits, passenger and freight car kits, track and detail parts. By the early 1950s it had a following, offering less detail than HO‚Äîconsidered by some to be an advantage at the time‚Äîand a lower price than most other scales. Numerous other companies began offering TT scale trains, track, and accessories as well, and TT scale became popular in Europe in addition to the United States. In the immediate period afterward, several other manufacturers also began production of TT items, notably the Kemtron Corporation (founded by Levon Kemalyan), which manufactured metal castings in several scales. Rokal and Zeuke (which became Berliner TT-Bahnen and ultimately Tillig) also began production. By the early 1960s, TT had been eclipsed in popularity by N scale, which is smaller. H. P. Products discontinued manufacturing their TT line in 1968, and the related tooling and kits have been passed through several hands. Rokal ended production in 1969. British TT British TT is 3 mm scale; that is, 1:101.6. The \\"Three Millimetre Society\\" is a British-based society which caters for railway modellers of 3 mm scale. This society was formed in 1965, eight years after Tri-ang Railways, a British railway manufacturer introduced model locomotives and rolling stock, in what was then a new model railway scale in Britain, known as 'TT' or 'TT3' in 1960. The aims of the society are to encourage modellers working in this scale and it produces a quarterly magazine and assists with the production of locomotive and rolling stock kits, components and the supply of secondhand items and spares. Manufacturers Currently Tillig is the largest company to make TT scale rolling stock. Most TT scale track today is also made by Tillig, which offers both standard model railroad track and an integrated roadbed track using Kato's Unijoiner system. But the growing interest for the scale has led to more manufacturers during the last few years, and the scale has also attracted some of the big actors within other scales. Roco launched their first TT products in 1998, and has a small but growing line. Smaller producers like Kuehn and Beckmann have widened their product lines in recent years, just like Hungarian Deak Modelsport and Czech Rubikon and KPA. Fleischmann and created a single TT product (a turntable), but have not continued to develop any new products- since they now share a parent company with Roco, this turntable is now sold under the Roco brand . Russian Peresvet is another manufacturer who produces TT scale models, mostly Russian prototypes. German low-price manufacturer PIKO has also started with a TT line, focusing mainly on German stock. Arnold launched their first new TT models since being bought by Hornby in 2014. There is a larger variety in the accessories market, where some companies have a long-time involvement with the scale and others recently started to support it as well. Prototypes are almost only German (with a focus on the former East Germany) and some Eastern European models. Auhagen is a major supplier of models of Continental buildings. Triang produced a Continental/French range but it was only made for a very short while. One current manufacturer of British TT is 3 mm Scale Model Railways3mm Scale Model Railways. who supply updated GEM and BEC TT kits as well as a large range of Brass Etch and Resin body kits. American manufacturers include Possum Valley Models (kits), Sleepy Hollow/Gold Coast (ready to run and kits, Costal Engineering (kits) DnS TT Track and others.ttscale.com. Various cheap battery toy train sets, typically with plastic track, can also be found in TT gauge. Related scales Variations include TTn3, where TT scale is run on N gauge () track for narrow gauge operation. In New Zealand, this is known as NZ120New Zealand Rail 120. and is growing in popularity as a means of modelling the nation's gauge railway network. TT9 is modelling using British TT scale on 9 mm track to model gauge lines. TTe uses 1:120 scale on Z gauge () track to represent narrow gauges around .

Mathematical properties The number 153 is the 17th triangular number. The colours show that 153 is also the sum of the first five positive factorials. The number 153 is associated with the geometric shape known as the Vesica Piscis or Mandorla. Archimedes, in his Measurement of a Circle, referred to this ratio (153/265), as constituting the \\"measure of the fish\\", this ratio being an imperfect representation of 1/. As a triangular number, 153 is the sum of the first 17 integers, and is also the sum of the first five positive factorials:1!+2!+3!+4!+5!.Wells, D. The Penguin Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Numbers London: Penguin Group. (1987): 140‚Äì141. The number 153 is also a hexagonal number, and a truncated triangle number, meaning that 1, 15, and 153 are all triangle numbers. The distinct prime factors of 153 add up to 20, and so do the ones of 154, hence the two form a Ruth-Aaron pair. Since 153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3, it is a 3-narcissistic number, and it is also the smallest three-digit number which can be expressed as the sum of cubes of its digits. Only five other numbers can be expressed as the sum of the cubes of their digits: 0, 1, 370, 371 and 407.OEIS:A046197 It is also a Friedman number, since 153 = 3 √ó 51, and a Harshad number in base 10, being divisible by the sum of its own digits. The Biggs‚ÄìSmith graph is a symmetric graph with 153 edges, all equivalent. Another feature of the number 153 is that it is the limit of the following algorithm:Catch of the Day (153 Fishes) at mathpages.com.OEIS:A165330 # Take a random positive integer, divisible by three # Split that number into its base 10 digits # Take the sum of their cubes # Go back to the second step An example, starting with the number 84: \\\\begin{align} 8^3 + 4^3 &=& 512 + 64 &=& 576\\\\ 5^3 + 7^3 + 6^3 &=& 125 + 343 + 216 &=& 684\\\\ 6^3 + 8^3 + 4^3 &=& 216 + 512 + 64 &=& 792\\\\ 7^3 + 9^3 + 2^3 &=& 343 + 729 + 8 &=& 1080\\\\ 1^3 + 0^3 + 8^3 + 0^3 &=& 1 + 0 + 512 + 0 &=& 513\\\\ 5^3 + 1^3 + 3^3 &=& 125 + 1 + 27 &=& 153\\\\ 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 &=& 1 + 125 + 27 &=& 153 \\\\end{align} In the Bible Appearance on Lake Tiberias by Duccio, 14th century, showing Jesus and the 7 fishing disciples (with Saint Peter leaving the boat). The Gospel of John (chapter 21:1‚Äì14) includes the narrative of the miraculous catch of 153 fish as the third appearance of Jesus after his resurrection.Biblegateway John 21:1‚Äì14 The precision of the number of fish in this narrative has long been considered peculiar, and many scholars, throughout history, have argued that 153 has some deeper significance. Jerome, for example, wrote that Oppian's Halieutica listed 153 species of fish, although this could not have been the intended meaning of the Gospel writer because Oppian composed Halieutica after the Gospel text was written, and at any rate never gave a list of fish species that clearly adds up to 153. Cornelius √† Lapide writes that the \\"multitude of fishes mystically represents the multitude of the faithful which Peter and the Apostles afterwards caught by the net of evangelical preaching, and converted to Christ\\".The Great Biblical Commentary of Cornelius √† Lapide. Augustine of Hippo argued that the significance lay in the fact that 153 is the sum of the first 17 integers (i.e. 153 is the 17th triangular number), with 17 representing the combination of divine grace (the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit) and law (the Ten Commandments).Jason Byassee, Praise Seeking Understanding: Reading the Psalms with Augustine, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2007, p. 130, .John E. Rotelle (ed) and Edmund Hill (tr), The works of Saint Augustine: A Translation for the 21st Century, Part 3, Volume 7 (Sermons: On the Liturgical Seasons), p. 112, . Theologian D. A. Carson discusses this and other interpretations and concludes that \\"if the Evangelist has some symbolism in mind connected with the number 153, he has hidden it well\\",D. A. Carson, The Gospel According to John (Pillar Commentaries Series), Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1991, p. 673, . while other scholars note that \\"no symbolic significance for the number of 153 fish in John 21:11 has received widespread support.\\"Leland Ryken, Jim Wilhoit, Tremper Longman, Colin Duriez, Douglas Penney, and Daniel G. Reid, Dictionary of Biblical Imagery (Fish), InterVarsity Press, 1998, p. 290, . Writers claiming a major role for Mary Magdalene have noted that in Greek isopsephy her epithet \\"Œ∑ ŒúŒ±Œ≥Œ¥Œ±ŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒÆ\\" bears the number 8 + 40 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 30 + 8 + 50 + 8 = 153, thus, it is suggested, revealing her importance.Margaret Starbird, Magdalene's Lost Legacy: Symbolic Numbers and the Sacred Union in Christianity, Inner Traditions / Bear & Company, 2003, pages 49 and 139, . Similarly, the phrase \\"œÑ·Ω∏ Œ¥ŒØŒ∫œÑœÖŒøŒΩ\\" (the net) used in the passage bears the number 1224 = 8 √ó 153, as do some other phrases. The significance of this is unclear, given that Koine Greek provides a choice of several noun endingsJ.W. Wenham, The Elements of New Testament Greek, Cambridge University Press, 1965. with different isopsephy values.For example, ·º∞œáŒ∏œçœÇ (fish) has isopsephy values of 1219, 1069, 1289, 1029, 1224, 1220, 1869, 1229, and 1279 with the different noun endings on p. 124 of Wenham, and a further range of possibilities when the definite article is added. The number 153 has also been related to the vesica piscis, with the claim that Archimedes used 153 as a \\"shorthand or abbreviation\\" for the square root of 3 in his On the Measurement of the Circle. However, examination of that work shows this to be only partly correct. Evagrius Ponticus referred to the catch of 153 fish, as well as to the mathematical properties of the number (153 = 100 + 28 + 25, with 100 a square number, 28 a triangular number and 25 a circular number) when describing his 153-chapter work on prayer.William Harmless, Desert Christians: An Introduction to the Literature of Early Monasticism, Oxford University Press, 2004, pp. 320‚Äì341, . Louis de Montfort, in his fifth method of saying the Rosary, connects the catch of 153 fish with the number of Hail Marys said (3 plus 15 sets of 10),Montfort.org.uk , \\"its fruitfulness as shown in the net that St. Peter by order of Our Lord threw into the sea and which though filled with 153 fish did not break.\\" while St Paul's School in London was founded in 1512 by John Colet to teach 153 poor men's children, also in reference to the catch.Peter Cunningham, Modern London; or, London as it is, 1851, p. 193.

Design GDebi installing a .deb package Debian packages are standard Unix ar archives that include two tar archives. One archive holds the control information and another contains the installable data. dpkg provides the basic functionality for installing and manipulating Debian packages. Generally end users don't manage packages directly with dpkg but instead use the APT package management software or other APT front-ends such as aptitude (nCurses) and synaptic (GTK). Debian packages can be converted into other package formats and vice versa using alien, and created from source code using checkinstall or the Debian Package Maker. Some core Debian packages are available as udebs (\\"micro debs\\"), and are typically used only for bootstrapping a Debian installation. Although these files use the udeb filename extension, they adhere to the same structure specification as ordinary deb files. However, unlike their deb counterparts, udeb packages contain only essential functional files. In particular, documentation files are normally omitted. udeb packages are not installable on a standard Debian system, but are used in Debian-Installer. Implementation rightFrhed hex editor displaying the raw data of a Debian package.right Prior to Debian 0.93, a package consisted of a file header and two concatenated gzip archives. Since Debian 0.93, a deb package is implemented as an ar archive. This archive contains three files in a specific order: # debian-binary - Contains a single line giving the package format version number. (\`2.0\` for current versions of Debian). # control archive - A tar archive named \`control.tar\` contains the maintainer scripts and the package meta-information (package name, version, dependencies and maintainer). Compressing the archive with gzip or xz is supported. The file extension changes to indicate the compression method. # data archive - A tar archive named \`data.tar\` contains the actual installable files. Compressing the archive with gzip, bzip2, lzma or xz is supported. The file extension changes to indicate the compression method. Control archive The control archive contents can include the following files: * control contains a brief description of the package as well as other information such as its dependencies. * md5sums contains MD5 checksums of all files in the package in order to detect corrupt or incomplete files. * conffiles lists the files of the package that should be treated as configuration files. Configuration files are not overwritten during an update unless specified. * preinst, postinst, prerm and postrm are optional scripts that are executed before or after installing or removing the package. * config is an optional script that supports the debconf configuration mechanism. * shlibs list of shared library dependencies. Signed packages Debian-based distributions support GPG signature verification of signed Debian packages, but most (if not all) have this feature disabled by default. Instead packages are verified by signing the repository metadata (i.e. \`Release\` files). The metadata files in turn include checksums for the repository files as a means to verify authenticity of the files. Currently there are two different implementations for signing individual packages. The first is done via the \`debsigs\` / \`debsig-verify\` toolset, which is supported by dpkg. The second is done through the \`dpkg-sig\` program which is not supported by dpkg, so the packages have to be manually checked with the \`dpkg-sig\` program. Both formats add new sections to the ar archive to store the signature information, but the formats are not compatible with one another. Neither of the modifications to the package format are listed in the official Debian handbook or man page about the binary package format. Adoption * Debian packages are used in distributions based on Debian, such as Ubuntu and many others. * Fink, a port of dpkg and APT to macOS, uses deb packages. * Nexenta OS, a discontinued OS based on OpenSolaris, included Debian package management software and the use of deb packages. * Debian GNU/kFreeBSD, an OS that uses a GNU based userland and the FreeBSD kernel. * Debian GNU/Hurd. * Some jailbroken iOS devices (iPhones, iPads and iPods). * Ipkg and Opkg, which both use .ipk packages that resemble Debian's dpkg See also * List of archive formats * dpkg * wpkg * CheckInstall * List of software package management systems ReferencesExternal links * Debian FAQ:Basics of the Debian package management systemCitation error.

Construction and commissioning The contract to build Trout was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of the General Dynamics Corporation of Groton, Connecticut, on 14 May 1948 and her keel was laid down there on 1 December 1949. She was launched on 21 August 1951, sponsored by Mrs. Albert H. Clark, the widow of Lieutenant Commander Albert H. Clark, the last commanding officer of the previous U.S. Navy ship of the name, . Trout was commissioned on 27 June 1952, with Commander George W. Kittredge in command. Service history=Atlantic Fleet service Trout operated out of New London, Connecticut, as a unit of Submarine Squadron 10 from 1952 to 1959. During this period, she conducted training and readiness operations with ships of the United States Atlantic Fleet and North Atlantic Treaty Organization nations, operating from the North Atlantic Ocean to the Caribbean Sea. She engaged in sonar evaluation tests, antisubmarine warfare exercises, and submerged simulated attack exercises. During submerged exercises in Arctic waters in company with her sister ship , Trout transited beneath ice floes off Newfoundland, Canada, setting a submerged distance record for a conventionally powered submarine. In August 1959, Trout shifted her home port to Charleston, South Carolina, where she was assigned to Submarine Squadron 4. She deployed to the Mediterranean Sea in September 1959 for her first tour of duty with the United States Sixth Fleet. In December 1959, while returning home, she represented the United States at Bergen, Norway, during the 50th anniversary celebrations commemorating the birth of the Royal Norwegian Navy's submarine arm. In February 1960, Trout performed as a test bed for U.S. Navy Bureau of Ships shock tests. She won her first Battle Efficiency Award (Battle \\"E\\") in 1961. In early 1963, she rendered services to the Operational Test and Evaluation Force before commencing a six-month overhaul at Charleston in July 1963. During the remaining years of the 1960s, Trout made three more Mediterranean deployments to serve as a unit of the Sixth Fleet. Between deployments, she participated in training and developmental exercises off the United States East Coast and in the Caribbean Sea. Pacific Fleet service In July 1970, Trout was assigned to the United States Pacific Fleet. From her new home port at San Diego, California, Trout conducted two Western Pacific deployments, one in 1972 and one in 1975, primarily providing submarine services during antisubmarine warfare exercises conducted by warships of the United States Navy, the Republic of Korea Navy, or the Republic of China Navy. Between these deployments, she participated in antisubmarine warfare exercises and conducted local operations off the Southern California coast, punctuating this service with weapons tests in the Pacific Northwest, operating out of Puget Sound in Washington. After returning from her second Western Pacific deployment to San Diego on 29 January 1976, Trout enjoyed a brief unusual duty -- repeatedly diving and surfacing while being filmed to portray the fictitious U.S. Navy nuclear submarine USS Neptune in the opening credits of the 1978 movie Gray Lady Down. Decommissioning and transfer to Iran Trout received orders on 1 December 1976 changing her home port to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1977 and 1978, Trout underwent an extensive overhaul at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard at Philadelphia in anticipation of a planned transfer to the Imperial Iranian Navy. Upon completion of the overhaul in 1978, Trouts home port was shifted to New London, Connecticut, where a training period for her the Iranian crew ensued. The training program was completed on 19 December 1978, and that day the U.S. Navy simultaneously decommissioned Trout, struck her from the Naval Vessel Register, and transferred her to Iran. The Imperial Iranian Navy renamed her Imperial Iranian Ship (IIS) Kousseh (SS 101), meaning \\"Shark\\". Her Iranian crew took control of her at New London in December 1978, but abandoned her there in March 1979 following the Iranian Revolution. Kousseh was returned to Philadelphia, where she languished for many years while the United States resolved financial matters related to her abortive transfer to Iran. Return to U.S. custody and later use Kousseh finally was returned officially to U.S. custody in 1992. She was sold at scrap value to the U.S. Navys Program Executive Office for Undersea Warfare in 1994. She was towed by the tugboat Puma from the Massachusetts Towing Company and moored at Pier 2 at the Naval Station in Newport, Rhode Island. She was then acquired by the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Key West Detachment at Key West, Florida, for use by the Naval Air Systems Command Marine and Targets Detachment as a remotely controlled submersible sonar target ship, as an underwater acoustic target for antisubmarine warfare research and development, in operational testing, and for training. Disposal After completing that service, she was towed to the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility at Philadelphia, where the U.S. Navy held her for donation to a museum, but all preservation efforts failed. In May 2008 Esco Marine of Brownsville, Texas, was awarded a contract to scrap her, and her scrapping was completed on 27 February 2009.

Noted in particular for his knowledge of chords and inversions and chord-based melodies, he was a member of many prominent jazz groups as well as a \\"first call\\" guitarist for studio, film, and television recording sessions. Kessel was a member of the group of session musicians informally known as the Wrecking Crew. Biography right He was Jewish.https://forward.com/schmooze/128890/jazz-jews-in-excelsis/ Kessel began his career as a teenager touring with local dance bands. When he was 16, he started playing with the Oklahoma A&M; band, Hal Price & the Varsitonians. The band members nicknamed him \\"Fruitcake\\" because he practiced up to 16 hours a day. In the early 1940s he moved to Los Angeles, where for one year he was a member of the Chico Marx big band. He appeared in the film Jammin' the Blues, which featured Lester Young. Soon after, he played in the bands of Charlie Barnet and Artie Shaw. During the day, he worked as a studio musician and at night played jazz in clubs. In 1947 he recorded with Charlie Parker. He worked in Jazz at the Philharmonic and for one year in the early 1950s he was a member of the Oscar Peterson trio. After leaving the trio, he recorded several solo albums for Contemporary. He recorded a series of albums with Ray Brown and Shelly Manne as The Poll Winners because the three of them often won polls conducted by Metronome and DownBeat magazines. He was the guitarist on the album Julie Is Her Name (1955) by Julie London, which includes the standard \\"Cry Me a River,\\" which sold a million copies and demonstrated Kessel's chordal approach to guitar. During the 1960s, Kessel worked for Columbia Pictures and was a member of a band of sessions musicians known as The Wrecking Crew. At one point after a two and a half hour session to record a one-chord song, \\"The Beat Goes On,\\" Kessel is reported to have stood up and proclaimed, \\"Never have so many played so little for so much.\\" He recorded with pop acts such as The Monkees and The Beach Boys and with jazz musicians Sonny Rollins and Art Tatum. Kessel eventually left studio work to concentrate on his jazz career both onstage and on records. Along with solo work, he formed the ensemble Great Guitars with Charlie Byrd and Herb Ellis. Kessel was rated the No. 1 guitarist in Esquire, Down Beat, and Playboy magazine polls between 1947 and 1960. From 1961 to 1974 Gibson Guitars manufactured Barney Kessel artist signature guitars in Standard and Custom models.https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/gibson-and-barney-kessel-1 Death Kessel, who had been in poor health after suffering a stroke in 1992, died of a brain tumor at his home in San Diego, California, on May 6, 2004, at the age of 80. Personal life Kessel was married to B. J. Baker. They were divorced in 1980. Kessel's sons Dan and David became record producers and session musicians, working with Phil Spector, John Lennon, Cher, and Leonard Cohen. He was married to Phyllis Magary Van Doren from 1992 until his death.

Talsorian Games in 1994. The game is named for a legendary unbuilt castle in the Bavarian Alps. Players play the roles of gallant adventurers who take on quests of intrigue and derring-do in the spirit of Victorian adventures such as The Prisoner of Zenda.  Setting  The game is set on an alternate earth, in the steampunk era of Victorian \\"New Europa\\" circa 1870. In addition to humans, New Europa is populated by creatures from fantasy such as dragons and faeries. Fictional characters such as Van Helsing can also be encountered. Original edition The game was designed by Mike Pondsmith and published in 1994 by R. Talsorian Games as a 224-page softcover book. Cover art was by William Eaken and Mark Schumann. System The game does not use statistics or dice to define a character. Instead, players must choose a general template of a hero (Heroic, Tragic, Flawed, Innocent, Clever, or Fallen). The player then chooses an archetypal career from a long list including Anarchist, Diplomat, Dashing Hussar, Mad Scientist, and Steam Engineer. Each archetype comes with a set of possessions and a few \\"Strong Suits\\" (aptitudes) and Skills. The player then starts a character diary to record the details of adventures, beginning with the character‚Äôs background and present situation. Players can also choose to play non-human characters such as dragons, faeries and dwarves, but reviewer Mark Swan noted that \\"they come with so much baggage, they're barely worth the effort.\\" Skill resolution is done with an ordinary deck of playing cards rather than dice. At the start of the game, the referee deals everyone four cards, including himself. When a player wants to test a skill, the referee rates the difficulty of the task from 2 to 12. The referee can also play one or more of his cards adding the value of the card or cards to the difficulty rating. The player attempting the task must use his character's relevant skill level plus the value of any cards the player wishes to add. If the character's skill level plus the value of the player's cards equals or betters the task's difficulty level, the character succeeds. Combat operates using the same system. Spellcasters use a second deck of cards. When the spellcaster wishes to cast a spell, the player must draw cards from the deck, one card per two minutes of game time, until the sum of the cards equals or exceeds the power of the spell. Even then, success is not guaranteed, and a spell can backfire with disastrous consequences. Other editions In 2000, Steve Jackson Games published GURPS Castle Falkenstein under license using the GURPS rule system. In 2016, Fat Goblin Games signed a deal with R. Talsorian Games to produce new supplements for Castle Falkenstein using the original rules system. The first of these supplements, Curious Creatures, appeared in 2016, and additional supplements were subsequently published. Reception In the December 1994 edition of Pyramid, Scott Haring admired the tenor of the game, saying, \\"This is not a game of sullen anti-heroes, angst and moral dilemmas; this is a grand game of world-spanning plots, pure heroes and diabolical villains. [Designer Mike] Pondsmith has done a great job of setting the stage for grand dramatic battles between good and evil without once letting it descend into melodrama or parody. This is a game that believes in itself and its premise 100%, but without drowning in pretentiousness or self-importance.\\" Haring concluded, \\"Castle Falkenstein is a breath of fresh air in roleplaying, a game where real heroes matter and don‚Äôt have to apologize. The book is physically gorgeous, the game mechanics fit the tone of the game world like a glove, the writing is wonderful, and the game world is enchanting.\\" In the February 1995 edition of Dragon (Issue 214), Rick Swan was enthusiastic about the game, calling it \\"an alternative reality that‚Äôs one part fact, ten parts fun house... a crazy quilt of steam-age technology and social anarchy.\\" He recommended the game, saying, \\"This is about as good as it gets.\\" In a 1996 reader poll conducted by Arcane magazine to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time, Castle Falkenstein was ranked 45th. Editor Paul Pettengale commented: \\"Castle Falkenstein is one of those games that people tend to either love or hate. It has a unique atmosphere, combining alternate history, Celtic mythology, steampunk and a somewhat whimsical, fairy-tale feel. Likewise, the rulebook itself is quite different from many, being laid out as a novel, with important information pulled out in sidebars, and the rules coming later. This reflects the main thrust of the system, which is heavily geared towards roleplaying and storytelling over game mechanics and numbers, and drops dice in favour of a couple of packs of playing cards.\\" Awards *Best Roleplaying Rules of 1994 Origins Award, Castle Falkenstein, R.

Her keel was laid down on 19 February 1921 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation's Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts. She was launched on 27 October 1923 sponsored by Mrs. H. E. Grieshaber, and was commissioned on 16 February 1925 with Lieutenant Arnold H. Bateman in command. Service history=1924‚Äì1941 S-44 operated off the New England coast into the summer of 1925. In late August, she departed New London, Connecticut, for Panama and on 5 September arrived at Coco Solo to join Submarine Division (SubDiv) 19. With the division, she conducted training exercises, participated in fleet exercises and joint Army-Navy maneuvers, and made good will visits to various Caribbean and Pacific, Latin American ports until the spring of 1927. From that time to December 1930, she operated out of San Diego with her division, interrupting exercises off southern California twice for fleet problems in Hawaiian waters. In December 1930, the S-boat was transferred to Hawaii where her division, now SubDiv 11, was home ported for four years. The boats then returned to San Diego, California and in 1937 were shifted back to Coco Solo. World War II In the spring of 1941, as American involvement in World War II increased, the Panama S-boats were ordered back to the east coast for overhaul. With sister ships and , S-44 proceeded to New London, Connecticut, and in November went to Philadelphia, where the work was completed. Trials took S-44 into the new year, and on 7 January 1942, she got underway for Panama. Arriving on 16 January, she departed Balboa on 24 January with , , and , to conduct a security patrol in the western approaches to the canal. Within a few hours, however, she was engaged in rescue operations for S-26, which had been rammed and sunk by submarine chaser PC-460. =First patrol, March 1942= From Panama, the division (now SubDiv 53) was ordered to the southwest Pacific. Starting across the Pacific in early March, the boats reached Brisbane in mid-April, and within ten days, S-44 was on her first war patrol. She cleared Moreton Bay on 24 April. Three days later, her port engine went out of commission, but 36 hours of hard work and ingenuity put it back in operation. On 29 April, she began running submerged during the day and surfacing at night to recharge batteries and allow fresh air into the non-air-conditioned boat. By 2 May, she was in her patrol area, New Britain-New Ireland waters. Six days later, she sighted a ship through a haze of rain and launched two torpedoes which missed. She attempted to close the range. However the surface ship easily outdistanced her. The next afternoon, she attempted to close on a Japanese destroyer, east of Adler Bay, but again was easily outrun. On 10 May, off Cape St. George, she closed on another target but was sighted and attacked. In late afternoon of 12 May, from the cape, she encountered a merchantman and a trawler escort. For the first time, the weather, her position, and the target's course were all in her favor. She launched four torpedoes while surfaced and hit with two. She then submerged. Shoei Maru, a salvage vessel of over 5,000 tons was sunk. The Japanese escort attacked S-44 and dropped sixteen or more depth charges, none of which was close. On 14 May, S-44 headed home, arriving at Brisbane on 23 May. =2nd patrol, June 1942= Another overhaul followed, and on 7 June she left of Moreton Bay on a course for the Solomon Islands. Within the week, she was on patrol off Guadalcanal, operating from there to Savo and Florida Island. A few days later, she shifted south of Guadalcanal and on 21 June sank the converted gunboat Keijo Maru. At 14:15, S-44 fired her torpedoes. Just three minutes later the enemy aircraft dropped a bomb which exploded close to the submarine, bending the holding latch to the conning tower and allowing in 30 gallons of sea water. This damaged the depth gauges, the gyrocompass, and the ice machine, besides causing leaks. The number-one periscope was thought to be damaged; but when the submarine surfaced a Japanese seaman's coat was found wrapped around its head. Three days later, S-44 was in Lunga Roads. On 26 June, poor weather set in and blanketed the area until she turned for home. She departed her patrol area on 29 June and arrived at Moreton Bay on 5 July. =3rd patrol, July 1942= S-44 departed Brisbane on 24 July. Cloudy weather with squalls set in. On 31 July, she commenced patrolling the Rabaul- Tulagi shipping lanes. The next day, she sighted a convoy off Cape St. George, but heavy swells hindered depth control and speed, and prevented her from attacking. From Cape St. George, S-44 moved up the east coast of New Ireland to North Cape and Kavieng, where she waited. On 7 August, the American offensive opened with landing of the 1st Marine Division on the beaches of the Solomon Islands of Guadalcanal and Tulagi. On 9 August, off Savo Island, Cruiser Division 6 of the Imperial Japanese Navy had inflicted one of the worst defeats of the war on American and Australian surface ships. The cruiser Furutaka, sister ship of Kako The next morning, the victorious enemy cruisers neared Kavieng, bound for home.Blair, Clay, Jr. Silent Victory (New York: Bantam, 1976), pp. 298. At 07:50, S-44 sighted the formation of four heavy cruisers at less than . At 08:06, she fired four Mark 10 torpedoes at the rear ship, only away. By 08:08, three torpedoes had exploded and the heavy cruiser Kako was sinking. S-44 had claimed the largest Japanese man-of-war in the Pacific War to date.Freddy Warder, Bill Brockman, Bull Wright, Dick Voge, & Gene McKinney, among others had all been mistakenly credited before; none were confirmed by JANAC. The sinking earned Dinty Moore a Navy Cross. Blair, pp. 298‚Äì299. Three days later, S-44 was again fighting heavy swells. Her damaged bow planes required three hours to rig out, where they were left. On 23 August, she moored at Brisbane. With one ship sunk on each patrol so far, she set a record no other S-boat would match.Blair, p. 299. =4th patrol, September 1942= On 17 September, now in the hands of Reuben Whitaker,His only S-boat patrol. Blair, p. 299. S-44 began her fourth war patrol. The following day, a hydrogen fire blazed in her forward battery compartment, but was extinguished in three minutes. On 22 September, she began surfacing only at night, and, two days later, took patrol station off New Georgia to interdict Japan's Faisi-Guadalcanal supply line. During the patrol, her hunting was hindered by Japanese aerial and surface antisubmarine patrols and her own operational capabilities, which were further limited by material defects and damage inflicted during depth chargings. On the morning of 4 October, she attacked a destroyer,Though Whitaker was credited with a sinking at the time, JANAC put the credit at zero. Blair, pp. 299 & 913. then survived an intensive depth charge attack with seemingly minor damage. When she submerged the next day, however, the submarine began taking water. She surfaced, made repairs, then submerged to . Leaks were found in her motor room and torpedo room flappers. The latter were jacked shut, but the former continued spraying water onto both motors. Within an hour, four Japanese destroyers had moved into the area. S-44 went to . The leak worsened. The motors were covered in canvas and sheet rubber and the crew waited for the destroyers to pass over her position. As they disappeared, S-44 moved up to and repairs were made on the flapper. That night, further repairs were made while the ship was surfaced off Santa Isabel Island; and, by midnight, the S-boat was en route back to her patrol area. On 7 October, bad weather set in; and, on 8 October, she departed the area, arriving in Moreton Bay on 14 October. =Overhaul= A month later, S-44 departed Brisbane and headed back to the United States. In early January 1943, she transited the Panama Canal, then moved across the Caribbean Sea and up the Atlantic seaboard to Philadelphia. There, from April to June, she underwent overhaul; and, in July, she retransited the Canal en route to San Diego and the Aleutian Islands. =Fifth patrol, September 1943= She arrived at Dutch Harbor on 16 September. On 26 September, she departed Attu on her last war patrol. One day out, while en route to her operating area in the northern Kuril Islands, she was spotted and attacked by a Japanese patrol plane. Suffering no damage, she continued west. On the night of 7 October, she made radar contact with what she thought was a \\"small merchantman\\" and closed for a surface attack. Several hundred yards from the target, her deck gun fired and was answered by a salvo. The \\"small merchantman\\" in fact was the escort . An emergency dive was ordered, but the submarine failed to submerge. She then took several hits in the control room, below the waterline in the after battery room,Blair, p.420. and elsewhere. Reluctantly, S-44 was ordered abandoned. A pillow case was raised from the forward battery room hatch as a flag of surrender, but the Japanese shelling continued. Only two men escaped the sinking vessel. They were taken first to Paramushiro, then to the Naval Interrogation Camp at ≈åfuna. The two men spent the last year of World War II working in the Ashio copper mines and survived to be repatriated by the Allies at the end of the war.

Fringe science may be either a questionable application of a scientific approach to a field of study or an approach whose status as scientific is widely questioned. For mainstream scientists, attributes of fringe science include being highly speculative or relying on premises already refuted. Fringe science theories are often advanced by persons who have no traditional academic science background, or by researchers outside the mainstream discipline. The general public has difficulty distinguishing between science and its imitators, and in some cases a \\"yearning to believe or a generalized suspicion of experts is a very potent incentive to accepting pseudoscientific claims\\". The term \\"fringe science\\" covers everything from novel hypotheses which can be tested by means of the scientific method to wild ad hoc hypotheses and mumbo jumbo. This has resulted in a tendency to dismiss all fringe science as the domain of pseudoscientists, hobbyists, and cranks. A concept that was once accepted by the mainstream scientific community may become fringe science because of a later evaluation of previous research. For example, focal infection theory, which held that focal infections of the tonsils or teeth are a primary cause of systemic disease, was once considered to be medical fact. It has since been dismissed because of lack of evidence. Description The term \\"fringe science\\" denotes unorthodox scientific theories and models. Persons who create fringe science may have employed the scientific method in their work, but their results are not accepted by the mainstream scientific community. Fringe science may be advocated by a scientist who has some recognition within the larger scientific community, but this is not always the case. Usually the evidence provided by fringe science is accepted only by a minority and is rejected by most experts. The boundary between fringe science and pseudoscience is disputed. The connotation of \\"fringe science\\" is that the enterprise is rational but is unlikely to produce good results for a variety of reasons, including incomplete or contradictory evidence. Pseudoscience, however, is something that is not scientific but is incorrectly characterised as science. The term may be considered pejorative. For example, Lyell D. Henry Jr. wrote that, \\"fringe science [is] a term also suggesting kookiness.\\" This characterization is perhaps inspired by the eccentric behavior of many researchers of the kind known colloquially (and with considerable historical precedent) as mad scientists. Although most fringe science is rejected, the scientific community has come to accept some portions of it. One example of such is plate tectonics, an idea which had its origin in the fringe science of continental drift and was rejected for decades. Examples=Historical Some historical ideas that are considered to have been refuted by mainstream science are: *Wilhelm Reich's work with orgone, a physical energy he claimed to have discovered, contributed to his alienation from the psychiatric community. He was eventually sentenced to two years in a federal prison, where he died. At that time and continuing today, scientists disputed his claim that he had scientific evidence for the existence of orgone. Nevertheless, amateurs and a few fringe researchers continued to believe that orgone is real. *Focal infection theory (FIT) as the primary cause of systemic disease rapidly became accepted by mainstream dentistry and medicine after World War I. This acceptance was largely based upon what later turned out to be fundamentally flawed studies. As a result, millions of people were subjected to needless dental extractions and surgeries. The original studies supporting FIT began falling out of favor in the 1930s. By the late 1950s, it was regarded as a fringe theory. *The Clovis First theory held that the Clovis culture was the first culture in North America. It was long regarded as a mainstream theory until mounting evidence of a pre-Clovis culture discredited it.Whitley, David S. (2009) Cave paintings and the human spirit p. 98 Modern Relatively recent fringe sciences include: * Aubrey de Grey, featured in a 2006 60 Minutes special report, is studying human longevity. He calls his work \\"Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence\\" (SENS). Many mainstream scientists believe his research is fringe science (especially his view of the importance of nuclear epimutations and his timeline for antiaging therapeutics). In a 2005 article in Technology Review (part of a larger series), it was stated that \\"SENS is highly speculative. Many of its proposals have not been reproduced, nor could they be reproduced with today's scientific knowledge and technology. Echoing Myhrvold, we might charitably say that de Grey's proposals exist in a kind of antechamber of science, where they wait (possibly in vain) for independent verification. SENS does not compel the assent of many knowledgeable scientists; but neither is it demonstrably wrong.\\" (includes June 9, 2006 critiques and rebuttals) * A nuclear fusion reaction called cold fusion which occurs near room temperature and pressure was reported by chemists Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons in March 1989. Numerous research efforts at the time were unable to replicate their results. Subsequently, a number of scientists have worked on cold fusion or have participated in international conferences on it. In 2004, the United States Department of Energy commissioned a panel on cold fusion to take another look at it. They wanted to determine whether their policies concerning it should be altered because of new evidence. *The theory of abiogenic petroleum origin holds that petroleum was formed from deep carbon deposits, perhaps dating to the formation of the Earth. The ubiquity of hydrocarbons in the solar system is taken as evidence that there may be a great deal more petroleum on Earth than commonly thought, and that petroleum may originate from carbon-bearing fluids which migrate upward from the Earth's mantle. Abiogenic hypotheses saw a revival in the last half of the twentieth century by Russian and Ukrainian scientists. More interest was generated in the West after the 1999 publication by Thomas Gold of The Deep Hot Biosphere. Gold's version of the theory is partly based on the existence of a biosphere composed of thermophile bacteria in the Earth's crust, which might explain the existence of certain biomarkers in extracted petroleum. Accepted as mainstream Some theories that were once rejected as fringe science, but were eventually accepted as mainstream science, are: * Plate tectonicsBell, David, 2005, Science, Technology and Culture, Open University Press, p. 134, Oreskes, Naomi (2003), Plate tectonics: an insider's history of the modern theory of the Earth p. 72 * The existence of TroyConklin, Wendy (2005) Mysteries in History: Ancient History p. 39Hunt, Patrick (2007) Ten Discoveries That Rewrote History * HeliocentrismJDobrzycki J Editor (1973) The reception of Copernicus' heliocentric theory p. 311 * Norse colonization of the Americas * The Big Bang theoryLemonick, Michael D.

Friedlander has suggested some guidelines for responding to fringe science, which, he argues, is a more difficult problem than scientific misconduct. His suggested methods include impeccable accuracy, checking cited sources, not overstating orthodox science, thorough understanding of the Wegener continental drift example, examples of orthodox science investigating radical proposals, and prepared examples of errors from fringe scientists. Friedlander suggests that fringe science is necessary so that mainstream science will not atrophy. Scientists must evaluate the plausibility of each new fringe claim, and certain fringe discoveries \\"will later graduate into the ranks of accepted\\" ‚Äî while others \\"will never receive confirmation\\". Margaret Wertheim profiled many \\"outsider scientists\\" in her book Physics on the Fringe, who receive little or no attention from professional scientists. She describes all of them as trying to make sense of the world using the scientific method, but in the face of not being able to understand the complex theories of modern science. She also finds it fair that credentialed scientists do not bother spending a lot of time learning about and explaining problems with the fringe theories of uncredentialed scientists, since the authors of those theories have not taken the time to understand the mainstream theories they aim to disprove.http://podcastdownload.npr.org/anon.npr- podcasts/podcast/77/510036/143369581/KERA_143369581.mp3 Controversies Towards the end of the 20th century, some critics (such as Answers in Genesis) began to cite fringe science theories with limited support. Often their goal was to classify as controversial entire fields of scientific inquiry (notably paleoanthropology, human sexuality, evolution, geology, and paleontology) that contradict literal or fundamentalist interpretation of various sacred texts. Critics argue that such controversies open a window of plausibility for divine intervention and intelligent design.: Amicus curiae brief of 72 Nobel laureates, 17 state academies of science, and 7 other scientific organizations in support of appellees in As Donald E. Simanek asserts, \\"Too often speculative and tentative hypotheses of cutting edge science are treated as if they were scientific truths, and so accepted by a public eager for answers.\\" But the public is ignorant of the fact that \\"As science progresses from ignorance to understanding it must pass through a transitional phase of confusion and uncertainty.\\" The media also play a role in propagating the belief that certain fields of science are controversial.

Pachucos are male members of a counterculture associated with zoot suit fashion, jazz and swing music, a distinct dialect known as cal√≥, and self-empowerment in rejecting assimilation into Anglo-American society that emerged in El Paso in the late 1930s. The pachuco counterculture flourished among Chicano boys and men in the 1940s as a symbol of rebellion, especially in Los Angeles. It spread to women who became known as pachucas and were perceived as unruly, masculine, and un-American. Some pachucos adopted strong attitudes of social defiance, engaging in la vida loca seen as deviant by white society, such as marijuana smoking, gang activity, and a turbulent night life. Although concentrated among a relatively small group of Mexican Americans, the pachuco counterculture became iconic among Chicanos and a predecessor for the cholo subculture which emerged among Chicano youth in the 1980s. Pachucos emerged in El Paso, Texas among a group of Chicano youth who were influenced by African American culture and urban 'hep cats,' although it may have roots in Pachuca, Hidalgo, Mexico, where loose-fitting clothing was popular among men. It later spread throughout the Southwest into Los Angeles, where it developed further. In the border areas of California and Texas, a distinct youth culture known as pachuquismo developed in the 1940s and has been credited as an influence to Chicanismo. Pachuco zoot suiters were influenced by Black zoot suiters in the jazz and swing music scene on the east coast. In LA, Chicano zoot suiters developed their own cultural identity, \\"with their hair done in big pompadours, and 'draped' in tailor-made suits ... They spoke c√°lo, their own language, a cool jive of half-English, half-Spanish rhythms ... Out of the zoot-suiter experience came lowrider cars and culture, clothes, music, tag names, and, again, its own graffiti language.\\" Pachucos were perceived as alien to both Mexican and Anglo-American culture‚Äìa distinctly Chicano figure. In Mexico, the pachuco was understood \\"as a caricature of the American,\\" while in the United States he was perceived as so-called \\"proof of Mexican degeneracy.\\" Mexican critics such as Octavio Paz denounced the pachuco as a man who had \\"lost his whole inheritance: language, religion, customs, belief.\\" In response, Chicanos heavily criticized Paz and embraced the oppositional position of the pachuco as an embodied representation of resistance to Anglo-American cultural hegemony. To Chicanos, the pachuco had acquired and emanated self-empowerment and agency through a \\"stylized power\\" of rebellious resistance and spectacular excess. Etymology The origin of the term \\"pachuco\\" is uncertain, but one theory connects it to the city of El Paso, Texas, which was sometimes referred to as \\"Chuco Town\\" or \\"El Chuco.\\" People migrating to El Paso from Ciudad Juarez would say, in Spanish, that they were going \\"pa' El Chuco.\\" Some say \\"pa El Chuco\\" comes from the words Shoe Co., a shoe company that was located in El Paso in the 1940s during the war. The majority of Mexican migrants would cross the border in order to work for this famous shoe company in El paso. Through out the years the term \\"pa El Chuco\\" was used when Mexican immigrants were heading to El Paso looking for a job. In order to cross the American border with success the migrants would have to dress nice and look nice other wise they would get rejected at the border. These migrants became known as pachucos.Zoot Suit Discovery Guide. L.A. in the Zoot Suit Era. Retrieved 2 June 2013. The name \\"Pachuco\\" is quite possibly derived from the name of the city of Pachuca, Hidalgo, Mexico. There have long been migrants from Hidalgo state living in Texas. Another theory says that the word derives from pocho, a derogatory term for a Mexican born in the United States who has lost touch with the Mexican culture. The word is also said to mean \\"punk\\" or \\"troublemaker.\\" Yet another theory is put forth by author Laura L. Cummings who postulates a possible indigenous origin of the term. Connections have also been found between \\"Pachucos\\" and mixed civilians who lived near the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican border during the turn of the century, and between \\"Pachucos\\" and the poor soldiers who fought in the Mexican Revolution in the armies of Pancho Villa. Pachucos called their slang Cal√≥ (sometimes called \\"pachuquismo\\"), a unique argot that drew on the original Spanish Gypsy Cal√≥, Mexican Spanish, the New Mexican dialect of Spanish, and American English, employing words and phrases creatively applied. To a large extent, Cal√≥ went mainstream and is one of the last surviving vestige of the Pachuco, often used in the lexicon of some urban Latinos in the United States to this day. The influence of Vald√©s is responsible for the assimilation of several Cal√≥ terms into Mexican slang.  Style  Pachuco style was a dominating trend among Mexican-American youth in the 1930s-40s. Pachucos became known for their distinguished look, dialogue, and actions. Pachucos dressed in recognizable Zoot suits, and often styled their hair into ducktails. Things like decorative chains and tattoos were also sometimes part of the pachuco look. The unique speech of pachucos was a very important element of their defined style. Consisting of creative phrases and some English words, Cal√≥ (Chicano) was a very popular form of speech among pachucos. Pachucos were seen as gangsters in the eyes of white conservatives Americans with racial prejudices. Culture Statue of the Mexican actor Germ√°n Vald√©s better known as Tin TanThe Mexican Nobel laureate Octavio Paz writes in the essay, \\"The Pachuco and Other Extremes\\" that the Pachuco phenomenon paralleled the zazou subculture in World War II-era Paris in style of clothing, music favored (jazz, swing, and jump blues), and attitudes. Although there was no known link between the two subcultures, they both are most certainly derivative localized blends of American pop culture in the United States. While he was not the first Mexican comedian to perform as a Mexican American zoot suiter, Mexican comedian and film actor German Vald√©s better-known by his artistic name \\"Tin-Tan\\" is Mexico‚Äôs most famous and celebrated pachuco. Pachuco culture in America was at its height during World War II. The Wartime Productions Board in 1942 thought it necessary to cut back on fabric consumption, so they enacted regulations on the amount of fabric used for suits. This enactment targeted Pachucos in particular because of the excess fabric used in their zoot suits. Pachucos boldly chose not to follow these regulations, demonstrating rebellious attitudes and pride in their culture. Pachucos continued to flaunt zoot suits, now attained through bootleg tailors. As a result, these flashy zoot suits were seen as unpatriotic by other Americans. This controversial series of events helped shape Pachuco culture, and zoot suits became a symbol of cultural pride among Mexican-Americans. It didn't all end well, however, as this also led to rising tension between Pachucos and other Americans, playing a part in the start of the 1944 Zoot Suit Riots. The pachuco subculture declined in the 1960s, evolving into the Chicano style. This style preserved some of the pachuco slang while adding a strong political element characteristic of the late 1960s American life. In the early 1970s, a recession and the increasingly violent nature of gang life resulted in an abandonment of anything that suggested dandyism. Accordingly, Mexican-American gangs adopted a uniform of T-shirts and khakis derived from prison uniforms, and the pachuco style died out. However, the zoot suit remains a popular choice of formal wear for urban and rural Latino youths in heavily ethnic Mexican neighborhoods. It is typically worn at a prom, in weddings, parties or in some cases, at informal Latino university commencement ceremonies. La Pachuca The \\"Pachuca,\\" the female counterpart of the Pachuco, had an aesthetic sensibility as strong as the male zoot suiter. The Pachuca's hairstyle tended to be a high \\"coif\\" or bouffant, with the hair put up in some way (a more pronounced version of the typical hair style of the time) by ratting their hair or affixing hair rats. Their makeup was heavy, particularly using a red colored lipstick. The preferred colors of clothing were black and gray. Some pachucas wore the traditionally male zoot suit, albeit with modifications to fit the female form. This was very subversive at the time because of long-held gender roles that dictated how a person should dress. Sometimes, she donned the standard heavy gold pocket chain. Another variation involved a sweater or coat - often a variant on the male zoot-suit finger-tip jacket - over knee-length skirts, plus fishnet stockings or bobby socks and platform shoes.Ram√≠rez, Catherine S., The Woman in the Zoot Suit: Gender, Nationalism, and the Cultural Politics of Memory. Durham: Duke University Press, 2009. p. xii Extravagant dresses were and are also common among pachucas. Like the entire culture, the fashion aesthetic revolved around the concept of \\"see and be seen.\\" This style was associated with gang membership and activity largely due to the Zoot Suit Riots that took place in Southern California in 1943. The negative image of the male zoot suiter as a \\"violent gangster\\" naturally extended to the Pachuca as well. The promiscuous image came from the Pachuca's high public visibility and patronage of nightlife with pachucos. This image contrasted with the traditional Latino-American image of femininity at the time which held that the \\"good\\" minority woman stayed in the home. The Pachuca's challenge to the dominant perception of femininity came during the period between the advent of women's suffrage in 1920 and the upsurge in feminist activism of the 1960s and 1970s.  Costa Rica  The term \\"\\" is used in Costa Rica to define Costa Rican slang. It nevertheless differs from the Mexican slang. In Costa Rica the term \\"pachuco\\" refers to someone who has common habits and who is often very rude. In Costa Rica the word pachuco refers to a person who has manners that are socially unacceptable and often uses shocking language when speaking. Pachuco is also a pejorative name given to certain colloquial words and expressions. Some consider pachuco and its pachuquismos to be Costa Rica's second language.

Succeeding to the marquisate at the age of only six months, his vast inheritance reportedly made him the richest man in the world. His conversion to Catholicism from the Church of Scotland at the age of 21 scandalised Victorian society and led Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli to use the Marquess as the basis for the eponymous hero of his novel Lothair, published in 1870. Marrying into one of Britain's most illustrious Catholic families, Bute became one of the leaders of the British Catholic community. His enormous expenditure on building and restoration made him the foremost architectural patron of the 19th century. Lord Bute died at the age of only 53 in 1900; his heart was buried on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem. He was a Knight Grand Cross of the Holy Sepulchre, Knight of the Order of St. Gregory the Great and Hereditary Keeper of Rothesay Castle. Early life Portrait of Lord Bute as a boy The future Marquess was born at the family seat of Mount Stuart, on the Isle of Bute in Scotland, to John, 2nd Marquess of Bute, and Lady Sophia Rawdon-Hastings (daughter of The 1st Marquess of Hastings, an Anglo-Irish peer from Ulster). For the first almost six months of his life, he was known as the Earl of Dumfries. The Crichton-Stuarts were illegitimate offspring of the Scottish royal House of Stuart, ennobled in the 17th century. The foundations of the family's fortunes were laid by John, 3rd Earl of Bute, Prime Minister to King George III, who married an heiress, Mary Wortley- Montagu, and attained great political prominence, although this was not accompanied by great political success. His son, John, 1st Marquess of Bute, out-stripped his father by marrying two heiresses, Charlotte Hickman, daughter of The 2nd Viscount Windsor, and Frances Coutts, of the Coutts banking dynasty. By his first marriage, the Marquess fathered John Stuart who in turn fathered John, 2nd Marquess of Bute, the founder of modern Cardiff and father of the 3rd Marquess. The 2nd Marquess was a far-sighted early industrialist and began, at great financial risk, the development of Cardiff as a port to export the mineral wealth of the South Wales Valleys. Accumulating great debts and mortgages on his admittedly vast estates, the Marquess rightly foresaw the potential of Cardiff, telling his concerned solicitor in 1844, \\"I am willing to think well of my income in the distance.\\" The following fifty years saw his faith triumphantly vindicated, but the ensuing riches were to be enjoyed, and spent, by his son, \\"the richest man in the world\\", rather than himself. Statue of The 3rd Marquess of Bute in the Friary Gardens, Cathays Park, Cardiff, Wales The 2nd Marquess died in 1848 and his son succeeded to the Marquessate when less than six months old. He was educated at Harrow School and Christ Church, Oxford. His mother died when he was twelve. Bute had been attracted to the Roman Catholic Church since childhood, and the efforts of his guardians to weaken this attraction only added to it. He was never a member of the Church of England, despite efforts by Henry Parry Liddon to attract him to it. Bute's letters to one of his very few intimate friends during his Oxford career show with what conscientious care he worked out the religious question for himself. On 8 December 1868, he was received into the Church by Monsignor Capel at a convent in Southwark, and a little later was confirmed by Pius IX in Rome, resulting in a public scandal. His conversion was the inspiration for Benjamin Disraeli's novel, Lothair. Lord Bute's eclectic early education gave him a lifelong interest in architecture, and his father's accumulated wealth was to give him the means to indulge this interest on a stupendous scale. He came to love scholarly research, and wrote on the Celtic and mediaeval periods. But it would be entirely wrong to view the 3rd Marquess as a dilettante; his interests were serious, scholarly and profound. Interests Mount Stuart House The Marquess's vast range of interests, which included religion, medievalism, the occult, architecture, travelling, linguistics, and philanthropy, filled his relatively short life. A prolific writer, bibliophile and traveller, as well as, somewhat reluctantly, a businessman, his energies were on a monumentally Victorian scale. \\"A liturgist and ecclesiologist of real distinction\\", he published on a wide range of topics. But at a distance, just over one hundred years from his death, it is his architectural patronage as \\"the greatest builder of country houses in nineteenth-century Britain\\" that creates his lasting memorial. In 1865, the Marquess met William Burges and the two embarked on an architectural partnership, the results of which long outlasted Burges' own death in 1881. Bute's desires and money allied with Burges' fantastical imagination and skill led to the creation of two of the finest examples of the late Victorian era Gothic Revival, Cardiff Castle and Castell Coch. The two buildings represent both the potential of colossal industrial wealth and the desire to escape the scene of that wealth's creation. The theme recurs again and again in the huge outpouring of Bute's patronage, in chapels, castle, abbeys, universities and palaces. Bute's later buildings are hardly less remarkable than his collaborations with Burges. Robert Rowand Anderson rebuilt the Georgian Mount Stuart House for him, and Bute worked in collaboration with many of Burges's colleagues, including William Frame and Horatio Walter Lonsdale, on the interiors. John Kinross was Bute's architect for the sympathetic and creative reworking of the partially ruined Falkland Palace. Kinross also restored Greyfriars in Elgin for Bute. As a burgess of Cardiff, the Marquess accepted the invitation to be mayor of Cardiff for the municipal year from November 1890. Patronage His bookplate The Marquess's patronage was extensive, with a particular enthusiasm for buildings of religion and academia. Whilst Rector of the University of St Andrews, he provided the University with a new home for its Medical School and endowed the Bute Chair of Medicine. A supporter of education for women, he also paid for St Andrews University's first female lecturer, who taught anatomy to women medical students when Professor James Bell Pettigrew refused to do so. At the University of Glasgow, he gifted the funds required to complete the University's huge central hall, named the Bute Hall in his honour, and he is commemorated both at the University's Commemoration Day and on its Memorial Gates. He was made the Honorary President () of the Highland Society of the University of Edinburgh. Between 1868 and 1886 he financed the rebuilding of St Margaret's Parish Church, Roath, Cardiff, creating a new mausoleum for the Bute family with sarcophagi in red marble.Lynn F. Pearson, Mausoleums, Shire Publications Ltd. (2002), page 39. In 1866 he donated a site in Cardiff Docks for the Hamadryad Hospital Ship for sick seafarers and, on his death in 1900, bequeathed ¬£20,000 towards the cost of a new bricks-and- mortar hospital, which became the Royal Hamadryad. The Marquess of Bute's Case The Marquess was involved in a notable company law case, known as \\"the Marquess of Bute's Case\\", reported on appeal in 1892, called Re Cardiff Savings Bank [1892] 2 Ch 100. The Marquess had been appointed to the board of directors of the Cardiff Savings Bank as \\"President\\", at the age of six months, in effect inheriting the office from his father. He only attended one board meeting in the next 38 years. When the bank became insolvent following a fellow director's fraudulent dealing, Stirling J held that the Marquess was not liable as he knew nothing of what was going on. It was not suggested that he ought to have known what was going on, or that he had a duty of care to inform himself as to the affairs of the bank. The case set a famous legal precedent, now superseded, for the minimal view of the duties of company directors. It was naturally a considerable embarrassment for the Marquess, although he escaped legal blame. Family life John, 3rd Marquess of Bute, married Gwendolen Fitzalan-Howard (daughter of The 1st Baron Howard of Glossop and granddaughter of The 13th Duke of Norfolk) in 1872 and had four children: *Lady Margaret Crichton-Stuart (24 December 1875 ‚Äì 6 June 1954) *John, 4th Marquess of Bute (20 June 1881 ‚Äì 16 May 1947) *Lord Ninian Edward Crichton- Stuart (15 May 1883 ‚Äì 2 October 1915) *Lord Colum Edmund Crichton-Stuart (3 April 1886 ‚Äì 18 August 1957) Works * via Project Gutenberg * via The Internet Archive Death Lord Bute died on 9 October 1900 after a protracted illness (Bright's disease), his first stroke having occurred in 1896, and was buried in a small chapel on the Isle of Bute, his ancestral home.

In his will he left ¬£100,000 to each of his children, with the exception of his eldest son, who inherited the Bute estates including Cardiff Castle and the family seat, Mount Stuart House on the Isle of Bute, and Dumfries House in Ayrshire.

The game, printed in black and white on pulp-like sepia paper to resemble a period piece, was conceived as a one-book game line, and was never supported by official supplements. Despite having a vocal fanbase, the Trinity Universe line was discontinued shortly after the game's publication; a d20 system version was released in 2004. In 2002, Adventure! won the Origins Award for Best Role-Playing Game of 2001. Onyx Path Publishing has recently acquired the rights to the Trinity Universe and has announced its intention to release a new edition of Adventure! Setting The game is set in the 1920s and therefore at the origin of the Trinity Universe timeline. The release of unknown Telluric energy has led to the appearance of a number of particularly gifted characters, whose actions have the potential for shaping the future history of the world. The Aeon Society for Gentlemen, founded by philanthropist Maxwell Mercer, is trying to bring together as many \\"Inspired\\" characters as possible, supporting and coordinating them in their effort for the betterment of all of humanity. But darkness lurks, and Mercer's champions will have to face it in the most unlikely locales. There are three archetypes (\\"character classes\\") for players to choose from: *Daredevils - whose only \\"powers\\" revolve around luck and incredible skill. *Mesmerists - the precursors to Trinity's Psions, masters of the powers of the mind. *Stalwarts - the precursors of Aberrant's Novas, capable of superhuman feats. Game system Set to emulate the exploits of Saturday matinee serials and pulp magazine action, Adventure! uses a very loose and flexible variant of the White Wolf proprietary Storyteller System. Adventure! adds significantly to the Storyteller System in three areas: Knacks, Inspiration and Super-Science. Knacks Knacks are powers that differentiate adventurers and villains from normal human beings. * Heroic powers enhance a human's natural ability, but don‚Äôt appear supernatural. Examples include Lightning Reflexes, Amazing Resilience or Eagle Eyes. * Psychic powers manipulate the mind and include telekinesis, telepathy and mind control. * Dynamic powers are more obvious superhero style powers including flight, exceptional strength and supernatural toughness. Inspiration Inspiration is used to activate knacks, alter the story significantly (either as an instantaneous feat or by altering a potential cliffhanger to better suit the player) increase the number of dice you roll for an action or gain intuitive knowledge to move the story along. There are three facets, and associated traits, to Inspiration, each with their own advantages: * Intuitive ‚Äì Quicker reactions and better mental agility. * Reflective ‚Äì Increased patience and bonuses to extended actions. * Destructive ‚Äì Additional damage and concept damage.

The title itself refers to the clear sky as seen from the surface of Mars, to the nearness of the Martian horizon because Mars is a much smaller planet, and to the abrupt absence/darkness of many overhead satellites that occurs at a key point in the story. The whole story takes place on Mars, which was first settled around 2030 in the timeframe of this series (see Barnes's novels Orbital Resonance and Kaleidoscope Century). This novel takes place in (the mid-to-late 2090s) when humans have settled en masse, in at least three large waves of settlement. Plot summary This story alternates between the point of view of Terpsichore Melpomene Murray (\\"Teri\\"), an ecoprospector who's approaching adulthood on Mars and seeks to follow in her father's footsteps, and the unnamed psychiatrist who is listening to her story. Several decades earlier, refugees from Earth fled to join a pre-existing human colony on Mars to escape the domination of One True, a massively parallel/cellular automata program that runs on the interconnected brains of most of the human beings on Earth; the program in the individual human brain is called Resuna, probably a contraction from the Latin for One Thing. If a human mind has a copy of Resuna, it may remain dormant until a human speaks the trigger phrase let overwrite, let override. The first half of the novel is mostly backstory in Teri's voice, leading up to the day when she passed her test for \\"full adulthood\\", a legal status that can apparently be reached at any age by passing an educational and psychiatric exam, which gives her the right to marry, hold property, vote, and so forth. Teri hopes to be an ecospector (eco- prospector) like her father Telemachus, living on the surface in a pressure suit most of the time; but because in the last generation the colonists decided to forgo terraforming Mars to suit human life and instead adapt humans to suit the Martian environment, the future of ecospecting doesn't look good to Telemachus; he thinks the future of Mars is with the \\"Nations\\" of Mars- formed humans. It's estimated that modifying people can be done in just two to three generations, whereas terraforming Mars might take thousands of years. Thus he wants her to get an advanced degree and go into some always-needed occupation like science or medicine. When they strike a \\"scorehole\\", a very large deposit of methane and water, their fortune seems assured, and Teri expects to marry the boy she has been courting; when it turns out he has married someone else, she grumpily agrees to one more year of school at least, and she and Telemachus take on the job of shepherding a group of younger children to the school at Red Sands City. While the party are in the roundings (the frontier, bush, or outback‚Äîpossibly from \\"surroundings\\" or \\"roundabouts\\"?) a major solar flare occurs, and because Mars' thin atmosphere and weak magnetic field provide less protection against high-energy particles than on Earth, this event overloads many electronics systems on Mars, as well as damaging the \\"exosuit\\" (space suit) systems of many people who are outdoors and otherwise unprotected, so that several members of the party are killed, including Telemachus. Furthermore, the GPS-like navigation system Teri has used all her life is permanently down. Teri and Alik, a boy in the party, re- invent celestial navigation and reach the nearest railhead, where there is a working phone, only to find that the disaster is planetwide and help will not be coming soon. Worse yet, a group of Marsform humans are stranded farther up the track and in danger of starving due to their ultrafast metabolisms. Despite her bigotry against the Nations, Teri tries to take food to them in a backpack, but collapses and breaks her leg. A mysterious voice on her suit radio soothes and comforts her, takes over her body, and causes her to wreck her body getting food to the Marsforms; she has been taken over by Resuna. We now learn why the psychiatrist himself has been listening to her story; they are recording it so she can have some idea of what happened in the big gaps he is going to create in her memory while erasing Resuna. He himself has had this process twice. Further, we learn that this is all information from the past, that in fact he has been re-infected with Resuna, and so has Teri, and that they will both lose all memory of each other and of the many events, including much of her last memories of her father. So although they have been close friends, in the last chapter they are re-introduced to each other for the first time. The novel ends with their working as ecospecting partners, as Mars rebuilds.

The first mention of Comacine masters was in an edict of 643 of the Lombard king Rothari, which concerned itself in Lombard fashion mainly with the indemnity that would be due should a house collapse which had been built by a magister comacinus for a patron ad opera dictandi (\\"commissioning the works\\").Nikolaus Pevsner, \\"Terms of Architectural Planning in the Middle Ages\\", Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 5 (1942), pp. 232-237 (p 236f). The reference has been interpreted as granting certain privileges to magistri comacini, but the context shows that modern readers are correct in interpreting the key word comacini simply as \\"masons\\". Comacini are also mentioned in a passage in the Memoratorium of Liutprand the Lombard. The survival of brotherhoods of the comacini are based on the hypothesisThis hypothesis of the unbroken tradition from Late Roman times was set forth in Giovanni Teresio Rivoira's Origini dell'architettura Lombarda, Rome, 1901, vol.1 and has been incorporated into the lore of Freemasonry. that the Roman secrets of masonry construction were never utterly lost in Italy but were passed on by the mason brotherhoods, which were supposed to be among the numerous documented collegii in which workingmen joined together for mutual protection, fraternal banqueting and eventual support of their widows throughout the Roman Empire, sometimes associated together as masters of the arcana or \\"mysteries\\" of their craft. Each such confraternity was composed of men (never women) located in a single town, and was made up of men of a single craft or those worshipping a single deity, free, freedmen and slaves together, forming a bond very like the image of a city, always under the uneasy surveillance of officialdom.Paul Veyne, \\"Confraternities\\" in A History of Private Life: From Pagan Rome to Byzantium (Cambridge:Belknap Press), 1987 pp 189-91. Such, it supposed, were the comacini whose geographical center in the Early Middle Ages originated in Lombardy, in Como and Pavia. If mason's marks were the sign of the comacini, then evidence of their work has been found in several parts of Europe, as far as the capitals of the crypt in the cathedral of Lund. The \\"Como-Pavian\\" architectural sculpture is recognized in the cathedral of Modena and its Torre della Ghirlandina,William Montorsi, La torre della Ghirlandina: Comacini e Campionesi a Modena. in centralThe Casa del Maestri Comacini is still shown to tourists in Assisi. and southern Italy, west across Languedoc to Iberian Peninsula, across southern Germany as far as Hungary, and even in England.Serra 1969:353. In the Middle Ages, artists did not customarily sign their work, so to detect the work of this corporation, historians look to masons' marks inscribed in the stonework; in this way historians have traced comacine master's influence as far as Sweden and Syria. Freemasons claimed descent from the guilds of comacini.According to H.L. Haywood and James E. Craig, A History of Freemasonry, the \\"Comacine masters\\" were reportedly the predecessors or \\"progenitors\\" of the Freemasons (Freemasonry: \\"Comacini\\") The efflorescence of a \\"Como-Pavian\\" school of sculptural decoration on pulpits and portals that surfaced in the area of Como in the late eleventh century and developed luxuriously to enrich facades in Pavia in the 1130s, then were disseminated more widely in the twelfth and thirteenth century, doubtless by travelling groups of artisans, is traditionally ascribed to a surfacing of a long-buried tradition of comacini sculptors, who were influenced by the animal interlaces of Lombard metalwork.Francovich 1937:51 In this corrente comasca that spread on the periphery of Romanesque and Early Gothic art, geometric interlaces are peopled with sleek monsters and figures that seem to synthesize some very disparate and distant influences: barbaric Longobard metalwork, Ottonian illuminations, Byzantine silk patterns, Islamic patterning, Coptic reliefs, have all been compared to the \\"Como-Pavian\\" current of sculpture.Joselita Raspi Serra, \\"English Decorative Sculpture of the Early Twelfth Century and the Como-Pavian Tradition\\", The Art Bulletin 51.4 (December 1969), pp 352-362. Another notable group of medieval stoneworkers were maestri Campionesi from Campione, not far from Como.

He was the son of Ahab and Jezebel, and brother to Ahaziah and Athaliah. According to 2 Kings, 2 Kings 8:16, in the fifth year of Jehoram of Israel, (another) Jehoram became king of Judah. The author of Kings speaks of both Jehoram of Israel and Jehoram of Judah in the same passage. Reign Jehoram began to reign in Israel in the 18th year of Jehoshaphat of Judah, and ruled 12 years (2 Kings 3:1). William F. Albright dated his reign to 849‚Äì842 BCE, whereas E. R. Thiele proposed 852‚Äì841 BCE.Edwin Thiele, The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings, (1st ed.; New York: Macmillan, 1951; 2d ed.; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1965; 3rd ed.; Grand Rapids: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983). , 9780825438257 Unlike his predecessors, Jehoram did not worship Ba'al, and he removed the pillar of Baal, probably a special pillar which Ahab had erected near his palace at Jezreel for his own and Jezebel‚Äôs worship.Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on 2 Kings 3, accessed 20 December 2017 However, the writer of 2 Kings says that he still \\"followed in the ways of Jeroboam, son of Nebat, who led the Israelites to sin\\". With Jehoshaphat of Judah, Jehoram attacked Mesha, King of the Moabites. In the war between Aram-Damascus and Israel, Elisha befriended Joram, revealing to him the plans of the enemy. Subsequently, when Ben-hadad besieged Samaria, reducing the city almost to starvation and cannibalism, Jehoram sought to behead the prophet. The latter, however, foretold that a period of plenty was imminent; the siege was soon lifted, the city's food supplies were replenished, and the old relation between the king and the prophet was restored.\\"Jehoram\\", Jewish Encyclopedia When Hazael, king of the Arameans, violently revolted in Damascus, as Elisha had predicted (), Jehoram made an alliance with his nephew Ahaziah, King of Judah. The two kings set forth to take Ramoth-gilead from Aram. The battle failed; Jehoram was wounded in the fighting, and he withdrew to Jezreel to recover. It is likely that his defeat at Ramoth-Gilead was a disaster. As a result, while Jehoram was recuperating at Jezreel, his general, Jehu, incited a revolt. Jehu executed Jehoram by shooting him in the back with an arrow, and had his body thrown into the field of Naboth the Jezreelite, as punishment for his parents' sin in illegally stealing Naboth's land. With the death of Jehoram and his other family members, the Ahab Dynasty came to an end. Jehu claimed the throne of Israel as his own. Archeology The author of the Tel Dan Stele claimed to have slain both Ahaziah and Jehoram. Hazael is the most likely to have written it.

However, members of Cephalotaxaceae are now included in Taxaceae by botanists, instead of as a distinct family, based on phylogenetic evidence and close morphological similarities between them. Included species were restricted to east Asia, except for two species of Torreya found in the southwest and southeast of the United States; fossil evidence shows a much wider prehistorical Northern Hemisphere distribution. The most notable differences between Taxaceae and Cephalotaxaceae concerned the cone aril, which fully encloses the seeds of Cephalotaxaceae, the longer maturation of Cephalotaxaceae seeds and the larger size of the mature seeds. When considered as a distinct family, members of Cephalotaxaceae are much branched, small trees and shrubs. The leaves are evergreen, spirally arranged, often twisted at the base to appear biranked. They are linear to lanceolate, and have pale green or white stomatal bands on the undersides. The plants are monoecious, subdioecious, or dioecious. The male cones are 4‚Äì25 mm long, and shed pollen in the early spring. The female cones are reduced, with one to a few ovuliferous scales, and one seed on each ovuliferous scale. As the seed matures, the ovuliferous scale develops into a fleshy aril fully enclosing the seed. The mature aril is thin, green, purple or red, soft and resinous. Each ovuliferous scale remains discrete, so the cone develops into a short stem with one to a few berry-like seeds. They are probably eaten by birds or other animals which then disperse the hard seed undamaged in their droppings, but seed dispersal mechanisms in the family are not yet well researched.

Jehoram took the throne at the age of 32 and reigned for 8 years (, ), although he was ill during his last two years (). Name The name Jehoram is confusing in the biblical account. The author of Kings speaks of both Jehoram of Israel and Jehoram of Judah in the same passage, and both reigned at the same time. Both Jehorams are also referred to as Joram, even in the same translation in the same breath. For example, reads: :5 He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-gilead; and the Arameans wounded Joram. :6 And he returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which they had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Aram. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick. Likewise, the king of Judah is referred to as Jehoram or Joram in a single translation. For example, uses the name Joram while , which describe the same event in almost identical words, uses the name Jehoram. Reign According to , Jehoram became king of Judah in the fifth year of Jehoram of Israel, when his father Jehoshaphat was (still) king of Judah, indicating a co-regency. Jehoram took the throne at the age of 32 and reigned for 8 years. To secure his position Jehoram killed his six brothers,Jewish Encyclopedia, \\"Jehoram\\" who were named as Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azaryahu, Michael, and Shephatiah in . His father, Jehoshaphat, had formed an alliance with the Kingdom of Israel, and one of the terms of this alliance was that Jehoram married Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab. Despite this alliance with the stronger northern kingdom, Jehoram's rule of Judah was shaky. Edom, then ruled by a viceroy of the king of Judah,Benson, J., Benson's Commentary on 1 Kings 22, accessed 8 May 2020 revolted, and when Jehoram marched against this people, his army fled before the Edomites, and he was forced to acknowledge their independence.Platts, John. A New Universal Biography, Vol.I, p.156, Sherwood, Jones and Co., 1825 The town of Libnah revolted during his reign, according to , because he \\"had abandoned Yahweh, God of his fathers\\". During his reign a raid by Philistines, Arabs and Ethiopians looted the king's house, and carried off all of his family except for his youngest son Jehoahaz. () During this time the king received a letter of warning from the prophet Elijah. After this, Jehoram suffered a painful inflammation of the abdomen, and he died two years later (). Chronological notes William F. Albright has dated his reign to 849 ‚Äì 842 BCE. Edwin Thiele placed a coregency of Jehoram with his father Jehoshaphat, starting in 853/852 BCE, with the beginning of his sole reign occurring in 848/847 and his death in 841/840 BCE.Edwin Thiele, The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings, (1st ed.; New York: Macmillan, 1951; 2d ed.; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1965; 3rd ed.; Grand Rapids: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983). , 9780825438257. 97, 99-101. As explained in the Rehoboam article, Thiele's chronology for the first kings of Judah contained an internal inconsistency that later scholars corrected by dating these kings one year earlier, so that Jehoram's dates are taken as one year earlier in the present article: coregency beginning in 854/853, sole reign commencing in 849/848, and death in 842/841 BCE. The calendars for reckoning the years of kings in Judah and Israel were offset by six months, that of Judah starting in Tishri (in the fall) and that of Israel in Nisan (in the spring). Cross-synchronizations between the two kingdoms therefore often allow narrowing of the beginning and/or ending dates of a king to within a six-month range. For Jehoram, the Scriptural data allow the narrowing of the first year of his sole reign to some time between Nisan 1 of 848 BCE and the day before Tishri 1 of the same BCE year. For calculation purposes, this should be taken as the Judean year beginning in Tishri of 849/848 BCE, or more simply 849 BC. His death occurred at some time between Nisan 1 and the day before Tishri 1 of 841 BCE, i.e. in 842/841 BCE according to the Judean calendar. For calculation purposes this can be written in the simpler form 842 BCE, even though Jehoram's death occurred in the next BCE year. This potential confusion is because of expressing dates in a January-based (Roman) calendar; a better notation would be something like 842t, the \\"t\\" standing for Tishri, indicating that the year crossed over into the two years 842 and 841 of the modern calendar.A proposal for this kind of notation was advocated by Rodger C. Young, \\"When Did Solomon Die?\\" Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society 46 (2003) 591. Young used a small \\"n\\" after the year when designating a Nisan-based year, such as was used in the northern kingdom. Unaware of Young's previous work but also seeing the need for an unambiguous notation, Daiqing Yuan proposed an identical convention to remove ambiguity and to be consistent with the chronological methods used by the ancient scribes, except that Yuan capitalized the \\"n\\" and the \\"t\\" (Daiqing Apollos Yuan, \\"A Proposed Chronology for Judges,\\" unpublished ThM. thesis, Dallas Theological Seminary, Dallas, TX, 2006, v). Dates in the present article are one year earlier than those given in the third edition of Thiele's The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings, thereby correcting an internal consistency that Thiele never resolved, as explained in the Rehoboam article. Thiele showed that for the reign of Jehoram, Judah adopted Israel's non-accession method of counting the years of reign, meaning that the first partial year of the king's reign was counted as his first full year, in contrast to the \\"accession\\" method previously in use whereby the first partial year was counted as year \\"zero\\", and \\"year one\\" was assigned to the first full year of reign. Thiele attributed this change to the rapprochement between Judah and Israel, whereby Jehoshaphat, Jehoram's father, made common cause with Ahab at the battle of Ramoth-Gilead, and chose a daughter for his son from the house of Ahab (1 Kings 22:1‚Äì38, 2 Kings 8:18).Thiele, Mysterious Numbers\\" 58. This convention was followed in Judah for the next three monarchs: Ahaziah, Athaliah, and Jehoash, returning to Judah's original accession reckoning in the time of Amaziah. These changes can be inferred from a careful comparison of the textual data in the Scripture, but because the Scriptural texts do not state explicitly whether the reckoning was by accession or non-accession counting, nor do they indicate explicitly when a change was made in the method, many have criticized Thiele's chronology as being entirely arbitrary in its assignment of accession and non-accession reckoning. The arbitrariness, however, apparently rested with the ancient kings and their court recorders, not with Thiele. The official records of Tiglath-Pileser III show that he switched (arbitrarily) to non-accession reckoning for his reign, in contrast with the accession method used for previous kings of Assyria.Hayim Tadmor, The Inscriptions of Tiglath-Pileser III, King of Assyria (Jerusalem: Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, 1994) 232, n.3. Tiglath-Pileser left no record explaining to modern historians which kind of method he was using, nor that he was switching from the method used by his predecessors; all of this is determined by a careful comparison of the relevant texts by Assyriologists, the same as Thiele did for the regnal data of Judah and Israel.

Power strips are often used when many electrical devices are in proximity, such as for audio, video, computer systems, appliances, power tools, and lighting. Power strips often include a circuit breaker to interrupt the electric current in case of an overload or a short circuit. Some power strips provide protection against electrical power surges. Typical housing styles include strip, rack-mount, under-monitor and direct plug-in.  Control  Illuminated power switch on a power strip German master-slave remote controlled power strip Some power strips include a master switch to turn all devices on and off. This can be used with simple devices, such as lights, but not with most computers, which must use shutdown commands from the software. Computers may have open files, which may be damaged if the power is simply turned off. Some power strips have individually switched outlets. \\"Master/slave\\" strips can detect one \\"master\\" device being turned off (such as the PC itself in a computer setup, or a TV in a home theatre) and turn everything else on or off accordingly. Remote control strips are used in data centers, to allow computer systems or other devices to be remotely restarted, often over the Internet (although this leaves them vulnerable to outside attacks).  Indication  Many power strips have a neon or LED indicator light or one per output socket to show when power is on. Better-quality surge- protected strips have additional lights to indicate the status of the surge protection system, however these are not always reliable as an indicator.  Energy-saving features and standby power  Some power strips have energy- saving features, which switch off the strip if appliances go into standby mode. Using a sensor circuit, they detect if the level of power through the socket is in standby mode (less than 30 watts), and if so they will turn off that socket. This reduces the consumption of standby power used by computer peripherals and other equipment when not in use, saving money and energy Some more-sophisticated power strips have a master and slave socket arrangement, and when the \\"master\\" socket detects standby mode in the attached appliance's current it turns off the whole strip. However, there can be problems detecting standby power in appliances that use more power in standby mode (such as plasma televisions) as they will always appear to the power strip to be switched on. When using a master‚Äìslave power strip, one way to avoid such problems is to plug an appliance with a lower standby wattage (such as a DVD player) into the master socket, using it as the master control instead. A different power strip design intended to save energy uses a passive infrared (PIR) or ultrasonic sound detector to determine if a person is nearby. If the sensors don't detect any motion for a preset period of time, the strip shuts off several outlets, while leaving one outlet on for devices that should not be powered off. These so-called \\"smart power strips\\" are intended to be installed in offices, to shut down equipment when the office is unoccupied. It is recommended that appliances that need a controlled shutdown sequence (such as many ink-jet printers) not be plugged into a slave socket on such a strip as it can damage them if they are switched off incorrectly (for example the inkjet printer may not have capped the print head in time, and consequently the ink will dry and clog the print head.) Within Europe, power strips with energy-saving features are within the scope of the Low Voltage Directive 2006/95/EC and the EMC Directive 2004/108/EC and require a CE mark.  Socket arrangement  Italian power strip with two different types of socket In some countries where multiple socket types are in use, a single power strip can have two or more kinds of sockets. Socket arrangement varies considerably, but for physical access reasons there are rarely more than two rows. In Europe, power strips without surge suppression are normally single row, but models with surge suppression are supplied both in single and double row configurations. If sockets on a power strip are grouped closely together, a cable with a large \\"wall wart\\" transformer at its end may cover up multiple sockets. Various designs address this problem, some by simply increasing the spacing between outlets. Other designs include receptacles which rotate in their housing, or multiple short receptacle cords feeding from a central hub. A simple DIY method for adapting problematic power strips arrangements to large \\"wall warts\\" is to use a three-way socket adapter to extend the socket above its neighbors, providing the required clearance. The PowerCube adapter is arranged as a cube, meaning the adapters do not fight for space next to each other.  Surge protection and filtering  Schuko surge protected power strip (this model is unlikely to incorporate an inductor-capacitor network, due to lack of internal physical space) Many power strips have built-in surge protectors or EMI/RFI filters: these are sometimes described as surge suppressors or electrical line conditioners. Some also provide surge suppression for phone lines, TV cable coax, or network cable. Unprotected power strips are often mistakenly called \\"surge suppressors\\" or \\"surge protectors\\" even though they may have no ability to suppress surges. Surge suppression is usually provided by one or more metal-oxide varistors (MOVs), which are inexpensive two-terminal semiconductors. These act as very high speed switches, momentarily limiting the peak voltage across their terminals. By design, MOV surge limiters are selected to trigger at a voltage somewhat above the local mains supply voltage, so that they do not clip normal voltage peaks, but clip abnormal higher voltages. In the US, this is (nominally) 120 VAC. It should be borne in mind that this voltage specification is RMS, not peak, and also that it is only a nominal (approximate) value. Mains electrical power circuits are generally grounded (earthed), so there will be a live (hot) wire, a neutral wire, and a ground wire. Low-cost power strips often come with only one MOV mounted between the live and neutral wires. More complete (and desirable) power strips will have three MOVs, connected between each possible pair of wires. Since MOVs degrade somewhat each time they are triggered, power strips using them have a limited, and unpredictable, protective life. Some power strips have \\"protection status\\" lights which are designed to turn off if protective MOVs connected to the live wire have failed, but such simple circuits cannot detect all failure modes (such as failure of a MOV connected between neutral and ground). The surge-induced triggering of MOVs can cause damage to an upstream device, such as an uninterruptible power supply (UPS), which typically sees an overload condition while the surge is being suppressed. Therefore, it is recommended not to connect a surge-protected power strip to a UPS, but instead to rely solely on surge protection provided by the UPS itself. More-elaborate power strips may use inductor-capacitor networks to achieve a similar effect of protecting equipment from high voltage spikes on the mains circuit. These more-expensive arrangements are much less prone to silent degradation than MOVs, and often have monitoring lights that indicate whether the protective circuitry is still connected. In the European Union, power strips with surge suppression circuits can demonstrate compliance with the (LVD) Low Voltage Directive 2006/95/EC by complying with the requirements of EN 61643-11:2002+A1. The standard covers both the performance of the surge suppression circuit and their safety. Likewise, power strips with telecoms surge suppression circuits can demonstrate compliance with the LVD by complying with the requirements of EN 61643-21:2001.  Daisy chaining and surge protection  North American surge suppressor power strip with separate protection status indicator lights Connecting MOV-protected power strips in a \\"daisy chain\\" (in a series, with each power strip plugged into a previous one in the chain) does not necessarily increase the protection they provide. Connecting them in this manner effectively connects their surge protection components in parallel, in theory spreading any potential surge across each surge protector. However, due to manufacturing variations between the MOVs, the surge energy will not be spread evenly, and will typically go through the one that triggers first. Daisy chaining of power strips (known in building and electric codes as multi-plug adapters or relocatable power taps), whether surge protected or not, is specifically against most codes. As an example, the International Code Council's International Fire Code 2009 Edition in 605.4.2 states, \\"Relocatable power taps shall be directly connected to permanently installed receptacles.\\"  Overload protection  Where the current rating of the socket outlet, plug and lead of the power strip is equal to the rating of the circuit breaker supplying the circuit concerned, additional overload protection for the power strip is unnecessary, since the existing circuit breaker will provide the required protection. However, where the rating of a socket outlet (and, hence, the plug and lead of the power strip) is less than the rating of the circuit breaker supplying the circuit concerned, overload protection for the power strip and its supply cable is necessary. In the UK, standard BS 1363 plugs and sockets are rated at 13 A but are provided on circuits protected by circuit breakers of up to 32 A. However, UK Consumer Protection legislation requires that plug-in domestic electrical goods must be provided with plugs to BS 1363, which include a fuse rated at not more than 13 A. Hence, in the UK and in other countries using BS 1363 plugs, this fused plug provides overload protection for any power strip. The fuse must be replaced if the power strip is overloaded, causing the fuse to operate. Australian/NZ 10 A, 6 Outlet Power Board, with resettable overload protection In Australia and New Zealand the rating for a standard socket outlet is 10 Amperes but these outlets are provided on circuits usually protected by circuit breakers of 16 or 20 A capacity. Also, it is possible to insert an Australian/NZ 10 A plug into socket outlets rated at up to 32 A. Hence, all power strips sold in Australia and New Zealand with three or more 10A socket outlets are required to have overload protection so that if the total current drawn exceeds 10 A the inbuilt circuit breaker will operate and disconnect all connected devices. These power strips have a reset button for the circuit breaker, which is used to return the strip to service after an overload has caused it to trip.  Safety  Multiple power strips and AC adapters Electrical overloading can be a problem with any sort of power distribution adapter. This is especially likely if multiple high-power appliances are used, such as those with heating elements, like room heaters or electric frying pans. Power strips may have a circuit breaker integrated to prevent overload. In the UK, power strips are required to be protected by the fuse in the BS 1363 plug. Some also feature a 13A BS1362 fuse in the socket end. Power strips are generally considered a safer alternative to ‚Äúdouble adapters‚Äù, ‚Äútwo-way plugs‚Äù, ‚Äúthree-way plugs‚Äù, or ‚Äúcube taps‚Äù which plug directly into the socket with no lead for multiple appliances. These low-cost adapters are generally not fused (although more modern ones in the UK and Ireland are). Therefore, in many cases the only protection against overload is the branch circuit fuse which may well have a rating higher than the adapter. The weight of the plugs pulling on the adapter (and often pulling it part way out of the socket) can also be a problem if adapters are stacked or if they are used with brick-style power supplies. Such adapters, while still available, have largely fallen out of use in some countries (although two- and three-way adapters are still common in the US, UK, and Ireland). When plugging a device into a power strip, a buildup of carbon or dust can cause sparking to occur. This generally doesn‚Äôt pose much of a risk in a non-explosive atmosphere, but explosive atmospheres (for example, near a gasoline refueling station or a solvent cleaning facility) require specialized explosion-proof sealed electrical equipment.  US regulations  US power strip with switch * Underwriters Laboratories standard 1363 contains requirements for relocatable power taps. Included in the scope section of the standard is the statement: * National Electrical Code recognizes power strip as Multioutlet Assembly in Article 380.  EU and UK regulations  British power strip with neon indicator In Europe, plugs and sockets without additional control or surge protection circuits are outside the scope of the Low Voltage Directive 2006/95/EC and controlled by National regulations, and therefore must not be CE marked. In the UK the legal requirements for plugs and sockets are listed in Statutory Instrument 1994 No. 1768, The Plugs and Sockets etc. (Safety) Regulations 1994. This regulation lists the requirements for all domestic plugs and sockets; including socket outlet units (power strips), see Electrical Equipment - Requirements for Plugs & Sockets etc. - Guidance notes on the UK Plugs & Sockets etc. (Safety) Regulations 1994 (S.I. 1994/1768). The regulation requires all socket outlet units to comply with the requirements of BS 1363-2 Specification for 13A switched and unswitched socket-outlets and with the requirements of BS 5733 Specification for General requirements for electrical accessories. Sockets and socket outlets do not require independent approval under the regulations. Any plug fitted to the socket outlet unit must comply with the requirements of BS 1363-1 Specification for rewirable and non- rewirable 13A fused plugs. Plugs must also be independently approved and marked in accordance with the requirements of the regulation. If a socket outlet unit contains additional control circuits or surge protection circuits they will fall within the scope of the Low Voltage Directive 2006/95/EC and must be CE marked. Socket outlet units with control circuits also fall within the scope of the EMC Directive 2004/108/EC.  History  Australian / New Zealand power board with individual switches Examples of power strips exist in the U.S. patent system dating back as far as 1929, starting with the creation of Carl M. Peterson's \\"Table Tap\\". Another early example was created by Allied Electric Products in 1950. Perhaps the first modern designs for the power strip were created by the U.S. firm Fedtro, which filed two patents in 1970 for designs that hew close to designs used in the modern day. One early iteration, called a \\"power board\\", was invented in 1972 by Australian electrical engineer Peter Talbot working under Frank Bannigan, Managing Director of Australian company Kambrook. The product was hugely successful, however, it was not patented and market share was eventually lost to other manufacturers.\\"Powerful patents\\", 17 Sep 2012, IP Australia.

Eckenwalder. 2009. Conifers of the World. Portland, Oregon: Timber Press. . It contains 19 genera if Phyllocladus is included and if Manoao and Sundacarpus are recognized. The family is a classic member of the Antarctic flora, with its main centres of diversity in Australasia, particularly New Caledonia, Tasmania, and New Zealand, and to a slightly lesser extent Malesia and South America (primarily in the Andes mountains). Several genera extend north of the equator into Indochina and the Philippines. Podocarpus reaches as far north as southern Japan and southern China in Asia, and Mexico in the Americas, and Nageia into southern China and southern India. Two genera also occur in sub- Saharan Africa, the widespread Podocarpus and the endemic Afrocarpus. Parasitaxus usta is unique as the only known parasitic gymnosperm. It occurs on New Caledonia, where it is parasitic on another member of the Podocarpaceae, Falcatifolium taxoides.William T. Sinclair, R. R. Mill, M. F. Gardner, P. Woltz, T. Jaffr√©, J. Preston, M.

Members occur mainly in the Southern Hemisphere, with most generic variety taking place in New Caledonia, New Zealand, and Tasmania. Species diversity of Podocarpus is found mainly in South America and the Indonesian islands, the latter also being rich in Dacrydium and Dacrycarpus species. Podocarpus (with 82 to 100 species)Christopher N. Page. 1990. \\"Podocarpaceae\\" pages 332‚Äì346. In: Klaus Kubitzki (general editor); Karl U. Kramer and Peter S.

A few genera are common to New Zealand and South America, supporting the view that podocarps had an extensive distribution over southern Gondwanaland. The breaking up of Gondwanaland led to large-scale speciation of Podocarpaceae. Until 1970, only seven Podocarpaceae genera were recognized: Podocarpus, Dacrydium, Phyllocladus, Acmopyle, Microcachrys, Saxegothaea, and Pherosphaera. All four of the African species fell under Podocarpus ‚Äì P. falcatus, P. elongatus, P. henkelii, and P. latifolius. Taxonomists divided Podocarpus species into eight species groups based on leaf anatomy: Afrocarpus J.Buchholz & N.E.Gray, Dacrycarpus Endl., Eupodocarpus Endl., Microcarpus Pilg., Nageia (Gaertn.) Endl., Polypodiopsis C.E.Bertrand (non Polypodiopsis Carri√©re nom. rej. prop. 6), Stachycarpus Endl. and Sundacarpus J.Buchholz and N.E.Gray. Studies of embryology, gametophyte development, female cone structure, and cytology led to the belief that the eight categories probably deserved generic status. Researchers agreed on the need to recognize \\"fairly natural groupings which prove to have good geographic and probably evolutionary cohesion\\" and took the necessary steps to raise each section to generic status.Barker, N. P.; Muller, E. M.; and Mill, R. R. (2004). \\"A yellowwood by any other name: molecular systematics and the taxonomy of Podocarpus and the Podocarpaceae in southern Africa\\" . South African Journal of Science, 100: 629‚Äì632. In 1990, a treatment of the Podocarpaceae recognized 17 genera, excluding Phyllocladus from the family, while recognizing Sundacarpus, but not Manoao. In 1995, Manoao was segregated from Lagarostrobus, based on morphological characters.Brian P. J. Molloy. 1995. \\"Manoao (Podocarpaceae), a new monotypic conifer genus endemic to New Zealand\\". New Zealand Journal of Botany 33 (2): 183‚Äì201. In 2002, a molecular phylogenetic study showed Sundacarpus is embedded in Prumnopitys and the monophyly of Lagarostrobos is doubtful if Manoao is included within it. More recent treatments of the family have recognized Manoao, but not Sundacarpus.Aljos Farjon. 2008. A Natural History of Conifers. Portland, Oregon: Timber Press.

Species occur mainly in New Zealand, Tasmania, and Malesia in the Southern Hemisphere, though P. hypophyllus ranges into the Philippines, a short way north of the equator. Characteristics They are small to medium-sized trees, reaching 10‚Äì30 m tall, or sometimes small shrubs. The main structural shoots are green for 2‚Äì3 years, then turn brown as the bark thickens. The leaves are sparse, tiny, scale-like, 2‚Äì3 mm long, and only green (photosynthetic) for a short time, soon turning brown. Most photosynthesis is performed by highly modified, leaf- like short shoots called phylloclades; these develop in the axils of the scale leaves, and are simple or compound (depending on species). Simple phylloclades are rhombic, 2‚Äì5 cm long, and compound phylloclades are up to 20 cm long and subdivided into five to 15 leaflet-like phylloclades 1‚Äì3 cm long. The seed cones are berry-like, similar to those of several other Podocarpaceae genera, notably Halocarpus and Prumnopitys, with a fleshy white aril; the seeds are dispersed by birds, which digest the soft, fleshy aril as they pass the hard seeds in their droppings.

Microfossils  Diatomaceous earth is a soft, siliceous, sedimentary rock made up of microfossils in the form of the frustules (shells) of single cell diatoms. This sample consists of a mixture of centric (radially symmetric) and pennate (bilaterally symmetric) diatoms. This image of diatomaceous earth particles in water is at a scale of 6.236 pixels/Œºm, the entire image covers a region of approximately 1.13 by 0.69 mm. Microfossils are fossils that are generally between 0.001mm and 1 mm in size, the study of which requires the use of light or electron microscopy. Fossils which can be studied with the naked eye or low-powered magnification, such as a hand lens, are referred to as macrofossils. For example, some colonial organisms, such as Bryozoa (especially the Cheilostomata) have relatively large colonies, but are classified by fine skeletal details of the small individuals of the colony. In another example, many fossil genera of Foraminifera, which are protists are known from shells (called \\"tests\\") that were as big as coins, such as the genus Nummulites. Microfossils are a common feature of the geological record, from the Precambrian to the Holocene. They are most common in deposits of marine environments, but also occur in brackish water, fresh water and terrestrial sedimentary deposits. While every kingdom of life is represented in the microfossil record, the most abundant forms are protist skeletons or cysts from the Chrysophyta, Pyrrhophyta, Sarcodina, acritarchs and chitinozoans, together with pollen and spores from the vascular plants. In 2017, fossilized microorganisms, or microfossils, were announced to have been discovered in hydrothermal vent precipitates in the Nuvvuagittuq Belt of Quebec, Canada that may be as old as 4.28 billion years old, the oldest record of life on Earth, suggesting \\"an almost instantaneous emergence of life\\" (in a geological time-scale sense), after ocean formation 4.41 billion years ago, and not long after the formation of the Earth 4.54 billion years ago. Nonetheless, life may have started even earlier, at nearly 4.5 billion years ago, as claimed by some researchers.  Areas of study  Fusulinid (Triticites) from the Plattsmouth Chert, Red Oak, Iowa (Permian). Micropaleontology can be roughly divided into four areas of study on the basis of microfossil composition: (a) calcareous, as in coccoliths and foraminifera, (b) phosphatic, as in the study of some vertebrates, (c) siliceous, as in diatoms and radiolaria, or (d) organic, as in the pollen and spores studied in palynology. This division reflects differences in the mineralogical and chemical composition of microfossil remains (and therefore in the methods of fossil recovery) rather than any strict taxonomic or ecological distinctions. Most researchers in this field, known as micropaleontologists, are typically specialists in one or more taxonomic groups.  Calcareous microfossils  nummulitid foraminiferans showing microspheric and megalospheric individuals; Eocene of the United Arab Emirates; scale in mm. Calcareous (CaCO3) microfossils include coccoliths, foraminifera, calcareous dinoflagellate cysts, and ostracods (seed shrimp).  Phosphatic microfossils  Phosphatic microfossils include conodonts (tiny oral structures of an extinct chordate group), some scolecodonts (\\"worm\\" jaws), Shark spines and teeth, and other Fish remains (collectively called \\"ichthyoliths\\").  Siliceous microfossils  Siliceous microfossils include diatoms, radiolarians, silicoflagellates, ebridians, phytoliths, some scolecodonts (\\"worm\\" jaws), and sponge spicules.  Organic microfossils  The study of organic microfossils is called palynology. Organic microfossils include pollen, spores, chitinozoans (thought to be the egg cases of marine invertebrates), scolecodonts (\\"worm\\" jaws), acritarchs, dinoflagellate cysts, and fungal remains.  Methods  Sediment or rock samples are collected from either cores or outcrops, and the microfossils they contain are extracted by a variety of physical and chemical laboratory techniques, including sieving, density separation by centrifuge or in heavy liquids, and chemical digestion of the unwanted fraction. The resulting concentrated sample of microfossils is then mounted on a slide for analysis, usually by light microscope. Taxa are then identified and counted. The enormous numbers of microfossils that a small sediment sample can often yield allows the collection of statistically robust datasets which can be subjected to multivariate analysis. A typical microfossil study will involve identification of a few hundred specimens from each sample.  Application of micropaleontology  Microfossils are specially noteworthy for their importance in biostratigraphy. Since microfossils are often extremely abundant, widespread, and quick to appear and disappear from the stratigraphic record, they constitute ideal index fossils from a biostratigraphic perspective. Also, the planktonic and nektonic habits of some microfossils give them the bonus of appearing across a wide range of facies or paleoenvironments, as well as having near-global distribution, making biostratigraphic correlation even more powerful and effective. Microfossils, particularly from deep-sea sediments, also provide some of the most important records of global environmental change on long, medium or short timescales.Ovechkina, M.N. 2007. Calcareous nannoplankton of the Upper Cretaceous (Campanian and Maastrichtian) of the southern and eastern Russian Platform. Nauka, Moscow. 353 pp. Across vast areas of the ocean floor, the shells of planktonic micro-organisms sinking from surface waters provide the dominant source of sediment, and they continuously accumulate (typically at rates of 20‚Äì50 million per million years). Study of changes in assemblages of microfossils and changes in their shell chemistry (e.g., oxygen isotope composition) are fundamental to research on climate change in the geological past. In addition to providing an excellent tool for sedimentary rock dating and for paleoenvironmental reconstruction ‚Äì heavily used in both petroleum geology and paleoceanography ‚Äì micropaleontology has also found a number of less orthodox applications, such as its growing role in forensic police investigation or in determining the provenance of archaeological artefacts. Micropaleontology is also a tool of geoarchaeology used in the archaeological reconstruction of human habitation sites and environments. Changes in the microfossil population abundance in the stratigraphy of current and former water bodies reflect changes in environmental conditions. Naturally occurring ostracods in freshwater bodies are impacted by changes in salinity and pH due to human activities. When correlated with other dating techniques, prehistoric environments can be reconstructed. Work on Lake Tanganyika provided a profile of human-induced environmental changes of a 4,000-year period. Similar work in the arid American Southwest has provided information on irrigation canals used by prehistoric peoples from 2100 B.C. to 500 B.C. Other archaeological work in arid climates throughout the Americas has incorporated Micropaleontological analysis to build a more complete picture of prehistoric climate and human activity.

As a discipline, paleoecology interacts with, depends on and informs a variety of fields including paleontology, ecology, climatology and biology. Paleoecology emerged from the field of paleontology in the 1950s, though paleontologists have conducted paleoecological studies since the creation of paleontology in the 1700s and 1800s. Combining the investigative approach of searching for fossils with the theoretical approach of Charles Darwin and Alexander von Humboldt, paleoecology began as paleontologists began examining both the ancient organisms they discovered and the reconstructed environments in which they lived. Visual depictions of past marine and terrestrial communities has been considered an early form of paleoecology.  Overview of paleoecological approaches  * Classic paleoecology uses data from fossils and subfossils to reconstruct the ecosystems of the past. It involves the study of fossil organisms and their associated remains (such as shells, teeth, pollen, and seeds), which can help in the interpretation of their life cycle, living interactions, natural environment, communities, and manner of death and burial. Such interpretations aid the reconstruction of past environments (i.e., paleoenvironments). Paleoecologists have studied the fossil record to try to clarify the relationship animals have to their environment, in part to help understand the current state of biodiversity. They have identified close links between vertebrate taxonomic and ecological diversity, that is, between the diversity of animals and the niches they occupy. Classical paleoecology is a primarily reductionist approach: scientists conduct detailed analysis of relatively small groups of organisms within shorter geologic timeframes. * Evolutionary paleoecology uses data from fossils and other evidence to examine how organisms and their environments change throughout time. Evolutionary paleoecologists take the holistic approach of looking at both organism and environmental change, accounting for physical and chemical changes in the atmosphere, lithosphere and hydrosphere across time. By studying patterns of evolution and extinction in the context of environmental change, evolutionary paleoecologists are able to examine concepts of vulnerability and resilience in species and environments. * Community paleoecology uses statistical analysis to examine the composition and distribution of groups of plants or animals. By quantifying how plants or animals are associated, community paleoecologists are able to investigate the structures of ancient communities of organisms. Advances in technology have helped propel the field, through the use of physical models and computer-based analysis.  Major principles  While the functions and relationships of fossil organisms may not be observed directly (as in ecology), scientists can describe and analyze both individuals and communities over time. To do so, paleoecologists make the following assumptions: *All organisms are adapted and restricted to a particular environment, and are usually adapted to a particular lifestyle. *Essentially all organisms depend on another organism, whether directly or indirectly. *The fossil or physical records are inherently incomplete - the geologic record is selective and some environments are more likely to be preserved than others. Taphonomy, affecting the over- and underrepresentation of fossils, is an extremely important consideration in interpreting fossil assemblages. *Uniformitarianism is the concept that processes that took place in the geologic past are the same as the ones that are observed taking place today. In paleoecology, uniformitarianism is used as a methodology: paleoecologists make inferences about ancient organisms and environments based on analogies they find in the present. Paleoecological methods Zygospira modesta, atrypid brachiopods, preserved in their original positions on a trepostome bryozoan; Cincinnatian (Upper Ordovician) of southeastern Indiana The aim of paleoecology is to build the most detailed model possible of the life environment of previously living organisms found today as fossils. The process of reconstructing past environments requires the use of archives (e.g., sediment sequences), proxies (e.g., the micro or mega- fossils and other sediment characteristics that provide the evidence of the biota and the physical environment), and chronology (e.g., obtaining absolute (or relative) dating of events in the archive). Such reconstruction takes into consideration complex interactions among environmental factors such as temperatures, food supplies, and degree of solar illumination. Often much of this information is lost or distorted by the fossilization process or diagenesis of the enclosing sediments, making interpretation difficult. Some other proxies for reconstructing past environments include charcoal and pollen, which synthesize fire and vegetation data, respectively. Both of these alternates can be found in lakes and peat settings, and can provide moderate to high resolution information. These are well studied methods often utilized in the paleoecological field. The environmental complexity factor is normally tackled through statistical analysis of the available numerical data (quantitative paleontology or paleostatistics), while the study of post-mortem processes is known as the field of taphonomy. Quaternary Because the Quaternary period is well represented in geographically extensive and high temporal-resolution records, many hypotheses arising from ecological studies of modern environments can be tested at the millennial scale using paleoecological data. In addition, such studies provide historical (pre- industrialization) baselines of species composition and disturbance regimes for ecosystem restoration, or provide examples or for understanding the dynamics of ecosystem change through perdiods of large climate changes. Paleoecological studies are used to inform conservation, management and restoration efforts. In particular, fire-focused paleoecology is an informative field of study to land managers seeking to restore ecosystem fire regimes.

It allowed the 701 series to be both compact (when closed) and comfortable to use (when open), despite being just 24.6 cm (9.7 in) wide with a 26.4 cm (10.4 in) VGA LCD. The 701 was the top selling laptop of 1995; however, as later laptop models featured progressively larger screens, the need for a folding keyboard was eliminated. Consequently, no model but the 701 used the butterfly keyboard. The butterfly keyboard is split into two roughly triangular pieces that slide as the laptop's lid is opened or closed. As the lid is opened both pieces slide out to the sides, followed by one piece sliding downward. The two halves mesh to form a keyboard 29.2 cm (11.5 in) wide which overhangs the sides of the laptop body. Conversely, as the lid is closed one piece slides back, then both slide inward until the keyboard can be covered by the lid. The movement of the keyboard is driven by a cam on the lid's hinge, so the motions of the keyboard parts are always synchronized with the movement of the lid. The unusual design is being displayed in the design collection of the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan, New York and Die Neue Sammlung.

He defected to Jordan and assisted United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection teams assigned to look for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Biography Kamel was born in Tel Al Thahab (in modern-day Balad District, Saladin Governorate). He rose through the military ranks to become the Supervisor of the Republican Guard, Iraq's elite military forces, in 1982. He later became the Minister of Industries, heading the Military Industrialisation Commission and supervising Iraq's weapons development programs from 1987. Kamel became oil minister of Iraq in 1990. He married one of Saddam Hussein's daughters, Raghad Saddam, and lived in Iraq until 1995.King Abdullah II of Jordan: Our Last Best Chance; Viking Press; New York, New York; 2011; p. 95. On 7 August of that year, Kamel and his wife defected from Iraq, along with Kamel's brother, Saddam Kamel, and the brother's wife, Rana Saddam, another of Saddam Hussein's daughters. In a 21 September 1995 interview with CNN, Hussein Kamel explained: > This is what made me leave the country, the fact that Saddam Hussein > surrounds himself with inefficient ministers and advisers who are not chosen > for their competence but according to the whims of the Iraqi president. And > as a result of this the whole of Iraq is suffering. Jordan granted asylum to the Kamels, and there they began to cooperate with UNSCOM and its director Rolf Ek√©us, the American CIA and the British MI6. The initial promises of a wealth of information were, allegedly, not fulfilled. According to U.S. and Jordanian officials, the intelligence provided by Hussein Kamel on Iraqi secret weapons programs was of limited content and value.Washington Post 24 February 1996 Kamel confirmed what inspectors had been able to ascertain shortly before his defection, that Iraq had operated a biological warfare program prior to the Gulf War, but had destroyed its entire stockpile of chemical and biological weapons and banned missiles. Kamel's defection presented a major problem for those seeking to overthrow the Iraqi government. Return to Iraq and death In February 1996, after intermediaries for Saddam Hussein had assured them that all would be forgiven, Hussein Kamel and Saddam Kamel were convinced to return to Iraq with their wives. Reportedly, immediately upon their return, they were ordered to divorce their wives and were denounced as traitors. Three days after their arrival, on 23 February, they refused to surrender to Saddam's security forces and were killed in a 13-hour firefight at a safe house. According to an alternative version of events, the Kamel brothers were killed less than 24 hours following the divorce decrees, in a gun battle with other cousins trying to gain back their clan honor in the eyes of Saddam. After effects In a 25 January 1999 report to the U.N. Security Council, UNSCOM declared that the history of the Iraqi weapons inspections \\"must be divided into two parts, separated by the events following the departure from Iraq, in August 1995, of Lt. Gen. Hussein Kamel.\\" Kamel maintained that Iraq had destroyed its weapons of mass destruction and related programs after the end of the first Gulf War. > I ordered destruction of all chemical weapons. All weapons‚Äîbiological, > chemical, missile, nuclear‚Äîwere destroyed.Transcript of part one of > Correspondent Brent Sadler's exclusive interview with Hussein Kamel; CNN; 21 > September 1995. A 3 March 2003 Newsweek report said that Kamel's revelations were \\"hushed up\\" because inspectors \\"hoped to bluff Saddam [Hussein] into revealing still more.\\" Kamel's version of events appear to have been borne out in the wake of the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. In the build-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Bush administration figures‚Äîincluding George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and Colin Powell‚Äîrepeatedly cited Kamel's testimony as evidence that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction.

Tartrazine is a commonly used color all over the world, mainly for yellow, and can also be used with Brilliant Blue FCF (FD&C; Blue 1, E133) or Green S (E142) to produce various green shades.  Products containing tartrazine = Foods  Many foods contain tartrazine in varying proportions, depending on the manufacturer or person preparing the food. When in food, tartrazine is typically labelled as \\"color\\", \\"tartrazine\\", or \\"E102\\", depending on the jurisdiction, and the applicable labeling laws (see Regulation below). Products containing tartrazine commonly include processed commercial foods that have an artificial yellow or green color, or that consumers expect to be brown or creamy looking. It has been frequently used in the bright yellow coloring of imitation lemon filling in baked goods. The following is a list of foods that may contain tartrazine: * Desserts and confectionery: ice cream, ice pops and popsicles, confectionery and hard candy (such as gummy bears, Peeps marshmallow treats, etc.), cotton candy, instant puddings and gelatin (such as Jell-O), cake mixes, pastries (such as Pillsbury pastries), custard powder, marzipan, biscuits, and cookies. * Beverages: soft drinks (such as Mountain Dew), energy and sports drinks, powdered drink mixes (such as Kool- Aid), fruit cordials, and flavored/mixed alcoholic beverages. * Snacks: flavored corn chips (such as Doritos, nachos, etc.), chewing gum, popcorn (both microwave and cinema-popped), and potato chips. * Condiments and spreads: jam, jelly (including mint jelly), marmalade, mustard, horseradish, pickles (and other products containing pickles such as tartar sauce and dill pickle dip), and processed sauces. * Other processed foods: cereal (such as corn flakes, muesli, etc.), instant or \\"cube\\" soups), rices (like paella, risotto, etc.), noodles (such as some varieties of Kraft Dinner), pureed fruit and pickled peppers, bright-green-colored seaweed salad.  Personal care and cosmetics products  A number of personal care and cosmetics products may contain tartrazine, usually labelled as CI 19140 or FD&C; Yellow 5, including: * Liquid and bar soaps, green hand sanitizer, moisturizers and lotions, mouth washes, perfumes, toothpastes, and shampoos, conditioners and other hair products. * Cosmetics, such as eyeshadow, blush, face powder and foundation, lipstick, etc. ‚Äì even those that are primarily pink or purple. (Usually make- up manufacturers use one label for all shades in a product line, placing the phrase \\"may contain\\" ahead of all colors that are used in that line, not necessarily that specific shade.) * Nail polish, nail polish remover, temporary tattoos, and tanning lotions.  Medications  Various types of medications include tartrazine to give a yellow, orange or green hue to a liquid, capsule, pill, lotion, or gel, primarily for easy identification. Types of pharmaceutical products that may contain tartrazine include vitamins, antacids, cold medications (including cough drops and throat lozenges), lotions and prescription drugs. Most, if not all, medication data sheets are required to contain a list of all ingredients, including tartrazine. Some include tartrazine in the allergens alert section. The Canadian Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties (CPS), a prescribing reference book for health professionals, mentions tartrazine as a potential allergy for each drug that contains tartrazine.  Other products  Other products, such as household cleaning products, paper plates, pet foods, crayons, inks for writing instruments, stamp dyes, face paints, envelope glues, and deodorants, may also contain tartrazine. Chemistry Tartrazine is water-soluble and has a maximum absorbance in an aqueous solution at 425 nm. It is one of the oldest known member of the pyrazolone family of dyes.  Potential health effects on humans =Sensitivity Tartrazine appears to cause the most allergic and intolerance reactions of all the azo dyes, particularly among asthmatics and those with an aspirin intolerance. Symptoms from tartrazine sensitivity can occur by either ingestion or cutaneous exposure to a substance containing tartrazine. Symptoms appear after periods of time ranging from minutes up to 14 hours. The prevalence of tartrazine intolerance is estimated at roughly 360,000 U.S. Citizens affected, less than 0.12% of the general population. According to the FDA, tartrazine causes hives in fewer than 1 in 10,000 people, or 0.01%. It is not clear how many individuals are sensitive or intolerant to tartrazine, but the University of Guelph estimates that it is 1 to 10 out of every ten thousand people (0.01% to 0.1% of the population).Food Science  Educating Food Leaders for over 100 years There is much controversy about whether tartrazine has ill effects on individuals who are not clearly intolerant. Total avoidance is the most common way to deal with tartrazine sensitivity, but progress has been made in reducing people‚Äôs tartrazine sensitivity in a study of people who are simultaneously sensitive to both aspirin and tartrazine.  Asthma  A systematic review of the medical literature concluded that among patients with asthma, research has shown that exposure to tartrazine does not worsen symptoms and avoidance of tartrazine does not improve symptoms; however, \\"due to the paucity of evidence, it is not possible to provide firm conclusions as to the effects of tartrazine on asthma control\\".  Food intolerance and ADHD-like behavior Although tartrazine is one of various food colors said to cause food intolerance and ADHD-like behavior in children, evidence for this claim is lacking. It is possible that certain food colorings may act as a trigger in those who are genetically predisposed, but the evidence for this effect is weak. Cancer A 2015 study found that Yellow 5 caused damage to white blood cells, which may make the development of tumors and diseases such as cancer more likely. Studies Some studies suggested that tartrazine can cause kidney tumours in laboratory animals. Myths Rumors began circulating about tartrazine in the 1990s regarding a link to its consumption (specifically its use in Mountain Dew) and adverse effects on male potency, testicle and penis size, and sperm count. There are no documented cases supporting the claim tartrazine will shrink a penis or cause it to stop growing.  Regulation = Canada  Tartrazine is listed as a permitted food coloring in Canada.Table III of section B.16.100, Food and Drug Regulations The majority of pre-packaged foods are required to list all ingredients, including all food additives such as color; however section B.01.010 (3)(b) of the Regulations provide food manufacturers with the choice of declaring added color(s) by either their common name or simply as \\"colour\\".section B.01.010 (3)(b) In February 2010, Health Canada consulted the public and manufacturers on their plans to change the labelling requirements. Health Canada felt that it might be prudent to require the identification of specific colors on food labels, to allow consumers to make better informed choices. The results of the consultation supported increased transparency.Health Canada reviews comments received on the proposed changes to current food colour labelling regulations for prepackaged foods Some respondents proposed banning the use of synthetic food colors, however Health Canada found that existing scientific literature does not demonstrate that synthetic food coloring is unsafe in the general population; they are instead considering more transparent labelling to allow those with sensitivities to food color to make informed choices. The relevant proposed regulatory changes will be developed and published for consultation in Part I of the Canada Gazette,Canada Gazette the official newsletter of the Government of Canada.  United Kingdom and EU  The European Food Safety Authority allows for tartrazine to be used in processed cheese, canned or bottled fruit or vegetables, processed fish or fishery products, and wines and wine-based drinks.further details can be found on the EFSA food additives database page on tartrazineFOODS In response to concerns about the safety of certain food additives, the UK FSA commissioned a study by researchers at Southampton University of the effect of a mixture of six food dyes (Tartrazine, Allura Red, Ponceau 4R, Quinoline Yellow WS, Sunset Yellow and Carmoisine (dubbed the \\"Southampton 6\\")) and sodium benzoate (a preservative) on children in the general population, who consumed them in beverages; the study published in 2007.Sarah Chapman of Chapman Technologies on behalf of Food Standards Agency in Scotland. March 2011 [Guidelines on approaches to the replacement of Tartrazine, Allura Red, Ponceau 4R, Quinoline Yellow, Sunset Yellow and Carmoisine in food and beverages] The study found \\"a possible link between the consumption of these artificial colours and a sodium benzoate preservative and increased hyperactivity\\" in the children;FDA. Background Document for the Food Advisory Committee: Certified Color Additives in Food and Possible Association with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Children: March 30‚Äì31, 2011 the advisory committee to the FSA that evaluated the study also determined that because of study limitations, the results could not be extrapolated to the general population, and further testing was recommended. The European regulatory community, with a stronger emphasis on the precautionary principle, required labelling and temporarily reduced the acceptable daily intake (ADI) for the food colorings; the UK FSA called for voluntary withdrawal of the colorings by food manufacturers. However, in 2009 the EFSA re-evaluated the data at hand and determined that \\"the available scientific evidence does not substantiate a link between the color additives and behavioral effects.\\" Tartrazine is among six artificial colors for which the European Union requires products that contain them to be marked with the statement May have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.  United States  The United States requires the presence of tartrazine to be declared on food and drug products (21 CFR 74.1705 (revised April 2013), 21 CFR 201.20) and also color batches to be preapproved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As part of these regulations, the FDA requires that the Precautions section of prescription drug labels include the warning statement, \\"This product contains FD+C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD+C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity.\\"CFR ‚Äì Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 The FDA regularly seizes products if found to be containing undeclared tartrazine, declared but not FDA-tested, or labeled something other than FD&C; yellow 5 or Yellow 5.

It is located on the shores of Lake Nero, northeast of Moscow. Population: While the official name of the town is Rostov, it is popularly known to Russians as Rostov Veliky (, Rostov the Great) to distinguish it from the much larger city of Rostov-on-Don. The name of the town railway station is Rostov Yaroslavsky, due to its location in Yaroslavl Oblast. History Rostov was preceded by Sarskoye Gorodishche, which some scholars interpret as the capital of the Finnic Merya tribe. Others believe it was an important Viking trade enclave and fortress guarding the Volga trade route. Scythians also settled there. These different ethnicities, such as the Vikings, Scyths, Slavs and Finns, were likely the ancestors of many of today's people in that region. First mentioned in documents in the year 862 as an already important settlement, by the 10th century Rostov became the capital city of Vladimir-Suzdal, one of the most prominent Russian principalities. It was incorporated into Muscovy in 1474. After losing its independent status, Rostov was still an ecclesiastic center (from 988 it was the see of the Diocese of Yaroslavl, one of the first Russian bishoprics. In the 14th century, the bishops of Rostov became archbishops, and late in the 16th century, metropolitans. One of those metropolitans, Iona (Jonah) Sysoyevich (ca. 1607-1690), commissioned the town's main landmark: the kremlin. This is regarded by some as the finest outside that of Moscow. Ravaged by the Mongols in the 13th and 14th centuries (last sack by Edigu in 1408), and the Poles in 1608, Rostov survived as a medium-sized town. Late in the 18th century, the metropolitan see was transferred to Yaroslavl. Rostov is renowned for manufacturing enamels. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Rostov serves as the administrative center of Rostovsky District, even though it is not a part of it.Law #12-z As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the town of oblast significance of Rostov‚Äîan administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the town of oblast significance of Rostov is incorporated within Rostovsky Municipal District as Rostov Urban Settlement.Law #65-z thumb Main sights Definitive stamp of Russia showing Rostov Kremlin. The central square of Rostov is occupied by the Assumption Cathedral. It is unknown when the present building was erected, the mid-16th century being the most likely date. Lower parts of the cathedral walls are dated to the 12th century. The ponderous bell-tower was constructed mostly in the 17th century. Its bells are among the largest and most famous in Russia - each has its own name. The largest bell, cast in 1688, weighs . It is named Sysoy to honor the city's founding father. The church is home to the incorrupt body of Saint Leontius of Rostov.Internetowa Liturgia Godzin An area situated between the cathedral square and the lake was chosen by Iona Sysoevich as a place for his fairy-tale residence. All the construction works were carried out between 1667 and 1694. Major buildings include the ornate Savior Church-na-Senyakh (1675), the sombre Church of St. Gregory (1670), and the barbican churches of St. John the Apostle (1683) and of the Resurrection of Christ (1670). The residence, often erroneously called kremlin, also includes eleven ornate tower bells, numerous palaces, several small belfries, and the diminutive baroque Church of Our Lady of Smolensk (1693). All the churches are elaborately painted and decorated. The cathedral and four tall kremlin churches with their silver \\"blind\\" domes were imitated throughout the city. This is particularly evident in the Savior-on-the-Market church and the cathedral church of the Nativity convent, both dating from the 17th century and situated near the kremlin walls. The oldest church within the town center was consecrated to St. Isidore the Blessed in 1565. They say that Ivan the Terrible had the architect executed, because his church was so much smaller than its predecessor. The kremlin is flanked by two monasteries, both facing the Lake Nero. To the right from the kremlin stands the Abraham monastery, founded in the 11th century and one of the oldest in Russia. Its cathedral, commissioned by Ivan the Terrible in 1553 to commemorate the conquest of Kazan, inspired numerous churches in the region, particularly in Yaroslavl. Spaso-Yakovlevsky Monastery, situated to the left from the Kremlin on the town's outskirts, has been venerated as the shrine of St. Dmitry of Rostov. Most of the monastery structures were built in the late 18th and early 19th centuries in the fine neoclassical style. There are also two 17th-century churches: the Conception of St. Anna, and the Transfiguration of Our Savior. Unlike most other churches in the town, the monastery belongs to the Russian Orthodoxy and houses a theological seminary.

For example, an old wooden church (1687‚Äì1689) may be seen in Ishnya. One of the best preserved monasteries in Russia, named after the saints Boris and Gleb, is situated in Borisoglebsky, about west of the town. The monastery was favored by Ivan the Terrible, who personally supervised the construction of towered walls and bell-tower around an even more ancient cathedral. The only addition made to the monastery after Ivan's death is a barbican church, commissioned by the metropolitan Iona Sysoyevich.

From Nobel Lectures, Literature 1968-1980, Editor-in-Charge Tore Fr√§ngsmyr, Editor Sture All√©n, World Scientific Publishing Co., Singapore, 1993 The novel was first published in serial form in 1951. Titled Meijin (Âêç‰∫∫) in its original Japanese, Kawabata considered it his finest work, although it is in contrast with his other works. It is the only one of Kawabata's novels that the author considered to be finished. Plot It is a semi-fictional chronicle of the lengthy 1938 \\"retirement game\\" of Go by the respected master Honinbo Sh≈´sai, against the up-and-coming player Minoru Kitani (although the latter's name is changed to Otak√© in the book). It was the last game of the master Sh≈´sai's career, a lengthy struggle which took almost six months to complete; he narrowly lost to his younger challenger, to die a little over a year thereafter. Themes Kawabata had actually reported on the match for the Mainichi newspaper chain, and some sections of the book are reworked versions of his original newspaper columns. The book has many layers of meaning, more so than Kawabata's other works. As well as simply describing the game, on the surface there are the inherent themes of the struggle between the older player whose powers are fading, and his younger challenger; and also the clash between the differing playing styles, and the personalities in which they are to some degree rooted. The book also describes vividly how the Master and the challenger dealt with exhausting struggles against themselves. The book reflects the tension between old traditions and new pragmatism'Dialectics and Change in Kawabata's The Master of Go ', Marlene A. Pilarcik, Modern Language Studies Vol. 16, No. 4 (Autumn, 1986), pp. 9-21 \\\\- for example, commenting upon the rigid rules governing the contest, the author writes: :From the way of Go, the beauty of Japan and the Orient had fled. Everything had become science and regulation. Finally, as a retelling of a climactic struggle, translator Edward Seidensticker considers it a symbolic parallel to the defeat of Japan in World War II, an event which affected Kawabata deeply. Kawabata began work on the book during the war, but did not complete it until well after the end of it. The game, as actually played in real life, lasted 237 moves, and is documented in the book by means of diagrams. Kitani Minoru, playing Black, won by 5 points. The game can be downloaded in .sgf format. The book is frequently used by western Go players as a starting point to explore the place of Go in Japanese society and it is commonly recommended to younger players.The Meijin's retirement game : Honinbo Shusai versus Kitani Minoru, John Fairbairn (2010) contains an extensive commentary on the 1938 game. Publication The book was translated into English () in 1972, by Seidensticker. The original Japanese book version, published in 1954, was somewhat longer than the version translated by Seidensticker, which was Kawabata's later revision. The book has been translated into more than a dozen other languages.

The seal shows the Roman goddess Minerva (Athena in Greek mythology), the goddess of wisdom and war, because she was born an adult, and California was never a territory; a California grizzly bear (the official state animal) feeding on grape vines, representing California's wine production; a sheaf of grain, representing agriculture; a miner, representing the California Gold Rush and the mining industry; and sailing ships, representing the state's economic power. The word Eureka (ŒµœçœÅŒ∑Œ∫Œ± in Greek), meaning \\"I have found it\\", is the California state motto. The original design of the seal was by U.S. Army major Robert S. Garnett and engraved by Albert Kuner. However, because of the friction then in existence between the military and civil authorities, Garnett was unwilling to introduce the design to the constitutional convention, so convention clerk Caleb Lyon introduced it as his own design, with Garnett's approval. Garnett later became the first general to be killed in the Civil War, where he served as a Confederate. State Seal basics=What is the Great Seal?

Rowe's interpretation of the Seal of California Although the waters were described in 1849 as being \\"of the Sacramento\\" and the mountains in the background as being \\"the snow-clad peaks of the Sierra Nevada\\", other, very early descriptions referred to the body of water as San Francisco Bay.\\"The Great Seal of California\\", The Illustrated London News, January 12, 1850, 21Frank Soul√©, The Annals of San Francisco (New York: D.

Garnett, letter to Caleb Lyon, September 30, 1849 (Courtesy of Department of Special Collections and University Archives, Stanford University Libraries) and in 1899, Garnett's brother referred to the mountain as Mount Diablo,Louis A. Garnett, \\"The True Story of the Origin of the Great Seal of the State of California\\", San Francisco Chronicle, December 10, 1899, 10 which could back up Robert's view (if Minerva is placed in San Francisco and 'up' is toward the east). In 1928, due to the number of incorrect details that had crept into the seal over the years (some pointed out as early as 1914\\"State Is Full of Great Seals ‚Äì All Are Wrong, Artist Finds\\", San Francisco Examiner, April 9, 1914, 8), state printer Carroll H. Smith was authorized to prepare a new and correct seal.\\"Great Seal of State Wrong\\", Los Angeles Times, March 27, 1928, 4 This seal was drawn by Los Angeles heraldic artist Marc J. Rowe who, among other corrections, narrowed the growing break in the mountains so that it appeared to be the Sacramento River, \\"fringed by snow-capped Sierra, and not an arm of San Francisco Bay, as the old seal made it appear\\".\\"Sacramento River Wends Its Way Across State's Great Seal\\", Sacramento Bee, June 7, 1928, 16 San Franciscans considered this change to be \\"a slight on their city in favor of Los Angeles\\".\\"San Franciscans Protest Seal as Los Angeles Art\\", Los Angeles Times, June 14, 1928, 1 His design was not adopted as the official seal,J. N. Bowman, \\"The Great Seal of California\\", California Blue Book (Sacramento: State Printing Office, 1950), 167 although it was used by the State Printing Office. However, just nine years later, the 1937 standardized seal once again featured a widened gap of Golden Gate proportions, although it did keep Rowe's snow-capped Sierra Nevada that had replaced the barren foothills of previous editions of the seal. Both features remain to this day. The 1937 standardization came about when state employees, wishing to print the seal on blotters for the State Fair, could not find any official design of the seal. This prompted a new law (Statutes of California, 1937, chapter 380), which \\"established for the first time a definite pictured design with which the master die was 'substantially' to conform, and at the same time established the legality of all previous seals which were essentially the same as this one.\\" The full color version, accepted as official, was created in 1978 by Jane Van Doren, Graphic Artist for the California State Printing Office (now the California Office of State Publishing). The whereabouts of the original painting is unknown. Misconceptions about elements in (or supposedly in) the Seal=The mysterious building Also in the 1937 standardized seal there is a building on the far left rear hill that has been interpreted in a variety of ways. The building, along with the break in the mountains, may have been added to give San Francisco Bay a stronger claim on its location being the landscape portrayed in the seal.J. N. Bowman, \\"The Great Seal of California\\", California Blue Book (Sacramento: State Printing Office, 1950), 159 This building first appeared in unofficial versions of the seal as early as 1875,Robert J. Chandler, To Catch Customers: Grafton Tyler Brown's 1875 Lithographic Sample Sheets (San Francisco: Richard Seibert, 2014) and in most of these, the building was clearly meant to represent Fort Point in San Francisco.The Seal of the City and County of San Francisco features a view of a ship steaming through the Golden Gate, and on each shore stands a structure. On the left is what appears to be Fort Point, and on the right, possibly Point Bonita Light. This seal, adopted by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1859 (\\"Seal of the City and County of San Francisco\\", City and County of San Francisco, accessed July 6, 2011), may have influenced later artists of the state sealOddly, although the mosaic seal on the second floor of the Ferry Building is of the right place, San Francisco, and right era, 1890s, it does not include the building Interpretations as Fort Point File:Fort Point, San Francisco, circa 1888 (14680737191).jpgA circa 1888 image of Fort Point for comparison with representations of the fort on the following renditions of the Seal of California File:Seal_of_California_(Building_Detail),_1875,_Grafton_Tyler_Brown_(1841-1918).jpgAn 1875 image from a sample book by San Francisco lithographer Grafton Tyler Brown File:Seal_of_California_(Building_Detail),_1886,_California_State_Government_Executive_Department_Letterhead.jpgCalifornia State Letterhead (1886): Printed by a San Francisco lithographer File:Seal of California (Building Detail), 1894, F.

Fort Point has no dome, and it is unknown what building the 1895 artist was attempting to portray.J. N. Bowman reported that the engraver of the 1937 master die, James Cairns, engraved \\"the object on the left point of land at the 'gate' ... as a fort.\\" (J. N. Bowman, \\"The Great Seal of California\\", California Blue Book (Sacramento: State Printing Office, 1950), 165) Two years later, Harold F. Wilson, in his interpretation created for the old State Building in Los Angeles (now located inside the Ronald Reagan State Building in that city), retained the dome.\\"State Building Entry Completed ‚Äì Seal of California in Bronze Laid in $30,000 Portal Walk\\", Los Angeles Times, June 20, 1939, 8 In 1952, the structure, again with dome, was cast in bronze in the large seal at the west steps of the California State Capitol in Sacramento.\\"The New Look\\", Sacramento Bee, October 1, 1952, 25 The building receives a dome File:Seal of California (Building Detail), taken from the 1895 edition of the California Blue Book.jpgCalifornia Blue Book (1895). The building is identical here to the way it appears in the 1937 standardized seal. File:Seal of California (Building Detail), 1939, Harold F. Wilson, Ronald Reagan State Building, Los Angeles, California.jpgRonald Reagan State Building, Los Angeles (1939) File:Seal of California (Building Detail), 1952, West Entrance of California State Capitol, Sacramento.jpgOn the west steps of the California State Capitol, Sacramento (1952) There is a widespread rumor that the building in the seal found in front of the State Capitol had never appeared in any previous incarnation of the seal, and was meant to represent the chapel at San Quentin State Prison. The rumor states it was added as a \\"signature\\" of the prison inmates who cast it, as their alleged request to add their actual signatures was supposedly refused. The unsanctioned addition, so the story goes, was not noticed until it was too late to do anything about it, and so was left as is. Although this 3,400 pound, nearly ten foot wide seal was created in the foundry at San Quentin,California Blue Book (Sacramento: State Printing Office, 1958), 667 five facts stand in the way of this rumor's being true: # If the building is taken as San Quentin and if the break in the mountains is taken to be the Golden Gate, then the view must be of the San Francisco Bay Area, looking from east to west. That places the building on the wrong side of the Gate to be San Quentin. # No building in this form, including the chapel, has ever existed at San Quentin. # The building first appeared in artistic renditions of the seal as early as 1875, decades before this seal was cast in 1952, and was officially added in 1937. (Eighteen pre-1952 examples that include the building are shown or referred to in this article.) # The configuration of the building on this seal is strikingly similar to its appearance in the 1937 standardization, which itself was based on the 1895 Blue Book rendition. # Four detailed, post-1952 accounts of the seal make no mention of the rumor.\\"State Seal a Product of Convicts\\", San Diego Union, January 31, 1960, A22Letters Between J. N. Bowman and W. N. Davis, May 1962 (California State Archives, General Information Files, Seals ‚Äì Great Seal of California)J. N. Bowman, \\"The Great Seal of California\\", 1963 (revision of his 1958 article \\"for some future edition\\" of the California Blue Book, California State Archives, General Information Files, Seals ‚Äì Great Seal of California) One of those, a 1959 newspaper article written more than seven years after the placement of the seal, reported that \\"[t]he only criticism of the convicts' rendition of the seal is that they made the nose of [Minerva] too straight\\" and that the work \\"turned out so well it was planned to have the governor, Earl Warren, write the convicts commendations.\\"\\"6 Ton Seal Defies Crowds\\", Sacramento Bee, December 27, 1959, B9 The source of this story has yet to come to light, although it is possibly related to the large seal attached to the Resources Building in downtown Sacramento, placed in 1964, just four years before the earliest known reference to the rumor in 1968.\\"[The students] noted a huge replica of the California State Seal, made by men of San Quentin of copper and iron. The inmates placed the prison chapel on the seal, although it wasn't supposed to be there.\\" (\\"Eighth Graders Find Capital Exciting\\", (Eureka) Times-Standard, June 9, 1968, 6). But be careful with what you read: this article goes on to mention ‚Äì twice ‚Äì that the seal contains thirty-six stars to represent California being the thirty-sixth state. It was, in fact, the thirty-first This seal features what appears to be two structures combined into one. The right half, with some imagination, resembles the front gates of San Quentin State Prison, and the left half, with even more imagination, Folsom State Prison's Greystone Chapel. Why the artist portrayed the building in this fashion is another mystery. If the artist did mean for the building to be San Quentin and Folsom prisons, the rumor being mistakenly attached to the seal in front of the Capitol may have stemmed from a confusion of the two seals, which are only a few blocks from each other.The rumor may have been given further credence by the 1988 discovery that a printing plate in use by prison labor on behalf of the state printing office gave Minerva's face the appearance of Snoopy, the famous cartoon beagle. At first it was believed that it was a prank by the inmates but later was found to have been caused unintentionally by a worn printing plate. (\\"That Character on State Seal NOT Snoopy\\", Modesto Bee, April 1, 1988, B4). In a similar vein, Vermont inmates working in the prison print shop made an unsanctioned change to the state police emblem door decal used on the sides of thirty police cruisers. One of the spots on the cow (which is supposed to be there) was altered to take the shape of a pig. (Zach Howard, \\"Vermont Inmates Hide Pig in Official Police Car Decal\\", Reuters, February 2, 2012, accessed November 8, 2012) In fact, a postcard dated 2000 shows an image of the State Capitol at night, with an inset image of the seal. The seal used is the one on the Resources Building. Whatever the building is, it is easily missed. Even the nearly exhaustive official color scheme for the seal (e.g., \\"the spear of Minerva shall be Oakwood, Cable No. 70094 and the tip white\\"), passed in 1967‚Äîthirty years after the structure was officially added‚Äîfailed to mention the building.Statutes of California, 1967, chapter 919 Other interpretations of the mysterious building over the years Because there is no official designation of the identity of the building, artists have interpreted the building in a number of ways.

The missing cross?  Another rumor associated with the Great Seal of the State of California is that it once featured a cross which had since been removed. The source of this story is most likely a confusion of the state seal (with its supposed chapel) with the Seal of Los Angeles County (and its crossless view of Mission San Gabriel Arc√°ngel). This county seal did in fact include a cross from its creation in 1957 until 2004, when a threatened lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union encouraged the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to remove the cross and make other design changes to the seal.\\"Los Angeles County Seal ‚Äì Old and New,\\" Los Angeles Almanac, accessed July 5, 2011 (A similar lawsuit earlier in the year led to the removal of a cross from the seal of the city of Redlands.)Hugo Martin, \\"Facing ACLU Complaint, City to Drop Seal's Cross,\\" Los Angeles Times, April 29, 2004, B1 The mistaken idea that there had once been a cross on the state seal quickly spread, appearing as near to Los Angeles as Long Beach\\"Speak Out: How Would You Solve the County Seal and Pledge Controversies?,\\" Long Beach Press-Telegram, June 19, 2004, A12 and as far away as New Hampshire even before the county seal had been officially changed.\\"When It Comes to Internet Filters, Local Librarians Just Don't Get It,\\" (Nashua, NH) Telegraph, July 11, 2004, Perspective Columns The steam vessel The real-life identity (if there is one) of the steam vessel shown at the far left of the seal is a subject of debate. No primary source documents have confirmed either of the following intriguing claims. An interpretation of the steamship as a sidewheeler In 2004, the California State Legislature passed Assembly Concurrent Resolution 131, authored by Dave Cox. ACR 131 renamed part of U.S. Route 50 in Sacramento County in honor of multiethnic California pioneer William Alexander Leidesdorff, Jr. It read, in part: \\"WHEREAS, In 1847, William Alexander Leidesdorff, Jr. captained the first and only steamship in California prior to the Gold Rush of 1848, the Sitka. His maiden steam voyage up the Sacramento River is immortalized on the California State Seal and recognizes his vision for increased maritime transportation of California's agricultural products to world markets.\\" A vessel of thirty-seven feet length, nine feet breadth of beam, and eighteen inch draw, for her trial voyage on San Francisco Bay a very large passenger was repeatedly warned not to stir from his \\"post of honor immediately over the boiler,\\" and on her only voyage to Sacramento in November/December 1847 it was reported that the baby of one of her passengers needed to be passed around to keep the \\"crank\\" vessel trim. Her career as a steam vessel was short-lived, however, as she sank at anchorage in February of the next year during a gale in San Francisco. \\"Thus perished the first steamer on the Bay, a mere toy, and a most dangerous one too,\\" reported San Francisco's Californian, \\"Should she be resuscitated by the owner we sincerely hope that none of our citizens will trust themselves with a passage in her beyond the 'flat' that she now rests upon.\\" The pioneering and enterprising Leidesdorff did indeed have her raised and refitted as a schooner, the Rainbow, and she continued to run on the Sacramento River after the discovery of gold.Hubert Howe Bancroft, The Works of Hubert Howe Bancroft, Volume XXII, History of California, Volume V, 1846‚Äì1848 (San Francisco: The History Company, 1886), 575‚Äì581\\"A Chapter on Steamboats,\\" Sacramento Union, May 19, 1858, 1\\"Trouble on the Bay,\\" (San Francisco) Californian, February 16, 1848, 2 An interpretation of the steamship as a screw steamer However, in his 2001 book, Maritime Tragedies on the Santa Barbara Channel, Justin Ruhge suggested another possibility. The USS Edith, a screw steamer, was sent from San Francisco Bay to Santa Barbara and San Diego in August 1849 to pick up the delegates for the upcoming constitutional convention. On the second day out, the Edith ran aground in a heavy fog at about 10 p.m. south of Point Sal, at the north end of what would become Vandenberg Air Force Base. There was no loss of life and the captain and crew were later exonerated by a Court of Inquiry, but the ship and her cargo had to be abandoned. Garnett, a passenger, was left in charge of the salvage efforts. Sam Pollard reported that \\"a few days after the wreck [Garnett] came to San Luis Obispo and was my guest for two weeks ... and showed me the work he was doing on [the State Seal] in my store at San Luis Obispo.\\" Ruhge concluded, \\"When Major Garnett laid out the seal, he included a number of sailing ships and on the middle left side of the seal he also drew in a steam bark. It is likely that this is the U.S.S. Edith. The ship in the drawing is a steamer without side wheels. At that time only the U.S.S. Edith was such a ship. The only other steamer on the west coast at that time was the much larger steamer California that was driven by side wheels.\\"Justin Ruhge, \\"Looking Back at Local History,\\" Santa Maria Times, May 21, 2001 Leidesdorff's Sitka was a sidewheeler as well.Hubert Howe Bancroft, The Works of Hubert Howe Bancroft, Volume XXII, History of California, Volume V, 1846‚Äì1848 (San Francisco: The History Company, 1886), 577 The number of stars/Conrad Murray trial When live television coverage of the Conrad Murray trial of 2011 went to break, a seal, most likely located in the courthouse where the trial took place, was shown. It was soon discovered that this seal had thirty-two stars instead of the proper thirty-one. This error was interpreted by some as an intentional clue that the trial was a hoax, Michael Jackson was still alive, and had faked his own death.Michael Jackson Death Hoax Investigators, accessed March 14, 2012advice365, Michael Jackson: Death Hoax or Not?, accessed March 14, 2012 However, even seals found in government buildings are not immune to error: a thirty-eight star seal was on display at the San Diego County courthouse from 1889 until its demolition in 1959‚Äîseventy years\\"Stained Glass Windows ‚Äì A Tribute to San Diego County Courts of the Past\\", Superior Court of California, County of San Diego, accessed May 17, 2012‚Äîand the seal sculpted into the tympanum of the 1928 Stanley Mosk Library and Courts I building in Sacramento, where the Supreme Court of California sits while in the capital, shows twenty-one stars. Within the California State Capitol itself, the seals carved into the secretary's desk on the Senate floor and the clerk's desk on the Assembly floor, both in use since 1870, contain only thirteen stars. Twenty-nine star seals are attached to the B. F. Sisk Courthouse in Fresno, the Senator Alfred E. Alquist State Building in San Jose, the Justice Joseph A. Rattigan State Building in Santa Rosa, and the Van Nuys State Office Building in Van Nuys. And so the thirty-two star seal shown during the proceedings cannot be used as evidence that the trial was a hoax. In fact, an incorrect number of stars had been a widespread problem for some time. \\"Numerous reproductions of the seal are found in well-known books and other widely circulated printed matter which show thirty-two stars instead of thirty-one\\", wrote the Los Angeles Times in 1937.Rockwell D. Hunt, \\"State Seal of California\\", Los Angeles Times, September 8, 1937, A4 In 1914, seals were found to have as few as eleven, and as many as thirty-eight, stars. A version of the seal showing thirty-eight stars appeared on the title page of the 1887, 1889, 1893, 1895 (the 1895 edition also showed a thirty-two star on page 299), and 1899 editions of the California Blue Book, a publication of the Office of the Secretary of State (the custodian of the Great Seal). No seal appeared on the title page of the 1903 or 1907 editions. Strangely, a thirty-one star seal was used in the 1909 edition, but the publication went back to thirty-eight stars in 1911 and 1915, then settled on thirty-one in 1924.

Snyder and the men of the Bear Flag Revolt, which freed California from Mexican rule in 1846. This addition was objected to by native Californio Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, former head of the Mexican military in California, but a friend of the United States. He introduced an amendment to remove the bear, or, if it were to remain, that it be held fast by a vaquero's lasso. The amendment failed.Winfield J. Davis, \\"The Great Seal ‚Äì History of the State of California's Coat of Arms,\\" Sacramento Union, November 14, 1885, 6 In February 1850, the Daily Alta California of San Francisco accused Lyon of taking the $1000 appropriated to him by the convention for the purpose of securing a die and press, but giving a marred design, a die sunk too shallow, and an insufficiently powerful press for the job in return. The editorial continued that Lyon \\"received his money out of the civil fund, and is now conveying it to the sylvan retreats of Lyonsdale\\" and quite vehemently stated that Lyon had \\"no right or title to the honor of either designing or executing the seal any more than the Kha[n] of Tartary\\" while still protecting the anonymity of Garnett.\\"The State Seal,\\" Daily Alta California, February 19, 1850, 2 However, the fact that Garnett was chiefly responsible for the design was known by at least one observer of the convention at the time and generally known no later than December 1849.Bayard Taylor, \\"Bayard Taylor's Letters, No. XXVII,\\" New York Weekly Tribune, December 22, 1849, 1 Controversy arose again in 1899 with an article in the San Francisco Chronicle that claimed that Garnett's design was not original, but in fact based upon the seal of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows' California Lodge No. 1, with a few changes.\\"State Seal Pirated, Say the Odd Fellows,\\" San Francisco Chronicle, November 5, 1899, 7 This article was soon followed by a defense of the originality of the design written by Major Garnett's brother, Louis A. Garnett, who claimed that the timing of the creation of and differences between the two seals made it impossible for the state seal to have been based on the lodge seal. Despite this, the Grand Lodge of California continues to make this claim,The Grand Lodge of California Home Page, accessed July 9, 2011 and an I.O.O.F. historian has suggested that perhaps Garnett in fact designed both seals.Don R. Smith, \\"State of California Seal Like Seal of Odd Fellows Lodge No. 1,\\" June 9, 2007 Contention within the state government over the use and design of the Seal In 1855, conflict arose over the seal between Governor John Bigler and the Secretary of State James W. Denver. Denver, who had been elected to the United States Congress (and in whose honor the city of Denver, Colorado, was named), left for Washington, D.C. on October 5, but his resignation was not effective until November 5. Bigler asked for an immediate resignation and threatened to declare the office vacant and appoint a new Secretary of State if this request was refused. In the same letter, he also requested that the Great Seal be kept in the Governor's Office. Denver refused the request, as it would be impossible for him to fulfill his duties without it, and cited the fact that the seal had always been kept in the possession of the Secretary of State. On October 6, Bigler appointed his private secretary, C.H. Hempstead, to the office, and, accompanied by two witnesses, went to the office of the Secretary of State to have the appointment certified. Denver's deputy refused to certify, as he argued that the office would not be vacated until November 5, the effective date of Denver's resignation. It was not until that date that Hempstead's appointment was finally certified.Summarized from J.N. Bowman, \\"The Great Seal of California,\\" California Blue Book (Sacramento: State Printing Office, 1950), 169 In 1958, a disagreement arose between Secretary of State Frank M. Jordan and State Architect Anson Boyd over the design of the seal being used on state buildings in Sacramento. One seal showed the Golden Gate Bridge crossing over the gap in the mountains, and another spelled \\"Eureka\\" in Greek letters.\\"It's 'Eureka,' Not 'Eyphka,'\\" San Diego Union, June 29, 1958, pg.

The counterfeiters had been producing false pink slips and other identity papers using a fraudulent seal. The mistake the counterfeiters made that first tipped off investigators was the misspelling of \\"Seal\\" as \\"Seat.\\"Jeremy Belcher, \\"Counterfeiters Take a Back Seat in Spelling, Los Angeles Times, 10 February 1982, B3 The possibility of the use of fraudulent seals for unscrupulous gain had been discussed in the press as early as 1878.\\"An Absurd Sensation,\\" Sacramento Union, June 27, 1878, 2 This was followed in 1988 by the discovery that on a number of documents printed by the state printing office, Minerva's face had taken on the look of Snoopy, the beagle of Peanuts cartoon fame. The error was first discovered in the Department of Corrections newsletter, printed by prison labor, and so it was first suspected to be a prank by the inmates. It was later revealed that the source of the error was a worn printing plate, and so was not intentional.\\"That Character on State Seal NOT Snoopy,\\" Modesto Bee, April 1, 1988, B4 While most errors on the seal are unintentional, at least one was done \\"on porpoise\\": the staff of Assemblyman Jerry Lewis once ordered a birthday cake for their boss with a California seal on it, but it was \\"the kind that has flippers, swims in the ocean and eats fish.\\"Frank Moore, \\"With a Grain of Salt,\\" Redlands (CA) Daily Facts, October 23, 1974, B8 Examples of the Seal=Sacramento The seal can be seen in its various incarnations near the entrances of a number of state buildings in downtown Sacramento, including the State Capitol (as well as several inside of the Capitol, including an 1854 carving and a 1908 stained glass \\"sky\\" light), Stanley Mosk Library and Courts I (within the tympanum at 914 Capitol Mall), Department of Rehabilitation (721 Capitol Mall, not to be confused the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation), State Personnel Board (801 Capitol Mall), Employment Development Department (722/800 Capitol Mall), Resources Agency (1416 Ninth Street), Secretary of State (1500 Eleventh Street), CalTrans (1121 O Street), Office of the State Fire Marshal (1131 S Street), and the Department of Motor Vehicles (2415 First Avenue). A hand- painted seal which used to be on display at the old Oakland State Building (1111 Jackson Street) until its closure following the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989 can today be seen just within the front entrance of the state building at 1304 O Street, Sacramento. In West Sacramento, on the opposite shore of the Sacramento River from Old Sacramento, near the entrance to the headquarters of the California Department of General Services in the distinctive Ziggurat building, is another seal.

Three unusual seals can be seen at the San Francisco Civic Center. The 1894 James Lick Pioneer Monument features a seal where Minerva and the bear have \\"escaped\\" the seal and are sculpted in the round, leaving the remaining elements on Minerva's shield in the space normally occupied only by the face of Medusa. So large that it was shipped via oyster shell barge from the artists' studio (a dairy barn) in Petaluma, a 1500-pound fiberglass seal hangs above the entrance to the California Public Utilities Commission building.Jacque Giuffre (one of the two artists who created this seal), email to the author, May 29, 2012 A bright golden seal is on display in the auditorium of the Hiram Johnson State Building. There are two more, less spectacularly colored seals at the north and south entrances to that building. Joined by the seals of other western states, the seal of California hangs above one of the elevators in the lobby of the Hearst Building at Third and Market streets. A seal can also be found at Metropolitan Barber Shop, at 1018 Bush Street. Around the Bay Area, other seals can be found at the Native Sons of the Golden West Parlor No. 62 in Napa (a six-foot wide stained glass), the historic plaza in Sonoma on the 1846 Bear Flag Revolt monument (1914), the Elihu M Harris State Office Building in Oakland, the San Mateo County History Museum in Redwood City (a mosaic dating to 1910), the Circle of Palms Plaza in San Jose, the site of California's first state capitol, and in front of Colton Hall in Monterey, the site of the 1849 Constitutional Convention. Nearby is a 1957 monument to Robert S. Garnett which includes the seal.

The seal in the atrium of the Ronald Reagan State Building in Los Angeles is most likely this seal. Also in downtown Los Angeles, at the Los Angeles County Law Library, a large Seal of California is joined by others representing the various court districts of the area.

Another seal is attached to the Family Law Court in Riverside. Above the bench in Courtroom #1 of the San Diego Superior Court hangs a stained glass seal. This was one of forty-two state seals created in 1889 (one for each state then in the Union) by artist John Mallon for the courthouse at the time and saved from oblivion in 1978 by civic-minded San Diegans (the courthouse had been torn down in 1959, and the seals placed in storage).\\"Stained Glass Windows ‚Äì A Tribute to San Diego County Courts of the Past,\\" Superior Court of California, County of San Diego, accessed March 16, 2011 Not far from the Superior Court, just outside the entrance doors to the old central library location at 850 E Street, is another seal. Constructed as part of the Panama‚ÄìCalifornia Exposition, held in San Diego's Balboa Park from 1915 to 1917, the California Building features a stylized seal. A more standardized seal appears nearby, above the entrance to the San Diego Museum of Art. To celebrate the 1935‚Äì1936 California Pacific International Exposition, also held in Balboa Park, the United States Mint issued a commemorative half-dollar piece featuring a modified seal on the obverse. In 1907, the Native Daughters of the Golden West presented a large tablet to the officers and crew of the armored cruiser USS California (ACR-6).

Although the university's version of the Seal still graces its Tower Hall and several other buildings on the San Jose State campus, its fate as the school's official Seal is unclear. In recent years the school has also used a different seal depicting its Tower Hall building. The city of Eureka, California, uses the same seal, being the only U.S. location to use the state seal as its seal.Seal of California, Native Sons of the Golden West, Redwood Parlor #66, retrieved February 14, 2013 The city's name identically matches California's motto. Minerva and the bear appear on the seal of the city of Long Beach.

The Governor's Flag features a modified seal at its center.\\"The Governor's Flag,\\" The California State Military Museum, accessed July 9, 2011 The California Highway Patrol uses a modified state seal on its patch, replacing the wheat and grape vine with a cactus and adding a setting sun, and a seal as part of its shield that is nearly identical to the actual seal. Most state law enforcement agencies, along with many local and county agencies, display the state seal on their badges. Because it is a misdemeanor to use any representation or facsimile of the Great Seal of the State of California for commercial purposes, Hollywood productions will often use a modified seal. A fictionalized version of the seal, missing the words \\"California\\" and \\"Eureka\\", appeared on officers' shoulder patches used for the television series Highway Patrol, which, although filmed in southern California, was set in an unnamed western state.

There should be no other authority. # The message and order of the church should not be influenced by the current political convictions. # The church should not be ruled by a leader (\\"F√ºhrer\\"). There is no hierarchy in the church (Mt 20, 25f). # The state should not fulfill the task of the church and vice versa. State and church are both limited to their own business. # Therefore, the Barmen Declaration rejects (i) the subordination of the Church to the state (8.22‚Äì3) and (ii) the subordination of the Word and Spirit to the Church. \\"8.27 We reject the false doctrine, as though the Church in human arrogance could place the Word and work of the Lord in the service of any arbitrarily chosen desires, purposes, and plans.\\" On the contrary, the Declaration proclaims that the Church \\"is solely Christ's property, and that it lives and wants to live solely from his comfort and from his direction in the expectation of his appearance.\\" (8.17) Rejecting domestication of the Word in the Church, the Declaration points to the inalienable Lordship of Jesus Christ by the Spirit and to the external character of church unity which \\"can come only from the Word of God in faith through the Holy Spirit. Thus alone is the Church renewed\\" (8.01). :8.04 Try the spirits whether they are of God! Prove also the words of the Confessional Synod of the German Evangelical Church to see whether they agree with Holy Scripture and with the Confessions of the Fathers. If you find that we are speaking contrary to Scripture, then do not listen to us! But if you find that we are taking our stand upon Scripture, then let no fear or temptation keep you from treading with us the path of faith and obedience to the Word of God, in order that God's people be of one mind upon earth and that we in faith experience what he himself has said: \\"I will never leave you, nor forsake you.\\" Therefore, \\"Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. The Declaration was mostly written by the Reformed theologian Karl Barth but underwent modification, especially with the introduction of its fifth article (on the two kingdoms), as a result of input from several Lutheran theologians. The document became the chief confessional document of the so-called Confessing Church. The ecumenical nature of the Declaration can be seen by its inclusion in the Book of Confessions of the Presbyterian Church (USA) and the Book of Order of the worldwide Moravian Unity, the Unitas Fratrum. One of the main purposes of the Declaration was to establish a three-church confessional consensus opposing pro-Nazi \\"German Christianity\\". These three churches were Lutheran, Reformed, and United.

The quartet has sold over 4 million records. Creation Bond was formed following initial conversations between music producer Mike Batt and promoter Mel Bush, after Batt suggested to Bush that the two of them should put together a quartet consisting of \\"four beautiful, talented musicians\\".Mike Batt's Official Website: Bond ‚Äì String Quartet. Accessed 23 March 2009 Some time later, Bush pushed ahead with the idea, recruiting producer Gareth Cousins to help choose the line up and define the band's sound. This resulted in an initial four recordings the band made, leading to Bond being signed by Decca. Three of those original recordings, \\"Duel\\", \\"The 1812\\" and \\"Dalalai\\", were the backbone of the first album, Born, with producer Magnus Fiennes providing additional tracks and Mike Batt adding a remix of \\"Victory\\", which became the first single. The quartet currently consists of Tania Davis (first violin, formerly viola, from Sydney, Australia), Eos Counsell (second violin, from Cardiff, Wales), Elspeth Hanson (viola, from Upper Basildon, England) and Gay-Yee Westerhoff (cello, from Hull, England). Hanson replaced original band member Haylie Ecker (formerly first violin and from Perth, Australia), who left in 2008 to have a child. Genre and success Their d√©but album Born was removed from the UK classical chart, apparently owing to its \\"sounding too much like pop music\\"\\". Born later rose to #1 on 21 charts around the world. Shine, their second album, went gold in six countries. Remixed featured remixes from their first two albums as well as three new pieces. Their third studio album Classified' went double platinum in Australia, reaching the number one spot on both the classical and pop charts. Explosive: The Best of Bond is a \\"Best of\\" that, again, included three unreleased pieces.. Appearances and recent work Bond performing at the Metrocentre, Gateshead in promotion of the Peugeot 308CC The quartet spent much of 2003 touring, particularly throughout Asia, and participating in the Miss Universe 2003 held in Panama City, Panama. They also fitted in performing and filming a TV commercial for American department store chain Marshall Field's and made a commercial in Los Angeles for the Japanese karaoke manufacturer Daiichi Kosho. The group made their movie debut playing themselves in a scene in Rowan Atkinson's James Bond spoof Johnny English for which they also contributed the track \\"Kismet\\" (composed by Westerhoff) and played on the Main Theme. They also appeared as themselves in the film XXX: State of the Union, performing \\"Victory\\". The classical violinist Andr√© Rieu and the Johann Strauss Orchestra performed live on New Year's Eve in Vienna in a set that includes many Strauss favorites, as well as an appearance from Bond performing \\"Victory\\". In 2009, Peugeot commissioned Bond to record Vivaldi's \\"Four Seasons\\" to advertise the 308CC. All four members of the band helped arrange these tracks. The tracks were available for download from Peugeot's website free of charge, with \\"Summer\\" and \\"Winter\\" also appearing on Bond's album Play. In an interview of Tania Davis by the Birmingham Mail, Davis revealed that they were currently working on their next studio album. She also noted that the next album would have Gypsy, Folk and Eastern European influences. In late 2010 the band started to perform new material from their new album \\"Play\\" at concerts in Mexico, including the new single \\"Diablo\\". Songs on the album include their first single, titled \\"Diablo\\". It is characterized by an up-tempo beat, and features Bond's own Eos Counsell as vocalist in the song. The string quartet also showcases Jai Ho, a huge hit from the movie Slumdog Millionaire. The album also features a few more recognizable hits, such as the song \\"Pump It\\", a version of the Dick Dale and His Del Tones' hit song \\"Miserlou\\", featured in the opening credits of Pulp Fiction. The song \\"Last Time\\" is an interpretation of the song Bitter Sweet Symphony by the band The Verve. Members of Bond have also written their own tracks on the album. Gay-Yee Westerhoff wrote the song \\"Beatroot\\", which is strongly Russian influenced (noticeable by a clarinet improvising over the strings). According to the band's webpage, the group recorded a medley of Lady Gaga hits at the request of its Japanese label. The Lady Gaga medley was available initially by phone download and was released digitally, soon after, as part of a special Japanese album release. Bond also performed \\"I Am the Walrus\\" alongside Russell Brand at the 2012 Olympics Closing Ceremony. They returned to the Olympic Stadium in London in July 2013 to perform at The National Lottery Anniversary Run event. A team consisting of the 4 remaining members of Bond, and composer David Arnold (according to the BBC, including because he has composed music for James Bond movies), competed in and won an episode of Celebrity Eggheads first aired on BBC2 on Thursday 1 June 2017, winning a ¬£20,000 prize for charity as a result. Bond performed the Australian National Anthem at the Australia versus New Zealand match of the 2013 Rugby Championship in Sydney, 17 August.

Noted for its resistance to being pulled apart (tensile strength), the dovetail joint is commonly used to join the sides of a drawer to the front. A series of 'pins' cut to extend from the end of one board interlock with a series of 'tails' cut into the end of another board. The pins and tails have a trapezoidal shape. Once glued, a wooden dovetail joint requires no mechanical fasteners. History The dovetail joint technique probably pre-dates written history. Some of the earliest known examples of the dovetail joint are in ancient Egyptian furniture entombed with mummies dating from First Dynasty, the tombs of Chinese emperors, and a stone pillar at the Vazhappally Maha Siva Temple in India. The dovetail design is an important method of distinguishing various periods of furniture. In Europe, the dovetail joint is sometimes called a swallowtail joint, a culvertail joint (' also means ‚Äòdove‚Äô), or a fantail joint.  Methods  The dovetail joint is very strong because of the way the 'tails' and 'pins' are shaped. This makes it difficult to pull the joint apart and virtually impossible when glue is added. This type of joint is used in box constructions such as drawers, jewellery boxes, cabinets and other pieces of furniture where strength is required. It is a difficult joint to make manually, requiring skilled workmanship. There are different types of dovetail joints. The angle of slope varies according to the wood used, purpose of joint and type of work. Typically the slope is 1:6 for softwoods, and a shallower 1:8 slope for hardwoods. Often a slope of 1:7 is used as a compromise. However, a different slope does not affect the strength of the joint in different types of wood. Types of dovetails=Through dovetail A through dovetail joint The image at the top of this page shows a 'through dovetail' (also known as 'plain dovetail') joint, where the end grain of both boards is visible when the joint is assembled. Through dovetails are common in carcass and box construction. Traditionally, the dovetails would have often been covered by a veneer. However, dovetails have become a signature of craftsmanship and are generally considered a feature, so they are rarely concealed in contemporary work. When used in drawer construction, a through (or blind, mitred, or lapped) dovetail joint is sometimes referred to as an \\"English dovetail.\\" Half-blind dovetail A half-blind dovetail joint Craftsmen use a 'half-blind dovetail' when they do not want the end grain visible from the front of the joint. The tails fit into mortises in the ends of the board that is the front of the item, hiding their ends. Half-blind dovetails are commonly used to fasten drawer fronts to drawer sides. This is an alternative to the practice of attaching false fronts to drawers constructed using through dovetails. Secret mitred dovetail A secret mitred dovetail joint The 'secret mitred dovetail' joint (also called a 'mitred blind dovetail', 'full-blind dovetail', or 'full-blind mitred dovetail') is used in the highest class of cabinet and box work. It offers the strength found in the dovetail joint but is totally hidden from both outside faces by forming the outer edge to meet at a 45-degree angle while hiding the dovetails internally within the joint. The mitred corner dovetail joint is very similar in design, but it has just a single dovetail and is used for picture frames and other similar joins. Secret double-lapped dovetail The secret double-lapped dovetail is similar to the secret mitred dovetail, but presents a very thin section of end grain on one edge of the joint. Used for carcass and box construction to hide the dovetails completely from view. Sliding dovetail A sliding dovetail joint The sliding dovetail is a method of joining two boards at right angles, where the intersection occurs within the field of one of the boards, that is not at the end. This joint provides the interlocking strength of a dovetail. Sliding dovetails are assembled by sliding the tail into the socket. It is common to slightly taper the socket, making it slightly tighter towards the rear of the joint, so that the two components can be slid together easily but the joint becomes tighter as the finished position is reached. Another method to implement a tapered sliding dovetail is to taper the tail instead of the socket. When used in drawer construction, a \\"stopped sliding dovetail\\" that does not extend across the full width of the board is sometimes referred to as a \\"French dovetail\\". Used for: * Joining shelves to cabinet sides * Joining cabinet bottoms to sides * Joining horizontal partitions to shelves * Joining adjacent sections of expandable table frames * Joining drawer fronts to sides * Joining front rails of web frames to cabinet sides * Joining neck and body in violins and some guitars.  Non-woodworking dovetails  Cast iron dovetail joints in the Iron Bridge, Shropshire Dovetails are most commonly, but not exclusively, used in woodworking. Other areas of use are: *Dovetail slides, for example on a lathe. *Attaching turbine blades to the shaft in jet engines and other applications. *Clockmaking: dovetailing a new tooth, when replacing broken teeth in clock gears. *Masonry: dovetail construction is regarded a major step forward in the design of lighthouses meant for particularly dangerous areas; the Eddystone Lighthouse and Fastnet Lighthouse are examples of the durable quality of dovetail masonry. *3D printing: dovetail is commonly used to overcome physical object print size limitation of a 3D printer. *Iron sights on firearms may be affixed via a dovetail rail to the receiver or slide.

It is unusual because it is Y-shaped, in contrast to the long and narrow shape of the other Finger Lakes. Because of its shape, it was referred to in the past as Crooked Lake. Keuka means \\"canoe landing\\" in the Iroquois language and \\"lake with an elbow\\" in the Seneca language. Description Map showing Keuka Lake and the other Finger Lakes in relation to Lake Ontario and upstate New York The Y-shaped Keuka Lake empties into another Finger Lake, Seneca Lake, through a stream called Keuka Lake Outlet at the lake's northeastern end in Penn Yan. The stream empties into Seneca Lake at the village of Dresden. At one time the outlet was developed into a canal, the Crooked Lake Canal, connecting the lakes. This canal was later replaced by a railroad branch line which is now a hiking and cycling trail. The lake is about long and varies in width from to . It has a surface area of , and a maximum and mean depth of and respectively. Its thermocline is between deep. Ecology This body of water possesses large and healthy populations of lake trout, brown trout, rainbow trout, landlocked salmon, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, and yellow perch. The productive fishery is supported by huge numbers of baitfish, most notably alewives (sawbellies), and is a very popular lake with area fishermen. Humans, fish, and wildlife depend on the rich ecology of the lake habitat. The complex ecosystem is subject to contamination of the watershed, largely by storm water runoff. The Keuka Lake Association (KLA) monitors the water of the lake to ensure that it is suitable for its many uses, such as drinking, fishing, and swimming. Tributary streams, groundwater, and the lake itself are regularly tested for water quality. Additionally, KLA collects and publishes data about the lake level. The infestation of European zebra mussels, which has impacted many North American bodies of water, has also affected Keuka Lake and other Finger Lakes in New York. In addition to disrupting the lake's ecosystem, zebra mussels can be a nuisance to lakeside homeowners. Their small size enables them to clog water intake pipes.Locations with Zebra Mussels Furthermore, their sharp shells can cause lacerations on the feet of bathers. Bathers may wish to wear water shoes when swimming in the lake. Surroundings William E. \\"Gink\\" Doherty coaxes the structurally modified Langley Aerodrome into the air above the surface of Keuka Lake near Hammondsport, New York in 1914. The village of Penn Yan is at the northeastern tip of the lake, and Branchport is at the northwestern tip. Hammondsport lies at the south end of the lake. Hammondsport was the home of Glenn Curtiss, a pioneer of naval aviation, and is now the site of the Glenn H. Curtiss Museum. While the shore of the lake is primarily residential, Keuka College is located in Keuka Park on the western shore of the east branch and Keuka Lake State Park is located on the eastern side of the northwest branch of the lake. Camp Iroquois, run by the New York State Sheriffs Institute, is located on the eastern side of the bluff. YMCA Camp Cory is located on the eastern side of the northeast branch of the lake. Camp Good Days and Special Times is located on the western side of the northwest branch of the lake.

It was created in 1800 for the diplomat James Harris, 1st Baron Malmesbury. The son of the grammarian and politician James Harris, he served as Ambassador to Spain, Prussia, Russia and France and also represented Christchurch in the House of Commons. Harris had already been created Baron Malmesbury, of Malmesbury in the County of Wiltshire, in 1788, and was made Viscount FitzHarris, of Hurn Court in the County of Southampton, at the same time he was given the earldom. The earldom and viscountcy were the last creations in the peerage of Great Britain, future titles being made in the peerage of the United Kingdom which took effect three days later. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He sat as Member of Parliament for Helston, Horsham, Heytesbury and Wilton. His eldest son, the third Earl, was a prominent Conservative politician. He served as Foreign Secretary in 1852 and from 1858 to 1859 and was also Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Lords. Lord Malmesbury died childless and was succeeded by his nephew, the fourth Earl. He was the son of Admiral the Hon. Sir Edward Harris, second son of the second Earl. His eldest son, the fifth Earl, served as a Lord-in-waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) from 1922 to 1924 in the Conservative administrations of Bonar Law and Stanley Baldwin and was later Chairman of the Hampshire County Council. He was succeeded by his only son, the sixth Earl. He was Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire from 1973 to 1982. As of 2010 the titles are held by his only son, the seventh Earl, who succeeded in 2000. Two other members of the Harris family have also gained distinction. The aforementioned the Hon. Sir Edward Harris (1808‚Äì1888), second son of the second Earl, was an admiral in the Royal Navy, held several diplomatic posts and represented Christchurch in Parliament. The Right Reverend the Hon. Charles Amyand Harris (1813‚Äì1874), third son of the second Earl, was a clergyman and served as Bishop of Gibraltar from 1868 to 1873.

It was created in 1621 for Richard Nugent, Baron Delvin. During the Tudor era the loyalty of the Nugent family was often in question, and Richard's father, the sixth Baron, died in prison while awaiting trial for treason. Richard himself when young was suspected of plotting rebellion and imprisoned, but in later life was a staunch supporter of the Crown, which rewarded him richly for his loyalty. The fifth Earl was a Major-General in the British Army. The sixth Earl was sworn of the Irish Privy Council in 1758. His son by his first wife, Richard Nugent, Lord Delvin, was killed in a duel at an early age. Lord Westmeath was succeeded by his second son by his second wife, the seventh Earl.

He was succeeded by his son, the eighth Earl. He was created Marquess of Westmeath in the Peerage of Ireland in 1822. He had no surviving male issue and the marquessate became extinct on his death in 1871. He was succeeded in the barony and earldom by his kinsman, Anthony Francis Nugent, the ninth Earl. The eleventh Earl was an Irish Representative Peer from 1901 to 1933.

The area includes restaurants, shops and art galleries but also has a residential neighborhood with a low-income, aging population of about 20,000 residents. The original Chinatown developed in the late 19th century, but it was demolished to make room for Union Station, the city's major ground-transportation center.Angels Walk‚ÄìUnion Station/El Pueblo/Little Tokyo/Center, published by Angels Walk LA, 2000Chinatown Los Angeles California, Restaurants in Chinatown, Pictures of Chinatown A separate commercial center, known as \\"New Chinatown,\\" opened for business in 1938. Street and natural limits of the Chinatown neighborhood are: north, Beaudry Avenue, Stadium Way, North Broadway; east, the Los Angeles River; and southwest, Cesar Chavez Avenue. \\"Chinatown,\\" Mapping L.A., Los Angeles TimesThe Thomas Guide, Los Angeles County 2006, page 634 Chinatown beyond the concentrated business center is flanked by the Elysian Park to the north, Lincoln Heights to the east, Downtown to the south and southwest and Echo Park to the west and northwest. There are two schools and a branch library in Chinatown, as well as a city park and a state park. Many motion pictures have been filmed in the area. History Chinatown can refer to one of three locations near downtown Los Angeles. What is now known as Old Chinatown refers to the original location on Alameda and Macy (1880s‚Äì1933). Old Chinatown was displaced by the construction of Union Station, and two competing Chinatowns were built in the late 1930s north of Old Chinatown to replace it: China City (1938‚Äì1948) and New Chinatown (1938‚Äìpresent). China City was rebuilt just one year after opening due to a suspicious fire, but another fire in 1948 put it out of business for good. Old Chinatown Chinese Quarter, ca. 1885, by Archduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria In the early 1860s, thousands of Chinese men, most of them originating from Guangdong province in southern China, were hired by Central Pacific Railroad Co. to work on the western portion of the first transcontinental railroad. Many of them settled in Los Angeles. In the Chinese massacre of 1871, 19 Chinese men and boys were killed by a mob of about 500 men in an area of Los Angeles known as Negro Alley which had been known as a dangerous area for two decades. It was one of the most serious incidents of racial violence that has ever occurred in the American West.. The first Chinatown, centered on Alameda and Macy Streets (now Cesar Chavez Avenue), was established in 1880.Watanabe, Teresa (August 3, 2008). First lady puts Thai Town on the map. Los Angeles Times. Reaching its heyday from 1890 to 1910, Chinatown grew to approximately fifteen streets and alleys containing some two hundred buildings. It boasted a Chinese Opera theater, three temples, a newspaper and a telephone exchange. But laws prohibiting most Chinese from citizenship and property ownership, as well as legislation curtailing immigration, inhibited future growth.See, Lisa (2003). Angels Walk - Chinatown. Angels Walk LA. From the early 1910s, Chinatown began to decline. Symptoms of a corrupt Los Angeles discolored the public's view of Chinatown; gambling houses, opium dens and a fierce tong warfare severely reduced business in the area. As tenants and lessees rather than outright owners, the residents of Old Chinatown were threatened with impending redevelopment, and as a result the owners neglected upkeep of their buildings. Eventually, the entire area was sold and then resold, as entrepreneurs and developers fought over the area. After thirty years of decay, a Supreme Court ruling approved condemnation of the area to allow for construction of a major rail terminal, Union Station. Residents were evicted to make room for Union Station without a plan for the relocation of the Chinatown community. Chinatown was gradually demolished, leaving many businesses without a place to do business and forcing some to close. A remnant of Old Chinatown persisted into the early 1950s, situated between Union Station and the Old Plaza. Several businesses and a Buddhist temple lined Ferguson Alley, a narrow one-block street running between the Plaza and Alameda. The most notable of the surviving buildings was the old Lugo house, having been built in 1838 by the prominent Californio family. Some decades later, the Lugo house became the original home of Loyola Marymount University, and later, it was rented to Chinese-Americans who ran shops on the ground floor and a lodging house upstairs. Christine Sterling, who had brought to fruition the Olvera Street and China City projects, argued that remaining buildings of Old Chinatown were an eyesore and advocated successfully for the razing of all the remaining structures between the Plaza and Union Station. \\"The original Chinatown's only remaining edifice is the two-story Garnier Building, once a residence and meeting place for immigrant Chinese,\\" according to Angels Walk ‚Äì Union Station/El Pueblo/Little Tokyo/Civic Center guide book. The Chinese American Museum is now situated in the Garnier Building. Seven years passed before an acceptable relocation proposal was put into place, situating a new Chinatown in its present location. In the late 1950s the covenants on the use and ownership of property were removed, allowing Chinese Americans to live in other neighborhoods and gain access to new types of employment. China City Ricsha ride concession, China City (1938) Christine Sterling, who worked on the conversion of a neglected street into the Mexican-themed Olvera Street, conceived of a similar plan for the displaced Chinese American population. In 1938, she opened China City, a walled enclave bounded by Main, Ord, Spring, and Macy (now Cesar Chavez), featuring Chinese-style architecture, restaurants, shops, rickshaw rides, a lotus pond, and a temple. Costumed workers greeted tourists, and a Chinese opera troupe performed live shows in front of the shops. Some replica buildings in China City came from the set of the 1937 Hollywood blockbuster, The Good Earth. China City received mixed support from Chinese American residents and businessmen. Many welcomed the economic opportunity the project provided. Others preferred the New Chinatown project, considered less distorted by the stereotyping lens of Hollywood. During its eleven-year existence, China City was destroyed by fire and rebuilt numerous times. In 1949, an act of arson destroyed China City. Little Italy The neighborhood that has become Chinatown was formerly Sonoratown and then Little Italy. In the early 20th century, Italian immigrants settled in the area north of the Old Plaza. Many built businesses, including wineries (San Antonio Winery is still in existence). The Italian American Museum of Los Angeles in the El Pueblo de Los √Ångeles Historical Monument opened in 2016. New Chinatown In the 1930s, under the efforts of Chinese-American community leader Peter Soo Hoo Sr., the design and operational concepts for a New Chinatown evolved through a collective community process, resulting in a blend of Chinese and American architecture. The Los Angeles Chinatown saw major development, especially as a tourist attraction, throughout the 1930s, with the development of the \\"Central Plaza,\\" a Hollywoodized version of Shanghai, containing names such as Bamboo Lane, Gin Ling Way and Chung King Road (named after the city of Chongqing in mainland China). Chinatown was designed by Hollywood film set designers, and a \\"Chinese\\" movie prop was subsequently donated by film director Cecil B. DeMille to give Chinatown an exotic atmosphere.

Demographics The 2010 U.S. census counted 20,913 residents in the 0.91-square-mile Chinatown neighborhood, excluding the population of the Los Angeles County Jail complex. That made an average of 9,650 people per square mile, which included the empty Cornfield area. The ethnic breakdown in 2010: Asian, 68.8%; Latino, 14.7%; blacks, 6.7%; whites, 8.7%; mixed race, 0.8%; and others, 2.3%. The median household income in 2010 dollars ($29,000), was the third-lowest in Los Angeles County, preceded by Watts ($28,200) and Downtown ($24,300). The percentage of households earning $20,000 or less (53.6%) was the third-largest in Los Angeles County, preceded by Downtown (57.4%) and University Park (56.6%). The average household size of 2.8 people was just about the city norm. Renters occupied 91% of the housing units, and home- or apartment owners the rest. Education Just 11.7% of Chinatown residents aged 25 and older possessed a four-year degree in 2010, the sixth-least in Los Angeles County. Schools There are three schools operating within Chinatown. They are: \\"Chinatown Schools,\\" Mapping L.A., Los Angeles Times * Endeavor College Preparatory Charter School, middle, 126 Bloom Street * Castelar Street Elementary School, LAUSD, 840 Yale Street * Cathedral High School, a private Catholic boys' school, just down the hill from Dodger Stadium, is located on the north side of Chinatown. * Evans Community Adult School - largest stand- alone ESL adult school in the nation Library Los Angeles Public Library operates the Chinatown Branch. Businesses=Retail Small, specialized grocery stores are important to the aging population but few remain as gentrification impacts the neighborhood. The Chinese-Vietnamese residents own many bazaars. The stores sell products such as soap, toys, clothes, music CDs at low prices. Several restaurants in Chinatown serve mainly Cantonese cuisine but there are also various Asian cuisine restaurants such as Teochew Chinese, Vietnamese, Indonesian, and Thai, which reflects the diverse character of Chinatown. Few boba cafes have opened in Chinatown, but a large number are to be found in the Chinese enclaves in the San Gabriel Valley. A feng shui spiral at Chinatown's Metro station TS Emporium and Tin Bo are stores selling ginseng and herbs as well as other household merchandises are operated within the confinement of this particular Chinatown. Dynasty Center, Saigon Plaza, and the Chinatown Phuoc Loc Tho Center feature many Vietnamese-style bazaars with people engaged in bargain shopping for items such as clothing, toys, Chinese- language CDs, pets, household items, funerary products, and so on. Its entrepreneurs are ethnic Chinese from Vietnam. There are over 20 art galleries to see, mostly featuring non-Chinese modern art, with works from up and coming artists in all types of media. Popular galleries include Acuna-Hansen Gallery, Black Dragon Society, China Art Objects, and The Gallery at General Lee's. Spaces such as Telic Art Exchange, Betalevel and The Mountain Bar often have readings, performances and lectures. Restaurants Chinatown is in the process of becoming an entirely new place. Chinatown at the height of popularity was filled with bustling Chinese restaurants that included barbecue delicatessens with glass displays of roast duck and suckling pig and Cantonese seafood restaurants with dim sum. As the action in Chinese cuisine became centered in the San Gabriel Valley, southeast Asian eating places filled some of the empty spaces and offered Vietnamese pho noodle soup and submarine sandwiches called banh mi. As downtown revives, Chinatown has been sparked into life by cheap rents, the gallery boom in the 2000s and deep-rooted sense of community.Betty Hallock (August 24, 2013) \\"George Yu hungers to bring new restaurants to Chinatown\\" Los Angeles Times Chinese bakeries and other shops continue to serve the area.Gold, Jonathan (January 16, 2015) \\"Chinatown emerging as L.A.'s hottest restaurant destination\\" Los Angeles Times Traditional Chinese restaurants that have remained are being joined by a variety of new restaurants as the opportunities Chinatown offers is recognized by additional restaurateurs.Betty Hallock (June 4, 2013) \\"Chinatown dim sum palace Empress Pavilion evicted, closes doors after almost 25 years\\", Los Angeles Times The area is better served by transit than many areas with Union Station so close by.

Retrieved 30 Nov 2016. Tholins are disordered polymer-like materials made of repeating chains of linked subunits and complex combinations of functional groups. Tholins do not form naturally on modern-day Earth, but they are found in great abundance on the surfaces of icy bodies in the outer Solar System, and as reddish aerosols in the atmosphere of outer Solar System planets and moons. In the presence of water, tholins can be raw materials for prebiotic chemistry, i.e. the non-living chemistry that forms the basic chemicals which form life. Their existence has implications for the origins of life on Earth, and possibly on other planets. As particles in an atmosphere, tholins scatter light, and can affect habitability. Overview The term \\"tholin\\" was coined by astronomer Carl Sagan and his colleague Bishun Khare to describe the difficult-to- characterize substances they obtained in his Miller-Urey-type experiments on the methane-containing gas mixtures such as those found in Titan's atmosphere. Their paper proposing the name \\"tholin\\" said: > For the past decade we have been producing in our laboratory a variety of > complex organic solids from mixtures of the cosmically abundant gases , , , > , HCHO, and . The product, synthesized by ultraviolet (UV) light or spark > discharge, is a brown, sometimes sticky, residue, which has been called, > because of its resistance to conventional analytical chemistry, \\"intractable > polymer\\".

An example of one polymeric component thought to be present in tholins Tholins are not one specific compound but rather are descriptive of a spectrum of molecules, including heteropolymers,A Bit of Titan on Earth Helps in the Search for Life's Origins. Lori Stiles, University of Arizona. 19 October 2004. that give a reddish, organic surface covering on certain planetary surfaces. Tholins are disordered polymer-like materials made of repeating chains of linked subunits and complex combinations of functional groups. Sagan and Khare note \\"The properties of tholins will depend on the energy source used and the initial abundances of precursors, but a general physical and chemical similarity among the various tholins is evident.\\" Some researchers in the field prefer a narrowed definition of tholins, for example S. H√∂rst wrote: \\"Personally, I try to use the word 'tholins' only when describing the laboratory-produced samples, in part because we do not really know yet how similar the material we produce in the lab is to the material found on places like Titan or Triton (or Pluto!).\\" French researchers also use the term tholins only when describing the laboratory-produced samples as analogues. NASA scientists also prefer the word 'tholin' for the products of laboratory simulations, and use the term 'refractory residues' for actual observations on astronomical bodies. Formation The formation of tholins in the atmosphere of Titan Tholins may be a major constituent of the interstellar medium. On Titan, their chemistry is initiated at high altitudes and participates in the formation of solid organic particles. Their key elements are carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen. Laboratory infrared spectroscopy analysis of experimentally synthetized tholins has confirmed earlier identifications of chemical groups present, including primary amines, nitriles, and alkyl portions such as / forming complex disordered macromolecular solids. Laboratory tests generated complex solids formed from exposure of : gaseous mixtures to electrical discharge in cold plasma conditions, reminiscent of the famous Miller‚ÄìUrey experiment conducted in 1952. As illustrated to the right, tholins are thought to form in nature through a chain of chemical reactions known as pyrolysis and radiolysis. This begins with the dissociation and ionization of molecular nitrogen () and methane () by energetic particles and solar radiation. This is followed by the formation of ethylene, ethane, acetylene, hydrogen cyanide, and other small simple molecules and small positive ions. Further reactions form benzene and other organic molecules, and their polymerization leads to the formation of an aerosol of heavier molecules, which then condense and precipitate on the planetary surface below. Tholins formed at low pressure tend to contain nitrogen atoms in the interior of their molecules, while tholins formed at high pressure are more likely to have nitrogen atoms located in terminal positions. These atmospherically-derived substances are distinct from ice tholin II, which are formed instead by irradiation (radiolysis) of clathrates of water and organic compounds such as methane () or ethane (). The radiation-induced synthesis on ice are non-dependant on temperature. Biological significance Some researchers have speculated that Earth may have been seeded by organic compounds early in its development by tholin-rich comets, providing the raw material necessary for life to develop (see Miller‚ÄìUrey experiment for discussion related to this). Tholins do not exist naturally on present-day Earth due to the oxidizing properties of the free oxygen component of its atmosphere ever since the Great Oxygenation Event around 2.4 billion years ago. Laboratory experiments suggest that tholins near large pools of liquid water that might persist for thousands of years could facilitate the formation of prebiotic chemistry to take place, and has implications on the origins of life on Earth and possibly other planets. Also, as particles in the atmosphere of an exoplanet, tholins affect the light scatter and act as a screen for protecting planetary surfaces from ultraviolet radiation, affecting habitability. Laboratory simulations found derived residues related to amino acids as well as urea, with important astrobiological implications. On Earth, a wide variety of soil bacteria are able to use laboratory-produced tholins as their sole source of carbon. Tholins could have been the first microbial food for heterotrophic microorganisms before autotrophy evolved. Occurrence Huygens lander. Tholins are suspected to be the source of the reddish color of both the surface and the atmospheric haze. Sagan and Khare note the presence of tholins through multiple locations: \\"as a constituent of the Earth's primitive oceans and therefore relevant to the origin of life; as a component of red aerosols in the atmospheres of the outer planets and Titan; present in comets, carbonaceous chondrites asteroids, and pre-planetary solar nebulae; and as a major constituent of the interstellar medium.\\" The surfaces of comets, centaurs, and many icy moons and Kuiper-belt objects in the outer Solar System are rich in deposits of tholins. MoonsTitan= Titan tholins are nitrogen-rich organic substances produced by the irradiation of the gaseous mixtures of nitrogen and methane found in the atmosphere and surface of Titan. Titan's atmosphere is about 97% nitrogen, 2.7¬±0.1% methane and the remaining trace amounts of other gases. In the case of Titan, the haze and orange-red color of its atmosphere are both thought to be caused by the presence of tholins. =Europa= Linear fractures on Europa's surface, likely colored by tholins. Colored regions on Jupiter's satellite Europa are thought to be tholins. The morphology of Europa's impact craters and ridges is suggestive of fluidized material welling up from the fractures where pyrolysis and radiolysis take place. In order to generate colored tholins on Europa there must be a source of materials (carbon, nitrogen, and water) and a source of energy to make the reactions occur. Impurities in the water ice crust of Europa are presumed both to emerge from the interior as cryovolcanic events that resurface the body, and to accumulate from space as interplanetary dust. =Rhea= Rhea is covered with tholins.

Tholins are not typically characteristic of main- belt asteroids, but have been detected on the asteroid 24 Themis. Tholins beyond the Solar System Tholins might have also been detected in the stellar system of the young star HR 4796A using the Near-Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. The HR 4796 system is approximately 220 light years from Earth. Models show that even when far from UV radiation of a star, cosmic ray doses may be fully sufficient to convert carbon-containing ice grains entirely to complex organics in less than the lifetime of the typical interstellar cloud.

He was also known as Zurab Davidovich Avalov in a Russian manner. Born in Tbilisi, Georgia (then part of the Russian Empire), into the family of Prince David Avalishvili, he graduated from St. Petersburg University in 1900 and took post-graduate courses at the Department of Law, University of Paris from 1900 to 1903. He became a Docent at the St. Petersburg University in 1904 and a Professor of Public Law at the St. Petersburg Polytechnical Institute in 1907. He was an official adviser to the Russian Ministry of Trade and Commerce for many years. After the February Revolution in Russia, Avalishvili was named a Senator by the Provisional Government in May 1917. When Georgia declared independence on May 26, 1918, Avalishvili entered Georgian diplomatic service and was appointed a Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. He rendered important services to his homeland as a member of her delegation to the 1919 Paris Peace Conference. The Red Army invasion of Georgia forced him into exile in March 1921. He lived thereafter in Germany where he worked as a Professor at the University of Munich. He was one of the founding members of the Georgian Association in Germany and worked for the editorial boards of historical journals Georgica (London) and Byzantion (Brussels). He died in 1944, in Germany, and was reburied to Didube Pantheon, Tbilisi, in 1994. Avalishvili‚Äôs main works focuses on the history of Georgia and the Caucasus, Georgian literature (e.g., the critical studies of Shota Rustaveli), international law and Georgia‚Äôs foreign relations.

The scientific name Crotalus is derived from the Greek Œ∫œÅœåœÑŒ±ŒªŒøŒΩ, meaning \\"castanet\\". The name Sistrurus is the Latinized form of the Greek word for \\"tail rattler\\" (Œ£ŒµŒØœÉœÑœÅŒøœÖœÅŒøœÇ, seistrouros) and shares its root with the ancient Egyptian musical instrument the sistrum, a type of rattle. The 36 known species of rattlesnakes have between 65 and 70 subspecies,Barceloux, 2008: p. 1026 all native to the Americas, ranging from southern Alberta, Saskatchewan, and southern British Columbia in Canada to central Argentina. Rattlesnakes are predators that live in a wide array of habitats, hunting small animals such as birds and rodents. Rattlesnakes receive their name from the rattle located at the end of their tails, which makes a loud rattling noise when vibrated that deters predators or serves as a warning to passers-by. However, rattlesnakes fall prey to hawks, weasels, king snakes, and a variety of other species. Rattlesnakes are heavily preyed upon as neonates, while they are still weak and immature. Large numbers of rattlesnakes are killed by humans. Rattlesnake populations in many areas are severely threatened by habitat destruction, poaching, and extermination campaigns. Rattlesnakes are the leading contributor to snakebite injuries in North America. However, rattlesnakes rarely bite unless provoked or threatened; if treated promptly, the bites are seldom fatal. Ecology=Range and habitat Western diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox), responsible for the majority of venomous snakebites in North America, coiled in defensive posture with rattle erect Rattlesnakes are native to the Americas, living in diverse habitats from southwestern Canada to central Argentina. The large majority of species lives in the American Southwest and Mexico. Four species may be found east of the Mississippi River, and two in South America. In the United States, the states with the most types of rattlesnakes are Texas and Arizona. Rattlesnakes are found in almost every type of habitat capable of supporting terrestrial ectothermic vertebrates, but individual species can have extremely specific habitat requirements, only able to live within certain plant associations in a narrow range of altitudes. Most species live near open, rocky areas. Rocks offer them cover from predators, plentiful prey (e.g. rodents, lizards, insects, etc. that live amidst the rocks), and open basking areas. However, rattlesnakes can also be found in a wide variety of other habitats including prairies, marshes, deserts, and forests.Rubio, 1998: p. 24 Rattlesnakes prefer a temperature range between 80 and 90 ¬∞F (26 and 32 ¬∞C), but can survive temperatures below freezing, recovering from brief exposure to temperatures as low as 4 ¬∞F (‚àí16 ¬∞C), and surviving for several days in temperatures as low as 37 ¬∞F (3 ¬∞C).Rubio, 1998: p. 71 The most probable ancestral area of rattlesnakes is the Sierra Madre Occidental region in Mexico. The most probable vegetation or habitat of the ancestral area appears to be pine-oak forests. Feeding habits play an important ecological role by limiting the size of rodent populations, which prevents crop damage and stabilizes ecosystems.Rubio, 1998: pp. 161, 163 Prey Rattlesnakes consume mice, rats, small birds , and other small animals.Klauber, 1997: p. 612 They lie in wait for their prey, or hunt for it in holes.Klauber, 1997: p. 387 The prey is killed quickly with a venomous bite as opposed to constriction. If the bitten prey moves away before dying, the rattlesnake can follow it by its scent.Klauber, 1997: p. 834 When it locates the fallen prey, it checks for signs of life by prodding with its snout, flicking its tongue, and using its sense of smell. Once the prey has become incapacitated, the rattlesnake locates its head by odors emitted from the mouth. The prey is then ingested head-first, which allows wings and limbs to fold at the joints in a manner which minimizes the girth of the meal.Rubio, 1998: p. 81 The gastric fluids of rattlesnakes are extremely powerful, allowing for the digestion of flesh, as well as bone. Optimal digestion occurs when the snake maintains a body temperature between 80 and 85 ¬∞F (25 and 29 ¬∞C). If the prey is small, the rattlesnake often continues hunting. If it was an adequate meal, the snake finds a warm, safe location in which to coil up and rest until the prey is digested.Rubio, 1998: p. 83 Hydration Rattlesnakes are believed to require at least their own body weight in water annually to remain hydrated. The method in which they drink depends on the water source. In larger bodies of water (streams, ponds, etc.), they submerge their heads and ingest water by opening and closing their jaws, which sucks in water. If drinking dew, or drinking from small puddles, they sip the liquid either by capillary action or by flattening and flooding their lower jaws.Rubio, 1998: p. 87 Predators Newborn rattlesnakes are heavily preyed upon by a variety of species, including ravens, crows, roadrunners, raccoons, opossums, skunks, coyotes, weasels, whipsnakes, kingsnakes, and racers. Neonates of the smaller crotaline species are frequently killed and eaten by small predatory birds such as jays, kingfishers, and shrikes. Some species of ants in the genus Formica are known to prey upon neonates, and Solenopsis invicta (fire ants) likely do, as well. On occasion, hungry adult rattlesnakes cannibalize neonates. The small proportion (often as few as 20%) of rattlesnakes that make it to their second year are heavily preyed upon by a variety of larger predators including coyotes, eagles, hawks, owls, falcons, feral pigs, badgers, indigo snakes, and kingsnakes. The common kingsnake (Lampropeltis getula), a constrictor, is immune to the venom of rattlesnakes and other vipers, and rattlesnakes form part of its natural diet. Rattlesnakes sense kingsnakes' presence by their odor.Rubio, 1998: p. 59 -- Knowledge that rattlesnakes are so afraid of kingsnakes' odor led to the development of effective synthetic rattlesnake repellents. When they realize a kingsnake is nearby, they begin enacting a set of defensive postures known as \\"body bridging\\". Unlike its normal erect and coiled defensive-striking posture, the rattlesnake keeps its head low to the ground in an attempt to prevent the kingsnake from gaining a hold on it (the head being the first part of the rattlesnake to be ingested). The rattlesnake jerks its body about, while bridging its back upwards, forming an elevated coil which faces the kingsnake. The elevated coil is used to strike the attacker, and is also used to shield the head from the kingsnake.Rubio, 1998: p. 59 -- This behavior is believed to be unique to crotaline species. Anatomy=Sensory organs Like all pit vipers, rattlesnakes have two organs that can sense radiation: their eyes, and a set of heat-sensing \\"pits\\" on their faces that enable them to locate prey and move towards it, based on the prey's thermal radiation signature. These pits have a relatively short effective range of about 1 ft, but give the rattlesnake a distinctive advantage in hunting for warm-blooded creatures at night.Klauber, 1997: pp.401-402Furman, 2007: p. 8 Heat sensing pits located in blue circle on a rattlesnake specimen. Location of the pit is the same in all Viperidae. thumb1. Trigeminal nerve extending into the heat sensing pit 2. Trigeminal nerve originating in the brain 3\\\\. Heat sensing pit. = Heat-sensing pits = Aside from their eyes, rattlesnakes are able to detect thermal radiation emitted by warm-blooded organisms in their environment. Functioning optically like a pinhole camera eye, thermal radiation in the form of infrared light passes through the opening of the pit and strikes the pit membrane located in the back wall, warming this part of the organ. Due to the high density of heat-sensitive receptors innervating this membrane, the rattlesnake can detect temperature changes of 0.003 ¬∞C or less in its immediate surroundings. Infrared cues from these receptors are transmitted to the brain by the trigeminal nerve, where they are used to create thermal maps of the snake's surroundings. Due to the small sizes of the pit openings, typically these thermal images are low in resolution and contrast. Nevertheless, rattlesnakes superimpose visual images created from information from the eyes with these thermal images from the pit organs to more accurately visualize their surroundings in low levels of light. Research conducted recently on the molecular mechanism of this ability suggests the temperature sensitivity of these pit organs is closely linked to the activity of transient receptor potential ankyrin 1, a temperature-sensitive ion channel saturated in the pit membrane. = Eyes = Rattlesnake eyes, which contain many rod cells, are well adapted to nocturnal use.Klauber, 1997: pp. 384-389 However, rattlesnakes are not exclusively nocturnal, and their vision is more acute during daylight conditions. Rattlesnakes also possess cone cells, which means they are capable of some form of color vision. The rattlesnake eye lacks a fovea, making it impossible for them to see sharply defined images. Instead, they mostly rely on the perception of movement.Rubio, 1998: p. 67 Rattlesnake eyes are capable of horizontal rotation, but they do not appear to move their eyeballs to follow moving objects.Flaubert, 1997: pp. 384-389 = Smell = Rattlesnakes have an exceptionally keen sense of smell. They can sense olfactory stimuli both through their nostrils and by flicking their tongues, which carry scent- bearing particles to the Jacobson's organs in the roof of their mouths.Furman, 2007: p. 9 = Auditory system = Like all snakes, rattlesnakes lack external ear openings, and the structures of their middle ear are not as highly specialized as those of other vertebrates, such as mammals. Thus, their sense of hearing is not very effective, but they are capable of sensing vibrations in the ground, passed by the skeleton to the auditory nerve. Fangs Rattlesnake skull Rattlesnake fangs are connected by venom ducts to large venom glands near the outer edge of the upper jaw, towards the rear of the head. When the rattlesnake bites, muscles on the sides of the venom glands contract, which squeezes the venom through the ducts and into the fangs. When the fangs are not in use, they remain folded against the palate.Klauber, 1997: p. 773 Rattlesnakes are born with fully functioning fangs and venom, and are capable of killing prey at birth.Rubio, 1998: p. 120See also Klauber, 1997: p. 829 Adult rattlesnakes shed their fangs every 6‚Äì10 weeks. At least three pairs of replacement fangs lie behind the functional pair.Barceloux, 2008: p. 1028 Venom The venom is hemotoxic, destroying tissue, causing necrosis and coagulopathy (disrupted blood clotting). In the U.S., the tiger rattlesnake (C. tigris) and some varieties of the Mojave rattlesnake (C. scutulatus) also have a presynaptic neurotoxic venom component known as Mojave type A toxin, which can cause severe paralysis. Although it has a comparatively low venom yield,Weinstein and Smith (1990) the venom toxicity of C. tigris is considered to be among the highest of all rattlesnake venoms, and among the highest of all snakes in the Western Hemisphere based on studies conducted on laboratory mice. C. scutulatus is also widely regarded as producing one of the most toxic snake venoms in the Americas, based on studies in laboratory mice.Glenn, J.L., R.C.Straight. 1982. The rattlesnakes and their venom yield and lethal toxicity. In: Tu, A. (ed) Rattlesnake Venoms, Their Actions and Treatment. New York: Marcel Dekker, Inc. Rattlesnake venom is a mixture of five to 15 enzymes, various metal ions, biogenic amines, lipids, free amino acids, proteins, and polypeptides. It contains components evolved to immobilize and disable the prey, as well as digestive enzymes which break down tissue to prepare for later ingestion. The venom is very stable, and retains its toxicity for many years in storage. Older snakes possess more potent venom, and larger snakes are frequently capable of storing larger volumes of it. Rattle Rattlesnake rattle Drawing of the rattle Video of a timber rattlesnake shaking its rattle The rattle serves as a warning for predators of the rattlesnake.Rubio, 1998: p. 56 The rattle is composed of a series of hollow, interlocked segments made of keratin, which are created by modifying the scales that cover the tip of the tail. The contraction of special \\"shaker\\" muscles in the tail causes these segments to vibrate against one another, making the rattling noise (which is amplified because the segments are hollow) in a behavior known as tail vibration. The muscles that cause the rattle to shake are some of the fastest known, firing 50 times per second on average, sustained for up to three hours. At birth, a ‚Äúprebutton‚Äù is present at the tip of the snake's tail; it is replaced by the ‚Äúbutton‚Äù several days later when the first skin is shed. However, no sound can be made by the rattle until a second segment is added when the skin is shed again. American International Rattlesnake Museum: Rattles, (Accessed: May 4, 2012) A new rattle segment is added each time the snake sheds its skin, and the snake may shed its skin several times a year, depending on food supply and growth rate. Rattlesnakes travel with their rattles held up to protect them from damage, but in spite of this precaution, their day-to-day activities in the wild still cause them to regularly break off end segments. Because of this, the age of a rattlesnake is not related to the number of rattles on its tail. One of the differentiating features of males and females is the males have thicker and longer tails (because they contain the inverted hemipenes). Also, the tails of males taper gradually from the body, whereas the tails of females narrow abruptly at the vent.Klauber, 1997: p. 690 Skin and circulation Rattlesnakes, like other members of the Squamata order, contain a circulatory system that is powered by a three- chambered heart composed of two atria and one ventricle. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from veins coming from the systemic circuit. The left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the lungs in the pulmonary circuit and pumps it to the ventricle and through the systemic circuit via capillaries and arteries. Rattlesnake skin has a set of overlapping scales which cover the entire body, providing protection from a variety of threats including dehydration and physical trauma.Rubio, 1998: p. 48 The typical rattlesnake, genus Crotalus, has the top of its head covered with small scales, except, with a few species, a few crowded plates directly over the snout.Ditmars, Raymond L. \\"Reptiles of the World\\" The MacMillan Company, New York, 1936, p. 255 The skin of snakes is highly sensitive to contact, tension, and pressure; they are capable of feeling pain.Rubio, 1998: p. 69 An important function of the skin is the sensation of changes in air temperature, which can guide the snakes towards warm basking/shelter locations. All snakes are ectotherms. To maintain a stable body temperature, they exchange heat with their external environments. Snakes often move into open, sunny areas to absorb heat from the sun and warmed earth, a behavior known as basking. Nerves in the skin regulate the flow of blood into the veins near the surface. The skin of rattlesnakes is intricately patterned in a manner that camouflages them from their predators.Rubio, 1998: p. 38 Rattlesnakes do not generally have bright or showy colors (reds, yellows, blues, etc.), instead relying on subtle earth tones that resemble the surrounding environment.Rubio, 1998: p. 39 Creases in the epidermal tissue connect the scales of rattlesnakes. When ingesting large prey, these creases can unfold, allowing the skin to expand to envelop a much greater volume. The skin appears to tightly stretch to accommodate the meal, but in reality, the skin is simply smoothing out from its creased state and is not under very high tension.Rubio, 1998: p. 50 Reproduction Two male Northern Pacific rattlesnakes (C. oreganus oreganus) engage in a \\"combat dance\\" Everted hemipenis of a male C. adamanteus Most rattlesnake species mate during the summer or fall, while some species mate only in the spring, or during both the spring and fall.Rubio, 1998: p. 106 Females secrete small amounts of sex pheromones, which leave a trail the males follow using their tongues and Jacobson's organs as guides. Once a receptive female has been located, the male often spends several days following her around (a behavior not common outside of the mating season), frequently touching and rubbing her in an attempt to stimulate her.Klauber, 1997: p. 702 The males of some species, such as timber rattlesnakes (C. horridus), fight each other during the mating season, in competition over females. These fights known as \\"combat dances\\" consist of the two males intertwining the anterior portion of their bodies, often with their heads and necks held vertically. The larger males usually end up driving the smaller males away.Furman, 2007: p. 32Rubio, 1998: p. 109 Although many kinds of snakes and other reptiles are oviparous (lay eggs), rattlesnakes are ovoviviparous (give birth to live young after carrying eggs inside). The female produces the ova (\\"eggs\\") in her ovaries, after which they pass through the body cavity and into one of her two oviducts. The ova are arranged in a continuous chain in a coiled section of the oviduct, known as the \\"tuba\\". Male rattlesnakes have sexual organs known as hemipenes, located in the base of the tail. The hemipenis is retracted inside of the body when mating is not occurring. The hemipenis is similar to the human penis. Females can store semen for months in internal recesses known as spermathecae, which permits them to mate during the fall, but not fertilize the ova until the following spring.Rubio, 1998: p. 110 The Arizona black rattlesnake (C. oreganus cerberus), has been observed to exhibit complex social behavior reminiscent of that in mammals. Females often remain with their young in nests for several weeks, and mothers have been observed cooperatively parenting their broods. Rattlesnakes generally take several years to mature, and females usually reproduce only once every three years. Brumation In the colder winter months, some rattlesnake species enter a period of brumation, which is dormancy similar to hibernation. They often gather together for brumation in large numbers (sometimes over 1,000 snakes), huddling together inside underground \\"rattlesnake dens\\" or hibernacula.Rubio, 1998: p. 96Klauber, 1997: p. 573 Rattlesnakes regularly share their winter burrows with a wide variety of other species (such as turtles, small mammals, invertebrates, and other types of snakes). Rattlesnakes often return to the same den, year after year, sometimes traveling several miles to get there. It is not known exactly how the rattlesnakes find their way back to the dens each year, but may use a combination of pheromone trails and visual cues (e.g., topography, celestial navigation, and solar orientation).Rubio, 1998: pp. 96-97 Species with long periods of brumation tend to have much lower reproductive rates than those with shorter brumation periods or those that do not brumate at all. Female timber rattlesnakes in high peaks in the Appalachian Mountains of New England reproduce every three years on average; the lance-headed rattlesnake (C. polystictus), native to the warm climate of Mexico, reproduces annually.Furman, 2005: p. 33 Like most other snakes, rattlesnakes aestivate during very hot or dry periods, which is why they are rarely seen during the hottest and driest months of summer.Rubio, 1998: p. 100 Conservation status Rattlesnakes tend to avoid developed areas, preferring undisturbed, natural habitats. Rapid habitat destruction by humans, mass killings during events such as rattlesnake round-ups, and deliberate extermination campaigns all pose threats to rattlesnake populations in many areas. Several species of rattlesnakes, such as the timber rattlesnake, massasauga, and canebrake rattlesnake, are listed as threatened or endangered in many U.S. states.Rubio, 1998: pp. 200-203 Many rattlesnakes die from being run over by cars. In more heavily populated and trafficked areas, reports have been increasing of rattlesnakes that do not rattle. This phenomenon is commonly attributed to selective pressure by humans, who often kill the snakes when they are discovered. Non-rattling snakes are more likely to go unnoticed, so survive to reproduce offspring that, like themselves, are less likely to rattle. Safety and first aid A rattlesnake warning sign in California Rattlesnakes are the leading cause of snakebite injuries in North America and a significant cause in Central and South America. Avoiding bites Rattlesnakes tend to avoid wide-open spaces where they cannot hide from predators, and generally avoid humans if they are aware of their approach. Rattlesnakes rarely bite unless they feel threatened or provoked. A majority of victims (about 72%) are males, often young and intoxicated. Around half of bites occur in cases where the victim saw the snake, yet made no effort to move away. Caution is advised even when snakes are believed to be dead; rattlesnake heads can sense, flick the tongue, and inflict venomous bites reflexively for up to an hour after being severed from the body.Barceloux, 2008: p. 1027 Effect of bites on humans An estimated 7,000 to 8,000 people are bitten by venomous snakes in the United States each year, with about five deaths. The most important factor in survival following a severe envenomation is the time elapsed between the bite and treatment. Most deaths occur between 6 and 48 hours after the bite. If antivenom treatment is given within two hours of the bite, the probability of recovery is greater than 99%.Rubio, 1998: p. 143 When a bite occurs, the amount of venom injected is under voluntary control by the snake. The amount released depends on a variety of factors, including the condition of the snake (e.g., having long, healthy fangs and a full venom sack) and its temperament (an angry, hungry snake that has just been stepped on vs. a satiated snake that was merely surprised by walking near it). About 20% of bites result in no envenomation at all. A lack of burning pain and edema away from the fang marks after one hour suggests either no or minimal envenomation occurred. A lack of edema or erythema in the area of the bite after eight hours indicates a lack of envenomation for most rattlesnake bites.Barceloux, 2008: p. 1030 Common symptoms include swelling, severe pain, tingling, weakness, anxiety, nausea and vomiting, hemorrhaging, perspiration, and (rarely) heart failure.Klauber, 1997: p. 859 Local pain following envenomation is often intense, increasing with the ensuing edema. Children generally experience more severe symptoms because they receive a larger amount of venom per unit of body mass. Antivenin Antivenin, often referred to as antivenom, is commonly used to treat the effects of local and systemic pit viper envenomations. The first step in the production of crotaline antivenin is collecting (\\"milking\\") the venom of a live rattlesnake‚Äîusually from the western diamondback (Crotalus atrox), eastern diamondback (Crotalus adamanteus), South American rattlesnake (Crotalus durissis terrificus), or fer-de-lance (Bothrops atrox). The extracted venom is then diluted and injected into horses, goats, or sheep, whose immune systems produce antibodies that protect from the toxic effects of the venom. These antibodies accumulate in the blood, which is then extracted and centrifuged to separate the red blood cells. The resulting serum is purified into a lyophilized powder, which is packaged for distribution and later use by human patients.Barceloux, 2008: p. 1036 Because antivenin is derived from animal antibodies, people generally display an allergic response during infusion, known as serum sickness.Rubio, 1998: p. 145 Veterinary care In the United States, more than 15,000 domesticated animals are bitten by snakes each year. Rattlesnake envenomations account for 80% of the deadly incidents. Dogs are most commonly bitten on the front legs and head. Horses generally receive bites on the muzzle, and cattle on their tongues and muzzles. If a domesticated animal is bitten, the hair around the bite should be removed, so the wound can be clearly seen. The crotaline Fab antivenin has been shown to be effective in the treatment of canine rattlesnake bites. Symptoms include swelling, slight bleeding, sensitivity, shaking, and anxiety. In human culture=Spirituality feathered serpents on display at the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City =Indigenous Americans= Aztec paintings, Central American temples, and the great burial mounds in the southeastern United States are frequently adorned with depictions of rattlesnakes, often within the symbols and emblems of the most powerful deities. The Feathered Serpent of Mesoamerican religion was depicted as having the combined features of the quetzal and rattlesnake. The Ancient Maya considered the rattlesnake to be a \\"vision serpent\\" that acted as a conduit to the \\"otherworld\\". Rattlesnakes are a key element in Aztec mythology and were widely represented in Aztec art, including sculptures, jewelry, and architectural elements. =Christian snake handling sects= Snake handling at the Pentecostal Church of God in the town of Lejunior, Harlan County, Kentucky September 15, 1946 Members of some Christian sects in the southern United States are regularly bitten while participating in \\"snake handling\\" rituals. Snake handling is when people hold venomous snakes, unprotected, as part of a religious service inspired by a literal interpretation of the Bible verses Mark 16:17-18 which reads, \\"In my name ... they will pick up snakes with their hands\\".For a more detailed study of snake handling sects, see As food Journalist Alistair Cooke claimed that rattlesnake tastes \\"just like chicken, only tougher\\". Others have compared the flavor to a wide range of other meats, including veal, frog, tortoise, quail, fish, rabbit, and even canned tuna.Klauber, 1997: p. 1055 Methods of preparation include barbecueing and frying; author Maud Newton, following a recipe by Harry Crews, described the taste, \\"at least when breaded and fried, like a sinewy, half-starved tilapia.\\" Symbolism The rattlesnake became a symbolic animal for the Colonials during the Revolutionary War period, and is depicted prominently on the Gadsden Flag. It continues to be used as a symbol by the United States military, and political movements within the United States.

From Jones' Views of the Seats of Noblemen and Gentlemen (1819). Baron Barnard, of Barnard Castle in the Bishopric of Durham, is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1698 for Christopher Vane, who had previously served as a member of parliament for County Durham and Boroughbridge. Vane was the son of Sir Henry Vane the Younger and grandson of Sir Henry Vane the Elder. His grandson, the third Baron, notably served as Paymaster of the Forces and as Lord Lieutenant of County Durham. In 1754 he was created Viscount Barnard, of Barnard Castle in the County of Durham, and Earl of Darlington, in the County of Durham. Lord Darlington was the husband of Lady Grace FitzRoy, daughter of Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Cleveland, the illegitimate son of King Charles II by his mistress Barbara Villiers, 1st Duchess of Cleveland. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He sat as a member of parliament for Downton and County Durham and served as Lord Lieutenant of County Durham. On his death the titles passed to his son, the third Earl. He represented Totnes and Winchelsea in Parliament and served as Lord Lieutenant of County Durham. In 1827 the Cleveland title held by his great-grandmother was recreated when he was made Marquess of Cleveland, and in 1833 the dukedom of Cleveland was also revived when he was created Baron Raby, of Raby Castle in the County of Durham, and Duke of Cleveland. In 1839 the Duke was given the additional honour of being made a Knight of the Garter. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Duke. He was a general in the army and also sat as a Whig Member of Parliament for County Durham, Winchilsea and Totnes and as a Tory for Saltash and South Shropshire. When he died the titles passed to his younger brother, the third Duke. He represented Winchelsea and County Durham in the House of Commons as a Whig and St Ives and Ludlow as a Tory. In 1813 he assumed by Royal Licence his mother's maiden name of Powlett but in 1864, on succeeding to the dukedom, he resumed by Royal Licence his patronymic Vane. He was childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Duke. He was in the Diplomatic Service and also a Liberal Member of Parliament for South Durham and Hastings. In 1864 he assumed by Royal Licence his mother's maiden surname of Powlett in lieu of Vane. Like his two elder brothers he was childless and on his death 1891 the barony of Raby, the viscountcy, earldom, marquessate and dukedom became extinct, However, he was succeeded in the barony of Barnard, according to a decision by the Committee for Privileges of the House of Lords in 1892, by his distant relative Henry de Vere Vane, who became the ninth Baron. He was the great-great-grandson of Hon. Morgan Vane, younger son of the second Baron. His second son, the tenth Baron, was Lord Lieutenant of County Durham. The latter's son, the eleventh Baron, succeeded in 1964 and served as Lord- Lieutenant of County Durham from 1970 to 1988. the title is held by the latter's son, the twelfth Baron.Lord Barnard dies aged 92 Two other members of the Vane family have been elevated to the peerage. Hon. William Vane, younger son of the first Baron Barnard, was made Viscount Vane in the Peerage of Ireland in 1720 (see this title for more information). Also, William Vane, nephew of the ninth Baron, was created Baron Inglewood in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1964 (see this title for more information). The family seat is Raby Castle, near Staindrop, County Durham.

A specimen money order of Italy c. 1879. A money order is a payment order for a pre-specified amount of money. As it is required that the funds be prepaid for the amount shown on it, it is a more trusted method of payment than a cheque. The money order system was established by a private firm in Great Britain in 1792 and was expensive and not very successful. Around 1836 it was sold to another private firm which lowered the fees, significantly increasing the popularity and usage of the system. The Post Office noted the success and profitability, and it took over the system in 1838. Fees were further reduced and usage increased further, making the money order system reasonably profitable. The only draw-back was the need to send an advance to the paying post office before payment could be tendered to the recipient of the order. This drawback was likely the primary incentive for establishment of the Postal Order System on 1 January 1881. Usage A money order is purchased for the amount desired. In this way it is similar to a certified cheque. The main difference is that money orders are usually limited in maximum face value to some specified figure (for example, the United States Postal Service limits domestic postal money orders to US $1,000.00 ) while certified cheques are not. Money orders typically consist of two portions: the negotiable cheque for remittance to the payee, and a receipt or stub that the customer retains for his/her records. The amount is printed by machine or checkwriter on both portions, and similar documentation, either as a third hard copy or in electronic form and retained at the issuer and agent locations. Drawbacks Money orders have limited acceptance in the insurance and brokerage industry because of concerns over money laundering. Because of provisions within the USA PATRIOT Act and the Bank Secrecy Act, money orders have far more regulatory processing requirements than personal cheques, cashier's cheques, or certified cheques. National=India In India, a money order is a service provided by the Indian Postal Service. A payer who wants to send money to a payee pays the amount and a small commission at a post office and receives a receipt for the same. The amount is then delivered as cash to the payee after a few days by a postal employee, at the address specified by the payer. A receipt from the payee is collected and delivered back to the payer at his address. This is more reliable and safer than sending cash in the mail. It is commonly used for transferring funds to a payee who is in a remote, rural area, where banks may not be conveniently accessible or where many people may not use a bank account at all. Money orders are the most economical way of sending money in India for small amounts. United States An international money order issued in Chicago for encashment in Germany. In the United States, money orders are typically sold by third parties such as the United States Postal Service, grocery stores, and convenience stores. Some financial service companies such as banks and credit unions may not charge for money orders to their clients. Money orders remain a trusted financial instrument. However, just because a particular business can issue a money order does not necessarily mean that they will cash them. The U.S. Postal Service issues money orders for a small charge at any location. The United States Postal Service began selling money orders as an alternative to sending currency through the postal system in order to reduce post office robberies, an idea instituted by Montgomery Blair who was Postmaster-General 1861-1864. Money orders were later offered by many more vendors than just the postal service as a means to pay bills and send money internationally where there were not reliable banking or postal systems. Companies that now offer money orders include 7-11, QuikTrip, Cumberland Farms, Safeway, Western Union, MoneyGram, CVS, Wal-Mart, and 3T Solutions. Obtaining a money order in the United States is simple, as they can be purchased at any post office, and are sold at many other locations. The US Postal Service's international money orders are accepted in 29 countries. International An international money order is very similar in many aspects to a regular money order except that it can be used to make payments abroad. With it, a buyer can easily pay a seller for goods or services if he or she resides in another country. International money orders are often issued by a buyer's bank and bought in the currency that the seller accepts. International money orders are thought to be safer than sending currency through the post because there are various forms of identification required to cash an international money order, often including a signature and a form of photo identification. When purchasing an international money order, it is important to ensure that the specific type of money order is acceptable in the destination country. Several countries are very strict that the money order be on pink and yellow paper and bear the words \\"international postal money order.\\" In particular, Japan Post (one of the largest banking institutions in the world) requires these features. Most other countries have taken this as a standard when there is any doubt of a document's authenticity. Alternatives In the last decade, a number of electronic alternatives to money orders have emerged and have, in some cases, supplanted money orders as the preferred cash transmission method. Many of these alternatives use the ubiquitous Visa/MasterCard payment systems to settle transactions. In Japan, the konbini system enables cash to cash transfers and is available at many of the thousands of convenience stores located in the country. In Italy, the PostePay system is offered through the Italian post office. In Ireland, 3V is offered through mobile top-up locations. In the United States, PaidByCash is offered at 60,000 grocery and convenience stores. In Bangladesh, mobile banking services enable electronic transfer of money as well as retail transactions. In the United Kingdom, a number of credit card providers have started to provide pre-paid credit cards. These cards can be \\"topped-up\\" at any location that uses the Pay-Point system and also at the Post Office for the Post Office card. PayPal has their own branded pre-paid card which can be \\"topped-up\\" using a PayPal account or Pay-Points.

He married Margery Berners, daughter of Sir Richard Berners. The peerage is so ancient as to have been established by writ, and thus can descend through both male and female lines (in the absence of an official grant of remainder). He was succeeded by his grandson John Bourchier, 2nd Baron Berners, who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer between 1516 and 1527 and is well known in literature as Lord Berners, having made a well-regarded English translation of Froissart's Chronicles. Arms of Knyvett: Argent, a bend sable a bordure engrailed of the last He died without male progeny and was thus succeeded by his daughter Jane Bourchier, wife of Sir Edmund Knyvett and de jure 3rd Baroness Berners, although she never assumed the title. Her grandson Thomas Knyvett, the de jure 4th Baron, received a writ of summons in this title but died before obtaining the King's confirmation. His great-great-grandson Sir Thomas Knyvett, the de jure 7th Baron Berners, sat as a Member of Parliament for Dunwich and Eyre. On his death in 1693 the peerage fell into abeyance between his two sisters, Elizabeth Knyvett, wife of Sir Thomas Glemham, and Katherine Knyvett, wife firstly of John Harris and secondly of Richard Bokenham. From restoration to death of 14th Baron (1711‚Äì1950) The barony by writ of summons remained in abeyance until 1711, when, on the death of Sir Thomas Glenham, only child of Elizabeth Glenham (see above), the peerage title devolved on the aforementioned Katherine Bokenham, who became the de jure eighth holder. In 1720 she was confirmed by the House of Lords as 8th Baroness Berners. However, on her death in 1743 the barony again fell into abeyance, this time between the heirs of the sisters Elizabeth Knyvett (wife of Henry Wilson) and Lucy Knyvett (wife firstly of Thomas Holt and secondly of John Field), both great- granddaughters of Thomas Knyvett, younger brother of John Knyvett, 6th Baron Berners. This time the peerage remained in abeyance for 89 years, until the abeyance was terminated in 1832 in favour of Robert Wilson, who became the ninth Baron. He was the grandson of Elizabeth Knyvett. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the tenth Baron. When he died the title passed to his son, the eleventh Baron. He died childless and was succeeded by his niece Harriet Tyrwhitt, the twelfth Baroness. She was the daughter of Hon. Robert Wilson, younger son of the tenth Baron, and wife of Sir Henry Thomas Tyrwhitt, 3rd Baronet (see below for earlier history of this title). She was succeeded by her son, the thirteenth Baron. In 1892 he assumed by Royal Licence the additional surname of Wilson and in 1894 succeeded his father as the fourth baronet, of Stanley Hall; he did not marry and was succeeded by his nephew, the fourteenth Baron, a writer, painter and composer of classical music. He also never married and on his death in 1950 the baronetcy became extinct. Tyrwhitt baronetcy The Tyrwhitt baronetcy, of Stanley Hall in the County of Shropshire, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 3 October 1808 for Thomas Tyrwhitt Jones. He represented Weymouth and Melcombe Regis, Denbigh Boroughs, Athlone and Shrewsbury in the House of Commons. Born Thomas Tyrwhitt, he assumed by Royal Licence the additional surname of Jones in 1790. His son, the second baronet, was High Sheriff of Shropshire in 1816 and sat as a Member of Parliament for Bridgnorth (1818‚Äì1820). He was succeeded by his son, the aforementioned Sir Henry Thomas Tyrwhitt, 3rd Baronet, who married Harriet Wilson, 12th Baroness Berners.

Following the army's modularization the division has become a four-brigade combat team with National Guardsmen from throughout the Pacific/Western United States and Oceania. Its division headquarters is located at Los Alamitos Joint Forces Training Base in Los Alamitos, California. After seeing service in World War I as a depot division, it was reorganized as the National Guard division for California, Nevada, and Utah, before seeing service in the Pacific Theatre of World War II. Later, the division served in Korea and some of its units were designated for Vietnam. The division was later reorganized redesigned as a National Guard unit completely within California. Later reorganizations included units from other states.

It was decided that the new divisions would be used as depot divisions, supplying fresh troops to the more experienced combat divisions. By the end of the war, the 40th Division had provided over 27,000 replacements to the 26th, 28th, 32nd, 77th, 80th, 81st, 82nd, and 89th Divisions. Thus the division as a whole did not serve in combat, but many division personnel fought, notably Captain Nelson Miles Holderman, who received the Medal of Honor for his actions in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. The division returned to the United States on 30 June 1919 where it was deactivated. The division was reconstituted on 18 June 1926 with its headquarters in Berkeley. The division was organized much as it was in 1917 with a lot of the units coming from Nevada and Utah. However, the Arizona and Colorado infantry regiments were replaced by two new California regiments, the 184th Infantry and 185th Infantry. In 1937 the division headquarters was moved to Los Angeles.

Myers (July 1945 to inactivation) =Combat chronicle= The 40th Infantry Division was ordered into federal service on 3 March 1941. It was at the time a National Guard division from the California, Nevada Army National Guard, and Utah Army National Guards. In February 1942, the 40th Infantry Division was reorganized from a 'square', two-brigade, four-regiment division to a three-regiment division without any intermediate brigade headquarters. Thus the 79th and 80th Infantry Brigades were inactivated. The division departed for overseas service on 23 August 1942. The division's first overseas assignment was the defense of the outer Hawaiian Islands, where it arrived in September 1942. Training continued as defensive positions were improved and maintained. In July 1943, the division was concentrated on Oahu, and relieved the 24th Infantry Division of the defense of the North Sector. Relieved of the North Sector in October 1943, the 40th entered upon a period of intensive amphibious and jungle training. On 20 December 1943, the first units left for Guadalcanal, and by mid-January 1944, movement was completed, and the division prepared for its first combat assignment. On 24 April 1944, it left Guadalcanal for New Britain. The regiments of the division took positions at Talasea on the northern side of the island, at Arawe on the southern side, and at near the western end. Neutralization of the enemy was effected by patrols. No major battle was fought. Heavy rain and mud were constant problems. Japanese soldier surrenders in the Philippines. The 40th was relieved of missions on New Britain on 27 November 1944 by the Australian 5th Division, and began training for the Luzon landing. Sailing from Borgen Bay on 9 December 1944, the division made an assault landing at Lingayen, Luzon, under command of XIV Corps, on 9 January 1945. Seizing Lingayen airfield, the division occupied Bolinao Peninsula and San Miguel, and advanced toward Manila, include the Filipino regular and constable force of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary were recaptured areas around in Luzon at the mainland, running into heavy fighting in the Fort Stotsenburg area and the Bambam Hills. Snake Hill and Storm King Mountain were taken in February and the 40th was relieved, 2 March. Leaving Luzon on 15 March 1945 to cut behind the Japanese, the division landed on Panay Island on the 18th and knocked out Japanese resistance within ten days, seizing airfields at Santa Barbara and Mandurriao. On 29 March, it landed at Pulupandan, Negros Occidental, advanced through Bacolod toward Talisay, which it secured by 2 April 1945. After mopping up on Negros Island, the division returned to Panay in June and July 1945. In September 1945, the division moved to Korea for occupation duty.[These combat chronicles, current as of October 1948, are reproduced from The Army Almanac: A Book of Facts Concerning the Army of the United States, U.S. Government Printing Office, 1950, pp. 510‚Äì592.] The division returned to the U.S. on 7 April 1946 and was reportedly inactivated the same day. During the war various regiments were assigned to the division, these included the 108th, 159th, 160th, 184th, 185th, and 503d, however no more than three regiments were assigned to the division at any one time. World War II honors for the division included three Distinguished Unit Citations. Awards to its men included 1 Medal of Honor, 12 Distinguished Service Crosses, 1 Distinguished Service Medal, 245 Silver Stars, 21 Legions of Merit, 30 Soldier's Medals, 1,036 Bronze Stars, and 57 Air Medals. =Casualties= *Total battle casualties: 3,025Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths (Statistical and Accounting Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953) *Killed in action: 614 *Wounded in action: 2,407 *Missing in action: 3 *Prisoner of war: 1Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953)  Korean War Commanders= *Major General Daniel H.

Shipping out of Oakland and San Francisco, California in late March 1951, the division deployed to Japan for training. For the next nine months, they participated in amphibious, air transportability, and live fire training from Mount Fuji to Sendai. On 23 December, the division received alert orders to move to Korea. The division moved to Korea in January 1952. After additional training, the division moved north in February 1952, where it relieved the 24th Infantry Division on the battle line. At the time the division consisted of the 160th, 223rd, and 224th Infantry Regiments, and smaller non-regiment-sized units. Painting of the 40th Infantry Division in the Kumwha Valley In Korea, the 40th Infantry Division participated in the battles of Sandbag Castle and Heartbreak Ridge. In these campaigns, the division suffered 1,180 casualties, including 311 who were killed in action, and 47 who later died from wounds received in action. Total division casualties in Korea included 376 killed in action, 1,457 wounded in action, and 47 dead of wounds. After the division was sent back to Japan, its time in Korea was commemorated by the commissioning of a punchbowl created by a local silversmith, by some accounts made up of the melted down Combat Infantryman Badges of the divisions veterans, with the geography of Heartbreak Ridge etched inside the bowl.Jonathan (Jay) Koester, NCO Journal, For Nearly 100 years, the Sunshine Division has Protected California and the Nation, 29 January 2013Los Angeles Times, Marilyn Eaton Wed to Franklin Moulton, 14 July 1955 It was used at ceremonial functions until it was stolen, and was subsequently bought at a garage sale by a married couple, who kept it for 18 years. It was then recovered and put on display at the division headquarters. It is now displayed at the California State Military Museum, and is registered in the National Archives.Facebook page, California State Military Museum, Photo caption, 224th Reunion, 2 July 2013 Three members of the division's 223rd Infantry Regiment were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions during the Korean War: David B. Bleak, Gilbert G. Collier and Clifton T. Speicher. David Hackworth did a combat tour as company commander of E Company (Heavy Weapons) 1st Battalion 223rd Infantry Regiment and F Company 2nd Battalion 223rd Infantry Regiment in Korea with the division, when it was under the command of Major General Joseph P. Cleland.Joseph P. Cleland After its return from the Korean War, the division was reorganized on 1 July 1954 as the 40th Armored Division. It had three combat commands (A, B, and C) in 1956.  Cold War  The following infantry regimental units comprised elements of the division from 1959 until 2000: 1-158th (1959‚Äì1967), 1-159th (1974‚Äì1976), 2‚Äì159th (1974‚Äì2000) 160th (1974‚Äì2000). In 1960, the Division combat units were reorganized under the Combat Arms Regimental Systems (CARS), and then in 1963, was reorganized under the Reorganization Objective Army Divisions (ROAD) concept which changed the combat commands to brigades. On 13 August 1965, Lieutenant Governor Glenn M. Anderson called out elements of the division to put down the Watts Riots, at the request of Los Angeles Police Chief William H. Parker. The absence of Governor Pat Brown vested gubernatorial authority in Anderson. On 1 December 1967, a major reorganization of the National Guard reduced the Guard to eight combat divisions, the 40th Armored Division being one of the casualties. On 29 January 1968, the division was eliminated and the 40th Infantry Brigade and 40th Armored Brigade were organized. On 13 January 1974, the California Army National Guard was reorganized. The 40th and 49th Infantry and the 40th Armored Brigades were inactivated and the 40th Infantry Division was reformed. Like most reserve component units of the Army, the division sat out the Vietnam War, being left unmobilized, apart from its Aviation Company. In January 1968 the company had been redesignated the 40th Aviation Company, having been previously designated the 29th Aviation Company, part of the 29th Infantry Brigade homebased in Hawaii. The 40th Aviation Company did one tour in South Vietnam. It was in active federal service from May 1968 to December 1969. In January 1974 Major General Charles A. Ott, Jr. was appointed commander of the division, and he served until accepting appointment as Director of the Army National Guard at the National Guard Bureau later that year.National Guard Association of the United States, The Guardsman, Volume 32, Issues 7‚Äì10, 1978, p. 68 On 30 September 1986, the division's Aviation Brigade was organized and federally recognized at Fresno. In 1987 the division's aviation units were reorganized, and the 140th Aviation Regiment was established. From 1986 until 1995, the division's CAPSTONE wartime organizational structure included the 140th Military Intelligence Battalion (CEWI) (HD). Allocated to the United States Army Reserve in peacetime, the mission of the battalion was to provide the division commander and G-2 with electronic warfare intelligence and analysis, as well limited counterintelligence/interrogation support and long range surveillance. The battalion's long-range surveillance detachment was stripped from the battalion in peacetime and allocated to the California Army National Guard.  Post Cold War  The 40th Infantry Division was not deployed in the Persian Gulf War. 40th Infantry Division Agribusiness Development Team in Afghanistan On 29 April 1992, Governor Pete Wilson ordered elements of the 40th Infantry Division to duty to put down the so-called \\"Rodney King\\" riots. The 40th ID responded quickly by calling up some 2,000 soldiers, but could not get them to the city until nearly twenty-four hours had passed, due to a lack of proper equipment, training, and available ammunition, which had to be picked up from Camp Roberts, California (near Paso Robles). Initially, they only secured areas previously cleared of rioters by police. Later, they actively ran patrols, maintained checkpoints, and provided firepower for law enforcement. By 1 May, the call-up had increased to 4,000 soldiers continuing to move into the city in Humvees, who were later federalized under Title 10 USC by President George H.W. Bush. In 1994, the division was made of three brigades, an aviation brigade, an engineer brigade, a division artillery brigade, and other associated units. Associated regiments included the 160th Infantry, 185th Armor, 221st Armor (Nevada), 159th Infantry, 184th Infantry, 149th Armor, 18th Cavalry, 140th Aviation, 143d Field Artillery, and 144th Field Artillery. On 17 January 1994, Governor Pete Wilson activated the 40th Infantry Division (M) to respond to the aftermath of the Northridge earthquake, and emergency services were up and running within five hours of the quake. In November 1997, Battery F (TA), 144th Field Artillery Regiment, represented the state of California in Bosnia. During this deployment, Battery F conducted Firefinder counter-battery radar operations, convoys and base security all with little to no armor, with a high threat of mine strikes and ambushes. Most drivers exceeded 21,000 kilometres (13,000 miles) during the seven months in country. In November 2000, Battery F was again called to duty for its expertise in the Kosovo region. Until Battery F's arrival in Afghanistan, radar operations were virtually unknown and uncared for. Nevertheless, the unit quickly became a very important resource and a leading factor in base defense operations. Operation Freedom's Sentinel The 40th ID deployed to Afghanistan in September 2017 in support of Operation Freedom's Sentinel. Members of the 40th ID form the headquarters staff of Train, Advise, and Assist Command South which was commanded by Brig. Gen. John W. Lathrop. This is the unit's \\"first combat deployment since the Korean War.\\" In June 2018, authority of the command was transferred to Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Smiley who took command with a new group of 40th ID Soldiers; in October 2018, Smiley was injured during an insider attack, which resulted in the death of the police chief of Kandahar.

National Guard units from California, Oregon, Hawaii, Arizona, Washington, Alaska, New Mexico, Indiana, Nebraska, Utah and Guam were part of the 40th Infantry Division. On 3 December 2016 the 81st Stryker Brigade Combat Team left the division and joined the 7th Infantry Division as an associate unit of the 2nd Infantry Division.81st SBCT repatching ceremony 3 December 2016 Attached units * 65th Field Artillery Brigade (UT NG) * 297th Battlefield Surveillance Brigade (AK NG)(Reorganized and redesignated as the 297th Regional Support Group)  Symbols  *Nickname: Sunshine/Sunburst Division(Official); Flaming Assholes (Unofficial). *Shoulder patch: A dark blue diamond on which, in yellow, is the sun with 12 rays; the patch is worn diagonally. *Association: 40th Infantry Division Association The semi-sunburst was suggested as the unit's shoulder sleeve insignia, and represents the division's home of Southern California. The demi fleur-de-lis symbolizes service in France during World War I. The outer rim of the sun rays refers to the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation award. The red arrowhead alludes to firepower of the division and represents their assault landing at Luzon in World War II. The Torri gate, a symbol of the Far East, refers to the award of the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation. The unofficial nickname came from the Korean War era when the unit was training in Japan. It was a combined result of disparaging remarks made by Army regulars about the National Guard division and the appearance of the unit shoulder sleeve insignia. The California Guardsmen took to their new nickname with a soldier's sense of humor, and turned it into a rallying symbol. See also *Edward C. Meyer *Charles A.

The band found success in the mid-1980s, releasing seven singles that made the UK Top 40 and three albums on the UK Top 30. They were the first band under the production team of Stock Aitken Waterman to have a number-one single. At the peak of their success, the lineup consisted of Pete Burns (vocals), Mike Percy (bass), Steve Coy (drums) and Tim Lever (keyboards). Two of the band's singles reached the U.S. Top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100: \\"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\\" (No. 11 in 1985) and \\"Brand New Lover\\" (No. 15 in 1986). \\"You Spin Me Round\\" peaked at number one for two weeks in 1985 in the UK, then charted again in 2006 following Burns' appearance on the television reality show Celebrity Big Brother. It also became the first of two singles to top the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart. In December 2016, Billboard ranked them as the 96th most successful \\"dance artist\\" of all time. As of 2017 Dead or Alive had sold over 30 million albums and 28 million singles worldwide. The band was discontinued following Pete Burns' death in 2016. History=Formation and early career of band Nightmares in Wax (March 1980) In 1977, Burns formed a band with contemporaries Julian Cope, Pete Wylie, and Phil Hurst, calling themselves The Mystery Girls. They played only one gig (opening for Sham 69 at Eric's in Liverpool in November 1977) before disintegrating.Greene, Jo-Ann \\"[ Nightmares in Wax Biography]\\", Allmusic, Macrovision Corporation Burns returned in early 1979 with a new band, Nightmares in Wax (original name: 'Rainbows Over Nagasaki'), featuring a gothic post-punk sound, with backing from keyboardist Martin Healy, guitarist Mick Reid (ex-Crash Course and Glass Torpedoes), bassist Rob Jones, who left soon afterwards to be replaced by Walter Ogden, and drummer Paul Hornby, formerly of 051 and Pink Military, who also exited soon after the band's formation to be replaced by Phil Hurst. Nightmares in Wax played their first gig supporting Wire at Eric's in July 1979,Jonathan Buckley, Mark Ellingham, Justin Lewis, and Jill Furmanovsky (1996) The Rough Guide to Rock, Rough Guides, and, around the same time, recorded demos which included a cover of the Simon Dupree and the Big Sound song \\"Kites\\", a feature of their early shows. Although signed to the Eric's Records label, their only release, a three-track 7\\" EP entitled Birth of a Nation, appeared in March 1980 on Inevitable Records. A 12-inch single featuring two of the tracks from the EP, \\"Black Leather\\" and \\"Shangri-La\\", was released in 1985.Gimarc, George (2005) Punk Diary: The Ultimate Trainspotter's Guide to Underground Rock 1970‚Äì1982, Backbeat Books, , p.312 The EP featured \\"Black Leather\\", which halfway through turned into K.C. & the Sunshine Band's \\"That's the Way (I Like It)\\" (a song later revived by Dead or Alive). Ogden left the band at the beginning of November 1979 shortly before the recording of demos for the planned Inevitable Records release. Bassist Ambrose Reynolds helped out on both these sessions and those for the EP a month later. Pete Lloyd joined in January 1980 and the band returned to playing live shows early in February. Lloyd and Reid left the band in March 1980, and Hurst followed a month or so later. Burns and Healy were then joined by bassist Sue James, guitarist Adrian Mitchley, and drummer Joe Musker and, in May 1980, just before they were to record a radio session for John Peel, Burns changed the name of the band to Dead or Alive. The band went through several line-up changes over the next three years while recording a series of independent singles. Burns' eccentric and androgynous appearance began attracting attention, often leading to comparisons with Culture Club and its lead singer Boy George. Dead or Alive's singles started charting on the UK Indie Chart, beginning with 1982's \\"The Stranger\\" reaching No. 7 on that chart.Lazell, Barry (1997) Indie Hits 1980‚Äì1989, Cherry Red Books, , p.61 This prompted major label Epic Records to sign the band in 1983. Their first release for Epic was the single \\"Misty Circles\\", which appeared at No. 100 on the major UK Singles Chart in 1983. At this point, the band was a five-piece consisting of Burns, Mike Percy (bass), Tim Lever (keyboards/sax), Steve Coy (drums), and Wayne Hussey (guitar). Two more singles, \\"What I Want\\" and \\"I'd Do Anything\\", attracted club play, but mainstream success continued to elude the band. Dead or Alive's debut album, Sophisticated Boom Boom, was released in May 1984 and featured their first Top 40 UK single, \\"That's the Way (I Like It)\\", a remake of the 1975 hit by KC and the Sunshine Band. Hussey departed Dead or Alive just before the album's release. The single peaked at No. 22 in the UK and the album at No. 29. 1980s chart success Now a four-piece following the departure of Hussey, in May 1985 the band released its second album Youthquake (US No. 31, UK No. 9), produced by the then-fledgling songwriting/production team of Mike Stock, Matt Aitken, and Pete Waterman known as Stock Aitken Waterman (SAW). The single \\"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\\" went to number one on the UK singles chart after having lingered outside the Top 40 for over two months (the song was SAW's first chart-topping single). The song also hit No. 11 in the US and No. 1 in Canada. Other album tracks released as singles included \\"Lover Come Back To Me\\", \\"In Too Deep\\", and \\"My Heart Goes Bang\\". They all reached the UK Top 30. In late 1986, Dead or Alive released their third album, Mad, Bad, and Dangerous to Know (US No. 52, UK No. 27), also produced by SAW. The lead single \\"Brand New Lover\\" became a modest UK hit, peaking at No. 31, but was more successful in the US where it reached No. 15 on the US Hot 100, and number one on the US Billboard dance chart. Three more singles from the album were released, although none saw any notable US success on the pop charts. All of these singles caused some sort of controversy in the UK. The most successful in the UK was \\"Something in My House\\" (UK No. 12), tonally Gothic and with a sleeve depicting Burns in front of what appears to be a Satanic altar, featuring an inverted cross. A 12\\" version of the song, the 'Mortevicar Mix', featured scenes from Nosferatu and sampling of dialogue from the soundtrack of The Exorcist and a sampling from the George A. Romero American movie trailer from his film Day of the Dead (1985) and other '80s horror films. A third single, \\"Hooked on Love\\", failed to make the UK Top 40 and had a \\"Gothic\\" overtone that had been added in a post-production remix. After the release of the album, Tim Lever and Mike Percy left the band to form careers as mixers and producers aka 'One World Productions'. The pair owned and operated Steelworks Studios in Sheffield, UK. As mixers and producers, Lever and Percy experienced success writing and mixing songs for acts like S Club 7, Blue, and Robbie Williams. Lever and Percy have since left the studio. In 1987, Dead or Alive released their greatest hits album Rip It Up, and a concert tour of the same name. In mid 1988, Dead or Alive, now pared down to a duo of Burns and Coy, released the self-produced Nude, which featured the single \\"Turn Around and Count 2 Ten\\". It was followed by \\"Come Home with Me Baby\\". The single was a US club hit, including number one on the US dance charts. 1990s 1990 saw the release of Fan the Flame (Part 1); an album released only in Japan. The album had three singles, \\"Your Sweetness (Is Your Weakness)\\", \\"Gone Too Long\\", and \\"Unhappy Birthday\\". The band had planned to release Fan the Flame (Part 2) in 1992, which was similar in style to Part 1, but with the modest sales of Part 1 in UK, Part 2 was never released. It would have featured tracks such as \\"I Don't Care About Your Heart\\", as well as a cover of Barry White's \\"It's Ecstasy When You Lay Down Next To Me\\". Some tracks were later re-recorded for the band's Nukleopatra album. It is often confused with the acoustic Love, Pete album, which was sold in cassette form on the band's 1992 tour (during which tracks from Part 2 were previewed). For a few years, Dead or Alive were mostly inactive in the recording studio. Burns resurfaced in 1994 as vocalist on a single for the Italian techno outfit Glam. Burns helped write the single, \\"Sex Drive\\", which was a return to the dance floor. Burns and Coy flirted with the idea of recording under the name International Chrysis, named after the late transsexual nightclub performer, and released a single as such in 1994, a cover version of David Bowie's \\"Rebel Rebel\\". The year 1995 saw new work from Dead or Alive with new keyboardists Jason Alburey and Dean Bright, joining Burns and Coy for the album Nukleopatra. The album featured a smattering of previously released material, including \\"Rebel Rebel\\", \\"Sex Drive\\", and two tracks that originally appeared on Fan the Flame (Part 1), \\"Gone Too Long\\" and \\"Unhappy Birthday\\". The album also featured a cover of Blondie's \\"Picture This\\". Initially released in Japan only, Nukleopatra was later released in Australia, Singapore, South Africa, France and the United States, and each release sported different cover art, track listings, and song versions. Many releases of Nukleopatra also included one or more remixes of \\"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\\". 2000s In 2000, Dead or Alive released Fragile, a collection of remakes with several new tracks and covers including U2's \\"Even Better Than the Real Thing\\" and Nick Kamen's \\"I Promised Myself\\". This would eventually be their seventh and final studio album. A new remix album, Unbreakable, was released in 2001. This was followed by a greatest hits album entitled Evolution: the Hits, released in 2003 which featured yet another remix of \\"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\\"; both of them enjoyed, for the first time since Nude, a UK release, with \\"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\\" re-entering the Top 40. Later on in 2003, Alburey and Bright departed the band, leaving Dead or Alive once again a duo of Burns and Coy. In 2004, Burns enjoyed solo success with the Pet Shop Boys-produced track \\"Jack and Jill Party\\". Although only released through the Pet Shop Boys website, the track reached number 75 in the UK singles chart. 2010s In September 2010, Burns released a new single, \\"Never Marry an Icon\\". Even though Burns stated Dead or Alive had ceased to exist in 2011, Coy later declared the moniker was still active and the band was not over. On 21 December 2012, Burns and Coy (as Dead or Alive) performed at the Pete Waterman concert, Hit Factory Live at London's O2 Arena. Other artists on the bill included Jason Donovan, Rick Astley, Steps, Sinitta, Pepsi & Shirlie, Hazell Dean, Princess, Sybil, 2 Unlimited, Lonnie Gordon and Brother Beyond. Burns died of cardiac arrest on 23 October 2016, at the age of 57, effectively ending the band. On 28 October 2016, a 19-disc box set titled Sophisticated Boom Box MMXVI was released by Edsel Records. The box set featured all records, singles and rarities produced by Dead or Alive from 1983 to 2010, including Pete Burns' solo releases. Coy hinted there may be a second box set in the future to come and previously unreleased Dead or Alive albums as well. Steve Coy died unexpectedly on 4 May 2018 at the age of 56. Concerts The band toured regularly in the UK in the first half of the 1980s. Their first world tour began in 1987, with dates in Europe, the US, and Japan. Film footage was recorded at two shows at Tokyo's Nippon Budokan on 9 October and at Osaka's Osaka-j≈ç Hall on 11 October 1987, and released on video cassette (VHS) and Laserdisc that same year under the title Rip It Up Live. The concert was eventually issued as bonus material for the first time on DVD as part of the 2003 compilation release. A studio version of Rip It Up consisting of the original studio and remix versions of Dead or Alive's best known songs was released on vinyl, cassette and compact disc that same year. In 1995, Dead or Alive started performing in local night- clubs (mostly gay). Dead or Alive were featured at Gay Pride in Los Angeles in 1995. Celebrity Big Brother In 2006, Pete Burns took part in the TV show Celebrity Big Brother in the UK. Burns became known for openly insulting actress Traci Bingham and performing modern dance with Respect MP George Galloway. Following the end of the show (Burns finished in fifth place), \\"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\\" (from 1985's Youthquake album) was re-released.

Misick is a member of the liberal Progressive National Party (PNP), and became chief minister when his party, after eight years as the opposition party, gained two parliamentary seats in by-elections. In addition to being premier, he was also the minister for Civil Aviation, Commerce and Development, Planning, District Administration, Broadcasting Commission, Tourist Board, Turks and Caicos Investment Agency, and Tourism. Several other members of Misick's family have been politicians in the Turks and Caicos Islands, and important leaders in the PNP. Washington Misick, his brother, is a former Chief Minister and currently Minister of Finance, following elections in November 2012, in which the PNP returned to power. Biography Born in Bottle Creek, North Caicos, Misick is one of 12 children of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Misick. He received his foundation education in North Caicos, and then furthered it at the Turks and Caicos High School (Helena Jones Robinson High School), the Miami Lakes Technical Institute (where he graduated with a certificate in Business Studies), and the University of Buckingham (LLB, Hons. Bachelor of Law). Misick is a Barrister at Law of England and Wales and an Attorney at Law of Turks and Caicos Islands. He is a member of the Honourable Society of Lincoln‚Äôs Inn. Misick spent several years in the private sector where he was sales manager for Prestigious Properties Ltd. from 1984 to 1986 and managing director from 1986 to 1988. From 1988 to 1991 he was chairman and CEO of Paramount Group of Companies, a property and financial services company. Misick was first elected to the Legislative Council in 1991, when he became Minister of Tourism, Transportation and Communications. He was re- elected in 1995. In March 2002 he was elected leader of the then opposition PNP thus succeeding Washington Misick. In the April 2003 general elections, Misick's party won 6 out of the possible 13 seats in the legislature. The successful petitioning and winning of by-elections held in two constituencies resulted in Misick being sworn in as Chief Minister of the Turks and Caicos Islands on 16 August 2003. In April 2006, Premier Michael Misick married American actress and fashion designer, LisaRaye McCoy; it is reported that the Misicks are divorced. A statement released on 12 August 2008 to the press by Premier Misick stated: \\"I am announcing that I am separated from LisaRaye McCoy, I am committed to dissolving the marriage amicably. I believe that this is a private matter and will have no further comments. I hope that our privacy will be respected.‚Äù On 7 January 2007, Misick called for general elections on 9 February. The PNP won 13 of the 15 seats, making it one of the most lopsided election results in the Turks and Caicos Islands. Corruption allegations In 2008, a Foreign Affairs Select Committee of British Members of Parliament conducting a routine review of the administration in British Overseas Territories received several reports of high-level official corruption in the Turks and Caicos.Nick Meo. \\"Turks and Caicos: MPs criticise 'climate of fear' on luxury holiday islands.\\" The Telegraph. 6 July 2008. Retrieved 1 August 2008. Their report charged that Misick, \\"who is alleged to have built up a multi-million dollar fortune since he was elected in 2003 when he declared assets of only $50,000 (¬£25,000),\\" enriched himself and fellow ministers \\"by selling off Crown land to fund current investment.\\" In response, the Governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands Richard Tauwhare announced the appointment of a Commission of Enquiry into corruption on 10 July 2008.\\"Turks and Caicos governor appoints Commission of Enquiry\\" Caribbean Net News. 10 July 2008. Retrieved 1 August 2008. Rape allegation Misick was accused of raping an American woman on 28 March 2007. The claim against Misick failed, and the woman subsequently brought proceedings against her employers in Florida. Resignation On 15 December 2008 Misick was asked to step down by nine members of his party. Misick, who has denied any wrongdoing, resigned on 23 March 2009 after an investigation found \\"clear signs of corruption\\" in Turks and Caicos. The UK Foreign Office said it would suspend the constitution and give control to Governor Gordon Wetherell. The departure of the premier occurred a week earlier than expected.TCI Premier Resigns, The Bahama Journal, published and accessed 24 March 2009. While the investigations were underway, Governor Gordon Wetherell suspended self-government in the islands on 16 August 2009. In June 2011 Misick's assets were frozen by a court order. In September 2010 a report from the Turks and Caicos Islands 2008-9 Commission of Inquiry recommended criminal investigation of Misick of possible corruption and abuse of his former position. Arrest and trial On 7 December 2012, Michael Misick was arrested at Santos Dumont Airport, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, after being located by Interpol. He was arrested while trying to leave for Sao Paulo. The arrest warrant was issued by Minister Ricardo Lewandowski of the Supreme Federal Court of Brazil on 22 November, at the request of the government of the United Kingdom. He was returned to Turks and Caicos on 7 January 2014 where he was questioned at the capital's police headquarters. He was briefly remanded at Her Majesty‚Äôs Prison Grand Turk before being released on bail on 13 January 2014 ahead of his trial. He was charged with conspiracy to receive bribes, conspiracy to defraud the government and money laundering., republished from the Jamaica Observer. His much-delayed trial began on 18 January 2016, and was still on-going a year later. Political comeback attempt In December 2016 Michael Misick stood as an at-large candidate in the general elections in Turks & Caicos as an independent. However he received only 5.57% of the vote and was not elected.

The previous Windows key (center) with an orb surrounding the center-anchored Windows logo used for Windows Vista and Windows 7. For Windows XP, the logo had no orb surrounding it and was off-center to the left. The first Windows key (center) appeared with Windows 95. The Windows logo key (also known as Windows-, win-, start-, logo-, flag-, or super- key) is a keyboard key which was originally introduced on the Microsoft Natural keyboard in 1994. This key became a standard key on PC keyboards. In Windows tapping the key brings up the start menu. performs the same function, in case the keyboard lacks this key. History and usage Historically, the addition of two Windows keys and a menu key marked the change from the 101/102-key to 104/105-key layout for PC keyboards.Initially, 104-key keyboards were frequently called \\"Windows keyboards\\" but this denomination has become less and less used with time. Compared to the former layout, a Windows key was placed between the left and the left and another Windows key and the menu key were placed between the right (or ) and the right key. The key is predated by the key on Apple computers in 1980 and the key in LISP/UNIX computers in 1970. In laptop and other compact keyboards it is common to have just one Windows key (usually on the left). On Microsoft's Entertainment Desktop sets (designed for Windows Vista), the Windows key is in the middle of the keyboard, below all other keys (where the user's thumbs rest). On Windows 8 tablet computers, hardware certification requirements initially mandated that the Windows key be centered on the bezel below the screen, except on a convertible laptop, where the button is allowed to be off-center in a tablet configuration. This requirement was relaxed in Windows 8.1, allowing the Windows key to be placed on any bezel or edge of the unit, though a centered location along the bottom bezel is still preferred.  Licensing  Microsoft regulates the appearance of the Windows key logo picture with a specially crafted license for keyboard manufacturers (\\"Microsoft Windows Logo Key Logo License Agreement for Keyboard Manufacturers\\"). With the introduction of a new Microsoft Windows logo, first used with Windows XP, the agreement was updated to require that the new design be adopted for all keyboards manufactured after 1 September 2003.Amendment to the Windows Key Logo License Agreement (page no longer accessible) However, with the release of Windows Vista, Microsoft published guidelines for a new Windows Logo key that incorporates the Windows logo recessed in a chamfered lowered circle with a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 with respect to background that the key is applied to. In Common Building Block Keyboard Specification, all CBB compliant keyboards were to comply with the Windows Vista Hardware Start Button specification beginning on 1 June 2007. Wikipedia uses the Unicode character as a simulation of the logo.  Use with Microsoft Windows  On Windows 9x and Windows NT families of Windows operating system, tapping the Windows key by itself traditionally revealed Windows Taskbar (if not visible) and opened the Start menu. In Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8, this key launches the Start screen but doesn't show the taskbar. However, this feature was added back into Windows 10. Pressing the key in combination with other keys allows invoking many common functions through the keyboard. Holding down will not substitute for the Windows key in these combinations. Which Windows key combinations (\\"shortcuts\\") are available and active in a given Windows session depends on many factors, such as accessibility options, the type of the session (regular or Terminal Services), the Windows version, the presence of specific software such as IntelliType and Group Policy if applicable.

This shortcut also places the cursor directly on the search bar. (Disabled in Skype for Business 2016)  Use with non-Microsoft operating systems  The Windows key can also be used on other operating systems. On Unix and Unix-like operating systems, the key is usually given the X keysym \\"Super\\" (on earlier versions \\"Meta\\" was often used), and turns on the shift bit called MOD4. Most desktop environments use it much like Windows, with press+release popping up a primary menu similar to the Windows start menu (GNOME Shell bringing up the Activities Overview, Cinnamon pops up its main system menu), and with combinations with letters performing actions such as run-command, often with the shortcuts and actions copied from Windows. A common action that is not shared with Windows is for the key to allow dragging a window around from any location without raising it, and in the Compiz window manager it causes the scroll wheel to zoom in or out of any part of the desktop. If one plugs a Windows keyboard into a macOS computer, the Windows key acts as the . This swaps the locations of and from standard Macintosh keyboards.

In middle schools and high schools, GSAs are overseen by a responsible teacher. The first GSAs were established in the 1980s. Scientific studies show that GSAs have positive academic, health, and social impacts on schoolchildren of a minority sexual orientation and/or gender identity.Goodenow, C. , Szalacha, L. , & Westheimer, K.

History = Gay‚ÄìStraight Alliance at Concord  The first gay‚Äìstraight alliance was formed in November 1988 at the Concord Academy in Concord, Massachusetts, when Kevin Jennings, a history teacher at the school who had just come out as gay, was approached by Meredith Sterling, a student at the school who was straight, but was upset by the treatment of gay students and others. Jennings recruited some other teachers at the school, thus forming the first gay‚Äìstraight alliance. One of the first to join was Sterling's classmate S. Bear Bergman. Jennings credits students for both the establishment of the club, as well as for setting the agenda of struggling against homophobia, and for changes to 's nondiscrimination policy. Jennings would go on to found the Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network (GLSEN) in Boston in 1990. According to a thirty- year retrospective about the history of the group, Concord Academy reported in 2018 that students at the academy had renamed the group \\"a few years ago\\" to \\"\\". Faculty mentor Nancy Boutilier said, \\"That gay-straight language was really important at the time. Times change, though. To students today, that sounds so binary.\\"  GSA at Phillips Academy  A few months after Concord started the first Gay Straight Alliance club, another Massachusetts preparatory school north of Boston, Phillips Academy, started one of their own. It began with a meeting called by Phillips student Sharon Tentarelli for February 7, 1989, with little advance notice. A dozen people attended, including a mix of student, teachers, and staff. This was the second such group, after Concord Academy. The group was well-received, and some staff and faculty became supporters, both gay, and straight. Athletic director Kathy Henderson was one of the supporters, and she later went on to co-found the GLSEN two years later, along with Kevin Jennings of Concord Academy.  GSA Network  The GSA Network is an LGBT rights organization was founded in 1998 by Carolyn Laub to empower youth activists to start GSA clubs in their respective schools to motivate and inspire fellow students to fight against homophobia and transphobia. Laub initially started working with this movement in 40 GSA clubs in the San Francisco Bay area during 1988‚Äì99 and then gradually expanded to other cities and states. By 2001, The GSA Network became a statewide organization having branches in other schools in different parts of the state. In the year 2005, it began operating programs nationally. The year 2008 saw the GSA network become incorporated as its own independent 501(c)3 non-profit organization. Prior to that, it was a fiscally sponsored project of The Tides Center. In 2015, the network hired two long time staff to serve as Co-Executive Directors to replace outgoing founder and Executive Director Carolyn Laub. In 2016, the Gay-Straight Alliance Network formally changed its name to Genders & Sexualities Alliance Network and continues to network organizations representing over 4000 GSA clubs across the nation. The GSA Network organization is based in San Francisco and has regional offices in Los Angeles, Fresno, and New Orleans.  Goal  The goal of most gay‚Äìstraight alliances is to make their school community safe, facilitate activism on campus, and create a welcoming environment for LGBT students. They are part of the LGBT student movement and participate in national campaigns to raise awareness, such as the Day of Silence, National Coming Out Day, No Name Calling Week,No Name Calling Week Transgender Day of Remembrance, Harvey Milk Day, GSA day or locally organized campaigns, such as Take It Back: Anti-Slur Campaign, Beyond the Binary, LGBTQ-Inclusive Curriculum and others. Many GSAs work with local chapters of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) or Gay‚ÄìStraight Alliance Network, a national organization supporting youth leadership. The registered number of GSAs with GLSEN is over 4,000, as of 2008. In California, there are over 900 GSAs registered with GSA Network, representing over half of California's high schools. Over half the states in the United States have one or more statewide groups that work with GSAs. Many of these state based groups and local chapters of GLSEN participate in the National Association of GSA Networks. GSA Networks have been formed to help local area students to network and connect to local resources, provide training for youth leaders, and sponsor local GSA efforts. The inclusion of cisgender heterosexual allies in the missions of these groups \\"is an important distinguishing factor from early support groups for LGBT teens, and recognizes the need for a comprehensive approach to youth safety,\\" and attempts to build a network of support for non-heterosexual and transgender teens, as well as raising awareness of homophobia and heterosexism.  Impact = Outcomes  Social = LGBT students routinely experience harassment in their schools however, GSAs and other support clubs have been found to provide social support for LGBT students. Students have reported hearing homophobic remarks from both students and instructors in their schools.[null Kosciw, J. G., Greytak, E. A., Bartkiewicz, M. J., Boesen, M. J., & Palmer, N. A. (2011). The 2011 National School Climate Survey: The experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth in our nation's schools. New York: Gay, Lesbian, & Straight Education Network.] In addition, the more harassment students reported, the more likely the student also reported higher levels of depression and lower self-esteem. However, LGBT students attending a school with an active support club reported hearing less homophobic expressions and experienced less victimization than LGBT students attending a school without a GSA or support club. In addition, LGBT students with a GSA in their high school reported more positive outcomes when it came to high school belonging and school victimization. In addition to the mere presence of a GSA on campus, level of participation in a GSA has also been linked to the amount of social support reported by LGBT students. A 2011 study by Toomey, Ryan, Diaz and Russell (2011) found that the presence of a GSA, participation in a GSA, and perceived effectiveness of a GSA were each individually associated with youth's well being. In certain cases, research showed these three factors protected youth's well being against victimization. Furthermore, youths who participated in a GSA reported lower levels of depression and higher self- esteem. GSAs are important not only at the individual level, but also to promote the education of LGBT issues to school populations.Stonefish, T., & Lafreniere, K. D. (2015). \\"Embracing Diversity: The Dual Role of Gay-Straight Alliances.\\" Canadian Journal of Education, 38(4). GSA's have been found to promote social activism. Researchers have argued that GSAs are a grassroots student initiated form of activism. The same researchers claimed that GSAs are important to challenge the status quo, confront discrimination, and reconceptualize gender. = Academic = LGBT youths in schools across the US are subject to serious obstacles that may impact their ability to perform in school. A 2011 study found that two thirds of LGBT students reported feeling unsafe at school. Some students felt so unsafe that they reported missing school due to safety concerns. The same study found that the GPA of LGBT children was, on average, half a grade lower than straight. This may be an indicator that LGBT youth face different barriers to education than straight youth. LGBT youth's school experience may impact their life decisions. LGBT youth in high school were less likely to report that they wanted to pursue further education than straight youth. These findings suggest that LGBT youths' negative experiences in primary education relate to their decision not to continue on in the education system. This then robs LGBT youth of all of the opportunities that advanced education offers. However, an active GSA on a high school campus has been associated with better academic outcomes for LGBT students. LGBT youth attending schools with an active GSA were less likely to report feeling unsafe at school and were less likely to miss school due to a threat to their safety. Additionally, LGBT youths who had an active GSA at their high school reported higher educational attainment than LGBT youth who did not have a GSA on their high school campus. = Health = GSAs/QSAs are associated with better mental health outcomes, such as less depression less general psychological distress and higher self-esteem than students without a GSA at their high school. The positive impacts of GSAs/QSAs in students' lives include: increase in school attendance and attachment to the school, sense of empowerment and hope, new friendships, reduction in stress and isolation, increase in confidence and sense of pride. Students in schools that had an active GSA also reported less truancy\\"Gay-straight alliances are associated with student health: A multi school comparison of LGBTQ and heterosexual youth.\\" Journal of Research on Adolescence, 23, 319‚Äì330.). LGBT students with a support club in their school also reported lower levels of victimization and suicide attempts in comparison to schools without a support group). GSAs have also been associated with other reduced health risk factors. LGBT students with a GSA in their high school reported more positive outcomes when it came to alcohol use and problems related to alcohol use. LGBT students with support groups in their schools reported half as much dating violence and less casual sex. Students with an active GSA in their high school were also less likely to be threatened or injured at school in comparison to students without an active GSA.  Impact on students  GSAs are associated with benefits for LGBT students while they are attending school and beyond. The next important step is to understand why GSAs are associated with these benefits. One qualitative study found that the most beneficial aspect of a GSA was that it provides direct support to LGBTQ members and helps create a support network for LGBT students by connecting them.St. John, A., Travers, R., Munro, L., Liboro, R., Schneider, M., & Greig, C. L. (2014). \\"The Success of Gay-Straight Alliances in Waterloo Region, Ontario: A Confluence of Political and Social Factors.\\" Journal of LGBT Youth, 11(2), 150‚Äì170. Another qualitative study found that GSAs were beneficial to LGBTQ students because they act as a protective factor for LGBT students' educational and social experience in school. The study further explained that GSAs provided LGBT students with a sense of identity within their school, improved their self-esteem, and even provided students with courage and support to come out to their families and peers.McCormick, A., Schmidt, K., & Clifton, E. (2015). \\"Gay‚Äìstraight alliances: Understanding their impact on the academic and social experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning high school students.\\" Children & Schools, 37(2), 71‚Äì77. doi:10.1093/cs/cdu028 One study investigated some of the possible factors within GSAs to discover which specific components of GSAs were associated with which beneficial outcomes. This study found that when GSA advisors served for longer periods of time, students had better health outcomes. In addition, LGBT students who perceived they had more control over their GSA experience and LGBT students who perceived their school to be more supportive had healthier outcomes. In addition, this study reported that \\"students level of GSA advocacy also predicted students' sense of life purpose.\\"Poteat, V. P., Yoshikawa, H., Calzo, J. P., Gray, M. L., DiGiovanni, C. D., Lipkin, A., & Shaw, M. P.  Impact after high school  The relationship between having a GSA in a high school and attitudes towards LGBT individuals does not end after high school. The mere presence of a GSA, whether or not students participated in said GSA, is related to students' attitudes toward LGBT people beyond their time in their high school. University students who reported having a GSA in their high school were more likely to report positive attitudes towards LGBT individuals while attending their university.Worthen, M. F. (2014). \\"The interactive impacts of high school gay-straight alliances (GSAs) on college student attitudes toward LGBT individuals: An investigation of high school characteristics.\\" Journal of Homosexuality, 61(2), 217‚Äì250. doi:10.1080/00918369.2013.839906. This was true for all students except students whom were raised in the southern U.S. where having a GSA in one's high school actually correlated with less positive attitudes toward LGBT individuals.  Impact summary  GSAs are associated with positive social academic and health outcomes for LGBT students. The relationship between having a GSA in one's high school and certain positive social outcomes is known to last beyond high school, however little beyond that is known about the long lasting associations with high school GSAs. Further research should be conducted on the lasting effects if GSAs for LGBT individuals. Researchers have also claimed that GSAs are important not only to LGBT students, but also to change the school climate as a whole to be more informed and respectful of LGBT issues. It has also been claimed that GSAs are important to get students involved in social activism. Researchers should investigate the relationship between having a GSA in a high school the school's social climate. Due to the positive associations between GSAs and student outcomes, school faculty including school psychologists and counselors should become social justice advocates for LGBTQ students by supporting GSAs on their campuses.Bidell, M. P. (2011). \\"School Counselors and Social Justice Advocacy for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Questioning Students.\\" Journal of School Counseling, 9(10).  Accomplishments  The various accomplishments since the founding of the GSAs include: * GSAs have played a great leadership role in the grassroots by organizing the passage of many ground-breaking, statewide legislations, like the AB 537: The California Student Safety and Violence Prevention Act of 2000 which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. * It has achieved a critical victory as the plaintiff in the first lawsuit filed under AB 537; which was a three-year settlement agreement which required the Visalia schools to enact sweeping reforms including mandatory teacher and student trainings that would be supportive to LGBT students. * It also helped to pass 11 key laws to protect LGBT youth and create safer school environment. * They also launched the National Association of GSA Networks in 2005 to unite statewide organizations to support GSAs and to accelerate the growth and impact of the GSA movement nationwide. To date, there are 40 states which have joined the National Association in the United States of America alone.  History in the United States  Described as \\"perhaps the most important precursor of the GSA movement,\\" Los Angeles' Project 10 is seen as the start of the GSA movement. Founded in 1984, Project 10 was widely recognised as the first organised effort to provide support for LGBTQ youth in schools across the United States. The majority of its facilitators were heterosexual, and was named after the commonly-held statistic that 10 per cent of the adult male population is \\"exclusively homosexual\\". Project 10 focused on issues such as drug abuse, alcohol abuse, and discussing issues of high-risk sexual behavior. The first GSA was started in 1988, in Concord, Massachusetts at Concord Academy by Kevin Jennings. The first public school gay‚Äìstraight alliance was started at Newton South High School (Newton, Massachusetts) by teacher Robert Parlin.Jennings, Kevin: Mama's Boy, Preacher's Son: A Memoir, page 196. Beacon Press, 2006. GSAs made headlines in 1999 with the Federal Court ruling in Utah‚ÄìEast High Gay/Straight Alliance v. Board of Education of Salt Lake City School District.(81 F. Supp.2d 1166, 1197 (D. Utah 1999)) This ruling found that denying access to a school-based gay‚Äìstraight alliance was a violation of the Federal Equal Access Act giving students the right to use facilities for extra curricular activities at any school that receives public funding‚Äîregardless of private standing or religious affiliation. On January 24, 2012, the United States Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, released a video on YouTube commemorating GSA Day and endorsing GSA clubs in schools.  Inclusivity  Approximately 28 per cent of participants at GSA Network identify as heterosexual.  Opposition  Some students face opposition from school administrations, elected school boards, or local communities in starting a school GSA. In 2015, students at Brandon High School in Rankin County, Mississippi, attempted to start a GSA, but the school board met and publicly stated they wanted to prevent the formation of \\"gay clubs\\" in the school district. They then created a policy requiring parents to provide written permission before a student can join any club. Students then protested with support from the ACLU. Students at West Carteret High School in Morehead City, North Carolina tried to start a GSA but the Carteret County Board of Education turned it down. In 1999, the Orange Unified School District in Orange County, California moved to prohibit the formation of a GSA at El Modena High School. The students then sued the school board, claiming that their rights under the First Amendment and the 1984 Equal Access Act had been violated. In the first- ever ruling of its kind, Judge David O. Carter of the United States District Court for the Central District of California issued a preliminary injunction ordering the school to allow the GSA to meet. The right of students to establish a GSA at school is guaranteed by both the First Amendment to the United States Constitution (with regard to every level of schooling) and the federal Equal Access Act (with regard to secondary schools as long as other student clubs are allowed, with the definition of secondary school for purposes of the federal law including middle schools and high schools).  Case law  In the United States, the right of students to establish a GSA at school is guaranteed by both the First Amendment to the United States Constitution (with regard to every level of schooling) and the federal Equal Access Act (with regard to secondary schools where other student clubs are allowed, with the definition of secondary school for purposes of the federal law including middle schools and high schools). Since 1998, there have been at least 17 federal court cases in which high school and middle school students have conclusively prevailed in defending the free exercise of their civil rights on this issue, with federal courts consistently ruling that students have both a right to establish a GSA at school and to use the name Gay‚ÄìStraight Alliance instead of an alternative name. In 2000, the United States District Court for the Central District of California ruled in favor of high school students whose attempt to form a GSA had been blocked by the school board, in the case of Colin v. Orange Unified School District. In 2009, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida ruled in favor of high school students whose attempt to form a GSA had been blocked by the school board, in the case of Gay‚ÄìStraight Alliance of Yulee High School v. School Board of Nassau County, with the federal court also ruling that the school must allow the students to use the name Gay-Straight Alliance instead of an alternative name that excludes the term Gay. In 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit unanimously ruled in favor of middle school students whose attempt to form a GSA had been blocked by the school board, in the case of Carver Middle School Gay‚ÄìStraight Alliance v. School Board of Lake County, Florida.  History outside the United States  Worldwide, gay‚Äìstraight alliances are not as common as the organizations are in the United States, but are beginning to spread, particularly in Canada.  Australia  As of July 2020, as reported by the media Star Observer, Australia has one gay‚Äìstraight alliance set up within the Melbourne Grammar School. https://www.starobserver.com.au/opinion/why-australian-schools-need- gay-straight-alliances/196772 However, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Canada and some parts of the United States have had gay-straight alliances within schools for decades. In Australia, the group Safe Schools Coalition Victoria piloted a system of reducing homophobia though teacher training and student groups that promote inclusion of LGBT young people. Started by The Foundation for Young Australians and Gay and Lesbian Health Victoria, along with La Trobe University, the program was expanded to run Australia wide. The program is supported by Beyondblue, Headspace, the University of Canberra, Macquarie University, University of Western Sydney, Curtin University, various family planning and HIV prevention groups, government bodies and Uniting Church organizations.  Bulgaria  In 2016, Bulgaria became the first country in the Balkans to open a gay‚Äìstraight alliance in Sofia American College.  Canada  As Canada has two official languages, LGBT student clubs may be referred to as gay-straight alliances (GSA), queer-straight alliances (QSA), alliance allosexuelle-h√©t√©rosexuelle (AAH), or alliance gaie-h√©t√©ro (AGH). In May 2010 Egale Canada launched MyGSA.ca, a website focused on GSAs and their role in making Canadian schools safer and more LGBTQ inclusive. Their website includes educational resources for GSAs and information about available bursaries and funding. While MyGSA previously included a directory of registered Canadian GSA, this feature is no longer available on their website. Prior to closing the public directory, more than 283 GSAs had registered with the website. Currently there are no federal laws in Canada regarding GSAs. Any laws are specific to each province or territory. = British Columbia = The first GSA in Canada was started in 1998 at Pinetree Secondary School in Coquitlam, British Columbia. The start of the Pinetree GSA garnered national media attention, and its members continued to play a role in public affairs by meeting with successive provincial Ministers of Education, testifying before the B.C. Safe Schools Task Force on anti-bullying, and delivering workshops to students and educators about LGBT-sensitive inclusive language and how to start GSAs. In early 2002, the Pinetree GSA held the first Pride Day at a high school in Canada. The Pride Day included an information fair with booths from various local LGBT organizations, PrideTalk workshops delivered in numerous classes, and an assembly with a talk on transgender rights and a performance by G.L.A.S.S., a local LGBT youth choir. As of 2011, 41% of schools in British Columbia were reported to have a GSA. = Alberta = The first GSA in Alberta was started in 2000 at the Lindsay Thurber Comprehensive High School in Red Deer. While members initially feared backlash, there was little-to-no negative reaction to the club. In 2011, the Edmonton public school board introduced a policy which mandates that all school principals must establish a GSA if asked for one by students. The same year, the school board assigned a district consultant to provide support for GSAs within the city and host a monthly meeting for GSA members to network. In 2017, the NDP government of Alberta introduced Bill 24, the Act to Support Gay-Straight Alliances, which mandated that all schools within the province allow student to create a GSA, allow them to explicitly name it a gay-straight alliance or queer-straight alliance, and prohibits school officials from notifying parents if their child joined a GSA. Schools that do not comply with the bill's requirement are subject to lose government funding. Following the release of the bill, there was disapproval from some politicians and parents. In April 2018, the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms (JCCF) filed a Court of Queen's Bench challenge application claiming that prohibiting school officials from notifying parents when their child joins a GSA violates their constitutional rights. The New Democratic Party of Alberta filibustered for changes to the Bill 8 (The Education Amendment Act) since the United Conservative Party (UCP) defeated all amendments that would protect LGBTQ teachers and staff over their sexual orientation and gender identity. The UCP have removed protections that were in the 2017 Bill 24, Bill 8 allows for students to be outed by school teachers, administration or staff if a student asks for there to be a GSA or QSA. Albertan schools are no longer compelled to act in an urgent manner in the student's request for a GSA or QSA, allowing the school to take as much time as desired without facing penalties that were in Bill 24. = Saskatchewan = In Saskatchewan, Carlton Comprehensive High School houses one of the first GSA movements in the city of Prince Albert. The first GSA in the city of Saskatoon first met on March 18, 2003 at Mount Royal Collegiate. Since then, GSAs have been established at Nutana, Walter Murray, Evan Hardy, Marion Graham, Bedford Road and Aden Bowman Collegiates. The city of North Battleford Saskatchewan, had their first GSA in 2004 at Sakewew High School, a First Nations school. Saskatchewan's first GSA summit took place on April 15, 2016 in Saskatoon. = Manitoba = In 2013, the Manitoba government introduced Bill 18, The Public Schools Amendment Act (Safe and Inclusive Schools). This act required school board to accommodate all student requests to form GSAs. = Ontario = The first elementary school GSA in Ontario was started in 2008 at the Sunnyside Public School in Kitchener. In Ontario, Arnprior District High school, a small rural Ottawa Valley town started a GSA created by the students in 2009. This GSA won one of three Jer's Vision \\"Youth Role Model of The Year\\" awards in April 2009. The next year a GSA was founded by students in 2010 at Renfrew Collegiate Institute in the town of Renfrew. In December 2011, the government of the most populous Canadian province, Ontario, announced it would bring a legislation making it mandatory for all publicly funded schools to support the formation of \\"tolerance clubs\\" and student associations. Gay‚Äìstraight clubs were to be specifically mentioned in that act. The main focus of that Bill 14 would be to counterattack bullying of students, particularly those of a racial or sexual minority. Beyond a school group the Toronto District School Board has been committed to an unwritten alliance with their students. In addition to co-hosting the OUTShine GSA National Summit in 2013, they funded the Triangle Program at OASIS Alternative School, designed for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender students who are at risk of dropping out or committing self-harm because of harassment in regular schools. As of 2011, 37% of schools in Ontario were reported to have a GSA. = Quebec = New Brunswick = In 2008, the non-profit organization Pride in Education was founded to protect the safety and wellbeing of LGBT students in New Brunswick. In 2010, they held the first annual Pride in Education GSA Conference for students and teachers interested in creating GSAs. The first GSA in New Brunswick was founded in 2013 at Woodstock High School following the suggestion of Svend Robinson. = Prince Edward Island = The University of Prince Edward Island's Social Justice Studies program founded shOUT!, an annual conference aimed as GSAs but open to the public, in 2013. = Nova Scotia = In 1998, The Youth Project, a non- profit focused on LGBT youth in Nova Scotia, received funding from Health Canada to increase education about LGBT in schools. Through this initiative, the organization was able to found the first GSA in Nova Scotia at Millwood High School. The Youth Project currently hosts a list of all GSAs in the province on their website. = Newfoundland and Labrador = The first GSA conference in Newfoundland and Labrador was held at Corner Brook Regional High in 2013.last=Connors first=Colleen title=Students to create 'safe space' for LGBT community with Corner Brook conference publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation location=Corner Brook, NL date=April 29, 2016 url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/students-create- lgbt-safe-space-at-corner-brook-conference-1.3556672 access-date=March 20, 2019}} = Yukon = While the Yukon Department of Education does not have specific legislation regarding GSA, it does have a policy which mandates safety and inclusion for LGBT students which has been used in the justification for GSAs. Additionally, the territory mandates that all schools must appoint a staff member as a \\"safe contact\\" to provide support for LGBT students. In 2013, a group of student requested to start a GSA at Vanier Catholic Secondary in Whitehorse. The school initially denied this request as it conflicted with the school's Catholic, anti-gay policies. Students of the school protested the denial by wearing pink shirts and holding a sit-in at the Yukon legislative building and wearing rainbow socks to their graduation ceremony. Following the protests, the Yukon Department of Education overturned the school's policy regarding GSAs as it did not meet the mandates outlines in the department's Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Policy = Northwest Territories = Nunavut = The only GSA in Nunavut is at Inuksuk High School in Iqaluit.  Hong Kong  In 2008, students at The University of Hong Kong founded Queer Straight Alliance (QSA), a registered society under Hong Kong laws. For several years it was the only GSA in the city, and it serves students in all campuses through social activities, career support and advocacy. In more recent years, university students in the city have formed other student LGBT groups. However, GSA efforts in secondary schools remain limited, if any.  India  The first GSA in India was started in Tagore International School in New Delhi in 2014 by a group of students and their mentor Shivanee Sen who had formed a pro-LGBT group initiative known as 'Breaking Barriers' which was the first student-led campaign in India to address LGBTQI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex) issues. This group was first inspired to care and focus on the lives of oppressed students and hijras, a community of transgender women, intersex individuals, and eunuchs in India who are marginalized both socially and economically. At Presidency University, Kolkata, around 100 students have formed a GSA group called Ardhek Akash, which also produces a magazine of the same name. In recent months the group has formed new chapters at Jadavpur University and St. Xavier's College‚Äîalso in Calcutta‚Äîand is looking to expand further.  Mexico  The first GSA in Mexico was begun by a group of students in 2004 at the American School Foundation, a private American school in Mexico City. The GSA was initially opposed by several school board members and a small group of religious conservative parents. But the students eventually won and formed the student club. The GSA's co-advisor, Ian K. Macgillivray, wrote several articles detailing his students' experiences, as well as the book, Gay- Straight Alliances: A Handbook for Students, Educators, and Parents (2007, Harrington Park Press).  Netherlands  The first GSAs in the Netherlands were started in 2009. At the beginning of 2011, a nationwide campaign was started on television to promote GSAs in Dutch schools, featuring several well-known young actors and singers. A number of GSAs already exist in a wide variety of Dutch schools throughout the country, most of them at the university level, but increasingly popular on secondary school level.  New Zealand  Nelson College, the Nelson College for Girls, Nayland College and other schools have had GSAs set up, often with the support of youth mental health bodies. Kira Byrne, a GSA leader at Nelson College for Girls, says that the legalization of same-sex marriage in New Zealand in 2013 created shifts in attitudes towards LGBT people in New Zealand, but that boys at Nelson College were afraid to go to the GSA there because \\"other boys would wait outside to beat up anyone that came out.\\"  United Kingdom  In the UK, there has always been more of an emphasis on stand alone lesbian and gay youth groups that take place outside of the school setting, often funded by the local health authority or education service. The first GSA in the UK was founded in 2000 by CN Lester at Putney High School GDST, and led in part to the formation of Queer Youth Network. The second GSA in the UK was started in 2010 at Shimna Integrated College in Northern Ireland. Another GSA started in 2012 by Copland Community school in Wembley. The setting up of the club has subsequently resulted in the school being known for \\"tackling homophobic prejudice\\". Acland Burghley school in Camden set up a gay‚Äìstraight alliance in 2012 called Connected.  Portugal  Inspired by the gay-straight alliance model, ILGA Portugal released the project Alian√ßa da Diversidade (ADD), in English \\"Diversity Alliance\\", aimed to promote the creation of secondary level student groups (and teachers) from the north of the country. This aimed to make portuguese schools safer and more inclusive for everyone regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity or expression or sex characteristics, the integration of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex (LGBTI) students, and the eradication of homo, trans and biphobia, intersexism and gender expression based prejudice and discrimination in the school context, always promoting citizenship, human rights and gender equality. The project was co- financed by the Programa Operacional de Inclus√£o Social e Emprego, Portugal 2020 and the European Social Fund. As a complementary initiative to ADD, the Estudo Nacional sobre o Ambiente Escolar (ENAE), Portuguese for the \\"National School Environment Study\\", was launched to collect the experiences of LGBTI or questioning young people. According to Telmo Fernandes, ADD project coordinator, the responses confirmed the persistence of isolation and discrimination, reinforcing the urgency of the change that was intended with the project. Alian√ßas da Diversidade were created in various schools around the country, such as in Ovar municipality, Ramada parish and in the city of Ermesinde. The initiative started in mid-2017, formally ending in February 2019, but the maintenance of the groups created so far, as well as the creation of new ones with the same objective could continue independently.

It mostly consisted of the closely interconnected Italian- American Mafia and Jewish mob. Murder, Inc. committed hundreds of murders on behalf of the National Crime Syndicate during the 1930s and 1940s. History According to writers on organized crime, the Syndicate was an idea of Johnny Torrio, and was founded or established at a May 1929 conference in Atlantic City. It was attended by leading underworld figures throughout the United States, including Torrio, Lucky Luciano, Al Capone, Benjamin \\"Bugsy\\" Siegel, Frank Costello, Joe Adonis, Dutch Schultz, Abner \\"Longie\\" Zwillman, Louis \\"Lepke\\" Buchalter, Gambino crime family head Vincent Mangano, gambler Frank Erickson, Frank Scalice, and Albert \\"the Mad Hatter\\" Anastasia. Others described the Atlantic City meeting as a coordination and strategy conference for bootleggers. According to the findings of the United States Senate Special Committee in the 1950s, chaired by Estes Kefauver, the National Crime Syndicate was a confederation of mainly Italian and Jewish organized crime groups throughout the United States. The media dubbed the enforcement arm of the Syndicate \\"Murder, Inc.\\", a gang of Brooklyn mafiosi who carried out murders in the 1930s and 1940s for various crime bosses. It was headed by Buchalter and Anastasia, who reported to commission members Lansky and Adonis, and included many infamous mobsters. Murder Inc. consisted of two fractions. One was the Jewish Brownsville Boys headed by Abe \\"Kid Twist\\" Reles, who reported to Lepke Buchalter and Jacob \\"Gurrah\\" Shapiro. The other was the Italian Ocean Hill Hooligans led by Harry \\"Happy\\" Maione, who reported to Albert Anastasia. Bugsy Siegel was involved in many of Murder Incorporated's murders, but as a leading figure instead of a soldier. In his biography of Meyer Lansky, Little Man (1991), journalist Robert Lacey argued that no National Crime Syndicate ever existed. \\"The idea of a National Crime Syndicate is often confused with the Mafia. Yet they are not the same thing,\\" probably referring to the American Mafia. Although many of its members were imprisoned, and some were executed, the demise of the organization is as uncertain as its origins. By the late 1940s, Murder Inc. and most of its non-Italian components were defunct. Some individuals, such as Lansky, continued to operate as affiliates of Italian groups. In popular culture The National Crime Syndicate was the subject of numerous movies, mostly in the 1950s, some of which were inspired by the Kefauver hearings. Among them were 711 Ocean Drive (1950), which focuses on the nationwide gambling syndicate, and The Phenix City Story (1955), which describes the real-life takeover of a southern town by organized crime. A variation on the National Crime Syndicate (simply called \\"The Syndicate\\") is the main antagonist in most of the later seasons of Mission: Impossible and in the film Mission: Impossible ‚Äì Rogue Nation (2015). Along with the lives of its main members, the fictionalized founding of the Syndicate was depicted in the HBO series Boardwalk Empire. The National Crime Syndicate features heavily in Thomas Steadman's book The Flames of the West.

Extant representatives were not recognized as such until 1952; previously they were known only from the fossil record, and were previously thought to have become extinct over 380 million years ago. Although the shell of many monoplacophorans is limpet-like in shape, they are not gastropods, nor do they have any close relation to gastropods.  Definition  Discussion about monoplacophorans is made difficult by the slippery definition of the taxon; some authors take it to refer to all non-gastropod molluscs with a single shell, or all single-shelled molluscs with serially repeated units; whereas other workers restrict the definition to cap-shaped forms, excluding spiral and other shapes of shell. The inclusion of the gastropod-like Bellerophontoidea within the group is also contentious. One attempt to resolve this confusion was to separate out the predominantly coiled helcionelloids from the traditional, cap-like tergomyans, this latter group containing extant Tryblidiids.

The head region is on the left by the mouth. Monoplacophorans are univalved (though not gastropodal), limpet-shaped, and are untorted. They have a pseudometamerism of bilaterally symmetrical repeated organs and muscles. The extant members of the class live only in the deep ocean (the abyssal zone, the continental shelf, and the continental slope) at depths below . Cambrian forms predominately lived in shallow seas, whereas later Paleozoic forms are more commonly found in deeper waters with soft, muddy sea floors. Although superficially resembling limpets when viewed dorsally, monoplacophorans are not anatomically similar to gastropods. Some similarities are shared with the chitons, such as having segmented anatomy (organs arranged in series). There are eight pairs of dorso-ventral muscles (shell muscles). The nervous system is relatively simple, with no true ganglion present. The repeated organs include from three to six pairs of \\"gills\\" (actually ctenidia) located in a curved line along each side of the foot (though the number is not always considered definitive of a given species), and as many as six \\"kidneys\\" (actually nephridia). The tip or point of their low shells points forward rather than towards the back. The shell ranges from 3 mm to 37 mm in diameter depending on species. Like in chitons, the head is poorly defined, and there are no eyes. The mouth is located within the animal's undeveloped head in front of its single large foot and contains a radula, a defining characteristic of the mollusca. Tentacles are situated behind the mouth. They also have a cone-shaped stomach with a single crystalline style though no gastric shield. The intestines are long and make between four and six loops before reaching the posteriorly-positioned anus. Monoplacophorans also have oesophageal pouches. The sexes are separate with any given animal having two pair of either ovaries or testes connected to either the third or fourth pair of kidneys. One genus, Micropilina, has apparently been recorded as brooding young in the distal oviduct and pallial groove, releasing the young when approximately 300 micrometers in diameter.  Phylogenetic position  In 2006 a molecular study on Laevipilina antarctica suggested that extant Monoplacophora and Polyplacophora form a well-supported clade with the researched Neopilina closest to the chitons. The two classes in this new clade, with the proposed name Serialia, all show a variable number of serially repeated gills and eight sets of dorsoventral pedal retractor muscles. This study contradicts the fossil evidence, which suggests that the Monoplacophora are the sister group to the remainder of the conchiferans, and that the cephalopods (squids, octopuses, and relatives) arose from within the monoplacophoran lineage. However, some authors dispute this view and do not necessarily see modern Monoplacophora as related to their presumed fossil ancestors. The concept of Serialia is supported by other molecular studies. The fossil record does indicate that the ancestral mollusc was monoplacophoran-like and that the Polyplacophora arose from within the Monoplacophora - not the other way around. This could be reconciled if a secondary loss of shells caused a monoplacophoran body form to re-appear secondarily, which is plausible: At the very least, modern monoplacophorans are not closely related to vent-dwelling representatives from the Silurian. Cambrian monoplacophoran Knightoconus antarcticus is hypothesised to be an ancestor to the cephalopods.

They were an improvement over the and es, only about 35 to 40 tons larger, but more strongly built and with a slightly improved internal layout. One of the ballast tanks was converted to carry fuel, increasing range from to . This improvement was also made on some boats of the previous two classes.Friedman through 1945, pp. 209, 351 Further improvements were made beginning with SS-435, which are sometimes referred to as the Corsair class. Initial plans called for 80 to be built, but 51 were cancelled in 1944 and 1945 when it became apparent that they would not be needed to defeat Japan. The remaining 29 were commissioned between October 1944 (Tench) and February 1951 (Grenadier). The last submarine of the Tench class, as well as the last submarine which served during World War II, remaining in service with the U.S. Navy was USS Tigrone (AGSS-419) which was decommissioned on 27 June 1975. Design The as-built diesel-electric propulsion layout was the same as the last few Balao class, with four Fairbanks-Morse or General Motors Cleveland Division two-stroke diesel engines supplying two low-speed double-armature direct-drive electric motors to drive two shafts. All except received the Fairbanks-Morse 38D 8-1/8 engine with 10 cylinders; Corsair had GM 16-278A engines. The direct-drive electric motors were much quieter than the reduction gear arrangement of previous classes, and they made the drive train much more reliable due to the fact that the gearing was an element prone to shock damage from depth charges.Johnston, pp. 11 Two 126-cell -type lead-acid batteries provided submerged power to the electric motors. A design weakness of earlier classes solved by the Tench re-design were the ballast tank vent riser pipes that passed through the interior of the boat in the forward and after torpedo rooms. These pipes allowed #1 and #7 Main Ballast Tanks (MBT) (located in the single hull sections of the boat) to vent air during diving, which allowed water to flood into them from below. The tops of these tanks formed the walking deck in the interior of both rooms and thus the normal location of the vent valves (the top of the tank) could not be used. The riser pipes allowed the tanks to vent, but when the tanks were full these pipes contained water at full submergence pressure inside the torpedo rooms. If these pipes ruptured during depth charge attack, catastrophic flooding would occur. Solving this problem initially proved quite difficult, but ultimately required the complete rearrangement of the ballast tanks. #1 MBT was moved to a location forward of the end of the pressure hull, thus allowing it to vent directly into the superstructure like the rest of the MBT's. This move eliminated the riser pipes completely. #7 MBT, after stability and buoyancy calculations were run, was found to be redundant and was converted to a variable fuel oil/ballast tank, increasing the class's surfaced range. These changes forced a rearrangement of the associated piping runs and locations of many of the other tanks. Being almost entirely internal, these changes resulted in a boat that was visually almost indistinguishable from the earlier Balao class, with the exception of a sharper angle (or knuckle) at the lower corner of the bow (only visible when the boat was drydocked). Another difference was the elimination of small bulges around the motor room that previously accommodated the reduction gears. A significant benefit of the tank rearrangement was that these boats could carry four additional torpedoes in the forward torpedo room, for a total of 28. This was a change that had been asked for by submarine crews much earlier, but could not be accommodated in the earlier designs due to the lack of space in the torpedo rooms.Johnston, pp.11‚Äì12 Many targets in the Pacific War were sampans or otherwise not worth a torpedo, so the deck gun was an important weapon. Due to war experience, most Tench class were armed with a /25 caliber gun, and some boats had two of these. Additional anti-aircraft guns included single 40mm Bofors and twin 20mm Oerlikon mounts, usually one of each.Friedman through 1945, pp. 214-219 Ships in class 29 of these boats were built during and after World War II, commissioned from October 1944 through February 1951, with 11 commissioned postwar.Bauer and Roberts, pp. 280-282This includes , commissioned on 13 August 1945, the day hostilities ceased, as postwar. None of this class were lost in World War II. Ghazi (ex-Diablo (SS-479)) was lost in Pakistani service on 4 December 1971 during the Indo-Pakistani Naval War of 1971, possibly due to a minelaying accident. Some of the class served actively in the US Navy through the middle 1970s, others served into the 1990s with foreign navies, and one (Hai Shih ex-) is still active in Taiwan's Republic of China Navy. With one exception, these boats were all built at government owned shipyards; Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and Boston Navy Yard. Two boats, USS Wahoo (SS-516) and an unnamed boat designated SS-517 were laid down at Mare Island Navy Yard but canceled and broken up prior to completion. With the end of the war obviously near and due to a large construction backlog of Balao- class boats, the Electric Boat Company was only awarded contracts for three Tench-class boats, only one of which, , was completed. Electric Boat's follow on yard, the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company of Manitowoc, Wisconsin worked through its contracts for Balaos and was not awarded any Tench contracts. The Cramp Shipbuilding Company of Philadelphia, struggling with workforce problems and supply issues with its Balaos, was also not awarded any contracts.Johnston, pp. 13‚Äì14 Cancellations A total of 125 U.S. submarines were cancelled during World War II, all but three between 29 July 1944 and 12 August 1945. The exceptions were USS Wahoo (SS-516), , and , cancelled 7 January 1946. References vary considerably as to how many of these were Balaos and how many were Tenches. Some references simply assume all submarines numbered after SS-416 were Tench class; however, and were completed as Balaos.Silverstone, pp. 203‚Äì204; Gardiner and Chesneau, pp. 145‚Äì147. This yields 10 cancelled Balaos, SS-353-360 and 379‚Äì380. The Register of Ships of the U. S. Navy differs, considering every submarine not specifically ordered as a Tench to be a Balao, and further projecting SS-551-562 as a future class. This yields 62 cancelled Balao- , 51 cancelled Tench-, and 12 cancelled \\"SS-551\\"-class boats. Two of the cancelled Balaos, and , were launched incomplete and served for years as experimental hulks at Annapolis and Portsmouth Navy Yard. Two of the cancelled Tench-class boats, and , were also launched incomplete, never commissioned, but listed with the reserve fleet until struck in 1958 and scrapped in 1959. The cancelled hull numbers, including those launched incomplete, were SS-353-360 (Balao), 379‚Äì380 (Balao), 427‚Äì434 (Balao), 436‚Äì437 (Tench), 438‚Äì474 (Balao), 491‚Äì521 (Tench), 526-529 (Tench), 530‚Äì536 (Balao), 537-550 (Tench), and 551-562 (future). Service Periscope photo of Japanese merchant ship sinking. Ten of the 29 Tench-class submarines were completed in time to conduct war patrols in World War II, entering service beginning in late 1944. They finished what the previous classes had largely accomplished: the near-destruction of the Japanese merchant fleet. Another significant contribution was the rescue of downed aviators near Okinawa and Japan. Two additional boats (Cutlass and Diablo) entered Japanese waters on their first war patrols immediately after the 13 August 1945 cease-fire. Construction on the last four of the class was suspended, and they were completed 1948‚Äì1951. Postwar, 24 of the 29 Tenches were modernized under the Fleet Snorkel and Greater Underwater Propulsion Power (GUPPY) programs, with most continuing in US service into the early 1970s.GUPPY and other diesel boat conversions page Fourteen were transferred to foreign navies for years of additional service, and the former remained active in Taiwan's Republic of China Navy as Hai Shih as of 2015, the last of the class in service with any navy. Naval Reserve trainer Interested in maintaining a ready pool of trained reservists, the Navy assigned at least 58 submarines from 1946 to 1971 to various coastal and inland ports (even in Great Lakes ports such as Cleveland, Detroit, and Chicago), where they served as training platforms during the Reservists' weekend drills. At least three Tench-class boats served in this capacity. In this role, the boats were rendered incapable of diving and had their propellers removed. They were used strictly as pierside trainers. These were in commission but classed as \\"in commission in reserve\\", thus some were decommissioned and recommissioned on the same day to reflect the change in status.Friedman 1995, p. 285Reserve Training Boats at SubmarineSailor.comFriedman since 1945, pp. 228‚Äì231 Foreign service The large numbers of relatively modern, but surplus U.S. fleet submarines proved to be popular in sales, loans, or leases to allied foreign navies. Fourteen Tench-class submarines were transferred to foreign navies, most after serving over 25 years in the US Navy. These included 2 to Turkey, 1 to Greece, 2 to Italy, 1 to Pakistan, 1 to Canada, 4 to Brazil, 1 to Venezuela, 1 to Peru, and 1 to Taiwan. The Tench-class submarine ex- was transferred along with the Balao-class ex- to the Republic of China Navy as Hai Shih and Hai Pao in 1973; as of 2015 they remained in commission as the last US-built World War II-era submarines in service. was sold to the Royal Canadian Navy in 1968, renamed , decommissioned in 1974, and returned to the US for scrapping in 1977. was leased to the Pakistan Navy in 1963 and then as PNS Ghazi participated in two further wars, finally sinking in action in the Bay of Bengal with the loss of all 92 hands, on 4 December 1971 during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. Diablo was thus the last Tench-class submarine to see action.

Ko√ß Museum on the Golden Horn in Istanbul File:Ussdiablo.jpgPNS Ghazi File:HMCS Rainbow (SS-75).jpgHMCS Rainbow GUPPY and other conversions At the end of World War II, the US submarine force found itself in an awkward position. The 29 Tench-class submarines, designed to fight an enemy that no longer existed, were obsolescent despite the fact they were only one to three years old. The German Type XXI U-boat, with a large battery capacity, streamlining to maximize underwater speed, and a snorkel, was the submarine of the immediate future. The Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program (GUPPY) conversion program was developed to give some Balao- and Tench-class submarines similar capabilities to the Type XXI. When the cost of upgrading numerous submarines to GUPPY standard became apparent, the austere \\"Fleet Snorkel\\" conversion was developed to add snorkels and partial streamlining to some boats. A total of 16 Tench-class submarines were converted to one of the GUPPY configurations, with 8 additional boats receiving Fleet Snorkel modifications. Diablo, one of the Fleet Snorkel boats, was converted immediately prior to transfer to Pakistan. Most of the converted submarines were active into the early 1970s, when many were transferred to foreign navies for further service and others were decommissioned and disposed of. Although there was some variation in the GUPPY conversion programs, generally the original two Sargo batteries were replaced by four more compact Guppy (GUPPY I and II only) or Sargo II batteries via significant re- utilization of below-deck space, usually including removal of auxiliary diesels. All of these battery designs were of the lead-acid type. This increased the total number of battery cells from 252 to 504; the downside was the compact batteries had to be replaced every 18 months instead of every 5 years. The Sargo II battery was developed as a lower-cost alternative to the expensive Guppy battery.Friedman since 1945, p. 41 All GUPPYs received a snorkel, with a streamlined sail and bow. Also, the electric motors were upgraded to the direct drive double-armature type, along with modernized electrical and air conditioning systems. All Tench-class GUPPYs received sonar, fire control, and Electronic Support Measures (ESM) upgrades.Friedman since 1945, pp. 35‚Äì43 The Fleet Snorkel program was much more austere than the GUPPY modernizations, but is included here as it occurred during the GUPPY era. The GUPPY and Fleet Snorkel programs are listed in chronological order: GUPPY I, GUPPY II, GUPPY IA, Fleet Snorkel, GUPPY IIA, GUPPY IB, and GUPPY III. GUPPY I in GUPPY I configuration. Two Tench-class boats, and , were converted as prototypes for the GUPPY program in 1947. They proved very successful, though not initially fitted with snorkels. Pomodon achieved submerged on trials, though even the increased battery capacity only allowed one hour of operation at that speed. However, banking and depth control problems resulting from the high speed were noted and eventually compensated for. An advantage of streamlining was that active sonar detection range against a GUPPY was reduced by about 10%, and the higher submerged speed also severely impacted anti-submarine warfare efforts.Friedman since 1945, pp. 40‚Äì41 GUPPY II This was the first production GUPPY conversion, with most conversions occurring in 1947‚Äì49. Ten Tench-class boats received GUPPY II upgrades, including Odax and Pomodon in 1951, the two GUPPY I prototypes. This was the only production conversion with Guppy batteries. GUPPY IA in GUPPY IA configuration This was developed as a more cost-effective alternative to GUPPY II. Tench was converted in 1951. The less expensive Sargo II battery was introduced, along with other cost-saving measures. Fleet Snorkel in Fleet Snorkel configuration The Fleet Snorkel program was developed as an austere, cost-effective alternative to full GUPPY conversions, with significantly less improvement in submerged performance. Eight Tench-class boats received this upgrade, one immediately prior to foreign transfer (Diablo, to Pakistan as Ghazi). Most Fleet Snorkel conversions occurred 1951‚Äì52. Notably, the original pair of Sargo batteries was not upgraded. Each boat received a streamlined sail with a snorkel, along with upgraded sonar, air conditioning, and ESM. The original bow was left in place, except on three boats that received additional upper bow sonar. A few boats initially retained a 5-inch/25 caliber deck gun, but this was removed in the early 1950s. GUPPY IIA This was generally similar to GUPPY IA, except one of the forward diesel engines was removed to relieve machinery overcrowding. Four Tench-class boats received GUPPY IIA upgrades in 1952‚Äì54. GUPPY IB This was developed as an austere upgrade for two Gato-class and two Balao-class boats prior to transfer to foreign navies ( 2 each to Italy and The Netherlands ) in 1953‚Äì55. They lacked the sonar and electronics upgrades of other GUPPY conversions. GUPPY III in GUPPY III configuration. Nine submarines, three of them belonging to the Tench class, were upgraded from GUPPY II to GUPPY III in 1959‚Äì63 as part of the Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization II (FRAM II) program. All except the Balao-class , the pilot conversion, were lengthened by in the forward part of the control room to provide a new sonar space, berthing, electronics space, and storerooms. Tiru was lengthened only , and both forward diesel engines were removed.Friedman since 1945, p. 37 The other GUPPY IIIs retained all four engines. A taller \\"Northern\\" sail was included for improved surfaced operations in rough seas; this was also backfitted to some other GUPPY and Fleet Snorkel boats. The BQG-4 Passive Underwater Fire Control Feasibility Study (PUFFS) sonar system, with three tall domes topside, was fitted.Friedman since 1945, pp. 16‚Äì17 Additionally, fire control upgrades allowed the Mark 45 nuclear torpedo to be used.Friedman since 1945, p. 43 Radar picket The advent of the kamikaze demonstrated the need for a long range radar umbrella around the fleet. Radar picket destroyers and destroyer escorts were put into service, but they proved vulnerable in this role as they could be attacked as well, leaving the fleet blind. A submarine, though, could dive and escape aerial attack. Ten fleet submarines were converted for this role 1946‚Äì53 and redesignated SSR as radar picket submarines. Three Tench-class boats (, , and ) were among those converted; the latter two prototyped the concept in 1946. Eventually, the radar pickets were lengthened by 24 feet to provide additional space for an air control center and had powerful air search and height finding radars installed, with the after torpedo room converted into an electronics space with torpedoes and tubes removed. They also received a streamlined sail in place of the traditional conning tower fairwater. The most extensive SSR conversion was the \\"Migraine III\\" configuration. The SSRs proved only moderately successful, as the radars themselves proved troublesome and somewhat unreliable, and the boats' surface speed was insufficient to protect a fast-moving carrier group. The radars were removed and the boats reverted to general purpose submarines after 1959.Whitman, Edward C. \\"Cold War Curiosities: U.S. Radar Picket Submarines\\", Undersea Warfare, Winter-Spring 2002, Issue 14Friedman since 1945, pp. 90‚Äì94 Sonar test submarine was fitted with Bottom Reflection Active Sonar System II (BRASS II) sonar equipment in 1961 and was redesignated as an auxiliary submarine (AGSS) in 1962. BRASS II led to the sonar sphere used on the Thresher class and all subsequent US attack submarines. , formerly a radar picket submarine, was redesignated as an AGSS and converted to a sonar test submarine in 1963‚Äì64. She was given a unique configuration to test developmental sonar for the Naval Underwater Sound Laboratory. This included the removal of all torpedoes and tubes to allow room for sonar-related electronics. A large upper bow sonar dome and a forward extension of the sail were included, with a side-facing square sonar rack eventually added aft of the sail. The bow and sail domes were for BRASS III equipment.Friedman since 1945, pp. 70‚Äì72, 251 Follow-on studies In late 1944, the Bureau of Ships consulted with a group of submarine officers chaired by COMSUBPAC Admiral Charles A. Lockwood on specifications for a future submarine. Several designs were considered. The submarine officers wanted a deeper test depth, more torpedo tubes, and a higher speed, but got only part of what they wanted. The final design merged ambition with realism. Known as Design B, it was developed by May 1945. It was to be long, surfaced displacement ( submerged), with larger engines (12-cylinder Fairbanks-Morse with two-stage supercharging) for a speed of surfaced. Armament was to be twelve torpedo tubes (six forward, six aft), with six short external torpedo tubes in the superstructure for the swim-out Mark 27 acoustic homing anti-escort torpedo. The external tubes would be arranged with three each firing to port and starboard. Test depth would be increased to . The wind-down of submarine production in 1945 brought an end to this project. Had SS-551 through SS-562 not been cancelled, it is possible they would have been built to the new design.Friedman through 1945, pp. 248‚Äì251  Museums  Three Tench-class submarines are on display for the general public. * at the Carnegie Science Center in Pittsburgh, PA.USS Requin website at Carnegie Science Center *, moored at Pier Three, Baltimore's Inner Harbor, (alongside the National Aquarium in Baltimore) in Maryland.USS Torsk at Historic Ships in Baltimore website *TCG Ulu√ßalireis (S 338) (ex-), on display at Rahmi M.

A key figure in the Japanese New Wave, who continued working into the 21st century, Imamura is the only director from Japan to win two Palme d'Or awards. Early life Imamura was born to a comfortably upper-middle-class doctor's family in Tokyo in 1926. For a short time after 1945, when Japan was in a devastated condition following the war, Imamura participated in the black market selling cigarettes and liquor. Reflecting this period of his life, Imamura's interests as a filmmaker were usually focused on the lower strata of Japanese society. He studied Western history at Waseda University, but spent more time participating in theatrical and political activities. He cited a viewing of Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon in 1950 as an early inspiration, and said he saw it as an indication of the new freedom of expression possible in Japan in the post-war era.  Early career  Upon graduation from Waseda in 1951, Imamura began his film career working as an assistant to Yasujir≈ç Ozu at Shochiku Studios on the films Early Summer (1951), The Flavor of Green Tea over Rice (1952) and Tokyo Story (1953). Imamura, however, was uncomfortable with the way Ozu portrayed Japanese society. While Imamura's films were to have a quite different style from Ozu's, Imamura, like Ozu, was to focus on what he saw as particularly Japanese elements of society in his films. \\"I've always wanted to ask questions about the Japanese, because it's the only people I'm qualified to describe,\\" he said. He expressed surprise that his films were appreciated overseas. Nikkatsu Imamura left Shochiku in 1954 for a better salary at Nikkatsu. There he worked as an assistant director to Yuzo Kawashima and also co- authored the screenplay to Kawashima's Sun in the Last Days of the Shogunate. Much later he edited a book about Kawashima, entitled Sayonara dake ga jinsei da. In 1958, at Nikkatsu, Imamura made his first film, Stolen Desire. With this early tale of traveling actors, Imamura indulged in some of the controversial and eccentric themes that were to mark his career as a filmmaker. Nikkatsu, however, was not enthusiastic about his more radical tendencies, and forced him to make a series of lighter films with which he was not happy. Nishi Ginza Station was a comedy based on a pop-song. Endless Desire and My Second Brother were similar light fare that did not satisfy Imamura. His 1961 film, Pigs and Battleships was a wild and energetic story about the U.S. military base at Yokosuka and its relationship with lower elements of Japanese society. Shocked by the film and what they perceived as anti-American sentiments, Nikkatsu did not allow Imamura another project for two years. His next films, 1963's The Insect Woman and 1964's Unholy Desire showed no toning down of his style. With these three films, Imamura had established himself as a director with a strong and unique vision, and one of the leading figures of the Japanese New Wave. Seeing himself as a cultural anthropologist, Imamura stated, \\"I like to make messy films\\", and \\"I am interested in the relationship of the lower part of the human body and the lower part of the social structure... I ask myself what differentiates humans from other animals. What is a human being? I look for the answer by continuing to make films\\". Imamura Productions To more freely explore themes without studio interference, he established his own production company, Imamura Productions, in 1965. His first independent feature was a free adaptation of Akiyuki Nosaka's 1963 novel about life on the fringes of Osaka society, The Pornographers. He next made his first venture into the documentary genre with 1967's A Man Vanishes. His 1968 film The Profound Desire of the Gods investigates the clash between modern and traditional societies on a southern Japanese island. One of Imamura's more ambitious and costly projects, this film's poor box-office performance led to a retreat back into smaller, documentary-like films for the next decade. 1970s documentaries History of Postwar Japan as Told by a Bar Hostess and Karayuki-san, the Making of a Prostitute were two of these projects, both focusing on one of his favorite themes: Strong women who survive on the periphery of Japanese society. Imamura returned to fiction with 1979's Vengeance Is Mine, though this film about a serial killer is based on a true story. Imamura founded the Japan Institute of the Moving Image () as the Yokohama Vocational School of Broadcast and Film (Yokohama H≈çs≈ç Eiga Senmon Gakk≈ç) in 1975. While a student at this school, director Takashi Miike was given his first film credit, as assistant director on Imamura's 1987 film Zegen. 1980s and after Two large-scale remakes followed: (a re-imagining of Sun in the Last Days of the Shogunate) and , a re-telling of Keisuke Kinoshita's 1958 The Ballad of Narayama. His eldest son Daisuke Tengan is also a script writer and film director, and worked on the screenplays to Imamura's films The Eel (1997), Dr. Akagi (1998), Warm Water Under a Red Bridge (2001) and 11'09\\"01 September 11 (2002). Imamura played the role of a historian in the 2002 South Korean film 2009 Lost Memories.

These divisions which served in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign had been formed by Australian light horse, British yeomanry, and New Zealand mounted rifles brigades, supported by horse artillery, infantry and support troops. They were later joined by Indian cavalry and a small French cavalry detachment. The Desert Mounted Corps (DMC) comprised the ANZAC Mounted Division, the Australian Mounted Division and the Yeomanry Mounted Division, with infantry formations attached when required, as had Desert Column. In the first month of its existence, the corps continued training and patrolling no man's land preparing for manoeuvre warfare. Their first operations would be the attack, along with the XX Corps of the Battle of Beersheba. Having captured their objective they were involved in a series of battles, before the old Gaza to Beersheba line was finally broken a week later. During the pursuit they fought two Turkish armies at the Battle of Mughar Ridge before advancing to capture Jerusalem during the Battle of Jerusalem in December 1917. In 1918, units of Desert Mounted Corps participated in the Capture of Jericho in February, the First Transjordan attack on Amman in March and the Second Transjordan attack on Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt in April, while occupying the Jordan Valley during the summer. As a result of the Spring Offensive on the Western Front the corps went through a reorganisation, when the majority of the British yeomanry regiments were dismounted and sent as infantry reinforcements to France. The Yeomanry Mounted Division and the 5th Mounted Brigade were disbanded, to be replaced by Indian cavalry regiments, which formed the 4th Cavalry Division and 5th Cavalry Division. They arrived in the Jordan Valley in May to join the corps and in September with four divisions, participated in the major offensive operations of the Battle of Sharon, a section of the Battle of Megiddo. The subsequent pursuit to Damascus followed by the Pursuit to Haritan, advances of almost into Turkish territory, resulted in the capture of 107,000 prisoners and over 500 pieces of artillery. At the end of October, the Armistice of Mudros ended the war against the Ottoman Empire and the corps became an occupation force in Syria. By March 1919 units were patrolling Egypt during the Egyptian Revolution of 1919. The Desert Mounted Corps was disbanded in June 1919. Background The main responsibility of the British Empire forces in Egypt was the defence of the Suez Canal. Its passage greatly decreased the time at sea of men and materials from India, Australasia and the Far-East. The loss of the canal to the Ottoman Empire would be a huge propaganda coup for their opponents and increase the probability that Egypt would be reconquered by them.Mortlock 2010, p.3 After previously commanding the Cavalry Corps and the Third Army on the Western Front in France. General Edmund Allenby assumed command of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force on 28 June 1917.Powles 1922, p.122 At the time the situation in the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I was not promising. The British forces had withdrawn in defeat from Gallipoli and in the campaign in Mesopotamia had been surrounded and forced to surrender after the siege of Kut. In the Sinai campaign, the Turks had demonstrated their willingness to take the battle to the British, with their attack on the Suez Canal.Woodward 2006, p.4 Then after some initial British success at Romani, Maghaba and Rafa, they had just suffered two comprehensive defeats in the first and second battle of Gaza.Preston 1921, p.1 Following which they had remained on the defensive.Gullett 1941, p.354 Allenby's envisaged the employment of his mounted forces on a much larger scale than his predecessor had.Preston 1921, p.7 So under the command of Lieutenant-General Harry Chauvel the Desert Mounted Corps was formed on 12 August 1917.Powles 1922, p.12Preston 1921, pp.8‚Äì9 It had been intended to use the name II Cavalry Corps, but the name was chosen in recognition of its predecessor the Desert Column.Bou 2009, p.166 Chauvel outlined the reasons on 3 September 1920: \\"The name of the original Desert Column was preserved as far as possible in the title of the new Cavalry Corps, as most of the troops composing it had fought throughout the Sinai Campaign, and by them much had already been accomplished.\\"Preston 1921 p. viii The corps initially had three divisions, the Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division (ANZ MTD DIV) with the 1st Light Horse, 2nd Light Horse and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigades. The Australian Mounted Division (AUS MTD DIV) with the 3rd Light Horse, 4th Light Horse and the 5th Mounted Brigade. Finally the Yeomanry Mounted Division (YEO MTD DIV) with the 6th Mounted, 8th Mounted and the 22nd Mounted Brigades. Two other brigades the 7th Mounted and the Imperial Camel Corps were the corps reserve. However the dismounted strength of these brigades, of three regiments, was only the equivalent in rifle fire to an infantry battalion, as one men in every four was required to control their horses.Preston 1921, p.168 Other components in the brigade were a horse artillery battery, a machine gun squadron, a signal troop, a field troop, a mobile veterinary section, a mounted field ambulance and an ammunition column.Powles 1922, p.3 Reorganisation Lieutenant- General Harry Chauvel commander Desert Mounted Corps In April 1918 in response to the German spring offensive in France, every available man that could be spared was sent to reinforce the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front. The Desert Mounted Corps lost the majority of its yeomanry regiments, who were dismounted and retrained to serve as infantry or machine-gun companies. This necessitated the disbandment of the Yeomanry Mounted Division. Which could have had serious consequences on the corps future operations. But the yeomanry were replaced in theatre by experienced British Indian Army cavalry regiments, that had been fighting in France since 1914. Allenby used these new regiments to raise two new divisions. The 4th Cavalry Division with the 10th Cavalry, 11th Cavalry and 12th Cavalry Brigades. The 5th Cavalry Division was slightly different having the 13th Cavalry, 14th Cavalry and the 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigades. Indian cavalry lancer Each of the cavalry brigades had one yeomanry and two Indian regiments, except the 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigade which had three regiments of Indian Imperial Service Troops. With the move from the Sinai desert into southern Palestine there was now no need for a camel force. In June the Imperial Service Camel Brigade was also disbanded, its battalions were instead mounted on horses and used to form the 5th Light Horse Brigade. Which replaced the yeomanry 5th Mounted Brigade in the Australian Mounted Division, bringing that division back up to full strength. The corps now comprised four divisions but had lost its mounted reserve force, and there was no increase in the ten horse artillery batteries, it did however gain its own infantry sub unit, the 20th Indian Brigade. Formation Between General Murray's recall in early June, and the arrival of Allenby late in June 1917, Chetwode as commander of Eastern Force gave Chauvel as commander of Desert Column, oversight for the establishment of the Yeomanry Mounted Division.Hill 1978 p. 116Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 357Keogh 1955 pp. 125‚Äì6 On 21 June, the Imperial Mounted Division became the Australian Mounted Division. On 26 June the 6th Mounted Brigade was transferred from the Australian Mounted Division, and the 22nd Mounted Brigade from the ANZAC Mounted Division, and along with the recently arrived 8th Mounted Brigade, formed the Yeomanry Mounted Division. The 7th Mounted Brigade with the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade were corps troops.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 357, Vol. 2 pp. 661‚Äì2 Desert Column was reorganised from two mounted divisions of four brigades, into three mounted divisions of three brigades: The ANZAC Mounted Division, Australian Mounted Division and the Yeomanry Mounted Division.Wavell 1968 pp. 190‚Äì1 Allenby indicated to Robertson on 12 July, that he planned to reorganise the EEF into two infantry and a mounted corps, directly under General Headquarters.Hughes 2004 p. 35 The structure of the EEF, would resemble the organisation of the force Allenby had commanded in France, which had reflected contemporary British combat doctrine, in the middle of 1917.Erickson 2007 pp. 112‚Äì3Grainger 2006 pp. 239‚Äì40 Further, in order for him to directly command these corps in the field, Allenby created two EEF headquarters. His battle headquarters was established near Khan Yunis, while the remainder of his headquarters staff stayed in Cairo, so they could deal with the political and administrative aspects of control of Egypt and martial law.Allenby to Robertson 12 July 1917 in Hughes 2004 p. 35 On 12 August a conventional corps headquarters, designated the XX Corps and commanded by Lieutenant General P. W. Chetwode replaced Eastern Force. The headquarters of the XXI Corps commanded by Lieutenant General E. S. Bulfin (arrived from Salonika as officer commanding the 60th (London) Division) was formed, while the headquarters of Desert Column was renamed Desert Mounted Corps commanded by Lieutenant General H. G. Chauvel.Cutlack 1941 pp. 63‚Äì4Hill 1978 p. 118Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 16 Service history=1917 Australian Light Horsemen The first operation planned for the Desert Mounted Corps was to break through the Turkish lines, in southern Palestine, which stretched for from Beersheba in the east to the Mediterranean coast at Gaza in the west.Powles 1922, p. 128 Once Beersheba was secured the mounted troops would be concentrated on the British right to cut off and destroy the retreating Turkish forces.Preston 1921, p. 11 Any mounted attack on Beersheba would require a march of over dry and unknown country. So prior to the attack a reconnaissance of the Turkish positions was carried out mapping tracks and wadi crossings. Chauvel deployed his corps, with one division forward occupying a lightly held line between Shellal and El Gamli. Which was also responsible for short patrols into no man's land and longer patrols to reconnoitre the Turkish defences. A second division supported the front line based around Abasan el Kebir. While the third division was resting at Tel el Marrakeb. Each month the divisions moved around so no one division spent longer at the front than was necessary.Preston 1921, p.12 To prepare for the coming offensive each man was issued an officers-style saddle wallet, in which they could carry three days' rations and some spare clothing. Attached to the saddle were two nosebags with or two days of grain for the horse. A third day's grain and two days' rations for the men were carried with the divisional train.Preston 1921, pp. 12‚Äì13Powles 1922, p. 135 Every two weeks the forward division would move en masse towards Beersheba; leaving in the afternoon they marched all night to be in a position on the high ground in front of town by dawn the next day. There they remained all day and returned to their base the following night. These long-range patrols got the men and horses used to desert travel, with no water available for the horses from the afternoon they left until they returned. These patrols were not without danger and they were often attacked by Turkish aircraft and artillery which had previously registered approach routes, wadi crossings and the high ground.Preston 1921, p.13 The patrols accustomed the Turks to the appearance of British troops in front of Beersheba, without them taking any offensive action before withdrawing again.Gullett 1941, p.375 This patrol routine continued until the end of October when the corps moved forward for the coming offensive.Preston 1921, p.17 Map detailing movements during the Battle of Beersheba After dark 30 October the ANZ MTD DIV headed for Beersheba securing their first objectives by 08:00 the next morning. The 2nd Brigade moved on Tel el Sakaty hill, the New Zealand Brigade towards Tel el Saba, while the 1st LH Brigade was the reserve. At 10:00 the Australian Division reached their start point the Khashim Zanna hill overlooking Beersheba, sending patrols forward to reconnoitre a way into the town. At the same time the advancing 7th Brigade was forced to dismount in the face of heavy opposition from well constructed Turkish defences.Preston 1921, pp.23‚Äì24 Now the ANZ MTD DIV was also facing heavy resistance and it was not until 13:00 that the 2nd Brigade captured Tel el Sakaty and at 13:30 cut the road north to Jerusalem.Preston 1921, p.24 Around the same time that XX Corps secured their objectives in the west.Preston 1921, p.25 By now the New Zealand Brigade was unable to proceed being pinned down by Turkish artillery and machine-gun fire. The 3rd LH Brigade with the divisional artillery were sent to assist the attack from the south. Major-General Edward Chaytor in command of the ANZ MTD DIV, committed his reserve 1st Light Horse Brigade to support the southern attack.Preston 1921, p.26 The 2nd and 3rd Light Horse Regiments unable to approach their objectives under cover, charged in the open through artillery and machine-gun fire, until they reached a depression in the ground short of their target where they were able to dismount and fight forward on foot.Preston 1921, p.27 At 14:00 the 2nd Light Horse Regiment captured their objective and relieved the pressure in front of the New Zealanders, who carried out a bayonet charge capturing their own objective, 120 prisoners and several machine-guns. The last defences in front of Beersheba had been taken, but there was still a large expanse of open ground to be crossed in front of the town itself.Preston 1921, pp.28‚Äì29 The two divisions, less the 5th MTD Brigade, were ordered to mount up and capture Beersheba before dark. The 4th LH Brigade, away, which until then had seen no fighting received the order at 16:30. Brigadier-General William Grant in command of the brigade, realising that sunset was only half- an-hour away decided to charge the town from the south-east. Asking for artillery support he set out with his two available regiments. The 1/1st Nottinghamshire Royal Horse Artillery (RHA) and 1/A Battery, Honourable Artillery Company (HAC) galloped into the open, halted short of the town and opened fire. Which was the signal for Grants brigade to charge the Turkish defences. Jumping the two lines of trenches the brigade dismounted and within ten minutes had captured the position. Grant rallied his brigade, left a small guard force behind and charged into Beersheba and by 18:00 had secured the town, capturing 1,200 prisoners and fourteen artillery guns.Preston 1921, p.30 A Battery, Honourable Artillery Companys 13-pounder guns The AUS MTD DIV occupied the town while the ANZ MTD DIV put out a skirmish line to the north and north-west.Preston 1921, p.31 With Beersheba secure phase two the attack on Gaza began at 23:00 1 November and by 06:30 the next morning the front line had been penetrated and the Turkish defenders withdrawing.Preston 1921, p.32 Phase three was an attack on the open Turkish left flank, supported by the 53rd (Welsh) Division and the Camel Corps Brigade. The ANZ MTD DIV advanced to the Hebron road, near Bir el Makruneh, capturing 200 prisoners and several machine-guns en route. Operations were curtailed by lack of water in the region which necessitated the corps keeping the AUS MTD DIV in Beersheba. The town did originally have an ample water supply from seven wells but five of them had been destroyed by the Turks during the battle.Preston 1921, pp.32‚Äì33 Over the next five days the ANZ MTD DIV, the 5th, 7th Mounted and the Camel Corps Brigades and the 53rd Division pushed northwards and held out at Tel Khuweilfeh against a Turkish counter-attack from the 3rd Cavalry Division, the 19th, 27th and part of the 16th Divisions.Preston 1921, pp.38‚Äì39 With all the Turkish reserves concentrated on the Desert Mounted Corps front, on 6 November when XXI Corps attacked in the west they captured all their first day objectives.Preston 1921, p.43 That evening the AUS MTD DIV moved to the Sharia region in preparation for the expected breakthrough and pursuit of the retreating Turkish forces. The ANZ and AUS MTD DIVs were ordered to move into the Turkish rear area as soon as their path was clear, the ANZ MTD DIV on the right. The YEO MTD DIV would remain behind with the 53rd Division. In part the deployment was influenced by the available water supplies to their front.Preston 1921, p.44 On 7 November the AUS MTD DIV was fighting dismounted in support of the 60th (2/2nd London) Division and darkness had fallen before they could mount up and pursue the retreating Turks. The ANZ MTD DIV had better luck and had found a hole in the Turkish front and had advance to the train station at Umm el Ameidat on the Junction Station-Beersheba rail line, capturing 400 prisoners and a large quantity of ammunition and stores. By that night the division had moved forward a further east and engaged a strong Turkish rearguard position.Preston 1921, pp.45‚Äì46 Elsewhere on 7 November the XXI Corps had eventually succeeded in capturing Gaza.Preston 1921, p.48 Pursuit from Gaza Men of the 7th Mounted Brigade in Salonika Over the night of 7/8 November there was a general Turkish withdrawal, the Desert Mounted Corps supported by the 60th Division were ordered to advance at dawn 8 November at their best speed to the north-west in an attempt to cut off the retreating Gaza garrison. The ANZ MTD DIV, with the 7th Mounted Brigade attached, were given the objective of Bureir, north-east of Gaza, to their left was the AUS MTD DIV then the 60th Division. The corps advance was met by pockets of resistance, varying in size from company to several regiments, but the speed of the British advance had prevented them forming any type of organised defences.Preston 1921, pp.50‚Äì51 At 11:00 the Turks managed to gather enough of a force together to counter-attack the 2nd LH Brigade at Tel el Nejile which brought the ANZ MTD DIV to a halt. Chaytor pushed the 7th MTD Brigade through his centre towards Bir el Jemameh, where it was known there was a supply of water. At 13:00 just before they reached the village they also were counter-attacked, which drove back their left flank. The brigade only being saved by the arrival of the 1st LH Brigade from the west, which forced the Turks back. The light horsemen continued into the village, capturing the water pumping station intact and the high ground to the north.Preston 1921, p.51 The AUS MTD DIV and 60th Divisions were also successful and fought several small battles during which they captured a number of heavy howitzers by the simple tactic of going round and charging the position from the rear. At 15:00 the 60th Division came under heavy artillery fire from the area of Huj and requested help from some passing squadrons of the Warwickshire Yeomanry and Queen's Own Worcestershire Hussars, part of the 5th MTD Brigade. Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh Cheape of the Warwicks led the force into dead ground to about from the Turkish guns unobserved. Huj was the location of the Turkish Headquarters, the terminus of their military rail line from the coast.Powles 1922, p.143 The position consisted of a battery of field artillery another of mountain artillery and four machine-guns forward with another two artillery batteries and three heavy howitzers in a depth position at the rear. The yeomanry squadrons came out of the dead ground, charged the position from the flank and had almost reached it before the Turks managed to turn their guns around and opened fire at point blank range.Preston 1921, p.53 The fight was over in minutes the Turkish gunners killed or wounded and the positions twelve guns captured. British loses were heavy of the 170 men that started the charge seventy-five were killed or wounded.Preston 1921, p.54 With Huj captured the AUS MTD DIV were able to move in and water their horses, the successful charge also captured the main Turkish ammunition depot and their radio code books which were used to decipher Turkish signals until January 1918.Preston 1921, p.56 That afternoon the 4th Brigade was ordered to turn left and try and link up with XXI Corps advancing along the coast. Moving at their best speed, at times going around instead of fighting through Turkish positions, the brigade linked up with the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade just before dark near Beit Hanun.Preston 1921, p.52 Also on 8 November the YEO MTD DIV had moved to the British left, to attack the Turkish right which would force them across the front of the 53rd Division and the Camel Corps Brigade at Tel KhuweiKeh. The 8th MTD Brigade began the attack but were dislodge the Turkish defenders before being ordered back to Sharia, to prepare for a pursuit of the Turkish forces withdrawing on the coastal plain.Preston 1921, p.58 The attempt to cut off the Gaza garrison had failed, their strong rearguard resistance and the scarcity of water had both played a part in stopping the corps from fulfilling their objective. The corps instead was ordered to pursue the retreating Turkish forces. The ANZ MTD DIV objectives would be Bureir and then El Mejdel. The AUS MTD DIV on their right had Arak el Menshiye and El Faluje as their objectives. The YEO MTD DIV would advance along the coast. Just after day break on 9 November the ANZ MTD DIV moved out, meeting only light opposition the 1st LH Brigade entered Bureir at 08:30. The 2nd LH Brigade was approaching El Huleikat about an hour later when they come upon a rearguard position on the high ground to the north-west of the village, dismounting the brigade attacked capturing 600 prisoners. The 1st LH Brigade reached El Mejdel at noon, defeating the Turkish defenders in a brief fight taking 170 prisoners and capturing the water supply intact.Preston 1921, p.59 Orders were received to support the advance of XXI Corps, to do so the ANZ MTD DIV were ordered to press on to Beit Duras in the north-east. By nightfall the 1st LH Brigade had reached Esdud, and the 2nd LH Brigade after capturing a Turkish convoy and 350 prisoners en route captured another 200 prisoners at the villages of Suafir el Sharkiye and Arak Suweidan.Preston 1921, p.60 Part of the Australian Mounted Division supply train The AUS MTD DIV spent 9 November watering its horse and did not set out until that evening, for their objective Tel el Hesi, Arak el Menshiye and El Faluje. Travelling by night the 3rd LH Brigade with an artillery battery was in front with the 4th LH and 5th MTD Brigades following on behind. At 04:30 they stopped at Tel el Hesi to wait for daylight before continuing.Preston 1921, p.61 They eventually linked up with the ANZ MTD DIV at 08:00. The YEO MTD DIV arrived some hours later, so by mid-afternoon 10 November the corps less the New Zealand Brigade was in a line from Arak el Menshiy to the coast. The corps had advanced but problems with supplies were becoming acute, the corps horses alone required over of fodder a day. The only supply line was an un-metalled road between Gaza and Junction Station, some of it through deep sand which the army's trucks could not negotiate fully loaded.Preston 1921, p.62 To continue the advance it was decided that some of the infantry would remain in their present positions. Only the 53rd Division from XX Corps and the 52nd (Lowland) and 75th Divisions from XXI Corps continued with the advance. The Desert Mounted Corps divisions were in a bad shape having fought for several days without any rest and were short of water, some of the horses had been without water for over eighty-four hours, food for the men and forage was also in short supply. The delay allowed the Turkish forces to consolidate and by 10 November they were constructing a new defence line from Tel el Murre on the coast, along the high ground on the right bank of the Nahr Sukereir river, through Burka to Kustine.Preston 1921, pp.64‚Äì65 Mughar Ridge British yeomanry reconnaissance patrol On 10 November, the 1st LH Brigade out in front of the corps captured intact a bridge at Jisr Esdud, digging in on the north bank of the river, the brigade held out against a Turkish counter-attack supported by artillery.Preston 1921, p.65 In the east the YEO and AUS MTD DIVs located Turkish defences from Kustine, to Beit Jibrin.Preston 1921, p.66 In order for the infantry to catch up with the corps, Allenby ordered them to hold firm until 13 November. His plan was to attack the centre with his infantry while the mounted troops moved around their open right flank. The YEO MTD DIV which was still in relatively good shape was ordered, along with the Camel Corps Brigade and the New Zealand Brigade, to move to the coast and relieve the Anzac Mounted Division, except the 1st LH Brigade holding the bridgehead. The AUS MTD DIV would remain in the east around Zeita, defending the British right flank.Preston 1921, pp.68‚Äì69 Brigadier-General Charles Cox in command of the 1st LH Brigade was ordered to enlarge their bridgehead. Unable to find a suitable ford, during the night of 11/12 November the 2nd Light Horse Regiment swam their horses across the river, then captured the Turkish position on the Tel el Murre hill with a bayonet charge.Preston 1921, p.69 Later the same day the 52nd (Lowland) and 75th Divisions crossed the bridgehead and within ninety minutes had captured Burka.Preston 1921, p.71 On the right flank the patrolling by the AUS MTD DIV had convinced the Turks that they were confronted there by a much larger force. At 13:00 they sent a force of around 5,000 men in two pincer columns against Balin defended by the 5th MTD Brigade. The manoeuvre almost surrounded the British position, 'B' Battery H.A.C. was forced to withdraw its guns by sections, firing at point blank range, to cover the section pulling back. The brigade had only just managed to extradite itself from the village, when the Turks turned on the 3rd LH Brigade at Berkusie. The situation was critical so Major General H Hodgson ordered the division to withdraw to Bir Summeil and Khurbet Jeladiyeh. As the order was going out a train loaded with Turkish reinforcements arrived and attacked the 5th MTD Brigade.Preston 1921, pp.72‚Äì73 But by now the divisions artillery was in position to intervene and broke up the Turkish attack allowing the 5th MTD and 3rd LH Brigades to withdrew to Summeil, where they were able to hold on against the Turkish offensive.Preston 1921, p.74 A new British assault began on 13 November, with the YEO MTD DIV on the left of the two infantry divisions and the AUS MTD DIV to their right. The 7th MTD Brigade replaced the exhausted 5th MTD Brigade in the AUS MTD DIV and the 2nd LH Brigade became the corps reserve.Preston 1921, p.77 At 08:00 the 8th MTD Brigade had reached the village of Yebnah, which was only held by a small Turkish force. Fighting through they made for the villages of Zernuka and Kubeibe, the last Turkish positions on their right.Preston 1921, pp.78‚Äì79 Both villages were heavily defended with several machine-guns and the brigades progress faltered. Keeping the 6th MTD Brigade as the YEO MTD DIV reserve the 22nd MTD Brigade was dispatched to force a way between Zernuka and El Mughar and occupy Aqir in the Turkish rear, but the 22nd were also stopped by heavy machine-gun fire. The 52nd Division attempting to attack El Mughar were also stopped in their tracks and requested the YEO MTD DIV assist them by attacking the village from the east.Preston 1921, p.79 The 6th MTD Brigade were given the task, Brigadier-General C.A.C. Godwin ordered the Royal Buckinghamshire Yeomanry and the Queen's Own Dorset Yeomanry to charge across of open ground, supported by their own artillery and machine-guns, to assault the village.Preston 1921, p.80 Within minutes the Buckinghamshire Yeomanry had charged through the Turkish lines securing the position. The Dorset's had a more difficult approach but both regiments were successful, for the loss of 129 men and 265 horses killed and wounded, they had killed 600 Turkish soldiers, captured another 1,100 prisoners, three artillery guns and several machine-guns. The 22nd MTD Brigade then pushed on to assault Aqir but was held up by strong Turkish defences, but they did capture another seventy prisoners and some machine-guns.Preston 1921, pp.82‚Äì84 Australian patrol with locals The 75th Division had also secured their objective and held out against a Turkish night time counter-attack and on the right the AUS MTD DIV captured Tel el Turmus virtually unopposed.Preston 1921, p.84 The next day the Turkish forces were withdrawing and the corps were once again order in pursuit. Early in the day the AUS MTD DIV captured El Tine train station with large quantities of ammunition and other stores. Pushing on they penetrated behind the previous Turkish front line to a position east of Junction Station. The YEO MTD DIV, leading the 52nd Division captured Aqir and Naane unopposed except for some artillery shelling.Preston 1921, p.85 The British attack had divided the Turkish forces in two. The larger contingent headed inland over the hills towards Jerusalem, pursued by the YEO MTD and AUS MTD DIVs. While the smaller force headed up the coast followed by the ANZ MTD DIV. The 1st LH and New Zealand Brigades captured Kubeibe and Zernuka in the morning, and continued towards Ramleh and Khurbet Surafend. While the Camel Corps advanced up the sand dunes on the extreme left. At 14:00 the New Zealand Brigade encountered a Turkish force at Ayun Kara but defeated them without much difficulty. Then half an hour later the brigade was surprised and surrounded only holding out following a bayonet charge. Reinforced by the 1st Light Horse and Camel Corps Brigades the New Zealanders held out for the rest of the day.Preston 1921, p.86 The advance continued and on 15 November the ANZ MTD DIV captured Ramleh and 350 prisoners with no opposition, followed the next day by the New Zealand Brigade entering Jaffa. By now the Turkish forces were entrenched along the north bank of the Nahr el Auja River and the ANZ MTD DIV was ordered to halt, while the army concentrated on capturing Jerusalem.Preston 1921, p.88 Since Beersheba the Desert Mounted Corps had advanced captured 5,720 prisoners, sixty artillery guns, fifty machine guns and large stocks of ammunition and other equipment.Powles 1922, p.151 Jerusalem On 17 November the YEO MTD DIV pursuing the retreating Turkish forces through the hills in front of Jerusalem, came upon a strong rearguard position, on the ridge line between the villages of Sidun and Abu Shusheh. A force of 4,000 men supported by artillery and machine-guns the majority of which around Abu Shusheh, with a depth position to its south. Major-General George de S. Barrow ordered the 22nd MTD Brigade to attack the position from the north, the Camel Corps Brigade from the north-west and the 6th MTD Brigade from the south- west.Preston 1921, p.89 At 07:00 the 22nd MTD and Camel Corps Brigades attacked on foot. Goodwin in command of the 6th MTD Brigade decided to attack mounted. He dispatched half of his machine-gun squadron and a squadron from the Berkshire Yeomanry forward to provide covering fire assisted by the Berkshire Battery R.H.A. located south-west of the village. He ordered the Buckinghamshire Yeomanry to charge Abu Shusheh, the remainder of the Berkshire Yeomanry on their left would charge a spur to the north of the village. The Queen's Own Dorset Yeomanry would be the brigade reserve, protecting the brigades right flank. The artillery and machine-guns opened fire as the Berkshire Yeomanry moved into the open towards the village, but confronted by heavy machine-gun fire were forced to take cover in a defile. At the same time the Dorset Yeomanry moved around to the south to take that position from the rear, attracting the attention of the machine-gunners. Seeing this the Buckinghamshire Yeomanry came out of cover and charged the village. The Buckinghamshire Yeomanry and the two squadrons of Berkshire Yeomanry reached the village around the same time as the Dorset Yeomanry charged home on the machine-gun position. The position was secured but while clearing up the brigade was counter-attacked, which was broken up, suffering heavy losses, by the brigades artillery.Preston 1921, pp.90‚Äì91 By 09:00 the position was secured with over 400 Turkish dead, 360 prisoners and several machine-guns captured, British losses were thirty-seven dead and wounded. The Turkish survivors were pursued north by the 22nd MTD Brigade, who caught some prisoners, but an unknown number escaped into the surrounding hills.Preston 1921, p.92 British yeomanry section trench By now the corps had been operating for seventeen days, advanced without rest and had again outstripped it supply lines. The country they were now operating in was unsuitable for horses, but the army's transport vehicles were insufficient to bring the infantry divisions forward quickly.Preston 1921, pp.93‚Äì94 Allenby hoped to surrounded Jerusalem cutting the city off from any reinforcements, forcing its leaders to surrender without a fight. On 18 November the Yeomanry Division then at Ludd, was directed to advance as fast as possible, on a line Berfilya, Beit Ur el Tahta, to Bire. In the difficult terrain the 8th Mounted managed to reach Beit Ur el Tahta and the 22nd Brigade Shilta by that night. At the same time the 3rd LH and 4th LH Brigades from the AUS MTD DIV lead the 52nd and 75th Divisions up the main Jerusalem road to Kuryet el Enab, intending to turn north-east to the Nablus road.Preston 1921, p.101 The 5th MTD Brigade moved independently along the Wadi Surar, protecting their right flank. The 53rd Division left Hebron to the east of Jerusalem to cut the Jericho road. To ease the supply problem on 19 November, the 75th Division took over from the AUS MTD DIV, which withdrew to El Mejdel.Preston 1921, p.102 The 8th MTD and 22nd MTD Brigades continued their advance to Beitunia and Ain Arik, but around midday were confronted by a large Turkish force. Unable to make any progress both brigades held firm waiting for the 6th MTD Brigade to catch up with them. The next day (20 November), the 6th MTD and 8th MTD Brigades tried to reach Beitunia but were again held by the Turkish force and had made no headway by nightfall. In a concentrated effort all three brigades tried to take Beitunia on 21 November. The 6th MTD and 8th MTD Brigades in a direct assault from the west, while the 22nd MTD Brigade tried from further north to get around the right flank. The Turkish defenders had been reinforced, and outnumbered the yeomanry by three to one, and the attack failed.Preston 1921, p.105 Several more attempts to capture the position also failed and the division was finally forced back that afternoon by even more Turkish reinforcements. Their situation now untenable they were ordered to withdraw after dark back to Beit Ur el Foka.Preston 1921, p.106 Two days later on 23 November a lack of forage forced the division to send all their horses back to Ramleh. Away from the mountains the ANZ MTD DIV deployed in observation posts along the River Auja, and had located four crossing points across the river. A bridge at Khurbet Hadrah and three fords. One east of the bridge at Muannis, a second at Jerisheh and the third at the river mouth. On 24 November the division was ordered to establish one of more bridgeheads on the opposing bank. Chaytor decided to force a crossing at the river mouth with diversionary attacks at the other three crossings. The only force he had available was the New Zealand Brigade supported by two infantry battalions from the 54th (East Anglian) Division, that had just arrived at the front.Preston 1921, p.108 The infantry made the diversionary attacks while the New Zealanders successfully crossed at the river mouth defeating the small guard force. They then turned and charged upriver clearing the Turkish defences. One of the infantry battalions crossed the river forming two bridgeheads at Muannis and at the Khurbet Hadrah bridge. Two New Zealand squadrons were pushed into the high ground to the north as a covering force while a third guarded the crossing at the river mouth. That night the divisions engineers built a pontoon bridge across the river at Jerisheh, which was defended by the second infantry battalion. In daylight the Turks responded with an attack in force driving back the two covering squadrons and attacking the bridgehead at Khurbet Hadrah.Preston 1921, p.109 The New Zealand squadron holding the ford at the river mouth reinforced by a New Zealand regiment attacked the Turkish right flank, while the divisions third regiment moved to support the Khurbet Hadrah bridgehead. But by 08:30 the Turks had driven the bridgehead at Khurbet Hadrah back over the river, soon after followed by the other bridgeheads. The Turkish assault made no attempt to follow the retreating division back over the river.Preston 1921, pp. 110‚Äì114 By 27 November the YEO MTD DIV in the hills had been reduced to around 800 men, less than an infantry battalion. Unable to hold a strong defensive line the division commenced patrolling between a small number of defended posts. One post near Zeitun composed of three officers and sixty men was attacked that afternoon by a Turkish battalion, supported by artillery and machine-guns. By nightfall they had been reduced to twenty-eight men but still held out. Two understrength troops were sent to reinforce the position, which managed to hold on against several attacks but had to be withdrawn in the morning. The Turks occupied the village which gave them an observation point looking out over the surrounded countryside. The YEO MTD DIV had to withdraw to avoid being overlooked during which it was continuously attacked by the Turks and was in danger of being surrounded. To relieve the situation the reserve AUS MTD DIV Australian Division and 7th MTD Brigade were ordered to march through the night to their assistance. The 7th MTD Brigade arrived at Beit Ur el Tahta at 05:00 28 November just in time to break up an attack on the 22nd MTD Brigade. A brigade from the 52nd Division was sent to cover the yeomanry exposed left flank. Discovering that the Turks had broken through a gap in the yeomanry defences and cut their supply route, the infantry successfully attacked and drove them back but were unable to dislodge a larger force located at Saffa. The AUS MTD DIV arrived at Khurbet Deiran that morning after marching , the 4th LH Brigade relieved the 6th MTD at 17:00. The fighting continued on and off throughout the night, often at close range but the yeomanry now supported by the Australians held on. The next day both divisions were withdrawn and replaced by two infantry divisions,Preston 1921, p.115 Allenbys plan worked Jerusalem surrounded surrendered on 9 December.Preston 1921, p.121 Between 31 October and 9 December the corps had advanced , captured 9,500 prisoners and eighty artillery guns.Preston 1920, p.122 1918Amman January 1918 started with the British holding a line of trenches to the north of Jaffa and Jerusalem. The Desert Mounted Corps was withdrawn to Gaza to rest and refit. In February the ANZ MTD DIV and the 60th (London) Divisions were relocated to Bethlehem and on 18 February were given orders to move into the Jordan Valley and capture Jericho. The advance began the next morning and by nightfall the ANZAC Division had reached El Muntar, only south of the Jericho. Travelling by narrow tracks the 1st LH Brigade reached the Dead Sea at dusk. By dawn 21 February the New Zealand Brigade reached Nebi Musa without opposition, and the 1st LH Brigade entered a deserted Jericho at 08:00. The divisions patrols located the Turkish forces holding a bridgehead on the west bank of the River Jordan at El Ghoraniyeh, to the east of Jericho, and in a position along the Wadi el Auja to the north of the city.Preston 1920, pp.128‚Äì129 Men and camels of the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade crossing a pontoon bridge over the River Jordan. The campaign had settled down into static trench warfare in the west, however in the east Allenby decided to raid the Hedjaz Railway at Amman, to destroy the viaduct and railway tunnel. The ANZ MTD DIV, with the Camel Corps Brigade and 60th Division would carry out the raid.Preston 1920, pp.132‚Äì133 The plan was for 60th Division would force a river crossing, then the mounted force would head for Amman blow up the viaduct, tunnel and as much of the rail line as possible then withdraw, the infantry would remain on the east bank holding the bridgehead.Preston 1920, p.133 On 21 March by 08:00 the infantry had completed a pontoon bridge across the Jordan south of El Ghoraniyeh and by 12:00 had a brigade on the eastern bank. Attempts to cross at El Ghoraniyeh failed until 23 March when in the early morning a raft crossing was made and by 04:00 part of the New Zealand Brigade was across the river and heading north.Preston 1920, pp.135‚Äì136 Eight hours later they had seized the high ground above El Ghoraniyeh, capturing seventy prisoners and several machine-guns. By that night a second pontoon bridge had been constructed at Hajlah, and three more at Ghoraniyeh. The whole raiding force were across the river before daylight on 24 March. The 1st Light Horse Brigade moved to El Mandesi to the north, covering the 60th Divisions attack on El Haud and Shunet Nimrin. After heavy fighting El Haud was captured at 15:00, a New Zealand squadron supporting the infantry, then attacked the Turkish right who retired to Es Salt. The 2nd LH and Camel Corps Brigades advanced up the Wadi Kefrein reaching Rujm el Oshh by 15:30. The remainder of the New Zealand Brigade advanced up the Wadi Jofet to El Sir, but the infantry had only advanced by nightfall.Preston 1920, pp.136‚Äì137 Rain started that night turning what were marked as tracks on their maps into small rivers. Struggling against the weather the 2nd Brigade travelled all night and reached Ain el Hekr by 04:30, only having covered in twenty-fours hours. It was even worse for the Camel Corps Brigade following behind their last unit arrived at Ain el Hekr fifteen hours later.Preston 1920, p.137 The advance continued and although still raining the terrain was easier to cross and the leading troops of the two brigades linked up with the New Zealand Brigade at 05:30 26 March to the east of El Sir. The three brigades had been marching for three nights and two days and Chaytor decided to rest, for twenty-four hours, instead of pressing on and assaulting Amman. During the rest period a patrol from the 2nd LH Brigade attacked a Turkish position capturing 170 prisoners while another destroyed thirty German trucks and a car that were stuck in mud. That evening the 1st LH Brigade and 60th Division reached a deserted El Salt. The infantry were as exhausted as the mounted troop having fought for three days and nights to reach their present position and they also rested for twenty-four hours.Preston 1920, pp.138‚Äì139 Overnight Chaytor despatched two small patrols to blow up the rail line to the north and south of Amman. The group from the 2nd LH Brigade heading north come upon a large body of Turkish cavalry and were forced to turn back. The New Zealand party were more successful and destroyed a length or track south of Amman.Preston 1920, p.139 The ANZ MTD DIV resumed the raid early on 27 March, with an infantry brigade and two mountain artillery batteries moving in support from Es Salt. The Turks in the meantime had used the respite to bring up reinforcements if their own. Chaytor ordered the New Zealand Brigade to cross the Wadi Amman, south-west of Amman and secure the high ground overlooking the town from the south. A battalion from the Camel Corps Brigade would accompany them to destroy the rail line located there. The 2nd LH Brigade were ordered to move around to the rail line north of Amman and destroy the line there.Preston 1920, p.140 Once that was done the brigade would attack Amman from the north-west, the remainder of the Camel Corps Brigade would attack from the west, while the infantry would continue to advance in support from Es Salt. The mounted brigades set out at 09:00, struggling through the mud it was not until 15:00 that the New Zealanders reached their objective. Their camel battalion started their demolition work and engaged a Turkish train with their machine-guns forcing it to pull back.Preston 1920, pp.141‚Äì142 The 2nd LH Brigade by 11:00 had got within of their objective, when they were attacked by a large Turkish force with artillery support. The Camel Corps Brigade heading directly for Amann was engaged by several machine-guns and could make no progress and the New Zealand Brigade was also attacked by increasing numbers of Turkish troops. Chaytor ordered the three brigades to hold firm until the infantry could arrive and support them. That night a small group from the 2nd LH Brigade did manage to infiltrate the Turkish lines and destroyed a rail bridge near Khurbet el Raseife.Preston 1920, p.142 The Hong Kong and Singapore Mountain Artillery Battery part of the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade Daylight brought down Turkish artillery on the divisions positions, around noon two infantry battalions caught up with the division. Chaytor decided on an immediate attack, with the infantry positioned between the 2nd LH and Camel Corps Brigades.Preston 1920, p.144 The assault started at 14:00 and got to within of the Turkish lines when the 2nd LH Brigade were counter-attacked. The whole British attack faltered and they withdrew a short distance into a night time defensive position. The remainder of the infantry brigade and two mountain artillery batteries arrived at midday the next day. Turkish reinforcements had also arrived during the day and continued their attack against the 2nd LH Brigades position. To their rear at Es Salt the 1st LH Brigade came under attack from the 3rd Turkish Cavalry Division and two infantry brigades.Preston 1920, p.146 Chaytor planned a new attack that night, the New Zealand Brigade were tasked to capture a large hill south-east of Amman. The Camel Corps and infantry would attack the town while the 2nd Brigade was to carry out diversionary operations in the north. The assault started at 02:00 the New Zealanders reached the top of the hill without the Turks firing a shot. But were then engaged by heavy machine-gun fire, followed by an infantry counter-attack at dawn.Preston 1920, p.147 The attack by the Camel Corps and infantry brigade was initially successful capturing the first line of trenches with 200 prisoners. By 09:00 the Camel Corps Brigade were about from the main Turkish position when it came under heavy machine-gun fire and an infantry counter-attack was launched against the infantry brigade. The counter-attack was defeated but the British infantry were under an almost constant threat from the Turks and were just able to hold where they were. More Turkish reinforcements arrived at 10:00 and attacked the New Zealanders, which was defeated with support from the Somerset Battery R.H.A which had just arrived after a thirty-hour march. Later in the morning the New Zealanders and Camel Brigade both fought off another direct attack on their positions.Preston 1920, p.148 That afternoon the infantry tried once again to reach Amman, but machine-gun fire from both flanks forced them to withdraw. In the face of ever increasing Turkish reinforcement Chaytor decided they had no hope of taking Amman. The British were now being attacked at Es Salt and at Amman, with no reserves available Major-General John Shea of 60th Division but in overall command of the raiding force decided to call off the operation. That night the ANZ MTD DIV, Camel Corps Brigade and attached infantry pulled back reaching Ain el Sira the next evening. On 31 March the Turkish attacks at Es Salt continued all day until 23:00 when having made no progress they finally broke off the engagement.Preston 1920, pp.149‚Äì150 The last of the British troops crossed to the west bank of the Jordan late on 2 April. In the twelve days fighting 1,600 men had been killed, wounded or were reported missing.Preston 1920, p.151 Turkish losses were 1,00 taken prisoner, the stores and ammunition at El Salt and an estimated 1,700 dead and wounded. The infantry had managed to hold a bridgehead at Ghoraniyeh and a second bridge was built further north at the mouth of the river Auja.Preston 1920, p.153 Es Salt During April the Turkish forces on the east bank had increased to around 8,000 men based on Shunet Nimrin.Preston 1920, p.154 Allenby proposed a raid in connection with their Arab allies to cut off and destroy them. The raids timing come during the corps reorganisation and the only forces available were the ANZ MTD and AUS MTD DIVs, two infantry brigades from 60th Division, and the Imperial Service Cavalry and Infantry Brigades.Preston 1920, p.155 The raid commenced 29 April the AUS MTD DIV reinforced with the 1st LH and 2nd LH Brigade crossed the Jordan and moved into the mountains. The 5th MTD and 2nd LH Brigades made for El Haud, the 3rd LH Brigade headed towards El Salt, the 4th LH and the reserve 1st LH Brigade headed for the Turkish controlled bridge at Jisr el Damieh. Australian Light Horse snipers The 4th LH Brigade reached the Jisr el Damieh bridge at 06:00, the leading 11th Light Horse Regiment attempted to seize the bridge but the Turkish defenders were well dug in and the attempt failed. A second brigade attempt was also defeated by the strength of the Turkish defenders. Instead the brigade, with the divisions three R.H.A batteries, took up a defensive position covering the track from Jisr el Damieh to El Salt. That afternoon the batteries were used to disperse a large column of Turkish troops that were marching towards them.Preston 1920, p.157‚Äì158 The infantry attacked the Turks at Shunet Nimrin, but could only occupy the forward positions. The large numbers of defenders preventing any further progress. At 15:00 the corps ordered the reserve 1st LH Brigade to follow the main force towards El Salt. Where the 3rd LH Brigade were already approaching the town but were engaged by a Turkish position to the north-west. A bayonet charge by the 9th and 10th Light Horse Regiments captured the position. The 8th Light Horse Regiment then galloped into the town which was full of Turkish soldiers. By 19:00 the town was secured with 300 prisoners, several machine-guns and the Fourth Army headquarters captured. The AUS MTD DIV, 1st LH, 2nd LH Brigades and two artillery batteries travelling through the night reached Es Salt early on 1 May.Preston 1920, p.158‚Äì159 The force deployed brigades to the east, north, and west while the 5th MTD Brigade moved on Shunet Nimrin.Preston 1920, p.160 At 07:30 around 4,000 Turkish soldier appeared on the east bank of the Jordan and advanced on the 4th LH Brigade position from the east. At the same time another 1,000 infantry and 500 cavalry approached from the west. The three artillery batteries with the brigade opened fire on the approaching Turkish troops and Turkish artillery located on the west bank returned their fire. Around 10:00 they managed to overwhelm a small outpost the survivors from the two squadrons were pulling back to the main position when an all out Turkish assault on the brigade started. Outnumbered by about five to one the brigades right flank was turned. Grant in command of the brigade ordered an immediate withdrawal south. Some Turkish troops had got behind the brigade and were blocking the route south. Now fighting at close quarters the brigade was in danger of being overrun. The New Zealand Brigade away dispatched two of its regiments to assist the 4th LH Brigade.Preston 1920, p.161‚Äì162 On the brigade right flank the 4th Light Horse Regiment was covering the retreat of the three artillery batteries. 'A' Battery H.A.C. was on the right, the Nottinghamshire Battery R.H.A. in the centre and 'B' Battery H.A.C. in the south. The two northern batteries 'A' and the Notts attempted to withdraw by sections covering each other firing over open sights. Gradually the artillerymen and horses were shot down and the guns backed into a position with no exit. Forced to make a stand as the Turks had advanced to within on three sides, the batteries ammunition ran out. The last surviving gunners and light-horsemen abandoned the guns and escaped by climbing into the hills. 'B' Battery H.A.C., less one gun that overturned, did escape being encircled and repositioned further south to cover the brigade withdrawal.Preston 1920, p.162‚Äì163 By midday the brigade had found a new defensive position in a small wadi. Chaytor now arrived to find out for himself what the situation was and ordered the brigade to withdraw further, to a new position north of the Umm el Shert track. During which the two New Zealand regiments arrived and a new defence line was established from the Jordan to the foothills. The Turks attacked the new defence line three times during the day but were beaten back suffering heavy losses.Preston 1920, p.164 Elsewhere at dawn the 5th MTD Brigade had left Es Salt for El Howeij arriving at 13:00 but were unable to dislodge the large Turkish force guarding the road bridge into the town. To assist them the 1st LH Brigade were ordered to attack El Haud in the west. By the end of the day the Turkish defenders were still holding off both brigades. That night the 2nd LH Brigade was also sent to assist the 5th MTD and both were ordered to support 60th Divisions dawn attack on Shunet Nimrin and El Haud on 2 May. With the 4th LH Brigades position in danger the 1st LH Brigade were ordered to support them by defending the track from Umm el Shert. The whole British force was now in danger from the Turkish 3rd Cavalry Division and part of an infantry division moving towards El Salt from the north-west and another detachment heading towards Amman from the east.Preston 1920, p.166 The attack on Shunet Nimrin by 60th Division began at dawn but they made little progress confronted by a strong Turkish force. At 08:00 5th Brigade attacked their right flank at El Howeij bridge, by 10:30 2nd LH Brigade were still en route to their objective El Hand. At the same time 3rd LH Brigade at Es Salt was attacked by a large Turkish Force. Under heavy pressure their lines were forced back a little and a regiment from the 1st LH Brigade was sent to their aid. This reinforcement made little difference and another 1st Brigade regiment was sent to support them an hour later. The fortunate arrival of a supply column with 100,000 rounds of small-arm ammunition and 300 artillery rounds assisted the 3rd LH Brigade defence. Their machine-guns which until then had been conserving ammunition were able to break up the Turkish assault.Preston 1920, pp.166‚Äì167 New Zealand Mounted Rifles crossing the Jordan The British advance was floundering the 2nd LH and 5th MTD Brigade commanders informed the divisional commander Major-General Hodgson that they could not reach their objectives by nightfall. He ordered them to continue as good as possible to assist the infantry attacking Shunet Nimrin.

Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. Hittite: URU·∏™a-at-tu-≈°a, Hattic: Hattush) was the capital of the Hittite Empire in the late Bronze Age. Its ruins lie near modern Boƒüazkale, Turkey, within the great loop of the Kƒ±zƒ±lƒ±rmak River (Hittite: Marashantiya; Greek: Halys). Hattusa was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1986.  Surroundings  Sphinx Gate entrance of the city. The landscape surrounding the city included rich agricultural fields and hill lands for pasture as well as woods. Smaller woods are still found outside the city, but in ancient times, they were far more widespread. This meant the inhabitants had an excellent supply of timber when building their houses and other structures. The fields provided the people with a subsistence crop of wheat, barley and lentils. Flax was also harvested, but their primary source for clothing was sheep wool. They also hunted deer in the forest, but this was probably only a luxury reserved for the nobility. Domestic animals provided meat. There were several other settlements in the vicinity, such as the rock shrine at Yazƒ±lƒ±kaya and the town at Alacah√∂y√ºk. Since the rivers in the area are unsuitable for major ships, all transport to and from Hattusa had to go by land.  Early history  Hattusa Rampart. Before 2000 BC, the apparently indigenous Hattian people established a settlement on sites that had been occupied even earlier and referred to the site as Hattush. The Hattians built their initial settlement on the high ridge of B√ºy√ºkkale.The Excavations at Hattusha: \\"A Brief History\\" The earliest traces of settlement on the site are from the sixth millennium BC. In the 19th and 18th centuries BC, merchants from Assur in Assyria established a trading post there, setting up in their own separate quarter of the city. The center of their trade network was located in Kanesh (Ne≈°a) (modern K√ºltepe). Business dealings required record- keeping: the trade network from Assur introduced writing to Hattusa, in the form of cuneiform. A carbonized layer apparent in excavations attests to the burning and ruin of the city of Hattusa around 1700 BC. The responsible party appears to have been King Anitta from Kussara, who took credit for the act and erected an inscribed curse for good measure:  The Hittite imperial city  Map of the Hittite Empire in 14th century BC Hattusa city walls reconstructed, Hattusa, Turkey. Only a generation later, a Hittite-speaking king chose the site as his residence and capital. The Hittite language had been gaining speakers at the expense of Hattic for some time. The Hattic Hattush now became the Hittite Hattusa, and the king took the name of Hattusili, the \\"one from Hattusa\\". Hattusili marked the beginning of a non-Hattic-speaking \\"Hittite\\" state and of a royal line of Hittite Great Kings, 27 of whom are now known by name. After the Kaskians arrived to the kingdom's north, they twice attacked the city to the point where the kings had to move the royal seat to another city. Under Tudhaliya I, the Hittites moved north to Sapinuwa, returning later. Under Muwatalli II, they moved south to Tarhuntassa but assigned Hattusili III as governor over Hattusa. Mursili III returned the seat to Hattusa, where the kings remained until the end of the Hittite kingdom in the 12th century BC. Reliefs and Hieroglyphs from Chamber 2 at Hattusa built and decorated by Suppiluliuma II, the last king of the Hittites. At its peak, the city covered 1.8 km¬≤ and comprised an inner and outer portion, both surrounded by a massive and still visible course of walls erected during the reign of Suppiluliuma I (circa 1344‚Äì1322 BC (short chronology)). The inner city covered an area of some 0.8 km¬≤ and was occupied by a citadel with large administrative buildings and temples. The royal residence, or acropolis, was built on a high ridge now known as B√ºy√ºkkale (Great Fortress).Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: B√ºy√ºkkale The city displayed over 6 km of walls, with inner and outer skins around 3 m of thick and 2 m of space between them, adding 8 m of the total thickness.Lewis, Leo Rich; Tenney, Charles R. (2010). The Compendium of Weapons, Armor & Castles. Nabu Press. p. 142. . The Great Temple in the inner city To the south lay an outer city of about 1 km2, with elaborate gateways decorated with reliefs showing warriors, lions, and sphinxes. Four temples were located here, each set around a porticoed courtyard, together with secular buildings and residential structures. Outside the walls are cemeteries, most of which contain cremation burials. Modern estimates put the population of the city between 40,000 and 50,000 at the peak; in the early period, the inner city housed a third of that number. The dwelling houses that were built with timber and mud bricks have vanished from the site, leaving only the stone-built walls of temples and palaces. The city was destroyed, together with the Hittite state itself, around 1200 BC, as part of the Bronze Age collapse. Excavations suggest that Hattusa was gradually abandoned over a period of several decades as the Hittite empire disintegrated. The site was subsequently abandoned until 800 BC, when a modest Phrygian settlement appeared in the area.

In 1833, the French archaeologist Charles Texier (1802‚Äì1871) was sent on an exploratory mission to Turkey, where in 1834 he discovered ruins of the ancient Hittite capital of Hattusa.See: * * Available at: University of Heidelberg, Germany * Ernest Chantre opened some trial trenches at the village then called Boƒüazk√∂y, in 1893‚Äì94.\\"The Excavations at Hattusha - a project of the German Institute of Archaeology\\": Discovery Since 1906, the German Oriental Society has been excavating at Hattusa (with breaks during the two World Wars and the Depression, 1913‚Äì31 and 1940‚Äì51). Archaeological work is still carried out by the German Archaeological Institute (Deutsches Arch√§ologisches Institut). Hugo Winckler and Theodore Makridi Bey conducted the first excavations in 1906, 1907, and 1911‚Äì13, which were resumed in 1931 under Kurt Bittel, followed by Peter Neve (site director 1963, general director 1978‚Äì94).J√ºrgen Seeher, \\"Forty Years in the Capital of the Hittites: Peter Neve Retires from His Position as Director of the ·∏™attu≈°a- Boƒüazk√∂y Excavations\\" The Biblical Archaeologist 58.2, \\"Anatolian Archaeology: A Tribute to Peter Neve\\" (June 1995), pp. 63-67. Cuneiform royal archives One of the most important discoveries at the site has been the cuneiform royal archives of clay tablets, known as the Bogazk√∂y Archive, consisting of official correspondence and contracts, as well as legal codes, procedures for cult ceremony, oracular prophecies and literature of the ancient Near East. One particularly important tablet, currently on display at the Istanbul Archaeology Museum, details the terms of a peace settlement reached years after the Battle of Kadesh between the Hittites and the Egyptians under Ramesses II, in 1259 or 1258 BC. A copy is on display in the United Nations in New York City as an example of the earliest known international peace treaties. Although the 30,000 or so clay tablets recovered from Hattusa form the main corpus of Hittite literature, archives have since appeared at other centers in Anatolia, such as Tabigga (Ma≈üat H√∂y√ºk) and Sapinuwa (Ortak√∂y). They are now divided between the archaeological museums of Ankara and Istanbul. Sphinxes A pair of sphinxes found at the southern gate in Hattusa were taken for restoration to Germany in 1917. The better- preserved was returned to Turkey in 1924 and placed on display in the Istanbul Archaeology Museum, but the other remained in Germany where it was on display at the Pergamon Museum from 1934, despite numerous requests for its return. In 2011, threats by Turkish Ministry of Culture to impose restrictions on German archaeologists working in Turkey finally persuaded Germany to return the sphinx, and it was moved to the Boƒüazk√∂y Museum outside the Hattusa ruins, along with the Istanbul sphinx ‚Äì reuniting the pair near their original location.

The Desert Column of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) attacked an entrenched Ottoman Army garrison at El Magruntein to the south of Rafah, close to the frontier between the Sultanate of Egypt and the Ottoman Empire, to the north and east of Sheikh Zowaiid. The attack marked the beginning of fighting in the Ottoman territory of Palestine. After the British Empire victories at the Battle of Romani in August 1916 and the Battle of Magdhaba in December, the Ottoman Army had been forced back to the southern edge of Palestine as the EEF pushed eastwards supported by extended lines of communication. This advance depended on the construction of a railway and water pipeline. With the railway reaching El Arish on 4 January 1917, an attack on Rafa by the newly formed Desert Column became possible. During the day-long assault, the Ottoman garrison defended El Magruntein's series of fortified redoubts and trenches on rising ground surrounded by flat grassland. They were eventually encircled by Australian Light Horsemen, New Zealand mounted riflemen, mounted Yeomanry, cameliers and armoured cars. In the late afternoon, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade captured the central redoubt and the remaining defences were occupied shortly afterwards. Background Laying the railway across the Sinai Following their victory at the Battle of Romani on 4 August 1916, the ANZAC Mounted Division with the 5th Mounted Brigade attached and infantry in support, went onto the offensive. Their advance depended on the construction of a railway and water pipeline. With the railhead about away, on 23 December 1916 the ANZAC Mounted Division, less the 2nd Light Horse Brigade but with the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade attached, occupied El Arish during day-long fighting at the Battle of Magdhaba.Downes 1938, p. 593Carver 2003, p. 194Bruce 2002 p. 84 Meanwhile, the 52nd (Lowland) Division, having marched from Romani, established a garrison at El Arish and began to fortify the town on the Mediterranean Sea, from the railhead. El Arish was by road from the nearest British base at Kantara on the Suez Canal, initially making resupply difficult. The arrival of the Royal Navy on 22 December, quickly followed by the first stores on 24 December, meant that during the next fortnight the important Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) forward base grew quickly as 1,500 tons of supplies arrived by ship. Supplies of all kinds were unloaded by the Egyptian Labour Corps and distributed by the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps. Vitally important, the supply activities at El Arish were protected by the infantry garrison and ground-based artillery, supported by the navy. On 4 January 1917 the first construction train arrived at El Arish, but it was some time before the railway, with its vast capacity to support the development of infrastructure and the supply of large garrisons, was fully developed.Gullett 1941, p. 229Falls 1930 Vol. 1 pp. 263, 271 The town of Hafir el Aujah, the Ottoman Army's principal desert base General Sir Archibald Murray, the commander of the EEF, was keen to complete the advance across the north of the Sinai, to put pressure on the southern Ottoman Army. Believing an attack would compel Ottoman forces to abandon their desert bases and outposts on the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula, he ordered an advance from El Arish to Rafa, a distance of , to begin as soon as possible.Cutlack 1941, pp. 49‚Äì51Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 271 Prelude The Sinai and the Suez Canal zone in 1917. Note that the railway had reached Bir el Mazar. On 28 December, Major General Harry Chauvel, commander of the ANZAC Mounted Division, ordered the 1st Light Horse Brigade to reconnoitre Bir el Burj, along the road from El Arish towards Rafa. The road was found to be suitable for cars and artillery, and a further reconnaissance by the same brigade two days later to Sheikh Zowaiid, from El Arish, reported rolling stretches of pasture, crops and poppies. A small advance guard moved further, to within sight of the main Ottoman defences at El Magruntein, reporting \\"great activity\\" in the area.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 pp. 262‚Äì3 The weather cleared on 5 January, allowing a patrol from No. 1 Squadron, Australian Flying Corps (AFC), to observe 2,000 to 3,000 Ottoman soldiers digging defences south of Rafa in the area of El Magruntein. Two days later, British air patrols found Ottoman garrisons in strength at El Kossaima and Hafir el Auja in central northern Sinai, which could threaten the right flank of the advancing EEF or reinforce Rafa. While the British air patrols were absent on 7 January, German airmen took advantage of the growing concentration of EEF formations and supply dumps, bombing El Arish during the morning and evening. The next day the patrols from No. 1 Squadron AFC were in the air all day, covering preparations for the attack on Rafa. Lieutenant General Philip Chetwode, commanding the Desert Column, rode out of El Arish at 16:00 on 8 January towards Rafa where a 2,000-strong Ottoman garrison was based. Chetwode's mounted force was the same as that Chauvel had commanded during the Battle of Magdhaba in December, with the addition of the 5th Mounted Brigade (which had been garrisoning El Arish) and the 7th Light Car Patrol consisting of four gun cars and three stores cars.Gullett 1941, p. 230 Risking an aerial attack during daylight hours, the force began the journey before sunset to ensure there was enough time for the force to reach El Magruntein. For the first few miles they trekked over heavy sand dunes, which were difficult to negotiate for the doubled teams of horses pulling the guns and ammunition wagons. Once the great shallow trough, worn down by traffic since ancient times, along the Old Road or Pilgrims' Way appeared, the guns and ammunition wagons travelled on the firm middle way while the mounted units rode on either side. The vanguard of the column reached Sheikh Zowaiid at about 22:00; the Desert Column bivouacked near the crossroads to the west of the village. Here the first grass the horses had seen since leaving Australia was found on the edge of the fertile maritime plain, north of El Arish.Powles 1922, p. 68 The plan for the attack at Rafa the next morning, 9 January, was a repetition of Chauvel's successful encirclement attack at Magdhaba. The regiments and motor cars would surround the Ottoman garrison position, gallop up under fire, then dismount to attack the defenders in their treble system of trenches and field- works around the earthwork redoubts on the knoll. Attack force The mounted units of the Desert Column involved in the attack under Chetwode's command were: * ANZAC Mounted Division, commanded by Chauvel, composed of the 1st and 3rd Light Horse Brigades, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, and the Inverness-shire, Leicestershire and Somerset Royal Horse Artillery Territorial batteries; * 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions Imperial Camel Corps Brigade with the Hong Kong and Singapore Mountain Battery; * 5th Mounted Brigade with B Battery, Honourable Artillery Company (HAC) (18-pounders); * 7th Light Car Patrol consisting of six Ford Light Armoured Motorcars (LAM) equipped with machine-guns.Gullett 1941, pp. 230‚Äì2Powles 1922, p. 65Coulthard- Clark 1998, p. 123 No. 1 Squadron AFC, which had been based at Mustabig during the El Arish and Magdhaba operations, moved forward west of El Arish to support the attack.Cutlack 1941 p. 50 Ottoman defenders Rafa was defended by the Ottoman 31st Infantry Regiment (3rd Division) supported by one mountain gun battery.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 377 It had been reported by British aerial reconnaissance that this force was between 2,000 and 3,000 strong. They were strongly entrenched in four main positions on the high ground about Hill 255, known as El Magruntein. The central redoubt, which rose about to dominate the surrounding grassland, was supported by three systems of redoubts identified by the British Empire forces as A, B and C. These redoubts were linked and supported by trenches on the slopes spreading out to the south- east, south and south-west. The strong, well-prepared and well-sited redoubts and trench systems provided all-round defence with a clear view of a battlefield devoid of cover for some . The only weakness was to the rear of the position in the north-east.Bruce 2002, pp. 85 & 86Gullett 1941, pp. 230, 234Powles 1922, pp. 64‚Äì5 Battle The Desert Column began the final approach to attack Rafa on 9 January 1917 without any reserve ammunition for the artillery, rifles or machine-guns. The column's commander, Chetwode, had ordered all wheeled vehicles, excepting the guns, to remain at Sheikh Zowaiid. His brigadiers complied with the order, but only under protest.Powles 1922, pp. 66‚Äì9 It had been the intention of Desert Column Headquarters that the reserve ammunition would be sent onward after daylight, but during the battle the system broke down and this did not occur, resulting in a critical failure of the ammunition supply. In many cases, supplies were rushed forward, but failed to reach the units requiring them on the firing line.Powles 1922, pp. 77‚Äì8 Boundary pillars on the Egyptian Sinai-Ottoman Palestine frontier At 01:00 the 1st Light Horse and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigades led the Desert Column. Half a mile (0.80 km) from Sheikh Zowaiid, they encountered a hostile Bedouin camel patrol which was captured. At 06:15 the Auckland Mounted Rifle Regiment (New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade) was first to reach the boundary pillars on the Egyptian and Ottoman frontier, moving from the African continent onto Asia. These two brigades rode to a position from which to attack the Rafa defences, from the south, east and north. They were followed at 02:30 by the remainder of the ANZAC Mounted Division, part of the 5th Mounted Brigade, the Imperial Camel Brigade, and six Ford motor cars of the 7th Light Car Patrol. Two troops of the Queen's Own Worcestershire Hussars (5th Mounted Brigade) remained at Sheikh Zowaiid to protect the ammunition column, while a squadron followed the caravan road towards Rafa.Gullett 1941, pp. 231‚Äì232Falls 1930 Vol. 1 pp. 263‚Äì4 By 06:45 the ANZAC Mounted Division headquarters was established west of Karm Ibn Musleh on the frontier to the south of Rafa and El Magruntein. The 1st and 3rd Light Horse Brigades and the artillery took up positions to the south to guard against the Ottoman garrison retreating to the south-east, with the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade located three-quarters of a mile (1.21 km) to the west. The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade was about to the north with the 5th Mounted Brigade forming the Desert Column's reserve.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 264 By 07:00 a patrol of the Wellington Mounted Rifles had cut the telegraph line running east from Rafa towards Shellal and Gaza, isolating the Rafa garrison, Chauvel had reconnoitred the El Magruntein defences and the British Empire horse artillery batteries had begun firing on the redoubts at El Magruntein.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 265Gullett 1941, pp. 233‚Äì234 Just after 08:00 the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade circled northwards, moving into position for their attacks on the C4 and C5 groups of redoubts and trenches, while the 1st Light Horse Brigade moved into position to attack the C3, C2 and C1 groups. After these objectives were captured, the two brigades were to attack the central redoubt. Meanwhile, three battalions of the Imperial Camel Brigade were ordered to attack the D group of fortifications. The 3rd Light Horse Brigade formed the ANZAC Mounted Division's reserve.Powles 1922, p. 71 and map pp. 80‚Äì1 In preparation for the attack, the divisional artillery had pre-selected targets and at 09:30 the Leicestershire, Inverness-shire and Somerset Batteries of the Royal Horse Artillery and B Battery, Honourable Artillery Company began a 30-minute preparatory barrage. Under cover of this, the attacking troops began their advance, and by 09:45 they had approached to within of the Ottoman entrenchments. Attack begins Powles' map showing the attacks on Rafa and El Magruntein As the 1st Light Horse Brigade advanced from the direction of El Gubba, westward towards El Magruntein and the \\"C\\" group of redoubts, they encountered heavy machine-gun and shrapnel fire from German and Ottoman guns. To the south, the Imperial Camel Brigade advanced towards the B4 redoubt, and at 10:30 the 5th Mounted Brigade was ordered \\"to demonstrate against the works further west.\\" When they arrived at a plateau from El Magruntein, the Warwickshire Yeomanry on the right was ordered to attack the B1 and B2 redoubts, while the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars were \\"sent to the left along the edge of the sand-dunes\\" to attack the right of the A1 redoubt, the most westerly of the defences. The troops dismounted to begin their attack from their objectives, but were immediately engaged by heavy machine-gun fire and shrapnel from two guns. By 10:00 the attack from the north, led by the Auckland Mounted Rifles and supported by two machine-guns, with the Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment on their right, had ridden into Rafa as they circled around El Magruntein. Here, they quickly captured the village along with six German and two Ottoman officers, 16 other ranks and 21 Bedouins. Two troops were sent to watch for the approach of Ottoman reinforcements; one troop to the north towards Khan Yunis and one to the east towards Shellal.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 266Powles 1922 map pp. 80‚Äì1Gullett 1941, p. 234 With the Ottoman garrison defending El Magruntein cut off from the north and east by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, orders were issued for all Desert Column reserves to be committed and the attack \\"pressed home.\\" By 11:00 the attacking force was deployed from right to left: the Canterbury and Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiments, two squadrons of the 1st Light Horse Regiment, one squadron of the 2nd Light Horse Regiment, the 3rd Light Horse Regiment (1st Light Horse Brigade), the 10th Light Horse Regiment (3rd Light Horse Brigade), the 1st Battalion Imperial Camel Corps Brigade and the \\"Warwick and Gloucester Yeomanry.\\" They were supported by the Inverness-shire Battery covering the New Zealanders, the Leicestershire and Somerset Batteries covering the Australians and the Hong Kong Battery covering the Camel Corps battalion, while the HAC battery shelled the \\"C\\" group of redoubts from a distance of three-quarters of a mile (1.21 km).Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 267 Brigadier General Edward Chaytor, commanding the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, moved his headquarters up to the boundary post south-east of Rafa, immediately behind the Auckland Mounted Rifles. Half an hour later, the attack was seen to be steadily progressing all along the line.Powles 1922, pp. 71‚Äì2 By 12:15 the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment had come up to the front line, between the Canterburys on the right, and the Aucklanders on the left, within of El Magruntein, while the 2nd Battalion of the Camel Brigade advanced to extend the line held by their 1st Battalion. Shortly afterwards, the Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment linked up with the left of the 5th Mounted Brigade, completing the cordon around the Ottoman Army entrenchments. To the left of the 5th Mounted Brigade, the 7th Light Car Patrol reached the Rafa road, where they found cover from which to direct fire on to the A1 and A2 redoubts away. Meanwhile, the batteries had pushed forward about from their previous positions and \\"B\\" Battery HAC stopped firing on the \\"C\\" group of redoubts. Switching targets to the A1 and A2 redoubts, it recommenced firing at a range of in support of the 5th Mounted Brigade. Ammunition shortages The main Ottoman defensive position and trenches at Rafa Despite the initial assault, the Ottoman defenders continued to hold very strong defensive positions, with each redoubt ideally placed to provide supporting fire for others. In most places the dismounted attackers were badly exposed to this fire.While fighting on foot, one quarter of the light horsemen, riflemen and yeomanry were holding the horses; a brigade then became equivalent in rifle strength to an infantry battalion. [Preston 1921 p.168] A constant stream of fire was maintained on the Ottoman parapets to suppress the defenders and prevent them from taking aim while the attack continued. Little by little the cordon drew tighter under intense fire over the bare, gently-sloping grasslands. However, between about 12:15 and 14:15 progress slowed. By early to mid-afternoon supplies of ammunition began to run low. Although Chauvel called for further effort, the mistake of leaving the ammunition vehicles behind proved costly, as the attack wavered.Bruce 2002, pp. 86‚Äì7Hill 1978, p. 93 The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade ran out of ammunition for four of its machine-guns and the Inverness- shire Battery ran out of shells and had to withdraw.Gullett 1941, pp. 235, 237‚Äì238Powles 1922, pp. 74‚Äì5Major Alexander Wilkie, Quartermaster of the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment, remained at Sheikh Zowaiid with the supply convoys. But during the early hours of the battle, he was so concerned by the quantity of .303 small arms ammunition (SAA) ‚Äì used by both rifles and machine-guns ‚Äì his regiment had gone into battle with, that he went forward to Rafa. Upon arrival, he heard that his regiment was calling for ammunition. Seizing a cable wagon, he emptied out the signal gear and filled it with boxes of ammunition, and galloped across to the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade in time for the general assault on the redoubt, materially assisting in the final success. [Powles 1922, pp. 77‚Äì8] At 14:30 Chauvel ordered a fresh effort against the C group of redoubts to begin at 15:30, while a sustained artillery barrage was to continue on these redoubts until then. However, 15 minutes later, an Ottoman machine-gun officer and three German soldiers, captured by the troop of the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment keeping watch towards Shellal, stated that their 160th Regiment had left Shellal on the Wadi Ghuzzeh when the attack had begun, to reinforce the Rafa garrison. Shellal was between or about three and a half hours away. This was confirmed when two battalions were seen advancing in artillery formation, over the ridges west of Shellal towards Rafa. An additional 500 soldiers were seen approaching Rafa from the direction of Khan Yunus by the same mounted rifle regiment's northern guard.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 268 Final assaults The general assault, launched at 15:30, was supported by all available guns. It made slow progress against the stubborn Ottoman defenders, who were supported by bombing from German planes, while the advance guard of Ottoman reinforcements, from Khan Yunus in the north and Shellal in the east, were attacking the two troops of the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment. Four guns of the Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment, on the right flank, were moved to a trench before being moved forward to the sunken road. From there they maintained effective overhead covering fire, until the assaulting troops were within a few yards of the trenches. These guns were also well-positioned to provide cover if pressure by the Ottoman reinforcements from Khan Yunus and Shellal proved too strong for the two troops of Wellingtons, or if the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade was forced to retire to the coast. After steady, methodical and persistent work, by 16:00 a cloud of smoke hung over the central redoubt from rifle and machine-gun fire. The covering fire was so effective that the Ottoman defenders had extreme difficulty aiming and firing their rifles and machine- guns. It then became possible for the attacking forces to cover the last of smooth grassy slope in two rushes.Powles 1922, pp. 75‚Äì6 At about 16:30, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade launched its final assault on the central redoubt from the north-west, the north and the north-east. Lacking artillery support, they made determined use of machine-guns on the firing line, crossing fire to get better targets, and co-operating with the machine-guns of the 1st Light Horse Brigade to cover the advance to within of the main Ottoman position. They captured the central redoubt in a final bayonet charge, at the run, many of the soldiers firing as they went. From their captured position in the dominating central redoubt, they were able to enfilade other redoubts still held by Ottoman defenders. With the New Zealanders holding the dominant redoubt, the 1st and the 3rd Light Horse Brigades were able to advance and capture the remaining redoubts on their fronts. As the 3rd Battalion of the Imperial Camel Brigade approached the B group of trenches, a white flag appeared, and the B2 and the central work of B group were occupied by 16:50. They captured five officers and 214 other ranks while the Warwickshire Yeomanry captured the B1 redoubt and another 101 prisoners.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 pp. 268‚Äì9 These successful attacks were supported by aircraft, which bombed the redoubts and trenches. The aircraft had recently been fitted with wirelesses, and during the afternoon reported the progress of the battle to the Desert Column's headquarters, assisting in command and control.Cutlack 1941 pp. 49‚Äì51Falls 1930 Vol. p. 254 The New Zealanders remained close to the main redoubt system while prisoners were collected and sent to Sheikh Zowaiid and the four captured guns taken away.Hill 1978, pp. 93‚Äì4Powles 1922, pp. 76‚Äì7 Chetwode reported to the commander of Eastern Force, Lieutenant General Charles Macpherson Dobell, that the work of all troops engaged had been excellent, and the part played by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade had been outstanding.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 270 Casualties Ottoman prisoners on the road to El Arish from Rafa During the fighting the Desert Column suffered three times the losses previously endured at Magdhaba. The 487 casualties included 124 New Zealanders: 71 killed, 415 wounded and one missing.Bruce 2002, p. 87Downes 1938, pp. 596‚Äì7Pugsley 2004, pp. 135‚Äì6 Against this, the mainly Ottoman prisoners, which included some German machine- gunners, totalled between 1,472 and 1,635, with 162 of them wounded.Carver 2003, p.195Powles 1922, pp. 76‚Äì7, 79 About 200 Ottoman soldiers were killed on the battlefield.Dennis et al. 2008, p. 405 Aftermath British Empire ambulance wagons returning to Sheikh Zowaiid from Rafa Following the battle, a strong rearguard position manned by two light horse regiments, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Leslie Cecil Maygar, was established. Meanwhile, the bulk of the Desert Column returned to Sheikh Zowaiid for water and rations, arriving about midnight.Powles 1922, p. 76Gullett 1941, p. 242 The two light horse regiments that had remained at Rafa stood guard, while the battlefield was cleared by the light horse field ambulances, whose stretcher bearers worked into the night. The 3rd Light Horse Field Ambulance, covered by the 8th Light Horse Regiment (3rd Light Horse Brigade), remained on the battlefield, as all available ambulance carts and empty wagons were sent up from Sheikh Zowaiid to help transport the wounded to hospital.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 269 The ANZAC Mounted Division's field ambulance units had been reorganised before the battle, and were equipped with 10 pairs of litters, 15 pairs of cacolets, 12 sand-carts, 12 cycle stretchers and six sledges. With this, they were able transport 92 patients at a time, and they set about the task of evacuating the wounded.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 274 The following morning, the 8th Light Horse Regiment was attacked by Ottoman cavalry and camel units. After a period of fighting, the attackers were forced to withdraw, leaving 14 prisoners behind. The whole of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade returned to the battlefield on 10 January with the 7th Light Car Patrol and wagons to collect captured material.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 pp. 269‚Äì70  El Arish bombed  During the night of 19 January, with the benefit of a full moon, German and Ottoman aircraft carried out the biggest aerial bombing raid yet, inflicted on the EEF's fast growing and important forward base of El Arish. As well as dropping bombs, these aircraft, probably the powerful new Albatros D.III, swooped down firing their machine-guns into the camp. Casualties, particularly in the horse lines which were an obvious target from the air, were considerable.Cutlack 1941, p. 52McPherson et al. 1983, pp. 184‚Äì6Wavell 1968, p. 70 Murray's plans The campaign across the Sinai desert, which had begun in August, ended with the expulsion of the Ottoman Empire from Egyptian territory. With the British victory at Rafa, the steady progress of the railway and water pipeline, and the build-up of supplies at El Arish, the EEF was able to build a firm base from which it planned to advance into Ottoman territory. To do so, they needed to capture Gaza first and subsequently the First Battle of Gaza took place in March 1917. On 19 January, British aerial reconnaissance found the Ottoman Army had evacuated El Kossaima and reduced the strength of their main desert base at Hafir el Auja.Cutlack 1941, p. 51 However, GHQ believed the Ottoman garrisons would continue to hold onto the Nekhl area in the centre of the Sinai Peninsula, including the villages of Bir el Hassana, Gebel Helal, Gebel Yelleg and Gebel el Heitan, to maintain control over the Arab population.Cutlack 1941, pp. 53‚Äì54. To address the problem of Ottoman Army units in the rear of the advancing EEF, a raid was carried out by two columns of light horse and yeomanry at Nekhl. The two columns moved out from Serapeum, near Ismailia on the Suez Canal, with three aircraft in support to carry out the attack, to the east. However, as the columns were approaching the area on 17 February, the reconnaissance aircraft found the Ottoman garrisons had retired, and no fighting occurred.Cutlack 1941, pp. 54‚Äì55 NotesCitationsReferences       Category:Conflicts in 1917 Category:1917 in British-administered Palestine Category:Battles of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign Category:Battles of World War I involving Australia Category:Battles of World War I involving New Zealand Category:Battles of World War I involving the United Kingdom Category:Battles of World War I involving the Ottoman Empire Category:Battles of World War I involving Germany Category:History of the Royal Air Force during World War I Category:January 1917 events ","title":"Battle of Rafa"},{"id":"458212","text":"The Mars Surveyor 2001 project was a multi-part Mars exploration mission intended as a follow-up to Mars Surveyor '98. After the two probes of the 1998 project, Mars Climate Orbiter and Mars Polar Lander, were both lost, NASA's \\"better, faster, cheaper\\" exploration philosophy was re-evaluated, with a particular eye on the two 2001 project probes. As a result, the mission, along with the launch of its lander and rover, were canceled in May 2000, but the decision was made to continue development with its orbiter counterpart. The orbiter launched as 2001 Mars Odyssey in April 2001, in a mission independent of the Mars Surveyor project, and reached Mars in October 2001.

Oncken, Gottfried Wilhelm Lehmann (1799‚Äì1882), and Julius Wilhelm K√∂bner (1806‚Äì1884) were known as the Baptist cloverleaf (kleeblatt). J. G. Oncken helped direct and guide the growth of Baptists throughout Germany and across much of Europe for half a century. Early life Johann Gerhard Oncken was born in Varel, a town in the Duchy of Oldenburg. His father was exiled for political reasons, his mother died, and his grandmother raised him. As a child, Oncken was baptized a Lutheran, and confirmed in 1814. About that time, Oncken was apprenticed to a Scottish merchant. Oncken moved to Scotland and worked in the merchant's business, later working as a tutor in Leith (now part of Edinburgh) and subsequently moving to London. In Scotland Oncken first attended the Kirk (Church of Scotland), whilst also reading the writings of Anglican James Hervey.Ella, G M. Johann Gerhard Oncken: Germany‚Äôs Baptist Pioneer When he moved to London he attended worship in an Independent church (Congregationalist). He was converted at Great Queen Street Methodist Chapel in London in 1820. By 1823 Oncken had returned to Germany as an agent of the British Continental society for the Diffusion of Religious Knowledge over the Continent of Europe. At the time, he was a member of the English Reformed Church under the care of T. W. Matthews. The first Sunday School in Germany was formed in 1825, through the work of Oncken and a Reverend Rautenberg. In 1828, Oncken received an appointment from the Edinburgh Bible Society. He spent over half a century distributing tracts and Bibles, and in 1879 he estimated he had given out over two million Bibles. Family Oncken married Sarah Mann of London on 19 May 1828. He and Sarah had seven children. She died in 1845, leaving five surviving children. In 1847, Oncken married a widow from Yorkshire named Ann Dogshun. Both Oncken's children and the Hamburg congregation fully accepted her. Ann died in 1873. She and Oncken had no children. In 1875, Oncken married Jane Clark. Jane was a member of Spurgeon's Tabernacle in London. right Adoption of Baptist views Though Oncken lived in Scotland and was converted in London, there is no existing evidence of any contact with the English Baptists. The evangelical Christianity of Scotland was influenced the Haldane brothers, and it is known that at least later Oncken made contact with them. Oncken apparently arrived at a \\"Baptist\\" position on believer's baptism (and baptism by immersion) by degrees through personal Bible study. By 1829, though still a member of a church that taught infant baptism, he appears to have decided against it, for in that year he refused to present his child for the ceremony. He discussed the baptism issue with T. W. Matthews (his pastor), C. F. Lange (one of his first converts) and others. Matthews became convinced that he should be baptized by immersion, resigned his church and traveled to England to be baptized. In 1829, Oncken corresponded with James Haldane of Scotland. Haldane recommended that Oncken baptize himself, as John Smyth had done. Oncken thought this was without Biblical authority, and said of Haldane's advice, \\"Even great men are able to err.\\" Oncken also corresponded with Joseph Ivimey.Joseph Ivimey was the author of . Ivimey invited him to come to London and receive believer's baptism. Oncken had also told his story to Calvin Tubbs, a sea captain. Tubbs told Oncken's story to the (American Baptist) Triennial Convention. In 1833, Barnas Sears, a professor at Hamilton College, visited Germany for studies. Having heard the story, he made it a point to find and speak to Oncken. By 1834, Oncken had made a final decision. Sears traveled from Halle, where he was studying, to Hamburg, and baptized Oncken, his wife and five others in the Elbe on 22 April. The baptism was performed at night. The next day, Sears founded the first Baptist church in Hamburg. William H. Brackney, Historical Dictionary of the Baptists, Scarecrow Press, USA, 2009, p. 248 The church quickly grew to 68 members by 1836, but after that year persecution temporarily halted its growth. Though the Baptists initially engaged in performing baptisms at night, in 1837 Oncken began to baptize openly. German authorities shared the traditional Christian opposition to rebaptism; they also felt that people being dipped in the river was an offence to public morals. The civil authorities gave them peace for a while after the Hamburg fire of 1842, due to the help the Baptists gave to the people of the city. In 1848, Oncken was involved in founding Das Missionblatt, the first Baptist paper published regularly in Europe. In 1849, he began to hold organized classes with his students, and in 1880 a four-year seminary was established in Hamburg. He was also influential in the German Baptist confession of faith issued in 1847,Oncken and K√∂bner's confession supplied to the local Hamburg authorities in 1837 formed part of the foundation of the . and the organization of the Union of Baptist Congregations in 1849. Relations with Mennonites While in Hamburg, Oncken became acquainted with Jacob Gysbert van der Smissen, a Mennonite deacon. Oncken visited Mennonite churches in Poland in 1833, preaching in the area for about six weeks. Under the encouragement of Abraham Unger, Oncken visited the Mennonite Brethren Church in the Chortitza colony in 1869, assisting in the ordinations of Abraham Unger as elder, Aaron Lepp as minister, and Benjamin Nickel and Cornelius Unger as deacons. After he left, Oncken continued to correspond with the group. A problem arose between Oncken and the Mennonite Brethren when the church banned tobacco use and excommunicated several members who used it. Oncken used tobacco and did not agree with the church action in this case.Mennonite Encyclopedia, Harold S. Bender, Cornelius J. Dyck, Dennis D. Martin, Henry C. Smith, et al., editors Last years By 1878, Oncken was growing physically weaker daily. In physical weakness and suffering, he drew comfort from knowing \\"that Christ, having loved him, loved him to the end.\\" He resigned as agent for the various tract and Bible societies that he was serving, but continued to pastor. The Scottish Bible Society gave him a pension. Late in 1879, Oncken suffered a stroke. His physical condition compelled him to retire in 1881. He moved to Z√ºrich where he died peacefully on 2 January 1884. He told his family that his name \\"was inscribed in Heaven's roll, and that his hope was sure.\\" His body was taken to Hamburg for interment. K√∂bner preached the funeral sermon from Psalm 73:24, \\"Thou shalt guide me with Thy counsel, and afterwards receive me to glory.\\" J. G. Oncken was then buried in the Reformed Church Cemetery in Hamburg. Two verses of Scripture were placed on his grave: \\"One Lord, one faith, one baptism\\" (Ephesians 4:5), and \\"And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread and in prayers\\" (Acts 2:42). Summary J. G. Oncken was truly an international man - converted in England, baptized by an American in Germany, he traveled across the European continent to preach the gospel and give out Bibles. He conducted \\"preaching tours\\" in the Balkans, France, Hungary, Prussia, Russia, and Switzerland, as well as visiting Britain and the United States. He was born a Lutheran, was converted at a Methodist meeting, adopted Baptist views and possessed a relationship with the Mennonites. During his ministry as a Baptist preacher, J. G. Oncken constituted over 280 Baptist churches and 1222 preaching stations. He founded over 170 churches in Scandinavia and the Slavic states. He also formed 771 Sunday Schools in Germany. His ministry even extended indirectly to places such as Australia. Several of the German Baptist settlers in Australia, influenced by Oncken and following in his footsteps, were active in sharing the Gospel with their fellow countrymen, thereby establishing the Baptist work among German immigrants. One such German Baptist minister in Australia was Hermann Windolf who in his memoirs records coming to Australia in 1878 but before doing so called on Oncken at his home in Hamburg. Oncken's theology can be described as conservative, Calvinistic, and evangelistic. He favored ministerial education, but not at the expense of spiritual preparation. He held spiritual gifts as a priority over academic preparation. His zealous methods of preaching and evangelism laid the foundation and set the example for many years to come. His work continues to leave a mark on the Baptists of Germany and Europe. Oncken quote \\"You must not be discouraged in your Christian course by the discovery of your sinful propensities - these will be gradually more fully revealed to you. God does not convert the sinner, to show to him how good he is, but how weak, helpless, sinful and depraved he is, that thus all self-dependence may be destroyed. But then the Spirit of Christ who teaches us this bitter lesson concerning ourselves, also shows us from the Holy Scriptures what a gracious, faithful and almighty Saviour we have, and that through the grace and strength of Him we can do all things. The two great truths which from the day of our conversion to the day we enter into heaven the Lord teaches those who shall be saved are in reference to ourselves that we are poor, lost, helpless sinners, who, if left to themselves, must perish for ever, and in reference to God, that out of boundless compassion He has sent His only begotten Son into the world to atone for the guilt of all who should believe in Him, and then in this glorious Saviour more - infinitely more - has been brought back to all who believe in Him, than ever was lost by Adam's transgression and our own sin.\\" Motto J. G. Oncken's motto was \\"every Baptist a missionary\\" (Jeder Baptist ein Missionar).

Its notable features include support for single system image on computer clustershttp://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/sprite/sprite.html and the introduction of the log-structured filesystem. The Tcl scripting language also originated in this project. Early work Early work on Sprite was based on the idea of making the operating system more \\"network aware\\", and thereby at the same time make it invisible to the user. The primary area of work was the building of a new network file system which made heavy use of local client-side caching in order to improve performance. After opening the file and some initial reads, the network is only used on-demand, and most user actions occur against the cache. Similar utilities allow remote devices to be mapped into the local computer's space, allowing for network printing and similar duties. Many of the key Unix files are based on the network, including things like the password file. All machines in a network share the root directory as well. Other common Unix utilities such as \`finger\` were re- written to make them network aware as well, listing all of the people logged on across the network. This makes a Sprite network appear as if it were a single large time-sharing system, or a single-system image. Another key addition to Sprite is process migration, which allows programs to be moved between machines at any time. The system maintains a list of machines and their state, and automatically moves processes to idle machines to improve local performance. Processes can also be \\"evicted\\" from machines to improve their performance, causing the original starter to move it to another machine on the network, or take control of it locally again. Long tasks (like compiling the Sprite system) can appear very fast. Further development Work on the \\"early\\" Sprite outlined above ended around 1987, but was improved during the next year. Starting in 1990 Sprite was used as the basis for development of the first log-structured file system (LFS), development of which continued until about 1992. LFS dramatically increases the performance of file writes at the expense of read performance. Under Sprite, this tradeoff is particularly useful because most read access is cached anyway‚Äîthat is, Sprite systems typically perform fewer reads than a normal Unix system. LFS- like systems also allow for much easier crash recovery, which became a major focus of the project during this period. Additional experimentation on striped file systems, both striped across different machines as well as clusters of drives, continued until about 1994. Discontinuation Sprite was not a microkernel system, and suffers the same sort of problems as other Unixes in terms of development complexity, becoming increasingly difficult to develop as more functionality was added. By the 1990s it was suffering and the small team supporting the project was simply not able to keep up with the rapid changes in Unix taking place during this time. The project was slowly shut down by 1994.

Fighting took place in and around the town of Gaza on the Mediterranean coast when infantry and mounted infantry from the Desert Column, a component of the Eastern Force, attacked the town. Late in the afternoon, on the verge of capturing Gaza, the Desert Column was withdrawn due to concerns about the approaching darkness and large Ottoman reinforcements. This British defeat was followed a few weeks later by the even more emphatic defeat of the Eastern Force at the Second Battle of Gaza in April 1917. In August 1916 the EEF victory at Romani ended the possibility of land-based attacks on the Suez Canal, first threatened in February 1915 by the Ottoman Raid on the Suez Canal. In December 1916, the newly created Desert Column's victory at the Battle of Magdhaba secured the Mediterranean port of El Arish and the supply route, water pipeline, and railway stretching eastwards across the Sinai Peninsula. In January 1917 the victory of the Desert Column at the Battle of Rafa completed the capture of the Sinai Peninsula and brought the EEF within striking distance of Gaza. In March 1917, two months later, Gaza was attacked by Eastern Force infantry from the 52nd (Lowland) Division reinforced by an infantry brigade. This attack was protected from the threat of Ottoman reinforcements by the Anzac Mounted Division and a screen from the Imperial Mounted Division. The infantry attack from the south and southeast on the Ottoman garrison in and around Gaza was strongly resisted. While the Imperial Mounted Division continued to hold off threatening Ottoman reinforcements, the Anzac Mounted Division attacked Gaza from the north. They succeeded in entering the town from the north, while a joint infantry and mounted infantry attack on Ali Muntar captured the position. However, the lateness of the hour, the determination of the Ottoman defenders, and the threat from the large Ottoman reinforcements approaching from the north and north east, resulted in the decision by the Eastern Force to retreat. It has been suggested this move snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. Background The Eastern Desert (also known as the Negev) As the Allied operations in the Middle East were secondary to the Western Front campaign, reinforcements requested by General Sir Archibald Murray, commander of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF), were denied. Further, on 11 January 1917, the War Cabinet informed Murray that large scale operations in Palestine were to be deferred until September, and he was informed by Field Marshal William Robertson, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff , that he should be ready to send possibly two infantry divisions to France. One week later, Murray received a request for the first infantry division and dispatched the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division. He was assured that none of his mounted units would be transferred from the EEF, and was told \\"that there was no intention of curtailing such activities as he considered justified by his resources.\\"Falls 1930. Vol. 1 p. 272Bruce 2002, pp. 92‚Äì3 Murray repeated his estimate that five infantry divisions, in addition to the mounted units, were needed for offensive operations.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 273 After 26 February 1917, when an Anglo-French Congress at Calais decided on a spring offensive, Murray received strong encouragement. The decision by the Supreme War Council was given increased impetus for \\"Allied activity\\" on 8 March when the Russian Revolution began. By 11 March Baghdad in Mesopotamia had been occupied by British Empire forces, and an offensive in Macedonia had been launched. In April the Battle of Arras was launched by the British, and the French launched the Nivelle offensive.Falls 1930. Vol. 1 p. 279. Britain's three major war objectives now were to maintain maritime supremacy in the Mediterranean Sea, while preserving the balance of power in Europe and the security of Egypt, India, and the Persian Gulf. The latter could be secured by an advance into Palestine and the capture of Jerusalem. A further advance would ultimately cut off the Ottoman forces in Mesopotamia from those on the Arabian Peninsula and secure the region.Woodward 2006, p. 68‚Äì9 By 5 February the water pipeline from the Egyptian Sweet Water Canal, which carried water from the Nile, had reached El Arish, while the railway line was being laid well to the east of that place. The creation of this infrastructure enabled a strong defensive position and a forward base to be established at El Arish.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 276 There were now two possible directions for an advance towards Jerusalem by Eastern Force to take: through Rafa on the coast, or inland through Hafir El Auja, on the Ottoman railway. Lieutenant General Charles Macpherson Dobell, commanding Eastern Force, thought that an advance along the coast could force the Ottoman Army to withdraw their inland forces, as they became outflanked and subject to attack by the EEF from the rear. He proposed keeping two divisions at El Arish, moving his headquarters there, while his mounted division would advance to reoccupy Rafa (captured by the Desert Column on 9 January during the Battle of Rafa). With the 11 January War Cabinet decision reversed by the 26 February Congress, the EEF was now required to capture the stronghold of Gaza as a first step towards the capture of Jerusalem. The town was one of the most ancient cities in the world, being one of five cities of the Palestine Alliance, which had been fought over many times during its 4,000-year history. By 1917 Gaza had an important depot for cereals with a German steam mill. In the area barley, wheat, olives, vineyards, orange groves, and wood for fuel were grown, as well as the grazing of many goats. Barley was exported to England for brewing into beer. Maize, millet, beans, and watermelon were cultivated in most of the surrounding localities, and harvested in early autumn. Mounted units reorganised A pause in the EEF's advance was necessary to enable the lines of communication to be lengthened and strengthened. While this work was being carried out, the mounted brigades were reorganised into two mounted divisions.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 pp. 272, 278Bruce 2002 p. 88 This was prompted by the arrival of the 6th Mounted Brigade and 22nd Mounted Brigade from the Salonika campaign. Instead of grouping the two new mounted brigades with the 5th Mounted Brigade to form a new Imperial Mounted Division, the 3rd Light Horse Brigade was transferred from the Anzac Mounted Division to the new division, and replaced by the 22nd Mounted Brigade. The Imperial Mounted Division, established 12 February 1917 at Ferry Post on the Suez Canal under the command of Major General Henry West Hodgson, was established with the 3rd Light Horse Brigade and 4th Light Horse Brigade (which was in the process of formation at Ferry Post and was scheduled to leave for the front on 18 March) along with the 5th and 6th Mounted Brigades.Bou 2009, pp. 162‚Äì3Imperial Mounted Division War Diary AWM4-1-56-1 Part 13rd Light Horse Brigade War Diary AWM4-10-3-26 Within Dobell's Eastern Force, General Philip Chetwode commanded the Desert Column, which included the Anzac Mounted Division, the partly formed Imperial Mounted Division, and the 53rd (Welsh) Division of infantry. After the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division left for the Western Front, Dobell's Eastern Force consisted of four infantry divisions; the 52nd (Lowland) Division, the 53rd (Welsh) Division, the 54th (East Anglian) Division and the 74th (Yeomanry) Division, which had recently been formed by converting yeomanry regiments into infantry battalions. EEF raid on Khan Yunis Australian prisoners captured at Shellal Dobell thought the victory at Rafa should be quickly exploited by attacking Gaza; \\"an early surprise attack was essential ... otherwise it was widely believed the enemy would withdraw without a fight.\\"Bruce 2002, p. 90Carver 2003, pp. 196‚Äì7 He ordered Rafa to be occupied by mounted troops while two infantry divisions of Eastern Force remained at El Arish to defend his headquarters. On 23 February, the Anzac Mounted Division and the 53rd (Welsh) Division, commanded by Major General S.F. Mott, were camped on the beach at Sheikh Zowaiid. Here they were joined by the 22nd Mounted Brigade, replacing the 5th Mounted Brigade which returned to El Burj.Powles 1922, p. 82 That day, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles and the 2nd Light Horse Brigades commanded by Edward Chaytor made a reconnaissance in force to Khan Yunis past Rafa. Khan Yunis was held in strength, and the Chaytor's Column withdrew after \\"a brush\\" with the defenders. The town was found to be part of a line of strong posts held by the Ottoman Army protecting southern Palestine. Known as the Hans Yonus‚ÄìEl Hafir line, these posts consisted of well-dug trenches. They were located at Shellal, which was a particularly strongly fortified position, at Weli Sheikh Nuran, at Beersheba, and at Khan Yunis.Erickson 2001, p. 161 As a consequence of the reconnaissance to Khan Yunis, and the growing strength of EEF units in the area, the Ottoman Army garrisons realised the line was nevertheless too weak to be successfully defended. In February, Enver Pasha, Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein, and Cemal Pasha withdrew from the line, retiring northwards. Here they established much more formidable defences in front of Gaza, to stop any Allied advance up the coast. This withdrawal was completed by mid‚ÄìMarch when the Ottoman Fourth Army was in position.Powles 1922, pp. 83‚Äì4Keogh 1955, pp. 78‚Äì9Bruce 2002, pp. 90‚Äì1Downes 1938, p. 616 Their new defensive line stretched north and north east, from Gaza on the north side of the Wadi Ghuzzee to Tel esh Sheria, where the Palestine railway crossed the Wadi esh Sheria.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 pp. 277‚Äì8 On 28 February, Chetwode's Desert Column occupied Khan Yunis unopposed and the headquarters of the Column was established at Sheikh Zowaiid, while Eastern Force headquarters remained at El Arish. The ancient town of Khan Yunis on the main road to Gaza was said to be the birthplace of Delilah. With bazaars, narrow streets and a castle, it was one of several villages in this fertile area of southern Palestine, north of Rafa and the Egyptian‚ÄìOttoman frontier. Here was found the largest and deepest well in the area, and after engineers had installed a pumping machine, it gave an unlimited supply of water for both men and horses. The village quickly became an important forward site for supply depots and bivouacs.McPherson 1985 pp. 172‚Äì3Blenkinsop 1925 p. 184 Around Khan Yunis gardens, orange orchards, fig plantations and grazing were carried on by the local population, while in the Rafa and Sheikh Zowaiid areas barley and wheat were grown.Secret Military Handbrook 23 January 1917 Supplies pp. 38‚Äì49 Water pp. 50‚Äì3 Notes pp. 54‚Äì5Moore 1920 p. 68 EEF aerial bombing A series of bombing raids on the railway from Junction Station to Tel el Sheria aimed to disrupt the Ottoman lines of communication during the build-up to the battle. No. 1 Squadron Australian Flying Corps and No. 14 Squadron bombed Beersheba in mid February, destroying 3 German planes, and on 25 February assisted a French battleship's shelling of Jaffa, by directing the ship's fire. On the same day, the German aerodrome at Ramleh was bombed. Then on 5 March six aircraft of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) conducted bombing attacks intended to interfere with the Ottoman withdrawal from the Khan Yunis line. They bombed Beersheba and the Palestine railway at Tel esh Sheria to the northwest. Although the damage was not great, the railway at Tel esh Sheria continued to be bombed in moonlight on 7 March, by relays of aircraft. Junction Station and supply depot, an important junction of southern Palestine railways with the Jaffa‚ÄìJerusalem railway many miles to the north, was also bombed on 9, 13, and 19 March.Cutlack 1941, pp. 56‚Äì9 Prelude=Defending force Kress Von Kressenstein and Colonel Gott at Huj in 1916 British estimates of the defenders facing the EEF in the region at the beginning of 1917 were no more than 12,000, with the possibility of receiving at most one division as reinforcements. In early March, Gaza was garrisoned by two battalions, supported by two batteries of Ottoman field artillery. The \\"Group Tiller\\" garrison from the Ottoman Fourth Army was later increased to seven battalions.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 321 note 1Erickson 2007 pp. 99‚Äì100 The Group consisted of the Ottoman 79th and 125th Infantry Regiments, the 2nd Battalion of the 81st Infantry Regiment, one squadron of cavalry and one company of camelry. Further reinforcements of between 10,000 and 12,000 soldiers were ordered by Kress von Kressenstein as a result of the 300th Flight Detachment's reports of the EEF's advances towards Gaza. Arriving before Eastern Force made its attack, these reinforcements consisted of the 3rd Infantry Division (31st and 32nd Infantry Regiments) from Jemmame, and the 16th Infantry Division (47th and 48th Infantry Regiments) from Tel esh Sheria. They were supported by 12 heavy mountain howitzers in two Austrian batteries, two 10-cm long guns in a German battery (from Pasha I) and two Ottoman field artillery batteries. Ottoman gun among the hedges near Gaza Further, the Ottoman 53rd Infantry Division, which had been garrisoned at Jaffa, was ordered to march south to Gaza, but was not expected before the morning of 27 March. Kress von Kressenstein, the commander of the Ottoman defences, moved his headquarters from Beersheba to Tel esh Sheria where it remained until June.Cutlack 1941 p. 57 note However, by 20 March the British considered the Ottoman Army defending Gaza and dominating the coastal route from Egypt to Jaffa, to be \\"steadily deteriorating.\\" Indeed it had been reported that Kress von Kressenstein complained of \\"heavy losses\\" caused by deserters, and between the EEF victory at Rafa in early January and the end of February, 70 deserters had arrived in the EEF lines. These were thought to be a \\"very small proportion\\" of the majority of Arabs and Syrians in particular, who disappeared from the Ottoman army, \\"into the towns and villages of Palestine and Trans-Jordan.\\"Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 277 and note The EEF were unaware of the recent Ottoman reinforcements and thought the garrison at Gaza was 2,000 strong.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 285 However, by the eve of battle there were probably almost 4,000 rifles defending the town, with up to 50 guns in the surrounding area, while a force of 2,000 rifles garrisoned Beersheba.Bruce 2002, p. 93Gullett 1941, pp. 253‚Äì254Keogh 1955, p. 84 =Ottoman Army defences= Sketch map of Gaza defences (shown in green) at 09:30 on 25 March 1917 Between Rafa and Gaza, to the east of the coastal sand dunes, a gently rolling plateau of light, firm soil rose slowly inland, crossed by several dry wadis, which became torrential flows in the rainy season. In the spring, after the winter rains, the area was covered by young crops or fresh grass.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 pp. 281‚Äì2 For millennia, Gaza had been the gateway for invading armies travelling the coastal route, to and from Egypt and the Levant.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 281 The town and the fertile surrounding areas strongly favoured defence; Gaza being located on a plateau high which is separated from the Mediterranean Sea by about of sand hills to the west. To the north, west, and south, orchards surrounded by impenetrable prickly pear hedges extended out for some from the town. With the exception of the ridge extending southwards, which culminated in the dominating high Ali Muntar, the area of orchards stretched from the high plateau down into a hollow.Downes 1938, p. 618Powles 1922, p. 91 In addition to these natural defences, the Ottoman Army constructed trenches and redoubts that extended from the south west of the town virtually all the way round the town, except for a gap to the north east. In the process they incorporated Ali Muntar into the town entrenchments by building additional defences on the ridge to the south of the town.Anzac Mounted Division War Diary March 1917 Appendix No. 54 Sketch Map showing position of attacking infantry and mounted divisions at about 09:30 on 25 March 1917. Although the trenches were only lightly strengthened with barbed wire, those to the south of Gaza commanded bare slopes which were completely devoid of any cover whatsoever. =Plan of defence= Felmy in his Albatros at Huj As a result of the EEF advance to Rafa and their lengthening of their lines of communication along the coast, flank attacks became a threat. This was because the Ottoman lines of communication further inland overlapped the EEF advance on the coast, and it became important to garrison the region strongly.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 280 The EEF right flank would not be in prepared defences, and was potentially vulnerable to an envelopment assault. Kress von Kressenstein, therefore, deployed most of his defending army away from Gaza to attack the EEF's supply lines. British intelligence thought the defenders would not fight hard for Gaza, because Kress von Kressenstein's plan was to use the 3rd and the 16th Infantry Divisions and the 3rd Cavalry Division to encircle the attacking force and cut the Sinai railway and water pipeline, in the rear of the EEF. A total of 12,000 of the available 16,000 Ottoman soldiers were moving west, to be in position to launch an attack by nightfall on the day of battle.Erickson 2007, p. 100 The main Ottoman force of between two and a half and three divisions, estimated between 6,000 and 16,000 rifles, were deployed at Tel el Negile and Huj with detachments at Tel esh Sheria, Jemmameh, Hareira, Beersheba, and Gaza, to prevent the EEF from out-flanking Gaza.Keogh 1955, p. 83Bruce 2002, p. 92 The rear of the EEF was to be attacked by the Ottoman 16th Division, at a point where the road from Khan Yunis to Gaza crossed the Wadi Ghuzze, and by the Beersheba Group which was to advance via Shellal, to attack Khan Yunis. Attacking force The 22,000-strong attack force consisted of 12,000 infantry and 11,000 mounted troops, supported by between 36 and 96 field guns and 16 howitzers. The mounted units were to stop the Ottoman reinforcements from Tel el Sheria, Jemmameh, Hareira, Negile, Huj, and Beersheba, from reinforcing the Gaza garrison while the infantry captured the town.Gullett 1941 p. 265The numbers of British troops involved are approximate only.

A caravan of loaded camels is in the foreground With firmer ground the pedrails came off the guns and their teams of eight and ten horses were reduced to six. It also became possible to use wheeled vehicles, and in January the War Office agreed to the infantry divisions being re-equipped with wheeled transport trains. These were to replace camel transport, on the condition that drivers would be found locally, as no transfers from other campaigns were possible. Although camel trains remained important throughout the war, together with pack mules and donkeys, where roads were bad and in hilly trackless terrain, where the horse-drawn and mule-drawn wagons, motor lorries and tractors could not go, they began to be replaced. General service and limber wagons drawn by horses or mules were grouped in supply columns, with the transport wagons of the regiments, the machine‚Äìgun squadrons, and the field ambulances, to travel on easier but less direct routes. However, all these animals required vast quantities of food and water, which greatly increased pressure on the lines of communication. During the advance across the Sinai, although it was established that horses did better with two drinks a day instead of three, the volume remained the same.Preston 1921, p. 315Gullett 1941, pp. 244‚Äì5Downes 1938, p. 615Moore 1920, p. 82Lindsay 1992, pp. 346, 379 Supplying the infantry and mounted divisions was a vast undertaking, as one brigade (and there were six involved in the attack on Gaza) of light horse, mounted rifles, and yeomanry at war establishment consisted of approximately 2,000 soldiers as well as the division of infantry; all requiring food and drink, clothing, ammunition and tools, etc.Mounted Service Manual 1902, p. 10 Transport was organised, combining the horse-drawn and mule-drawn supply columns with the camel trains, to support Eastern Force operating beyond railhead for about 24 hours.Hill 1978, pp. 99‚Äì100Falls notes there was insufficient transport to support operations at any considerable distance from railhead and while the infantry had wheeled transport the mounted divisions still had camel transport. [Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 280] \\"The wagons [of the Anzac Mounted Division] with their teams of mules, two in the pole and three in the lead, [were] driven by one man from the box.\\" These wagons and mules were so successful that the five-mule team was \\"laid down for the Egyptian Expeditionary Force ... ultimately almost supersed[ing] the British four or six horse ride-and-drive team.\\"Powles 1922 p. 23 =Plan of attack= Septimus Power of Lieutenant Frank McNamara and Captain David Rutherford No. 67 Squadron, 5th Wing Royal Flying Corps, returning from aerial bombing near Gaza on 20 March 1917 Although Murray delegated the responsibility for the battle to Dobell, he set three objectives. These were to capture a line along the Wadi Ghuzzee in order to cover the laying of the railway line, to prevent the defenders withdrawing before they were attacked, and to \\"capture Gaza and its garrison by a coup de main.\\" The plan of attack produced by Dobell and his staff, was similar to those successfully implemented at Magdhaba by Chauvel and at Rafa by Chetwode, except that the EEF infantry were to have a prominent role. On a larger scale than the previous battles, the garrison at Gaza, established in fortified entrenchments and redoubts, was to be surrounded and captured, before Ottoman reinforcements could arrive.Cutlack 1941 p. 59 The main attack on the town and Ali Muntar hill would come from the south, by the Desert Column's 53rd (Welsh) Division commanded by Dallas, supported by one infantry brigade of Eastern Force's 54th (East Anglian) Division, commanded by Hare. The Anzac and Imperial Mounted Divisions, commanded by Chauvel and Hodgson respectively, were to establish a screen or cordon around Gaza to the north and east to isolate the garrison, cutting the main roads and preventing an incursion by Ottoman reinforcements reaching the town from their garrisons at Hareira, Beersheba, and Huj. If necessary, the mounted divisions were to be ready to reinforce the infantry attack, while the remaining infantry brigades of the 54th (East Anglian) Division extended the mounted screen to the southeast, just across the Wadi Ghuzzee.Moore 1920 p. 65Powles 1922 p. 87 On 5 March, Murray agreed to Dobell's plan for the attack, which was to be launched at the end of March. On 20 March Dobell moved his headquarters from El Arish to Rafa. The next day, the Rafa Race Meeting took place, complete with trophies ordered from Cairo, and a printed programme. These races, complete with an enclosed paddock, totalizator, jumps, and a marked course, were contested by Yeomanry, Australian and New Zealand horses and riders.Hill 1978 pp. 100‚Äì1 On 22 March, all roads and tracks were reconnoitred as far as Deir el Belah and allotted to the different formations, and preliminary moves towards Gaza were begun. Dallas' orders were handed to the Anzac, Imperial Mounted, and the 54th (East Anglian) Divisions' commanders at 17:00 on 25 March. The 53rd (Welsh) Division's 158th (North Wales) and 160th (Welsh Border) Brigades were to begin crossing the Wadi Ghuzzeh at 03:30 and advance up the Burjabye and Es Sire ridges, while the 159th (Cheshire) Brigade which followed the 158th (North Wales) across the wadi, was to remain close to the wadi until further orders were received. Money's Detachment was to cross the wadi mouth and hold a position in the sand dunes between the Rafa-Gaza road and the sea to divert the Ottoman defenders' attention, and cover a section of the 15th Heavy Battery. A section of 91st Heavy Battery was to move into the wadi, while a section the 10th Heavy Battery of 60-pdrs was attached to the 160th Brigade Group. However, artillery ammunition was limited and was to mainly target the Labyrinth group of Ottoman defences. The mounted divisions were to isolate Gaza by stopping the Gaza garrison retiring, or any reinforcements from Huj and Hareira areas, attempting to reinforce Gaza. They were to pursue any hostile force that showed signs of retiring, and if necessary support the main assault on Gaza, which was to be carried out by the 53rd (Welsh) Division. This division was to be reinforced if necessary by the 161st (Essex) Brigade of the 54th (East Anglian) Division.Anzac Mounted Division War Diary AWM4-1-60-13 Appendix 54 pp. 1‚Äì2Keogh 1955, pp. 85‚Äì6Falls 1930 Vol. 1 pp. 285‚Äì6 At 18:00 Murray, the commander in chief of the EEF, established his headquarters in the carriage of a railway train at El Arish.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 289 =Preliminary moves= On 25 March, the Anzac Mounted Division moved out of their bivouacs in two columns. The first column, consisting of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles and the 22nd Mounted Yeomanry Brigades, marched up the beach from Bir Abu Shunnar at 02:30, to establish a line just south of the Wadi Ghuzzeh. This advance was to cover reconnaissances of the Wadi Ghuzzeh, which would search for the best places to cross this deep, dry, and formidable obstacle, for both infantry and mounted troops as they advanced towards Gaza.Powles 1922 pp. 84‚Äì5Pugsley 2004 p. 138 The second column, consisting of Anzac Mounted Division's divisional headquarters, Signal Squadron, Field Artillery, and the 2nd Light Horse Brigade (forming divisional reserve), arrived southwest of Deir el Belah. Here the 2nd Light Horse Brigade and the artillery were ordered to water and bivouac at Deir el Belah. By 10:00, Chauvel's Anzac Mounted Division's headquarters and Chetwode's Desert Column headquarters had been established on Hill 310.Anzac Mounted Division War Diary March 1917 AWM4-1-60-13 Appendix 54 p. 1 10:00 While the Ottoman army positions at Gaza had been reconnoitred and photographed from the air, it was still necessary for the staff of the Anzac and Imperial Mounted Divisions, along with the Commander of the Royal Artillery (CRA), to carry out personal reconnaissances of the Wadi Ghuzzeh. By the afternoon all likely crossings had been carefully reconnoitred, and the chosen crossing near the Wadi Sharta, which was to be used the next day, marked.Anzac Mounted Division War Diary March 1917 AWM4-1-60-13 Appendix 54 p. 1 14:40 At 15:30 the Imperial Mounted Division, led by the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, marched out of camp at Marakeb, heading for Deir el Belah about six hours or away. The division's three brigades and their machine gun squadrons were accompanied by their mobile veterinary sections and the 3rd Light Horse Field Ambulance. The troopers carried their day's rations, while rations for 26 and 27 March were to be transported forward during the night of 25/26 March, by the first line transport of camels and wagons. As it had been expected the division would be away five days, additional rations were carried on improvised packs, which accompanied the division as far as Deir el Belah.3rd Australian Light Horse Brigade War Diary AWM4-10-3-26 Order No. 15 =Approach marches 26 March= On the day of battle, the 53rd (Welsh) Division, moved out from Deir el Belah at 01:00 in four columns towards El Breij, followed by the artillery. At 02:30 the Anzac Mounted Division left Deir el Belah with the Imperial Mounted Division following at 03:00, heading for the Um Jerrar crossing of the Wadi Ghazze east of Deir el Belah.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 pp. 287‚Äì8 Dallas commanding the infantry established his battle headquarters near El Breij at 03:45, while Chetwode arrived at Desert Column headquarters at In Seirat at 06:37, although he intended to continue moving on to Sheikh Abbas. Dobell commanding Eastern Force arrived from Rafa, at his battle headquarters just north of In Seirat at 06:45. Fog had begun to develop and from about 03:50 became very thick. It remained for about four hours, then began to lift. Just before dawn at 05:00, it was so dense that objects could not be seen away, but by this time most of the infantry had crossed the wadi. However, the fog made it impossible for Dallas to reconnoitre the proposed battleground, and he waited at El Breij for it to lift while his two leading brigades moved slowly forward. Visibility was improving about 07:30,Falls 1930 Vol. 1 pp. 289‚Äì90There are varying accounts of exactly when the fog lifted from 07:00 to 11:00. [Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 290 note] and by 07:55 the fog had lifted sufficiently for heliographs to be used.Anzac Mounted Division War Diary March 1917 AWM4-1-60-13 Appendix 54 p. 2 However, all aircraft in No. 1 Squadron had to return to their new landing ground at Rafa, as nothing of the ground could be seen from the air. Dallas' 53rd (Welsh) Division was moving forward, despite the fog to make a direct assault on Gaza.Dennis et al 2008, p. 407Downes 1938, p. 619 At 05:20, the division's 158th (North Wales) and the 160th (Welsh Border) infantry brigades were crossing the Wadi Ghuzze while the 159th (Cheshire) Brigade was in reserve. By 06:50 the 160th (Welsh Border) Brigade had moved towards Shaluf and the 158th (North Wales) Brigade was moving towards Mansura, but they were ordered to slow down because artillery support may not be available, if the fog were to suddenly lift.Desert Column War Diary March 1917 AWM4-1-64-3 Part 1-1 By 07:50, the leading battalions were approaching Sheikh Seehan without having encountered any Ottoman defenders. Between 08:15 and 08:55 hostile planes flew over the advancing infantry, firing their machine guns into the columns. At 08:30 the 160th (Welsh) Brigade was about from Gaza, with their leading battalion southwest of the commanding heights of their main objective, Ali Muntar. The 158th (North Wales) Brigade had reached Mansura,Hill 1978, pp. 103‚Äì4 and by 09:30 they were three quarters of a mile (1.2 km) north of the 53rd (Welsh) Division's headquarters at Mansura. Meanwhile, the 54th (East Anglian) Division (less 161st Essex Brigade in Eastern Force reserve) was ordered to cross the Wadi Ghuzzeh immediately after the mounted troops, and take up a position at Sheikh Abbas to cover the rear of the 53rd (Welsh) Division, and keep the corridor open along which it was to attack. The division took up position on Sheikh Abbas Ridge and began digging trenches facing east. The 161st (Essex) Brigade moved to El Burjabye, where it would be able to support either the 53rd (Welsh) Division, or the 54th (East Anglian) Division covering the right rear of the attack, at Sheikh Abbas.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 293 Money's Detachment moved towards the wadi in preparation for crossing at dawn, while the 91st Heavy Battery was covered by the Duke of Lancaster's Own Yeomanry and the divisional cavalry squadron, moved to a position on the Rafa-Gaza road.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 288 =Encirclement= Position of the Anzac Mounted Division at about 09:30 (not labelled) with the Imperial Mounted Division, two columns of the 53rd (Welsh) Division and one column of the 54th (East Anglian) Division. Ottoman defences shown in green While the fog made navigation difficult, it also shielded the movement of large bodies of troopers, so the two mounted divisions with the Imperial Camel Brigade attached, rapidly cut the roads leading to Gaza from the north and east, isolating the Ottoman garrison, in a long cavalry screen. The leading division, the Anzac Mounted Division, first encountered hostile forces at 08:00. At that time the 7th Light Horse Regiment (2nd Light Horse Brigade) was attacked near Sheikh Abbas. Shortly afterwards, hostile aircraft fired machine guns on these leading Desert Column mounted troops. As the mounted screen crossed the Gaza to Beersheba road, they cut the telegraph lines, and a patrol captured ten wagons, while other units captured 30 German pioneers and their pack-horses.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 291 At this time, the German commander at Tel esh Sheria, Kress von Kressenstein, received an aerial report describing the advance of two enemy infantry divisions towards Gaza, and about three enemy cavalry divisions and armoured cars, had advanced north between Gaza and Tel esh Sheria. Major Tiller, commanding the Gaza garrison, reported later being attacked from the south, east, and northeast \\"in great strength.\\" He was ordered to hold Gaza \\"to the last man.\\" Soon after 09:00 the 2nd Light Horse Brigade reached Beit Durdis, closely followed by the remainder of their Anzac Mounted Division. At 09:30 four \\"Officers Patrols\\" were sent forward towards Huj, Najd north northeast of Huj, Hareira, Tel el Sheria and towards the Ottoman railway line. The headquarters of the Anzac Mounted Division was established at Beit Durdis, and by 10:10 communications by cable with Desert Column, the Imperial Mounted Division, and the 2nd Light Horse Brigade were established. Heliograph stations were also set up and wireless communications established, but the wireless was blocked by a more powerful Ottoman transmitter at Gaza.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 292 By 10:30, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade had taken up a position (known as Australia Hill) overlooking Gaza from the northeast, and had occupied the village of Jebaliye northeast of Gaza. Half an hour later, the 7th Light Horse Regiment (2nd Light Horse Brigade) was pushing westwards and by 11:30 had reached the Mediterranean coast, to complete the encirclement of Gaza. In the process the regiment captured the commander of the Ottoman 53rd Division, not to be confused with the 53rd (Welsh) Division, and his staff, who had been on their way to strengthen the Gaza garrison. At this time, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade was concentrated near Beit Durdis, while the 22nd Mounted Brigade formed up south of them. Two squadrons of the 8th Light Horse Regiment (3rd Light Horse Brigade) moved towards Deir Sneid northeast of Gaza to watch and wait for the expected approach of reinforcements, moving to strengthen Gaza.Anzac Mounted Division War Diary March 1917 AWM4-1-60-13 Appendix 54 p. 3Falls 1930 Vol. 1 pp. 291‚Äì2 The Imperial Mounted Division sent patrols towards Hareira, Tel esh Sheria, Kh. Zuheilika and Huj, during their advance to Kh er Reseim where they arrived at 10:00, to connect with the Anzac Mounted Division. Meanwhile, at 09:45, a squadron from the Queen's Own Worcestershire Hussars (5th Mounted Brigade) had encountered hostile units northwest of Kh. el Baha which they charged, capturing 60 prisoners. A further two squadrons of the 5th Mounted Brigade pushed forward towards Kh. el Baha south east of Kh er Reseim, north of the Gaza to Beersheba road, where they remained in support. The two mounted divisions were now in position, watching for the expected Ottoman reinforcements. By between 11:00 and 11:35, more or less all mounted troops were under fire. This fire came from shells launched from Gaza, or from German or Ottoman planes flying over Beit Durdis, as well as a long range gun, while another gun also fired on the mounted units. The battery of the 5th Mounted Brigade fired on some small groups of Ottoman infantry, but the hostile long range gun accurately returned fire, causing this battery to change position. Very little fighting had yet taken place, so far as the mounted units were concerned, and the infantry attack had not made much progress. However, news was beginning to come in from the overwatching Desert Column patrols, reporting movements from the direction of Huj and the Beersheba railway line, and columns of dust in the direction of Tel esh Sharia, all indicating large scale Ottoman Army movements in progress.Powles 1922, p. 90 However, by 12:00 Chetwode commanding Desert Column, had not yet received any reports of Ottoman reinforcements moving towards Gaza, and he sent a message to Chauvel commanding the Anzac Mounted Division and Hodgson commanding the Imperial Mounted Division, to prepare to send a brigade each to assist the infantry attack on Gaza.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 297 The Imperial Camel Brigade crossed the Wadi Ghuzzeh at Tel el Jemmi south of the crossings at Um Jerrar, to reach El Mendur on the bank of the Wadi esh Sheria. Here they established an outpost line between the right of the 5th Mounted Brigade and the Wadi Ghuzzeh.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 pp. 292‚Äì3 The mobile sections of the field ambulances, followed by their immobile sections and ambulance camel transport, moved towards their outpost positions northeast and east of Gaza.Hill 1978, p. 101Downes 1938, pp. 618‚Äì9 With the wadi crossed and strongly defended by the EEF, divisional engineers quickly began to pump water from below the dry bed of the Wadi Ghuzzeh, which was eventually sufficient for all troops engaged. Water was pumped into long rows of temporary canvas troughs for the horses. Battle=Infantry attack Four arrow headed red dotted lines indicate direction of infantry attack Gaza was now completely surrounded and, following Desert Column's orders, the 53rd (Welsh) Division, which had not seen action since the Gallipoli campaign, made a direct attack from the south and east towards Ali Muntar. Their 160th (Welsh Border) Brigade advanced towards Esh Sheluf to get into position by 08:30, with the 158th (North Wales) Brigade advancing towards Mansura, while the 159th (Cheshire) Brigade, which had crossed the wadi by 08:25, had to wait an hour before Dallas ordered them to Mansura to support the 158th Brigade. This delay meant that the 159th could not get into position to take part in the attack until noon.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 pp. 293‚Äì4, 301 Dallas \\"had not yet decided\\" what to do with the 159th. While he met with his brigadiers at the 158th Brigade's headquarters at 10:15, to discuss detailed arrangements of the attack, he was out of communication with Chetwode. This lasted for two hours while his headquarters was moved forward. Dallas contacted Chetwode at 10:50, blaming the delay on the difficulty of bringing the artillery forward, but confirmed he would be ready to launch the attack at 12:00. Due to communication breakdown, Dallas was unaware of the position of the artillery. He had phoned Desert Corps at \\"10.4\\" [sic] to be told that the 161st (Essex) Brigade and the 271st RFA were at Sheikh Nebhan. However, they had moved to an exposed position at El Burjabye before finding a covered position in the valley between the Burjabye and Es Sire Ridges. The artillery was in fact already in position and had begun firing at 10:10, although communications had not been established with headquarters.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 pp. 294‚Äì5 Fog has also been blamed for the delayed infantry attack.Bou 2009 p. 160Falls 1930 Vol. 1 pp. 289‚Äì90, 293 The artillery bombardment began at 12:00, although there was no artillery program, and the Ottoman defences had not been identified. Dallas received his orders at 11:00, and half an hour later Dobell and Chetwode ordered him to launch his attack forthwith.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 296 By 11:30, Desert Column staff considered that the 53rd (Welsh) Division was practically stationary, and the following message was sent to Dallas: \\"I am directed to observe that (1) you have been out of touch with Desert Column and your own headquarters for over two hours; (2) no gun registration appears to have been carried out; (3) that time is passing, and that you are still far from your objective; (4) that the Army and Column Commanders are exercised at the loss of time, which is vital; (5) you must keep a general staff officer at your headquarters who can communicate with you immediately; (6) you must launch your attack forthwith.\\" A similar message was sent again at 12:00.Gullett 1941 p. 273There is no mention of any units of the 53rd (Welsh) Division in Desert Column's War Diary between 09:30 when the division established headquarters at Mansura and 13:10, when the 159th (Cheshire) Brigade came into action beside the 158th (North Wales) Brigade. [Desert Column War Diary March 1917 AWM4-1-64-3 Part 1-1] Dallas ordered the attack to begin at 11:45 on Ali Muntar by the 160th (Welsh Border) Brigade which advanced to attack their objective along the Es Sire Ridge, while the 158th (North Wales) which advanced from Mansura, also attacked Ali Muntar. These two infantry brigades had been in position awaiting orders for between three and four hours, while the 159th (Cheshire) Brigade rapidly deployed.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 pp. 296‚Äì7 They were about from their objectives with patrols going forward, with the 159th (Cheshire) Brigade (less one battalion), covering their right, advancing to attack the hummock known as Clay Hill. This objective was located to the north of Ali Muntar, on the far side of the Gaza to Beersheba road. The attacking brigades were supported by two field artillery brigades, while a divisional reserve was formed by one battalion of the 159th (Cheshire) Brigade, until the arrival of the 161st (Essex) Brigade (Eastern Force's 54th Division).Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 296It has been claimed that at 10:15 the commander of 53rd (Welsh) Division ordered the attack on Gaza and fifteen minutes later the attack commenced. [Hill 1978 pp. 103‚Äì4, 22nd Mounted Brigade Headquarters War Diary AWM4‚Äì9‚Äì2‚Äì1 Part 1] The attacking infantry brigades met with stubborn opposition from determined defenders, firing from strong entrenchments with a clear view of the infantry line of advance, over completely open ground. In these conditions, the attacking infantry's artillery support proved inadequate and a very high number of casualties was suffered.Powles 1922, p. 89 In support, the 54th (East Anglian) Division (less one brigade in Eastern Force reserve) was ordered to cross the Wadi Ghuzzeh immediately after the mounted troops and take up a position at Sheikh Abbas, to cover the rear of the 53rd (Welsh) Division, and keep open the corridor along which the attack was launched. At 11:45 the 161st (Essex) Brigade (54th Division, Eastern Force) was ordered to advance to Mansura in support of the attacking brigades, but the message was apparently never received. At 13:10 an order which had originated from Eastern Force at 12:45 was finally received by hand from a staff officer.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 pp. 295‚Äì6 Combined attack Positions of the attacking force shown in red and hostile force in green at about 14:00 By noon, Chetwode was concerned that the strength of the opposition to the infantry attack, could make it impossible to capture Gaza before dark. As a consequence, he ordered Chauvel and Hodgson to reconnoitre towards Gaza, warning them to be prepared to supply one brigade each to reinforce the infantry attack. At 13:00 Chetwode put Chauvel in command of both mounted divisions, and by 14:00 Chauvel was ordering the whole of the Anzac Mounted Division to attack Gaza from the north, while the Imperial Mounted Division and Imperial Camel Brigade, supported by Nos 11 and 12 Light Armoured Motor Batteries and No. 7 Light Car Patrol, were to hold the outpost line and all observation posts. As the Anzac Mounted Division moved north, it was replaced in the mounted screen by the Imperial Mounted Division, which in turn was replaced by the Imperial Camel Brigade.Powles 1922, p. 90Falls 1930 Vol. 1 pp. 297‚Äì8 Positions of the mounted screen (in red) and hostile forces (in green) at 14:00 It took time for the divisions to get into position, and to move Chauvel's headquarters to a knoll between Beit Durdis and Gaza, so he could oversee operations. It was not until during a meeting there at 15:15 that orders were issued for the Anzac Mounted Division's attack.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 298 They deployed with the 2nd Light Horse Brigade on a front extending from the Mediterranean Sea to the Gaza to Jebalieh road, the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade deployed from the Gaza- Jebalieh road to the top of the ridge running northeast, while the Lincolnshire Yeomanry and Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry regiments, of the 22nd Mounted Brigade, held from the right of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade to the track leading to Beit Durdis.Anzac Mounted Division War Diary March 1917 AWM4-1-60-13 Appendix 54 p. 422nd Mounted Brigade Headquarters War Diary AWM4‚Äì9‚Äì2‚Äì1 Part 1Powles 1922 p. 90‚Äì1 During this time, the infantry attack on Gaza by the 53rd (Welsh) Division had been progressing. By 13:30, the 160th (Welsh Border) Brigade on the left had advanced rapidly to capture the Labyrinth, a maze of entrenched gardens due south of Gaza. Their 2/10th Middlesex Regiment established themselves on a grassy hill, while their 1/4th Royal Sussex Regiment advanced up the centre of the Es Sire ridge under intense hostile fire, suffering heavy casualties including their commanding officer. Having reached the crest, they were forced to fall back in some disorder by the Ottoman defenders. However, after being reinforced at 16:00 they recommenced their advance.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 302 On the right the 158th (North Wales) Brigade's 1/5th Royal Welsh Fusiliers battalion reached the cactus hedges south of Ali Muntar, where they paused to wait for supporting battalions to come up on their right. Along with the 159th (Cheshire) Brigade, these two brigades slowly fought their way forward towards Clay Hill. Meanwhile, Dallas ordered the 161st (Essex) Brigade of the 54th (East Anglian) Division to capture Green Hill and fill the gap between the 158th (North Wales) and 160th (Welsh Border) Brigades (53rd Division). By 15:30 the 161st (Essex) Brigade had reached Mansura and they were in a position to launch their attack at 16:00 with the arrival of the 271st Brigade RFA. The fire from this artillery brigade dampened the hostile machine gun fire from Clay Hill, and at 15:50, 45 minutes after the 161st (Essex) Brigade joined the battle, the infantry succeeded in entering the defenders' trenches. They entered at two places to the east of the Ali Muntar mosque, capturing 20 German and Austrian soldiers and another 20 Ottoman soldiers. The 53rd (Welsh) Division reported the successful capture of Clay Hill, located within of Ali Muntar, at 16:45.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 pp. 301‚Äì3 Meanwhile the attack by the Anzac Mounted Division, began twenty minutes ahead of schedule at 15:40, before all the patrols had been relieved by the Imperial Mounted Division. The Anzac Mounted Division was supported by the Leicester and Ayrshire artillery batteries, which came into action at ranges of between from their targets, respectively. Shortly after the attack began, Chetwode sent messages emphasising the importance of this attack, warning that the trench line northwest of Gaza between El Meshaheran and El Mineh on the sea, was strongly held and offering another brigade from the Imperial Mounted Division, which Chauvel accepted. Hodgson sent the 3rd Light Horse Brigade.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 299 At 16:15, five minutes after the 159th (Cheshire) Brigade captured the Clay Hill redoubt near Ali Muntar, the attack on Gaza from the north by the Anzac Mounted Division's 2nd Light Horse Brigade, supported by the Somerset artillery battery, had not been seriously engaged until they reached the cactus hedges. Here they were strongly resisted in close, intense fighting. The cactus hedges had forced the light horsemen to dismount, however, the assault soon developed and progress was rapid.While fighting on foot, one quarter of a light horse and mounted rifle brigade were holding the horses. A brigade was then equivalent in rifle strength to an infantry battalion. [Preston 1921 p. 168] The 2nd Light Horse Brigade was supported by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, which moved forward with the Canterbury Mounted Rifle Regiment in advance, and the Wellington Mounted Rifle Regiment in support. However, only three troops of the Auckland Mounted Rifle Regiment were in position, the remainder being delayed in the mounted screen, by strong hostile columns of reinforcements advancing from Huj and Nejed. At 16:23, the high ridge east of Gaza was captured by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, while the 22nd Mounted Brigade on their left captured the knoll running west from the ridge. The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade's headquarters subsequently took up a position on the ridge, in an area later called \\"Chaytor's Hill\\". The Wellington and Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiments pressed on towards Gaza, supported by four machine guns attached to each regiment, the remaining four machine guns being held in reserve.Powles 1922, pp. 92‚Äì3 Between 16:30 and 17:00, Ali Muntar was captured by the infantry and the dismounted New Zealanders. The Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment had pushed along 'The Ridge' from the rear to assist in the attack, one squadron swinging south against Ali Muntar to enter the defenders' trenches just after the infantry. Two Krupp Guns captured by the Wellington Mounted Rifle Regiment By dusk the light horsemen had reached the northern and western outskirts of the town. The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade's dismounted fighters advanced from Jebaliye against the east and northeast of Gaza to assist in the capture of Ali Muntar, before pushing on through a very enclosed region. This area was intersected with cactus hedges, buildings, and rifle pits occupied by defending riflemen, who strongly resisted the attackers. Despite considerable opposition the New Zealanders continued to slowly advance through the orchards and cactus hedges to the outskirts of the town. During this advance, the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment captured two 77-mm Krupp guns with limbers and ammunition. Shortly afterwards, their progress was stopped by snipers in several houses on the eastern outskirts of the town. The Krupp guns were pushed forward to fire at point blank, blowing up several houses and causing the surrender of 20 hostile soldiers. Meanwhile, the 22nd Mounted Brigade, advancing at the gallop along the track from Beit Durdis to Gaza, had also reached the outskirts of the town by dusk.Anzac Mounted Division War Diary March 1917 AWM4-1-60-13 Appendix 54 pp. 4‚Äì5 By nightfall, the Anzac Mounted Division had fought their way into the streets of Gaza, suffering very few casualties during this advance. While the attack in the centre by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade was progressing, the 22nd Mounted Brigade had come up on the New Zealanders' left, and it was this attacking force that entered the town. Meanwhile, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade had met stiff resistance from defenders holding entrenchments in the sand hills to the northwest of the town. Closest to the Mediterranean coast, the 7th Light Horse Regiment (2nd Light Horse Brigade) met considerable opposition, but was eventually able to advance close up to the town.Powles 1922, p. 93 Position at about 18:00 By 18:00, the position of the attacking force was most satisfactory, and by 18:30 the whole position had been captured, while the defenders were retreating into the town centre. The Wellington Mounted Rifle Regiment and the 2nd Light Horse Brigade were well into the northern outskirts of the town. Units of the 158th (North Wales) Brigade (53rd Division) and the Canterbury Mounted Rifle Regiment held Ali Muntar, the 159th (Cheshire) Brigade's right was holding trenches on Clay Hill, while its left was south of the town holding the Gaza to Beersheba road. The 161st (Essex) Brigade (54th Division) held Green Hill and the 160th (Welsh Border) Brigade (53rd Division) was holding a position to the north of the Labyrinth. By nightfall this combined force was consolidating its captured positions. Only on the western side of Gaza in the sand hills had the attack not been completely successful.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 303 Mounted screen attacked Position of the mounted screen (in red) and hostile forces (in green) at 18:00 At 14:20 Hodgson ordered his Imperial Mounted Division to move north and take over the Anzac Mounted Division's outpost positions. The 6th Mounted Brigade was to move to the east of Beit Durdis, while the 5th Mounted Brigade, currently astride the Gaza to Beersheba road, was to \\"fill the gap between it and the Camel Brigade,\\" which had orders to move to Kh er Reseim. Owing to a delay in the Camel Brigade receiving its orders, this relief was not completed until two hours later, after 18:30 when the 5th Mounted Brigade moved north.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 pp. 299‚Äì300 Meanwhile, the Ottoman Fourth Army's 3rd and 16th Infantry Divisions prepared to launch a counterattack by 1,000 men advancing towards Gaza.Erickson 2007 p. 99 The two divisions were expected to be in action before dark, but the EEF cavalry and armoured cars were able to stop their advance before they were halfway from Tel esh Sheria to Gaza. Kress von Kressenstein did not persist with the attack but ordered a renewal of their attacks at dawn.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 pp. 321‚Äì2 note About 300 of these reinforcements had been seen at 15:50 (ten minutes after the combined attack on Gaza began) marching towards the town from the north. A little later three more columns were reported moving in the same direction, while another 300 soldiers had moved into the sand hills west of Deir Sineid, to the north of Gaza. A squadron from the 22nd Mounted Yeomanry Brigade was sent to oppose these forces. From the east, units of the Ottoman Army had first been reported at 14:20, advancing from the direction of Jemmameh (east of Huj).Anzac Mounted Division War Diary March 1917 AWM4-1-60-13 Appendix 54 p. 4 14:20 When they were about from Beit Durdis, they attacked the Desert Column outposts holding Hill 405. Two squadrons and one troop of Berkshire Yeomanry (6th Mounted Brigade) defended the front. They reported being attacked by infantry, mounted troops, and some machine gun crews. Hodgson ordered the remainder of brigade, supported by the Berkshire Battery RHA, to reinforce this outpost front line. However, the remainder of the 6th Mounted Brigade was in the process of watering and could not start at once. The delay allowed the Ottoman force to capture the crest of Hill 405 at 17:15.Anzac Mounted Division War Diary March 1917 AWM4-1-60-13 Appendix 54 p. 5Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 300 At 17:00, Hodgson commanding the mounted screen, asked Chauvel commanding the mounted attack on Gaza, for reinforcements. Chauvel sent back the 8th and 9th Light Horse Regiments (3rd Light Horse Brigade), commanded by Brigadier General J. R. Royston. They moved back quickly under Royston's command to capture a high hill northwest of Hill 405, which enabled the units of the Berkshire Yeomanry (6th Mounted Brigade) to hold their position. The 8th and 9th Light Horse Regiments (3rd Light Horse Brigade) with the 1/1st Queen's Own Dorset Yeomanry (6th Mounted Brigade) held the line, while the 1/1st Nottinghamshire Royal Horse Artillery and the Berkshire Battery enfiladed the advancing hostile formations. Six hostile guns in their firing line, returned fire. When three additional hostile batteries were brought forward, they enfiladed the Berkshire Battery, forcing it to withdraw at about 18:30, just before dusk. After his divisional headquarters moved north, during his take over of the mounted screen, Hodgson discovered that he had lost contact with the 5th Mounted Brigade. It was nearly dark when, at 17:30, a gap occurred in the line between the 6th Mounted Brigade and Imperial Camel Brigade at Kh er Reseim. Fortunately, hostile soldiers did not attempt to investigate the area before Chauvel sent back his last divisional reserve, the 10th Light Horse Regiment (3rd Light Horse Brigade), to fill the gap. In the growing darkness the light horse regiment succeeded in reaching its position. The No. 7 Light Car Patrol was sent to reinforce units holding off Ottoman reinforcements advancing from Deir Sineid at 17:15. They strengthened the original two squadrons of the 6th Light Horse Regiment (2nd Light Horse Brigade) which held the main road to the north of Gaza. They had been joined by a squadron of the 22nd Mounted Brigade and two more squadrons of the 6th Light Horse Regiment. The Nos. 11 and 12 Light Armoured Motor Batteries (LAMB) also reinforced the mounted screen holding off, about 4,000 Ottoman soldiers advancing from the direction of Huj and Jemmameh. These Ottoman Army units were reported to be 3,000 infantry and two squadrons of cavalry. The LAMBs reported to Royston and engaged the Ottoman Army until dark.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 pp. 300‚Äì1 Withdrawal of mounted divisions Positions at 18:30 on 26 March 1917 During the battle the serious pressure from Ottoman forces advancing to relieve Gaza from the east had been expected and had begun to make an impact since 16:00. However, in view of the late start to the battle and the threat from these reinforcements, Dobell, the commander of Eastern Force, after talking with Chetwode, the commander of Desert Column, decided that unless Gaza was captured by nightfall, the fighting must stop and the mounted force withdrawn.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 305It is claimed that the need to water the horses was \\"constantly on their minds.\\" The horses had been watered as they crossed the Wadi Ghuzzee and small quantities had been found by the mounted divisions and reported to headquarters during the day.[Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 305] By dusk, some of the strong Ottoman Army trenches and redoubts defending Gaza, remained in their control. The British had fired some 304 shells and 150,000 rounds of small arms ammunition, while their infantry casualties were substantial.Anzac Mounted Division War Diary March 1917 AWM4-1-60-13 Appendix 54 p. 6 On the day of battle, 26 March 1917, the sun set at 18:00 (Cairo time). This occurred before Desert Column knew of the capture of Ali Muntar.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 307 Therefore, with the approval of Dobell, at 18:10 Chetwode commanding Desert Column, ordered Chauvel to withdraw the mounted force and retire across the Wadi Ghuzzeh. As these orders were being dispatched, a report came in from Dallas that Ali Muntar had been captured, but this information did not change Chetwode's mind. It was not until some time later that he was informed of the capture of the entire ridge. Chetwode's orders were to break off the action after dark and withdraw.Anzac Mounted Division War Diary March 1917 AWM4-1-60-13 Appendix 54 p. 5 18:10 According to Christopher Pugsley, the Anzac Mounted Division \\"saw victory snatched away from them by the order to withdraw.\\"The Australian history claims Chauvel protested strongly. [Gullett 1941 p. 282] While the British history notes no written record of Chauvel's protest is \\"on the record.\\" [Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 307 note] This decision to withdraw was puzzling to many of those fighting in and near the town, as the infantry held Ali Muntar and 462 German and Ottoman army prisoners, including a general who was a divisional commander. They had also captured an Austrian battery of two Krupp 77mm field guns, along with a complete convoy.McPherson et. al, 1985, pp. 171‚Äì2 However, the whole attacking force was withdrawn to Deir el Belah and Khan Yunus on 27 and 28 March.Downes 1938, p. 620 The first units to withdraw were the slow moving wheels and camels, which received their orders at 17:00 from Desert Column. They move back to Hill 310 via Sheikh Abbas. With the Imperial Mounted Division, remaining in position to cover the retirement of the Anzac Mounted Division, the withdrawal of the fighting mounted units was slow and difficult, not because of hostile pressure (there was none until dawn), but because the units were intermixed and the dismounted troops were far from their horses. One unit, the 7th Light Horse Regiment (2nd Light Horse Brigade) was nearly from their horses and all their wounded had not yet been collected. The No. 7 Light Car Patrol reported to the headquarters of the Anzac Mounted Division at 18:40 and was ordered to return to base, while the cars of the Nos. 11 and 12 LAMB, camped in the vicinity of Kh er Reseim. At 19:05 Anzac Mounted Division's artillery began its retirement from divisional headquarters under escort, and the 43 wounded from the Anzac Mounted Division and 37 wounded from Imperial Mounted Division were collected and brought to the ambulances, while prisoners were sent back under escort. By 19:30 the 22nd Mounted Brigade was moving toward Divisional Headquarters and the 6th Mounted Brigade withdrew while Ottoman soldiers dug in on Hill 405.Powles 1922, pp. 93‚Äì4 At about midnight the Anzac Mounted Division was clear of the battlefield, while the Imperial Mounted Division, with the assistance of the Imperial Camel Brigade and armoured motor cars, held off the Ottoman reinforcements.Powles 1922, p. 94 At 02:00 when the guns of Anzac Mounted Division had reached Dier el Belah and the division was just passed Beit Dundis, Hodgson gave orders for the concentration of the Imperial Mounted Division's 3rd Light Horse, 5th, and 6th Mounted Brigades, while the Imperial Camel Brigade took up a line from the Wadi Guzzeh to the left of the 54th (East Anglian) Division's headquarters.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 308Anzac Mounted Division War Diary March 1917 AWM4-1-60-13 Appendix 54 pp. 5‚Äì6 At 04:30, the cars in the Nos. 11 and 12 LAMB broke camp near Kh er Reseim, and as they moved southwards encountered opposition from Ottoman Army units. After two hours of stiff fighting they managed to retire, while at 04:50 the No. 7 Light Car Patrol was moving along the Gaza to Beersheba road. It was not until 05:30 that an Ottoman attack in strength fell on the rear of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade (Imperial Mounted Division) just as the brigade was crossing the Gaza- Beersheba road near Kh Sihan. The No. 7 Light Car Patrol gave very effective support to the brigade, and together with the light horsemen, became heavily engaged, fighting the Ottoman Army advancing from Huj. The advancing reinforcements were stopped, and the light cars covered the 3rd Light Horse Brigade's retirement back to the Imperial Camel Brigade's position, at 07:00 on the morning of 27 March 1917.Lieutenant McKenzie commander of No. 7 Light Car Patrol gives a description of making full use of the patrol's capabilities during their retirement. [Gullett 1941 pp. 288‚Äì9 and Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 308] Withdrawal of infantry At 17:38 Dobell commanding Eastern Force, ordered the 54th (East Anglian) Division to move to the west to Burjabye Ridge, and informed Desert Column. An hour later, at 18:35 (25 minutes after Chetwode ordered Chauvel to withdraw), Dobell informed Desert Column and the 54th (East Anglian) Division \\"that he contemplated withdrawing the whole force across the Wadi Ghazze if Gaza did not shortly fall.\\"Falls 1930 Vol. 1 pp. 307, 309 There have been claims that the infantry were the first to retire and that, due to a communications breakdown, the 53rd (Welsh) Division made a complete and premature retirement.Powles 1922, pp. 94‚Äì5Bruce 2002, p. 97 However, that infantry division had not been told of the movement of the 54th (East Anglian) Division and was still in position. It was not until just before 19:00 that Chetwode phoned Dallas, commander of the 53rd (Welsh) Division, to inform him of the withdrawal of the mounted troops, and the need for him to move his right to reestablish contact with the 54th (East Anglian) Division. Dallas was under the impression that he was to move back to Sheikh Abbas, from his right on Clay Hill, while Chetwode meant that the two divisions would reconnect north of Mansura and not much over from the 161st (Essex) Brigade, 54th (East Anglian) Division, at Green Hill. Dallas protested, instead asking for reinforcements to close the gap between the two divisions. This request was denied and when he prevaricated, asking for time to consider the order, Chetwode gave him the verbal order, believing the 53rd (Welsh) Division was moving its right back to gain touch with the 54th (East Anglian) Division near Mansura. Falls notes that according to Dallas \\"he had explained on the telephone the full extent of his withdrawal to General Chetwode; the latter states that he did not understand his subordinate to mean that he was abandoning anything like so much ground. In any case the responsibility rests upon Desert Column Headquarters, since General Dallas had telegraphed to it the line he was taking up.\\"Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 311 note As late as 21:12, the 53rd (Welsh) Division still held Ali Muntar, at which time they advised Desert Column they would have to evacuate towards Sheikh Abbas, to conform with a withdrawal occurring on their right. At 22:30 Dallas, commander of the 53rd (Welsh) Division, issued orders for the whole of his force to withdraw to a line which stretched from the caves at Tell el Ujul, near the Wadi Ghuzzeh on the left through a point north of Esh Sheluf, and on to Mansura and Sheikh Abbas involving a retirement of on the Es Sire Ridge and between Clay Hill and Mansura. He informed Desert Column of this move.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 311 By 23:00, Dobell commanding Eastern Force, had become aware of the extent of the 53rd (Welsh) Division's successes. He also received intercepted wireless messages, which had been unduly delayed, between Kress von Kressenstein at Tel esh Sheria and Major Tiller, the German officer commanding the Gaza garrison, indicating the desperate situation of the garrison. Dobell immediately ordered Chetwode and Dallas to dig in on their present line, connecting his right with the 54th (East Anglian) Division.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 pp. 309‚Äì10 =Reoccupations and retreats= It was nearly midnight when Dallas commanding 53rd (Welsh) Division, discovered the 54th (East Anglian) Division was moving towards the north of Mansura ‚Äì had he known of this move at the time, he would not have abandoned all of the captured positions. At 05:00 on 27 March, when Chetwode learned that the 53rd (Welsh) Division had abandoned its entire position, and he ordered them back to Ali Muntar. Dallas ordered the 160th (Welsh Border) Brigade (53rd Division) and 161st (Essex) Brigades (54th Division) to push forward with strong patrols to the positions they had held on the previous evening. Both Green Hill and Ali Muntar were found to be unoccupied and one company of the 1/7th Battalion Essex Regiment, (161st Brigade) reoccupied Ali Muntar, while two companies of the same battalion reoccupied Green Hill. After the 2nd Battalion of the 10th Middlesex Regiment (160th Brigade) had pushed forward patrols beyond Sheluf, the 2nd Battalion of the 4th Royal West Surrey or 4th Royal West Kent Regiment (160th Brigade) was ordered to advance and \\"gain touch\\" with the 161st Brigade. However, as the battalion advanced in artillery formation, they could see the 161st Brigade to the northeast \\"falling back.\\" Meanwhile the 1/1st Battalion, Herefordshire Regiment (158th Brigade, 53rd Division) had also been ordered to reoccupy their brigade's position and was advancing, when they too saw the 161st Brigade withdrawing.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 pp. 311‚Äì2Burrows, pp. 143‚Äì70. After dawn on 27 March the first Ottoman counterattacks recaptured Ali Muntar and a portion of Green Hill, but the 1/7th Battalion of the Essex Regiment, (161st Brigade, 54th Division), retook the positions before consolidating and re- establishing their posts. Meanwhile the Ottoman force, which had attacked the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, appeared on Sheikh Abbas and shelled the rear of Dallas' position, \\"including his reserves, medical units and transport camels,\\" but made no serious attack on the 54th (East Anglian) Division holding Burjabye Ridge.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 pp. 312‚Äì3 The hostile artillery batteries at Sheikh Abbas targeted all the tracks across the Wadi Ghuzzeh, employed by the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps, who were at the time attempting to supply food, water and ammunition, to the forward units.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 314 At 08:00 the 53rd (Welsh) Division came under orders of Eastern Force, and Dobell received an appreciation from Dallas at 09:15. This stated that if the present positions of the 53rd (Welsh) and 54th (East Anglian) Divisions were to be maintained, the German and Ottoman occupation of Sheikh Abbas must be ended. This was confirmed by G. P. Dawnay, Brigadier General General Staff (BGGS), Eastern Force. Dallas suggested Sheikh Abbas might best be recaptured by Desert Column, as the 52nd (Lowland) Division was too far away.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 313 However, by 08:10 the Imperial Mounted Division had arrived back at Deir el Belah and the Anzac Mounted Division was marching via Abu Thirig past Hill 310 where Chauvel met Chetwode. Chetwode ordered the horses of both divisions to water and return to a position near El Dameita to support an attempt by the infantry to retake Ali Muntar. At 08:30 when the Anzac Mounted Division also arrived back at Deir el Belah, Chetwode took over command of the two mounted divisions from Chauvel. The Anzac Mounted Division returned to take up a position near El Dameita which it held until 16:00, while the 54th (East Anglian) Division remained near Sheikh Abbas engaging the advancing Ottoman units from Beersheba. Ali Muntar, which had been held by two battalions of the Essex Regiment (54th Division), was strongly attacked, and at 09:30 the British infantry were forced to withdraw, having suffered severe losses. They fell back to Green Hill where they were almost surrounded, but managed to withdraw to a line south of Ali Muntar halfway between that hill and Sheluf. After first advising Murray, at 16:30 Dobell issued orders for the withdrawal to the left bank of the Wadi Ghuzzeh of the 53rd (Welsh) and the 54th (East Anglian) Divisions under the command of Dallas. This retirement, which began at 19:00, was completed without interference from the Ottoman Army. An aerial reconnaissance on the morning of 28 March reported that no Ottoman units were within range of the British guns.Cutlack 1941, pp. 59‚Äì60 No large scale attacks were launched by either side, but very active aircraft bombings and artillery duels continued for a time.McPherson 1985 p. 173 Casualties British prisoners guarded by Ottoman forces after the battle British casualties amounted to 4,000; 523 killed, 2932 wounded and over 512 missing, including five officers and 241 other ranks known to be prisoners. These were mainly from the 53rd (Welsh) Division and the 161st (Essex) Brigade of the 54th (East Anglian) Division. The Ottoman Army forces suffered a total of 2,447 casualties. Of these, 16 Germans and Austrians were killed or wounded, 41 being reported missing, and 1,370 Ottoman soldiers were killed or wounded with 1,020 missing.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 pp. 315, 322 According to Cemal Pasha, Ottoman losses amounted to less than 300 men killed, 750 wounded, and 600 missing.Erickson 2001, p. 161. The Anzac Mounted Division suffered six killed, 43 or 46 wounded, and two missing, while the Imperial Mounted Division suffered 37 casualties. Aftermath Both Murray and Dobell portrayed the battle as a success, Murray sending the following message to the War Office on 28 March: \\"We have advanced our troops a distance of fifteen miles from Rafa to the Wadi Ghuzzee, five miles west of Gaza, to cover the construction of the railway. On the 26th and 27th we were heavily engaged east of Gaza with a force of about 20,000 of the enemy. We inflicted very heavy losses upon him ... All troops behaved splendidly.\\"Keogh 1955, p. 102 And Dobell wrote, The British press reported the battle as a success, but an Ottoman plane dropped a message that said, \\"You beat us at communiqu√©s, but we beat you at Gaza.\\"Moore 1920, p.67 Dallas, the commander of the 53rd (Welsh) Division, resigned after the battle, owing to a \\"breakdown in health.\\"Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 332 note Judged by Western Front standards, the defeat was small and not very costly. Murray's offensive power had not been greatly affected and preparations for a renewal of the offensive were quickly begun. The Second Battle of Gaza began on 17 April 1917.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 pp. 320, 326‚Äì350 A report in the Daily Telegraph said on 26 March that British troops were severely delayed until early afternoon by a dense morning fog, during which delay they drank much of their water rations, leaving the men short of water; and that the main aim was to seize the Wadi Ghuzzeh to cover the advance of a supply railway which the British were building.Daily Telegraph, Tuesday 3 April 1917, reprinted in Daily Telegraph, Monday 3 April 2017, page 24 Notes ;Footnotes ;Citations References          Further reading * Category:Conflicts in 1917 Category:1917 in the Ottoman Empire Category:Battles of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign Gaza, 1st Gaza, 1st Gaza, 1st Gaza, 1st Gaza, 1st Gaza, 1st Category:History of the Royal Air Force during World War I Category:March 1917 events Category:History of Gaza City ","title":"First Battle of Gaza"},{"id":"458231","text":"The following is a list of rivers and creeks in Iowa.

National Hydrography Dataset high- resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed May 26, 2011 The largest river flowing across the state of Iowa, it rises in southern Minnesota and flows across Iowa from northwest to southeast, passing from the glaciated plains into the unglaciated hills near the capital city of Des Moines, named after the river, in the center of the state. The river continues to flow at a southeastern direction away from Des Moines, later flowing directly into the Mississippi River. The Des Moines River forms a short portion of Iowa's border with Missouri in Lee County. The Avenue of the Saints, a four-lane highway from St. Paul, Minnesota to St. Louis, Missouri, passes over this section; the highway is designated Route 27 in both Iowa and Missouri, and was completed in the early 21st century. Hydrography The Des Moines River rises in two forks. The West Fork (the main branch) rises out of Lake Shetek in Murray County in southwestern Minnesota. It flows south-southeast into Emmet County, Iowa, past Estherville. The East Fork rises out of Okamanpeedan Lake in northern Emmet County on the Iowa-Minnesota border and flows south, through Algona. The two forks join in southern Humboldt County, approximately 5 miles (8 km) south of Humboldt at Frank Gotch State Park. The combined stream flows roughly southward through Fort Dodge. South of Boone it passes through the Ledges State Park. It flows through downtown Des Moines, then turns generally southeastward, flowing through Ottumwa. It forms approximately 20 miles (32 km) of the border between Iowa and Missouri before joining the Mississippi from the northwest at Keokuk. It receives the Boone River from the northeast approximately 20 miles (32 km) southwest of Fort Dodge. It receives the Raccoon River from the west in the city of Des Moines. Above the city of Des Moines, it is impounded to create the Saylorville Lake reservoir. About midway below Saylorville and above Ottumwa, near Pella, the river is impounded to create the Lake Red Rock reservoir. History The Des Moines as it was depicted in 1718 by Guillaume Delisle; modern Iowa highlighted. One of the earliest French maps that depicts the Des Moines (1703) refers to it as \\"R. des Otentas,\\" which translates to \\"River of the Otoe\\"; the Otoe Tribe lived in the interior of Iowa in the 18th century.Lahontan, Louis Armand de Lom d'Arce (1703) Carte de la Riviere Longue: et de Quelques Autres, qui se Dechargent dans le Grand Fleuve de Mississippi. La Haye, Netherlands. On file, Library of Congress Geography and Map Division Washington. The Meskwaki and Sauk people referred to the river as \\"Ke-o-shaw-qua\\" (Hermit's River), from which Keosauqua, Iowa, derives its name.Isaac Galland, 1840, Galland's Iowa Emigrant: containing a map, and general descriptions of Iowa, pp. 6-7. The Dakota Indians, who lived near its headwaters in present-day Minnesota, referred to it as \\"Inyan Shasha\\" in their Siouan language. Another Siouan name was \\"Eah-sha-wa-pa-ta,\\" or \\"Red Stone\\" river, possibly referring the bluffs at Red Rock or the reddish Sioux Quartzite bedrock near its headwaters. The origin of the name Des Moines is obscure. Early French explorers named it La Rivi√®re des Moines, literally meaning \\"River of the Monks.\\" The name may have referred to early Trappist monks who built huts near the mouth of the river at the Mississippi. William Bright writes that Moines was an abbreviation used by the French for Moingouena or Moingona, an Algonquian subgroup of the Illinois people. The Native American term was /mooyiinkweena/, a derogatory name applied to the Moingouena by the Peoria people, a closely related subgroup. The meaning of the native word, according to an early French writer, is visage plein d'ordure, or in plain English, \\"shit-face\\", from mooy-, \\"shit\\", -iinkwee, \\"face\\", and -na, \\"indefinite actor\\". The 1718 Guillaume Delisle map (pictured) labels it as \\"le Moingona R.\\" During the mid-19th century, the river supported the main commercial transportation by water across Iowa. River traffic began to be superseded by the railroads constructed from the 1860s. The Des Moines River, as it flows through downtown Des Moines, west bank, during spring high water; note the old watermarks on the flood wall. Flooding The river has a history of seasonal flooding. For example, in May 1944 the Riverview Park had just opened for the season on May 19, 1944. At around dawn on May 23, the levee began to collapse. The river was too much to hold back. Quickly the breach in the levee grew to nearly wide, and the river water quickly enveloped all of the park and the surrounding area.Riverview Park Flood The Great Flood of 1993 on the river and its tributary the Raccoon, in the summer of 1993, forced the evacuation of much of the city of Des Moines and nearby communities. In another period of flooding, on June 13, 2008, officials issued a voluntary evacuation order for much of downtown and other areas bordering the Des Moines River. The river had reached flood stage in many locations, and Mayor Frank Cownie said the evacuations were an attempt \\"to err on the side of citizens and residents.\\" Cities and towns *Algona, Iowa (East Fork) *Armstrong, Iowa (East Fork) *Bonaparte, Iowa *Bradgate, Iowa (West Fork) *Chillicothe, Iowa *Currie, Minnesota *Dakota City, Iowa (East Fork) *Des Moines, Iowa *Douds, Iowa *Eddyville, Iowa *Eldon, Iowa *Emmetsburg, Iowa (West Fork) *Estherville, Iowa (West Fork) *Farmington, Iowa *Fort Dodge, Iowa *Fraser, Iowa *Graettinger, Iowa (West Fork) *Humboldt, Iowa (West Fork) *Irvington, Iowa (East Fork) *Jackson, Minnesota *Johnston, Iowa *Keokuk, Iowa *Keosauqua, Iowa *Leando, Iowa *Lehigh, Iowa *Livermore, Iowa (East Fork) *Ottumwa, Iowa *Petersburg, Minnesota (West Fork) *Rutland, Iowa (West Fork) *St. Joseph, Iowa (East Fork) *Windom, Minnesota West Fork Des Moines River at Humboldt Variant names According to the Geographic Names Information System, the Des Moines River has also been known as: *La Riviere des Moins *Le Moine River *Monk River *Nadouessioux River *Outontantes River *River Demoin *River of the Maskoutens *River of the Peouareas See also *List of Iowa rivers *List of longest rivers of the United States (by main stem) *List of Minnesota rivers *List of Missouri rivers *Illinois Country *French colonization of the Americas References and notesExternal links *Des Moines History *DesMoinesRiver.org *U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: Des Moines River Basin Category:Rivers of Iowa Category:Rivers of Minnesota Category:Rivers of Missouri Category:Tributaries of the Mississippi River Category:Borders of Iowa Category:Borders of Missouri Category:Rivers of Cottonwood County, Minnesota Category:Bodies of water of Lee County, Iowa Category:Rivers of Murray County, Minnesota Category:Bodies of water of Emmet County, Iowa Category:Bodies of water of Kossuth County, Iowa Category:Bodies of water of Humboldt County, Iowa Category:Rivers of Webster County, Iowa Category:Bodies of water of Boone County, Iowa Category:Bodies of water of Wapello County, Iowa Category:Rivers of Clark County, Missouri ","title":"Des Moines River"},{"id":"458248","text":"This is a list of companies named after people.

Geography The Skunk River rises in two branches, the South Skunk ( long) and the North Skunk ( long).U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed May 13, 2011 The headwaters of the South Skunk are in Hamilton County in north central Iowa. It flows roughly due southward, to the west of Interstate 35, and passes through the city of Ames, before turning southeasterly. In Keokuk County, it is joined by the North Skunk, which has its headwaters in Marshall County. It then proceeds southeastward and flows into the Mississippi about five miles south of the city of Burlington. Etymology The Sauk and Meskwaki referred to the Skunk River as \\"Shecaqua\\".Isaac Galland, 1840, Galland's Iowa emigrant: containing a map, and general descriptions of Iowa. This name was probably mistranslated; one early settler wrote, \\"I was informed by Frank Labisner, United States interpreter for the Sac and Fox Indians, that the name of Skunk River was a wrong interpretation. The Indian name was Checaqua. Which, in their language is anything of a strong or obnoxious smell, such as onions. I think, that from the fact that the head waters of the stream abounded with wild onions, the interpretation should be 'Onion.'\\"J. C. Parrott's letter p. 48 in History of Des Moines County, Iowa., by A.M. Antrobus (1915) Habitat Species of fish found in the Skunk River include smallmouth bass, gar, walleye, catfish, carp, bluegill, sheephead, bullhead, and largemouth bass,crappie,sunfish. The \\"Skunk River Navy\\" was founded and led by Iowa State University biology professor 'Admiral' Jim Colbert and biology advisor 'Admiral' Jim Holtz. The SRN operated from August 1998 to September 2017. The SRN focused on monitoring the biological diversity of the South Skunk River, and some of its tributaries, near Ames, Iowa as well as removal of trash from these streams. Participation in the SRN was primarily focused on students entering Iowa State in the biology major, though students in other majors, other ISU personnel, as well as other individuals participated. During the years of operation of the SRN approximately 2,400 volunteers participated and over 80 tons of trash were removed from the South Skunk River and some of its tributaries. The SRN also found, and reported, diesel fuel and sewage leaks into the South Skunk River, and its tributary Squaw Creek, respectively. These leaks were repaired by the City of Ames. Beginning in 2018 local paddling groups may use the name \\"Skunk River Navy\\", but the SRN is no longer under the auspices of the ISU Biology Program.

J'ouvert is likely a gallicization of jou ouv√® (), the Antillean Creole French term meaning \\"dawn\\" or \\"daybreak\\", as this is the time at which the festival is typically held. History J'ouvert is celebrated in many countries throughout the Caribbean. J'ouvert is also celebrated in many places outside the Caribbean as part of Carnival celebrations throughout the year, with the biggest celebrations happening in places around the world with large Caribbean ex-pat communities. Traditionally, the celebration involves calypso/soca bands and their followers dancing through the streets. The festival starts well before dawn and peaks a few hours after sunrise. Carnival was introduced to Trinidad by French settlers in 1783, a time of slavery. Banned from the masquerade balls of the French, the enslaved people would stage their own mini-carnivals in their backyards ‚Äî using their own rituals and folklore, but also imitating and sometimes mocking their masters' behavior at the masquerade balls. The origins of street parties associated with J'ouvert coincide with the emancipation from slavery in 1838. Emancipation provided Africans with the opportunity not only to participate in Carnival, but to embrace it as an expression of their newfound freedom. Some theorize that some J'ouvert traditions are carried forward in remembrance of civil disturbances in Port of Spain, Trinidad, when the people smeared themselves with oil or paint to avoid being recognized. The traditions of J'ouvert vary widely throughout the Caribbean. In Trinidad and Tobago and Grenada, a part of the tradition involves smearing paint, mud or oil on the bodies of participants known as \\"Jab Jabs\\". In other countries, J'ouvert is celebrated on the first day of August (Emanicipation Day), and yet for other West Indian countries J'ouvert is observed the night before the daytime \\"Pretty Mas\\" parade. Pretty Mas, a bright and festive version of the celebration, features colorful feathers and beaded costumes and is more popular and commercially publicized. J'ouvert values the transgressive dirt, while Pretty Mas celebrates the transcendent glitter. J'ouvert can further be contrasted with Pretty Mas such that J'ouvert is said to be for \\"the people\\" while Pretty Mas is intended for the establishment.  In popular culture  \\"J'OUVERT\\" is the title of the 10th track of Brockhampton's 4th studio album, iridescence.

The coat of arms consists of the central emblem surrounded by coffee (Coffea arabica, at the left) and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum, at the right) branches, which were important crops in Brazil at that time. In the blue circle in the center, the Southern Cross () can be seen. The ring of 27 stars around it represents Brazil's 26 states and the Federal District. The blue ribbon contains the official name of Brazil (Rep√∫blica Federativa do Brasil ‚Äî Federative Republic of Brazil) in its first line. Prior to 1964, this line contained the previous official name, Estados Unidos do Brasil ‚Äî United States of Brazil. In the second line, the date of the federative republic's establishment (15 November 1889) is written. National arms The National Arms of the Republic were instituted by Decree No. 4, with alteration made by Law No. 5443 of 28 May 1968 (Annex No. 8) The making of the National Arms should conform to the proportions of 15 units of height by 14 of width and take into account the following provisions: *I - The round shield will be composed of a sky-blue [azul-celeste] field containing five silver [prata] stars arranged in the form of the Southern Cross, with the bordure [bordura] of the field outlined in gold and charged with silver stars equal to the stars existing in the National Flag (Modification made by Law No. 8421 of 11 May 1972). *II - The shield will be placed on a star parted gyronny of ten pieces, green [sinopla] and gold, bordered by two strips, the inner red [goles] and the outer gold. *III - All placed on a sword in pale, pommelled gold, hilted blue [blau], except for the center part, which is red [goles] and contains a silver star, all upon a crown formed by a branch of coffee fruited on the dexter side and another of flowering tobacco on the sinister side, both in proper colors, tied blue [blau], the whole assembled on a splendor of gold, the contours of which form a star of 20 points. Arms of the Empire of Brazil The Arms of the Empire of Brazil were used by both Emperors Pedro I and Pedro II until the downfall of the monarchy in 1889. These arms (with modifications) are used by the present imperial house. On 18 September 1822, eleven days after proclaiming Brazil's independence Royal Prince Dom Pedro signed a decree instituting these arms stating \\"... henceforth the arms of this Empire of Brazil will be, on a green field, a gold armillary sphere superimposed on a Portuguese cross, the sphere encircled by 19 silver stars on a blue circle; and an imperial crown with diamonds set atop the shield, the sides of which will be embraced by two plants of coffee and tobacco, as emblems of its [the Empire's] riches, in their proper colors and tied at the bottom with the national bow-knot.\\"Vianna, H√©lio.

On the latter date, when Brazil's second emperor, Pedro II was crowned, using a new richer crown that was manufactured for him, the design of such Crown replaced the image of the older diadem in the coat of arms, and remained in use until the downfall of the Empire. That is the best- known version of the imperial coat of arms of Brazil.

It is about longU.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed May 13, 2011 and is open to small river craft to Iowa City, about from its mouth. Its major tributary is the Cedar River. Course It rises in two branches, the West Branch and East Branch, both of which have their headwaters in Hancock County, each about long and which join in Belmond. The Iowa then proceeds roughly in a southeast direction, passing through the city of Iowa Falls, through a scenic valley to Steamboat Rock, then through the cities of Eldora, Marshalltown, Tama, and Marengo, and through the Amana Colonies in Iowa County. In Johnson County, it becomes impounded by the Coralville Dam in the Coralville Reservoir, which turns southward to the spillway. The river runs generally south and passes through Iowa City and the University of Iowa campus. A lowhead dam at Burlington Street in Iowa City is the last dam before the river's confluence with the Mississippi. South of Iowa City, it is joined in Washington County by the English River, and then in Louisa County it is joined by the Cedar River to flow into the Mississippi. Uses The Iowa River is noted for recreational and commercial fishing. Game fish include largemouth and smallmouth bass, walleye, northern pike, channel and flathead catfish, crappie and other panfish. The Coralville Reservoir is commercially fished for carp and buffalo fish. Pine Lake State Park is located on the Iowa River at Eldora. Floods The Iowa can flood, notably in the June 2008 Midwest floods, and the Great Flood of 1993. The Cedar and its tributaries, including the Shell Rock River, can contribute to flooding events.

Uses in Brazilian and Portuguese cuisine Lingui√ßa, like many other sausages, is generally served as part of a heavy meal, typically accompanied by rice, beans, and other pork products. Feijoada, for example, is a traditional Portuguese and Brazilian dish (considered Brazil national dish), also common in Brazil and Angola, that incorporates lingui√ßa with beans, ham hocks, and other foods. In Brazil, one variant is specially popular, the lingui√ßa calabresa or simply calabresa, prepared originally with Calabrese pepper (nowadays with South American pepper) by Italian immigrants and particularly used in pizzas as a spicy sausage. Its popularity compares with pepperoni in the United States. It is common to differentiate the lingui√ßa calabresa from its counterpart lingui√ßa portuguesa, prepared from the original Portuguese recipe and also served in pizzas as mild sausage, generally with egg slices. Popularity and uses outside Portugal and Brazil Outside of continental Portugal, Azores Islands, Madeira Islands and Brazil, lingui√ßa is also popular in Goa, Macau, and other former Portuguese colonial possessions. In these regions it is typically sliced before being grilled or braised, often with a light-bodied beer. It‚Äôs popular in California, Rhode Island and southern Massachusetts. In Hawaii, McDonald's restaurants serve breakfasts featuring lingui√ßa. Hawaiian lingui√ßa, also known as Portuguese sausage, is usually smoked using banana leaves.

Sellotape is generally used for joining, sealing, attaching and mending. In much the same way that Scotch Tape came to be used in Canada and the United States when referring to any brand of clear adhesive tape, Sellotape has become a genericised trademark in Britain and a number of other countries where it is sold. Sellotape continued to be made in Borehamwood until the late 1960s/early 1970s. History Sellotape was originally manufactured in 1937 by Colin Kinninmonth and George Grey, in Acton, west London. The name was derived from cellophane, at that time a trademarked name, with the \\"C\\" changed to \\"S\\" so the new name could be trademarked. Sellotape was made at a factory in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire from 1930 to about 1950 when it moved to Welwyn Garden City or thereabouts. One of the factory designers was E.F. Peat, an architect working for E.S. & A. Robinson of Redcliffe Street in Bristol, who was ultimately given the job of factory manager. The range of tapes available in the 1950s and 1960s was immense compared with what is available now on the retail market, including RBT (reinforced banding tape), metallic tapes and a tape used for repairing PCBs; E.S. & A. Robinson were originally a packaging and paper products manufacturing company. In the 1960s, a small group of Wallington based chemists led by a man named Alan Robinson undertook a development of the stickiness in this product, and from the 1960s to 1980s, the Sellotape company was part of Dickinson Robinson Group, a British packaging and paper conglomerate. Sellotape Industrial was bought by Scapa Group plc in 1997, and their products continue to be manufactured at its factory in Dunstable. The Sellotape company was bought by Henkel Consumer Adhesives in 2002. Products Sellotape roll in a black dispenser. The Sellotape brand now covers a variety of tape products, and the word is frequently used to refer to other adhesive tapes in many countries due to its market exposure. As an example of a genericized trademark, it gained an entry in the Oxford English Dictionary in 1980https://www.henkel.co.uk/brands-and- businesses/sellotape-548424. Use The tape can be used to repair tears in paper, or to attach pieces of paper or cardboard together for modelling. On fragile paper surfaces the tape can only be used once, as removing it will either tear the paper or remove the top layer of rough cardboard; on smooth painted surfaces it can generally be removed without leaving any trace, though sometimes the adhesive can remain on the surface. It does not affix items to such surfaces permanently.

Once a vital cargo transportation hub, the canal has seen decreasing use since the mid-20th century, parallel with the decline of domestic waterborne shipping. It continues to be used for occasional movement of goods and daily navigation of small boats, tugs and barges. Connected to Gowanus Bay in Upper New York Bay, the Gowanus Canal borders the neighborhoods of Red Hook, Carroll Gardens, and Gowanus, all within South Brooklyn, to the west; Park Slope to the east; Boerum Hill and Cobble Hill to the north; and Sunset Park to the south. Seven bridges cross the canal, carrying Union Street, Carroll Street, Third Street, the New York City Subway's Culver Viaduct, Ninth Street, Hamilton Avenue, and the Gowanus Expressway from north to south. The canal arose in the mid-19th century from local tidal wetlands and freshwater streams. By the end of the 19th century, heavy industrial use had caused large amounts of pollutants to drain into the Gowanus Canal. Various attempts to remove the pollution or dilute the canal's water have failed. Even though most industrial tenants stopped using the Gowanus Canal in the middle of the 20th century, the pollution was never remedied. By the 1990s, it was recognized as one of the most polluted bodies of water in the United States. Owing to pollution with high ratios of fecal coliforms, deadly proportions of pathogens, and a low concentration of oxygen, it is generally seen as incompatible with marine life. A variety of extremophiles have been observed in the Gowanus Canal as well. Despite the canal's heavy pollution, its proximity to Manhattan and upper-class Brooklyn neighborhoods is attracting concerted waterfront redevelopment. This has restarted calls for environmental cleanup, and prompted concerns that adjacent waterfront economic development would be incompatible with environmental restoration and environmental risks. It was designated a Superfund site in 2009, and work to clean up the canal began in 2013. Course View of the canal from the Third Street Bridge in 2010 The Gowanus Canal begins at Butler Street in the neighborhood of Boerum Hill, in the northwestern part of Brooklyn. The wastewater pumping station at 201-234 Butler Street, a terracotta structure dating to 1911, is located north of the canal's head. The canal then runs in a south-southwest alignment parallel to the local street grid. Its course is located mid-block between Bond Street to the west and Nevins Street to the east. Along the way it passes bridges at Union Street, Carroll Street, and Third Street from south to north. While the Union Street and Third Street Bridges are movable bascule bridges, the Carroll Street Bridge is a retractable bridge that can be rolled diagonally to let ships through. The western bank of the Gowanus Canal hosts a boat launch at Second Street. The Second Street boat launch is located adjacent to a \\"Sponge Park\\", which absorbs pollutants from the western bank before they can go into the canal. At Fourth Street, the Fourth Street Basin splits off to the east, while the Gowanus Canal proper turns west. A walkway with seating, built as part of the construction of a Whole Foods Market, is located on the north bank of the 4th Street Basin. At Hoyt Street, two blocks west of Bond Street, the canal turns south with two extra tributaries at the east: one tributary at Seventh Street, and another near Sixth Street.For maps of the canal and adjacent properties, see:  Measurements are calculated using Google Maps. Shortly afterward, it crosses under the Ninth Street Bridge, a vertical-lift bridge opened in 1999. The New York City Subway's Culver Viaduct, a fixed-span viaduct, crosses above the Ninth Street Bridge. The viaduct contains the Smith‚ÄìNinth Streets station, which is partially located above the canal and is served by the . There is a short tributary to the east, about long, connecting to a Lowe's home-improvement store on that side. At this point, a walkway leads from Lowe's north to Ninth Street along the northern bank of the tributary and the eastern bank of the canal. Owing to its hidden location, the waterfront promenade has seen little use. At approximately 14th Street along the eastern bank, Hamilton Avenue and the Gowanus Expressway cross the canal at a diagonal from southeast to northwest, connecting to Lorraine Street on the western bank. Separate movable bascule bridges built in 1942 carry both directions of Hamilton Avenue's traffic, while the Gowanus Expressway rises on a viaduct far above the canal. The Gowanus Canal's mouth is at the Gowanus Bay, a portion of Upper New York Bay bordering western Brooklyn. The mouth is located near 19th Street on the eastern bank, or Bryant Street on the western bank. The canal takes a north- northeasterly course from this point, running east of Smith Street. An asphalt plant and marine transfer station are located on the canal's eastern bank, as well as a Home Depot and a FedEx Shipping Center. History=Early historyMill Creek= Map of Brooklyn in 1766, including Gowanus Creek The Gowanus neighborhood originally surrounded Gowanus Creek. It consisted of a tidal inlet of navigable creeks in original saltwater marshland and meadows that contained wildlife. The Dutch government issued the first land patents within Breukelen (modern-day Brooklyn), including the land of the Gowanus, from 1630 to 1664. In 1636, the leaders of New Netherland bought the area around the Gowanus Bay. In 1639, the inhabitants swapped land claims with each other to build a tobacco plantation. The area's early settlers named the waterway \\"Gowanes Creek\\" after Gouwane, sachem (chief) of the local Lenape tribe called the Canarsee, who farmed on the shores. Adam Brouwer, who had been a soldier in the service of the Dutch West India Company, built and operated the first tide-water gristmill patented in New York at Gowanus. The mill was located on land that was deeded on July 8, 1645, to Jan Evertse Bout. It was the first gristmill in the town of Breukelen and the first mill to operate in New Netherland. The mill was located north of Union Street, west of Nevins Street, and next to Bond Street. A second mill‚ÄîDenton's Mill, also called Yellow Mill‚Äîwas built on Denton's Mill Pond, after permission was granted to dredge from the creek to the mill pond once located between Fifth Avenue and the present-day canal at Carroll and Third Streets. On May 26, 1664, several Breuckelen residents, headed by Brouwer, petitioned Director General Peter Stuyvesant and his Council for permission to dredge a canal at their own expense through the land of Frederick Lubbertsen to supply water to run the mill. The petition was presented to the council on May 29, 1664, and the motion was granted. Another mill, Cole's Mill, was located just about at present day 9th Street, between Smith Street and the canal. Cole's Mill Pond, located north of 9th Street, occupied the present location of Public Place.Stiles, Henry R., A History of the City of Brooklyn: Including the old town and village of Brooklyn, the town of Bushwick, and the village and city of Williamsburgh\\". Brooklyn, N.Y.: Pub. by subscription, 1867-1870. July 5, 2005. =Farms and oyster fishing= In 1700, a settler named Nicholas Vechte built a farmhouse of brick and stone now known as the Old Stone House. In 1776, during the Battle of Long Island, American troops engaged British Army troops at the house enabling General George Washington to relocate his troops behind American lines. This house sat at the southeastern edge of the Denton's Mill pond. Brower's Mill, also known as Freeks Mill or Brouwer's Mill, was located at the present-day intersection of Union and Nevins Streets. It can be seen in drawings depicting the Battle of Brooklyn. Throughout this period, a few Dutch farmers settled along the marshland and engaged in clamming of large oysters that became a notable first export to Europe. The Gowanus Bay's tides pushed brackish water further into the creek, creating an environment where large bivalves thrived. In succeeding generations, negative artificial selection slowly reduced the size of the bivalves, since smaller bivalves were better adapted to the creek's water. Larger bivalves were less likely to survive, and thus, less likely to reproduce. In 1774 the Government of New York enacted a law to widen the creek into a canal, to keep the watercourse in good condition, and to levy taxes on people who used land near it. Industrial useTransformation to city= By the mid-19th century, the City of Brooklyn was quickly growing and was the United States' third-largest city. The creek and surrounding agricultural land was now part of an urban agglomeration, consisting of villages along the creek's shores. That same shoreline of river and swamp functioned as both a transportation system and an informal sewage system for the growing city. The valley's watershed is approximately and includes drainage from what are now the adjacent neighborhoods of Carroll Gardens and Park Slope. Wealthier residents tended to live inland and uphill to avoid the smells and \\"discomforts\\" of lower areas. Industries, which needed water for processing, transport, and disposal of wastes, gravitated toward sites along the shoreline. The mills on the Gowanus were home to public landing sites, connecting the water route to the old Gowanus Road. As the local population grew, and the 19th-century industrial revolution reached Brooklyn, the need for larger navigational and docking facilities grew. Colonel Daniel Richards, a successful local merchant, advocated building a canal to benefit existing inland industries, and draining the surrounding marshes for land reclamation that would raise property values.New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, Carroll Gardens Historic District, 1973 In 1849, under a decree by the New York Legislature, the Gowanus Creek was deepened so it could be used as a commercial waterway connected to Upper New York Bay. The creek's dredging was completed in 1860. Another act of the Legislature in 1867 allowed the canal to be deepened further. In the same decade, a developer named Edwin Litchfield undertook a project to straighten the creek into a canal. At the time the , canal was built, several designs were proposed for it. Some included lock systems that would have allowed daily flushing of the whole waterway. However, these designs were considered too expensive. After exploring numerous alternative (and some more environmentally sound) designs, the final plan was chosen for its low cost. United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Major David Bates Douglass was hired to design the canal, which was essentially complete by 1869. The cost of the construction came from assessments on the local residents of Brooklyn and State money. =Industrial heyday and massive pollution= Sunset at Gowanus Bay in the Bay New York (1851) by Henry Gritten Despite its relatively short length, the Gowanus Canal was a hub for Brooklyn's maritime and commercial shipping activity. At its busiest, as many as 100 ships a day transported cargo through it. In addition, the industrial sector around the canal grew substantially over time to include stone and coal yards; flour mills; cement works, and manufactured gas plants; tanneries, factories for paint, ink, and soap; machine shops; chemical plants; and sulfur producers. All of these industries emitted substantial water and airborne pollutants. Chemical fertilizers were manufactured along the canal soon after the Civil War. Coal processing had been a dominant industry since 1869. By the late 19th century, there were 22 coal plants with frontage on the canal. Coal plants along the upper canal used large amounts of water in the conversion of coal to coke, liquids and gases. Coal gas was soon used for heating, light, and factory power. Coke was used to make steel. Wastewater and coal tar (now known to be a source of carcinogens) were dumped back into the canal. Brooklyn's slaughterhouses dumped blood and other wastes into the canals. There was no through-flow of water and the canal was open at only one end, in the hope that the tides would be enough to flush the waterway. But with the canal's wooden and concrete embankments, the strong tides of fresh diurnal doses of oxygenated water from New York Harbor were barred from flowing into the channel. With the high level of development in the Gowanus watershed area, excessive nitrates and pathogens are constantly flowing into the canal, further depleting the oxygen and creating breeding grounds for the pathogens responsible for the canal's odor. Water quality measures of the concentration of oxygen in the canal were just 1.5 ppm, well below the minimum 4 ppm needed to sustain life. The canal water took on a reddish-purple color, and a colloidal mixture described as \\"black mayonnaise\\" accumulated on its bottom. In 1887, the New York State Legislature closed the Bond Street outflow point. By 1889, pollution in the Gowanus Canal had become so bad that the Legislature appointed a commission to study ways to ameliorate the canal's condition. It concluded that the canal would be best off if it were closed to commercial traffic and then covered-over. The commission also called the canal \\"a disgrace to Brooklyn\\" because of the foul smells arising from the waterway. = Attempts to lessen pollution= The first step to ameliorate the canal's pollution was the 1890s construction of the Bond Street sewer pipeline that carried sewage out into the harbor. This proved inadequate. In the first attempt to improve flow at the northern, closed end of the canal, the \\"Big Sewer\\" was constructed from Marcy Avenue in Prospect Heights to Green and 4th Avenues in Gowanus. It then entered the canal at an inflow point near Butler Street. Scientific American featured this sewer design for its innovative construction method and size. The area the sewer ran through was known as the \\"Flooded District\\". It was believed that this new sewer would serve two purposes: to drain the flooded district, and to use the flow of that excessive water to move the water of the upper Gowanus Canal. The tunnel was completed by 1893, but Brooklyn residents complained their sewage outputs were not connected to the Big Sewer. The Brooklyn Daily Eagle initially hailed the sewer's size and extent. However, the newspaper declared it an \\"engineering blunder\\" in 1898, saying the Big Sewer caused sewage to go back into the Gowanus Canal, rather than its intended purpose of draining sewage from it. During the first decade of the 20th century, up to 700 structures were built in South Brooklyn every year. Thriving industry brought many new people to the area, but important questions about wastewater sanitation had not been properly addressed to handle such growth. All sewage from the new buildings drained downhill and into the Gowanus. Since there was less open ground than before, rainwater now went onto the roofs of the buildings and down into the canal. The building of new sewer connections only compounded the problem by discharging raw sewage from farther away neighborhoods into the canal. Pollutants, storm runoff, and discharge from the sewage system combined to make the canal's malodor so disgusting it was nicknamed \\"Lavender Lake\\". Compounding the problem, area property owners sued the city for damages related to the flooding issues that plagued the canal. By 1910, complaints were being made about the canal's water being almost solid waste, which provoked the installation of a flushing tunnel that was across. The Butler Street Pumping Station, a Beaux-Arts structure at the canal's inland end, opened on June 21, 1911. The new flushing tunnel connected to the Pumping Station. At first, the brick-lined tunnel supplied clean water from the Buttermilk Channel between Brooklyn and Governors Island, carried it eastward underneath Butler Street, and discharged the clean water at the mouth of the Gowanus Canal. The flushing tunnel also failed, and aside from numerous operational glitches, a long series of errors and mistakes occurred throughout the 1960s. This culminated in an incident when a city worker dropped a manhole cover, severely damaging the pump system, which was already suffering from the effects of the corrosive salt water. The Clean Water Act of 1972 had not yet been passed, and the city, stretched for funds at the time, did nothing to address the issue. As a result of the unrepaired damage to the flushing tunnel, and the long stretch of economic recession, the waters of the canal lay stagnant and under-used for years. =Reputation as dumping ground= There is an urban legend that the canal served as a dumping ground for the Mafia. Some cases are on record: news reports state that the bodies of a Brooklyn racketeer in the 1930s and a president of the Grain Handlers Union in the 1940s were found in the Gowanus Canal. In Lavender Lake, a 1998 documentary film about the canal, two New York City police discussed the then- recent discovery of a suitcase containing human body parts that was taken from the waterway by fishermen. There have been reports of not just persons who have died in or near the canal, but vessels lost as well. For instance, on January 2, 1889, the tug boat \\"Hugh Bond\\" sank in the canal during a gale, though the crew escaped. On May 10, 1892, the canal boat Alpha sunk with a cargo of coal. On December 31, 1903, a dredge was found sunk in the canal, and an unnamed engineer/nightwatchman was reported missing and believed to be drowned. Economic decline With six million tons of cargo produced and trafficked annually though the waterway after World War I, the Gowanus Canal became the nation's busiest commercial canal, and arguably the most polluted. The heavy sewage flow into the canal required regular dredging to keep the waters navigable. By the 1950s Brooklyn's fuel trade was already converting from coal and artificial gas to petroleum, which was served by the wider and deeper Newtown Creek, and natural gas, which arrived by pipeline. In 1951, with the opening of the elevated Gowanus Expressway over the waterway, easy access for trucks and cars catalyzed industry slightly. The expressway carried 150,000 daily vehicles, which unloaded tons of toxic emissions into the air and water beneath. Around this time, sewage going to the Gowanus Canal was redirected into sewage treatment plants near the Buttermilk Channel. With the early 1960s growth of containerization, the number of industrial waterfront jobs in the state declined, and the canal's industries were no exception. With much fanfare, the USACE completed its last dredging of the canal in 1955, and soon afterward abandoned its regular dredging schedule, deeming it to no longer be cost-effective. The intake fan that brought Buttermilk Channel water into the flushing tunnel broke in 1963, leading to its closure. A year later, the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge opened, eliminating the need for industrial boats to use the canal at all, since trucks could use the bridge and Interstate 278 to ship goods from around the country to the Gowanus area. With the failure of the city sewage and pump station infrastructure, the Gowanus Canal was used as a derelict dumping place. It remained in that condition for almost three decades. By 1993, a single company was actively using the Gowanus Canal as a shipping channel, and three of the drawbridges along the canal would only retract to let that company's boats pass. The few remaining barges mostly carried fuel oil, sand, gravel and scrap metal for export. The canal still serves as a port moving goods in and out of Brooklyn. Environmental cleanup=Early attempts at cleanup Repeated calls have been made to revitalize the economy and the environment of the Gowanus area. The first major U.S. law that would allow this, a law to address water pollution, was the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948. It was followed by the establishment of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970 and the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972. Beginning in the 1960s, locals formed the Carroll Gardens Association (CGA) to lobby for civic improvements, including cleanup of the Gowanus Canal. Long-time restaurateur Nick Monte called it a \\"stinking, cancerous sore\\" and a \\"stinking cesspool\\". CGA founder Salvatore \\"Buddy\\" Scotto, Jr. referred to the canal as \\"the most polluted waterway in the world\\", and \\"the spine of our deterioration\\", relating it directly to the economic problems of the area. In 1971, the City of New York held hearings on a Gowanus Industrial Urban Renewal Project, but did not support it with funding. In 1974, Scotto brought microbiologists from the New York City Community College (now New York City College of Technology, or City Tech) to test the Gowanus Canal's water for bacteria. The organisms they found included typhoid, cholera, dysentery, and tuberculosis. The next year, funding was obtained for a preliminary assessment of the canal. Initial findings revealed an almost total absence of oxygen, much raw sewage, grease, oil, and sludge. In 1978, construction began on the Red Hook Sewage Treatment plant in Vinegar Hill that had been planned since the 1950s. A full study of the canal was published in 1981. It indicated that on an average day, more than of raw sewage emptied into it. The report also documented the decreasing use of the canal by industry and shipping. The number of industrial firms using the canal fell from nearly fifty in 1942 to six in 1981. The amount of freight brought through the canal was more than 55% lower, and the number of times the drawbridge was opened declined by almost 70%. The report put forward a number of recommendations, one of which was fixing the flushing tunnel to increase the oxygen content of the water. In 1987, the Red Hook Treatment Plant was opened, diverting more sewage input from the canal. This $375 million plant collected waste from the existing Bond Street sewer and brought the total of combined sewer overflow (CSO) points in the city to 14. With the opening of the new plant, the last dry-weather discharge into a New York City waterway ended, and the CSO points now only function during rain storms. The next year a sewage pipe was installed within the flushing tunnel, but according to a New York City Department of Environmental Protection (NYCDEP) engineer, the pipe was so poorly installed that it failed \\"almost immediately\\". The city unsuccessfully attempted to fix the Flushing tunnel's sewage pipe in 1998. It was fixed in 1999 after engineers reversed the direction of the tunnel's fan. Previously, water from the canal had gone westward into the Buttermilk Channel, but now water from the channel went into the Gowanus Canal. Superfund cleanupPlanning= On the canal below Hamilton Avenue, barges bring crushed stone and store rental construction equipment. In 2002, USACE entered into a cost-sharing agreement with the DEP to collaborate on a $5 million Ecosystem Restoration Feasibility Study of the Gowanus Canal area. It was to examine possible alternatives for ecosystem restoration such as dredging, and wetland and habitat restoration and be completed in 2005. Discussions turned to breaking down the hard edges of the canal to restore some of the natural processes to improve the overall environment of the Gowanus wetlands area. The DEP also initiated the Gowanus Canal Use and Standards Attainment project to meet the city's obligations under the Clean Water Act. In early 2006, the problem of wastewater management arose during a controversy over a planned arena for the Brooklyn Nets in nearby downtown Brooklyn. The project, at that point called Pacific Park, was to include a basketball arena and 17 skyscrapers. The resulting sewage would flow into antiquated combined sewers that can overflow when it rains. The Gowanus Canal has 14 combined sewer overflow points. The fear was the additional wastewater from the arena would lead to more frequent overflows in the canal. In March 2009, the EPA proposed that the canal be listed as a Superfund cleanup site.U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. New York, NY. \\"Gowanus Canal Superfund Site.\\" Updated February 4, 2010. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) supported this action. It had requested help from the EPA to address the canal's environmental problems. In May 2009, the city stepped forward to oppose the Superfund listing. For the first time it offered to produce a Gowanus cleanup plan that would match the work of a Superfund cleanup, but with a promise to accomplish it faster. The city said it could now achieve a faster cleanup than the EPA. It would fund the cleanup through taxpayer dollars from the state and city levels, while the EPA would seek its funding from the polluters. The nonprofit Gowanus Canal Conservancy was also founded in 2009, creating partnerships with the EPA, the NYCDEP, groups such as Riverkeeper, and universities such as Cornell and Rutgers. On March 4, 2010, the EPA announced that it had placed the Gowanus Canal on its Superfund National Priorities List. Following this, the USACE halted their study immediately, giving all their research to the EPA. Initially, local residents resisted the EPA's proposed cleanup methods, as they feared that the toxic waste retrieved from the canal would instead be displaced onto nearby public areas. By 2013, the NYCDEP was planning to reduce the sewage content of the canal by repairing a tunnel that flushes fresh water into the Gowanus. The repair would mitigate, but not completely eliminate, the sewage problem. On September 27, 2013, the EPA approved a clean-up plan for the Gowanus Canal. The plan, which would cost $506 million and be completed by 2022, divided the canal into three segments split by 3rd Street and the Hamilton Avenue Bridge. The plan entails three steps: dredging contaminated sediment from the bottom of the canal; capping the dredged areas; and implementing controls on combined sewer overflows to prevent future contamination. It also involves excavating and restoring approximately of the former 1st Street Basin and of the former 5th Street Basin. The restoration is expected to be paid for by the host of entities deemed \\"responsible parties\\" for the pollution by the EPA, including Brooklyn Gas and Electric, now doing business as National Grid and the City of New York. The EPA suggested seven plans for the cleanup. In 2014, the EPA presented a proposal for containing toxic sludge in the Gowanus Canal. The Village Voice reported two scenarios as most viable. These were estimated to take ten years to complete and would cost around $350‚Äì$450 million. The first step in the plans was dredging, which was scheduled to begin in 2016. The second step was to lay down one of two different proposed \\"caps\\". The first \\"cap\\" proposal was for a concrete device, while the second was for a multi-layered device with pollutant-absorbent clay, a sand buffer, and an anchor composed of rocks. Ultimately, the multi-layered cap was selected for installation in the canal. However, there were concerns that the clean-up could pose a health risk. =Beginning of cleanup= In early 2017, there were fears that funding for the Gowanus Canal cleanup could be cut under the administration of President Donald Trump, which was reducing the EPA's budget. However, EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, who had proposed many of the EPA budget changes and program eliminations, approved of the funding, saying that Superfund cleanups should be prioritized. Work on the cleanup process began in October 2017, and at the time, the cleanup was expected to cost $506 million. The first phase of a pilot study at the canal's Fourth Street Turning Basin began in December 2016, but was delayed while bulkheads were being installed along the canal's banks. The pilot dredging uncovered several artifacts such as a crash boat from World War II; industrial wooden bobbins for textiles; and 19th-century wagon wheels. These artifacts had to be cleaned of contaminants before archaeologists could study them. In July 2018, during the pilot study, the promenade near Whole Foods was damaged due to contractor error. The cleanup itself was expected to start in 2020 and be completed two years later. The EPA issued a formal order on Tuesday, January 28, 2020, which initiated the first phase of the $506 million cleanup on the 1.8 mile long canal. This $125 million first phase would begin in September 2020 and last 30 months. ComponentsEPA treatment= The Gowanus Canal, near Smith and 9th Streets, with the Gowanus Expressway in the distance The canal's toxic sediment layer averages thick, and at some spots reaches . As part of the Superfund cleanup, the EPA would remove approximately of highly contaminated sediment from the upper and middle segments and of contaminated sediment from the lower segment. The sediment would be treated at an off-site facility. Then, at the locations where contamination had permeated the underlying sediment, the EPA would cap the dredges with multiple layers of clean material. The multi-layer caps consist of an \\"active\\" layer made of a specific type of clay that would remove contamination that could well up from below. Atop the clay layer is an \\"isolation\\" layer of sand and gravel that will ensure that the contaminants are not exposed. Next, an \\"armor\\" layer of heavier gravel and stone prevents boat traffic and canal currents from eroding the underlying layers. The topmost layer comprises sufficient clean sand atop the \\"armor\\" layer, filling the gaps in the layer of stones and establishing sufficient depth to restore the canal bottom as a habitat. In the middle and upper segments of the canal, where liquid coal tar has seeped into the natural sediment, the EPA would stabilize that sediment by mixing it with concrete or similar materials. The stabilized areas would then be covered with the multiple-layer caps. As the Superfund model required the EPA to seek restitution from the Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs), the estimated cost of the cleanup plan would be divided and distributed among more than 30 companies responsible for polluting the canal, as well as government entities like the New York City government and the United States Navy. Some of these companies, such as Brooklyn Union Gas, either no longer existed, had relocated, or had been renamed. If these defunct companies have been incorporated into another company, the property owners and the parent companies were expected to take responsibility, as are the companies that created or moved the pollutants around. The EPA Superfund Gowanus report identified two major PRPs: National Grid (which later acquired Brooklyn Union Gas' successor KeySpan) and the New York City government. =Reactivation of the flushing tunnel= According to the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, plans to reactivate the flushing tunnel pump were proposed in 1982. Various events caused the project to be delayed until 1994. The tunnel was finally reactivated in 1999. The new design employed a 600 horsepower (450 kW) motor, that pumped an average rate of a day of aerated water from the Buttermilk Channel in the Upper New York Bay into the head end of the canal. Although water was circulating through the tunnel, tidal forces meant it could only be pumped 11 hours a day. The water quality of samples taken while the flushing pump was operating was reported to have improved.New York City Department of Environmental Protection, City Activates Gowanus Canal Flushing Tunnel, Publication 99-28, New York: April 30, 1999 In 2010, New York City began a four-year project to upgrade and reactivate the flushing tunnel. According to The New York Times, the proposed plans included steps to \\"reconstruct the motor pit and replace the propeller with three modern vertical turbines; clean, patch and smooth the interior of the tunnel; replace the broken sewer pipe and encase it in concrete to improve water flow; and reduce the amount of sewer overflow into the canal by increasing capacity at a nearby pumping plant\\". Increasing oxygen content was a major goal of the project. The original plans were modified in 2012, after Hurricane Sandy, to protect critical equipment from flooding. In 2014, following completion of much of the work, the tunnel was reactivated at a cost of $177 million. =Stormwater management= Throughout its history, the Gowanus Canal's sewage problems have been exacerbated by the effects of stormwater. For years, heavy rains have flooded streets and caused sewage lines to overflow, contributing to the canal's contamination. Much of the Gowanus Canal area is at sea level, in a Zone A risk area for flooding. To help prevent flooding, the city is investing in various methods of stormwater management. One related improvement has been the creation of specialized curbside gardens, or bioswales, along sidewalks to absorb stormwater and reduce sewer overflows into the canal. A community-based non-profit organization, the Gowanus Canal Conservancy, is involved in stewardship of the bioswales. In 2015, the city built Sponge Park, along the canal's western bank at Second Street. The park doubles as a stormwater catchment area, absorbing pollutants before they can go into the canal. Mouth of the canal Beginning in 2017, the City's Department of Environmental Protection built several miles of high-level storm sewers (HLSS) to prevent stormwater from flooding the city's sewage system. The new storm sewers carry stormwater collected in new and existing catchment areas, preventing it from entering the sewage system. The first phase, comprising sewer installations south of Douglass Street, was supposed to be completed by summer 2018; a second phase north of Douglass Street would proceed from 2018 to 2020. The HLSS, built on a area east of the northern end of the canal, are planned to capture half of the stormwater within the Gowanus Canal's watershed. Also in 2017, the New York City government published plans to construct two combined sewer overflow facilities along the canal to help with stormwater management. The first facility, the \\"Head End Site\\", is to be at the very north end of the canal on the eastern bank. The facility, located adjacent to an existing manufactured gas plant site, would handle sewage from the Red Hook Watershed, which comprises the land around the canal's western bank and north of the canal's head. The second facility, the \\"Owls Head Site\\", is to be at Second Avenue and Fifth Street, where the Fourth Street Basin splits off the rest of the canal. It would clean the water from the Owls Head watershed, which constitutes the land from the eastern bank to Prospect Park. These new facilities are required as part of an agreement between the city and the EPA. By February 2019, the EPA and the city disagreed on whether untreated sewage should be stored in either tanks or flushed out through a tunnel. The EPA wanted to divert the sewage to newly built tanks along the canal, which would be less costly and be complete by 2027. However, the city has proposed diverting untreated sewage into a new tunnel, which would be more expensive and be finished in 2030. Redevelopment=Redevelopment plans Boats on the canal As early as 1980, the Gowanus area's low rents and proximity to more expensive cultural centers in New York had attracted artists and musicians. The sparsely occupied industrial area offered spaces for studios, music venues, bars, gyms and other businesses that benefited from low space-to-cost ratios. Nonetheless, the area's population declined to a historic low of 24,000 residents in 1990. The Carroll Street Bridge, an important Gowanus Canal crossing, closed for renovations in 1985. This caused major inconveniences for the surrounding communities, who had to walk several blocks to get to the other side of the canal. Businesses and schools closed as a result. The bridge reopened in 1989, its 100th anniversary. In 1999, Assemblywoman Joan Millman allocated $100,000 to the Gowanus Canal Community Development Corporation (GCCDC) to produce and distribute a bulkhead study and public access document. The following year, GCCDC received $270,000 from the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation's Green Street program to construct three street-end public open spaces along the Gowanus Canal. Governor George E. Pataki funded an additional $270,000 to create a revitalization plan in 2001. $100,000 in capital funds were allocated in 2002 to implement a pilot project on the shoreline. In 2003, Congresswoman Nydia Vel√°zquez allocated an additional $225,000 to create a comprehensive community development plan. The organization relies on community volunteers to maintain and clean these Green Street Projects. The New York City government, local citizens' groups, developers, the EPA, and the USACE had a wide variety of concerns and differing visions for redevelopment in the area. The New York City government feared that designating the Gowanus Canal as a Superfund site would result in many potentially costly lawsuits against polluters. Meanwhile, the area directly to the east of the Gowanus neighborhood was rezoned for high density residential use with a strong commercial component in 2003. In 2009, plans to rezone Gowanus were also created. Many residents and community groups have expressed concern over the sewage overflow that the rezoning could possibly create. Redevelopment sites The United States Postal Service closed a USPS maintenance garage on the east side of the Ninth Street Bridge in the early 1990s. The site became available for commercial development. In 1998, the site was proposed for the construction of Brooklyn Commons, a $63 million entertainment and retail complex featuring a 22-screen multiplex cinema, a bowling alley, shops, restaurants and a 1,500-space parking lot. The Swedish furniture store IKEA planned to open a store on the site, but withdrew its proposal in 2001 after opposition from the community. IKEA was later given permission to build a store in adjacent Red Hook. The 9th Street site remained empty until 2004 when a large Lowe's store was built and opened, along with an adjacent public promenade overlooking the canal. By 1998, the neighborhoods around the canal (Carroll Gardens and Park Slope) were experiencing a resurgence of interest in the residential market. Perceptions of environmental risk related to pollution and possible flooding vied with the appeal of a diverse community accessible to more expensive areas of New York City. The area was given a new zoning designation, the \\"Gowanus Manufacturing Zone\\", as various groups try to determine the future of this complex urban space. Effects of the cleanup on redevelopment In February 2009, the City of New York granted a zoning change to the developer, Toll Brothers Inc. This allowed for a 480-unit, twelve-story super-block residential project, the first one permitted along the waterway. The city also set aside some land for a medium-sized development with 3,200 apartments. Twenty-five city blocks were allocated for 60 sites that were planned to produce a combined $500 million in tax revenues per year. Toll Brothers abandoned their project in 2010 after the Gowanus Canal was declared a Superfund cleanup site. However, the cleanup itself led to a larger redevelopment movement in Gowanus. The first large- scale luxury development in the Gowanus area, 365 Bond, opened in June 2016 and was completely occupied by the following year. There were more than 56,000 applications for the 86 affordable apartments included in the development. In August 2016, the city restarted the rezoning process for the surrounding neighborhood. In June 2017, the Gowanus Canal Conservancy began the process of designing a redevelopment plan for the area. Officials planned to reveal a more comprehensive plan in 2018, including rezoning a 43-block area and requiring developers to reserve 25% of the new units for affordable housing. By late 2017, new development was concentrated around a rezoning area in the northern half of the canal. Although this area had gentrified rapidly, some residents opposed the new developments. The zoning plan for the area was projected to undergo changes through 2019, at which point the Superfund cleanup would be at its peak. Several developers bought, or were planning on buying, abandoned or little-used waterfront sites along the canal. An artist's community at Ninth Street was being turned into a mixed-use office building complex. In addition, the lyric-annotation website Genius.com had moved into a building in the northern portion of the canal. Current usage April 2014 view Organizations dedicated to providing waterfront access and canal education include the Gowanus Dredgers Canoe Club (founded in 1999), and The Urban Divers Estuary Conservancy (founded in 1998). During the 2003 season, more than 1,000 people participated in Dredger Canoe Club programs, logging more than 2,000 trips along the canal. The city government took a site at Smith and 4th Streets in 1975 and designated it a public place for use as \\"public recreation space\\". Despite the legal standing as a Public Place, developers have continually proposed developing the site for other uses. National Grid is accountable for cleanup of the pollution left on the site after years of coal gas manufacture. Upon completion of this cleanup, the site was to be turned over to the New York City Parks Department.\\"Cleanup of the Gowanus Canal\\", Gowanus Superfund website. Accessed: November 14, 2014 Activism In November 2006, HABITATS, a festival dedicated to \\"local action as global wisdom\\", celebrated the Gowanus Canal with environmental conferences, collaborative art, educational programs and interactive walks around the area.Habitats, Celebrating the revitalization of the Historic Gowanus Canal , accessed November 7, 2006. The canal has also been the home to various arts organizations. Issue Project Room once organized art events in a converted silo along the bank of the canal. The Yard, an outdoor concert space, opened in the summer of 2007 near the Carroll Street Bridge, but shut down at the end of summer 2010. On Earth Day in 2015, environmental activist Christopher Swain swam through the Gowanus Canal to promote awareness of the environmental restorative work. He wore protective swimwear however some of his skin was exposed to the biological and industrial waste. He applied preventative countermeasures such as antibacterial lotion and a hydrogen peroxide mouthwash. Swain, who had swum through heavily polluted waterways, described the Gowanus as being the dirtiest body of water that he had swum through, composing of \\"mud, poo, detergent, oil and gasoline\\" and \\"swimming through a dirty diaper\\". Water quality A salt lot along the canal Different parts of the Gowanus Canal are effectively microclimates, which may have very different conditions and types of contamination. Overall, the water is considered unsafe to drink or swim in, and contact with the canal's water is discouraged. The Gowanus Dredgers Canoe Club encourages people to canoe on the canal, in part as an incentive to revitalize the area. The Urban Divers Estuary Conservancy allows careful diving using full-encapsulation suits, followed by rigorous decontamination procedures. Fish caught in the canal are generally toxic and unsafe to eat in large quantities. birds have begun returning to the canal, which some hope suggests the water quality is improving enough to support wildlife. Anecdotal descriptions Anecdotal reports of the canal's water quality include descriptions of a reddish- purplish color due to coal and slaughterhouse wastes in the 19th century, and a lighter purplish color, leading to its nickname \\"Lavender Lake\\" in the 20th century. Twentieth-century author H. P. Lovecraft described \\"the lapping oily waves at its grimy piers\\". In 1999, the water's usual color was described as \\"green with a white undertone, akin to the look of cream-infused coffee\\". A 2013 account describes the canal's \\"modern\\" color as being gray-green. In 2017, two long-time residents recalled the canal's black color in the 1950s: \\"All you could see was a big cesspool, and bubbles coming up.\\" The surface of the Gowanus Canal's water has frequently been reported to have an iridescent sheen suggestive of oil, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), coal tar, and other industrial wastes. As recently as December 2009 a Gowanus Canal Investigation Executive Summary Report noted the presence of \\"spotty, iridescent, and platy sheens of varying intensity,\\" fecal matter, emulsified oil, and blebs of non- aqueous phase liquid in various areas of the canal. Photographers have also captured artistic images of the canal. The opaqueness of the canal's water obstructs sunlight to one-third of the depth needed for the bottom-level growth of aquatic plants. Rising gas bubbles betray the decomposition of sewage sludge that on a warm, sultry day produces the Gowanus Canal's notable ripe stench. One reporter described the smell as \\"like sticking your head into a rubber boot filled with used motor oil and rotten eggs,\\" while another said that it was \\"less a scent than an assault that reaches in to choke the throat. Sometimes it has the biting odor of petroleum, with more than a hint of dead fish.\\" There are reports that the smell has lessened in recent years as oxygen levels in the water have increased. The murky depths of the canal conceal the legacy of its industrial past: cement, oil, mercury, lead, multiple volatile organic compounds, PCBs, coal tar, and other contaminants. A sludgy bottom- layer of \\"black mayonnaise\\" was described beginning in the 19th century and is still present‚Äîin some places up to deep. Scientific measurements Beginning in the 1970s, a variety of governmental, academic, and citizens' groups have taken intermittent measurements of the canal's water quality. There has been no coherent, long-term program for tracking water quality because no funds exist for such a program. The canal hosts high levels of pathogens, many of which are harmful to humans. The 1974 report by New York City Community College microbiologists found that the water contained typhoid, cholera, dysentery, and tuberculosis. Additionally, a 2003 report of the New York Harbor showed that the Gowanus Canal had the highest level of pathogens of any location in the entire harbor. Microbiologist Nasreen Haque and her classes from the City University of New York have also tested water from the Gowanus. In 2007‚Äì2008, Haque's classes reported finding \\"every kind of imaginable pathogen,\\" including those that cause gonorrhea. However, in 2010, students from City Tech found lower levels of Escherichia coli than they had expected. The Gowanus Canal abutting the Benson Scrap Metal scrapyard Fecal matter is also prevalent in the canal. In 2009, a local environmental \\"neighborhood watch\\" called Riverkeeper tested canal water immediately following heavy rains and sewage flooding. It reported Enterococcus at levels of 17,329 cells per 100 milliliters, with anything above 104 cells per 100 milliliters being considered unsafe; Enterococcus is considered an indicator of other possible pathogens. As of 2013, fecal matter was still present in Gowanus' water at levels of parts per hundred. A more usual measurement for a waterway would be parts per million. Low levels of dissolved oxygen in the canal's waters predate World War I. The minimum level of oxygen required to support healthy marine life is estimated at 4 parts per million. As early as 1909, it was reported that the canal had no oxygen at all. In 1975 a severe lack of oxygen was still observed, indicating the water was incapable of sustaining plant life or fish. In 1999, just before the flushing tunnel was reactivated, The Environmental Magazine reported that oxygen levels in the Gowanus Canal measured about 1.5 parts per million; this number continued to be quoted fourteen years later. However, by 2008, nine years after the flushing tunnel was reopened to provide oxygenation of the water, biologist Kathleen Nolan and students from St. Francis College sampled the water and reported that levels of dissolved oxygen had substantially increased. In 2014, a NYSDEC representative stated that dissolved oxygen levels were reported to be in the range of , or approximately 9‚Äì12 parts per million. With respect to the underlying layers of residue in the canal, the EPA and other organizations have performed detailed analyses of the composition and distribution of black mayonnaise throughout it. The 2012 Superfund Proposed Plan also includes detailed assessments of risk related to the types of pollutants in the layers of sediment, the water, and the surrounding area. The Gowanus Canal's pollution has also spread to Gowanus Creek, at the mouth of the canal. In 1982, USACE released the results of a report on navigation in the creek. It found that there were nonexistent levels of oxygen; high concentrations of fecal coliforms; and significant clusters of oil and grease. Wildlife Originally, the marshland and freshwater springs that drained into the Atlantic Ocean in Upper New York Bay were capable of supporting massive oyster beds. As late as 1911, people reported fishing in the Gowanus Canal and treading for clams. By 1927, the last of New York's oyster beds had closed as a result of habitat destruction, over-harvesting, and pollution. Attempts have been made to reintroduce oysters and other shellfish to the canal, because they can filter out toxins and help clean the water. One oyster can process as much as of water a day. The NY/NJ Baykeeper environmental group gives oysters to volunteers who then monitor their health and growth in local waterways. They have helped Katie Mosher-Smith and The Gowanus Community Oyster Garden's Stewards to partner with teachers, students and the Gowanus Dredgers Canoe Club to install and monitor oyster cages in the canal. In 2012, landscape architect Kate Orff proposed a design for a park with a living reef containing oysters, mussels, and eelgrass. As part of a pilot program, ropes were hung off of a pier to attract ribbed mussels. Restoration of the flushing tunnel, and the resulting increase in oxygen levels in the canal, have supported the return of some aquatic life. Within months of the reopening of the flushing tunnel in 1999, John C. Muir of the Brooklyn Center for the Urban Environment observed pink jellyfish, blue crabs, and a variety of fish. By 2009, white perch, herring, striped bass, and anchovies were living in the waterway. In 2014, the Gowanus Canal Conservancy reported that herons, egrets, bats, and Canada geese were living nearby. However, individuals and populations of wild animals living in the Gowanus Canal may be at risk for reproductive problems. Creatures living in the canal generally have a below-average life expectancy compared to members of the same species living elsewhere in New York Harbor. Approximately 15 edible species of fish and shellfish can be found in the canal, but they are toxic. The shellfish contain toxins and are unsafe to eat, according to a 2012 report. However, signs posted in 2018 note that men over age 15 and women over age 50 can safely eat up to six blue crabs from the Gowanus Canal each week, although women under 50 and children under 15 should not eat the canal's blue crabs at all. Aquatic mammals have been observed in the canal only rarely and in cases of severe distress. A harp seal was observed in the canal in 2003, its flippers bloodied, but it survived and was relocated to the Long Island Sound. In 2007, a young minke whale ended up in the canal as a result of heavy storms. The whale, soon nicknamed \\"Sludgy\\", was unable to get out and soon died. A necropsy of Sludgy, performed by animal anatomist Joy Reidenberg, indicated that the whale had already been sick. On January 26, 2013, a dolphin entered the canal at low tide, was unable to get out, and died. A necropsy showed that it was middle-aged and sickly before becoming trapped. It had kidney stones, gastric ulcers, and parasites. New forms of life Although the Gowanus Canal is poisonous to humans, it may be breeding previously unidentified types of organisms. In 2008, Nasreen and Nilofaur Haque reported the presence of white clouds of \\"biofilm\\" floating above the sludge on the bottom of the canal. Examinations suggested that the colloquially named \\"white stuff\\" is a co-operative mix of bacteria, protozoa, chemicals, and other substances. The parts of the mixture acted together to find food, and the biological components exchanged genes and excreted material that acts as an antibiotic to protect it from toxins in the water. The Haques started studying methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from the canal to learn more about what makes bacteria resistant, so that the research might help to develop new antibiotic drugs. In 2014, volunteers and scientists donned Hazmat suits to sample the black mayonnaise from the canal, extracting DNA which was sequenced at the Weill-Cornell Medical College. Ellen Jorgensen, executive director of the startup Genspace, reported that the group failed to identify half of the DNA. They found \\"42 kinds of bacteria, two viruses, and five life forms from the domain Archaea,\\" many uniquely adapted to the extreme environment of the Gowanus Canal. Methylococcaceae, a family of microbes found in the Fourth Street Basin, consume methane. Desulfobacterales take in sulfate and release hydrogen sulfide, contributing to the Gowanus‚Äô characteristic rotten egg smell. Bioengineers and others involved in the 2014 study were also interested in studying the Gowanus Canal's unique microbial communities. These naturally-evolving bioremediating bacteria consume the Gowanus‚Äô pollutants. Understanding how they co-exist with and degrade toxic compounds might suggest new methods for bioremediation. In popular culture Jonathan Lethem (pictured sitting on the bank of the Gowanus Canal) referred to the canal in his book Motherless Brooklyn. Thomas Wolfe described the \\"huge symphonic stink\\" of the canal which was \\"cunningly compacted of unnumbered separate putrefactions\\" in his 1940 novel You Can't Go Home Again. The 1985 film Heaven Help Us used Carroll Street Bridge as a filming location. In Jonathan Lethem's Motherless Brooklyn (1999), a character refers to the canal as \\"the only body of water in the world that is 90 percent guns\\". In Joseph O'Neill's novel Netherland (2008), the remains of one of the protagonists are found in the Gowanus Canal. In an episode of the TV show Bored to Death, called The Gowanus Canal Has Gonorrhea!, two antagonists threaten the show's hero with a swim in the canal. In 2014, So What? Press published an issue of its comic series Tales of the Night Watchman, entitled \\"It Came from the Gowanus Canal,\\" about a toxic sludge monster who lives in the canal and takes revenge on a gangster who once dumped bodies there. It was written by Dave Kelly and illustrated by Molly Ostertag. The publisher also produced a fake movie poster in conjunction with the Gowanus Souvenir Shop based on the issue in 2015. In 2017, a sequel to the comic was produced with the title \\"It Came from the Gowanus Canal...Again!\\" It was written by Dave Kelly, drawn by Brett Hobson, colored by Clare DeZutti, with a cover by Tim Hamilton. In the sequel, the monster returns and takes revenge on criminals who are responsible for the death of a young boy, but the Night Watchman must protect one of the killers to stop the monster. In November 2015, Gothamist posted a video that featured a fisherman saying that he had just caught a three-eyed catfish in the canal. Although the story was later posted by a number of news outlets, experts expressed skepticism about the fish story. A New York Times article indicated that the three-eyed catfish was a hoax perpetrated by the performance artist Zardulu.

This excerpt from the Lewis and Clark map of 1814 shows the rivers of western Iowa and eastern South Dakota. The Big Sioux River (\\"Sioux\\") is seen near the center of the map. The Big Sioux River is a tributary of the Missouri River, 419 miles (674 km) long,U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed March 30, 2011 in eastern South Dakota and northwestern Iowa in the United States. The United States Board on Geographic Names settled on \\"Big Sioux River\\" as the stream's name in 1931. The river was named after the Lakota people (Sioux Natives) which was known by them as Tehankasandata, or Thick Wooded River. The Big Sioux River rises in Roberts County, South Dakota on a low plateau known as the Coteau des Prairies and flows generally southwardly through Grant, Codington, Hamlin, Brookings, Moody, and Minnehaha counties, past the communities of Watertown, Castlewood, Bruce, Flandreau, Egan, Trent, Dell Rapids, and Baltic to Sioux Falls, where it passes over a waterfall in Falls Park, which gives that city its name. Downstream of Sioux Falls and the community of Brandon, the Big Sioux is used to define the boundary between South Dakota and Iowa, flowing along the eastern borders of Lincoln and Union counties in South Dakota, and the western borders of Lyon, Sioux and Plymouth counties in Iowa, past the communities of Canton, Fairview, Hudson, Hawarden, North Sioux City, and Dakota Dunes in South Dakota and Beloit, Hawarden and Akron in Iowa. It joins the Missouri River from the north at Sioux City, Iowa.DeLorme (1998). Iowa Atlas & Gazetteer. Yarmouth, Maine: DeLorme. DeLorme (2001). South Dakota Atlas & Gazetteer. Yarmouth, Maine: DeLorme. The Big Sioux River, at the USGS station in Sioux City, Iowa, has a mean annual discharge of approximately 3,793 cubic feet per second.USGS station Tributaries The Big Sioux River collects the Rock River from the northeast in Sioux County, Iowa. A minor headwaters tributary of the Big Sioux in Grant County, South Dakota, is known as the Indian River. Broken Kettle Creek has its confluence with the Big Sioux in Plymouth County, Iowa. Pollution The Big Sioux is South Dakota's most populated river basin. Agriculture is the primary use of land along most of the river's course. To comply with the Clean Water Act, the state monitors water quality of its rivers. Most of the Big Sioux north of Sioux Falls was scored well in 2012. Portions near Lake Kampeska and between Willow and Stray Horse Creeks (Codington and Hamlin counties) exceeded federally allowable levels of E. coli and fecal coliform bacteria. However, the Big Sioux south of Sioux Falls is much more polluted with E. coli, fecal coliform, and suspended solids. Several portions heavily restrict fishing or human contact, and swimming is banned. Flood control Between 1955 and 1961, an extensive flood control system was constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers along the Big Sioux and some of its tributaries in Sioux Falls to protect the city from a 100-year flood event. Features of the system include of levees, a floodwall in downtown, and a diversion channel with a dam at one end and a spillway at the other. The diversion channel connects two ends of the Big Sioux's natural loop around central Sioux Falls in an effort to channel floodwater away from the city. The levees then act to contain any floodwater either remaining in the natural channel or originating from Skunk Creek (whose mouth is downriver of the diversion dam).Jorgensen, Don. Sioux Falls diverts water to ease flooding KELO-TV. March 15, 2010. (accessed April 19, 2010). Additionally, a greenway covers much of the river's floodplain in southern and eastern Sioux Falls, further mitigating any property damage from high water.  Flooding  The Big Sioux River experienced record-breaking flooding during the 2019 Midwestern U.S. floods. The Big Sioux River Flood Information System was used to model flooding during the March 2019 bomb cyclone event. The river overflowed its banks between September 12‚Äì15, 2019, flooding three blocks of Dell Rapids, South Dakota, and damaging up to a dozen homes. Interstate 90 was shut down between Mitchell and Sioux Falls.

On behalf of his nation, he negotiated with the new United States after the American Revolutionary War, when the Seneca as British allies were forced to cede much land following the defeat of the British; he signed the Treaty of Canandaigua (1794). He helped secure some Seneca territory in New York state, although most of his people had migrated to Canada for resettlement after the Paris Treaty. Red Jacket's speech on \\"Religion for the White Man and the Red\\" (1805) has been preserved as an example of his great oratorical style. Life Red Jacket's birthplace has long been a matter of debate. Some historians claim he was born about 1750 at Kanadaseaga, also known as the Old Seneca Castle. Present-day Geneva, New York, developed near here, at the foot of Seneca Lake.John Niles Hubbard, \\"An Account of Sa-Go-Ye-Wat-Ha Others believe he was born near Cayuga Lake and present-day Canoga,Col. William L. Stone (1838), Life of Red Jacket Others say he was born south of present-day Branchport, at Keuka Lake near the mouth of Basswood Creek.Miles A. Davis (1912), History of Jerusalem, p. 38Stafford C. Cleveland (1873), History of Yates County, p. 450 It is known that he grew up with his family at Basswood Creek, and his mother was buried there after her death. The Iroquois had a matrilineal kinship system, with inheritance and descent figured through the maternal line. Red Jacket was considered to be born into his mother's Wolf Clan, and his social status was based on her family and clan. Red Jacket lived much of his adult life in Seneca territory in the Genesee River Valley in western New York. In the later years of his life, Red Jacket moved to Canada for a short period of time. He and the Mohawk chief Joseph Brant became bitter enemies and rivals before the American Revolutionary War, although they often met together at the Iroquois Confederacy's Longhouse. During the war, when most of both the Seneca and Mohawk were allies of the British, Brant contemptuously referred to Red Jacket as \\"cow killer\\". He alleged that at the Battle of Newtown in 1779, Red Jacket killed a cow and used the blood as evidence to claim he had killed an American rebel.Graymont, pg. 216 President's House, Philadelphia. Red Jacket met with presidents George Washington, and later John Adams, in the presidential mansion in Philadelphia, when that city was the temporary national capital. Red Jacket became famous as an orator, speaking for the rights of his people. After the war, he played a prominent role in negotiations with the new United States federal government. In 1792 he led a delegation of 50 Native American leaders to Philadelphia. The US president George Washington presented him with a special \\"peace medal\\", a large oval of silverplate engraved with an image of Washington on the right-hand side shaking Red Jacket's hand; below was inscribed \\"George Washington\\", \\"Red Jacket\\", and \\"1792\\". Red Jacket wore this medal on his chest in every portrait painted of him. (Today the medal is held in the collection of the Buffalo History Museum.)He was also presented with a silver inlaid half-stock long rifle, bearing his initials and Wolf clan emblem in the stock and his later name Sagoyewatha inlaid on the barrel. This rifle has been in private hands since his death. In 1794, Red Jacket was a signatory, along with Cornplanter, Handsome Lake, and fifty other Iroquois leaders, of the Treaty of Canandaigua, by which they were forced to cede much of their land to the United States due to the defeat of their British ally during the war. Britain had ceded all its claims to land in the colonies without consulting the Iroquois or other Native American allies. The treaty confirmed peace with the United States, as well as the boundaries of the postwar the Phelps and Gorham Purchase (1788) of most of the Seneca land east of the Genesee River in western New York. In 1790 the Public Universal Friend and the Philadelphia Society of Friends were the first settlers in the formerly Seneca region. Despite the pillaging of the Native River-Settlement in Ah-Wa-Ga Oswego, New York, by generals Clinton and Sullivan during the Revolutionary War, the Society made peace with the wary Seneca tribe. The Seneca Tribe made peace with settlers in the Finger Lakes region, but they suffered hardship in the Genesee Region and other parts of Western New York.Wisbey, Herbert A., Jr. (2009). Pioneer Prophetess: Jemima Wilkinson the Publick Universal Friend. Cornell Press. In 1797, by the Treaty of Big Tree, Robert Morris paid $100,000 to the Seneca for rights to some of their lands west of the Genesee River. (This area developed as present-day Geneseo in Livingston County). Red Jacket had tried to prevent the sale but, unable to persuade the other chiefs, he gave up his opposition. As often occurred, Morris used gifts of liquor to the Seneca men and trinkets to the women to \\"grease\\" the sale. Morris had previously purchased the land from Massachusetts, subject to the Indian title, then sold it to the Holland Land Company for speculative development. He retained only the Morris Reserve, an estate near the present-day city of Rochester. During the negotiations, Brant was reported to have told an insulting story about Red Jacket. Cornplanter intervened and prevented the Seneca leader from attacking and killing Brant.The Cornplanter Chronicles, Vol. 4, part 7, Mountain Laurel Review Forest Lawn Cemetery. Red Jacket took his name, one of several he used as an adult, from a highly favored embroidered coat given to him by the British for his wartime services. The Seneca allied with the British Crown during the American Revolution, both because of their long trading relationships and in the hope that the British could limit American encroachment on their territory. After the British were defeated, the Seneca were forced to cede much of their territory to the United States. Many of their people resettled in Canada at what is now the Six Nations Reserve in Ontario. In the War of 1812, Red Jacket supported the American side. His later adult name, Sagoyewatha, which roughly translates as \\"he keeps them awake\\", was given by the Seneca about 1780 in recognition of his oratory skill. When in 1805 Mr. Cram, a New England missionary, asked to do mission work among the Seneca, Red Jacket responded by saying that the Seneca had suffered much at the hands of Europeans. His speech, \\"Religion for the White Man and the Red\\", expressed his profound belief that Native American religion was fitting and sufficient for Seneca and Native American culture. It has been documented and preserved as one of the best examples of North American oratory.\\"Red Jacket on Religion for the White Man and the Red\\", Bartleby Website, accessed 22 May 2011 Red Jacket developed a problem with alcohol and deeply regretted having taken his first drink (see following quote). When asked if he had children, the chief, who had lost most of his offspring to illness, said: > Red Jacket was once a great man, and in favor with the Great Spirit. He was > a lofty pine among the smaller trees of the forest. But, after years of > glory, he degraded himself by drinking the firewater of the white man. The > Great Spirit has looked upon him in anger, and his lightning has stripped > the pine of its branches. In his later years, Sagoyewatha lived in Buffalo, New York. On his death, his remains were buried in an Indian cemetery (now within Seneca Indian Park in South Buffalo, New York). In 1876, the politician William C. Bryant presented a plan to the Council of the Seneca Nation to reinter Red Jacket's remains in Forest Lawn Cemetery, Buffalo. This was carried out on October 9, 1884. The proceedings, with papers documenting speeches given by Horatio Hale, General Ely S. Parker (Red Jacket's nephew's grandson, known as a \\"clan grandson,\\" who inherited the famous medal), and others, were published (Buffalo, 1884). A memorial to Red Jacket still stands within Seneca Indian Park. According to Appletons' Cyclop√¶dia of American Biography, \\"Several portraits were made of him. George Catlin painted him twice, Henry Inman once, and Robert W. Weir did his portrait in 1828, when Red Jacket was on a visit to New York City. Fitz- Greene Halleck has celebrated him in song.\\" Speech to the U.S. Senate This famous speech, also known as his talk on \\"Religion for the White Man and the Red\\", is an example of his great skill as an orator. He spoke in 1805 as a response to a request by Jacob Cram, a New England missionary, to evangelize among the Seneca. On this day, the two men met in Buffalo Creek, New York, to discuss their religious beliefs. After meeting with the leaders of the Seneca delegation, Red Jacket provided a thought-out response representing his people as a whole. He responded to Cram's words: \\"There is but one religion, and but one way to serve God, and if you do not embrace the right way, you cannot be happy hereafter\\". He argued peacefully that the European Americans and Native American peoples should each have the right to worship the religion that suits them best. At the time, the Iroquois of present-day New York State were having difficulty dealing with the constant increase of European immigrants and encroachment on their remaining lands. As the numbers of European Americans grew in the Iroquois territories, the two peoples' opposing cultures became more and more apparent. Red Jacket made it clear that he and his people would not change their religious beliefs based on the white man's word. He began, \\"It was the will of the Great Spirit that we should meet together this day. He orders all things, and has given us a fine day for our Council.\\" He proceeded to count all the blessings on the day, attributing them to the Great Spirit. \\"For all these favors we thank the Great Spirit, and Him only.\\" Red Jacket said that his peoples' beliefs were very like those of the missionary, differing only in the names of their omnipresent and almighty creator. Their creation stories were the same. \\"There was a time when our forefathers owned this great island. Their seats extended from the rising to the setting sun. The Great Spirit had made it for the use of Indians. He had created the buffalo, the deer, and other animals for food . ... He had caused the earth to produce corn for bread. All this He had done for his red children, because He loved them.\\" The difference between the faiths involved not whether an almighty creator existed, but which faith was the truth and deserved to be followed. Red Jacket questioned the legitimacy of the white man's beliefs. \\"You say that you are sent to instruct us how to worship the Great Spirit agreeably to his mind, and, if we do not take hold of the religion which you white people teach, we shall be unhappy hereafter. You say that you are right and we are lost.\\" Iroquois \\"separatist\\" belief held that there is not necessarily one true religion for all people. Red Jacket acknowledged that the Americans' religious beliefs were based on a sacred text, but said, \\"If it was intended for us as well as you, why has not the Great Spirit given to us, and not only to us, but why did he not give to our forefathers, the knowledge of that book, with the means of understanding it rightly?\\" In conclusion he urged the US Senators to accept different forms of belief. \\"The Great Spirit has made us all, but He has made a great difference between his white and red children ... to you He has given the arts. To these He has not opened our eyes. We know these things to be true. Since He has made so great a difference between us in other things, why may we not conclude that he has given us a different religion according to our understanding? The Great Spirit does right. He knows what is best for his children; we are satisfied.\\" \\"We do not wish to destroy your religion, or take it from you. We only want to enjoy our own.\\" Civility In his \\"Speech to the U.S. Senate\\", Red Jacket was respectful and open-minded regarding his visitors' beliefs, hoping that his audience would respond similarly. \\"We have listened with attention to what you have said. You requested us to speak our minds freely. This gives us great joy; for we now consider that we stand upright before you, and can speak what we think.\\" He reassured his audience that he understood they were far from home, and would waste no time in giving them his answer. On the relations between his people and the first white settlers to come to their land, he said, \\"They found friends and not enemies ... they asked for a small seat. We took pity on them, granted their request; and they sat amongst us. We gave them corn and meat; they gave us poison.\\" He argued that it was wrong to portray his people as savages, when they had shown kindness but received in return only \\"poison\\" (hard liquor). Further, > Yet we did not fear them. We took them to be friends. They called us > brothers. We believed them and gave them a larger seat ... they wanted more > land; they wanted our country. Our eyes were opened, and our minds became > uneasy. You have got our country, but are not satisfied; you want to force > your religion upon us. The white settlers' actions did not encourage belief in their religion. \\"How shall we know when to believe, being so often deceived by the white people?\\" Red Jacket also acknowledged that the white settlers' religion was beset with divisive controversies, unlike his peoples' own faith. > We also have a religion, which was given to our forefathers, and has been > handed down to us their children. We worship in that way. It teaches us to > be thankful for all the favors we receive; to love each other, and to be > united. We never quarrel about religion. He wished his visitors well. \\"You have now heard our answer to your talk, and this is all we have to say at present. As we are going to part, we will come and take you by the hand, and hope the Great Spirit will protect you on your journey, and return you safe to your friends.\\" Rhetoric Red Jacket's \\"Speech to the U.S. Senate\\" expresses his ability to use a distinct form of rhetoric that distinguishes the difference in religious tolerance between the Indians and United States citizens. His emotional appeal to members of the US Senate, whom he feels are neglecting the Indians' right of religious freedom, is an example of his attempt to persuade his audience to recognize their fallacies. He repeatedly refers to the Great Spirit, who he believes oversees both the red and white man. At the beginning, he says, > But we will first look back a little, and tell you what our fathers have > told us, and what we have heard from the white people\\". Red Jacket is > referring to the history of how the white man has treated the red man on the > latter's native soil. The white man commonly tried to persuade the Indians, > whom he considered less fortunate, to adopt the ways of Western society. Red > Jacket noted the Americans had tried to force their religion on the Indian > peoples. Red Jacket recognized religion as a cultural right, but he > explained that the Indians had inherited their belief system within their > culture just as the European Americans had been given the Bible and > Christianity. He said that both people came from a similar Great Spirit, yet > it is up to the beholder as to how he accepts religion. The attempts of > Americans to force Christianity on the Indians violated the liberties of > both people. Red Jacket said, \\"You have now become a great people, and we > have scarcely a place left to spread our blankets. You have got our country, > but are not satisfied; you want to force your religion upon us. Red Jacket continues to identify the religious continuities that exist between both people with his elaboration on the Great Spirit. He states, \\"You say there is but one way to worship and serve the Great Spirit. If there is but one religion, why do you white people differ so much about it? Why not all agreed, as you can all read the book?\\". Red Jacket distinguishes the fallacies that exist between the Americans speech and their actions. If the Indians are being secularized for their religious beliefs, yet they believe in one ultimate Creator, just like the Americans, how can they be viewed as a lesser body? Red Jacket says they do not understand the Americans mission to eradicate the Indians based on religion, but Red Jacket sees the Americans as divided in their beliefs. However, he goes on to say that the Great Spirit is not one that can tear the two people apart but ultimately unite them in their ability to peacefully coexist. Red Jacket's ability to distinguish this form of religious discussion was very favorable to his legacy in history. He argues the injustices of the cultural system in the time period but does not back away from recognizing their common cultural and religious beliefs. Honors and legacy A variety of structures, ships and places were named in his honor, especially in the Finger Lakes region and Buffalo: * A complex of dormitory buildings at the University at Buffalo * Red Jacket Dining Hall at SUNY Geneseo. * The Red Jacket Building, an apartment and commercial building in Buffalo. * A memorial statue and Red Jacket Park are in Penn Yan, New York near Keuka Lake.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed May 13, 2011 tributary of the Mississippi River in the upper Midwest of the United States. Its headwaters are in southeastern Minnesota, in Mower County (Le Roy and Lodi townships) near the border with Iowa. It then flows through the Iowa counties of Hancock, Howard, Winneshiek, and Allamakee, and finally into the Upper Mississippi River. Along its course, it passes through the Iowa cities of Chester, Lime Springs, Florenceville, Kendallville, Bluffton, Decorah. Its watershed comprises nearly . The Upper Iowa and its tributaries are part of the Driftless Area of Iowa, a region that was ice-free during the last ice age. Unlike areas to the south and west, the area was not planed down by glaciation or covered in glacial drift, with the result that there are steep, high-walled canyons that little resembles what one normally sees in Iowa rivers in the western and southern regions of the state. The lack of any serious development makes this the only river in Iowa eligible for designation as a National Wild and Scenic River. It has not yet attained this status, partly because much of the land and the riverbottom itself are privately owned. It is an excellent river for canoeing, taking paddlers through the scenic bluff country. Many put their canoes in at Kendallville or down river from there, but some more intrepid paddlers prefer to start at Lime Springs by the Lidtke Mill or at Florenceville. A number of wildlife refuges and preserves dot the river's basin. Bird sightings on the river usually include bald eagles, great blue herons, turkey vultures, and barn swallows. In April 2007, the Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation announced the purchase of of additional land; currently off limits to the public, stabilization and restoration work will be done to the riverbank, with removal of non-native vegetation and replanting with more appropriate species. The Upper Iowa was sometimes historically called the \\"Iowa River\\", creating confusion with the larger Iowa River to the south. The Upper Iowa was also called the \\"Oneota River\\", and the large number of Late Prehistoric sites along its bluffs caused the early archaeologist Charles R. Keyes to name the Oneota Culture for the river.

It takes its name from Gowrie, a historical region and ancient province of Scotland. On 23 August 1581, William Ruthven, 4th Lord Ruthven, was created Earl of Gowrie by James VI, King of the Scots. He was executed for high treason, attainted and his peerages forfeited on 28 May 1584. Two years later in 1586, the attainder was reversed and his son, the second Earl, was restored as Earl of Gowrie and Lord Ruthven, but both peerages were forfeited after the alleged plot and subsequent death of the second Earl's younger brother, the third Earl, in 1600. The Ruthven family descended from Sir William Ruthven, who was created Lord Ruthven in the Peerage of Scotland in 1488. Lord Ruthven's son and heir, William Ruthven, Master of Ruthven, was one of the many Scottish nobles killed at the Battle of Flodden in 1513. Lord Ruthven died in 1528 and was succeeded by his grandson, William, the second Lord, the son of the Master of Ruthven. The second Lord was an Extraordinary Lord of Session and Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland. He was succeeded by his son, Patrick, the third Lord. Patrick was the leader of the band which murdered David Rizzio. After the murder he fled to England where he died in 1566. He was succeeded by his son, William, the aforementioned fourth Lord, who was created Earl of Gowrie in 1581 (see above). Thomas Ruthven, grandson of Alexander Ruthven of Freeland, younger son of the second Lord Ruthven, was created Lord Ruthven of Freeland in 1651. His descendant Walter Hore-Ruthven, 9th Lord Ruthven of Freeland was created Baron Ruthven of Gowrie, of Gowrie in the County of Perth, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1919. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Walter, the tenth Lord and former Major General in the British Army. On the latter's death in 1956 the Scottish lordship of Parliament devolved on his daughter, Bridget Helen Monckton, 11th Lady Ruthven, while the barony of Ruthven of Gowrie created in 1919 (which could only descend through male lines) devolved on his great-nephew, Grey Ruthven, 2nd Earl of Gowrie, who became the third Baron. Lord Gowrie was the grandson of the Honourable Alexander Hore-Ruthven, Governor-General of Australia between 1936 and 1945 and the second son of the ninth Lord Ruthven of Freeland. Alexander Hore-Ruthven had been elevated to the Peerage of the United Kingdom as Baron Gowrie, of Canberra in the Commonwealth of Australia and of Dirleton in the County of East Lothian, in 1935. In 1945 he was further honoured when he was made Viscount Ruthven of Canberra, of Dirleton in the County of East Lothian, and Earl of Gowrie in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, a revival of the earldom created for his kinsman in the 16th century. As of 2014 the titles are held by the latter's grandson, the second Earl, elder son of the Honourable Patrick Hore-Ruthven, only surviving son of the first Earl, who succeeded in 1942. He notably served in the Conservative administrations under Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s. However, he lost his seat in the House of Lords after the passage of the House of Lords Act 1999. Lord Gowrie is also Chief of the Name and Arms of Ruthven. The Earl is in remainder to the lordship of Ruthven of Freeland (now held by the Earl of Carlisle). Several other members of the Ruthven family may also be mentioned. Alexander Ruthven, third son of the first Earl of the first creation, took part in the Gowrie conspiracy of 1600, was condemned for treason and hanged, drawn and quartered. Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Brentford, was the grandson of William Ruthven, younger son of the first Lord Ruthven. Sir John Ruthven, nephew of the Earl of Brentford, was a Major- General in the Swedish Army. His son, Francis Ruthven, was created a Baronet in 1666 (see Ruthven Baronets). The Honourable Malise Ruthven, younger brother of the second Earl of Gowrie of the second creation, is a writer and historian. Arms of the Earls of Gowrie (first creation) Coat of arms The coat of arms of the first Gowrie earldom (1581 creation) was: quarterly, 1st and 4th, paly of six argent and gules (Ruthven); 2nd, barry of six or and gules (Cameron of Balledgarno); 3rd, Or, on a bend azure, three mascles or (Halyburton of Dirleton); all within a bordure or, charged with a double tressure flory counterflory gules.

History =Early years Lonely Planet was founded by married couple Maureen and Tony Wheeler. In 1972, they embarked on an overland trip through Europe and Asia to Australia, following the route of the Oxford and Cambridge Far Eastern Expedition. The company name originates from the misheard \\"lovely planet\\" in a song written by Matthew Moore. Lonely Planet's first book, Across Asia on the Cheap, had 94 pages, was written by the couple in their home. The original print run consisted of stapled booklets. Tony returned to Asia to write Across Asia on the Cheap: A Complete Guide to Making the Overland Trip, published in 1975.  Expansion  Lonely Planet's Australia guide, 16th edition (2011) The Lonely Planet guide book series initially expanded in Asia, with the India guide book in 1981, and expanded to rest of the world. Geoff Crowther was renowned for frequently inserting his opinions into the text of the guides he wrote. His writing was instrumental to the rise of Lonely Planet. The journalist used the term \\"Geoffness\\", in tribute to Crowther, to describe a quality that has been lost in travel guides. By 1999, Lonely Planet had sold 30 million copies of its travel guides. The company's authors consequently benefited from profit-sharing and expensive events were held at the Melbourne office, at which limousines would arrive, filled with Lonely Planet employees.  Wheelers' sale to BBC  In 2007, the Wheelers and John Singleton sold a 75% stake in the company to BBC Worldwide, worth an estimated ¬£63 million at the time. The company was publishing 500 titles and ventured into television production. BBC Worldwide struggled following the acquisition, registering a ¬£3.2 million loss in the year to the end of March 2009. By the end of March 2010, profits of ¬£1.9 million had been generated, as digital revenues had risen 37% year-on-year over the preceding 12 months, a Lonely Planet magazine had grown and non-print revenues increased from 9% in 2007 to 22%. Lonely Planet's digital presence included 140 apps and 8.5 million unique users for lonelyplanet.com, which hosted the Thorn Tree travel forum. BBC Worldwide acquired the remaining 25% of the company for ¬£42.1 million (A$67.2 million) from the Wheelers. BBC's sale to NC2 By 2012 BBC wanted to divest itself of the company and in March 2013 confirmed the sale of Lonely Planet to Brad Kelley's NC2 Media for US$77.8 million (¬£51.5 million), at nearly an ¬£80 million (US$118.89 million) loss. Footscray Products Lonely Planet's online community, the Thorn Tree, was created in 1996. It is named for a Naivasha thorn tree (Acacia xanthophloea) that has been used as a message board for the city of Nairobi, Kenya since 1902. The tree still exists in the Stanley Hotel, Nairobi. It is used by over 600,000 travelers to share their experiences and look for advice. Thorn Tree has many different forum categories including different countries, places to visit depending on one's interests, travel buddies, and Lonely Planet support. In 2009, Lonely Planet began publishing a monthly travel magazine called Lonely Planet Traveller. It is available in digital versions for a number of countries. Lonely Planet also had its own television production company, which has produced series, such as Globe Trekker, Lonely Planet Six Degrees, and Lonely Planet: Roads Less Travelled. Toby Amies and Asha Gill (both British TV presenters) took part in the Lonely Planet Six degrees.  Controversies  A mention in a Lonely Planet guidebook can draw large numbers of travellers, which changes places mentioned. For example, Lonely Planet has been blamed for the rise of what is sometimes referred to as 'the Banana Pancake Trail' in South East Asia. In 1996, in response to a \\"Visit Myanmar\\" campaign by the Burmese military government, the Burmese opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) and its leader Aung San Suu Kyi called for a tourism boycott. As the publication of Lonely Planet's guidebook to Myanmar (Burma) is seen by some as an encouragement to visit that country, this led to calls for a boycott of Lonely Planet. Lonely Planet's view is that it highlights the issues surrounding a visit to the country, and that it wants to make sure that readers make an informed decision. In 2009, the NLD formally dropped its previous stance and now welcomes visitors \\"who are keen to promote the welfare of the common people\\". In March 2019, Lonely Planet posted a video in Facebook falsely claiming that the Banaue Rice Terraces in the Philippines were created by \\"Chinese\\", leading to criticism. The magazine later tweeted in April 2019 that their Facebook video was indeed \\"misleading\\", and that they would update the next Philippines book edition, but will not pull out current editions that already wrongfully state that the terraces were made by the Chinese.

The name of the peerage refers to Halifax, West Yorkshire. The first three creations were for closely related male members of the Montagu family, landed gentry since the Norman Conquest, and spanned most of the years 1689‚Äì1771. The fourth creation was in 1944 for Lord Halifax, the former Viceroy of India (who was before his elevation to the earldom the 3rd Viscount Halifax). He was a prominent 1930s minister, to whom the office of prime minister was offered on the resignation of Chamberlain, which he declined in favour of Churchill. History of the title=1679 creation The first creation, in the Peerage of England in 1679, was for George Savile, 1st Viscount Halifax. He had already been made Baron Savile of Elland and Viscount Halifax in 1668, and was later made Marquess of Halifax (this creation of the earldom became extinct in 1700; see Marquess of Halifax for more information). 1714 creation The title was recreated in 1714 for Charles Montagu, 1st Baron Halifax, First Lord of the Treasury to George I, along with the courtesy title of Viscount Sunbury. Both titles were created with remainder to heirs male. A member of the prominent Montagu family, he was the son of George Montagu, younger son of Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester (see the Duke of Manchester). Montagu had already been created Baron Halifax, of Halifax in the County of York, in 1700, with remainder, failing heirs male of his own, to his nephew George, son and heir of his brother Edward Montagu. 1715 creation On Lord Halifax's death in 1715 the viscountcy and earldom became extinct. He was succeeded in the barony according to the special remainder by his nephew George Montagu. Less than a month after his uncle's death, both titles were revived in his favour, making him Earl of Halifax and Viscount Sunbury. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl, who was a prominent statesman. However, on his death in 1771 all the titles became extinct. 1944 creation The title was created for a fourth time in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1944 for Edward Wood, 3rd Viscount Halifax, the former Foreign Secretary and former Viceroy of India. The Wood family descends from Francis Wood, of Barnsley. His second son, Francis Wood, was created a baronet, of Barnsley in the County of York, in 1784, with remainder to his elder brother the Reverend Henry Wood, and failing him to the sons of his younger brother Charles Wood. He was succeeded according to the special remainder by his nephew, the second Baronet (the son of Charles Wood). His son, the third Baronet, was a prominent Liberal politician and served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1846 to 1852, during which he became notorious for the policies he followed during the Great Famine in Ireland. In 1866 he was created Viscount Halifax, of Monk Bretton in the West Riding of the County of York, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. His aforementioned grandson, the third Viscount, was also a noted politician. In 1925, nine years before he succeeded his father, he was himself raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom as Baron Irwin, of Kirby Underdale in the County of York. In 1944 he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Halifax. the titles are held by his grandson, the third Earl, who succeeded his father in 1980. Another member of the Wood family was the Conservative politician Richard Wood, Baron Holderness. He was the second son of the first Earl of Halifax.

She has been a participant in the Surrealist group founded by Andre Breton since 1965. With Franklin Rosemont, Bernard Marszalek, Robert Green and Tor Faegre, she established the Chicago Surrealist Group in 1966. She was in 1964-1966 a member of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), commonly known as the Wobblies, and was part of the national staff of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) in 1967-68. Her influences include Andre Breton and Guy Debord of the Situationist International, Emma Goldman and Lucy Parsons.Rosemont, Frankin, Penelope Rosemont, and Paul Garon. The Forecast is Hot! Tracts and Other Declarations of the Surrealist Movement in the United States, 1966-1976. Black Swan Press, 1977, p. 173. Visual Art In 1986, Penelope Rosemont‚Äôs painting the ‚ÄúMarriage of Heaven and Hell‚Äù was included in the Venice Biennale, selected by Arturo Schwartz to be in the Art and Alchemy section. A painter, photographer, and collagist, Rosemont is credited with having invented a number of surrealist collage methods including the \\"landscapade\\" and \\"insect music\\" [in which cut-out shapes are placed on the background of a musical score]. Rosemont is a writer and graphic designer for Arsenal/Surrealist Subversion and other publications. Her painting The Night Time is the Right Time \\"was selected by the Chicago Jazz Institute for the 2000 Chicago Jazz Festival T-shirt\\". A number of Rosemont's drawings and artwork appear in her books and are particularly abundant in Surrealist Experiences: 1001 Dawns, 221 Midnights. Surrealism in and outside of Chicago The Rosemonts write with enthusiasm about their meeting with Andre Breton and Surrealist group members during a stay in Paris in December 1965- May 1966. Penelope writes about this important period in her life in the books Surrealist Experiences: 1001 Dawns, 221 Midnights and in her autobiographical work Dreams and Everyday Life: Andre Breton, Surrealism, Rebel Worker, SDS, & the Seven Cities of Cibola, A 1960s Notebook while Franklin discusses it in his book, An Open Entrance into the Shut Palace of Wrong Numbers. In the Surrealist Experiences, Penelope Rosemont writes about a nascent group of Surrealists that had already formed in Chicago, the Rebel Worker group, before they met Breton and in fact, this was the impetus to go to Paris, to meet the Surrealists they had been corresponding with. She writes that the initial plan was to go to London first and then to Paris. She writes \\"thanks to a mean- spirited British immigration bureaucrat,\\" they were deported to Paris. That event was fortuitous because the surrealist exhibition L‚ÄôEcart absolu was taking place at the time; she attended a New Years Eve party organized by surrealists;and she was able to talk with Breton before he \\"became seriously ill a few months later.\\"Rosemont, Penelope. Surrealist Experiences: 1001 Dawns, 221 Midnights. Black Swan Press, 2000. p. 1-2. The Rosemonts are referenced in Helena Lewis' 1988 book on Surrealism and Politics, Dada Turns Red.. There, Lewis wrote: \\"There was also a group of young people in Chicago in the late 1960s who made a connection between Surrealism and the old IWW, The Rebel Worker in which translations of Surrealist writing appeared . . . and they also published an art anthology of Surrealist political texts, in which the editor, Franklin Rosemont, explained how Surrealism was relevant to his movement.\\" Lewis, Helena. Dada Turns Red: The Politics of Surrealism. Edinburgh University Press, 1988. p. 172. In his book Freedom Dreams published in Boston, 2002 Robin D.G. Kelley writes ‚Äúmy search for an even more elaborate, complete dream of freedom...thanks to the many wonderful chance encounters with Franklin Rosemont, Penelope Rosemont, Ted Joans, Laura Corsiglia and Jayne Cortez, I discovered surrealism...right under my nose, so to speak, buried in the rich black soil of Afrodiasporic culture.‚Äù p. 4 The Chicago Surrealist group, under their imprint Black Swan Press, published the journal Arsenal/Surrealist Subversion sporadically from 1970 to 1989 which featured the work of Richard Huelsenbeck, Andre Breton, Georges Bataille, Ted Joans Jayne Cortez and many other Surrealists, well-known and lesser known. Franklin and Penelope Rosemont were on the editorial board, along with (for issue 4), co-editors Paul Garon, Joseph Jablonski and Philip Lamantia. Books: Poetry, Memoirs, History Penelope Rosemont is the editor and wrote extensive introductions for her book Surrealist Women: An International Anthology (University of Texas, 1998), a book of over 500 pages of writing and art by women in the Surrealist movement, both past and present, dating back to the beginnings of Surrealism in the 1920s. It features Meret Oppenheim, Mary Low, Leonora Carrington, Nancy Cunard, Frida Kahlo, Dorothea Tanning, Elisa Breton, Kay Sage, Jayne Cortez, Rikki Ducornet and over one hundred more.

Earl Peel is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The Peel family descends from Robert Peel, eldest son of a wealthy cotton merchant. The family lands, known as Drayton Manor, in the County of Stafford would become more commonly known in modern-day as an amusement park. The family seat is Elmire House, near Ripon, North Yorkshire. History The earldom was created in 1929 for the Conservative Party politician William Wellesley Peel, 2nd Viscount Peel, who was Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster 1921‚Äì22, Secretary of State for India 1921‚Äì22 and 1928‚Äì29, and First Commissioner of Works 1924-28. At the same time, he was created Viscount Clanfield, of Clanfield in the County of Southampton, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was the son of Arthur Wellesley Peel, 1st Viscount Peel, who served as Speaker of the House of Commons between 1884 and 1895, and was created Viscount Peel, of Sandy in the County of Bedford, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1895. The first Viscount Peel was the fifth son of Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel, 2nd Baronet, of Drayton Manor (see below for earlier history of the family). The first Earl was succeeded by his son, Arthur Peel, 2nd Earl Peel. In 1942, he succeeded his second cousin once removed as seventh Baronet, of Drayton Manor. The second Earl later served as Lord-Lieutenant of Lancashire from 1948 to 2 January 1951. the titles are held by his son, William Peel, 3rd Earl Peel, who succeeded in 1969. He is one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999, and sits as a cross-bencher. The third Earl was Lord Warden of the Stannaries from 1994 to 2006 and is Lord Chamberlain of the Household since 2006. The Peel family descends from Robert Peel, who established a calico-printing firm in Blackburn in 1764. His eldest son Robert Peel was a wealthy cotton merchant and also sat as Member of Parliament for Tamworth from 1790 to 1818. In 1800 he was created a Baronet, of Drayton Manor in the County of Stafford and of Bury in the County Palatine of Lancaster, in the Baronetage of Great Britain. He was succeeded by his eldest son Sir Robert Peel, 2nd Baronet, the noted statesman. He was Home Secretary 1822‚Äì27 and 1828‚Äì30, Chancellor of the Exchequer 1834‚Äì35 and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom 1834‚Äì35 and 1841‚Äì46 and is best remembered for creating the modern concept of the police force while Home Secretary. The police, first known as Peelers, are still commonly referred to as Bobbies, in his name. He is also known for overseeing the formation of the Conservative Party out of the shattered Tory Party, and for the repeal of the Corn Laws. Peel died after a fall from his horse on Constitution Hill in London. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the third Baronet. He was also a politician and served as a Lord of the Admiralty from 1852 to 1857 and as Chief Secretary for Ireland from 1861 to 1865. His grandson, the fifth Baronet, married the actress and comedian Beatrice Gladys Lillie. Their only son, the sixth Baronet, was an ordinary seaman in the Royal Navy and was killed in action in April 1942, aged only twenty-one. On his death the line of the eldest son of the second Baronet failed and the title was inherited by his second cousin once removed, the second Earl Peel, who became the seventh Baronet.

He was born in Kansas City, Missouri, but spent most of his career based in Chicago, Illinois, although gigs sometimes took him to New York City, around the U.S. Midwest, and he also took a job in Florida with Charlie Straight. Career Strongly influenced by cornetist Bix Beiderbecke, he was mainly self-taught on his instruments; early on he also doubled on violin and banjo. He started playing the clarinet professionally in 1925. He began recording under his own name in 1928 and made what are believed to be his final recordings two years later, although there is now reason to believe (via sine wave recording research, aka Smith/Westbrook Method) that he appeared on unidentified recordings as late as 1932. His intense solo work laid the groundwork for a rich sound and creative approach, that is credited with influencing a young Benny Goodman and a style of which Pee Wee Russell is perhaps the best-known representative. He also made recordings on the saxophone. Late in his career, he returned to playing violin with Jan Garber's sweet dance orchestra, trying to earn a living in the midst of the Great Depression. Although he was well known in the world of jazz, he did not live to enjoy popular success in the swing era. He was killed in an automobile accident on the morning of March 1, 1932, a passenger in a car driven by his performing associate cornetist \\"Wild\\" Bill Davison; it was several days short of what would have been his 26th birthday.

He was found guilty by a jury trial held in the Supreme Judicial Court of Suffolk County in December 1874. Background Jesse Harding Pomeroy was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts, to Thomas J. Pomeroy and Ruth Ann Snowman. He was the second of two children; his brother Charles Jefferson Pomeroy was two years older. Thomas J. Pomeroy (1835‚Äì1898) was a veteran of the U.S. Civil War. Reported attacks in 1871‚Äì1872 From 1871‚Äì1872, there were reports that several young boys were individually enticed to remote areas and attacked by a slightly older boy. However, noone was ever arrested. The attacks were noteworthy because of the extreme amount of brutality used by the assailant. The young boys were beaten with a fist and a belt and, in at least two of the attacks, a knife. Some of the boys were physically scarred permanently. In 1872, Ruth and the two children moved to South Boston. Pomeroy's attacks on young boys continued, and he was finally arrested and his case heard in front of a Juvenile Court judge. Pomeroy was found guilty and sentenced to the State Reform School for Boys at Westborough, Massachusetts, for his minority (i.e., until he turned 18). The Boston Globe covered this story; the last line of the article: \\"It is generally concluded that the boy is mentally deficient.\\" The crime Reward poster issued by the City of Boston for information about Katie Curran's abductor In February 1874, at the age of 14, Pomeroy was paroled back to his mother and brother in South Boston. His mother ran her own dressmaking shop, and his brother Charles sold newspapers. In March 1874, a ten-year-old girl from South Boston named Katie Curran went missing. On April 22, 1874, the mutilated body of four-year-old Horace Millen was found on the marsh of Dorchester Bay. Immediately, the police detectives sought out Pomeroy, despite lacking evidence implicating him in the crime. The body of Katie Curran was found later, in the basement of Pomeroy's mother's dress shop. Her remains were hastily and carelessly concealed in an ash heap. The trial Pomeroy was taken to view Millen's body and asked if he committed the murder. At the coroner's inquest, Pomeroy was denied the right to counsel. The case of Commonwealth v. Pomeroy was heard in the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (Suffolk County, Boston) on December 9 and December 10, 1874. At the trial, the Attorney General argued for a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree. In his closing arguments, he urged an alternative charge of murder with extreme atrocity, which, according to Massachusetts law, is first-degree murder, but differs from the original charge in the requirement of premeditation. Pomeroy was pronounced guilty on December 10, 1874, with the jury's recommendation of mercy on account of the prisoner's youth. Pomeroy's attorney, Charles Robinson, filed two exceptions which were overruled in February 1875, at which point Pomeroy was sentenced to death by hanging. After the trial Charlestown State Prison, as depicted in 1840 It remained for the Governor to sign the death warrant and assign a date for Pomeroy's execution. However, Governor William Gaston refused to comply with this executive responsibility. The only legal means of sparing Pomeroy's life was through the Massachusetts Governor's Council, and only if a simple majority of the nine-member Council voted to commute the death penalty. Over the next year and a half, the Council voted three times: the first two votes upheld Pomeroy's execution, and both times Governor Gaston refused to sign the death warrant. In August 1876, the Council took a third vote, anonymously, and Pomeroy's sentence was commuted to life in prison in solitary confinement. On the evening of September 7, 1876, Pomeroy was transferred from the Suffolk County Jail to the State Prison at Charlestown, and began his life in solitary. He was 16 years and 9 months old. Pomeroy remained incarcerated at the Charlestown State Prison.Gribben, Mark. \\"Jesse Harding Pomeroy.\\" Crime Library. 17. Resurrection. Retrieved on November 27, 2010. In prison, Pomeroy claimed that he taught himself to read several foreign languages, including Hebrew; and one visiting psychiatrist found that he had learned German with \\"considerable accuracy\\". He wrote poetry and argued with prison officials over his right to have it published, and he studied law books and spent decades composing legal challenges to his conviction and requests for a pardon. A psychiatric report on Pomeroy made in 1914, and quoted extensively in The Boston Globe after his death, noted that Pomeroy had made 10 or 12 \\"determined attempts\\" to escape and that handmade tools were frequently found in his possession. A prison warden reported finding rope, steel pens, and a drill that Pomeroy had concealed in his cell or on his person. According to The Globe, Pomeroy lost an eye after attempting to destroy the side of his cell by redirecting a gas pipe. The 1914 psychiatric report claimed that Pomeroy had shown the \\"greatest ingenuity and a persistence which is unprecedented in the history of the prison.\\" In 1917, with the support of District Attorney Joseph Pelletier, Pomeroy's sentence was commuted to the extent of allowing him the privileges afforded to other life prisoners. At first he resisted, wanting nothing less than a pardon. He eventually adjusted to his changed circumstances and appeared in a minstrel show at the prison. In 1929, by this time an elderly man in frail health, he was transferred to Bridgewater Hospital for the Criminally Insane, where he died on September 29, 1932.

During the early 19th century, it was also known as chessylite, after the type locality at Chessy-les-Mines near Lyon, France. The mineral, a basic carbonate with the chemical formula Cu3(CO3)2(OH)2, has been known since ancient times, and was mentioned in Pliny the Elder's Natural History under the Greek name (Œ∫œÖŒ±ŒΩœåœÇ: \\"deep blue,\\" root of English cyan) and the Latin name caeruleum.The Ancient Library: Smith, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, p.321, right col., under BLUE Since antiquity, azurite's exceptionally deep and clear blue has been associated with low-humidity desert and winter skies. The modern English name of the mineral reflects this association, since both azurite and azure are derived via Arabic from the Persian (ŸÑÿß⁄òŸàÿ±ÿØ), an area known for its deposits of another deep-blue stone, lapis lazuli (\\"stone of azure\\"). Mineralogy Chemical structure of azurite. Color code: red = O, green = Cu, gray = C, white = H) Azurite is one of two basic copper(II) carbonate minerals, the other being bright green malachite. Simple copper carbonate (CuCO3) is not known to exist in nature. Azurite has the formula Cu3(CO3)2(OH)2, with the copper(II) cations linked to two different anions, carbonate and hydroxide. Small crystals of azurite can be produced by rapidly stirring a few drops of copper sulfate solution into a saturated solution of sodium carbonate and allowing the solution to stand overnight. Azurite crystals are monoclinic. Large crystals are dark blue, often prismatic.Hurlbut, Cornelius S.; Klein, Cornelis, 1985, Manual of Mineralogy, 20th ed., Wiley, Azurite specimens can be massive to nodular. They are often stalactitic in form. Specimens tend to lighten in color over time due to weathering of the specimen surface into malachite. Azurite is soft, with a Mohs hardness of only 3.5 to 4. The specific gravity of azurite is 3.77 to 3.89. Azurite is destroyed by heat, losing carbon dioxide and water to form black, copper(II) oxide powder. Characteristic of a carbonate, specimens effervesce upon treatment with hydrochloric acid. Color The optical properties (color, intensity) of minerals such as azurite and malachite are characteristic of copper(II). Many coordination complexes of copper(II) exhibit similar colors. As explained within the context of crystal field theory, the color results from low energy d-d transitions associated with the d9 metal center. Weathering Azurite is unstable in open air compared to malachite, and often is pseudomorphically replaced by malachite. This weathering process involves the replacement of some of the carbon dioxide (CO2) units with water (H2O), changing the carbonate:hydroxide ratio of azurite from 1:1 to the 1:2 ratio of malachite: : 2 Cu3(CO3)2(OH)2 \\\\+ H2O ‚Üí 3 Cu2(CO3)(OH)2 \\\\+ CO2 From the above equation, the conversion of azurite into malachite is attributable to the low partial pressure of carbon dioxide in air. Azurite is also incompatible with aquatic media, such as saltwater aquariums. Uses=Pigments Azurite is unstable in air. However it was used as a blue pigment in antiquity.Gettens, R.J. and Fitzhugh, E.W., Azurite and Blue Verditer, in Artists‚Äô Pigments. A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, Vol. 2: A. Roy (Ed.) Oxford University Press 1993, p. 23‚Äì24 Azurite is naturally occurring in Sinai and the Eastern Desert of Egypt. It was reported by F. C. J. Spurrell (1895) in the following examples; a shell used as a pallet in a Fourth Dynasty (2613 to 2494 BCE) context in Meidum, a cloth over the face of a Fifth Dynasty (2494 to 2345 BCE) mummy also at Meidum and a number of Eighteenth Dynasty (1543‚Äì1292 BCE) wall paintings. Depending on the degree of fineness to which it was ground, and its basic content of copper carbonate, it gave a wide range of blues. It has been known as mountain blue or Armenian stone, in addition it was formerly known as Azurro Della Magna (from Italian). When mixed with oil it turns slightly green. When mixed with egg yolk it turns green-grey. It is also known by the names blue bice and blue verditer, though verditer usually refers to a pigment made by chemical process. Older examples of azurite pigment may show a more greenish tint due to weathering into malachite. Much azurite was mislabeled lapis lazuli, a term applied to many blue pigments. As chemical analysis of paintings from the Middle Ages improves, azurite is being recognized as a major source of the blues used by medieval painters. Lapis lazuli (the pigment ultramarine) was chiefly supplied from Afghanistan during the Middle Ages, whereas azurite was a common mineral in Europe at the time. Sizable deposits were found near Lyons, France. It was mined since the 12th century in Saxony, in the silver mines located there.Andersen, Frank J. Riches of the Earth. W.H. Smith Publishers, New York, 1981, Heating can be used to distinguish azurite from purified natural ultramarine blue, a more expensive but more stable blue pigment, as described by Cennino D'Andrea Cennini. Ultramarine withstands heat, whereas azurite converts to black copper oxide. However, gentle heating of azurite produces a deep blue pigment used in Japanese painting techniques. File:Azuritepigment.jpgGround azurite for use as a pigment File:Lady with a Squirrel.jpgThe background of Lady with a Squirrel by Hans Holbein the Younger was painted with Azurite File:Madonna and Child Enthroned with Saints.jpgThe greenish tint of the Madonna's mantle in Raphael's Madonna and Child Enthroned with Saints is due to azurite weathering to malachite Jewelry Azurite is used occasionally as beads and as jewelry, and also as an ornamental stone. However, its softness and tendency to lose its deep blue color as it weathers limit such uses. Heating destroys azurite easily, so all mounting of azurite specimens must be done at room temperature. Collecting The intense color of azurite makes it a popular collector's stone. However, bright light, heat, and open air all tend to reduce the intensity of its color over time. To help preserve the deep blue color of a pristine azurite specimen, collectors should use a cool, dark, sealed storage environment similar to that of its original natural setting. Prospecting While not a major ore of copper itself, the presence of azurite is a good surface indicator of the presence of weathered copper sulfide ores. It is usually found in association with the chemically similar malachite, producing a striking color combination of deep blue and bright green that is strongly indicative of the presence of copper ores. History The use of azurite and malachite as copper ore indicators led indirectly to the name of the element nickel in the English language. Nickeline, a principal ore of nickel that is also known as niccolite, weathers at the surface into a green mineral (annabergite) that resembles malachite. This resemblance resulted in occasional attempts to smelt nickeline in the belief that it was copper ore, but such attempts always ended in failure due to high smelting temperatures needed to reduce nickel. In Germany this deceptive mineral came to be known as kupfernickel, literally \\"copper demon.\\" The Swedish alchemist Baron Axel Fredrik Cronstedt (who had been trained by Georg Brandt, the discoverer of the nickel-like metal cobalt) realized that there was probably a new metal hiding within the kupfernickel ore, and in 1751 he succeeded in smelting kupfernickel to produce a previously unknown (except in certain meteorites) silvery white, iron-like metal. Logically, Cronstedt named his new metal after the nickel part of kupfernickel.

He was Home Secretary from 1835 to 1839, Foreign Secretary from 1852 to 1853 and 1859 to 1865 and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1846 to 1852 and 1865 to 1866. At the same time as he was given the earldom of Russell, he was made Viscount Amberley, of Amberley in the County of Gloucester and of Ardsalla in the County of Meath. A member of the prominent Russell family, he was the third son of John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford. John Russell, 1st Earl Russell The first Earl was succeeded by his grandson the second Earl, the eldest son of John Russell, Viscount Amberley. He was one of the first peers to join the Labour Party and he held office under Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald as Under-Secretary of State for India from 1929 to 1931. He was childless and was succeeded in 1931 by his younger brother, the third Earl, the famous philosopher and Nobel Prize winner universally known as Bertrand Russell. When he died in 1970 his eldest son, the fourth Earl held the title until his half-brother, the fifth Earl inherited it in 1987. He was a noted historian of 17th century England. Russell also sat on the Liberal Democrat benches in the House of Lords and was one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that were allowed to remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999. the titles are held by his youngest son, the seventh Earl, who succeeded his brother in 2014.

Life  Carrington was born at Chelsea, the second son of Richard Carrington, the proprietor of a large brewery at Brentford, and his wife Esther Clarke Aplin. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1844; but, though destined for the church, rather by his father's than by his own desire, his scientific tendencies gradually prevailed, and received a final impulse towards practical astronomy from Professor Challis's lectures on the subject. This change in the purpose of his life was unopposed, and he had the prospect of ample means; so that it was purely with the object of gaining experience that he applied, shortly after taking his degree as thirty-sixth wrangler in 1848, for the post of observer in the University of Durham. He entered upon his duties there in October 1849, but soon became dissatisfied with their narrow scope. The observatory was ill supplied with instruments, and the leisure left him for study served only to widen his aims. Friedrich Bessel's and Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander's star- zones, above all, struck him as a model for imitation, and he resolved to complete by extending them to the pole. Desirous of advancing so far beyond his predecessors as to include in his survey stars of the tenth magnitude, he vainly applied for a suitable instrument, and at last, hopeless of accomplishing any part of his design at Durham, or of benefiting by any further stay, he resigned his position there in March 1852. He had not, however, been idle. Some of his observations, especially of minor planets and comets, made with a Fraunhofer equatorial of 6¬Ω inches aperture, had been published, in a provisional state, in the ‚ÄòMonthly Notices‚Äô and ‚ÄòAstronomische Nachrichten,‚Äô and the whole were definitively embodied in a volume entitled ‚ÄòResults of Astronomical Observations made at the Observatory of the University, Durham, from October 1849 to April 1852‚Äô (Durham, 1855). His admission as a member of the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS), 14 March 1851, conveyed a prompt recognition of his exceptional merits as an observer. Carrington's house and observatory on Furze Hill, Redhill, Surrey (between 1852 and 1857) In June 1852 he fixed upon a site for an observatory and dwelling-house at Redhill, Surrey. In July 1853 a transit-circle of 5¬Ω feet focus, reduced in scale from the Greenwich model, and an equatorial of 4¬Ω inches aperture, both by Simms, were in their places, and work was begun. On 9 December 1853, Carrington presented to the RAS, as the result of a preliminary survey, printed copies of nine draft maps, containing all stars down to the eleventh magnitude within 9¬∞ of the Pole (Monthly Notices, xiv. 40). Three years' steady pursuance of the adopted plan produced, in 1857, ‚ÄòA Catalogue of 3,735 Circumpolar Stars observed at Redhill in the years 1854, 1855, and 1856, and reduced to Mean Positions for 1855.‚Äô The work was printed at public expense, the decision to that effect by the Lords of the Admiralty rendering unnecessary the acceptance of Leverrier's handsome offer to include it in the next forthcoming volume of the ‚ÄòAnnales‚Äô of the Paris observatory. It was rewarded with the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society, in presenting which, 11 February 1859, Mr. Main dwelt upon the eminent utility of the design, as well as the ‚Äòstandard excellence‚Äô of its execution (ib. xix. 162). It included a laborious comparison of Schwerd's places for 680 stars with those obtained at Redhill, and an elaborate dissertation on the whole theory of corrections as applied to stars near the pole. Ten corresponding maps, copper-engraved, accompanied the catalogue. Meanwhile, Carrington had adopted, and was cultivating with his usual felicity of treatment, a ‚Äòsecond subject‚Äô at that juncture of peculiar interest and importance. While his new observatory was in course of construction, he devoted some of his spare time to examining the drawings and records of sun-spots in possession of the RAS, and was much struck with the need and scarcity of systematic solar observations. Sabine's and Wolf's discovery of the coincidence between the magnetic and sunspot periods had just then been announced, and he believed he should be able to take advantage of the pre-occupation or inability of other observers to appropriate to himself, by ‚Äòclose and methodical research,‚Äô the next ensuing eleven-year cycle. He accordingly resolved to devote his daylight energies to the sun, while reserving his nights for the stars. Solar physics as a whole, however, he prudently excluded from his field of view. He limited his task to fixing the true period of the sun's rotation (of which curiously discrepant values had been obtained), to tracing the laws of distribution of macul√¶, and investigating the existence of permanent surface-currents. Adequately to compass these ends, new devices of observation, reduction, and comparison were required. Leaving photography to his successors as too undeveloped for immediate use, he chose a method founded on the idea of making the solar disc its own circular micrometer. An image of the sun was thrown upon a screen placed at such a distance from the eyepiece of the 4¬Ω-inch equatoreal as to give to the disc a diameter of 12 to 14 inches. In the focus of the telescope, which was firmly clamped, two bars of flattened gold wire were fastened at right angles to each other, and inclined about 45¬∞ on either side of the meridian. Then, as the inverted image traversed the screen, the instants of contact with the wires of the sun's limbs and of the spot-nucleus to be measured were severally noted, when an easy calculation gave its heliocentric position (ib. xiv. 153). In this manner, during seven and a half years, 5,290 observations were made of 954 separate groups, many of which were besides accurately depicted in drawings. By the sudden death of his father, however, in July 1858, and the consequent devolution upon Carrington of the management of the brewery, the complete execution of his project of research was frustrated. He continued for some time to supervise the solar work he had previously carried on in person; but in March 1861, seeing no prospect of release from commercial engagements, he thought it advisable to close the series. The results appeared in a quarto volume, the publication of which was aided by a grant from the Royal Society. Its title ran as follows: Observations of the Spots on the Sun from November 9, 1853, to March 24, 1861, made at Redhill (London, 1863). Never were data more opportunely furnished. Perhaps more effectually than the pronouncements of spectrum analysis, they served to revolutionise ideas on solar physics. Efforts to ascertain the true rate of solar rotation had been continually baffled by what were called the ‚Äòproper motions‚Äô of the spots serving as indexes to it. Carrington showed that these were in reality due to a great ‚Äòbodily drift‚Äô of the photosphere, diminishing apparently from the equator to the poles (ib. xix. 81). There was, then, no single period ascertainable through observations of the solar surface. By equatorial spots the circuit was found to be performed in about two and a half days less than by spots at the (ordinarily) extreme north and south limits of 45¬∞. The assumed ‚Äòmean period‚Äô of 25.38 solar days applied, in fact, only to two zones 14¬∞ from the equator; nearer to it the time of rotation was shorter, further from it longer, than the average. Carrington succeeded in representing the daily movement of a spot in any heliographical latitude l, by the empirical expression 865‚Ä≤ ¬± 165 . sin 7/4 (l ‚Äì 1¬∞). But he attempted no explanation of the phenomenon. It formed, however, the basis of Faye's theory (1865) of the sun as a gaseous body ploughed through by vertical currents, which finally superseded Herschel's idea of a flame-enveloped, but cool, dark, and even habitable globe. Carrington's determinations of the elements of the sun's rotation are still of standard authority. The inclination of the solar equator to the plane of the ecliptic he fixed at 7¬∞ 15‚Ä≤; the longitude of the ascending node at 73¬∞ 40‚Ä≤ (both for 1850) . A peculiarity in the distribution of sun-spots detected by him about the time of the minimum of 1856, afforded, as he said, ‚Äòan instructive instance of the regular irregularity and the irregular regularity‚Äô characterising solar phenomena (ib. xix. 1). As the minimum approached, the belts of disturbance gradually contracted towards and died out near the equator; shortly after which two fresh series broke out, as if by a completely new impulse, in comparatively high latitudes, and spread equatorially. No satisfactory rationale of this curious procedure has yet been arrived at. It is, nevertheless, intimately related to the course of sun-spot development, since Wolf found evidence of a similar behaviour in B√∂hm's observations of 1833‚Äì6, and it was perceived by Sp√∂rer and Secchi to recur in 1867. While still in his apprenticeship at Durham, Carrington repaired to Sweden on the occasion of the total solar eclipse of 28 July 1851, and made at Lilla Edet, on the G√∂ta river, observations printed in the Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society (xxi. 58). The experience thus gained was turned to public account in the compilation of Information and Suggestions addressed to Persons who may be able to place themselves within the Shadow of the Total Eclipse of the Sun on September 7, 1858, a brochure printed and circulated by the lords of the admiralty in May 1858. The eclipse to which it referred was visible in South America. Besides his friend, Mr. Hodgson, he was the sole witness of the extraordinary solar outburst of 1 September 1859. His account of an observation memorable in the history of solar physics is contained in the ‚ÄòMonthly Notices‚Äô for November 1859 (xx. 13). A visit to the continent in 1856 gave him the opportunity of drawing up a valuable report on the condition of a number of German observatories (Monthly Notices, xvii. 43), and of visiting Schwabe at Dessau, to whose merits he drew explicit attention, and to whom, in the following year, he had the pleasure of transmitting the Gold Medal of the RAS. He fulfilled with great diligence the duties of secretary to that body, 1857‚Äì62, and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 7 June 1860. But the lease by which he held his powers of useful work was unhappily running out. A severe attack of illness in 1865 left his health permanently impaired. In 1869, he married Rosa Ellen Jeffries (1845‚Äì75), and, having disposed of the brewery, he retired to Churt, Surrey, where, on the top of an isolated conical hill, 60 feet high, locally known as the Middle Devil's Jump, in a lonely and picturesque spot, he built a new observatory (ib. xxx. 43). Its chief instrument was a large altazimuth on Steinheil's principle, but there are no records of observations made with it. He no longer attended the meetings of the RAS, and his last communication to it, 10 January 1873, was on the subject of a ‚Äòdouble altazimuth‚Äô of great size which he had thoughts of erecting (ib. xxxiii. 118). A deplorable tragedy, however, supervened. On the morning of 17 November 1875 his wife was found dead in her bed, as it seemed, through an overdose of chloral. The event, combined perhaps with the censure on a supposed deficiency of proper nursing precautions conveyed by the verdict of the coroner's jury, told heavily on her husband's spirits. He left his house on the day of the inquest, and returned to it after a week's absence, only to find it deserted by his servants. He was seen to enter it on 27 November, but was never again seen alive. After a time some neighbour gave the alarm, the doors were broken open, and his dead body was found extended on a mattress locked into a remote apartment. A poultice of tea-leaves was tied over the left ear, as if for the relief of pain, and a post-mortem examination showed death to have resulted from an effusion of blood on the brain. A verdict of ‚Äòsudden death from natural causes‚Äô was returned. Thus closed a life which had not yet lasted fifty years, and held the promise of even more than it had already performed. Legacy Carrington's manuscript books of sun-spot observations and reductions, with a folio volume of drawings, were purchased after his death by Lord Lindsay (later Earl of Crawford), and presented to the Royal Astronomical Society (ib. xxxvi. 249). To the same body Carrington bequeathed a sum of ¬£2,000. Among his numerous contributions to scientific collections may be mentioned a paper ‚ÄòOn the Distribution of the Perihelia of the Parabolic and Hyperbolic Comets in relation to the Motion of the Solar System in Space,‚Äô read before the Astronomical Society, 14 December 1860 (Mem. R. A. Soc. xxix. 355). The result, like that of Mohn's contemporaneous investigation, proved negative, and was thought to be, through uncontrolled conditions, nugatory; yet it perhaps conveyed an important truth as to the original connection of comets with the solar system.  Work  Even though he did not discover the 11-year sunspot activity cycle, Carrington's observations of sunspot activity after he heard about Heinrich Schwabe's work led to the numbering of the cycles with Carrington's name. For example, the sunspot maximum of 2002 was Carrington Cycle No. 23. Carrington also determined the elements of the rotation axis of the Sun, based on sunspot motions, and his results remain in use today. Carrington rotation is a system for measuring solar longitude based on his observations of the low-latitude solar rotation rate. Carrington made the initial observations leading to the establishment of Sp√∂rer's law. Carrington won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) in 1859. Carrington also won the Lalande Prize of the French Academy of Sciences in 1864, for his Observations of Spots on the Sun from 9 November 1853 to 24 March 1861, Made at Redhill. This award was not reported in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, probably due to Carrington's bitter, acrimonious and public criticism of Cambridge University over the appointment of John Couch Adams, Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry, as the non-observing Director of the Cambridge Observatory. As a measure of displeasure Carrington withdrew Observations from official considerations of the RAS for what would likely have been the book's second gold medal, for the year 1865. Carrington super flare Sunspots of 1 September 1859 as sketched by Richard Carrington On 1 September 1859, Carrington and Richard Hodgson, another English amateur astronomer, independently made the first observations of a solar flare. Because of a simultaneous \\"crochet\\" observed in the Kew Observatory magnetometer record by Balfour Stewart and a geomagnetic storm observed the following day, Carrington suspected a solar-terrestrial connection. Worldwide reports on the effects of the geomagnetic storm of 1859 were compiled and published by Elias Loomis which support the observations of Carrington and Balfour Stewart. For this reason, the geomagnetic storm of 1859 is often called the Carrington event.

They are found in scrub and _moist_ forest mainly in hilly regions. They forage in small groups on the forest floor, turning around leaf litter to find their prey and usually staying low in the undergrowth where they can be hard to spot. They however have loud and distinct calls, including a morning song, contact and alarm calls. It is the type species of the genus Pellorneum which may however currently include multiple lineages. Description Adult in Kaziranga National Park, possibly of ssp. mandelli thumbleft Near Kaeng Krachen Nat‚Äôl Park' - Thailand Puff- throated babblers are brown above, and white below with heavily brown streaks towards the breast and belly. They have a chestnut crown, long buff supercilium and dusky cheeks. The throat is white, and is sometimes puffed out giving it the English name. Puff-throated babblers have strong legs, and spend a lot of time on the forest floor. They can often be seen creeping through undergrowth in search of their insect food, looking at first glance like a song thrush. Some subspecies have streaks on the mantle while others, especially in Peninsular India, are unstreaked. The widespread distribution with population variations has led to nearly thirty subspecies being described. The nominate population is found in peninsular India (excluding the Western Ghats). The population in the northern Eastern Ghats is paler and has been called as pallidum while a well marked dark form occurs in the southern Western Ghats which has been named granti (includes olivaceum). The western Himalayas population is punctatum (includes jonesi) and in the east is mandellii which has streaking on the back and nape apart from having call differences. In the east of India, south of the Brahmaputra River occurs chamelum while ripley is found in a small region in eastern Assam (Margherita). Further east in Manipur is vocale and pectorale in Arunachal Pradesh and northern Burma with stageri further south, followed by hilarum, victoriae and minus. Further east are found shanense, subochraceum, insularum, indistinctum, chtonium, elbeli, acrum, oreum, dusiti, vividum, ubonense, euroum, deignani, dilloni and smithi. Several others have been described and many populations are difficult to assign to subspecies. This is the type species for the genus Pellorneum and its generic placement is assured although other species currently included in the genus may be reassigned. Distribution and habitat Calls recorded in Nagerhole This bird is a common resident breeder in the Himalayas and the forests of Asia. Like most babblers, it is not migratory, and has short rounded wings and a weak flight. Its habitat is scrub and bamboo thickets and forages by turning over leaves to find insects. Behaviour and ecology Puff-throated babblers vocalize often. Their calls are a series of whistling notes ascending in scale. Some calls have been transcribed as he'll beat you, pret-ty-sweet. The calling can be persistent. The breeding season is mainly during the rainy season. They build a nest on the ground at the base of bush and is a dome of leaves and twigs with an entrance on the side. The opening usually points downhill when the nest is on sloping ground. The clutch varies from 2 to 5 eggs, with northern populations tending towards larger clutches. Parent birds run rodent-like in the undergrowth as they move in and out of the nest. Young birds fledge and leave the nest about 12 to 13 days after hatching.

South Ferry is at the southern tip of Manhattan in New York City and is the embarkation point for ferries to Staten Island (Staten Island Ferry, through the Staten Island Ferry Whitehall Terminal) and Governors Island. Battery Park, abutting South Ferry on the west, has docking areas for ferries to Liberty Island and Ellis Island. Its name is derived from an historical ferry company which provided service to Brooklyn, run by the South Ferry Company.  History  The name \\"South Ferry\\" derives from a service to an area known as \\"South Brooklyn,\\" rather than from being at the southern tip of Manhattan, as it was the name of one of the ferries between what were then the separate cities of New York and Brooklyn. The \\"Old Ferry\\" (later renamed the Fulton Ferry), crossed between Manhattan and Brooklyn from streets that in each city would eventually be renamed \\"Fulton Street\\". The \\"New Ferry\\" crossed further east, between Catherine Street in Manhattan, and Main Street in Brooklyn. As the City of Brooklyn grew, the area south of Atlantic Avenue, known as South Brooklyn, began to become developed, but the area lacked easy access to the ferry terminals in the northern parts of that city. To solve this problem, the South Ferry Company established the South Ferry on May 16, 1836 to connect Lower Manhattan to the foot of Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn and the month-old Brooklyn and Jamaica Railroad (renamed Atlantic Avenue Railroad, later the Atlantic Avenue Railroad's streetcar line, later still part of the South Side Railroad of Long Island, now the Atlantic Branch of the Long Island Rail Road) through the Cobble Hill Tunnel. \\"South Ferry\\" was also the name of the Brooklyn landing and ferry house. In the 20th and early 21st centuries, the Brooklyn landing site served cargo as Brooklyn Piers 5 and 6, now part of Brooklyn Bridge Park The Fulton Ferry Company, which then operated only the Fulton Ferry, merged with the South Ferry Company in 1839 to form the New York and Brooklyn Union Ferry Company.Nathaniel Scudder Prime, A History of Long Island: from its first settlement by Europeans, to the year 1845, pages 376 to 380  Transportation connections  South Ferry is served by several New York City Subway stations. *South Ferry‚ÄìWhitehall Street, a station complex consisting of three components: **New South Ferry on the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line; serving the **South Ferry loops on the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line and the IRT Lexington Avenue Line; (there are two platforms, both are closed to passengers; the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line temporarily reopened to provide replacement service from 2013 to 2017, after the new station was flooded by Hurricane Sandy.) **Whitehall Street on the BMT Broadway Line; serving the *Bowling Green on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line; serving the (some Lexington Avenue Line trains stopped at South Ferry until 1977) *Broad Street on the BMT Nassau Street Line; serving the Also serving the ferry terminal directly is the M15 Select Bus Service route via a bus loop directly at the front door of the terminal.

The southeast portion of the Coteau comprises one of the distinct regions of Minnesota, known as Buffalo Ridge. The flatiron-shaped plateau was named by early French explorers from New France (Quebec), coteau meaning \\"hill\\" in French; the general term coteau has since been used in English to describe any upland dividing ridge. The plateau is composed of thick glacial deposits, the remnants of many repeated glaciations, reaching a composite thickness of approximately 900 feet (275 m). They are underlain by a small ridge of resistant Cretaceous shale. During the last (Pleistocene) Ice Age, two lobes of the Laurentide glacier, the James lobe on the west and the Des Moines lobe on the east, appear to have parted around the pre-existing plateau and further deepened the lowlands flanking the plateau. The plateau has numerous small glacial lakes and is drained by the Big Sioux River in South Dakota and the Cottonwood River in Minnesota. Pipestone deposits on the plateau have been quarried for hundreds of years by Native Americans, who use the prized, brownish-red mineral to make their sacred ceremonial pipes. The quarries are located at Pipestone National Monument in the southwest corner of Minnesota and in adjacent Minnehaha County, South Dakota. Numerous wind farms have been built on the area's surface to take advantage of the high average wind speeds.

The corps had its headquarters established in May 1992, activated in October 1993 and declared operational in 1995. The nucleus of the force is the Franco-German Brigade established in 1987. The Treaty of Strasbourg, signed in 2004, gave the corps its formal legal basis when it entered into force on 26 February 2009. The European Corps is presently not established at the EU level (referred to as the Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP); it is for instance not a project of the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) of the CSDP. The European Corps and its assets may however contribute in the implementation of the CSDP, when made available as a multinational force in accordance with article 42.3 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU).  Participating countries  Five countries participate in the corps as member states. The treaty allows for any EU member state to become a Eurocorps member state, subject to the approval of existing Eurocorps members. Additionally, four states are associated, and have thus pledged to contribute personnel to the staff.Comp. Domr√∂se, Hans-Lothar 2011: ‚ÄûZwei Jahre Kommandierender General des Eurokorps.

This was expected to become effective from 1 January 2016, but was delayed to January 2017. However, a change in government with the 2015 Polish election led to the application for full membership being withdrawn in favour of remaining an associate member. On 25 February 2003, Austria and Finland signed a treaty which allowed them to send staff to the headquarters of the corps. Finland remained an associated nation of the corps until 2005, and Austria until 2011. Romania became an associated nation in April 2016. In addition, the Netherlands and United Kingdom have sent liaison officers to the headquarters of the corps.

It is deployed on the authority of the Common Committee representing the member states,Belgium, France, Germany, Luxemburg and Spain the Chief of Defence, and the Political Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This committee considers requests for support from multinational organizations such as the UN, NATO, OSCE. The Corps can also be deployed at the request of the framework nations.  Command structure  Beret and badge of the corps The headquarters of the corps is based in Strasbourg near the Franco-German border, the seat of several EU institutions. The headquarters contains the following units:p. 894, Kleine, Maxim, Integrated Bi- and Multinational Military Units in Europe, in: Georg Nolte (Editor), European Military Law Systems, Walter de Gruyter, 2003. * Command Group, based in Quartier Aubert de Vincelles, consisting of the Commanding General, the Deputy Commanding General, the Chief of Staff, the Deputies Chief of Staff, the Air and Navy representatives, the legal advisers, a public affairs office, a medical adviser and a political adviser (only during engagement). * Staff of approximately 350 providing support to the command group. The staff also includes officers from Poland, Greece, Italy, Turkey and Romania. * Multi-national Command Support Brigade is co-located in Strasbourg (Quartier Aubert de Vincelles). This brigade is separate and subordinate to the Corps headquarters and provides additional support when the Corps is deployed. The brigade is formed from units provided by the nations on a case-by-case basis but has a permanent headquarters of 80 personnel. * Headquarters Support Battalion (subordinated to the multi-national Command Support Brigade), based in Strasbourg (Quartier Liz√©), providing protection, transport, food, etc. to the headquarters. This battalion consists of approximately 500 soldiers but can be significantly reinforced in case of commitments. German and French were the official languages at the corps until August 2002. English is now the working language.Directive No. 2 pour le G√©n√©ral commandant le Corps europ√©en from 14 November 1994: Langues au Corps europ√©en.  Subordinate units  Operational Command = The Franco- German Brigade, with 6,000 troops, is the only military formation permanently under the operational command of corps. The brigade is stationed in M√ºllheim, Donaueschingen, Immendingen, Sigmaringen, Me√üstetten, Stetten am kalten Markt, Villingen-Schwenningen in Germany and Illkirch-Grafenstaden in France. Additional affiliated formations could be placed under command of the corps headquarters for specific operations, for example in support of EU or NATO rapid-response missions.France-USA . The five framework countries have earmarked the following units and formations to the corps: = Affiliated units and formations = A parade of the corps in Strasbourg, 2013 In addition to the Franco-German Brigade, a number of nations have earmarked units or formations that they have affiliated to the corps HQ. These do not come under the permanent command of corps but rather can be provided to the corps for specific operations. For example, * French Contribution **A division-size unit, from 1993 to 1999 it was the 1re Division Blind√©e (HQ in Baden-Baden, Germany) *German Contribution **A division-size unit like the 10th Armored Division with its HQ in Veitsh√∂chheim *Belgian Contribution **The 1st Medium Brigade, stationed in Leopoldsburg *Spanish Contribution **The \\"Cuartel General del Mando de Fuerzas Pesadas\\" (Heavy Forces Command) in Burgos where the 1st Mechanized Division is stationed. *Luxembourg Contribution **A reconnaissance company (180 soldiers) based in Diekirch, composed of two reconnaissance platoons, an anti-tank platoon and a logistics support element. This unit will probably be integrated into the Belgian contribution during operations. Except for the Franco-German Brigade and the staff of the Multinational Command Support Brigade (MNCS Bde) who are permanently under operational command of the headquarters, these national contributions remain under national command in peacetime. They can become fully subordinated only after Transfer of Authority has been decided by member states. The size and type of corps units required in operations depends on the nature and scope of assigned missions, likely deployment and the expected operational outcome. In the case that all earmarked national contributions are committed, the corps would theoretically comprise approximately 60,000 troops. Beret badge  Operations  The corps has: *Participated in peacekeeping missions in Bosnia *Led KFOR III in Kosovo from 18 April 2000 to October 2000 *Led the ISAF6 Force in Afghanistan from 9 August 2004 to 11 February 2005. *From 1 July 2006, to 10 January 2007, the headquarters of the corps was the land component stand by element of the NATO Response Force 7. *From 1 July 2010 to 10 January 2011, the headquarters of the corps was the land component stand by element of the NATO Response Force 15 (NRF 15). *In 2012, the corps has deployed to ISAF in Afghanistan. *In the second semester the Eurocorps is supporting Germany with 57 soldiers in the EU mission EUTM Mali. Relationship with EU defence policy The European Corps is presently not established at the EU level (referred to as the Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP); it is for instance not a project of the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) of the CSDP. The European Corps and its assets may however contribute in the implementation of the CSDP, when made available as a multinational force in accordance with article 42.3 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU).

It was developed in 1933 by the Deutsche Forschungsanstalt f√ºr Segelflug (DFS - \\"German Research Institute for Sailplane Flight\\") with Hans Jacobs as the head designer. The glider was the German inspiration for the British Hotspur glider and was intended for airborne assault operations. In addition to the pilot, the DFS-230 glider had room for nine men who sat close together on a narrow bench located in the middle of the fuselage (half facing port, half facing starboard). Entry and exit to the cramped interior was by a single side door. The front passenger could operate its only armament, a machine gun. It was an assault glider, designed to land directly on top of its target, so it was equipped with a parachute brake. This allowed the glider to approach its target in a dive at an angle of eighty degrees and land within of its target. It could carry up to of cargo. It played significant roles in the operations at Fort Eben-Emael, the Battle of Crete, and in the rescue of Benito Mussolini. It was also used in North Africa. However, it was used chiefly in supplying encircled forces on the Eastern Front such as supplying the Demyansk Pocket, the Kholm Pocket, Stalingrad, and the defenders of Festung Budapest (until February 12, 1945). Although production ceased in 1943, it was used right up to the end of the war, for instance, supplying Berlin and Breslau until May 1945. Two DFS 230s flying over Italy, towed by a pair of Junkers Ju 87B tugs By means of a cable running along the tow rope the pilots of the tow-plane and of the freight glider were able to communicate with each other which made blind flying possible, when necessary. The towing speed of the DFS-230 was approximately . It dropped its landing gear as soon as it was safely in the air, and landed by means of a landing skid. The DFS-230 could be towed by a Ju 52 (which could tow two with difficulty), a He 111, a Ju 87, Hs 126, a Bf 110, or a Bf 109. The Ju 52 towed the glider using a cable or, in bad weather, a much shorter rigid bar connected by an articulated joint to the tow aircraft. The DFS-230 had the highest glide ratio (18) of any World War 2 military glider other than the Antonov A-7. This was because it was thought that the glider had to be capable of a long approach during landing, so that it could be released a considerable distance from the target so the sound of the towing aircraft did not alert the enemy.

Towed behind a Junkers Ju 52/3m during trials, it was found that the low towing speed and low approach speed made the combination more vulnerable to attack.

It is found from the Indian subcontinent and south-western China, to south- east Asia and Sumatra. It builds its nest in a tree, laying 2-3 eggs. This species eats insects and berries.  Taxonomy and systematics  Formerly, the Sumatran leafbird was considered as a subspecies, but the two differ extensively in morphology and other characteristics.  Description  The adult is green-bodied with a black face and throat bordered with yellow. It has dark brown irises and blackish feet and bill. It has a yellowish orange forehead and blue moustachial line (but lacks the blue flight feathers and tail sides of blue-winged leafbird). Young birds have a plain green head and lack the black on their face and throat. The black of the face and throat appears slightly duller in females. The southern Indian race, C. a. frontalis, has a narrower yellow border to black face. The throat is black and it has a blue sub-moustachial stripe and duller orange forehead. Towards the extreme south of India and Sri Lanka the race insularis occurs which is slightly smaller than frontalis.Rasmussen, P. C. & J. Anderton 2005. Birds of South Asia:The Ripley Guide. Vol 2. Smithsonian Institution and Lynx Edicions  Vocalization  Its song consists of rising and falling liquid chirps in bulbul-like tones and its call may include harsh whispers. They are also known to mimic the calls of other bird species and have loud calls.  Distribution and habitat  The golden-fronted leafbird is a common resident breeder in India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. Its habitat is forest and scrub.  Behaviour and ecology  The golden-fronted leafbird builds its nest in a tree, laying 2-3 eggs. This species eats insects and berries.

Subjects of an Anglo-Saxon king were required to yield three services: bridge-bote (repairing bridges and roads), burgh-bote (building and maintaining fortifications), and fyrd-bote (serving in the militia, known as the fyrd). Rulers very rarely exempted subjects from the trinoda necessitas, because these services were the lifeblood of an Anglo-Saxon kingdom. After the Norman Conquest, exemptions from the trinoda necessitas became more common. The term \\"trinoda necessitas\\" was rarely used in Anglo-Saxon times: its only known use is in a grant of land near Pagham, Sussex from King C√¶dwalla of Wessex to Saint Wilfred. The Wilfred grant used the term trimoda (Latin for \\"triple\\"); trinoda (Latin for \\"triple- knotted\\") was an error introduced by John Selden in 1610. Instead of the term \\"trinoda necessitas\\", it was common for Anglo-Saxon land grants to spell out the three obligations individually. For example, the land grant of √Üthelberht of Kent to a thegn in 858 was free of obligation, except explicitly for military service, bridge repair, and fortification.

Development Amiot 340 prototype The Amiot 350 series originated in the same 1934 requirement as a rival to the Lior√© et Olivier LeO 451. Derived from the Amiot 341 mail plane, the Amiot 340 prototype was involved in a propaganda misinformation flight to Berlin in August 1938 to convince the Germans that the French employed modern bombers. Though 130 machines were ordered by the French government that year, production delays and ordered modifications ensured that September 1939 saw no delivered aircraft. Eventually, the ordered number of this very modern aircraft reached 830, though ultimately only 80 machines were received by the Air Ministry. The main variant was the twin-tailed 351; however, due to various delays, the single- tailed 354 was accepted into service as an interim type. The Amiot 351 was planned to mount one 7.5 mm (.295 in) MAC 1934 machine gun in nose and ventral positions and one Hispano-Suiza HS.404 cannon in the dorsal position. Due to technical problems with the armament installation, many aircraft went to operational units with only a rifle-calibre light machine gun in the dorsal position. Operational history In May 1940, the Amiot 351/354 was in the process of equipping just two bomber groupes: GB 1/21 and GB II/21 based at Avignon. Though 200 were in the final stages of construction, only 35 were ready for flight. This situation was exacerbated by the Amiot 351/354 being built in three factories, two of which were later bombed by the Germans. On 16 May 1940, the Amiot 351/354s carried out armed reconnaissance sorties over Maastricht in the Netherlands - the first operation conducted by planes of this type. By June, the Amiot 351/354 was also delivered for GB I/34 and GB II/34, neither flying them in combat. At that time, all Amiot 351/354s were based on the northern front. Three had been lost in combat and ten in training accidents. All aircraft were ordered to evacuate to Africa on 17 June, 37 surviving the trip. As their numbers were too few to engage the Italians, the aircraft were sent back to Metropolitan France and their groupes disbanded in August 1940. Five Amiot 351/354s continued to be used as mail planes after the Battle of France. Four Amiot 351/354s were commandeered by the Luftwaffe as transports, two found service in the 1./Kampfgeschwader 200 a special service unit. Engines taken from these aircraft were later used on Messerschmitt Me 323 cargo transports. Variants Amiot 350 with Hispano-Suiza 12Y 28/29 engines. Amiot 351 with Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14N engines.

It is bordered by Back Bay, Chinatown, and Roxbury. It is distinguished from other neighborhoods by its Victorian style houses and the many parks in and around the area. The South End is the largest intact Victorian row house district in the country, which is made up of over 300 acres. Eleven residential parks are scattered around the South End. In 1973, the South End was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The construction of the South End began in 1849 when the neighborhood was built on tidal marshes. It is home to many diverse groups, including immigrants, young families, and professionals, and it is very popular with the gay and lesbian community of Boston. Since the 1880s the South End has been characterized by its diversity, with substantial Irish, Jewish, African-American, Puerto Rican (in the San Juan Street area), Chinese, and Greek populations. In 2010, the population was 55.2% white, 13.3% Hispanic, 12.5% Black or African American, 16.2% Asian, and 2.7% other; 55.2% of its residents had a bachelor's degree or higher; the median household income was $57,699; the median age was 36; 65.6% were primarily English speakers; and 12.9% were primarily Spanish speakers. The South End has five primary and secondary schools that offer education from kindergarten to grade 12. Aerial view of the South End Geographical history The Boston Neck was the trajectory of today's Washington Street, which was formerly flanked by tidal marshes that were filled in over the years. The South End lies south of the Back Bay, northwest of South Boston, northeast of Roxbury, north of Dorchester, and southwest of Bay Village. Despite the name, it is not directly south of the center of downtown Boston. The land belonging to the South End has been part of the city of Boston since its creation, though at the time of first settlement it was much smaller and surrounded by large tidal flats. The neighborhood was expanded and developed by filling in the marshlands, part of a larger project of the filling of Boston's Back Bay (north and west of Washington Street) and South Bay (south and east of Washington Street), from the 1830s to the 1870s. Fill was brought in by trains from large trenches of gravel excavated in Needham, Massachusetts. The South End was filled and developed before the neighborhood now known as Back Bay, which was mostly built after the American Civil War. Nineteenth-century technology did not allow for driving steel piles into bedrock, and instead a system of submerged timbers provided an understructure for most South End buildings. Recent decreases in underground water levels have caused damage to some wood pilings by exposing them to air. A series of monitoring wells have been drilled and the water level is now checked by the Boston Groundwater Trust, and can be adjusted by the introduction of water. The South End was once bordered to the north and west by the Boston and Providence Railroad, which terminated at the B&P; RR Station bordering the Public Garden. The railroad line is now covered by the Southwest Corridor Park and terminates at Back Bay Station. Most of the cross streets in the neighborhood are named after cities and towns served by it or by the Boston and Albany Railroad: Greenwich, Newton, Canton, Dedham, Brookline, Rutland, Concord, Worcester, Springfield, Camden, Maine, Northampton, Sharon, Randolph, Plympton, Stoughton, Waltham, Dover, Chatham, and Wareham. The primary business thoroughfares of the South End are Columbus Avenue, Tremont Street, and Washington Street, all between West Newton Street and Berkeley Street. Washington Street, the original causeway that connected Roxbury to Boston, experienced considerable reinvestment in the 1990s. The street was once defined by the Washington Street Elevated, an elevated train that was moved to below Southwest Corridor Park in the 1980s. Currently, two branches of the Silver Line, Boston's first bus rapid transit line, run along Washington Street. Columbus Avenue, the third main street of the South End, also has numerous restaurants and provides a remarkable straight-line view to the steeple of Park Street Church. Today the modern MBTA Orange Line rapid transit train runs along the partially covered Southwest Corridor, with neighborhood stops at Back Bay (also an MBTA Commuter Rail stop due to its proximity to the Copley Square employment center) and Massachusetts Avenue. Subdistricts The Boston Redevelopment Authority identifies several subdistricts covering the southeast portion of the neighborhood: * SOWA (South of Washington Area), roughly between Albany to Washington and East Berkeley to Mass Ave. * New York Streets, between Herald, East Berkeley, Albany, and Tremont Streets * Back Streets, roughly between I-93, Harrison, East Brookline, and East Berkeley Streets * Medical area, roughly between the highway, Massachusetts Avenue, Franklin Square, and East Brookline Street Parks A series of eleven residential parks are located across the South End, most are elliptical in shape with passive-use green space located in the middle. These residential squares vary in size, and take inspiration from English-inspired residential squares first laid out by Charles Bulfinch downtown. Many of the parks have a central fountain and are bordered with cast iron fencing. Complementing the nineteenth century residential parks are several newer parks including Peters Park, and a series of sixteen community gardens and pocket parks operated by the South End Lower Roxbury Open Space Land Trust. History Alexandra Hotel in 1899 Residential history As the South End geographically grew from filling in land north and west of \\"the Neck\\" (today's Washington Street) the city of Boston envisioned a large inner city residential neighborhood to relieve the crowded downtown and Beacon Hill neighborhoods. The city also hoped for a large and stable tax base. Architect Charles Bulfinch laid out some of the first filled land. He designed a large residential park called Columbia Square located at the present Franklin and Blackstone Squares. Bulfinch's plan was to route traffic around the square, not through it. Eventually his plan was abandoned and Washington street was allowed to once more divide the square creating today's separate squares. Many rooming houses on the Back Bay side of the South End had no bathing facilities; roomers went to public showers to bathe. Filled land in the South End was originally eight feet above sea level, but is now four feet, as fill settles. The original shore line of Boston Neck crosses in front of 40 St. George Street, (formerly 11 James Street), and tapers to the narrowest point on the Neck at Dover Street. Blackstone and Franklin Square are solid land on the original neck, but clam and snail shells are just beneath its surface, as high seas would occasionally overrun the Neck. Massive granite blocks of original sea wall can be seen on the Harrison Avenue side of the Joshua Bates School. A burgeoning middle class moved to the South End including business owners, two mayors, bankers, and industrialists. Though the neighborhood's status as a wealthy neighborhood was relatively short-lived, myths of a dramatic white flight in the 1880s are not entirely true. A series of national financial panics (see e.g., Panic of 1884, Economic history of the United States), combined with the emergence of new residential housing in Back Bay and Roxbury fed a steady decline of whites of English Protestant ancestry. Whites remained in the neighborhood, but increasingly they were Irish Catholic and recent immigrants. By the close of the nineteenth century the South End was becoming a tenement district, first attracting new immigrants and, in the 1940s, single gay men. The South End also became a center of black middle class Boston life and culture. The largest concentration of Pullman Porters in the country lived in the South End, mostly between Columbus Avenue and the railroad bed. As the decades progressed, more buildings became tenements and by the 1960s absentee landlordism was rampant and the neighborhood was one of the poorest of the city. The first settlement houses in Boston were in the South End: the South End House, Haley House, Lincoln House, the Harriet Tubman House, and the Children's Art Centre. In 1960 these settlement houses merged to form United South End Settlements.Finding aid for the United South End Settlements Records, Northeastern University Libraries, Boston, MA Urban renewal Union Park Street and Shawmut Avenue Columbus Avenue in the South End The South End was one of many large-scale landfill projects in Boston to create new residential districts. Construction started in 1849, it was built on tidal marshes that surrounded Boston Neck. The street plan for the South End was to pattern the 18th-century English models, it would have blocks of townhouses overlook small parks in the centers of the residential streets. The parks were built to make the South End more beautiful and make it feel like a community. These townhouses quickly became the predominant form of housing, builders produced blocks of houses for the middle-class families. From 1850 to 1880, these townhouses started to get built, with the typical townhouse having a mix of architectural styles. The South End also became a popular hospital district with the first being the Boston City Hospital which attracted other hospitals to the area. One of the hospitals that came into the South End was the Massachusetts Homeopathic Hospital that was built in 1875. It used fresh air cures and home remedies to heal their patients but if one of the patients needed surgery they were sent to the Boston University School of Medicine. The Boston University School of Medicine first came into the South End in 1874 accompanied by the New England Female College, which was the first college in the region that accepted women. By the late 19th century the South End was becoming increasingly populated by African Americans who were coming from the South. Even though City Hospital admitted black patients, they didn't allow them into their training programs or hire black professionals. By 1908 a black physician from Alabama named Dr. Cornelius Garland opened his own hospital called Plymouth Hospital and the Nurse's Training School. By 1929, Plymouth Hospital closed down because City Hospital started to accept people of color into their medical and nursing programs. The connection of Boston and Albany, New York by railroad (by some of the various companies that would later merge into the Boston and Albany Railroad) was celebrated in 1841 as a way to keep Boston competitive with New York City as an Atlantic port. Just south of the Boston and Worcester Railroad (where the Massachusetts Turnpike is now) in the next decade arose the New York Streets district, a residential area of the South End where the streets were named after cities on the route to Albany. Albany Street still exists (though it now ends at the Turnpike rather than Kneeland); connecting Albany Street with Harrison Street from north to south were Seneca, Oneida, Oswego, Genesee, Rochester and Troy Streets (Troy became the modern Traveler Street). ‚Äì detailed street history Starting in 1955, nearly all of the buildings in the New York Streets district were bulldozed as part of an urban renewal project to clear \\"slums\\" and make room for industrial activity in a period marked by urban decline. The resulting superblock was redeveloped into the headquarters for one of the city's newspapers. The Herald-Traveler Corporation spanned from the then newly minted Herald Street to Traveler Street until 2012, when it moved to the Seaport District in South Boston. Redevelopment as mixed-use area known as Ink Block, featuring apartments, a grocery store, restaurants, and other retail. Other populated sites in the South End received similar treatment, particularly the early high-rise, high density Cathedral Housing Projects adjacent to Holy Cross Cathedral and the high- and low-rise redevelopments like Castle Square from 1964-1966. The South End is not only residential, it is also commercial. Since it is located where there was access to railroads and port facilities it attracted a lot of manufacturers. Albany Street, which is along the Roxbury Canal, became occupied by warehouses and factories. By the 19th century, it became the center of Boston's furniture and piano-making industry. Today, the South End has many new developments that will add not only residential space, but also commercial space. According to the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) there is a new project being constructed that will be built on Albany Street. According to the Expanded Project Notification Form this new development will \\"include two hotels: a 16-story select service hotel, which will have a restaurant on its first floor; and a 9-story extended-stay hotel. The hotels together will have approximately 408 rooms. While the split between the two types of hotels has not been finally determined, current plans anticipate approximately 210 rooms in the select service hotel and approximately 198 rooms in the extended-stay hotel. The select-service hotel will include an approximately 4,000 square-foot (approximately 267-seat) restaurant on its first floor. A 3-level, above-ground parking garage with approximately 137 parking spaces will serve both hotels.\\" By creating this new project it will provide about 200 new jobs for construction workers once they start building, it will also \\"employ approximately 200 employees (full- time equivalents) in management, operations, customer service, retail, and food service functions.\\" =Jazz mecca= Braddock Park, in the South End Until the 1950s the South End and bordering Roxbury was a jazz mecca, with clubs such as the Royal Palms, Eddie Levine's, the Pioneer Club, Handy's Grille, Tic-Toc, Connolly's, Estelle's, the Hi-Hat, The Savoy, The Cave, Basin Street, Louie's Lounge, and Wally's Paradise. Wally's is the only venue to have survived to the present day. From 1915 to 1970 the American Federation of Musicians Local 535 was the top black musicians' union in the country, with local and national musicians such as Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, Chick Webb, Earl Hines, and Jimmie Lunceford. Its offices were originally above Charlie's Sandwich Shoppe (whose walls are lined with photographs of the jazz stars who ate there), but moved to 409 Massachusetts Avenue around 1930. In 1970 it and the white union (Local 9) were ordered to merge by the courts (Boston Musicians Association Local 9-535) and most of the black musicians left. =Education= Boston University Medical Campus The South End has 5 primary and secondary schools, providing education from Kindergarten through grade 12. The McKinley South End Academy is four schools in one. It is a special education school that focuses on behavioral, emotional and learning needs. Also in the South End there is the Josiah Quincy Upper School that holds grades 6 to 12. It balances the requirements for core subjects with the requirements of world languages, the arts and physical education. There is also the Blackstone Elementary School that holds over 500 students from diverse backgrounds. The Blackstone holds Pre-Kindergarten to grade 5, these schools that are found in the neighborhood of the South End belong to the Boston School systems. Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology is a four- year school for students who want to get a degree in the technical field. It is also conveniently located in the South End. It is also home to Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology; established in 1908, BFIT is one of New England's oldest colleges of technology, started with a bequest from Benjamin Franklin and a gift from Andrew Carnegie. Community resources The South End is conveniently located within the radius of three public libraries. The South End Branch has a diverse collection of popular and scholarly materials for adults and children. This library offers local history documents, DVDs, CDs, and audiobooks for adults, and recurring programs for children. Programs for adults include monthly book discussion groups and a weekly English conversation class. A community center that is located right in the South End is the Blackstone Community Center located on West Brookline Street, the hours of operations are vary depending on the day. The Blackstone Community Center is one of 35 community centers that are for youth and families and it is the only one that serves the South End and lower Roxbury neighborhoods. The mission of Blackstone is to enhance the quality of life for Boston residents by \\"supporting children, youth, and families through a wide range of programs and services. The Blackstone offers many programs to children and adults. Two major hospitals that are located in the South End are Boston Medical Center and Boston University School of Medicine. The South End also has the South End Community Health Center. The South End Community Health Center is a board governed non-profit \\"comprehensive, health care organization for all residents of the South End and the surrounding communities\\", according to their homepage they \\"are committed to providing the highest quality, culturally and linguistically sensitive, coordinated health care and social services to every patient, regardless of their ability to pay\\". They offer many different kinds of services from Adult Medicine, Behavioral Health, Dental Care to Nutrition to name a few. The South End is host to numerous community organizations including South End Community Health Center, South End Baseball, Youth Enrichment Services, the South End Lower Roxbury Open Space Land Trust, Mytown (an organization training youth to lead walking tours on neighborhood and Boston history), the South End Historical Society, Inquilinos Boricuas en Accion, and United South End Settlements. The Animal Rescue League of Boston, founded in 1899 by Anna Harris Smith is located in the South End at 10 Chandler Street. The Animal Rescue League of Boston features an animal shelter, an animal cruelty investigation and prosecution law enforcement department, a rescue department, an animal behavior department and an outpatient veterinary facility, Boston Veterinary Care. Diversity Holy Cross Cathedral The South End's population has been diverse since the 1880s when Irish, Lebanese, Jewish, African-American, and Greek populations began to settle in the neighborhood. In the 1930s a substantial immigration from Canada's maritime provinces found economic opportunity in Boston, and homes in the South End neighborhood. Beginning in the 1940s, particularly after the end of WWII the South End's rooming houses became home to growing numbers of gays and lesbians. The environment of single sex rooming houses provided homes and social cover for unmarried GLBT people. In the late 1940s a growing population of Hispanic people began settlement. At first much of this settlement was centered around the Cathedral of the Holy Cross. Today the neighborhood remains diverse, integrating people of nearly every race, religion, and sexual orientation. Income levels are anecdotally reported as stratified: a concentration of the wealthy and the poor. However, neither the U.S. Census or City of Boston reports on income of this specific neighborhood. Though gentrification is sometimes cited as a reason for flight of poorer and non- white residents, the neighborhood has maintained racial and income diversity due to a large number of subsidized, publicly owned, or otherwise low-income housing units and a homeless shelter. Subsidized below market rate housing developments such as Methunion Manor, Cathedral Housing (public housing project), Villa Victoria, Tent City, Lenox St Apartments, Camden, Camfield Gardens, 1850 Washington St, and Mandela Homes vary considerably and represent evolving attitudes in public housing design and governance. Although all neighborhoods in Boston suffer from crime, the city has a comparatively low incidence of street crime. The South End is large enough that some parts can be known for street crime while others are family friendly. Those parts include the Villa Victoria Affordable Housing, the Cathedral Housing Projects, and some areas west of Mass. Ave. The South End has more public playgrounds per square foot than other Boston neighborhoods. The South End is known as an increasingly upper middle class neighborhood, although is still home to many lower income residents. Some long-time residents are being pushed out by rising rents and property taxes. Because of a strong low-income agenda from the city, its recent (until the 1970s) history of impoverishment, and the presence of several low income housing projects, the South End will likely remain economically and racially diverse. The South End used to be known as a gay, artistic, and cultural neighborhood, although rising costs in the neighborhood threaten this character. Unlike in cities such as New York City, there are no city policies to help artists keep their long-term studios. Art galleries, however, are flourishing even though there are not many. GardenMoms, now one of Boston's most popular online parent groups with over 2500 members citywide, was started by several South End moms in 2002, and helped confirm the role of families as a growing and important facet of this community. (It is named after the South End cafe it started in, The Garden of Eden.) Demographics According to the 2010 Census, the total population of the South End is approximately 24,577, which is a 12.2% increase from 2000. The South End is made up of 55.2% White, 13.3% Hispanic/Latino, 12.5% Black or African American, 16.2% Asian, and 2.7% Other. Within the South End 33.8% of the population is between the ages of 20 through 34 years old, 8% are under 9 years old. 5.9% of South End residents are 10‚Äì19 years old, 31.2% are 35-54, 10.5% are 55-64, and 10.6% are 65 and older. The median age for the South End is 36 years old. About 55.2% of the population holds a college degree in the South End, with 29.2% having a bachelor's degree and 26% holding a graduate degree. The primary language that is spoken in this neighborhood is English with it being at 65.6%, followed by Spanish at 12.9%, Chinese 10.4%, French 2.7%, Portuguese 1%, and other languages 7.4%. The median income of the South End is $57,699, with 10.9% of the population making between $50,000 and $74,000 each year. There are 12,831 households in the South End, with 23.3% of the residents living in a family that includes a wife and a husband, and 47.4% are living alone without a family. As of 2010, 45.2% of the residents are without vehicles but on the other hand 54.8% do own vehicle. Approximately, 34% of the South Ends uses public transportation which doesn't include using a taxi. The South End has about 58.1% of its population working in the Management, Business, Science, and Arts field with 79.1% of the labor force being between the ages of 20 to 34 years old. The 2010 Census states that 72.6% of the South End population has lived in the same place for the past year while 12.8% have moved to a different location but the same county, 7.5% moved from a different county to the South End, and 5.9% moved from a different state to this location. South End, Boston Public transportation While no Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) trains run directly through the South End, the neighborhood is close to subway stops, including Copley, Symphony, and Prudential stations on the Green Line and Ruggles, Massachusetts Avenue, and Back Bay stations on the Orange Line. Commuter rail service on the Franklin, Needham, and Providence/Stoughton lines is available at Ruggles and Back Bay stations. Back Bay station is also served by the Framingham/Worcester Line. These commuter rail lines all continue to South Station. The bus rapid transit Silver Line routes SL4 and SL5 between Nubian Square and downtown Boston run on Washington Street through the South End, with multiple stops between Lenox Street and Herald Street. The neighborhood is served by multiple local MBTA bus routes. Major routes include route on Tremont Street and route on Massachusetts Avenue.

The NEI is one of 27 institutes and centers of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), an agency of the US Department of Health and Human Services. The mission of NEI is to prolong and protect the vision of the American people. The NEI conducts and performs research into treating and preventing diseases affecting the eye or vision. History National Eye Institute logo Before the NEI was established, primary responsibility for vision research at NIH was done by the National Institute of Neurological Disease and Blindness (NINDB) (which is now known as the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke). NINDB was established in 1950, after President Harry S. Truman signed the Omnibus Medical Research Act. The bill agreed to establish new separate institutes within NIH. This marked the beginning of vision research at a federal level. NEI Director Paul A. Sieving, M.D., Ph.D. Image of Dr. Carl Kupfer By the National Eye Institute Organizing, structuring, and separating vision and neurological research was a challenge at NINDB. NIH did its best to provide an equal budget plan for separate funding for vision research within NINDB. But there was not enough support and staff to handle more projects then what they were already undertaking. This led to the vision research program losing sufficient funding compared to the neurological research program. Some prominent members within the vision research community were not satisfied with how NINDB was operating. They did not approve of combining the two subjects of vision and neurological research together. This prompted some leading academic ophthalmologists and vision community supporters which included Bernard Becker, David Cogan, Edward Maumenee, Michael Hogan, John McLean, Frank Newell, Jules Stein, and Frank Winter to campaign for a separate institute that solely focused on vision research. The group of supporters had rallied together to begin an effort to promote and advocate for a separate vision institute at NIH. They overcame obstacles and their efforts were finally rewarded. U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed legislation creating the National Eye Institute, to be a part of the National Institutes of Health. The National Eye Institute (NEI) was established on August 16, 1968. This meant that the NEI would be the country‚Äôs first civilian governmental body that focused on visual diseases and disorders in vision research. The first director of NEI was Dr. Carl Kupfer. He was appointed on January 11, 1970. Dr. Kupfer wanted to establish and mold NEI into the lead agency in vision research. He wanted to make sure that the vision research program expanded and was focused on the entire visual system and not just part of it. During the first 14 years the institute succeeded in attracting some noted researchers and doctors and increasing the number of researchers in vision science on its intramural staff. In 1983 NEI received national recognition for its leadership in both clinical ophthalmology and research on eye diseases and disorders. Organizational structure * Office of the Director: ** Director: Dr. Paul A. Sieving ** Deputy Director: Dr. Santa Tumminia ** Associate Director for Management: Brian Trent ** Scientific Director: Dr. Sheldon S Miller ** Director of Epidemiology and Clinical Applications: Dr. Emily Chew ** Director Division of Extramural Research: Dr. Michael A. Steinmetz ** Clinical Director: Dr. Brian Brooks ** Director of Science Communications, Public Liaison, and Education: Maria Zacharias ** Chief Information Officer: Vacant Research priorities The NEI strives to be inclusive by requesting input from the community of vision researchers as well as professional and patient advocacy organizations. NEI planning activities are conducted under the auspices of the National Advisory Eye Council (NAEC), a committee of clinicians, researchers, patients and stakeholders that advises the Institute on funding decisions, initiatives, and strategic planning. The NEI recognizes that new ideas and concepts are constantly emerging, and that the main engine for scientific discovery is investigator-initiated research. The most important priority is to support the highest quality research that will help achieve the mission of the NEI. Some of the areas of interest include, retinal diseases, corneal diseases, lens and cataract, glaucoma and optic neuropathies, strabismus, amblyopia, and visual processing, and low vision and blindness rehabilitation. In 2013, the NEI launched the Audacious Goals Initiative in Regenerative Medicine for Vision (AGI), originally the NEI Audacious Goals Initiative, to catalyze fundamental research toward ‚Äúrestoring vision through the regeneration of neurons and neural connections in the eye and visual system.‚Äù The initiative targets photoreceptors and retinal ganglion cells. Currently, the AGI funds three research consortia, representing 16 projects and $62 million. The AGI Functional Imaging Consortium addresses the technical needs and opportunities for imaging cells of the visual system as they respond to light. The AGI Regenerative Factor Discovery Consortium is identifying factors that control cell regeneration in the visual system. The Translational-Enabling Models Consortium is developing animal models that have fidelity to human eye disease, a critical step toward testing regenerative therapies in clinical trials. Beyond direct funding, AGI has generated interest from the vision research community, helping to expand the NEI regenerative medicine portfolio. Research achievements NEI supported research has contributed to visual well-being of the world and has advanced our knowledge of how the eye functions in health and disease. Some of the research supported by the NEI is: Age-related macular degenerationThe Age-Related Eye Disease Study = The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) was a randomized clinical trial study that followed participants over eight years since the start of enrollment in 1992 and was completed in 2001. The study showed the combination of high levels of antioxidants and zinc can reduce the risk of advanced Age- Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and its associated vision loss. This combination isn‚Äôt a cure or treatment for AMD. The specific daily amounts of antioxidants and zinc used in the study were ‚Äì 500 milligrams of vitamin C, 400 International Units of vitamin E, 15 milligrams of beta-carotene (equivalent to 25,000 International Units of vitamin A), 80 milligrams of zinc as zinc oxide, and 2 milligrams of copper as cupric oxide. =The Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) = The Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) started in 2006 and was completed in 2012. AREDS2 is a second separate study from the original AREDS study. The purpose of this study was to improve and test different combinations of the original AREDS formula by adding omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin, removing beta-carotene, and lowering the amount of zinc. The antioxidants, lutein and zeaxanthin, were added to substitute beta-carotene from the formula because of the risk of lung cancer for smokers and former smokers found in a study conducted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Researchers added omega-3 fatty acids because of recent research found that it may be helpful to vision health and the zinc was lowered because some experts believed 80 mg was too high of a dosage. =Comparison of Age-Related Treatment Trial = The Comparison of Age- Related Treatment Trial: Lucentis-Avastin (CATT) study was a two-year multicenter clinical trial that started in 2008 to compare the effectiveness of the two current treatments used for AMD. The results of the study concluded that both Lucentis and Avastin were equally effective in treating and improving vision, whether it was used monthly or on as needed basis. Diabetic retinopathyEarly Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)= A multicenter, randomized clinical trial that treating clinically significant macular edema (CSME) with focal argon laser photocoagulation reduced the risk of additional vision loss; aspirin showed no benefit in delaying or reducing the onset or severity of retinopathy. Likewise, aspirin did not increase the risk for development of retinopathy or the progression of retinopathy. The participants were followed up to at least five years after they were enrolled in the study. =Anti-VEGF therapy for diabetic retinopathy= A network of NEI supported researchers, who are a part of the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network completed a two years study in 2015 that found the drug Lucentis can be an effective treatment for people with advanced stage diabetic retinopathy, called proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy is the growth of abnormal blood vessels that leak blood. This can distort vision and damage the retina. Lucentis is one of several drugs called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors that can block the growth of abnormal blood vessels. This is also commonly used to treat age-related macular degeneration. This study suggests that using VEGF inhibitors may help prevent macular edema. GlaucomaThe Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study = The Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study (AGIS) is designed to provide a comprehensive assessment of the long-range outcomes of medical and surgical management in advanced glaucoma over a four-year period. The study uses visual function status to compare two intervention sequences in managing the disease. After seven years of follow-up on patients enrolled in the AGIS, results revealed that blacks and whites differed in the way they benefited from the two treatment programs. Based on the study results, it is recommended that black patients with advanced glaucoma begin a treatment program that starts with laser surgery, which is consistent with current medical practice. In contrast, white patients with advanced glaucoma who have no life-threatening health problems should begin a treatment program that starts with trabeculectomy. This recommendation is inconsistent with current medical practice. Because glaucoma is a lifelong disease, long-term information is important. The AGIS patients will continue to be followed for up to four more years. =The Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Trial= The Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) Treatment Trial enrolled participants in 2010-2012 and they were followed up for 6 months with the last follow-up in 2013. The study tested a glaucoma drug called acetazolamide (diamox) and weight loss plan to help improve vision for women who have idiopathic intracranial hypertension disorder. IIH is also called pseudotumor cerebri and usually affects overweight women. The most common symptoms associated with IIH are headaches and visual problems that include blind spots, poor side vision, double vision, and temporary episodes of blindness. The study results showed that a weight loss plan and acetazolamide can help preserve and restore vision for women with IIH. Retinopathy of prematurity Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is an eye disease that affects premature infants. It is one of the most common causes of vision loss in childhood and can lead to vision impairment and blindness as children grow older. The Early Treatment of Retinopathy of Prematurity Study (ETROP) helped doctors predict which infants with ROP would benefit from early treatment by identifying certain eye characteristics. The early intervention would try to prevent severe vision loss later in life. Infants with ROP were treated using cryotherapy. Cryotherapy freezes the outer parts of the retina to slow down or stop the growth of new abnormal blood vessels. AmblyopiaExtended patching= Amblyopia, also known as lazy eye, is the most common cause of vision impairment among children. Amblyopia occurs when one eye is weakened because the eye and brain are not working together. The standard treatment for amblyopia is patching: covering the stronger eye with a patch for two hours a day to improve vision in the weaker eye. However, a recent report by the Pediatric Eye Disease Investigators Group (PEDIG) suggested that extending the daily duration of patching from two to six hours a day is effective at treating persistent amblyopia. The research was funded by NEI. UveitisUveitis and T cells= NEI researchers conducted a study that looked at the bacteria in the gut and how it protects the natural flora. Findings from studies suggest that this characteristic may be similar to how immune cells attack the eye in autoimmune eye diseases such as uveitis. Autoimmune uveitis is an inflammatory eye disease where the immune cells attack proteins in the eye. By studying how immune cells, also known as T cells, attack other parts of the body, researchers may gain further information on how the T cells are activated in the eye. It will also allow researchers to understand the disease better and develop treatments or therapies. =Ebola and uveitis= Following the 2014 Ebola virus outbreak in Liberia, NEI investigators joined other researchers and investigators to be a part of the PREVAIL III (Partnership for Research on Ebola Virus in Liberia) study. Ebola survivors reported a variety of complaints such as headaches, joint and muscle pain, eye fatigue and blurry vision. Some reports indicate that survivors have uveitis. Uveitis is a group of inflammatory autoimmune eye disease that produces swelling and destroys eye tissue. This can reduce vision or lead to vision loss. It is unknown to researchers what the physical long term effects of survivors, including eye health. In March 2015, investigators from different eye institutes including NEI, oversaw the design of an eye clinic for PREVAIL III in Liberia. The NEI team will travel back to Liberia during the course of the study to assist other health care professionals and partners to help provide follow-up eye care in the clinic for study participants. PREVAL III is sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of NIH. Retinitis pigmentosaGene therapy and retinitis pigmentosa= Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of rare, genetic disorders that involve a breakdown and loss of cells in the retina. Some of the most common symptoms of the disease are poor night vision and the loss of peripheral (side) vision. Currently there is no treatment to cure RP. A recent study by NEI-funded researchers showed that gene therapy can help preserve vision in late stage retinitis pigmentosa using canine models. Gene therapy halted the thinning of the retinal layer where photoreceptors are located and preserved the surviving photoreceptors. Research is still on going. =Bionic Vision= NEI help fund the first retinal implant device called Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System, developed in 2011 by Second Sight Inc. to treat people who have retinitis pigmentosa. Argus II is a camera that is mounted on eyeglasses. The image is captured through the camera and processed by the video processing unit that transmits electrical pulse images to the retinal prosthesis through eyeglasses. This helps people with retinitis pigmentosa potentially move around and be independent. The NEI, Department of Energy, and the National Science Foundation (NSF) provided the support for the development of Argus II. Leber congenital amaurosis Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is an inherited disorder that causes vision loss. NEI-funded scientists discovered that treating patients with gene therapy for Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) may improve eyesight and sensitivity of the retina. Some people with LCA have a mutated gene RPE65 that makes a protein found in the retinal pigment epithelium, which is a layer of cells that nourishes the light sensors or photoreceptors cells of the retina. LCA patients with this form of the disease were injected with an altered healthy RPE65 genes. Within days of the treatment, they reported increases in the ability to see dim light.

History With its parent company, it ceased operations following the First World War, when restrictions on German aviation were created by the Treaty of Versailles. In 1921, the factory was purchased by Heinrich L√ºbbe, who is said to have assisted Anthony Fokker in the creation of the pioneering Stangensteuerung synchronization gear system during 1914-15, and re-commenced aircraft construction for export, opening a subsidiary, Ikarus, in Yugoslavia. Walter Rethel, previously of Kondor and Fokker, was appointed head designer. In 1925, the company joined the Arado Handelsgesellschaft (\\"Arado trading firm\\") that was founded by the industrialist Hugo Stinnes Junior for covering up illegal trade with military equipment. When in 1933 the new Nazi government came to power in Germany, Stinnes emigrated and L√ºbbe took control of the company. Just prior to this, Walter Blume, formerly of Albatros, replaced Rethel. Arado achieved early prominence as a supplier to the Luftwaffe with the Arado Ar 66, which became one of the standard Luftwaffe trainers right into World War II. The firm also produced some of the Luftwaffe's first fighter aircraft, the Ar 65 and Ar 68. In 1936, the RLM (Reichsluftfahrtministerium ‚Äì \\"Reich Aviation Ministry\\") insisted that, as a show of loyalty, L√ºbbe should join the Nazi party. When he refused, he was arrested and forced to sell the company to the state. It was renamed to the more specific (and accurate) Arado Flugzeugwerke GmbH, and was placed under the direction of Erich Serno, and Felix Wagenf√ºhr, himself a former IdFlieg officer in World War I. When Germany invaded Poland, instigating World War II, two more Arado products rose to prominence, the Ar 96, which became the Luftwaffe's most used trainer, and the Ar 196 a reconnaissance seaplane that became standard equipment on all larger German warships. Unfortunately for Arado, most of their other designs were passed over in favour of stronger products from their competitors, such as Germany's only heavy bomber fielded during the war, the Heinkel He 177, for which Arado was the primary subcontractor. Perhaps Arado's most celebrated aircraft of the war was the Ar 234, the first jet-powered bomber. Too late to have any real effect on the outcome of the conflict, it was nevertheless a sign of things to come. Until their liberation in April 1945 by the Soviet army, 1,012 slave laborers from Freiburg, a sub-camp of the Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp, worked at the Arado factory, beginning with the first trainload of 249 prisoners arriving in August 1944. The prisoners were mostly Polish Jewish women and girls sent to Freiburg from Auschwitz. Arado also licence-built various versions of, and components for the Focke-Wulf Fw 190. In 1945, the company was liquidated and broken up. The Ar 96 continued to be produced in Czechoslovakia by Zlin for many years after the war as the C.2B.

Yabucoa is spread over 9 barrios and Yabucoa barrio-pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area. History The region of what is now Yabucoa belonged to the Ta√≠no region of Guayaney, which covered a portion of the southeast region of Puerto Rico. The region was led by cacique G√ºaraca. After the Spanish colonization, the region of Yabucoa belonged to Humacao, and its territory was mostly used for cattle and farming. Yabucoa, as a town, was founded on October 3, 1793 when Don Manuel Col√≥n de Bonilla and his wife, Do√±a Catalina Morales Pacheco, donated the lands to the people. Hurricane Maria Maria as it was making landfall near Yabucoa on September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck the island of Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017 as a high-end, category 4 hurricane, knocking out power to the entire island (and also affected access to clean water). The hurricane triggered numerous landslides in Yabucoa with its significant rainfall. Elderly were especially affected because many homes were completely destroyed. Map of landslides in Puerto Rico caused by Hurricane Maria in 2017 Many elderly living in Yabucoa died as a result of Hurricane Maria. People on oxygen machines died with the lack of electrical power. In June, 2018 the administrators of the municipality stated that they noticed an uptick in mortality rates (deaths) and were relaying the information since February, of 2018 but the government of Puerto Rico was not interested in hearing about it. Many more deaths were occurring than expected. An entire new section to the cemetery was built following the hurricane and the deaths that followed. As of June 12, 2018, eight months after the hurricane, more than 30% of Yabucoa homes were still without electrical power, stated the mayor of Yabucoa, Rafael Surillo. He stated there were 4,000 residences with between 12,000 and 15,000 residents without electrical power, of 36,000 residents. Large swaths of Yabucoa municipality including Guayabota, Tejas, Juan Mart√≠n, Calabazas, Limones and Aguacate barrios, and 100% of J√°canas were without electrical power for nine months, some since Hurricane Irma had hit a week prior to Hurricane Maria. Geography The municipality of Yabucoa is located in the south-eastern coast of Puerto Rico. The valley of Yabucoa is surrounded by the hills of the San Lorenzo Batholith on three sides and by the Caribbean Sea on the fourth. The hills surrounding the Yabucoa valley as well as the bedrock underlying the alluvium in the valley are composed of the San Lorenzo Batholith, a large, igneous intrusive body emplaced during the Late Cretaceous (Rogers, 1977; Rogers and others, 1979). The San Lorenzo Batholith is a composite body that is composed of gabbro (Kd), diorite, tonalite, granodiorite, and quartz monzonite. The Cuchillas de Panduras, a fork of the Cordillera Central runs through its south. Santa Elena is one of its most prominent peaks with an altitude of 1,870 feet (570 meters). Santa Elena is located in Juan Martin ward. Pandura peak rises 1,693 feet (516 meters) above sea level. Pandura is located in the Calabazas ward. The altitude of the hills surrounding the valley of Yabucoa reaches a maximum of about 2,130 feet (650 meters) at the head of the R√≠o Guayan√©s basin. The land surface in the Yabucoa valley slopes gently from an altitude of about 98 feet (30 meters) above mean sea level, at the western edge of the valley, to sea level where the valley meets the Caribbean Sea. Barrios Subdivisions of Yabucoa Like all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Yabucoa is subdivided into barrios. The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as . #Aguacate #Calabazas #Camino Nuevo #Guayabota #J√°canas #Juan Mart√≠n #Limones #Playa #Tejas #Yabucoa barrio-pueblo Sectors Barrios (which are like minor civil divisions) in turn are further subdivided into smaller local populated place areas/units called sectores (sectors in English).

Surillo was elected at the 2012 general election. The city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district VII, which is represented by two Senators. In 2012, Jorge Su√°rez and Jos√© Luis Dalmau were elected as District Senators. A native of Yabucoa Ram√≥n Luis Cruz Burgos was elected to represent the city in those elections.Elecciones Generales 2012: Escrutinio General on CEEPUR Symbols=Flag The design of the flag of Yabucoa is abstract, inspired by the colors of the municipal shield; green, white and violet. Coat of arms In the shield appear two angels the Santos Angeles Custodios, patron saints of Yabucoa. The color purple (violet) field of the shield represents the highest dignity of the angels. The walking sticks are attributes of the traveller, and refer to the holy office of the Angels as guides and companions in man's journey in his earthly life. The canes are adorned with guajana flowers, representing the wealth of the sugar cane. The green land where the angels stand symbolizes the fertile valley in which Yabucoa is located. Transportation One of the main roads to Yabucoa is the PR-3, which borders the east side of the island. Distance from the capital is approximately 1 hour. In 2008, a tunnel connecting the town of Yabucoa with the town of Maunabo was completed. It is currently the longest on the island. There are 41 bridges in Yabucoa.

It is located approximately south of Manhattan Island, and is separated from Brooklyn to the east by the Buttermilk Channel. The National Park Service administers a small portion of the north of the island as the Governors Island National Monument, including two former military fortifications named Fort Jay and Castle Williams. The Trust for Governors Island operates the remaining , including 52 historic buildings, as a public park. About of the land area is fill, added in the early 1900s to the south of the original island. The native Lenape originally referred to Governors Island as Paggank (\\"nut island\\"). The name was translated into the Dutch Noten Eylandt, then Anglicized into Nutten Island, before being renamed Governor's Island by the late 18th century. The island's use as a military installation dates to 1776, during the American Revolutionary War, when Continental Army troops raised defensive works on the island. From 1783 to 1966, the island was a United States Army post, serving mainly as a training ground for troops, though it also served as a strategic defense point during wartime. The island then served as a major United States Coast Guard installation until 1996. Following its decommissioning as a military base, there were several plans for redeveloping Governors Island. It was sold to the public for a nominal sum in 2003, and opened for public use in 2005. Governors Island has become a popular seasonal destination open to the public between May and September, attracting more than 800,000 visitors per year as of 2018. In addition to the public park, Governors Island includes free arts and cultural events, as well as recreational activities. The New York Harbor School, a public high school with a maritime-focused curriculum, has been on the island since 2010. The island can only be accessed by ferries from Brooklyn and Manhattan.  Etymology  The native Lenape referred to the island as Paggank, Pagganck, or Pagganack. All of these names literally translated to \\"Nut Island\\", likely in reference to the many chestnut, hickory, and oak trees on the island. The Dutch explorer Adriaen Block called it Noten Eylandt, a translation, and this was Anglicized into Nutten Island, a name that continued to be used until the late 18th century. The name \\"Governor's Island\\", with an apostrophe, stems from the British colonial era, when the colonial assembly reserved the island for the exclusive use of New York's royal governors. The current name without an apostrophe was made official in 1784. History=Colonial period Aerial view of the original island Governors Island was initially much smaller than it is today. It originally contained multiple inlets along its shoreline, as well as groves of hardwood trees, from which the island's native name is derived. There is insufficient evidence as to whether Governors Island contained any permanent Lenape settlements, or was used mainly for hunting and gathering. In 1524, Giovanni da Verrazzano was the first European to observe what was then called Paggank, becoming the first European in record to do so. Exactly one hundred years later, in May 1624, Noten Eylandt was the landing place of the first settlers in New Netherland. They had arrived from the Dutch Republic with the ship New Netherland under the command of Cornelius Jacobsen May, who disembarked on the island with thirty families in order to take possession of the New Netherland territory. For this reason, the New York State Senate and Assembly recognize Governors Island as the birthplace of the state of New York, and also certify the island as the place on which the planting of the \\"legal-political guaranty of tolerance onto the North American continent\\" took place. In 1633, the fifth director of New Netherland, Wouter van Twiller, arrived with a 104-man regiment on Noten Eylandt, and later commandeered the island for his personal use. He secured his farm by drawing up a deed on June 16, 1637, which was signed by two Lenape leaders, Cacapeteyno and Pewihas, on behalf of their community at Keshaechquereren, situated in present-day New Jersey. Van Twiller cultivated a farm on the island, even building a windmill on the land, until he returned to the Netherlands in 1642. The windmill was demolished possibly by 1648, when colonial governor Peter Stuyvesant burned it down after seeing it in inoperable condition. Following this, Noten Eylandt is said to have been used as a recreation ground by the Dutch between 1652 and 1664. There is little other documentation on the use of the island during the Dutch colonial period, other than the fact that it has remained in public ownership since van Twiller left New Netherland. New Netherland was conditionally ceded to the English in 1664, and the English renamed the settlement New York in June 1665. By 1674, the British had total control of the island. At this point, the eastern shore of the island was separated from Brooklyn by a shallow channel that could be easily traversed at low tide. This became known as Buttermilk Channel, since women would use the channel to travel to Manhattan island and sell buttermilk. By 1680, Nutten Island contained a single house and pasture to be used by colonial governors. The British started calling Nutten Island \\"Governor's Island\\" (with an apostrophe) in 1698 and reserved the island for the exclusive use of colonial governors. Four years later, when Edward Hyde, Lord of Cornbury took office as New York colonial governor, he built a mansion on Governor's Island, though evidence of this mansion no longer exists. Later, governor William Cosby used the island as a preserve to breed and hunt pheasants. Other governors leased out the island for profit, and for a short period around 1710, Governor's Island was designated as a quarantine station for refugees. Otherwise, Governor's Island mostly remained untouched until the American Revolutionary War started in 1775. American Revolution A house in Nolan ParkThe first plans for fortifications on Governor's Island were made in 1741, in anticipation of a war with France, but the fortifications were never built. The island was first used by a military encampment in 1755 during the French and Indian War, when Sir William Pepperell led the 51st Regiment of Foot onto Governor's Island. Other regiments soon followed, and by the mid-1760s, there was documentation of a fort on the island as well as several surrounding earthworks. Further plans to improve the fortifications on Governor's Island were devised in 1766 by British military engineer John Montresor. These plans were never realized, even though the British had asked for funding for these fortifications in 1774. After the American Revolution started, Continental Army General George Washington assigned General Charles Lee to create a defensive plan for New York Harbor. Lee's plan called for several defensive forts in Brooklyn, in Manhattan's Battery, and on Governor's Island. On the night of April 9, 1776, Continental Army General Israel Putnam came to the island to add earthworks and 40 cannons, in anticipation of the return of the British, who had fled New York City the year before. The island's defenses continued to be improved over the following months, and on July 12, 1776, the defenses engaged HMS Phoenix and HMS Rose as they made a run up the Hudson River to the Tappan Zee. Even though the British were able to travel as far north as the Tappan Zee, the colonists' cannon inflicted enough damage to make the British commanders cautious of entering the East River, and the fortifications contributed to the success of Washington's retreat from Brooklyn to Manhattan after the Battle of Long Island, when the British Army attempted to take Brooklyn Heights during the largest battle of the war, around August 27, 1776. In what appeared to be a strategic miscalculation, the rebels' munitions caused little to no damage to the British ships that were waiting some downstream. Two days after the British withdrawal to Manhattan, the Continental Army forces withdrew from Brooklyn and Governor's Island, and the British took back Governor's Island. From September 2 to 14, 1776, the new British garrison engaged volleys with Washington's guns on the Battery in front of Fort George in Manhattan.Historic Timeline of The Battery - The Battery Conservancy On September 6, the Americans' unsuccessful attempt to detonate the submersible Turtle at the island was the first documented submarine attack in history. The fort, along with the rest of New York City, was held by the British for the rest of the war until Evacuation Day in 1783. During this time, the British continued to improve Governor's Island's defenses. Late 18th through 19th centuries Late 18th century to War of 1812 = At the end of the Revolution, Governor's Island was transferred from the Crown to the state of New York. The island saw no military usage, instead being used as a hotel and racetrack. The quality of the fortifications, which were mostly made of earth, began to decline. The name of Nutten Island was changed to \\"Governors Island\\" by act of the United States legislature on March 29, 1784. Governors Island was conveyed to the New York State Board of Regents in 1790 \\"for the encouragement of education ... unless needed for military purposes.\\" Little else is known about the island's use during this time. Castle Williams By the mid-1790s, increased military tensions renewed an interest in fortifying New York Harbor, and a U.S. congressional committee had drawn a map of possible locations for the First System of fortifications to protect major American urban centers. Governors Island was one of the first locations where defenses were built. As such, the agreement with the Board of Regents was voided in 1794, and some $250,000 in federal funding was allocated to the construction of defenses on Governors Island in 1794 and 1795. Fort Jay was built starting in 1794 on the site of the earlier Revolutionary War earthworks. Work proceeded despite concerns that Fort Jay's low elevation made it vulnerable to being captured. Fort Jay, a square four-bastioned fort, was made of earthworks and timber, two impermanent materials that deteriorated soon after the threat of war went away, and by 1805 it had significantly degraded. Ownership of the island was transferred to the federal government on February 15, 1800. Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Williams, placed in charge of New York Harbor defenses in the early 1800s, proposed several new fortifications around the harbor as part of the Second System of fortifications. Unlike the First System defenses, the new fortifications were to be made of masonry to preclude deterioration, and they included increased firepower and improved weaponry. Fort Jay was rebuilt from 1806 to 1809 in its current five-pointed star shape, and was renamed Fort Columbus shortly afterward. A second major fortification, Castle Williams, was a circular battery built between 1807 and 1811 on a rocky shoal extending from the northwest corner of the island, to the north of Fort Columbus. A third fortification, the South Battery or Half-Moon Battery (now building 298), was built to the south of Fort Columbus on the island's eastern shore in 1812. The War of 1812 commenced shortly after the completion of these defenses, though the fortifications never saw combat. = Mid-19th century and Civil War = After the War of 1812, the island did not see much development. Rather, it was used for garrisoning troops starting 1821. The troops garrisoned on the island were deployed to wars four times in the rest of the 19th century. The New York Arsenal, a military division that dealt with artillery and was separate from the Army, moved to the island in 1832 and started constructing an armory building three years later. Construction of structures for the Arsenal continued for several decades. To distinguish the Arsenal's and the Army's structures, the former's buildings were designed in the Greek Revival style, such as the Admiral's House built in 1843.alt= The Army still retained a military presence on the island, and in the 1830s, it constructed several new buildings, such as officers' barracks and a hospital. The Army also added masonry seawalls and opened an \\"administrative and training center\\" starting from the 1850s. The erection of the recruiting center and barracks resulted in the creation of Nolan Park, to the east for Fort Columbus. Together with these changes, a grassy area was cleared between Fort Columbus and Castle Williams to allow better vantage points should defensive attacks be launched. Other Army structures included a muster station that operated throughout the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and American Civil War, as well as a music school. Still, most of the troops continued to live in tents. To accommodate Army personnel's religious requirements, a small Gothic Revival chapel for Protestants was built on Governors Island in 1846. No new permanent buildings were built specifically for the Civil War, though a temporary hospital was built. The hospital treated victims of cholera and yellow fever in epidemics during the 1850s and 1860s. During the war, Governors Island was used mostly as a support facility to muster soldiers, though the fortifications were still operational. Castle Williams held Confederate prisoners of war and Fort Columbus held captured Confederate officers. The austere accommodations frequently held over a thousand prisoners, and they frequently escaped and swam across to \\"mainland\\" Manhattan. In 1863, in the midst of the New York City draft riots, protesters unsuccessfully attempted to take over the island when Army troops were deployed to Manhattan. After the war, Castle Williams was used as a military stockade and became the East Coast counterpart to military prisons at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and Alcatraz Island, California. Infrastructure and facilities were repaired, unused structures were destroyed, and in 1875 a new munitions warehouse was built north of Fort Columbus. Significant development occurred on the formerly undeveloped northern and eastern sides of the island: the old wood-frame barracks outside Fort Columbus were replaced, and new officers' quarters were built in Nolan Park, east of Fort Columbus. The seawalls on the north and west sides of the island were rehabilitated or extended to create additional buildable land. During this period of expansion, in 1870, a particularly severe yellow fever epidemic occurred on the island, sickening hundreds and requiring a quarantine. The structures that hosted yellow fever patients were later demolished. Despite these changes, in 1873 Fort Columbus and Castle Williams were still described as operable. In 1878, Fort Columbus became a major Army administrative center, and Army officers' families started to move in. Other recreational options on the island were tennis courts in Nolan Park; a South Battery community garden; golf links; and a promenade for bicycling. A cemetery was also present on the island, and initially hosted yellow fever and cholera victims, but interments were halted in 1878 and all of the remains were moved to Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn by 1886. The secluded ambiance of Governors Island was altered somewhat when the first solid waste incinerator in the U.S. was built on Governors Island in 1885. Subsequent construction in the 1890s and 1900s added several officers' residences to the island. Starting in 1888, there was a movement to convert Governors Island into a public park for Lower Manhattan residents. Though park proponents argued that Central Park and Prospect Park were too far away for Lower Manhattan residents, the plan did not succeed. Army operation in the 20th century Expansion and World War I = Army battalion on Governors Island, 1918 The Army started planning to expand the island in the late 1880s and the 1890s. The U.S. Secretary of War, Elihu Root, contemplated such an expansion so that the island would have enough space to accommodate a full battalion. Using material excavated from the first line of the New York City Subway, the Army Corps of Engineers added of fill, extending Governors Island to the south. The work was mostly finished by 1909-1910 and was declared complete by January 1913. When the project was finished, it expanded the island's total area by , to . Secretary Root also retained the services of Beaux-Arts architect Charles Follen McKim to redesign nearly every structure on Governors Island, as well as create a plan for the island's topography. McKim presented plans in 1902 and 1907 to tear down all of the old buildings and provide for symmetrical building layouts. These plans were never executed. In addition, Root changed Fort Columbus's name back to its historic title, Fort Jay, in 1904. The Chapel of St. Cornelius the Centurion replaced the former chapel in 1907. The newly constructed southern part of Governors Island was initially used as an airstrip. In the world's first over-water flight in October 1909, Wilbur Wright flew from Governors Island, over the west side of Manhattan, then back to the island. The following year, Glenn Curtiss completed a flight from Albany to New York City by landing on the island. An aviation training center even operated from 1916 to 1917. In honor of these aviators, the Early Birds Monument at Liggett Hall was dedicated in 1954. Despite the island's expansion, little development happened immediately, but significant construction occurred during World War I. Governors Island is sometimes mentioned as the location of the United States' first overt military action during the war, on April 6, 1917, when troops from the island captured German vessels in New York Harbor minutes after the U.S. Congress declared war on Germany. Barracks, tents, and temporary wooden buildings were built on the original northern portion of the island, while the new southern section housed warehouses and other ancillary facilities which collectively stored $75 million worth of material. The structures were all connected by the Governors Island Railroad, which consisted of numerous sidings for shunting. The railroad had been reduced to and was dubbed the \\"World's Shortest Railroad\\" by the time it was torn up in 1931, though a train chassis remained buried on the island through the 2010s. = Mid-20th century = Building 400/Liggett Hall (1928), former barracks In 1920, upon the end of World War I, the Army restructured its internal organization so that Governors Island was now the headquarters of the Second Corps Area. Few structures were built immediately after the end of the war, though the Army maintained the existing buildings and continued to utilize the island as a military prison. Some of the wooden barracks structures deteriorated rapidly, prompting objections from congressional delegations. A school for Army soldiers' children was opened on Governors Island in 1926. In 1927, General Hanson Edward Ely commenced a major program to build several mostly Georgian revival structures on Governors Island. The new structures included a movie theater, a YMCA, an \\"officer's club\\", and a public school. The three-story Liggett Hall (also known as Building 400), a military barracks spanning nearly the entire width of the original island, was built on the site of former World War I warehouses, and was one of the world's largest barracks upon its completion in 1928. Afterward, the Army hired McKim, Mead & White to build a \\"barracks district\\" near Liggett Hall. During the 1930s, the Works Progress Administration landscaped much of the island and reinforced many existing structures, hiring up to 5,000 workers in the process. Some of the WPA's projects included the restoration of the General's House, as well as the eradication of invasive Japanese beetles. The Army also incrementally repaved Governors Island's roads so they could accommodate modern vehicles, and constructed garages. The Army YMCA An Army community developed on Governors Island during the mid-20th century. The island had three chapels in addition to the movie theater, YMCA, and \\"officer's club\\". Recreation was also popular; one common sport was polo, a relic from the 19th century when travel on the island was by horseback. In 1920, a polo playing field was established on the island's Parade Ground. Though a golf course had been built in 1903 near Fort Jay, a new polo-and-golf course called the Governors Island Golf Course was built circa 1925‚Äì1926. The course was located on the grounds of Fort Jay, and was sometimes called the \\"world's crookedest\\" golf course due to its enclosed nature in a confined space. Tennis courts and swimming pools were also present on Governors Island. Different groupings of recreational areas were generally located according to military hierarchy. The number of houses of worship increased as a Roman Catholic church was built in 1942, followed by a synagogue in 1959. World War II resulted in another hierarchical change on Governors Island, turning it into an administrative center. In 1939, the island became the headquarters of the U.S. First Army, and two years later the Eastern Defense Command was also established on the island. In conjunction, 72 temporary structures were erected on the island. Governors Island became a U.S. Army recruitment center in 1941, and was processing 1,500 recruits daily by 1942. This volume proved to be overwhelming due to the island's isolation. In October 1942 the recruitment station was moved to Grand Central Palace, near Grand Central Terminal.\\"Army opens biggest induction center in U.S.,\\" Life, 13 (20) : 51, 52, 54, 56, and 58 (November 16, 1942). Following the end of World War II in 1945, Governors Island continued to be the U.S. First Army's headquarters, and few substantive changes were made. Some buildings were razed in the southwest corner of the island, and an administrative office was destroyed to make way for a parking lot, but overall the building layout remained relatively untouched. = Infrastructure = Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel ventilation tower off Governors Island Prior to the construction of Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn in 1930, the island was considered as a site for a municipal airport. In 1927, U.S. Representative and future New York City mayor Fiorello La Guardia advocated for a commercial airport to be placed in Governors Island, since it was closer to Manhattan than the proposed site of Floyd Bennett Field. A bill in the U.S. House to create a Governors Island airport was voted down. The island also hosted the Governors Island Army Airfield for some time after World War II until the 1960s. In 1940, work started on the Brooklyn‚ÄìBattery Tunnel, which passes underwater offshore of the island's northeast corner. A ventilation building designed by McKim, Mead & White is connected to the island by a causeway. Initially, Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority chairman Robert Moses had proposed a bridge across the harbor, but the War Department quashed the plan, calling it a possible navigational threat to the Brooklyn Navy Yard located upriver. A subsequent plan to build a ramp from Governors Island to the bridge was rejected as well. The Brooklyn‚ÄìBattery Tunnel opened to traffic in 1950 without any other physical connection to the island. = Decommissioning = In 1963, Department of Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara started studying the feasibility of closing redundant military installations, especially naval ship yards, in order to save money. The Department of Defense announced in May 1964 that it was considering closing Fort Jay, the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and the Brooklyn Army Terminal. Despite protests from workers at the three facilities, McNamara announced that November that Fort Jay would be one of nearly a hundred military installations that would be closed. In February 1965, the United States Coast Guard announced that it had asked for permission to move to Fort Jay in order to consolidate its facilities within New York City. The Coast Guard saw the island as an opportunity to consolidate and provide more facilities for its schools, and as a base for its regional and Atlantic Ocean operations.  Coast Guard operation  Map showing Coast Guard usage of Governors Island in 1995 On December 31, 1965, the Army base was formally decommissioned and the installation became a Coast Guard base. At that point, most of the World War II-era buildings on the island's southern tip were still standing. The Coast Guard consolidated its operations at Governors Island, making the island the Coast Guard's largest installation. The island was used as a base of operations for the Atlantic Area Command and its regional Third District command. By 1985, the island had a population of 4,000 personnel and 1,000 family members. It was also homeport for U.S. Coast Guard cutters, including USCGC Gallatin (WHEC-721), USCGC Morgenthau (WHEC-722), and USCGC Dallas (WHEC-716). The Coast Guard split the island's operations among seven divisions, and began making various improvements such as adding a boat marina and the world's first search-and-rescue training school. By 1972, the Coast Guard had opened some apartment blocks on the southern portion of Governors Island, which replaced the temporary World War II-era buildings on that site. The golf course and open space in the center of the island were preserved during this wave of development. Liggett Hall was converted to classrooms, and other historic structures were preserved and restored. A community of Coast Guard members began to develop on the island, and it came to include a fire and police department, banks, stores, churches, an elementary school, a movie theater, a motel, and even a bowling alley and a Burger King. President Ronald Reagan and President-elect George Bush meet with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in December 1988 During this time, several notable events took place at Governors Island. During Liberty Weekend in 1986, President Ronald Reagan traveled to the island for a ceremony to relight the Statue of Liberty upon completion of the statue's restoration. On December 8, 1988, Reagan and President-elect George Bush met with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev on the island, in Reagan's last U.S.-Soviet summit as president. In July 1993, the United Nations held discussions between Haitian political leaders at the South Battery, which resulted in the Governors Island Accord being signed. The Coast Guard era also coincided with two landmark designations. On February 4, 1985, a portion of Governors Island was designated a National Historic Landmark. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission created the Governors Island Historic District on June 18, 1996. The United States Department of Transportation, the parent of the Coast Guard, identified the Governors Island base for closure in 1995. The move was part of a series of Coast Guard base closures that would collectively save $100 million a year. Governors Island alone cost $60 million a year to maintain. By 1996, the Coast Guard had relocated all functions and residential personnel to offices and bases, but left a caretaker detachment to jointly maintain the island with the General Services Administration (GSA) while its future was determined. Other federal agencies were loath to take control of the island. Upon the announcement of the base's closure in 1995, President Bill Clinton offered to give up the island for $1 if Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Governor George Pataki could agree to reserve the island for public use. The city was initially reluctant to take up Clinton's offer because it would not have been financially beneficial to the city. The issue was exacerbated when the Balanced Budget Act was passed in 1997, stipulating that the GSA sell the island at a fair market value by 2002. The island's sale was expected to net the federal government $500 million. Redevelopment Early proposals = With the announcement of the Coast Guard base's closure, officials and developers began offering plans for development. Mayor Giuliani considered building a casino and hotel on Governors Island. Other plans entailed preserving the island as a museum; converting it into a public park; establishing a free-trade zone; and building an educational campus, a prison, an amusement park, a golf courses, or even a nightclub district. In 1996, the Van Alen Institute hosted an ideas competition called \\"Public Property\\", attracting over 200 submissions. An agreement between the city and state to maintain the island for public use was reached in 2000. Throughout this time, the federal government continued to maintain the island for $20 million a year.Aerial view in 2009 facing northeast In a last-minute act while in office, President Clinton designated a area, including Fort Jay and Castle Williams, as Governors Island National Monument on January 19, 2001. The monument would be administered by the National Park Service. The following year, it was announced that Governors Island would become public property, though the transfer of the island was delayed due to the 2002 New York gubernatorial election. On January 31, 2003, the rest of the island's 150 acres, as well as of underwater land, were sold for a \\"nominal sum\\" (reported to be $1) and placed under the management of a joint city-state agency, the Governors Island Preservation and Education Corporation (GIPEC). The transfer included deed restrictions which prohibit permanent housing or casinos on the island. The agreement also stipulated that of land had to be used as parkland, and another had to be used for \\"educational, civic or cultural\\" purposes. In practice, the deed restriction precludes most long-term development on Governors Island. Progress on redevelopment was slow, but in early 2006, Governor George Pataki and Mayor Michael Bloomberg launched a competition for ideas to preserve Governors Island. During this period, the National Park Service and GIPEC began conducting restorations on parts of Governors Island. Major construction was necessary to convert the island for public use, such as repairs to the seawall and removal of asbestos. By 2006, the GIPEC had awarded leases to its first two tenants. The public was first allowed to visit the island in 2005, and eight thousand visitors came that year. At first, Governors Island was only open during summer weekends, except for a few concerts. Bikes and ferry services were made free in order to attract visitors. Art exhibits were later added. =Redevelopment= In mid-2007, GIPEC announced five finalist design teams, namely West 8, Diller Scofidio + Renfro, Rogers Marvel Architects, Quennell Rothschild & Partners, and SMWM. West 8 ultimately won the contest. The plan included of open space, as well as provided for the restoration of the historic district and a new park on the island's southern portion. Artificial hills were part of West 8's plan for the island, as were free bicycle rentals. Since the island was windy, West 8 designed their proposed topography to provide moments of shelter. Some plans were not implemented; these included an aerial gondola system designed by Santiago Calatrava, as well as a proposal by Center for Urban Real Estate (CURE) at Columbia University to physically connect Manhattan to Governors Island using landfill. A proposal to convert Castle Williams into a theater in the style of London's Globe Theatre was designed by architect Norman Foster in 2005, but was deemed unsuitable for the castle's design. Additionally, in 2008, there were unrealized plans to relocate the security and ticketing checkpoints for the Liberty Island and Ellis Island tourist ferries from the Battery to Governors Island, bringing as many as 500,000 additional people to Governors Island each year. The number of tenants on Governors Island started to increase, though they numbered fewer than 1,000 as of 2014. In 2009, a commercial organic farm, operated by the non-profit organization Added Value, was launched. In 2010, the Urban Assembly New York Harbor School relocated from Bushwick, Brooklyn, to building 550 on Governors Island. Also opened that year were artist studios run by the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council and housed in a portion of Building 110. This is a PDF copy of the official visitor's map that visitors can see and get on the island. The names and numbers of notable buildings are marked. Demolition of old structures on Governors Island began in 2008 with the destruction of a derelict motel. In April 2010, the city took control of the island's development, and GIPEC was succeeded by the Trust for Governors Island. The city also unveiled a new master development plan that preserved the historic north end of Governors Island, developed the middle and southern portions of the island as a park, and reserved the western and eastern sections for private development. The administration of Mayor Michael Bloomberg had provided funding for the first phase of construction. Construction on the $260 million park started May 24, 2012, and the Coast Guard-era military housing complexes were demolished. As part of phase 1 of the master plan, Soissons Landing was upgraded with new ferry docks and a waiting plaza, while the Parade Ground was regraded for lawn sports, while the Historic District gained concessions. In 2013, construction started on a new potable water connection (which replaced a locally illegal connection from the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel) as well as repairs to the seawall. The Liggett Terrace courtyard was built in 2014, as was Hammock Grove and a new play structure. The Oyster Pavilion opened in June 2015, *See also: followed by the Hills section of the park in July 2016. The island became more popular over the years. While it attracted 275,000 visitors in 2009, over 800,000 people came to the island in 2018. In September 2016, the Trust for Governors Island and the New York City Economic Development Corporation started an online survey to develop ideas for Governors Island as a year-round destination. Two years later, mayor Bill de Blasio opened a formal process to rezone the remaining un-redeveloped portions of Governors Island for dormitory, office, or educational use. The proposed rezoning drew opposition from activists who wanted Governors Island to be kept largely as-is. Also in 2018, the city's government held the NYCx Governors Island Connectivity Challenge, asking three companies to test out 5G technology on Governors Island; if the project was successful, the city's government would pursue a wider rollout of 5G in New York City. In September 2019, the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council's expanded Arts Center at Governors Island opened in a renovated former ordnance warehouse at the north end of the island. The new Arts Center features gallery, exhibition and performance space as well as studio areas for up to 40 artists. The opening of the Arts Center added LMCC to the island's community of year-round tenants, which also includes Billion Oyster Project, an organization dedicated to restoring New York Harbor's oyster population and biodiversity; the Urban Assembly New York Harbor School, a high school focused on maritime vocational education; and QC Terme, a destination day spa projected to open in 2021. In October 2019, city officials proposed constructing a climate change research center on the island. In March 2020, the Trust for Governors Island issued a Request for Proposals seeking arts and culture organizations to become year-round tenants in two historic buildings in Nolan Park. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City during 2020, the start of the island's 2020 visitor season was delayed from May 1 to July 15, and a timed ticketing system was implemented for the season, limiting visitation to 5,000 per day. Geography  Today, Governors Island comprises of land. About are operated by the National Park Service while the rest are under the jurisdiction of The Trust for Governors Island. The island is about west of Brooklyn and south of Manhattan. Politically it is part of the borough of Manhattan, and shares the ZIP Code 10004 with the blocks around South Ferry in Manhattan. Governors Island contains several named streets, mostly in the northern part of the island. The entirety of the island is surrounded by a waterfront promenade. Governors Island's shape is roughly characterized as resembling an \\"ice cream cone\\". The northern part of the island is original and can be described as the \\"cream\\", while the artificial southern section can be described as the \\"cone\\". Functionally, the island is bisected by Division Road and Liggett Hall, which separate the NPS-operated northern section from the parkland in the southern section. The highest natural point on Governors Island is above mean water level at the base of Fort Jay, in the northern portion of the island. The southern section formerly was lowland located a maximum of above mean sea level, but since the construction of the new parkland in the 2010s it has contained the Hills, which range from high. This construction, part of the island's Park and Public Space Master Plan, included various measures to make the island more resilient against the effects of climate change, like raising much of the south island out of the 100-year flood plain, and replacing the old sea wall with a layer of rip-rap to better mitigate wave action.  Notable structures = Fortifications  Castle Williams Several fortifications were built on Governors Island to protect New York Harbor. These worked in conjunction with Castle Clinton at the southern tip of Manhattan, as well as Fort Wood on Liberty Island, and Fort Gibson on Ellis Island. The existing fortifications were meant to protect the city during the War of 1812. Fort Jay, located at the center of the original (northern) portion of Governors Island, is the oldest, having been built in 1794. It was built on the highest point of the island, with a glacis sloping down from all sides. The initial fortifications degraded to such a point that they were replaced in 1806. Fort Jay was initially named for New York governor John Jay, but after being rebuilt, was known as Fort Columbus until about 1904. The rebuilt fort, which reused the original glacis and many of the original walls, comprised \\"an enclosed pentagonal work, with four bastions of masonry, calculated for one hundred guns\\", and initially included a 230-person brick barracks. Though Fort Jay has been renovated multiple times throughout its history, its current appearance largely stems from renovations in the 1830s. The walls of Fort Jay are made of sandstone and granite, with an arrow-shaped ravelin on the northern wall. The fortification is surrounded by a moat that is now dry. Castle Williams was built from 1807 through 1811 on the northwestern corner of the island, on what was then a submerged rock. Named for USACE chief engineer Jonathan Williams, it is a cylindrical four-tiered sandstone building measuring high by in diameter. The walls taper from from bottom to top. The building is four- tiered, with 13 casemates on each tier each having a capacity of two cannons, for a total capacity of 104 cannons. Two structures inside the southern side of the fort were removed in 1900. A third structure, called the South Battery or Half-Moon Battery, is located at the southeast corner of the original island near Buttermilk Channel, and was built before the War of 1812. The arrowhead-shaped South Battery contained 13 barbette guns, mounted on the parapet and facing Buttermilk Channel, as well as a barracks inside. It was then used as an officer's mess and Catholic chapel by 1878; as a court-martial room by the 1880s; and as an amusement hall after a 1904 renovation. From the 1930s, South Battery was also used as an officers' club. Open landscapes Northern portion = Fort Jay's glacis (left) and barracks (right), looking toward Manhattan There are four open landscapes in the historic northern part of Governors Island. The northernmost is the glacis of Fort Jay, a treeless grassy area that slopes down from all sides of the fort. The glacis formed a buffer between the walls of Fort Jay and the moat at the bottom of the slope. The glacis contained a polo field, as well as the Governors Island Golf Course. To the southeast of Fort Jay is Nolan Park, a formal trapezoidal area with tree-lined walks that is surrounded by former officers' quarters and administrative buildings. The park's eastern border curves southwest toward the southern end of the area, while the western and northern borders are roughly perpendicular to each other. Nolan Park's current configuration dates to the 1870s, and it was named after Major General Dennis E. Nolan, who was First Army's commander from 1933 to 1936. A bandstand formerly existed on the site. Governors Island's Parade Ground is located directly west of Nolan Park and south of Fort Jay, and is about . The parade ground slopes downward, away from Fort Jay and toward the waterfront to the south. It was used as both a military training ground and as an execution site for prisoners stockaded at Castle Williams. The golf course formerly extended into the parade ground, though remnants of the golf course still exist. The fourth open landscape is the triangle between Clayton and Hay Roads, also known as Colonels Row Green or Hay Park, located southwest of Fort Jay and northeast of Liggett Hall. It was created in the early 20th century and forms a wedge shape between Hay Road to the east, which forms the island's original southwest shoreline, and Clayton Road and Liggett Hall to the southwest. = Southern portion = Governors Island's southern half including new parkland. The southern portion of Governors Island includes a park that covers more than . The north end of the park contains Hammock Grove, a landscaped area of rolling hills with over 60 tree species. The grove's hills are located up to above mean sea level, preventing it from flooding. The grove itself is and contains 50 hammocks. Immediately to the west is the Play Lawn, which contains two turf fields that can be used for baseball. The paths in this portion of Governors Island are meandering, in a style similar to Frederick Law Olmsted's designs of Central Park and Prospect Park, which incorporate winding paths to reinforce a secluded atmosphere. The south end of the park contains the Hills section of Governors Island, which covers 10 acres. The Hills consists of four hills that are high, and are made partially of reclaimed debris from the demolition of the island's former residential towers. From shortest to tallest, the hills are the 26-foot Grassy Hill; the Discovery Hill, with site-specific artwork; the 40-foot Slide Hill, which contains four long slides; and the 70-foot Outlook Hill, which contains an observation area with view of New York Harbor. The Hills includes over 41,000 shrubs and 860 new trees. The Hills cost $70 million to build; the construction of the Hills was funded in part by Google CEO Eric Schmidt, who donated $15 million. At the southernmost tip of Governors Island is Picnic Point. This area contains grills and picnic tables close to the waterfront.  Other structures  When the Coast Guard abandoned Governors Island in 1996, there were 49 buildings built before 1917, mostly in the northern part of the island, and 121 buildings built after 1917, mostly in the southern part. The southern part was mostly residential and industrial, while the northern part was mixed-use. The island was relatively low-density with extensive open space. = Residential = Block House in Nolan Park Governors Island contains several clusters of low-rise officers' housing, now mostly unoccupied, though some structures are used as exhibits or for administrative purposes. The two largest sections of housing in the historical northern part of the island are Colonel's Row (buildings 403-410), as well as the structures around Nolan Park (buildings 1-20). Nolan Park contains several structures that are historical in their own right. The Admiral's House/Commanding Officer's Quarters (building 1), a two-story Colonial Revival brick house built in 1843, is listed separately on the NRHP and as a city landmark.\\"Admiral's House\\" National Register Digital Asset Management System To the north is the Governor's House (building 2), a two- story Georgian brick house built . The southeast corner of Nolan Park contains the Block House (building 9), a two-story Greek Revival building built in 1843, which served initially as a post hospital and later as administrative offices and officers' quarters. Buildings 3-5 (built in the 1850s), 6-11 and 14-18 (built in 1878-1879), and 19-20 (built in the 1890s) all served as two- company officers' quarters. Building 12, a three-story Georgian Revival brick apartment complex, was constructed in 1928 or 1931 to house the 16th Infantry Regiment. The eastern side of Colonel's Row contains eight individual officers' quarters numbered 403 from north to south, which initially faced the original shoreline southwest of Hays Road. The first structures to be built, buildings 405‚Äì408, were designed in accordance with the same Quartermaster General plans, and were built in 1893-1895 as two-family duplexes. This was followed by buildings 403‚Äì404, built in 1904-1906 also to the same plan. The two-and-a-half-story building 409, a Colonial Revival structure, was designed as Bachelor Officers' Quarters and was completed in 1910, while building 410 was built as a duplex officer's quarters in 1917 and is the only structure of the Modified Arts and Crafts design on the island. Building 550, now the New York Harbor School The southwestern side of Colonel's Row is dominated by Liggett Hall (building 400), a three-to-four-story barracks that spans nearly the entire width of Governors Island, measuring long with two wings extending south. Initially built in 1930 for the 16th Infantry, it was among the largest military barracks in the world when completed, and was the first Army building intended to house an entire regiment. The building contains a ground-level arcade that bisects the first and second floors, as well as an annex to the southeast. Two nearly identical Georgian Revival structures, building 550 (now the New York Harbor School) to the north and building 333 to the south, are located directly adjacent to Liggett Hall. The three-story structures are both U-shaped with the wings surrounding a front courtyard; they were built in 1932 as detachment housing for the First Army before being used by the Coast Guard as classrooms. Nearby are a smaller pair of nearly identical -story family housing blocks for the 16th Regiment, built in 1940. These consist of building 555 to the north of building 550, and building 315 near the southern waterfront south of the YMCA and theater. Several other residential structures exist throughout the northern part of Governors Island. Buildings 111 and 112, a pair of three-story neo-Georgian structures on the island's east side, were built in 1934 to a design by Rogers & Poor. These served as officers' quarters for the 16th Regiment, accommodating additional officers once Liggett Hall was full. Inside Fort Jay were four buildings numbered 202, 206, 210, and 214; these were nearly identical Greek Revival barracks that housed soldiers at the fort. The north side of the island, between Castle Williams to the west and Soissons Dock to the east, contains the Fort Jay Nurses' Quarters (building 114), a -story neo-Georgian brick-with-concrete structure designed by Rogers & Poor; this later became bachelor officers' quarters as well. Officers' quarters were also located in building 135, a former storehouse along the northeastern waterfront built in 1835. Formerly, residential apartment blocks ranging up to 11 stories tall were located on the southern half of Governors Island. There were 594 total apartments each with 2 to 5 bedrooms, spread out across three apartment complexes. Unlike the housing on the island's north side, these structures were not historically protected. The largest of these structures, the 11-story, 165-unit Cunningham Apartments (building 877), was located on the island's north side. Built in 1968, it was imploded in 2013. Many of the former residences located in Nolan Park and Colonels Row now serve as seasonal homes to a variety of arts and culture organizations that typically offer free programs for visitors during the Island's public season. During the 2020 season, indoor programs were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. As a result, many of the organizations based in the former homes joined the Governors Island Residency Initiative to offer the houses as free workspace for artists and cultural workers. = Religious = leftReligious practice on Governors Island dates to the opening of the first chapel in 1846. There later came to be three houses of worship on Governors Island. The Chapel of St. Cornelius the Centurion (building 13), a two-story limestone structure in the southern part of Nolan Park, was designed by Charles C. Haight and built in 1907, replacing the old 1846 chapel. Throughout the chapel's history, chaplains have been assigned by several different entities, namely the Army, Coast Guard, and Trinity Church. Maintenance was performed by the Trinity Church until 1986, when it turned operations over to the Coast Guard under condition that the Trinity Church would resume maintenance duties if and when the Coast Guard left the island. A Catholic church called Our Lady, Star of the Sea was built in 1942. The one-story clapboard structure is located at Clayton and Comfort Roads on the north shore of Governors Island. A synagogue housing Congregation Shaare Shomayim was established in 1960 in what is known as building S-40. The one-story clapboard building, located east of Barry Road on the island's east shore, was initially a \\"temporary\\" building used for storage. = Office and storage = Several buildings were built as part of the Arsenal but have not been used as residential structures, instead being utilized for office or storage space. These include buildings 104 and 107, originally used as storehouses; 105, a two-winged structure used as an armory and office; and 110, used as a quartermaster's depot and storehouse. Building 110 is now home to the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council's Arts Center at Governors Island, which opened in September 2019. All were built in brick from the 1850s through 1870s. Buildings 106 (pump house) and 108 and 109 (offices) were built during the 1940s in the same style as the other structures, though building 109 replaced a wooden structure built in 1918. Pershing Hall (building 125), a three-story brick building north of buildings 107 and 108 on the northern waterfront, served as the headquarters for the First Army when built in 1934. The waterfront contains several buildings, including building 130, the original Arsenal workshop, as well as building 134, a modern structure which hosted offices for USCG Group: Station New York. Governors Island also has several small vehicular garages of varying styles. Most of these garages were built in the 1930s and 1940s during the WPA's renovations of the island. = Service structures = alt=The northwest side of the island hosts building 515, the former Post Hospital, later used as enlisted bachelors' housing. The three- story brick-and-limestone building was constructed in 1935 to a Neo-Georgian design by McKim, Mead & White. Nearby is the Tampa Memorial Library (building S-251), a one-story rectangular wooden building. Constructed in 1908, it originally served as a storehouse and was renamed after the sinking of the cutter in 1918. The area around the South Battery, south of the Parade Ground, includes several former service structures. Building 301, a single-story brick building near the waterfront, housed an elementary school called PS 26. It was originally built in 1934, though two wings were added in 1959‚Äì1960. To the west is building 324, constructed in 1926 as the Army YMCA. The War Department Theater (building 330), a two-story 700-seat theater built in 1937‚Äì1939, is located west of the YMCA, facing the southern portion of Governors Island. Formerly located near the South Battery was the former Governors Island Guest House/Super 8 Motel in building 293. The one-and-a-half-story brick building was originally a quarters built in 1871‚Äì1872. The abandoned motel was demolished in 2007‚Äì2008 to expand the Parade Ground. The southern part of Governors Island contained building 785, which included a Burger King and bowling alley.  Monuments  The Monumental Setting for Bronze Plaque, a brick monumental bench with stone trim between buildings 406 and 407, was built by the WPA in 1938. The Early Birds Monument, originally dedicated in 1954 south of Liggett Hall, is a bronze cast of a Wright Brothers' plane's propeller on a granite base that commemorates early aviation on the island.  Operations = Management  Site-specific information panel, one of many installed by the National Park Service within Governors Island National Monument Three organizations work in partnership to maintain the island: the National Parks of New York Harbor Conservancy, the Trust for Governors Island, and Friends of Governors Island. =National Parks of New York Harbor Conservancy= The National Parks of New York Harbor Conservancy, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, is responsible for managing the that comprise the Governors Island National Monument. It works with the National Parks of New York Harbor (a branch of the National Park Service) in a public-private partnership, and is the official nonprofit partner for the National Parks of New York Harbor. The Conservancy was founded in 2003 because the NPS is legally prohibited from operating its own business ventures. The National Park Service owns and operates the monument itself. = Trust for Governors Island = The Trust for Governors Island, legally the Governors Island Corporation, is a nonprofit organization of the city government that is responsible for managing the redevelopment for the rest of the island. Its predecessor, the Governors Island Preservation and Education Corporation (GIPEC), was founded in 2003, when Governors Island was sold to the public. At the time, GIPEC was a partnership between the city and the state. In April 2010, the city entered an agreement to take full control of the island's development from the state of New York. GIPEC was then dissolved and superseded by the Trust for Governors Island. The Trust is charged with the planning, redevelopment, and ongoing operations of the of the island not included in the National Monument. = Friends of Governors Island = The Friends of Governors Island is the private nonprofit organization that manages the island's operations and programming. It was founded as the Governors Island Alliance in 1995, following the Coast Guard's decision to vacate the island. The Alliance and its 50 member organizations led a campaign to return the island to New York for public purposes. Since 2014 the Alliance has been an independent non- profit, and in 2016 it was renamed Friends of Governors Island. The Friends run volunteer and membership programs, raise money and perform advocacy for the island.  Working dogs  Governors Island employs working dogs to chase the Canada geese off of the island. The working dogs provide a humane geese disbursement method for the super flocks of Canada geese that migrate through the New York Harbor. Before the dog program started in 2015, attempts to use R/C cars, strobe lights, and a special laser to chase the geese all failed. Chasing the geese from the island helps avoid the large amount of bird droppings they leave behind, as well as mitigates their aggressive nature. Keeping the super-flocks off the island helps protect both other bird species and park visitors, as Canada geese are known to be hostile during nesting season. The Working Dogs program began in January 2015 when Jim Reed, Director of Park and Public Space, adopted Max, a Border Collie who came from a failed career as a farm dog. the Governors Island working dog team is composed of four dogs. A Border Collie named Quinn was added to the team of working dogs in 2017, followed by a Border Collie named Chip in mid-2018 and a mini Aussie named Aspen in late 2018. The dogs are popular on social media with a growing following. In addition to their duties chasing geese, the dogs serve as ambassadors to Governors Island guests.  Activities  Looking north from the Hills at the Longines Global Champions Tour event site in 2019. Activities on the island include free National Park Service tours of the National Monument, bike riding, picnicking, art installations, fairs, festivals, and concerts. The northern half contains Governors Island National Monument as well as the Governors Island Historic District. The southern half contains the 43-acre park constructed and operated by the Trust for Governors Island.  Recurring activities  Various free activities are offered on Governors Island. The houses around Nolan Park and Colonels row host arts, culture and educational exhibits during typical public seasons. Downtown Boathouse has offered free kayaking classes at Pier 101. In addition, there are several NPS- operated walking tours and self-guided tours of Governors Island's historic landmarks. Other public programs and exhibits are available, including an adventure playground operated by play:groundNYC called The Yard, as well as a compost site run by Earth Matter called the Compost Learning Center and a functioning urban farm, the Teaching Garden, run by GrowNYC. Some activities require additional fees. For instance, Adventures at Governors Island offers zip-lining and rock climbing activities in the undeveloped western side of the island's southern section. Another additional-fee activity provided on Governor Island is a glamorous camping, or \\"glamping\\", retreat that operates during the Island's public season. Customers are allowed to use the island three hours before the island opens to the general public each day, and several tiers of accommodations and activities are provided at progressively higher prices. For travel throughout the island, Blazing Saddles rents out bikes and pedicabs, and there are also three Citi Bike bike-sharing stations on the island.  Events  Visitors trick-or-treating during the Island's Pumpkin Point fall event in Nolan Park, October 2019. Many events take place on Governors Island during a typical public season including outdoor films, food and art festivals, runs, concerts, and a pumpkin patch in October. The Governors Island Art Fair, run by the art collective 4heads and now known as Portal: Governors Island Art Fair, has taken place annually on the island during weekends in September since 2007. Originally located in buildings on Colonel's Row, the event has also hosted artists in Castle Williams and Fort Jay. Many concerts have also taken place on the island. For instance, the Rite of Summer Festival, a series of free concerts, has been held on the island throughout the summer since 2011. The Jazz Age Lawn Party, a two-day-long Prohibition-era cosplay event, is also hosted on the island. In September 2019, the Longines Global Champions Tour, a globe-traveling equestrian jumping league, made its New York debut on Governors Island. Past attractions have included a Dutch festival called Goverthing in 2009, as well as a French carnival in 2013 that contained 19th- and 20th-century rides. Several previous large concerts have also been held on Governors Island. These include the inaugural Governors Ball Music Festival in 2011, though it moved to Randalls Island for subsequent seasons. Public access , Governors Island was open seven days a week from the beginning of May through the end of October. During the operating season, Governors Island opened at 10 a.m. each day and typically operated until 6 or 7 p.m., with extended hours on Friday and Saturday nights. Until 2015, Governors Island was publicly accessible only on summer weekends and was rarely open during nighttime except during concerts.  History  The first public boat service to Governors Island was instituted in 1794, when John Hillyer was given a franchise to operate a rowboat line to the island, collecting a fare of three cents per person. The Army took over the franchise as passenger traffic grew, operating barges from South Ferry or the Battery in Manhattan. The first recorded port of departure at the Battery, located south of what is now Castle Clinton, opened in 1854. At that point, there were two barges that each had a maximum capacity of 12 people. Test runs of steamboat service started in 1844, and they supplanted the former open-barges by 1879. Many of the passengers were employees at the New York Armory on Governors Island. By 1879, an \\"ugly little tug\\" that charged 15-cent fares for travel to the island was replaced with a steamboat. Around 1897, it was announced that the ferry service would be overhauled to accommodate the expanded Army presence on the island. Three new ferryboats with capacity of 823 passengers and 21 cars were added in 1925‚Äì1929. Two of these were replaced in 1956 with larger vessels that could hold 1,100 passengers and 32 cars. Public ferry access from Manhattan started in 2005, and at the time, the ferry was free on weekends. Starting in 2010, weekend ferry service commenced between Governors Island and Brooklyn Bridge Park's Pier 6 at Atlantic Avenue. In June 2011, NY Waterway started service to points along the East River. On May 1, 2017, that route became part of NYC Ferry's East River route. A new 400-person vessel was delivered in 2019 in anticipation of large crowds, supplementing the existing vessel Lt. Samuel Coursen. The same year, NYC Ferry added a weekend-only shuttle from Pier 11/Wall Street to Governors Island, replacing the East River and South Brooklyn service to the island.  Current services  Governors Island's two ferries, the Governors 1 (left) and Samuel Coursen (right) docked at Soissons Landing at the north end of the island in 2019. Governors Island has two ferry landings, Soissons Landing and Yankee Pier. Soissons Landing, located at the northern shore of the island, contains two slips. Ferries travel from here to Slip 7 at the Battery Maritime Building, located adjacent to the Staten Island Ferry Whitehall Terminal in Manhattan's Financial District.Lower Manhattan: Battery Maritime Building The ride is about 7 minutes long. These ferries are operated by The Trust for Governors Island and operate daily when the island is open. During summer weekends, ferries also operate to Yankee Pier on the southeastern side of the island, which is served by two ferry routes. One route is operated by The Trust and travels to Red Hook (though it traveled to Pier 6 of Brooklyn Bridge Park prior to 2020). The other route is operated by NYC Ferry and travels to Pier 11/Wall Street in Manhattan's Financial District, where it meets the other six NYC Ferry routes. Both Yankee Pier ferry routes operate weekends only, when the park is open. Ferries operated by The Trust run half-hourly and charge a $3 round-trip fare per person . While the ferry to Manhattan runs seven days a week, the ferry to Brooklyn runs only on weekends. NYC Ferry services run half-hourly and charge $2.75 for a one-way trip, with one free transfer to another route. The current cast-iron piers of Soissons Landing built in 1947 and commemorate the Battle of Soissons during World War I, during which over half of the 16th Regiment were killed. Building 148, a brick waiting room built in 1917, is located directly to the west. Notable people * Neal Adams (born 1941), comic book and commercial artist; born on the island * Withers A.

Early life Clayderman learned piano from his father, an accordion teacher. At the age of twelve, he was accepted into the Conservatoire de Paris, where he won great acclaim in his later adolescent years. Financial difficulties, precipitated by his father's illness, forestalled a promising career as a classical pianist. So in order to earn a living, he found work as a bank clerk and as an accompanist to contemporary bands. He accompanied French singers such as Johnny Hallyday, Thierry Le Luron, and Michel Sardou.  Ballade pour Adeline  In 1976, he was invited by Olivier Toussaint, a French record producer, and his partner Paul de Senneville, to record a gentle piano ballad. De Senneville had composed this ballad as a tribute to his baby daughter, Adeline. The 23-year- old Pag√®s was auditioned along with 20 other pianists and got the job. \\"He was an interesting musician with a soft touch and good technique\\", said Toussaint. \\"And he looked good, too\\".Clayderman.co.uk Pag√®s' name was changed to Richard Clayderman (he adopted his great-grandmother's last name to avoid mispronunciation of his real name outside France), and the single took off, selling 22 million copies in 38 countries.\\"Biography, Richard Clayderman\\" It was called Ballade pour Adeline.

The title was created sometime after 1436 for Alexander de Forbes, feudal baron of Forbes. The precise date of the creation is not known, but in a Precept dated July 12, 1442, he is already styled Lord Forbes. Brown's 1834 Peerage of Scotland gives a creation year of 1440. Alexander's descendant, the twelfth Lord, served as Lord Lieutenant of Aberdeenshire and Kincardineshire. His great-grandson, the seventeenth Lord, was a general in the Army and sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish Representative Peer from 1806 to 1843. His son, the eighteenth Lord, fought at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. He was succeeded by his son, the nineteenth Lord. He was a Scottish Representative Peer from 1874 to 1906. His nephew, the twenty-first Lord, served as a Scottish Representative Peer between 1917 and 1924. The latter's son, the twenty-second Lord, sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish Representative Peer from 1955 to 1963, when all Scottish peers were given an automatic seat in the House of Lords, and served in the Conservative administration of Harold Macmillan as Minister of State for Scotland from 1958 to 1959.Kidd, Charles, & Williamson, David (editors), Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage, New York, St Martin's Press, 1990. the title is held by his son, the twenty-third Lord Forbes, who succeeded in 2013.

Based at Rivolto Air Base, province of Udine, it was created on 1 March 1961 as a permanent group for the training Air Force pilots in air acrobatics.. The Tricolour Arrows replaced unofficial teams that had been sponsored by various commands starting in the early 1930s.Aeronautica Militare official site The team flies the Aermacchi MB-339-A/PAN, a two-seat fighter- trainer craft capable of 898 km/h at sea level.Caliaro 2005, p. 25 With ten aircraft, nine in close formation and a soloist, they are the world's largest acrobatics patrol, and their flight schedule, comprising about twenty acrobatics and about half an hour, made them the most famous in the world.Caliaro 2005, p. 25. It is one of national symbols of Italy. History=Previous patrols F-86E supplied with the Cavallino Rampante In Italy the first acrobatic flight school was founded in 1930 at the Udine- Campoformido Airport on the initiative of Colonel Rino Corso Fougier, commander of the 1st Fighter Wing: the first formation consisted of five Fiat C.R.20 and already on 8 June 1930 at first air show, called \\"Wing Day\\", these planes performed in a \\"bomb\\", a figure similar to the current bomb. In the years before the World War II the patrol of the Regia Aeronautica participated in various events (to note is that in 1932 Breda Ba.19 was used, in 1934 Fiat CR.30 and from 1936 Fiat CR.32), among which in 1938 the inauguration of the Milan-Linate Airport during which the Chief Patrol was Bruno Sartori, Silver Medal of Military Valor. After the inevitable parenthesis of the 1939-1945 period the acrobatic patrol was dissolved and reformed after the war, even if not officially classified as an acrobatic patrol. It was in fact the 51st Fighter Wing, equipped with US P-51D Mustang and British Spitfire Mk.IX aircraft, the first to perform with three Spitfires at Padua Airport in September 1947. The enthusiasm of these pilots was soon followed by some of their colleagues of the 5th Wing, which formed another aerobatic team based on Spitfire aircraft.Caliaro 2005, pp. 14-15. An F-86 of the Lanceri Neri In 1950 a patrol called Cavallino Rampante (Prancing Horse) formed, consisting of four pilots of the 4th Wing equipped with D.H.100 Vampire aircraft. In parallel with this department, in 1953 the Guizzo (Wriggle) was established, coming from the 5th Wing and operating on F-84G Thunderjet aircraft. This unit participated by gaining considerable success at various shows throughout Europe, thanks also to the return of the acrobatic maneuver called \\"bomb\\": the four pilots at the top of a looping in formation swooped down in opposite directions, calling the plane only near the ground.Caliaro 2005, pp. 15-16. The notoriety of Guizzo grew to such an extent that in 1955 he was given a film called The four of the thundering jet (in honor of the Thunderjet), and it was thanks to this film that the department officially changed its name to Getti Tonanti (Thundering Jets), continuing to perform until 1956, when they were replaced by the Tigri Bianche (White Tigers) of the 51st Fighter Wing, always mounted on F-84G. After a successful year, this new acrobatic team gave way to the reborn Cavallino Rampante and its new F-86E Saber, which will begin operations on May 19, 1957 at the Turin Airport, reaching its peak with the exhibition at the international exhibition of aeronautics and space in Paris Air Show. Many artistic victories also derived from the fact that, for the first time in Italy, a white smoke generator was used, with which the acrobatic figures were particularly highlighted.Caliaro 2005, pp. 17-18. 1957 also saw the entry into the scene of two new acrobatic departments: the Diavoli Rossi (Red Devils) and the Lanceri Neri (Black Lancers). The former were on staff at the 6th Fighter Wing, and with their F-84F Thunderstreak they achieved a great consensus among the population, as shown by their tour in the United States of America; the latter instead came from the 2nd Aerobrigata, demonstrating, with the help of the F-86E, great operational ability, which led them to fly also in Iran in 1959 in the presence of the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. In 1959 the Getti Tonanti line-up equipped with F-84F was also reconstituted, whose livery will be modified in 1960 with the five circles of the Olympic flag on the occasion of the 1960 Summer Olympics held in Rome. Birth of the Frecce Tricolori The Frecce Tricolori during one of their performances A Fiat G.91PAN, in service in the Frecce Tricolori from 1963 to 1982 Towards the end of 1960 it was decided to end this shifting between the various flocks and to found a department whose specific purpose was to form the national aerobatic team, selecting the best pilots of the various departments. Major Mario Squarcina, leader of the Diavoli Rossi was thus commissioned by the General Staff of the Italian Air Force to establish the Pattuglia Acrobatica Nazionale (National Aerobatic Patrol) composed of pilots from all the Air Force departments. The 313th Aerobatic Training Group was founded on 1 March 1961 at the Rivolto Air Base. On the same day, 6 North American F-86 Sabers of the 4th Air Brigade took off from Grosseto to Rivolto. On 1 May 1961 the first official release of the Pattuglia Acrobatica Nazionale (P.A.N.) with the high program of 4 + 1 F86 Saber on the airport of Trento - Gardolo, on the occasion of the Air Show of the local Aero Club. Unfortunately, three days later, on May 3rd, there was an incident in flight, during which a pilot died. Aermacchi MB-339PAN of Frecce Tricolori, with the savoy blue livery, in use since 1982 The Frecce Tricolori flew on North American F-86 Sabre until 1963. The staff, initially not as numerous as today, was enlarged in 1963 to nine elements plus the soloist, adding the possibility of using colored fumes. The following year the Fiat G.91PAN fighter-bombers arrived, then moved to the current Aermacchi MB-339 A/PAN MLU in 1982. On 28 August 1988 the PAN was the protagonist of the Ramstein accident, in which three pilots and 67 spectators lost their lives. Two of the three dead pilots, Mario Naldini and Ivo Nutarelli, were supposed to testify at the trial for the Itavia Flight 870 a few days later. This was the cause of various suspicions about the actual nature of an \\"accident\\" of what happened In 2000 they reached 50,000 flying hours on the Aermacchi MB-339.Aeronautica Militare official site In 2005 they won the award for best exhibition at the Royal International Air Tattoo at Fairford, England. They were the first non-Russian unit to receive the Russian Silver Medal for Aeronautical Merit.Aeronautica Militare official siteAeronautica Militare official site On 8 September 2007 the Frecce Tricolori took part at the funeral of Luciano Pavarotti in Modena and honoured him with a fly-past leaving green-white-red smoke trails. The replacement (scheduled for 2017) of the MB-339PAN with Alenia Aermacchi M.345 HET (High Efficiency Trainer), announced in 2013, was blocked in 2014, reconfirmed in 2016 with entry into service scheduled for 2020. Description=Aircraft features Exhibition of the Frecce Tricolori on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the foundation September 12, 2010 in Rivolto The livery of the MB-339PAN used by the Group is given by the characteristic tricolor band that crosses the side of the plane against a savoy blue background. The airplane's abdomen is light gray while the formation numbers are yellow stickers. For the classic Aermacchi MB-339 A under the Italian Air Force the wingtip tanks were removed for two reasons: #penalize the acrobatic performance of the aircraft, in particular the fast tonneaux due to a considerable mass placed far from the axis of rotation; #would make it more difficult to maintain tight formation during acrobatic maneuvers, partially inhibiting the view of the aircraft next to which one is flying and thus depriving the \\"gregari\\" of precise reference points for maintaining the position. Mixed subalary tanks are thus created, containing both vaseline oil for fumes and a certain amount of fuel to partially compensate for the reduction in autonomy caused by the removal of tip tip tanks. Larger subalar fuel tanks (pylon tank), already provided for at the origin, can be installed on the external subaltern pylons for long-range transfer flights. On the occasion of the first cruise in USA-Canada (1986), special cylindrical tip tanks were set up, with a capacity much higher than that of the original elliptical tip-tank. These cylindrical tip tanks, added to the nylon tanks, provide adequate autonomy for large stops in the north Atlantic, allowing even a digression on a possible diversion airport. The colored smoke is generated by dispersion, and is composed of vaseline oil to which non-polluting pigments are added. The escape of this compound occurs through a small tube placed in the rear exhaust of the airplane. Formation Video of the Frecce Tricolore during the Sky Tour 2014 Passage of the Frecce Tricolori in Florence on 28 March 2018 for the celebrations of the 95th anniversary of the establishment of the Italian Air Force During the performances the formation of the acrobatic patrol is usually composed of 9 aircraft, called \\"Pony\\", each labeled with a number ranging from 1 to 10. The name \\"Pony\\" was coined by the then Captain Zeno Tascio to remember the horse of Francesco Baracca which is the sign of the 4th Wing, at the time 4th Airbase who was already preparing to take over the task PAN for the 1961. Depending on the needs of the Department, aircraft can also be 11 in total, thus including the figure of the acrobatic training manager. * Pony 0 - Commander * Pony 1 - Head of Formation * Pony 2 - 1¬∞ Left Domestique * Pony 3 - 1¬∞ Right Domestique * Pony 4 - 2¬∞ Left Domestique * Pony 5 - 2¬∞ Right Domestique * Pony 6 - 1¬∞ Tail light * Pony 7 - 3¬∞ Left Domestique * Pony 8 - 3¬∞ Right Domestique * Pony 9 - 2¬∞ Tail light * Pony 10 - Soloist * Pony 11 - Acrobatic Training Supervisor * Pony 12 - Pilot in Training * Pony 13 - Pilot in Training * Pony 14 - Pilot in Training * Pony 15 - Pilot in Training * Pony 16 - Pilot in Training Flight programs and pilot selection Close formation of Frecce Tricolori at the Royal International Air Tattoo held in Fairford in 2005 The Frecce Tricolorihave three programs for performing acrobatics: high, low, and flat, depending on the weather conditions and the characteristics of the exhibition area. The high program is chosen when the cloud base is above 1,000 m and is characterized by the execution of the acrobatic figures entirely on the vertical plane; the low program is preferred instead when the clouds do not exceed 500 - 600 m and vertical maneuvers are not carried out (such as looping or the bomb); finally, the flat variant includes low-level formation maneuvers. For several years, when possible, the PAN performances have ended with the complete line-up drawing a five km long flag of Italy in the sky while from the floor speakers the voice of Luciano Pavarotti intones the finale of Nessun dorma for the entire duration of the passage . The first realization of this maneuver took place in Pratica di Mare (frazione of Pomezia) during the farewell ceremony at the F-104 Starfighter and this earned the Frecce Tricolori the world record for the longest national flag ever made. Also for this reason, on September 8th, 2007, hurtling through the Modena sky, the Frecce Tricolori paid tribute to Pavarotti whose funeral he had just helde. Only the best pilots have access to the Frecce Tricolori: each year one or two of them are chosen strictly among those who have more than 1,000 flight hours, and once they have entered they must follow a gradual insertion training program.Caliaro 2005, p. 31.

It involves the exploration of one's body in relationship to others by using the fundamentals of sharing weight, touch, and movement awareness. American dancer and choreographer Steve Paxton originated contact improvisation, drawing from his past training in aikido, a martial art form, to explore and push boundaries with his colleagues and students to develop this new practice. Contact improvisation plays with the artistry of falling off balance, counterbalance, finding the shelves of the body, learning the mechanics of the body in order to handle someone else's weight or be lifted, breathing techniques, and can involve the art of getting to know your partner past the physical point through the physicality. Steve Paxton, along with other pioneers Nancy Stark Smith, Danny Lepkoff, Lisa Nelson, Karen Nelson, Nita Little, Andrew Harwood, and Ray Chung, thus participated in creating an \\"art-sport,\\" oscillating between different emphases depending on the moments and personalities who practice it: * experimental dance (practice- based research organized in dance laboratories) * theatrical form (improvised performances and lectures-demonstrations) * educational tool (classical training for professional and non-professional dancers in improvisation and in partnering) * social dancing (through informal gatherings known as \\"jams\\") * awareness practice Formally, contact improvisation is a movement improvisation that is explored with another being. According to one of its first practitioners, Nancy Stark Smith, it \\"resembles other familiar duet forms, such as the embrace, wrestling, surfing, martial arts, and the jitterbug, encompassing a wide range of movement from stillness to highly athletic.\\"Nancy Stark Smith et David Koteen (2013), Caught Falling. The Confluence of Contact Improvisation, Nancy Stark Smith, and Other Moving Ideas, Contact Editions, p. xii Various definitions establish in their own ways what was at stake in a contact improvisation duo. Steve Paxton proposed the following in 1979: > The exigencies of the form dictate a mode of movement which is relaxed, > constantly aware and prepared, and onflowing. As a basic focus, the dancers > remain in physical touch, mutually supportive and innovative, meditating > upon the physical laws relating to their masses: gravity, momentum, inertia, > and friction. They do not strive to achieve results, but rather, to meet the > constantly changing physical reality with appropriate placement and > energy.Steve Paxton, \\"A Definition\\", Contact Quarterly, Winter 1979, p. 26. History of contact improvisation= From Magnesium to Contact Improvisations  Contact improvisation was developed in the United States in the 1970s by a group of dancers and athletes gathered for the first time under the impetus of choreographer and dancer Steve Paxton. In January 1972, Steve Paxton was in residence at Oberlin College on a tour with Grand Union, a collective where he collaborated among others with Yvonne Rainer and Trisha Brown. For several weeks, he offered Oberlin students two sets of practices: # every morning at dawn, a \\"soft class\\" involving an exploration that he soon called the \\"small dance,\\" a form of meditation that is practiced standing, where attention is paid to postural adjustments and micro-weight transfers;Steve Paxton, \\" Why Standing? \\", Contact Quarterly, 2015 # and later in the day, rehearsals for a performance that he transmitted to a group of young men and whose score is to explore the extremes of movement and disorientation, from standing still to falling, rolling, colliding, and jumping in the air. For these rehearsals, Steve Paxton relied on his training in modern dance (he had danced in the companies of Jos√© Lim√≥n and Merce Cunningham), in aikido and in gymnastics. The meeting of these practices gives rise to Magnesium, a twenty-minute long piece where dancers perform on gym mats, jump and bump into each other, manipulate and cling to one another. \\"In this performance, dancers usually use their bodies as a whole, all parts are simultaneously unbalanced or thrown against another body or in the air.\\"Novack, Cynthia Jean., Sharing the dance, Univ. Of Wisconsin Press, 1 January 1990 ( , , read online ), chapters 2 and 3. After about fifteen minutes, the dancers stop and start a \\"Small Dance\\" that concludes the performance. In the Spring of 1972, Steve Paxton received a grant from Change, Inc which allowed him to invite dancers to work on the form he was evolving. He invited some colleagues from the Judson Dance Theater years like Barbara Dilley and Nancy Topf, release technique pioneer Mary Fulkerson, as well as students met during his teaching tours, including Nancy Stark Smith and Curt Siddall (from Oberlin College), Danny Lepkoff and David Woodberry (from the University of Rochester, where Mary Fulkerson was a teacher) and Nita Little (from Bennington College). At the end of this week of residency, the group presented a performance which Steve Paxton named Contact Improvisations. They presented it in the form of a permanent afternoon practice for five days, at the John Weber Gallery in Manhattan, which at the same time showcased a film by George Manupelli, Dr. Chicago, and where spectators could come and go as the practice continues.  In North America  Styles = Following the first performance of Contact Improvisations in New York in 1972, the participants scattered to different parts of the United States but soon began to teach the practice. The syncopated, risky, raw and awkward style of the first performances gave place rather quickly to a variety of aesthetics within the form. One of those aesthetics was the development of smooth, continuous, controlled flow of quality in the late 1970s and early 1980s, running parallel with the opposite trend of interest in conflict and unexpected responses, including previously avoided eye contact and direct hand contact.Novack, 1990 op cit p. 156-8. Says Nancy Stark Smith, > Within the study of Contact Improvisation, the experience of flow was soon > recognized and highlighted in our dancing. It became one of my favorite > practices and I proceeded to \\"do flow\\" for many years-challenging it, > testing it: could we flow through this pass? Could we squeak through that > one, and keep going?Nancy Stark Smith, \\"Back in time\\", Contact Quarterly, > vol.11/1, Winter 86, p. 3 Regardless of those aesthetic choices, the central characteristic of contact improvisation remains a focus on bodily awareness and physical reflexes rather than consciously controlled movements.Novack, 1990 op cit p. 152 One of the founders of the form, Daniel Lepkoff, comments that the ‚Äúprecedence of body experience first, and mindful cognition second, is an essential distinction between Contact Improvisation and other approaches to dance.‚Äù Another source affirms that the practice of contact improvisation involves ‚Äúmindfulness, sensing and collecting information‚Äù as its core. = Languaging and observing = In 1975, the dancers working with Steve Paxton considered trademarking the term contact improvisation in order to control the teaching and practice of the dance form, consequently for reasons of safety. This idea was rejected in favor of establishing a forum for communication: this became the Contact Newsletter founded by Nancy Stark Smith, which evolved into the bi-annual journal Contact Quarterly which continues to be published online by the non- profit Contact Collaborations (incorporated in 1978) after a final print edition came out in January 2020. The journal, now co-edited by Nancy Stark Smith and Lisa Nelson, brings together different reflections of contact improvisation teachers and practitioners and cements an international community by equipping it with a communication organ, as well as hosting several other orders of reflections, including writings by contemporary dancers and somatic practitioners. According to the magazine's statement, > Contact Quarterly is the longest living, independent, artist-made, not-for- > profit, reader-supported magazine devoted to the dancer's voice. Founded in > 1975, Contact Quarterly (CQ) began as a forum for discussion of the emerging > dance form Contact Improvisation. Serving as a meeting ground for a > worldwide network of contact improvisers, CQquickly grew to include writings > and interviews on postmodern and contemporary experimental dance, somatic > movement practices, improvisational dance, mixed-abilities dance, teaching > methods, creative process, and performance. While the development of contact improvisation has benefited greatly from Nancy Stark Smith and Lisa Nelson's editorial work to support the writings of dancers in their exploration of the form, it also owes much to the cameras of Steve Christiansen and then Lisa Nelson, who documented many moments of the work (especially in performance) and allow the contactors to observe themselves with meticulousness.Contact Improvisation jam in Montpellier, France (2004 = Development of art-sport = Since the mid-1970s, regular jams are present in most major cities in North America (New York City, Boston, San Francisco, and Montreal). Other multi-day residential spaces (such as the Breitenbush Jam, which has existed since 1981) have been in existence since the late 1970s. Remembers dancer Mark Pritchard, Earthdance artist-run residency center in western Massachusetts > The 1979 Country Jam was a first of its kind in the Contact world: over > fifty people from the western United States and Canada came together for > twelve days of non-structured existence, life and dance: neither a workshop, > a conference or a seminar, but an improvisational gathering, with the sole > aim of creating a space for dancing and living in flux...

In Europe  In Europe, contact improvisation was presented for the first time in 1973 (from June 25 to 28th) in an art gallery in Rome, L'Attico run by Fabio Sargentini. In the 1970s and 1980s, Steve Paxton and Lisa Nelson were regularly invited to the Dartington College of Arts in Great Britain (where early contacter Mary Fulkerson was part of the dance faculty) and the School for New Dance Development in Amsterdam, which served as transmission belts for contact improvisation in Europe. Nancy Stark Smith was key to the organization of the first European Contact Improvisation Teachers Exchange. Subsequent exchanges have been organized since 1985 and hosted each year by a different European country. Belgian dancer and choreographer Patricia Kuypers noted in 1999 that, depending on the country and the individual, it has spread more or less rapidly in the world of dance or amateurs. In Belgium, where Steve Paxton had come since the 1980s, invited by the Klapstuk and the Kaaitheater, few professional dancers regularly practiced it, and apart from certain outbreaks of fever in successful jams, it can not be said that contact improvisation left any lasting trace among professional dancers, except in a choreographed form.Patricia Kuypers, Nouvelles de danse, Vol. 38-39, Bruxelles, 1999 = In France = In France, contact improvisation (sometimes called \\"danse- contact\\", as in French-speaking Canada) was introduced for the first time in 1978, where a contact improvisation course was given by Steve Paxton and Lisa Nelson during the musical festivities of Sainte Beaume: > Didier Silhol, Mark Tompkins, Suzanne Cotto, Edith Veyron and Martine > Muffat-Joly attended. Their enthusiasm brought them together, to explore > together this new form of dance, to organize new courses by bringing back > Steve Paxton, Lisa Nelson and by inviting other teachers such as Nancy Stark > Smith. In 1980, they created the association Danse Contact Improvisation and > began to teach themselves, mostly in pairs. Contact improvisation is now practiced in most major cities of the French metropolis - Paris, Grenoble, Lyon, Marseille, Montpellier, Lille, Rennes all have at least one weekly jam - and is taught in many conservatories, including the National Conservatory of Music and Dance of Paris.  In the world  The network of social practices or amateurs of contact improvisation has spread to all the continents except Antarctica, with a particularly intense presence in the Americas, Western and Eastern Europe, Finland, Russia, Israel, Japan, Australia, India, China and Malaysia, as evidenced by the regularity of the jams, festivals and weekly courses taught in these countries. Spaces of practice = Universities  In June 1980, Elizabeth Zimmer, organizer and director of the American Dance Guild, put together the conference Improvisation: Dance Considered as Art-Sport. The conference was mainly dedicated to contact improvisation, which had been referred to as an \\"art- sport\\" a few years earlier by Simone Forti, and introduced contact improvisation in the American academic world. Contact improvisation is now taught in a majority of American universities offering a choreographic curriculum (New York University, Oberlin College, Bennington College, Smith College, Ohio State University) as well as in many contemporary dance festivals (Jacob's Pillow, Bates Dance Festival). A contact improvisation trio (2017)  Jams  In the mid-1970s, the term \\"jam\\" appeared to describe, like jazz jam sessions and milongas in tango, a opportunity for free practice where dancers who do not know each other can meet and negotiate together their dance or observe the practice of their partners. > Every week in dozens of cities that make up an international network, > members of this Contact Improvisation \\"community of experience\\" meet for a > few hours in a dance studio for a jam. This hybrid practice seems to me to > work halfway between a bodily meditation, a psycho-kinesthetic therapy, a > sports training, and a dance improvised session.Deva Davina, \\"Some notes of > a contacter ethnographer\\", Nouvelles de danse, Vol. 38-39, Bruxelles, 1999, > p. 101 Jams also occur at multi-day residential courses led by a dancer or a group of dancers at conferences or festivals, where the days can alternate between free practices, courses by guest artists, and debates regularly bring practitioners together. = Inclusion = Some have argued that this relaxed space of practice favoured contact improvisation's inclusivity towards disabled movers: > Unlike a structured workshop or a performance, the Contact jam setting > allows for open-ended dancing, a mode particularly conducive to dancers with > different abilities. For one thing, it a lot easier to rest or stop and talk > with your partner... More than any other genre of dance, Contact > Improvisation has nurtured and embraced dancing that can integrate multiple > abilities and limitations. In fact, many of the most renowned nondisabled > Contact practitioners (including Steve Paxton), spend a lot of time > teaching, facilitating and dancing with disabled communities. = Sexual harassment = Women have expressed feeling uncomfortable on the dance floor and in the community, especially with men who overstep intimacy, bringing unwanted sexual energy into the connection. As a result, some people have decided to organize #MeToo disruptions of jams. To address sexual harassment issues, many jams are establishing jam guidelines and instigating other measures.  Improvisation structures = Interior techniques  Contact Improvisation involves technical aspects or \\"moves\\" that support the duets and create a recognizable style of movements: shoulder and hip lifts, head-to-head improvisation, table-top position (being on all fours, supporting the weight of the partner on the back), surfing (rolling on the floor, being \\"surfed by\\" the partner), and aikido rolls. But these are conceived of as the means to an end, which can be described as the dialogue of sensations of weight and touch between partners: > The body in [contact improvisation] is accordingly not merely a physical > body whose weight and momentum are subject to natural laws of gravity and > motion, but a responsive, experiencing body. Here it must be emphasized that > despite the use of the term ‚Äúinward focus‚Äù in Novack‚Äôs account, the > cultivation of kinaesthetic awareness cannot be equated with an > ‚Äúintrospective‚Äù preoccupation with private sensations; rather, the accent > lies on sensing-through the responsive body, combining both ‚Äúinternal > awareness‚Äù and ‚Äúresponsiveness to another‚Äù. Steve Paxton insisted on this aspect with the concept of \\"interior techniques\\" involving in the dance practice a training of perception, resting on investigations based on the sciences of the senses (physiology, experimental and ecological psychology, anatomy, and behaviour sciences). Lisa Nelson, in that regard, occupied a special place in the effervescence of the development of contact improvisation. Taking distance from the dance, she watched a lot through the eye of the camera and pursued personal research on the collaboration between the senses, in particular on the organization of kinaesthesia in relation to the way in which vision works (a practice later known as the \\"Tuning Scores\\"). As Patricia Kuypers remarked, \\"her staggered gaze nourished the maturation of the [contact improvisation], developing analysis of the perceptual system and revealing specific questions about how improvisation works.\\"  Round robin  The \\"round robin\\" is the most frequent structure of performances, this happens where small groups of dancers arrive in the center of a supporting circle of other dancers, who can at any time integrate the couples and replace one of the two dancers. Dancers are dressed casually (sweat pants, T-shirts) and performances can happen in many venues, including theaters, bookstores, galleries. The duration of the concerts can go from 20 minutes to 6 hours. Central to the poetics of the form is a desire to create a non-hierarchical way of developing the movement, based on the simple exchange of weight and touch between partners improvising together. This stance has been argued to reflect the counter-cultural context in which contact improvisation was developed (aftermath of the 1960s Vietnam War and Hippie movement).  \\"Underscore\\"  In the 1990s, Nancy Stark Smith, one of the most active propagators of contact improvisation and editor of Contact Quarterly, developed a practice out of her teachings called \\"the underscore.\\" It consisted of a score serving as a descriptive and prescriptive base for the practice of group improvisations. In this practice, vocabulary is tailored to fit the specific experiences of dancers and benefits from Nancy Stark Smith enmeshment with contact improvisation. > As a teacher of Contact Improvisation, she had observed that particular > warm-up exercises and movement activities were helpful in bringing dancers > to a state of body-mind preparedness for engaging in a Contact duet. The > Underscore is a scored collection of those exercises and activities, > complete with pictographs that represent each phase and subphase of its > progression. Some moments of the practice clearly refer to activities explored in the practice of Contact: * \\"Bonding with the earth\\" thus refers (in part) to the experience of the \\"Small Dance\\" * \\"Engagement\\" to the commitment that can be involved in a contact improvisation duet * \\"Skinesphere\\", the space beneath the skin (as opposed to the kinesphere, which is the space surrounding the body), refers to the inward focus involved in some somatic preparations for the practice of contact improvisation. Contact improvisation and contemporary dance= Similar simultaneous explorations  left The explorations envisaged in the first moments of contact improvisation are not specific to the collective led by Steve Paxton. Many other forms of dance had also experimented with weight, touch and improvisation and examples abound in the 1960s of dancers who practice something similar, but not as systematic as contact improvisation, including Trisha Brown, Grand Union, Daniel Nagrin's Workgroup, Anna Halprin 's San Francisco Dancers' Workshop, Julian Beck and Judith Malina's Living Theater or Carolee Schneeman's Meat Joy (1964). Simone Forti, for instance, developed Huddle in the 1960s. It was a dance in which six to seven dancers were invited to form together an agglutinated mass of which one by one they detached themselves to gradually reintegrate it, thus testing the tactile, olfactory and weight sensations.  As a resource for movement  Many contemporary choreographers today use contact improvisation as a significant resource for movement. This is the case with choreographers Bill T. Jones, Wim Vandekeybus and Antonija Livingstone, or in the companies Punchdrunk (especially in their famous site-specific 2011 production Sleep No More) and DV8 Physical Theater. References to contact improvisation vary: some are inspired by the qualities of the duet styles involving a specific use of touch, while others insist on the acrobatic dimension of contact improvisation and put forward situations of risk as means of reaching adrenalized states of performance. Many also perpetuate the work of sensation put forward by contact improvisation while making way for an interrogation on the relations between the genders that contact improvisation tends rather to make disappear behind an equality advocated but not always enforced. Companies like DV8 and The Cholmondeleys have thus produced choreographies based on a similar anti- mechanistic approach to that of contact improvisation, coupling it with interrogations on gendered roles.\\" Similarly, a number of early contactors - such as Keith Hennesy, Ishmael Houston-Jones, Bill T. Jones and his partner Arnie Zane - participated in the struggles for LGBT rights in the wake of the AIDS crisis of the 1980s. In Europe in particular, many improvisers were influenced by contact improvisation, especially from the 1980s. Examples of such dancers are Jo√£o Fiadeiro from the Portuguese New Dance, British improvisers Julyen Hamilton,Julyen Hamilton, \\" Contact Improvisation was a question of my generation ,\\" Nouvelles de danse, vol. 38-39 1999, P. 198 Kirstie Simson, and Charlie Morrissey, as well as North American artists who emigrated to Europe like Beno√Æt Lachambre, Mark Tompkins and Meg Stuart. Meg Stuart considers her lineage to be in the experimental approach to dance proposed in the early days of contact improvisation history: > If I could go back in dance history I would put myself at Oberlin College in > 1972, crashing into Steve Paxton and his students as we performed Magnesium. > I have always been passionate about Contact Improvisation. It is rare that > something experimental and radical is proposed in a dance studio, and out of > that research a language, a community, a world develops. Contact is not > defined as \\"Paxton's technique\\", it's an open field, a living form.

Development of movement material is facilitated through a variety of creative explorations including body mapping through levels, shape and dynamics schema. Improvisation is a free, seemingly unstructured, less technically strict and impulsive form that draws inspiration from everyday dance practices and influences. It is a movement technique that is capable of evoking dramatic and thought-provoking content just as well as more codified western dance techniques such as ballet and non-western movement forms. Dance improvisation is not only about creating new movement but is also defined as freeing the body from habitual movement patterns (see Postmodern dance and Judson Dance Theater). Dancer and singer Michael Jackson combined improvisation in both of those definitions, insisting that he had interest in performing a dance to Billie Jean only if he could do it a new way each time. A lot of improvisation is focused on finding a deeper way of comprehending otherwise concealed thoughts or feelings of an individual. Through the emphasis of instinctual, unpredictable, free movement that improvisation is centered upon the mover is able to explore authentic feelings and inspirations.  The history of improvisation in dance = Western theatrical dance  In the Renaissance Italy, improvisation was used and valued in performance and participatory dances. In performance-based settings in the 15th century, dancers used improvisation to alter or replace various steps or motions, particularly hand gestures, in choreography for the purpose of creating variety. This use of improvisation declined in the 16th century as set, specific choreography came to be favored over more individual, improvised motions. Improvisation was still used in some sense to enhance choreography during this time; however, this improvisation also became much more regulated and structured. For the following several centuries in the west, improvisation became used primarily as a method of creating choreography and remedying mistakes and mishaps during a performance. During the period of Romantic and classical ballet, improvisation was used very scarcely, however there remained a place for it in ballet performance. Primarily, improvisation was used in ballet at this time by certain exceptional principal dancers such as Marie Taglioni, Anna Pavlova, and Fanny Elssler who used improvisation to embellish their leading roles in ballets. It was not until the end of the 19th century, however, that dance improvisation in western dance became such a large part of performance and dance technique. Towards the end of the 19th and throughout the 20th century, with the beginning of what has become known as modern dance, dance improvisation flourished both as a choreographic tool as well as a method performance. In the late 19th century, Lo√Øe Fuller exemplified an explicit improvisational performance method with her use of task based and idiosyncratic movement that both allowed for and necessitated improvisation on the part of the dancer. Slightly later in the early 20th century, movement choruses, especially those under the direction of Mary Wigman and Rudolf Laban used improvisational techniques intensely in training, and to varying degrees in performance in accordance to the director's preference and opinion on the subject. In the second half of the 20th century, improvisation in dance exploded once more and was explored even more deeply by creators including but not limited to Isadora Duncan, Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey, Merce Cunningham, and Paul Taylor. Each of these individuals developed their own methodology and technique behind modern dance and employed improvisation in numerous different ways that were key to the choreography and execution of their techniques. It is important to note that although Isadora Duncan is often cited as having improvised her performances, this may be based more on the free, natural quality of her movement rather than actual fact. While some of her material was definitely set, it is likely that other parts were in fact improvised. Contact and group improvisation also evolved in this time with Yvonne Rainer‚Äôs formation of the Grand Union in 1970. The Grand Union was an improvisational dance group that performed improvisation that was not prepared or rehearsed beforehand. Furthermore, and in part thanks to theories on human development that were developed in the 19th century, improvisation started being used in dance therapy and dance education in the 20th century as well. Improvisation became a key part in the educational methods of many dance educators including Bird Larson and Margaret H‚ÄôDoubler who emphasized self- expression through dance improvisation. Many other important tenants of dance improvisation come from and were innovated by the African American community. From jazz to blues to hip hop to tap, so many major forms of improvisational dance were created in the African American community, making clear the incredible impact Black artists had and continue to have on dance improvisation as well as dance at large.  Latin American dance  African dance  African dance  Eastern dance =Developed dance forms with improvisational life=Argentine tango Argentine tango is a dance form that despite the apparent choreography relies on improvisation. Improvisation techniques are taught and improvisation is encouraged as necessary to reach high levels of competency in dance and performance environments. Closely knit crowds, varying rhythmic patterns in music, switching partners for each dance, and a large vocabulary of movements encourage improvisational dance in Argentine tango. Belly dance Belly dance is one of the most commonly improvised dance forms, since the often live music does not support the structured nature of choreography. Professional belly dancers may dance publicly 6 nights a week, up to three times a night, and simply do not have the time to choreograph for the 15‚Äì60 minutes a night that such performing requires. Even dancers with substantial choreography repertoires often choose to improvise when performing to live music because they value the exchange of energy between the dancer, the musicians, and the audience, which is heightened by working \\"in the moment\\". American Tribal Style belly dance and Improvisational Tribal Style are built entirely upon group improvisation, although the group will typically plan and rehearse individual combinations and their cues in advance. Blues Blues dance is generally done to blues music, and is highly improvisational. Like lindy hop, emphasis is on the lead and follow connection, but the emphasis is even greater. Blues dance is a partnered and structured form of interpretive dance, and relies mostly on the leader interpreting the music how he or she will; at the same time, the follower usually has some freedom to interpret the music and add in his or her own style as well. Break dance B-boying features a heavily improvisational style based on cyclic movement patterns. Many styles of b-boying exist, and dance crews will often choreograph performances for specific songs. Individual performances are more commonly improvised due to the nature of the dance. Lindy Hop Lindy Hop is generally an eight-count swing dance, developed in large part by Frankie Manning, and includes a large amount of improvisation. Once a dancer has learned a variety of swing dance moves, ranging from West Coast Swing to Charleston to Balboa, the dancer will often combine any and all the moves he or she knows of these styles of dance, as well as add his or her own dance style, or make up new dance moves or aerials. Because of its improvisational nature, lindy hop heavily relies on lead and follow connection, rather than each partner knowing the steps and doing them together. Post-modern dance and contact improvisation In the 1970s, Judson Church dancer and choreographer Steve Paxton, in collaboration with other post-modern dancers, developed Contact Improvisation. \\"Contact improv\\" is an un-codified, somatic technique which serves as a framework for collective improvisation. It involves multiple dancers, usually two, who explore movement together by supporting each other's weight, maintaining contact with each other, and bringing their attention to the point or points of contact between them. Unlike the pas de deux of classical ballet, in which the male partner lifts and supports the female, contact improvisation does not assign differential roles to each dancer. There are no officially codified or standardized movements, but partners commonly lift, carry, fall onto or off of, caress, and lean on each other. Contact improvisation is sometimes used by post-modern choreographers to generate or develop choreography.

The channel is marked by a number of navigation aids (green cans no. 5 and 7 at the northeast entrance, and green gong no. 1, marking low water off the tip of Governors Island). Tidal currents on the channel are rather strong.  History  Origins of the name are uncertain but it is alleged to be a reference to the dairy farmers who used to cross this channel by boat to sell their milk in Manhattan markets. Some people believe that the channel got its name because crossing it was so rough that the farmers' milk was churned into butter by the time they reached Manhattan. According to another legend, before the channel was dredged to accommodate cargo ships,\\"The passage between Governor's-Island and Long- Island, formerly called Butter-milk channel, and within the memory of man, both narrow and shallow, is now eight fathoms deep,\\" reported The Medical Repository, February‚ÄìApril 1806, p 433, quoted at The Big Apple: Buttermilk Channel. cows were walked across it at low tide to graze on Governors Island.

The former is now the Red Hook Container Port and the Brooklyn Cruiseship Terminal, while the latter is now the site of the Brooklyn IKEA.

Roberts' streaking began when he saw a news report about a female streaker at a 1993 Rugby Sevens game in Hong Kong. After a bet in a bar, he went naked in front of the crowd himself the next day. Roberts has done this, as of 2018, 565 times in 23 countries, targeting such events as Hamilton Race Course, a Mr. Universe contest, a Miss World contest, tennis matches, the bull run in Pamplona, the synchronized swimming world championship in Barcelona, and his specialty, association football matches.Mark Roberts, Professional Streaker, accessed 23 November 2007 According to Roberts, he was mandated to surrender his passport whenever an English football team played abroad following a 2001 conviction for streaking. It is unclear how long this mandate was in place. One famous streak was on a live 1995 broadcast of This Morning, where he swam onto Fred Talbot's floating weather map and proceeded to emulate Talbot's trademark leap from Scotland to Ireland. A 2002 advertisement created by the ad agency Dimension (Spain) for Spanish sportswear company Athletic Bilbao featured Mark Roberts streaking fully clothed during a nude football game. It won a bronze award at the 2003 Cannes Festival. In January 2003, Roberts flew to San Diego, California, United States, where he planned to streak at the Super Bowl XXXVII. He was unable to get tickets to that game, but succeeded next year on Super Bowl XXXVIII, in Houston, Texas. Just before the start of the second half, he ran onto the field disguised as a referee, undressed, and performed a little dance wearing only a thong. Tackled by members of the New England Patriots and Carolina Panthers, as well as by police and security, he was taken into custody. In June 2004 he was given a fine of $1000 for trespassing.Streaker Avoids Jail , Sky News, 22 July 2004 Roberts planned on retiring by streaking at the 2006 World Cup final in Germany, but was stopped before he could enter the stadium. Later on, in 2007 Roberts ran out on the field of Wembley Stadium during the NFL's first regular season game outside of North America between the New York Giants and Miami Dolphins. The very next year, Roberts struck again, this time in the final of the 2008 World Snooker Championship between Ronnie O'Sullivan and Ali Carter. He did so previously at the same venue in 2004. In March 2010 Roberts was seen sporting a cat-shaped mask over his genitals at Crufts. In 2011 the artist Benedikt Dichgans hired Roberts to streak in Tate Britain and at the Turner Prize but it ended in arrest. He was also featured in the 2011 Banksy-produced documentary, The Antics Roadshow. In 2013, he was subject of the Channel 4 documentary Streak! The Man Who Can't Keep His Clothes On. He announced his forthcoming retirement but not before one last streak. In 2018, Mark Roberts made his first appearance since 2013 by taking to the ice at the Gangneung Oval on Friday in nothing but a pink tutu and skimpy underwear during the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea. As soon as the men's 1,000-meter speed skating medal ceremony concluded, Roberts took to the ice with the words \\"peace and love\\" emblazoned across his bare chest.

Is also present in a section of the modern charismatic movement of Christianity, in which the term is fixed. Christian faith The \\"Prophetic Dance\\" phenomenon as practiced in the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) or Word of Faith type churches can be classified in two distinct forms. The first type most commonly involves the use of pageantry, presentation, and performance. Flags, banners, and processionals are just a few ways performers claim to be used to minister to God in the form of entertainment. It is claimed to have profoundly prophetic overtones geared primarily for the benefit of God. The second form of prophetic dance or movement involves the \\"vehicle\\" or person being used, with claims to minister to and for the benefit of the people watching. Believers feel that through dancing or any movements they feel are inspired by God, they can and will become His voice at that moment. They further subscribe to the belief that an experienced person not versed in dance vocabulary but who believes they are relationally with God can use this medium to heal, deliver, and set people free from all types of sickness and disease. In essence, the claims of channeling of spiritual energy, to convey messages, heal or use of the body's corresponding movements as a medium have striking similarities to Shaktipat used in Kundalini prophetic dance and worship. Prophetic acts in dance and symbols Possible elements of the prophetic dance are biblical symbols or representations of what one wants to achieve prophetically - making prophetic acts then - such as flags, banners, robes and veils denoting that \\"Yahweh is my flag\\", \\"The Lord of hosts\\", \\"His Flag about me is Love\\", bundles of wheat and baskets of fruits and bread (spiritual harvests of new or physical lives), clay vases (human nature), chandelier, wine, olive oil and essential oils (myrrh, nard acacia, etc.), fire and water (symbols of the Holy Spirit). The dance may have ethnic, martial (marches, sports and fights), intense or mild, symbolic, indicative or iconic movements, wide or directed (to people, geographical directions and localities), use of flags and banners, designating spiritual warfare or seizure of territories (spiritually); scepter and sticks, crown, representing the Sovereign Lord Jesus or being more poetic and passionate in a more intimate worship or being more extravagant and loose, showing freedom, joy, spiritual ecstasy. Just as it can be simple and dispense with apparatuses, using only the intimate prophetic sense or there is no occasion for Christian feasts or specific prophetic acts. Priestly robes and meanings Biblical spiritual meaning of the garments: - Purity, clarity (Ec. 9.8): Your garments must be white, pure. A minister's robes never appeal to the sensual; - Sacred robes for glory and ornament (Ex. 28.3); - The wealth of details (Ex. 28.4); - Considered sacred and separate for something specific. The dance among the Hebrews was loaded with symbols taken from their traditions, it was strictly of a religious character. It had ritualistic characteristics, with a certain limit of layout such as wheels, line dances, rotating dances, there was also improvisation. The dance of this people was loaded with symbols taken from their traditions. Fabrics were used which meant: water, blood, wind, touch, wrap, cover and protect. There were colored ribbons that resembled joy, fire, intensity and fervor. Tambourines (tambourines) were also used, alluding to Miri√£'s dance. Today, colors are commonly used in praise garments (priestly), or in scenery, or in long or medium cloths, robes and thin individual covers, representing the movement of the Spirit or the prophetic anointing or the Bride (Church) as red and silver (redemption), blue (deity of Christ), golden (royalty), purple (nobility, dignity and fidelity), white (holiness, peace), even other colors can be used as black for the symbol of radical Christian youth (such as the International Ministry of Restoration does), or gray (humiliation to God) or even multicolored robes: the prophet perceives and designates the prophetic significance of the symbols or uses colors or signs that represent the country, city, state or occasion and contexts to be perpetrated blessings. Ministerial dances The description of ministerial dances by their functions follows: Masters of dance (maestral dance): the Levite as a teacher teaches the church to follow the commandments of God, sharing the knowledge given by the Lord to the church that needs to know its attributions as the Body of Christ, either through dances or theater dances, guiding how a Christian should act in the face of diverse situations, such as temptations, trials and current dilemmas. This ministry is all about ministering God's principles to the church, ministers and worshipers. Perhaps it is the most important of all, or rather, it is the basis for others. Dance apostles: Apostolic dance occurs when the worshiper for dance or other artistic expression does something that generates influence and acts directly in the implantation of the Kingdom of God on earth. It is, inevitably, a war dance (spiritual), a confrontation between light and darkness, with victory in Christ, when this dance is totally directed by the Holy Spirit. There are tangible and noticeable fruits and effects, such as healing and spiritual liberation, mass conversions, the fruit of the arrival of the Kingdom of God in the locality, city or country. Dance prophets (in prophetic dance): they wage spiritual warfare and prophesy through worship the union of the Bridegroom with His Church, spontaneously expressing what God wants to minister at the moment or what He wants to reveal to people and the local church. Dance evangelists (evangelistic dance): it is the one who makes the Son of God known, seeks to reach the hearts of people through his dance, showing the need to receive Christ and to follow Him. It is the ministry most commonly seen in churches. Dance pastors (pastoral dance): feed the worshipers, feed, bring direction and transformation to the Christian personal life in the Word manifested and expressed in the dance.

Conversion to public use In October 1995 the United States Coast Guard announced it would close its largest base, at Governors Island, as a cost savings measure. The Coast Guard had established the base on the island in 1966 after the U.S. Army closed Fort Jay, an Army post since 1794. In 1996, the Coast Guard closed the base and conveyed it as surplus property to the federal government's General Services Administration for disposal through transfer or sale. The closure was at the initiative of the Coast Guard, then a bureau of the U.S. Department of Transportation, which was seeking to close a $400 million budget gap. The closure of the base represented an estimated 30 million dollar savings. Since the closure was an initiated action by the Coast Guard, it was not subject to the Base Realignment and Closure process. At the time of the closure announcement in October 1995, President Bill Clinton and New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan reached an informal agreement to convey the island to the city and state of New York for $1, if a plan for public benefit could be developed. The city was initially reluctant to take up Clinton's offer because it would not have been financially beneficial to the city. The issue was exacerbated when the United States Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act in August 1997, stipulating that the GSA sell the island at a fair market value by 2002. The island's sale was expected to net the federal government $500 million. Map of Governors Island as of 2014 Establishment of the monument As President Clinton left office in January 2001, with no resolution of the island's future in hand, and at the urging of members of the New York congressional delegation, he established a Governors Island National Monument by Presidential Proclamation 7402 of January 19, 2001. The proclamation did not fully establish the boundaries of the monument, but did set forth the federal intention of preserving the fortifications, Fort Jay and Castle Williams, the oldest and most historic features on the island.\\"Establishment of the Governors Island National Monument\\" (January 20, 2001) The Justice Department under President George W. Bush concluded the proclamation possessed technical errors, but did not revoke or invalidate the proclamation. In an April 2002 White House meeting with city and state officials, President Bush announced his intention to sell the island to the city and state of New York. While the White House intended the transaction to be concluded by September 2002, it took several months of negotiations with city, state and federal officials to resolve outstanding issues. On January 31, 2003, the island was conveyed to an intermediary, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which attached restrictive land use covenants to the deed, then conveyed the island to two parties: was conveyed to the U.S. Department of the Interior for use as a national monument; and went to the Governors Island Preservation and Education Corporation, formed jointly by the State and City of New York - now The Trust for Governors Island, an instrumentality of the City of New York - for the purpose of administering and redeveloping the island. Presidential Proclamation 7647 of February 7, 2003 formally re-affirmed the establishment of the national monument. Significance The entrance to Fort Jay, dating to 1794-1796, is the oldest structure on Governors Island. Admiral's House\\" is just outside the boundary of the national monument, but included in the Governors Island National Historic Landmark District. Both presidential proclamations noted that the island served as an outpost to protect New York City from sea attack. Between 1806 and 1811, Castle Williams and Fort Jay were constructed as part of the First and Second American System of Coastal Fortification; they played important roles in the War of 1812, the Civil War, and World Wars I and II. The fortifications were built on the most strategic defensive positions on the island. Fort Jay, first constructed in the 1790s and reconstructed between 1806 and 1809, is on the highest point of the island. The surrounding open space or glacis slopes down to the waterfront on all sides. Castle Williams, started in 1807 and completed in November 1811, occupies a rocky shoal that extended into the harbor channel at the northwest corner of the island and served as the most important strategic defensive point in the upper bay of New York Harbor. By the 1830s, the protective functions of both fortifications had diminished, but the core of a small urban Army post evolved around them. By the 1870s, with deep reductions in a post- Civil War army, the post became a major headquarters for the U.S. Army, a role it played until their departure in 1966. The residential and institutional structures surrounding the two fortifications are now part of the Governors Island National Historic Landmark District, containing over 60 structures related to two centuries of the military history of the nation. Since the island was managed by the United States Army and the United States Coast Guard for nearly 200 years, and was no longer required for defense or Coast Guard purposes, the establishment of the monument provided an excellent opportunity for the public to observe and understand the harbor history, its defense and its ecology. The island and monument has been open on a seasonal basis during the summer months since 2005. The island became more popular over the years, attracting 275,000 visitors in 2009 and 800,000 visitors in 2018.

Some liturgical dance was common in ancient times or non- Western settings, with precedents in Judaism beginning with accounts of dancing in the Old Testament. An example is the episode when King David danced before the Ark of the Covenant (), but this instance is often considered to be outside of Jewish norms and Rabbinic rituals prescribed at the time. Dance has historically been controversial within Christianity. Many records exist of prohibitions by leaders of most branches of the Christian Church, for such reasons as the association of dance with paganism, the use of dance for sexual purposes, and a Greek-influenced belief in the separation of soul and body. Beginning in the second half of the 20th century, there was a significant growth in the use of dance in Christian worship. This received a boost from the charismatic movement of the 1970s, which initiated a transition to contemporary worship in many churches. A distinctive style of worship dance has developed within Messianic Judaism. Known as messianic dance or davidic dance (for King David), it sometimes incorporates elements of Israeli Folk Dancing.

In July 751 AD, Tang and Abbasid forces met in the valley of the Talas River to vie for control over the Syr Darya region of central Asia. After several days of stalemate, the Karluk Turks, originally allied to the Tang, defected to the Abbasids and tipped the balance of power, resulting in a Tang rout. The defeat marked the end of the Tang westward expansion and resulted in Muslim control of Transoxiana for the next 400 years. Control of the region was economically beneficial for the Abbasids because it was on the Silk Road. Historians debate whether or not Chinese prisoners captured in the aftermath of the battle brought paper-making technology to the Middle East, where it eventually spread to Europe.  Location  The exact location of the battle has not been confirmed but is believed to be near Trainville Taraz and Talas on the border of present-day Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The Chinese name Daluosi (ÊÄõÁæÖÊñØ, Talas) was first seen in the account of Xuanzang. Du Huan located the city near the western drain of the Chui River.Bai, p. 211. The war was the contention between Tang dynasty and the Abbasid Caliphate at the Transoxiana area. Background Map of the Tang Dynasty circa 700 AD showing its expanded western territories at that time, connected to the main part of the empire by the long and narrow Hexi Corridor. Before the battle, there were other indirect encounters between some of the combatants, and the military might of China had been projected beyond the harsh continental climate and the dry, desolate, and difficult terrain of the Tarim Basin, much of which consists of the Taklamakan Desert, as early as the Han dynasty, when Emperor Wu of Han sent military expeditions to seize horses, which got as far as the Fergana Valley. Then, in 715, Alutar, the new king of Fergana, was installed with the help of the Arabs of the Umayyad Caliphate. The deposed king Ikhshid fled to Kucha (seat of Anxi Protectorate), and sought Chinese intervention. The Chinese sent 10,000 troops under Zhang Xiaosong to Ferghana. He defeated the Arab puppet-ruler Alutar at Namangan and reinstalled Ikhshid. The inhabitants of three Sogdian cities were massacred as a result of the battle.Bai, pp. 235‚Äì36 The second encounter occurred in 717, when Arabs were guided by the Turgesh and besieged two cities in the area of Aksu at the Battle of Aksu (717). The commander of the Chinese Protectorate General to Pacify the West, Tang Jiahui, responded using two armies, one composed of Karluk mercenaries led by Ashina Xin (client qaghan of Onoq) and another composed of Tang regulars led by Jiahui himself. The Tang dynasty Chinese defeated the Umayyad invaders at the battle of Aksu. The Arab Umayyad commander Al-Yashkuri and his army fled to Tashkent after they were defeated. Arab sources claim Qutayba ibn Muslim briefly took Kashgar from China and withdrew after an agreement but modern historians entirely dismiss this claim. In the year 750, Abu al-'Abbas al-Saffah (As-Saffah), the founder of the Abbasid Caliphate, launched a massive rebellion (known as the Abbasid Revolution) against the incumbent Umayyad Caliphate from the province of Khurasan. After his decisive victory at the Battle of the Zab and eliminating those of the Umayyad family who failed to escape to Al-Andalus, As-Saffah sent his forces to consolidate his caliphate, including Central Asia, where his forces confronted many regional powers, including those of China's Tang Dynasty. Battle The numeric quantities of the combatants involved in the Battle of Talas are not known with certainty; however, various estimates exist. The Abbasid army (200,000 Muslim troops according to Chinese estimates, though these numbers may be greatly exaggerated) which included contingents from their Tibetan ally met the combined army of 10,000 Tang Chinese and 20,000 Karluk mercenaries (Arab records put the Chinese forces at 100,000 which also may be greatly exaggerated).The strength of Arabs is not recorded for this battle, but the armies to the east of Khorasan controlled by the Arabs later were estimated by the Chinese in 718 with 900,000 troops available to respond according to Bai Shouyi, Bai however never estimate any Abbasid army figures. (Bai 2003, pp. 225‚Äì26). In the month of July 751, the Abbasid forces joined in combat with the Tang Chinese force (the combined army of Tang Chinese and Karluk mercenaries) on the banks of the Talas river. Modern view of Talas River, which starts in the mountains of Kyrgyzstan and winds down into Kazakhstan. On the right side of the river is the city of Taraz. The Tang army was subjected to a devastating defeat. The Tang dynasty's defeat was due to the defection of Karluk mercenaries and the retreat of Ferghana allies who originally supported the Chinese. The Karluk mercenaries, two-thirds of the Tang army, defected to the Abbasids during the battle; Karluk troops attacked the Tang army from close quarters while the main Abbasid forces attacked from the front. The Tang troops were unable to hold their positions, and the commander of the Tang forces, Gao Xianzhi, recognized that defeat was imminent and managed to escape with some of his Tang regulars with the help of Li Siye. Out of an estimated 10,000 Tang troops, only 2,000 managed to return from Talas to their territory in Central Asia. Despite losing the battle, Li did inflict heavy losses on the pursuing Arab army after being reproached by Duan Xiushi. After the battle, Gao was prepared to organize another Tang army against the Arabs when the devastating An Shi Rebellion broke out in 755. When the Tang capital was taken by rebels, all Chinese armies stationed in Central Asia were ordered back to China proper to crush the rebellion.Bai, pp. 226‚Äì28. Aftermath and historical significance Shortly after the battle of Talas, the domestic rebellion of An Lushan (755‚Äì63) and subsequent warlordism gave the Arabs the opportunity to further expand into Central Asia as Tang influence in the region retreated. The local Tang tributaries then switched to the authority of the Abbasids, Tibetans, or Uighurs and the introduction of Islam was thus facilitated among the Turkic peoples. It was the An Lushan Rebellion and not the defeat at Talas that ended the Tang Chinese presence in Central Asia and forced them to withdraw from Xinjiang‚ÄîTalas was of no strategic importance, because the Arabs did not advance any further after the battle.ed. Starr 2004, p. 39.Millward 2007, p. 36. A small minority of Karluks converted to Islam after the battle. The majority of Karluks did not convert to Islam until the mid 10th century under Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan when they established the Kara-Khanid Khanate.Lapidus 2012, p. 230.Esposito 1999, p. 351.Lifchez & Algar 1992, p. 28.Soucek 2000, p. 84. This was long after the Tang dynasty was gone from Central Asia. Abu al-'Abbas al-Saffah, whose forces were known to the Chinese as the Black Robed Ta-Shih, spent his wealth on warfare. He died in the year 752 AD. His brother who succeeded him as the second Abbasid Caliph Abu Jafar al-Mansur (r. 754‚Äì775 AD) (A-p‚Äôuch‚Äôa-fo) helped the Chinese Emperor Suzong of Tang after he appealed for help during the An-Shi Rebellion in regaining control of his capital Chang'an from the treacherous commander, An Lushan, or his successors in the abortive Yan Dynasty. Abu Jafar al-Mansur responded by sending 4,000 men who helped the Tang troops in recapturing the city and were well rewarded by the Chinese Emperor. After the rebellion was repressed they were allowed to settle down permanently in China which helped in founding of the earliest Muslim communities in China. Some of them married local Chinese people and their descendants became native-born Muslims who retained their religious tradition and unique way of life. In 760, a large scale massacre of wealthy Arab and Persian merchants occurred in China during the Yangzhou massacre, at the hands of Chinese rebels led by Tian Shengong. In 879 during the Guangzhou massacre, 120,000 to 200,000 Arab Muslim, Persian Zoroastrian, Jewish, and Christian foreign merchants in Guangzhou were massacred by Chinese rebels under Huang Chao. The culture of Central Asia, once a mixture of Persian, Indian, and Chinese influences, disappeared under the power struggles between the empires of the Arabs, Chinese, Turks, Tibetans, and Uyghurs. Islam grew as the dominant cultural force of Central Asia. With the decline of Central Asian Buddhism, Chinese Buddhism was now cut off from Indian Buddhism and developed into an independent religion with distinct spiritual elements. Indigenous Buddhist traditions like Pure Land Buddhism and Zen emerged in China. China became the center of East Asian Buddhism, following the Chinese Buddhist canon, as Buddhism spread to Japan and Korea from China. Among the earliest historians to proclaim the importance of this battle was the great Russian historian of Muslim Central Asia, Vasily Bartold, of 20th century according to whom, \\"The earlier Arab historians, occupied with the narrative of events then taking place in western Asia, do not mention this battle; but it is undoubtedly of great importance in the history of (Western) Turkestan as it determined the question which of the two civilizations, the Chinese or the Muslim, should predominate in the land (of Turkestan).\\" The loss of 8,000 troops to the Tang empire can be compared to a troop strength of more than 500,000 before the Anshi rebellion.Bai, pp. 219‚Äì23. According to Bartold, for the history of the first three centuries of Islam, al-Tabari was the chief source (survived in Ibn al Athir's compilation), which was brought down to 915. It is only in Athir that we find an account of the conflict between the Arabs and the Chinese in 751. Neither Tabari nor the early historical works of the Arabs which have come down to us in general make any mention of this; however, Athir's statement is completely confirmed by the Chinese History of the Tang Dynasty.Barthold, pp. 2‚Äì3. In all Arab sources, the events which occurred in the eastern part of the empire are often dealt with briefly.Barthold, p. 5. Another notable informant of the battle on the Muslim side was Al-Dhahabi (1274‚Äì1348).Barry Hoberman (1982). The Battle of Talas , Saudi Aramco World. The Battle of Talas did not mark the end of Buddhism or Chinese influence in the region. The Buddhist Kara-Khitan Khanate defeated the Muslim Seljuq Turks and the Muslim Kara-Khanid Turks at the Battle of Qatwan in 1141, conquering a large part of Central Asia from the Muslim Karluk Kara- Khanid Khanate in the 12th century. The Kara-Khitans also reintroduced the Chinese system of Imperial government, since China was still held in respect and esteem in the region among even the Muslim population,Biran 2012, p. 90.Biran 2012, p. 90. and the Kara-Khitans used Chinese as their main official language.Pozzi & Janhunen & Weiers 2006, p. 114. The Kara-Khitan rulers were called \\"the Chinese\\" by the Muslims.Biran 2005, p. 93. Professor Denis Sinor said that it was interference in the internal affairs of the Western Turkic Khaganate which ended Chinese supremacy in Central Asia, since the destruction of the Western Khaganate rid the Muslims of their greatest opponent, and it was not the Battle of Talas which ended the Chinese presence.Sinor 1990, p. 344. Later during the reign of Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid, the Arabs terminated their alliance with the Tibetan Empire,Chaliand 2004, p. 32. and established an alliance with China after sending envoys to China in 789.Bloodworth & Bloodworth 1976, p. 214.Giles 1926, p. 138. Papermaking One of the five major steps in ancient Chinese paper making process. The Battle of Talas was a key event in the technological transmission of paper-making. After the battle of Talas, knowledgeable Chinese prisoners of war were ordered to produce paper in Samarkand, or so the story goes.Bai, pp. 242‚Äì43. In fact, high quality paper had been known‚Äîand made‚Äîin Central Asia for centuries; a letter on paper survives from the fourth century to a merchant in Samarkand, but the Islamic conquest of Central Asia in the late seventh and early eighth centuries opened up this knowledge for the first time to what became the Muslim world. By the year 794 AD, paper manufacturing could be found in Baghdad, modern-day Iraq. The technology of paper making was thus transmitted to and revolutionised the Islamic world, and later the European West. The paper production was a state secret, and only some places and Buddhist Monks knew the technology. Of course, the paper was transported many kilometers as a Chinese luxury product, and as it was traded, the finding of paper in several places is not proof of production, but merely of use. Geopolitical aftermath Other than the transfer of paper, there is no evidence to support a geopolitical or demographic change resulting from this battle. In fact, it seems that Tang influence over Central Asia even strengthened after 751 and that by 755, Tang power in Central Asia was at its zenith. Several of the factors after the battle had been taken note of prior to 751. Firstly, the Karluks never in any sense remained opposed to the Chinese after the battle. In 753, the Karluk Yabgu Dunpijia submitted under the column of Cheng Qianli and captured A-Busi, a betrayed Chinese mercenary of Tongluo (Tiele) chief (who had defected earlier in 743), and received his title in the court on 22 October.Xue, pp. 260‚Äì81. The Chinese Muslim historian Bai Shouyi wrote that furthermore, at the same time that Talas took place, the Tang also sent an army from Shibao city in Qinghai to Suyab and consolidated Chinese control over the Turgesh. Chinese expansion in Central Asia did not halt after the battle; the Chinese commander Feng Changqing, who took over the position from Gao Xianzhi through Wang Zhengjian, virtually swept across the Kashmir region and captured Gilgit shortly two years later. Even Tashkent reestablished its vassal status in 753, when the Tang bestowed a title to its ruler. The Chinese influence to the west of the Pamir Mountains certainly did not cease as the result of the battle; Central Asian states under Muslim control, such as Samarkand, continued to request aid from the Tang against the Arabs in spite of Talas and hence in 754, all nine kingdoms of Western Turkestan again sent petitions to the Tang to attack the Arabs and the Tang continued to turn down such requests as it did for decades. Ferghana, which participated in the battle earlier, in fact joined among the central Asian auxiliaries with the Chinese army under a summons and entered Gansu during An Lushan's revolt in 756.Bai, pp. 233‚Äì34. Bai also noted that neither did the relations between the Chinese and Arabs worsen, as the Abbasids, like their predecessors (since 652), continued to send embassies to China uninterruptedly after the battle. Such visits had overall resulted in 13 diplomatic gifts between 752 and 798.Bai, pp. 239‚Äì42.

It is the eighth largest natural freshwater lake among the 50 states of the United States and the second largest natural freshwater lake contained entirely within the contiguous 48 states. Okeechobee covers and is exceptionally shallow for a lake of its size, with an average depth of only . The Kissimmee River, located directly north of Lake Okeechobee, is the lake's primary source. The lake is divided between Glades, Okeechobee, Martin, Palm Beach, and Hendry counties. All five counties meet at one point near the center of the lake.Counties of Florida map from U.S. Census Bureau. History The name Okeechobee comes from the Hitchiti words oki (water) and chubi (big). Mayaimi, meaning \\"big water,\\" is the oldest known name, as reported in the 16th century, by Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda.Hahn:11 Slightly later in the 16th century, Ren√© Goulaine de Laudonni√®re reported hearing about a large freshwater lake in southern Florida called Serrope.Hann:148 By the 18th century the largely mythical lake was known to British mapmakers and chroniclers by the Spanish name Laguna de Espiritu Santo.Hanna:32 In the early 19th century it was known as Mayacco Lake or Lake Mayaca after the Mayaca people, originally from the upper reaches of the St. Johns River, who moved near the lake in the early 18th century.Hann:99 The modern Port Mayaca on the east side of the lake preserves that name. On the southern rim of Lake Okeechobee, three islands‚ÄîKreamer, Ritta, and Torey‚Äîwere once settled by early pioneers. These settlements had a general store, post office, school, and town elections. Farming was the main vocation. The fertile land was challenging to farm because of the muddy muck. Over the first half of the twentieth century, farmers used agricultural tools‚Äîincluding tractors‚Äîto farm in the muck. By the 1960s, all of these settlements were abandoned. All of Lake Okeechobee was included in the boundaries of Palm Beach County when it was created in 1909. In 1963, the lake was divided among the five counties surrounding the lake. Hurricanes In 1926, the Great Miami Hurricane hit the Lake Okeechobee area, killing approximately 300 people. Two years later in 1928, the Okeechobee Hurricane crossed over the lake, killing thousands. The Red Cross reported 1,836 deaths, a figure which the National Weather Service initially accepted, but in 2003, the number was revised to \\"at least 2,500\\". In both cases the catastrophe was caused by flooding from a storm surge when strong winds drove water over the mud dike that circled the lake at the time. After the two hurricanes, the Florida State Legislature created the \\"Okeechobee Flood Control District\\". The organization was authorized to cooperate with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in actions to prevent similar disasters. U.S. President Herbert Hoover visited the area personally, and afterward the Corps designed a plan incorporating the construction of channels, gates, and nearly 140 miles of levees to protect areas surrounding Lake Okeechobee from overflow. The Okeechobee Waterway was officially opened on March 23, 1937, by a procession of boats which left Fort Myers, Florida on March 22 and arrived at Stuart, Florida the following day. The dike was then named the \\"Herbert Hoover Dike\\" in honor of the president. The 1947 Fort Lauderdale Hurricane sent an even larger storm surge to the crest of the new dike, causing it to be expanded again in the 1960s. Four recent hurricanes -Frances, Jeanne, Wilma, and Irma ‚Äì had no major adverse effects on communities surrounding Lake Okeechobee, even though the lake rose after Hurricane Wilma in 2005. Tropical Storm Ernesto increased water levels by in 2006, the last time it exceeded . However, the lake's level began dropping soon after and by July 2007, it had dropped more than to its all-time low of . In August 2008, Tropical Storm Fay increased water levels to above sea level, the first time it exceeded since January 2007. Over a seven-day period (including some storms that preceded Fay), about of rain fell directly onto the lake. Rim Canal Lake Okeechobee, from Canal Point, Florida Sounds of Lake Okeechobee, from the Canal Point Recreation Area, Canal Point, Florida, USA During construction of the dike, earth was excavated along the inside perimeter, resulting in a deep channel which runs along the perimeter of the lake. In most places the canal is part of the lake, but in others it is separated from the open lake by low grassy islands such as Kreamer Island. During the drought of 2007-2008, this canal remained navigable while much of surrounding areas were too shallow or even above the water line. Even when the waters are higher, navigating the open lake can be tricky, whereas the rim canal is simple, so to reach a specific location in the lake it is often easiest to go around the rim canal to get close then take one of the many channels into the lake. Environmental concerns Lake Okeechobee from space in July 2016 In 2007, during a drought, state water and wildlife managers removed thousands of truckloads of toxic mud from the lake's floor, in an effort to restore the lake's natural sandy base and create clearer water and better habitat for wildlife. The mud contained elevated levels of arsenic and other pesticides. According to tests from the South Florida Water Management District, arsenic levels on the northern part of the lake bed were as much as four times the limit for residential land. Independent tests found the mud too polluted for use on agricultural or commercial lands, and therefore difficult to dispose of on land.\\"Polluted Muck Taken from Florida's Lake Okeechobee Prompts Fears on Land\\", Environmental News Network Through early 2008, the lake remained well below normal levels, with large portions of the lake bed exposed above the water line. During this time, portions of the lake bed, covered in organic matter, dried out and caught fire.Lake Okeechobee Brush Fire, WINK News In late August 2008, Tropical Storm Fay inundated Florida with record amounts of rain. Lake Okeechobee received almost a increase in water level, including local run-off from the tributaries. In 2013, heavy rains in central Florida resulted in high runoff into the lake; rising lake levels forced the CoE (Army Corps of Engineers) to release large volumes of polluted water from the lake through the St. Lucie River estuary to the east and the Caloosahatchee River estuary to the west. Thus the normal mix of fresh and salt water in those estuaries was replaced by a flood of polluted fresh water resulting in ecological damage. Since 2013, the CoE has been forced to pump billions of gallons of water out of the lake to avoid jeopardizing the integrity of the Hoover dike holding back the water from inundating the surrounding populated area. Some claim that sugar plantations have been pumping polluted water from their flooded fields into the lake, but U.S. Sugar claims back pumping is only to avoid flooding of communities, never to protect farmland. In March 2015, the rate was daily. This results in pollution problems for the Treasure Coast, St. Lucie estuary, and the Indian River Lagoon. In May 2016, of the southern portion of the lake were affected by an algal bloom. The outbreak was possibly due in part to nutrient-laden waters reaching the lake from farms and other sources. Microcystin was found among the other species involved in the outbreak. In July 2016, the Federal Government denied Governor Rick Scott's request for Federal Disaster Aid to the Treasure Coast as a result of the toxic algal bloom in the St. Lucie Estuary which was responsible for millions of dollars of lost income for local businesses: this reaffirmed the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) finding that the lake's water quality was a State issue. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection and Martin County had carried out toxicity testing on the algae, but had not funded any work to clean up the water, and a FEMA spokesman said that \\"The state has robust capability to respond to emergencies and disasters.\\" On June 23, 2017, the South Florida Water Management District was granted emergency permission to back pump clean water into Lake Okeechobee to save animals and plants in bloated water conservation areas.\\" Geology Lake Okeechobee sits in a shallow geological trough that also underlies the Kissimmee River Valley and the Everglades. The trough is underlain by clay deposits that compacted more than the limestone and sand deposits did along both coasts of peninsular Florida. Until about 6,000 years ago, the trough was dry land. As the sea level rose, the water table in Florida also rose and rainfall increased. From 6,000 to 4,000 years ago, wetlands formed building up peat deposits. Eventually the water flow into the area created a lake, drowning the wetlands. Along what is now the southern edge of the lake, the wetlands built up the layers of peat rapidly enough (reaching thick) to form a dam, until the lake overflowed into the Everglades.Lodge:110 At its capacity, the lake holds of water and is the headwaters of the Everglades.South Florida Water Management District: Okeechobee Watershed Overview The floor of the lake is a limestone basin, with a maximum depth of . Its water is somewhat murky from runoff from surrounding farmlands. The Army Corps of Engineers targets keeping the surface of the lake between above sea level. The lake is enclosed by a high Herbert Hoover Dike built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers after a hurricane in 1928 breached the old dike, flooding surrounding communities and claiming at least 2,500 lives. Water flows into Lake Okeechobee from several sources, including the Kissimmee River, Fisheating Creek, Lake Istokpoga, Taylor Creek, and smaller sources such as Nubbin Slough and Nicodemus Slough.Lodge:105, 109Fisheating Creek Sub-Watershed Feasibility Study:11 The Kissimmee River is the largest source, providing more than 60% of the water flowing into Lake Okeechobee.Lodge:106Boning:212 Fisheating Creek is the second largest source for the lake, with about 9% of the total inflow. Prior to the 20th century, Lake Istokpoga was connected to the Kissimmee River by Istokpoga Creek, but during the rainy season Lake Istokpoga overflowed, with the water flowing in a 40 km wide sheet across the Indian Prairie into Lake Okeechobee.Lodge:107, 109 Today Lake Istokpoga drains into Lake Okeechobee through several canals that drain the Indian Prairie, and into the Kissimmee River through a canal that has replaced Istokpoga Creek.Lodge:109 Historically, outflow from the lake was by sheet flow over the Everglades, but most of the outflow has been diverted to dredged canals connecting to coastal rivers, such as the Miami Canal to the Miami River, the New River on the east, and the Caloosahatchee River (via the Caloosahatchee Canal and Lake Hicpochee) on the southwest. Uses=Congressionally authorized uses for Lake Okeechobee Pahokee According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Congressionally authorized uses for Lake Okeechobee include the following: * Flood and storm risk management * Navigation * Water supply for the following: **Salinity control in estuaries **Regional groundwater control **Agricultural irrigation **Municipalities and industry * Enhancement of fish and wildlife * Recreation Florida National Scenic Trail The wide dike surrounding Lake Okeechobee is the basis for the Lake Okeechobee Scenic Trail (LOST), a part of the Florida National Scenic Trail, a trail. There is a well-maintained paved pathway along the majority of the perimeter, although with significant breaks. It is used by hikers and bicyclists, and is wide enough to accommodate vehicles. Fishing The most common fish in this lake are largemouth bass, crappie, and bluegill. Pickerel have been less commonly caught.

Although all NCAA sports have at least one National Signing Day, and most have two, college football‚Äôs is by far the most widely followed by fans and sports media. Traditionally, college football's National Signing Day is the first Wednesday of February. As of 2017, college football also has an early signing period in late December, meaning recruits now have the opportunity to sign with their college team over a month before National Signing Day.https://www.sbnation.com/college-football- recruiting/2017/5/8/15585942/ncaa-early-signing-period-date-2017 While many recruits utilize this early process, a significant number of the nation‚Äôs top- rated recruits opt to wait until February to sign with their teams, either because they have not yet made a decision or desire to announce their decision to the fanfare and media coverage typically reserved for National Signing Day. History Until 1981, several college football conferences, including the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), held conference signing days on the second Saturday in December to have recruits sign conference letters-of-intent. The College Football Association, led by several prominent college head football coaches, proposed a resolution to eliminate conference signing days during their 1980 convention, and have a singular signing day in their places, called a National Signing Day. In 1981, the last year for conference signing days, recruits had to sign both conference and national letters-of-intent if their school was in the Big Eight or Southwest Conferences (four members of the latter conference later joined the former, which became known as the Big 12 Conference after the expansion). The conference letters-of-intent restricted a recruit to signing with only one school in a conference, but was unrestricted to signing with a school outside of the conference. The national letters-of-intent restricted a recruit to signing with only one school in the NCAA. The NCAA ruled in January 1981 to abolish early signing days and have a National Signing Day on the third Wednesday in February. National Signing Day has since typically been on the first Wednesday in February. In April 2017, the NCAA Division I Council voted to reinstate an early signing period in football, effective with the 2017‚Äì18 school year. The Collegiate Commissioners Association approved the new NCAA rule the following month, setting the early signing window for high schoolers as the first three days of the current early signing window for junior college players.

Conjugate elements are also called Galois conjugates or simply conjugates. Normally Œ± itself is included in the set of conjugates of Œ±. Example The cube roots of the number one are: : \\\\sqrt[3]{1} = \\\\begin{cases}1 [3pt] -\\\\frac{1}{2}+\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2}i [5pt] -\\\\frac{1}{2}-\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2}i \\\\end{cases} The latter two roots are conjugate elements in with minimal polynomial : \\\\left(x+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right)^2+\\\\frac{3}{4}=x^2+x+1. Properties If K is given inside an algebraically closed field C, then the conjugates can be taken inside C. If no such C is specified, one can take the conjugates in some relatively small field L. The smallest possible choice for L is to take a splitting field over K of pK,Œ±, containing Œ±. If L is any normal extension of K containing Œ±, then by definition it already contains such a splitting field. Given then a normal extension L of K, with automorphism group Aut(L/K) = G, and containing Œ±, any element g(Œ±) for g in G will be a conjugate of Œ±, since the automorphism g sends roots of p to roots of p. Conversely any conjugate Œ≤ of Œ± is of this form: in other words, G acts transitively on the conjugates. This follows as K(Œ±) is K-isomorphic to K(Œ≤) by irreducibility of the minimal polynomial, and any isomorphism of fields F and F that maps polynomial p to p can be extended to an isomorphism of the splitting fields of p over F and p over F, respectively. In summary, the conjugate elements of Œ± are found, in any normal extension L of K that contains K(Œ±), as the set of elements g(Œ±) for g in Aut(L/K). The number of repeats in that list of each element is the separable degree [L:K(Œ±)]sep. A theorem of Kronecker states that if Œ± is a nonzero algebraic integer such that Œ± and all of its conjugates in the complex numbers have absolute value at most 1, then Œ± is a root of unity. There are quantitative forms of this, stating more precisely bounds (depending on degree) on the largest absolute value of a conjugate that imply that an algebraic integer is a root of unity.

Three of the group's albums have entered the top 20 on the ARIA Albums Chart: A Man's Not a Camel (1999), Hi-Vis High Tea (2017) and Smoko at the Pet Food Factory (2011). Hi-Vis High Tea reached 9th position in the charts. The group has supported Australian tours by The Offspring, Bad Religion, NOFX, and Blink-182. Frenzal Rhomb have also toured in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, South Africa, Israel and Taiwan. The band has undergone several line-up changes, with lead vocalist Jason Whalley serving as the band's sole constant member. History=1992‚Äì1995: Formation to Coughing Up a Storm Frenzal Rhomb formed in 1992 in the Sydney suburb of Newtown with Alexis 'Lex' Feltham on bass guitar and Jason Whalley on vocals. Feltham and Whalley had been school mates at St Ives High School in St Ives. Whalley had commenced a Bachelor of Arts course in philosophy at Sydney University when he formed Frenzal Rhomb as a punk rock band. The band was formed to take part in a battle of the bands and at that stage was not seen as a permanent project. The name is a reference to a band member's pet rat, who in turn was named for the Fresnel rhomb, which is a prism-like device invented by the 19th Century French engineer, Augustin-Jean Fresnel. By 1993, the group's line-up was Feltham, Whalley, Ben Costello on guitar and Karl Perske on drums. They played at the Sydney venue for the Big Day Out in January. In March 1994, the band issued a seven-track EP, Dick Sandwich. Its cover had \\"a graphic drawing of the offending flaccid appendage draped over a sesame seed bun with lashings of bloody sauce.\\" Posters with a similar image that advertised the group had them banned at some venues. National youth radio station Triple J criticised the group as being immature and told them to \\"grow up\\". The EP was described as having \\"good songs but it sounds like it was recorded under a doona\\" and had the group banned from some radio stations and retail outlets. One of its tracks, \\"I Wish I Was as Credible as Roger Climpson\\" (aka \\"Roger\\"), attracted attention of its subject, Roger Climpson ‚Äì a Seven News anchor on TV ‚Äì who posed with the group for a photo. The E.P also features fan favourites \\"Chemotherapy\\", and a cover of the TV series theme \\"Home And Away\\". The E.P featured an alternate cover depicting rabbits on the flipside of the liftout to appease record stores or people who may have been offended by the original artwork. In October of that year, they released a single, \\"Sorry About the Ruse\\", on their own label, How Much Did I Fucking Pay For This Records? The group were the local support act on the Australian leg of separate tours by United States punk rockers Bad Religion, The Offspring, and Blink-182. In March 1995, Frenzal Rhomb released their first studio album, Coughing Up a Storm, on Shock Records' sub-label Shagpile Records. Perske was replaced by Nat Nykyruj on drums before the album appeared. The album features live fan favourite \\"Genius\\". In October 1997, it was retitled Once a Jolly Swagman Always a Jolly Swagman and issued with additional tracks by the US label Liberation Records. In mid-1995, the group supported NOFX on their national tour. Fat Mike, a member of NOFX, was also the owner of Fat Wreck Chords, and he signed the band to his label, which released the 4 Litres EP in the US. 1996‚Äì2000: Not So Tough Now to A Man's Not a Camel In July 1996, Frenzal Rhomb released their second album, Not So Tough Now, which was produced by Tony Cohen (Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, TISM, Dave Graney), Kalju Tonuma (Nick Barker, The Mavis's) and Frenzal Rhomb. Just after its appearance, Costello was replaced by Lindsay McDougall on lead guitar and backing vocals ‚Äì Costello left to attend university and become an animal rights activist. In November, the group issued a CD EP, Punch in the Face and, in January 1997, performed at Big Day Out. Late that year they toured the US supporting Blink-182. In September 1997, their third LP, Meet the Family, was released, which reached the top 40 on the ARIA Albums Chart and became their first certified gold album by ARIA. It spawned three singles, \\"Mr Charisma\\" (June), \\"There's Your Dad\\" (September), and \\"Mum Changed the Locks\\" (April 1998). The latter title refers to McDougall telling his mother he was going out to a movie when leaving for an interstate tour and returning to find his key no longer opened the front door. Also in April, Gordon \\"Gordy\\" Forman replaced Nykyruj on drums, and they toured Australia with US ska band Blue Meanies. Frenzal Rhomb were the head-liners for the Australian leg of the 1998 Vans Warped Tour and they were recruited for the US edition. A 1998 version of Meet the Family contained a bonus disc, Mongrel, that was recorded live on this US leg. In March 1999, they released their next album, A Man's Not a Camel, which was produced by Eddie Ashworth and was supported by a nationwide tour. As from November 2011, it remains Frenzal Rhomb's highest charting album, reaching No. 11. It spawned their highest charting single, \\"You Are Not My Friend\\" (August), which reached No. 49. Allmusic's album reviewer Mike DaRonco felt \\"the first two songs are great in that catchy, playful pop-punk sort of way, but the rest ... fall under the trap of having all their tracks sounding like one big, long song\\". The album also features fan favourites \\"We're Going Out Tonight\\" and \\"Never Had So Much Fun\\". According to the band's website, US gigs were dropped after Whalley suffered a heart attack in late 1999 and the group spent the first few months of 2000 inactive. Whalley later denied that he had had a heart attack with \\"a lot of things on our Web site are greatly exaggerated. There was also a thing about my having trench rot, the World War I disease, but that's not true either\\". 2000‚Äì2003: Shut Your Mouth to Sans Souci In November 2000, Frenzal Rhomb returned with the album Shut Your Mouth, released on Epic Records in Australia, an offshoot of Sony. RockZone's Samuel Barker liked some tracks as \\"a fine template for a pop punk album\\" however \\"the majority just falls into the same formula of most punk today. It's not bad, just overplayed\\". The album peaked in the top 40. After six months, Sony dropped the band in mid-2001 and they signed with Epitaph Records in Australia. In April 2002, Feltham left the group, which provided many stories about why he left, including one that he was fired after thinking that the group should incorporate synth and keyboard work. The last song he recorded with the band was a cover of Midnight Oil's \\"The Dead Heart\\" for the 2001 tribute album Power & The Passion: A Tribute to Midnight Oil. After holding auditions in Sydney, Tom Crease was announced as the new bass guitarist. In April 2003, the band released Sans Souci, which appeared in the top 50. Jo-Ann Greene of Allmusic liked the group's outlook: \\"they're not bitter, just snotty about it all, as all good punks should be. And Rhomb are four of the best ... their latest set of frenzied, funny, pitiless attacks upon an uncaring planet.\\" The initial version of the album included a bonus DVD of five tracks with live footage and music videos. 2004: Political protest, Jackie O During 2003, Frenzal Rhomb's McDougall organised Rock Against Howard, a compilation album, by various Australian musicians as a protest against incumbent Prime Minister John Howard's government. It was released in August 2004, before the October federal election, when Howard's coalition was re-elected. In July 2004, radio station 2Day FM presenter Jackie O was to MC at the Bassinthegrass festival in Darwin. Jackie allegedly arrived late, causing Frenzal Rhomb to cut their setlist short by several songs. She attempted to speak with the audience. In protest, McDougall began playing AC/DC's \\"Thunderstruck\\" over her voice. Jackie was upset that she was unable to finish her announcement to the audience. Whalley later accused her and other music industry personalities of pushing original Australian bands aside to make way for short-term marketable acts such as Australian Idol and Popstars contestants. Jackie and her co-presenter, Kyle Sandilands, called Whalley on air during their next breakfast show. Whalley apologised for offending Jackie, but stood by his claims regarding the music industry. The conversation became heated as Sandilands told Whalley \\"Your songs being played on this network or the Triple M network... it's just not going to happen now\\"; to which Whalley argued that Frenzal Rhomb were almost never played on the Austereo network anyway. During the conversation, Sandilands told Whalley that he was bitter and sad. When Whalley pointed out that Sandilands is in a position to promote new Australian music but doesn't, Sandilands countered that Frenzal Rhomb is not played on the network \\"because it's pretty much shit\\". While Sandilands agreed that shows like Popstars and Australian Idol are interested in making \\"a quick buck\\", he also asserted that he doesn't \\"care about Australian Idol or Popstars\\". Sandilands argued that Whalley should not \\"pick fights with people that are female in the Northern Territory\\". Sandilands asserted that if he himself were present, \\"it would have been on for young and old\\". Whalley argued that gender was irrelevant to the issue, and in response to Sandilands' threat of violence asked Jackie if she was aware that her security guard had threatened a band technician with violence. Sandilands said he endorsed the threat of violence. Sandilands argued to Whalley that he has to \\"get over it\\" when Whalley recommended that radio DJs should promote original Australian music. In reply, Sandilands insinuated that Frenzal Rhomb, and bands in general, suffer from a lack of support because they are not \\"putting [their] stuff in front of the right people\\". ABC Television's Media Watch covered the exchange and presenter David Marr raised concerns about the interview: \\"Kyle and Jackie O are also part of a new generation of radio thugs\\". Patrick Joyce, general manager of Austereo in Sydney, responded to Sandilands' threats of black listing and violence, \\"Music content is decided by the programming directors based on research of the market... Austereo does not approve of threats being made to anyone... We have fully canvassed these issues with Kyle\\". 2005‚Äì2009: Jay and the Doctor and Forever Malcolm Young Frenzal Rhomb's Whalley and McDougall worked as Jay and the Doctor on Triple J's breakfast show from January 2005 through to November 2007. Prior to their employment at Triple J, the group's music had been banned after they had earlier criticised the station on air for playing the \\"same 40 songs\\". In 2004, they were asked to perform occasional late night shifts and request segments, which developed into the breakfast show slot. Their format includes banter where they provide \\"quips, one-liners, slagging off each other, other bands, other breakfast announcers, listeners, Triple J, Australian Idol and St Ives. It's verbal ping pong but more discursive.\\" The band released Forever Malcolm Young in October 2006 ‚Äì the title is a conflated reference to the 2005 song \\"Forever Young\\" by Youth Group and the name of AC/DC's guitarist, Malcolm Young ‚Äì which peaked in the top 40. It provided a minor radio hit with the title track. Some controversy was expressed over the profanity in the title and lyrics of \\"Johnny Ramone was in a Fucking Good Band, but He Was a Cunt\\" (see Johnny Ramone, Ramones). Whalley's attitude to profanity and obscenity is \\"I often get amazed how offended people get by language, especially in Australia when its nothing you wouldn't hear in your local office or schoolyard. But we do make a point of shaking things up\\". Australian rock music journalist Ed Nimmervoll described them \\"[their] history is littered with legendary stories, perhaps true, perhaps exaggerations, but stories which fuel and match their song and album titles. Their songs are often profane, likely to poke fun at someone including themselves, hint at a social conscience, and inside all the tough talk and body jokes be hopelessly romantic.\\" National touring followed the album's release, along with the announcement that from November 2007 Whalley would be leaving both Frenzal Rhomb and his job at Triple J to go on a world trip with his girlfriend. Some later copies of Forever Malcolm Young contained a bonus DVD covering the band's tours from 2002 up until 2005. It is titled Sucking All Over the World. Gordy Forman plays in the Melbourne hardcore band Mindsnare. McDougall continued as The Doctor at Triple J, initially with Robbie Buck and Marieke Hardy; and, from January 2010, he has hosted the afternoon show Drive with The Doctor. By April 2009, Frenzal Rhomb were performing The Boys Are Back in Town tour with 1990s punk group Nancy Vandal as their support act. 2010‚Äì2017: Smoko at the Pet Food Factory and We Lived Like Kings... In December 2010, Frenzal Rhomb embarked on the No Sleep Til Festival which featured punk and metal bands: Megadeth, Descendents, NOFX, Gwar and Dropkick Murphys. Frenzal Rhomb played a new song entitled \\"Bird Attack\\". In Brisbane, on the last stop of the tour, Whalley and Crease joined Descendents on-stage with other bands' singers ‚Äì Al Barr (Dropkick Murphys), Fat Mike (NOFX), Matt Skiba and Derek Grant (Alkaline Trio), and Jason Allen (Descendents' road manager) ‚Äì to perform \\"Everything Sux\\". Frenzal Rhomb recorded their next album, Smoko at the Pet Food Factory in Colorado with Bill Stevenson (drummer for Descendents) producing. It was released on 19 August 2011 on Shock Records, which peaked at No. 14. The group toured Australia with Teenage Bottlerocket in September in support of the album. In June 2012, the album 'Not So Tough Now' was certified gold by the Australia Record Industry Association, 16 years after its release. Lead singer Jay Whalley announced on 26 February 2013 that the group was forced to cancel its recent tour after surgeons discovered and removed a pig tapeworm egg from his brain. Drummer Gordy Foreman broke his arm in multiple places after stage diving during a performance in Perth in 2015 and spent about 18 months recovering. The band continued to play live with Kye Smith (of Local Resident Failure) filling in on drums. Smith had previously paid tribute to Frenzal Rhomb as part of his \\"5 Minute Drum Chronology\\" series on YouTube. To celebrate the band's 25th anniversary Frenzal Rhomb toured Australia in 2016. Fans were offered the opportunity to select songs in the set list by voting for their favourite songs on the band's Facebook page. The band also released a best-of album, entitled We Lived Like Kings, We Did Anything We Wanted, on 19 August. 2017‚Äìpresent: Hi-Vis High Tea Frenzal Rhomb's ninth studio album, Hi-Vis High Tea, was released on 26 May 2017 on CD, LP (vinyl) and digital download. It was once again recorded in The Blasting Room by Bill Stevenson. The album's first single, \\"Cunt Act,\\" was released on the same day; as well as a national run of dates with Totally Unicorn. After 17 years, Tom Crease departed the band in mid-2019 due to ongoing hearing problems. He was replaced by Michael \\"Dal\\" Dallinger, formerly of Newcastle punk band Local Resident Failure ‚Äì coincidentally, a band named after a Frenzal Rhomb song. Controversy The group has generated controversy for profanity in cover art, song titles and lyrics; for the behaviour of members, on and off stage. In July 2004, radio 2Day FM hosts Jackie O and Kyle Sandilands (themselves no strangers to controversy) threatened the band with \\"black-listing\\" from the Austereo network after a festival performance in Darwin, Australia in a tit for tat. The band had played AC/DC's \\"Thunderstruck\\" over the top of Jackie O's effort to explain her late appearance to the audience as the delay caused a further cut into the band's set time.

Background = Expert systems One of the first examples of an expert system was MYCIN, an application to perform medical diagnosis. In the MYCIN example, the domain experts were medical doctors and the knowledge represented was their expertise in diagnosis. Expert systems were first developed in artificial intelligence laboratories as an attempt to understand complex human decision making. Based on positive results from these initial prototypes, the technology was adopted by the US business community (and later worldwide) in the 1980s. The Stanford heuristic programming projects led by Edward Feigenbaum was one of the leaders in defining and developing the first expert systems.  History  In the earliest days of expert systems there was little or no formal process for the creation of the software. Researchers just sat down with domain experts and started programming, often developing the required tools (e.g. inference engines) at the same time as the applications themselves. As expert systems moved from academic prototypes to deployed business systems it was realized that a methodology was required to bring predictability and control to the process of building the software. There were essentially two approaches that were attempted: # Use conventional software development methodologies # Develop special methodologies tuned to the requirements of building expert systems Many of the early expert systems were developed by large consulting and system integration firms such as Andersen Consulting. These firms already had well tested conventional waterfall methodologies (e.g. Method/1 for Andersen) that they trained all their staff in and that were virtually always used to develop software for their clients. One trend in early expert systems development was to simply apply these waterfall methods to expert systems development. Another issue with using conventional methods to develop expert systems was that due to the unprecedented nature of expert systems they were one of the first applications to adopt rapid application development methods that feature iteration and prototyping as well as or instead of detailed analysis and design. In the 1980s few conventional software methods supported this type of approach. The final issue with using conventional methods to develop expert systems was the need for knowledge acquisition. Knowledge acquisition refers to the process of gathering expert knowledge and capturing it in the form of rules and ontologies. Knowledge acquisition has special requirements beyond the conventional specification process used to capture most business requirements. These issues led to the second approach to knowledge engineering: development of custom methodologies specifically designed to build expert systems. One of the first and most popular of such methodologies custom designed for expert systems was the Knowledge Acquisition and Documentation Structuring (KADS) methodology developed in Europe. KADS had great success in Europe and was also used in the United States.

A domain name registrar must be accredited by a generic top- level domain (gTLD) registry or a country code top-level domain (ccTLD) registry. A registrar operates in accordance with the guidelines of the designated domain name registries. History Until 1999, Network Solutions Inc. (NSI) operated the registries for the com, net, and org top-level domains (TLDs). In addition to the function of domain name registry operator, it was also the sole registrar for these domains. However, several companies had developed independent registrar services. In 1996 one such company, Ivan Pope's company, NetNames, developed the concept of a standalone commercial domain name registration service which would sell domain registration and other associated services to the public, effectively establishing the retail arm of an industry with the registries being the wholesalers. NSI assimilated this model, which ultimately led to the separation of registry and registrar functions. In 1997, PGMedia filed an antitrust suit against NSI citing the DNS root zone as an essential facility, and the US National Science Foundation (NSF) was joined as a defendant in this action.Clausing, Jeri (19 September 1997) National Science Foundation Is Added to Suit on Domain Names. Partners.nytimes.com. Retrieved on 2013-02-08. Ultimately, NSI was granted immunity from antitrust litigation, but the litigation created enough pressure to restructure the domain name market. In October 1998, following pressure from the growing domain name registration business and other interested parties, NSI's agreement with the United States Department of Commerce was amended.Registrar Accreditation: History of the Shared Registry System. ICANN. Retrieved on 2013-02-08. This amendment required the creation of a shared registration system that supported multiple registrars. This system officially commenced service on November 30, 1999 under the supervision of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), although there had been several testbed registrars using the system since March 11, 1999. Since then, over 900 registrars have entered the market for domain name registration services. Of the registrars who initially entered the market, many have continued to grow and outpace rivals. GoDaddy is the largest registrar. Other widely used registrars include eNom, Tucows, Melbourne IT. Registrars who initially led the market but later were surpassed by rivals include Network Solutions and Dotster. Each ICANN-accredited registrar must pay a fixed fee of US$4,000 plus a variable fee. The sum of variable registrar fees is intended to total US$3.8 million. The competition created by the shared registration system enables end users to choose from many registrars offering a range of related services at varying prices. Designated registrar Domain registration information is maintained by the domain name registries, which contract with domain registrars to provide registration services to the public. An end user selects a registrar to provide the registration service, and that registrar becomes the designated registrar for the domain chosen by the user. Only the designated registrar may modify or delete information about domain names in a central registry database. It is not unusual for an end user to switch registrars, invoking a domain transfer process between the registrars involved, that is governed by specific domain name transfer policies. When a registrar registers a \`.com\` domain name for an end-user, it must pay a maximum annual fee of US$7.85Verisign Announces Increase in .com/.net Domain Name Fees (NASDAQ:VRSN) . Investor.verisign.com. Retrieved on 2013-02-08. to VeriSign, the registry operator for \`com\`, and a US$0.18 annual administration fee to ICANN. Most domain registrars price their services and products to address both the annual fees and the administration fees that must be paid to ICANN. Barriers to entry into the bulk registrar industry are high for new companies without an existing customer base. Many registrars also offer registration through reseller affiliates. An end-user registers either directly with a registrar, or indirectly through one or more layers of resellers. As of 2010, the retail cost generally ranges from a low of about $7.50 per year to about $35 per year for a simple domain registration, although registrars often drop the price far lower‚Äîsometimes even free‚Äîwhen ordered with other products such as web hosting services. The maximum period of registration for a domain name is 10 years. Some registrars offer longer periods of up to 100 years, but such offers involve the registrar renewing the registration for their customer; the 100-year registration would not be in the official registration database. DNS hosting Registration of a domain name establishes a set of name server records in the DNS servers of the parent domain, indicating the IP addresses of DNS servers that are authoritative for the domain. This provides a reference for direct queries of domain data. Registration of a domain does not automatically imply the provision of DNS services for the registered domain. Most registrars do offer DNS hosting as an optional free service for domains registered through them. If DNS services are not offered, or the end-user opts out, the end-user is responsible for procuring or self-hosting DNS services. Registrars require the specification of usually at least two name servers. DNSSEC support The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is a suite of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) specifications for securing certain kinds of information provided by the Domain Name System. This involves a registrar processing public key data and creating DS records for addition into the parent zone. All new GTLD registries and registrars must support DNSSEC. Domain name transfer A domain name transfer is the process of changing the designated registrar of a domain name. ICANN has defined a Policy on Transfer of Registrations between Registrars. The usual process of a domain name transfer is # The end user verifies that the whois admin contact info is correct, particularly the email address; obtains the authentication code (EPP or UDAI transfer code) from the old registrar, and removes any domain lock that has been placed on the registration. If the whois information had been out of date and is now updated, the end-user should wait 12‚Äì24 hours before proceeding further, to allow time for the updated data to propagate. # The end user contacts the new registrar with the wish to transfer the domain name to their service, and supplies the authentication code. # The gaining Registrar must obtain express authorization from either the Registered Name Holder or the Administrative Contact. A transfer may only proceed if confirmation of the transfer is received by the gaining Registrar from one of these contacts. The authorization must be made via a valid Standardized Form of Authorization, which may be sent e.g. by e-mail to the e-mail addresses listed in the WHOIS. The Registered Name Holder or the Administrative Contact must confirm the transfer. The new registrar starts electronically the transfer of the domain with the help of the authentication code (auth code). # The old registrar will contact the end user to confirm the authenticity of this request. The end user may have to take further action with the old registrar, such as returning to the online management tools, to re-iterate their desire to proceed, in order to expedite the transfer. # The old registrar will release authority to the new registrar. # The new registrar will notify the end user of transfer completion. The new registrar may have automatically copied over the domain server information, and everything on the website will continue to work as before. Otherwise, the domain server information will need to be updated with the new registrar. After this process, the new registrar is the domain name's designated registrar. The process may take about five days. In some cases, the old registrar may intentionally delay the transfer as long as allowable. After transfer, the domain cannot be transferred again for 60 days, except back to the previous registrar. It is unwise to attempt to transfer a domain immediately before it expires. In some cases, a transfer can take up to 14 days, meaning that the transfer may not complete before the registration expires. This could result in loss of the domain name registration and failure of the transfer. To avoid this, end users should either transfer well before the expiration date, or renew the registration before attempting the transfer.My domain expired! what do I do?. dyndns.com If a domain registration expires, irrespective of the reason, it can be difficult, expensive, or impossible for the original owner to get it back. After the expiration date, the domain status often passes through several management phases, often for a period of months; usually it does not simply become generally available.Life Cycle of a Typical gTLD Domain Name. ICANN. Retrieved on 2013-02-08. Transfer scams The introduction of a shared registry system opened up the previous domain registration monopoly to new entities known as registrars, which were qualified by ICANN to do business. Many registrars had to compete with each other, and although some companies offered value added services or used viral marketing, others, such as VeriSign and the Domain Registry of America attempted to trick customers to switch from their current registrar using a practice known as domain slamming. Many of these transfer scams involve a notice sent in the mail, fax, or e-mail. Some scammers contact end- users by telephone (because the contact information is available through WHOIS) to obtain more information. These notices would include information publicly available from the WHOIS database to add to the look of authenticity. The text would include legalese to confuse the end user into thinking that it is an official binding notice. Scam registrars go after domain names that are expiring soon or have recently expired. Domain name expiry dates are readily available via WHOIS. Drop catcher A drop catcher is a domain name registrar who offers the service of attempting to quickly register a given domain name for a customer if that name becomes available‚Äîthat is, to \\"catch\\" a \\"dropped\\" name‚Äîwhen the domain name's registration expires and is then deleted, either because the registrant abandons the domain or because the registrant did not renew the registration prior to deletion. Registrar rankings Several organizations post market-share-ranked lists of domain name registrars and numbers of domains registered at each. The published lists differ in which top-level domains (TLDs) they use; in the frequency of updates; and in whether their basic data is absolute numbers provided by registries, or daily changes derived from Zone files. The lists appear to all use at most 16 publicly available generic TLDs (gTLDs) that existed as of December 2009, plus .us. A February 2010 ICANN zone file access concept paper explains that most country code TLD (ccTLD) registries stopped providing zone files in 2003, citing abuse. Published rankings and reports include: * Monthly (but with approximately a three-month delay), ICANN posts registry reports created by the registries of all gTLDs. These reports list absolute numbers of domains registered with each ICANN-accredited registrar. * Yearly (but covering only the period from 2002 to 2007), DomainTools.com, operated by Name Intelligence, Inc., published registrar statistics.

It runs from I-680 and US 101 in San Jose to King and Fifth Streets in San Francisco, running just to the west of the larger cities of San Francisco Peninsula for most of its route. From I-880 in San Jose to State Route 1 in Daly City, I-280 was built and dedicated as the Junipero Serra Freeway, after the Spanish Franciscan friar who founded the first nine of 21 Spanish missions in California from San Diego to San Francisco. One of the dedication signs (in Daly City) still indicates that the Junipero Serra Freeway is known as the \\"World's Most Beautiful Freeway\\" due to its scenic route through the San Francisco Peninsula. From State Route 1 to the James Lick Freeway (U.S. 101) in San Francisco it is officially called the John F. Foran Freeway (after a former member of the California State Legislature). From the James Lick Freeway to its northern end at King Street and Fifth Street, I-280 is called the Southern-Embarcadero Freeway. I-280 is one of two 3-digit Interstate designations to appear on opposite coasts of the United States. I-110 in California and Florida is the only other designation. I-280 is shown prominently on the app icon for Apple's iOS built-in Apple Maps app (and formerly the Google Maps app as well). This is because the highway goes through Cupertino, the home of Apple's headquarters. Route description Interstate 280 near Stanford University Interstate 280 aerial view from southwest of the US 101/I-680 interchange The southern end of Interstate 280 is U.S. 101 in San Jose, where it acts as a continuation of Interstate 680 westward. In between San Jose and San Francisco, Interstate 280 passes through Santa Clara, Cupertino, Los Altos and Los Altos Hills before it settles along its scenic route just to the west of the cities of the San Francisco Peninsula in San Mateo County and just to the east of the Santa Cruz Mountains. I-280 re-emerges in a decidedly urbanized area in the city of San Bruno, passing through South San Francisco and Daly City before it runs across a southeastern swath of the city of San Francisco on the way to its northern terminus. The segment of the Junipero Serra Freeway between Cupertino (SR 85) and Daly City (SR 1) has been called the \\"World's Most Beautiful Freeway\\" since its dedication in the 1960s. Drivers along this portion of Interstate 280 are treated to scenic views of the Santa Cruz Mountains to the west and, at a few points, San Francisco Bay to the east, and are isolated by hills from the cities to the east. Through much of this segment, the freeway is actually running just inside the eastern rim of the rift valley of the San Andreas Fault. A particularly attractive 6-mile (10 km) stretch of the freeway from Hillsborough to Belmont provides a view at Crystal Springs Reservoir, formed by water piped over 160 miles (260 km) from Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite National Park, partly filling the rift valley. For nearly all of its length, Interstate 280 runs roughly parallel and several miles to the west of US 101 (the Bayshore Freeway). Both freeways are north‚Äìsouth routes connecting San Jose with San Francisco; however, unlike I-280, the route that U.S. 101 takes between the two cities goes entirely through urbanized areas. The vast majority of the population of the San Francisco Peninsula lives somewhere between Interstate 280 and U.S. 101\\\\. Interstate 280 does not currently intersect with Interstate 80, its 'parent' interstate, although it was originally intended to do so. The northern terminus of I-280 is now within about a mile of I-80's western terminus (at the interchange with US 101), but the two interstates do not directly connect; instead, I-280 complies with numbering conventions by virtue of its linkages to I-680 and I-880, both of which connect to I-80 at their northern termini. Although San Francisco planned and has had several opportunities to connect I-280 to I-80, it has chosen to use the money for other purposes. Instead, I-280's northernmost extension, which includes a significant double-deck section (with northbound traffic on the lower deck and southbound traffic on the upper), primarily functions now as a spur into Downtown San Francisco, as suggested by signage on northbound U.S. Route 101 at the Alemany Maze. A view of the scenic portion of Interstate 280 Major intersections include U.S. 101 and State Route 1 in San Francisco, Interstate 380 in San Bruno, State Route 92 in San Mateo, and I-880 and I-680 and U.S. 101 in San Jose. I-280 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. I-280 is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System, and from the San Mateo‚ÄìSanta Clara county line to the San Bruno city limits is officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation, meaning that it is a substantial section of highway passing through a \\"memorable landscape\\" with no \\"visual intrusions\\", where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community. The Junipero Serra Freeway is the name of Interstate 280 from SR 1 in San Francisco to SR 17, as named by Assembly Concurrent Resolution 140, Chapter 208 in 1967, in honor of Spanish missionary Jun√≠pero Serra, who founded many of California's missions in the 18th century. I-280 from its southern terminus at U.S. 101 and Interstate 680 north to Interstate 880 in San Jose is part of the Sinclair Freeway (named after Joseph P. Sinclair, District Engineer for District 4 California Division of Highways).Joseph Pierce Sinclair\\"Opening Ceremonies Pamphlet‚ÄîThe Sinclair Freeway-Interstate 280‚ÄîCalif Div. of Highways-District 4\\" A 26-foot (8 m) high faux-sandstone statue of Father Serra kneeling and pointing over the freeway is located at a highway rest area just north of the Highway 92 intersection between the Bunker Hill Drive and Black Mountain Road exits on northbound I-280 in Hillsborough, and can be clearly seen by drivers in both directions. History 1955 map of the planned Interstates in the San Francisco Bay Area. These early plans essentially called for an Interstate loop route that would head south down the San Francisco Peninsula from San Francisco to San Jose, then head north through the eastern cities of the East Bay to Vallejo. This route now basically comprises present-day I-280, I-680, and I-780. Interstate 280 was added to the Interstate Highway System on September 15, 1955 as a route from San Jose north to San Francisco. This ran along the present alignment of I-280 south of San Francisco, but in San Francisco it ran north parallel to State Route 1, past the planned west end of Interstate 80 which would have been at the junction with the Panhandle Freeway just south of Fulton and Park Presidio, along what would have been the Park Presidio Freeway north to the south approach to the Golden Gate Bridge. At that point, I-280 would have met Interstate 480, which would have headed east on Doyle Drive (U.S. Route 101), the Golden Gate Freeway, and onto the Embarcadero Freeway to reach the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge. I-480 would have continued south on the never- built section of the Southern-Embarcadero Freeway from Folsom and the Embarcadero to 5th and King Street, then along the present Southern- Embarcadero Freeway to meet the Southern Freeway (now I-280) near the Alemany Maze, which served as the 101A Bypass until I-280 was built. The I-280 number was approved on November 10, 1958. In the 1964 renumbering, the Route 280 designation was officially applied to the planned route. This replaced SR 1 in San Francisco; the new SR 1 alignment turned northeast where I-280 now runs, quickly ending at State Route 82 (San Jose Avenue/Alemany Boulevard). SR 1, however, continued to be signed along its former (and current) alignment, which had not been upgraded to freeway standards. A realignment approved January 1968 took I-280 onto its current route. This ran along what had been SR 1, SR 82, State Route 87 and I-480 (downgraded to a State Route then), ending at Interstate 80 at the west end of the Bay Bridge. This change was made on the state level in 1968, restoring SR 1 to its current alignment and truncating SR 82, SR 87 and SR 480. For the scenic portion, the section of I-280 between SR 85 (Cupertino) and SR 84 (Woodside) was completed in the late 1960s. The section between SR 92 (San Mateo) and SR 84 was not completed until the 1970s. Until then, traffic was routed on Ca√±ada Road between the two ends. Cars driving near Page Mill Road on I-280. The short piece of I-280 between 3rd Street and SR 480 in downtown San Francisco was never built, and the piece from 5th Street south to U.S. Route 101 originally terminated mid-air, to connect to the second proposed location of a parallel bay bridge (which was never built) but was reconfigured to the King St on/off ramps after it was damaged by the 1989 earthquake. The piece between SR 480 and I-80 was torn down along with the rest of the Embarcadero Freeway; ramp stubs which would have connected the freeways were removed as part of the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge Western Approach reconstruction project. The interchange at the beginning of I-280 at I-680 and U.S. Route 101 in San Jose was constructed years before its completion. The three flyovers, with no connecting ramps, stood as a 110-foot-tall (33.5 m) monument to inefficiency for years in the 1970s, becoming the butt of local jokes. The highlight prank occurred in January 1976, when a 1960 Chevrolet Impala was placed on the highest bridge overnight, where it obviously would be impossible to drive. The following day, San Jose City Councilman Joe Colla was photographed standing next to the car, an image that was circulated across many newspapers. It has been suggested this stunt nudged the State of California to find the funds to complete the freeway. The ramps opened five years later in 1981. In 2010, a resolution was introduced in the state legislature to name it the Joe Colla Interchange in memory of the late councilman.

Life North was the sixth son of Dudley North, 4th Baron North and his wife Anne Montagu and was the brother of Francis North and Dudley North. He was born in Tostock, Suffolk. He attended Bury St Edmunds Grammar School and then Thetford Grammar School from 1663, followed by Jesus College, Cambridge and the Middle Temple. He was called to the bar in 1674, and was Steward of the Diocese of Canterbury in 1678. He became King's Counsel and a Bencher of Middle Temple in 1682.Burke's Peerage 107th Edition 2003 Vol.2 p.1961 North later developed a good practice at the bar, helped by his elder brother Francis who became Lord Chancellor. Henry Hyde, 2nd Earl of Clarendon called him \\"one of only two honest lawyers I ever knew\\".The other being Sir Charles Porter, Lord Chancellor of Ireland. During the Popish Plot, while Francis succumbed to the prevailing anti-Catholic hysteria, Roger remained detached and sceptical. Although he was always loyal to his brother's memory, Roger admitted that during the Plot \\"wise men behaved like stark fools\\". In 1684 he became Solicitor-General to the Duke of York.Burke's Peerage p.1691 After this his career suffered something of a check: Francis' unexpected early death in September 1685 was both a personal loss and a blow to Roger's career, since Francis was replaced as Lord Chancellor by the formidable Lord Jeffreys. Roger, who left a scarifying picture of Jeffreys in his memoirs, was a rather shy and diffident man, and frankly admitted to being terrified of Jeffreys; as a result, in his own words, his practice \\"declined so as to be scarce worth attending Court\\".Milne- Tyte, Robert Bloody Jeffreys- the Hanging Judge Andr√© Deutsch London 1989 p.169 The check was only temporary: in 1685, he was chosen as a Tory Member of Parliament for Dunwich, and became Recorder of Bristol. He was further advanced in 1686 to the office of Attorney General to Queen Mary of Modena. The Glorious Revolution stopped his advancement, and he retired to his estate of Rougham in Suffolk and increased his fortune by marrying the daughter of Sir Robert Gayer.Burke's Peerage p.1961 North died at Rougham on 1 March 1734, leaving a family from whom the Norths of Rougham were descended. Works North collected books, and was constantly occupied in writing, but he is best known for his Lives of the Norths, published after his death, together with his own autobiography (edition in Bohn's Standard Library, 1890, by Augustus Jessopp), an authority for the period. His comments on musical performance practice, in particular, have proven helpful for musicologists researching the Baroque style in England. In addition to his writing on performance practice he wrote on musical aesthetics, on pedagogy, and on tuning and temperament; one of his most important achievements in this regard was devising a practical and detailed system for mean-tone tuning in the age before equal temperament. Another well-known work is Examen, a defence of Charles II's record as a ruler. He was also a learned connoisseur of architecture and designed a new gateway for the Middle Temple in London and a Palladian extension to his house at Rougham. Family North married Mary, the daughter of Sir Robert Gayer of Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire and his first wife Mary Rich, daughter of Sir Thomas Rich, 1st Baronet, with whom he had two sons and five daughters. Notable descendants include Marianne North, the botanical illustrator, and Frederick North, a Liberal politician.

He was Called to the Bar on 28 June 1661.Williamson, J.B. (1937). The Middle Temple Bench Book. 2nd edition, p.132. He was an eminent lawyer, Solicitor- General (1671), Attorney-General (1673), and Chief Justice of the Common Pleas (1675), and in 1679 was made a member of the Privy Council Ministry and, on its dissolution, of the Cabinet. He was a man of wide culture and a staunch royalist, although he opposed the absolutist tendencies of Sunderland and Jeffreys, his two bitterest political enemies. He was a strong supporter of the royal prerogative, remarking that he did not see how any good and honest lawyer could oppose it, as all the precedents were in its favour.Fraser, Antonia King Charles II Mandarin edition 1993 p. 421 Popish Plot and afterwards  Guilford sat as a judge at some of the Popish Plot trials, and like his colleagues he has been accused of excessive credulity in believing the lies of Titus Oates and the other informers. On the other hand, it has been argued that the senior Chief Justice, Sir William Scroggs, so dominated the proceedings that none of the other judges had any influence on the outcome. If North succumbed to the prevailing hysteria, so did many others: his brother Roger wrote that \\"it was a time when wise men behaved like stark fools\\". When public opinion finally began to turn against the Plot, the Crown moved against its instigators. North presided at the trial of one of the more disreputable of the Plot informers, Stephen College, nicknamed \\"the Protestant joiner\\", for high treason, in August 1681, and virtually ordered the jury to convict him. College was duly found guilty and hanged. North's conduct of the trial attracted a great deal of criticism, as the evidence of treason (College was accused of appearing in arms at the Oxford Parliament) was considered by many to be flimsy, and the charge had already been thrown out by a grand jury.Fraser p.421 Later years  Guilford was hostile to Lord Jeffreys, and regarded the future Lord Chief Justice, Sir Robert Wright, as utterly unfit for any judicial office; he was well qualified to assess Wright's ability since Wright as a young barrister had relied on North to write his legal opinions for him. He has been criticised for remaining in office after Wright was made Chief Justice over his vehement objections, especially as it must have been clear that he no longer had any influence over judicial appointments. On the other hand, he may have felt that keeping Jeffreys out of the Lord Chancellorship was a sufficient justification for clinging to office. Character  Guilford was generally respected for his integrity, (apart perhaps from his conduct of the trial of Stephen College), but he was sometimes accused of self-importance and a lack of any sense of humour; for example he showed excessive agitation at the ridiculous rumour spread by Sunderland and Jeffreys that he had been seen riding on a rhinoceros. Sunderland hated North with a passion, describing him as the most unfit man who ever held his office: \\"partial, unreasonable, corrupt, arbitrary and ignorant\\". There is no reason to believe any of these accusations: certainly no one, other than Sunderland, seems to have thought that Guilford was either corrupt or ignorant. Death  Guilford died, it seems rather unexpectedly, at his country house, Wroxton Abbey, near Banbury, on 5 September 1685, aged only 47. Although he had apparently been suffering from stress and overwork, the precise reasons for his early death are unclear. His rather cryptic last words were: \\"It will not do\\". Wroxton Abbey, North's country seat Family In 1672 he married Lady Frances Pope, daughter and co-heiress of Thomas Pope, 3rd Earl of Downe by his wife Beatrice (Beata) Poole, daughter of Henry Poole. Frances inherited the Wroxton estate. He was succeeded as 2nd baron by his only son Francis (1673‚Äì1729). Works Like many upper-class Englishmen of his time, North was devoted to music. Less typically for his time and class he had a keen interest in musical theory (as did his brother Roger), and published a book on the subject, A Philosophical essay on musick (1677), which has been praised as \\"an admirably clear exposition of the physical basis of music\\".Latham, Robert and Matthews, Charles ed. Diary of Samuel Pepys (1983) Vol. X Companion p.278 Francis North's musical notations have been described as the earliest known examples of synthetic phonograms.

Life He was the fourth son of Dudley North, 4th Baron North. In his early years he was carried off by Gypsies but was recovered by his family. He was the brother of Francis North, 1st Baron Guilford and Roger North. He engaged in foreign trade, especially with Turkey, and spent a number of years at Constantinople and Smyrna. Having returned to London with a fortune, he continued to trade with the Levant. His knowledge of commerce attracted the attention of the government, and he was further recommended by the influence of his brother Lord Guilford. During the Tory reaction under Charles II he was one of the sheriffs forced on the city of London in 1683 with an express view to securing verdicts for the crown in state trials. He was knighted in 1683, and was appointed a commissioner of customs, and later of the treasury, and then again of the customs. Having been elected a member of parliament in 1685 for Banbury under James II, he took, says Roger North, the place of manager for the crown in all matters of revenue. After the Glorious Revolution he was called to account for his alleged unconstitutional proceedings in his office of sheriff. He was buried in St Andrew's Church at Little Glemham in Suffolk. A memorial on the east wall of the chancel lies nearby. He had married Anne, the daughter of Sir Robert Cann, 1st Baronet of Compton Greenfield, Gloucestershire, and the widow of Sir Robert Gunning of Cold Ashton, Gloucestershire. They had one surviving son, Dudley who succeeded to Glemham. Dudley North memorial in St Andrew's Church, Little Glemham Works Some notices of the manners and customs of the east were printed from his papers by his brother. His tract entitled Discourses upon Trade, principally directed to the cases of the interest, coinage, clipping and increase of money, was published anonymously in 1691, and was edited in 1856 by J. R. McCulloch in the Select Collection of Early English Tracts on Commerce printed by the Political Economy Club of London. In this assertion of the free-trade doctrine against the system of prohibitions which had gained strength by the Revolution, North shows that wealth may exist independently of gold or silver, its source being human industry, applied either to the cultivation of the soil or to manufactures. It is a mistake to suppose that stagnation of trade arises from want of money; it must arise either from a glut of the home market, or from a disturbance of foreign commerce, or from diminished consumption caused by poverty. The export of money in the course of traffic, instead of diminishing, increases the national wealth, trade being only an exchange of superfluities. Nations are related to the world just in the same way as cities to the state or as families to the city. North emphasizes more than his predecessors the value of the home trade. With respect to the interest of capital, he maintains that it depends, like the price of any commodity, on the proportion of supply and demand, and that a low rate is a result of the relative increase of capital, and cannot be brought about by arbitrary regulations, as had been proposed by Sir Josiah Child and others. In arguing the question of free trade, he urges that every advantage given to one interest over another is injurious to the public. No trade is unprofitable to the public; if it were, it would be given up; when trades thrive, so does the public, of which they form a part. Prices must determine themselves, and cannot be fixed by law; and all forcible interference with them does harm instead of good. No people can become rich by state regulations, only by peace, industry, freedom and unimpeded economic activity. North was named by Wilhelm Roscher as one of the triumvirate of the 17th century English school of economists to the foremost place in Europe, the others being John Locke and William Petty.

Dry stone structures are stable because of their construction method, which is characterized by the presence of a load-bearing fa√ßade of carefully selected interlocking stones. Dry stone construction is best known in the context of stone walls, traditionally used for the boundaries of fields and churchyards, or as retaining walls for terracing, but dry stone sculptures, buildings, bridges, and other structures also exist. The art of dry stone walling was inscribed in 2018 on the UNESCO representative list of the intangible cultural heritage of humanity, for dry stone walls in countries such as France, Greece, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Switzerland and Spain.  History  The Lion Gate of the Mycenae acropolis, Greece, is dry stone. Some dry stone wall constructions in north-west Europe have been dated back to the Neolithic Age. Some Cornish hedges are believed by the Guild of Cornish Hedgers to date from 5000 BC, although there appears to be little dating evidence. In County Mayo, Ireland, an entire field system made from dry stone walls, since covered in peat, have been carbon-dated to 3800 BC. The cyclopean walls of the acropolis of Mycenae, Greece, have been dated to 1350 BC and those of Tiryns slightly earlier. In Belize, the Mayan ruins at Lubaantun illustrate use of dry stone construction in architecture of the 8th and 9th centuries AD. Great Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe, Africa, is a large city \\"acropolis\\" complex, constructed from the 11th to the 15th centuries AD.  Location and terminology  Dry stone walls in the Yorkshire Dales, England Terminology varies regionally. When used as field boundaries, dry stone structures are often known as dykes, particularly in Scotland, where professional dry stone wall builders are referred to as 'dykers'. Dry stone walls are characteristic of upland areas of Britain and Ireland where rock outcrops naturally or large stones exist in quantity in the soil. They are especially abundant in the West of Ireland, particularly Connemara. They may also be found throughout the Mediterranean, including retaining walls used for terracing. Such constructions are common where large stones are plentiful (for example, in The Burren) or conditions are too harsh for hedges capable of retaining livestock to be grown as reliable field boundaries. Many thousands of miles of such walls exist, most of them centuries old. In the United States they are common in areas with rocky soils, such as New England, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, and are a notable characteristic of the bluegrass region of central Kentucky as well as Virginia, where they are usually referred to as rock fences or stone fences, and the Napa Valley in north central California. The technique of construction was brought to America primarily by English and Scots-Irish immigrants. The technique was also taken to Australia (principally western Victoria and some parts of Tasmania and New South Wales) and New Zealand (especially Otago). Mosaic embedded in a dry stone wall in Italian Switzerland Similar walls also are found in the Swiss‚ÄìItalian border region, where they are often used to enclose the open space under large natural boulders or outcrops. The higher- lying rock-rich fields and pastures in Bohemia's south-western border range of ≈†umava (e.g. around the mountain river of Vydra) are often lined by dry stone walls built of field-stones removed from the arable or cultural land. They serve both as cattle/sheep fences and the lot's borders. Sometimes also the dry stone terracing is apparent, often combined with parts of stone masonry (house foundations and shed walls) that are held together by a clay and pine needle \\"composite\\" mortar. The dry stone walling tradition of Croatia was added to the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in November 2018, alongside those of Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Slovenia, Spain and Switzerland. In Croatia, dry stone walls () were built for a variety of reasons: to clear the earth of stone for crops; to delineate land ownership; or for shelter against the bora wind. Some walls date back to the Liburnian era. Notable examples include the island of Baljenac, which has of dry stone walls despite being only in area, and the vineyards of Primo≈°ten. In Peru in the 15th century AD, the Inca made use of otherwise unusable slopes by building dry stone walls to create terraces. They also employed this mode of construction for freestanding walls. Their ashlar type construction in Machu Picchu uses the classic Inca architectural style of polished dry stone walls of regular shape. The Incas were masters of this technique, in which blocks of stone are cut to fit together tightly without mortar. Many junctions are so perfect that not even a knife fits between the stones. The structures have persisted in the high earthquake region because of the flexibility of the walls, and because in their double wall architecture, the two portions of the walls incline into each other.  Construction  Using a batter-frame and guidelines to rebuild a dry stone wall in South Wales, UK Boundary wall of a pub featuring a dry stone sculpture, in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, UK A wall's style and method of construction will vary, depending on the type of stone available, its intended use and local tradition. Most older walls are constructed from stones and boulders cleared from the fields during preparation for agriculture (field stones) but many also from stone quarried nearby. For modern walls, quarried stone is almost always used. The type of wall built will depend on the nature of the stones available. Construction work on dry stone. Illustration of the Valencian Museum of Ethnology One type of wall is called a \\"double\\" wall and is constructed by placing two rows of stones along the boundary to be walled. The foundation stones are ideally set into the ground so as to rest firmly on the subsoil. The rows are composed of large flattish stones, diminishing in size as the wall rises. Smaller stones may be used as chocks in areas where the natural stone shape is more rounded. The walls are built up to the desired height layer-by-layer (course by course) and, at intervals, large tie-stones or through stones are placed which span both faces of the wall and sometimes project. These have the effect of bonding what would otherwise be two thin walls leaning against each other, greatly increasing the strength of the wall. Diminishing the width of the wall as it gets higher, as traditionally done in Britain, also strengthens the wall considerably. The voids between the facing stones are carefully packed with smaller stones (filling, hearting). The final layer on the top of the wall also consists of large stones, called capstones, coping stones or copes. As with the tie stones, the capstones span the entire width of the wall and prevent it breaking apart. In some areas, such as South Wales, there is a tradition of placing the coping stones on a final layer of flat stones slightly wider than the top of the wall proper (coverbands). In addition to gates a wall may contain smaller purposely built gaps for the passage or control of wildlife and livestock such as sheep. The smaller holes usually no more than 8 inches in height are called 'Bolt Holes' or 'Smoots'. Larger ones may be between eighteen and 24 inches in height, these are called a 'Cripple Hole'. The conical tower inside the Great Enclosure at Great Zimbabwe Boulder walls are a type of single wall in which the wall consists primarily of large boulders, around which smaller stones are placed. Single walls work best with large, flatter stones. Ideally, the largest stones are being placed at the bottom and the whole wall tapers toward the top. Sometimes a row of capstones completes the top of a wall, with the long rectangular side of each capstone perpendicular to the wall alignment. Galloway dyke on Fetlar, Shetland Islands, UK Galloway dykes consist of a base of double-wall construction or larger boulders with single-wall construction above. They appear to be rickety, with many holes, which deters livestock (and people) from attempting to cross them. These dykes are principally found in locations with exceptionally high winds, where a solid wall might be at risk of being unsettled by the buffeting. The porous nature of the wall significantly reduces wind force but takes greater skill to construct. They are also found in grazing areas where they are used to maximize the utility of the available stones (where ploughing was not turning up ever more stones). Another variation is the Cornish hedge or Welsh clawdd, which is a stone-clad earth bank topped by turf, scrub, or trees and characterised by a strict inward- curved batter (the slope of the \\"hedge\\"). As with many other varieties of wall, the height is the same as the width of the base, and the top is half the base width. Different regions have made minor modifications to the general method of construction‚Äîsometimes because of limitations of building material available, but also to create a look that is distinctive for that area. Whichever method is used to build a dry stone wall, considerable skill is required. Correcting any mistakes invariably means disassembling down to the level of the error. Selection of the correct stone for every position in the wall makes an enormous difference to the lifetime of the finished product, and a skilled waller will take time making the selection. As with many older crafts, skilled wallers, today, are few in number. With the advent of modern wire fencing, fields can be fenced with much less time and expense using wire than using stone walls; however, the initial expense of building dykes is offset by their sturdiness and consequent long, low-maintenance lifetimes. As a result of the increasing appreciation of the landscape and heritage value of dry stone walls, wallers remain in demand, as do the walls themselves. A nationally recognised certification scheme is operated in the UK by the Dry Stone Walling Association, with four grades from Initial to Master Craftsman. Notable examples include: * Mourne Wall: twenty-two mile long wall in the Mourne Mountains location in County Down, Northern Ireland * Ottenby nature reserve, built by Charles X Gustav in mid 17th century, √ñland, Sweden  Other uses  Intihuatana ritual buildings of dry stone at Machu Picchu, Peru While the dry stone technique is most commonly used for the construction of double- wall stone walls and single-wall retaining terracing, dry stone sculptures, buildings, fortifications, bridges, and other structures also exist. Traditional turf-roofed Highland blackhouses were constructed using the double-wall dry stone method. When buildings are constructed using this method, the middle of the wall is generally filled with earth or sand in order to eliminate draughts. During the Iron Age, and perhaps earlier, the technique also was used to build fortifications such as the walls of Eketorp Castle (√ñland, Sweden), Maiden Castle, North Yorkshire, Reeth, Dunlough Castle in southwest Ireland and the rampart of the Long Scar Dyke. Many of the dry-stone walls that exist today in Scotland can be dated to the 14th century or earlier when they were built to divide fields and retain livestock. Some extremely well built examples are found on the lands of Muchalls Castle. Dry stone walls can be built against embankments or even vertical terraces. If they are subjected to lateral earth pressure, they are retaining walls of the type gravity wall. The weight of the stones resists the pressure from the retained soil, including any surcharges, and the friction between the stones causes most of them to act as if being a monolithic gravity wall of the same weight. Dry stone retaining walls were once built in great numbers for agricultural terracing and also to carry paths, roads and railways. Although dry stone is seldom used for these purposes today, a great many are still in use and maintained. New ones are often built in gardens and nature conservation areas. Dry stone retaining structures continue to be a subject of research. Medieval dry stone bridge in Alby, Sweden Since at least the Middle Ages some bridges capable of carrying horse or carriage traffic have been constructed using drystone techniques. An example of a well-preserved bridge of this type is a double arched limestone bridge in Alby, Sweden, on the island of √ñland. In northeastern Somalia, on the coastal plain 20 km to Aluula's east are found ruins of an ancient monument in a platform style. The structure is formed by a rectangular dry stone wall that is low in height; the space in between is filled with rubble and manually covered with small stones. Relatively large standing stones are also positioned on the edifice's corners. Near the platform are graves, which are outlined in stones. 24 m by 17 m in dimension, the structure is the largest of a string of ancient platform and enclosed platform monuments exclusive to far northeastern Somalia. Burial sites near Burao in the northwestern part of the country likewise feature a number of old stelae. In Great Britain, Ireland and Switzerland, it is possible to find small dry stone structures built as signs, marking mountain paths or boundaries of owned land. In many countries, cairns, as they are called in Scotland, are used as road and mountain top markers.

They can be prohormones of testosterone or of synthetic AAS, for example, nandrolone (19-nortestosterone). Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S), and androstenedione may all be considered proandrogens of testosterone. Prohormones of testosterone and other AAS In the last two decades, prohormones have also been used by bodybuilders, athletes, and nonmedical users of AAS and other hormones to refer to substances that are expected to convert to active hormones in the body. The intent is to provide the benefits of taking an AAS without the legal risks, and to achieve the hoped-for benefits or advantages without use of AAS themselves. Many of these compounds are legal to manufacture, sell, possess and ingest eliminating the legal problems associated with schedule III AAS. The typical definition of \\"prohormone\\" includes a steroidal molecule that has the opposite molecular structure to testosterone on either the 3a/b position or the 17b position. Testosterone has a ketone group on the 3 carbon and a hydroxyl on the 17b carbon. A steroid with modifications away from testosterone in one or both of these areas is commonly referred to as a \\"prohormone\\". These enzymatic changes occur with the body's bidirectional enzymes.Lommer D, Dorfman RI, Forchelli E. Reversal of the 3 -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-isomerase reactions in rat adrenals. Steroidologia. 1970;1(3):175-82.WARD MG, ENGEL LL. REVERSAL OF THE 3-BETA-HYDROXYSTEROID DEHYDROGENASE-ISOMERASE REACTIONS.

On October 22, 2004, President Bush signed into law the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004 (118 Stat. 1661). The bill was written to become effective in 90 days, which was January 20, 2005. This legislation places both AAS and some androgen prohormones on a list of controlled substances (a new type of \\"regulatory control\\"). Statutory definition of AAS: \\"The term 'anabolic steroid' means any drug or hormonal substance, chemically and pharmacologically related to testosterone (other than estrogens, progestins, corticosteroids and dehydroepiandrosterone)\\". The Act also lists substances called prohormones, qualifying them as AAS, yet these substances were mainly included in the list due to the generalization of the definition of AAS which makes it currently impossible to synthesize any further substances linked with testosterone for the needs of athlete supplementation. Prohormones added to the list of schedule III AAS The 108th Congress amended the Controlled Substances Act to include AAS and to add in information about steroids and steroid precursors. This amendment is sometimes called the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004. The first thing this amendment did was insert a definition of AAS as follows: \\"The term 'anabolic steroid' means any drug or hormonal substance, chemically and pharmacologically related to testosterone (other than estrogens, progestins, corticosteroids and dehydroepiandrosterone).\\" Apart from the definition, the document enumerates the presently known prohormones: * Androstanediol (3Œ≤,17Œ≤-dihydroxy-5Œ±-androstane and 3Œ±,17Œ≤-dihydroxy-5Œ±-androstane) * Androstanedione (5Œ±-androstan-3,17-dione) * 1-Androstenediol (3Œ±,17Œ≤-dihydroxy-5Œ±-androst-1-ene) * 4-Androstenediol (3Œ≤,17Œ≤-dihydroxy- androst-4-ene) * 5-Androstenediol (3Œ≤,17Œ≤-dihydroxy-androst-5-ene) * 1-Androstenedione (5Œ±-androst-1-en-3,17-dione) * 4-Androstenedione (androst-4-en-3,17-dione) * 5-Androstenedione (androst-5-en-3,17-dione) * Norandrostenediol (19-nor-4-androstenediol or 3Œ≤,17Œ≤-dihydroxyestr-4-ene) * 19-Nor-4-androstenediol (3Œ±,17Œ≤-dihydroxyestr-4-ene) * 19-Nor-5-androstenediol (3Œ≤,17Œ≤-dihydroxyestr-5-ene and 3Œ±,17Œ≤-dihydroxyestr-5-ene) * Norandrostenedione (19-nor-4-androstenedione or estr-4-en-3,17-dione) * 19-Nor-5-androstenedione (estr-5-en-3,17-dione) * Any salt, ester, or ether of a drug or substance listed above Note that this list contains examples and it is not a closed list ‚Äì any other compound, which affects testosterone, according to the definition is an AAS under U.S. law. \\"Designer steroids\\" and adulterated supplements In view of a total ban from 2004, manufacturers cannot launch next AAS, presently they are interested in substances that are related to hormones, but do not affect testosterone. These include derivatives e.g. methoxydienone (methoxygonadiene; Ethyl Methoxy Gona), methasterone (so called Superdrol or S-Drol) and many others, sometimes called \\"designer steroids\\". Such compounds although harmful, do not infringe the Anabolic Steroid Control Act because they do not have any impact on the testosterone level. Owing to the same reason, they did not assist in building muscle and are not applicable in supporting ‚Äì it is typical that the descriptions of these compounds try to manipulate the chemical concepts, but do not even mention the possibility of raising testosterone ‚Äì because they do not even have such a potential. That is why, in practice, agents labeled with these compounds of this type turned out to be falsified, because they contained, not declared in the composition, typical AAS. After the publicity of the fraud in the mediaAmy Shipley \\"Steroids Detected In Dietary Tablets\\" \\"Washington Post\\" Staff Writer, November 30, 2005 many manufacturers lost the trust, and the U.S. health authorities began to eliminate suspicious products. The research carried out by state laboratories confirmed that \\"designer steroids\\" are, in fact, pharmaceuticals like metandienone, stanazolol, methylstenbolone, boldenone, chlorodehydromethyltestosterone, DHT, and oxandrolone, added to supplements in a random manner.Polish Anti-Doping Agency (WADA Partner ) Report 01-2009 Supplements with different names and described ingredients could have the same steroid (e.g., chlorodehydromethylandrostenediol (Halodrol), desoxymethyltestosterone (Madol, Pheraplex), others) and sometimes supplements with similar names could have different ingredients (e.g. Finabolic). Regulation in the United States and Europe Following the introduction of the Anabolic Steroid Control Act, labeling products derived from plant extracts with the help of chemical symbols of organic substances found in these plants or creating names for these substances which referred to prohibited AAS became a popular marketing practice employed by American manufacturers. No analogical act targeting athlete supplementation is in force in the European Union; however each country has its own regulations concerning substances with medicinal properties. Due to the above, one can come in contact with the sale of supplements with names identical to or resembling those questioned by the RDA in the United States (S-DROL, HALODROL, etc.). Laboratory controls indicate that products which declare to include prohormones, prohibited in the USA, in fact contain \\"classic\\" AAS of the previous generation.U.S. Food and Drug Administration fda.gov Many consumers in Europe did not know that it was illegal produce prohormones in the USA after the year 2004 and thought that were consuming various versions of the previously acclaimed supplement, while in fact consuming steroids of unknown origin. In situations like ones described above the purchaser of this fake substance knows neither the type nor the dosage of the ingested hormone, and thus cannot plan a safe gastro-protective regime or supplementary treatment. The consumer also cannot gain access to information concerning the possible long-term consequences of treatment with the unspecified hormone. This has led to the popularity of special forums on which consumers could share their experiences with the substances, yet the fake products could have radically different components, despite similar descriptions and names. Supplement manufacturers who have made a name for themselves and want to remain on the market are currently elaborating AAS based on natural substances (usually plant-derived). In Europe these products are called prohormones. Producers who still want to offer supplements supporting the hormonal balance can still employ the natural compounds. Known in the field of prohormones Patrick Arnold (the one who introduced 1-AD and the first prohormones) is currently working on ursolic acid, on the other hand in Eastern Europe manufacturers launch supplements based on buteins,S.Amboziak \\"Aromatase in the dock\\" 09.2012\\\\- natural compounds considered as the strongest aromatase inhibitors.Wang Y. \\"The plant polyphenol butein inhibits testosterone-induced proliferation in breast cancer cells expressing aromatase\\" Life Sci. 2005 May 20;77(1):39-51.

In physics * Since the early 1900s, physicists have postulated that the number could lie at the heart of a grand unified theory, relating theories of electromagnetism, quantum mechanics and, especially, gravity.Rutland, G., Awesome Sovereign (Bloomington: AuthorHouse, 2016), p. 33.Richard Feynman website, \\"The Mysterious 137\\". * The fine structure constant, a dimensionless physical constant, is approximately 1/137, and the astronomer Arthur Eddington conjectured in 1929 that its reciprocal was in fact precisely the integer 137, which he claimed could be \\"obtained by pure deduction\\".Eddington, A. S., The Constants of Nature in \\"The World of Mathematics\\", Vol. 2 (1956) Ed. Newman, J. R., Simon and Schuster, pp. 1074-1093. This conjecture was not widely adopted, and by the 1940s, the experimental values for the constant were clearly inconsistent with it (i.e. closer to 137.036).Helge Kragh, \\"Magic Number: A Partial History of the Fine- Structure Constant\\", Archive for History of Exact Sciences 57:5:395 (July, 2003) * Physicist Leon M. Lederman numbered his home near Fermilab 137 based on the significance of the number to those in his profession. Lederman expounded on the significance of the number in his book The God Particle: If the Universe Is the Answer, What Is the Question?, noting that not only was it the inverse of the fine-structure constant, but was also related to the probability that an electron will emit or absorb a photon‚Äîi.e., Feynman's conjecture. He added that it also \\"contains the crux of electromagnetism (the electron), relativity (the velocity of light), and quantum theory (Planck's constant). It would be less unsettling if the relationship between all these important concepts turned out to be one or three or maybe a multiple of pi. But 137?\\" The number 137, according to Lederman, \\"shows up naked all over the place\\", meaning that scientists on any planet in the universe using whatever units they have for charge or speed, and whatever their version of Planck's constant may be, will all come up with 137, because it is a pure number. Lederman recalled that Richard Feynman had even suggested that all physicists put a sign in their offices with the number 137 to remind them of just how much they do not know.Lederman, L. M., The God Particle: If the Universe is the Answer, What is the Question?

Since the Bohr model does not include either quantum mechanics or special relativity, the fact that it breaks down in this regime is not unexpected. However, such large atoms (if their nuclei were stable) could be expected to behave rather differently from a naive extrapolation of trends in the periodic table. For a finite nuclear volume, the limit is raised to about Z = 172. * Wolfgang Pauli, a pioneer of quantum physics, died in a hospital room numbered 137, a coincidence that disturbed him.Gratzer, W., The Pauli Principle in \\"Eurekas and Euphorias\\", (2002) Oxford University Press, pp. 49‚Äì52. In esoterism * The fine structure constant of physics continues to convince esotericists that the universe has numerological fine tuning:The mystery of 137, www.integralworld.net. for example the age of the universe could be considered as roughly 13.7 times 1 billion years, though newer estimates put this value at 13.8. * The Hebrew word (Kabbalah) has a Gematria (numerical value) of 137. In Modern Hebrew, the root of Kabbalah can mean either \\"receiving\\" or \\"parallel\\". Kabbalah is generally taken to mean \\"the received tradition\\", which conveys the continuity of a tradition that has been passed down from generation to generation. Nevertheless, the earlier nuance of meaning is seen in the first appearances of its root in the Torah (Exodus 26:5 and 36:12), where it means \\"parallel\\" or \\"corresponding\\" rather than \\"receiving\\". It is used to describe the \\"corresponding loops\\", which, when clasped together, enjoined the two sections of the Tabernacle's ceiling. These loops were suspended directly over the veil that divided the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. Symbolically, this is the threshold between the physical dimension and the utterly spiritual dimension. In other words, at the boundary line of the physical world, the number 137 emerges. The wisdom of Kabbalah is to find correspondences between the mundane and spiritual levels of reality.

Biography Miniature of Sparrman at the time of his travels with James Cook. By unknown artist. Sparrman was the son of a clergyman. At the age of nine he enrolled at Uppsala University, beginning medical studies at fourteen and becoming one of the outstanding pupils of Linnaeus. In 1765 he went on a voyage to China as ship's doctor, returning two years later and describing the animals and plants he had encountered. On this voyage he met Carl Gustaf Ekeberg. He sailed for the Cape of Good Hope in January 1772 to take up a post as a tutor. When James Cook arrived there later in the year at the start of his second voyage, Sparrman was taken on as assistant naturalist to Johann and Georg Forster. After the voyage he returned to Cape Town in July 1775 and practiced medicine, earning enough to finance a journey into the interior. He was guided by Daniel Ferdinand Immelman, the young frontiersman who had previously guided the Swedish botanist Carl Peter Thunberg. Daniel and Sparrman reached the Great Fish River and returned in April 1776.Anders Sparrman, A Voyage to the Cape of Good Hope, towards the Antarctic Polar Circle, round the world and to the Country of the Hottentots and the Caffres, from the Year 1772‚Äì1776, ed. V. S. Forbes (2 vols.; Cape Town: Van Riebeeck Society, 1975). In 1776 Sparrman returned to Sweden, where he had been awarded an honorary doctorate in his absence. He was also elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1777. He was appointed keeper of the natural historical collections of the Academy of Sciences in 1780, Professor of natural history and pharmacology in 1781 and assessor of the Collegium Medicum in 1790. In 1787 he took part in an expedition to West Africa, but this was not successful. Sparrman published several works, the best known of which is his account of his travels in South Africa and with Cook, published in English as A voyage to the Cape of Good Hope, towards the Antarctic polar circle, and round the world: But chiefly into the country of the Hottentots and Caffres, from the year 1772 to 1776 (1789). He also published a Catalogue of the Museum Carlsonianum (1786‚Äì89), in which he described many of the specimens he had collected in South Africa and the South Pacific, some of which were new to science. He published an Ornithology of Sweden in 1806. The asteroid 16646 Sparrman bears his name. The Swedish novelist Per W√§stberg has written a biographical novel about Sparrman which was published in English in 2010, under the title as The Journey of Anders Sparrman.

He served as High Sheriff of Essex in 1689. Career with the East India Company Child's advocacy, both by speech and by pen (under the pseudonym Philopatris), of the East India Company's claims to political power, as well as to its right of restricting competition to its trade, brought him to the notice of the shareholders. He was appointed a Director in 1677, rising to Deputy-Governor and finally became Governor of the East India Company in 1681.K. N. Chaudhuri, The Trading World of Asia and the English East India Company 1660-1760, 1978, p.116 In this latter capacity, he directed the Company's policy as if it were his own private business.

War with the Mughal Empire Child lost the war with Aurangzeb, 6th Mughal Emperor, which took place between 1688 and 1690. Aurangzeb, however, did not take any punitive action against the company and restored its trading privileges. \\"For a massive indemnity and promises of better conduct in the future, he Aurangzeb graciously agreed to the restoration of their East India Company's trading privileges and the withdrawal of his troops\\".Keay, John.

Child contributed to the literature of economics, especially Brief Observations concerning Trade and the Interest of Money (1668),Brief Observations concerning Trade and A New Discourse of Trade (1668 and 1690). A new discourse of Trade & the Interest of Money He was a moderate in the days of the mercantile system and has sometimes been regarded as a sort of pioneer in developing the free-trade doctrines of the 18th century. Though Child considered himself a proponent of the competitive market, he simultaneously argued for a government-controlled interest rate and restricted trade among the colonies, benefiting England. He made various proposals for improving English trade by following the Dutch example. He advocated a low rate of interest as the causa causans of all the other causes of the riches of the Dutch people. This low rate of interest he thought should be created and maintained by public authority. Child, whilst adhering to the doctrine of the balance of trade, observed that a people cannot always sell to foreigners without ever buying from them, and denied that the export of the precious metals was necessarily detrimental. Like other writers in what is commonly called the mercantilist period or tradition, he viewed a numerous population as an asset to a country. He became prominent with a new scheme for the relief and employment of the poor. He also advocated the reservation by the mother country of the sole right of trade with her colonies. In Sir Josiah Child, Merchant Economist (1959), William Letwin considers that Child's economic thought was of little theoretical importance but notes that he was \\"the most widely-read of seventeenth-century economic writers\\".William Letwin, Sir Josiah Child, Merchant Economist (Cambridge, Mass., 1959), p. 26 Family Child married firstly, Hannah Boate, daughter of Edward Boate, on 26 December 1654 at Portsmouth, Hampshire. He had one surviving child, Elizabeth. Two other children died young. Elizabeth married John Howland of Streatham, and their daughter Elizabeth married the Duke of Bedford. Child married secondly, c. 14 June 1663, Mary Atwood, daughter of William Atwood. The issues from this marriage are Rebecca (c. 1666 ‚Äì 17 Jul 1712) who married firstly Charles Somerset, Marquess of Worcester and secondly John, Lord Granville); Mary who married Edward Bullock of Faulkbourne and died c. 1748;Bullock, Llewellyn C W, Memoirs of the Bullock Family, A J Lawrence 1905 and his heir Josiah Child, 2nd Baronet (c.1668-20 Jan 1704). Child married thirdly, c. 8 August 1676, Emma Willughby, widow of Francis Willughby and daughter of Sir Henry Barnard. They had one child, a son, Richard Child (5 Feb 1680 ‚Äì March 1750), who was created Viscount Castlemaine in 1718 and Earl Tylney in 1731. Child died on 22 June 1699 and was buried at Wanstead, Essex.

The two men guided the affairs of the company through the period of struggle between the Mughals and Marathas. They have been credited by history with the change from unarmed to armed trade on the part of the company; however, both were actually loath to quarrel with the Mughal Empire. War broke out with Aurangzeb in 1689, but in the following year Child had to sue for peace, one of the conditions being that he should be expelled from India. He escaped this expulsion by his death on 4 February 1690, and was as English president of Surat and Bombay succeeded by Bartholomew Harris.

Personal history Adanson was born at Aix-en-Provence. His family moved to Paris in 1730. After leaving the Coll√®ge Sainte-Barbe he was employed in the cabinets of R. A. F. R√©aumur and Bernard de Jussieu, as well as in the Jardin des Plantes, Paris. He attended lectures at the Jardin du Roi and the Coll√®ge Royal in Paris from 1741 to 1746. At the end of 1748, funded by a director of the Compagnie des Indes, he left France on an exploring expedition to Senegal. He remained there for five years, collecting and describing numerous animals and plants. He also collected specimens of every object of commerce, delineated maps of the country, made systematic meteorological and astronomical observations, and prepared grammars and dictionaries of the languages spoken on the banks of the S√©n√©gal. After his return to Paris in 1754 he made use of a small portion of the materials he had collected in his Histoire naturelle du Senegal (1757). Sales of the work were slow, and after the publisher's bankruptcy and the reimbursement to subscribers, Adanson estimated the cost of the book to him had been 5,000 livres, beginning the penury in which he lived the rest of his life.Adanson, Michel Adanson : the Bicentennial of Michel Adanson's Familles des Plantes. Part one. The Hunt botanical library Carnegie Institute of Technology. Pittsburgh, 1963:49. This work has a special interest from the essay on shells, printed at the end of it, where Adanson proposed his universal method, a system of classification distinct from those of Buffon and Linnaeus. He founded his classification of all organised beings on the consideration of each individual organ. As each organ gave birth to new relations, so he established a corresponding number of arbitrary arrangements. Those beings possessing the greatest number of similar organs were referred to one great division, and the relationship was considered more remote in proportion to the dissimilarity of organs. Familles naturelles des plantes In 1763 he published his Familles naturelles des plantes. In this work he developed the principle of arrangement above mentioned, which, in its adherence to natural botanical relations, was based on the system of Joseph Pitton de Tournefort, and had been anticipated to some extent nearly a century before by John Ray. The success of this work was hindered by its innovations in the use of terms, which were ridiculed by the defenders of the popular sexual system of Linnaeus; but it did much to open the way for the establishment, by means principally of Antoine Laurent de Jussieu's Genera Plantarum (1789), of the natural method of the classification of plants. In 1774 Adanson submitted to the consideration of the French Academy of Sciences an immense work, extending to all known beings and substances. It consisted of 27 large volumes of manuscript, employed in displaying the general relations of all these matters, and their distribution; 150 volumes more, occupied with the alphabetical arrangement of 40,000 species; a vocabulary, containing 200,000 words, with their explanations; and a number of detached memoirs, 40,000 figures and 30,000 specimens of the three kingdoms of nature. The committee to which the inspection of this enormous mass was entrusted strongly recommended Adanson to separate and publish all that was peculiarly his own, leaving out what was merely compilation. He obstinately rejected this advice; and the huge work, at which he continued to labour, was never published. Evolution Adanson was an early proponent of the inheritance of acquired characters and a limited view of evolution.Zirkle, Conway. (1935). The Inheritance of Acquired Characters and the Provisional Hypothesis of Pangenesis. The American Naturalist 69: 417‚Äì445.Cornell, John F. (1983). From Creation to Evolution: Sir William Dawson and the Idea of Design in the Nineteenth Century. Journal of the History of Biology 16: 137‚Äì170. Historian of science Conway Zirkle has noted that \\"Adanson was Lamarck's predecessor at the Jardin Royal, and Lamarck could hardly have remained unfamiliar with Adanson 's publications. Adanson not only described evolution in his \\"Familles de plantes,\\" published in 1763 when Lamarck was a young man of twenty, but also suggested that the changes in specific characteristics were produced through the inheritance of acquired characters.\\" In an article for the Histoire and Memoires de l'Academie Royale des Sciences of 1769, Adanson used the term \\"mutations\\" to refer to small changes that could bring about new variations in individuals.Adanson: Adanson, the man, by J. P. Nicolas. Adanson and his Familles des plantes, by F. A. Stafleu. The Adanson collection of botanical books and manuscripts, by W. D. Margadant. Hunt Botanical Library, Carnegie Institute of Technology, 1963. p. 168 Despite being described as a \\"precursor of evolutionism\\" by historians, Adanson rejected the concept of species, preferring to focus on individuals and denied the transmutation of species.Mayr, Ernst.

History of Paradise: The Garden of Eden in Myth and Tradition. University of Illinois Press. p. 222. Adanson made a serious attempt to classify fungi based on their fruit body complexity. He was the first botanist to classify lichens with fungi. Later life He had been elected a member of the Academy of Sciences in 1759, and he latterly subsisted on a small pension it had conferred on him. Of this he was deprived in the dissolution of the Academy by the Constituent Assembly in 1793, and was consequently reduced to such a depth of poverty as to be unable to appear before the French Institute when it invited him to take his place among its members. (It is said that he possessed neither a white shirt, a coat nor a whole pair of breeches.) Afterwards he was granted a pension sufficient to relieve his simple wants. Death and legacy He died at Paris after months of severe suffering, requesting, as the only decoration of his grave, a garland of flowers gathered from the fifty-eight families he had differentiated ‚Äì \\"a touching though transitory image,\\" says Georges Cuvier, \\"of the more durable monument which he has erected to himself in his works.\\" Besides the books already mentioned he published papers on the ship-worm, the baobab tree (whose generic name Adansonia commemorates Adanson), the origin of the varieties of cultivated plants, and gum-producing trees. His papers and herbarium remained in his family's hands for over a century and a half, finally coming to the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, in 1961‚Äì62.Adanson papers Subsequently, the Hunt Institute republished his Familles des plantes in two volumes (1963‚Äì64), under the editorship of G. H. M. Lawrence. A species of turtle, Pelusios adansonii, is named in his honor.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles.

It is named after the city of Sisak and the region Moslavina just across the river Sava. According to 2011 census it is inhabited by 172,000 people. This county contains the ancient Roman city of Siscia‚Äîtoday's Sisak. Siscia was the largest city of the region back then, a Pannonian capital, likely due to its position on the confluence of the Kupa and Sava rivers. The city's patron saint is its first Christian bishop, St. Kvirin, who was tortured and almost killed during Diocletian's persecution of Christians. Legend has it that they tied him to a millstone and threw him into a river, but he freed himself from the weight, escaped and continued to preach his faith. The town may have lost importance with the fall of one empire, but it recovered it soon enough with the rise of another: Sisak became famous for crucial battles between European armies and the Ottoman Turks. In particular, the battle of 1593 when the Ottoman army first suffered a large defeat. The ban Toma Bakaƒç Erdedi who led the defense in this battle became famous throughout Europe. Today, Sisak features the largest Croatian metallurgic factory (supported by the University of Zagreb's Faculty of Metallurgy also in the city) and the largest oil refinery. These are coupled with the petrochemical facilities in the nearby town of Kutina, the first recorded mention of which was in 1256 by king B√©la IV. Moslavina is probably the most picturesque part of this county, with the natural park Lonjsko polje near the rivers Lonja, Ilova and Pakra. This county also extends far to the south, bordering Bosnia.

Its hyphenated name comes from two entities: the two of its largest cities, Koprivnica and Kri≈æevci. Koprivnica is the official capital of the county. It was first mentioned in 1272 in a document by prince Ladislaus IV of Hungary and was declared a free royal town by king Ludovic I in 1356. It has flourished as a trading place and a military fortress since that time. The military aspect set it back when it was included in the Military Frontier in the 16th century during the wars with the Ottoman Turks. After Maria Theresa's decree of 1765, however, it resumed life as a peaceful little merchant town. Koprivnica developed significantly in the 20th century with the advent of the Podravka food industry, and is known worldwide for its Vegeta spice. Kri≈æevci, on the other hand, as a smaller city and second mentioned in the county name, may seem like an underdog to its neighbour Koprivnica. Its first mention was from 1193 by B√©la III but it was divided into two parts which developed at different rates. After centuries of division, empress Maria Theresa united the Lower and Upper Kri≈æevac into Kri≈æevci in 1752. The town was also hit by the wars with the Turks, but it regained importance in 1871 when the railway was built through it on the way from Budapest to Rijeka. The modern Kri≈æevci is oriented towards entrepreneurship, while preserving its eight beautiful churches (one is a cathedral), built mostly in the Middle Ages. The county also includes a third town, ƒêurƒëevac, but its population is much smaller than the main two (8,862 in 2001).

He served as a Teachta D√°la (TD) for Cork South-West constituency from 1977 to 1981 and 1982 to 2007. He was a Senator elected by the Cultural and Educational Panel from 1981 to 1982. Early life Walsh was born in May 1943 in Ballineen, County Cork. He was educated at St Finbarr's College, Cork and University College Cork, where he qualified with a degree in Dairy Science in 1970. During his time in university he became involved in politics, establishing the first Fianna F√°il cumann in the university. Walsh began his career as a researcher in the National Dairy Research Centre at Moorepark, near Fermoy, before becoming Managing Director of Strand Dairies in Clonakilty, County Cork. Political career He began his political career when he was elected a member of Cork County Council in 1974, remaining on the council until the 1991 local elections. He was elected to D√°il √âireann on his first, attempt when he was returned as a Fianna F√°il TD for Cork South-West at the 1977 general election. Walsh lost his seat at the 1981 general election, but secured election by the Cultural and Educational Panel to Seanad √âireann. He was re-elected to the D√°il at the February 1982 general election and retained his seat at every subsequent election until his retirement in 2007. In the 1980s, Walsh was one of the Gang of 22 who opposed Charles Haughey's leadership of Fianna F√°il. In spite of this, he was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food when Haughey returned as Taoiseach after the 1987 general election. In 1989, he was a key figure in the negotiations which led to the formation of the historic Fianna F√°il- Progressive Democrats coalition government. He remained as Minister of State until 1992 when Albert Reynolds became Taoiseach. Walsh was appointed to the Cabinet as Minister for Agriculture and Food in February of the same year. He remained in that position until December 1994. In 1997 Fianna F√°il returned to power and Walsh was again appointed Minister for Agriculture and Food in Bertie Ahern's government. When Ireland was confronted with a foot-and-mouth disease crisis in 2001, Walsh introduced control measures to prevent a full- scale outbreak, such as curtailing the movement of animals with football games and the postponement of sporting events including 2001 Six Nations Championship. He received several awards, including the L√©gion d'honneur and the Grand Cross of the Agricultural Order of Merit of Spain. On 13 August 2004, he announced that he would retire from the Cabinet after spending 14 years of his career at the Department of Agriculture. He sat on the board of Bank of Ireland, and received an annual Oireachtas pension payments of ‚Ç¨119,177. Death Walsh died at Cork University Hospital on 9 November 2014, after a \\"short illness\\".

Transactions of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological Society, Vol.15, 1890-91 , pp.89‚Äì102 The title Baron Berkeley originated as a feudal title and was subsequently created twice in the Peerage of England by writ. It was first granted by writ to Thomas de Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley (1245‚Äì1321), 6th feudal Baron Berkeley, in 1295, but the title of that creation became extinct at the death of his great-great- grandson, the fifth Baron by writ, when no male heirs to the barony by writ remained, although the feudal barony continued. The next creation by writ was in 1421, for the last baron's nephew and heir James Berkeley. His son and successor William was created Viscount Berkeley in 1481, Earl of Nottingham in 1483, and Marquess of Berkeley in 1488. He had no surviving male issue, so the Marquessate and his other non-inherited titles became extinct on his death in 1491, whilst the barony passed de jure to his younger brother Maurice. However William had disinherited Maurice because he considered him to have brought shame on the noble House of Berkeley by marrying beneath his status to Isabel, daughter of Philip Mead of Wraxhall, an Alderman and Mayor of Bristol. Instead he bequeathed the castle, lands and lordships comprising the Barony of Berkeley to King Henry VII and his heirs male, failing which to descend to William's own rightful heirs. Thus on the death of King Edward VI in 1553, Henry VII's unmarried grandson, the Berkeley inheritance returned to the family. Therefore, Maurice and his descendants from 1492 to 1553 were de jure barons only, until the return of the title to the senior heir Henry (and indirectly to his mother Anne), becoming de facto 7th Baron in 1553.Debrett's Peerage 1968, p.139, Berkeley, Baroness, Predecessors Upon his death he was succeeded by his relative George Harding. His son, the ninth Baron, was created Earl of Berkeley and Viscount Dursley, which remained united to the barony until the death of the sixth Earl in 1882, when the earldom passed to a male heir and the barony passed to a female one, Louisa Milman. At Louisa's death, the barony went to Eva Mary Foley, upon whose death the barony fell into abeyance. The abeyance was terminated a few years later in favour of Mary Lalle Foley-Berkeley. Upon her death, the barony went to her nephew Anthony Gueterbock, who is the present holder. In 2000, he was created Baron Gueterbock for life in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The epithets of each baron were coined by John Smith of Nibley (d.1641), steward of the Berkeley estates, the biographer of the family and author of \\"Lives of the Berkeleys\\". Feudal Barons of Berkeley The feudal barony of Berkeley was created circa 1155, when King Henry II granted the royal castle of Berkeley to the Anglo- Saxon royal financier Robert Fitzharding under the feudal land tenure . Prior to that time Berkeley Castle had been held in fee-farm by Roger I \\"de Berkeley\\" (d.1093),Cokayne, The Complete Peerage, new edition, II, p.124 a Norman nobleman, possibly a son of Roger I of Tosny (died circa 1040),Platts, Beryl. Scottish Hazard. (Investigation into the origins of the Scottish branch of the Berkeley family) who acquired the surname \\"de Berkeley\\". Roger I \\"de Berkeley\\" held extensive lands in-chief of the king in 1086, as recorded by Domesday Book, including Dursley and retired as a monk to St Peter's Abbey, Gloucester in about 1091. His son Roger II (d. about 1131) and grandson Roger III (d. after 1177) also held the manor of Dursley in-chief of the king. In 1152 Roger III was deprived of the farm of Berkeley during the civil war between King Stephen and the Empress Maud. He was later restored to Dursley, and founded the family of \\"Berkeley of Dursley\\",Sanders, English Baronies, pp.114-5, Probable Baronies, Dursley but Berkeley Castle was granted by barony to Robert FitzHarding, a native Englishman and royal financier of Bristol, whose family also took the name \\"de Berkeley\\". To mollify the ill-feelings of Roger of Dursley, Henry II encouraged each family to marry their respective male heirs to the eldest daughters of the other, which was successfully accomplished.Cokayne, The Complete Peerage, new edition, vol.2, p. 124-5; Sanders, I.J. English Baronies, Oxford, 1960, p.13 The epithets below were assigned by John Smith (d.1640) of Nibley, household steward of the Berkeleys and author of Lives of the Berkeleys: *Robert FitzHarding, 1st feudal baron of Berkeley (d.1170/1) Robert the Devout. *Maurice FitzRobert FitzHarding, 2nd feudal baron of Berkeley (c.1120‚Äì1190/1) (otherwise \\"Maurice I de Berkeley\\") Maurice the Make-Peace, son, who in accordance with the wishes of King Henry II married Alice de Berkeley, eldest daughter of Roger III \\"de Berkeley\\" (d. after 1177) of Dursley.Cokayne, The Complete Peerage, new edition, II, p.125-6 *Robert de Berkeley, 3rd feudal baron of Berkeley (c.1165‚Äì1220) Robert the Rebellious, son *Thomas I de Berkeley, 4th feudal baron of Berkeley (c.1170‚Äì1243) Thomas the Observer or Temporiser, brother *Maurice II de Berkeley, 5th feudal baron of Berkeley (1218‚Äì1281) Maurice the Resolute, son Barons Berkeley, by writ, First Creation (1295) From 1295 the feudal barony continued concurrently with the barony by writ. The feudal barony continued until the Tenures Abolition Act 1660. The feudal barony of Berkeley is especially important in that the barony by writ was deemed, extraordinarily, to be in effect a feudal barony (or barony by tenure), dependent on the tenure of Berkeley Castle. Thus when William Berkeley, 1st Marquess of Berkeley, 2nd Baron Berkeley (1426‚Äì1492), William the Waste-All, alienated Berkeley Castle to the king, he effectively disinherited his younger brother from the barony by writ.Sir John Maclean, editor of Lives of the Berkeleys, refers to \\"the vexed question of the baronial tenure of Berkeley\\" and comments on this issue in: Smith, John, Lives of the Berkeleys, Vol.2, Preface, p.viii *Thomas de Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley, 6th feudal baron of Berkeley (1245‚Äì1321) Thomas the Wise, son.Cokayne, The Complete Peerage, new edition, II, p.127-8 *Maurice de Berkeley, 2nd Baron Berkeley, 7th feudal baron of Berkeley (1271‚Äì1326), Maurice the Magnanimous, son.Cokayne, The Complete Peerage, new edition, II, p.128-9 *Thomas de Berkeley, 3rd Baron Berkeley, 8th feudal baron of Berkeley (1293/6‚Äì1361) Thomas the Rich, son. *Maurice de Berkeley, 4th Baron Berkeley, 9th feudal baron of Berkeley (1320‚Äì1368) Maurice the Valiant, son.Cokayne, The Complete Peerage, new edition, II, p.130 *Thomas de Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley, 10th feudal baron of Berkeley (1353‚Äì1417) Thomas the Magnificent,For biography of Thomas the Magnificent, see Smith, Lives of the Berkeleys, Vol.II, pp.447 et seq son, died without male progeny.

It is ranked in the top 100 young universities in the world by the Times Higher Education World University Rankings.  History  The initial predecessor institution to Southern Cross University was the Lismore Teachers' College, which commenced operation on 23 February 1970, at what is now the Northern Rivers Conservatorium site.Jordan, M. A Spirit of Learning: The Jubilee of the University of New England. University of NSW Press, Sydney. p.244. On 1 September 1971, the Lismore Teachers College became a College of Advanced Education, under the Higher Education Act 1969, with the institution soon renamed Northern Rivers College of Advanced Education in 1973. Dr (later Professor) Rod Treyvaud was appointed principal in 1984, and oversaw an extensive building programme and the introduction of six new degree courses. Following the publication of the Commonwealth Government's White Paper on Higher Education in 1988 and its emphasis on the development of larger tertiary education institutions in Australia, Northern Rivers College of Advanced Education agreed to an association with the University of New England (UNE). On 17 July 1989 the Northern Rivers CAE thus became part of network University of New England, with some 1800 staff and some 9500 EFTSU (effective full-time student units).Jordan, M. A Spirit of Learning: The Jubilee of the University of New England. University of NSW Press, Sydney. p.236. There was however dissatisfaction with the new network university,Jordan, M. A Spirit of Learning: The Jubilee of the University of New England. University of NSW Press, Sydney. pp.236-254. and on 29 June 1993 the federal and state ministers for education jointly announced that a new university would be established in the North Coast of NSW, which would consist of campuses at Lismore (formerly UNE - Northern Rivers) and Coffs Harbour (formerly UNE - Coffs Harbour Centre). It was subsequently announced that the new institution would be called Southern Cross University. Appropriate legislation was passed by both houses of the New South Wales Parliament in October 1993, and received the Royal Assent on 9 November 1993. Southern Cross University was formally established on 1 January 1994. In 2010, Southern Cross University opened a new campus in the southern Gold Coast area of Queensland, at Coolangatta just 400 metres from North Kirra Beach and adjacent to the Gold Coast International Airport. Views of the Pacific Ocean can be seen from many vantage points in the campus' buildings. The Foundation Building was opened in 2010 and a second 10-story building opened in February 2013. In 2019 a new health sciences building was opened at the Coffs Harbour campus funded from the Australian Government‚Äôs Community Development Grants program. Degrees in nursing, midwifery, occupational therapy and sport exercise science are offered in the new space.  Governance  The University is governed by a Council, to which the Chief Executive Officer (the Vice-Chancellor) reports. The Council is responsible for the management of the University's affairs. The major academic body providing advice to Council on academic matter is the Academic Board. The Council has 15 members, including the Chancellor, the Vice Chancellor, the Chair of the Academic Board, two members appointed by the Minister, six members appointed by Council, three elected staff members and one elected student member.  Campuses = Lismore  Lismore is a regional city located in the Northern Rivers region of NSW. The Lismore campus is set on more than 75 hectares, and houses specialist training teaching facilities including a science and engineering precinct, environmental laboratories, contemporary music and visual arts studios and the SCU Health Clinic. The Learning Centre, at the centre of the campus, features individual and collaborative learning spaces.  Gold Coast  The Gold Coast campus is the only Australian university campus located at an airport. The campus is at Coolangatta, in Queensland, close to North Kirra Beach and adjacent to the Gold Coast Airport. The campus includes general teaching facilities, as well as specialist teaching facilities for nursing and midwifery, and allied heath disciplines such as occupational therapy, podiatry, pedorthics and speech pathology. Tourism, business, information technology, law, education, arts and social welfare are also taught at the Gold Coast.  Coffs Harbour  The Coffs Harbour campus is located on the mid-north coast of New South Wales, and consists of general teaching facilities, and specialist nursing laboratories, teaching spaces for education students, a biosciences laboratory, and psychology research facilities. The campus is shared with a senior high school and a technical college.  National Marine Science Centre  Southern Cross University operates the National Marine Science Centre (NMSC) in Coffs Harbour on the northern side of the city. The NMSC is an international leader in a range of marine research fields, conducting research projects around the world. Research at the National Marine Science Centre (NMSC) addresses critical challenges to the future of the marine environment across four broad areas: Biodiversity, Ecological Interactions, Aquaculture and Sustainable Fisheries. Facilities at the NMSC include a flow-through seawater system that supplies labs, tank farm, aquarium room and hatchery. The Centre also operates the Solitary Islands Aquarium which is open to the public.  Sydney and Melbourne  Southern Cross University operates The Hotel School Sydney and The Hotel School Melbourne in partnership with Mulpha Australia. Both The Hotel School Sydney and The Hotel School Melbourne are located in the central business districts of their respective cities and have executive offices and teaching facilities. Southern Cross University also operates branch campuses in Sydney and Melbourne, delivering business and accounting degrees to undergraduate and postgraduate international students.

It was created in 1643 by letters patent for John Byron, 1st Baron Byron, a Cavalier general and former Member of Parliament. The peerage was created with remainder to the heirs male of his body, failing, to his six brothers: Richard, William, Thomas, Robert, Gilbert, and Philip, and the heirs male of their bodies. Lord Byron died childless and was succeeded according to the special remainder by his next eldest brother Richard, the second Baron.G.E. Cokayne; with Vicary Gibbs, H.A. Doubleday, Geoffrey H.

The latter's great-grandson, the fifth Baron, killed his cousin and neighbour William Chaworth in a duel on 26 January 1765. He was brought before his peers in the House of Lords but under the statute of Edward VI he was found guilty only of manslaughter and forced to pay a small fine. Byron henceforth became known as \\"the Wicked Lord\\" and \\"the Devil Byron\\". He was succeeded by his great-nephew, George Gordon Byron, the sixth Baron, the famous Romantic poet. He was the son of John \\"Mad Jack\\" Byron, son of Vice- Admiral the Hon. John \\"Foulweather Jack\\" Byron, second son of the fourth Baron and the younger brother of the fifth Baron. Lord Byron died without male issue and was succeeded by his first cousin, the seventh Baron, who was an admiral in the Royal Navy. On the death of his great-grandson, the eleventh Baron (who had succeeded his first cousin once-removed in 1949), this line of the family expired. The late Baron was succeeded by his distant relative (his fifth cousin), the twelfth Baron. He was the great-great-great-grandson of Reverend the Hon. Richard Byron, third son of the fourth Baron. As of 2009 the title is held by his second son, the thirteenth Baron, who succeeded in 1989. From the 16th century until 1818, the family residence of the Lords Byron was Newstead Abbey in Nottinghamshire.

Early life Born in Neville, Saskatchewan,\\"W. Ross Thatcher, Ex‚ÄêPremier Of Saskatchewan, 54, Is Dead\\", New York Times, July 24, 1971. Thatcher was a Moose Jaw-based businessman, who developed an interest in politics shortly after the birth of his son, Colin Thatcher. Ross's father, Wilbur, had built a chain of hardware stores across the province, which the son helped to manage.Quiring, Brett, Thatcher, Wilbert Ross, Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan, accessed March 16, 2008 He graduated from high school at 15 and attended Queen's University, in Kingston, Ontario, where he earned a commerce degree at 18. Thatcher became executive assistant to the vice-president of Canada Packers, in Toronto, but had to return to Saskatchewan to run the family business after his father had become ill. Political career=Federal CCF Member of Parliament Believing that because of the Great Depression, private business alone could not stimulate economic development in the province, he joined the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation and was elected to Moose Jaw City Council on a labour-reform slate in 1942. In 1945, he was elected to Parliament representing Moose Jaw. Thatcher grew increasingly uncomfortable in the CCF because of his roots in the business world, and he soon found himself on the right wing of the party caucus. In 1955, he left the CCF over the issue of corporate taxation. He sat out his term as an Independent MP before he ran unsuccessfully for the Liberal Party of Canada in the 1957 federal election. Mossbank debate During the campaign, he attacked the provincial CCF government's record on crown corporations by describing them as a dismal failure.Thatcher, Wilbert Ross, Canadian Encyclopedia, accessed March 16, 2008 Saskatchewan Premier Tommy Douglas was angered and challenged Thatcher to a radio debate in the town of Mossbank, which was broadcast across the province. The debate was largely regarded as a draw. However, many observers believed that Thatcher had more than held his own against the formidable Douglas. The debate established Thatcher as the province's main anti-CCF standard bearer. Defeat in federal politics Thatcher was defeated by Hazen Argue in the 1957 federal election and again in 1958. Entry to provincial politics Despite his defeat at the federal level, Thatcher was courted by the provincial Saskatchewan Liberal Party and became its leader in 1959 at the party's leadership convention by defeating three rivals. He led the party into the 1960 provincial election, which was fought over the issue of Medicare. The Liberals increased their level of public support but could make a significant dent in the Saskatchewan CCF's large majority. The CCF had held power since the 1944 election. Thatcher himself was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan from the rural southern riding of Morse. Premier of Saskatchewan The Liberals had gained momentum, however, and the anti-CCF opposition coalesced around them, particularly in the face of events such as the Saskatchewan doctors' strike, which had hurt the CCF's popularity. The Liberals won a string of by-elections over the next three years. In the 1964 provincial election, the Liberals won a narrow victory that ended 20 years of CCF-NDP government.The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation became the New Democratic Party of Canada in 1961. The Saskatchewan CCF used CCF-NDP as a transitional name before it became the Saskatchewan NDP in 1967 The Liberals were only 0.1% ahead of the CCF in the popular vote. However, a sharp decline in Social Credit support allowed the Liberals to win a six-seat majority. By now, there was very little left of Thatcher's roots in the CCF. His government sold several crown corporations and declared the province \\"open for business\\" by encouraging private investment in the potash and other industries. On economic issues, Thatcher's government was classically liberal, and Thatcher often clashed with the federal Liberal governments of Lester Pearson and Pierre Trudeau over agricultural policy, social welfare policies (which the federal party supported and Thatcher opposed), and constitutional reform as well as the federal Liberals' attempts to form a federal political organization in the province separate from the provincial party. Thatcher was re-elected with a slightly-increased majority in 1967. He then introduced an austerity program, which cut government services, increased taxes, and introduced user fees on medical procedures. Reduced government investment hurt both the potash industry and agriculture, and Thatcher's administration became increasingly unpopular. His government was defeated by the Saskatchewan New Democratic Party,the new name of the Saskatchewan CCF, which was led by Allan Blakeney, in the June 1971 election. Although the Liberals won roughly the same number of votes as in 1967, a collapse in Progressive Conservative support resulted in the Liberals losing almost half of their seats. Death In July 1971, only a few weeks after his defeat in the election, he died in his sleep in Regina, Saskatchewan, apparently as a result of complications from diabetes and a heart condition. His death shocked the Saskatchewan public, and JoAnn Thatcher, who at the time was the wife of the former premier's son Colin Thatcher, later claimed she suspected the death was a suicide. However, it was an open secret that Thatcher had largely refused to deal with his severe diabetes over the years. A former aide told reporters that Thatcher's health had been so run down that his death from natural causes surprised few insiders. CTV News journalist Keith Morrison interviewed Thatcher only a few hours before his death and is believed to be the last reporter to speak to him.Anchor away: Journalist Keith Morrison has found success south of the border from the Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, July 2, 2003; accessed August 6, 2010 Family=Peggy Thatcher Thatcher's widow, Peggy, was persuaded to run for the federal parliament in support of Trudeau's Liberals in the 1972 federal election but came only a weak third in Regina East.History of Federal Ridings, Regina East, accessed March 16, 2008 Colin Thatcher In the 1975 provincial election Thatcher's son, Colin, would win a seat in Thunder Creek, a new constituency that contained parts of the riding that his father had represented. Although he was first elected as a Liberal, he later crossed the floor to the Progressive Conservatives before joining the government after the Blakeney government was swept from power in the 1982 provincial election. Following a brief stint as a cabinet minister in the Progressive Conservative government, he was later charged with murdering his ex-wife, JoAnn Wilson. He was convicted of first degree murder by the jury in the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench. His appeals to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada were dismissed.R v Thatcher, [1987 1 SCR 652.] ReferencesExternal links * Category:1917 births Category:1971 deaths Category:Premiers of Saskatchewan Category:Co-operative Commonwealth Federation MPs Category:Independent MPs in the Canadian House of Commons Category:Candidates in the 1957 Canadian federal election Category:Candidates in the 1958 Canadian federal election Category:Saskatchewan Liberal Party MLAs Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from Saskatchewan Category:Members of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada Category:Members of the United Church of Canada Category:People from Moose Jaw Category:Liberal Party of Canada candidates for the Canadian House of Commons Category:Leaders of the Saskatchewan Liberal Party ","title":"Ross Thatcher"},{"id":"458630","text":"The arms of Lord Braye. http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/braye1529.htm Baron Braye, of Eaton Bray in the County of Bedford, is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1529 for Edmund Braye, 1st Baron Braye. However the family originally originate from Normandy, they are direct descendants of Chevalier Baudry de Bray who came over to England in the battle of Hastings of 1066. The barony was created by writ, which means that it can descend through both male and female lines. He was succeeded by his son, the second Baron. He died from wounds received at the Battle of St Quentin in 1557. Lord Braye was childless and on his death the title fell into abeyance between his sisters. It remained in abeyance for 282 years until the abeyance was terminated in 1839 in favour of Sarah Otway-Cave, who became the third Baroness Braye. She was the wife of Henry Otway and only daughter of Sir Thomas Cave, 6th Baronet, of Stanford, grandson of Sir Thomas Cave, 3rd Baronet, of Stanford, and his wife the Hon. Margaret Verney, daughter of John Verney, 1st Viscount Fermanagh, great-great- grandson of Hon. Elizabeth Verney, second daughter of the first Baron Braye, and her husband Sir Ralph Verney. In 1819 she assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Cave. When she died in 1862 the barony fell into abeyance between her four daughters. In 1879 the abeyance was terminated in favour of the last surviving daughter, Henrietta, the fourth Baroness. She was the wife of Reverend Edgell Wyatt-Edgell. She was succeeded by her fourth but eldest surviving son, the fifth Baron. In 1880 he assumed by Royal licence the surname of Verney-Cave in lieu of Wyatt-Edgell. As of 2010 the title is held by his great-granddaughter, the eighth Baroness, who succeeded her father in 1985. She is the wife of Edward Henry Lancelot Aubrey-Fletcher, fourth son of Sir Henry Aubrey-Fletcher, 6th Baronet. They have no children.

Reason for creation  London's Docklands were at one time the largest and most successful in the world. Starting with West India Docks in 1802, East India Docks, Millwall Dock, Surrey Docks and then the Royal Docks, thousands of people were employed in international trade, warehousing and related trades. Over time, manufacturing industry also moved into the Docklands, including large coal and gas plants and storage, flour mills and many other businesses. During World War II, the docks area was heavily bombed during the Blitz, in an attempt to destroy the British economy. This crippled or damaged much of the infrastructure and many older buildings were lost or no longer used. There was a brief resurgence during the 1950s but the docks were empty by 1980. The main reason was containerisation: goods used to be brought into the UK by relatively small ships, unloaded by hand, from the 1970s onwards most trade was carried within intermodal containers (shipping containers) or by truck on roll-on/roll-off ferries. Between 1961 and 1971, almost 83,000 jobs were lost in the five boroughs in the Docklands area (Greenwich, Lewisham, Newham, Tower Hamlets and Southwark). A large percentage of these jobs were from large transnational corporations. The decline was heightened by government policies which favoured the growth of industry outside London. The housing in the Docklands area was nearly all council-owned terraced housing and flats. There was no commercial infrastructure such as banks or building societies or any new office accommodation.  Formation  The London Docklands Development Corporation was established by the then Secretary of State for the Environment, Michael Heseltine, under section 135 of the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980. It was financed by a grant from central government and from the proceeds from the disposal of land for development. The corporation acted as a catalyst benefiting from the full range of planning authority powers (principally those of development control). Additionally, the Government set up an Enterprise Zone with certain tax breaks in the area.  Operation 1981-1994  LDDC's first chief executive was Reg Ward, a former chief executive of Hereford and Worcester County Council and Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council.Obituary: Reg Ward, Daily Telegraph, 12 January 2011 Ward said if he had created some grand plan...\\"we would still be debating and nothing would have got built. Instead, we have gone for an organic, market-driven approach, responding pragmatically to each situation.\\" Billingsgate Market had already relocated from the City to Docklands, and this was thought to be typical of the type of industry which might be accommodated. However, Docklands was close to the City of London and this made it an attractive secondary office location as well as a possible site for riverside residential development to accommodate the phenomenon of yuppies, the young high-income single-person households created by new jobs in the financial services industry. In the first few years of LDDC's operation several offices and flats schemes were given the go ahead including on Heron Quays and Surrey Quays. Many of these buildings demonstrated unique architecture, such as the Baltic Quay building in the Surrey Docks. LDDC's success was due to seizing opportunity and making maximum use of its assets. When American/Swiss banker Michael von Clemm visited West India Docks looking for a restaurant site, he became interested in the idea of building a back office. Reg Ward jumped on this and the resulting scheme became the successful Canary Wharf development. When faced with a large amount of redundant railway infrastructure, the LDDC created a cheap light rail scheme, the Docklands Light Railway to make use of it. This in turn made the whole area more accessible to the public and helped create the conditions for further development. The LDDC tapped into the boom in air travel by creating a small business airport making use of the vast open spaces of the Royal Docks. London City Airport became a fast-growing and popular airport. During the 1980s private housing was developed in Docklands which with some minor exceptions were the first to be built in the area. Soon many people from outside the area saw the opportunity of buying a house close to the city at what appeared to be cheap prices. On many of the developments, local council tenants were given first opportunities to buy at discounted prices, but this led to a number of abuses.  Effects outside London  The success of the LDDC spurred the government to set up similar bodies elsewhere, for example in Merseyside (1981) and later the Black Country, Cardiff Bay, Trafford Park (Greater Manchester) (all 1987), and the Central Manchester Development Corporation (1988).Impact of Urban Development Corporations in Leeds, Bristol and Central Manchester, DETR, 1998. Undemocratic nature One feature of the LDDC was that it was \\"insulated\\" from the local democratically elected councils. Eddie Oliver, Deputy Chief Executive (1981-87) agreed that it was undemocratic, explaining that it was an extraordinary arrangement for an extraordinary situation\\".  Withdrawal 1994-1998  The LDDC began a staged withdrawal in 1994. It withdrew from Bermondsey in 1994, followed by Beckton in 1995, the Surrey Docks in 1996, from Wapping, Limehouse and the Isle of Dogs in 1997, and finally from the Royal Docks in late 1998. Under a process called \\"dedesignation\\" the powers it held reverted to the London boroughs. It was formally wound up on 31 March 1998.

Horton (born August 12, 1951) is an American convicted felon who, while serving a life sentence for murder (without the possibility of parole), was the beneficiary of a Massachusetts weekend furlough program. He did not return from his furlough, and ultimately committed assault, armed robbery, and rape before being captured and sentenced in Maryland where he remains incarcerated. The controversy over Horton's furlough became a major issue in the 1988 presidential campaign, as George H.W. Bush brought him up frequently during his campaign. A prominent PAC ad for Bush about Horton has been widely characterized as a case of dog-whistle politics. Criminal activity and incarceration On October 26, 1974, in Lawrence, Massachusetts, Horton and two accomplices robbed Joseph Fournier, a White, 17-year-old gas station attendant, and then fatally stabbed Fournier nineteen times after he had cooperated by handing over all of the money in the cash register. His body was stuffed in a trash can so his feet were jammed up against his chin. Fournier died from blood loss. Horton was convicted of murder, sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, and incarcerated at the Northeastern Correctional Center in Massachusetts. On June 6, 1986, he was released as part of a weekend furlough program but did not return. On April 3, 1987, in Oxon Hill, Maryland, Horton twice raped a woman after pistol- whipping, knifing, binding, and gagging her fianc√©. He then stole the car belonging to the man he had assaulted. He was later shot by Corporal Paul J. Lopez of the Prince George's County Police Department and captured by Corporal Yusuf A. Muhammad, also of the Prince George's County Police Department, after a pursuit. On October 20, Horton was sentenced in Maryland to two consecutive life terms plus 85 years. The sentencing judge, Vincent J. Femia, refused to return Horton to Massachusetts, saying, \\"I'm not prepared to take the chance that Mr. Horton might again be furloughed or otherwise released. This man should never draw a breath of free air again.\\" On April 18, 1996, Horton was transferred to the Jessup Correctional Institution (then called the Maryland House of Correction Annex), a maximum security prison in Jessup, Maryland, where he remains. Legislative and political background Democratic Presidential candidate Michael Dukakis was the governor of Massachusetts at the time of Horton's release, and while he did not start the furlough program, he had supported it as a method of criminal rehabilitation. The state inmate furlough program, originally signed into law by Republican Governor Francis Sargent in 1972, excluded convicted first-degree murderers. However, in 1973, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that this right extended to first-degree murderers, because the law specifically did not exclude them. The Massachusetts legislature quickly passed a bill prohibiting furloughs for such inmates. However, in 1976, Dukakis vetoed this bill arguing it would \\"cut the heart out of efforts at inmate rehabilitation.\\" The program remained in effect through the intervening term of Governor Edward J. King, and was abolished during Dukakis' final term of office on April 28, 1988, after Dukakis had decided to run for President. This abolition occurred only after the Lawrence Eagle-Tribune had run 175 stories about the furlough program and won a Pulitzer Prize. Horton was later interviewed in the periodical, The Nation: > The fact is, my name is not 'Willie.' It's part of the myth of the case. The > name irks me. It was created to play on racial stereotypes: big, ugly, dumb, > violent, black ‚Äî 'Willie'. I resent that. They created a fictional character > ‚Äî who seemed believable, but who did not exist. They stripped me of my > identity, distorted the facts, and robbed me of my constitutional rights. Horton in the 1988 presidential campaign The first person to mention the Massachusetts furlough program in the 1988 presidential campaign was Democratic Senator Al Gore. During a debate before the New York primary, Gore took issue with the furlough program. However, he did not specifically mention the Horton incident or even his name, instead asking a general question about the Massachusetts furlough program. Republicans eagerly picked up the Horton issue after Dukakis won the Democratic nomination. In June 1988, Republican candidate George H.W. Bush seized on the Horton case, bringing it up repeatedly in campaign speeches. Bush's campaign manager Lee Atwater said: \\"By the time we're finished, they're going to wonder whether Willie Horton is Dukakis' running mate.\\" Campaign staffer James Pinkerton returned with reams of material that Atwater told him to reduce to a index card, telling him \\"I'm giving you one thing: You can use both sides of the 3√ó5 card.\\" Pinkerton discovered the furlough issue by watching the Felt Forum debate. On May 25, 1988, Republican consultants met in Paramus, New Jersey, holding a focus group of \\"Reagan Democrats\\" who had voted for Ronald Reagan in 1984. These focus groups convinced Atwater and the other Republican consultants that they should 'go negative' against Dukakis. Further information regarding the furlough came from aide Andrew Card, a Massachusetts native whom President George W. Bush later named as his Chief of Staff. Over the Fourth of July weekend in 1988, Atwater attended a motorcyclists' convention in Luray, Virginia. Two couples were talking about the Horton story as featured in the July issue of Reader's Digest. Atwater joined them without mentioning who he was. Later that night, a focus group in Alabama had turned completely against Dukakis when presented the information about Horton's furlough. Atwater used this occurrence to argue the necessity of pounding Dukakis about the furlough issue. Fall campaign Beginning on September 21, 1988, the Americans for Bush arm of the National Security Political Action Committee (NSPAC), under the auspices of Floyd Brown, began running a campaign ad entitled \\"Weekend Passes\\", using the Horton case to attack Dukakis. The ad was produced by media consultant Larry McCarthy, who had previously worked for Roger Ailes. After clearing the ad with television stations, McCarthy added a mug shot of Horton. The ad was run as an independent expenditure, separate from the Bush campaign, which claimed not to have had any role in its production. The ad referred to Horton as \\"Willie\\", although he later said he had always gone by William. On October 5, 1988, a day after the \\"Weekend Passes\\" ad was taken off the airwaves and the day of the Bentsen‚ÄìQuayle debate, the Bush campaign ran its own ad, \\"Revolving Door\\", which also attacked Dukakis over the weekend furlough program. While the advertisement did not mention Horton or feature his photograph, it depicted a variety of men walking in and out of prison through a revolving door. The controversy escalated when Vice Presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen and former Democratic presidential candidate and civil rights leader Jesse Jackson called the \\"Revolving Door\\" ad racist, a charge which was denied by Bush and campaign staff. Through most of the campaign, the Horton ad was seen as focusing on issues of criminal justice, with neither the candidates nor journalists mentioning a racial component. However, near the end of the presidential campaign‚Äîon October 21, 1988‚ÄîDemocratic primary runner-up Jesse Jackson accused the ad's creators of playing upon presumed fears of some voters, in particular those harboring stereotyped fears of blacks as criminals. From that point on, race was a substantial part of the media coverage of the ad itself and the campaign. Some candidates continued to deny it and most commentators at the time felt it was not. Academics have noted that the alleged racial overtone of the ad was a key aspect of the way the ad was remembered and later studied. On October 22, in an attempt to counter- attack, Dukakis' campaign ran an ad about a convicted heroin dealer named Angel Medrano who raped and killed a pregnant mother of two after escaping from a federal correctional halfway house. In 1990, the Ohio Democratic Party and a group called \\"Black Elected Democrats of Ohio\\" filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging that NSPAC had coordinated or cooperated with the Bush campaign in airing the ad, which would make it an illegal in kind campaign contribution. Investigation by the FEC, including deposition of officials from both organizations, revealed indirect connections between McCarthy and the Bush campaign (such as his having previously worked for Ailes), but found no direct evidence of wrongdoing, and the investigation reached an impasse and was eventually closed with no finding of any violation of campaign finance laws. Robin Toner of The New York Times wrote in 1990 that Republicans and Democrats, while disagreeing on the merits of the ad itself, agreed it was \\"devastating to Dukakis.\\" Dukakis said in 2012 that while he initially tried to ignore the ad during the 1988 campaign, two months later he \\"realized that I was getting killed with this stuff.\\" In December 2018, after Bush's death, the ad was again highlighted by political commentators. Ann Coulter described his Willie Horton ad as \\"the greatest campaign commercial in political history\\", claiming that it \\"clearly and forcefully highlighted the two presidential candidates' diametrically opposed views\\" on crime. Many other commentators remarked that the Bush presidency, and back to the Horton ad of the campaign, stoked racial animosity. Many commentators have pointed to race- bating or similar dog whistle in the ad, and the fact that he was black is still a key part of how the ad is still discussed.

It is an oxidizing agent, able to transfer oxygen to a variety of substrates, while gaining one or more electrons via oxidation-reduction (redox). It does not hydrolyze when it enters water, and is usually handled as a dissolved gas in solution in water. Potential hazards with chlorine dioxide include health concerns, explosiveness and fire ignition. It is commonly used as a bleach. Chlorine dioxide was discovered in 1811 and has been widely used for bleaching purposes in the paper industry, and for treatment of drinking water. More recent developments have extended its application into food processing, disinfection of premises and vehicles, mold eradication, air disinfection and odor control, treatment of swimming pools, dental applications, and wound cleansing. The compound has been fraudulently marketed as an ingestible cure for a wide range of diseases, including childhood autism and COVID-19. Children who have been given enemas of chlorine dioxide as a supposed cure for childhood autism have suffered life-threatening ailments. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has stated that ingestion or other internal use of chlorine dioxide (other than perhaps oral rinsing under dentist supervision) has no health benefits and it should not be used internally for any reason.  Structure and bonding  Comparison of three-electron bond to the conventional covalent bond The two resonance structures Chlorine dioxide is a neutral chlorine compound. It is very different from elemental chlorine, both in its chemical structure and in its behavior. One of the most important qualities of chlorine dioxide is its high water solubility, especially in cold water. Chlorine dioxide does not hydrolyze when it enters water; it remains a dissolved gas in solution. Chlorine dioxide is approximately 10 times more soluble in water than chlorine. The molecule ClO2 has an odd number of valence electrons, and therefore, it is a paramagnetic radical. Its electronic structure has long baffled chemists because none of the possible Lewis structures is very satisfactory. In 1933, L. O. Brockway proposed a structure that involved a three-electron bond. Chemist Linus Pauling further developed this idea and arrived at two resonance structures involving a double bond on one side and a single bond plus three-electron bond on the other. In Pauling's view the latter combination should represent a bond that is slightly weaker than the double bond. In molecular orbital theory this idea is commonplace if the third electron is placed in an anti-bonding orbital. Later work has confirmed that the highest occupied molecular orbital is indeed an incompletely-filled antibonding orbital.  Preparation  Chlorine dioxide is a compound that can decompose extremely violently when separated from diluting substances. As a result, preparation methods that involve producing solutions of it without going through a gas-phase stage are often preferred. Arranging handling in a safe manner is essential.  Oxidation of chlorite  In the laboratory, ClO2 can be prepared by oxidation of sodium chlorite with chlorine: : 2 NaClO2 \\\\+ Cl2 ‚Üí 2 ClO2 \\\\+ 2 NaCl Traditionally, chlorine dioxide for disinfection applications has been made from sodium chlorite or the sodium chlorite‚Äìhypochlorite method: :2 NaClO2 \\\\+ 2 HCl + NaOCl ‚Üí 2 ClO2 \\\\+ 3 NaCl + H2O or the sodium chlorite‚Äìhydrochloric acid method: :5 NaClO2 \\\\+ 4 HCl ‚Üí 5 NaCl + 4 ClO2 \\\\+ 2 H2O or the chlorite‚Äìsulfuric acid method: :4 \\\\+ 2 H2SO4 ‚Üí 2 ClO2 \\\\+ HClO3 \\\\+ 2 \\\\+ H2O + HCl All three methods can produce chlorine dioxide with high chlorite conversion yield. Unlike the other processes, the chlorite‚Äìsulfuric acid method produces completely chlorine-free chlorine dioxide, although it suffers from the requirement of 25% more chlorite to produce an equivalent amount of chlorine dioxide. Alternatively, hydrogen peroxide may be efficiently used in small-scale applications.  Reduction of chlorate  In the laboratory, chlorine dioxide can also be prepared by reaction of potassium chlorate with oxalic acid: : 2 KClO3 \\\\+ 2 H2C2O4 ‚Üí K2C2O4 \\\\+ 2 ClO2 \\\\+ 2 CO2 \\\\+ 2 H2O : 2 KClO3 \\\\+ H2C2O4 \\\\+ 2 H2SO4 ‚Üí 2 KHSO4 \\\\+ 2 ClO2 \\\\+ 2 CO2 \\\\+ 2 H2O Over 95% of the chlorine dioxide produced in the world today is made by reduction of sodium chlorate, for use in pulp bleaching. It is produced with high efficiency in a strong acid solution with a suitable reducing agent such as methanol, hydrogen peroxide, hydrochloric acid or sulfur dioxide. Modern technologies are based on methanol or hydrogen peroxide, as these chemistries allow the best economy and do not co-produce elemental chlorine. The overall reaction can be written as: : chlorate + acid + reducing agent ‚Üí chlorine dioxide + by-products As a typical example, the reaction of sodium chlorate with hydrochloric acid in a single reactor is believed to proceed through the following pathway: : + + ‚Üí + HOCl : + + 2 ‚Üí 2 \\\\+ : + + ‚Üí + which gives the overall reaction :2 \\\\+ 2 \\\\+ 4 ‚Üí 2 \\\\+ + 2 . The commercially more important production route uses methanol as the reducing agent and sulfuric acid for the acidity. Two advantages of not using the chloride-based processes are that there is no formation of elemental chlorine, and that sodium sulfate, a valuable chemical for the pulp mill, is a side- product. These methanol-based processes provide high efficiency and can be made very safe. The variant process using chlorate, hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid has been increasingly used since 1999 for water treatment and other small-scale disinfection applications, since it produce a chlorine-free product at high efficiency.  Other processes  Very pure chlorine dioxide can also be produced by electrolysis of a chlorite solution: :2 NaClO2 \\\\+ 2 H2O ‚Üí 2 ClO2 \\\\+ 2 NaOH + H2 High-purity chlorine dioxide gas (7.7% in air or nitrogen) can be produced by the gas‚Äìsolid method, which reacts dilute chlorine gas with solid sodium chlorite: :2 NaClO2 \\\\+ Cl2 ‚Üí 2 ClO2 \\\\+ 2 NaCl  Handling properties  At partial pressures above 10 kPa (or gas-phase concentrations greater than 10% volume in air at STP), ClO2 may explosively decompose into chlorine and oxygen. The decomposition can be initiated by light, hot spots, chemical reaction, or pressure shock. Thus, chlorine dioxide gas is never handled in concentrated form, but is almost always handled as a dissolved gas in water in a concentration range of 0.5 to 10 grams per liter. Its solubility increases at lower temperatures, thus it is common to use chilled water (5 ¬∞C) when storing at concentrations above 3 grams per liter. In many countries, such as the United States, chlorine dioxide gas may not be transported at any concentration and is almost always produced at the application site using a chlorine dioxide generator. In some countries, chlorine dioxide solutions below 3 grams per liter in concentration may be transported by land, however, they are relatively unstable and deteriorate quickly. Uses Chlorine dioxide is used for bleaching of wood pulp and for the disinfection (called chlorination) of municipal drinking water. As a disinfectant, it is effective even at low concentrations because of its unique qualities.  Bleaching  Chlorine dioxide is sometimes used for bleaching of wood pulp in combination with chlorine, but it is used alone in ECF (elemental chlorine-free) bleaching sequences. It is used at moderately acidic pH (3.5 to 6). The use of chlorine dioxide minimizes the amount of organochlorine compounds produced. Chlorine dioxide (ECF technology) currently is the most important bleaching method worldwide. About 95% of all bleached kraft pulp is made using chlorine dioxide in ECF bleaching sequences. Chlorine dioxide has been used to bleach flour.  Water treatment  The Niagara Falls, New York, water treatment plant first used chlorine dioxide for drinking water treatment in 1944 for destroying \\"taste and odor producing phenolic compounds\\". Chlorine dioxide was introduced as a drinking water disinfectant on a large scale in 1956, when Brussels, Belgium, changed from chlorine to chlorine dioxide. Its most common use in water treatment is as a pre-oxidant prior to chlorination of drinking water to destroy natural water impurities that would otherwise produce trihalomethanes on exposure to free chlorine. Trihalomethanes are suspect carcinogenic disinfection by-products associated with chlorination of naturally occurring organics in the raw water. Chlorine dioxide is also superior to chlorine when operating above pH 7, in the presence of ammonia and amines and for the control of biofilms in water distribution systems. Chlorine dioxide is used in many industrial water treatment applications as a biocide including cooling towers, process water, and food processing. Chlorine dioxide is less corrosive than chlorine and superior for the control of Legionella bacteria. Chlorine dioxide is superior to some other secondary water disinfection methods in that chlorine dioxide is an EPA-registered biocide, is not negatively impacted by pH, does not lose efficacy over time (the bacteria will not grow resistant to it), and is not negatively impacted by silica and phosphates, which are commonly used potable water corrosion inhibitors. It is more effective as a disinfectant than chlorine in most circumstances against waterborne pathogenic agents such as viruses, bacteria and protozoa ‚Äì including the cysts of Giardia and the oocysts of Cryptosporidium. The use of chlorine dioxide in water treatment leads to the formation of the by-product chlorite, which is currently limited to a maximum of 1 part per million in drinking water in the USA. This EPA standard limits the use of chlorine dioxide in the US to relatively high- quality water because this minimizes chlorite concentration, or water that is to be treated with iron-based coagulants (iron can reduce chlorite to chloride).  Use in public crises  Chlorine dioxide has many applications as an oxidizer or disinfectant. Chlorine dioxide can be used for air disinfection and was the principal agent used in the decontamination of buildings in the United States after the 2001 anthrax attacks. After the disaster of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, Louisiana, and the surrounding Gulf Coast, chlorine dioxide was used to eradicate dangerous mold from houses inundated by the flood water. In addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has posted a list of many disinfectants that meet its criteria for use in environmental measures against the causative coronavirus. Some are based on sodium chlorite that is activated into chlorine dioxide, though differing formulations are used in each product. Many other products on the EPA list contain sodium hypochlorite, which is similar in name but should not be confused with sodium chlorite because they have very different modes of chemical action.  Other disinfection uses  Chlorine dioxide may be used as a fumigant treatment to \\"sanitize\\" fruits such as blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries that develop molds and yeast. Chlorine dioxide may be used to disinfect poultry by spraying or immersing it after slaughtering. Chlorine dioxide may be used for the disinfection of endoscopes, such as under the trade name Tristel. It is also available in a trio consisting of a preceding pre-clean with surfactant and a succeeding rinse with deionized water and a low-level antioxidant. Chlorine dioxide may be used for control of zebra and quagga mussels in water intakes. Chlorine dioxide was shown to be effective in bedbug eradication.  Pseudomedicine  Chlorine dioxide is fraudulently marketed as a magic cure for a range of diseases from brain cancer to AIDS. Enemas of chlorine dioxide are a supposed cure for childhood autism, resulting in complaints to the FDA reporting life- threatening reactions, and even death. Chlorine dioxide is relabelled to a variety of brand names including, but not limited to MMS, Miracle Mineral Solution and CD protocol. There is no scientific basis for chlorine dioxide's medical properties and FDA has warned against its usage.  Other uses  Chlorine dioxide is used as an oxidant for destroying phenols in wastewater streams and for odor control in the air scrubbers of animal byproduct (rendering) plants. It is also available for use as a deodorant for cars and boats, in chlorine dioxide-generating packages that are activated by water and left in the boat or car overnight.  Safety issues in water and supplements  Chlorine dioxide is toxic, hence limits on exposure to it are needed to ensure its safe use. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has set a maximum level of 0.8 mg/L for chlorine dioxide in drinking water. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), an agency of the United States Department of Labor, has set an 8-hour permissible exposure limit of 0.1 ppm in air (0.3 mg/m3) for people working with chlorine dioxide. On July 30, 2010, and again on October 1, 2010, the United States Food and Drug Administration warned against the use of the product \\"Miracle Mineral Supplement\\", or \\"MMS\\", which when made up according to instructions produces chlorine dioxide. MMS has been marketed as a treatment for a variety of conditions, including HIV, cancer, autism, and acne. The FDA warnings informed consumers that MMS can cause serious harm to health and stated that it has received numerous reports of nausea, diarrhea, severe vomiting, and life- threatening low blood pressure caused by dehydration. This warning was repeated for a third time on 12 August 2019, and a fourth on April 8, 2020, stating that ingesting MMS is the same as drinking bleach, and urging consumers to not use them or give these products to their children for any reason.

It is part of the comarca of La Axarqu√≠a. It is on the country's southern Mediterranean coast, about 50 km east of M√°laga. Under Muslim rule, its name was Narixa, which means \\"abundant source\\" and is the origin of the current name. History Nerja has a long history, evidenced by the primitive paintings found in its famous Nerja caves, discovered in 1959. These caves are now believed to be just one entrance to a linked series of sinkholes stretching many miles into the mountains between Nerja and Granada, and which may yet prove to be one of the most extensive unexplored systems in Europe. Visitors to the caves will be able to view the remains of one of the ancient inhabitants of Nerja. The Romans built here three settlements, including Detunda, of which now large remains can be seen. The area was later taken over by the Arabs in the early 8th century. Under the Moors, the town was known as Narixa, which means \\"abundant spring\\", from which the present name derives. Aqueduct of Nerja. Its agricultural and silk products are said to have been famed throughout the Muslim world and in the markets of Damascus as early as the 10th century. Capistrano Playa, Nerja. The Balc√≥n de Europa, a mirador or viewpoint which gives stunning views across the sea, is in the centre of the old town. Its name is popularly believed to have been coined by King Alfonso XII, who visited the area in 1885 following a disastrous earthquake and was captivated by the scene. Local folklore says that he stood upon the site where the Balc√≥n now stands, and said \\"This is the balcony of Europe\\". Local archive documents are said to show that its name predated this visit, but this has not prevented the authorities from placing a life-sized (and much photographed) statue of the king standing by the railing. The Balc√≥n area was originally known as La Bater√≠a, a reference to the gun battery which existed there in a fortified tower. This emplacement and a similar tower nearby were destroyed during the Peninsular War. In May 1812, the British vessels Hyacinth, Termagant and Basilisk supported Spanish guerrillas on the coast of Granada, against the French. On 20 May, Termagant or Hyacinth opened fire and the forts were destroyed. Two rusty guns positioned at the end of the Balc√≥n are reminders of these violent times. The huge lumps of rock, the remains of La Bater√≠a, visible in the sea at the end of the Balc√≥n, are further evidence of this action.

The blackchins (Neoscopelidae) contain six species in three genera, while the bulk of the family belongs to the Myctophidae, with over 30 genera and some 252 species.Nelson (2006): p.223 The scientific name ultimately derives from Ancient Greek mykt√©r (ŒºœÖŒ∫œÑŒÆœÅ, \\"nose\\") + √≥phis (·ΩÑœÜ·øñœÇ, \\"serpent\\") + Latin forma (\\"external form\\"), the Greek part in reference to the long, slender, and heavy-headed shape of these fishes.Woodhouse (1910), Glare (1968-1982), FishBase (2006) Description and ecology These smallish fishes inhabit the pelagic and benthopelagic zones of the deep sea. They are laterally compressed and usually have photophores (light organs). The eyes are large, in some decidedly huge, and generally directed straight sideways. The mouth also quite large and located at the tip of the snout; its gape extends to below the eyes or even beyond. They have an adipose fin. The pelvic fin has eight rays in most myctophiforms, and the number of branchiostegal rays is usually higher than six and lower than 12. Systematics The two families of the Myctophiformes are:FishBase (2006) * Myctophidae - lanternfishes * Neoscopelidae - blackchins The order Myctophiformes is anatomically similar to the grinners (Aulopiformes), but their pharyngobranchials and retractor muscles are more plesiomorphic. It was also allied with the more advanced spiny-rayed Teleostei (e.g. Paracanthopterygii) as \\"Ctenosquamata\\". These apomorphically have a fifth upper pharyngeal toothplate and a third internal levator muscle to move it, and molecular data also support the long-held view that these two lineages are at least closely related. Other sources ally them with the Lampriformes, which are often placed in a monotypic superorder \\"Lampridiomorpha\\". In a similar fashion, separation of the Myctophiformes in superorder \\"Scopelomorpha\\" has been proposed. The Aulopiformes, though, are usually considered to be closer or even among the Protacanthopterygii, one of the core groups of moderately advanced teleosts. As modern taxonomy tries to avoid a profusion of small taxa, and the delimitation of the Euteleostei (Protacanthopterygii sensu stricto and their allies) versus \\"Ctenosquamata\\" such as the Paracanthopterygii remains uncertain, the systematics and taxonomy of the Myctophiformes among the teleosts are in need of further study.Nelson (2006): p.223, Diogo (2008) Timeline of genera ImageSize = width:1500px height:auto barincrement:15px PlotArea = left:10px bottom:50px top:10px right:10px Period = from:-145.5 till:15 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMajor = unit:year increment:10 start:-145.5 ScaleMinor = unit:year increment:1 start:-145.5 TimeAxis = orientation:hor AlignBars = justify Colors = #legends id:CAR value:claret id:ANK value:rgb(0.4,0.3,0.196) id:HER value:teal id:HAD value:green id:OMN value:blue id:black value:black id:white value:white id:cretaceous value:rgb(0.5,0.78,0.31) id:earlycretaceous value:rgb(0.63,0.78,0.65) id:latecretaceous value:rgb(0.74,0.82,0.37) id:cenozoic value:rgb(0.54,0.54,0.258) id:paleogene value:rgb(0.99,0.6,0.32) id:paleocene value:rgb(0.99,0.65,0.37) id:eocene value:rgb(0.99,0.71,0.42) id:oligocene value:rgb(0.99,0.75,0.48) id:neogene value:rgb(0.999999,0.9,0.1) id:miocene value:rgb(0.999999,0.999999,0) id:pliocene value:rgb(0.97,0.98,0.68) id:quaternary value:rgb(0.98,0.98,0.5) id:pleistocene value:rgb(0.999999,0.95,0.68) id:holocene value:rgb(0.999,0.95,0.88) BarData= bar:eratop bar:space bar:periodtop bar:space bar:NAM1 bar:NAM2 bar:NAM3 bar:NAM4 bar:NAM5 bar:NAM6 bar:NAM7 bar:NAM8 bar:NAM9 bar:NAM10 bar:NAM11 bar:NAM12 bar:NAM13 bar:NAM14 bar:NAM15 bar:NAM16 bar:NAM17 bar:NAM18 bar:NAM19 bar:NAM20 bar:NAM21 bar:NAM22 bar:NAM23 bar:NAM24 bar:NAM25 bar:NAM26 bar:NAM27 bar:space bar:period bar:space bar:era PlotData= align:center textcolor:black fontsize:M mark:(line,black) width:25 shift:(7,-4) bar:periodtop from: -145.5 till: -99.6 color:earlycretaceous text:Early from: -99.6 till: -65.5 color:latecretaceous text:Late from: -65.5 till: -55.8 color:paleocene text:Paleo. from: -55.8 till: -33.9 color:eocene text:Eo. from: -33.9 till: -23.03 color:oligocene text:Oligo. from: -23.03 till: -5.332 color:miocene text:Mio. from: -5.332 till: -2.588 color:pliocene text:Pl. from: -2.588 till: -0.0117 color:pleistocene text:Pl. from: -0.0117 till: 0 color:holocene text:H. bar:eratop from: -145.5 till: -65.5 color:cretaceous text:Cretaceous from: -65.5 till: -23.03 color:paleogene text:Paleogene from: -23.03 till: -2.588 color:neogene text:Neogene from: -2.588 till: 0 color:quaternary text:Q.

She was the most popular American novelist of her day.\\"Mrs. E. D. E. N. Southworth\\", in Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, Retrieved 7 March 2016Baym, Nina. \\"E.D.E.N. Southworth's The Hidden Hand\\", introduction to Oxford Popular Fiction Series edition of The Hidden Hand (1997) In her novels, her heroines often challenge modern perceptions of Victorian feminine domesticity by showing virtue as naturally allied to wit, adventure, and rebellion to remedy any unfortunate situation. Though The Hidden Hand (1859) was her most popular novel, Southworth's favorite of her works was her novel Ishmael (1876). Life and career E. D. E. N. Southworth was born Emma Nevitte on December 26, 1819, in Washington, D.C., to Susannah Wailes and Charles LeCompte Nevitte, a Virginia merchant. Her father died in 1824, and per his deathbed request she was christened Emma Dorothy Eliza Nevitte. She studied in a school kept by her stepfather, Joshua L. Henshaw. She later recalled her childhood as a lonely one, with her happiest moments spent exploring Maryland's Tidewater region on horseback. During those rides, she acquired an abiding interest in the area's history and folklore. After attending her stepfather's school, she completed her secondary education in 1835 at the age of 15. She then accepted a position as a schoolteacher. In 1840 she married inventor Frederick H. Southworth, of Utica, New York. Southworth moved with her husband to Wisconsin to become a teacher. After 1843, she returned to Washington, D.C. without her husband and with two young children. After the birth of their second child, Frederick abandoned his family in search of Brazilian gold. Southworth never divorced her husband on conscientious grounds. She began to write stories to support herself and her children when her husband deserted her in 1844. Her first story, \\"The Irish Refugee\\", was published in the Baltimore Saturday Visiter. Some of her earliest works appeared in The National Era, the newspaper that printed Uncle Tom's Cabin. The bulk of her work appeared as a serial in Robert E. Bonner's New York Ledger, and in 1857 Southworth signed a contract to write exclusively for this publication. The exclusive contract Southworth signed with Bonner in 1856 and royalties from her published novels earned her about $10,000 a year, making her one of the country's best-paid writers. Southworth and her children were in ill health through much of the 1850s, but Bonner's contract guaranteed her income regardless of any periods of inactivity brought on by poor health. This arrangement remained intact for 30 years. Like her friend Harriet Beecher Stowe, she was a supporter of social change and women's rights, but she was not nearly as active on these issues. Her first novel, Retribution, a serial for the National Era, published in book form in 1849, was so well received that she gave up teaching and became a regular contributor to various periodicals, especially the New York Ledger. She lived in Georgetown, D.C., until 1876, then in Yonkers, New York, and again in Georgetown, where she died on June 8, 1899. Her best known work was The Hidden Hand. It first appeared in serial form in the New York Ledger in 1859, and was serialized twice more (1868‚Äì69, 1883) before first appearing in book form in 1888. Bonner used the appeal of the novel to \\"give an occasional boost to his weekly's already massive circulation.\\" It features Capitola Black, a tomboyish protagonist that finds herself in a myriad of adventures. Southworth stated that nearly every adventure of her heroine came from real life. Most of Southworth's novels deal with the Southern United States during the post-American Civil War era. She wrote over sixty; some of them were translated into German, French, Chinese, Icelandic and Spanish; in 1872 an edition of thirty-five volumes was published in Philadelphia. Bonner was asked by a reporter in 1889 \\"Who were your most successful story writers?\\" His reply was: \\"Mrs. Southworth and Sylvanus Cobb Jr. I think that the most popular and successful stories ever printed as serials were Cobb‚Äôs 'The Gunmaker of Moscow' and Mrs. Southworth‚Äôs 'Hidden Hand.' \\" Her novel Tried for Her Life was referenced in chapter 8 of Jack Finney's novel Time and Again. Southworth is buried in Washington's Oak Hill Cemetery. Bibliography note ‚Äì most of Southworth's novels were serialized before their publications, sometimes under different titles. *Retribution; or The Vale of Shadows: A Tale of Passion (1849) *The Deserted Wife (1850) *The Mother-in-Law; or The Isle of Rays / Married In Haste (1851) *Shannondale / The Three Beauties (1851) *Virginia and Magdalene; or The Foster Sisters / Two Sisters (1852) *The Discarded Daughter; or the Children of the Ilse: A Tale of the Chesapeake (1852) *The Curse of Clifton (1852) *Old Neighborhoods and New Settlements; or Christmas Evening Legends (1853) *The Lost Heiress (1854) *The Wife's Victory and Other Nouvellettes (1854) *The Missing Bride; or, Miriam the Avenger (1855) *The Widow's Son / Left Alone (1856) *India: The Pearl of Pearl River (1856) *Vivia; or The Secret of Power (1857) *The Two Sisters (1858) *The Lady of the Isle; or, The Island Princess (1859) *The Haunted Homestead and Other Nouvellettes (1860) *The Gipsy's Prophecy: A Tale of Real Life / The Bride Of An Evening (1861) *Hickory Hall; or The Outcast: A Romance of the Blue Ridge / The Prince Of Darkness (1861) *The Broken Engagement; or, Speaking theTruth for a Day (1862) *Love's Labor Won (1862) *The Fatal Marriage / Orville Deville (1863) *The Bridal Eve / Rose Elmer (1864) *Allworth Abbey / Eudora (1865) *The Bride of Llewellyn (1866) *The Fortune Seeker; or, The Bridal Day (1866) *The Coral Lady; or The Bronzed Beauty of Paris (1867) *Fair Play; or The Test of the Lone Isle (1868) *How He Won Her: A Sequel to Fair Play (1869) * The Changed Brides / Winning Her Way (1869) *The Brides Fate: A Sequel to \\"The Changed Brides\\" (1869) *The Family Doom; or The Sin of a Countess (1869) *The Maiden Widow: A Sequel to the \\"Family Doom\\" (1870) *The Christmas Guest; or The Crime and the Curse (1870) *Cruel as the Grave / Hallow Eve Mystery (1871) *Tried for Her Life (1871) *The Lost Heir of Linlithgow / The Brothers (1872) *The Noble Lord: The Sequel to \\"The Lost Heir of Linlithgow (1872) *A Beautiful Fiend; or, Through the Fire (1873) *Victor's Triumphs: The Sequel to \\"A Beautiful Fiend\\" (1874) *Mystery of Dark Hollow (1875) *Ishmael; or, In the Depths (1876) *Self-Raised; or, From the Depths: A Sequel to \\"Ishmael.\\" (1876) *The Red Hill Tragedy: A Novel (1877) *The Bride's Ordeal: A Novel (1877) *Her Love or Her Life: A Sequel to \\"The Bride's Ordeal: A Novel (1877) *Sybil Brotherton: A Novel (1879) *The Trail of the Serpent; or, The Homicide at Hawke Hall (1880) *Why Did He Wed Her?

In typical laboratory operation, such as distillation, the condenser is clamped to a retort stands in vertical or oblique orientation. The hot vapor of some liquid is introduced at the upper end of the inner tube, and condenses in contact with its colder walls. Water (or some other fluid) is constantly circulated in the jacket to carry away the heat of vaporization released by the condensing vapor, keeping the tube below the liquid's boiling point. The condensed liquid drips out of the lower end of the inner tube. The Liebig condenser can also be used in reflux or Soxhlet extraction operations, although other condenser types are better suited to those tasks. In this usage, the condenser is held vertically above the recipient with the boiling liquid. The vapor is admitted to the inner tube through the lower end, and the condensed liquid drips back through the same opening, while the upper end of the tube is usually left open to the atmosphere. History This type of condenser is named after the German chemist Justus Baron von Liebig, even though he only perfected and popularized it.Jensen, William B. (2006) \\"The origins of the Liebig condenser,\\" Journal of Chemical Education, 83 : 23.Kahlbaum, Georg W. A. (1896) \\"Der sogenannte Liebig'sche K√ºhlapparat\\" (The so-called Liebig condenser), Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft, 29 : 69‚Äì71.Speter, Max (1908) \\"Geschichte der Erfindung des \\"Liebig'schen K√ºhlapparat\\" (The history of the invention of the \\"Liebig\\" condenser), Chemiker Zeitung, 32 (1) : 3‚Äì5.Schelenz, Hermann, Zur Geschichte der Pharmazeutisch-Chemischen Destilliergerate [On the history of pharmaceutical [and] chemical distillation apparatuses], (Berlin, Germany: Julius Springer, 1911), pp. 84-88. The earliest water-cooled laboratory condenser was invented in 1771 by the Swedish-German chemist Christian Weigel (1748‚Äì1831).Christian Ehrenfried Weigel (1771), Observationes chemicae et mineralogicale G√∂ttingen (in Latin). The condenser's construction is explained on pp. 8‚Äì9 and in a footnote on page 11; the illustration is Fig. 2 on the last page of the book. Weigel‚Äôs condenser consisted of two coaxial tin tubes, which were joined at their lower ends, forming a water jacket, and open at their upper ends. Cold water entered the jacket via an inlet at the bottom, and spilled out of the jacket‚Äôs open upper end. A glass tube carrying vapors from a distillation flask passed through the inner tin tube. Weigel subsequently replaced the inner tin tube with a glass tube, and he devised a clamp to hold the condenser.Christian Ehrenfried Weigel (1773) Observationes chemicae et mineralogicae, Pars Secunda. Greifswald, Germany. (in Latin) See: pp. 41 ff (Observatio II. Methodus Refrigerandi Nova, Obs. Prior. I. Tradita, ad Tubelos Vitreos Applicata.) and Figure 1. However, an anonymous pamphlet published in 1781 claimed that a countercurrent condenser had been conceived in 1770 and tested in 1773.Anonymous: Nouvelle Construction d'Alambic pour faire toute sorte de distillation en grand, ... (New construction of a retort in order to do every sort of distillation on a large scale, ... ). A handwritten note on the title page of a copy that was in the collection of the state library of Cassel, Germany, states: \\"par Jean-Hyacinthe de Magellan\\" ([written] by Joao Hyacinth de Magellan). Joao Magellan (1723‚Äì1790) was a Portuguese friar and scientist who settled in London. On p. 5 of the pamphlet, the Pr√©face stated: \\"La premi√®re id√©e de la Machine distillatoire dont il sera question dans cet Ecrit, remote √† l'ann√©e 1770. Il en fut d'abord ex√©cut√© diff√©rens mod√®les en petit, & notamment un dans le mois de Janvier 1773 ; enfin, peu de temps apr√®s, par les ordres de M. de Boynes, alors Ministre de la Marine, la Machine fut ex√©cut√©e √† Paris en grand, ... \\" (The first idea of a distillation device that is the subject of this work, arose in the year 1770. Different models were executed at first on a small scale, and in particular one in the month of January 1773 ; at last, shortly afterwards, at the order of Mr. de Boynes, then Minister of the Navy, the device was executed in Paris on a large scale, ... ) Illustrations in the pamphlet show a retort to which a tube was fitted. The tube carried the retort's vapors through a rectangular box, which acted as a condenser and in which cold water flowed from the condenser's lower end to its upper end‚Äîa counter-current condenser. In 1794, the German pharmacist Johann Friedrich August G√∂ttling (1753‚Äì1809), who was a former student of Weigel, improved the design by sealing both ends of the water jacket. J. F. G√∂ttling, \\"Beschreibung einer sehr bequemen K√ºhlanstalt bey Destillationenen aus der Blase\\" (Description of a very convenient cooling apparatus [for use] during distillations from retorts), Taschenbuch f√ºr Scheidek√ºnstler und Apotheker (Pocket book for [chemical] analysts and apothecaries), 15th ed. (Weimar, (Germany): Hoffmannische Buchhandlung [Hoffmann's bookstore], 1794), pp. 129‚Äì135. In 1778, in what seems to be an independent invention, Finnish pharmacist Jakob Gadolin (1719‚Äì1802) proposed condensers for use in distilleries and in laboratories, consisted of a metal jacket which surrounded the discharge tube from a distillation vessel and through which a countercurrent of cold water flowed.Gadolin, Jakob (1778) \\"F√∂rslag at f√∂b√§ttra Br√§nnerie-slangen\\" (Proposal for an improved distillery hose [i.e., condenser]), Kungliga Vetenskaps Akademiens Handlingar (Proceedings of the Royal Academy of Sciences), 39 : 283‚Äì289.

[German translation] Also independently of Weigel, Pierre-Isaac Poissonnier (1720‚Äì1798), a physician to king Louis XV of France, published in 1779 a design of a still for producing fresh water from seawater aboard a ship.P. I. Poisonnier (1779), Appareil distillatoire pr√©sent√© au Ministre de la Marine; Paris. The apparatus consisted of a retort for boiling the seawater, a tube extending from the retort through a rectangular box filled with flowing cold water, fed by a separate tank.Dujardin. Jules (1900): [https://books.google.com/books?id=JTINAAAAYAAJ&pg;=PA170#v=onepage&q;&f;=falseRecherches r√©trospectives sur l'art de la distillation: (Paris, self-published); Fig. 8, pages 169‚Äì170. Liebig himself incorrectly attributed the design to G√∂ttling.The Origin of the Liebig Condenser Jensen, William B. J. Chem. Educ. 2006 83 23. Abstract. Liebig replaced the outer metal wall of Weigel‚Äôs condenser by a glass tube, and used rubber hoses, instead of metal tubes, to convey water to and from the condenser.Liebig, Justus von; Poggendorff, J.C.; W√∂hler, Fr., ed.s, Handw√∂rterbuch der reinen und angewandten Chemie [Dictionary of pure and applied chemistry], vol. 2 (Braunschweig, (Germany): Friedrich Vieweg und Sohn, 1842), article: \\"Destillation,\\" pp. 526‚Äì554. On p. 532, Fig. 29, a condenser is shown in which the inner glass tube containing the hot vapors from the distilling flask is now in direct contact with the cooling water in the condenser's jacket. Fig. 30 on p. 533 shows a condenser with a glass (not metal) jacket, for distilling small batches of material. Design Two modern Liebig condensers, with ground glass joints. The modern design consists of two concentric straight glass tubes, the inner one being longer and protruding at both extreminites. The ends of the outer tube are sealed (usually by a blown glass ring seal), forming a water jacket, and is fitted with side ports near the ends for cooling fluid inflow and outflow. The ends of the inner tube, that carries the vapor and condensed liquid, are open; they are often fitted with ground glass joints for secure and airtight connection to other equipment. Efficiency Compared to the simple air- cooled tube condenser of a retort or the head of an alembic, the Liebig condenser is more efficient at removing the heat of condensation and at maintaining a stable low temperature on the condensation surface.

It offers further and higher education programmes, including postgraduate and PhD awards. The College has retained single degree options within Fine Art, offering specialist Bachelor of Arts courses in painting, sculpture, photography and drawing. The College also runs graduate and postgraduate courses in art conservation and fine art as well as design courses such as graphic design, illustration and 3D design. History The College's history is closely linked with that of the South London Gallery, with which the College shares its site.History of SLG The manager of the South London Working Men's College in 1868, William Rossiter, purchased the freehold of Portland House on which the College now stands in 1889. The resulting Gallery opened in 1891, followed by the Technical Institute, the school's first guise in 1898. The philanthropist, John Passmore Edwards, gave a substantial sum of money for the erection of the building in memory of Lord Leighton. The architect was Maurice Bingham Adams.archiseek.com Maurice Bingham Adams The school and gallery were the fruition of an artistic movement in Camberwell, supported by Edward Burne-Jones, Lord Leighton, Walter Crane and G F Watts. The school aimed to give the 'best artistic and technical education to all classes in the district'. Originally, the school offered classes in specific trades, such as architecture, cabinet design, embroidery, wood carving, wood block and stencil cutting. By 1920, a Fine Art Department had been created. During World War II, Victor Pasmore was appointed head of the school's Painting Department.Victor Pasmore biography , Victorpasmore.com He brought in William Coldstream, who in turn brought in Joe Dixon from the Royal College of Art and Claude Rogers. These three eminent Euston Road School painters, whose own work was figurative, initiated an exciting period for the School. Many well-known artists, including Frank Auerbach,Tom Phillips biography Lawrence Gowing and Edward Ardizzone taught at Camberwell during this period. The prominent painter Robert Medley was Head of Painting in the early 1960s. Ron Kitaj, Kenneth Martin, Patrick Procktor, Euan Uglow, Frank Bowling and David Hepher all taught at the School during the 1960s and 70s. During this period, the School had a thriving art history department, headed by Conal Shields, that employed painters such as Harold Cohen and academics, including T. J. Clark. In 1973, the School expanded into a modern purpose- built block next to the existing premises. Both of them are now Listed Buildings. The College is currently undergoing a major ¬£62 million redevelopment, working with Stephen Marshall Architects. In the 1980s, Wendy Smith became the head of Fine Art and employed Noel Forster, John Hilliard, Cornelia Parker, Phyllida Barlow, Gavin Jantjes and Ian McKeever. Tony Messenger and Eileen Hogan took charge of the graphics department, Eileen Hogan established and ran The Camberwell Press, and Eric Ayers presided over the typography school. Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts became a constituent College of the London Institute in 1986, formed by the Inner London Education Authority to associate London's art, design, fashion and media schools into a collegiate structure. The school was renamed Camberwell College of Arts in 1989. During this restructuring Camberwell temporarily lost its Fine Art courses but by the time the London Institute was granted University status and was renamed University of the Arts London in 2004, the department had been fully restored to the College. Well-known artists who have taught at Camberwell include Richard Slee, Matt Franks,sculpture BA course Information Brian Griffiths, Saskia Olde Wolbers, Fran Cottell, Rebecca Fortnum, Kelly Chorpening, Patricia Ellis, Anna Mossman, David Cross of Cornford & Cross, James Edgar, Daniel Sturgis, Rupert Norfolk, Duncan Wooldridge, Bernd Behr, Jordan McKenzie, Anne-marie Creamer, Danny Treacy and Hew Locke. In 2014 the American academic Hal Foster was appointed as 'Practitioner in Residence' within the Fine Art Department, In 2016 Griselda Pollock assumed this title.  Research  Research projects at the college relate to a number of ongoing theoretical and practical debates in areas such as the interface of new technologies and creative practice; transnational art, identity and nation, and the conservation of Byzantine books and manuscripts. Camberwell is part of the University of the Arts London and its Research Network (RNUAL), which also includes Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, Chelsea College of Art and Design, London College of Communication and London College of Fashion. Camberwell has also had a number of prominent artists acting as researchers and lecturers such as the painters Humphrey Ocean and John Keane and the ceramicist Julian Stair. With strong links to the local community, Camberwell has a purpose built community art and exhibition space, \\"Peckham Space\\" designed by PENSON in Peckham Square. This project commission \\"new multimedia, location-specific projects connecting art, people and place through creative experience\\". Camberwell also oversees in partnership with the Arts Council of England the current scholarly research into John Latham, whose local residence \\"Flat Time House\\" has recently been turned into a museum. Affiliations Camberwell is part of the University of the Arts London, and together with its sister colleges Chelsea College of Art and Design and Wimbledon College of Art makes up CCW, a three college model that allows each college to retain its own individual identity while allowing students access to teaching and learning facilities across the three colleges. CCW combined their foundation courses from the academic year starting in September 2011, and bases them at the Wilson Road campus in Camberwell. Other colleges of the University are Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, London College of Communication and London College of Fashion. Internationally, the College has links to other European art schools and Universities, and students regularly take part on ERASMUS educational exchanges to institutions in cities such as Marseille, Leipzig, Milan and Madrid. Further afield the college has links with colleges in Japan and the United States, with students taking part in projects at New York Studio School, Parsons The New School for Design New York, FIT NY and Yale School of Art. Peckham Platform Peckham Platform is a purpose-built public gallery dedicated to commissioning location-specific artworks made in partnership with community groups. Originally known as Peckham Space and part of Camberwell College of Arts, University of the Arts London, in 2013 it became an independent charity. It seeks to encourage progression routes for young people into creative higher education as well as to increase access to cultural and educational activity in Peckham. Peckham Space is funded by the Higher Education Innovation Fund (HEIF), Southwark Council and Arts Council England. The permanent venue on Peckham Square, designed by PENSON, opened in June 2010.

Explicitly, for an operator T there is base of neighborhoods of the following type: choose a finite number of vectors x_i, continuous functionals y_i, and positive real constants \\\\varepsilon_i indexed by the same finite set I. An operator S lies in the neighborhood if and only if  y_i(T(x_i) - S(x_i)) < \\\\varepsilon_i for all i \\\\in I. Equivalently, a net T_i \\\\subset B(H) of bounded operators converges to T \\\\in B(H) in WOT if for all y \\\\in H^* and x \\\\in H, the net y(T_i x) converges to y(T x).  Relationship with other topologies on B(H)  The WOT is the weakest among all common topologies on B(H), the bounded operators on a Hilbert space H.  Strong operator topology  The strong operator topology, or SOT, on B(H) is the topology of pointwise convergence. Because the inner product is a continuous function, the SOT is stronger than WOT. The following example shows that this inclusion is strict. Let H = \\\\ell^2(\\\\mathbb N) and consider the sequence {T^n} of unilateral shifts. An application of Cauchy-Schwarz shows that T^n \\\\to 0 in WOT. But clearly T^n does not converge to 0 in SOT. The linear functionals on the set of bounded operators on a Hilbert space that are continuous in the strong operator topology are precisely those that are continuous in the WOT (actually, the WOT is the weakest operator topology that leaves continuous all strongly continuous linear functionals on the set B(H) of bounded operators on the Hilbert space H). Because of this fact, the closure of a convex set of operators in the WOT is the same as the closure of that set in the SOT. It follows from the polarization identity that a net {T_\\\\alpha} converges to 0 in SOT if and only if T_\\\\alpha^* T_\\\\alpha \\\\to 0 in WOT.  Weak-star operator topology The predual of B(H) is the trace class operators C1(H), and it generates the w*-topology on B(H), called the weak-star operator topology or œÉ-weak topology. The weak-operator and œÉ-weak topologies agree on norm-bounded sets in B(H). A net {TŒ±} ‚äÇ B(H) converges to T in WOT if and only Tr(TŒ±F) converges to Tr(TF) for all finite-rank operator F. Since every finite-rank operator is trace-class, this implies that WOT is weaker than the œÉ-weak topology. To see why the claim is true, recall that every finite-rank operator F is a finite sum : F = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\lambda_i u_i v_i^*. So {TŒ±} converges to T in WOT means : \\\\text{Tr} \\\\left ( T_{\\\\alpha} F \\\\right ) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\lambda_i v_i^* \\\\left ( T_{\\\\alpha} u_i \\\\right ) \\\\longrightarrow \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\lambda_i v_i^* \\\\left ( T u_i \\\\right ) = \\\\text{Tr} (TF). Extending slightly, one can say that the weak-operator and œÉ-weak topologies agree on norm-bounded sets in B(H): Every trace-class operator is of the form : S = \\\\sum_i \\\\lambda_i u_i v_i^*, where the series \\\\sum olimits_i \\\\lambda_i converges. Suppose \\\\sup olimits_{\\\\alpha} \\\\T_{\\\\alpha} \\\\ = k < \\\\infty, and T_{\\\\alpha} \\\\to T in WOT. For every trace-class S, : \\\\text{Tr} \\\\left ( T_{\\\\alpha} S \\\\right ) = \\\\sum_i \\\\lambda_i v_i^* \\\\left ( T_{\\\\alpha} u_i \\\\right ) \\\\longrightarrow \\\\sum_i \\\\lambda_i v_i^* \\\\left ( T u_i \\\\right ) = \\\\text{Tr} (TS), by invoking, for instance, the dominated convergence theorem. Therefore every norm-bounded set is compact in WOT, by the Banach‚ÄìAlaoglu theorem.  Other properties  The adjoint operation T ‚Üí T*, as an immediate consequence of its definition, is continuous in WOT. Multiplication is not jointly continuous in WOT: again let T be the unilateral shift. Appealing to Cauchy- Schwarz, one has that both Tn and T*n converges to 0 in WOT. But T*nTn is the identity operator for all n. (Because WOT coincides with the œÉ-weak topology on bounded sets, multiplication is not jointly continuous in the œÉ-weak topology.) However, a weaker claim can be made: multiplication is separately continuous in WOT. If a net Ti ‚Üí T in WOT, then STi ‚Üí ST and TiS ‚Üí TS in WOT.  SOT and WOT on B(X,Y) when X and Y are normed spaces  We can extend the definitions of SOT and WOT to the more general setting where X and Y are normed spaces and B(X,Y) is the space of bounded linear operators of the form T:X\\\\to Y. In this case, each pair x\\\\in X and y^*\\\\in Y^* defines a seminorm cdot\\\\_{x,y^*} on B(X,Y) via the rule \\\\T\\\\_{x,y^*}=y^*(Tx). The resulting family of seminorms generates the weak operator topology on B(X,Y). Equivalently, the WOT on B(X,Y) is formed by taking for basic open neighborhoods those sets of the form :N(T,F,\\\\Lambda,\\\\epsilon):= \\\\left {S\\\\in B(X,Y): \\\\left y^*((S-T)x) \\\\right <\\\\epsilon,x\\\\in F,y^*\\\\in\\\\Lambda \\\\right }, where T\\\\in B(X,Y), F\\\\subset X is a finite set, \\\\Lambda\\\\subset Y^* is also a finite set, and \\\\epsilon>0. The space B(X,Y) is a locally convex topological vector space when endowed with the WOT. The strong operator topology on B(X,Y) is generated by the family of seminorms cdot\\\\_x, x\\\\in X, via the rules \\\\T\\\\_x=\\\\Tx\\\\. Thus, a topological base for the SOT is given by open neighborhoods of the form :N(T,F,\\\\epsilon):={S\\\\in B(X,Y):\\\\(S-T)x\\\\<\\\\epsilon,x\\\\in F}, where as before T\\\\in B(X,Y), F\\\\subset X is a finite set, and \\\\epsilon>0.  Relationships between different topologies on B(X,Y)  The different terminology for the various topologies on B(X,Y) can sometimes be confusing. For instance, \\"strong convergence\\" for vectors in a normed space sometimes refers to norm-convergence, which is very often distinct from (and stronger than) than SOT-convergence when the normed space in question is B(X,Y). The weak topology on a normed space X is the coarsest topology that makes the linear functionals in X^* continuous; when we take B(X,Y) in place of X, the weak topology can be very different than the weak operator topology. And while the WOT is formally weaker than the SOT, the SOT is weaker than the operator norm topology. In general, the following inclusions hold: :{ \\\\text{WOT-open sets in } B(X,Y)} \\\\subset {\\\\text{SOT- open sets in }B(X,Y)} \\\\subset {\\\\text{operator-norm-open sets in }B(X,Y)}, and these inclusions may or may not be strict depending on the choices of X and Y. The WOT on B(X,Y) is a formally weaker topology than the SOT, but they nevertheless share some important properties. For example, :(B(X,Y),\\\\text{SOT})^*=(B(X,Y),\\\\text{WOT})^*. Consequently, if S \\\\subset B(X,Y) is convex then :\\\\overline{S}^\\\\text{SOT}=\\\\overline{S}^\\\\text{WOT}, in other words, SOT-closure and WOT-closure coincide for convex sets.

Equivalently, it is the coarsest topology such that, for each fixed x in H, the evaluation map (T,x)\\\\mapsto Tx (taking values in H) is continuous in T. The equivalence of these two definitions can be seen by observing that a subbase for both topologies is given by the sets U(T_0,x,\\\\epsilon)={T:\\\\Tx-T_0x\\\\<\\\\epsilon} (where T0 is any bounded operator on H, x is any vector and Œµ is any positive real number).

The SOT is stronger than the weak operator topology and weaker than the norm topology. The SOT lacks some of the nicer properties that the weak operator topology has, but being stronger, things are sometimes easier to prove in this topology. It can be viewed as more natural, too, since it is simply the topology of pointwise convergence. The SOT topology also provides the framework for the measurable functional calculus, just as the norm topology does for the continuous functional calculus. The linear functionals on the set of bounded operators on a Hilbert space that are continuous in the SOT are precisely those continuous in the WOT. Because of this, the closure of a convex set of operators in the WOT is the same as the closure of that set in the SOT. This language translates into convergence properties of Hilbert space operators. For a complex Hilbert space, it is easy to verify by the polarization identity, that Strong Operator convergence implies Weak Operator convergence.

It produces good yields and is known for deep color, full body, low tannins and high levels of acidity.J. Robinson (ed) The Oxford Companion to Wine Third Edition pg 62-63 Oxford University Press 2006 Century-old vines still exist in many regional vineyards and allow for the production of long-aging, robust red wines with intense fruit and enhanced tannic content. The best known appellation is the DOCG (Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita) Barbera d'Asti in the Piedmont region: the highest-quality Nizza DOCG wines are produced within a sub-zone of the Barbera d'Asti production area. When young, the wines offer a very intense aroma of fresh red cherries and blackberries. In the lightest versions notes of cherries, raspberries and blueberries and with notes of blackberry and black cherries in wines made of more ripe grapes. Many producers employ the use of toasted oak barrels, which provides for increased complexity, aging potential, and hints of vanilla notes. The lightest versions are generally known for flavors and aromas of fresh fruit and dried fruits, and are not recommended for cellaring. Wines with better balance between acid and fruit, often with the addition of oak and having a high alcohol content are more capable of cellaring; these wines often result from reduced-yield viticultural methods.Robinson, Jancis Vines, Grapes & Wines pg 145-147 Mitchell Beazley 1986 History An 18th-century engraving of the city of Casal Monferrato in whose cathedral archive the earliest known planting of Barbera is documented Barbera is believed to have originated in the hills of Monferrato in central Piemonte, Italy, where it has been known from the thirteenth century. Documents from the cathedral of Casale Monferrato between 1246 and 1277 detail leasing agreements of vineyard lands planted with \\"de bonis vitibus barbexinis\\" or Barbera, as it was known then. However, one ampelographer, Pierre Viala, speculates that Barbera originated in the Lombardy region of Oltrep√≤ Pavese. In the 19th and 20th centuries, waves of Italian immigrants brought Barbera to the Americas where the vine took root in California and Argentina among other places. Recent DNA evidence suggest that Barbera may be related to the French-Spanish vine Mourvedre.Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes p. 41 Harcourt Books 2001 In 1985, the Piedmont region was rocked by a scandal involving Barbera producers illegally adding methanol to their wines,F. Ziliani \\"Barbera Renaissance in Piemonte\\" Wine Business Monthly, December 1, 2003 killing over 30 people and causing many more to lose their sight. The bad press and publicity saw a steady decline in Barbera sales and plantings, allowing the grape to be eclipsed by the Montepulciano grape as Italy's second most widely planted red grape variety in the late 1990s. Viticulture The Barbera vine is very vigorous and capable of producing high yields if not kept in check by pruning and other methods. Excessive yields can diminish the fruit quality in the grape and accentuate Barbera's natural acidity and sharpness. In Piedmont, the vine was prized for its yields and ability to ripen two weeks earlier than Nebbiolo even on vineyard sites with less than ideal exposure. This allowed the Piedmontese winemakers in regions like Alba to give their best sites over to the more difficult to cultivate Nebbiolo and still produce quality wine with Barbera that could be consumed earlier while the Nebbiolo ages. Harvest for Barbera usually takes place in late September-early October, usually two weeks after Dolcetto has been picked. In recent times, winemakers have been experimenting with harvesting Barbera later at higher sugar levels to produce heavier, more fruit forward wines. In some vintages, these producers may even harvest their Barbera after Nebbiolo. Barbera can adapt to a wide range of vineyard soils but tends to thrive most in less fertile calcareous soils and clay loam. Sandy soils can help limit the vigor and yields. The grape rarely thrives in very alkaline or saline soils. Like many grape varieties with a long history, the Barbera vine has seen mutation and clonal variation arise with different clones of the variety found in Piedmont, Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and the Mezzogiorno. The different clones can be identified by the size and shape of their grape clusters with the smaller cluster clones producing the highest quality wine. In recent years, viticulturalists have been working with clonal selection to increase Barbera's resistance to the leafroll virus. Winemaking A Barbera d'Alba from Piedmont Winemakers working with Barbera have a variety of ways to deal with the grape's high acidity and moderate astringency. The most common has been through blending with varieties lacking those components and creating a softer and potentially more balanced wine as a result. In the 1970s, the French enologist Emile Peynaud recommended that Barbera producers use small oak barrels for fermentation and maturation in order to add subtle oak spice flavors and limited levels of oxygenation to soften the wine. The added oxygen would also limit the reductive quality of Barbera and the occurrence of off-odors of hydrogen sulfide that would occur in some examples. The polysaccharides picked up from the oak, was found to increase the richness of Barbera. At the time, his recommendation met some resistance from the tradition minded Barbera producers, but the success of the \\"Super Tuscans\\" which introduced new oak barrel treatment to Sangiovese caused many producers to reconsider. In addition to the subtle oxygenation and spice notes, oak imparts to the wine ligneous wood tannins which give structure to the wine without adding as much astringent bite as the tannins derived from the phenolic compounds of the grape. This, coupled with reduced maceration time, contributed to the production of softer wines. Lower yields and harvesting riper grapes with more fruit and sugar has been found to be a better balance for Barbera's high acidity. Wine regions Barbera wine from Piedmont region Northwest Italy is the viticultural home for Barbera, but Italian immigrants spread it through much of the New World, where its acidity is valued in blended wines for the 'freshness' it imparts. Barbera is found in the northwestern part of Italy, particularly in Monferrato, and to a lesser extent further south. Nearly half of all grape vine plantings in Piedmont are Barbera. It likes the same conditions as Nebbiolo, but the latter is more profitable, fetching nearly twice, so is grown on the best sites. The earlier- ripening Barbera is grown on the cooler lower slopes below the Nebbiolo, and other secondary locations. This explains why relatively little Barbera is grown around Alba, where the wines are entitled to the appellation Barbera d'Alba. Thus the best known Barbera is the DOCG of Barbera d'Asti. The Barbera del Monferrato DOC ‚Äì which tends to be somewhat sparkling (frizzante) ‚Äì is seldom exported. Italy A landscape in Monferrato As of 2010 there were of Barbera planted, making it the sixth most widely planted red grape variety in Italy. At its highpoint in the late 20th century, there were over planted but fallout from the \\"Methanol scandal\\" of the 1980s and the lack of a driving worldwide market caused those numbers to decline. In the Piedmont region Barbera is widely grown in Asti and Monferrato regions. While there is no officially defined Classico region, like Chianti Classico, the region of the Asti province between the towns of Nizza Monferrato, Vinchio, Castelnuovo Calcea, Agliano, Belveglio and Rocchetta is considered among locals to be the \\"heart\\" of Barbera in Piedmont. In 2001, the town of Nizza was officially recognized as a sub-region within the greater Barbera d'Asti DOC. Being one of the warmest areas in Asti, Nizza has the potential to produce the ripest Barbera with sugar levels to match some of the grape's high acidity. The wines of Barbera d'Asti tend to be bright in color and elegant while Barbera d'Alba tend to have a deep color with more intense, powerful fruit. In the Alba region many of the best vineyard sites are dedicated to Nebbiolo with Barbera relegated to secondary location, which limits the quality and quantities of the wines labeled with the Barbera d'Alba DOC. In the Monferrato DOC, Barbera is blended with up to 15% Freisa, Grignolino and Dolcetto and can be slightly sparkling. A Cabernet Sauvignon/Barbera blend from the Langhe DOC in Piedmont. Outside Piedmont, Barbera is found throughout Italy, often as a component in mass vino da tavola blends. In the Lombardy region, it is seen as a varietal in Oltrep√≤ Pavese with wines that range from slightly spritzy to semi- sparkling frizzante. Elsewhere in Lombardy it is blended with Croatina and as part of a larger blend component in the red wines of Franciacorta. Southeast of Piedmont, Barbera is found in Emilia-Romagna in the hills between Piacenza, Bologna and Parma. As in Lombardy, Barbera is often softened by blending with the lighter Croatina as it is in the Val Tidone region for the DOC wine of Gutturnio. In Sardinia, the grape is used around Cagliari in the wine known as Barbera Sarda and in Sicily, the grape is used in various blends under the names Perricone or Pignatello made near Agrigento. Barbera was an important grape in re-establishing the wine industry of the Apulia and Campania regions following World War II due to its high yields and easy adaption to mechanical harvesting. Today it is a permitted variety to be blended with Aglianico in the Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) wine of Taurasi though it is rarely used. Outside Italy Although Barbera plantings of over existed as of 2010 outside Italy, it is rarely found in Europe except for small plantings in Greece, Romania, and the coastal region of Primorska in Slovenia. The influence of Italian immigrants has led to a scattering of Barbera plantings in South America, notably in Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay. In Argentina, it is widely grown with planted as of 2010, mostly in the Mendoza and San Juan provinces, and used mostly for blending. There are some small plantings in Israel. Barbera came to Australia with cuttings imported from the University of California, Davis in the 1960s, and as of 2010 accounted for of planting land. It has been grown for about 25 years in the Mudgee region of New South Wales, with later plantings in a number of wine regions, including the King Valley in Victoria as well as the McLaren Vale and the Adelaide Hills regions in South Australia. John Gladstones, in his book Viticulture and Environment, includes Barbera in maturity group 5, which means that it will ripen at about the same time as Shiraz and Merlot, and that it should theoretically find a successful home in many Australian wine regions.Higgs, Darby, Emerging Varietal Wines of Australia, Booksurge, 2005 Australian wine producers have found some success with Barbera in Victoria. Mount Broke Wines of Broke, is one of the few in New South Wales, Australia. South African producers have begun widespread plantings of the grape in the warm climate regions of Malmesbury, Wellington and Paarl. In the United States there are of plantings mostly in California, where Barbera is one of the most successful of the Piemontese grapes to be adopted in the state. It is widely planted in the Central Valley, where it is a blend component in mass-produced jug wines. In recent years, the fashion of Italian grapes has caused more California winemakers to look into producing high quality varietal Barbera. Plantings in the cooler regions of Napa and Sonoma have produced some successful examples. In Washington State, producers have been experimenting with plantings of Barbera in the Red Mountain, Walla Walla, and Columbia Valley AVAs. So far these very young vines have produced fruity wines with strawberry notes and limited complexity and aging potential.P. Gregutt Washington Wines and Wineries: The Essential Guide p. 62 University of California Press 2007 In addition to Washington, in the Umpqua AVA of Oregon plantings of Barbara are proving successful, as well as plantings in central and southern Arizona.Amaranth Ridge, Oakland, Oregon Wines As with many grapes that are widely planted, there is a wide range of quality and variety of Barbera wines from medium bodied, fruity wines to more powerful, intense examples that need cellaring. Some characteristics of the variety are more consistent‚Äînamely its deep ruby color, pink rim, pronounced acidity and normally rather modest levels of tannins. The acidity of Barbera make it a valued plantings in warm climate regions where acidification is usually needed. The color of Barbera makes it a value blending grape and it was historically used in the Barolo & Barberesco region to add color to the naturally light Nebbiolo grape. The use of oak for fermentation or maturation can have a pronounced influence of the flavor and profile of Barbera. Barrel- influenced Barberas tend to be rounder and richer, with more plum and spice notes. Wines made with older or more-neutral oak tend to retain more vibrant aromas and cherry notes. While some producers delay harvest in order to increase sugar levels as a balance to Barbera's acidity, over-ripeness can lead to raisiny flavors. Relationship to other grapes Grape breeder Giovanni Dalmasso at the Instituto Sperimentale per la Viticoltura in Conegliano in the Veneto wine region used Barbera as one of the parent vines for many of his crosses. Along with Nebbiolo di Dronero (originally thought to be Nebbiolo but later discovered to be an old French wine grape known as Chatus), Dalmasso crossed Barbera to produce Albarossa, Cornarea, Nebbiera, San Michele and Soperga.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 24, 87-88, 333, 471, 729 and 852 Allen Lane 2012 Barbera is also a parent variety behind Ervi (crossed with Croatina), Incrocio Terezi I (with Cabernet franc), Nigra (with Merlot) and Prodest (also with Merlot). Despite similarities in names Barbera has no close genetic relationship with the Campanian wine grape Barbera del Sannio or the Sardinian wine grape Barbera Sarda. Also, DNA analysis has shown that the white Piedmont variety Barbera bianca is a not a color mutation of Barbera but rather its own distinct variety. Synonyms Barbera is known under a variety of local synonyms through Italy and worldwide. These include Barber a Raspo, Barbera a Peduncolo, Barbera Amaro, Barbera Crna, Barbera Forte, Barbera Mercantile, Barbera Nera, Barbera Nostrana, Barbera Riccia, Barbera Rissa, Barbera Rosa, Barbera Vera, Barberone, Barbexinis, Besgano, Cosses Barbusen, Gaietto, Lombardesca, Perricone, Pignatello and Ughetta.

Comprising six 25-minute episodes, the two linked three-part stories tell the adventures of three teenagers and their battle to save their school and their classmates from the actions of the sinister Mr Eldritch. It was the first television drama to be written by Russell T Davies, and is also noteworthy for co-starring a young Kate Winslet in her first major television role. Background Russell T Davies was a BBC staff producer working for the children's department at BBC Manchester, running the summertime activity show Why Don't You?. He had gained some television writing experience scripting the comedy dubbed version of The Flashing Blade for the Saturday morning children's programme On the Waterfront in 1989 and the children's sketch show Breakfast Serials the following year, but his real ambition was to write television drama. To this end, he wrote an on-spec script for the first episode of Dark Season ‚Äì originally titled The Adventuresome Three ‚Äì and used the BBC's internal mail system to send it directly to the Head of Children's Programmes, Anna Home. Impressed with the script, Home asked Davies to write a second episode. When Tony Robinson decided to take a break from producing Maid Marian and Her Merry Men, a slot opened up in the Children's BBC schedules for late 1991 and Home decided to use Dark Season to fill it, commissioning Davies to write the remaining episodes of the serial. The series was filmed in Mytchett in Surrey, in Farnborough Hants (Woburn Avenue) and the long-closed Robert Haining Secondary School, in the summer of 1991. Studio material was shot at the BBC's Ealing Studios. Transmitted at 4.35 pm on Thursdays from 14 November to 19 December 1991, each episode would be repeated the Sunday morning following first broadcast. Viewing figures varied from 3.6 to 4.2 million per episode. Davies also penned a novelisation of Dark Season for BBC Books, which was released concurrently with the transmission of the serial and was advertised after each episode. He would later go on to write a second children's science-fiction serial for the BBC, Century Falls, in 1993, before forging a long and successful career in adult television drama. Dark Season was re-shown on BBC One in 1994, and in 2002 was also repeated on the CBBC Channel on digital television, cropped to 14:9 widescreen with the loss of the top and bottom sections of the original picture. Dark Season was released on DVD by 2entertain Ltd on 24 July 2006. Upon this release, it received a British Board of Film Classification rating of PG. Plot The first three episodes begin with third year secondary school girl Marcie and her two fifth year friends Tom and Reet becoming suspicious of the sinister Mr Eldritch, whose computer company arrives at the school and distributes free computers to all the pupils. With the reluctant help of their teacher Miss Maitland they apparently defeat the threat of Eldritch, who disappears. However, the second three episodes tell of the actions of Miss Pendragon, who works for Eldritch and is attempting to revive the massive, secret Behemoth computer from its long-hidden location beneath the school. At the end of the BBC novelisation, there are indications that Davies had ideas or interest in a potential third adventure using the same characters. A single paragraph describing the opening of an amusement arcade concludes with \\"...but that's another story.\\" Structure The programme is a defining example of the British television serial. The episodes were merely numbered, all sharing a gradually-revealed common plot. To a degree, the six episodes may be divided into two stories of three episodes each. The apparent conclusion of the first story at episode 3 seemed so complete to BBC executives that they were, according to Davies, \\"a bit shocked\\". This, in part, stemmed from the fact that he had not sold the programme to them as two three-part stories‚Äî\\"in case they told me not to do it!\\".http://www.centuryfalls.co.uk Q&A; section at centuryfalls.co.uk Nevertheless, by the conclusion of episode 6, it becomes apparent to the viewer that all six episodes tell a conjoined story of Marcie's opposition to Mr. Eldritch, though split across two seemingly unrelated tales. Both incidents occur at least in the same school year, but perhaps over an even shorter period of time. Commonality with Doctor Who Dark Season contained some similarity to Doctor Who, which Russell T Davies revived in 2005. Most notably, Marcie occupies a similar narrative space to the Doctor, with Reet and Thomas as her companions. Nevertheless, this broad structural similarity to Doctor Who has been categorically denied by Russell T Davies as intentional. 2001 interview with RTD about Dark Season and Century Falls Davies has claimed that the only direct reference to so-called \\"classic\\" Doctor Who is a scene in which Reet uses a yo-yo to test gravity.https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/classic/darkseason/interview.shtml BBC Cult interview with RTD. The Doctor Who story referred to is \\"The Ark In Space\\" Nevertheless, elements from this production have been seen in Doctor Who fiction which post-dates Dark Season. The earliest reference was a direct mention of Marcie in Davies' 1996 Doctor Who ‚Äì The New Adventures novel Damaged Goods. Later, when Doctor Who was again being produced on television, Davies trapped Rose Tyler behind a door that refused to open In \\"The End of the World\\" ‚Äî just as he had done with Reet in Episode Six of Dark Season. When challenged by their rescuers not to go anywhere, both characters offered the same response: \\"Where am I gonna go, Ipswich?\\". Dark Season would again be recalled in 2006, when the similarity between the setting of Dark Season and the 2006 episode \\"School Reunion\\" received frequent attention.Scott's Place review of \\"School Reunion\\"IMDB's Movie Connections for \\"School Reunion\\" Though Davies did not write the script for \\"School Reunion\\", he requested its relocation from an army base to a school, evocative of Dark Season. By far the strongest links between the serials are found in Davies' 2008 Christmas special, \\"The Next Doctor\\", which recycles elements of the 'Behemoth' in the 'CyberKing'. In both \\"Dark Season\\" and \\"The Next Doctor\\", the lead female villains are tricked into enthronement & entrapment inside a monster of their own making, which they accept as their destiny, but this leads to their downfall. Cast and crew The director assigned to Dark Season was Colin Cant, who had a long and highly esteemed reputation in producing BBC children's programmes, having for many years produced the popular school-based teen drama Grange Hill throughout the 1980s and directed classic children's serials such as Moondial (1988). The three stars were 19-year-old Victoria Lambert as the 13-year-old Marcie, Ben Chandler as Tom and Kate Winslet, in her first major professional acting role, as Reet. There were several supporting actors who were well-known names on British television: Miss Maitland was played by Brigit Forsyth who had starred in the popular sitcom Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads? in the 1970s, and Miss Pendragon was played by Jacqueline Pearce, who was well known for her role as the villainous Servalan in the late 1970s / early 80s BBC science-fiction series Blake's 7, and known by Cant from working with her on the serial Moondial. According to an interview with SFX magazine, Davies said that Pearce was delighted that her character was supposed to be a lesbian, but refused to dye her hair, hence the turban. Reception The show has received increased critical attention following both its release on DVD and Davies' announcement of his new programme aimed at the same target audience, The Sarah Jane Adventures. Television Heaven's review concluded by saying, \\"By turns amusing, aware, suspenseful, exciting and imaginative, 'Dark Season' stands as an almost criminally overlooked example of children's genre television of the highest quality, and also as an early indication of a future major creative talent in the form of Russell T Davies taking his first steps on the long and winding creative road to a glittering future.\\"Hulse, Stephen R. \\"Dark Season\\". 2004.

Viewers cited general enthusiasm for the acting of the regular child actors, and praised the presence of generally strong ideas, but were disappointed by some of the adult actors. Jacqueline Pearce was a particularly divisive influence for the group, with one describing her as someone he \\"can watch open an envelope\\", another taking \\"guilty pleasure\\" at her \\"high camp\\", and the third failing to \\"see the point of Jacqueline Pearce\\".

Historically in Hampshire, but today in Dorset, it is located to the east of Bournemouth town centre and west of Southbourne. Originally a sparsely inhabited area of heathland, from around 1865 Boscombe developed rapidly from a small village into a seaside resort alongside Bournemouth. Its first pier opened in 1889. There are numerous architectural styles within the town, ranging from the elaborate Victorian style of the Royal Arcade, notable examples of Art Deco such as the former Gas & Water Company store at 709 Christchurch Road, and the modernist 1950s styles of the pier and Overstrand buildings. Alongside these are modern flats developments such as The Reef, The Point and Honeycombe Beach. Geography and administration The area upon which Boscombe is situated, between the somewhat older village of Pokesdown and Bournemouth Square, was part of the great heathland which covered much of western Hampshire, and extended well into eastern Dorset. From Norman times it was within the Liberty of Westover. From the beach and cliffs the whole of Poole Bay stretching from Hengistbury Head in the east to Poole Harbour entrance in the west, and on to Studland and Swanage bays to the south can be seen. Boscombe was originally an independent settlement, separated from Bournemouth by dense wood and moorland, it was incorporated into the boundaries of Bournemouth in 1876 (against the wishes of Boscombe residents). History In 1273 a reference is made to \\"Boscumbe\\" suggesting that the name may well have derived from the Old English words meaning a 'valley overgrown with spiky plants' perhaps a reference to gorse. Reference to Boscombe is included in Christopher Saxton's 1574 survey made of possible enemy landing places on the coast of Hampshire; this mentions... This refers to the manufacture of copperas or ferrous sulphate which took place in the district, particularly in the last quarter of the 16th century. At the beginning of the 19th century, Boscombe was described as an extensive common covered with furze and heath, more the haunt of smugglers than anyone else. One of the early landmarks was the 'Ragged Cat', a wayside inn dating from 1850, later renamed the 'Palmerston' and then 'Deacons', it was renamed back to 'The Ragged Cat' in 2009 before being closed down. In 2015 a Polish market was opened in this historical building. Boscombe Manor In 1801 a modestly-sized house called Boscombe Cottage was built as the residence of Mr Phillip Norris. The Christchurch Inclosures Act 1802 increased the estate size to . This property became the nucleus of the Boscombe Manor Estate. The large estate owned by Mr Norris changed hands several times during the first half of the 19th century. After Norris's death it was acquired by Robert Heathcote, and on his death the estate was put up for auction The estate was purchased by James Dover, in whose possession it remained until 1841; then it was sold to Major Stephenson. Stevenson sold the estate in 1849 to Sir Percy Florence Shelley who bought the Boscombe property mainly with the intention of it becoming a home for his mother Mary Shelley, but she died in London on 1 February 1851. Sir Percy and his wife liked the place, and decided to make it their home, dividing their time between Boscombe and their London house at Chelsea. The house at Boscombe was extensively rebuilt for Sir Percy, and extended to include a 200-seat (later 300 seats) theatre, to the designs of Christopher Crabb Creeke, who later became surveyor to the Bournemouth Improvement Commissioners and was responsible for both the layout of much of central Bournemouth's roads, and for several local buildings. It may be noted that the name of Boscombe Manor changed several times over the years. First recorded as Boscombe Cottage, it was then for a time called Boscombe Alcove and then Boscombe Lodge. By Shelley's time it was Boscombe House, and he and his family later renamed it Boscombe Manor. In the present century it was Groveley Manor for many years, taking the name of the school which then occupied it, but now it is known as Shelley Park, most of the building being taken up by the Shelley Manor Medical Centre in Beechwood Avenue. To supplement the existing plantations of pine trees on the estate, Sir Percy added a large number of deciduous trees. There was a drive to the house from the main Christchurch Road, which followed the line of the present Chessel Avenue, and there was a lodge at its entrance. A second entry was from Sea Road, along a roadway flanked with lime trees ‚Äì the present Percy Road. By the beginning of the 1860s Boscombe consisted of the Shelley estate and some cottages, one of which is known to have stood at the top of Boscombe Hill, near the present Drummond Road. From 1865 the development and expansion of the area to the end of the 19th century, and beyond, was very rapid. Starting with a proposal by the Malmesbury Estate to develop the 'picturesque Village of Boscombe Spa' to make available building plots for the erection of marine villas to be let on long leases. The Spa was related to a natural spring of mineral water containing properties similar to Harrogate which had been discovered near the foot of the hill; this would be available for invalids and could combine the advantages of a Spa with those of sea air and bathing. The scheme was not implemented; instead about of land was obtained by Sir Henry Drummond Wolff, on part of which he built a house for himself named Boscombe Towers, in 1868, Sir Henry became closely associated with the development of Boscombe Spa for a considerable number of years. Wolff sought to develop 'Boscombe Spa' as a resort to rival Bournemouth and it was he who created the Boscombe Chine Gardens. In order to encourage the taking of the mineral water from the spring at the mouth of the Chine, a small thatched-roof building resembling a summer house was erected over the spring, and for a time this became a fashionable meeting place. The Chine itself was partially laid out and a broad pathway provided. A rustic bridge was constructed across the Chine. The census of 1871 showed that there was a population of 212 people in 19 houses in the Boscombe Estate, and a further 70 people in 9 houses at Boscombe Spa. During the 1870s development of Boscombe was such that the population at the census of 1881 had grown to 1,895 ‚Äì a more than sixfold increase. Expansion In 1875 a 160,000 gallon water tower was built in Palmerston Road, at this time it was stated that there were 244 houses in Boscombe. In February 1877 the Royal Boscombe Hospital (later called the Royal Victoria Hospital) opened in Shelley Road, it initially had beds for 12 patients. In 1880 Boscombe Land Society was formed purchasing 13 acres of land in November of the following year. This was in the area of the present Knole Road, there were initially 73 plots. Much of the Shelley property in the area to the east of Sea Road was developed in the next ten years amounting to a further 70 plots. In 1883 Pokesdown station opened on the LSWR Brockenhurst to Bournemouth line. In 1889 Boscombe Pier opened (see below). The commercial centre of Boscombe had a major boost with projects by Archibald Beckett including blocks of shops, the Salisbury Hotel, the Royal Arcade, and a Grand Theatre, which was to become Boscombe Hippodrome, then the Royal Ballrooms and today the O2 Academy. These were all built between 1888 and 1895, shortly after opening in 1892 the Royal Arcade was lit by electricity. On 29 May 1897 Boscombe railway station was opened. On 19 August 1893 the Burlington Hotel opened; it was designed in an Italian Renaissance style and had 200 bedrooms. By the turn of the century the remainder of the Shelley estate had been sold, Boscombe Chine gardens had been laid out and there was little remaining vacant land within Boscombe. Before her death in June 1899 Lady Shelley had gifted four acres of land which were laid out to form Boscombe Cliff Gardens. In the 1901 census the population was 9,648. 20th century St John the Evangelist's parish church, designed by John Oldrid Scott and CT Miles and built in 1893‚Äì95 The coronation of King Edward VII and his Queen, Alexandra of Denmark was scheduled to take place on 26 June 1902. to mark the occasion, Bournemouth Council agreed on 20 May 1902 to rename common No 59 as \\"King's Park\\". Boscombe thrived with the growth of the English seaside holiday. Between the wars Boscombe was one of Bournemouth's wealthiest areas with many large Victorian and Edwardian family houses. In 1935 construction started on the San Remo Towers block, located between Sea Road and Michelgrove Road, the Grade II listed block of 164 flats was designed by Hector Hamilton, in a Los Angeles Spanish style. Post war there was a boom in the seaside holiday market and Boscombe with its large number of smaller guest houses enjoyed this period of prosperity. In 1965 Boscombe railway station closed. It was in the 1970s and 1980s with the decline in the traditional English holiday market that Boscombe's fortunes began to wane. Many of the small guest houses and large family houses became HMOs, Boscombe saw an increase in social problems during this period with drug and alcohol dependency levels well above the national average. In 1990 in an attempt to revitalize the shopping centre Christchurch Road between Palmerston Road and Ashley Road was pedestrianized and the Sovereign shopping centre opened. In 1993 the Royal Victoria Hospital was largely demolished. A replacement hospital, the Royal Bournemouth Hospital, was opened in Castle Lane in 1989. Present day A man buying a copy of the Big Issue from magazine vendor in Boscombe precinct View near the entrance to the pier, looking towards the beach in the direction of Southbourne New development of the area around Boscombe was approved under the Boscombe Spa Development Plan in July 2006. This project was intended to turn the seafront into a spa village complete with artificial surf created by Boscombe Surf Reef. Completed in autumn 2009, the reef was constructed as part of the restoration work that also included the Overstrand buildings. Reports on the reef's performance showed that it was failing to meet its performance criteria. In 2011, the reef was closed for safety reasons; in 2012 the contractor went out of business and in 2014 the reef was re-branded as a Coastal Activity Park. Funding for the development had been through the sale of the local seafront car park, to Barratt Homes for 169 seafront apartments, at Honeycombe Chine. As well as these flats there have been a number of other large developments of flats such as \\"The Reef\\" in Boscombe Spa Road and the renovation of Shelley Park into a medical centre and flats development. In May 2007, for the first time, a property in Boscombe sold for ¬£1 million. The property was a flat with views of the coast, and was the main headline in the Bournemouth Daily Echo. Boscombe gardens underwent a renovation project and was substantially remodelled; a public art trail was also installed around Boscombe as part of the renovation project. The nickname Bos Vegas has gained popularity in recent years and occurs with slight spelling variation in the names of two Boscombe businesses. Boscombe is home to AFC Bournemouth, which play at Dean Court. Many fans still refer to AFC Bournemouth as Boscombe, a reference to the original names of Boscombe St John's and Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic FC (the word Boscombe was dropped in 1972). There is a thriving street market in the High Street on Thursdays and Saturdays as well as a vintage market on the first Saturday of every month. Schools In the 1870s a small school attached to St Clement's Church was too small to meet the growing demand and Boscombe British school was established by Mr Frederick Moser and Sir Percy Florence Shelley who laid the foundation stone in 1878. The school opened in 1879. The Christchurch Times reported that the building was \\"to be one of the most ornamental as well as useful buildings in Boscombe.\\"About Us The school was built in a Neo-Gothic style in Gladstone Road and later when transferred to the local authority was renamed St. John's Church of England Primary School. The senior section of the school moved in 1940 to the newly built Boscombe Bilateral Secondary Modern(now King‚Äôs Park Primary) on Ashley Road. In 1960,a local teacher Leslie Williams formed the 'Bournemouth Children's Theatre' in the old school buildings and it became the Drama Centre. Dame Sybil Thorndike became the patron of the centre and visited frequently. During the 1980s the Drama Centre was renamed the Bournemouth Centre for Community Arts (BCCA) to reflect its extension into other arts. When it became known as the Bournemouth Centre for Community Arts (BCCA), Gareth Malone attended later going on to be known as the Choirmaster on BBC televised programmes. When it was closed in 2007, under threat of demolition Friends of the BCCA contacted English Heritage to save the building; it was Grade II listed by English Heritage in 2008 particularly in reference to the Gothic design and in the larger schoolroom with its complicated roof. In June 2012, despite 938 objections, and claims the Planning Board had been \\"misled\\", planning permission was obtained to restore the listed rooms, to build 11 affordable homes for local people (10 houses and 1 accessible bungalow), a community orchard and allotments. leaving only three rooms for a \\"creative hub\\". A \\"soft demolition\\" began of the BCCA in September, 2013, with the main demolition commencing in October, 2013. A New Orleans mock funeral was held by protesters hoping to stop the demolition. The Religious of the Cross operated a Roman Catholic boarding and day convent school for girls, and later also a boys' preparatory school, built at 13, Parkwood Road in 1889.Paton's List of Schools and Tutors, J. & J.

Boscombe Spa Boscombe Chine, the ravine breaking through the sandy cliffs, comprised several small valleys draining the land around Boscombe. Several of these originated in Springbourne, but they all eventually confluenced near to Christchurch Road. The southern end of the chine was laid out as pleasure gardens with a surface water stream as a picturesque feature. Towards the foot of the Chine, near to Sea Road, a chalybeate spring was discovered, no doubt fed by the water draining into the chine. A small thatched hut was erected over the spring and was given the name Boscombe Spa. The water was sufficiently foul-tasting that people would make a special trip to drink the water for any health-giving properties that it may contain. Boscombe Pier Boscombe Pier in 2003 The pier in 2010, after restoration Musical walkway installed in 2014 A pier was proposed in 1884 as a visitor attraction. In September 1888 the contract for its building was awarded for ¬£3,813, and for making the pier approach ¬£938. The pier was long, and built in spans of each with a continuous wrought iron girder frame, which carried timber decking wide. The pier head was long and wide, with a landing stage on each side, at which excursion steamers could call. At the entrance were two toll houses with turnstiles. The architect for the pier construction was James Stuart Campbell McEwan-Brown (1870‚Äì1949). His family were originally from Kintyre, Argyll and were closely connected to the Duke of Argyll. It is no surprise therefore, that it was opened with considerable ceremony on 29 July 1889 by the Duke of Argyll. The pier head was not added until 1926, and like most piers it was partially demolished during World War II to combat the threat of invasion. The pier remained derelict for a number of years and was only fully reopened in 1962. The borough architect, John Burton, designed the modernist 1950s style entrance building. This building was Grade II listed in 2004, The heritage minister said: The building at the pier end was initially reopened as the Mermaid Theatre and then a roller skating rink before becoming an amusement arcade. It closed in 1989 and the pier became progressively more derelict over the next 19 years. On 30 October 2005 the pier was closed as it was deemed unsafe. The Grade II listed pier entrance building was externally restored in 2007 together with a restoration of the pier neck. New decking, lighting and central windbreak screen was added together with a new viewing and fishing platform end section, replacing the derelict Mermaid Amusement Hall. The pier re-opened in May 2008. To the east of the pier is Europe's first artificial surf reef. Since the re- opening of the pier in 2008 a Friends Association has been established, organising art exhibitions and live music performances.Inspieration Friends of Boscombe Pier In 2009 website Nothing To See Here named it Britain‚Äôs coolest with the National Piers Society voting it Pier of the Year 2010. In 2014, a musical walkway was added to the pier, featuring 88 custom-made chimes that play ‚ÄòI Do Like To be Beside the Seaside‚Äô when struck in the correct order. The outdoor musical installation includes tubular bells, a bell lyre and tembos. The pier also has its own dedicated angling club, The Boscombe Pier Sea Anglers, founded in 2002 for out of hours fishing.

History Originating in the Mennonite movement, they were subsequently influenced by Radical Pietism, which found its way into the Mennonite colonies of the southern Russian Empire now known as Ukraine. Mennonite immigrants from West Prussia who had been influenced by pietistic leaders transplanted those ideas to the large Molotschna colony. The pastor of a neighboring congregation, Eduard W√ºst, reinforced this pietism. W√ºst was a revivalist who stressed repentance and Christ as a personal savior, influencing Catholics, Lutherans and Mennonites in the area. He associated with many Mennonite leaders, including Leonhard Sudermann. In 1859, Joseph H√∂ttmann, a former associate of W√ºst met with a group of Mennonites to discuss problems within the main Mennonite body. Their discussion centered on participating in communion with church members who were living in a way that seemed unholy or were not converted, and baptism of adults by immersion. On January 6, 1860, this growing group of Mennonites influenced by a combination of Prussian Mennonite pietism, contacts with Moravian Brethren and indirectly through the influential preaching of Eduard W√ºst, met in the village of Elisabeththal, Molotschna and formed the Mennonite Brethren Church. They felt the Mennonites had grown cold and formal, and were seeking greater emphasis on discipline, prayer and Bible study. The group presented a document to the elders of the Molotschna Mennonite Churches which indicated \\"that the total Mennonite brotherhood has decayed to the extent that we can no more be part of it\\" and fear the \\"approach of an unavoidable judgment of God.\\"Smith, p. 280. The immediate catalyst for the new organization was the discipline placed on a body of brethren who met to observe communion in a private home without the elders' sanction. The Mennonite Brethren were also in contact with and influenced by German Baptists J. G. Oncken and August Liebig. The Mennonite Brethren movement spread throughout the Mennonite colonies and produced many distinguished leaders, particularly in Molotschna. These include P. M. Friesen (educator and historian), Jakob and Abraham Kroeker (writers), Heinrich Braun (publisher), Peter Braun (educator) and A. H. Unruh (educator).Smith, p. 281. Jakob Kroeker (1872‚Äì1948) was one of the most prolific Mennonite writers, completing a fourteen volume Old Testament commentary. By breaking religious and cultural patterns that had become a hindrance to Mennonite society, the contribution of the Mennonite Brethren allowed all Mennonite groups in Russia to pursue a more wholesome Christian life.Smith, pp. 281‚Äì282. The Mennonite Brethren movement also spread through missionary endeavor. They commissioned the first missionaries to travel from Southern Russia (Ukraine) to India in 1887, establishing congregations in the Hyderabad, Telangana State, region. In the ensuing years, Mennonite Brethren churches have been established in SE Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America. Because of growing pressure by the Czarist government and later because of the political turmoil of the Russian Revolution, significant numbers of the Mennonite Brethren moved to the United States, Canada, Paraguay, Brazil and Mexico. In the Soviet Union their organizational structures ceased to exist by 1930 due to Communist persecution. At that time some remaining Mennonite Brethren moved from Ukraine to the republics of the Soviet Central Asia. After World War II several Mennonite Brethren churches emerged in that region. In 1966 they joined the Evangelical-Baptist Union‚Äîan umbrella organization tightly controlled by the Soviet government. Status Currently (2017 statistics), there are Mennonite Brethren congregations in more than 20 countries representing close to 500,000 believers. The largest conferences are the Conference of the Mennonite Brethren Churches in India, with a reported 212,000 members in 992 congregations, the Communaut√© des Eglises de Fr√®res Mennonites au Congo, with 102,082 members in 554 congregations, and Khmu Mission with churches located in Thailand and Laos, numbering 42,000 members in 354 congregations. The 248 congregations with 36,276 members in Canada, and 193 congregations with 31,200 members in the United States round out the top 5 conferences world-wide.

These communities are Orthodox and collectively made up 73% of the district's Christian population while the remaining 28% of the population were Muslim Albanians. Overall the Greek community was the most numerous ethno-religious group (40%), while Albanians, irrespective of religious background, in 1992 were a plurality and collectively consisted 49% of the district's total population. Within Gjirokast√´r district, Greeks populate all the settlements of both former municipalities of Dropull i Sip√´rm and Dropull i Posht√´m and also all settlements of Pogon municipality (except the village of Selck√´).Hammond, Nicholas Geoffrey Lempri√®re (1967).

The Martin B-26 Marauder is an American twin-engined medium bomber that saw extensive service during World War II. The B-26 was built at two locations: Baltimore, Maryland, and Omaha, Nebraska, by the Glenn L. Martin Company. First used in the Pacific Theater of World War II in early 1942, it was also used in the Mediterranean Theater and in Western Europe. After entering service with the United States Army aviation units, the aircraft quickly received the reputation of a \\"widowmaker\\" due to the early models' high accident rate during takeoffs and landings. This was due to the fact that the Marauder had to be flown at precise airspeeds, particularly on final runway approach or when one engine was out. The unusually high 150 mph (241 km/h) speed on short final runway approach was intimidating to many pilots who were used to much slower approach speeds, and whenever they slowed to speeds below those stipulated in the manual, the aircraft would often stall and crash.Ethell 1995, p. 242. The B-26 became a safer aircraft once crews were re-trained, and after aerodynamics modifications (an increase of wingspan and wing angle-of- incidence to give better takeoff performance, and a larger vertical stabilizer and rudder).Ethell 1995, pp. 242‚Äì243. The Marauder ended World War II with the lowest loss rate of any USAAF bomber.Ethell 1995, p. 243. A total of 5,288 were produced between February 1941 and March 1945; 522 of these were flown by the Royal Air Force and the South African Air Force. By the time the United States Air Force was created as an independent military service separate from the United States Army in 1947, all Martin B-26s had been retired from U.S. service. After the Marauder was retired the unrelated Douglas A-26 Invader then assumed the \\"B-26\\" designation which led to confusion between the two aircraft. Design and development In March 1939, the United States Army Air Corps issued Circular Proposal 39-640, a specification for a twin-engined medium bomber with a maximum speed of , a range of and a bomb load of . On 5 July 1939, the Glenn L. Martin Company submitted its design, produced by a team led by Peyton M. Magruder, to meet the requirement, the Martin Model 179. Martin's design was evaluated as superior to the other proposals and was awarded a contract for 201 aircraft, to be designated B-26.Air International January 1988, p. 23. The B-26 went from paper concept to an operational bomber in approximately two years.Trent 2008, p. 647. Additional orders for a further 930 B-26s followed in September 1940, still prior to the first flight of the type.Air International January 1988, p. 25. Closeup view of a Martin B-26B Marauder in flight The B-26 was a shoulder-winged monoplane of all-metal construction, fitted with a tricycle landing gear. It had a streamlined, circular section fuselage housing the crew, consisting of a bombardier in the nose, armed with a machine gun, a pilot and co-pilot sitting side by side, with positions for the radio operator and navigator behind the pilots. A gunner manned a dorsal turret armed with two machine guns (the first powered dorsal turret to be fitted to a U.S. bomber), and an additional machine gun was fitted in the tail. Two bomb bays were fitted mid-fuselage, capable of carrying of bombs, although in practice such a bomb load reduced range too much, and the aft bomb bay was usually fitted with additional fuel tanks instead of bombs. The aircraft was powered by two Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp radial engines in nacelles slung under the wing, driving four- bladed propellers. The engines were manufactured at the Ford Dearborn Engine plant in Dearborn, Michigan, USA. The wings were of low aspect ratio and relatively small in area for an aircraft of its weight, giving the required high performance, but also resulting in a wing loading of for the initial versions, which at the time was the highest of any aircraft accepted for service by the Army Air Corps, until the introduction of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, with the then-astonishing wing loading of (although both would be considered lightly loaded by the standard of combat aircraft of the next decade).Air International January 1988, pp. 23‚Äì25. The first B-26, with Martin test pilot William K. \\"Ken\\" Ebel at the controls, flew on 25 November 1940 and was effectively the prototype. Deliveries to the U.S. Army Air Corps began in February 1941 with the second aircraft, 40-1362. In March 1941, the Army Air Corps started Accelerated Service Testing of the B-26 at Patterson Field, near Dayton, Ohio. Accidents The B-26's relatively small wing area and resulting high wing loading required a high landing speed of indicated airspeed depending on load. At least two of the earliest B-26s suffered hard landings and damage to the main landing gear, engine mounts, propellers and fuselage. The type was grounded briefly in April 1941Mendenhall; lack of entries on Forms 5A to investigate the landing difficulties. Two causes were found: insufficient landing speed (producing a stall) and improper weight distribution. The latter was due to the lack of a dorsal turret; the Martin power turret was not yet ready. Some of the very earliest B-26s suffered collapses of the nose landing gear. It is said that they were caused by improper weight distribution, but that is not likely to have been the only reason. The incidents occurred during low-speed taxiing, takeoffs and landings, and occasionally the strut unlocked. Later the Martin electric dorsal turret was retrofitted to some of the first B-26s. Martin also began testing a taller vertical stabilizer and revised tail gunner's position in 1941. The Pratt & Whitney R-2800-5 engines were reliable, but the Curtiss electric pitch change mechanism in the propellers required impeccable maintenance, not always attainable in the field. Human error and some failures of the mechanism occasionally placed the propeller blades in flat pitch resulting in an overspeeding propeller, sometimes known as a \\"runaway prop\\". Due to its sound and the possibility that the propeller blades could disintegrate, this situation was particularly frightening for aircrews. More challenging was a loss of power in one engine during takeoff. These and other malfunctions, as well as human error, claimed a number of aircraft and the commanding officer of the 22nd Bombardment Group, Colonel Mark Lewis. The Martin B-26 suffered only two fatal accidents during its first year of flight, from November 1940 to November 1941: a crash shortly after takeoff near Martin's Middle River plant in Maryland (cause unknown, but engine malfunction strongly suggested) and the loss of a 38th Bombardment Group B-26 when its vertical stabilizer and rudder separated from the aircraft at altitude (cause unknown, but the accident report discussed the possibility that a canopy hatch broke off and struck the vertical stabilizer). As pilots were trained quickly for the war, relatively inexperienced pilots entered the cockpit and the accident rate increased. This occurred at the same time as more experienced B-26 pilots of the 22nd, 38th and 42nd Bombardment Groups were proving the merits of the bomber. For a time in 1942, pilots in training believed that the B-26 could not be flown on one engine. This was disproved by several experienced pilots, including Colonel Jimmy Doolittle, who flew demonstration flights at MacDill Army Air Field, which featured take offs and landings with only one engine. Also, seventeen Women Airforce Service Pilots were trained to demonstrate the B-26, in an attempt to \\"shame\\" male pilots into the air.WASPs Receive Final Instructions Before Flying Martin B-26 Marauder In 1942, aviation pioneer and company founder Glenn L. Martin was called before the Senate Special Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program, (or also known as the \\"Truman Committee\\"), which was investigating defense contracting abuses. Senator Harry S Truman of Missouri, the committee chairman (and future Vice President and 33rd President of the United States in 1945-1952), asked Martin why the B-26 had problems. Martin responded that the wings were too short. Senator Truman curtly asked why the wings had not been changed. When Martin replied that the plans were too close to completion, and his company already had the contract, Truman's testy response was quick and to the point: In that case, the contract would be canceled. Martin corrected the wings.McCullough 2003, p. 319. (By February 1943, the newest model aircraft, the B-26B-10, had an additional of wingspan, plus uprated engines, more armor and larger guns.)\\"Martin Aircraft Specifications: B-26 Marauder Types.\\" The Glenn L.

Apart from accidents occurring over land, 13 Marauders ditched in Tampa Bay in the 14 months between 5 August 1942 and 8 October 1943. B-26 crews gave the aircraft the nickname \\"Widowmaker\\". Other colorful nicknames included \\"Martin Murderer\\", \\"Flying Coffin\\", \\"B-Dash-Crash\\", \\"Flying Prostitute\\" (so-named because it was so fast and had \\"no visible means of support,\\" referring to its small wings) and \\"Baltimore Whore\\" (a reference to the city where Martin was based).Higham, Roy and Carol Williams, eds. Flying Combat Aircraft of USAAF‚ÄìUSAF (Vol. 1). Andrews AFB, MD: Air Force Historical Foundation, 1975. . According to an article in the April 2009 edition of AOPA Pilot on Kermit Weeks' \\"Fantasy of Flight\\", the Marauder had a tendency to \\"hunt\\" in yaw. This instability is similar to \\"Dutch roll\\". This would make for a very uncomfortable ride, especially for the tail gunner. The B-26 is stated by the 9th Air Force to have had the lowest combat loss rate of any US aircraft used during the war. Nevertheless, it remained a challenging aircraft to fly and continued to be unpopular with some pilots throughout its military career. In 1944, in answer to many pilots complaining to the press and their relatives back home, the USAAF and Martin took the unusual step during war, of commissioning large articles to be placed in various popular publications, \\"educating\\" and defending the so-called flying/accident record of the B-26 against \\"slanders\\". One of the largest of these articles was in the May 1944 issue of Popular Mechanics.\\"They Said It Was Too 'Hot' To Fly.\\" Popular Mechanics, May 1944. Operational history Royal Air Force B-26 flying over Banja Luka during World War II The B-26 Marauder was used mostly in Europe, but also saw action in the Mediterranean and the Pacific.

The B-26 was initially deployed on combat missions in the South West Pacific in early 1942, but most of the B-26s subsequently assigned to operational theaters were sent to England and the Mediterranean area. By the end of World War II, it had flown more than 110,000 sorties, dropped 150,000 tons (136,078 tonnes) of bombs and had been used in combat by British, Free French and South African forces in addition to US units.

Pacific Theater The B-26 began to equip the 22nd Bombardment Group at Langley Field, Virginia, in February 1941, replacing the Douglas B-18 Bolo, with a further two groups, the 38th and 28th, beginning to equip with the B-26 by December 1941.Air International February 1988, p. 75. Immediately following the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor, the 22nd BG was deployed to the South West Pacific,Donald 1995, p. 76.Swanborough and Bowers 1963, p. 335. first by ship to Hawaii, then its air echelon flew the planes to Australia. The 22nd BG flew its first combat mission, an attack on Rabaul which required an intermediate stop at Port Moresby, New Guinea, on 5 April 1942. Susie Q, a B-26 torpedo bomber of the 18th Reconnaissance Squadron, as flown during the Battle of Midway on 4 June 1942 A second group, the 38th, began receiving B-26s in November 1941 and began transitioning into them at Patterson Field, Ohio. There, the 38th continued the testing of the B-26, including its range and fuel efficiency. Immediately after the entry of the United States into World War II, plans were tentatively developed to send the 38th BG to the South West Pacific and to equip it with B-26Bs fitted with more auxiliary fuel tanks and provisions for carrying aerial torpedoes. Three 38th BG B-26BsLetters from Maj. James F. Collins 1984‚Äì86. were detached to Midway Island in the buildup to the Battle of Midway, and two of them, along with two B-26s detached from the 22nd BG, carried out torpedo attacks against the Japanese Fleet on 4 June 1942. Two were shot down and the other two were so badly damaged that they were written off after the mission. Their torpedoes failed to hit any Japanese ships, although they did shoot down one Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter and killed two seamen aboard the aircraft carrier Akagi with machine-gun fire.Parshall and Tulley 2005, pp. 151‚Äì153. Notably, one of them, Susie Q, after dropping its single torpedo and searching for a safer escape route, flew directly down the length of the Akagi while being fired upon by fighters and anti-aircraft fire, which had to hold their fire to avoid hitting their own flagship. Another, after being seriously damaged by anti-aircraft fire, didn‚Äôt pull out of its run, and instead headed directly for Akagis bridge. The aircraft, either attempting a suicide ramming, or out of control due to battle damage or a wounded or killed pilot, narrowly missed crashing into the carrier's bridge, before it cartwheeled into the sea.Parshall and Tully, pp. 151‚Äì152; Lundstrom, p. 337 From approximately June 1942, B-26 squadrons of the 38th BG were based in New Caledonia and Fiji. From New Caledonia, missions were flown against Japanese bases in the Solomon Islands. On one occasion, a B-26 was credited with shooting down a Kawanishi H6K flying boat. In 1943, it was decided that the B-26 would be phased out of operations in the South West Pacific Theater in favor of the North American B-25 Mitchell. Nevertheless, the 19th Bombardment Squadron of the 22nd BG continued to fly missions in the B-26. The B-26 flew its last combat mission in the theater on 9 January 1944. Two more squadrons of torpedo armed B-26s equipped the 28th Composite Group and were used for anti-shipping operations in the Aleutian Islands Campaign, but there are no records of any successful torpedo attack by a USAAF B-26. Comedian George Gobel famously joked about being an instructor for this aircraft at Frederick Army Airfield (now Frederick Regional Airport) during the Pacific battles, boasting that \\"not one Japanese aircraft got past Tulsa\\". Mediterranean Theater Three Bombardment Groups were allocated to support the Allied invasion of French North Africa in November 1942. They were initially used to carry out low-level attacks against heavily defended targets, incurring heavy losses with poor results, before switching to medium level attacks. By the end of the North African Campaign, the three B-26 groups had flown 1,587 sorties, losing 80 aircraft. This was double the loss rate of the B-25, which also flew 70% more sorties with fewer aircraft.Air International February 1988, pp. 76‚Äì77. Despite this, the B-26 continued in service with the Twelfth Air Force, supporting the Allied advance through Sicily, Italy and southern France.Donald 1995, p. 177.Swanborough and Bowers 1963, p. 338. Air Marshal Sir John Slessor, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean Allied Air Forces, wrote of \\"the astonishing accuracy of the experienced medium bomber groups ‚Äì particularly the Marauders; I think that the 42nd Bombardment Group in Sardinia is probably the best day-bomber unit in the world.\\"Slessor 1957, p. 572. Slessor in fact meant the 42nd Bomb Wing‚Äî17th, 319th and 320th Bomb Groups‚Äîbut a US 'wing' equated roughly to a British 'group', and vice versa.

The B-26 entered service with the Eighth Air Force in England in early 1943, with the 322nd Bombardment Group flying its first missions in May 1943. Operations were similar to those flown in North Africa with B-26s flying at low level and were unsuccessful. The second mission, an unescorted attack on a power station at IJmuiden, Netherlands, resulted in the loss of the entire attacking force of 11 B-26s to anti-aircraft fire and Luftwaffe Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighters.Air International February 1988, p. 77. Following this disaster, the UK-based B-26 force was switched to medium altitude operations, and transferred to the Ninth Air Force, set up to support the planned invasion of France. Bombing from medium altitudes of and with appropriate fighter escort, the Marauder proved far more successful, striking against a variety of targets, including bridges and V-1 launching sites in the buildup to D-Day, and moving to bases in France as they became available. The Marauder, operating from medium altitude, proved to be a highly accurate aircraft, with the 9th Air Force rating it the most accurate bomber available in the final month of the war in Europe.Air International February 1988, pp. 78‚Äì79. Loss rates were far lower than in the early, low-level days, with the B-26 stated by the 9th Air Force as having the lowest loss rate in the European Theater of Operations at less than 0.5%. The B-26 flew its last combat missions against the German garrison at the √éle d'Ol√©ron on 1 May 1945, with the last units disbanding in early 1946.Air International February 1988, p. 79.

Like the earlier Martin Maryland and Baltimore, these aircraft were sent to the Mediterranean, replacing the Bristol Blenheims of No. 14 Squadron in Egypt. The Squadron flew its first operational mission on 6 November 1942, being used for long range reconnaissance, mine-laying and anti-shipping strikes.March 1998, p. 174. Unlike the USAAF, 14 Squadron made productive use of the equipment for carrying torpedoes, sinking several merchant ships with this weapon. The Marauder also proved useful in disrupting enemy air transport, shooting down considerable numbers of German and Italian transport aircraft flying between Italy and North Africa.Air International February 1988, p. 81. In 1943, deliveries of 100 long-wingspan B-26C-30s (Marauder II) allowed two squadrons of the South African Air Force, 12 and 24 Squadron to be equipped, these being used for bombing missions over the Aegean Sea, Crete and Italy. A further 350 B-26Fs and Gs were supplied in 1944, with two more South African squadrons (21 and 30) joining No 12 and 24 in Italy to form an all-Marauder equipped wing, while one further SAAF squadron (25) and a new RAF squadron (39 Squadron), re- equipped with Marauders as part of the Balkan Air Force supporting Tito's Partisans in Yugoslavia. A Marauder of 25 Squadron SAAF, shot down on the unit's last mission of World War II on 4 May 1945, was the last Marauder lost in combat by any user.Air International February 1988, p. 82. The British and South African aircraft were quickly scrapped following the end of the war, the United States not wanting the return of the Lend-Lease aircraft. France Following Operation Torch, (the Allied invasion of North Africa), the Free French Air Force re-equipped three squadrons with Marauders for medium-bombing operations in Italy and the Allied invasion of southern France.Air International February 1988, pp. 82, 94. These B-26s replaced Lior√© et Olivier LeO 451s and Douglas DB-7s.Rickard, J. \\"Martin B-26 Marauder with Free French Air Force\\". historyofwar.org, 4 May 2009. Retrieved: 9 October 2009. Toward the end of the war, seven of the nine French Groupes de Bombardement used the Marauder, taking part in 270 missions with 4,884 aircraft sorties in combat. Free French B-26 groups were disbanded in June 1945.Johnson 2008, p. 84. Replaced in squadron service by 1947, two lingered on as testbeds for the Snecma Atar jet engine, one of these remaining in use until 1958. Corporate operations B-26C modified for corporate use in 1948 with faired nose and rear fuselage and added passenger windows. In the immediate post-war years, a small number of Marauders were converted as high-speed executive transports, accommodating up to fifteen passengers. The specifications of the individual conversions differed considerably.Green. 1965, p. 264 The example shown in the image was completed in 1948 and had streamlined nose and tail fairings and windows inserted in the rear fuselage. It served United Airlines before being sold to Mexico. It was purchased by the Confederate Air Force and restored to wartime markings for air display purposes before being lost in a fatal crash in 1995.

It was developed by Consolidated Aircraft in parallel with the Boeing B-29 Superfortress as a fallback design should the B-29 prove unsuccessful.Jones 1974, p. 106. The B-32 only reached units in the Pacific during mid-1945, and subsequently saw only limited combat operations against Japanese targets before the end of the war. Most of the extant orders of the B-32 were canceled shortly thereafter and only 118 B-32 airframes of all types were built. Design and development The engineering development of the B-29 had been underway since mid-1938 when, in June 1940, the United States Army Air Corps requested a similar design from the Consolidated Aircraft Company in case of development difficulties with the B-29. The Model 33 on which Consolidated based its proposal was similar to the B-24 Liberator. Like the B-24 it was originally designed with a twin tail and a large Davis wing, but with a longer, rounder fuselage and a rounded nose. The powerplants were to be the same quartet of eighteen-cylinder, Wright Duplex-Cyclones, as specified for B-29s. The aircraft was designed to be pressurized, and have remote-controlled retractable gun turrets with fourteen machine guns. It was to have an estimated gross weight of . The first contract for two XB-32s was signed on 6 September 1940, the same day as the contract for the Boeing prototype XB-29. The first XB-32-CO, AAF s/n 41-141, was constructed next to the Army Air Forces (AAF) Base Tarrant Field Airdrome at the AAF Aircraft Plant No. 4 just west of Fort Worth, Texas along the south side of Lake Worth. The Consolidated Vultee Bomber Plant assembly line was six months behind schedule, the aircraft making its first flight on 7 September 1942. Due to problems with the pressurization system, the gun turrets and landing gear doors, these items were omitted on the first prototype. The aircraft had R-3350-13 engines inboard and R-3350-21s outboard, with all four powerplants driving three-bladed propellers. The XB-32 had persistent problems with engine oil leaks and poor cooling, but the B-29 also had similar engine problems. The inboard propellers' pitch could be reversed to shorten the landing roll or to roll back in ground maneuvers. The first XB-32 was armed with eight machine guns in dorsal and ventral turrets, and an odd combination of two .50 caliber and one cannon in each outboard engine nacelle firing rearwards, plus two .50 caliber machine guns in the wings outboard of the propellers.Baugher, Joe \\"Consolidated B-32 Dominator.\\" Consolidated B-32 Dominator: USAAF/USAF Bomber Aircraft-Third Series, (Joe Baugher's Encyclopedia of American Aircraft), 12 September 2009. Retrieved: 3 July 2010. The turrets were remotely controlled from periscopic sights in aiming stations inside the aircraft. The sights were coordinated by a sophisticated analog computer system developed by Sperry Gyroscope Company. XB-32-CO 41-142 on 28 February 1944 On 17 March 1943, the initial contract was signed for 300 B-32-CFs but development problems continued. On 10 May 1943, the first XB-32 crashed on takeoff after making a total of 30 flights before the second XB-32, s/n 41-142, finally flew on 2 July 1943. This aircraft had a traditional stepped cockpit canopy. Upon examination and testing, the USAAF recommended a large number of changes that included more conventional gun stations. The pressurization system had problems which were never solved and so the role of the aircraft was changed to operating at low to medium altitude. This decision meant that the pressurization system was easily eliminated from production aircraft. Problems with the remote-controlled gun turrets were never solved and the armament on production aircraft was changed to 10 .50 caliber machine guns in manually operated turrets: Sperry A-17 turrets in the nose and tail, two Martin A-3F-A dorsal turrets, and one Sperry A-13-A ball turret. The bomb load was increased by to . The second XB-32 continued to have stability problems. In an attempt to resolve this a B-29 style tail was fitted to the aircraft after its 25th flight but this did not resolve the problem and a Consolidated-designed vertical tail was added and first flown on the third XB-32, s/n 41-18336 on 3 November 1943. The first production aircraft was fitted with a B-29 vertical tail until a new tail was substituted. By 1944 testing of the three prototypes permitted the AAF to place orders for over 1,500 B-32s. The first production aircraft was delivered on 19 September 1944, by which time the B-29 was in combat in China. The first B-32 crashed on the same day it was delivered when the nose wheel collapsed on landing. Beginning on 27 January 1945, 40 B-32A-5, -10 and -15 aircraft were delivered as unarmed TB-32-CF crew trainers. Originally, the Army Air Forces intended the B-32 as a \\"fallback\\" design to be used only if the B-29 program fell significantly behind in its development schedule. As development of the B-32 became seriously delayed this plan became unnecessary due to the success of the B-29. Initial plans to use the B-32 to supplement the B-29 in re-equipping B-17 and B-24 groups before redeployment of the Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces to the Pacific were stymied when only five production models had been delivered by the end of 1944, by which time B-29 operations were underway in the Twentieth Air Force. Operational history The first assignment of the B-32 began when General George Kenney, the commander of Allied air forces in the South West Pacific Area and commander of the U.S. Fifth Air Force, traveled to Washington D.C. to request B-29s. Since priority had been given to strategic bombing by the B-29, Kenney's request was denied, after which he then requested the B-32. Following a demonstration, the Army General Staff agreed that Kenney could conduct a combat evaluation, and a test schedule of 11 missions was set up, followed by a plan to re-equip two of the 312th Bomb Group's four Douglas A-20 Havoc squadrons with the B-32. Project crews took three B-32s to Clark Field, Luzon, Philippine Islands, in mid-May 1945 for a series of test flights completed on 17 June. The three test B-32s were assigned to the 312th BG's 386th Bombardment Squadron. On 29 May 1945, the first of four combat missions by the B-32 was flown against a supply depot at Antatet in the Philippines, followed by two B-32s dropping 16 bombs on a sugar mill at Taito, Formosa, on 15 June. On 22 June, a B-32 bombed an alcohol plant at Heito, Formosa, with bombs, but a second B-32 missed flak positions with its fragmentation bombs. The last mission was flown on 25 June against bridges near Kiirun on Formosa. The test crews were impressed with its unique reversible-pitch inboard propellers and the Davis wing which gave it excellent landing performance. However, they found a number of faults: the cockpit was noisy and had a poor instrument layout, the bombardier's vision was limited, the aircraft was overweight, and the nacelle design resulted in frequent engine fires (a deficiency shared with the B-29 Superfortress). However, the testing missions were mostly successful. In July 1945, the 386th Bomb Squadron completed its transition to the B-32, flying six more combat missions before the war ended. On 13 August, the 386th BS moved from Luzon to Yontan Airfield on Okinawa and flew mostly photographic reconnaissance missions. The missions were intended to monitor Japan's compliance with the ceasefire and to gather information such as possible routes occupation forces could take into Tokyo. On 17 August, the B-32s were intercepted by Japanese fighters. During the two-hour engagement, the Dominators suffered only minor damage and none of their crew were injured. \\"Though the B-32 gunners later claimed to have damaged one fighter and 'probably destroyed' two others, surviving Japanese records list no losses for that day or next.\\"Harding 2008, p. 69. Based on the Japanese action on the 17 August, U.S. commanders felt that it was important to continue the reconnaissance missions over Tokyo so they could determine if it was an isolated incident or an indication that Japan would reject the ceasefire and continue fighting. On 18 August 1945, four Dominators were given the task of photographing many of the targets covered on the previous day; however, mechanical problems caused two to be pulled from the flight. Over Japan, a formation of 14 A6M Zeros and three N1K2-J Shiden-Kai (George) fighters (apparently mis-identified as Ki-44 Tojos by the American crewsSakai, Saburo.

Sabur≈ç Sakai, a Japanese ace, said later that there was concern that the Dominators were attacking. Another Japanese ace, Sadamu Komachi, stated in a 1978 Japanese magazine article that the fighter pilots could not bear to see American bombers flying serenely over a devastated Tokyo.Harding 2008, p. 70. The B-32 Dominator Hobo Queen II (s/n 42-108532) was flying at when the Japanese fighters took off and received no significant damage.Harding 2008, p. 71. Hobo Queen II claimed two Zeros destroyed in the action as well as a probable Shiden-Kai. Japanese records show that no aircraft were lost. The other Dominator was flying below Hobo Queen II when the fighters took off. The fighters heavily damaged that Dominator, initially wounding the dorsal gunner and then seriously wounding two other members. Photographer Staff Sergeant Joseph Lacharite was wounded in the legs (his recovery required several years). Sergeant Anthony Marchione, a photographer's assistant, helped Lacharite and then was fatally wounded himself.Harding 2008, p. 71. Marchione was the last American to die in air combat in World War II. Despite the damage, the Dominator returned to Okinawa. However, the incident precipitated the removal of propellers from all Japanese fighters as per the terms of the ceasefire agreement, beginning 19 August 1945. The last B-32 combat photo reconnaissance mission was completed on 28 August, during which two B-32s were destroyed in separate accidents, with 15 of the 26 crewmen killed. On 30 August, the 386th Bomb Squadron stood down from operations. Production contracts of the B-32 were cancelled on 8 September 1945, with production ceased by 12 October. Many B-32s ended up being salvaged at Walnut Ridge, Arkansas with a total of 38 flown to Kingman Army Airfield for disposal. The large club pip of the 386th is visible on one B-32 awaiting reclamation. Five of Kingman's Dominators were from the 386th Bomb Squadron, 312th Bomb Group's overseas assignment. Along with several other noteworthy aircraft on temporary display at Davis Monthan AFB after World War II, the last surviving Dominator, B-32-1-CF #42-108474 was written off and destroyed in 1949.

Its center is the city of Zadar.  Population  According to the 2011 census, Zadar County has population of 170,017, accounting for 4.0% of the total Croatia's population. Croats make up the majority with 92.57% of the population, while Serbs, Bosniaks, Albanians and Italians form the remainder. Zadar County Population Pyramid (2011) Geography Among the largest towns in the county of Zadar are: Zadar, Benkovac, Bibinje, Biograd, Nin, Obrovac and Pag. The county of Zadar includes the islands of Dugi otok, Ugljan, Pa≈°man, Molat, Lavdara, Zverinac, Vir and most of Pag, as well as a number of other, smaller islands. It also features the Paklenica national park. The county's area is 7,854 km2, 3,646 km2 is land, which accounts for 6.4% of the territory of Croatia. The sea area of the County is 3,632 km2 (around 12% of the territorial waters) and the insular area is 580 km2, with more than 300 smaller and larger islands (Zadar Archipelago). The length of its coastline (including the islands) is 1,300 km. Infrastructure The County of Zadar plays a leading role in road and railway traffic links between northern and southern Croatia. The main road along the Adriatic Sea passes through the county, as does the new Zagreb- Dubrovnik highway, completed as far as Split in 2005. The Zagreb-Knin-Split railway line with branch-lines to Zadar and ≈†ibenik pass through the County. Maritime traffic is carried by the coastal route of the Adriatic Sea, by the Zadar-Ancona international car ferry route which is the shortest link between Central Europe and Italy, via Zagreb and Zadar to Rome and southward. Another route by which intensive traffic is carried is Zadar - Maslenica Bridge - St. Rok Tunnel - Zagreb. The Zadar Airport has recently been reconstructed and modernised. With runway improvements still to be undertaken it will eventually have the capacity to handle jumbo-jets. There is also a very frequent maritime passenger port in the town of Zadar and the cargo maritime port in the Gazenica area whose current manipulative capacity amounts to one million tonnes per year. A construction of a wharf would raise this significantly. The port's manipulative and warehouse capacities are used only in part. Economy The Ravni Kotari area constitutes the greater part of the County's inland, containing most of the cultivated farmland and towns having industry, crafts, trade and traffic development potential. Tourism is one of the County's most important industries, owing to its geographical position, mild climate, indented coast, clear sea, numerous bays, inlets and beaches on 1,300 km of the sea coast and islands. Tourist amenities of the Zadar County are also the areas of outstanding natural beauty: the Velebit, Tela≈°ƒçica and Paklenica and adjacent Krka and Kornati national parks in the south and the Plitvice Lakes national park in the north.

The B-58 was developed during the 1950s for the United States Air Force's (USAF) Strategic Air Command (SAC). To achieve the high speeds desired, Convair designed it around a large delta wing, which was also used by contemporary fighters such as the Convair F-102. It was powered by four General Electric J79 engines in underwing pods. It had no bomb bay; it carried a single nuclear weapon plus fuel in a combination bomb/fuel pod underneath the fuselage. Later, four external hardpoints were added, enabling it to carry up to five weapons. The B-58 entered service in March 1960, and was operated for a decade by two SAC bomb wings: the 43d Bombardment Wing and the 305th Bombardment Wing.Martin, Douglas. \\"Robert H. Widmer, Designer of Military Aircraft, Dies at 95\\". The New York Times, 2 July 2011. It was considered a difficult aircraft to fly, imposing a high workload upon its three-man crews. Designed to replace the Boeing B-47 Stratojet strategic bomber, the B-58 became notorious for its sonic boom, which was often heard on the ground by the public as it passed overhead in supersonic flight.\\"B-58's Sonic Boom Rattles Kentuckians\\". Chicago Daily Tribune, 19 December 1961. Retrieved: 2 November 2009. The B-58 was originally intended to fly at high altitudes and supersonic speeds to avoid Soviet interceptors. But with the Soviet introduction of high-altitude surface-to-air missiles, the B-58 was forced to adopt a low-level-penetration role that severely limited its range and strategic value. It was never used to deliver conventional bombs. The B-58 was substantially more expensive to operate than other bombers, such as the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress, and required more frequent aerial refueling. The B-58 also suffered from a high rate of accidental losses. All of this led to a relatively brief operational career of ten years. The B-58 was succeeded in its role by the smaller, swing-wing FB-111A. Development=Origins The genesis of the B-58 was the Generalized Bomber Study (GEBO II) issued in February 1949 by the Air Research and Development Command (ARDC) at Wright- Patterson AFB, Ohio, for the development of a supersonic, long-range, manned bomber aircraft. Specifically, ARDC sought the best attainable numeric data, challenging the industry to devise their own solutions to attain the stated goal. Work on the proposed bomber's design was to begin less than two years after sustained supersonic flight had been achieved.Miller 1976, p. 24. According to aviation authors Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist, while some military officials were keenly interested in the prospective use of supersonic bombers at this time, other figures held a more negative attitude towards such ambitions due to fundamental questions over propulsion systems and material science involved in supersonic operations, as well as the very high fuel consumption incurred over subsonic counterparts.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 172. Despite scepticism from some quarters, multiple contractors decided to submit bids for GEBO II, which was viewed as an influential step towards securing a future to a development contract; these included Boeing, Convair, Curtiss, Douglas, Martin and North American Aviation. The majority of submissions were relatively straightforward and unambitious, as well as typically involving considerable expense.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 173. Convair, which had built the XF-92A and other delta-wing fighters, initially looked at swept and semi-delta configurations, then settled on the delta wing planform, which offered good internal volume for support systems and fuel; it also provided low wing loading (for airframe size), permitting supersonic flight in the mid-stratosphere at . Most of the configurations studied involved matching said delta wing to a relatively slender fuselage, which housed a crew of two and was powered by a pair of jet engines. The initial Convair proposal, coded FZP-110, was a radical two-place, delta wing bomber design powered by an arrangement of three General Electric J53 turbojet engines. The performance estimates included a speed and a range. A key feature of the design was to house consumables, both the weaponry and the majority of the fuel, within a large external pod, which enabled a reduction in the size of the aircraft. In January 1951, Convair submitted the FZP-110 proposal, this being received later than the majority of competing bids. During December 1951, a revised FZP-016 proposal was submitted, which deleted the third engine on the tail, increased the remaining two engines' thrust output, and added a third crew member for operating defensive systems. Selection Ejection pod undergoing testing RB-58A with two component pod (TCP) The Air Force chose Boeing's MX-1712 and Convair MX-1626 design studies to proceed to a Phase 1 study. It was during this phase of development that Convair decided to take advantage of recent developments made by General Electric, replacing the two large J53 engines with four smaller J79s, which had been determined to be more optimal for supersonic flight.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 173-174. The recently formulated area rule was also applied to the design, resulting in aerodynamic re-profiling of the aircraft, making its fuselage even more slender. Having been refined as such, Convair redesignated their renewed submission MX-1964. In August 1952, Convair's design was determined to be the superior;Miller 1985, p. 26. According to Gunston and Gilchrist, Boeing's submission was viewed as being equally good, but that company's securing of a separate contract to produce the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress had undoubtably influenced decision makers in their selection for this competition.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 174. Accordingly, in December 1952, it was selected to meet the newly proposed SAB-51 (Supersonic Aircraft Bomber) and SAR-51 (Supersonic Aircraft Reconnaissance), the first General Operational Requirement (GOR) worldwide for supersonic bombers. In February 1953, the Air Force issued a contract to develop Convair's design, which had been formally designated B-58 on 10 December 1952.Miller 1985, p. 28.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 175. The B-58 programme, unlike preceding military aircraft, was organised in a fashion now recognised as being the first weapon system contract.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 174-175. Under this arrangement, Convair acted as the prime contractor, responsible for the satisfactory delivery of all elements relating the programme, not only the aircraft itself. As such, Convair had to devise or subcontract other entities to provide everything associated with the aircraft's operation, from the engines to training manuals, spare components, and software, in excess of one million items. Early on, the contract was modified, calling for the production of a pair of XB-58 prototypes, 11 YB-58A pre-production aircraft, and 31 mission pods; these mission pods included a free-fall bomb pod, a rocket-propelled controllable bomb pod, a reconnaissance pod, and an electronic reconnaissance pod. Into flight The first prototype, serial number 55-660, was rolled out on 31 August 1956.Miller 1985, p. 39. The programme has been performed with a high level of security; prior to the roll out, no unauthorised individual had knowledge of its shape or basic configuration. On 11 November 1956, the maiden flight of the type was performed; the prototype exceeded Mach 1 for the first time on 30 December of that year.Miller 1985, p. 42. A difficult and protracted flight test program involving 30 aircraft continued until April 1959.Miller 1985, p. 54. A total of 116 B-58s were produced: 30 trial aircraft and 86 production B-58A models. Most of the trial aircraft were later upgraded to operational standard; eight were equipped as TB-58A training aircraft. Convair sought to develop the B-58 further, various variants and derivatives were proposed for both military and civil applications. Most would never go beyond the drawing board, a sizable proportion having at one point been ordered prior to a decision to terminate multiple contracts; the B-58B, B-58C, B-58D, and B-58E variants were all terminated prior to any production aircraft being completed. During the late 1960s, some refinements to the existing fleet were developed and introduced, such as slender bomb racks (known as Multiple Weapons Capability) and additional pods.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 178. The final B-58 was delivered in October 1962. Design=Overview The Convair B-58 Hustler was a high speed strategic bomber, capable of attaining routinely Mach 2 at altitude. It incorporated a large delta wing with a leading-edge sweep of 60¬∞ and was powered by an arrangement of four General Electric J79-GE-1 turbojet engines. Although its sizable wing generated relatively low wing loading, it proved to be surprisingly well suited for low-altitude, high-speed flight. To protect against the heat generated while cruising at Mach 2, the crew compartment, the wheel wells and electronics bay were pressurized and air conditioned. The B-58 was one of the first extensive applications of aluminum honeycomb panels, which bonded outer and inner aluminum skins to a honeycomb of aluminum or fiberglass.Loftin, Laurence K. Jr. \\"Quest for Performance: The Evolution of Modern Aircraft. Part II: The Jet Age. Chapter 12: Jet Bomber and Attack Aircraft. Two Pioneering Explorations.\\" National Aeronautics & Space Administration, 2004. Retrieved: 1 December 2014. Various features of the B-58 were considered to be record-breaking, according to Gunston and Gilchrist.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 175-176. The structure itself made up 13.8 per cent of the aircraft's gross weight, an exceptionally low figure for the era, while the wing was considered to be extremely thin as well. Several key features of the engine, including the nacelle and the inlet, were unlike any existing aircraft, having been devised from guidance by aerodynamicists. Specifically, the inlets used moving conical spikes, being fully aft on the ground and at low speeds to maximise air intake, then driven forward while being flown at high speeds to minimise the annular gap. This movement was automatically controlled, but significant noise and asymmetric thrust would be generated in the event of a single inlet malfunctioning.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 176. Crew provisions The B-58 was operated by a crew of three: pilot, bombardier/navigator, and defensive systems operator. They were seated in separated tandem cockpits. The pilot's cockpit, which was provided with very deep windows, was considered to be mostly conventional for a large multi-engine aircraft.Miller 1985, p. 94. The defensive systems operator was provisioned with a complex arrangement of different systems, which Gunston and Gilchrist describe as being the most complicated of any aircraft of the era. The space allocated to the crew, despite being roughly half of the fuselage's internal volume, was typically considered to be cramped and claustrophobic.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 176-177. Later versions of the B-58 provided each crew member with a novel ejection capsule that could eject at an altitude of at speeds up to Mach 2. Unlike standard ejection seats of the period, a protective clamshell would enclose the seat and the control stick with an attached oxygen cylinder, allowing the pilot to continue to fly even \\"turtled up\\" and ready for immediate egress. The capsule was buoyant; the crewmember could open the clamshell, and use it as a life raft.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 177. Unusually, the ejection system was tested with live bears and chimpanzees;Miller 1985, pp. 53‚Äì54. it was qualified for use during 1963. The XB-70 would use a similar system with capsules of a different design. B-58 crewmember escape capsule The electronic controls were ambitious and advanced for the day. The navigator and DSO's cockpits featured wraparound dashboards with warning lights and buttons, and automatic voice messages and warnings from a tape system were audible through the helmet sets. Research during the era of all-male combat aircraft assignments revealed that a woman's voice was more likely to gain the attention of young men in distracting situations. Nortronics Division of Northrop Corporation selected actress and singer Joan Elms to record the automated voice warnings. To those flying the B-58, the voice was known as \\"Sexy Sally.\\"\\"Voice warning systems message priority.\\" palaamar.com. Retrieved: 14 September 2015.\\"Sexy Sally Sounds Off.\\" San Francisco Examiner, 30 July 1966, reprinted in United States Naval Institute Proceedings, November 1966. Adverse flight characteristics While the B-58's performance and design were exceptional for the era, it was not an easy aircraft to fly. This was caused by the 60¬∞ leading edge sweepback of its wing and was inherent in these types of delta wing platforms. It required a much higher angle of attack than a conventional aircraft, up to 9.4¬∞ at Mach 0.5 at low altitudes. If the angle of attack was too high, in excess of 17¬∞, the bomber could pitch up and enter a spin. Several factors could prevent a successful recovery: if the pilot applied elevon, if the center of gravity was not correctly positioned, or if the spin occurred below , recovery might not be possible. The B-58 also possessed unconventional stall characteristics; if the nose was elevated, the bomber maintained forward motion without pitching down. Unless large amounts of power were applied, the descent rate increased rapidly. Another problem pilots faced was called \\"fuel stacking\\", taking place whenever the B-58 accelerated or decelerated. It was caused by fuel movement within the tanks, which led to sudden changes in the aircraft's center of gravity. This could cause the B-58 to abruptly pitch or bank, potentially resulting in a loss of control.Slade 2012, p. 238. The aircraft had unusual takeoff requirements, with a 14¬∞ angle of attack needed for the rotation at about for a combat weight. This poor takeoff performance was evident with the high landing speed, necessitating a drogue parachute for braking, which was also required for B-47 and B-52 aircraft. To accommodate the high landing speed, the specially configured landing gear had to handle excessive conditions, both the inflation pressure and wheel rpm were far greater than prior units in order to cope. Weapons systems The Sperry AN/ASQ-42 bombing/navigation system combined a sophisticated inertial navigation system with the KS-39 Star tracker (astro-inertial navigation system) to provide heading reference, the AN/APN-113 Doppler radar to provide ground speed and windspeed data, a search radar to provide range data for bomb release and trajectory, and a radar altimeter.Miller 1985, p. 105. The AN/ASQ-42 was estimated to be 10 times more accurate than any previous bombing/navigation system. Defensive armament consisted of a single 20 mm (0.79 in) T-171E-3 rotary cannon with 1,200 rounds of ammunition in a radar-aimed tail barbette.\\"Convair B-58 Hustler Strategic Bomber.\\" AeroSpaceWeb.org, 2012. Retrieved: 12 December 2014. It was remotely controlled through the Emerson MD-7 automated radar fire-control system only requiring the DSO to lock-on a selected target blip on his scope and then fire the gun. The system computed aiming, velocity or heading differential, and range compensation. Offensive armament typically consisted of a single nuclear weapon, along with fuel tanks, in a streamlined MB-1C pod under the fuselage. Incurable difficulties with fuel leakage resulted in the replacement of the MB-1C with the TCP (Two Component Pod), which placed the nuclear weapon in an upper section while the lower fuel component could be independently jettisoned.Miller 1985, p. 109. This had the added benefit of allowing the pilot to \\"clean up\\" the aircraft for fuel efficiency or in case of emergency, while still retaining the (somewhat) slimmer weapon. From 1961 to 1963, the B-58 was retrofitted with two tandem stub pylons under each wing root, adjacent to the centreline pod,Hansen 1988, pp. 158, 161. for B43 or B61 nuclear weapons for a total of five nuclear weapons per aircraft. Although the USAF looked at using the B-58 for conventional strikes, it was never equipped for carrying or dropping conventional bombs. A photo reconnaissance pod, the LA-331, was also fielded. Several other specialized pods for ECM or an early cruise missile were considered, but not adopted. The late-1950s High Virgo air-launched ballistic missile was designed to be launched from the B-58; a Hustler carried out four test launches to determine ballistic missile and anti-satellite weapon system capability.\\"Designation systems.\\" designation-systems.net. Retrieved: 8 December 2009. Operational history=Introduction B-58A in flight On 1 August 1960, the B-58 was declared operational, nine months after the delivery of the first aircraft to the Air Force. One month later, a single B-58 participated in the annual SAC Combat Competition at Bergstrom; it proved itself to be superior to competing Boeing B-47 Stratojets and Boeing B-52 Stratofortresses, securing first place in both high-level and low-level radar bombing exercises. Crews were typically chosen from other strategic bomber squadrons. Due to some characteristics of delta-winged aircraft, new pilots used the Convair F-102 Delta Dagger as a conversion trainer, before moving to the TB-58A trainer.Miller 1985, p. 62. The B-58 was found to be difficult to fly and its three-man crews were constantly busy, but its performance was exceptional. A lightly loaded Hustler would climb at nearly 46,000 ft/min (235 m/s).Higham 1975, p. 31. In addition to its much smaller weapons load and more limited range than the B-52, the B-58 had been extremely expensive to acquire. Excessive program expenditure Convair YB-58A-1-CF Hustler (AF Ser. No. 55-0661), the second aircraft built Through FY 1961, the total cost of the B-58 program was $3 billion ($ billion in dollars).Miller 1985, p. 48.Hall, R.

A highly complex aircraft, it also required considerable maintenance, much of which required specialized equipment and ground personnel. For comparison, the average maintenance cost per flying hour for the B-47 was $361, for the B-52 it was $1,025 and for the B-58 it was $1,440.Converse 2012, p. 517. The B-58 cost three times as much to operate as the B-52.Miller 1985, p. 69. The cost of maintaining and operating the two operational B-58 wings (39 aircraft per wing) equaled that of six wings of B-52s (only 15 aircraft per wing). Because of the support costs of six wings vs only two wings, the actual cost per aircraft of the B-52s were $1.42 million per year vs $1.21 million per year for the B-58 (this figure included special detailed maintenance for the nose landing gear, which retracted in a complex fashion to avoid the center payload).Hall, R. Cargill. \\"The B-58 Bomber.\\" Air University Review, Research Division, at the Albert F. Simpson Historical Research Center, Maxwell AFB, Alabama, November‚ÄìDecember 1981. Retrieved: 14 February 2015. Compounding these exorbitant costs, the B-58 had a high accident rate: 26 B-58 aircraft were lost in accidents, 22.4% of total production, more than half of the losses occurred during flight tests. The SAC senior leadership had been doubtful about the aircraft type from the beginning, although its crews eventually became enthusiastic about the aircraft. General Curtis LeMay was never satisfied with the bomber, and after a flight in one declared that it was too small, far too expensive to maintain in combat readiness and required an excessive number of aerial refuelings to complete a mission.Adams 2009, p. 41. Although the high altitude ferry range of the B-58 was better than that of the B-47s, the lack of forward basing resulted in a requirement for more KC-135 tanker support.\\"B-58 Hustler United States Nuclear Forces.\\" FAS (Federation of American Scientists), 29 May 1997.

Operational wings and retirement Two SAC bomb wings operated the B-58 during its operational service: the 43d Bombardment Wing (which later transitioned to the 43rd Airlift Wing), based at Carswell AFB, Texas from 1960 to 1964, and Little Rock AFB, Arkansas from 1964 to 1970; and the 305th Bombardment Wing, based at Bunker Hill AFB (later Grissom AFB), Indiana from 1961 to 1970. The 305th also operated the B-58 combat crew training school (CCTS), the predecessor of the USAF's current formal training units (FTUs). XB-58 prototype during takeoff By the time the early problems had largely been resolved and SAC interest in the bomber had solidified, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara decided that the B-58 was not a viable weapon system.Sorenson 1995, p. 131. It was during the B-58's introduction that high-altitude Soviet surface-to-air missiles (SAM) became a threat, especially the SA-2 Guideline, a SAM system the Soviet Union extensively deployed. The \\"solution\\" to this problem was to fly at low altitudes, minimizing the radar line-of-sight and reducing exposure time. Because of dense air at low altitudes, the B-58 could not fly at supersonic speeds and its moderate range was reduced further, negating the costly high-speed performance of the aircraft. Despite shortcomings, the type had its advocates within the service; according to Gunston and Gilchrist, when Secretary McNamara had requested proposals for a new manned Mach 2 bomber, General Thomas S. Power responded with a request for the B-58 to be put back into production. In late 1965, McNamara ordered retirement of the B-58 by 1970; the principal reason given for this directive was the high sustainment cost for the fleet. On 29 October 1969, the Department of Defense announced that the type would be withdrawn from service on 31 January 1970.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 179. Despite efforts of some officials within the Air Force to secure a reprieve, the phaseout proceeded on schedule. The last B-58s were retired in January 1970, after which they were placed into storage with the Military Aircraft Storage and Disposition Center (MASDC) at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. The fleet survived intact until 1977, at which point nearly all remaining aircraft were sold to Southwestern Alloys for disposal.Miller 1985, p. 70.Veronico and Strong 2010, p. 112. As a weapons system, the B-58 was replaced by the FB-111A. This aircraft was designed for low-altitude attack, to be more flexible with the carriage of conventional weapons, and less expensive to produce and maintain. Since B-58 pilots were the only USAF pilots experienced in long-duration supersonic flight, several former Hustler crew members were selected by Colonel Douglas Nelson to fly the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird at the start of that program. Test aircraft A number of B-58s were used for special trials. One was specially modified to test the Hughes radar system intended for the Lockheed YF-12 interceptor and the North American F-108 Rapier, which had an extended nose to accommodate the radar and was nicknamed \\"Snoopy\\" (see Aircraft on Display). Several improved (and usually enlarged) variants, named B-58B and B-58C by the manufacturer, were proposed but never built. 61-2059 (Greased Lightning) at the Strategic Air Command & Aerospace Museum near Ashland, Nebraska.

One of the goals of the flight was to push the limit of its new honeycomb construction technique. The speed of the flight was limited only by the speed at which they believed the honeycomb panels would delaminate, although one of the afterburners malfunctioned and the last hour of the flight was continued at subsonic speed.

Geography A memorial sculpture in Librazhd. Librazhd District has an administrative border of . The district is characterised by a mountainous landscape with scenic valleys, including glacial valleys above in the Polis Mountains. The Shkumbin River is sourced in and traverses through the district. The average altitude is above sea level. The highest point is at the Red Peak of Shebenik Mountain. Librazhd District has a continental climate. The average temperature is . The maximum temperature was recorded in 1957, while the minimum recorded temperature was in 1968 at . Precipitation averages 1363 mm per year.Bashkia Librazhd. Welcome to Librazhd. Bashkia Librazhd/USAID, 2010, p. 9. The Shkumbin River has its source in the Librazhd District at Valamra and the Guri i Topit Mountain. The river is long and flows through the district for . The Shkumbin is fed by the waters of the Dushna, Radicina, Bushtrica, Sheja, Hotolisht, Dragostunja streams. The Shkumbin flows through the town of Librazhd. The Rrapun River joins the Shkumbin at Murrash. The Shebenik-Jabllanice National Park is the Librazhd District's only national park and makes up approximately 33% of the district's area. Flora and fauna Much of the district is mountainous. There are 1,857 species of flora in the district representing 57% of the total species of flora inhabiting Albania. Forests cover 47% of the district of which 37% are populated by oak, 20% beech and 15% pine. The remainder is made up of shrubs and other foliage. 15% of the herbaceous flora in the district fall within the group known as Balkan Flora and are particular to this part of Europe. Amongst the herbaceous plants the most notable species endemic to the district are Leontopodium alpinum and Sideritis Rhoeseri. Of particular interest is a carnivorous plant species called Pinguicula hirtflora (known locally as Luletlyni). The forests and mountains of the district are populated with bear (Ursus arctos), wild boar, red fox, hare, and supposedly the Balkan Lynx. Birds include eagles (Aquila chrysaetos and Gyps fulvus), buzzards (Nephron pesnopterus), falcons (Falcao tinnunculus) and the owl (Bubo bubo). History & Culture Evidence has been found to show the area was populated during the Bronze Age and the Iron Age from the remains of settlements found at Spathar, Rrajce, Karkavec, Berzeshte and other places. An Illyrian tribe called the Kandav√´t who give the region the name Kandavia populated the area in ancient times.Bashkia Librazhd. Welcome to Librazhd. Bashkia Librazhd/USAID, 2010, p. 7. The Romans moved into the area in around 220BCE and subjugated the tribes living there (see Illyrian Wars). During the Roman Occupation the Via Egnatia was constructed through the area, linking Rome with Constantinople which was of great importance for commerce. The route of this ancient road is now utilised by a modern highway connecting Tirana with Skopje via Lake Ohrid. Following the Fall of Rome in 476CE the region fell under the power of the Eastern Roman Empire centred at Constantinople until the arrival of the Turks in the 15th century. The Ottoman Turks began to invade the area of the modern district from about 1415 onwards under the leadership of Mehmed I. They were opposed by the local Arianitas family who ruled the area as vassals to the Byzantine Emperor in Constantinople. The local prince Gjergj Arianit Komneni (also known as Gjergj Golemi) was noted by the Ottoman chroniclers for his ferocious resistance to their advances, viz: > With this uprising Arianiti accomplished great and unforgettable deeds which > will last as long as life itself. (from Hallkokondili) Gjergj Arianiti managed to resist the Ottoman advance throughout his tenure and in 1444 rose to support the revolt led by George Kastrioti, otherwise known as Skanderbeg - the Albanian national hero. He is known to have taken part in the Albanian League in Lezha which elected Skanderbeg their king. Arianiti fought alongside Skanderbeg at Berat in 1448 and his daughter, Andronika, married Skanderbeg in 1451. Gjergj Arianiti died in 1461 and resistance to the Turks throughout the Librazhd district began to wane. Following his death the remaining members of the Arianiti family emigrated to Italy. In 1479 the Ottoman Turks succeeded in conquering the Albanians who were forced to accept the Turks as their overlords until the 20th century. The region came to achieve a significant degree of autonomy during the latter years of the Ottoman Empire due to the harshness of the terrain and the talent for diplomacy and nepotism exercised by the local Beyliks who garnered significant influence with the Porte. During the 17th century, parts of the Librazhd district achieved a measure of self-rule. This process continued up until the uprising of Tanzimati in 1834 when the whole Librazhd District attempted to throw off Ottoman rule. They were unsuccessful this time, but a local leader by the name Halit Berzeshta emerged who was to lead and inspire the Albanian resistance until his death in 1909. In 1912 the population enthusiastically rose in revolt against the Ottoman Empire and took their part in the realisation of Albanian Independence that same year. In the 1940s some 1,100 local men formed into two battalions fought the occupying Germans and helped liberate the area. Their exploits were famous throughout Albania and from their number are recognised 79 national martyrs. A view from Shebenik Mountain, the district's tallest mountain. Life in the Librazhd District has been badly affected by the closing of many traditional industries, in particular the mining industry due to an inability to meet modern European environmental and health and safety standards. The construction of a highway linking the town with Skopje and Tirana through Durres has been a positive development. Cultural Traditions Librazhd costume is characterized by garments made from wool, hemp and flax. The choice of colours is considered in Albania to be particularly noteworthy. Garments are traditionally decorated with an eagle, star, snake, ram, geometric figures, plants and flowers. Located at the crossroads of northern and southern Albania, the wearers folk costumes in the district are a combination of those in both Gheg and Tosk culture. The flattened form of qeleshe skull cap traditional to the south is usually worn by men in the countryside. Tosk is the dominant Albanian dialect spoken in the district, although in many the villages north of the Shkumbin, Gheg can be heard. Additionally in some of the villages bordering the Bulqiz√´ district and those near Macedonia, there are a number of Golloborda Macedonian families who speak Macedonian. Most people in the district are Muslims who live amongst smaller communities of Roman Catholics, Evangelicals, and Orthodox Christians. Economy Mining has been central to Librazhd District since Roman times, in particular the mining of nickel, chromium, platinum, copper, bauxite and gold. Large mines operated in the area, in particular at Farret, Katjel, Bushtric, Hotolisht, Prrenjas, Dardh and Qarrisht. Most of these mines are now inactive. The district used to have a nationally famous tobacco industry. Wine is still produced and some timber mills are still active. Mineral water under the brand Sopoti is bottled at Spathar and is distributed throughout Albania. Because Librazhd is renowned for the medicinal qualities of its natural mineral water, the maintenance of the water industry makes Librazhd residents particularly proud.

Administrative centers are Pazin, Pula and Poreƒç. Istria County is the most prominent Italian-speaking part of Croatia. History The caves near Pula/Pola (in latinium Pietas Julia), Lim fjord, ≈†andalja and Roumald's cave, house Stone Age archaeological remains. Less ancient Stone Age sites, from the period between 6000 and 2000 BC, can also be found in the area. More than 400 locations are classified as Bronze Age (1800‚Äì1000 BC) items. Numerous findings including weapons, tools, and jewelry) which are from the earlier iron era around the beginning of common era. The Istrian peninsula was known to Romans as the terra magica. Its name is derived from the Histri, an Illyrian tribe who, as accounted by the geographer Strabo, lived in the region. Romans described them as pirates who were hard to conquer due to the difficulty of navigating their territory. After two military campaigns, Roman legions finally subdued them in 177 BC. With the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476, Istria was conquered by the Goths, and then by the Byzantines. During Byzantine rule, it was shortly ruled by Avars. Istria was annexed by the Lombards in 751, by the Avars in 774 and then by the Franks during the reign of Charlemagne in 789, then successively controlled by various dukes, (Carinthia, Merano, Bavaria), and the patriarchs of Aquileia. In 1267 the Republic of Venice annexed the western and southern coast of the Istrian peninsula because of the strong presence of the autochthonous Italian community; it was in this period that the region prospered. The major Istrian cities were reborn under Italian government, and it was in this half millennium that they developed architecturally and culturally. The eastern half of Istria was administered by the Habsburgs, and was referred to as \\"Imperial Istria\\" with its capital at Pisino (German: Mitterburg). In 1797, with the Treaty of Campo Formio written by Napoleon, the peninsula, with the whole Republic of Venice, passed to the Habsburgs of Austria. The Treaty of Pressburg in 1805 handed Istria to the Kingdom of Italy. The Treaty of Sch√∂nbrunn in 1809 transferred Istria to France. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna confirmed Austria's possession on the Northern Adriatic Sea with Istria, regional guvernative units were formed in Gorizia (Gorizia county), Trieste (Istrian area), Rijeka (Pazin county and Kvarner Gulf), from 1849 united in Austrian Littoral. Free port of Trieste presented individual guvernative unit, outside of other guvernative areas. Starting in 1861 till 1918/1920 the seat to a Regional Parliament in Austro-Hungarian Empire was in Parenzo (today: Poreƒç). After World War I, according to the peace treaty of Rapallo, Istria became part of Italy in 1920. Fascism and, later, Nazi occupation spoiled otherwise tolerant ethnic relations. After World War II, Istria was assigned to Yugoslavia and many ethnic Italians left in the Istrian exodus. With the collapse of Communist Yugoslavia, Istria became part of an independent Croatia and the region saw no fighting in the ensuing war. Today it is one of the economically most developed parts of Croatia. Personalities like Robert Koch and writer James Joyce lived and worked in Istria. Writer Jules Verne was inspired to write his novel Mathias Sandorf after hearing of quarry and cave in Pazin and the poet Dante Alighieri visited and wrote a few lines about Istria. Geography Map of Istria Its coastline is long with islands making up . A smaller part of Istria also belongs to the Primorje- Gorski Kotar County of Croatia. Mirroring the bay of Venice across the Adriatic and the Quarnaro Gulf, the region is not far from the Julian Alps (Alpi Giulie/Julijske Alpe). The westernmost point is at Savudrija while the southernmost is near Premantura, on the local promontory Kamenjak. The terrain consists of a limestone plateau, much of which lacks water owing to its karst topography. The northeastern section is an extension of the Dinaric Alps. The highest point is Vojak on Uƒçka mountain above sea level while another range of mountains is ƒÜiƒáarija. There are so called \\"bijela\\", \\"siva\\", \\"crvena\\" Istra (white, grey and red Istria). White Istria is around the mountain peaks, Grey Istria is the fertile inner lands while Red Istria is the blood-red painted lands of terra rossa or \\"crljenica\\" near the coastline. Sites such as the Grotto of Baredine near Poreƒç, the underground river Pazinƒçica and the karst Pazin pit (Pazinska jama) near Pazin are geologic attractions. The Limski Kanal is the only fjord resembling structure in continental Europe outside of Scandinavia (though actually not a fjord, but in fact a ria). The quarry near Rovinj/Rovigno d'Istria is specifically designed for studying geology. The longest river, the Mirna, is only long with its mouth near Novigrad/Cittanova d'Istria. Other rivers that pass through Istria include the Dragonja River and Ra≈°a River. The continental plains and valleys, are primarily utilized for agriculture, such as growing cereals and vegetables. Closer to the sea, red lands are used for cultivation of grapes, vine, olives and figs. Agriculture and the production of ecological food, the olive gardens, and the production of quality wines, is the focus of Istria's agriculture sector. The coastline and nearby islands are rich in the maquis shrubland (mostly holm oak and strawberry tree. Woods, mostly oak and pine trees, cover a third of the territory. The well-known natural reservations national park Brijuni and nature park Uƒçka are legally protected landscapes. This mountain range fed the rivers and lakes in the eastern side of Istria all the way to / river in the peninsula. Other interesting localities are Lim Kanal, wood near Motovun, park woods Zlatni Rt and ≈†ijana near Pula, protected landscape Kamenjak in the extreme south of Istria, the reservation Palud, (ornithology), near Rovinj. Brijuni archipelago is interesting as the habitat of about 680 plant species, also decorated by the most diverse vegetation and olive groves. Climate Protected from the north by the mountain chain of Alps as well the inner highland, the climate is Mediterranean, very pleasant, with the highest air temperature averaging 24 ¬∞C during August, and the lowest averaging 5 ¬∞C in January. Summers are usually warm during the day and cooler near the evening, although strange heat wave patterns are common. The weather also ranges from humid to dry with over 10 hours of sunshine daily. Primarily, there is a lot of moisture in the air, especially in the coastal towns of Istra such as Poreƒç, Vrsar, Rovinj, Pula and others. Temperatures above 10 ¬∞C last for more than 240 days a year. Excessive heat (above 30 ¬∞C) lasts for three weeks at most. Despite air temperatures being lower than those of in Dalmatia, the Adriatic sea is warmer, reaching up to 26 ¬∞C in August, coldest in March, (9-11 ¬∞C), while the freezing even in small, shallow bays is very rare. Two kinds of winds are here - the bora is bringing cold and clear weather from the north in winters, and the southern jugo (jug = south) bringing rain in summer. Maestral is the summer breeze blowing from the inland to the sea. The salinity of the sea water is 0.37%. Demographics According to 2011 census total population of Istria County is 208,055 which amounts to 4.85 percent of Croatia's entire population. Population density is 73 inhabitants per km2, with an average age of 43 years. Istria county is administratively subdivided into 41 local units of government - 10 of these are officially designated as cities/towns and 31 are largely rural municipalities. More than 70 percent of the county's population lives in these ten urban areas: *Pula / Pola (57,460) *Poreƒç / Parenzo (16,696) *Rovinj / Rovigno (14,294) *Umag / Umago (13,467) *Labin / Albona (11,642) *Pazin / Pisino (8,638) *Buzet / Pinguente (6,133) *Vodnjan / Dignano (6,119) *Buje / Buie (5,182) *Novigrad / Cittanova (4,345) There are also 31 municipalities: * Bale / Valle (1,127) * Barban/ Barbana (2,721) * Brtonigla / Verteneglio (1,626) * Cerovlje / Cerreto (1,677) * Fa≈æana / Fasana (3,635) * Graƒçi≈°ƒáe / Gallignana (1,419) * Gro≈ænjan / Grisignana (736) * Kanfanar / Canfanaro (1,543) * Karojba / Caroiba (1,438) * Ka≈°telir-Labinci / Castellier-Santa Domenica (1,463) * Kr≈°an / Chersano (2,951) * Lani≈°ƒáe / Lanischie (329) * Li≈ænjan / Lisignano (3,965) * Lupoglav / Lupogliano (924) * Marƒçana / Marzana (4,253) * Medulin / Medolino (6,481) * Motovun / Montona (1,004) * Oprtalj / Portole (850) * Piƒáan / Pedena (1,827) * Ra≈°a / Arsia (3,183) * Sveta Nedelja / Santa Domenica d'Albona (2,987) * Sveti Lovreƒç / San Lorenzo di Pesenatico (1,015) * Sveti Petar u ≈†umi / San Pietro di Selve (1,065) * Svetvinƒçenat / Sanvincenti (2,202) * Tar-Vabriga / Torre- Abrega (1,990) * Tinjan / Antignana (1,684) * Vi≈°njan / Visignano (2,274) * Vi≈æinada / Visinada (1,158) * Vrsar / Orsera (2,162) * ≈Ωminj / Gimino (3,483) * Funtana / Fontane (907) autochthonous Italian minority is displayed alongside Croatian and Istrian flags Besides official Croatian, the Chakavian dialect of the Croatian language is often in use, as in most coastal counties. Italian is also recognized in the county as an official language. Population pyramid of Istria County per the 2011 Census In 2011 the population was 208,055 and the main ethnic groups were as follows: * Croats ‚Äì 142,173 (68.33%) * Italians ‚Äì 12,543 (6.03%) * Serbs ‚Äì 7,206 (3.46%) * Bosniaks ‚Äì 6,146 (2.95%) * Albanians ‚Äì 2,393 (1.15%) Before World War I and until World War II, Istria contained a large autochthonous Romance language speaking community consisting of Venetian dialects, Istriot and Istro-Romanian along with Italian, plus various local Slavic dialects, some of which were likewise unique to Istria. Today, apart from the local dialects and the official Croatian language, one still finds in this region a small community of people, the Istro-Romanians, who speak the Istro-Romanian language, closely related to Romanian, other districts where Venetian dialects and Istriot are still spoken. Due to its traditional bond with Europe and its level of international integration, in 1994 Istria County was the first Croatian region to become a member of the Assembly of European Regions. Communication Istria is well connected with the rest of Croatia and Europe. Due to its connection with a wider European area, road development suitably covers all needs and contributes to a balanced development of the coastal area and the Istrian interior. Initially, the need for railroads in Istria was based upon fast development of industrial activities; shipbuilding, construction material, machine and electric industries, as well as Austrian military interests. After Vienna and Trieste were connected in 1876, the railway between Divaƒça, (in today's Slovenia) and Pula/Pola, ( long with long branch Kanfanar - Rovinj/Rovigno d'Istria), was opened. Despite numerous initiatives, the western part of Istria have been connected with the railroad only in 1902, with construction of the narrow-gauge track Poreƒç/Parenzo - Trieste. The long \\"Parenzana\\", or Parenzaner Bahn, was cancelled in 1935. To this day, Istria County's rail connections are only towards Slovenia, and despite the fact that some plans to build railroad tunnel through Uƒçka mountain date from decades ago, there are no projections about financing and works are not scheduled to start any time soon. The connection to the rest of Croatian rail network is by H≈Ω national railways' bus service from Lupoglav junction to Rijeka Station via Uƒçka road tunnel Croatian Istria County's highway system is callen \\"The Istrian Y\\". Highway A8 connects the county to the rest of Croatia from Rijeka/Matulji (A7/ further A6) interchange through Uƒçka Tunnel to Kanfanar interchange, and highway A9 connects Pula via Kanfanar to Umag, connecting the county to Slovenian Istria and further to Italy. The only significant airport with scheduled commercial service is Pula Airport. Large majority of flights are only seasonal. Economy Teran, red wine with controlled geographical origin, produced in specified region of Western Istria Well-developed are processing industry, with traditional agriculture, sea fishing and growing, construction and production of construction materials (lime, cement, brick, stone), trade and transport. Most developed branches of industry are shipbuilding (In the early 1970s its shipyard Uljanik was building the biggest ships in the world as Berge Adria and others), metal processing, wood industry, furniture industry, automotive components industry, electric machines and appliances industry, glass, plastic, textile, tobacco industry. According to economic indicators, the leading activities are processing industry, tourism, and trade. Great attention is being given to agriculture and the production of ecologic food, the wine and olive growing. Historically cultivated local wine varietals include Malvasia (white) and Teran (red). Tourism Organized tourism in Istria goes back to the Romans, when emperor Vespasian, for the entertainment of that time, built the amphitheater (Arena) in Pula/Pola. During the reign of Austro-Hungarian Empire in (1866), Austrian and Hungarian royalty and aristocracy started visiting local resorts and discovered Poreƒç/Parenzo. Significant efforts were made after World War II to develop the tourist infrastructure and to accentuate its importance. In combination with the natural environment, history and cultural heritage, investments resulted in developed and competitive service all along the western coast in Poreƒç/Parenzo, Pula/Pola, Rovinj/Rovigno d'Istria, Umag/Umago, Novigrad/Cittanova d'Istria, and Vrsar/Orsera. One growing trend among the centrally located cities, especially Kanfanar/Canfanaro, is agritourism. Beginning with La Casa di Matiki in 1994 after the war, a number of eccentric agritouristic Bed and Breakfasts have sprung up in central Istria, providing opportunities for individuals, couples, and families to experience a very authentic Istrian experience while learning about the Istrian agricultural lifestyle. In the eastern part, as part of another county, there are resorts like Rabac/Porto Albona, Opatija/Abbazia. Istria was and still is the most important tourist destination in Croatia, hosting the western and central European visitors, mostly from Germany, Slovenia, Austria and Italy. Area is the most visited tourist region with 27% of all visitors and 35% of time spent in all of Croatia.

She is notable as having been, from 2000 until 2005, the first woman to be Controller of BBC One, the primary television channel of the British Broadcasting Corporation. She has also served as the Chief Executive of the production company Talkback Thames. Heggessey is now the Chief Executive of The Royal Foundation. Early life, education and career Heggessey was educated at Vyners Grammar School in Ickenham, Hillingdon and later earned an Upper Second Class BA Honours degree in English Language & Literature from Durham University (Collingwood College), before beginning her career in local newspaper journalism. She worked initially for the Westminster Press Group, where her first job was as a trainee reporter on the Acton Gazette local newspaper. In 1978 she applied for a BBC News traineeship, but was rejected without an interview. She then worked voluntarily in hospital radio and gained a paid job on a local newspaper, before re-applying for the BBC traineeship the following year, this time successfully. She spent the next fifteen years working in current affairs programming in television.  Career =Current affairs By the early 1980s she had become a producer on the BBC's flagship current affairs series Panorama, before she left the staff of the BBC to join Thames Television's This Week, broadcast on the rival ITV network. She then moved on again, this time to the small independent production company Clark Productions, for whom she worked on Channel 4's current affairs programme Hard News. In the early 1990s, she and the film director Ken Loach collaborated on an edition of Hard News which investigated the treatment of trade unionist leader Arthur Scargill by The Daily Mirror newspaper and investigative journalist Roger Cook. When Cook declined to be interviewed for the programme, Heggessey, along with Ken Capstick, Vice President of the Yorkshire NUM, employed one of his own tactics from his television series The Cook Report, \\"doorstepping\\" him outside the Birmingham hotel in which he was staying and pursuing him, with a camera crew and asking questions, down the street as he walked away. She also worked on another Channel 4 documentary series, Dispatches, before returning to the BBC, where she founded the viewer feedback series Biteback. She also secured another notable television moment when she obtained the first interview with the notorious criminal \\"Mad\\" Frankie Fraser, for The Underworld documentary series. Working in the science department, she became Editor of the BBC One series QED, and then executive producer of the documentary series Animal Hospital and The Human Body. Children's BBC Heggessey was considering leaving the BBC again and returning to working in the independent sector, when she was offered the position of Head of Children's BBC. As her daughters were at the time aged four and eight, she decided to accept the role, later explaining that \\"Short of taking over Hamleys, this was the next best job for them.\\" She took up this post in 1997. It was as Head of Children's BBC that she became involved in the dismissal of Blue Peter presenter Richard Bacon. In October 1998, the News of the World newspaper revealed that Bacon had taken cocaine, and he was subsequently sacked from his job as a presenter on the high-profile children's programme. Heggessey appeared on-screen in a specially-recorded one-minute address to viewers shown directly before the first episode of Blue Peter to be screened following Bacon's sacking, on 19 October 1998, to explain to young viewers why Bacon had been dismissed, stating that he had \\"not only let himself and the team on Blue Peter down, but he has also let all of you down badly.\\" BBC One In 1999 she was promoted to Director of Programmes and Deputy Chief Executive of the BBC's in-house production arm, BBC Production, responsible for supervising in-house output across all the various genres. She was in this role for little over a year however before she was promoted to Controller of BBC One, a post she took up on 1 November 2000. In this position she was responsible for co-commissioning the channel's output with the various heads of department -- drama, news, etc. -- and deciding the channel's overall strategy and schedule. She had previously been sounded out about the job in 1997, after Michael Jackson's departure, but had turned down the opportunity as she felt she was then not yet experienced enough. During Heggessey's five years in charge, BBC One's audience share fell by 19.9%, to 23%, although this was in the context of declining audience figures across all British television channels due to increased competition from multichannel digital television. However, in 2001 BBC One overtook its main rival ITV1 in terms of annual audience share for the first time since the rival channel had launched in 1955, although much of this was down to the success of the channel's daytime television line-up, which had its own Controller in Jane Lush. When Heggessey arrived at the channel in November 2000, she inherited two controversial schedule changes which had been implemented the previous month, at the behest of Director-General of the BBC Greg Dyke; the main evening BBC News bulletin had been moved from 9pm to 10pm, and Panorama moved from a Monday night prime time slot to a later slot on Sunday nights. The moving of Panorama attracted criticism that BBC One was sidelining serious programming in favour of more populist output. Heggessey publicly defended the decision despite it not being hers, claiming that Panorama's ratings would have \\"dwindled\\" in its previous slot. Heggessey and the BBC's Controller of Drama Commissioning, Jane Tranter, took advantage of the weekday 9pm slot opened up by the moving of the news to commission new popular drama output, such as the successful Waking the Dead (2000-2011) and Spooks (2002-2011). Celebrity dancing show Strictly Come Dancing (2004-present) was also a popular success on Saturday nights, although another Saturday night entertainment series, Fame Academy, faced accusations of being too derivative of the output of commercial rivals, and during Heggessey's era the channel frequently came under attack for being too populist and not providing enough serious programming. Heggessey did later concede in a 2005 interview with The Independent newspaper that arts programming had suffered a cutback under her control of BBC One. However, she did respond to this omission following criticism from the Board of Governors of the BBC by commissioning programmes such as the arts documentary series Imagine... (2003-present) and A Picture of Britain (2005). During her early days at BBC One, Heggessy criticized the \\"Balloon\\" idents the channel had been using for its between-programme idents since 1997 for being \\"slow and distant\\" and so, in 2002, after much speculation, she took the decision to abandon the \\"Balloon\\" idents (and the traditional \\"Globe\\" idents the channel had used in a variety of forms since 1963). They were replaced by a new style of on-air identity for the channel, the \\"Rhythm & Movement\\" idents. The new idents attracted some criticism for going against the traditions of the channel and pandering to political correctness, as they featured activities performed by people of various ethnicities. One of Heggessey's most notable decisions and last major success at the channel was the re-commissioning of the science- fiction drama series Doctor Who, which had been a popular hit in previous decades but ceased production in 1989. Heggessey and Jane Tranter commissioned a new version of the series in September 2003, after Heggessey had spent two years persuading the BBC's commercial arm, BBC Worldwide, to abandon their attempts to make a feature film version of the programme and allow it instead to return to BBC One. The new version of Doctor Who (2005-present) debuted on 26 March 2005 and became a critical and popular hit, with Paul Hoggart of The Times newspaper describing the series as \\"a joyful, exuberant reinvention and a fine legacy from Ms Heggessey.\\" On 14 February 2005 it was announced that Lorraine Heggessey was to leave the BBC to take up the post of Chief Executive at production company Talkback Thames. She left on 15 April. Five months after her departure, BBC One was named \\"Channel of the Year\\" at the Edinburgh Television Festival, primarily on the strength of Heggessey commissions such as Strictly Come Dancing and Doctor Who. Talkback Thames At Talkback Thames, Heggessey was responsible for overseeing the production of high- profile programmes such as ITV1's The Bill and The X Factor, BBC One's QI and Channel 4's Green Wing. She was also responsible for delivering to BBC One in early 2006 two Stephen Poliakoff dramas that she herself had commissioned before she left the channel, Friends and Crocodiles and Gideon's Daughter, the latter of which went on to win two Golden Globe Awards (Mini-series, Best Actor for Bill Nighy and Mini-series, Best Supporting Actress for Emily Blunt) in 2007. In June 2010 it was announced that she was leaving her post of Chief Executive with Talkback Thames. Boom Pictures Heggessey returned to the television industry in July 2012, when she became co-owner and Executive Chairman of the new Cardiff-based independent production company Boom Pictures. In June 2014 Heggessey left the company, the success created by her led to its subsequent acquisition by ITV Studios. The Royal Foundation In April 2017, Heggessey was appointed Chief Executive of The Royal Foundation, the primary philanthropic and charitable vehicle for The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and The Duke and Duchess of Sussex. She left the position on 1 October 2019.  Personal life  Heggessy is married to Ron de Jong, a musician and composer, and they have two daughters.

Indo-European peoples in Syrmia.  Prehistory  Between 3000 BC and 2400 BC, Syrmia was at the centre of Indo- European Vuƒçedol culture.Syrmia, vjesnik.hr; accessed 13 April 2015.  Roman era  Ancient Roman cities in Syrmia Sirmium was conquered by Romans in the first century BC and became the economic and political capital of Pannonia. In 6 AD, there was an uprising of the indigenous peoples against Roman rule. However, ten later Roman Emperors were born in Sirmium or nearby. They included Herennius Etruscus (227-251), Hostilian (230?-251), Decius Traian (249-251), Claudius II (268-270), Quintillus (270), Aurelian (270-275), Probus (276-282), Maximianus Herculius (285-310), Constantius II (337-361) and Gratian (367-383). These emperors were mostly Romanised Illyrians.  Early Middle Ages  In the 6th century, Syrmia was part of the Byzantine province of Pannonia. During that time, Byzantine rule was challenged by Ostrogoths and Gepids. In 567, Byzantine rule was fully restored, although it later collapsed during the Siege of Sirmium by Avars and Slavs (582). It remained under Avar rule up to c. 800, when it came under the control of the Frankish Empire. In 827, Bulgars invaded Syrmia and continued to rule after a peace treaty in 845 AD. The region was later incorporated into the Principality of Lower Pannonia, but during the 10th century it became a battleground between Hungarians, Bulgarians, and Serbs. At the beginning of the 11th century, the ruler of Syrmia was Duke Sermon, vassal of the Bulgarian emperor Samuil. There had been Bulgar resistance to Byzantine rule. This collapsed and Sermon, who refused to capitulate was captured and killed by Constantine Diogenes. A new but ultimately short lived area of governance named the Thema of Sirmium was established. It included the region of Syrmia and what is now Maƒçva. In 1071, Hungarians took over the region of Syrmia, but Byzantine Empire reconquered the province after the victory over the Hungarians in the Battle of Syrmia (1167). Byzantine rule ended in 1180, when Syrmia was taken again by the Hungarians.  Late Middle Ages  In the 13th century, the region was controlled by the Kingdom of Hungary. On 3 March 1229, the acquisition of Syrmia was confirmed by Papal bull. Pope Gregory IX wrote, \\"[Margaretha] soror‚Ä¶regis Ungarie [acquired] terram‚Ä¶ulterior Sirmia\\".\\"Margit of Hungary\\" FMG Accessed 13 April 2015. In 1231, The Duke of Syrmia was Giletus. In the 1200s, the territory around Syrmia was divided into two counties: Syrmia in the east and Valk√≥ (Vukovar) in the west. In the 13th century, between 1282 and 1316, Syrmia was ruled by Stefan Dragutin of Serbia.Veselinoviƒá R. Istorija Srpske pravoslavne crkve sa narodnom istorijom I Belgrade, 1969. p18.Grujiƒá R. Pravoslavna Srpska crkva, Kragujevac, 1989, p22. Initially, Dragutin was a vassal of Hungary but later ruled independently. Dragutin died in 1316, and was succeeded by his son, Stefan Vladislav II (1316‚Äì1325). In 1324, Vladislav II was defeated by Stefan Uro≈° III Deƒçanski of Rascia. Lower Syrmia became the subject of dispute between the Kingdoms of Rascia and Hungary. Realm of Stefan Dragutin Realms of Stefan Dragutin and Ugrin Cs√°k In 1404, Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor ceded part of Syrmia to Stefan Lazareviƒá of Serbia and then to ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá. From 1459, the Hungarian kings endorsed the House of Brankoviƒá and later, the Berislaviƒái Grabarski family as the titular heads of the Serbian Despotate of which Syrmia was a part. They resided in Kupinik (modern Kupinovo). The local rulers included Vuk Grgureviƒá (1471 to 1485); ƒêorƒëe Brankoviƒá (1486 to 1496), Jovan Brankoviƒá (1496 to 1502), Ivani≈° Berislaviƒá (1504 to 1514), and Stjepan Berislaviƒá (1520 to 1535). In 1522, the last of the titular Serbian despots in Syrmia, Stjepan Berislaviƒá, moved to Slavonia, ahead of invading Ottoman forces. Another important local governor was Laurence of Ilok, Duke of Syrmia (1477 to 1524), who reigned over large parts of the region from Ilok.  Early modern period  In 1521, parts of Syrmia fell to the Ottomans and by 1538, the entire region was under Ottoman control. Between 1527 and 1530, Radoslav ƒåelnik ruled Syrmia as an Ottoman vassal. The area of Ottoman administration in Syrmia was known as the Sanjak of Syrmia. In 1699, the Habsburg Monarchy took western Syrmia from the Ottomans as part of the Treaty of Karlowitz.Stoye J. Marsigli's Europe, 1680-1730 Yale University Press, 1994 p185 , 9780300055429 Accessed at Google Books 3 August 2016. Until the Treaty of Passarowitz at the end of the Austro- Turkish War of 1716-18, remainder of Syrmia was part of the Habsburg Military Frontier. At the end of the Austro-Russian-Turkish War of 1735‚Äì1739, there was a migration of Albanians from the Kelmendi tribe to Syrmia, who were recorded as speaking Albanian as late as 1921.Gottlieb von Windisch: On the Kelmendi in Syrmia In 1745, the County of Syrmia was established as part of the Habsburg's Kingdom of Slavonia.

In 1848 and 1849, most of Syrmia was part of the Serbian Voivodship, a Serb autonomous region within the Austrian Empire. From 1849 and 1860, Northern Syrmia, including Ilok and Ruma were part of the Voivodship of Serbia and Tami≈° Banat. After 1860, the County of Syrmia was re-established and returned to the Kingdom of Slavonia. In 1868, the Kingdom of Slavonia became part of Croatia-Slavonia in the Kingdom of Hungary.  20th century  On 29 October 1918, Syrmia became a part of the newly independent State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. On 24 November 1918, the Assembly of Syrmia proclaimed the unification of Serb-populated parts of Syrmia with the Kingdom of Serbia. However, from 1 December 1918, all of Syrmia was made a part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. From 1918 to 1922, Syrmia remained within the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and from 1922 to 1929, Syrmia was a province (oblast). In 1929, after a new territorial division, Syrmia was divided between Danube Banovina and Drina Banovina, in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and in 1931, it was divided between Danube Banovina and Sava Banovina. In 1939, the western part of Syrmia was included into the newly formed Banovina of Croatia. In 1941, Syrmia was occupied by the World War II Axis powers and its entire territory was ceded to the Independent State of Croatia, a Nazi puppet state. The fascist Ustashe regime systematically murdered Serbs (as part of the Genocide of the Serbs), Jews (The Holocaust), Roma (The Porajmos), and some political dissidents. In 1945, with the creation of new borders, eastern Syrmia became part of the People's Republic of Serbia, while western Syrmia became part of the People's Republic of Croatia. On August 1942, following the joint military anti- partisan operation in the Syrmia by the Ustashe and German Wehrmacht, it turned into a massacre by the Ustasha militia that left up to 7,000 Serbs dead. Among those killed was the prominent painter Sava ≈†umanoviƒá, who was arrested along with 150 residents of ≈†id. In 1991, Croatia declared its independence. The Serbs self-proclaimed in one part western Syrmia an autonomous region called the \\"Serbian Autonomous Region of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia\\". This region was one of the two Serbian autonomous regions that formed the self-declared and unrecognized Republic of Serbian Krajina. The autonomous regions lasted until 1995, when it was reintegrated in Croatia.The region was ethnically cleansed of its Croat and some other non- Serb population leading to some of the most serious violation of human rights including Erdut killings, Lovas killings, Dalj massacre, Tovarnik massacre, Vukovar massacre and other crimes.

Geography The majority of Syrmia is located in the Srem district of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina in Serbia. A smaller area around Novi Sad is part of the South Baƒçka district, and another smaller area around Novi Beograd, Zemun, and Surƒçin belongs to the City of Belgrade. The remaining part of Syrmia is part of the Vukovar-Srijem County in Croatia. Borders Srem District in Vojvodina Vukovar-Srijem county within Croatia The present international border of the region of Syrmia was drawn in 1945 by the ƒêilas commission. It divided the Yugoslav constituent republic of Croatia and the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, itself part of Serbia, within Yugoslavia. Milovan ƒêilas, a Montenegrin and then a confidante of Josip Broz Tito, drew the border according to demographic criteria, which explains why the town of Ilok on the Danube, with a Croat majority, lies east of ≈†id in Serbia, with a Serb majority. The border drawn in 1945 was very similar to the 1931-1939 border between the Danube Banovina and the Sava Banovina within the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.  Bordering regions  * Baƒçka to the north * Banat to the east * ≈†umadija the south-east * Maƒçva to the south * Semberija to the south-west * Slavonia to the west. The border between Syrmia and Slavonia is unclear. It runs approximately along a line through Vukovar, Vinkovci, and ≈Ωupanja or it follows the Bosut, Barica and Vuka rivers.

It has the distinction of being the first operational jet bomber to enter service with the United States Air Force (USAF), as well as being the first multiengine jet bomber in the world to be refueled in midair. The B-45 originated from a wartime initiative launched by the U.S. War Department, which sought a company to develop a jet-propelled bomber to equal those being fielded by Nazi Germany, such as the Arado Ar 234. Following a competitive review of the submissions, the War Department issued a contract to North American to develop its NA-130 proposal; on 8 September 1944, work commenced on the assembly of three prototypes. However, progress on the program was delayed by post-war cutbacks in defense expenditure, but soon regained importance due to growing tensions between America and the Soviet Union. On 2 January 1947, North American was issued with a production contract for the bomber by the USAF, which had been designated B-45A. On 24 February 1947, the first prototype performed its maiden flight. Soon after its entry to service on 22 April 1948, early B-45 operations were troubled by technical problems, particularly low levels of engine reliability. The USAF found the type to be quite useful during the Korean War; it was used to perform both conventional bombing and aerial reconnaissance missions in this theatre. On 4 December 1950, the first successful interception of a jet bomber by a jet fighter occurred when a B-45 was shot down by a Soviet-built MiG-15 while inside Chinese airspace. During the early 1950s, a total of 40 B-45s were extensively modified so that they could be equipped with nuclear weapons; for this purpose, improvements were made to their defensive systems and the fuel tankage was expanded to increase the type's survivability and range. In its heyday, the B-45 became an important element of the United States' defense strategy, performing the strategically-critical deterrence mission for several years during the early 1950s, after which time the Tornado was quickly superseded by the larger and more capable Boeing B-47 Stratojet. Both bomber- orientated B-45s and reconnaissance-orientated RB-45s served in quantity in the USAF's Strategic Air Command from 1950 until 1959. The USAF withdrew the last examples of the type in favour of the more advanced Convair B-58 Hustler, an early supersonic bomber. The Tornado was also adopted by the Royal Air Force (RAF) and operated from bases in Britain, where it was repeatedly used to overfly the Soviet Union on various intelligence-related missions. The RAF operated the type until it had introduced its own indigenously-developed jet bomber fleet, initially in the form of the English Electric Canberra. Development=Background Development of what would become the B-45 was stimulated by a request issued by the U.S. War Department during World War II. There had been a rapid emergence of various new aviation technologies throughout this period, and figures within the US were keen to keep up with the latest advances and introduce them to their own armed forces. Having been alarmed by the emergence of German jet bombers, such as the Arado Ar 234, the War Department issued a request for the development and production of a new family of jet-powered bombers. During October 1944, the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF) issued a mission-need statement for such a bomber; on 17 November 1944, this was furthered by the release of a formal requirement, which has been claimed to have been the first requirement to be issued outside of Germany for such an aircraft. The requirements involved more than just the use of jet propulsion; the desired aircraft was to possess a gross weight of between 80,000 lb (36,287 kg) and 200,000 lb (90,718 kg), which would make it a light bomber in terms of weight for the era. Aircraft manufacturer North American Aviation chose to design their own submission, which was internally designated NA-130. This bid, along with three rival proposals from other firms, would be met with orders from the government. On 8 September 1944, the company commenced production of three prototypes based on its NA-130 design. According to aviation authors Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist, the NA-130 was viewed as being \\"merely a traditional bomber on to which jet engines had been fitted...the first effective jet bomber in the world, a case of the right aircraft at the right time\\".Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 25. The end of the conflict soon resulted in the cancellation of many projects, as well as delays being imposed upon many others that had persisted. In 1946, rising tension with the Soviet Union caused the USAAF to assign a higher priority to both jet bomber development and production programmes. By mid-1946, both the XB-45 and the rival Convair XB-46 were nearing completion; while the Boeing XB-47 and Martin XB-48 were also in development, it was recognised that they were both at least two years away. Thus, the USAAF chose to evaluate the first two designs to determine which would be superior operationally. The B-45 proved a superior design; specifically, work on the project was at a more advanced stage than that of its rivals, while it was also recognised to be cheaper to develop. Accordingly, on 2 January 1947, a contract for immediate production of B-45As was signed. Early plans called for the type to equip five light bomb groups and three light reconnaissance groups; despite this apparent vote of confidence, the B-45 was commonly viewed as being little more than an interim aircraft while more advanced designs, namely the B-47, were taking longer to develop. Into flight A preserved USAF B-45C Tornado at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force, Dayton, Ohio Following the completion of the first prototype at North American's facility in Inglewood, it was delivered by road in sections to Muroc Field, where it was reassembled and readied for flight testing. On 17 March 1947, the first prototype, piloted by George Krebs and Paul Brewer, conducted the type's maiden flight. Gunston and Gilchrist observe the flight test programme to have been fraught with technical issues and setbacks, the most dramatic being the total loss of the first prototype; despite these problems, due to political pressure for the programme to be delivered quickly, work continued at a frantic pace to get a production aircraft qualified for service.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 26. However, as the development and flight-testing of the rival B-47 was proving to be largely positive, news that made its own future production all but certain, the necessity and future of the B-45 became increasingly uncertain. During mid-1948, the U.S. Air Staff began to openly question its value; soon afterwards, President Truman's budget restraints reduced Air Force expenditure, which drove a decision to curtail B-45 production to a total of 142 airframes. During 1950, further budget cuts compelled the Aircraft and Weapons Board to cancel 51 of the 190 aircraft on order. The cancellation of these 51 B-45s was announced on 7 January 1949.Associated Press. \\"51-Jet Bomber Contract Killed ‚Äì North American To Lay Off 2,600.\\" The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Saturday 8 January 1949, Volume LV. Number 112. A total of 96 aircraft were delivered between February 1948 and June 1949. Multiple improved models of the B-45 were proposed by North American, some of which were built and put into service. While the conceptual B-45B, which would have been equipped with a radar-guided fire control system, would never be ordered, the more advanced B-45C did secure an order. This variant featured a strengthened airframe, tip tanks for greater fuel capacity, and more powerful General Electric J47-15 (or ‚àí15) turbojet engines, as well as other improvements; only 10 would be delivered from an order of 43. Perhaps the most notable variant was the RB-45C, a dedicated reconnaissance aircraft that lacked a bombing capability; 33 aircraft were delivered.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 27. The B-45 was later replaced by the supersonic Convair B-58 Hustler. Operational history=Korean War Early operations of the B-45 were continuously plagued by engine problems which, along with numerous other minor flaws, undermined the usefulness of the bomber. However, the type regained much of its prior importance when the United States chose to enter the Korean War during 1950. In this theatre, the B-45 proved its value both as a bomber and as a reconnaissance aircraft. The mass deployment of U.S. forces to the fighting on the Korean peninsula revealed the vulnerability of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) forces in Europe to a potential Soviet attack; this realisation was a major contributing factor to the USAF's decision regarding the future of the B-45. The B-45, like most post-World War II American bombers, could carry both nuclear and conventional bombs. The progress of weapons technology had led to a great reduction in both the weight and size of nuclear weapons in the U.S. inventory, which effectively enabled smaller aircraft such as the B-45 to carry out nuclear strikes, a mission which had initially been confined to heavy bombers. Suddenly, the small fleet of B-45s once again possessed considerable value as a nuclear deterrent. A USAF B-45C Tornado in flight On 4 December 1950, the first successful interception of a jet bomber by a jet fighter occurred when MiG-15 pilot Aleksandr F. Andrianov shot down an RB-45C over China. Captain Charles McDonough was the only member of the four-man crew that had been able to parachute from the plane, although McDonough is believed to have died while being detained by either the Chinese or the Soviet Union. Due to the hostilities, the United States and China being on opposing sides, as well as the sensitivity typically surrounding such missions, much of the information surrounding this flight and similar intelligence activities has remained classified.https://web.archive.org/web/20130604071241/http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_315.shtmlBurnes, Robert. \\"Mystery of Korean War‚Äôs Secret Air Force Mission Is Unraveled : Military: Relatives say they finally have pieced together how a U.S. spy plane and its crew members were shot down in 1950 by the Soviets.\\" Los Angeles Times, 18 December 1994. Operation Fandango, sometimes called Operation Backbreaker, entailed modifications to the aircraft for nuclear missions. In addition, the 40 B-45s allocated to the program were equipped with a new defensive system and additional fuel tankage. Despite the magnitude of the modifications project, plus ongoing problems with the early jet engines, nuclear-capable B-45s began reaching the United Kingdom in May 1952, and deployment of the 40 aircraft was completed in mid-June. It was at about this same time that RB-45s of the 323rd Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron began to arrive in Japan to fly alongside the 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron, supplementing the World War II-era piston-engine RB-29s which had proved to be easy targets for North Korean MiGs.FAS: RB-45 The RB-45s provided valuable intelligence throughout the remainder of the Korean War, despite the limited number of airframes available. RB-45Cs flew many daylight missions until early 1952, when they were switched to night operations after an RB-45 was almost lost to a MiG-15. Postwar Flightline photo of B-45A-5-NA Tornadoes of the 47th Light Bomb Wing, Langley Air Force Base, Va., before transatlantic flight to Sculthorpe, England, in July 1952. All 33 RB-45Cs built were assigned to the 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Wing's 322nd, 323rd and 324th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadrons. The RB-45C also flew several long-range reconnaissance missions over the Soviet Union during the mid-1950s. On July 29, 1952, an RB-45C made the first non-stop trans-Pacific flight, having been refueled twice by KB-29s along the way. Maj. Lou Carrington and his crew of the 91st Reconnaissance Wing flew from Alaska to Japan in 9 hrs 50 mins, winning the MacKay Trophy for their achievement. Within the 91st SRW, by 1954 the RB-45C had been replaced by the RB-47E. The phased-out RB-45Cs then went to the 19th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, which operated them until they were withdrawn from operational use in the spring of 1958. By the end of the 1950s, all B-45s had been removed from active service. However, a few continued to act as test aircraft into the early 1970s.Strategic Air & Space Museum: B-45C Operation Ju-jitsu The only other nation to use the RB-45C was the United Kingdom, where it was operated by an ad hoc unit of crews largely drawn from Nos. 35 and 115 squadrons. Whilst the USAF was prohibited by the President of the United States from overflying the Soviet Union unless under a state of war, US allies closer to the European theatre of war could. In the United Kingdom, whilst successive Labour governments had refused, the return of Winston Churchill and a Conservative administration to Downing Street brought a more co-operative atmosphere to joint intelligence initiatives. As a result, under Operation Ju-jitsu, in July 1951 four aircraft were leased to Britain from the 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Wing to form 'Special Duties Flight, Sculthorpe', commanded by Squadron Leader John Crampton. Stripped of all USAF markings and then applied with RAF markings, the four aircraft were attached to a USAF squadron based at RAF Sculthorpe, Norfolk in eastern England. The aircraft were tasked with flying deep-level reconnaissance missions over the Soviet Union to gather electronic and photographic intelligence. The Special Duties Flight conducted missions during the period 1952‚Äì54. On April 17, 1952, three aircraft were assigned to head for Kiev from Germany, scheduled to return to Sculthorpe ten hours later. Flying at , Crampton's aircraft was tracked by ground radar and came under antiaircraft fire. Applying full power, he immediately turned and headed for Germany, none too soon, as Soviet night fighters had been dispatched to hunt down his aircraft. Subsequent flights over the Soviet Union were carried out using English Electric Canberras under the codename Project Robin, operating at higher altitudes of around . It was not until 1994 (under the \\"fifty-year rule\\" of the Public Records Act 1958) that the existence of the spy missions became public knowledge. Variants=XB-45 The first flight of the XB-45 was on February 24, 1947 from Muroc Army Air Field. A total of 131 test flights were flown by the three prototype aircraft, one being destroyed early on, killing two pilots. The USAF accepted one of the two surviving aircraft on July 30, 1948, the other on August 31. One was damaged beyond repair in an accident. The last XB-45 was delivered to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in 1949. It proved excessively difficult to maintain and was relegated as a ground trainer. * 3 aircraft (45-59479 ‚Äì 45-59481) B-45A The B-45A differed from the XB-45 in having improved ejection seats and communications equipment, an E-4 automatic pilot and bombing navigation radar. The first production B-45 flew in February 1948, and the Air Force took delivery of 22 B-45s in April 1948. Powered by J35 turbojets and not considered combat-ready, they were assigned to training duties and to conduct various test programs. The next batch were powered by the more powerful J47 turbojets. The first B-45As entered service in November 1948 with the 47th Bombardment Group, and the initial order of 96 was completed in March 1950. The first B-45As were not equipped with bomb fire control systems or bombsights. They suffered from gyrocompass failures at high speeds, unhooked bomb shackles, engine fires, and inaccurate cockpit gauges. The AN/APQ-24 bombing and navigation radar on some B-45s was maintenance heavy, and malfunctions in the pressurization limited the altitude at which the aircraft could operate. Fifty-five nuclear-capable B-45s arrived in the United Kingdom in 1952. These were modified with a 1,200 gal (4,542 l) fuel tank in the aft bomb bay. Despite technical problems, these were Tactical Air Command's first-line deterrent in Europe. * 96 aircraft (47-001 ‚Äì 47-097) : B-45A-1 47-001 ‚Äì 47-022 (21 aircraft) : B-45A-5 47-023 ‚Äì 47-096 (73 aircraft) : B-45A 47-097 (static test airframe) B-45B The B-45B was a proposed variant of the B-45A with improved radar and fire-control systems. None were built.Baugher: B-45B B-45C Development model of RB-45C 48-017 The B-45C was the first multiengine jet bomber in the world to be refueled in midair. It carried two 1,200 gal (4,542 l) wingtip fuel tanks, had a strengthened canopy, and an inflight refueling receptacle. The first B-45C was flown on May 3, 1949. Only ten were built, and the remaining 33 under construction were converted to RB-45Cs. * Ten aircraft (48-001 ‚Äì 48-010) RB-45C The RB-45C was the final production variant of the B-45. The bombardier's canopy was faired over and replaced with an Oblique camera system. The RB-45C carried two 214 gal (810 l) external fuel tanks, or two JATO rockets. It could carry up to 12 cameras in four positions, or a single camera with a 100 in (2.5 m) focal length lens. The RB-45C first flew in April 1950, and was delivered from June 1950 to October 1951. Thirty-eight were built, including the 33 converted from B-45Cs. It was this variant that was operated (clandestinely) over the Soviet Union by the RAF \\"special duties\\" unit at RAF Sculthorpe, with the first sortie of three aircraft commanded by Squadron Leader John Crampton taking place on the night of April 17, 1952. * 33 aircraft (48-011 ‚Äì 48-043)Aircraft Serial Number Search, B-45 Operators ; *Royal Air Force **No. 35 Squadron RAF crews grouped into ad hoc units operated RB-45C variant. **No. 115 Squadron RAF crews grouped into ad hoc units operated RB-45C variant. ; Tactical Air Command * 47th Bombardment Group (later Wing), B-45A, 1949-1957 : Langley AFB, Virginia 1949-1952 : RAF Sculthorpe, England, 1952-1957 :: 84th Bombardment Squadron :: 85th Bombardment Squadron :: 86th Bombardment Squadron, 1949, 1954‚Äì1957 :: 422d Bombardment Squadron, 1953‚Äì1954 : 86th Bomb Squadron operated from RAF Alconbury, England, 1955‚Äì1959 * 19th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, RB-45C 1953‚Äì1957 : Ninth Air Force (Attached to 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing) :: Shaw AFB, South Carolina, 1953‚Äì1954 : Third Air Force (Attached to 47th Bombardment Wing) :: RAF Sculthorpe, England, 1954‚Äì1957 Strategic Air Command * 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Group (Later Wing) B/RB-45C, 1950‚Äì1953 : Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, 1950‚Äì1951 : Lockbourne AFB, Ohio, 1951‚Äì1953 :: 322d Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron :: 323d Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron :: 324th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron : Note: Operated frequently from RAF Sculthorpe, England; Yokota AB and Johnson AB, Japan (1950‚Äì1952) * 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron, RB-45C, 1952‚Äì1954 : Fifteenth Air Force (Attached to Far East Air Forces) :: Yokota AB, Japan (Combat in Korean War) Air Defence Command *4750th Tow Target Squadron :Yuma AFB, Arizona, 1954‚Äì1957 Aircraft on display B-45C, AF Ser.

The B-66 was developed for the United States Air Force (USAF) and is heavily based upon the United States Navy's A-3 Skywarrior, a heavy carrier-based attack aircraft. Originally, officials intended for the aircraft to be a simple development of the earlier A-3, taking advantage of being strictly land-based to dispense with unnecessary naval features. However, due to the USAF producing extensive and substantially divergent requirements, it became necessary to make considerable alterations to the design, leading to a substantial proportion of the B-66 being original rather than derived from the A-3. The B-66 retained the three-man crew arrangement of the US Navy's A-3; differences included the incorporation of ejection seats, which the A-3 had lacked. Performing its maiden flight on 28 June 1954, the aircraft was introduced to USAF service during 1956. The standard model, designated B-66, was a bomber model that was procured to replace the aging Douglas A-26 Invader; in parallel, a dedicated photo reconnaissance model, designated RB-66, was also produced alongside. Later on, further variants of the type were developed, leading to the aircraft's use in signals intelligence, electronic countermeasures and weather reconnaissance roles. Aircraft would commonly be forward deployed to bases in Europe, where they could more easily approach the airspace of the Soviet Union. Multiple variants would be deployed around Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis. They would also see use during the American intervention in the Vietnam War, typically operating as support aircraft for other assets that were active over the skies of North Vietnam. The last examples of the type were withdrawn during 1975. Design and development=Background Early on in the United States Navy's A-3 Skywarrior's development, several officials within the United States Air Force (USAF) had been sceptical of the design, some regarding its relatively low take-off weight of 68,000lb as being impossible to achieve. In one instance, USAF general Hoyt Vandenberg ridiculed the proposed A-3 as \\"making irresponsible claims\\".Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 129. This hostile climate may be a result of the A-3 being intended to be operated from the planned United States-class \\"supercarriers,\\" to which numerous high-ranking officials within the USAF were frequently critical of and were campaigning for the latter's cancellation, which eventually happened.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 128. However, as the flight test program only validated its performance, it was recognised that the A-3 was capable of carrying out the same mission profile of the USAF's much larger Boeing B-47 Stratojet over an unrefuelled combat radius of almost 1,000 miles. Coupled with the development costs having already been paid by the Navy, the cost and performance of a land-based A-3 derivative was quite promising, especially in light of the USAF's pressing needs from the Korean War. Accordingly, during the early 1950s, the service openly expressed interest in procuring its own version of the A-3 to perform land-based missions for the USAF.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 161. Redesign USAF officials had originally intended the conversion to be a relatively straightforward matter of removing the carrier-specific features and fitting USAF avionics, but otherwise adhering as closely as possible to the original A-3 design. For this reason, no prototypes were ordered when the USAF issued its contract to Douglas in June 1952, instead having opted for five pre-production RB-66A models to be supplied, the aerial reconnaissance mission being considered to be a high priority for the type. However, this contract would be amended, involving multiple new variants that were added and swapped about. Likewise, the list of modifications sought quickly expanded; to meet the changing requirements, the supposedly easy conversion would become what was essentially an entirely new aircraft. A percentage of the changes made were a result of the USAF's requirement for the B-66 to perform low-level operations, the complete opposite of the US Navy's A-3, which had been developed and operated as a high-altitude nuclear strike bomber. However, aviation authors Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist attribute many of the design changes to have been made \\"merely to be different\\", being driven by an intense rivalry between the two services; they conclude that \\"an objective assessment might conclude that 98 per cent of the changes introduced in the RB-66A were unnecessary\\".Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 161-162. Both the fuselage and wing were entirely redesigned from scratch, rather than simply de- navalised.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 162. The A-3 was powered by a pair of Pratt & Whitney J57 turbojet engines, whereas the B-66 used two Allison J71 engines; Gunston and Gilchrist note that this engine swap \\"offered no apparent advantage\\", generating less thrust and being more fuel-hungry than the J57 engine which was also already in USAF use. Due to the engine change, this necessitated a complete redesign of the power systems as well, repositioning all hydraulic pumps and generators onto the engines themselves instead of being fed with bleed air from within the fuselage. The pressurized crew compartment was given a different structure, adopting a very deep glazed front position for the pilot. The landing gear was also redesigned, even implementing a completely different door geometry.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 162-163. An impactful difference was the decision to equip the B-66 with ejection seats, a feature which the A-3 had lacked entirely. Aviation authors Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist observe of the B-66 that: \\"The history of the aviation is sprinkled with aircraft which, to save money, were intended to be merely a modified version of an existing type. In very few cases it actually happened like this... the B-66 is a classic example\\". Into flight On 28 June 1954, the first of the RB-66A pre-production aircraft conducted its maiden flight, development being only slightly behind schedule despite the substantial redesign work involved.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 163. The test program conducted with the five pre-production aircraft heavily contributed to improvements introduced upon the subsequent production aircraft. On 4 January 1955, the first production B-66B aircraft, which featured an increased gross weight and numerous other refinements, performed its first flight. Deliveries of the B-66B commenced on 16 March 1956. However, the USAF decided to curtail the bomber variant's procurement, cancelling a further 69 B-66Bs and largely relegating the model for use in various test programs. Once in service, the aircraft's design proved to be relatively versatile. The principal production model was the RB-66B, which incorporated the bomber version's upgrades. Furthermore, it was either produced or retrofitted into a variety of other versions, including the EB-66, RB-66, and the WB-66. Likewise, many variants of the US Navy's A-3 Skywarrior were also produced. Operational history RB-66B of 19 Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron based at RAF Sculthorpe England in 1957 During 1956, deliveries to the USAF commenced. A total of 145 RB-66Bs would be produced. In service, the RB-66 would function as the primary night photo-reconnaissance aircraft of the USAF during this period; accordingly, many examples served with tactical reconnaissance squadrons based overseas, typically being stationed in the United Kingdom and West Germany. A total of 72 of the B-66B bomber version were built, 69 fewer aircraft than had been originally planned. A total of 13 B-66B aircraft later were modified into EB-66B electronic countermeasures (ECM) aircraft, which played a forward role in the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, and were stationed at RAF Chelveston with the 42nd Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, who performed the conversion during the early 1960s. They would rotate out of an alert pad in [France] during the time that the 42nd had them. These aircraft, along with the RB-66Cs that the 42nd received, would subsequently see combat service during the Vietnam War. Unlike the US Navy's A-3 Skywarrior, which performed bombing missions in the theatre, the Destroyer was never once used to perform bombing missions in Vietnam. The RB-66C was a specialized electronic reconnaissance and electronic countermeasures (ECM) aircraft; according to Gunston and Gilchrist, it was the first aircraft designed from the onset for electronic intelligence (ELINT) missions.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 164. It was operated by an expanded crew of seven, which included the additional electronics warfare specialists. A total of 36 of these aircraft were constructed; the additional crew members were housed in the space that was used to accommodate the camera/bomb bay of other variants, these aircraft were outfitted with distinctive wingtip pods that accommodated various receiver antennas, which were also present upon a belly-mounted blister. Several RB-66Cs were operated in the vicinity of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis, they would also be deployed over Vietnam. During 1966, these planes were re-designated as EB-66C. Unarmed EB-66B, EB-66C and EB-66E aircraft flew numerous missions during the Vietnam War. They helped gather electronic intelligence about North Vietnamese defenses, and provided protection for bombing missions of the Republic F-105 Thunderchiefs by jamming North Vietnamese radar systems. Early on, B-66s flew oval \\"racetrack\\" patterns over North Vietnam, but after one B-66 was shot down by a MiG, the vulnerable flights were ordered to fly just outside North Vietnamese air space. On 10 March 1964, a 19th TRS RB-66C flying on a photo-reconnaissance mission from the Toul-Rosi√®res Air Base in France, was shot down over East Germany by a Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 after it had crossed over the border due to a compass malfunction. The crew ejected from the aircraft and, following a brief period of detention, were repatriated to the United States. The final Douglas B-66 variant was the WB-66D weather reconnaissance aircraft; 36 were built. By 1975, the last EB-66C/E aircraft had been withdrawn from USAF service. Most aircraft were scrapped in place, others were temporarily stored while awaiting eventual scrapping.

Northrop X-21 Douglas EB-66E Destroyer in flight. Aircraft of the 355th Tactical Fighter Wing, 41st or 42nd TEWS based at Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base over Southeast Asia on 30 March 1970. The Northrop X-21 was a modified WB-66D with an experimental wing, designed to conduct laminar flow control studies. Laminar-flow control was thought to potentially reduce drag by as much as 25%. Control would be by removal of a small amount of the boundary- layer air by suction through porous materials, multiple narrow surface slots, or small perforations. Northrop began flight research in April 1963 at Edwards Air Force Base, but with all of the problems encountered, and money going into the war, the X-21 would be the last experiment involving this concept.\\"B-66 Information.\\" B66.info, Retrieved: 5 August 2010.

The North American A-5 Vigilante was an American carrier-based supersonic bomber designed and built by North American Aviation for the United States Navy. It set several world records, including long-distance speed and altitude records. Prior to 1962 unification of Navy and Air Force designations, it was designated the A3J Vigilante.Wagner 1982, p. 361. The aircraft briefly replaced the Douglas A-3 Skywarrior as the Navy's primary nuclear-strike aircraft, but its RA-5C tactical strike reconnaissance variant saw extensive service during the Vietnam War. Design and development In 1953, North American Aviation began a private study for a carrier-based, long-range, all-weather strike bomber, capable of delivering nuclear weapons at supersonic speeds.Dean 2001, p. 23. This proposal, the North American General Purpose Attack Weapon (NAGPAW) concept, was accepted by the United States Navy, with some revisions, in 1955.Siuru 1981, p. 15. A contract was awarded on 29 August 1956. Its first flight occurred two years later on 31 August 1958 in Columbus, Ohio.Siuru 1981, p. 16. At the time of its introduction, the Vigilante was one of the largest and by far the most complex aircraft to operate from a Navy aircraft carrier. It had a high-mounted swept wing with a boundary-layer control system (blown flaps) to improve low-speed lift. It had no ailerons; roll control was provided by spoilers in conjunction with differential deflection of the all- moving tail surfaces. The use of aluminum-lithium alloy for wing skins and titanium for critical structures was also unusual. The A-5 had two widely spaced General Electric J79 turbojet engines, fed by inlets with variable intake ramps, and a single large all-moving vertical stabilizer. Preliminary design studies had employed twin vertical fin/rudders. The wings, vertical stabilizer and the nose radome folded for carrier stowage. The Vigilante had a crew of two seated in tandem, a pilot and a bombardier-navigator (BN) (reconnaissance/attack navigator (RAN) on later reconnaissance versions) seated on North American HS-1A ejection seats.Aerofax Minigraph 9: North American Rockwell A3J/A-5 Vigilante; Michael Grove and Jay Miller; Aerofax, Inc., Arlington, TX; c1989; p.41 Designated by the US Navy as a \\"heavy\\", the A-5 was surprisingly agile; without the drag of bombs or missiles, even escorting fighters found that the clean airframe and powerful engines made the Vigilante very fast at high and low altitudes. However, its high approach speed and high angle of attack contributed to a high workload during carrier landings.Ellis 2008, p. 64. The Vigilante had advanced and complex electronics when it first entered service. It had one of the first \\"fly-by-wire\\" systems on an operational aircraft (with mechanical/hydraulic backup) and a computerized AN/ASB-12 nav/attack system incorporating a head-up display (\\"Pilot's Projected Display Indicator\\" (PPDI), one of the first), multi-mode radar, radar-equipped inertial navigation system (REINS, based on technologies developed for North American's Navaho missile), closed-circuit television camera under the nose, and an early digital computer known as \\"Versatile Digital Analyzer\\" (VERDAN) to run it all. The A3J \\"stores train\\" within the bomb bay Given its original design as a carrier-based, supersonic, nuclear heavy attack aircraft, the Vigilante's main armament was carried in an unusual \\"linear bomb bay\\" between the engines in the rear fuselage, which allowed the bomb to be dropped at supersonic speeds. The single nuclear weapon, commonly the Mk 28 bomb, was attached to two disposable fuel tanks in the cylindrical bay in an assembly known as the \\"stores train\\". A set of extendable fins was attached to the aft end of the most rearward fuel tank. These fuel tanks were to be emptied during the flight to the target and then jettisoned with the bomb by an explosive drogue gun. The stores train was propelled rearward at about per second (30 knots) relative to the aircraft. It then followed a ballistic path.Thomason 2009, p. 112. In practice, the system was not reliable and no live weapons were ever carried in the linear bomb bay. In the RA-5C configuration, the bay was used solely for fuel. On three occasions, the shock of the catapult launch caused the fuel cans to eject onto the deck; this resulted in one aircraft loss.Goebel, Greg. airvectors.net, 5 April 2007. Retrieved: 2 March 2008. An RA-5C Vigilante The Vigilante originally had two wing pylons, intended primarily for drop tanks. The second Vigilante variant, the A3J-2 (A-5B), incorporated internal tanks for an additional 460 gallons of fuel (which added a pronounced dorsal \\"hump\\") along with two additional wing hardpoints, for a total of four. In practice the hardpoints were rarely used. Other improvements included blown flaps on the leading edge of the wing and stronger landing gear. The reconnaissance version of the Vigilante, the RA-5C, had slightly greater wing area and added a long canoe-shaped fairing under the fuselage for a multi-sensor reconnaissance pack. This added an APD-7 side- looking airborne radar (SLAR), AAS-21 infrared line scanner, and camera packs, as well as improved electronic countermeasures. An AN/ALQ-61 electronic intelligence system could also be carried. The RA-5C retained the AN/ASB-12 bombing system, and could, in theory, carry weapons, although it never did in service. Later-build RA-5Cs had more powerful J79-10 engines with afterburning thrust of 17,900 lbf (80 kN). The reconnaissance Vigilante weighed almost five tons more than the strike version with almost the same thrust and an only modestly enlarged wing. These changes reduced its acceleration and climb rate, though it remained fast in level flight. The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) considered acquiring the RA-5C as its main bomber, to replace the English Electric Canberra. The McDonnell F-4C/RF-4C, Dassault Mirage IVA, and BAC TSR-2 were also considered. However, the General Dynamics F-111C, a variant of the TFX (F-111) tailored for the needs of the RAAF, was instead accepted. Operational history A3J-1s (A-5A post 1962) of VAH-7 on USS Enterprise in 1962. Designated A3J-1, the Vigilante first entered service with Heavy Attack Squadron Three (VAH-3) in June 1961 at Naval Air Station Sanford, Florida, replacing the Douglas A-3 Skywarrior in the heavy attack, e.g., \\"strategic nuclear strike\\" role.Goodspeed 2000, p. 51. All variants of the Vigilante were built at North American Aviation's facility at Port Columbus Airport in Columbus, Ohio, alongside the North American T-2 Buckeye, T-39 Sabreliner and OV-10 Bronco. Under the Tri-Services Designation plan implemented under Robert McNamara in September 1962, the Vigilante was redesignated A-5, with the initial A3J-1 becoming A-5A and the updated A3J-2 becoming A-5B. The subsequent reconnaissance version, originally A3J-3P, became the RA-5C. The Vigilante's early service proved troublesome, with many teething problems for its advanced systems. Although these systems were highly sophisticated, the technology was in its infancy and its reliability was poor.Aerofax Minigraph 9: North American Rockwell A3J/A-5 Vigilante; Michael Grove and Jay Miller; Aerofax, Inc., Arlington, Texas; c1989; pp. 6-10 Although most of these reliability issues were eventually worked out as maintenance personnel gained greater experience with supporting these systems, the aircraft tended to remain a maintenance-intensive platform throughout its career. The A-5's service coincided with a major policy shift in the U.S. Navy's strategic role, which switched to emphasize submarine-launched ballistic missiles rather than manned bombers. As a result, in 1963, procurement of the A-5 was ended and the type was converted to the fast reconnaissance role. The first RA-5Cs were delivered to VAH-3, the A-5A and A-5B Replacement Air Group (RAG)/Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS), subsequently redesignated as Reconnaissance Attack Squadron Three (RVAH-3), at Naval Air Station Sanford, Florida in July 1963. As they transitioned from the attack version to the reconnaissance version, all Vigilante squadrons were subsequently redesignated from VAH to RVAH. Under Commander, Reconnaissance Attack Wing One (COMRECONATKWING ONE), a total of 10 RA-5C squadrons were ultimately established. RVAH-3 continued to be responsible for the stateside-based RA-5C training mission of flight crews, maintenance and support personnel, while RVAH-1, RVAH-5, RVAH-6, RVAH-7, RVAH-9, RVAH-11, RVAH-12, RVAH-13 and RVAH-14 routinely deployed aboard , , , , , , , , and eventually the s to the Atlantic, Mediterranean and Western Pacific. An RVAH-12 RA-5C beginning its reconnaissance run over Vietnam, 1967. Eight of ten squadrons of RA-5C Vigilantes also saw extensive service in the Vietnam War starting in August 1964, carrying out hazardous medium-level post- strike reconnaissance missions. Although it proved fast and agile, 18 RA-5Cs were lost in combat: 14 to anti-aircraft fire, 3 to surface-to-air missiles, and 1 to a MiG-21 during Operation Linebacker II. Nine more RA-5Cs were lost in operational accidents while serving with Task Force 77. Due, in part, to these combat losses, 36 additional RA-5C aircraft were built from 1968 to 1970 as attrition replacements.Ellis 2008, p. 63. In 1968, Congress closed the aircraft's original operating base of Naval Air Station Sanford, Florida and transferred the parent wing, Reconnaissance Attack Wing One, all subordinate squadrons and all aircraft and personnel to Turner AFB, a Strategic Air Command (SAC) Boeing B-52 Stratofortress and Boeing KC-135 base in Albany, Georgia. The tenant SAC bomb wing was then inactivated and control of Turner AFB was transferred from the Air Force to the Navy with the installation renamed Naval Air Station Albany. In 1974, after barely six years of service as a naval air station, Congress opted to close Naval Air Station Albany as part of a post-Vietnam force reduction, transferring all RA-5C units and personnel to Naval Air Station Key West, Florida. Despite the Vigilante's useful service, it was expensive and complex to operate and occupied significant amounts of precious flight deck and hangar deck space aboard both conventional and nuclear-powered aircraft carriers at a time when carrier air wings, with the introduction of the F-14 Tomcat and S-3 Viking, were averaging 90 aircraft, many of which were larger than their predecessors. With the end of the Vietnam War, disestablishment of RVAH squadrons began in 1974, with the last Vigilante squadron, RVAH-7, completing its final deployment to the Western Pacific aboard USS Ranger in late 1979. The final flight by an RA-5C took place on 20 November 1979 when a Vigilante departed Naval Air Station Key West, Florida. Reconnaissance Attack Wing One was subsequently disestablished at Naval Air Station Key West in January 1980.

This aircraft is now on permanent display at Naval Support Activity Mid-South (formerly Naval Air Station Memphis), Tennessee. Military Aircraft Storage and Disposition Center, Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona in November 1978. The Vigilante did not end the career of the A-3 Skywarrior, which would carry on as photo reconnaissance aircraft, electronic warfare platforms, aerial refueling tankers, and executive transport aircraft designated as RA-3A/B, EA-3A/B, ERA-3B, EKA-3B KA-3B, and VA-3B, into the early 1990s. Fighters replaced the RA-5C in the carrier-based reconnaissance role. The RF-8G version of the Vought F-8 Crusader, modified with internal cameras, had already been serving in two light photographic squadrons (VFP-62 and VFP-63) since the early 1960s, operating from older aircraft carriers unable to support the Vigilante. The Marine Corps' sole photographic squadron (VMFP-3) would also deploy aboard aircraft carriers during this period with RF-4B Phantom II aircraft. These squadrons superseded the Vigilante's role by providing detachments from the primary squadron to carrier air wings throughout the late 1970s and early-to-mid-1980s, until the transfer of the recon mission to the Navy's fighter squadron (VF) community operating the F-14 Tomcat. Select models of the F-14 Tomcat would eventually carry the multi- sensor Tactical Airborne Reconnaissance Pod System (TARPS) and the Digital Tactical Air Reconnaissance Pod (D-TARPS). Up to present day, the weight of carrier-based fighters such as the F-14 Tomcat and Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet have evolved into the same class as the Vigilante. Records On 13 December 1960, Navy Commander Leroy Heath (Pilot) and Lieutenant Larry Monroe (Bombardier/Navigator) established a world altitude record of in an A3J Vigilante carrying a 1,000 kilogram payload, beating the previous record by over . This new record held for more than 13 years.Siuru, 1981, p. 16 The attempt was accomplished by reaching a speed of Mach 2.1, then pulling up to create a ballistic trajectory beyond the altitude at which its wings could continue to function. The engines flamed out in the thin atmosphere, and the aircraft rolled onto its back. This had already been experienced in previous flights, and so the pilot simply released the controls and the aircraft regained control naturally as it descended back into the thicker air of the lower atmosphere.\\"North American Rockwell A3J (A-5) Vigilante\\" by M.

The aircraft was designed shortly after World War II to carry atomic bombs and this meant that the bomber was the heaviest aircraft thus far designed to operate from an aircraft carrier. It was powered by two piston engines and a turbojet buried in the rear fuselage. The AJ-1 first became operational in 1950 and several were based in South Korea during 1953 as a deterrent against the Communists. Of the 140 built, plus three prototypes, 30 were reconnaissance aircraft. Inflight-refueling equipment was deployed on the Savage in the mid-1950s. The bomber was replaced by the Douglas A3D Skywarrior beginning in 1957. Design and development At the end of World War II, the U.S. Navy began a design competition on 13 August 1945 for a carrier-based bomber which could carry a bomb that was won by North American Aviation. Later that year, the Navy decided that it needed to be able to deliver atomic bombs and that the AJ Savage design would be adapted to accommodate the latest Mark 4 nuclear bomb, the next step in development from the more sophisticated imploding plutonium sphere design Fat Man Mk3 used on Nagasaki. A contract for three XAJ-1 prototypes and a static test airframe was awarded on 24 June 1946. The first prototype made its maiden flight two years later on 3 July 1948.Ginter 1992, pp. 3, 5. That same year the US Navy began an interim capability program employing the Lockheed P-2 Neptune carrying a crash program reproduction of the smaller simpler all uranium 'gun' design Little Boy nuclear bomb as its first carrier launched nuclear bomber aircraft until the Savage was in service. The Neptune launched using JATO assist but could not land on existing carriers; if launched they had to either ditch at sea after its mission or land at a friendly airbase.Swanborough and Bowers 1976, p. 458 The AJ-1 was a three-seat, high-wing monoplane with tricycle landing gear. To facilitate carrier operations, the outer wing panels and the tailfin could be manually folded.Ginter 1992, pp. 5, 7, 38. It was fitted with two Pratt & Whitney R-2800-44W Double Wasp piston engines, mounted in nacelles under each wing with a large turbocharger fitted inside each engine nacelle, and a Allison J33-A-10 turbojet was fitted in the rear fuselage. The jet engine was only intended for takeoff and maximum speed near the target,Johnson 2000, p. 343. and was fed by an air inlet on top of the fuselage that was normally kept closed to reduce drag.Ginter 1992, p. 30. To simplify the fuel system, the jet engine used piston engine avgas rather than jet fuel. One self-sealing fuel tank was housed in the fuselage, and another tank was located in each wing. The aircraft usually carried tip tanks and it could house three fuel tanks in the bomb bay with a total capacity of . Other than its bombload, the bomber was unarmed. AJ-2 Savage of VC-7 from NAS Port Lyautey, Morocco, at Blackbushe Airport, in September 1955 Two of the three prototypes crashed during testing, but their loss did not materially affect the development of the aircraft as the first batch of Savages had been ordered on 6 October 1947. The most significant difference between the XAJ-1 and the production aircraft was the revision of the cockpit to accommodate a third crewman in a separate compartment. The first flight by a production aircraft occurred in May 1949 and Fleet Composite Squadron 5 (VC-5) became the first squadron to receive a Savage in September.Ginter 1992, pp. 5, 7, 25, 75. The squadron participated in testing and evaluating the aircraft together with the Naval Air Test Center (NATC) in order to expedite the Savage's introduction into the fleet.Miller 2001, p. 94 The first carrier takeoff and landing made by the bomber took place from the on 21 April and 31 August 1950, respectively. Many, if not most, surviving AJ-1s had their tails upgraded to the improved AJ-2 configuration.Ginter 1992, pp. 7, 11‚Äì12. A photo-reconnaissance version of the Savage, initially known as the AJ-1P, but later designated as the AJ-2P, was ordered on 18 August 1950. It had improved R-2800-48 piston engines and the tail was redesigned to add of height to the tailfin. The 12¬∞ dihedral of the tail stabilizers was eliminated and the rudder enlarged which slightly lengthened the aircraft. Early AJ-2Ps retained the three-man crew, but late- model aircraft added a fourth aft-facing crewman to the upper cockpit. The Savage's internal fuel capacity was also increased. The nose of the aircraft was remodeled with a prominent \\"chin\\" to accommodate a forward-looking oblique camera and a variety of oblique and vertical cameras could be fitted in the bomb bay. Photoflash bombs could be carried for night photography missions.Ginter 1992, pp. 11, 43, 46, 48‚Äì53. The AJ-2 incorporated all of the changes made to the late model AJ-2P and 55 aircraft were ordered on 14 February 1951. The AJ-2 deleted the separate compartment for the third crewman, but retained the third seat in the cockpit from the AJ-2P.Ginter 1992, p. 12. Around 1954, NATC modified the sole surviving XAJ-1 to conduct inflight refueling tests using the probe and drogue configuration. The turbojet engine was removed and the fuel hose and its drogue extended out from the jet's former exhaust opening. Aircraft in service retained the turbojet and had their bomb bay doors modified to accommodate the hose and drogue. They were refueling aircraft during late 1954.Ginter 1992, p. 59, 75, 85. Operational history An AJ-1 aboard the modernized Essex-class carrier on 29 August 1952 When first deployed, the AJ-1 was too large and heavy to be used by any American aircraft carrier except for the . The modernized carriers with reinforced decks and the very large could also handle the Savage. The aircraft was not popular aboard ship as \\"it was so big and cumbersome that it complicated any other flight operations the ship was required to conduct.\\" One problem was that the wings had to be folded one at a time by a crewman on top of the fuselage with a portable hydraulic pump, a time-consuming process, so that the bomber could be moved out of the way to allow other aircraft to land or take off. One pilot reported that the AJ-1 was \\"a dream to fly and handled like a fighter\\",quoted in Miller 2001, p. 96 when everything was working properly. The aircraft, however, was not very reliable, possibly because it was rushed into production before all the problems could be ironed out.Miller 2001, pp. 95, 97‚Äì98. Early in the Savage's career, squadrons would typically deploy a detachment to Naval Air Station Port Lyautey, Morocco, for service with the Sixth Fleet and fly the bombers aboard aircraft carriers that were already deployed to the Mediterranean as needed.Ginter 1992, pp. 60, 71, 75. The plan was that the Savages would then be loaded with atomic bombs already aboard the carriers and launched once the carriers were in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. The tactic to deliver the bombs was to fly at low level through Bulgaria and Romania before climbing at maximum power to the proper altitude to release the bomb. The aircraft would then perform a wingover maneuver and dive to low altitude, keeping the tail of the aircraft aimed at the target to avoid serious damage from the shock wave of the explosion.Miller 2001, pp. 95, 98 VC-5 made the first of its three deployments to Port Lyautey in February 1951. Fleet Composite Squadron 6 (VC-6) received its first Savages in late 1950 and deployed to Port Lyautey in October 1951 before transferring to the Pacific Fleet in October 1952. In July 1953 it deployed a detachment of two aircraft to K-3 Air Base in Korea to act as a nuclear deterrent.Ginter 1992, p. 77 VC-7, VC-8, and VC-9 received their AJ-1s beginning in June 1951 and all remained on the East Coast of the United States.Ginter 1992, pp. 71, 75, 88, 91, 93 The Navy redesignated all of its Savage-equipped composite squadrons as heavy attack squadrons (VAH) on 1 November 1955.Grossnick 1995, p. 547,Appendix 6. The squadrons retained their existing numbers except for VC-8 which became VAH-11 as all East Coast squadrons were odd-numbered.Ginter 1992, p. 91. AJ tankers were used to refuel John Glenn's Vought F8U-1P Crusader during the Project Bullet transcontinental speed record flight in July 1957; AJ-2s from VAH-6 on the West Coast and AJ-1s from VAH-11 on the East Coast. Beginning in 1957 the Douglas A3D Skywarrior began to replace the Savages in the VAH Squadrons.Ginter 1992, p. 93, 95, 98, 105‚Äì06. Their refueling role was continued by the formation in January 1958 of VAH-15 on East Coast and VAH-16 on the West Coast. Both squadrons were equipped with AJ-2s,Ginter 1992, pp. 110‚Äì111. but both were short-lived and disbanded early the following year.Grossnick 1995, Chapter 3, pp. 298‚Äì99 Two AJ-2Ps of VAP-61 in 1953 The AJ-2P was flown by Photographic Squadron 61 (VJ-61) and Photographic Squadron 62 (VJ-62), both of which were redesignated as Heavy Photographic Squadrons, VAP-61 and VAP-62, respectively, on 2 July 1956. VJ-61 was assigned to the Pacific Fleet and VJ-62 to the Atlantic Fleet. The squadrons never deployed as complete units, but rather deployed as one to three aircraft detachments. Detachment Queen was formed by VJ-61 during the Korean War at Naval Station Sangley Point, in the Philippines, to fly reconnaissance missions over the People's Republic of China and North Korea. The detachment continued its missions after the war until at least June 1954. Both squadrons frequently provided photographic mapping for agencies outside the Navy like the Army Map Service, Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, and U.S. Departments of the Interior and Agriculture. The AJ-2s in these squadrons were replaced by Douglas A3D-2P Skywarriors beginning in 1959,Ginter 1992, pp. 63, 65‚Äì67, 70. although the last month that they were reported in squadron service was January 1960.Grossnick 1995, p. 458, Appendix 1-1. Surviving AJ-1 and AJ-2 aircraft became A-2As and A-2Bs, respectively, when the Department of Defense redesignated all U.S. military aircraft in a common series in 1962.Swanborough and Bowers 1990, p. 517. Three AJ-2s were loaned to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration as weightlessness simulators from January 1960 to September 1964. They were eventually destroyed during firefighting training. Three AJ-1s were purchased by AJ Air Tankers, Inc. in early 1960 for use as water bombers. Their turbojets were removed before the delivery flight to California, during which one aircraft crashed. The two surviving aircraft were fully modified for the role after delivery and could carry of fire retardant. They first flew missions during the 1961 fire season. Another aircraft crashed on takeoff in September 1967 when an engine failed and the sole survivor only made a few more flights before it was scrapped in 1968‚Äì69.Ginter 1992, pp. 113, 124. The Avco Lycoming Savage with the YF102 extended At least one other AJ-2 was purchased and used as a water bomber before it was purchased in 1970 by Avco Lycoming for use as an engine testbed for the YF102 turbofan. The J33 turbojet had to be reinstalled and the aircraft required almost a year of maintenance before it could be flown to Avco Lycoming's home airfield at Stratford, Connecticut. The YF102, too fat to fully fit in the bomb bay, was mounted on a retractable mechanism that could be lowered below the aircraft for tests. The testing was conducted from January to July 1972. Another round of testing on the commercial derivative of the F102, the ALF 502, was performed between January 1979 and December 1980. In 1984, routine maintenance discovered several loose rivets on the spar and further examination showed that the skin was starting to separate from the spar.

The A-7 was developed during the early 1960s as replacement for the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk. Its design is derived from the Vought F-8 Crusader; in comparison with the F-8, the A-7 is both smaller and restricted to subsonic speeds, its airframe being simpler and cheaper to produce. Following a competitive bid by Vought in response to the United States Navy's (USN) VAL (Heavier-than-air, Attack, Light) requirement, an initial contract for the type was issued on 8 February 1964. Development was rapid, first flying on 26 September 1965 and entering squadron service with the USN on 1 February 1967; by the end of that year, A-7s were being deployed overseas for the Vietnam War. Initially adopted by USN, the A-7 proved attractive to other services, soon being adopted by the United States Air Force (USAF) and the Air National Guard (ANG) to replace their aging Douglas A-1 Skyraider and North American F-100 Super Sabre fleets. Improved models of the A-7 would be developed, typically adopting more powerful engines and increasingly capable avionics. American A-7s would be used in various major conflicts, including the Invasion of Grenada, Operation El Dorado Canyon, and the Gulf War. The type was also used to support the development of the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk. The A-7 was also exported to Greece in the 1970s and to Portugal in the late 1980s. The USAF and USN opted to retire their remaining examples of the type in 1991, followed by the ANG in 1993 and the Portuguese Air Force in 1999. The A-7 was largely replaced by newer generation fighters such as the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet. The final operator, the Hellenic Air Force, withdrew the last A-7s during 2014. Development=Origins In 1960, officials within the United States Navy (USN) began to consider the need to replace its existing fleet of Douglas A-4 Skyhawk, a light attack aircraft. At that time, it was not clear that the A-4 would eventually remain in production until 1979; furthermore, according to aviation authors Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist, some figures believed there to be an unmet requirement for a more capable attack platform that could routinely attain supersonic speeds, carry heavier payloads, and fly further than its predecessors. Proponents of a new attack aircraft included Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, who urged the Navy's consideration on the matter. In December 1962, the Sea-Based Air Strike Forces (SBASF) study group started examining detailed performance and cost evaluations on the topic. The group analysed a total of 144 hypothetical aircraft to support their findings. According to Gunston and Gilchrist, a major finding from these studies was that a subsonic aircraft would achieve superior performance to a supersonic one. By foregoing a supersonic capability, the airframe could be smaller, cheaper, and easier to manufacture; considerably larger quantities of such an attack platform could be procured over a supersonic counterpart. Development speed was also increased by sticking to subsonic speeds, which was a further advantage. A particular emphasis was placed on the accurate delivery of weapons, which would reduce the munitions costs per target. On 17 May 1963, these criteria were formulated into a draft requirement, known as VAL (Heavier-than-air, Attack, Light). On 29 May 1963, the request for proposals (RFP) associated with the requirement was issued. To minimize costs, all proposals had to be based on existing designs. Accordingly, Vought, Douglas Aircraft, Grumman and North American Aviation chose to respond. The Vought proposal was based on their successful F-8 Crusader fighter and sharing a similar configuration; however, it had a shorter airframe with a rounded nose, giving the aircraft a \\"stubbier\\" appearance. All bids were received by September 1963 and the evaluation process was completed in early November of that year. On 8 February 1964, funding for VAL was approved by Congress, enabling the programme to proceed; three days later, Vought's submission was selected as the winner. On 19 March 1964, Vought received a contract from the Navy for the manufacture of the initial batch of aircraft, designated A-7. On 22 June 1964, the mock-up review took place. In 1965, the A-7 received the name Corsair II; Vought had previously produced two aircraft known as \\"Corsair\\". During the 1920s, they had produced the O2U Corsair biplane scout and observation aircraft; during World War II, the firm made the successful F4U Corsair. The name Corsair II reflects the well-known F4U Corsair, which famously served as a capable fighter bomber in World War II and the Korean War. It was supposed to establish a lineage between the aircraft from the same manufacturer and intended for the same ground attack role; the obscure O2U was not considered, which is why the name \\"Corsair III\\" was not adopted. Into production The first A-7 mock-up in 1964 On 27 September 1965, the first A-7A performed the type's maiden flight. On 2 November 1965, Vought publicly demonstrated the first pair of A-7As to 1,000 guests; test pilot John Conrad demonstrated the aircraft's ability to perform rapid rolls even while laden with a payload of six 250 lb and twelve 500 lb bombs. A Navy spokesperson acknowledged the A-7's ability to carry double the bombload of an A-4E, or the same payload over twice its maximum distance. The flight test programme proceeded at a relatively rapid pace, during which no major setbacks were uncovered or meaningful delays were incurred. According to Gunston and Gilchrist, there were some naval officials that sought to slow the programme down so that the A-7's avionics systems could be revised for greater capabilities, but this preference had been overridden by a perceived urgency to getting the type into service. On 14 October 1966, enough aircraft had been delivered to the Navy that the first squadron could be formed. The first A-7 squadrons attained operational status on 1 February 1967; these were able to commence overseas combat operations in the escalating Vietnam War during December of that year.Swanborough and Bowers 1976, p. 293. The June 1964 contract had ordered the completion of seven development aircraft and 35 production-standard fighter bombers. A follow-up contract, placed during September 1965, ordered 140 more aircraft. A third contract for 17 aircraft led to a total of 199 A-7A aircraft being manufactured. As the original version was found to be underpowered, a large order for 196 aircraft of the improved A-7B variant, equipped with the more powerful Pratt & Whitney TF30-8 engine, was placed. Further variants of the type would be ordered, including the A-7D for the United States Air Force (USAF), during 1966. Partially due to a shortage of engines, the Allison TF41-A-2, a licensed derivative of the Rolls-Royce Spey engine, powered the A-7D. The adoption of a British engine caused some political controversy on both sides of the Atlantic. During 1967, the Navy decided to cancel its order for the A-7B, resulting in 257 aircraft less of this variant being constructed. Taking its place, the A-7E, the definitive model of the aircraft, was specified and placed into production. This variant integrated several of the improvements of the USAF's A-7D, including the TF41 engine and much of its avionics, however the engine was revised for slightly more thrust and the communications modified for compatibility with naval systems. On 25 November 1968, the first A-7E conducted its first flight; a total of 535 aircraft of this variant would be manufactured. During the 1970s and 1980s, several specialised models, such as the TA-7C for training and EA-7L for electronic warfare, were developed as well. During 1983, the final delivery of a new-build A-7 took place. Design The LTV A-7 Corsair II was a carrier-capable subsonic attack fighter. It was a derivative of the Vought F-8 Crusader, an earlier fighter; compared to the Crusader, it had a shorter, broader fuselage, and a longer- span wing but without the Crusader's variable-incidence feature. The A-7's wing was not only larger but had reduced sweepback, as well as six pylons with the carriage of up to 15,000 lb (6,800 kg) of bombs or other equipment. According to Gunston and Gilchirst, there were no common structural features shared between the two aircraft despite their visual similarity and shared heritage. The A-7 had fully powered flight controls, as did the F-8. However, conventional outboard ailerons were used (instead of the drooping ailerons mounted inboard of the wing-fold of the F-8 and doubling as flaps when flaps were deployed), along with large slotted flaps on the wing's inboard area; the wing fold was between the flaps and ailerons. The wing leading edge was fixed and had a dog-tooth discontinuity. A large air brake was fitted on the underside of the aircraft. The three-unit landing gear retracted into the fuselage; the twin-wheel nose gear was steerable and stressed for catapult- assisted take-offs. VA-147 was the first operational USN A-7 squadron, in 1967. To achieve the required range, initial versions of the A-7 were powered by a single Pratt & Whitney TF30-P-6 turbofan engine, which produced 11,345 lbf (50.5 kN) of thrust. It had replaced the afterburner-equipped Pratt & Whitney J57-P-20A turbojet engine of the F-8. The same engine had also powered several other combat aircraft of the era, including the General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark and early Grumman F-14 Tomcats. The TF30-P-6 did not require an afterburner for its subsonic role. Later versions of the A-7 used different engines; according to Gunston and Gilchrist, this was largely due to production difficulties in keeping up with numerous military and civil demands. These new powerplants included the more powerful Pratt & Whitney TF30-8 and the Allison TF41-A-2 engines, a licensed model of the Rolls-Royce Spey engine. The TF41 corrected issues that had troubled initial A-7 operations, such as severe compressor stalls and low thrust. The Air Force A-7D had self-contained starting using internal batteries and a gas turbine starter. The Navy A-7E used an air turbine starter driven by an external air supply. Air was fed to the engine through ducting from a simple nose inlet, similar to that on the F-8, despite the potential hazard it posed to flight deck personnel. An aerial refueling probe was mounted on the righthand side of the nose. Two cannon were installed on the underside of the nose. For self- defense against aerial threats, the A-7, in addition to the cannon, had a mounting for AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles on either side of the fuselage. Later variants had the two cannon replaced with a single M61A1 Vulcan rotary cannon, along with other improvements. To reduce vulnerability to ground fire the flying control hydraulic systems were triplicated, other systems duplicated and much of the fuselage had armor protection. The A-7 was fitted with an AN/APQ-116 radar, later followed by the AN/APQ-126, which was integrated into the ILAAS digital navigation system. The radar also fed an IBM navigation and weapons delivery computer which made possible accurate delivery of bombs from a greater stand-off distance, greatly improving survivability compared with faster aircraft such as the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II. It was the first U.S. aircraft to have a modern head-up display, (made by Marconi-Elliott),\\"Avionics: HUDAVAC.\\" flightglobal.com. Retrieved: 13 October 2010. now a standard instrument, which displayed information such as dive angle, airspeed, altitude, drift and aiming reticule. The integrated navigation system also had another innovation ‚Äì the projected map display system (PMDS) which accurately showed aircraft position on two different map scales. The A-7 had more modern avionics and systems than contemporary aircraft. This included data link capabilities that, among others, provided \\"hands-off\\" carrier landing capability when used with its approach power compensator (APC) or auto throttle. Other notable and advanced equipment was a projected map display located just below the radar scope. The map display was slaved to the inertial navigation system and provided a high-resolution map image of the aircraft's position superimposed over TPC/JNC charts. Moreover, when slaved to the all-axis auto pilot, the inertial navigation system could fly the aircraft \\"hands off\\" to up to nine individual waypoints. Typical inertial drift was minimal for newly manufactured models and the inertial measurement system accepted fly over, radar, and TACAN updates. Operational history=Introduction and early operations Initial operational basing/homeporting for USN A-7 squadrons was at NAS Cecil Field, Florida for Atlantic Fleet units and NAS Lemoore, California for Pacific Fleet units. This was in keeping with the role of these bases in already hosting the A-4 Skyhawk attack squadrons that would eventually transition to the A-7. Lynn Garrison in a Chance Vought F4U-7 Corsair leads A-7 Corsair IIs of VA-147, over NAS Lemoore, California on 7 July 1967 prior to the A-7's first deployment to Vietnam on USS Ranger. The A-7A \\"NE-300\\" is the aircraft of the Air Group Commander (CAG) of Attack Carrier Air Wing 2 (CVW-2). From 1967 to 1971, a total of 27 US Navy squadrons took delivery of four different A-7A/B/C/E models. The Vought plant in Dallas, Texas, employed up to 35,000 workers who turned out one aircraft a day for several years to support the navy's carrier- based needs for Vietnam and SE Asia and commitments to NATO in Europe. In 1974, when became the first Forward Deployed Naval Force (FDNF) aircraft carrier to be homeported in Yokosuka, Japan, two A-7A squadrons assigned to Carrier Air Wing Five (CVW-5) were concurrently homeported at NAF Atsugi, Japan. In 1976, these squadrons (VA-93 and VA-56) finally transitioned to the much more advanced A-7E model. Six Naval Reserve attack squadrons would also eventually transition to the A-7, operating from NAS Cecil Field, Florida; NAS Atlanta/Dobbins ARB, Georgia; NAS New Orleans, Louisiana; NAS Alameda, California and NAS Point Mugu, California. An additional active duty squadron stood up in the 1980s, Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 34 (VAQ-34) at NAS Point Mugu, operating twin-seat TA-7C and EA-7L aircraft with both a pilot and a naval flight officer in an adversary electronic warfare role.\\"Establishment Ceremony: 0900 March 01 1983.\\" VAG 34. Retrieved: 2 October 2012. Pilots of the early A-7s lauded the aircraft for general ease of flying (with the exceptions of poor stability on crosswind landings and miserable stopping performance on wet runways with an inoperative anti-skid braking system) and excellent forward visibility but noted a lack of engine thrust. This was addressed with A-7B and more thoroughly with A-7D/E. The turbofan engine provided a dramatic increase in fuel efficiency compared with earlier turbojets ‚Äì the A-7D was said to have specific fuel consumption one sixth that of an F-100 Super Sabre at equivalent thrust. An A-7D carrying 12 x bombs at at used only of fuel per hour. Typical fuel consumption at mission retrograde during aircraft carrier recovery was approximately compared to over for the Phantom F-4J/N series. The A-7 Corsair II was tagged with the nickname \\"SLUF\\" (\\"Short Little Ugly Fucker\\") by pilots. Southeast Asia carrier use CVW-16 on USS Ticonderoga in 1968 In Vietnam, the hot, humid air robbed all jet engines of power, and even the upgraded A-7D and A-7E fell short of their required power levels when serving in these conditions. Takeoff rolls were lengthy, and fully armed aircraft struggled to reach 500 mph (800 km/h). For A-7A aircraft, high density altitude and maximum weight runway takeoffs often necessitated a \\"low transition\\", where the aircraft was intentionally held in \\"ground effect\\" a few feet off the runway during gear retraction, and as much as a departure at treetop altitude before reaching a safe flap retraction speed. (A-7A wing flap systems were either fully extended or fully retracted. The A-7A flap handle did not have the microswitch feature of later models that permitted the flaps to be slowly raised by several degrees per tap of the flap handle as airspeed slowly increased during max-weight takeoffs.) Carrier catapult launches at maximum weight under these performance-robbing conditions were not significantly better and were characterized by the aircraft decelerating by as much as immediately after launch. As a result, A-7A units operated their aircraft below the rated maximum takeoff weight for the A-7E. In a sortie against the Thanh H√≥a Bridge on 6 October 1972, four A-7Cs from VA-82 successfully delivered 8,000 lb of high explosives with two aircraft carrying two 2,000 lb (910 kg) Walleyes, while two others also carried 2,000 lbs in Mk 84 GP bombs. In a simultaneous attack, the center piling on the bridge's west side was hit and broke the span in half. After this, the Thanh Hoa bridge was considered permanently destroyed and removed from the target list. A total of 98 USN A-7 Corsairs were lost during the war. United States Air Force A-7D YA-7D-1-CV AF Serial No. 67-14582, the first USAF YA-7D, 2 May 1968. Note the Navy-style refueling probe (retracted beside the cockpit in the standard position, not the air test data probe on the nose cone, which is part of the flight testing equipment) and the modified Navy alt= The United States Army has not been permitted to operate fixed-wing combat aircraft since the establishment of an independent United States Air Force (USAF) in 1947. To meet its need for close air support of its troops in South Vietnam, the Army pressured the Air Force to procure a specialized subsonic close air support fixed-wing aircraft that would suit its needs better than the general-purpose supersonic aircraft that the USAF preferred.Munzenmaier 2009. The Vought A-7 seemed to be a relatively quick and inexpensive way to satisfy this need. However, the USAF was initially reluctant to take on yet another Navy-designed aircraft, but Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara was insistent. On 5 November 1965, Secretary of the Air Force Harold Brown and USAF Chief of Staff General John P. McConnell announced that they had decided to order a version of the Corsair II, designated A-7D, for the Tactical Air Command. The A-7D differed from the Navy's Corsair II in several ways. For one, the USAF insisted on significantly more power for its Corsair II version, and it selected the Allison TF41-A-1 turbofan engine, which was a license-built version of the Rolls-Royce Spey. It offered a thrust of , over greater than that of the TF30 that powered the Navy's Corsair IIs. Other changes included a head up display, a new avionics package, and an M61A1 rotary cannon in place of the two single-barreled 20-mm cannon. Also included was a computerized navigation/weapons delivery system with AN/APQ-126 radar and a head-up display. A-7D-7-CV Corsair IIs 70-0976, 70-0989 and 70-0970 of the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing over the skies of Southeast Asia. '976 and '989 were retired to AMARC in 1992, ' 970 is on permanent display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. Two YA-7D prototypes were completed with TF30-P-6 engines, and the first of these flew on 6 April 1968. The first Spey-powered A-7D (67-14854) flew for the first time on 26 September 1968. The seventeenth production aircraft introduced a provision for boom flight refueling in place of the Navy's retractable starboard-side probe/drogue system, with the boom receptacle being on the top of the fuselage behind the cockpit and offset to port. The A-7D first entered service in 1970 with the 57th Fighter Weapons Wing at Luke AFB Arizona, and the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing at Myrtle Beach AFB, South Carolina was equipped with four squadrons of A-7Ds by 1972; the 355th TFW at Davis-Monthan AFB was equipped with four squadrons in 1972, and in 1973, the 23d TFW at England AFB, Louisiana was fully equipped with A-7Ds. The 354th TFW first deployed two squadrons of A-7Ds to Korat Royal Thai AFB, Thailand in September 1972 as part of Operation Cornet Dancer, The A-7Ds were quickly assigned the \\"Sandy mission\\" of providing air cover for Combat Search and Rescue missions of downed pilots. Taking over from Douglas A-1 Skyraiders (and adopting their call sign of \\"Sandy\\"), the A-7's higher speed was somewhat detrimental for escorting the helicopters but the aircraft's high endurance and durability were an asset and it performed admirably. On 18 November 1972, Major Colin A. Clarke led a successful CSAR mission near Thanh Hoa to rescue a downed Republic F-105 Thunderchief crew. The mission lasted a total of 8.8 hours during which Clarke and his wingman took a number of hits from 0.50 cal (12.7 mm) anti-aircraft fire. For his actions in coordinating the rescue, Clarke was awarded the Air Force Cross, the USAF's second-highest decoration for valor, and his A-7D (AF Serial No. 70-0970) was eventually placed on display on 31 January 1992 at the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.LTV A-7D Corsair II.

With the end of US involvement in South Vietnam, the 354th TFW, deployed at Korat, began flying combat sorties in Cambodia to support the Lon Nol government in support of Khmer National Armed Forces against the Khmer Rouge. Rotational deployments began to Korat from the 355th TFW and 23d TFW, with pilots and support personnel beginning six-months deployment cycles. In March 1973, the 354th transferred a squadron of A-7Ds to the 388th TFW, the host wing at Korat RTAFB at the time, which re-established the 3d Tactical Fighter Squadron and created a permanent USAF A-7D presence in Southeast Asia. A-7Ds from both wings stationed at Korat engaged in combat operations in Cambodia until 15 August 1973 when an A-7D of the deployed 353d TFS/354th TFW carried out the last air support mission. In March 1974, the 354th TFW transferred several more aircraft to the 3d TFS prior to its return to Myrtle Beach AFB. The USAF A-7D flew a total of 12,928 combat sorties during the war with only six losses ‚Äì the lowest of any U.S. fighter in the theater. The aircraft was second only to Boeing B-52 Stratofortress in the amount of ordnance dropped on Hanoi and dropped more bombs per sortie with greater accuracy than any other U.S. attack aircraft. Improved A-7E VA-192 A-7E over Vietnam. This aircraft was lost on 2 November 1972. The Navy was sufficiently impressed with the increased power offered by the A-7D Spey engine used by the Air Force, and decided to use this engine for its own version of the Corsair II. The designation A-7E was assigned, and this version was to succeed the A-7B in production. However, there were delays in the deliveries of the TF41-A-2 engine specified for the A-7E, so the first 67 aircraft of the order were delivered with the TF30-P-8 engine. These aircraft had all of the other improvements planned for the A-7E, including the improved avionics and the M61 rotary cannon, and were re-designated A-7C after delivery. The first Spey-powered A-7E flew for the first time on 9 March 1969. The A-7E differed from the USAF A-7D in retaining the probe-and-drogue midair refueling system of the earlier A-7A/B. It entered service in Southeast Asia in May 1970 with VA-146 and VA-147 deployed aboard . The A-7E participated in numerous close-air support missions over both North and South Vietnam, the A-7E's state-of-the-art bombing and navigation system being particularly reliable and accurate. Most air wings operating A-4 Skyhawks and early A-7s were re-equipped with A-7Es. The A-7E participated in the mining of Haiphong harbor in 1972, and played a vital role in Operations Linebacker I and Linebacker II that led up to the formal end of US involvement in the Vietnam War on 24 January 1973. On 15 May 1975, A-7E aircraft operating from , in conjunction with A-7D aircraft assigned to the 3d TFS at Korat RTAFB, provided air cover in what is considered the last battle of the Vietnam War, the recovery of SS Mayag√ºez after it was hijacked by Khmer Rouge gunboats.

The 3d TFS transitioned from its Corsairs to the F-4E Phantom II and remained at Clark. The A-7Ds were returned to the United States where they were reassigned to several Air National Guard squadrons. With the end of the Vietnam War, the Air Force began to transfer its active duty A-7D aircraft to Air National Guard units beginning in 1974. The Corsairs had been, in a sense, a forced acquisition by the USAF in the late 1960s, and the inter-service rivalry of flying a Navy aircraft had led, beginning about 1970, to the development of its own Close Air Support aircraft. In 1974, selection of the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II was made as the replacement for the A-7D. The first A-10As were received by the 354th TFW in 1977 at Myrtle Beach AFB; the 355th TFW at Davis- Monthan AFB began replacing its A-7Ds in 1978, and the 23d TFW at England AFB in 1979. As the A-10s were received, the A-7Ds were transferred from the USAF to the National Guard Bureau for subsequent re-allocation. By 1981, when the 23d TFW sent its last A-7Ds to Tonopah Test Range Airport, Nevada for clandestine use in the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk development program, fifteen ANG squadrons were equipped with the A-7D Corsair II. However, Congressional decisions added additional funding to the DOD FY 1975 and FY 1976 budgets for the procurement of additional A-7Ds, primarily to keep the LTV production line in Dallas open and the workers employed in the wake of post-Vietnam DOD procurement reductions. As a result of these unplanned acquisitions, the Air Force assigned these new aircraft (all with 1975 tail numbers) to the Arizona Air National Guard 152nd Tactical Fighter Squadron at Tucson, which operated the Air National Guard transition training school for Corsair II pilots. In 1978, a two-seat A-7 trainer was developed by LTV for the Air Force, designated the A-7K. One prototype aircraft was built by modifying an existing A-7D airframe, however production A-7Ks were new builds with 1979 and 1980 tail numbers. The A-7K was a fully combat capable aircraft as well as a dual- control training aircraft. Most of the A-7K trainers went to the transition school at Tucson, with the squadrons' A-7Ds being re-distributed to other ANG squadrons. However all ANG squadrons were assigned an A-7K trainer as well as their complement of A-7Ds. During the post-Vietnam era, the Air National Guard frequently deployed its Corsairs on annual operational exercises. Deployments were made to NATO and USAFE bases in West Germany and Denmark as part of training exercises along with the USAREUR Reforger training exercises. Beginning in 1974, active-duty squadrons from Myrtle Beach, England and Davis- Monthan Air Force Bases began deployments of A-7Ds to Howard AFB, Panama to train with Army and Naval forces defending the Panama Canal. These deployments, named \\"Cornet Cove\\" generally were of ninety (90) days, and were rotated among squadrons of the three wings in the United States. Beginning in 1977, with the phaseout of the A-7D with active-duty units, the Air National Guard began taking over this mission. In December 1989, the South Dakota 175th Tactical Fighter Squadron and Ohio 112th Tactical Fighter Squadron were at Howard AFB on a Coronet Cove deployment when President George H.W. Bush announced Operation Just Cause, the United States Invasion of Panama. The ANG squadrons participated in the invasion, flying 34 combat missions, completing 34 sorties, expended 71.7 flying hours and expended 2,715 rounds of ordnance. In the 1981 Mu√±iz Air National Guard Base attack, on 12 January, 10 A-7Ds of the 198th Tactical Fighter Squadron, Puerto Rico Air National Guard were destroyed or damaged in a terrorist attack by the Boricua Popular Army at Mu√±iz Air National Guard Base in the largest attack ever on an American military station since the Vietnam War.\\"Around the Nation: 8 Military Jets Destroyed At Air Base in Puerto Rico.\\" The New York Times, 12 January 1981. Retrieved: 13 October 2010. This terrorist attack was largely unreported due to the Iran hostage crisis at the time. =Grenada and Lebanon= A-7Es on in 1983 A-7E of VA-72 on off Libya in April 1986. A-7E from VA-72 flying over the Saudi desert during Operation Desert Shield Navy A-7E squadrons VA-15 and VA-87, from USS Independence, provided close air support during the Invasion of Grenada, codenamed Operation Urgent Fury, in October 1983. Navy A-7s also provided air support during the U.S. mission in Lebanon in 1983. An A-7 and an A-6 Intruder were shot down by Syrian surface-to-air missiles (SAM) on 4 December 1983. The A-7 pilot, Commander Edward Andrews, managed to guide his failing Corsair over coastal waters before ejecting; he was rescued by a Lebanese fishing boat and safely returned to the U.S. Marines. =Libya= On 24 March 1986, during the Gulf of Sidra dispute with Libya, Libyan air defense operators launched SA-5 missiles at two Fighter Squadron 102 (VF-102) Grumman F-14 Tomcats from USS America that were orbiting in international air space on a Combat Air Patrol (CAP) station. A-7s operating from responded by launching the first AGM-88 HARM missiles ever used in combat. On the next day, A-6s attacked Libyan warships approaching the US fleet, while A-7s again launched HARM missiles against Libyan SAM sites. In April 1986, navy Sixth Fleet A-7Es from VA-72 and VA-46 embarked on board USS America also participated in Operation El Dorado Canyon, the retaliatory attack on Libya, using HARM and Shrike anti-radar missiles to protect the naval strike force from SAMs. =Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm= While USAF A-7s stayed home in favor of A-10s, the USN deployed two of its last A-7E squadrons to Operation Desert Shield in August 1990 aboard , the only carrier of six deployed to Desert Storm to operate the A-7. The navy squadrons VA-46 and VA-72 made the last combat sorties of the A-7 in Operation Desert Storm flying from the Red Sea to targets throughout Iraq. The A-7 was used both day and night to attack a wide range of heavily defended deep interdiction targets in Iraq as well as \\"kill boxes\\" (geographically defined kill zones) in Kuwait, employing a variety of weapons including precision-guided munitions (PGMs), such as the TV-guided Walleye glide bomb, unguided general-purpose bombs, and High Speed Anti-Radiation missiles (HARM). The A-7 was also used as a tanker in numerous in-flight refueling missions. =Use in F-117 development= The 4450th Tactical Group stationed at Nellis AFB, Nevada had the distinction of being the last active USAF unit to operate the A-7 Corsair II. The mission of the 4450th TG was the operational development of the F-117, and the unit needed a surrogate aircraft for pilot training and practice. A-7Ds and A-7Ks were obtained from various active duty and air national guard squadrons and were assigned initially to the \\"(P)\\" or \\"Provisional\\" unit of the 4450th Tactical Group, redesignated the 4451st Tactical Squadron in January 1983. The A-7s were used as a deception and training aircraft by the group between 1981 and 1989. It was selected because it demanded a similar pilot workload expected in the F-117A, was single seat, and many of the F-117A pilots had F-4 or F-111 backgrounds. A-7s were used for pilot training before any F-117As had been delivered, to bring all pilots to a common flight training base line. Later, the A-7s were used as chase planes on F-117A tests and other weapon tests at the Nellis Range. A-7D-5-CV AF Serial No. 69-6241 of the 4451st Test Squadron / 4450th Tactical Group at Nellis AFB, Nevada in 1984 A-7 flight operations began in June 1981 concurrent with the very first YF-117A flights. The A-7s wore a unique \\"LV\\" tailcode (for Las Vegas) and had a dark purple/black paint motif. The A-7s were based officially at Nellis Air Force Base and were maintained by the 4450th Maintenance Squadron. In addition to providing an excuse for the 4450th's existence and activities, the A-7s were also used to maintain pilot currency, particularly in the early stages when very few production F-117As were available. The pilots learned to fly chase on F-117A test and training flights, perform practice covert deployments, and practice any other purpose that could not be accomplished using F-117As, given the tight restrictions imposed on all F-117A operations. Some A-7s operated from the Tonopah Test Range Airport, about southeast of Tonopah, Nevada where the F-117s were being operationally tested. As a deception operation, care was taken to ensure that F-117As were never left parked outside aircraft hangars during daylight hours. However, A-7s were deliberately and routinely left outside hangars for the benefit of any orbiting Soviet spy satellites. Soviet intelligence agencies examining spy satellite imagery of the base would undoubtedly notice the A-7s parked on the Tonopah flight line, and would not be particularly interested. The intention of this deception was to convince the Soviets that Tonopah operated nothing more exciting than some obsolete A-7 Corsairs. The cover story to the public was that the A-7s were flying \\"radar calibration missions\\" out of Tonopah. Also, in order to help maintain the deception, about five or six A-7Ds were deployed to South Korea in 1984 and 1988. In South Korea they trained with the Army for about a month in Close Air Support operations. It appeared to the Russians that it was a real squadron with a combat mission because the aircraft could be seen having munitions loaded and performing training missions. EA-7L pilot LT Lori \\"Wrench\\" Melling (left) and ECMO LT Laura \\"Moose\\" Mason (right) of VAQ-34 at Elmendorf AFB, 1987 There were approximately 20 A-7D aircraft used in developing the F-117, including several two-seat A-7K trainers. In January 1989, three months after the USAF admitted the F-117A existed, the A-7s were retired to the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center (AMARC) and were replaced by AT-38B Talons as training aircraft and the 4451st TS was deactivated. Training retirement and foreign users Prototype YA-7Ds 67-14582 and 67-14584, along with 69-6191 and 69-6217 making last flyover retirement formation over Edwards AFB, California, heading to AMARC, August 1992 Pilots quipped that the Corsair \\"is not very fast, but it sure is slow.\\" For dissimilar air combat training (DACT), and aerial demonstrations by the Blue Angels, the Navy would choose the more nimble A-4 Skyhawk as a subsonic maneuvering platform, as some considered the A-7 to be inadequate in air combat, even though it was highly maneuverable. While some questioned its air combat capability it was widely regarded as a highly successful attack aircraft, partly by virtue of being a stable bombing platform. Despite this, the Marine Corps also rejected the Corsair, opting instead for the V/STOL (Vertical/Short Take Off or Landing) AV-8 Harrier as its light attack aircraft to replace its A-4F/M Skyhawks. Greece's Hellenic Air Force ordered sixty new A-7H aircraft and five TA-7Hs in 1974. The delivery of the airplanes started in 1975 and equipped the 347, 340, 345 Squadrons. In 1993 Hellenic Air Force received an additional sixty-two A-7Es and nineteen TA-7C surplus USN airplanes who were given to the 335 and 336 Squadrons. The last A-7Es were retired in October 2014 from the 336th Bomber Squadron. The sale of A-7s to Pakistan was not approved due to US opposition to its nuclear program. General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcons began replacing the Air National Guard Corsairs beginning in the late 1980s and the last were retired in 1993 by the units at Rickenbacker Air National Guard Base, Ohio; Des Moines Air National Guard Base, Iowa; Tulsa Air National Guard Base, Oklahoma; and Springfield Air National Guard Base, Ohio. USN A-7 Corsairs began being phased out of the fleet during the mid-1980s with the arrival of the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet. A-7 squadrons of the United States Navy Reserve transitioned concurrent with (but prior to the completion of) all Regular Navy squadrons. The last Navy A-7s were retired by the last fleet operational squadrons (VA-46 and VA-72) in May 1991 shortly after their return from Operation Desert Storm. By the end of 1998, with the exception of some airframes used as static displays, all US A-7s were disposed of by the AMARC. Some of these surplus aircraft were passed to Greece, Thailand and Portugal. The last Portuguese Air Force A-7Ps were retired in 2007 after 26 years. The Corsair II served for 49 years.

It was designed to provide more firepower than light and medium ground-attack aircraft in certain situations when ground forces called for close air support. Design and development The AC-47 was a United States Air Force (USAF) C-47, (the military version of the DC-3) that had been modified by mounting three 7.62 mm General Electric miniguns to fire through two rear window openings and the side cargo door, all on the left (pilot's) side of the aircraft, to provide close air support for ground troops. Other armament configurations could also be found on similar C-47-based aircraft around the world. The guns were actuated by a control on the pilot's yoke whereby he could control the guns either individually or together, although gunners were also among the crew to assist with gun failures and similar issues. It could orbit the target for hours, providing suppressing fire over an elliptical area about 52 yd (47.5 m) in diameter, placing a round every 2.4 yd (2.2 m) during a three-second burst. The aircraft also carried flares it could drop to illuminate the battleground. AC-47 The AC-47 had no previous design to gauge how successful it would be, because it was the first of its kind. The USAF found itself in a precarious situation when requests for additional gunships began to come in because it simply lacked miniguns to fit additional aircraft after the first two conversions. The next four aircraft were equipped with ten .30 caliber AN/M2 machine guns. These weapons, using World War II and Korean War ammunition stocks, were quickly discovered to jam easily, produce large amounts of gases from firing, and, even in ten-gun groups, only provide the density of fire of a single minigun. All four of these aircraft were retrofitted to the standard armament configuration when additional miniguns arrived. The AC-47 initially used SUU-11/A gun pods that were installed on locally fabricated mounts for the gunship application. Emerson Electric eventually developed the MXU-470/A to replace the gun pods, which were also used on later gunships. Operational history=United States Air Force AC-47 at Nha Trang Air Base in South Vietnam In August 1964, years of fixed-wing gunship experimentation reached a new peak with Project Tailchaser under the direction of Captain John C. Simons. This test involved the conversion of a single Convair C-131B to be capable of firing a single GAU-2/A Minigun at a downward angle out of the left side of the aircraft. Even crude grease pencil crosshairs were quickly discovered to enable a pilot flying in a pylon turn to hit a stationary area target with relative accuracy and ease. The Armament Development and Test Center tested the craft at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, but lack of funding, soon suspended the tests. In 1964, Captain Ron W. Terry returned from temporary duty in South Vietnam as part of an Air Force Systems Command team reviewing all aspects of air operations in counter-insurgency warfare, where he had noted the usefulness of C-47s and C-123s orbiting as flare ships during night attacks on fortified hamlets. He received permission to conduct a live- fire test using the C-131 and revived the side-firing gunship program. By October, Terry's team under Project Gunship provided a C-47D, which was converted to a similar standard as the Project Tailchaser aircraft and armed with three miniguns, which were initially mounted on locally fabricated mounts‚Äîessentially strapped gun pods intended for fixed-wing aircraft (SUU-11/A) onto a mount allowing them to be fired remotely out the port side. Terry and a testing team arrived at Bien Hoa Air Base, South Vietnam, on 2 December 1964, with equipment needed to modify two C-47s. The first test aircraft (43-48579, a C-47B-5-DK mail courier converted to C-47D standard by removal of its superchargers) was ready by 11 December, the second by 15 December, and both were allocated to the 1st Air Commando Squadron for combat testing. The newly dubbed \\"FC-47\\" often operated under the radio call sign \\"Puff\\". Its primary mission involved protecting villages, hamlets, and personnel from mass attacks by Vietcong (VC) guerrilla units. Puff's first significant success occurred on the night of 23‚Äì24 December 1964. An FC-47 arrived over the Special Forces outpost at Tranh Yend in the Mekong Delta just 37 minutes after an air support request, fired 4,500 rounds of ammunition, and broke the VC attack. The FC-47 was then called to support a second outpost at Trung Hung, about away. The aircraft again blunted the VC attack and forced a retreat. Between 15 and 26 December, all the FC-47's 16 combat sorties were successful. On 8 February 1965, an FC-47 flying over the B·ªìng S∆°n area demonstrated its capabilities in the process of blunting a VC offensive. For over four hours, it fired 20,500 rounds into a VC hilltop position, killing an estimated 300 VC troops. The early gunship trials were so successful, the second aircraft was returned to the United States early in 1965 to provide crew training. In July 1965, Headquarters USAF ordered TAC to establish an AC-47 squadron. By November 1965, a total of five aircraft were operating with the 4th Air Commando Squadron, activated in August as the first operational unit, and by the end of 1965, a total of 26 had been converted. Training Detachment 8, 1st Air Commando Wing, was subsequently established at Forbes AFB, Kansas. In Operation Big Shoot, the 4th ACS in Vietnam grew to 20 AC-47s (16 aircraft plus four reserves for attrition). The 4th ACS deployed to Tan Son Nhut Air Base, Vietnam, on 14 November 1965. Now using the call sign Spooky, each of its three 7.62 mm miniguns could selectively fire either 50 or 100 rounds per second.It can be seen in action here. Cruising in an overhead left-hand orbit at 120 knots air speed at an altitude of , the gunship could put a bullet or glowing red tracer (every fifth round) bullet into every square yard of a football field-sized target in potentially less than 10 seconds. As long as its 45-flare and 24,000-round basic load of ammunition held out, it could do this intermittently while loitering over the target for hours. In May 1966, the squadron moved north to Nha Trang Air Base to join the newly activated 14th Air Commando Wing. The 3rd Air Commando Squadron was activated at Nha Trang on 5 April 1968 as a second AC-47 squadron, with both squadrons redesignated as Special Operations Squadrons on 1 August 1968. Flights of both squadrons were stationed at bases throughout South Vietnam, and one flight of the 4th SOS served at Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base with the 432nd Tactical Reconnaissance Wing. The work of the two AC-47 squadrons, each with 16 AC-47s flown by aircrews younger than the aircraft they flew, was undoubtedly a key contributor to the award of the Presidential Unit Citation to the 14th Air Commando Wing in June 1968. MXU-470/A minigun modules in an AC-47 One of the most publicized battles of the Vietnam War was the Battle of Khe Sanh in early 1968. More than 24,000 tactical and 2,700 B-52 strikes dropped 110,000 tons of ordnance in attacks that averaged over 300 sorties per day. During the two and a half months of combat, fighters were in the air day and night. At night, AC-47 gunships kept up constant fire against enemy troops and provided illumination for the base. The AC-47D gunship should not be confused with a small number of C-47s that were fitted with electronic equipment in the 1950s. Prior to 1962, these aircraft were designated AC-47D. When a new designation system was adopted in 1962, these became EC-47Ds. The original gunships had been designated FC-47D by the USAF, but with protests from fighter pilots, this designation was changed to AC-47D during 1965. Of the 53 aircraft converted to AC-47 configuration, 41 served in Vietnam and 19 were lost to all causes, 12 in combat.Hobson, Chris. Vietnam Air Losses, USAF/USN/USMC, Fixed-Wing Aircraft Losses in Southeast Asia 1961‚Äì1973. North Branch, Minnesota: Specialty Press, 2001. . Combat reports indicate that no village or hamlet under Spooky protection was ever lost, and a plethora of reports from civilians and military personnel were made about AC-47s coming to the rescue and saving their lives. As the United States began Project Gunship II and Project Gunship III, many of the remaining AC-47Ds were transferred to the Republic of Vietnam Air Force, the Royal Lao Air Force, and Cambodia's Khmer Air Force, after Prince Norodom Sihanouk was deposed in a coup by General Lon Nol. Airman First Class John L. Levitow, an AC-47 loadmaster with the 3rd SOS, received the Medal of Honor for saving his aircraft, Spooky 71, from destruction on 24 February 1969 during a fire-support mission at Long Binh. The aircraft was struck by an 82-mm mortar round that inflicted 3,500 shrapnel holes, wounding Levitow 40 times, but he used his body to jettison an armed magnesium flare, which ignited shortly after Levitow ejected it from the aircraft, allowing the AC-47 to return to base. Other air forces North Vietnam captured several AC-47s in 1975, and some of them are very likely to have seen combat in Cambodia. In December 1984 and January 1985, the United States supplied two AC-47D gunships to the El Salvador Air Force (FAS) and trained aircrews to operate the system.–ê. –ö—É–≤—à–∏–Ω–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤. \\"–î—Ä–∞–∫–æ–Ω—ã\\" —Ä–∞—Å–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª—è—é—Ç –∫—Ä—ã–ª—å—è // \\"–ò–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏—è\\", ‚Ññ 12 (21089) –æ—Ç 12 —è–Ω–≤–∞—Ä—è 1985. —Å—Ç—Ä.4 The AC-47 gunship carried three .50 cal machine guns and could loiter and provide heavy firepower for army operations. As the FAS had long operated C-47s, training pilots and crew to operate the aircraft as a weapons platform was easy for the United States. By all accounts, the AC-47 soon became probably the most effective weapon in the FAS arsenal.Corum, James S. and Johnson, Wray R. \\"Airpower in Small Wars: Fighting Insurgents and Terrorists\\" Kansas University Press: 2003. . p.337. =Armed conversions of C-47s (not Douglas AC-47s)= In 2006, Colombia started operating five armed Basler BT-67 (Colombian Air Force designation : AC-47T), known by civilians as avion fantasma (ghost plane), on counter-insurgency operations in conjunction with Sikorsky AH-60 Arpia armed helicopters and Cessna A-37 Dragonflys against local illegally armed groups. The BT-67s are armed with .50 cal (12.7 mm) GAU-19/A machine guns slaved to a forward looking infrared system.

At least one has been seen fitted with one GAU-19/A and a 20 mm cannon, most likely a French-made M621. The BT-67s are C-47/DC-3s modified by the Basler Corporation of Oshkosh, Wisconsin, and are not variants of the Douglas AC-47. In 1970, the Indonesian Air Force converted a former civilian DC-3. The converted aircraft was armed with three .50 cal machine guns. During 1975, the Indonesian Air Force used its \\"AC-47\\" in the Indonesian invasion of East Timor to attack the city of Dili. Later, the aircraft was used in Indonesian military close air support missions in East Timor. Its retirement date is unknown. Armed variants of the C-47, including the BT-67, have been used by various air forces including those of Laos, Cambodia, South Africa, El Salvador, and Rhodesia. Several weapons configurations were used, including Gatling guns of numerous types, various medium and heavy machine guns, and larger autocannon (South African \\"Dragon Daks\\" were known to fit 20 mm cannons). The Republic of China Air Force (Taiwan) also converted some of its C-47s to gunships. These machines were armed with M2 machine guns taken from retired F-86 Sabres.

The county seat is Dubrovnik and other large towns are Korƒçula, Metkoviƒá, Opuzen and Ploƒçe. The Municipality of Neum, which belongs to neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina, divides the county in two parts. The southern part of the county consists of Dubrovnik and the surrounding area, including the Pelje≈°ac peninsula, and the islands of Korƒçula, Lastovo, Mljet, ≈†ipan, Lopud and Koloƒçep. The northern part of the county includes the Neretva Delta, the Baƒáina lakes north of Ploƒçe, and a swath of hinterland near the southernmost slopes of Biokovo and around the hill of Rujnica. Although the 9 kilometres-long stretch of coast belonging to Neum effectively makes the southern part of the county an exclave (disconnecting it from mainland Croatia) it is still connected with the rest of the country via territorial waters. Road traffic going to and from Dubrovnik through Neum is usually less subject to customs controls in order to reduce the traffic congestion. The road connecting Dubrovnik to the rest of the country via Neum has one lane per direction and bus lines passing through Neum often make rest stops there so that passengers can take advantage of lower Bosnian taxes and purchase tobacco and alcoholic beverages as they tend to be cheaper there. The Croatian and Bosnian governments are planning to build an expressway that would connect Dubrovnik through the Neum municipality and would not require any border control. The regional government of the county is also planning to build a sea bridge at Komarna that would directly connect the southern tip of the northern part of the county to the Pelje≈°ac peninsula (the Pelje≈°ac bridge), thereby linking the southern part of the county as well. The northern part of the Mljet island is a national park. The Lastovo archipelago is a designated nature park. The southernmost tip of the county is the demilitarized Prevlaka peninsula at the border with Montenegro. It is the only Croatian county that borders Montenegro.

Inhabitants of Varennes-Jarcy are known as Varennois. Remarkable sites Dedicated to Saint-Sulpice, bishop of Bourges, the church was built at the end of the 13th century, between 1269 and 1282. It is a large chapel with ogival vault, comprising 4 tumulary stones (tombs), which have been classified historic buildings since February 1915. They are indicated on the left and on the right entry by 2 commemorative plates. They are tombs seigneuriales: : On the left: Those of Fr√©min de la Sangle, died in 1492, and that of Fran√ßoise de Feugeras, his widow, who owned the properties of Varennes and P√©rigny. :On the right: Those of Louis de la Sangle going back to 1549, and that of his mother, the stones have become illegible today. The church shelters also a superb white marble statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary, dated from the end of the 17th century and known under the name of MATER Dolorosa. It comes from the Abbaye de Jarcy, from where it was saved during the French Revolution and was installed there between 1792 and 1804, at the same time as the altar and the wooden sculpture of Saint Roch, dating from the 16th century. Many alterations took place over the strands of time, as the history testifies, to some to the stained glass windows. The stained glass windows of were 13th century were installed in the abbey church during work carried out about 1652, and were reused in the church of the commune of Jarcy. In 1882, significant repairs were necessary and the stained glass was then put on sale. Monsieur Bosquillon, ch√¢telain de Jarcy, become purchaser for 450 francs in the money of the day, but finally it was the state which, 3 years later, bought them for the sum of 600 francs, on behalf of the museum of Decorative Arts. They represent: :the tree of Jesse, dating back to 1215-1220 :the miracle of Saint Martin, Bishop of Tours, dating back to 1230-1240 These two works formed the basis of a museum of the stained glass, before being stored within the Mus√©e de Cluny. According to the statements of the Easter painter and glass maker, having restored these stained glasses in 1741, \\"the glare of the colors recalls the large canopies of the cathedral of Chartres, and the Gothic paintings are like those of the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris\\". With the revolution, after an inventory of all the church (ornamentation, pieces of furniture) and a financial statement of the Factory, all will be wasted with the profit of the commune and the church will be transformed into \\"Temple de la raison\\". One even projected, if time allowed it, to cut down the cross of the bell-tower on December 25, 1793! The bell dates back to 1781 and failed, like many others, being melted in 1867. Lastly, to release the village square, the old cemetery located around the church, was separated from the village in 1876: The first burial took place in 1886. On right-hand side of the entry, a stele commemorates old Varennois (inhabitants of Varenne) buried in the first cemetery since the 16th century.

The degree is conferred in several countries, including the Commonwealth of Nations, Canada, the United States and elsewhere. Australia In Australia, the Bachelor of Technology (BTech) degree is offered by RMIT University, Edith Cowan University, Curtin University and certain private institutions. Canada In Canada, the Bachelor of Technology degree is offered by both universities and colleges. In some provinces, the degree may also be referred to as Bachelor of Applied Technology (BAT). Depending on the institution and location, different provinces hold different prerequisites and requirements for this degree. Majority of Canadian post-secondary institutions offer a blend of engineering theory and technological practice in the Bachelor of Technology degree. India In India, B.Tech. (Bachelor of Technology) and BE (Bachelor of Engineering) are the same and offered in engineering disciplines. Bachelor of Technology or Bachelor of Engineering qualifications include the following: * 3 years BE/B.Tech. after Diploma in Engineering * 4 years BE/B.Tech. after class 12 Degree is regulated under the aegis of University Grants Commission of India (UGC), All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and National Board of Accreditation (NBA). Admission is usually through an entrance examination. Zimbabwe In Zimbabwe, B.Tech. and M.Tech. programmes are offered by Harare Institute of Technology (HIT) and carry the same weight with any other degree. BTech is commonly a 4 year programme with one year of industrial internship and a 4th year capstone design project. The MTech programme is a two year programme. The core of these degrees is the study and practical application of technologies in various fields of study. Kenya In Kenya, B.Tech. is not a very common course. Technical University of Kenya (TU-K), located in the country's capital and Murang'a University of Technology (MUT) offer B.Tech. in Engineering and Information Technology.

They replaced the Douglas AC-47 Spooky and operated alongside the early versions of the AC-130 Spectre gunship. Design and development By late 1967, the idea of the fixed-wing gunship had been proven so successful, the United States Air Force was having a difficult time keeping up with demand. The newer AC-130s that had been created under Project Gunship II were effective, but were being mostly used for armed reconnaissance and interdiction of the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Furthermore, the C-130 airframe was in active service as a transport, vital to the war effort in Southeast Asia. The Air Force desperately needed a new gunship to replace the vulnerable and underpowered AC-47 in the close air support role, as well as supplementing the AC-130 in attacking targets on the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar presented an obvious choice, having been phased out of front- line service in favor of the C-123 and C-130, and with the stock of available airframes in U.S. Air Force Reserve being sufficient. In February 1968, under the USAF program Project Gunship III, 26 C-119Gs were converted to AC-119G standard, initially taking on the name \\"Creep\\", but later assigned the callsign \\"Shadow\\".\\"Fairchild AC-119 Gunship 'Shadow'.\\" strategic-air-command. Retrieved: 8 May 2012. In addition, Fairchild-Hiller, which was contracted for all the conversions, converted another 26 C-119Gs into AC-119Ks, primarily for the \\"truck hunter\\" role over the Ho Chi Minh Trail. These aircraft were called \\"Stingers\\" primarily in reference to the two M61 Vulcan 20-mm cannons they carried in addition to the AC-119G's four GAU-2/A miniguns. The AC-119K could be visually distinguished by the addition of two General Electric J85 turbojet engines in underwing pods. The conversions were completed at Fairchild- Hiller's facility in St. Augustine, Florida. Project Gunship III, being a follow-on to the success of the AC-130 series, meant that the AC-119 was a more advanced aircraft in both its iterations than the AC-47. Even the TIC AC-119G featured some of the most up-to-date electronic countermeasures and radar equipment, as well as more basic technology, including an AVQ-8 xenon light, a night observation sight, and an LAU-74/A flare launcher. The AC-119K, designed to hit trucks on the Ho Chi Minh Trail, was more advanced. Included in the conversion was the AN/APN-147 Doppler navigation radar, AN/AAD-4 forward looking infrared, AN/APQ-133 side-looking beacon tracking radar and AN/APQ-136 search radar. The armament scheme for both aircraft was simpler than that of the AC-130. The AC-119G had a total of four GAU-2A/A miniguns in SUU-11A/A pods, all on mounts similar to those used on early AC-47s. Like late-model AC-47s, these were soon changed to the purpose-built MXU-470/A minigun modules. The AC-119K, needing a more powerful and longer range \\"punch\\" to take out vehicles, featured two M61 20-mm cannons in addition to the four miniguns of the AC-119G. Operational history One of the J85 turbojet engines added to later models of the AC-119 is visible in this photo. By November 1968, the aircraft had deployed to Vietnam and joined the 14th Special Operations Wing at Nha Trang Air Base. The AC-119Gs were placed in the 71st Special Operations Squadron which was formed from the activated 71st Troop Carrier Squadron, of the Air Force Reserve located at Bakalar Air Force Base in Columbus, Indiana. When the 71 SOS returned to continental USA in 1969, the gunships were taken over by the newly formed 17 SOS. The AC-119Ks were placed in the 18th Special Operations Squadron. With the addition of the two types, the 14 SOW for a time in 1968 was flying eight different aircraft from ten different bases in South Vietnam. The 14 SOW was inactivated in 1971. Limited numbers continued to be operated out of Thailand as late as the fall of 1972, but the AC-119 was phased out shortly after from the US Air Force. The AC-119G and 119K continued to serve with the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) until the Fall of Saigon in 1975. During the Vietnam War, only five AC-119 Gunship IIIs were lost to all causes.Hobson 2001 Operators ; Republic of Vietnam Air Force ; United States Air Force * 14th Special Operations Wing ‚Äì Nha Trang Air Base, South Vietnam :: 17th Special Operations Squadron 1969‚Äì1971 :: 18th Special Operations Squadron 1969‚Äì1971 :: 71st Special Operations Squadron 1968‚Äì1969 :: (Detachments at Tan San Nhut, Phan Rang and Phu Cat AB) * 56th Special Operations Wing ‚Äì Nakhon Phanom Air Base, Thailand :: 18th Special Operations Squadron 1971‚Äì1972 Surviving example * AC-119G Shadow, AF Ser.

Born in Bristol, she taught at a school established there by her father and began writing plays. She became involved with the London literary elite, and rose to be a leading Bluestocking member. Later her plays and poetry became more evangelical and she joined a group campaigning against the slave trade. In the 1790s she wrote several Cheap Repository Tracts on moral, religious and political topics, for distribution to the literate poor. Meanwhile, she increased her philanthropic work in the Mendip area, encouraged by William Wilberforce. Early life Born in 1745 at Fishponds in the parish of Stapleton, near Bristol, Hannah More was the fourth of five daughters of Jacob More (1700‚Äì1783), a schoolmaster originally from Harleston, Norfolk. He was from a strong Presbyterian family in Norfolk, but had become a member of the Church of England, and originally intended to pursue a career in the Church, but after the disappointment of losing a lawsuit over an estate he had hoped to inherit, he moved to Bristol, where he became an excise officer and was later appointed to teach at the Fishponds free school. They were a close family and the sisters were first educated by their father, learning Latin and mathematics: Hannah was also taught by her elder sisters, through whom she learned French. Her conversational French was improved by spending time with French prisoners of war in Frenchay during the Seven Years' War. She was an assiduous student with a sharp intellect, and according to family tradition began writing at an early age. In 1758 Jacob established a girls' boarding school at Trinity Street in Bristol for the elder sisters, Mary and Elizabeth to run, while he and his wife moved to Stony Hill in the city to open a school for boys. Hannah More became a pupil when she was twelve years old, and taught at the school in her early adulthood. In 1767 More gave up her share in the school after becoming engaged to William Turner of the Belmont Estate, Wraxall, Somerset, whom she had met when he began teaching her cousins. After six years the wedding had not taken place. Turner seemed reluctant to name a date and in 1773 the engagement was broken off. It seems that as a result, More suffered a nervous breakdown and spent some time recuperating in Uphill, near Weston-super-Mare. Hannah More was induced to accept a ¬£200 annuity from Turner as compensation. This freed her for literary pursuits, and in the winter of 1773‚Äì1774 she went to London with her sisters, Sarah and Martha‚Äîthe first of many such trips at yearly intervals. Some verses that she had written on David Garrick's version of King Lear led to an acquaintance with him. Playwright More's first literary efforts were pastoral plays, written while she was still teaching and suitable for young ladies to act. The first was The Search after Happiness, written in 1762. By the mid-1780s over 10,000 copies of this had been sold.S. J. Skedd, \\"More, Hannah (1745‚Äì1833)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004). Among her literary models was Metastasio whose opera 'Attilio Regulo she used as a basis for a drama, The Inflexible Captive. More (standing, left, as a personification of Melpomene, muse of tragedy), in the company of other \\"bluestockings\\" (1778). In London, More sought to associate herself with the literary elite, including Samuel Johnson, Joshua Reynolds and Edmund Burke. Johnson is quoted as saying to her, \\"Madam, before you flatter a man so grossly to his face, you should consider whether or not your flattery is worth having.\\" He would later be quoted as calling her \\"the finest versifatrix in the English language\\". Meanwhile she became a prominent member of the Bluestocking group of women engaged in polite conversation and literary and intellectual pursuits. She attended the salon of Elizabeth Montagu, where she became acquainted with Frances Boscawen, Elizabeth Carter, Elizabeth Vesey and Hester Chapone, some of whom would become lifelong friends. In 1782 she wrote a witty verse celebration of her friends and the circle to which they belonged, The Bas Bleu, or, Conversation, published in 1784. Garrick wrote a prologue and epilogue for Hannah More's tragedy Percy, which was shown successfully at Covent Garden in December 1777, and revived in 1785 with Sarah Siddons at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. A copy of Percy was found amongst Mozart's possessions in 1791. Another drama, The Fatal Falsehood, produced in 1779 after Garrick's death, was less successful, and she never wrote for the stage again. However, a tragedy entitled \\"The Inflexible Captive\\" was published in 1818.Hannah More, 1818 In 1781 she first met Horace Walpole and corresponded with him from that time onwards. At Bristol she discovered the poet Ann Yearsley, and when Yearsley became destitute, she raised a considerable sum of money for her benefit. Lactilia, as Yearsley was known, published Poems, on Several Occasions in 1785, earning about ¬£600. More and Montagu held the profits in trust to protect them from Yearsley's husband. However, Ann Yearsley wished to receive the capital and made insinuations of stealing against More, forcing her to release the money. These literary and social failures lay behind More's withdrawal from London intellectual circles. Evangelical moralist Biscuit porcelain figure by Mintons, 1830s In the 1780s Hannah More became a friend of James Oglethorpe, who had long been concerned with slavery as a moral issue and who was working with Granville Sharp as an early abolitionist.Wilson, Thomas. The Oglethorpe Plan. Epilogue. Charlottesville, Va.: University of Virginia Press, 2012. More published Sacred Dramas in 1782, which rapidly ran through 19 editions. These and the poems Bas-Bleu and Florio (1786) mark her gradual transition to more serious views, fully expressed in prose in her Thoughts on the Importance of the Manners of the Great to General Society (1788) and An Estimate of the Religion of the Fashionable World (1790). By this time she was close to William Wilberforce and Zachary Macaulay, sympathising with their evangelical views. She published a poem, Slavery in 1788. For many years she was a friend of Beilby Porteus, Bishop of London and a leading abolitionist, who drew her into a group of prominent campaigners against the slave trade that included Wilberforce, Charles Middleton and James Ramsay, based at Teston in Kent. In 1785 More bought a house at Cowslip Green, near Wrington in northern Somerset, where she settled into country life with her sister Martha, and wrote several ethical books and tracts: Strictures on the Modern System of Female Education (1799), Hints towards Forming the Character of a Young Princess (1805), Coelebs in Search of a Wife (only nominally a story, 1809), Practical Piety (1811), Christian Morals (1813), Character of St Paul (1815), Moral Sketches (1819). She was a rapid writer and her work consequently discursive and animated, but lacking in form. Her huge popularity may be explained by the originality and force of her writings. The outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789 did not worry More initially, but by 1790 she was writing, \\"I have conceived an utter aversion to liberty according to the present idea of it in France. What a cruel people they are!\\"M. G. Jones, Hannah More (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1952), pp. 134‚Äì135. She praised Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France for combining \\"the rhetoric of ancient Gaul\\" and the \\"patriot spirit of ancient Rome\\" with \\"the deepest political sagacity\\".Jones, p. 135. Part II of the Rights of Man, Thomas Paine's reply to Burke, appeared in 1792. The government was alarmed by its concern for the poor and its call for world revolution, plus its enormous sales. Porteus visited More and asked her to write something for the lower orders, to counteract Paine.Jones, pp. 133‚Äì134. This prompted the pamphlet Village Politics (1792). More called it \\"as a vulgar as [the] heart can wish; but it is only designed for the most vulgar class of readers.\\"Jones, p. 134. The pamphlet (published pseudonymously by \\"Will Chip\\") consists of a dialogue in plain English between Jack Anvil, the village blacksmith, and Tom Hood, the village mason. After reading Paine, Tom Hood expresses admiration for the French Revolution to Jack Anvil, and speaks in favour of a new constitution based on liberty and the \\"rights of man\\". Jack Anvil responds by praising the British constitution and saying that Britain already has \\"the best laws in the world\\". He attacks French liberty as murder, French democracy as tyranny of the majority, French equality as a levelling down of social classes, French philosophy as atheism, and the \\"rights of man\\" as \\"battle, murder and sudden death\\". Tom Hood finally accepts Jack Anvil's conclusion: \\"While old England is safe I'll glory in her, and pray for her; and when she is in danger I'll fight for her and die for her.\\"Jones, pp. 135‚Äì136. More's biographer summed up the pamphlet against Paine as \\"Burke for Beginners\\". It was well received: Porteus praised it as \\"a masterpiece of its kind, supremely excellent, greatly admired at Windsor\\". Frances Boscawen considered it better than William Paley's The British Public's Reasons for Contentment and Richard Owen Cambridge claimed \\"Swift could not have done it better.\\"Jones, p. 136. More's next anti-Jacobin tract, Remarks on the Speech of M. Dupont, condemned atheism in France. Its profits were assigned to French Catholic priests exiled in England.Jones, p. 137. In 1794, when Paine published The Age of Reason, a deist attack on Christianity, Porteus again requested More's help in combating Paine's ideas, but she refused, being preoccupied with her charity-school work. However, by the end of the year, More, encouraged by Porteus, decided to embark on her Cheap Repository Tracts, which from 1795 to 1798 appeared at a rate of three a month. In January 1795, More explained to Zachary Macaulay: \\"Vulgar and indecent penny books were always common, but speculative infidelity brought down to the pockets and capacity of the poor forms a new era in our history. This requires strong counteraction.\\"Jones, pp. 140‚Äì141. More's Tracts were a phenomenal success, selling 300,000 copies between March and April 1795, 700,000 by July 1795, and over two million by March 1796.Jones, p. 142. They urged the poor in rhetoric of most ingenious homeliness to rely upon the virtues of content, sobriety, humility, industry, reverence for the British Constitution, hatred of the French, and trust in God and the kindness of the gentry. Perhaps the most famous of these is The Shepherd of Salisbury Plain, describing a family of phenomenal frugality and contentment. This was translated into several languages. Blue Plaque on the wall of Keepers Cottage, Brislington. She was shocked by the strides made for female education in France, saying \\"they run to study philosophy, and neglect their families to be present at lectures in anatomy.\\" Philanthropist In 1785 Hannah More moved to a cottage in rural Somerset, \\"to escape from the world gradually\\". The school at Wedmore received strong opposition from the locals, who petitioned the Dean of Wells to remove her. John Scandrett Harford of Blaise Castle was a prodigious benefactor to More's schools in the 1790s, and More modelled the idealised hero and heroine in Coelebs in Search of Wife (1809) on Mr and Mrs Harford. She refused to read Mary Wollstonecraft's Rights of Women, saying, \\"So many women are fond of government... because they are not fit for it. To be unstable and capricious is but too characteristic of our sex.\\" In 1816, More is quoted as saying that \\"peace with France [is]... a worse evil than war\\" following the Battle of Waterloo, and refused to allow a French translation of Coelebs. She turned down an honorary membership of the Royal Society of Literature because she considered her \\"sex alone a disqualification\\". In the late 1780s, Hannah and Martha More did philanthropic work in the Mendip area, following encouragement by Wilberforce, who saw the poor conditions of the local people when he visited Cheddar in 1789. She was instrumental in setting up twelve schools by 1800, where reading, the Bible and the catechism were taught to local children. More also donated money to Bishop Philander Chase for the founding of Kenyon College, where a portrait of her hangs there in Peirce Hall.Kenyon Hall site: [Retrieved 28 March 2012. The More sisters met with a good deal of opposition in their works: farmers thought that education, even to the limited extent of learning to read, would be fatal to agriculture, and clergy, whose neglect she was making good, accused her of Methodist tendencies. However, in her old age, philanthropists from all parts made pilgrimages to see such a bright and amiable old lady, and she retained all her faculties until within two years of her death. She spent the last five years of her life in Clifton, and died on 7 September 1833. She is buried at Church of All Saints, Wrington; busts of her and John Locke remain in the south porch. Legacy Several local schools and St. Michael's Church (Reisterstown, Maryland) are named in her honour. Hannah More Primary School was built in Old Market, Bristol in the 1840s. An image of More was used in 2012 on the Bristol Pound local currency. Hannah More Close in Wrington, where Hannah More is buried, has been named after her as well. Liberal politician Augustine Birrell in his 1906 work Hannah More Once More claimed to have buried all 19 volumes of Moore's works in his garden in disgust.Crossley Evans, MJ, Hannah More, University of Bristol (Bristol branch of the Historical Association, 1999.

Solid mechanics is fundamental for civil, aerospace, nuclear, biomedical and mechanical engineering, for geology, and for many branches of physics such as materials science. It has specific applications in many other areas, such as understanding the anatomy of living beings, and the design of dental prostheses and surgical implants. One of the most common practical applications of solid mechanics is the Euler- Bernoulli beam equation. Solid mechanics extensively uses tensors to describe stresses, strains, and the relationship between them. Solid mechanics is a vast subject because of the wide range of solid materials available, such as steel, wood, concrete, biological materials, textiles, geological materials, and plastics. Fundamental aspects A solid is a material that can support a substantial amount of shearing force over a given time scale during a natural or industrial process or action. This is what distinctly distinguishes solids from fluids, because fluids also support normal forces which are those forces that are directed perpendicular to the material plane across from which they act and normal stress is the normal force per unit area of that material plane. Shearing forces in contrast with normal forces, act parallel rather than perpendicular to the material plane and the shearing force per unit area is called shear stress. Therefore, solid mechanics examines the shear stress, deformation and the failure of solid materials and structures. The most common topics covered in solid mechanics include: # stability of structures - examining whether structures can return to a given equilibrium after disturbance or partial/complete failure # dynamical systems and chaos - dealing with mechanical systems highly sensitive to their given initial position # thermomechanics - analyzing materials with models derived from principles of thermodynamics # biomechanics - solid mechanics applied to biological materials e.g. bones, heart tissue # geomechanics - solid mechanics applied to geological materials e.g. ice, soil, rock # vibrations of solids and structures - examining vibration and wave propagation from vibrating particles and structures i.e. vital in mechanical, civil, mining, aeronautical, maritime/marine, aerospace engineering # fracture and damage mechanics - dealing with crack-growth mechanics in solid materials # composite materials - solid mechanics applied to materials made up of more than one compound e.g. reinforced plastics, reinforced concrete, fiber glass # variational formulations and computational mechanics - numerical solutions to mathematical equations arising from various branches of solid mechanics e.g. finite element method (FEM) # experimental mechanics - design and analysis of experimental methods to examine the behavior of solid materials and structures Relationship to continuum mechanics As shown in the following table, solid mechanics inhabits a central place within continuum mechanics. The field of rheology presents an overlap between solid and fluid mechanics. Response models A material has a rest shape and its shape departs away from the rest shape due to stress. The amount of departure from rest shape is called deformation, the proportion of deformation to original size is called strain. If the applied stress is sufficiently low (or the imposed strain is small enough), almost all solid materials behave in such a way that the strain is directly proportional to the stress; the coefficient of the proportion is called the modulus of elasticity. This region of deformation is known as the linearly elastic region. It is most common for analysts in solid mechanics to use linear material models, due to ease of computation. However, real materials often exhibit non-linear behavior. As new materials are used and old ones are pushed to their limits, non-linear material models are becoming more common. These are basic models that describe how a solid responds to an applied stress: # Elasticity ‚Äì When an applied stress is removed, the material returns to its undeformed state. Linearly elastic materials, those that deform proportionally to the applied load, can be described by the linear elasticity equations such as Hooke's law. # Viscoelasticity ‚Äì These are materials that behave elastically, but also have damping: when the stress is applied and removed, work has to be done against the damping effects and is converted in heat within the material resulting in a hysteresis loop in the stress‚Äìstrain curve. This implies that the material response has time-dependence. # Plasticity ‚Äì Materials that behave elastically generally do so when the applied stress is less than a yield value. When the stress is greater than the yield stress, the material behaves plastically and does not return to its previous state. That is, deformation that occurs after yield is permanent. # Viscoplasticity - Combines theories of viscoelasticity and plasticity and applies to materials like gels and mud. # Thermoelasticity - There is coupling of mechanical with thermal responses. In general, thermoelasticity is concerned with elastic solids under conditions that are neither isothermal nor adiabatic. The simplest theory involves the Fourier's law of heat conduction, as opposed to advanced theories with physically more realistic models.

The P-39 was used by the Soviet Air Force, and enabled individual Soviet pilots to collect the highest number of kills attributed to any U.S. fighter type flown by any air force in any conflict. Other major users of the type included the Free French, the Royal Air Force, the United States Army Air Forces, and the Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force.Gunston 1980, p. 22.

It was also the first fighter fitted with a tricycle undercarriage.Angelucci and Matricardi 1978, p. 25. Although its mid-engine placement was innovative, the P-39 design was handicapped by the absence of an efficient turbo- supercharger, preventing it from performing high-altitude work. For this reason it was rejected by the RAF for use over western Europe but adopted by the USSR, where most air combat took place at medium and lower altitudes. Together with the derivative P-63 Kingcobra, the P-39 was one of the most successful fixed-wing aircraft manufactured by Bell.Bishop, Chris. The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II.

Despite being called an interceptor, the proposed aircraft's role was simply an extension of the traditional pursuit (fighter) role, using a heavier and more powerful aircraft at higher altitude. Specifications called for at least 1,000 lb of heavy armament including a cannon, a liquid-cooled Allison engine with a General Electric turbo-supercharger, tricycle landing gear, a level airspeed of at least at altitude, and a climb to within 6 minutes.Lockheed P-38 Lightning.

Although Bell's limited fighter design work had previously resulted in the unusual Bell YFM-1 Airacuda, the Model 12Donald 1997, p. 106. proposal adopted an equally original configuration with an Allison V-12 engine mounted in the middle of the fuselage, just behind the cockpit, and a propeller driven by a shaft passing beneath the pilot's feet under the cockpit floor. Bell XP-39 showing the position of the supercharger air intake. The main purpose of this configuration was to free up space for the heavy main armament, a 37 mm (1.46 in) Oldsmobile T9 cannon firing through the center of the propeller hub for optimum accuracy and stability. This happened because H.M. Poyer, designer for project leader Robert Woods, was impressed by the power of this weapon and pressed for its incorporation. This was unusual, because fighter design had previously been driven by the intended engine, not the weapon system. Although devastating when it worked, the T9 had very limited ammunition, a low rate of fire, and was prone to jamming.McDowell 1980, p. 10. A secondary benefit of the mid-engine arrangement was that it created a smooth and streamlined nose profile. Much was made of the fact that this resulted in a configuration \\"with as trim and clean a fuselage nose as the snout of a high velocity bullet\\".Woods 1941 Entry to the cockpit was through side doors (mounted on both sides of the cockpit) rather than a sliding canopy. Its unusual engine location and the long drive shaft caused some concern to pilots at first, but experience showed this was no more of a hazard in a crash landing than with an engine located forward of the cockpit. There were no problems with propeller shaft failure. Bell P-39 Airacobra center fuselage detail with maintenance panels open. XP-39 developments The XP-39 made its maiden flight on 6 April 1938. at Wright Field, Ohio, achieving 390 mph (630 km/h) at 20,000 ft (6,100 m), reaching this altitude in only five minutes.Johnsen 1998, p. 7. However, the XP-39 was found to be short on performance at altitude. Flight testing had found its top speed at 20,000 feet to be lower than the 400 mph claimed in the original proposal. As originally specified by Kelsey and Saville, the XP-39 had a turbo-supercharger to augment its high-altitude performance. Bell cooled the turbo with a scoop on the left side of the fuselage.Johnsen 1998, p. 8. Kelsey wished to shepherd the XP-39 through its early engineering teething troubles, but he was ordered to England. The XP-39 project was handed over to others, and in June 1939 the prototype was ordered by General Henry H. Arnold to be evaluated in NACA wind tunnels to find ways of increasing its speed, by reducing parasitic drag.Pearcy 1993, p. 25. Tests were carried out, and Bell engineers followed the recommendations of NACA and the Army to reduce drag such that the top speed was increased 16%. NACA wrote, \\"it is imperative to enclose the supercharger within the airplane with an efficient duct system for cooling the rotor and discharging the cooling air and exhaust gases.\\" In the very tightly planned XP-39, though, there was no internal space left over for the turbo. Using a drag-buildup scheme, a number of potential areas of drag reduction were found. NACA concluded that a top speed of 429 mph could be realized with the aerodynamic improvements they had developed and an uprated V-1710 with only a single-stage, single-speed supercharger.Matthews 1996, p. 97. At a pivotal meeting with the USAAC and NACA in August 1939, Larry Bell proposed that the production P-39 aircraft be configured without the turbocharger.Matthews 1996, p. 101. Some historians have questioned Bell's true motivation in reconfiguring the aircraft. The strongest hypothesis is that Bell's factory did not have an active production program and he was desperate for cash flow. Other historians mention that wind tunnel tests made the designers believe the turbocharger installation was so aerodynamically cluttered that it had more disadvantages than advantages.Matthews 1996, p. 102.Lednicer 2000, p. 2. The Army ordered 12 YP-39s (with only a single-stage, single-speed supercharger) for service evaluationDonald 1997 and one YP-39A. After these trials were complete, which resulted in detail changes including deletion of the external radiator,Fitzsimons 1977, p. 50. and on advice from NACA, the prototype was modified as the XP-39B; after demonstrating a performance improvement, the 13 YP-39s were completed to this standard, adding two 0.30 in (7.62 mm) machine guns to the two existing 0.50 in (12.7 mm) guns. Lacking armor or self-sealing fuel tanks, the prototype was one ton (900 kg) lighter than the production fighters.Kinzey 1999, pp. 9, 13. The production P-39 retained a single-stage, single-speed supercharger with a critical altitude (above which performance declined) of about .Dean 1997, p. 191. As a result, the aircraft was simpler to produce and maintain. However, the deletion of the turbo destroyed any chance that the P-39 could serve as a medium-high altitude front-line fighter. When deficiencies were noticed in 1940 and 1941, the lack of a turbo made it nearly impossible to improve upon the Airacobra's performance. The removal of the turbocharger and its drag inducing inlet cured the drag problem but reduced performance overall. In later years, Kelsey expressed regret at not being present to override the decision to eliminate the turbo.Kelsey 1982 After completing service trials, and originally designated P-45, a first order for 80 aircraft was placed 10 August 1939; the designation reverted to P-39C before deliveries began. After assessing aerial combat conditions in Europe, it was evident that without armor or self-sealing tanks, the 20 production P-39Cs were not suitable for operational use. The remaining 60 machines in the order were built as P-39Ds with armor, self-sealing tanks and enhanced armament. These P-39Ds were the first Airacobras to enter into service with the Army Air Corps units and would be the first ones to see action. Technical details Bell P-39K-L internal layout from Pilot's Flight Operating Instructions P-39K-1 and P-39L-1 (T.O. No. 01-110FG-1) The P-39 was an all-metal, low-wing, single-engine fighter, with a tricycle undercarriage and an Allison V-1710 liquid-cooled V-12 engine mounted in the central fuselage, directly behind the cockpit. The Airacobra was one of the first production fighters to be conceived as a \\"weapons system\\"; in this case the aircraft (known originally as the Bell Model 4) was designed to provide a platform for the 37 mm T9 cannon.Bowers 1978, p. 24. This weapon, which was designed in 1934 by the American Armament Corporation, a division of Oldsmobile, fired a projectile capable of piercing of armor at with armor- piercing rounds. The -long, weapon had to be rigidly mounted and fire parallel to and close to the centerline of the new fighter. It would have been impossible to mount the weapon in the fuselage, firing through the cylinder banks of the Vee-configured engine and the propeller hub as could be done with smaller 20mm cannon. Weight, balance and visibility considerations meant that the cockpit could not be placed farther back in the fuselage, behind the engine and cannon. The solution adopted was to mount the cannon in the forward fuselage and the engine in the center fuselage, directly behind the pilot's seat. The tractor propeller was driven with a drive shaft made in two sections, incorporating a self-aligning bearing to accommodate fuselage deflection during violent maneuvers. This shaft ran through a tunnel in the cockpit floor and was connected to a gearbox in the nose of the fuselage which, in turn, drove the three- or (later) four-bladed propeller by way of a short central shaft. The gearbox was provided with its own lubrication system, separate from the engine; in later versions of the Airacobra the gearbox was provided with some armor protection. The glycol-cooled radiator was fitted in the wing center section, immediately beneath the engine; this was flanked on either side by a single drum-shaped oil cooler. Air for the radiator and oil coolers was drawn in through intakes in both wing-root leading edges and was directed via four ducts to the radiator faces. The air was then exhausted through three controllable hinged flaps near the trailing edge of the center section. Air for the carburetor was drawn in through a raised oval intake immediately aft of the rear canopy.Green and Swanborough 1977, pp. 8‚Äì9.\\"P-39 cooling system (PDF File).\\" zenoswarbirdvideos.com. Retrieved: 12 May 2009. The fuselage structure was unusual and innovative, being based on a strong central keel that incorporated the armament, cockpit, and engine. Two strong fuselage beams to port and starboard formed the basis of the structure. These angled upwards fore and aft to create mounting points for the T9 cannon and propeller reduction gearbox and for the engine and accessories respectively. A strong arched bulkhead provided the main structural attachment point for the main spar of the wing. This arch incorporated a fireproof panel and an armor plate between the engine and the cockpit. It also incorporated a turnover pylon and a pane of bullet-resistant glass behind the pilot's head. The arch also formed the basis of the cockpit housing; the pilot's seat was attached to the forward face as was the cockpit floor. Forward of the cockpit the fuselage nose was formed from large removable covers. A long nose wheel well was incorporated in the lower nose section. The engine and accessories were attached to the rear of the arch and the main structural beams; these too were covered using large removable panels. A conventional semi-monocoque rear fuselage was attached aft of the main structure. The weapons bay of the P-39. Because the pilot was above the extension shaft, he was placed higher in the fuselage than in most contemporary fighters, which, in turn gave the pilot a good field of view. Access to the cockpit was by way of sideways opening \\"car doors\\", one on either side. Both had wind-down windows. As only the right-hand door had a handle both inside and outside this was used as the normal means of access and egress. The left-hand door could be opened only from the outside and was for emergency use, although both doors could be jettisoned. In operational use, as the roof was fixed, the cockpit design made escape difficult in an emergency.Johnson and Heffernan 1982, p. 90. The complete armament fit consisted of the T9 cannon with a pair of Browning M2 .50 caliber (12.7 mm) machine guns mounted in the nose. This changed to two and two guns in the XP-39B (P-39C, Model 13, the first 20 delivered) and two and four (all four in the wings) in the P-39D (Model 15), which also introduced self-sealing tanks and shackles (and piping) for a bomb or drop tank. Because of the unconventional layout, there was no space in the fuselage to place a fuel tank. Although drop tanks were implemented to extend its range, the standard fuel load was carried in the wings, with the result that the P-39 was limited to short-range tactical strikes.Dean 1997, pp. 191‚Äì192. A heavy structure, and around of armor were characteristic of this aircraft as well. The production P-39's heavier weight combined with the Allison engine with only a single- stage, single-speed supercharger, limited the high-altitude capabilities of the fighter. The P-39's altitude performance was markedly inferior to the contemporary European fighters and, as a result, the first USAAF fighter units in the European Theater were equipped with the Spitfire V. However, the P-39D's roll rate was 75¬∞/s at ‚Äì better than the A6M2, F4F, F6F, or P-38 up to (see NACA chart).Dean 1997, pp. 192, 602. Above the supercharger's critical altitude of about , an early P-39's performance dropped off rapidly. This limited its usefulness in traditional fighter missions in Europe as well as in the Pacific, where it was not uncommon for Japanese bombers to attack at altitudes above the P-39's operational ceiling (which in the tropical hot air was lower than in moderate climates). The late production N and Q models, 75% of all Airacobras, could maintain a top speed of approximately up to . The weight distribution of the P-39 was supposedly the reason for its tendency to enter a dangerous flat spin, a characteristic Soviet test pilots were able to demonstrate to the skeptical manufacturer who had been unable to reproduce the effect. After extensive tests, it was determined the spin could only be induced if the aircraft was improperly loaded, with no ammunition in the front compartment. The flight manual noted a need to ballast the front ammunition compartment with the appropriate weight of shell casings to achieve a reasonable center of gravity. High-speed controls were light, consequently high-speed turns and pull-outs were possible. The P-39 had to be held in a dive since it tended to level out, reminiscent of the Spitfire. The recommended never-exceed dive speed limit (Vne) was for the P-39.Dean 1997, p. 200. Soon after entering service, pilots began to report that \\"during flights of the P-39 in certain maneuvers, it tumbled end over end.\\" Most of these events happened after the aircraft was stalled in a nose high attitude with considerable power applied. Concerned, Bell initiated a test program. Bell pilots made 86 separate efforts to reproduce the reported tumbling characteristics. In no case were they able to tumble the aircraft. In his autobiography veteran test and airshow pilot R.A. \\"Bob\\" Hoover provides an account of tumbling a P-39. He goes on to say that in hindsight, he was actually performing a Lomcovak, a now-common airshow maneuver, which he was also able to do in a Curtiss P-40.Hoover and Shaw 1996, pp. 25‚Äì26. An informal study of the P-39's spinning characteristics was conducted in the NASA Langley Research Center 20-foot Free-Spinning Tunnel during the 1970s. A study of old reports showed that during earlier spin testing in the facility, the aircraft had never tumbled. However, it was noted that all testing had been done with a simulated full ammunition load, which drew the aircraft's center of gravity forward. After finding the original spin test model of the P-39 in storage, the new study first replicated the earlier testing, with consistent results. Then, the model was re-ballasted to simulate a condition of no ammunition load, which moved the aircraft's center of gravity aft. Under these conditions, the model was found to often tumble when thrown into the tunnel.Lednicer 2000, p. 7. The rear-mounted engine was less likely to be hit when attacking ground targets, but was vulnerable to attacks from above and behind. At its upper altitude limits, the Airacobra was out-performed by many enemy aircraft.Dean 1997, pp. 206‚Äì207. Bell P-39 Airacobra firing all weapons at night.  Service and versions  In September 1940, Britain ordered 386 P-39Ds (Model 14), with a 20 mm (.79 in) Hispano-Suiza HS.404 and six .303 in (7.7 mm), instead of a 37 mm (1.46 in) cannon and six 0.30 in (7.62 mm) guns. The RAF eventually ordered a total of 675 P-39s. However, after the first Airacobras arrived at 601 Squadron RAF in September 1941, they were promptly recognized as having an inadequate rate of climb and performance at altitude for Western European conditions. Only 80 were adopted, all of them with 601 Squadron. Britain transferred about 200 P-39s to the Soviet Union. Another 200 examples intended for the RAF were taken up by the USAAF after the attack on Pearl Harbor as the P-400, and were sent to the Fifth Air Force in Australia, for service in the South West Pacific Theatre.Dean 1997, p. 194. By the time of the Pearl Harbor attack, nearly 600 P-39s had been built. When P-39 production ended in August 1944, Bell had built 9,558 Airacobras, of which 4,773 (mostly ‚àí39N and ‚àí39Q) were sent to the Soviet Union through the Lend- Lease program. There were numerous minor variations in engine, propeller, and armament, but no major structural changes in production types, excepting a few two-seat TP-39F and RP-39Q trainers.Donald 1997, p. 107. In addition, seven went to the U.S. Navy as radio-controlled drones. Trials of a laminar flow wing (in the XP-39E) and Continental IV-1430 engine (the P-76) were unsuccessful. The mid-engine, gun-through-hub concept was developed further in the Bell P-63 Kingcobra. A naval version with tailwheel landing gear, the XFL-1 Airabonita, was ordered as a competitor to the Vought F4U Corsair and Grumman XF5F Skyrocket. It first flew 13 May 1940, but after a troublesome and protracted development and testing period, it was rejected. Bell P-39Q Operational history The Airacobra saw combat throughout the world, particularly in the Southwest Pacific, Mediterranean and Soviet theaters. Because its engine was equipped with only a single-stage, single-speed supercharger, the P-39 performed poorly above altitude. In both western Europe and the Pacific, the Airacobra found itself outclassed as an interceptor and the type was gradually relegated to other duties. It often was used at lower altitudes for such missions as ground strafing. United Kingdom In 1940, the British Direct Purchase Commission in the U.S. was looking for combat aircraft; they ordered 675 of the export version Bell Model 14 as the \\"Caribou\\" on the strength of the company's representations on 13 April 1940. The British armament was two nose-mounted 0.50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns, and four 0.303 in (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns in the wings; the 37 mm gun was replaced by a 20 mm (.79 in) Hispano-Suiza cannon. British expectations had been set by performance figures established by the unarmed and unarmored XP-39 prototype. The British production contract stated that a maximum speed of +/- 4% was required at rated altitude.Matthews 1996, p. 120. In acceptance testing, actual production aircraft were found to be capable of only 371 mph at 14,090 ft. To enable the aircraft to make the guarantee speed, a variety of drag-reduction modifications were developed by Bell. The areas of the elevator and rudder were reduced by 14.2% and 25.2% respectively. Modified fillets were installed in the tail area. The canopy glass was faired to its frame with putty. The gun access doors on the wing had been seen to bulge in flight, so they were replaced with thicker aluminum sheet. Similarly, the landing gear doors deflected open by as much as two inches at maximum speed, so a stronger linkage was installed to hold them flush. The cooling air exit from the oil and coolant radiators was reduced in area to match the exit velocity to the local flow. New engine exhaust stacks, deflected to match the local flow and with nozzles to increase thrust augmentation, were installed. The machine gun ports were faired over, the antenna mast was removed, a single-piece engine cowling was installed and an exhaust stack fairing was added. Airacobra I AH589 L of 601 Squadron. The long-barrelled 20mm Hispano is clearly shown, as are the .303 wing guns. The airframe was painted with 20 coats of primer, with extensive sanding between coats. Standard camouflage was applied and sanded to remove the edges between the colors. Additionally, about of weight was removed, making it lighter than normal (7,466 lb gross).Matthews 1996, pp. 119‚Äì120. After these modifications, the second production aircraft (serial AH 571) reached a speed of at in flight test. As this speed was within 1% of the guarantee, the aircraft was declared to have satisfied contractual obligations. Despite the success of these modifications, none were applied to other production P-39s. Later testing of a standard production P-400 by the British Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE;) revealed a top speed of only .\\"The Calamitous ‚ÄòCobra'.\\" Air Enthusiast, Vol. 1, No. 3, August 1971. The British export models were renamed \\"Airacobra\\" in 1941. A further 150 were specified for delivery under Lend-lease in 1941 but these were not supplied. The Royal Air Force (RAF) took delivery in mid-1941 and found that performance of the non-turbo-supercharged production aircraft differed markedly from what they were expecting.Mason 1969, pp. 5‚Äì6. In some areas, the Airacobra was inferior to existing aircraft such as the Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire and its performance at altitude suffered drastically. Tests by the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Boscombe Down showed the Airacobra reached at 13,000 ft (3,962 m).Johnson and Heffernan 1982, p. 93. The cockpit layout was criticized, and it was noted that the pilot would have difficulty in bailing out in an emergency because the cockpit roof could not be jettisoned. The lack of a clear vision panel on the windscreen assembly meant that in the event of heavy rain the pilot's forward view would be completely obliterated; the pilot's notes advised that in this case the door windows would have to be lowered and the speed reduced to Johnson and Heffernan 1982, pp. 91‚Äì92. On the other hand, it was considered effective for low level fighter and ground attack work. Problems with gun- and exhaust-flash suppression and the compass could be fixed. No. 601 Squadron RAF was the only British unit to use the Airacobra operationally, receiving their first two examples on 6 August 1941. On 9 October, four Airacobras attacked enemy barges near Dunkirk, in the type's only operational action with the RAF. The squadron continued to train with the Airacobra during the winter, but a combination of poor serviceability and deep distrust of this unfamiliar fighter resulted in the RAF rejecting the type after one combat mission. In March 1942, the unit re-equipped with Spitfires. The Airacobras already in the UK, along with the remainder of the first batch being built in the US, were sent to the Soviet Air force, the sole exception being AH574, which was passed to the Royal Navy and used for experimental work, including the first carrier landing by a tricycle undercarriage aircraft on 4 April 1945 on ,Brown 2006, p. 93. until it was scrapped on the recommendation of a visiting Bell test pilot in March 1946.Brown 2006, p. 145.

Though outclassed by Japanese fighter aircraft, it performed well in strafing and bombing runs, often proving deadly in ground attacks on Japanese forces trying to retake Henderson Field. Guns salvaged from P-39s were sometimes fitted to Navy PT boats to increase firepower. Pacific pilots often complained about problems of performance and unreliable armament, but by the end of 1942, the P-39 units of the Fifth Air Force had claimed about 80 Japanese aircraft, with a similar number of P-39s lost. Fifth and Thirteenth Air Force P-39s did not score more aerial victories in the Solomons due to the aircraft's limited range and poor high altitude performance. Airacobras first fought Japanese Zeros on 30 April 1942 in a low level action near Lae, New Guinea. From May to August 1942 combat between Airacobras and Zeros took place on a regular basis over New Guinea. Compilation of combat reports indicates the Zero was either equal to or close to the P-39 in speed at the altitudes of the various low level encounters. From September to November 1942 pilots of the 57th Fighter Squadron flew P-39s and P-38s from an airfield built on land bulldozed into Kuluk Bay on the barren island of Adak in Alaska's Aleutian Islands. They attacked the Japanese forces that had invaded Attu and Kiska islands in the Aleutians in June 1942. The factor that claimed the most lives was not the Japanese but the weather. The low clouds, heavy mist and fog, driving rain, snow, and high winds made flying dangerous and lives miserable. The 57th remained in Alaska until November 1942, then returned to the United States.

Bill Fiedler was the only American pilot to become an ace in a P-39, many later U.S. aces scored one or two of their victories in the type. The Airacobra's low-altitude performance was good and its firepower was impressive; regardless, it soon became a joke in the Pacific Theatre that a P-400 was a P-40 with a Zero on its tail.Pejƒçoch 2008, p. 86. =Mediterranean= In North Africa, the 99th Fighter Squadron (also known as the Tuskegee Airmen) transitioned quickly from the P-40 and were assigned P-39s in February 1944, but only flew the type for a few weeks.

Soviet Union Soviet P-39Q formerly 44-2664 on display at the Aviation Museum of Central Finland The most successful and numerous use of the P-39 was by the Red Air Force (–í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ-–≤–æ–∑–¥—É—à–Ω—ã–µ —Å–∏–ª—ã, Voenno-Vozdushnye Sily, VVS). They received the considerably improved N and Q models via the Alaska- Siberia ferry route. The tactical environment of the Eastern Front did not demand the high-altitude performance the RAF and AAF did. The comparatively low-speed, low-altitude nature of most air combat on the Eastern Front suited the P-39's strengths: sturdy construction, reliable radio gear, and adequate firepower. Soviet pilots appreciated the cannon-armed P-39 primarily for its air-to-air capability. A common Western misconception is that the Bell fighters were used as ground attack aircraft. This is because the Soviet term for the mission of the P-39, prikrytiye sukhoputnykh voysk (coverage of ground forces) is commonly translated ground support, which is often taken to mean close air support. In Soviet usage, it has a broader meaning. Soviet-operated P-39s did make strafing attacks, but it was \\"never a primary mission or strong suit for this aircraft\\".Colonel Dmitriy Loza, Red Army. Loza and Gebhardt 2002, pp. 15‚Äì16. The Soviets developed successful group aerial fighting tactics for the Bell fighters and scored a surprising number of aerial victories over a variety of German aircraft. Soviet P-39s had no trouble dispatching Junkers Ju 87 Stukas or German twin-engine bombers and matched, and in some areas surpassed, early and mid-war Messerschmitt Bf 109s. The usual nickname for the Airacobra in the VVS was Kobrushka (\\"little cobra\\") or Kobrastochka, a blend of Kobra and Lastochka (swallow), \\"dear little cobra\\".Loza and Gebhardt 2002Mitchell 1992, p. 34. The first Soviet Cobras had a 20 mm Hispano-Suiza cannon and two heavy Browning machine guns, synchronized and mounted in the nose. Later, Cobras arrived with the M4 37 mm cannon and four machine guns, two synchronized and two wing-mounted. \\"We immediately removed the wing machine guns, leaving one cannon and two machine guns,\\" Golodnikov recalled later. That modification improved roll rate by reducing rotational inertia. Soviet airmen appreciated the M4 cannon with its powerful rounds and the reliable action but complained about the low rate of fire (three rounds per second) and inadequate ammunition storage (only 30 rounds). The Soviets used the Airacobra primarily for air-to-air combatGebhardt, Major James F., USAF (Retired). \\"Some Additional P-39 History.\\" March Field Air Museum.

During the battle of Kuban River, VVS relied on P-39s much more than Spitfires and P-40s. Aleksandr Pokryshkin, from 16.Gv.IAP (16th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment), claimed 20 victories in that campaign in a P-39.Morgan 1999, p. 20.

Also, the last Soviet air victory was in a P-39 on May 9 when Kapitan Vasily Pshenichikov scored against a Focke-Wulf Fw 189, in the sky over Prague. Five of the 10 highest scoring Soviet aces logged the majority of their kills in P-39s. Grigoriy Rechkalov scored 44 victories in Airacobras. Pokryshkin scored 47 of his 59 victories in P-39s, making him the highest scoring P-39 fighter pilot of any nation, and the highest scoring Allied fighter pilot using an American fighter.

During mid-1942, USAAF P-39 units in Australia and New Guinea began to receive brand new P-39Ds. Consequently, P-39s that had been repaired in Australian workshops were loaned by 5 AF to the RAAF. In July, seven P-39Fs arrived at 24 Squadron, in RAAF Bankstown in Sydney. In August, seven P-39Ds were received by No. 23 Squadron RAAF at Lowood Airfield, near Brisbane. Both squadrons also operated other types, such as the CAC Wirraway armed trainer. Neither squadron received a full complement of Airacobras or saw combat with them. From early 1943, the air defence role was filled by a wing of Spitfires. Both 23 and 24 Squadron converted to the Vultee Vengeance dive bomber in mid-1943, their P-39s transferred to two newly formed fighter squadrons: No. 82 (augmenting P-40s, still in short supply) at Bankstown and No. 83 (as it awaited the Australian- designed CAC Boomerang) in Strathpine, near Brisbane. After serving with these squadrons for a few months, the remaining Airacobras were returned to the USAAF and the RAAF ceased to operate the type. France In 1940, France ordered P-39s from Bell, but because of the armistice with Germany they were not delivered. After Operation Torch, French forces in North Africa sided with the Allies, and were re-equipped with Allied equipment including P-39Ns. From mid-1943 on, three fighter squadrons, the GC 3/6 Roussillon, GC 1/4 Navarre and GC 1/5 Champagne, flew these P-39s in combat over the Mediterranean, Italy and Southern France. A batch of P-39Qs was delivered later, but Airacobras, which were never popular with French pilots, had been replaced by P-47s in front line units by late 1944. Italy A Bell P-39N-1 Airacobra (USAAF serial 42-9377) which was supplied by the U.S. Army Air Force to the Italian Regia Aeronautica's (Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force) 4th Stormo in the summer of 1944. In June 1944, the Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force (ICAF) received 170 P-39s, most of them -Qs, and a few -Ns (15th USAAF surplus aircraft stored in Napoli-Capodichino airfield) and also at least one -L and five -Ms. The P-39 N (without the underwing fairings for 12.7 mm machine guns) had engines with about 200 hours; a little newer than the P-39Q engines with 30‚Äì150 hours. A total of 149 P-39s would be used: the P-39N for training, while newer Qs were used in the front line. In June‚ÄìJuly 1944, Gruppi 12¬∞, 9¬∞ and 10¬∞ of 4¬∞ Stormo, moved to Campo Vesuvio airstrip to re-equip with the P-39s. The site was not suitable and, in three months of training, 11 accidents occurred, due to engine failures and poor maintenance of the base. Three pilots died and two were seriously injured. One of the victims, on 25 August 1944, was the \\"ace of aces\\", Sergente Maggiore Teresio Vittorio Martinoli.\\"Dimensione Cielo aerei Italiani nella Seconda Guerra Mondiale.\\" Caccia Assalto3. Roma: Edizioni Bizzarri, 1972, pp. 75‚Äì76. The three groups of 4¬∞ Stormo were first sent to Leverano (Lecce) airstrip, then in mid-October, to Galatina airfield. At the end of the training, eight more accidents occurred. Almost 70 aircraft were operational, and on 18 September 1944, 12¬∞ Group's P-39s flew their first mission over Albania. Concentrating on ground attack, the Italian P-39s proved to be suitable in this role, losing 10 aircraft between 4 November and 3 December 1944,Dimensione Cielo 1972, p. 77. to German flak. In February‚ÄìMarch 1945, 10¬∞ and 9¬∞ Gruppi moved North of Galatina, in Canne airbase, near Campobasso, while Allied allowed Italian pilots to use the airstrip of Lissa island, in the Adriatic sea, as an intermediate scale during the long sorties on the Balkans. The 4¬∞ Stormo pilots flew many effective ground attack missions on northern Yugoslavia, losing only one more P-39, for engine failure in Sarajevo area, on 2 April 1945.Dimensione Cielo 1972, p. 78. The Italian P-39 flew over 3,000 hours of combat.Gueli 2004 By the end of the war, 89 P-39s were still at the Canne airport and 13 at the Scuola Addestramento Bombardamento e Caccia (\\"Training School for Bombers and Fighters\\") at Frosinone airfield. In 10 months of operational service, the 4¬∞ Stormo had been awarded three Medaglia d'Oro al Valore Militare \\"alla memoria\\".\\"Dimensione Cielo aerei Italiani nella Seconda Guerra Mondiale.\\" Caccia Assalto3. Roma: Edizioni Bizzarri, 1972, p. 78. After the war the P-39s were taken over by the Aeronautica Militare Italiana (the new Italian air force) and used for several years as training aircraft. In Galatina fighter training unit (Scuola Caccia), war veteran Tenente colonnello Francis Leoncini was killed during a flying accident, on 10 May 1950. Portugal Between December 1942 and February 1943, the Aeron√°utica Militar (Army Military Aviation) obtained aircraft operated by the 81st and the 350th Fighter Groups originally dispatched to North Africa as part of Operation Torch. Due to several problems en route, some of the aircraft were forced to land in Portugal and Spain. Of the 19 fighter aircraft that landed in Portugal, all were interned and entered service that year with the Portuguese Army Military Aviation. They formed the Squadron OK, based at Ota Air Base.\\"The P-400 / P-39L Airacobra.\\" Portuguese Airacobra service history. Retrieved: 16 October 2009. Though unnecessary, the Portuguese Government paid the United States US$20,000 for each of these interned aircraft as well as for one interned Lockheed P-38 Lightning.Public Record Office entry of 18 March 1943, quoted by \\"Wreckovery\\" in Aviation News, 10‚Äì23 August 1984. The U.S. accepted the payment, and gave as a gift four additional crates of aircraft, two of which were not badly damaged, without supplying spares, flight manuals or service manuals. Without proper training, incorporation of the aircraft into service was plagued with problems, and the last six Portuguese Airacobras that remained in 1950 were sold for scrap. Postwar A very small number of late-production P-39Qs survived long enough in the USAAF inventory to be acquired by the United States Air Force upon its separation from the Army. These aircraft served in training and testing roles for approximately a year. They were redesignated as ZF-39Qs (\\"ZF\\" for \\"Obsolete Fighter\\") in June 1948 as part of the new aircraft designation scheme throughout the USAF. In 1945, Italy purchased the 46 surviving P-39s at 1% of their cost but in summer 1946 many accidents occurred, including fatal ones. By 1947, 4¬∞ Stormo re-equipped with P-38s, with P-39s sent to training units until the type's retirement in 1951. Only a T9 cannon survives today at Vigna di Valle Museum. Racing Mira Slovak's P-39Q \\"Mr. Mennen\\" The Airacobra was raced at the National Air Races in the United States after World War II. Famous versions used for racing included the twin aircraft known as \\"Cobra I\\" and \\"Cobra II,\\" owned jointly between three Bell Aircraft test pilots, Chalmers \\"Slick\\" Goodlin, Alvin M. \\"Tex\\" Johnston, and Jack Woolams. These aircraft were extensively modified to use the more powerful P-63 engine and had prototype propeller blades from the Bell factory. \\"Cobra I\\" with its pilot, Jack Woolams, was lost in 1946 during a test flight over Lake Ontario, late in the afternoon, possibly at speeds of up to 400 mph. The aircraft suddenly and inexplicably crashed into the water, breaking apart upon impact. The \\"Cobra II\\" (Race #84) flown by test pilot \\"Tex\\" Johnston, beat racing-modified P-51s, as well as other P-39 racers (which were the favorites), to win the 1946 Thompson Trophy race. Cobra II competed again in the 1947 Thompson Trophy, finishing 3rd. In the 1948 Thompson trophy, she was unable to finish due to engine difficulties. Cobra II did not race again and was destroyed on 10 August 1968 during a test flight prior to an attempt at the world piston-engine air speed record, when owner- pilot Mike Carroll lost control and crashed. Carroll died and the highly modified P-39 was destroyed. Mira Slovak's P-39Q \\"Mr. Mennen\\" (Race #21, former USAAC serial no. 44-3908, civil registry NX40A) was a very fast unlimited racer; a late arrival in 1972 kept the racer out of the Reno races, and she was never entered again. Her color scheme was all white with \\"Mennen\\" green and bronze trim. She is now owned and displayed by the Kalamazoo Air Zoo, in the color scheme of P-400 \\"Whistlin' Britches.\\" Variants ;XP-39-BE :Bell Model 11, one prototype 38‚Äì326 first flown 6 April 1938. Powered by an Allison V-1710-17 (E2) engine (1,150 hp/858 kW), the aircraft was fitted with a General Electric B-5 turbosupercharger, creating a two stage supercharging system similar to the P-38 (engine-mounted mechanical supercharger, remote exhaust-driven turbo-supercharger as a second stage for high-altitude).

Based on the preceding Bell P-39 Airacobra, the P-63's design incorporated suggestions from P-39 pilots and was superior to its predecessor in virtually all respects. The P-63 was not accepted for combat use by the United States Army Air Forces. However, it was deployed during World War II by the Soviet Air Force,Angelucci and Matricardi 1978, p. 100. which had also been the most prolific user of the P-39. Design and development=XP-39E While the P-39 had originally been introduced as an interceptor, later in its development it was decided to reduce the cost and complexity of the engine by removing the turbocharger. High-altitude performance suffered dramatically as a result, and Bell proposed an experimental series to test out a variety of solutions. The resulting XP-39E featured two primary changes from the earlier P-39D from which it was developed. One was a redesigned wing. The root airfoil, a NACA 0015 on other models of the P-39, was changed to a NACA 0018, to gain internal volume.Matthews 1996, p.171. The other was a switch to the Continental I-1430 engine, which featured an improved overall design developed from the hyper engine efforts, as well as an improved supercharger. Three prototypes were ordered in April 1941 with serials 41-19501, 41-19502 and 42-7164. The I-1430 was having continued development problems and could not be delivered in time, so it was replaced by an Allison V-1710-47, similar to that powering the P-39. Each prototypes tested different wing and tail configurations: 41-19501 had a rounded vertical tail, but squared-off tailplane tips; 41-19502, a squared-off fin and rudder and large wing fillets; and 42-7164 had all its flight surfaces squared off. The XP-39E proved faster than standard Airacobra, reaching a maximum speed of at during tests. However, the XP-39E was considered inferior to the stock P-39 Airacobra in all other respects, so it was not ordered into production. XP-63 Bell assembly line near Niagara Falls, New York Although the XP-39E proved disappointing, the USAAF was nevertheless interested in an even larger aircraft based on the same basic layout. Even before its first flight, the USAAF placed an order on 27 June 1941 for two prototypes of an enlarged version powered by the same V-1710-47. The new design was given the designation XP-63 and serials were 41-19511 and 41-19512. A third prototype was also ordered, 42-78015, using the Packard V-1650, the U.S.-built version of the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine. The XP-87897 was larger in all dimensions than the Airacobra. The wing was redesigned again, this time with new NACA laminar flow airfoils, 66(215)-116 a=0.6 at the root and a NACA 66(215)-216 a=0.6 at the tip. The wing taper ratio was approximately 2:1, span was , and wing area was .Matthews, 1996, p.182. The engine was fitted with a second remotely mounted supercharger, supplementing the normal single-stage supercharger. At higher altitudes, when additional boost was required, a hydraulic clutch would engage the second supercharger, adding to the service ceiling. A larger four-bladed propeller was also standardized. A persistent complaint against the Airacobra was that its nose armament was not easily accessible for ground maintenance, and in order to cure this problem, the XP-63 airframe was fitted with larger cowling panels. In September 1942, even before the prototype flew, the USAAF ordered it into production as the P-63A (Model 33).Pelletier, Alain J. Bell Aircraft Since 1935 (Annapolis, Maryland: Naval Institute Press, 1992), p.42. The P-63A's armament was to be the same as the current P-39Q, a single M4 cannon firing through the propeller hub, two synchronized .50 caliber (12.7 mm) machine guns in the cowl, and two .50 cal (12.7 mm) machine guns in underwing gondolas. The first prototype, 41-19511, flew for the first time on 7 December 1942. It was destroyed on 28 January 1943 when its landing gear failed to extend. The second prototype, 41-19512, followed on 5 February 1943. It, too, was destroyed, this time due to an engine failure. The Merlin-engined 42-78015 (as Merlins were primarily needed for the P-51 Mustang) was delivered with another Allison instead, a -93, which had a war emergency rating of at sea level, making this prototype one of the fastest Kingcobras built, attaining at . First production P-59A with a P-63 behind. Deliveries of production P-63As began in October 1943. The USAAF concluded the Kingcobra was inferior to the Mustang, and declined to order larger quantities. American allies, particularly the Soviet Union, had a great need for fighter aircraft, however, and the Soviets were already the largest users of the Airacobra. Therefore, the Kingcobra was ordered into production to be delivered under Lend-Lease. In February 1944, the Soviet government sent a highly experienced test pilot, Andrey G. Kochetkov, and an aviation engineer, Fyodor P. Suprun, to the Bell factories to participate in the development of the first production variant, the P-63A. Initially ignored by Bell engineers, Kochetkov's expert testing of the machine's spin characteristics (which led to airframe buckling) eventually led to a significant Soviet role in the development. After flat spin recovery proved impossible, and upon Kochetkov's making a final recommendation that pilots should bail out upon entering such a spin, he received a commendation from the Irving Parachute Company. The Kingcobra's maximum aft CG was moved forward to facilitate recovery from spins.Gordon 2008, pp. 450‚Äì451. P-63A-8, SN 269261, was extensively tested at TsAGI in what was then the world's largest wind tunnel. Soviet input was significant. With the Soviet Union being the largest buyer of the aircraft, Bell was quick to implement their suggestions. The vast majority of the changes in the A sub-variants were a direct result of Soviet input, e.g. increased pilot armor and fuselage hardpoint on the A-5, underwing hardpoints and extra fuel tanks on the A-6, etc. The Soviet Union even experimented with ski landing gear for the P-63A-6, but this never reached production. Most significantly, Soviet input resulted in moving the main cannon forward, favorably changing the center of gravity, and increasing its ammo load from 30 to 58 rounds for the A-9 variant. The P-63 had an impressive roll rate, besting the Americans' P-47, P-40, and P-51‚Äîand the Japanese Navy's Kawanishi N1K2 Shiden-Kai fighter‚Äîwith a rate of 110¬∞ per second at 275 mph (443 km/h).Dean 1997, pp. 410, 602. Swept-wing L-39 L-39 with swept wings, extended rear fuselage, ventral tail fin and P-39 prop Two war surplus P-63Cs were modified by Bell under Navy contract for flight testing of low- speed and stall characteristics of high-speed wing designs. The aircraft received new wings with adjustable leading edge slats, trailing edge flaps and a pronounced sweep of 35 degrees. The wings had no wheel wells; only the nose gear was retractable.Williams, W.G. \\"Testing The First Supersonic Aircraft: Memoirs of NACA Pilot Bob Champine\\". NF166, January 1992.

L-39-1 first flew 23 April 1946, demonstrating a need for extra tail surface and rear fuselage length to balance the aircraft in flight‚Äîthe wing repositioning reduced empennage effectiveness and moved the center of lift aft. A lighter three- bladed propeller from a P-39Q-10 was mounted and the necessary changes to the empennage were made. L-39-2 incorporated these adjustments from the start. L-39-1 later went to NACA at Langley for wind tunnel testing, where much valuable data were gathered.Phillips, William Hewitt. \\"Journey in Aeronautical Research: A Career at NASA Langley Research Center, Problems Encountered as a Result of Wartime Developments\\".

Operational service USAAF P-63A USAF photo  Soviet Union  The first version to be supplied in quantity to the Soviet Union was the P-63A-7 with a higher vertical tail, and reinforced wings and fuselage. The fuselage proved to need strengthening, consequently in October 1944, a reinforcement kit for operational P-63s was developed.Gordon 2008, p. 451. Air Transport Command ferry pilots, including U.S. women pilots of the WASP program, picked up the planes at the Bell factory at Niagara Falls, New York, and flew them to Great Falls, Montana and then onward via the Northwest Staging Route through Canada to Alaska, where Soviet ferry pilots, many of them women, would take delivery of the aircraft at NomeLong and Neganblya 2001, pp. 3, 5. and fly them to the Soviet Union over the Bering Strait via the Alaska-Siberia route (ALSIB). A total of 2,397 (2,672, according to other sources)Gordon 2008, p. 452. such aircraft were delivered to USSR, out of the overall 3,303 production aircraft (72.6%).Hardesty 1991, p. 253. By a 1943 agreement, P-63s were disallowed for Soviet use against Germany and were supposed to be concentrated in the Soviet Far East for an eventual attack on Japan. However, there are many unconfirmed reports from both the Soviet and German side that P-63s did indeed see service against the Luftwaffe. Most notably, one of Pokryshkin's pilots reports in his memoirs published in the 1990s that the entire 4th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment (4 GvIAP) was secretly converted to P-63s in 1944, while officially still flying P-39s. One account states they were in action at K√∂nigsberg, in Poland and in the final assault on Berlin. There are German reports of P-63s shot down by both fighters and flak. Hans Rudel, highest decorated pilot of the Luftwaffe, states in his memoirs, \\"We often encounter American types of aircraft, especially Airacobras, Kingcobras and Bostons.\\" This was in the Courland front towards the end of the war.Hans Ulrich Rudel, \\"Stuka Pilot\\", p. 170 ; Black House Ltd, 2012 Nevertheless, all Soviet records show nothing but P-39s used against Germany. In general, official Soviet histories played down the role of Lend-Lease supplied aircraft in favor of local designs, but it is known that the P-63 was a successful fighter aircraft in Soviet service. A common Western misconception is that the Bell fighters were used as ground attack aircraft. The Soviets developed successful group aerial fighting tactics for the Bell fighters and scored a surprising number of aerial victories over a variety of German aircraft. Low ceilings, short missions, good radios, a sealed and warm cockpit and ruggedness contributed to their effectiveness. To pilots who had once flown the tricky Polikarpov I-16, the aerodynamic quirks of the mid- engined aircraft were unimportant. In the Far East, P-63 and P-39 aircraft were used in the Soviet invasion of Manchukuo and northern Korea. In the Pacific theatre, the Kingcobras flew escort, close air support and ground attack missions. The Soviet P-63s achieved their first air victory on 15 August 1945, when Lejtenant I. F. Miroshnichenko from 17th IAP/190 IAD, shot down a Nakajima Ki-43 Hayabusa IJAAS fighter off the coast of North Korea. Sufficient aircraft continued in use after the war for them to be given the NATO reporting name of Fred. By 9 May 1945, operational units had still 1,148 Kingcobras on strength. On 8 October 1950, two USAF F-80Cs from the 49th Fighter Group breached the USSR's border and attacked Sukhaya Rechka airfield south-west of Vladivostok and from the Soviet-Korean border, making two strafing runs before returning to their home base. Although Soviet sources claim the attack was intentional, the pilots claimed it was a result of a navigational error.Biteman, Duane, B., Lt Col, USAF, Ret. \\"18th Fighter-Bomber Wing in Korea\\". koreanwar.org. Retrieved: 5 September 2009. The airfield belonged to the Air Forces of the Pacific Fleet (VVS TOF), but it was occupied by the 821st Fighter Aviation Regiment (821 IAP) of the 190th Fighter Aviation Division (190 IAD). Mostly aircraft of the 1st Squadron of 821 IAP were hit with 12 P-63s damaged, one P-63 burned to the ground while the other damaged aircraft were able to be repaired. No human losses were suffered.\\"Soviet interview on P-80 attack\\". airforce.ru. Retrieved: 17 July 2011. France In 1945, 114 later models were delivered to the French Air Force (Arm√©e de l'Air), but they arrived too late to see service in World War II. They however saw service during the First Indochina War before being replaced in 1951. Initially the French Kingcobras were deployed to Algeria. Fighter squadron (Groupe de Chasse) 2/6 \\"Travail\\", previously equipped with P-39 Airacobras, received their Kingcobras on 18 July at Casablanca; the pilots were surprised by the higher landing speed of their new aircraft.Petit, p. 4 The Kingcobra were scrambled to Indochina when the insurgency broke. Only 60 Kingcobras were operational in Indochina in January 1950, mainly because the Americans refused to supply spare parts.Petit, p. 9 Starting in February 1951, the squadrons equipped with Kingcobra started to receive Grumman F8F Bearcats as replacements. Most Kingcobras were mothballed by July. The last flight of a Kingcobra in Indochina took place on 6 September 1951.Petit, p. 21 \\"Pinball\\" operations Its main use in American service was the unusual one of a manned flying target for gunnery practice.Dunaway, James. \\"Just Shoot Me\\". Air & Space/Smithsonian, Volume 25, Issue 5, October/November 2010. Retrieved: 17 July 2011. The aircraft was generally painted bright orange to increase its visibility. All armament and the regular armor was removed from these RP-63 aircraft, and over a ton of armored sheet metal was applied to the aircraft. This was fitted with sensors that would detect hits, and these hits were signaled by illuminating a light in the propeller hub where the cannon would have been. This earned the aircraft the unofficial nickname of Pinball. Special frangible rounds made of a lead/Bakelite combination were developed that would disintegrate upon impact. These were known as the \\"Cartridge, Caliber .30, Frangible, Ball, M22\\". In 1990, veteran Pinball pilot, Ivan L. Hickman, wrote Operation Pinball about the training flights. Operation Pinball/the USAAF's Secret Aerial Gunnery Program of WWII, Motorbooks Intl, 1990 RAE Testing British engineers, like the Americans, had a growing interest during World War II in the application of laminar flow airfoils. In an effort to learn more about the practical application of laminar flow airfoils, in 1945 the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) undertook a flight test program with one of the two P-63As that the United Kingdom had received.Smith and Higton 1945. The aircraft was equipped with a wake rake array mounted outboard, behind the wing, to allow the momentum deficit, and thus section drag, to be measured. The RAE first tested it in an \\"as delivered\\" configuration. The wing airfoil was designed to support laminar flow to 60% of chord. In the \\"as delivered\\" configuration, a profile drag was measured which was representative of the wing section with boundary layer transition at the leading edge (0% laminar flow). Reducing the surface roughness reduced the drag at low lift coefficients to a level representative of laminar flow to 35% of chord. Measurements were made of the surface waviness. This showed peak wave amplitudes, above the mean, of approximately 0.011 inches over a two-inch span. The standard waviness criteriaHolmes, Bruce J., Clifford J. Obara and Long P. Yip. \\"NASA TP-2256: Natural Laminar Flow Experiments on Modern Airplane Surfaces.\\" NASA, May 1984. shows the critical wave height to be 0.0053 inches for this application.Lednicer, 2000 p.11. To reduce the waviness, RAE personnel stripped the wing to bare metal. The wing was then sprayed with two coats of primer paint and a coat of paint type filler. After the paint was dry, it was sanded in a chordwise direction, using sanding blocks, whose curvature matched the local surface curvature. This was repeated several times. Surface waviness was then measured and found to be no more than 0.005 inches. In flight, this configuration was found to have a profile drag representative of boundary layer transition at 60% of chord. This gave researchers an idea of what level of wing surface quality was required to actually get the benefits of laminar flow airfoils. Postwar air racers Numerous surplus P-63s ended up on the air racing circuit in the immediate postwar era. Charles Tucker purchased two P-63s from the disposal facility at Kingman, Arizona just after the war. He entered one of them, the Tucker Special as Race 28 with the name Flying Red Horse emblazoned on the nose (civilian register N62995) in the 1946 Thompson Trophy race. He had clipped the wing by in an attempt to improve its speed, reducing the span to . The second one (44-4126 (XN63231 Race 30)) was intended for the 1946 Bendix cross country race. It was initially fitted with two wingtip drop tanks. In 1947, the drop tanks were removed and the wings were clipped to . Bell RP-63C racer Tipsy Miss wearing No. 28 at Oshkosh Wisconsin in 1974. Two other significant racers were flown later. Tipsy Miss, John Sandberg's clipped-wingtip P-63 unlimited racer, was identified as \\"Race 28,\\" and painted in bright orange, white and black race numbers with a chrome spinner. Later sold to a European pilot, this P-63 was destroyed in a fatal accident in 1990Johnsen 1998, p. 67. Crazy Horse Campgrounds was the most radically modified P-63 Kingcobra ever. Larry Haven's \\"Race 90\\" clipped-wing unlimited racer had a tiny bubble canopy installed; it appeared in all silver (unpolished aluminum) finish with a white rudder and black trim.

It is located from the centre of Paris. Name Vitry-sur-Seine was originally called simply Vitry. The name Vitry comes from Medieval Latin Vitriacum, and before that Victoriacum, meaning \\"estate of Victorius\\", a Gallo-Roman landowner. In 1897 the name of the commune officially became Vitry-sur-Seine (meaning \\"Vitry upon Seine\\"), in order to distinguish it from other communes of France also called Vitry. Main sights * Mus√©e d'Art Contemporain du Val-de-Marne Culture For some years, Vitry-sur-Seine operated a cultural policy of bringing art to all. For this reason, the commune contains over 100 contemporary sculptures, notably in establishments of public education (schools, secondary schools and High Schools). Vitry hosts the Mus√©e d'Art Contemporain du Val-de-Marne (Val-de-Marne's Museum of Contemporary Art). Opened on 18 November 2005, this museum offers in addition to the workshops of plastic arts, an auditorium and a cinema for art and experimental film. Vitry is one of the cities that contributed to the development of the Hip hop movement in France. Consequentially, urban art has a very important place in the city Transport Vitry-sur-Seine is served by two stations on Paris RER line C: Vitry-sur-Seine and Les Ardoines. Orly Airport is located near Vitry-sur-Seine. Demographics The city can be separated into three distinct parts: the center containing numerous cit√©s HLM (Housing projects), peripheral neighborhoods belonging to the middle class, and a large industrial area along the Seine river. The bordering towns are Ivry-sur-Seine, Villejuif, Chevilly-Larue, Thiais, Choisy-le-Roi, Alfortville. In 2008 the population of the city was estimated at 82,500 inhabitants. The rate of unemployment is 26.5%, while national average is under 10% Vitry-sur- Seine is the fiftieth most populated city of France and the tenth of √éle-de- France. Immigration As of circa 1998 Ivry-sur-Seine and Vitry had a combined Asian population of 3,600. That year about 250 Asians from those communes worked in the 13th arrondissement of Paris, and the overall demographics of Ivry and Vitry Asians were similar to those in the 13th arrondissement.Guillon, Michelle. \\"The Chinese and Chinese Districts in Paris\\" (Chapter 11).

Design and development The Scorpion stemmed from a United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Air Technical Service Command specification (\\"Military Characteristics for All-Weather Fighting Aircraft\\") for a night fighter to replace the P-61 Black Widow. The preliminary specification, sent to aircraft manufacturers on 28 August 1945, required two engines and an armament of six guns, either machine guns or autocannon. The revised specification was issued on 23 November; it did not specify jet propulsion, but the desired maximum speed of virtually dictated that all the submissions would be jet-powered. The aircraft was to be armed with aerial rockets stored internally and six guns split between two flexible mounts, four guns forward and two in the rear. Each mount had to be capable of 15¬∞ of movement from the longitudinal axis of the aircraft. Each mount's guns were to be automatically controlled by radar. For ground attack, it had to be capable of carrying bombs and to be able to carry a minimum of eight rockets externally.Blazer and Dorio 1993, pp. 1‚Äì3. Bell Aircraft, Consolidated-Vultee, Douglas Aircraft, Goodyear, Northrop and Curtiss-Wright all submitted proposals. In March 1946, the USAAF selected the Curtiss-Wright XP-87 Blackhawk, adapted from their proposed XA-43 attack aircraft and the Northrop N-24 design, one of four submitted by the company.Air International July 1988, pp. 44‚Äì45. The N-24, designed by Jack Northrop, was a slim-bodied swept-wing aircraft with a two-man pressurized cockpit and conventional landing gear.Air International July 1988, p. 45. To reduce drag, the two Allison J35 turbojet engines were buried in the lower fuselage, directly behind their air intakes, and they exhausted underneath the rear fuselage. The horizontal stabilizer was mounted just above the junction of the vertical stabilizer with the fuselage and had some dihedral.Isham and McLaren, p. 9. A contract for two aircraft, now designated the XP-89, and a full-scale mock-up was approved on 13 June, although construction of the mock-up had begun immediately after the USAAF announced that the N-24 had been selected. It was inspected on 25 September and the USAAF had some reservations. The inspectors believed that the radar operator needed to be moved forward, closer to the pilot, with both crewmen under a single canopy, the magnesium alloy components of the wing replaced by aluminum alloy, and the fuel tankage directly above the engines moved. Other changes had to be made as wind tunnel and other aerodynamic tests were conducted. The swept wings proved to be less satisfactory at low speeds, and a thin straight wing was selected instead. Delivery of the first prototype was scheduled for November 1947, 14 months after the inspection.Blazer and Dorio 1993, pp. 5‚Äì7, 9. The position of the horizontal stabilizer also proved to be unsatisfactory, as it was affected by the engine exhaust, and it would be \\"blanked-out\\" by airflow from the wing at high angles of attack. It was moved halfway up the tail, but its position flush with the leading edge of the vertical stabilizer proved to cause extra drag through turbulence and reduced the effectiveness of the elevators and rudder. Moving the horizontal stabilizer forward solved the problem.Isham and McLaren, pp. 9‚Äì10. Another major change occurred when USAAF revised its specification to delete the rear gun installation on 8 October. Another inspection of the mock-up was held on 17 December, and the inspectors suggested only minor changes, even though the fuselage fuel tanks were still above the engines. Northrop's efforts to protect the fuel tanks were considered sufficient, as the only alternative was to redesign the entire aircraft.Blazer and Dorio 1993, pp. 6‚Äì8. The XP-89 had a thin, straight, mid-mounted wing and a crew of two, seated in tandem. The slim rear fuselage and the high-mounted horizontal stabilizer led Northrop employees calling it the Scorpion‚Äîa name later formally adopted by the Air Force. The intended armament of four 20-millimeter M-24 cannon in a small nose turret was not ready when the XP-89 was completed in 1948.Davis and Menard 1990, p. 5. Pending the availability of either of the two turrets under development, an interim six-gun fixed installation, with 200 rounds per gun, was designed for the underside of the nose. The thin wing had an aspect ratio of 5.88, a thickness-to-chord ratio of 9% and used a NACA 0009-64 section, which was selected for its low drag at high speed and stability at low speeds. A further advantage of the straight wing was that it could accommodate heavy weights at the wingtips.Air International July 1988, pp. 45‚Äì46. The wing could not fit the circular-type ailerons used in the P-61, so Northrop used the \\"decelerons\\" designed for the unsuccessful XP-79 prototype. These were clamshell-style split ailerons, which could be used as conventional ailerons, as dive brakes, or function as flaps as needed.Davis and Menard 1990, p. 4. All flying surfaces, the flaps and the landing gear were hydraulically powered. The thin wing dictated tall, thin, high-pressure () mainwheel tires, while the low height of the fuselage required the use of dual wheels for the nose gear. The terms of the initial contract were revised and formalized on 21 May 1947 with the price increased to $5,571,111. The delivery date of the first aircraft was scheduled 14 months (July 1948) from signing and the second 2 months after that. A month before the prototype made its first flight on 16 August 1948 at Muroc Army Air Field, the USAF changed its designation for fighter aircraft from \\"P\\" to \\"F\\".Blazer and Dorio 1993, pp. 9‚Äì10. The XF-89 was fitted with Allison J35-A-9 turbojets and proved to be seriously underpowered. Initial flights were made with conventional ailerons, decelerons not being installed until December.Air International July 1988, p. 46. Several months earlier the Air Force conducted a competitive evaluation of the three existing all-weather interceptor prototypes, the XF-87, the XF-89, and the US Navy's XF3D. The evaluators were qualified night-fighter pilots, radar operators, and experienced maintenance non-commissioned officers. The pilots were not impressed with any of the aircraft and recommended procurement of an interim aircraft that resulted in the development of the Lockheed F-94 Starfire from the training version of the Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star. The F-89 proved to be the fastest of the three contenders,Blazer and Dorio 1993, p. 12. although it was in last place in cockpit arrangement and ease of maintenance. One pilot claimed that the XF-89 was the only real fighter and compared the XF-87 to a medium bomber and the XF3D to a trainer. The full Committee on Evaluation overruled those evaluators, preferring the Northrop design, as it had the greatest potential for development. The Air Force subsequently canceled the production contract for the F-87 to free up money for the Scorpion. By November 1949 the second aircraft was virtually complete, but the Air Force was concerned about the design's poor thrust-to-weight ratio and decided to implement a weight-reduction program, as well as upgrading the engines to the more powerful Allison J33-A-21 fitted with an afterburner. Other major changes included the replacement of the nose gun turret by the Hughes-designed six-gun nose, AN/ARG-33 radar, and Hughes E-1 fire-control system, permanent wing-tip fuel tanks, and the ability to lower the complete engine for better maintenance access. The new nose added to the length of the aircraft. It was redesignated YF-89A to better reflect its role as a pre- production testbed to evaluate equipment and changes planned for the F-89A production aircraft. The aircraft was essentially complete by February 1950.Blazer and Dorio 1993, p. 16. After repairs from a crash landing on 27 June 1949, the XF-89 was flown to March AFB to participate in the RKO movie Jet Pilot in February 1950. Shortly afterward, the aircraft crashed on 22 February, killing the observer, when flutter developed in the elevator and the subsequent vibrations caused the entire tail to break off. Construction of the production models was suspended until the reasons for the accident were discovered. Engineering and wind-tunnel tests revealed that the geometry of the rear fuselage and the engine exhaust created flutter-inducing turbulence that was aggravated by the high-frequency acoustic energy from the exhaust. Fixes for the problem involved the addition of a \\"jet wake fairing\\" at the bottom rear of the fuselage between the engines, external (\\"ice tong\\") mass balances for the elevator, pending the design of internal mass balances,Blazer and Dorio 1993, pp. 15‚Äì16, 19. and the addition of exhaust deflectors to the fuselage to reduce the turbulence and the consequent flutter.Davis and Menard 1990, p. 7. Well before the YF-89A was complete, a $39,011,622 contract was awarded to Northrop on 13 May 1949 for 48 F-89A aircraft, one static test airframe and the modifications made to the YF-89A.Blazer and Dorio 1993, p. 25. Operational history An early F-89A Production was authorized in January 1949,Knaack 1978, p. 85. with the first production F-89A flying in September 1950. It had AN/APG-33 radar and an armament of six 20-millimeter T-31 cannon with 200 rpg. The swiveling nose turret was abandoned, and fuel tanks were permanently fitted to the wingtips. Underwing racks could carry 16 aerial rockets or up to of bombs. Only 18 F-89As were completed, which were mainly used for tests and trials, before the type was upgraded to F-89B standard, with new avionics.Air International July 1988, pp. 47‚Äì48. The type entered service with the 84th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron in June 1951,Knaack 1978, p. 87. experiencing considerable problems with engines and other systems, and soon gave way to the F-89C. Despite repeated engine changes, problems persisted, compounded by the discovery of structural problems with the wings that led to the grounding of the F-89 and forced a refit of 194 -A, -B, and -C models.Knaack 1978, pp. 88‚Äì89. The major production model was the F-89D, which first flew 23 October 1951 and entered service in 1954. It removed the cannon in favor of a new Hughes E-6 fire control system with AN/APG-40 radar and an AN/APA-84 computer. Armament was two pods of fifty-two \\"Mighty Mouse\\" FFAR rockets.Air International August 1988, pp. 88‚Äì89. A total of 682 were built. In August 1956 a pair of F-89D interceptors were scrambled from Oxnard Air Force Base to shoot down a runaway F6F-5K drone leading to the so-called Battle of Palmdale. Proposed re-engined F-89s, designated F-89E and F-89F, were not built, nor was a proposed F-89G that would have used Hughes MA-1 fire control and GAR-1/GAR-2 Falcon air-to-air missiles like the Convair F-106 Delta Dart. F-89H showing its GAR-1/2 Falcon missiles extended from the wingtip pods The subsequent F-89H, which entered service in 1956, had an E-9 fire control system like that of the early F-102 and massive new wingtip pods each holding three Falcons (usually three semi-active radar homing GAR-1s and three infrared GAR-2s) and 21 FFARs, for a total of six missiles and 42 rockets. Problems with the fire-control system delayed the -H's entry into service, by which time its performance was notably inferior to newer supersonic interceptors, so it was phased out of USAF service by 1959. The final variant was the F-89J. This was based on the F-89D, but replaced the standard wingtip missile pod/tanks with fuel tanks and fitted a pylon under each wing for a single MB-1 Genie nuclear rocket (sometimes supplemented by up to four conventional Falcon air-to-air missiles). The F-89J became the only aircraft to fire a live Genie as the John Shot of Operation Plumbbob on 19 July 1957. There were no new-build F-89Js, but 350 -Ds were modified to this standard. They served with the Air Defense Command, later renamed the Aerospace Defense Command (ADC), through 1959 and with ADC-gained units of the Air National Guard through 1969. This version of the aircraft was extensively used within the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) air-defense system.Green and Swanborough 1994, pp. 457‚Äì458.

A military version of the three-engined DC-10 airliner, the KC-10 was developed from the Advanced Tanker Cargo Aircraft Program. It incorporates military-specific equipment for its primary roles of transport and aerial refueling. It was developed to supplement the KC-135 Stratotanker following experiences in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. The KC-10 was the second McDonnell Douglas transport aircraft to be selected by the Air Force following the C-9. A total of 60 KC-10s were produced for the USAF. The Royal Netherlands Air Force operates two similar tankers designated KDC-10 that were converted from DC-10s. The KC-10 plays a key role in the mobilization of US military assets, taking part in overseas operations far from home. These aircraft performed airlift and aerial refueling during the 1986 bombing of Libya (Operation Eldorado Canyon), the 1990‚Äì91 Gulf War with Iraq (Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm), the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia (Operation Allied Force), War in Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom), and Iraq War (Operations Iraqi Freedom and New Dawn). The KC-10 is expected to serve until 2043. Design and development=Advanced Tanker Cargo Aircraft Program During the Vietnam War, doubts began to form regarding the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker fleet's ability to meet the needs of the United States' global commitments. The aerial refueling fleet was deployed to Southeast Asia to support tactical aircraft and strategic bombers, while maintaining the U.S.-based support of the nuclear-bomber fleet. Consequently, the Air Force sought an aerial tanker with greater capabilities than the KC-135. In 1972, two DC-10s were flown in trials at Edwards Air Force Base, simulating air refuelings to check for possible wake issues. Boeing performed similar tests with a 747.Waddington 2000, pp. 116‚Äì120. During the 1973 Yom Kippur War, the Air Force commenced Operation Nickel Grass to supply Israel with weapons and supplies. The operation demonstrated the necessity for adequate air-refueling capabilities; denied landing rights in Europe, C-5 Galaxy transports were forced to carry a fraction of their maximum payload on direct flights from the continental United States to Israel.Endres 1998, p. 65.Steffan 1998, p. 103. To address this shortfall in mobility, in 1975, under the Advanced Tanker Cargo Aircraft Program, four aircraft were evaluated‚Äîthe Lockheed C-5, the Boeing 747, the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, and the Lockheed L-1011.Frawley 2002, p. 119. The only serious contenders were Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. On 19 December 1977, McDonnell Douglas's DC-10 was chosen. The primary reason of this choice was the KC-10's ability to operate from shorter runways. Initially, a batch of 12 aircraft was ordered, but this was later increased to 60. KC-10 Extender The KC-10 Extender first flew on 12 July 1980, but it was not until October the same year that the first aerial refuel sortie was performed.Steffan 1998, p. 104. The design for the KC-10 involved modifications from the DC-10-30CF design. Unnecessary airline features were replaced by an improved cargo-handling system and military avionics.Eden 2004, p 286. Meanwhile, the KC-10 retains 88% commonality with its commercial counterparts, giving it greater access to the worldwide commercial support system. Other changes from the DC-10-30CF include the removal of most windows and lower cargo doors. Early aircraft featured a distinctive light gray, white and blue paint scheme, but a gray-green camouflage scheme was used on later tankers. The paint scheme was switched to a medium gray color by the late 1990s.Steffen 1998, pp. 103‚Äì107. alt=A jet aircraft refuels from a gray three-engine tanker via a long boom located under the tanker's aft fuselage. The most notable changes were the addition of the McDonnell Douglas Advanced Aerial Refueling Boom (AARB) and additional fuel tanks located in the baggage compartments below the main deck. The extra tanks increase the KC-10's fuel capacity to 356,000 lb (161,478 kg), nearly doubling the KC-135's capacity. The KC-10 has both a centerline refueling boom‚Äîunique in that it sports a control surface system at its aft end that differs from the V-tail design used on previous tankers‚Äîand a drogue-and-hose system on the starboard side of the rear fuselage. The KC-10 boom operator is located in the rear of the aircraft with a wide window for monitoring refueling. The operator controls refueling operations through a digital fly-by wire system.Eden 2004, p 287. Unlike the KC-135, the KC-10's hose-and-drogue system allows refueling of Navy, Marine Corps, and most allied aircraft, all in one mission. The final twenty KC-10s produced included wing-mounted pods for added refueling locations. The KC-10 can also carry a complement of 75 personnel with 146,000 lb (66,225 kg) of cargo, or 170,000 lb (77,110 kg) in an all-cargo configuration. The KC-10 has a side cargo door for loading and unloading cargo. Handling equipment is required to raise and lower loads to the cargo opening. It can carry cargo and serve as a tanker on overseas missions. Further developments A USAF KC-10 Extender after being refueled by another KC-10 A need for new transport aircraft for the Royal Netherlands Air Force (Koninklijke Luchtmacht) was first identified in 1984. The 1991 Gulf War highlighted the deficiencies in mobility of European forces.Steffen 1997, p. 107. In 1991 four categories of transport requirements were established. Category A required a large cargo aircraft with a range of at least 4,500 km and the capability to refuel F-16s. In 1992, two DC-10-30CFs were acquired from Martinair in a buy/leaseback contract. When one of the two aircraft was lost in the Martinair Flight 495 crash, a third aircraft was bought from Martinair. The conversion was handled via the United States foreign military sales program, which in turn contracted McDonnell Douglas. Costs for the conversion were initially estimated at $89.5 million (FY 1994). The aircraft were to be equipped with both a boom and a probe and drogue system. However, because McDonnell Douglas did not have any experience with the requested Remote Aerial Refueling Operator (RARO) system, and because the third aircraft differed from the original two, the program could not be completed at budget. By omitting the probe and drogue system and a fixed partition wall between the cargo and passenger, the cost could be limited at $96 million. To make up for the cost increase McDonnell Douglas hired Dutch companies to do part of the work. The actual converting of the aircraft was done by KLM. Conversion of the aircraft was done from October 1994 to September 1995 for the first aircraft and from February to December 1995 for the second. This was much longer than planned, mostly because McDonnell Douglas delivered the parts late. This would have again increased the cost, but in the contract for the AH-64 Apaches which the Royal Netherlands Air Force also bought from McDonnell Douglas, the price was agreed to be kept at $96 million. To modernize the KC-10, the USAF has awarded a contract to Boeing in 2010 to upgrade the fleet of 59 aircraft with new Communication, navigation and surveillance and air traffic management (CNS/ATM) system. This was to allow the aircraft to fly in civil airspace as new ICAO and FAA standards took effect in 2015. Rockwell Collins was also awarded a contract in 2011 for avionics and systems integration for the cockpit modernization program. Operational history=United States The first KC-10 was delivered to the Air Force's Strategic Air Command (SAC) in March 1981 at Barksdale AFB. In 1982 a newly renamed 22nd Air Refueling Wing (formerly the 22nd Bombardment Wing) was re-equipped with KC-10A Extenders and became the 2nd Air Force Unit to operate the new tankers. The 60th and final KC-10 was delivered on 29 November 1988.Steffen 1998, pp. 104, 107. The KC-10s served with SAC until 1992, when they were reassigned to the newly established Air Mobility Command. In the aerial refueling role, the KC-10s have been operated largely in the strategic refueling of large number of tactical aircraft on ferry flights and the refueling of other strategic transport aircraft. Conversely, the KC-135 fleet has operated largely in the in-theater tactical role. There are 59 KC-10 Extenders in service with the USAF as of 2010. The USAF's KC-10s are stationed primarily at Travis AFB, California, and McGuire AFB, now part of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, in New Jersey. A USN F-14D and two F/A-18Cs prepare to refuel from a KC-10 in 2005 over the Persian Gulf. When faced with refusals of basing and overflight rights from continental European countries during Operation El Dorado Canyon, the U.S. was forced to use the UK-based F-111s in the 1986 air-strikes against Libya. The KC-10s and KC-135s allowed 29 F-111s, along with other Air Force and Navy aircraft, to reach their targets. The KC-10 again played a key role during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm in 1991; KC-10s facilitated the deployment of tactical, strategic, and transport aircraft to Saudi Arabia. In the early stages of Operation Desert Shield, aerial refueling was key to the rapid airlift of materiel and forces. In addition to refueling airlift aircraft, the KC-10, along with the smaller KC-135, moved thousands of tons of cargo and thousands of troops in support of the massive buildup. The KC-10 and the KC-135 conducted about 51,700 separate refueling operations and delivered 125 million gallons (475 million liters) of fuel without missing a single scheduled rendezvous. A KC-10 Extender of Travis AFB approaching a second KC-10 for refuelling over the Pacific Ocean, 2017 Since then, the KC-10 had participated in other smaller conflicts. In March 1999, NATO launched Operation Allied Force against the government of Yugoslavia. The mobility portion of the operation began in February and was heavily dependent on tankers. By early May 1999, some 150 KC-10s and KC-135s deployed to Europe where they refueled bombers, fighters and support aircraft engaged in the conflict. The KC-10 flew 409 missions throughout the entire Allied Force campaign and continued support operations in Kosovo. Since 11 September 2001, KC-10s had also flown more than 350 missions guarding U.S. skies as a part of Operation Noble Eagle. During Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, KC-10s have flown more than 1,390 missions delivering critical air refueling support to numerous joint and Coalition receiver aircraft. KC-10s are expected to serve until 2043.Veronico and Dunn 2004, p. 58. The Air Force considered retiring its fleet of KC-10 tankers in response to sequestration budget cuts as part of the service's FY 2015 budget. A \\"vertical chop\\" to divest all KC-10s was suggested because there are fewer KC-10s than KC-135s, having three different tanker models in service (after the introduction of the KC-46) would be costly, and a \\"horizontal cut\\" across the refueling fleets would achieve small efficiencies.Air Force May Scrap KC-10 Tanker Fleet ‚Äì DoDBuzz.com, 17 September 2013 Some believed retiring the KC-10 would not benefit the Air Force, given that it is equipped with both boom and hose-and-drogue refueling systems and the fleet's relatively young age. At first, officials claimed that the initial focus on retiring the KC-10 in September 2013 was a \\"trial balloon\\" to call attention to Air Force operating cost issues; as of early 2013, the KC-10 had a per hour flying cost of $21,170 and a mission capable rate of 87 percent.Air Force May Scrap Entire A-10 Fleet ‚Äì Defensemedianetwork.com, 17 October 2013 A FY 2015 budget plan did not include cuts to the KC-10.How Hagel spending plan will transform US military ‚Äì Flightglobal.com, 26 February 2014 On 13 July 2020, the first US KC-10, tail number 86-0036 was retired and transferred to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona ‚Äî the aircraft graveyard known as \\"the Boneyard\\".https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2020/07/16/first- kc-10-heads-to-boneyard-as-pegasus-comes- in/?utm_source=Sailthru&utm;_medium=email&utm;_campaign=EBB%2007.17.20&utm;_term=Editorial%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brie Netherlands The second Royal Netherlands Air Force KDC-10 with landing gear down The two Dutch KDC-10s are used for both refueling and transport.Steffen 1997, pp. 106‚Äì107. They are stationed on Eindhoven Airport as part of the 334th Transport Squadron. Of the 5,500 hours flown in the first 3 years of use, the aircraft were used in their tanker role for 50% of the time. Besides being used by the air force and NATO allies, the KDC-10s are also used to support peacekeeping and humanitarian aid operations. Of the first three years, 32% of the flight hours were used for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid. In this function, the aircraft have been deployed to Kosovo to evacuate refugees, to the Caribbean and Central America to provide humanitarian aid after the hurricanes Luis, Georges and Mitch and to various countries in Africa and Asia to provide development aid. In 1998, the aircraft were also used to evacuate Dutch citizens from Indonesia during the Fall of Suharto. Dutch KDC-10s have been operating out of Manas AFB in support of allied forces during Operation Enduring Freedom and in support of Allied Air Force over Iraq and Syria. A third DC-10, registered T-255 was acquired and served for three years before being withdrawn from service in April 2014 due to Dutch defense cuts and flown to Newquay Airport for scrapping. The KDC-10s in Dutch service are in the process of being replaced with the Airbus A330 MRTT. The first aircraft, registered T-264/'Prins Bernhard' and due for a major service, was withdrawn from use on 1 November 2019, prior to transfer to its new owner, Omega Aerial Refueling Services. The last KDC-10, registered T-235/'Jan Scheffer' is to remain in Dutch service until late 2021, when it is to transfer to Omega. Civilian operators Omega's KDC-10 tanker in March 2009 Commercial refueling companies Omega Aerial Refueling Services and Global Air Tanker Service operate two KDC-10 tankers (N974VV and N852V, respectively) for lease. They were converted from DC-10-40s and provide probe and drogue refueling capabilities from wing pods similar to the KC-10. In June and July 2011, Omega Air's KDC-10 supported 3 of Royal Australian Air Force's F/A-18 Hornets, en route to Red Flag ‚Äì Alaska.\\"RAAF Hornets Participate in Red Flag Alaska\\" Air Forces Monthly (Key Publishing), Issue 282, September 2011, pp. 37. .

Background Paul Riquet was born in B√©ziers, H√©rault, France, the eldest son of solicitor, state prosecutor and businessman Guillaume Riquet. As a youth, Riquet was only interested in mathematics and science. He married Catherine de Milhau at age 19. As a fermier g√©n√©ral (\\"farmer-general\\") of Languedoc-Roussillon, he was a tax farmer responsible for the collection and administration of the gabelle (salt tax) in Languedoc. He was appointed collector in 1630, and was also a munitions provider to the Catalan Army. Riquet became wealthy and was given permission by the King to levy his own taxes. This gave him greater wealth, which allowed him to execute grand projects with technical expertise. The Canal du Midi Riquet is the man responsible for building the 240-kilometre- long artificial waterway that links the southern coast of France to Toulouse to link to the canal/river system that ran across to the Bay of Biscay, one of the great engineering feats of the 17th century. The logistics were immense and complex, so much so that other engineers including the ancient Romans had discussed the idea but not proceeded with it. Even so, Louis XIV was keen for the project to proceed, largely because of the increasing cost and danger of transporting cargo and trade around southern Spain where pirates were common. Planning, financing, and construction of the Canal du Midi completely absorbed Riquet from 1665 forward. Numerous problems occurred, including navigating around many hills and providing a system that would feed the canal with water through the dry summer months. Advances in lock engineering and the creation of a 6 million cubic metre artificial lake, the Bassin de St. Ferr√©ol which harvested water from streams on the Black Mountain near the Naurouze watershed, provided solutions. The high cost of construction depleted Riquet's personal fortune and the seemingly insurmountable problems caused his sponsors, including Louis XIV, to lose interest. Riquet's major engineering achievements included the Fonseranes Lock Staircase and the Malpas Tunnel, the world's first navigable canal tunnel. The canal was completed in 1681, eight months after Riquet's death. He is buried in the Cathedral Saint-Etienne in Toulouse.

It was originally a wing of the Fulton Market, established in 1822 to sell a variety of foodstuffs and produce. In November 2005, the Fish Market relocated to a new facility in Hunts Point in the Bronx, from its historic location near the Brooklyn Bridge along the East River waterfront at and above Fulton Street in the Financial District, Lower Manhattan. During much of its 183-year tenure at the original site, the Fulton Fish Market was the most important wholesale East Coast fish market in the United States. Opened in 1822, it was the destination of fishing boats from across the Atlantic Ocean. By the 1950s, most of the Market's fish were trucked in rather than offloaded from the docks. The wholesalers at the Market then sold it to restaurateurs and retailers who purchased fresh fish of every imaginable variety. Prices at the Fulton Fish Market were tracked and reported by the United States government. In its original location, it was one of the last, and most significant, of the great wholesale food markets of New York. It survived major fires in 1835, 1845, 1918, and 1995. In its new location in the Hunts Point Cooperative Market, it handles millions of pounds of seafood daily, with annual sales exceeding $1 billion, and is second in size only to Tokyo's Tsukiji fish market.Description History=Nineteenth century Fulton Street Fish Market, 1936 The Fulton Fish Market was one of New York's earliest open-air fish markets. From a New York newspaper dated 1831: The Fulton Fish Market initially served primarily housekeepers from the surrounding areas and Brooklyn. However, by 1850, wholesalers had become the main buyers as the market gained in prominence. The Fulton Fish Market is one of the oldest fish markets in the United States, in competition with the smaller Maine Avenue Fish Market in Washington, D.C. The Fulton Market was claimed to be the oldest in continuous operation in one place (since 1822) until it was relocated in 2005. The Maine Avenue Market in D.C. (since 1805, in various incarnations) is now considered the oldest continuously operating open-air market that still survives on the East Coast. However, the Fulton Fish Market is the oldest institution that still retains a primarily wholesale function; although its original public market on South Street is now closed. Organized crime  During most of the 20th century the market was associated with one or more New York Mafia families. In 1988, the U.S. Attorney's Office filed a suit under federal racketeering laws to appoint a trustee to run the market. A trustee was appointed, but the extent to which he was able to limit organized crime influence was limited. Since 2001, the market has been regulated by the City of New York's Business Integrity Commission in an effort to eliminate organized crime influence. New Bronx facility  Entrance gate On November 14, 2005, nearly 4 years after construction on the $85 million facility began, the Market opened at its Bronx location. The move had been delayed due to legal problems. The last-minute dispute was between a company which had had a ten-year monopoly on delivering fish from trucks to individual sellers' stalls, versus the cooperative of sellers who wanted to do the task themselves in the new building. When the feuding parties agreed to continue as they had been for another three years, the last obstacle to the move was removed and packing began. The move from the historic Manhattan site was due to a number of factors: * cramped location * lack of modern amenities, such as climate control * increasing real estate value of Manhattan site for retail and residential use * redevelopment pressure due to desirable proximity to the South Street Seaport and the Fulton Street/East River area The move brought 650 workers from the market's former location into the Bronx, with an additional 5500 diesel truck trips through Hunts Point per week (according to the NY Metropolitan Transportation Council) ‚Äì bringing the weekly total to 60,000. The facility generates over $1 billion in yearly revenue, and allows seafood distributors to store their goods in temperature controlled warehouses with easier transportation access due to its proximity to the Bruckner Expressway. The facility has better access to major highways in Hunts Point, but doesn't utilize the nearby LaGuardia Airport in Queens. In 2012, the market handled of fish annually, at an estimated value of $1 billion.

Her father was a Mercian nobleman, √Üthelred Mucel, Ealdorman of the Gaini, which is thought to be an old Mercian tribal group. Her mother was Eadburh, a member of the Mercian royal family, and according to the historian Richard Abels she was a descendant of King Cenwulf of Mercia.Keynes & Lapidge, Asser, pp. 77; 240‚Äì41; Abels, Alfred the Great, p. 121 She is commemorated as a saint in the Christian East and the West on 20 July.http://catholicsaints.info/saint-elswith, http://www.antiochian.org/node/19095 Life She was married to Alfred in 868 at Gainsborough, Lincolnshire. His elder brother √Üthelred was then king, and Alfred was regarded as heir apparent.Keynes & Lapidge, Asser, p. 77Costambeys, Ealhswith The Danes occupied the Mercian town of Nottingham in that year, and the marriage was probably connected with an alliance between Wessex and Mercia.Williams, Ealhswith Alfred became king on his brother's death in 871. Ealhswith is very obscure in contemporary sources. She did not witness any known charters, and Asser did not even mention her name in his life of King Alfred. In accordance with ninth century West Saxon custom, she was not given the title of queen. According to King Alfred, this was because of the infamous conduct of a former queen of Wessex called Eadburh, who had inadvertently poisoned her husband when trying to poison another.Keynes & Lapidge Asser, pp. 71‚Äì72, 235‚Äì236 Alfred left his wife three important symbolic estates in his will, Edington in Wiltshire, the site of one important victory over the Vikings, Lambourn in Berkshire, which was near another, and Wantage, his birthplace. These were all part of his bookland, and they stayed in royal possession after her death. It was probably after Alfred's death in 899 that Ealhswith founded the convent of St Mary's Abbey, Winchester, known as the Nunnaminster. She died on 5 December 902, and was buried in her son Edward's new Benedictine abbey, the New Minster, Winchester. She is commemorated in two early tenth century manuscripts as \\"the true and dear lady of the English\\". Ealhswith had a brother called √Üthelwulf, who was ealdorman of western and possibly central Mercia under his niece's husband, √Üthelred, Lord of the Mercians, in the 890s.Hart, \\"Athelstan Half-king\\", p. 116 He died in 901.

The film was produced independently for a low budget, shot entirely on-location in New York City, and also starred Arnold Stang, James Karen, and Ernest Graves. Plot Hercules, at Olympus, berates his father Zeus for not allowing him to leave the gods' abode to adventure on earth. Eventually Zeus sends Hercules, on a beam, to the land of men. After some strange encounters in the air and at sea, Hercules arrives in New York City, where hilarity ensues in the form of interactions with various New Yorkers, who regard him as physically superior but socially awkward. He befriends a skinny little man called Pretzie. Hercules becomes a successful professional wrestler. Zeus, watching Hercules from the heights, becomes irritated with Hercules' antics, which he feels are making a mockery of the gods, and calls on Mercury to stop Hercules. After Mercury tries but fails to bring Hercules home, Zeus orders Nemesis to see to it that Hercules is consigned to the infernal regions ruled over by Pluto. However, Hera instead convinces Nemesis to poison Hercules with a poison that would strip him of his divinity and then talk to Pluto. Nemesis informs Pluto of what is happening and he bets a large sum of money against Hercules in an upcoming strongman competition with Hercules' gangster manager. When Hercules loses the strongman competition his friends try to lead off Hercules' angry manager's henchmen, but Hercules follows them to save them. Meanwhile, Zeus uncovers the truth from Nemesis as to what is happening but only intervenes at the last minute to restore Hercules' divinity, not wanting any son of his to die at the hands of a mortal. Hercules defeats the gangsters and realizes that he has been disobedient and returns to the heavens shortly after, only saying good-bye to Pretzie over a radio after he leaves. In the heavens, Zeus tells Juno and Hercules that he will not punish Hercules for his behavior as they ask him about it and then asks to be left alone. They leave him alone, and upon their departure, Zeus sneaks out of the heavens and descends to earth, scaring a passenger jet on his way down. CastProduction Hercules in New York was the acting debut of Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was 22 years old. At the time he was living in Los Angeles and making ends meet by running a bricklaying business with fellow bodybuilder Franco Columbu, while weight training and participating in bodybuilding competitions. Schwarzenegger, who had expressed interest in pursuing an acting career, auditioned at the encouragement of his friend Reg Park, a successful bodybuilder who had starred in a series of successful ‚ÄúHercules‚Äù films produced in Italy. According to Schwarzenegger, during his audition his agent said he had years of \\"stage\\" experience, implying theater, when he had only appeared on bodybuilding stages. The film was also the directorial debut of Arthur Allan Seidelman, who up until then had only directed theatre. The film was independently produced on a low budget, and filmed entirely in real locations in New York City. Supposedly, several scenes including an elaborate chariot chase were shot without permits. Playing the film's title character, Schwarzenegger, because of his long last name and to play off the name of fellow cast member comedian Arnold Stang, is credited as \\"Arnold Strong 'Mr. Universe'\\". At the time filming began, Schwarzenegger had just come in first place in both professional and amateur Universe Championships. Production of the film coincided with his training for the competition for the second year in a row, and after it ended he won the professional title again, beating Park. Schwarzenegger had all his lines dubbed by an uncredited voice actor due to his thick Austrian accent,Swarzenegger, Arnold; Total Recall: My Unbelievably True Life Story, page 115. . although the Trimark DVD has an \\"Original English Dialogue\\" audio track with Arnold's voice. However, in that version's final scene, Schwarzenegger's voice is not restored when Hercules speaks to Pretzie through his small transistor radio, since that scene was shot without Schwarzenegger present and the voice was added via ADR. Copyright On October 19, 2006, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that rightsholder Premiere Pictures was auctioning off the rights to the film on eBay for a minimum bid of $550,000.

To various supporters of this policy, it made little sense to talk of a big EU market, with freedom of movement within it for goods, persons and services, unless the various regions and national networks making up that market were properly linked by modern and efficient infrastructure. The construction of Trans-European Networks was also seen as an important element for economic growth and the creation of employment. The Treaty Establishing the European Community first provided a legal basis for the TENs. Under the terms of Chapter XV of the Treaty (Articles 154, 155 and 156), the European Union must aim to promote the development of Trans-European Networks as a key element for the creation of the Internal Market and the reinforcement of Economic and Social Cohesion. This development includes the interconnection and interoperability of national networks as well as access to such networks. According with these objectives, the European Commission developed guidelines covering the objectives, priorities, identification of projects of common interest and broad lines of measures for the three sectors concerned (Transports, Energy and Telecommunications). The European Parliament and the Council approved these guidelines after consultation with the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. Many projects of common interest have benefited from financial support of the European Union budget through the TEN-budget line as well as the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund. The European Investment Bank has also greatly contributed to the financing of these projects through loans.

He is considered a key figure in the development of quality initiatives in Japan, particularly the quality circle.ASQ: About Kaoru Ishikawa\\". Accessed 17 November 2014 He is best known outside Japan for the Ishikawa or cause and effect diagram (also known as fishbone diagram) often used in the analysis of industrial processes.  Biography  Born in Tokyo, the oldest of the eight sons of Ichiro Ishikawa. In 1937 he graduated TATIUC with an engineering degree in applied chemistry. After graduating from the University of TATIUC he worked as a naval technical officer from 1939‚Äì1941. Between 1941-1947 Ishikawa worked at the Nissan Liquid Fuel Company. In 1947 Ishikawa started his academic career as an associate professor at the University of Tokyo. He undertook the presidency of the Musashi Institute of Technology in 1978. In 1949, Ishikawa joined the Japanese Union of Scientists and Engineers (JUSE) quality control research group. After World War II Japan looked to transform its industrial sector, which in North America was then still perceived as a producer of cheap wind-up toys and poor quality cameras. It was his skill at mobilizing large groups of people towards a specific common goal that was largely responsible for Japan's quality-improvement initiatives. He translated, integrated and expanded the management concepts of W. Edwards Deming and Joseph M. Juran into the Japanese system. After becoming a full professor in the Faculty of Engineering at The University of Tokyo (1960) Ishikawa introduced the concept of quality circles (1962) in conjunction with JUSE. This concept began as an experiment to see what effect the \\"leading hand\\" (Gemba-cho) could have on quality. It was a natural extension of these forms of training to all levels of an organization (the top and middle managers having already been trained). Although many companies were invited to participate, only one company at the time, Nippon Telephone & Telegraph, accepted. Quality circles would soon become very popular and form an important link in a company's Total Quality Management system. Ishikawa would write two books on quality circles (QC Circle Koryo and How to Operate QC Circle Activities). Among his efforts to promote quality were the Annual Quality Control Conference for Top Management (1963) and several books on quality control (the Guide to Quality Control (1968) contained the first published example of a Pareto chart.) He was the chairman of the editorial board of the monthly Statistical Quality Control. Ishikawa was involved in international standardization activities. 1982 saw the development of the Ishikawa diagram which is used to determine root causes. At Ishikawa's 1989 death, Juran delivered this eulogy:Westcott, Russell T. \\"Leave A Legacy\\". Quality Progress. December 2009. p. 63.

Duration The event lasts for three weekends, usually the first three weekends in February. Very few events take place from Monday to Thursday in between weekends 1 and 2, and weekends 2 and 3. This means that the skating rink is much less crowded and that the ice stays in a near pristine condition for much of the day, with only a thousand or so skaters sharing it instead of the greater numbers during the weekend. The skate changing shacks and food catering kiosks scattered along the length of the skateway, at the same level as the ice, are open day long during the week. Weather The weather in Ottawa is notoriously unpredictable, and Winterlude often is hampered by mild weather. Mild weather is the bane of the Canal, as proper ice conditions require -10 degrees Celsius for proper freezing. The length of the skating season, (which extends longer than the Winterlude weekends) is therefore unpredictable. However, most events are usually not affected other than premature melting of ice and snow sculptures. The length to which the canal is open for skating varies greatly, in the 2001-2002 season there was a record low 34 days open. The very next season, 2002‚Äì2003, the canal was open for a near high-record of 72 days.Canal Season Image:Winterlude ice sculpture museum.jpgIce sculpture museum carved out of snow at the annual Winterlude File:Winterlude Ice Train.JPGSculptures in Confederation Park are illuminated nightly File:Balnaphone2010 02 09 13 37 53.jpgH2Orchestra performing at Winterlude 2010 for an audience of approximately 10,000, outside the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Gatineau, Quebec Image:DowsLakeSkating.pngSkating at Dows Lake Image:Winterlude Merlin.jpgWinterlude performance art on stilts.

With a highly individualistic and spontaneous clarinet style that \\"defied classification\\", Russell began his career playing Dixieland jazz, but throughout his career incorporated elements of newer developments such as swing, bebop and free jazz. In the words of the poet Philip Larkin, \\"No one familiar with the characteristic excitement of his solos, their lurid, snuffling, asthmatic voicelessness, notes leant on till they split, and sudden passionate intensities, could deny the uniqueness of his contribution to jazz.\\"Larkin, All What Jazz, p. 47 (October 14, 1961). Early life Pee Wee Russell was born in Maplewood, Missouri, and grew up in Muskogee, Oklahoma. As a child, he first studied violin, but \\"couldn't get along with it\\", then piano, disliking the scales and chord exercises, and then drums - including all the associated special effects. Then his father sneaked young Ellsworth into a dance at the local Elks Club to a four- or five-piece band led by New Orleans jazz clarinetist Alcide \\"Yellow\\" Nunez. Russell was amazed by Nunez's improvisations: \\"[He] played the melody, then got hot and played jazz. That was something. How did he know where he was or where he was going?\\" Pee Wee now decided that his primary instrument would be the clarinet, and the type of music he would play would be jazz. He approached the clarinettist in the pit band at the local theatre for lessons, and bought an Albert-system instrument. His teacher was named Charlie Merrill, and used to pop out for shots of corn whiskey during lessons.Smith, \\"Pee Wee Russell\\", pp. 104, 106‚Äì7. In a later profile, Russell said that he took up piano, drums and violin \\"in roughly that order\\". Then, after playing in a school recital, one day he put his violin on the back seat of the family car and his mother got in and sat on it. \\"That was the end of my violin career. 'Thank God that's over,' I said to myself.\\" (Balliett, \\"Even his Feet Look Sad\\", p. 129). His family moved to St. Louis, Missouri, in 1920, and that September Russell was enrolled in the Western Military Academy in Alton, Illinois. He remained enrolled there until October the following year, though he spent most of his time playing clarinet with various dance and jazz bands. He began touring professionally in 1922, and travelled widely with the Allen Brothers tent show and on riverboats St. Paul and J.S. He also played with a Charles Creath band at the Booker T. Washington Theater, a cultural epicenter for African Americans at the time.Dennis Owsley, City of Gabriels: The History of Jazz in St. Louis 1895-1973 Russell's recording debut was in 1924 with Herb Berger's Band in St. Louis on \\"Fuzzy Wuzzy Bird.\\". Career Pee Wee Russell, Muggsy Spanier, Miff Mole and Joe Grauso, Nick's (Tavern), New York, ca. June 1946 From his earliest career, Russell's style was distinctive. The notes he played were somewhat unorthodox when compared to his contemporaries, and he was sometimes accused of playing out of tune. By the mid-1920s Russell was a sought-after jazz clarinetist and worked with Jack Teagarden in pianist Peck Kelly's band in Texas. Back in St. Louis, Russell played with Frankie Trumbauer and Bix Beiderbecke at the Arcadia Ballroom, which had hired Trumbauer as bandleader for the season spanning September 1925 and May 1926. For a short while, Jack Teagarden also played at the Arcadia, and Russell claimed that this was the greatest band he had ever played in.Jean Pierre Lion: Bix: The Definitive Biography of a Jazz Legend p. 106 In 1926 he joined Jean Goldkette's band, and the following year he left for New York City to join Red Nichols. While with Nichols's band, Russell did frequent freelance recording studio work, on clarinet, soprano, alto and tenor sax, and bass clarinet. He worked with various bandleaders (including Louis Prima) before beginning a series of residences at the famous jazz club \\"Nick's\\" in Greenwich Village, Manhattan, in 1937. He played with Bobby Hackett's big band, and began playing with Eddie Condon, with whom he would continue to work, off and on, for much of the rest of his life - though he complained, \\"Those guys [at Nick's and Condon's] made a joke, of me, a clown, and I let myself be treated that way because I was afraid. I didn't know where else to go, where to take refuge\\".Balliett, \\"Even his Feet Look Sad\\", pp. 133‚Äì4. From the 1940s onwards, Russell's health was often poor, exacerbated by alcoholism - \\"I lived on brandy milkshakes and scrambled-egg sandwiches. And on whiskey ... I had to drink half a pint of whiskey in the morning before I could get out of bed\\"Balliett, \\"Even his Feet Look Sad\\", p. 131. - which led to a major medical breakdown in 1951. He had periods when he could not play. Some people considered that his style was different after his breakdown: Larkin characterized it as \\"a hollow feathery tone framing phrases of an almost Chinese introspection with a tendency to inconclusive garrulity that would have been unheard of in the days when Pee Wee could pack more into a middle eight than any other thirties pick-up player\\".Larkin, All What Jazz, p. 114 (June 10, 1964). He played with Art Hodes, Muggsy Spanier and occasionally bands under his own name in addition to Condon. In his last decade, Russell often played at jazz festivals and international tours organized by George Wein, including an appearance with Thelonious Monk at the 1963 Newport Festival, a meeting which has a mixed reputation (currently available as part of the Monk 2-CD set Live at Newport 1963-65). Russell formed a quartet with valve trombone player Marshall Brown, and included John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman tunes in his repertoire. Though often labeled a Dixieland musician by virtue of the company he kept, he tended to reject any label. Russell's unique and sometimes derided approach was praised as ahead of its time, and cited by some as an early example of free jazz. At the time of their 1961 recording Jazz Reunion (Candid), Coleman Hawkins (who had originally recorded with Russell in 1929 and considered him to be color-blind) observed that '\\"For thirty years, I‚Äôve been listening to him play those funny notes. He used to think they were wrong, but they weren't. He‚Äôs always been way out, but they didn't have a name for it then.\\"Quoted in the sleeve notes for Pee Wee Russell / Coleman Hawkins, Jazz Reunion (Candid 9020) George Wein's Newport All-Stars album includes a slow blues called \\"Pee Wee Russell's Unique Sound\\". By this time, encouraged by Mary, his wife, Russell had taken up painting abstract art as a hobby. Mary's death in the spring of 1967 had a severe effect on him. His last gig was with Wein at the inaugural ball for President Richard Nixon on January 21, 1969. Russell died in a hospital in Alexandria, Virginia, less than three weeks later. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Pee Wee Russell among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

He often worked with his younger brother Battista Dossi, who had worked under Raphael. He painted many mythological subjects and allegories with a rather dream-like atmosphere, and often striking disharmonies in colour. His portraits also often show rather unusual poses or expressions for works originating in a court.Hartt, 617 Biography Dossi was born in San Giovanni del Dosso, a village in the province of Mantua. His early training and life are not well documented; his father, originally of Trento, was a bursar (spenditore or fattore) for the Dukes of Ferrara. He may have had training locally with Lorenzo Costa or in Mantua, where he is known to have been in 1512. By 1514, he would begin three decades of service for dukes Alfonso I and Ercole II d'Este, becoming principal court artist. Dosso worked frequently with his brother Battista Dossi, who had trained in the Roman workshop of Raphael. The works he produced for the dukes included the ephemeral decorations of furniture and theater sets. He is known to have worked alongside il Garofalo in the Costabili polyptych. One of his pupils was Giovanni Francesco Surchi (il Dielai). Dosso Dossi is known less for his naturalism or attention to design, and more for cryptic allegorical conceits in paintings around mythological themes, a favored subject for the humanist Ferrarese court (see also Cosimo Tura and the decoration of the Palazzo Schifanoia). Dossi employed eccentric distortions of proportion, which may appear caricature-like or even 'primitivist'. The art historian Sydney J. Freedberg sees this characteristic as an expression of the Renaissance aesthetic of sprezzatura (i.e. \\"studied carelessness\\", or artistic nonchalance). Dossi is also known for the atypical choices of bright pigment for his cabinet pieces. Some of his works, such as the Deposition have lambent qualities that suggest some of Correggio's works. Most of his works feature Christian and Ancient Greek themes and use oil painting as a medium. The painting Aeneas in the Elysian Fields was part of the Camerino d'Alabastro of Alfonso I in the Este Castle, decorated with canvases depicting bacchanalia and erotic subjects including Feast of the Gods by Giovanni Bellini and Venus Worship by Titian. The frieze paintings were based on the Aeneid; this scene by Dossi is book 6, lines 635‚Äì709, wherein Aeneas is guided over the bridge into the Elysian Fields by the Cumaean Sibyl. Orpheus with the lyre flits in the forest; in the background are the ghostly horses of dead warriors. In Hercules and the Pygmies, Hercules has fallen asleep after defeating Antaeus, and is set upon by an army of thumb-size pygmies, whom he defeats. He gathers them in his lion skin. Paintings depicting a powerful Hercules were commonly made for the then-ruler Duke Ercole II d'Este. The subjects of the Mythological Scene and Tubalcain are unknown. Portrait of a Youth, the only confirmed portrait of Lucrezia Borgia by Dosso Dossi (1514‚Äì1516), at the National Gallery of Victoria. Recently, \\"Portrait of a Youth\\" at the National Gallery of Victoria, the mysterious portrait of an unknown subject by an unknown painter, has been identified as a portrait of Lucrezia Borgia by Dosso Dossi.

He is Chief Creative Officer of global content creator, producer and distributor Endemol Shine Group, leading the company‚Äôs creative direction globally and overseeing the Group‚Äôs UK business. Prior to taking his current role in April 2016, Salmon was Director of BBC Studios, the corporation's production arm, and before that held a number of senior BBC roles including Chief Creative Officer of BBC Vision, effectively overseeing all of BBC television's in-house programme production, and Director of BBC North. Early life and career Born in Burnley, Lancashire, Peter Derek Salmon studied at St Theodore's RC High School in the town and then the University of Warwick and graduated in 1977 with a degree in European literature. He then spent six months working for the Voluntary Service Overseas charity, as a teacher in Sarawak. However, he had to return home sooner than expected when his father became ill with lung cancer, and he worked for a time in factories in his native Burnley. His father subsequently recovered, and Salmon obtained a job as a British Government press officer, before going on, in 1978, to work as a junior reporter for the Chatham News and Standard newspaper, where he worked alongside Martin Brunt, now crime correspondent of Sky News. He is also a fan of Burnley F.C..  Career =Initial BBC career In 1981 Salmon joined the staff of the BBC in London as one of six general trainees, alongside Kevin Lygo (now head of studios at ITV), multi-award-winning film-maker Peter Kosminsky and internet entrepreneur Dominic Cameron. In 1984 he was the director of the first dramatic reconstruction to be featured on the crime series Crimewatch, and he later went on to produce the programme. He also worked on the children's magazine show Blue Peter and the current affairs series Newsnight. In 1989 he moved away from the central BBC in London to become the Head of Television Features at BBC Bristol. There he oversaw over forty environmental documentaries made by the BBC Natural History Unit, and was also responsible for forging the BBC's relationship with Bristol-based animation studio Aardman Animations, becoming an executive producer on the company's Academy Award-winning short film The Wrong Trousers (1993). Channel 4 and Granada In 1993 he left the BBC to take up a position as Head of Factual Programmes at Channel 4, having been specifically identified as a \\"rising star\\" by the channel's Chief Executive, Michael Grade. There he oversaw long-running documentary series such as Equinox and Cutting Edge, as well as his own commissions such as the controversial The Dying Rooms and The Red Light Zone, although the latter was much-criticised as over-sensationalist and lacking serious journalistic content. However, during his time in charge of Channel 4's factual programmes, the department won several British Academy Television Awards, Royal Television Society Awards, International Emmys and two successive Prix Italias. During his time at Channel 4, Salmon was also responsible for overseeing the channel's annual Alternative Christmas Message, broadcast opposite Queen Elizabeth II's official message on BBC One and ITV every 25 December at 3pm. In 1994, Salmon attracted some criticism for choosing the controversial American civil rights campaigner Jesse Jackson to deliver the message. He left Channel 4 in February 1996 to become Director of Programmes at Granada Television, one of the largest companies of the ITV network and one of the major providers of nationally-networked programming for the channel. During his time at Granada he oversaw successes such as the comedy-drama Cold Feet (1997) and the docudrama Hillsborough (1996), although both of these had already been commissioned before he joined the company. BBC One In 1997 he left Granada after only twenty months to return to the BBC when the job of Controller of BBC One, the corporation's primary channel, became available. This vacancy had come as something of a surprise, resulting from Michael Jackson's sudden move to Channel 4 after just a year in charge. Salmon took charge of BBC One in September 1997. Salmon rejoined the BBC at a difficult time, when it was losing many senior executives such as Jackson to rival broadcasters. Responsible for a ¬£652 million annual programming budget, Salmon commissioned several successful programmes, such as the drama series Clocking Off (2000‚Äì03) and the sitcoms Dinnerladies (1998‚Äì2000) and My Family (2000‚Äì2011). However, prior to the arrival of new Director-General of the BBC Greg Dyke in 2000, BBC One had suffered from under-investment, and for three successive years of Salmon's time in charge the channel was criticised in the annual report of the Board of Governors of the BBC for its performance and output. Dyke himself criticised the channel directly during the 2000 Edinburgh International Television Festival, firstly claiming it \\"had to do better\\" while delivering the annual MacTaggart Lecture, and then later criticising the policy of building lightweight drama series such as Harbour Lights (1999‚Äì2000) and Sunburn (1999‚Äì2000) around former soap opera stars. Salmon also found himself criticised in the media for rescheduling and cutting back on the annual number of editions of BBC One's flagship current affairs series Panorama, as well as the decision not to broadcast a public pageant held to celebrate the Queen Mother's 100th birthday. BBC One also saw its audience fall to record lows on several occasions during Salmon's period in charge. Finally, on 13 September 2000, the BBC officially announced that Salmon was to leave BBC One to become the new Director of BBC Sport. His successor was eventually confirmed as being Lorraine Heggessey, who had been widely speculated as replacing Salmon even before his departure had been confirmed. BBC Sport, Television Corporation and BBC Vision Productions Salmon's new role saw the BBC's sports coverage across television, radio and online services being brought together under a single head of department for the first time. Although the BBC lost the prestigious television rights to The Boat Race in 2004 during Salmon's period in charge, the department was able to win back high-profile events such as the FA Cup (in 2001, after having previously lost the event to ITV in 1997), England football internationals (in 2001), and FA Premier League football highlights for Match of the Day (2004). He also oversaw the development of interactive television coverage of the Wimbledon tennis championships and the 2002 Commonwealth Games, and was in charge of the BBC's coverage of the prestigious 2002 FIFA World Cup, 2004 UEFA European Football Championship and 2004 Summer Olympics events. He was aided in these achievements by a large increase in the department's budget from Director-General Greg Dyke; in 2003 alone, BBC Sport was given a budget of ¬£300 million. In July 2005, he left the BBC to become the Chief Executive of the independent production company Television Corporation, producers of programmes such as The Hamburg Cell. However, when Television Corporation was taken over by the Welsh company Tinopolis, Salmon left the organisation. He returned to the BBC in 2006 to become Chief Creative Officer of the new \\"BBC Vision Productions\\" set-up, overseeing all creative output from the BBC's in-house production centres. In December 2008 he became the director of BBC North Group Division, and in May 2014 was appointed Director of BBC England. Personal life He is married to the actress Sarah Lancashire. They have a son together. Salmon has three sons from a previous relationship, and Sarah has two sons from a previous marriage.

Belonging to the astrophyllite group, astrophyllite may be classed either as an inosilicate, phyllosilicate, or an intermediate between the two. It forms an isomorphous series with kupletskite, to which it is visually identical and often intimately associated. Astrophyllite is of interest primarily to scientists and collectors. Heavy, soft and fragile, astrophyllite typically forms as bladed, radiating stellate aggregates. It is this crystal habit that gives astrophyllite its name, from the Greek words astron meaning \\"star\\" and phyllon meaning \\"leaf\\". Its great submetallic gleam and darkness contrast sharply with the light (felsic) matrix the mineral is regularly found within. Astrophyllite is usually opaque to translucent, but may be transparent in thin specimens. As the crystals themselves possess perfect cleavage, they are typically left in situ, the entire aggregate often cut into slabs and polished. Owing to its limited availability and high cost, astrophyllite is seldom seen in an ornamental capacity. It is sometimes used in jewellery where it is fashioned into cabochons. Found in cavities and fissures in unusual felsic igneous rocks, astrophyllite is associated with feldspar, mica, titanite, zircon, nepheline, and aegirine. Common impurities include magnesium, aluminium, calcium, zirconium, niobium, and tantalum. It was first discovered in 1854 at its type locality; Laven Island, Norway. Kupletskite was not known until 1956, over a hundred years later. Astrophyllite is found in a few scarce, remote localities: Mont-Saint-Hilaire, Quebec, Canada; Pikes Peak, Colorado, US; Narsarsuk and Kangerdluarsuk, Greenland; Brevig, Norway; and the Kola Peninsula, Russia.

It was created in 1672 for Thomas Clifford. The title was created as \\"Clifford of Chudleigh\\" rather than simply \\"Clifford\\" to differentiate it from several other Clifford Baronies previously created for members of this ancient family, including the Barony of de Clifford (1299), which is extant but now held by a branch line of the Russell family, having inherited through several female lines. Baron Clifford of Chudleigh is the senior surviving male representative of the ancient Norman family which later took the name de Clifford which arrived in England during the Norman Conquest of 1066, feudal barons of Clifford, first seated in England at Clifford Castle in Herefordshire, created Baron de Clifford by writ in 1299. The family seat is Ugbrooke Park, near Chudleigh, Devon. Notable members of this branch of the Clifford family include antiquarian Arthur Clifford (grandson of the 3rd Baron), Victoria Cross recipient Sir Henry Hugh Clifford (son of the 7th Baron), Catholic clergyman William Clifford (son of the 7th Baron) and colonial administrators Sir Bede Clifford (son of the 10th Baron) and Sir Hugh Clifford (grandson of the 7th Baron).

The village lies on the South West Coast Path near to Baggy Point, which is owned by the National Trust. It lies within the North Devon Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Croyde village and its beach faces the Atlantic Ocean near the western limit of the Bristol Channel. Croyde Stream runs through the village, eventually leading to the beach. The centre of the village is roughly at the intersection of Hobbes' Hill, Jones' Hill and St. Mary's Road. At this spot, Croyde Bridge carries the road over the stream. Public services are provided by the North Devon District Council (NDDC) based in Barnstaple. The village is in the civil parish of Georgeham, and for ecclesiastical purposes within the Diocese of Exeter. Today The village has several small campsites, a small retail area and two large holiday parks; Croyde Bay Holiday Resort (operated by UNISON) and Ruda Holiday Park, operated by Parkdean Resorts. The past 30 years has seen large increases in younger-age visitors develop around surfing. The impact of tourism on the village has been varied. Some local landowners have benefited from the increased property prices. Tourism has helped to create jobs that were lost in agriculture. Local farming has declined, with former farmland converted into caravan sites and fields for seasonal camping. Like many seaside villages, the phenomenon of second homes has pushed house prices beyond the reach of most local people. There is little year-round employment, because tourism is seasonal, and most businesses are closed out of season. Since 1999, Croyde has hosted an annual surfing and music festival (GoldCoast Oceanfest) on the weekend closest to the summer solstice. Croyde has also benefitted from the 'street food revolution,' being the hometown of Lola's Wings who have a pitch there, and other visiting street food trucks and trailers. During the summer season, there is an outdoor market each Tuesday which is held in a field off Moor Lane past Ruda Holiday Park heading towards Baggy Point.  History  Croyde supposedly takes its Celtic name from the Viking raider Crydda. However, others have speculated that as the word is similar to the Cornish word 'Curd' that describes the geographical position of the village resting amongst a cradle of hills, it could also have taken its name from this. There is evidence of a settlement that dates before the Saxon Period though, so the correct name is unclear. Croyde is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Crideholde / Crideholda: Erchenbald from Robert, Count of Mortain. 11 cattle and 100 sheep were recorded in the Domesday Book at Crideholde / Crideholda (Croyde) in 1086. In the Medieval Period, there was a market sited at Croyde, most likely near the centre of the village where Jones' Hill, Hobbs' Hill, and St Mary's Road meet. During World War 2, in 1943, the hamlet was commandeered by American soldiers who practised manoeuvres for the D-day landings. Most training took place on Saunton Sands/Braunton Burrows. After the war, Croyde returned to being a predominantly holiday resort. In the 60s, about 150M south east of Withywell Lane, a Royal Observer Corps (ROC) bunker was constructed due to rising tensions with the Soviet Union and the need to watch the skies all over the UK for Soviet planes and or nuclear bombs / missiles. The bunker was disbanded in the 90s after the end of the Cold War and now sits in disrepair.  Religious sites  Croyde has an Anglican church, St Mary Magdalene, and a Baptist chapel which is open on Sundays at 11 am.  Transport  The nearest railway station is Barnstaple, away. From Monday to Saturday, there is an hourly bus service to Croyde from Barnstaple, with a two-hour frequency on Sundays. Road transport from the M5 motorway is via the A361 trunk road. Ferry services operate between Ilfracombe, roughly around 10‚Äì20 miles away, and Lundy Island. The nearest airport to the village is Exeter International Airport, the second-closest being Bristol International.  Education  Croyde has no education resources in the village. Children have access to Georgeham Primary School; secondary education is provided by Braunton Academy.  Beach  Panorama of Croyde Beach The sandy beach, which lost its Blue Flag status in 2012 due to water quality issues, lies at the back of the sheltered Croyde Bay. A large dune system has formed past the high-tide mark. Sand underlies the land surface between the beach and the centre of Croyde village, to the east. The beach forms the middle section of a trio of sandy beaches north of the Taw Estuary. Three-and-three-quarter-mile-long (6.0 km) Saunton Sands is to the south, and Woolacombe Sands, divided into Putsborough and Woolacombe beaches, is to the north. Barbecues and contained fires are not permitted on Croyde beach. Croyde is used for surfing; the rides are generally short as the waves tend to pitch up and break quickly. There is a point break off Down End. There is a reef break at the northern (Baggy Point) end of the beach that works for about 60 minutes during some high tides. The shape of the bay funnels waves towards the beach. The beach is also steeper than either Woolacombe, Putsborough or Saunton Sands. Due to this, rip currents are extremely strong especially near the rocks at either end of the beach and at low tide, even when there is only a small swell. These currents present danger to the strongest of swimmers. Any bathing should be done within the lifeguard- patrolled area. The break is very compact at low tide, resulting in many injuries.

Upon the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the Czech Republic kept the Czechoslovak flag while Slovakia adopted its own flag. The first flag of Czechoslovakia was based on the flag of Bohemia and was white over red. This was almost identical to the flag of Poland (only the proportion was different), so a blue triangle was added at the hoist in 1920. The flag was banned by the Nazis in 1939 as they established a government nominally in control of Bohemia and Moravia, and a horizontal tricolour of white, red, and blue was used for the duration of the war. The 1920 flag was restored in 1945.  History  The traditional colours of the Czech lands originated from an 1192 coat of arms (depicting a rampant lion with a double silver tail on a field of red). After the establishment of an independent Czechoslovakia in 1918, the country had been using the red and white flag of Bohemia, identical to the Polish flag. Following calls for a new flag to be adopted by the fledgling state, a committee picked a design by Jaroslav Kursa, an archivist in the Czechoslovak Ministry of the Interior. His design included the red and white horizontal stripes derived from the coat of arms of Bohemia and added a blue chevron extended halfway. The flag was officially approved by the National Assembly of Czechoslovakia on 30 March 1920 and since then, it has been in continuous use, with the exception of the German occupation of Czechoslovakia during the Second World War.Government of the Czech Republic The Czech Republic's national flag. Retrieved 4 March 2011.

The founders met while working at Softdisks Gamer's Edge division and started id in 1991. Adrian Carmack's primary role at the company was as an artist, including work on Commander Keen, Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM, Hexen: Beyond Heretic, Quake, Quake II and Quake III Arena. He was a 41%-owner of id until he left the company in 2005. At the time the press was told he felt he had done all he could do in the gaming field and was planning to pursue his passions of art. However, in September 2005, The Wall Street Journal revealed he was taking his former business partners to court, claiming he was effectively fired by them in an attempt to force him to sell his 41% stake in the company for $11 million under the terms of a contract he wants the court to nullify. $11 million is thought to be a fraction of the true value of his stake, which is thought to be closer to $43 million after the company received a $105 million bid from Activision in 2004. Carmack has also been credited for coining the term \\"gibs\\". In September 2014, Carmack was revealed as the new owner of the five- star Heritage Golf & Spa Resort in Killenard, Ireland. In April 2016, it was reported that Carmack had reunited with Romero under a new Galway, Ireland- based start-up, The Night Work Games, to produce a new video game, Blackroom, for which they had launched a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter. The game has been described as \\"a return to fast, violent and masterful play on the PC\\". Later the campaign was put on hold to allow Carmack and Romero time to complete a working demo of the game. According to the two developers, their decision was based on players' feedback regarding the playability of the demo. The company behind Blackroom, Night Work Games, was seeking $700,000 to fund the development of the game. Before being put on hold, the campaign had raised $131,052 from its supporters.

Career Young began his career in graphic design. At age 27 he began working in television, on the Channel 4 soap opera Brookside. Over nearly a decade, he worked his way up to become the show's producer in the early 1990s. His tenure was criticised for taking the show away from its social realist roots towards a more sensationalist, ratings-chasing format. He achieved record ratings for the series and for Channel 4. He also co-created and produced his own successful drama series for Channel 4, And The Beat Goes On. He then moved on to become head of drama at the independent production company Pearson Television, where he oversaw work on ITV police drama The Bill and another soap opera, Channel 5's Family Affairs, which he created, and was executive producer on C5's legal drama series, the BAFTA-nominated Wing and a Prayer. From 1997-2004, he moved to the BBC to become the Controller of Continuing Drama Series for the Corporation's in-house production arm. In this role, he was responsible for overseeing the organisation's in-house continuing episodic drama series. Programmes he oversaw for the BBC included the soap opera EastEnders; medical dramas Doctors (which he co-created), Casualty, and the latter's spin-off series Holby City, which he created; police dramas Dalziel and Pascoe, Waking the Dead, and Merseybeat; anthology shows The Afternoon Play and Murder in Mind; legal drama Judge John Deed; rural-set Down to Earth; comedy-drama Being April; and science-fiction series Doctor Who. 19Television At the end of 2004, Young became head of drama at independent production company 19Television Limited, part of Simon Fuller's 19 Entertainment.

He then co-wrote and sold another pilot to The CW in the US, Austin Golden Hour, a real-time medical drama series format for the 2008-2009 season. The Young and the Restless On 31 December 2015, Young cryptically said on his Twitter about what is next for him in 2016, \\"This year I'm going to be Young and I'm going to be Restless.\\" A few days later, Young sent several other tweets to the Twitter account of the American soap opera, The Young and the Restless, announcing his hiring on the show. It was confirmed by CBS Daytime that Young had been hired as a producer. Young's first episode as a supervising producer aired on 1 February 2016 and his last episode aired on 12 July 2016. On 8 June 2016, after news of the firing of Y&R; executive producer Jill Farren Phelps, came confirmation that Young had replaced Phelps as executive producer of the American soap. His first episode as executive producer aired on 13 July 2016. On 31 July 2017, Daytime Confidential announced that both Kay Alden and Sally Sussman Morina would be departing from the show, with Young being named as the new head writer. In December 2018, reports were released saying that Young had departed the show as executive producer and head writer. Young's departure was later announced, as was the news of Josh Griffith and Tony Morina taking over his positions as head writer and executive producer, respectively.

History The NCC was created by Parliament of Canada in 1959 through the National Capital Act to succeeded the former Federal District Commission (FDC), which has been established in 1927. The FDC, which itself had replaced the earlier Ottawa Improvement Commission created in 1899, had repeatedly failed to convince municipal governments to cooperate in planning efforts regarding the National Capital Region. Although the NCC was given the authority to implement its plans, an authority confirmed by the Supreme Court in Munro v National Capital Commission,See Munro v. NCC, Supreme Court of Canada, 1966. After the 2006 elections, the Government of Canada asked for a formal review of the mandate of the NCC.

The objects and purposes of the NCC are \\"to prepare plans for and assist in the development, conservation and improvement of the National Capital Region in order that the nature and character of the seat of the Government of Canada may be in accordance with its national significance.\\" With 11% of the area‚Äôs landmass, the NCC is the largest landowner in Canada‚Äôs Capital Region. Its assets include: * Gatineau Park * the Greenbelt * the Rideau Canal Skateway * urban lands and parks (e.g. Major‚Äôs Hill Park, Jacques-Cartier Park, Commissioners Park) * Capital Pathway * scenic parkways (e.g. Sir John A. Macdonald Parkway, Sir George-√âtienne Cartier Parkway) * real property * heritage buildings * agricultural and research facilities * and commemorative monuments (e.g. National Holocaust Monument, Royal Canadian Navy Monument) The NCC is also the steward of the Capital‚Äôs six official residences: Rideau Hall, 24 Sussex Drive, Harrington Lake, Stornoway, The Farm and 7 Rideau Gate. The continuing preservation, evolution and management of Confederation Boulevard, the ceremonial route linking key attractions in National Capital Region, on both sides of the Ottawa River, in Ottawa as well as Gatineau, Quebec, are the responsibility of the NCC and its partners. These roles are in contrast with the mandates of the various municipal governments, which serve the benefit of their immediate resident, under provincial legislation, on issues like road maintenance, sewer, water and public transport. The Government of Canada is the largest employer and largest landowner in these two areas, and the NCC thus has a great deal of influence over the cities. This has sometimes been criticized by city officials from Ottawa and Gatineau for a lack of cooperation, such as in 1998 when the NCC proposed levelling a large strip of downtown Ottawa to build a ceremonial boulevard along the city's existing Metcalfe Street. Over the last thirty years, the activities of the NCC have been denounced or castigated by several Quebec governments. They considered municipal affairs to be a purely provincial jurisdiction, according to the constitution of Canada. Others have criticized the group for what they perceive to be poor or misguided planning decisions.Ken Rubin in The Ottawa Citizen, 15 June 1998.

The flag was designed by art teacher ƒ∞smet G√ºney. The design of the flag deliberately employs peaceful and neutral symbols in an attempt to indicate harmony between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities, an ideal that has not yet been realised. In 1963, Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities separated because of Cypriot intercommunal violence. The national flag features the shape of the entirety of the island, with two olive branches below (a symbol of peace between the island's two communities) on white (another symbol of peace). The olive branches signify peace between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots. The map on the flag is a copper-orange colour, symbolising the large deposits of copper ore on the island, from which it may have received its name. Creation The flag of the Republic of Cyprus was preceded by the flag of British Cyprus. Upon independence, Cyprus adopted a new flag. Under the constitution, the flag should ‚Äúhave a neutral design and colour,‚Äù i.e it should not include either blue or red colours (the colours of the flag of Greece and the flag of Turkey), nor portray a cross or a crescent. The original proposal, made by the former British colonial administration, featured a rust-brown K on a white field. It was rejected by the President Makarios III and Vice-President Fazil K√º√ß√ºk, who preferred a flag proposed by ƒ∞smet G√ºney, a Turkish Cypriot art teacher. Following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus and the establishment of the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, Turkish-Cypriots use the flag of Northern Cyprus. In the design of August 1960, the colour of the map is copper (Pantone 144-C). Both the crest and the two olive-tree leaves are olive green (Pantone 336-C). The background is white with the 3:5 ratio. In April 2006 the design was updated, the shape of the olive branches were slightly altered, its color was changed to Pantone 574, The copper color of the map was changed to Pantone 1385 and the ratio was changed to 3:2. Flags produced on Cyprus often differ from the original specifications, both regarding the size of the map and the colours used. The government announced in October 2005, that it would take steps to \\"start from scratch\\" and assure that only flags complying with the official specifications would be produced. Under the constitution of Cyprus, the flag of Cyprus may be flown by state institutions, public corporations, and citizens of the country.  Usage of the flags of Greece and Turkey According to the constitution, private citizens may fly the flag of Cyprus alongside either the Greek flag, the Turkish flag, or both.http://www.mfa.gov.cy/mfa/Embassies/Embassy_Athens.nsf/DMLcy_gr/DMLcy_gr?OpenDocument&print; Other provisions also allow municipalities, educational institutions and the National Guard to do so as well. Since the de facto division of the island, consecutive to the 1974 invasion, the flag of Greece is the only of the two flown in the area under the jurisdiction of the Republic of Cyprus, due to the predominant presence of Greek-Cypriots in that part of the island. Similarly, the flag of Turkey is only observed in the area under the control of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (recognised only by Turkey). Lately, there has been a decrease in the number of Republic of Cyprus government buildings flying the Greek flag. Proposed national flag Proposed flag of the United Republic of Cyprus Under the terms of the Annan Plan for Cyprus, a United Nations proposal to settle the Cyprus dispute, a new national flag would have been adopted by a reconstituted confederal republic of Cyprus. Unlike the current official flag, this version consciously incorporates colours representing Greece (blue) and Turkey (red) alongside a large copper-yellow band for Cyprus; the heraldic blazon is per fess Azure and Gules, a Spanish fess Or fimbriated Argent. It is possible that any future Cyprus settlement will include the adoption of a new flag. The plan was accepted by Turkish Cypriots, but rejected by Greek Cypriots, therefore the plan was not put into place.

Presidents Francisco Flores P√©rez, Ricardo Maduro, George W. Bush, Abel Pacheco, Enrique Bola√±os and Alfonso Portillo The Dominican Republic- Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) is a free trade agreement (legally a treaty under international law). Originally, the agreement encompassed the United States and the Central American countries of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, and was called CAFTA. In 2004, the Dominican Republic joined the negotiations, and the agreement was renamed CAFTA-DR. CAFTA-DR, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and active bilateral free trade agreements such as the Canada-Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement are seen as bloc agreements instead of a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) agreement. Panama has completed negotiations with the United States for a bilateral free trade agreement known as the Panama‚ÄìU.S. Trade Promotion Agreement, and has been in effect since October 2012. The CAFTA-DR constitutes the first free trade agreement between the United States and a small group of developing countries. It was created with the purpose of creating new and better economic opportunities by opening markets, eliminating tariffs, reducing barriers to services, and more. In 2015, it was estimated that the total two-way trade resulted in $53 billion. Nearly all Central American exports to the United States had already been tariff-free thanks to the 1984 Caribbean Basin Initiative. Ratification CAFTA-DR has been approved by the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the United States. The agreement is a treaty under international law, but not under the U.S. Constitution because in the United States laws require majority approval in both houses, while treaties require two-thirds approval in the Senate only. Under U.S. law, CAFTA-DR is a congressional-executive agreement. The U.S. Senate approved the CAFTA-DR on June 30, 2005, by a vote of 54‚Äì45,30 June 2005 Senate Roll Call Vote on Passage of S. 1307 and the U.S. House of Representatives approved the pact on July 28, 2005, by a vote of 217‚Äì215, with two representatives not voting.27 July 2005 House Roll Call Vote on Passage of H.R. 3045 Controversy arose over this vote because it was held open 1 hour and 45 minutes longer than the normal 15 minutes in order to get some members to change their votes.push from Bush, CAFTA is approved\\" 28 July 2005 St. Petersburg Times article For procedural reasons, the Senate took a second vote on CAFTA on July 28 and the pact garnered an additional vote from Sen. Joe Lieberman‚Äîwho had been absent on June 30‚Äîin favor of the agreement.28 July 2005 Senate Roll Call Vote on Passage of H.R. 3045 The implementing legislation became Public Law 109-053 when it was signed by President George W. Bush on August 2, 2005. The Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Honduras have also approved the agreement. They are all the current members of CAFTA-DR. El Salvador became the first country to formally implement CAFTA, which went into effect on March 1, 2006, when the Organization of American States (OAS) received signed copies of the treaty. On April 1, 2006, Honduras and Nicaragua fully implemented the agreement. On May 18, 2006, the Congress of Guatemala ratified CAFTA-DR, which went into effect on July 1, 2006. The Dominican Republic implemented the agreement on March 1, 2007. In a referendum on October 7, 2007, Costa Rica narrowly backed the free trade agreement, with 51.6% voting \\"Yes\\"; the agreement took effect on January 1, 2009.Latinamerica Press: Article Aims The goal of the agreement is the creation of a free trade area similar to NAFTA, which currently encompasses the United States, Canada, and Mexico. CAFTA-DR is also seen as a stepping stone towards the FTAA, another (more ambitious) free trade agreement that would encompass all the South American and Caribbean nations as well as those of North and Central America except Cuba. Canada is negotiating a similar treaty called the Canada‚ÄìCentral American Free Trade Agreement. Once passed by the countries involved, tariffs on about 80% of U.S. exports to the participating countries were eliminated immediately and the rest were phased out over the subsequent decade. As a result, CAFTA-DR does not require substantial reductions in U.S. import duties with respect to the other countries, as the vast majority of goods produced in the participating countries already entered the United States duty-free due to the U.S. government's Caribbean Basin Initiative. With the addition of the Dominican Republic, the trade group's largest economy, the region covered by CAFTA-DR is the second-largest Latin American export market for U.S. producers, behind only Mexico, buying $29 billion of goods in 2015. Two-way trade amounted to about $50 billion in the same year. While not necessarily a part of Plan Puebla Panama, CAFTA is a necessary precursor to the execution of Plan Puebla Panama by the Inter-American Development Bank. The plan includes construction of highways linking Panama City to Mexico City, Texas, and the rest of the United States. CAFTA-DR reduces tariffs, but every CAFTA country sets its overall tax level. Support In January 2002 U.S. President George W. Bush declared CAFTA as a priority and received \\"fast track\\" authority from Congress to negotiate it. Negotiations began in January 2003, and agreement was reached with El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua on December 17, 2003, and with Costa Rica on January 25, 2004. That same month, negotiations began with the Dominican Republic to join CAFTA. On May 28, 2004, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick, Costa Rican Minister of Trade Alberto Trejos, Salvadoran Economy Minister Miguel Lacayo, Guatemalan Economy Minister Marcio Cuevas, Honduran Minister of Industry and Commerce Norman Garc√≠a, and Nicaraguan Minister of Development, Industry and Commerce Mario Arana signed the 2,400-page document at headquarters of the Organization of American States. Negotiations with the Dominican Republic concluded on March 15, 2004, and a second signing ceremony including Dominican Republic Minister of Industry and Commerce Sonia Guzm√°n was held on August 5, 2004. Opposition Anti-CAFTA graffiti in San Jos√©, Costa Rica In May 2004 the Salvadoran American National Network, the largest national association of Central American community-based organizations in the United States, expressed opposition to CAFTA, which they claimed was not ideologically motivated: \\"As immigrants, we have a deep understanding of the potential benefits of improved transnational cooperation. We would welcome an agreement that would increase economic opportunity, protect our shared environment, guarantee workers' rights and acknowledge the role of human mobility in deepening the already profound ties between our countries. However, the CAFTA agreement falls far short of that vision.\\"Central American Immigrant Organizations Oppose CAFTA While manufacturing costs of generic drugs are relatively cheap, the costs of human tests are relatively expensive, and tests take months or years. If generic manufacturers had to redo the tests, the generic drug would be more expensive, and generic manufacturers might not be able to do the tests at all. Furthermore, if generic manufacturers had to redo the tests, they would have to compare the new, effective drugs to less-effective drugs, which according to Doctors Without Borders, would be unethical. In the United States, drug manufacturers must make test data public for generic manufacturers. Under CAFTA's test data exclusivity, drug manufacturers could keep test data secret, which would make it more difficult for local companies to produce generic drugs, and enable multinational pharmaceutical companies to keep a monopoly on branded drugs, including those used to treat AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.\\"Data exclusivity in international trade agreements: What consequences for access to medicines?\\" M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res whitepaper In Guatemala mass protest were violently repressed by the government and strikes occurred in Costa Rica in opposition to the trade agreement. Furthermore, many Catholic bishops in Central America and the United State opposed the treaty, just as many social movements in the region. (Comparative Politics of Latin America (page 469), Daniel C. Hellinger) Provisions To create an FTA, governments pledge to grant market access to foreign firms by reducing and eventually eliminating tariffs and other measures that protect domestic products. To do so, the CAFTA-DR treaty stipulates national treatment and includes a most-favored nation clause. It also includes the protection of international property rights and requires from their signatories certain measures in the realm of transparency (e.g., parties are obligated to criminalize bribery in matters affecting international trade or investment). Moreover, the agreement includes i.a. chapters on investment, public procurement procedures, and financial services. Antidumping and countervailing duty measures may not be challenged.  Cross-border trade in services  Each member country must treat service suppliers of another member country no less favorably than its own suppliers or those of any other member country. It requires firms to establish a local presence as a condition for supplying a service on a cross-border basis.  Financial services  CAFTA-DR imposes rules requiring member countries to treat service suppliers of another member country no less favorably than its own suppliers or those of any other country, prohibits certain quantitative restrictions on market access of financial institutions, and bars restrictions on the nationality of senior management.  Investment  CAFTA-DR establishes rules to protect investors from one member country against unfair or discriminatory government actions when they make or attempt to make investments in another member country's territory. Investors enjoy six basic protections: # Non-discriminatory treatment relative to domestic investors as well as investors of non-parties; # Limits on ‚Äúperformance requirements‚Äù; # Free transfer of funds related to an investment; # Protection from expropriation other than in conformity with customary international law; # A ‚Äúminimum standard of treatment‚Äù in conformity with customary international law; # The ability to hire key managerial personnel without regard to nationality.  Government procurement  Each member country must apply fair and transparent procurement procedures and rules and prohibiting each government and its procuring entities from discriminating in purchasing practices against goods, services, and suppliers from the other member countries.  Agriculture  CAFTA-DR requires that tariffs and quotas be administered in a manner that is transparent, nondiscriminatory, responsive to market conditions and minimally burdensome on trade and allows importers to fully utilize import quotas. Each member country will eliminate export subsidies on agricultural goods destined for another CAFTA-DR country.  Intellectual property rights  Member countries must ratify or accede to treaties governing intellectual property rights, such as the WIPO Copyright Treaty. Each member country must provide: * Protection for marks and geographical indications, including protecting preexisting trademarks against infringement by later geographical indications. * Efficient and transparent procedures governing the application for protection of marks and geographical indications. * Copyright protection for the life of the author plus 70 years (for works measured by a person's life), or 70 years (for corporate works). It also includes provisions on anticircumvention, under which member countries commit to prohibit tampering with digital rights management technology. Member countries agree to make patents available for any invention, subject to limited exclusions, and confirm the availability of patents for new uses or methods of using a known product. To guard against arbitrary revocation of patents, the grounds for revoking a patent must meet the high standard of not having merited the patent in the first place. CAFTA- DR also ensures test data exclusivity for pharmaceutical corporations. It protects test data that a company submits in seeking marketing approval for such products by precluding other firms from relying on the data.  Dispute resolution  If a dispute over an actual or proposed national rule cannot be resolved after a 30-day consultation, the matter may be referred to a panel comprising independent experts that the parties select. Once the procedure before the panel is concluded, the panel will issue a report. The parties will attempt to resolve the dispute based on the panel's report. If no amicable resolution is possible, the complaining party may suspend trade benefits equivalent in effect to those it considers were impaired, or may be impaired, as a result of the disputed measure. If a dispute arises under both CAFTA-DR and the WTO Agreement, the complaining party may choose either forum.  Political standards  CAFTA-DR contains certain provisions that do not have the quality of mere technical liberalization, but are rather a commitment to political standards. The treaty obligates governments to the enforcement of environmental laws and improvement of the environment. CAFTA-DR Environmental Cooperation Agreement, signed in concert with the FTA, provides for environmental cooperation on issues of mutual environmental concern. Furthermore, CAFTA-DR contains provisions for the enforcement of the International Labour Organization's core labor standards.

The first creation, which was by writ, was for John de Cromwell in 1308. On his death, the barony became extinct. The second creation came in 1375 when Ralph de Cromwell was summoned by writ to Parliament as Lord Cromwell. His grandson, the third baron, served as Lord High Treasurer to King Henry VI. However, on his death in 1455 the barony fell into abeyance between his nieces Maude and Joan. On Joan's death in 1490 the abeyance was terminated in favour of Maude, the fourth holder. When she died childless in 1497 the peerage once again fell into abeyance, this time between the daughters of the first baron. The title remained in abeyance for over 400 years. However, in 1922 the Committee for Privileges of the House of Lords reported in favour of the petition for the termination of the abeyancy of Selina Frances Bewicke- Copley. She was the daughter of Sir Charles Watson Copley, 3rd Baronet, and one of the co-heirs of Maud, daughter of the first baron Cromwell. Selina died in 1923 and in July of the same year the abeyance was terminated in favour of her son Robert Godfrey Wolesley Bewicke-Copley, who became the fifth baron. He notably served as Lord Lieutenant of Leicestershire. the ancient barony is held by his grandson, the seventh baron, who succeeded his father in 1982. Having lost his seat in the House of Lords under the House of Lords Act 1999, in April 2014 he was elected at a hereditary peers' by-election as a Crossbencher. The third creation of the title came in 1461 when Sir Humphrey Bourchier was summoned by writ to Parliament as Lord Cromwell. On his death the barony became extinct. The fourth creation of the title came in 1536 for the famous statesman Thomas Cromwell, who served in many political offices, including Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lord Chancellor, and Lord Privy Seal. In contrast to the three previous creations this peerage was created by letters patent. In 1540, Lord Cromwell was made Earl of Essex, but later that year he was executed for treason, and all of his titles were forfeit. The final creation of the title came in 1540 for Cromwell's son, Gregory, also by letters patent. His great-grandson, the fourth baron, was made Earl of Ardglass in 1645.

According to Hesiod's myth, \\"great and powerful figures were to be honoured after death as a daimon‚Ä¶\\" A daimon is not so much a type of quasi-divine being, according to Burkert, but rather a non-personified \\"peculiar mode\\" of their activity. In Hesiod's Theogony, Pha√´ton becomes an incorporeal daimon or a divine spirit,\\"œÄŒøŒπŒÆœÉŒ±œÑŒø, Œ¥Œ±ŒØŒºŒøŒΩŒ± Œ¥·øñŒøŒΩ\\"; Hesiod, Theogony 991. but, for example, the ills released by Pandora are deadly deities, keres, not daimones. From Hesiod also, the people of the Golden Age were transformed into daimones by the will of Zeus, to serve mortals benevolently as their guardian spirits; \\"good beings who dispense riches‚Ä¶[nevertheless], they remain invisible, known only by their acts\\".Hesiod, Works and Days 122-26. The daimones of venerated heroes were localized by the construction of shrines, so as not to wander restlessly, and were believed to confer protection and good fortune on those offering their respects. One tradition of Greek thought, which found agreement in the mind of Plato, was of a daimon which existed within a person from their birth, and that each individual was obtained by a singular daimon prior to their birth by way of lot. In the Old Testament, evil spirits appear in the book of Judges and in Kings. In the Septuagint, made for the Greek-speaking Jews of Alexandria, the Greek √°ngelos (·ºÑŒ≥Œ≥ŒµŒªŒøœÇ \\"messenger\\") translates the Hebrew word mal'ak, while daim√≥nion (Œ¥Œ±ŒπŒºœåŒΩŒπŒøŒΩ; pl. daim√≥nia (Œ¥Œ±ŒπŒºœåŒΩŒπŒ±)), which carries the meaning of a natural spirit that is less than divine (see supernatural), translates the Hebrew word shedim as well as the word se'irim in some verses and words for idols (foreign deities), and describes the being Asmodeus in the Book of Tobit.

A Greek-English Lexicon. Socrates In Plato's Symposium, the priestess Diotima teaches Socrates that love is not a deity, but rather a \\"great daemon\\" (202d). She goes on to explain that \\"everything daemonic is between divine and mortal\\" (202d‚Äìe), and she describes daemons as \\"interpreting and transporting human things to the gods and divine things to men; entreaties and sacrifices from below, and ordinances and requitals from above...\\" (202e). In Plato's Apology of Socrates, Socrates claimed to have a daimonion (literally, a \\"divine something\\")Plato, Apology 31c‚Äìd, 40a; p. 16, Burnet, Plato's Euthyprho, Apology of Socrates, and Crito. that frequently warned him‚Äîin the form of a \\"voice\\"‚Äîagainst mistakes but never told him what to do.pp. 16‚Äì17, Burnet, Plato's Euthyprho, Apology of Socrates, and Crito; pp. 99‚Äì100, M. Joyal, \\"To Daimonion and the Socratic Problem\\", Apeiron vol. 38 no. 2, 2005. The Platonic Socrates, however, never refers to the daimonion as a daim≈çn; it was always referred to as an impersonal \\"something\\" or \\"sign\\".p. 16, Burnet, Plato's Euthyprho, Apology of Socrates, and Crito; p. 63, P. Destr√©e, \\"The Daimonion and the Philosophical Mission\\", Apeiron vol. 38 no. 2, 2005. By this term he seems to indicate the true nature of the human soul, his newfound self- consciousness.Paolo De Bernardi, Socrate, il demone e il risveglio, from \\"Sapienza\\", no. 45, ESD, Naples 1992, pp. 425‚Äì43. Paul Shorey sees the daimonion not as an inspiration but as \\"a kind of spiritual tact checking Socrates from any act opposed to his true moral and intellectual interests.\\"The Republic, volume 2, p. 52, note, italics added. Regarding the charge brought against Socrates in 399, Plato surmised \\"Socrates does wrong because he does not believe in the gods in whom the city believes, but introduces other daemonic beings‚Ä¶\\" Burkert notes that \\"a special being watches over each individual, a daimon who has obtained the person at his birth by lot, is an idea which we find in Plato, undoubtedly from earlier tradition. The famous, paradoxical saying of Heraclitus is already directed against such a view: 'character is for man his daimon'\\". Plato and Proclus In the ancient Greek religion, daimon designates not a specific class of divine beings, but a peculiar mode of activity: it is an occult power that drives humans forward or acts against them. Since daimon is the veiled countenance of divine activity, every deity can act as daimon. A special knowledge of daimones is claimed by Pythagoreans, whereas for Plato, daimon is a spiritual being who watches over each individual, and is tantamount to a higher self, or an angel. While Plato is called ‚Äòdivine‚Äô by Neoplatonists, Aristotle is regarded as daimonios, meaning ‚Äòan intermediary to deities' ‚Äì therefore Aristotle stands to Plato as an angel to a deity. For Proclus, daimones are the intermediary beings located between the celestial objects and the terrestrial inhabitants. Categories genius facing a woman with a tambourine and mirror, from southern Italy, about 320 BC. The Hellenistic Greeks divided daemons into good and evil categories: agathoda√≠m≈çn (·ºÄŒ≥Œ±Œ∏ŒøŒ¥Œ±ŒØŒºœâŒΩ \\"noble spirit\\"), from agath√≥s (·ºÄŒ≥Œ±Œ∏œåœÇ \\"good, brave, noble, moral, lucky, useful\\"), and kakoda√≠m≈çn (Œ∫Œ±Œ∫ŒøŒ¥Œ±ŒØŒºœâŒΩ \\"malevolent spirit\\"), from kak√≥s (Œ∫Œ±Œ∫œåœÇ \\"bad, evil\\"). They resemble the Arabic jinni (or genie), and in their humble efforts to help mediate the good and ill fortunes of human life, they resemble the Christian guardian angel and adversarial demon, respectively. Eudaimonia (Œµ·ΩêŒ¥Œ±ŒπŒºŒøŒΩŒØŒ±) came to mean \\"well-being\\" or \\"happiness\\". The comparable Roman concept is the genius who accompanies and protects a person or presides over a place (see genius loci). A distorted view of Homer's daemon results from an anachronistic reading in light of later characterizations by Plato and Xenocrates, his successor as head of the Academy, of the daemon as a potentially dangerous lesser spirit:Samuel E. Bassett, \\"ŒîŒëŒôŒúŒ©Œù in Homer\\" The Classical Review 33.7/8 (November 1919), pp. 134-136, correcting an interpretation in Finsler, Homer 1914; the subject was taken up again by F.A. Wilford, \\"DAIMON in Homer\\" Numen12 (1965) pp. 217‚Äì32. Burkert states that in the Symposium, Plato has \\"laid the foundation\\" that would make it all but impossible to imagine the daimon in any other way with Eros, who is neither god nor mortal but a mediator in between, and his metaphysical doctrine of an > incorporeal, pure actuality, energeia ... identical to its performance: > ‚Äòthinking of thinking‚Äô, noesis noeseos is the most blessed existence, the > highest origin of everything. ‚ÄòThis is the god. On such a principle heaven > depends, and the cosmos.‚Äô The highest, the best is one; but for the movement > of the planets a plurality of unmoved movers must further be assumed. In the > monotheism of the mind, philosophical speculation has reached an end-point. > That even this is a self-projection of a human, of the thinking philosopher, > was not reflected on in ancient philosophy. In Plato there is an incipient > tendency toward the apotheosis of nous. ... He needs a closeness and > availability of the divine that is offered neither by the stars nor by > metaphysical principles. Here a name emerged to fill the gap, a name which > had always designated the incomprehensible yet present activity of a higher > power, daimon. Daemons scarcely figure in Greek mythology or Greek art: they are felt, but their unseen presence can only be presumed, with the exception of the agathodaemon, honored first with a libation in ceremonial wine-drinking, especially at the sanctuary of Dionysus, and represented in iconography by the chthonic serpent. Burkert suggests that, for Plato, theology rests on two Forms: the Good and the Simple; which \\"Xenocrates unequivocally called the unity god\\" in sharp contrast to the poet's gods of epic and tragedy. Although much like the deities, these figures were not always depicted without considerable moral ambiguity: > \\"On this account, the other traditional notion of the daemon as related to > the souls of the dead is elided in favour of a spatial scenario which > evidently also graduated in moral terms; though [Plato] says nothing of that > here, it is a necessary inference from her account, just as Eros is midway > between deficiency and plenitude. ... Indeed, Xenocrates ... explicitly > understood daemones as ranged along a scale from good to bad. ... [Plutarch] > speaks of ‚Äògreat and strong beings in the atmosphere, malevolent and morose, > who rejoice in [unlucky days, religious festivals involving violence against > the self, etc.], and after gaining them as their lot, they turn to nothing > worse.‚Äô ... The use of such malign daemones by human beings seems not to be > even remotely imagined here: Xenocrates' intention was to provide an > explanation for the sheer variety of polytheistic religious worship; but it > is the potential for moral descrimination offered by the notion of daemones > which later ... became one further means of conceptualizing what > distinguishes dominated practice from civic religion, and furthering the > transformation of that practice into intentional profanation ... Quite when > the point was first made remains unanswerable. Much the same thought as > [Plato's] is to be found in an explicitly Pythagorean context of probably > late Hellenistic composition, the Pythagorean Commentaries, which evidently > draws on older popular representations: ‚ÄòThe whole air is full of souls. We > call them daemones and heroes, and it is they who send dreams, signs and > illnesses to men; and not only men, but also to sheep and other domestic > animals. It is towards these daemones that we direct purifications and > apotropaic rites, all kinds of divination, the art of reading chance > utterances, and so on.‚Äô ... This account differs from that of the early > Academy in reaching back to the other, Archaic, view of daemones as souls, > and thus anticipates the views of Plutarch and Apuleius in the Principate > ... It clearly implies that daemones can cause illness to livestock: this > traditional dominated view has now reached the intellectuals\\". In the Hellenistic ruler cult that began with Alexander the Great, it was not the ruler, but his guiding daemon that was venerated. In the Archaic or early Classical period, the daimon had been democratized and internalized for each person, whom it served to guide, motivate, and inspire, as one possessed of such good spirits.W. W. Tarn, \\"The Hellenistic Ruler-Cult and the Daemon\\" The Journal of Hellenic Studies 48.2 (1928), pp. 206‚Äì219. Similarly, the first- century Roman imperial cult began by venerating the genius or numen of Augustus, a distinction that blurred in time.

In multitasking computer operating systems, a daemon ( or ) is a computer program that runs as a background process, rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user. Traditionally, the process names of a daemon end with the letter d, for clarification that the process is in fact a daemon, and for differentiation between a daemon and a normal computer program. For example, is a daemon that implements system logging facility, and is a daemon that serves incoming SSH connections. In a Unix environment, the parent process of a daemon is often, but not always, the init process. A daemon is usually created either by a process forking a child process and then immediately exiting, thus causing init to adopt the child process, or by the init process directly launching the daemon. In addition, a daemon launched by forking and exiting typically must perform other operations, such as dissociating the process from any controlling terminal (tty). Such procedures are often implemented in various convenience routines such as daemon(3) in Unix. Systems often start daemons at boot time that will respond to network requests, hardware activity, or other programs by performing some task. Daemons such as cron may also perform defined tasks at scheduled times. Terminology The term was coined by the programmers at MIT's Project MAC. They took the name from Maxwell's demon, an imaginary being from a thought experiment that constantly works in the background, sorting molecules. Unix systems inherited this terminology. Maxwell's demon is consistent with Greek mythology's interpretation of a daemon as a supernatural being working in the background, with no particular bias towards good or evil. However, BSD and some of its derivatives have adopted a Christian demon as their mascot rather than a Greek daemon. The word daemon is an alternative spelling of demon, and is pronounced . In the context of computer software, the original pronunciation has drifted to for some speakers. Alternate terms for daemon are service (used in Windows, from Windows NT onwards ‚Äî and later also in Linux), started task (IBM z/OS), and ghost job (XDS UTS). After the term was adopted for computer use, it was rationalized as a \\"backronym\\" for Disk And Execution MONitor. Daemons that connect to a computer network are examples of network services. Implementations=Unix-like systems In a strictly technical sense, a Unix-like system process is a daemon when its parent process terminates and the daemon is assigned the init process (process number 1) as its parent process and has no controlling terminal. However, more generally, a daemon may be any background process, whether a child of the init process or not. On a Unix-like system, the common method for a process to become a daemon, when the process is started from the command line or from a startup script such as an init script or a SystemStarter script, involves: * Optionally removing unnecessary variables from environment. * Executing as a background task by forking and exiting (in the parent \\"half\\" of the fork). This allows daemon's parent (shell or startup process) to receive exit notification and continue its normal execution. * Detaching from the invoking session, usually accomplished by a single operation, \`setsid()\`: ** Dissociating from the controlling tty. ** Creating a new session and becoming the session leader of that session. ** Becoming a process group leader. * If the daemon wants to ensure that it won't acquire a new controlling tty even by accident (which happens when a session leader without a controlling tty opens a free tty), it may fork and exit again. This means that it is no longer a session leader in the new session, and can't acquire a controlling tty. * Setting the root directory () as the current working directory so that the process does not keep any directory in use that may be on a mounted file system (allowing it to be unmounted). * Changing the umask to 0 to allow \`open()\`, \`creat()\`, and other operating system calls to provide their own permission masks and not to depend on the umask of the caller. * Redirecting file descriptors 0, 1 and 2 for the standard streams (stdin, stdout and stderr) to or a logfile, and closing all the other file descriptors inherited from the parent process. If the process is started by a super-server daemon, such as {{monoinetd{{mono, , or , the super-server daemon will perform those functions for the process, except for old-style daemons not converted to run under and specified as and \\"multi-threaded\\" datagram servers under . MS-DOS In the Microsoft DOS environment, daemon-like programs were implemented as terminate and stay resident (TSR) software. Windows NT On Microsoft Windows NT systems, programs called Windows services perform the functions of daemons. They run as processes, usually do not interact with the monitor, keyboard, and mouse, and may be launched by the operating system at boot time. In Windows 2000 and later versions, Windows services are configured and manually started and stopped using the Control Panel, a dedicated control/configuration program, the Service Controller component of the Service Control Manager ( command), the and commands or the PowerShell scripting system. However, any Windows application can perform the role of a daemon, not just a service, and some Windows daemons have the option of running as a normal process. Classic Mac OS and macOS On the classic Mac OS, optional features and services were provided by files loaded at startup time that patched the operating system; these were known as system extensions and control panels. Later versions of classic Mac OS augmented these with fully fledged faceless background applications: regular applications that ran in the background. To the user, these were still described as regular system extensions. macOS, which is a Unix system, uses daemons. Note that macOS uses the term \\"services\\" to designate software that performs functions selected from the Services menu, rather than using that term for daemons as Windows does. Etymology According to Fernando J. Corbat√≥, who worked on Project MAC in 1963, his team was the first to use the term daemon, inspired by Maxwell's demon, an imaginary agent in physics and thermodynamics that helped to sort molecules, stating, \\"We fancifully began to use the word daemon to describe background processes that worked tirelessly to perform system chores\\". In the general sense, daemon is an older form of the word \\"demon\\", from the Greek Œ¥Œ±ŒØŒºœâŒΩ. In the Unix System Administration Handbook Evi Nemeth states the following about daemons: A further characterization of the mythological symbolism is that a daemon is something that is not visible yet is always present and working its will. In the Theages, attributed to Plato, Socrates describes his own personal daemon to be something like the modern concept of a moral conscience: \\"The favour of the gods has given me a marvelous gift, which has never left me since my childhood. It is a voice that, when it makes itself heard, deters me from what I am about to do and never urges me on\\".

The original flag was designed by playwright Alwin Bully in early 1978 as the country prepared for independence. History and design The flag, adopted in 1978, features the national bird emblem, the sisserou parrot, which also appears on the coat of arms granted on 21 July 1961. This parrot, endemic to Dominica, is an endangered species with a population of only 250‚Äì350 individuals.\\"Amazona imperialis\\", The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Retrieved 12 September 2014. The green field represents the lush vegetation of the island. The cross represents the Trinity and Christianity, with its three colours symbolising the natives, the fertile soil, and the pure water. The 10 green five-pointed stars stand for the country's 10 parishes: (St Andrew, St David, St George, St John, St Joseph, St Luke, St Mark, St Patrick, St Paul, and St Peter), while the red disc stands for justice. The sisserou parrot is sometimes coloured either blue or purple (the parrot's actual colour). The use of purple makes the flag of Dominica one of only two flags of sovereign states (alongside the flag of Nicaragua) to contain the colour. The flag of Dominica, along with other national symbols, was the focus of a government-sponsored \\"Emblems Week\\" in 2016.
